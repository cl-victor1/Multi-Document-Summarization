BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
Eleven to 15 sand storms are expected hit China this spring,
about the same as last year when the country experienced 14 sand
storms but far less than the annual average of 26.
</P>
<P>
The State Forestry Administration (SFA) has called together a
team of 25 experts, including 10 members of the Chinese Academy
of Sciences, to help improve storm forecasting and warning. The
SFA is also investing heavily in setting up a monitoring network,
said an administration official.
</P>
<P>
Another official told Xinhua that the SFA is taking five specific
measures to deal with sand storms, but he refused to say what the
measures were.
</P>
<P>
Other research shows that government departments have come up
with emergency plans and strengthened staff training to protect
the dry and vulnerable topsoil in north China. There has also
been a more strict enforcement of laws and regulations designed
to prevent trees from being cut or other practices that can cause
erosion.
</P>
<P>
Northern China has been frequently hit by strong wind gusts.
Extremely strong winds derailed a passenger train in Xinjiang
Uygur Autonomous Region on February 28, killing three people and
injuring 30 others, two of them seriously.
