Greek government blames domestic terrorists for U.S. embassy
attack
</HEADLINE>

ATHENS, Greece 2007-01-12 21:58:12 UTC
</P>
<P>
A rocket-propelled grenade struck the U.S. Embassy early Friday,
causing limited damage and no injuries, but reviving fears of a
resurgence of far-left Greek militant groups that carried out
deadly strikes over three decades.
</P>
<P>
The shoulder-fired missile narrowly missed a large blue-and-white
U.S. seal on the embassy's facade and damaged a third-floor
bathroom.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Ambassador Charles Ries called the attack "very serious" and
said no warning had been given.
</P>
<P>
"There can be no justification for such a senseless act of
violence," he told reporters outside the embassy. "The good news
is no one was hurt and (there was) minimal damage."
</P>
<P>
Greek authorities blamed domestic militant groups that have
carried out a spate of bombings against police and government
buildings despite a crackdown of terrorism before the Athens
Olympics in 2004.
</P>
<P>
Police are examining the authenticity of two calls claiming
responsibility from the group Revolutionary Struggle, which has
carried out six bombings since first appearing in 2003.
</P>
<P>
The shadowy group has criticized the United States in past
statements, citing treatment of prisoners at the U.S. military
detention center in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.
</P>
<P>
"It is very likely that this is the work of a domestic group,"
Public Order Vyron Polydoras said. "We believe this effort to
revive terrorism is deplorable and will not succeed."
</P>
<P>
In Washington, State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said the
United States also saw no early signs of international
involvement. The Pentagon received a report on the attack, but no
request for any action, a U.S. military official said.
</P>
<P>
The embassy was struck shortly before 6 a.m. (0400GMT), and the
blast shattered windows in nearby buildings. Commuter traffic in
the downtown area came to a standstill for three hours as police
cordoned off streets around the building to gather evidence --
dusting cars for fingerprints and gathering discarded chewing gum
and cigarette butts from the street.
</P>
<P>
The government said it was seeking permission from the courts to
view traffic camera footage, officially excluded from the police
investigation under strict Greek privacy laws.
</P>
<P>
Brad Wiggins, chief operating officer at U.S. security products
maker CompuDyne Corp., which supplies U.S. embassies, including
the one in Athens, with its products, said the rocket hit an
older part of the embassy building, which offers lower security
than a newly built annex.
</P>
<P>
"From what I saw, just from one photograph, I saw (the rocket
smashed) a window that was just a normal piece of glass ...
Typical commercial windows offer very little protection," Wiggins
said, speaking by telephone from in Montgomery, Alabama.
</P>
<P>
He said a common window would cost around US$200, while its blast
resistant equivalent would cost "several thousand."
</P>
<P>
Friday's attack resembled methods used by members of the
terrorist group November 17 who had eluded police since 1975
until their eventual capture and then conviction in 2003.
</P>
<P>
But the type of weapon used has not been seen in previous Greek
attacks: police identified the weapon late Friday as a
40-millimeter (1.57-inch) rocket-propelled grenade, RPG7,
Chinese-made in about 1974 from a Russian design.
</P>
<P>
Public opposition to U.S. policies -- and the invasion of Iraq in
particular -- has remained strong since Washington provided
support for a 1967-74 military dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
Government and opposition party officials strongly condemned the
attack, the third against the U.S. Embassy since the mid-1970s.
</P>
<P>
"I ... express the solidarity of the Greek people following this
deplorable action," Foreign Minister Dora Bakoyannis said.
</P>
<P>
State television said she had written to U.S. Secretary of State
Condoleezza Rice to promise full cooperation in efforts to find
the attacker, but the conservative government was criticized in
Greece over the attack at Athens' most heavily guarded site.
</P>
<P>
"How is such an attack on the American embassy possible, when the
site is the No. 1 target in the country?" said Alekos
Papadopoulos, spokesman for public order at the main opposition
Socialist party. "This points to problems with the police's
capabilities."
</P>
<P>
A police task force to investigate the attack will be headed by a
former counterterrorism chief who eradicated the far-left
November 17 group in 2002.
</P>
<P>
November 17 carried out a similar rocket attack against the
embassy in 1996 -- causing minor damage and no injuries -- bombed
buses with American servicemen, and assassinated four American
military and embassy officials.
</P>
<P>
The group was blamed for killing 23 people and dozens of bomb
attacks.
</P>
<P>
In 2003, a special court gave multiple life sentences to November
17's leader, chief assassin and three other members. Lesser
sentences were given to 10 others.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Embassy said it would reopen Tuesday, remaining closed
Monday for Martin Luther King Day.
