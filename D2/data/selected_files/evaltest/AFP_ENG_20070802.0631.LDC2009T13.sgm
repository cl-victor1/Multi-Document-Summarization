Bridge collapses over Mississippi River
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At least six people were killed after a bridge over the
Mississippi river collapsed Wednesday, plunging cars and trucks
together with massive chunks of concrete into the rushing waters,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
Several cars were flung into the river and others crushed as
parts of the bridge were sheared off.
</P>
<P>
A semi-truck caught fire after it was sliced in half, while a
busload of children was stranded on a collapsed section of the
roadway.
</P>
<P>
Some estimates said dozens of vehicles fell into the river, but
that could not be confirmed.
</P>
<P>
"We have confirmed six deaths and we are continuing the search,"
R.T. Rybak, the mayor of Minneapolis, Minnesota, said at a press
conference.
</P>
<P>
"At this point, we have searched approximately 50 cars... we have
confirmed that this will be a very tragic night when it is over."
</P>
<P>
In Washington, Department of Homeland Security officials said
there was no sign that the eight-lane bridge's collapse was the
result of terrorism, adding that it appeared to be linked to
engineering issues.
</P>
<P>
Minnesota governor Tim Pawlenty said the 40-year-old bridge was
last inspected in 2006 and no significant structural problems
were found.
</P>
<P>
"They notified us from an engineering standpoint the deck may
have to be rehabilitated or replaced in 2020 or beyond," he said.
</P>
<P>
There was, however, construction taking place on the bridge
"relating to concrete repair and rehabilitation and replacement,
guard rail replacement, righting replacement and work on the
joints," he said.
</P>
<P>
Images shot by local television showed a disastrous scene of
people crouching on bent and crumpled concrete with parts of the
bridge submerged in the brown river as smoke and flames drifted
from the wreckage.
</P>
<P>
Rescue workers tied with yellow rope waded through the water and
used boats to reach people stranded in the middle of the river.
</P>
<P>
A school bus loaded with 60 children with a church group could be
seen on the bridge but did not fall into the river as it
collapsed. The children were all rescued, although ten of them
were taken to hospital, the Red Cross said. The bridge was under
construction at the time of the accident and only one lane was
open in either direction when it collapsed shortly after 6 pm
(2300 GMT), right in the middle of the local rush hour.
</P>
<P>
Ramon Houge was driving on the bridge when he heard a rumbling
noise, saw the ground collapse in front of him and watched cars
go down into the water.
</P>
<P>
Traffic was bumper-to-bumper at the time, and he estimated
hundreds of people must have been involved.
</P>
<P>
"It didn't seem like it was real," he said.
</P>
<P>
Those still on solid ground backed up as best they could and he
saw kids on a yellow school bus with blood on their faces.
</P>
<P>
Sarah Fahnhorst, who lives in an apartment a block away from the
bridge, heard a huge thud and then "the entire building shook. It
shook the ground," she said.
</P>
<P>
Russ Knocke, spokesperson for the Department of Homeland
Security, told AFP that there was no suggestion of terrorism
involved in the disaster.
</P>
<P>
"There are no indications of a nexus to terrorism at this time,"
Knocke said.
</P>
<P>
"We continue to monitor the situation. State and local officials
have the lead in rescue and response efforts."
</P>
<P>
The 40-year-old arch bridge which rises 64 feet (20 meters) over
the river was undergoing repairs at the time of the accident, and
there were reports that construction workers were using a
jackhammer at the time of the collapse, AFP has learned.
