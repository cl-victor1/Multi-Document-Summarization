Cyclone smashes into Bangladesh coast
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A fierce cyclone packing extreme winds and torrential rain
smashed into Bangladesh's southwestern coast Thursday, wiping out
homes and trees in what officials described as the worst storm in
years.
</P>
<P>
The eye of cyclone Sidr, visible in satellite images as a
colossal swirling white mass racing north from the Bay of Bengal,
hit land in an impoverished coastal area near Bangladesh's border
with India.
</P>
<P>
"The cyclone has battered Bangladeshi coastal areas. The velocity
of the wind in that area is 220 to 240 kilometres (140 to 155
miles and hour). (This) is a violent storm," said Samarendra
Karmakar, the head of the Bangladeshi meteorological department.
</P>
<P>
The storm matched one in 1991 that sparked a tidal wave that
killed an estimated 138,000 people, Karmakar told AFP.
</P>
<P>
But he said he was optimistic a major effort this time to
evacuate villages and place people in special shelters could mean
low-lying Bangladesh -- one of the world's poorest countries --
would escape significant loss of life.
</P>
<P>
"It is not less severe than the 1991 cyclone, in some places it
is more severe. But we are expecting less casualties this time
because the government took early measures. We alerted people to
be evacuated early," he said.
</P>
<P>
An official at the ministry of disaster management and relief,
however, said damage to property and infrastructure would be
severe.
</P>
<P>
"Nothing can be predicted now but we expect the damage to be
enormous," said the official. "The storm is still moving with
great intensity."
</P>
<P>
So far only one death has been reported from cyclone Sidr -- an
elderly man who drowned when a boat crossing a river with 17
passengers capsized.
</P>
<P>
Officials in both Bangladesh and across the border in India --
which is also expecting highly destructive winds and torrential
rains -- have been racing to evacuate hundreds of thousands of
people from the coast over the past 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
Karmakar said rivers in the Sunderbans area, a vast mangrove
forest straddling the India-Bangladesh border and the natural
habitat of endangered Royal Bengal tigers, were also swelling
fast as the storm moved north in the direction of the capital
Dhaka.
</P>
<P>
An official in Barisal, 120 kilometres south of Dhaka, spoke of
severe destruction as the 500 kilometre-wide mass of cloud passed
overhead.
</P>
<P>
"Many trees have been uprooted and houses and schools blown
away," Mostofa Kamal, a district relief and rehabilitation
officer, told AFP by telephone.
</P>
<P>
"The houses are made of only tin, bamboo and straw, which cannot
withstand storms," explained another Bangladeshi district
administrator, Mohammad Monjur-e-Elahi.
</P>
<P>
Much of Bangladesh's south and centre has bunkered down for the
storm, with even the country's main sea port at Chittagong, to
the east of the cyclone's path, also closed.
</P>
<P>
Officials in India's coastal state of West Bengal also reported
destruction along India's part of the Sunderbans. There were no
immediate reports of casualties.
</P>
<P>
"Mud huts have been damaged and the roofs of several houses blown
off," said the state's relief minister, Mortaza Hossain. "The
army has been put on alert, (and) more than 100,000 coastal
villagers have been evacuated."
</P>
<P>
Authorities in India have been told to halt rail and other
transportation in some areas due to the likelihood of heavy
floods, said Ladu Ram Meena, deputy director of the weather
centre for India's eastern region.
</P>
<P>
He said large-scale damage to power and communication lines was
also expected.
</P>
<P>
Cyclone Sidr is expected to totally fizzle out on Saturday over
India's northeast, and just south of the mountain kingdom of
Bhutan.
</P>
<P>
Disaster prone Bangladesh's worst cyclone disaster was in 1970,
when some half a million people died.
