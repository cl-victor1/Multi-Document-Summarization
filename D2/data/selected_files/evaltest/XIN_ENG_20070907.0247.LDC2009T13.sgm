New study reveals women's health more at risk from sleep
deprivation

LONDON, Sept. 7 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
A new study by British researchers reveals that women's health is
much more at risk from sleep deprivation than men's.
</P>
<P>
The study, carried out by researchers at Warwick Medical School
at the University of Warwick, Britain, involved 5,766 volunteers
(4,199 men and 1,567 women) from 20 London-based civil service
departments, according to a press release from the university on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The researchers looked at men and women sleeping less than or
equal to 5 hours a night to see if their risk of developing
hypertension was any higher than men and women getting the
recommended 7 hours or more of sleep a night.
</P>
<P>
The researchers found that those women in the study group who
slept less than or equal to 5 hours a night were twice as likely
to suffer from hypertension than women who slept for the
recommended seven hours or more a night.
</P>
<P>
The researchers found no difference between men sleeping less
than 5 hours and those sleeping 7 hours or more.
</P>
<P>
The researchers defined hypertension as blood pressure equal to
or higher than 140/90 mm Hg or if the subject made regular use of
antihypertensive medications.
</P>
<P>
Among other problems, increased hypertension increases the risk
of cardiovascular problems, according to the researchers.
</P>
<P>
Sustained sleep curtailment, ensuing excessive daytime
sleepiness, and the higher cardiovascular risk are causes for
concern with emerging evidence suggesting a potential role for
sleep deprivation as a predictor or risk factor for conditions
such as obesity and diabetes, according to Professor Francesco
Cappuccio, who led the research.
