Herpes drug helps control AIDS virus and may prevent spread,
study says

Treating genital herpes can also help keep the AIDS virus under
control in women with both infections, and might reduce the
spread of HIV as well, the first major study to test this
strategy suggests.
</P>
<P>
Many people with HIV are also infected with the herpes type 2
virus, and scientists have long known that herpes sores on the
genitals can make it easier to become infected with the AIDS
virus and could increase the risk of transmitting HIV to others.
</P>
<P>
In the latest study, conducted in Africa and published in
Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine, women who took the
herpes drug valacyclovir had less HIV in their blood and in their
genital secretions.
</P>
<P>
The study did not look at whether the drug, sold as Valtrex by
GlaxoSmithKline PLC, actually reduces transmission of the AIDS
virus. However, scientists generally have found that the more
virus someone has, the greater the risk of transmission.
</P>
<P>
Doctors have been looking for novel ways to treat and prevent HIV
infection, particularly in poor countries where few can afford
modern AIDS drugs and the stigma keeps many from taking them.
Researchers recently found that circumcision lowers the risk of
spreading HIV, and they hope the same will prove true of treating
herpes.
</P>
<P>
"It does open some potential avenues to slowing down the HIV
epidemic," said Dr. Lawrence Corey, a leading herpes researcher
at the University of Washington who had no role in the study but
has received research grants from Glaxo.
</P>
<P>
There are 40,000 new HIV infections in the U.S. each year and 4.3
million new cases worldwide. Previous studies have shown that
herpes infections can triple a person's chance of acquiring HIV
and can make HIV-positive individuals more infectious.
</P>
<P>
In the study, 140 women from the West African nation of Burkina
Faso who were infected with the both the herpes and AIDS viruses
received either valacyclovir or dummy pills for three months.
Participants were not taking other AIDS medications.
</P>
<P>
Doctors took vaginal swabs and drew blood samples twice a week to
measure HIV levels.
</P>
<P>
Those who took the drug ended up with less HIV in the
bloodstream, with their count dropping from an average 20,000
virus copies per milliliter of blood to 8,000 copies. The placebo
group saw their HIV levels spike, from an average of 50,000 virus
copies per milliliter of blood to 63,000.
</P>
<P>
The treatment group was also less likely to have HIV in their
genital tract -- 13 percent had detectable virus levels during
each visit, compared with 27 percent in the placebo group.
</P>
<P>
The study involved researchers from France, England and Burkina
Faso and was funded by the French national AIDS research agency,
ANRS.
</P>
<P>
One of the study's authors, Dr. Philippe Mayaud of the London
School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine, called for more
research on herpes control methods, including the development of
a herpes vaccine. Mayaud has received research support from
Glaxo.
</P>
<P>
A larger study funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is
under way that aims to be the definitive word on whether treating
herpes patients with acyclovir, the first herpes drug, can slow
down HIV transmission.
</P>
<P>
Some AIDS specialists said it is unlikely herpes drugs will be
the first line of defense against AIDS. However, they said such
treatment could be useful in preventing HIV transmission in Third
World countries without access to modern AIDS drugs.
</P>
<P>
"If, heaven forbid, we didn't have treatments for HIV, this would
be something we would use. Fortunately, we have much better
therapies to treat HIV," said Dr. Michael Saag, director of the
AIDS Center at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. He has
consulted for Glaxo.
