Shoe attack on Bush mars farewell Iraq visit
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A journalist hurled two shoes at President George W. Bush on his
farewell visit to Iraq on Sunday, highlighting hostility still
felt toward the outgoing US leader who acknowledged that the war
is still not won.
</P>
<P>
Muntazer al-Zaidi jumped up as Bush held a press conference with
Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, shouted "It is the farewell
kiss, you dog" and threw his footwear.
</P>
<P>
The president lowered his head and the first shoe hit the
American and Iraqi flags behind the two leaders. The second was
off target.
</P>
<P>
Zaidi, a reporter with the Al-Baghdadia channel which broadcasts
from Cairo, was immediately wrestled to the ground by security
guards and frogmarched from the room.
</P>
<P>
Soles of shoes are considered the ultimate insult in Arab
culture. After Saddam Hussein's statue was toppled in Baghdad in
April 2003, many onlookers beat the statue's face with their
soles.
</P>
<P>
Bush laughed off the incident, saying: "It doesn't bother me. If
you want the facts, it was a size 10 shoe that he threw".
</P>
<P>
He later played down the incident. "I don't know what the guy's
cause is... I didn't feel the least bit threatened by it."
</P>
<P>
Bush, on his fourth and final official trip to Iraq since he
ordered the March 2003 invasion that toppled Saddam, admitted:
"There is still more work to be done."
</P>
<P>
As he and Maliki signed a security pact setting out new
guidelines for US troops in Iraq, the president said: "The war is
not over, but with the conclusion of these agreements... it is
decisively on its way to being won."
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Bush ventured out in a motorcade through Baghdad
streets, the first time he has gone somewhere other than a
military base or the heavily protected Green Zone.
</P>
<P>
Pool reports said the unmarked motorcade passed through darkened
streets that appeared heavily guarded, before arriving at
Maliki's residence.
</P>
<P>
Bush hands over the delicate task of overseeing the US withdrawal
from Iraq in five weeks to Barack Obama, who has pledged to turn
the page on the deeply unpopular war.
</P>
<P>
"I'm so grateful that I've had a chance to come back to Iraq
before my presidency ends," he said at a meeting with Iraqi
President Jalal Talabani.
</P>
<P>
In the evening, the president flew by helicopter from the Green
Zone to Camp Victory near Bahgdad airport, where he greeted
hundreds of US troops under a huge US flag and a gigantic crystal
chandelier in the Al Faw palace, formerly used by Saddam.
</P>
<P>
Bush has staunchly defended the invasion that triggered years of
deadly insurgency and sectarian violence that has killed tens of
thousands of Iraqis and more than 4,200 American troops.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, US Defense Secretary Robert Gates visited Iraq and
said that the US mission was in its "endgame."
</P>
<P>
The signing ceremony by Bush and Maliki marks the adoption of the
Status of Forces Agreement approved by Iraq's parliament in
November after months of political wrangling.
</P>
<P>
The pact will govern the presence of 146,000 US troops at more
than 400 bases when their UN mandate expires at the end of the
year, giving the Iraqi government veto power over virtually all
of their operations.
</P>
<P>
Gates, who Obama has picked to stay on at the Pentagon in the new
administration, told US troops on Saturday: "We are in the
process of the drawdown."
</P>
<P>
"We are, I believe, in terms of the American commitment, in the
endgame here in Iraq."
</P>
<P>
The pact envisages US combat troops leaving Iraq by the end of
2011 and departing from all urban areas by June 30 next year.
</P>
<P>
But the top US commander in Iraq, General Raymond Odierno, who
met with Gates, said that troops will stay in Iraqi cities in a
support and training role after June.
</P>
<P>
The Shiite radical movement of Moqtada Sadr, which strongly
opposed the security deal, said Odierno's remarks showed that
Washington had no intention of sticking by the deadlines.
</P>
<P>
"As we predicted, the comments fly in the face of the security
agreement," the head of the movement's political bureau, Liwaa
Sumeissim, told AFP just before Bush's arrival.
</P>
<P>
Sadr's movement said it plans a protest on Monday in the holy
city of Najaf.
</P>
<P>
Obama has said he favours "a responsible withdrawal from Iraq"
within 16 months of taking office.
</P>
<P>
While security in Baghdad and other parts of the country has
significantly improved, there are still almost daily bomb
attacks.
</P>
<P>
Problems also dog the massive economic reconstruction programme
undertaken since the invasion.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times reported on Sunday that an unpublished US
government report concluded that US-led efforts to rebuild Iraq
were crippled by bureaucratic turf wars, violence and ignorance
of the basic elements of Iraqi society, resulting in a 100
-billion-dollar failure.
</P>
<P>
By mid-2008, the document said, 117 billion dollars had been
spent on the reconstruction of Iraq, including about 50 billion
in US taxpayer money, the newspaper reported.
