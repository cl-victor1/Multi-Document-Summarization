HELSINKI, Nov. 8 (Xinhua)

<P>
Eight victims of the Finnish school shooting have been
identified, including the school's principal and nurse as well as
six students, Finish police confirmed on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The victims of Jokela high school were killed when student Pekka-
Eric Auvinen opened fire with a 22-caliber handgun in the middle
of the school day. He then shot himself in the head and died late
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Twelve other people were taken to hospitals for injuries. Only
one had a slight gunshot wound.
</P>
<P>
Police said Thursday afternoon at a press conference that the
gunman at the school shooting in Tuusula had acted alone.
Investigators added the shooter had selected his victims at
random.
</P>
<P>
Some 69 rounds were fired during the incident and the gunman had
a total of 500 rounds in his possession.
</P>
<P>
Police said that no shots were fired by police. The incident at
the school ended when the gunman shot himself. He was found by
police in a school hallway with serious injuries Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The shooter was a student at the school. He had no criminal
background, and came from a family of four where he was the
oldest child. Just a few weeks ago, as a member of a shooting
club, he received a gun permit for the 22-calibre target pistol
he used in the killings.
</P>
<P>
Police said Auvinen had left a suicide note in which he said
goodbye to his family and expressed his anger towards society.
</P>
<P>
Flags hung at half-mast across Finland on Thursday as a show of
mourning for the victims of the Jokela school shooting. Many
churches have planned services to remember the victims over the
next few days.
