Major recall of pet food has animal owners frantic

UNION, New Jersey 2007-03-17 20:48:41 UTC

<P>
Pet owners were worried Saturday that the pet food in their
cupboard may be deadly after millions of containers of dog and
cat food sold at major retailers across North America were
recalled.
</P>
<P>
Menu Foods, the Ontario-based company that produced the pet food,
said Saturday it was recalling dog food sold under 48 brands and
cat food sold under 40 brands including Iams, Nutro and Eukanuba.
The food was distributed throughout the United States, Canada and
Mexico by major retailers such as Wal-Mart, Kroger and Safeway.
</P>
<P>
An unknown number of cats and dogs had suffered kidney failure
and about 10 died after eating the affected pet food, the company
said.
</P>
<P>
Many stores that sold the affected brands frantically pulled
packages off shelves.
</P>
<P>
At a Petsmart store in Union, Silviene Grzybowski became worried
when the four types of Iams products she buys for her cat,
Smokey, had vanished from shelves. The cat was very sick and had
not been eating for days, she said.
</P>
<P>
"The vet told us to buy her her favorite food, but I'm going to
call the vet right now," Grzybowski said, looking at an
announcement Petsmart had taped to shelves announcing the recall.
</P>
<P>
A complete list of the recalled products along with product
codes, descriptions and production dates was available from the
Menu Foods Web site, http://www.menufoods.com/recall.
</P>
<P>
Menu Foods' chief executive and president Paul Henderson told the
Associated Press on Friday that the company was still trying to
figure out what happened.
</P>
<P>
He said that the company had received an undisclosed number of
owner complaints that dogs and cats were vomiting and suffering
kidney failure after eating its products.
</P>
<P>
The recall covers the company's "cuts and gravy" style food,
which consists of chunks of meat in gravy, sold in cans and small
foil pouches from Dec. 3 to March 6.
</P>
<P>
In Omaha, Nebraska, Susan Balvanz said she sometimes feeds her
five cats packets of sliced meat and gravy sold by Nutro
Products, one of the brands affected.
</P>
<P>
"I've done so much research on pet food. It didn't surprise me
but it scared me all the same," said Balvanz.
</P>
<P>
She said her 9-year-old cat, Boots, was especially fond of the
food but seemed to have lost its appetite in the last few days.
</P>
<P>
At the Missouri Valley Veterinary Clinic in Bismarck, North
Dakota, veterinarian Jacob Carlson has been referring worried pet
owners to the Menu Foods web site.
</P>
<P>
"We've had a lot of calls," Carlson said, although none of his
patients were sick.
</P>
<P>
The company said it makes pet food for 17 of the top 20 North
American retailers. It is also a contract manufacturer for the
top branded pet food companies, including Procter &amp; Gamble
Co.
