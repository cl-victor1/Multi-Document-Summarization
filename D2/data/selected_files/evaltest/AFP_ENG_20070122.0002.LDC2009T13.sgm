Conservationists meet to avert feared tuna extinction
</HEADLINE>

<P>
International tuna conservation bodies Monday opened their first
joint meeting to look at ways to save the animals from
overfishing, which environmentalists fear is driving them to
extinction.
</P>
<P>
The five-day meeting in the western Japanese city of Kobe will
look at ways to share information among regions to monitor tuna
numbers and control illegal fishing vessels, officials said.
</P>
<P>
"Our goal should be to achieve sustainable use of tuna resources
for the future and to prove both domestically and internationally
that maintaining tuna fishing is possible," Toshiro Shirasu, the
head of Japan's Fisheries Agency, said in opening remarks.
</P>
<P>
Two international fishing industry groups have called on the
meeting to declare a moratorium on the use of any additional
large tuna vessels to stop the stocks from diminishing further.
</P>
<P>
The meeting brings together five tuna conservation bodies that
cover different regions, including the Pacific Ocean, Atlantic
Ocean and Indian Ocean. Representatives of 60 countries or areas
are taking part, officials said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is expected to adopt an action plan on Friday to
cooperate on the conservation and management of tuna stocks, said
Takaaki Sakamoto, a Japanese official attending the conference.
</P>
<P>
Japan eats a quarter of the world's tuna, more than any other
country, but faces pressure from environmentalists, who have
blamed the global fad for Japanese food for bringing tuna numbers
to the brink of extinction.
</P>
<P>
An international commission in November reduced the world's gross
catch of bluefin tuna in the Mediterranean from 32,000 tons in
2006 to 29,500 tons this year, a move likely to lead to an import
crunch in Japan.
</P>
<P>
Japan has also accepted a major cut in its quota for southern
bluefin tuna in the Pacific Ocean as punishment for overfishing.
