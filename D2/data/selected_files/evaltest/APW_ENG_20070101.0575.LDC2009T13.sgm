An Indonesian passenger plane carrying 102 people disappeared in
stormy weather on Monday, and rescue teams were sent to search an
area where military aviation officials feared the Boeing 737-400
aircraft may have crashed.
</P>
<P>
Transport Minister Hatta Radjasa said a radio communication was
picked up over central Sulawesi, a major island in the Indonesian
archipelago about 750 kilometers (470 miles) from the Adam Air
flight's destination. He said emergency crews were on their way
to search for survivors.
</P>
<P>
"Let's hope the plane had an emergency landing," he told El-
Shinta radio.
</P>
<P>
It was unknown if the aircraft disappeared over sea or land, but
the Navy was contacted about a possible sea rescue operation.
</P>
<P>
Eddy Suyanto, military airport chief in South Sulawesi, said the
final transmissions indicated "a big chance it had an accident or
a crash."
</P>
<P>
Search parties comprising an airplane and five helicopters would
set out to two possible locations at dawn Tuesday, he said.
</P>
<P>
Air traffic controllers lost contact with flight KI-574 while it
was flying at 10,700 meters (35,000 feet) from Indonesia's main
island of Java to Sulawesi. It was still missing more than eight
hours after its scheduled arrival.
</P>
<P>
The 17-year-old plane -- on a two-hour flight from East Java to
Manado, on Sulawesi's northern tip -- carried six crew and 96
passengers, including 11 children.
</P>
<P>
National aviation chief Ichsan Tatang refused to speculate about
the cause of the incident because the plane was in good
condition, but stressed that it was flying in "very bad weather."
</P>
<P>
In the North Sulawesi capital Manado, hundreds of people gathered
at the airport seeking information about their missing relatives.
</P>
<P>
Justin Tumurang, 25, was waiting at the airport to pick up her
twin sister, but she never arrived.
</P>
<P>
"Being a twin, we share almost every feeling. I felt something
was not right, and it grew worse. Now I feel pain," she said.
</P>
<P>
Several navy officers were also believed to have been onboard.
</P>
<P>
Weeks of seasonal rains and high winds in Indonesia have caused
several deadly floods, landslides and maritime accidents,
including the sinking of a ferry in the Java Sea on Friday that
has left dozens dead and some 400 still missing. That accident
was hundreds of kilometers (miles) from the area where the Adam
Air plane is believed to have gone down.
</P>
<P>
An Indonesian air traffic controller, Bhabr, told Metro TV the
plane hit "very bad" weather and may have run out of fuel
because, if still airborne, it would be "over its (fuel) limit."
</P>
<P>
"This is an emergency," Bhabr, who like many Indonesians uses one
name, told the broadcaster.
</P>
<P>
Adam Air, a privately owned low-cost airline, began operations in
Indonesia several years ago and most of its flights are domestic.
Last year, one of its jetliners lost all communication and
navigation systems for four hours during a flight between the
Indonesian capital Jakarta and Makassar on Sulawesi Island,
forcing the pilot to make an emergency landing.
