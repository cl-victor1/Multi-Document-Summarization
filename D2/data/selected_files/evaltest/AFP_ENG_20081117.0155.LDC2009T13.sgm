Pirates hijack Saudi tanker off African coast: US
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pirates have seized control of the Saudi-owned super tanker
Sirius Star off the east coast of Africa and are taking it
towards a Somali port, the US Navy said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The 318,000 deadweight tonnes Very Large Crude Carrier is the
largest vessel to be seized in an epidemic of piracy in the
region.
</P>
<P>
"According to the latest report we have, the ship is approaching
the Somali coast, heading towards Eyl (port)," a spokeswoman for
the Bahrain-based US Fifth Fleet told AFP by telephone from
Dubai. "Can we assume that the pirates are Somalis? Yes."
</P>
<P>
Sirius Star, which is owned by Saudi Aramco, carried 25 crew
members from Croatia, Britain, Philippines, Poland and Saudi
Arabia, according to a US Navy statement.
</P>
<P>
The South Korea-built ship, launched earlier this year, is
operated by Vela International and registered in Liberia.
</P>
<P>
Vela said the fully-laden tanker was seized by a group of armed
men about 420 nautical miles off the coast of Somalia on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"All 25 crew members on board are reported to be safe. Vela
response teams have been established and are working to ensure
the safe release of the crew members and the vessel," the company
said.
</P>
<P>
The International Maritime Bureau has reported that at least 83
ships have been attacked off Somalia since January, of which 33
were hijacked. Of those, 12 vessels and more than 200 crew were
still in the hands of pirates.
</P>
<P>
"Our presence in the region is helping deter and disrupt criminal
attacks off the Somali coast, but the situation with the Sirius
Star clearly indicates the pirates' ability to adapt their
tactics and methods of attack," Vice Admiral Bill Gortney said in
the US Navy statement.

<P>
Last week, the European Union started a security operation off
the coast of Somalia, north of Kenya, to combat growing acts of
piracy and protect ships carrying aid agency deliveries. It is
the EU's first-ever naval mission.
</P>
<P>
Dubbed Operation Atlanta, the mission, endorsed by the bloc's
defence ministers at talks in Brussels, is being led by Britain,
with its headquarters in Northwood, near London.
</P>
<P>
Pirates are well organised in the area where Somalia's
northeastern tip juts into the Indian Ocean, preying on a key
maritime route leading to the Suez Canal through which an
estimated 30 percent of the world's oil transits.
</P>
<P>
They operate high-powered speedboats and are heavily armed,
sometimes holding ships for weeks until they are released for
large ransoms paid by governments or owners.
</P>
<P>
NATO warships, along with ships and aircraft from several other
nations have been deployed in the region to protect commercial
shipping.
</P>
<P>
Norwegian shipping company Odfjell said on Monday it will no
longer sail through the pirate-plagued Gulf of Aden, choosing
instead the longer, more expensive but also safer route around
Cape of Good Hope.
</P>
<P>
Somalia has lacked an effective government since the 1991 ouster
of president Mohamed Siad Barre touched off a bloody power
struggle that has defied numerous attempts to restore stability.
