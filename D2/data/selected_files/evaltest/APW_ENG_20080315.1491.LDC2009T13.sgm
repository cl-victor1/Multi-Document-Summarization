A crane mounted to the side of a skyscraper under construction
toppled with a roar Saturday, smashing into a block of apartment
buildings, killing at least four people and setting off a
scramble for survivors in the rubble.
</P>
<P>
The crane split into pieces as it fell, pulverizing one small,
brick apartment building and demolishing parts of several other
buildings on Manhattan's East Side.
</P>
<P>
Mayor Michael Bloomberg said at least four people have died and
at least 10 people were injured in one of the city's worst
construction accidents in recent memory. An intensive, but
delicate rescue operation was under way to find anyone still
trapped in the several-stories-high piles of rubble.
</P>
<P>
John PlaGreco, who owns Fu Bar in the crushed building, said he
feared one of his employees was dead inside.
</P>
<P>
"Our bar is done," he said. "The crane crashed the whole
building. If I wasn't watching a Yankees game, I would've come to
work early and gotten killed."
</P>
<P>
About 19 of the planned 44-story condominium had been erected,
and the crane was scheduled to be extended Saturday so workers
could start work on a fresh story, said an owner of the company
that manages the construction site.
</P>
<P>
A piece of steel fell and sheared off one of the ties holding it
to the building, causing it to detach and topple, said Stephen
Kaplan, an owner of the Reliance Construction Group.
</P>
<P>
"It was an absolute freak accident," Kaplan said. "All the piece
of steel had to do was fall slightly left or right, and nothing
would have happened."
</P>
<P>
Kaplan said the company had subcontracted the work to different
companies and was not in charge of the crane. He was not sure
whether any workers at the site were among those killed.
</P>
<P>
Neighborhood residents said they had complained to the city
several times about the construction at the site, saying crews
worked illegal hours and the building was going up too fast.
</P>
<P>
City Building Department records showed that on March 4, a caller
told officials that the upper portions of the crane appeared to
lack the proper number of safety ties attaching it to the
building.
</P>
<P>
A city inspector visited the site and determined on March 6 that
no violation was warranted.
</P>
<P>
Another call questioning the crane's safety was dismissed as
unwarranted by another inspector in February.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, nearby residents reported hearing a terrible roar as
the structure detached from the condominium.
</P>
<P>
"First I heard a rumble, and it increased, and then it
increased," said Bill Reilly, who lives a block away. "It
continued building in strength until there was a final vroom! It
shook the six-story brick building that I live in."
</P>
<P>
Witnesses reported a strong smell of gas in the area on 51st
Street near 2nd Avenue. Gas utility Consolidated Edison said it
shut off service to area buildings.
</P>
<P>
Ben Galati, 54, said he was in the basement of a high-rise
apartment building across the street where he is a doorman.
</P>
<P>
"I heard a rumble outside. I said 'Let's get out of here!' And
then the crane came down. A split second later, I heard an
explosion," he said.
