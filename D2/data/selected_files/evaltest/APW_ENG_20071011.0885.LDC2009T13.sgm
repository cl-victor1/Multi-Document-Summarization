Johnson &amp; Johnson on Thursday voluntarily recalled certain
infant cough and cold products, citing "rare" instances of misuse
leading to overdoses.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, J&amp;J's McNeil-PPC unit said the misuse could
lead to overdoses "particularly in infants under two years of
age."
</P>
<P>
The products being recalled include infants' Tylenol Drops Plus
Cold; Concentrated Infants' Tylenol Drops Plus Cold &amp; Cough;
Pediacare Infant Drops Decongestant; Pediacare Infant Drops
Decongestant &amp; Cough; Pediacare Infant Dropper Decongestant;
Pediacare Infant Dropper Long-Acting Cough; and Pediacare Infant
Dropper Decongestant &amp; Cough (PE) products.
</P>
<P>
Cough and cold products for children age 2 and over and single-
ingredient pain reliever and fever reducers expressly labeled for
infants are not included in the recall.
</P>
<P>
The recall comes two months after the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration issued a public health advisory warning parents
not to give cough and cold medications to children under 2 years
of age without a doctor's direction.
</P>
<P>
The FDA's Nonprescription Drugs Advisory Committee will meet Oct.
18-19 to discuss the use of cough and cold drugs by children.
