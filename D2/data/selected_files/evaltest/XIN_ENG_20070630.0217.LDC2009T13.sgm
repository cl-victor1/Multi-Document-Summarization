LONDON, July 1 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
British police arrested two people in northern England in
connection with the attempted attacks in London and Glasgow,
police said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The two suspects were arrested in the county of Cheshire by
counter-terrorism officers, London's Metropolitan Police said in
a statement.
</P>
<P>
"Police have this evening arrested two people in connection with
events in London and Scotland on the 29th and 30th of June," said
the statement, without giving details.

A burning Jeep Cherokee crashed into the main terminal building
at Glasgow Airport on Saturday afternoon. Two people in the car,
including one suffering severe burns, were arrested and the
airport was evacuated and closed following the incident.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the incident, which police described as a terrorist
attack, vehicle access was closed at New Castle and Edinburgh
airports on a heightened state of alert, while armed police
closed off Blackpool airport at the west coast of Britain.

<P>
On Friday, police foiled a car bomb plot in central London after
they discovered explosives packed into a car outside a nightclub
near Piccadilly Circus and another car parked nearby.
</P>
<P>
Senior police officers said the attack at Glasgow airport was
linked to the incident in London, adding that all three vehicles
had carried large amounts of flammable materials.
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister Gordon Brown urged the public on Saturday
night to remain vigilant and support the police after the
national security alert level was raised to "critical."
</P>
<P>
He reassured people that it is right to raise the security level
at airports and crowded places.
</P>
<P>
"The British people must remain united, resolute and strong," he
said after chairing a meeting with security officers.
</P>
<P>
The highest security alert level means imminent attack is
expected.
</P>
<P>
Britain's Home Office has also ordered security to be tightened
across the country.
