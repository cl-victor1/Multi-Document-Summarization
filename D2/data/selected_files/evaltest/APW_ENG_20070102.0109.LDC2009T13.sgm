REMBANG, Indonesia 2007-01-02 02:17:40 UTC

Bloated bodies washed up along Indonesia's coastline days after a
ferry sank in stormy weather leaving 400 people missing, but
rescuers refused to give up hope with survivors still being found
in life-rafts, some desperately waving their arms.
</P>
<P>
Transport Minister Hatta Radjasa said Monday nearly 200 had been
found alive and vowed to keep up search and rescue efforts for at
least a week, as an air force plane dropped food and water to
some survivors stranded in the Java Sea.
</P>
<P>
Weeping relatives camped out at a local hospital were becoming
more and more desperate, however, and a temporary morgue was
being set up at a port close to where the crowded passenger ship
went down Friday just before midnight.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of body bags have been readied.
</P>

"I am tired of crying," said Sipan, who goes by only one name, as
he waited at Rembang hospital for news of his son. "Dead or
alive, I will accept his destiny. It is up to God. All I can do
is keep waiting."

The Senopati Nusantara sank quickly after being pounded by heavy
waves for more than 10 hours as it neared the end of a two-day
journey from the Indonesian section of Borneo island to the
country's main island of Java.
</P>
<P>
Radjasa said 628 people were on board, based on the manifest, and
that 191 survivors had been found alive either packed into
lifeboats, clinging on to debris or on beaches after swimming
ashore.
</P>
<P>
Search teams said by late Monday about 100 bodies had been
recovered.
</P>
<P>
Improved weather conditions were enabling emergency rations to be
dropped to survivors previously unreachable because of high waves
and strong winds.
</P>
<P>
Harrowing tales about the ship's last moments continued to
emerge.
</P>
<P>
Waluyo, 50, recalled holding onto a large tire and seeing two of
his children lose their grip and drown.
</P>
<P>
"For 17 hours we held on, sometimes being turned over in the
swell, but one-by-one the people fell off, including my two
children," he said. "I could not do anything apart from pray."
Waluyo also goes by a single name.
</P>
<P>
Cpt. Hadi Siswanto, the head of search and rescue operations,
said bodies were washing ashore hundreds of kilometers (miles)
east of the disaster site.
</P>
<P>
The ferry, which was built in Japan in 1992, had a capacity of
850 people. Officials say bad weather was the cause of the
accident.
