MAKERS TAKE INFANT DRUGS FOR COLDS OFF U.S. MARKET

WASHINGTON
</P>
<P>
Major makers of over-the-counter infant cough and cold medicines
announced Thursday that they were withdrawing their products from
the market for fear that they could be misused.
</P>
<P>
The voluntary withdrawal, already under way, affects only
products labeled for use in infants, not for use in children 2
and older. And some small companies could continue selling infant
products. More changes, perhaps mandated by federal drug
regulators, could be in the offing.
</P>
<P>
The withdrawal comes two weeks after safety reviewers within the
Food and Drug Administration urged the agency to consider an
outright ban of over-the-counter cough and cold products for
children under 6. Even the industry's main trade group, the
Consumer Healthcare Products Association, recommended two weeks
ago that the products not be used on infants.
</P>
<P>
Despite the recommendation, giant drugmakers like Johnson
&amp;amp; Johnson, Wyeth and Novartis continued to sell cough and
cold products labeled for infants. Last week, Rep. Henry A.
Waxman, D-Calif., chairman of the House Committee on Oversight
and Government Reform, sent a letter to the industry's trade
association asking why the products were still being sold.
</P>
<P>
Until Thursday, industry representatives answered that they were
discussing the issue with the FDA and defended their medicines as
safe and effective.
</P>
<P>
"The reason the makers of over-the-counter oral cough and cold
medicine for infants are withdrawing these medicines is that
there have been rare patterns of misuse leading to overdose
recently identified, particularly in infants," said Linda A.
Suydam, president of the trade association.
</P>
<P>
Next week, a committee of outside experts will consider the
safety of these medicines and offer recommendations to the
agency.
</P>
<P>
Dianne Murphy, director of the agency's office of pediatric
therapeutics, said in an interview that in addition to asking
basic questions about the drugs' safety and effectiveness, the
agency intended to question the experts closely about the
advisability of combination medicines. It will also explore how
to address the issue of accurate dosing when there are a dizzying
array of measuring devices, some provided by the manufacturers
and some not.
</P>
<P>
The experts will also consider whether children from 2 to 6
should be given these medicines.
