<P>
Finnish Prime Minister Matti Vanhanen extended on Wednesday his
government's condolences to a school shooting earlier in the day
that claimed eight lives and left a few more wounded, government
officials said.
</P>
<P>
After a government session dedicated to the discussion of the
tragedy on Wednesday evening, Vanhanen extended his government's
heartfelt condolences to the families and friends of victims of
the incident.
</P>
<P>
During the evening session, the government observed a short
period of silence to commemorate the victims.
</P>
<P>
Describing the shooting, the worst in the Nordic country's
history, as "a great tragedy,"Vanhanen said, "This is an awful
day. The shooting has deeply undermined the sense of security in
society."
</P>
<P>
The government also made a decision that flags are to be flown at
half-mast on all public buildings on Thursday, and urged the
whole country to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
The shooting took place in Jokela High School in Tuusula, some 50
kilometers north of Helsinki, the capital of Finland on
Wednesday. Eight people were killed, among whom one is the school
headmistress and others are the pupils. Several more were
injured.

<P>
School shootings are rare in Finland. Wednesday's school shooting
is the second in Finland in the past 20 years. In 1989, two
students were killed in a shooting at the Raumameri School in
Rauma.
