4 Are Killed as Crane Collapses on Buildings

NEW YORK

<P>
A crane tower at an East Side construction site toppled out of a
blue sky without warning Saturday, killing four construction
workers and injuring eight others, three of them critically,
authorities said. One woman remained unaccounted for Saturday
night.
</P>
<P>
The violent collapse at a site that has drawn complaints from
neighbors sent a massive cloud of debris and smoke into the air,
damaged buildings and cars, and triggered a rescue effort that
stretched into the night.
</P>
<P>
The construction site has been cited 13 times for violations
since January 2006, said city officials, who added that the
number was not unusual.
</P>
<P>
Abeer Shofani, 33, was asleep in a friend's apartment on East
50th Street when she awoke to a sound she described as "big
trucks crashing down off a highway ramp."
</P>
<P>
"I thought it was thunder but it kept going on and on and on,"
she said. Shofani, a singer, rushed outside to a scene of
pandemonium: overturned and smashed cars, pulverized brick and
wood, the air darkened with choking dust.
</P>
<P>
"I walked out in tears," she said.
</P>
<P>
The white metal tower, which stood next to a partially completed
residential building on the north side of 51st Street near Second
Avenue, toppled in mid-afternoon under calm winds. As it fell
south, the lower section of the tower, about 19 stories high,
clipped a corner of a brick residential building across the
street, seriously damaging apartments but causing no serious
injuries to residents, officials said.
</P>
<P>
The collision snapped the crane and sent its upper section
sailing south, where it collided with two buildings on East 50th
Street and landed on a brownstone, which contained apartments,
offices and a bar. The five-story building was demolished.
</P>
<P>
At least one man inside the brownstone was pulled out alive but
seriously injured, while rescue workers continued to search for a
woman believed to be inside when the building came down, fire
officials said.
</P>
<P>
"This is going to be a painstaking, hand operation as we try to
remove the rubble," said New York Fire Commissioner Nicholas
Scoppetta.
</P>
<P>
The four confirmed killed were construction workers at 303 E.
51st St., where construction crews have built about 19 stories of
a concrete-and-metal frame of a planned 43-story residential
building.
</P>
<P>
"It is a horrible situation. It's very gory, there is blood in
the street," said incoming New York Gov. David Paterson, who
arrived at the scene just before sunset. New York Mayor Michael
Bloomberg called the construction crash "one of the worst the
city has had."
</P>
<P>
Stephen Kaplan, who owns the Reliance Construction Group, which
manages the site's construction, told The Associated Press a
piece of steel fell and sheared off one of the ties holding the
crane to the building.
</P>
<P>
"It was an absolute freak accident," Kaplan said.
</P>
<P>
Kerry Walker, a retired iron worker whose family owns the crushed
building, said he had been concerned by the feverish pace of work
at the nearby tower.
</P>
<P>
"I just figured it'd come down, the way they work," he said.
</P>
<P>
Walker said he recently spoke with his brother about the state of
the site. "I told my brother if you don't hear from me next week
it's because the crane fell through my house. I was kidding," he
said.
</P>
<P>
A city Department of Buildings official said the crane was
inspected Friday and that the agency issued the builder, Reliance
Construction Group, a variance to use it Saturday to lift a new
section to lengthen the tower. The crane was in that process,
known as "jumping," when it fell, officials said.
</P>
<P>
"There is a lot we don't know about why and what happened,"
Bloomberg said.
</P>
<P>
Dogs and heat-seeking technology, were being used there as
emergency workers searched the heap, while others worked to
secure the broken crane, one section of which still rested
against a damaged building Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
That building and seven others were partially or completely
evacuated. City officials opened a shelter for displaced
residents at a school.The cleanup effort is expected to take
several days.
</P>
<P>
John LaGreco, 38, the owner of a bar called Fubar, which was on
the ground floor of the destroyed building, identified one of
those injured as Juan Perez, who he said worked as a porter at
the bar. LaGreco called Perez his "best friend" and said Perez
was at Bellevue Hospital being treated with a broken leg.
</P>
<P>
"He's one of the core employees of my business and I can't thank
the Lord enough for him to still be alive," he said. LaGreco said
a female cousin of a seriously injured male resident of the
building was missing.
</P>
<P>
Leslie, 49, who would give only her first name, was standing at
East 51st Street and Second Avenue when she heard a metallic
"clink-clink" and saw an elevator within the crane fall just
before the crane itself toppled.
</P>
<P>
"It was like rolling clouds of dust and debris down the street. I
couldn't run fast enough," said Leslie, 49, who would give only
her first name.
</P>
<P>
"It was so unnerving," said Leslie, an accountant. "I saw part of
the structure flying and I said, How do I run fast enough?"'
</P>
<P>
The crash and massive response, which involved more than 300
firefighters and a long list of city and state agencies, snarled
traffic across a wide swath of Manhattan and temporarily
disrupted subway and bus service.
