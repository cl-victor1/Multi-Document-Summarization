India tourist city blasts kill up to 35: report
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A series of bomb blasts tore through crowded markets in the
northwestern Indian tourist city of Jaipur on Tuesday, killing up
to 35 people and injuring many, police and news reports said.
</P>
<P>
Police said at least five bombs hit markets in Jaipur, the
capital of the western desert state of Rajasthan, and put their
initial estimate of the toll at six.
</P>
<P>
"It's a terror attack," police director general Amorjot Singh
Gill said.
</P>
<P>
"Early reports suggest six people are killed and 30 have been
injured," he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The NDTV station however put the toll at 35 people dead, citing
police, but that could not be independently confirmed.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Manmohan Singh condemned the blasts and appealed
for calm.
</P>
<P>
Scores of people were taken to hospital in Jaipur, some 260
kilometres (160 miles) from New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
One of the blasts took place near a temple, where cycles and
rickshaws lay in a mangled heap, television pictures showed.
</P>
<P>
Historic Jaipur, which has a population of more than two million,
is one of India's top tourist resorts and a favourite for
foreigners.
</P>
<P>
It is popularly known as the 'pink city' because of the ochre-
pink hue of its old buildings and crenellated city walls.
</P>
<P>
India has been plagued by bombings across the country in recent
years and routinely points the finger at foreign-based Islamic
militant groups fighting its rule in the Himalayan state of
Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
Within just the last year they have included bombings in the
southern city of Hyderabad which killed 43 people, at a cinema in
Punjab state in northern India which left six dead, and a series
of explosions outside courts in three northern cities that killed
13.
