Oil from a damaged supertanker has reached South Korea's western
shore, a Coast Guard official said Saturday, deepening fears of
environmental damage from the country's largest oil spill.
</P>
<P>
About 7 kilometers (4 miles) of coastline near Mallipo beach,
approximately 150 kilometers (95 miles) southwest of Seoul, has
been affected by the oil, said Jung Se-hi, a spokesman at the
Coast Guard headquarters in Incheon.

Jung said it was unclear how serious the contamination was. The
region is popular for its scenic beaches, and is also the site of
fish farms, a national maritime park and an important rest stop
for migrating birds.
