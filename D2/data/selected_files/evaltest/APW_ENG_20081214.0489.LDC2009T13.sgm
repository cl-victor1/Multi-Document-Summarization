The private Swiss bank Reichmuth &amp; Co says it has 385 million
Swiss francs ($327 million) at risk in the case of U.S. financier
Bernard L. Madoff, who has been accused of securities fraud.
</P>
<P>
A letter to investors posted on the Lucerne bank's Web site
Sunday says the exposure is through the Reichmuth Matterhorn, the
bank's "fund of hedge funds," and that amount represents about
3.5 percent of the 11 billion francs ($9.4 billion) under the
bank's management.
</P>
<P>
"We sincerely regret that Reichmuth Matterhorn is affected ... ,"
the letter said.
</P>
<P>
It is the second private Swiss bank to acknowledge having
investments in funds managed by Madoff. The Geneva-based Banque
Benedict Hentsch Fairfield Partners SA says its exposure is 56
million Swiss francs ($47.5 million) of client assets.
</P>
<P>
Swiss news media speculated Sunday that the total loss to banks
in Switzerland could run into the billions of francs (dollars),
but Swiss authorities said they were unable to say how much was
at stake.
</P>
<P>
Madoff, a former chairman of Nasdaq stock market, was arrested
Thursday in New York hours after the collapse of Bernard L.
Madoff Investment Securities LLC. He has been accused by U.S.
authorities of running a phony investment business that lost at
least $50 billion.
