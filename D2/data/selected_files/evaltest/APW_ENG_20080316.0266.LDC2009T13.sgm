Crane collapses on NYC apartment buildings; 4 dead, 10 hurt

NEW YORK 2008-03-16 04:52:33 UTC
</P>
<P>
Rescue crews worked through the night into Sunday morning sifting
through piles of rubble in search of survivors after a towering
crane at a construction site toppled like a tree across a city
block, destroying buildings and killing at least four people.
</P>
<P>
Mayor Michael Bloomberg said at least 10 people were injured in
what he called one of New York City's worst construction
accidents. The dead were all believed to be construction workers.
</P>
<P>
"It is a tragic event," Bloomberg said, adding, "Our hearts go
out to all the victims and their families."
</P>
<P>
The crane split into pieces as it fell Saturday afternoon,
pulverizing a four-story town house and demolishing parts of five
other buildings. The collapse devastated the affluent block on
Manhattan's East Side: Cars were overturned and crushed. A huge
dust cloud rose over the neighborhood. Rubble was piled several
stories high. Several blocks remained blocked off through the
night and some residents were forced to stay at a nearby high
school serving as a Red Cross shelter.
</P>
<P>
Carolyn Cempa was at lunch with her husband when the accident
happened. They went to the Red Cross shelter to get information
on when they could return home and how badly their building had
been damaged. She said she has heart medicine in her apartment
that she badly needs.
</P>
<P>
"The fireman came over and said it's not safe, maybe tomorrow,"
she said. "That's not good."
</P>
<P>
Fire Commissioner Nicholas Scoppetta said the intensive rescue
operation would continue all night to find anyone possibly
trapped in the rubble on 51st Street near 2nd Avenue. One man was
pulled from a brownstone 3 1/2 hours after the building was
crushed, but no one else was reported found.
</P>
<P>
Rescue crews were using search dogs, thermal-imaging cameras and
listening devices. Two other large cranes were brought in to lift
debris.
</P>
<P>
He called the work "painstaking," and said rubble was being
removed carefully, sometimes by hand, to prevent further
collapse.
</P>
<P>
The big, white crane stood at least 19 stories high and had been
attached to the side of a half-built high rise. When it toppled
from its base on the sidewalk, part of it landed on a four-story
brownstone, and turned it into a pile of brick.
</P>
<P>
"It's a horrible situation, very gory. There's blood in the
street," said Lt. Gov. David Paterson, who takes over as governor
for disgraced Eliot Spitzer on Monday.
</P>
<P>
But residents said they were grateful the accident occurred on a
weekend when the area was not full of people.
</P>
<P>
John LaGreco, who owned a tavern called Fubar that was closed
when the brownstone was destroyed, said his employee, Juan Perez,
was the man pulled from the rubble. He said Perez suffered a
broken leg. All of his employees were accounted for.
</P>
<P>
"Our bar is done," he said. "The crane crashed the whole
building. If I wasn't watching a Yankees game, I would've come to
work early and gotten killed."
</P>
<P>
About 19 of the planned 43-story condominium had been erected,
and the crane was scheduled to be extended Saturday so workers
could start work on a fresh story, said an owner of the company
that manages the construction site.
</P>
<P>
A piece of steel fell and sheared off one of the ties holding it
to the building, causing it to detach and topple, said Stephen
Kaplan, an owner of the Reliance Construction Group.
</P>
<P>
"It was an absolute freak accident," Kaplan said. "All the piece
of steel had to do was fall slightly left or right, and nothing
would have happened."
</P>
<P>
Kaplan said the company had subcontracted the work to different
companies and was not in charge of the crane. Phone messages and
an e-mail left for the crane's owner, New York Crane &amp;
Equipment Corp., were not returned.
</P>
<P>
James Kennelly, the lead partner at East 51st Development
Company, which owns the property, issued a written statement
expressing the group's dismay over the accident.
</P>
<P>
"There are no words to describe the level of devastation we feel
today as a result of this tragic event," he said, extending
prayers to the families of the dead and injured.
</P>
<P>
Neighborhood residents said they had complained to the city
several times about the construction at the site, saying crews
worked illegal hours and the building was going up too fast.
</P>
<P>
City officials said they had issued 13 violations to the site in
the last 27 months, a normal amount for a project of that size.
Inspectors examined the crane Friday and found nothing wrong with
it.
</P>
<P>
City Building Department records showed that on March 4, a caller
told officials that the upper portions of the crane appeared to
lack the proper number of safety ties attaching it to the
building.
</P>
<P>
A city inspector visited the site and determined on March 6 that
no violation was warranted.
</P>
<P>
The collapse comes amid a building boom in New York City and
follows a spate of construction accidents in recent months,
including some involving cranes.
</P>
<P>
New York Crane was involved in a 2006 mishap, in which a 13-foot
(4-meter) piece of a crane mast that was being dismantled fell
into the street and crushed a taxi cab.
</P>
<P>
At a Donald Trump hotel-condominium tower, a worker plummeted 40
stories to his death last month when a concrete form gave way. A
month before that, a crane's nylon sling broke away and dropped
seven tons of steel onto a construction trailer across from
ground zero, injuring an architect.
