More Sleep Means More Athletic Success, Study Finds

Getting a good night's sleep has its rewards, such as reduced
fatigue and better concentration. For athletes, the benefits may
be even bigger -- faster speed and improved performance.
</P>
<P>
Those are the findings from a recent, albeit small study in which
college basketball players fared better on sprints and free
throws after sleeping more than they normally did.
</P>

``Athletes understand how important training is, and nutrition,
but there's a third component that makes a big difference in how
they perform -- sleep,'' says Cheri Mah, lead author of the study
presented last week at the Associated Professional Sleep
Societies' meeting in Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
Mah, a researcher at the Stanford Sleep Disorders Clinic and
Research Laboratory, says athletes often aren't counseled on the
value of adequate sleep, adding that college students are no
strangers to sleep deprivation, sometimes maxing out at five or
six hours of sleep a night. That's far below the 91/2 to 10 hours
recommended by sleep experts for adolescents and young adults.
</P>
<P>
The study followed six Stanford basketball players, ages 18 to
21, during their 2006 playing season. For two weeks they followed
normal sleep patterns, then they were told to sleep as much as
they could for six weeks, with a goal of 10 hours a night, and to
maintain a regular sleeping and waking schedule. During both
phases, the players were tested several times a week on sprints
and free throws after team practice.
</P>
<P>
Sprint times improved by a second by the end of the study (16.3
compared with 15.3 on a 282-foot sprint). Free throws averaged
7.9 (out of 10) during the regular sleep period, versus 8.8 at
the end. Three-point shots picked up as well, averaging 9.2 (out
of 15) during regular sleep and 11 upon completion.
</P>
<P>
Mah says that since the study began in the middle of the season,
``there shouldn't be a learning curve from the baseline'' that
would greatly affect the results.
</P>
<P>
The athletes were also given standard subjective written tests
that measured mood and fatigue; after sleeping more, they
reported increased energy and improved mood.
</P>
<P>
``I think the sleep debt is the biggest factor that's weighing
down these athletes,'' Mah says. ``When they're in season, they
believe they're doing well, but they don't realize how much
better they'd be if they reduced their sleep debt. A lot of
athletes think that fatigue is normal.''
</P>
<P>
A previous study on sleep deprivation published in 1999 in the
Lancet found that less sleep resulted in impaired glucose
metabolism, which affects how the body stores and processes
glucose for energy.
</P>
<P>
Even for the weekend basketball player, more sleep could result
in better games, says Mah: ``Getting a little extra sleep will
give you that little bit more.''
