SEOUL, South Korea 2007-12-07 06:01:38 UTC

A crane-carrying vessel slammed into a Hong Kong-registered oil
tanker in seas off South Korea's west coast Friday causing the
tanker to leak about 110,000 barrels of crude oil, the Maritime
and Fisheries Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The collision at around 7:30 a.m. (1630 GMT Thursday) left holes
in three containers aboard the 146,000-ton tanker Hebei Spirit,
leading to what was believed to South Korea's largest offshore
oil leak, a ministry official said on customary condition of
anonymity citing office policy.
</P>
<P>
He said the leaked oil was about 15,000 tons or about 110,000
barrels -- which is equivalent to 17.4 million liters (4.6
million gallons).
</P>
<P>
Another ministry official said that spills from two containers
were stopped about three hours after the collision, but oil was
still leaking from the third container.
</P>
<P>
The official, who also did not give his name, said the amount of
the spilled oil could change.
</P>
<P>
YTN, a 24-hour cable news channel, said that the leaked oil
amounted to 8,000 tons without saying where the figure came from.
It showed footage of the black oil gushing out of the ship and
into the ocean.
</P>
<P>
There were no human casualties in the accident. The extent of its
potential damage to communities or wildlife in the area was not
immediately clear, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The tanker was at anchor about 8 kilometers (5 miles) off Mallipo
beach, about 150 kilometers (93 miles) southwest of Seoul,
carrying about 260,000 tons of crude oil -- or about 1.8 million
barrels -- when it was hit by another vessel that was carrying a
crane, the first ministry official said.
</P>
<P>
The previously largest oil spill in South Korea happened in 1995
when about 5,035 tons of crude and fuel oil was leaked, according
to South Korea's Yonhap news agency.
</P>
<P>
In 1989, the Exxon Valdez supertanker released about 260,000
barrels, or 11 million gallons of oil into Alaska's Prince
William Sound in what turned into a major environmental disaster.
