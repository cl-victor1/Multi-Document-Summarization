<P>
The United States said Friday it was unaware of any international
involvement in a rocket attack on the U.S. Embassy in Greece, but
the investigation was in its early stages.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said U.S. and Greek
authorities were cooperating "to determine who's responsible for
it and deal with them appropriately within the judicial system."
</P>
<P>
Greek authorities have said the attack probably was carried out
by a domestic terror group.
</P>
<P>
When asked about that possibility, McCormack said: "We all know
from history that there are a number of these anarchist groups in
Greece, and that they are sometimes violent. I can't tell you if
one of those is responsible for this particular attack."
</P>
<P>
A small anti-tank missile pierced the building above the front
entrance early Friday morning. McCormack said nobody was injured,
and damage was minimal.
</P>
<P>
Greek Foreign Minister Dora Bakoyannis has visited U.S.
Ambassador Charles Ries, McCormack said, and Secretary of State
Condoleezza Rice called the ambassador for a briefing.
</P>
<P>
The embassy is set back 65 feet from the street. McCormack said
the safety of U.S. embassies is "something that we take
seriously."
