Thousands evacuate as cyclone approaches Bangladesh, India

Thousands of people in the path of a cyclone were evacuated from
coastal areas as forecasters warned the storm could hit land in
Bangladesh or neighbouring India later Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Volunteers using microphones urged villagers in south and
southeastern Bangladesh to take shelter in the country's network
of cyclone shelters.
</P>
<P>
Officials also travelled by speedboat to islands to warn
residents to evacuate, officials said.

"We started evacuating people from vulnerable coastal areas and
our volunteers are using microphones asking people to take
shelter in cyclone shelters," said Asraf Shameen, administrative
chief of southeastern Chittagong district.

Tropical Cyclone Sidr, hovering over the Bay of Bengal, was
moving towards Bangladesh's southern coastal districts, on the
border with India, and likely to hit land later Thursday, said
Bazlur Rashid of the Bangladesh weather department.

<P>
Chittagong airport and sea port were also closed, officials said.

In 1970, some half a million people died when a cyclone hit the
impoverished country, while an estimated 138,000 people died as a
result of a cyclonic tidal wave in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The lower death toll in 1991 was attributed to a network of
cyclone shelters and a warning system introduced after the 1970
disaster.
