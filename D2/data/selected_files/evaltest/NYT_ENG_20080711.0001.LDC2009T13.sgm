LAWYER: UPBRINGING WARPED ALVAREZ
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES
</P>
<P>
Relatives of the man convicted of murdering 11 Metrolink
passengers in a Glendale train derailment said Thursday that he
was the product of a violent family that exposed him to incest,
rape, substance abuse and drug trafficking over two generations.
</P>
<P>
Juan Manuel Alvarez's mother, Leticia Ayala, told a jury that he
was an unwanted pregnancy and that she had tried, but failed, to
abort her unborn son using folk-medicine brews of herbs and
leaves as well as traditional medications.
</P>
<P>
The nine women and three men on the jury will decide whether the
29-year-old Compton handyman will get the death penalty or spend
the rest of his life in prison.
</P>
<P>
The testimony of family members came on the first day of closing
arguments for Alvarez's defense team. The sentencing phase of the
trial follows his conviction last month on 11 counts of first-
degree murder.
</P>
<P>
"Before you sentence the man, you take into account not just the
offense, you take into account the man," court-appointed lead
defense lawyer Michael Belter told jurors at the outset of his
closing argument.
</P>
<P>
Jurors did not seem as moved emotionally as they were during the
prosecution's presentation of testimony from family and friends
of the victims of the Jan. 26, 2005, Metrolink train derailment.
But they were visibly gripped by the accounts of sexual
molestation, beatings, emotional abuse and abject family life
described by the defense and family members.
</P>
<P>
Belter asked jurors to recommend life in prison without the
possibility of parole for Alvarez, while acknowledging the
gravity of his client's deadly actions that irrevocably
devastated the victims' families.
</P>
<P>
"We are not here to offer any excuses or justifications," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The testimony given Thursday presented a tragic family from the
border town of Mexicali, where the seeds of Alvarez's violence
can be traced. There, the Juan Alvarez Sr. family carried out
unspeakable acts of extreme machismo and dominance over loved
ones.
</P>
<P>
From the time he was a child, Alvarez was mercilessly beaten for
no apparent reason by his father, using fists, belts and
electrical cords, several relatives testified.
</P>
<P>
As children, Alvarez, his sister and others in the family were
sexually molested by an uncle, relatives said on the witness
stand. Alvarez's cousin, Otilia Guevara, testified that the same
uncle raped her often, even while she visited her grandmother and
with the knowledge of her grandmother and several family members.
</P>
<P>
And in the most emotional testimony of the day, Alvarez's mother
spoke tearfully about being a battered wife for more than two
decades at the hands of an alcoholic, drug-addicted husband whose
beatings caused the miscarriage of one of her unborn children.
</P>
<P>
And no one protested or reported the crimes.
</P>
<P>
"This was Mexico," Ayala said through a translator.
</P>
<P>
Even after her husband abandoned her and her young daughter,
Ayala said, she crossed the border from Mexico into the United
States illegally on foot -- five months pregnant with Juan -- to
be near the man who regularly physically abused her. She said she
tried to abort her unborn son in Mexico prior to her U.S.
journey.
</P>
<P>
When her husband was deported, Ayala said, she followed him back
to Mexico with young Juan, who had been born in the U.S. In
Mexicali, the battering continued and it took its toll on Juan to
the point that his reticence to communicate led some teachers to
believe he was a deaf-mute.
</P>
<P>
Young Alvarez, loved ones testified, was withdrawn and quiet --
possibly from the physical abuse, to which relatives said he had
grown so accustomed that he no longer cried.
</P>
<P>
"He would never cry," said his mother.
</P>
<P>
"Never?" asked her son's lawyer.
</P>
<P>
"Never."
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors challenged parts of the testimony of Alvarez's family
members, except for his mother, whom they chose not to cross-
examine.
</P>
<P>
Less moving were the testimony of Alvarez's older cousin Beto
Alvarez, who now is helping raise Juan's son and his adopted
daughter, and his estranged wife, Carmen, the woman prosecutors
say Alvarez was attempting to impress and win back when he caused
the disaster in which a Metrolink train derailed and smashed into
another commuter train.
</P>
<P>
Carmen Alvarez told jurors she is now involved in another
romantic relationship and plans to move on with her life.
</P>
<P>
Moments before she took the stand, Alvarez had turned to look at
her and smiled -- his only show of emotion to any of his loved
ones.
</P>
<P>
Beto Alvarez was on the stand as defense lawyers introduced a
message recorded on his home answering machine just minutes after
Juan caused the derailment and carnage.
</P>
<P>
"I didn't mean to do this, Beto," Juan Alvarez said in the
message. "A lot of innocent people died. I don't deserve to live,
Beto. I apologize for everything. Please pray for me."
