WASHINGTON, Dec. 6 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
The shocking shooting rampage in a shopping mall in Omaha, Neb.
on Wednesday "deeply saddened" U.S. President George W. Bush, and
details of the tragic incident were revealed on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The president is deeply saddened by the shootings in Omaha,"
White House press secretary Dana Perino said Thursday. "His
thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
President Bush had visited Omaha on Wednesday before the
shooting.
</P>
<P>
The police revealed on Thursday more details of the shooting
rampage, in which a young man shot dead 8 people before killing
himself.
</P>
<P>
Thomas Warren, Omaha's police chief, told reporters that Robert
A. Hawkins, 19, of Bellevue, Neb., came into the store and looked
around before leaving and returning with an assault rifle to open
fire.
</P>
<P>
Mall security officers noticed Hawkins briefly enter the Von Maur
department store at Omaha's Westroads Mall earlier Wednesday, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Hawkins left the store and returned six minutes later concealing
something -- presumably the AK-47 assault rifle used in the
rampage -- under a hooded sweatshirt, Warren said.
</P>
<P>
The young man then turned right, took an elevator to the third
floor and immediately started shooting in the store's customer
service area.
</P>
<P>
Six store employees and two customers were fatally wounded before
Hawkins turned the gun on himself.
</P>
<P>
The five women and three men who died ranged in age from 24 to
66, he said.
</P>
<P>
Five other people were injured, and two of them were in critical
condition, hospital officials said.
</P>
<P>
Nebraska Gov. Dave Heineman ordered that flags throughout the
state be lowered to half-staff through Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The mall was expected to remain closed at least through Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Jim Von Maur, who owns the department store where the shooting
occurred, said grief counseling would be provided for employees
and their families.
</P>
<P>
Warren said Hawkins apparently chose his victims randomly and
spoke little or not at all while firing about 30 rounds.
</P>
<P>
Hawkins lived with a friend's family. The mother, Debra Maruca
Kovac, said she found a suicide note after getting a phone call
from Hawkins about 1 p.m., just minutes before the shootings.
</P>
<P>
"He basically said how sorry he was for everything," Kovac said
of the note.
</P>
<P>
"He didn't want to be a burden to people and that he was a piece
of shit --- all of his life and that now he'd be famous," she
said.
</P>
<P>
CNN said U.S. army recruiters turned Hawkins down last summer
when he tried to enlist.
</P>
<P>
Two recruiters said Hawkins seemed like an average teenager who
said he wanted to leave Omaha and take his life in a different
direction.
</P>
<P>
"He said he'd had a rough time in his life and wanted to see
about changing it," said Army Sgt. Edward Dust.
