Murder defendant apologizes for causing Southern California
commuter rail derailment deaths

<P>
A murder defendant apologized Tuesday for causing a commuter
train disaster that killed 11 people, testifying that he was
trying to kill himself and never meant to harm anyone else.
</P>
<P>
On the witness stand, Juan Alvarez, 29, asked for forgiveness
from families of those killed in the January 2005 disaster
involving two Metrolink trains. Some relatives of the dead were
present as Alvarez testified.
</P>
<P>
Alvarez said he poured gas over himself and his Jeep, took out a
lighter and then decided he did not want to burn himself to death
because it would be too painful. He said he then drove onto
railroad tracks northeast of Los Angeles in Glendale, hoping a
train would smash into his vehicle and kill him quickly.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors allege that Alvarez had made not a suicide attempt,
but a bid for attention from his wife. He had fled the Jeep by
the time a Metrolink train hit the vehicle, then struck a parked
freight train and was struck by another Metrolink train going the
other way. About 180 people were injured.
</P>
<P>
Alvarez has pleaded not guilty to 11 counts of murder and one
count of arson. He could face the death penalty if convicted.
</P>
<P>
Alvarez said after he decided not to kill himself, he tried but
could not move the sport utility vehicle. He said he saw the
train's bright lights before jumping out of the vehicle.
</P>
<P>
"I feel terrible and I ask for forgiveness," Alvarez said. "I
know some of the family members are here today. I'm very sorry
for what happened. I never meant to hurt any of your loved ones.
That could have been my mom or dad."
</P>
<P>
Alvarez said several times that he did not think anyone else
would be hurt and had no idea that the train could derail.
</P>
<P>
Alvarez testified he had made other suicide attempts, once laying
down on a road waiting for a car to run over him and twice
stabbing himself.
</P>
<P>
Deputy District Attorney Cathryn Brougham said in opening
statements last month that Alvarez had threatened to kill his
wife and staged the accident to get her attention. She said he
succeeded because after he was jailed on murder charges his wife
withdrew a restraining order and visited him regularly.
