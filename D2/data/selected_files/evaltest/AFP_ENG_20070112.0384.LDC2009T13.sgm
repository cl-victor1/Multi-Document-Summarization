US unaware of any international link to Athens embassy attack
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The US State Department said it was unaware of any international
links to a rocket-propelled grenade attack on the US embassy in
Athens early Friday which caused no injuries.
</P>
<P>
Greek police said a far-left group, Revolutionary Struggle, had
claimed responsibility for the attack.
</P>
<P>
"We all know from history that there are a number of these
anarchist groups in Greece and that they are sometimes violent,"
State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said.
</P>
<P>
"I can't say if one of those is repsonsible for this particular
attack," he said, but added that he was "unaware of" any link
with international terrorist groups.
</P>
<P>
"We're cooperating well with Greek authorities to determine who's
responsible for it and deal with them appropriately within the
judicial system once they're found," he said.
</P>
<P>
McCormack said US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice called US
Ambassador Charles Ries earlier in the day and that Greece's
foreign minister, Dora Bakoyannis, met with Ries shortly after
the attack.
</P>
<P>
"We've been getting great cooperation from Greek authorities,"
McCormack said.
