One of Michael Vick's co-defendants pleaded guilty Monday to
federal dogfighting conspiracy charges in a plea agreement with
prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
Tony Taylor, 34, who will be sentenced Dec. 14, said he was not
promised any specific sentence in return for his cooperation with
the government.
</P>
<P>
Taylor entered his plea in U.S. District Court to conspiracy to
travel in interstate commerce in aid of unlawful activities, and
conspiring to sponsor a dog in an animal fighting venture.
</P>
<P>
Vick, the star quarterback for the Atlanta Falcons, and two other
co-defendants pleaded not guilty last week to similar charges.
</P>
<P>
The offenses carry a maximum punishment of five years in prison
and fines of up to $250,000.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors claimed in a July 17 indictment that Taylor found the
Surry County property that Vick purchased and used as the site of
"Bad Newz Kennels," a dogfighting enterprise. Taylor also
allegedly helped purchase pit bulls and killed at least two dogs
that fared poorly in test fights.
</P>
<P>
According to the 18-page indictment, the dogfighting ring
executed underperforming dogs by drowning, hanging and other
brutal means. It alleges that the fights offered purses as high
as $26,000.
</P>
<P>
The grisly details outlined in the indictment have fueled
protests and public outrage against Vick. NFL commissioner Roger
Goodell has banned Vick from the Falcons' training camp while the
league investigates.
</P>
<P>
Vick and Purnell A. Peace, 35, and Quanis L. Phillips, 28, are
scheduled for trial Nov. 26. They remain free without bond.
