<P>
Hundreds of endangered sea turtles have been found dead along
Bangladesh's coast over the past two weeks, triggering concerns
about pollution and local fishing practices, an official said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A team of four scientists has launched an investigation into the
deaths of the olive ridley turtles, said Jafar Ahmed, a top
official in the government's marine fisheries department.
</P>
<P>
At least 65 of the sea turtles -- ranging from 40 to 60 kilograms
(88 to 132 pounds) -- have been found dead along a five-kilometer
(three-mile) stretch of beach near Cox's Bazar, one of the main
cities on Bangladesh's coast. Hundreds more dead turtles have
been found elsewhere in the area, and on a pair of islands. There
is no clear total of exactly how many turtles have died.
</P>
<P>
Olive ridleys, the smallest of all sea turtles, are endangered.
They often come ashore at this time of year to lay eggs, Ahmed
said.
</P>
<P>
There have been reports of turtle deaths before, but not as many
as this year, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ahmed would not give any specific reason for the spike in deaths,
but said the use of illegal fishing nets near the shoreline has
apparently increased recently. The fishermen do not properly
release the turtles and often kill them, leaving them to wash
ashore, he said.
</P>
<P>
Other turtles that come to lay eggs on the beaches may be killed
by pollution, stray dogs or foxes, or captured by tourists, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Mohammad Aminul Islam, the top administrator for the area,
ordered local officials to teach people, from fishermen to
tourists, to change their behavior.
</P>
<P>
"It's really sad that we couldn't protect the turtles," he said.
"We are trying to mobilize resources to make a bigger plan to
save the sea turtles in the future."
