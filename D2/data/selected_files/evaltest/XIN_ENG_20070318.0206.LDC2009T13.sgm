Canada pet-food supplier recalls product after U.S. pets death

OTTAWA, March 18 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
A Canadian pet-food supplier recalled some of its dog and cat
food Sunday after several pets in the United States died, local
media reported.
</P>
<P>
Menu Foods, one of North America's largest suppliers of pet food,
is recalling dog food sold throughout North America under 48
brands and cat food sold under 40 brands including Iams, Nutro
and Eukanuba, a report by Canadian Press said.
</P>
<P>
The recall follows complaints that one dog and several cats in
the United States died of kidney failure after eating the foods.
</P>
<P>
Paul Henderson, the CEO of the Toronto-area company, says it is
not clear what the problem is and the recall is precautionary.
</P>
<P>
"We've undertaken a battery of technical tests ... and all of
those tests have failed to identify any issues at all with our
product," he said.
</P>
<P>
Company spokesperson Sarah Tuite has said the recalled products
were made using wheat gluten purchased from a new supplier, which
has since been dropped for another source. Wheat gluten is a
source of protein.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Food and Drug Administration spokesperson Julie Zawisza said
it is still too early to determine what could have affected the
food. She said that even if wheat gluten is the source, it could
be another substance associated with the wheat gluten.
</P>
<P>
Menu Foods said it has beefed up the testing of all raw materials
and finished goods.
