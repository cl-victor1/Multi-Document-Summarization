Row stalls new gas pipe near Indonesian 'mud volcano'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Indonesia's state-owned gas company Pertamina has halted
construction of a gas pipeline replacing one which burst in a
deadly explosion because compensation has not been agreed, a
report said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Thirteen people were killed in the November explosion when the
underground pipeline in East Java ruptured following subsidence
around a nearby gas well that has been spewing mud since May
2006, inundating villages and forcing more than 13,000 people to
flee their homes.
</P>
<P>
Pertamina spokesman Toharso said residents in the district had
objected to construction of a new three-kilometre (two-mile)
pipeline parallel to the old one as compensation for the land had
not been agreed.
</P>
<P>
"We have started the construction of 1.6 kilometres of the three-
kilometre pipe but we cannot finish it," he told the official
Antara news agency.
</P>
<P>
"Residents reject the route we are using because the land
settlements have not been agreed," said Toharso.
</P>
<P>
A change in the route would shorten the pipe but bring it closer
to the danger zone around the "mud volcano," he said.
</P>
<P>
Pertamina also has to wait for construction of an 800-metre long
dyke to protect the pipeline, which was expected to be completed
in February.
</P>
<P>
A system of dykes is holding back the steaming mud, which is
bubbling up at a rate of up to 150,000 cubic metres  (5.25
million cubic feet) a day.
</P>
<P>
Experts have been working to channel the mud into the nearby sea.
</P>
<P>
An Indonesian minister, Aburizal Bakrie, claimed last month the
flow was a "natural disaster" unrelated to the drilling
activities of a company, Lapindo Brantas Inc, which belongs to a
group controlled by his family.
</P>
<P>
However, a study by British experts said that the eruption was
most likely caused by drilling for gas.
</P>
<P>
President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono has ordered Lapindo to pay 3.8
trillion rupiah (420 million dollars) in compensation and costs
related to the mud flow.
