Studies confirm circumcision significantly reduces chances of HIV
infection

Scientists say conclusive data shows there is no question
circumcision reduces men's chances of catching HIV by up to 60
percent -- a finding experts are hailing as a major breakthrough
in the fight against AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Now, the question is how to put that fact to work to combat AIDS
across Africa.
</P>
<P>
The findings first were announced in December, when initial
results from two major trials -- in Kenya and Uganda -- showed
promising links between circumcision and HIV transmission.
However, those trials were deemed so definitive that the tests
were halted early.
</P>
<P>
The results were confirmed by further tests carried out by the
United States' National Institutes of Health and published Friday
in The Lancet.
</P>
<P>
"This is an extraordinary development," said Dr. Kevin de Cock,
director of the World Health Organization's AIDS department.
"Circumcision is the most potent intervention in HIV prevention
that has been described."
</P>
<P>
Circumcision has long been suspected of reducing men's
susceptibility to HIV infection because the cells in the foreskin
of the penis are especially vulnerable to the virus.
</P>
<P>
Now, a modeling study projects that in the next decade, male
circumcision could prevent 2 million AIDS infections and 300,000
deaths. Last year, 2.8 million people in sub-Saharan Africa
became infected with HIV, and 2.1 million people died.
</P>
<P>
Experts say the breakthrough is a significant one on par with the
identification of the virus and the use of lifesaving combination
drug therapy.
</P>
<P>
The two U.S. studies confirm similar results from an earlier
trial in South Africa. Given the recent failure of a microbicide
trial in Africa and India, and the ongoing difficulties in
developing an AIDS vaccine, the potential of circumcision as a
new weapon against HIV has become even more significant.
</P>
<P>
But they caution solid evidence is not justification for mass
circumcisions.
</P>
<P>
African health systems are already overburdened. Circumcision
requires much more planning than, for example, an immunization
campaign.
</P>
<P>
"It's a tricky one, but it's something we're going to have to
move on," said Dr. Catherine Hankins, a scientific adviser at
UNAIDS.
</P>
<P>
"Male circumcision is such a sensitive religious and cultural
issue that we need to be careful," she said.
</P>
<P>
Several African countries have already met with U.N. agencies to
explore new strategies for increasing circumcision services.
Swaziland, for instance, recently experimented with a series of
"Circumcision Saturdays," where existing health care facilities,
normally closed on weekends, were opened by local doctors to
circumcise approximately 40 men a day on certain Saturdays.
</P>
<P>
Providing circumcisions across Africa would not be the first time
surgical procedures have been adopted by public health campaigns.
</P>
<P>
"Cataract surgeries have been carried out extremely efficiently
to prevent blindness worldwide," said Dr. Richard Hayes, an AIDS
expert at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. In
some places, the cataract surgeries are performed by trained
paramedics.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the fight against the AIDS pandemic has focused
on the provision of lifesaving drugs. The circumcision data gives
prevention, rather than treatment, renewed emphasis.
</P>
<P>
"Treating people with antiretrovirals is completely unsustainable
unless we can turn off the tap of infection," said Hayes.
</P>
<P>
While circumcision may offer new hope, it is not a cure for the
epidemic.
</P>
<P>
"This is an additional tool, and it must not replace other
interventions," said de Cock, who added that there will be no
push for universal circumcision. "There is no one size fits all
solution for AIDS."
</P>
<P>
Together with the United Nations AIDS agency, WHO is convening a
meeting in Switzerland in early March to evaluate the
circumcision data, and to decide on the next steps in slowing the
AIDS pandemic.
</P>
<P>
In the Kenyan study, 1,391 circumcised men were compared to 1,393
who were not. And in Uganda, 2,474 circumcised men were compared
to 2,522 men who were not. After tracking the men for two years,
scientists found that circumcised men were 51 to 60 percent less
likely to contract HIV than their uncircumcised counterparts.
Since the studies were stopped, all the men have been offered the
opportunity to be circumcised. And all the men were warned not to
lapse into sexually risky behavior, such as abandoning condom
use.
</P>
<P>
Scientists theorize that women would benefit indirectly from
lower HIV prevalence in men, and a study is currently ongoing in
Uganda to determine this.
</P>
<P>
In areas where HIV is spread primarily through heterosexual sex,
such as sub-Saharan Africa, male circumcision could theoretically
slash the infection rate in half.
</P>
<P>
It is unknown whether circumcision would be equally effective in
concentrated AIDS epidemics, as in Asia and eastern Europe, where
AIDS primarily strikes gay men and drug users.
