British research shows herpes drug helps control HIV

LONDON, Feb. 22 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
A study carried out by British researchers has revealed that a
drug designed to combat genital herpes can reduce levels of HIV
in the blood by 70 percent and also appears to reduce levels of
HIV in the genital tract.
</P>
<P>
Researchers of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical
Medicine, UK, had the findings after having carried out a small
trial in Africa, New Scientist reported Thursday on its website.
</P>
<P>
The researchers led by Philippe Mayaud recruited 140 women
infected with both HIV and herpes in the West African nation of
Burkina Faso and gave half of the women valacyclovir and the
other half women placebo pills for three months.
</P>
<P>
The researchers found that copies of HIV in those who received
valacyclovir had dropped from 25,000 copies per milliliter of
blood to 8,000 per milliliter - a 70 percent reduction and levels
of HIV found in the blood of women who received the placebo, by
comparison, had increased slightly on average.
</P>
<P>
The women who received valacyclovir also had half as many copies
of HIV in their genital tracts compared to those who received the
placebo, suggesting that valacyclovir has the potential to reduce
the spread of HIV, Mayaud said.
</P>
<P>
This is the same effect one would expect if the women had been
given an anti-HIV drug such as Zidovudine (AZT), according to
Mayaud.
</P>
<P>
The herpes medication, valacyclovir, and other herpes drugs,
might dramatically reduce the spread of HIV, according to the
researchers.
</P>
<P>
Researchers believe that valacyclovir indirectly reduces HIV
infection by decreasing copies of the herpes virus and note that
untreated herpes can cause lesions in the genital region, which
subsequently attract a type of immune cell that harbors HIV.
</P>
<P>
Mayaud stressed the need for long-term studies of valacyclovir' s
effect on HIV infection.
