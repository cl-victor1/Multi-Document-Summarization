A man who laid siege to a one-room Amish schoolhouse, killing five
girls, told his wife shortly before opening fire that he had molested
two young girls who were his relatives decades ago and was tormented
by "dreams of molesting again," authorities said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Charles Carl Roberts IV may have planned to molest the girls at the
Amish school, but police have no evidence that he actually did, State
Police Commissioner Jeffrey B. Miller said.

<P>
He said Roberts had sexual lubricant and flex-tie plastic handcuffs
with him with he took the students hostage, and that he chained the
girls together in a line at the blackboard after sending the boys and
adults away. Roberts also had the weapons and supplies for long stand-
off, he said.

"He states in his suicide note that he had dreams about doing what he
did 20 years ago again," Miller said. Roberts was 32 when he killed
himself Monday, authorities said,

<P>
Miller said police could not confirm Roberts IV's claim about
molesting young relatives when Roberts would have been a just a child
or adolescent himself, and he said Roberts' family members knew
nothing of molestation in his past.

Roberts left one note for his wife, one for each of his three children
and a note and checklist in his truck, Miller said. The note to his
wife talked about his anguish over the loss of the couple's newborn
daughter, Elise, in 1997, Miller said.
</P>
<P>
"The note that he left for his wife talks about the good memories
together, the tragedy with Elise, it focuses on his life being changed
forever ... over the loss of Elise, his hatred toward himself, his
hatred towards God as a result of that event, and he alludes to this
other reason for this anger but he can't discuss it with her and it
happened 20 years ago," Miller said. "Later in the note he talks about
having dreams in for the last couple of years about what he did 20
years ago and in those dreams he says he wants to do those things
again."

<P>
When his wife spoke with Roberts by cell phone from inside the school
before the shooting started, he "told her he had molested two minor
relatives 20 years prior and that was how she put all of that
together," Miller said.
