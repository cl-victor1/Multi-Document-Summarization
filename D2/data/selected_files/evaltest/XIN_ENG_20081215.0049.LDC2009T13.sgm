Iraqi reporter throws shoe at Bush in Baghdad

BAGHDAD, Dec. 14 (Xinhua) -- An Iraqi reporter threw his shoes at
visiting U.S. President George W. Bush and called him a "dog" in
Arabic during a news conference with Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri
al-Maliki in Baghdad on Sunday.

<P>
Muntadhar al-Zaidi, reporter of Baghdadiya television jumped and
threw his two shoes one by one at the president, who ducked and
thus narrowly missed being struck, raising chaos in the hall in
Baghdad's heavily fortified green Zone.
</P>
<P>
"This is a farewell kiss, dog," said Zaidi.
</P>
<P>
Several security members wrestled the man to the floor and then
dragged him out of the hall as he was screaming.
</P>
<P>
However, Bush tried to show himself calm and said "all I can
report is it is a size 10."
</P>
<P>
"I didn't feel the least threatened by it," Bush also said,
adding that "it doesn't bother me" before he and Maliki leave the
conference room.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Bush arrived Baghdad in an unannounced visit,
just 36 days before he leaves office in January.
