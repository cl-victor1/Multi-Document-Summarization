<P>
Police in western Japan arrested two brothers on Wednesday for
allegedly trying to import nearly three tons of ivory, a
violation under the international ban on the trade in elephant
tusks.
</P>
<P>
The arrest came as customs officials and police investigate 2,794
kilograms (3.07 U.S. tons) of ivory that was found in a cargo
container last year at Osaka's South Port, said Toshiro Otsuka,
an Osaka police official.
</P>
<P>
This was the largest amount of ivory ever seized in Japan, Kyodo
News agency said. Police are investigating whether a large-scale
smuggling ring was involved, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The two men were identified as the receivers of the cargo, Otsuka
said, adding that officials are investigating the origin of the
ivory shipment.
</P>
<P>
Trading ivory was banned under the 1989 Convention of
International Trade in Endangered Species to curb the slaughter
of elephants in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The suspects' names are Hiroyuki and Daisuke Tada, said Osaka
police official Seigo Yasui.
