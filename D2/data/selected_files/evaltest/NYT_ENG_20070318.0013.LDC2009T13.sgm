PET OWNERS SCRAMBLING FOR INFORMATION AMID NATIONAL RECALL OF
DOG, CAT FOOD
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Worried owners of dogs and cats in the Valley were scrambling
Saturday for more information on a national pet-food recall as
retailers pushed to remove the suspect items from their shelves.
</P>
<P>
Word of the recall went out across the country Friday. There were
reports of an unknown number of cats and dogs suffering kidney
failure and 10 pet deaths as Menu Foods of Toronto ordered a
recall of 60 million containers of wet dog and cat food.
</P>
<P>
One Valley dog owner said he had to euthanize his 3-year-old
Bernese mountain dog, Nikky, on Saturday after the family pet
fell ill early last week. Jeff Burnton of Phoenix said he heard
about the recall and found his dog's food on the list.
</P>
<P>
Burnton said a veterinarian found Nikky showed symptoms of being
poisoned. It's suspected that the food made an otherwise healthy
dog suddenly ill. By Saturday, the dog was suffering severe
convulsions and couldn't be saved, Burnton said.
</P>
<P>
"I know there's a big issue between human life and animal life,
but they become a part of your family," he said. "There were a
lot of tears. It was very hard."
</P>
<P>
The recall covers "cuts and gravy"-style pet food that comes in
cans and pouches. The affected food was sold between Dec. 3 and
March 6 in the United States, Canada and Mexico. Dry food is not
affected.
</P>
<P>
Menu Foods said it launched the North American recall as a
precaution after receiving complaints about sick dogs and cats.
The company has not pinpointed a specific reason why the food may
be contaminated but said the complaints popped up at the time it
began using a new ingredient from a supplier. The company no
longer uses that supplier.
</P>
<P>
Menu makes private-label pet food for 17 of the top 20 North
American retailers, including Kroger Co., Safeway and Wal-Mart
Stores and for pet superstores like Phoenix-based PetSmart. The
company also makes pet food under contract for branded pet- food
companies that sell prestige names like Science Diet and Iams.
</P>
<P>
PetSmart and one of its chief rivals, Petco, had employees
clearing the targeted food from its shelves Friday night and
Saturday morning. Valley shoppers noticed big gaps in the food
aisles of those stores, although both retailers said there were
similar choices still in stock. People who bought the recalled
food can receive refunds.
</P>
<P>
"Any retailer that sells pet foods is going to be touched by this
in some fashion," PetSmart spokesman Bruce Richardson said.
</P>
<P>
San Diego-based Petco has more than 25 stores in Arizona.
Spokesman Don Cowan said his company not only removed the items
targeted in the recall but everything manufactured by Menu Foods.
</P>
<P>
Both of the big chains have been getting calls from people
wanting more information. There doesn't appear to be a large
number of sick or dying animals. Local veterinary offices and
hospitals also have been hit with calls.
</P>
<P>
"People are just worried," said Meagan Kasticel-Upyro, a
technician at VCA Paradise Valley Emergency Animal Hospital.
"They don't know exactly which ones (brands). They just want to
know what's going on."
</P>
<P>
Burnton, the Phoenix man who had to put down his dog Saturday,
said he doesn't think enough is being done to make people aware
of the problem.
</P>
<P>
"I'm just flabbergasted," he said Saturday. "I had a healthy
Bernese mountain dog four days ago, and now she's dead today.
{ellipsis} It was unbelievable and shocking how quickly this
thing hits. My concern is that here in Arizona, people need to
make sure of what they are feeding their dogs."
