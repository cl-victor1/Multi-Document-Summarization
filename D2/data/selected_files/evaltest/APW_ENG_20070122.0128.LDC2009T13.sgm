Fisheries officials from around the world began discussing ways
to reverse a sharp decline in tuna catches as a five-day
conference kicked off Monday in Japan.
</P>
<P>
The conference, which brings together the world's regional tuna
management groups, is seen as a key step in combating the
downturn in one of the most valuable and endangered high seas
fisheries. The conference runs through Friday in the western port
city of Kobe.
</P>
<P>
Representatives, including the commercial fishing industry,
government regulators and environmental groups, plan to discuss
ways to strengthen information sharing and cooperation among
regional organizations to better manage tuna stock and adopt an
action plan, the Japanese Fisheries Agency said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Participants also seek to create a framework requiring fishermen
worldwide to produce certificates of origin for all species of
tuna they catch, and call for a monitoring system that would
track the tuna catch from the open sea to the fish market,
according to media reports.
</P>
<P>
This week's meeting is being hosted by Japan, one of the world's
biggest tuna consumers and a frequent target of conservationists
who accuse its fleets of overfishing. The tuna talks will for the
first time bring together the five so-called regional fishery
management organizations, including the oversight bodies for tuna
fishing in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans.
</P>
<P>
By 2004, the number of adult Atlantic bluefin tuna capable of
spawning had plummeted to roughly 19 percent of its 1975 level in
the western half of the ocean, according to the International
Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas.
</P>
<P>
Overfishing and poaching are often cited as the cause.
