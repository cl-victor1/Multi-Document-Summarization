ATHENS, Greece 2007-01-12 08:46:41 UTC

An anti-tank shell was fired at the U.S. embassy early Friday,
striking the front of the building but causing no injuries. A
senior police official said the blast was an act of terrorism,
raising fears of a resurgence of far-left Greek militant groups.
</P>
<P>
Public Order Minister Vyron Polydoras said Greece "strongly
condemns" the attack on the heavily guarded building. "We believe
it is a symbolic act," he said. "It is an attempt to disrupt our
country's international relations."
</P>
<P>
Police cordoned off streets around the building after the
explosion shortly before 6 a.m (0400 GMT). The shell struck the
third floor -- narrowly missing the embassy emblem -- and smashed
glass in nearby buildings.
</P>
<P>
Investigators were examining what they believed was the device
used to fire the shell from a construction site near the embassy.
</P>
<P>
"This is an act of terrorism. We don't know where from," Attica
Police Chief Asimakis Golfis said. "There was a shell that
exploded in the toilets of the building ... It was fired from
street level."
</P>
<P>
Embassy officials confirmed that an explosion had taken place and
said that no one had been injured. U.S. ambassador Charles Ries
said the damage was "not extensive."
</P>
<P>
"There can be no justification for such a senseless act of
violence. ... The embassy was occupied at the time (but) nobody
was hurt," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ries said there had been no warning of the attack.
</P>
<P>
"We're treating it as a very serious attack. We will determine
what it is when we know (more)," he said.
</P>
<P>
Greece's public order minister said police were examining the
authenticity of phone calls claiming responsibility on behalf of
a militant left-wing group.
</P>
<P>
"There are one or two telephone calls, from unknown callers, who
claimed that the Revolutionary Struggle assumes responsibility,"
Polydoras said.
</P>
<P>
He said the calls were made to a private security company.
</P>
<P>
Revolutionary Struggle claimed responsibility for a May 2006 bomb
attack on Culture Minister Giorgos Voulgarakis, in which nobody
was injured.
</P>
<P>
Authorities were searching apartment buildings near the U.S.
Embassy and a nearby hospital for evidence.
</P>
<P>
"At 5:58 a.m. an explosion was caused by a self-propelling shell,
causing minor damage at the front of the building. ... The Greek
Police are working closely with the embassy authorities," a
police statement said.
</P>
<P>
Greek Foreign Minister Dora Bakoyannis visited the embassy after
the blast.
</P>
<P>
"I came here to express the solidarity of the Greek people
following this deplorable action," she said.
</P>
<P>
"Such actions in the past have had a very heavy cost for the
country -- moral, financial and for the international standing of
the country. The Greek government is determined to undertake
every effort to not allow such phenomena to be repeated in the
future."
</P>
<P>
A U.S. State Department spokesman confirmed that the attack
caused no injuries.
</P>
<P>
"There are no injuries or casualties of any kind," Kurtis Cooper
said. "Police have responded. As a result the embassy will be
closed today, Friday."
</P>
<P>
Traffic came to a standstill for more than three hours across
parts of central Athens, as police and emergency services
scrambled to the embassy building, which is a frequent
destination for protest groups.
</P>
<P>
"I heard a loud bang. I didn't realize what was going on," said
Giorgos Yiannoulis, who runs a kiosk near the embassy.
</P>
<P>
It was the first major attack against a U.S. target in more than
a decade, following the arrest of members of Greece's far-left
November 17 terrorist group. The group was blamed for killing 23
people -- including U.S., British and Turkish officials -- and
dozens of bomb attacks.
</P>
<P>
In 2003, a special court gave multiple life sentences to November
17's leader, chief assassin and three other members. Lesser
sentences were given to 10 others.
</P>
<P>
November 17 carried out a similar rocket attack against the U.S.
embassy in 1996, causing minor damage and no injuries.
</P>
<P>
Several obscure militant groups have appeared since the November
17 members were arrested.
</P>
<P>
Radical groups Revolutionary Struggle and Popular Revolutionary
Action were blamed for the bombings of three government
ministries in 2005.
