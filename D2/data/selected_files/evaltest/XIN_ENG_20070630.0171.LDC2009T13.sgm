LONDON, June 30 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
Britain's senior police officer said here on Saturday night that
the attack at Glasgow airport was linked to events in London
where two car bombs were defused on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Peter Clarke, Deputy Assistant Commissioner of the anti-
terrorism branch at the Metropolitan Police, told a press
conference that one suspect suffering from severe burns is in
critical condition and that suspicious device had been found at
the hospital where suspect was being treated.
</P>
<P>
"The suspect was wearing suspicious device," he said.
</P>
<P>
What's more, he said, the burning Cherokee jeep which crashed
into the main terminal building at the Glasgow Airport on
Saturday afternoon is now in "highly unstable condition at the
scene of attack." It contained inflammable materials.
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister Gordon Brown urged the public on Saturday
night to remain vigilant and support the police after the
national security alert level was raised to "critical".
</P>
<P>
He reassured people that it is right to raise security level at
airports and crowded places, and safety of the people is the
government's first duty.
</P>
<P>
"The British people must remain united, resolute and strong," he
said after chairing a Cobra meeting with the Home Secretary and
the security officers.
</P>
<P>
The highest security alert level means imminent attack is
expected.
</P>
<P>
The Home Office has also ordered security to be tightened across
the country.
</P>
<P>
A burning car was driven at the front of the main terminal
building at Glasgow Airport, at around 3:15 p.m. on Saturday
afternoon. Two people were arrested and the airport was evacuated
and closed following the incident.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses described the car as a Jeep Cherokee which was driven
at speed towards the building with flames coming out from
underneath.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the incident, vehicle access were closed at New
Castle and Edinburgh airports on heightened state of alert, while
armed police closed off Blackpool airport at the west coast of
Britain.
</P>
<P>
The incident is now treated as a terrorist attack. And police are
calling on people to be vigilant.
