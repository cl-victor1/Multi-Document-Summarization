Grief and disbelief in Finland after school massacre
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Normally tranquil Finland was struggling to comprehend Thursday
why a teenage gunman massacred eight people at a school in what
he claimed was an attack on "humanity".
</P>
<P>
Flags flew at half mast across the Nordic country a day after 18
-year-old Pekka- Eric Auvinen went on his shooting spree at
Jokela High School in Tuusula -- a small, picturesque town of
just 30,000 inhabitants on the banks of a lake north of Helsinki.
</P>
<P>
Auvinen, a broad-shouldered, blond-haired youth described by
police as "a lonely person with a strong anger against society
and radical thoughts," walked through the school late Wednesday
morning, peppering hallways and classrooms with 69 bullets.
</P>
<P>
When his 20-minute shooting rampage was over, five boys aged
between 16 and 18, the 61-year-old headmistress, a 42-year-old
female nurse and a 25-year-old single mother taking an adult
training class at the school were dead, all of them with multiple
gun shot wounds to the head and upper body.
</P>
<P>
The twelve people injured in the attack, most of them suffering
cuts from broken window panes as they frantically jumped out of
windows to escape the rain of bullets, had been released from
hospital.
</P>
<P>
Police, who gave no details on the order in which the victims had
been shot, said Auvinen had also tried to set a second floor
corridor on fire using an unidentified inflammable liquid before
shooting himself in the head in a bathroom near the school
cafeteria.
</P>
<P>
Auvinen, who died of his wounds late Wednesday, was carrying 320
more bullets when he was found, according to police, who found no
other weapons in his home.
</P>
<P>
"From the first indication we have, he shot randomly, but this
kind of thing is under investigation still," police officer Jan
Olof Nyholm told a press conference, adding that the gunman had
carried out his deadly rampage alone.
</P>
<P>
Auvinen, described as an adherent of extreme philosophies on both
the left and the right, had posted a notice on website YouTube
before the attack detailing how he would carry out the massacre
as well as a video entitled "Jokela High School Massacre --
11/7/2007".
</P>
<P>
"I don't want this to be called only as 'school shooting'," he
said of the massacre, which appears to have been planned to
coincide with the anniversary of the Bolshevik revolution.
</P>
<P>
In the "attack information", he clearly detailed his intentions.
</P>
<P>
"Target: Jokela High School, students and faculty, society,
humanity, human race ... Attack type: mass murder, political
terrorism."
</P>
<P>
"Although I choosed (sic) the school as target, my motives for
the attack are political and much, much deeper and therefore I
don't want this to be called only as 'school shooting'," he added
in the message which was rapidly removed from the sight after
attack.
</P>
<P>
Several of the 18-year-old's classmates and teachers described a
brilliant but complex loner obsessed with weapons, Internet war
games and revolutionary history who was often bullied and
tormented.
</P>
<P>
Students said the perpetrator of one of the worst tragedies in
recent Finnish history had made no secret of his admiration for
Hitler and Stalin and had been taking anti-depressant
medications, something police refused to comment on.
</P>
<P>
Auvinen left a suicide note for his family that had been handed
over to police.
</P>
<P>
"It was a kind of goodbye letter to the relatives," Nyholm said,
adding that the boy's family had been placed under police
protection because of threats.
</P>
<P>
The shooting sent shockwaves through Finland, which with its mere
5.3 million inhabitants and low crime rates, is unaccustomed to
such violence.
</P>
<P>
"Tuusula will have lifelong scars," mayor Hannu Joensivu told the
FNB news agency.
