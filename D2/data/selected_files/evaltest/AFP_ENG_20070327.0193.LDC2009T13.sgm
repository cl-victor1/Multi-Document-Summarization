Thieves in northeast Cambodia poisoned a domesticated elephant
before sawing off its valuable tusks to sell on the black market,
police said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The 62-year-old bull elephant was found dead Saturday some 100
metres (yards) from its owner's home in Ratanakkiri province,
police said, adding that it appeared to have been fed jack fruit
laced with rat poison.

"The elephant's tusks, measuring between 70 to 80 centimeters
(about 32 inches) long each, were sawed off," said deputy
provincial police chief Hor Ang.
</P>
<P>
He said the tusks could fetch thousands of dollars on the illegal
ivory market.

<P>
No one had been arrested for the killing, Hor Ang said, adding
the elephant's body had since been butchered for meat.
</P>
<P>
Only 30 elephants remain in Ratanakkiri, where the animals are a
key means of transport for villagers.
