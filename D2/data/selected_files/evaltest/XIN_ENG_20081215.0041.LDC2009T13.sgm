BAGHDAD, Dec. 14 (Xinhua) -- An Iraqi reporter threw his shoes at
visiting U.S. President George W. Bush and called him a "dog" in
Arabic during a news conference with Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri
al-Maliki in Baghdad on Sunday.

Reporter of Baghdadiya television jumped and threw his two shoes
one by one at the president, who ducked and thus narrowly missed
the attack, raising chaos in the hall in Baghdad's heavily-
fortified Green Zone.
