WASHINGTON

Defense Secretary Robert Gates named an independent review panel
Friday to investigate what he called an ``unacceptable
situation'' in outpatient care at Walter Reed Army Medical
Center, and he said that some soldiers ``most directly involved''
in the problems have been removed from their positions.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters during a visit to the Army hospital in the
District of Columbia, Gates also warned that senior military
leaders could be disciplined based on the findings of the review
group.
</P>
<P>
``We empower commanders with responsibility, authority and
resources necessary to carry out their missions. With
responsibility comes accountability,'' Gates said. ``Accordingly,
after the facts are established, those responsible for allowing
this situation to develop will indeed be held accountable.''
</P>
<P>
The Senate Armed Services Committee has tentatively scheduled
hearings on the facility for March 6, said a spokeswoman for the
panel's chairman, Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich. Sen. John Warner,
R-Va., the ranking minority member of the committee, toured the
facility Friday.
</P>
<P>
The actions came after stories in the Washington Post last
weekend that revealed that wounded soldiers recuperating at
Walter Reed often become mired in red tape as they seek further
treatment or decisions about whether they will stay in the
military. The articles also disclosed poor living conditions --
including mold, filth and leaks -- in Building 18, an Army
facility housing recovering troops.
</P>
<P>
``I'm grateful to reporters for bringing this to our attention,
but thoroughly disappointed we did not identify it ourselves,''
Gates said in his first public remarks addressing the situation.
</P>
<P>
The eight-member review group appointed by Gates has been charged
with taking a broad look at all rehabilitative care and
administrative procedures both at Walter Reed and the National
Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Md. Panel members ``will be
given free and unrestricted access'' to visit medical facilities
and interview personnel, Gates said.
</P>
<P>
The group will be co-chaired by Togo West, who was secretary of
veterans affairs and secretary of the Army during the Clinton
administration, and by John ``Jack'' Marsh, who was secretary of
the Army under President Reagan and a former member of Congress
from Virginia. Other members include two former members of
Congress, three retired senior military officers and a retired
command sergeant major. Their report is due within 45 days and
will be made public, Gates said.
</P>
<P>
Gates said he had no information suggesting there are problems at
Bethesda similar to those at Walter Reed, but said the naval
facility is being included because ``we need to know the scope of
this problem.''
</P>
<P>
There is rare unanimity in Washington on the need to treat
wounded soldiers well, Gates said, ``and so we're determined to
fix it, and fix it fast.''
</P>
<P>
He described the medical care itself at the hospital as
``unsurpassable'' and said the shortcomings were confined to
``the outpatient aspect of this.''
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Gates met a group of five soldiers being
treated at the facility who spoke of a frustrating administrative
bureaucracy at the hospital.
</P>
<P>
``They battled our foreign enemies, they should not have to
battle an American bureaucracy,'' Gates said.
</P>
<P>
Gates said caseworkers are ``overwhelmed'' by the numbers of
patients they are assigned, and he indicated more workers would
be soon assigned to the hospital.
</P>
<P>
``There's just too much work for the number of people that are
available,'' he said. ``So that's one thing that can be addressed
pretty quickly.''
</P>
<P>
Gates added that troops who had been wounded in service ``should
not have to recuperate in substandard housing.''
</P>
<P>
The Army declined to identify publicly the personnel who have
been moved to different positions at the hospital. Speaking on
background, an Army official said they included several soldiers
involved in supervising facilities at Walter Reed, including
Building 18.
</P>
<P>
Gates met with President Bush Friday morning to brief him on the
actions underway. ``He is, understandably, concerned and emphatic
in wanting the best possible care for our wounded soldiers and
for their families,'' Gates said.
