Bad weather on Tuesday prevented search aircraft from looking for
more survivors from an Indonesian ferry that sank in stormy
weather as 400 people remained missing days after the disaster.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 200 have been found alive so far, and authorities say they
will keep searching until next Sunday. Twelve corpses have been
recovered and scores of others have been spotted, official say.

On Monday, an air force plane dropped food and water to some
survivors stranded in the Java Sea.

<P>
Weeping relatives camped out at a local hospital were becoming
more and more desperate, however, and a temporary morgue was
being set up at a port close to where the crowded passenger ship
went down Friday just before midnight.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of body bags have been readied.

"I am tired of crying," said Sipan, who goes by only one name, as
he waited at Rembang hospital for news of his son. "Dead or
alive, I will accept his destiny. It is up to God. All I can do
is keep waiting."

The Senopati Nusantara sank quickly after being pounded by heavy
waves for more than 10 hours as it neared the end of a two-day
journey from the Indonesian section of Borneo island to the
country's main island of Java.

Head of the search and rescue mission Jan Simamora said that high
winds and poor visibility had prevented helicopters and search
planes from taking to the air on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Harrowing tales about the ship's last moments continued to
emerge.

<P>
Waluyo, 50, recalled holding onto a large tire and seeing two of
his children lose their grip and drown.
</P>
<P>
"For 17 hours we held on, sometimes being turned over in the
swell, but one-by-one the people fell off, including my two
children," he said. "I could not do anything apart from pray."
Waluyo also goes by a single name.

<P>
The ferry, which was built in Japan in 1992, had a capacity of
850 people. Officials say bad weather was the cause of the
accident.
