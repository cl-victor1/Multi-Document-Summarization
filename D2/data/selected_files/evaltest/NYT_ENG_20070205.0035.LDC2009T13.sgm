LET'S KEEP COMPASSION IN DOMESTIC PARTNERSHIP DEBATE
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In two hospital emergency rooms, each time with a loved one near
death, I've been forced to face intense, unexpected decisions
about life-support systems and donations of organs.
</P>
<P>
An emergency room is a place to say goodbye, profess one's love,
but also to carry out the wishes of a person no longer able to
speak for himself or herself.
</P>
<P>
Can you imagine, at such a traumatic time, the pain of being
denied access, or refused a role, or unable to speak to a
person's wishes?
</P>
<P>
A Seattle woman name Charlene Strong faced exactly that situation
during the Dec. 14 flood, and spoke to it recently in Olympia.
</P>
<P>
Strong was the partner of Kate Fleming, an audio-book narrator
killed in her basement on that bleak day. She was testifying for
Senate Bill 5336, legislation that recognizes and grants rights
to people in domestic partnerships, specifically same-sex couples
and elderly couples who have not wed.
</P>
<P>
"After attempts by myself to retrieve Kate from her audio-book
studio in our basement and almost drowning myself, I then
followed the ambulance to Harborview Medical Center," Strong told
senators.
</P>
<P>
"When I arrived at Harborview, I was denied access to Kathryn to
be by her side as she lay dying. A family member was called in
Alexandria, Virginia, to allow me to be in that room with her. As
the minutes ticked by, I kept wondering, 'What if she dies
without me holding her hand? What if she dies without knowing
that I told her I loved her, or took off her wedding ring?"
</P>
<P>
Strong was then treated "like any other married person" by the
hospital's medical staff. But, for a time, there was another
obstacle.
</P>
<P>
"After going through the most awful possible thing that I could
have gone through in my life and almost dying myself, I was then
denied access and the ability to tell them that they were allowed
to take Kate's retinas," she testified.
</P>
<P>
"A family member was again contacted."
</P>
<P>
Once before in my memory, 33 years ago, has Olympia heard such
riveting testimony.
</P>
<P>
In that instance, it was delivered by a friend of mine named Pat
Hemenway, who was shot by a robber while walking with a friend in
the Washington Park Arboretum, and rendered a quadriplegic.
</P>
<P>
As Hemenway testified, state Sen. Perry Woodall, R-Toppenish,
read a newspaper on the dais in front of her, shuffling its pages
as his colleagues strained to hear the woman's soft voice.
</P>
<P>
But that voice had the power to persuade lawmakers to pass the
Crime Victims Compensation Act. (Hemenway died of pneumonia soon
after its enactment.)
</P>
<P>
The courage of Charlene Strong, and the memory of Kate Fleming,
should persuade legislators to enact domestic partnership
legislation. It is the decent, humane thing to do.
</P>
<P>
There is opposition, from self-described defenders of
"traditional values." The domestic partnership legislation is
part of the "gay rights agenda" and "more about authenticating a
lifestyle that is historically out-of-step with society and
clearly in violation of biblical teaching," Gary Randall of the
Faith and Freedom Network told his troops in an e-mail Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Be assured, the Domestic Partners bill that is now being heard
is merely an incremental step toward gay marriage," Randall
wrote.
</P>
<P>
Politics has reared its head. The gay and lesbian community wants
same-sex marriage. The Democratic-controlled Legislature is not
prepared to go that far. Sen. Ed Murray, D-Seattle, opted for a
domestic partnership bill.
</P>
<P>
But there's a more important matter, the human consequences that
flow from this nation's "values" debates.
</P>
<P>
The most awful ER experience, for me, was the litany of organ
donation. As a loved one lay dying nearby, I had to answer 56
often- intimate questions about her life and health. And then,
organ by organ, we discussed what was to be donated.
</P>
<P>
What could cause greater pain and hurt? Not being able to answer
those questions. Not being allowed to make those choices. Not
getting to voice the loved one's wishes.
</P>
<P>
We must not let passages from the Old Testament, or the question
of whether we "approve" of someone's lifestyle, distract us from
our basic sense of decency and fair play.
</P>
<P>
Bishop Joseph Tyson, speaking for the Washington State Catholic
Conference, spoke against SB 5336 at the hearing. He argued that
those wanting to change the state's definition of marriage would
"undermine the one source of social and civil stability available
in many peoples' lives."
</P>
<P>
As well, Tyson argued that the domestic partnership bill would
extend rights only to a limited constituency. What about
multigenerational households, particularly those of immigrants,
that also face decisions about visitation, health care and
insurance coverage?
</P>
<P>
The Catholic Conference ought to come back with a proposal to
cover other relationships -- after SB 5336 is passed and signed
by Gov. Chris Gregoire.
</P>
<P>
An interesting sidelight to the partnership debate: Kate Fleming
was a highly regarded parishioner at St. Therese Church. The two
most outspoken gays to serve in the Legislature -- Murray and the
late state Sen. Cal Anderson -- have been Catholics. Catholic
social gospel even seeps through when The Stranger's gay editor,
Dan Savage, excoriates the hierarchy in Rome.
</P>
<P>
It makes you hope to see a day when the church comes out from the
shadow of discipline and dogma and into the sunlight of human
rights -- for all of God's children.
