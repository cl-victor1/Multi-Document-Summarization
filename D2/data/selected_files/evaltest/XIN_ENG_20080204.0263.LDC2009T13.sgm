Spokesman for Fatah's armed wing denies bombers entered Israel
via Egypt

GAZA, Feb. 4 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades, armed wing of
Palestinian Fatah movement, denied on Monday the reports that the
two suicide bombers attacking Israel entered Israel via Egypt's
Sinai Peninsula where the border fence with Gaza had been blew
holes.
</P>
<P>
"The two departed from Gaza, and then they went to the liberated
areas called 'area A', then to the territories occupied by Israel
in 1948," Abu al-Waleed told a news conference held in Gaza City
without explanation of "area A."
</P>
<P>
However, "area A" usually describes the areas under the control
of the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) in the West Bank,
which means the bombers did not get to Israel through Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Two Palestinian suicide bombers attempted to carry out a twin
bombing attack in a busy commercial center of southern Israeli
town of Dimona.
</P>
<P>
The first bomber successfully detonated his explosive belt in the
commercial center, killing an Israeli woman and wounding 10
others, while the second was shot dead by Israeli police before
he could set off his explosive device.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman on behalf of his group claimed the responsibility
for the attack, saying "This operation is carried out in the
frame of retaliation to the ongoing Israeli aggression against
the Palestinian people in the West Bank and Gaza."
</P>
<P>
However, al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades is not the only Palestinian
group which claim the attack while two other groups, Abu Ali
Mustafa of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine
(PFLP) and a previously unknown group named itself as Brigades of
National Resistance, also claimed the responsibility.
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, Hamas militants in Gaza blew holes in the border
wall between Gaza and Egypt, allowing hundreds of thousands of
Gazans flocked into Egypt.
</P>
<P>
As the border fence between Gaza and Egypt had been porous before
Egyptian border guards finally sealed off the breached border
fence on Sunday, speculations were aroused in the wake of the
attack within Israel on that the two bombers might sneak into
Israel through Egypt.
