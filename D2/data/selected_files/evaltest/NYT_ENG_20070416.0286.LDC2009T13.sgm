32 SHOT DEAD AT VIRGINIA TECH IN NATION'S WORST SHOOTING RAMPAGE

BLACKSBURG, Va.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-two people were killed and at least 15 injured in two
shooting attacks at Virginia Tech on Monday during three hours of
horror and chaos on this sprawling southwestern Virginia campus.
</P>
<P>
According to the police and witnesses, some victims were executed
with handguns while other students were hurt jumping from upper-
story windows of the classroom building where most of the
killings occurred. After the second round of killings, the gunman
killed himself, the police said.
</P>
<P>
It was the deadliest shooting rampage in American history and
came nearly eight years to the day after 13 people died at
Columbine High School in Colorado at the hands of two disaffected
students who then killed themselves.
</P>
<P>
As of Monday evening, only one of the Virginia Tech victims had
been officially identified. Police officials said they were not
yet ready to identify the gunman or even say whether there was
more than one in the attacks that wreaked devastation on this
campus of 36,000 students, faculty members and staff.
</P>
<P>
The university's president, Charles W. Steger, expressed his
"horror and disbelief and sorrow" at what he described as a
tragedy of monumental proportions. But questions were immediately
raised about whether university officials had responded
adequately to the shootings.
</P>
<P>
There was a two-hour gap between the first shootings, when two
people were killed, and the second, when 30 were killed. The
university did not send a campuswide alert until the second
incident had begun.
</P>
<P>
Steger defended the decision not to shut down or evacuate the
campus after the first shootings, saying officials had believed
the first incident was a self-contained event, which the campus
police believed was a "domestic" dispute.
</P>
<P>
"We had no reason to suspect any other incident was going to
occur," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Virginia Tech attacks started early in the morning, with a
call to police at 7:15 from West Ambler Johnston Hall, a
900-student freshman dormitory, as students were getting ready
for classes or were on their way to them.
