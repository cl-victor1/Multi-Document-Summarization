Nine dead in US mall gun rampage
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A man opened fire with a rifle inside a Nebraska mall Wednesday,
killing at least eight people before turning the gun on himself
as panicked employees and Christmas shoppers ran for cover,
police said.
</P>
<P>
At least five other people were injured and taken to area
hospitals after the shooting inside the Westroads Mall in Omaha,
Sergeant Teresa Negron told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
"We have confirmed nine people that ... died from their
injuries," Negron said. "We have two people that are still in
critical condition and three that have gunshot wounds."
</P>
<P>
She said police believe the man acted alone and used a rifle. "We
secured and cleared most of the mall," Negron said.
</P>
<P>
Local television station KETV, citing a sheriff's department,
identified the shooter as a 19-year-old man named Robert Hawkins.
</P>
<P>
The Sarpy County Sheriff's Department, located just south of
Omaha in Papillion, told KETV that Hawkins' mother walked into
its office shortly after the shooting with a note that "could be
interpreted as suicidal."
</P>
<P>
The sheriff's office could not be immediately reached for
comment.
</P>
<P>
Employees and shoppers fled the mall or locked themselves inside
stores after hearing dozens of shots from the upscale Von Maur
department store, where police said the shooting took place.
</P>
<P>
"People were freaking," an employee at Whitehall jewelers, who
refused to give her name, told AFP by telephone.
</P>
<P>
Shoppers and workers described a terrifying scene.
</P>
<P>
"We heard about 35, 40 shots, and on our way we did see someone
down by the escalator, bleeding," witness Jennifer Cramer told
KETV.
</P>
<P>
"I was standing around getting ready to go back to work and all
of a sudden I heard this bang, bang, bang -- it sounded like
someone shooting fireworks," another witness told KETV. "I ran to
get away from whatever was happening."
</P>
<P>
The shooting took place as President George W. Bush headed back
to Washington after delivering a Republican fund-raising speech
in Omaha.
</P>
<P>
Bush expressed sadness after learning about the latest in a
series of shootings in the United States.
</P>
<P>
"His thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families
this evening," the White House said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"Having just visited with so many members of the community in
Omaha today, the President is confident that they will pull
together to comfort one another as they deal with this terrible
tragedy," it said.
</P>
<P>
The Nebraska incident was the latest in a series of shootings in
the United States, where guns are prevalent on the streets.
</P>
<P>
Late last month two people were found dead in an apparent murder-
suicide at a Texas mall.
</P>
<P>
The woman was working at a store when she got a phone call from
her angry boyfriend who threatened to harm her, local television
station KHOU said.
</P>
<P>
The woman called mall security for help, but the boyfriend
arrived before they did and took her hostage, pulling down the
store's front gate and barricading them inside.
</P>
<P>
There have also been a series of school shootings this year, the
worst being the Virginia Tech massacre in April in which 32
people were killed when a student went on a campus rampage.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Bureau of Investigation reported in September that
more than 1.4 million murders, rapes, robberies and assaults were
committed around the United States last year, or a violent crime
every 22 seconds.
</P>
<P>
The number of victims of these violent crimes in the United
States last year was the equivalent of the entire population of
European Union member Estonia or the African state of Gabon.
</P>
<P>
The rate of violent crime was up by 1.9 percent compared with
2005, with murders climbing by 1.8 percent to nearly 15,000 cases
last year.
