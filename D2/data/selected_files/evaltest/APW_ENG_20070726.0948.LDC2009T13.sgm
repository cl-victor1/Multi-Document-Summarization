Michael Vick due in federal court to enter plea on dogfighting
conspiracy charges

RICHMOND, Virginia 2007-07-26 14:32:05 UTC

<P>
Michael Vick was due in federal court Thursday to start a legal
process that jeopardizes not only his career, but also his
freedom.
</P>
<P>
The Atlanta Falcons quarterback was expected to appear at a bond
hearing and enter a plea on dogfighting conspiracy charges. Vick
is accused with three others of conspiracy involving competitive
dogfighting, procuring and training pit bulls for fighting, and
conducting the enterprise across state lines. Federal prosecutors
allege the operation -- known as Bad Newz Kennels -- operated on
Vick's property in rural Surry County.
</P>
<P>
They all face up to six years in prison, $350,000 in fines and
restitution if convicted of both charges.
</P>
<P>
The grisly allegations detailed in an 18-page indictment sparked
protests by animal rights groups at the headquarters of the NFL
and the Falcons, and NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell has barred
Vick from training camp while the league investigates.
</P>
<P>
Falcons owner Arthur Blank said the team wanted to suspend Vick
for four games, the maximum penalty a team can assess a player,
but the NFL asked him to wait. Instead, Blank has told his
embattled player to focus on his legal problems, not football.
</P>
<P>
The case began April 25 when investigators conducting a drug
search at the home found 66 dogs, including 55 pit bulls, and
equipment typically used in dogfighting. Items such as a "rape
stand" that holds aggressive dogs in place for mating and a
"breakstick" used to pry open a dog's mouth in a fight were
seized.
</P>
<P>
Vick contended he knew nothing about a dogfighting operation at
the home, where one of his cousins lived, and said he rarely
visited. He has since declined comment, citing his attorney's
advice.
</P>
<P>
Attorney Lawrence Woodward of Virginia Beach, who has also
represented Allen Iverson and Vick's younger brother, Marcus, has
not returned several phone messages.
</P>
<P>
Animal rights organizations have seized on the case as an
opportunity to raise awareness of the largely underground and
always gruesome world of dogfighting, where dogs are trained to
fight to the death.
</P>
<P>
Five hours before Vick's scheduled arraignment, animal rights
activists, supporters of the athlete and the media gathered early
Thursday outside the federal courthouse. About 40 people began
queuing for a seat in the courtroom or an overflow courtroom.
</P>
<P>
Some members of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals
dressed in dog costumes and carried signs, including one with the
image of a battered pit bull and the words "Dogfighting Victim."
</P>
<P>
A trio of supporters from Boston wearing Vick's No. 7 jersey and
Atlanta Falcons' hats made the nine-hour trip south to support
Vick.
</P>
<P>
According to the indictment filed July 17, dogs not killed in the
fighting pit were often shot, hanged, drowned or, in one case,
slammed to the ground. The document alleges that Vick was
consulted before one losing dog was wet down and electrocuted.
</P>
<P>
It alleges that the dogfighting operation began in 2001, not long
after Vick parlayed a dazzling two-year run as the quarterback at
Virginia Tech into the first overall selection in the NFL Draft.
His first contract was for $62 million.
</P>
<P>
In 2004, he signed a 10-year, $130 million deal, then the richest
in league history.
</P>
<P>
The indictment alleges the fights offered purses as high as
$26,000, and Vick once paid $23,000 to the owner of two pit bulls
that had beaten Bad Newz Kennels dogs.
