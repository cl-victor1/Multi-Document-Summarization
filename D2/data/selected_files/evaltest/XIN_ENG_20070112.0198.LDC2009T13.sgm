Research shows shrinking telomeres linked to heart disease

LONDON, Jan. 12 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
The gradual erosion of telomeres, the strands of DNA capping
chromosomes that wear away with each cell division, may play a
pivotal role in heart disease, and drugs called statins may limit
the damage, the New Scientist reported on Friday on its website.
</P>
<P>
Researchers from Leicester and Glasgow Universities in the United
Kingdom found that people who have much shorter telomeres are
more likely to suffer from heart attacks.
</P>
<P>
In the five-year research, they first took blood samples from 484
middle-aged men with moderately raised cholesterol and from 1058
control subjects, and compared the telomere lengths in their
white blood cells.
</P>
<P>
The researchers eventually found both patients and controls with
the shortest telomeres were twice as likely to have developed
serious heart disease,
</P>
<P>
They also found that statins, which are better known for their
cholesterol- lowering properties, appeared to alleviate the
effects of telomere damage and may even protect telomeres against
degradation.
</P>
<P>
But the protective effect of statins was only seen in patients
with comparatively short telomeres.
</P>
<P>
"In patients whose telomeres were wearing away at a normal rate,
statin treatment didn't make any difference. This suggests that
statins were protecting against the worst cases of telomere
degradation. Without statins they might have been even shorter,"
Leicester University cardiologist Nilesh Samani, who led the
research, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
For years, doctors and scientists have suspected that another
property of statins, unrelated to their cholesterol-lowering
ability, explained how they protected patients from heart disease
and stroke so effectively.
</P>
<P>
The discoveries made by Samani's team provide important new
insights into the causes of arterial disease.
</P>
<P>
Samani said exactly how statins might limit the damage caused by
telomere shortening or even directly protect telomeres was "
speculation at this stage," but his group has already begun
laboratory studies to test how the drugs interact with telomeres.
