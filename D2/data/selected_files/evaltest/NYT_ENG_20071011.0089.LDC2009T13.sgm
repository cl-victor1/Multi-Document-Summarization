MAKERS WITHDRAW INFANT COLD MEDICINES FROM THE MARKET
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Major makers of over-the-counter infant cough and cold medicines
announced Thursday that they were voluntarily withdrawing their
products from the market for fear that they could be misused by
parents.
</P>
<P>
The voluntary withdrawal affects only products labeled for
"infants," not those for use in children 2 and older. And some
small companies may continue selling the products.
</P>
<P>
The move comes two weeks after safety reviewers within the Food
and Drug Administration urged the agency to consider an outright
ban of over-the-counter cough and cold products for children
under the age of 6. Even the industry's own trade association,
the Consumer Healthcare Products Association, recommended two
weeks ago that the products should no longer be used for infants.
</P>
<P>
Despite this recommendation, makers continued to sell cough and
cold products labeled for infants.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Rep. Henry A. Waxman, D-Calif., who is chairman of the
House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, sent a letter
to the industry's trade association asking why "in direct
contradiction to this recommendation, however, many C.H.P.A.
member companies are currently marketing these products for use
in children under 2."
</P>
<P>
Next week, a committee of outside experts will meet to consider
the safety of these medicines and offer recommendations to the
agency.
</P>
<P>
There are roughly 800 over-the-counter pediatric cough and cold
products. In the year prior to July 15, makers sold at least 41
million packages of these in the United States, according to the
healthcare products group, about a fifth of which were sold in
the form of "drops" that are generally targeted for use in
infants.
</P>
<P>
The industry said that the medicines are safe and effective when
used as directed.
</P>
<P>
"The reason the makers of over-the-counter, oral cough and cold
medicine for infants are withdrawing these medicines is that
there have been rare patterns of misuse leading to overdose
recently identified, particularly in infants, and safety is our
top priority," said Linda A. Suydam, president of the trade
association.
</P>
<P>
There is very little evidence that cough and cold medicines are
effective in young children, and there are increasing fears that
they may be dangerous. From 1969 to 2006, at least 45 children
died after taking decongestants, and 69 died after taking
antihistamines, the industry association has said.
</P>
<P>
Many of these children were injured after their parents
mistakenly gave them too much, either because they did not
realize that products from two different makers contained
identical medicine, or the parents measured doses poorly. But
there are growing reports that even children given recommended
quantities of the medicines are at risk.
</P>
<P>
The Poison Control Center of the Children's Hospital of
Philadelphia recently reported on four cases of prolonged
hallucinations in children as old as 6 who were given recommended
doses of the medicines.
</P>
<P>
With almost no evidence that they are effective and growing
worries that they may be unsafe, a group of prominent
pediatricians petitioned the agency earlier this year to consider
banning the drugs' use in young children.
</P>
<P>
Among the products being withdrawn are Dimetapp Decongestant
Infant Drops, Little Colds Decongestant Plus Cough, Pediacare
Infant Drops Decongestant, Robitussin Infant Cough DM Drops,
Triaminic Infant and Toddler Thin Strips Decongestant, and
Tylenol Concentrated Infant Drops Plus Cold and Cough.
</P>
<P>
Dimetapp and Robitussin are products of Wyeth; Little Colds is
made by the Medtech Products unit of Prestige Brands Holdings;
Tylenol and Pediacare are made by the McNeil Consumer Healthcare
unit of Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson; and Triaminic is made by
Novartis.
</P>
<P>
None of the companies' stocks moved significantly on Thursday; by
midafternoon Novartis and Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson were trading
slightly higher, and Wyeth and Prestige Brands slightly lower.
