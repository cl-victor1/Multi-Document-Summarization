DON'T LET WINTER SAP YOUR VITAMIN D RESERVES
</HEADLINE>

ALBANY, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
Feeling tired? Achy?
</P>
<P>
It may not be the winter blahs, but a lack of vitamin D brought
about by, well, winter.
</P>
<P>
"Vitamin D deficiency is very common," particularly in areas hard
hit by winter, says Robert Busch, an endocrinologist here.
</P>
<P>
Vitamin D, called the "sunshine vitamin" because the body makes
its own after absorbing the sun's rays, is key to the absorption
of calcium. When we don't get enough, our bodies draw calcium out
of our bones to compensate, reducing bone density and increasing
fracture risk, Busch says.
</P>
<P>
This is of particular concern among post-menopausal women and
those with a high risk of osteoporosis. Because of deficiency
concerns, the current recommendations for vitamin D -- 200
international units for people up to age 50; 400 IUs for those 51
to 70; and 600 IUs for those older -- may be changing, says Judy
Carr, a registered dietitian and certified diabetes educator.
</P>
<P>
"It is one of those vitamins that they're taking a closer look at
to see if we really need to increase how many units we should
take," she says.
</P>
<P>
In December, after reading a little more about the vitamin, Carr
asked her doctor to include a vitamin D analysis with her routine
blood work.
</P>
<P>
Carr was surprised when her results came back showing her levels
were on the low end of normal. "I'm thinking if that's me,
because I don't have a horrible diet, I can't imagine what the
general population's is," Carr says.
</P>
<P>
She started taking vitamin D supplements, which are just a few
dollars for a bottle of 100, and noticed she no longer felt as
stiff in her joints. Now, when she does nutritional consultations
with patients who are complaining of joint pain or muscle
weakness, she asks if their doctor has checked their vitamin D
levels.
</P>
<P>
Scientists are also assessing the vitamin's role in boosting the
immune system and protecting against some cancers.
</P>
<P>
Typically, dietitians say the best source of vitamins is through
the foods we eat, rather than supplements. But Carr says the best
food sources of vitamin D aren't necessarily the foods we love.
</P>
<P>
A tablespoon of cod-liver oil contains more than 1,300 IUs.
</P>
<P>
Salmon (360 IUs for 3.5 ounces), sardines (250 IUs for 13/4
ounces) and fortified milk (about 100 IUs per serving) are also
good sources.
</P>
<P>
In the summer, go without sunscreen for no more than 15 minutes a
few times a week, and your body can make sufficient amounts of
vitamin D without putting you at greater risk for skin cancer,
Busch says.
</P>
<P>
He suggests post-menopausal women, those with unexplained muscle
weakness and anyone else who may suspect low vitamin D levels ask
their doctors for a "25-hydroxy vitamin D" screening.
</P>
<P>
And it's reasonable, Busch advises, for someone with insufficient
levels of vitamin D to take up to 1,000 IUs daily without any
adverse side effects.
