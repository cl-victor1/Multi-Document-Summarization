Indonesia watchdog sues over 'mud volcano'
</HEADLINE>

An Indonesian environmental watchdog said it had filed suit on
Monday against a mining company and President Susilo Bambang
Yudhoyono over a "mud volcano" which has forced thousands to flee
their homes.
</P>
<P>
A gas well near Surabaya in East Java operated by PT Lapindo
Brantas has spewed steaming mud since May last year, submerging
villages, factories and fields in the Sidoarjo district.
</P>
<P>
"We are taking them to court because the mud outflow caused by
Lapindo has thoroughly damaged the environment in Sidoarjo," said
Chalid Muhammad, the chairman of Walhi, the country's leading
environment watchdog.
</P>
<P>
Lapindo and five related companies, President Yudhoyono, the
energy and environment ministers and local officials were named
as defendants, he said. The officials were named for failing to
quickly contain the mud spill.
</P>
<P>
Yudhoyono has ordered Lapindo to pay 3.8 trillion rupiah (420
million dollars) in compensation and costs.
</P>
<P>
An Indonesian minister, Aburizal Bakrie, claimed last month that
the flow was a "natural disaster" unrelated to the drilling
activities of Lapindo, which belongs to a group controlled by his
family.
</P>
<P>
However, a study by British experts said that the eruption was
most likely caused by drilling for gas.
</P>
<P>
In addition, 13 people died after an explosion in November when
an underground gas pipeline burst following subsidence that was
blamed on the mud leak.
