Two arrested after India bomb blasts kill 63
</HEADLINE>

Indian police on Wednesday arrested two men after eight near-
simultaneous bombings killed 63 people and wounded 216 in the
Rajasthan tourist city of Jaipur, the state's chief minister
said.
</P>
<P>
"We have arrested two people and have detained several (more)
people for questioning," Vasundhara Raje told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
"We have information that 63 people have died and many are
injured critically," she said after the blasts ripped through
crowded markets on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
Seven women and 10 children were among the dead, Raje said.
</P>
<P>
"RDX and ammonium nitrate were used. Ball-bearings were used,
which have weight, and they behave like tiny missiles. Timing
devices were used," she said.
</P>
<P>
"This seems to have been done by some international group," the
chief minister added. Pakistan-based Islamic militants and
fighting against Indian rule in Kashmir are usually blamed for
such attacks.
</P>
<P>
The eight bombs were believed to have been planted on bicycles,
police said, and released a sketch of a suspect they wanted to
question.
</P>
<P>
State home minister Gulab Chand Kataria had earlier told AFP
around a dozen people had been detained. "We are trying our best
to unravel the conspiracy behind this dastardly attack," he said.
</P>
<P>
Among those detained in the city, which was under a day-time
curfew, were one of the wounded and a rickshaw puller, a police
official said.
</P>
<P>
Kataria had initially put the death toll at 80 and 200 injured
while the Press Trust of India reported an "unofficial" toll of
85 dead.
</P>
<P>
The blasts went off within minutes of each other close to several
Hindu temples in what police said was a terror attack on the city
260 kilometres (160 miles) west of the Indian capital.
</P>
<P>
Schools and government offices shut Wednesday in a day of
mourning across the desert state.
</P>
<P>
"It's a terror attack. There was no (intelligence) report of
this," said police director general A.S. Gill.
</P>
<P>
No claims of responsibility were reported.
</P>
<P>
India's junior home minister Shriprakash Jaiswal told reporters
"the people responsible for these attacks have foreign
connections," without naming Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
In Jaipur hospital wards and at the morgue, the dead included
Hindus and Muslims, a strong minority in the city, an AFP
reporter said.
</P>
<P>
Ten-year-old Kanha Mahar had gone to a temple to the Hindu deity
Hanuman on a traditional day to pray to the monkey god.
</P>
<P>
"We were looking for him all evening," said his uncle Jagdish
Kumar Gathera, who found him at the hospital.
</P>
<P>
Gathera and other relatives looked on in shocked silence as
Mahar's body was taken off a rusty gurney, leaving behind a pool
of blood.
</P>
<P>
Muhammad Farid, 29, was heading home from work when the blasts
hit.
</P>
<P>
"I felt like I was hit by lightning and I couldn't really figure
out what was happening," the father of five told AFP at the same
hospital, a blood-stained bandage around his arm.
</P>
<P>
Several of the explosions took place along the walled city's
Johari bazaar, a strip of shops housed in pink buildings that are
the hallmark of Jaipur, known as the pink city.
</P>
<P>
"I heard two explosions... then a bomb went off right in front of
me," said Malchand Bagoria, who runs a fruit stall opposite one
of the bomb sites.
</P>
<P>
"Then I saw a woman's body go flying through the air. There were
so many bodies."
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Manmohan Singh condemned the blasts and appealed
for calm, as the government issued a nationwide security alert.
State borders were sealed.
</P>
<P>
World capitals from Washington to Paris and London condemned the
attacks, while UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon also voiced his
"outrage."
</P>
<P>
"He strongly condemns such terrorist attacks, and sends his
heartfelt sympathies to the Government of India and to the
families of the victims," his spokesman said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Cities across India have been bombed repeatedly in recent years
and analysts say Islamic extremist groups are attempting to stoke
sectarian tensions to derail a peace process with Pakistan and
damage India's booming economy.
</P>
<P>
Jaipur, Rajasthan's capital, is popular with foreign and domestic
tourists but there were few in the city in mid-May, the hot
season in northern India.
