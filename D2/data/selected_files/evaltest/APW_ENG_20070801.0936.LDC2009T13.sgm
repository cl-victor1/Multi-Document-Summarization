Monsoon floods ravaging Bangladesh for more than a week have
killed about 40 people and displaced or marooned millions, relief
officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
More than a third of Bangladesh, a low-lying delta nation of 145
million people, has been inundated by floods, the Food and
Disaster Management Ministry said. At least 5 million people have
either been marooned or displaced in the country's hardest-hit
northern region.
</P>
<P>
The ministry did not specify the number of flood-related deaths,
but relief officials said at least 40 people died in the past
week.
</P>
<P>
Many of the dead were children who drowned, relief officials said
on condition of anonymity, as they were not allowed to speak to
the media.

<P>
Bangladesh is hammered by monsoon floods that kill hundreds every
year and destroy homes and crops.
</P>
<P>
The River Jamuna breached its banks this week, inundating much of
Sirajganj, a small town 104 kilometers (64 miles) northwest of
the national capital Dhaka.
</P>
<P>
Schools and some government offices have been closed as streets
were under waist-high water, local officials said.
</P>
<P>
Many displaced people have taken shelter on embankments, while
others have moved onto rooftops of their houses. Residents are
using small boats to get around.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Fakhruddin Ahmed, the head of the country's
military-backed interim government, toured by helicopter some of
the flood-hit areas in the north and promised to help to the
victims.
</P>
<P>
"We know that you are suffering. Our government will do
everything possible to reduce your miseries," Ahmed said.
