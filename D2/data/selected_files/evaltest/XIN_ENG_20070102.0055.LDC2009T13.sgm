JAKARTA, Jan. 2 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
Indonesian Transportation Ministry' s air transportation director
general M. Ichsan Tatang said the weather in Polewali of
Sulaweisi province was bad when the plane took off from Surabaya.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, flight legal affairs expert attributed the Adam Air
plane accident to an air pocket above Polewali and the plane's
failure to fly 35,000 feet (about 10,600 meters) above the
ground.
</P>
<P>
"The plane had likely flown only about 8,000 feet (about 2,425
meters) instead of recommended 35,000 feet above the ground and
that's why it was vulnerable to an air pocket which could rattle
an airplane," Antara news agency quoted Kamis Martono as saying
here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Matanga sub-district's air zone is prone to air pocket notably
during wet season, he said, adding that Matanga air zone is
similar to Masalombo air zone in South Sulawesi province which is
prone to air pockets.
</P>
<P>
In 1960s, some planes and helicopters crashed on Masalombo area
after they were absorbed by air pockets. Martono likened
Masalombo area to Bermuda Triangle where many ships and airplanes
went missing.
</P>
<P>
A total of 90 passengers have been confirmed died during the
accident and 12 others alive.
</P>
<P>
Three Americans were among passengers of Indonesia's Adam Air
plane Boeing 737-400 that crushed at remote Rangoan village in
Polewali district in West Sulawesi province on Monday, a U.S.
official said.
</P>
<P>
Adam Air informed the U.S. Embassy that three U.S. people
identified as Scot Jackson, Lindsay, and Stephanie were among
passengers of the ill-fated plane, Antara news agency quoted U.S.
Embassy's deputy press attache Shenan Quenn as saying here
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Adam Air, however, could not confirm whether or not the three U.
S. nationals were safe.
</P>
<P>
Latest reports said at least 12 passengers including five
children survived the accident but they were in critical
condition and sent to a nearby hospital in Polewali.
</P>
<P>
The reports said it took about 30 km to transport the survivors
from the location to the nearby hospital by foot.
</P>
<P>
Search and Rescue (SAR) officials reported that the wreckage of
the plane was found in Rangoan village in Matanga sub-district at
8:29 a.m. (0129 GMT) Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Boeing 737-400 plane which carrying 96 passengers including
four infants and 6 crew members lost contact with Makassar
airport at 3:07 p.m. (0807 GMT) Monday on its way from Surabaya
to Manado.
</P>
