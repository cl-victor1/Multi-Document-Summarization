Lawmaker criticises slow response to Indonesia air crash
</HEADLINE>

<P>
An Indonesian lawmaker Tuesday criticised what he said was the
slow deployment of search and rescue teams to a mountainous area
of Sulawesi island where a plane carrying 102 people crashed.
</P>
<P>
The Adam Air Boeing 737-400 crashed Monday afternoon, but search
and rescue teams only discovered the wreckage early Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Ahmad Muqowam, one of the leaders of the parliamentary transport
and communications commission, said the transport department
should have leapt into action the moment the plane disappeared
from radar screens.
</P>
<P>
"The moment they lost communication, when the plane was lost from
radar, the officers in charge should have immediately organised a
search and rescue team to rescue the victims," Muqowam said,
according to state Antara news agency.
</P>
<P>
"All this points to how late the search and rescue for survivors
is," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Boeing 737-400 had sent distress signals an hour after taking
off from Java island en route to Sulawesi, and then disappeared
from radar screens.
</P>
<P>
The Adam Air plane took off Monday at 12:59 pm (0559 GMT) from
Surabaya on Java bound for Manado in northeast Sulawesi.
</P>
<P>
Rescue teams helped by local residents found the wreckage about
90 kilometres (55 miles) from the town of Polewali after
searching for hours in the mountainous region of West Sulawesi,
Antara said.
