1st LD: Somali pirates hijack Saudi Arabian-owned oil tanker
</P>

NAIROBI, Nov. 17 (Xinhua) -- Somali pirates have hijacked a Saudi
Arabian-owned oil tanker, the largest vessel ever seized, loaded
with crude and carrying 25 crew members off the Kenyan coast, a
regional maritime official said on Monday.

Andrew Mwangura, the East African Coordinator of the Seafarers
Assistance Program, said the oil tanker is the largest ship
pirates have hijacked along the east Africa coast.

"It seems the vessel was hijacked on Saturday because the ship is
approaching anchorage off the port of Eyl in Somalia. For it to
reach there, it must have taken three to four days," Mwangura
told Xinhua by telephone.

Reports from the U.S. Navy said the tanker, Sirius Star, operated
by Vela International, was hijacked after a group of pirates
managed to scale the 10-meter high side of the ship.

Lieutenant Nate Christensen, a spokesman for the U.S. Navy's
Fifth Fleet said the hijacking was shocking because it
highlighted the vulnerability of even very large ships and
pointed to widening ambitions and capabilities among ransom-
hungry pirates who have carried out a surge of attacks this year
off Somalia.

<P>
The U.S. Navy said the Saturday's hijacking of the oil tanker
occurred in the Indian Ocean far south of the zone patrolled by
international warships in the busy Gulf of Aden shipping channel,
which leads to and from the Suez Canal.
