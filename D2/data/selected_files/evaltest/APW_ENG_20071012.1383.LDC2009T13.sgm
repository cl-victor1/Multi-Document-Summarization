Charles Cashmore is accused of being one of five men who joined

dealers. He will testify that two of the other men who entered
the room with the former football star were armed, Cashmore's
lawyer Edward Miley said.

Miley said Cashmore will plead guilty Monday to being an

years in prison. A court hearing is set for Monday, a court clerk
confirmed.

Simpson and his co-defendants are accused of holding memorabilia
dealers Bruce Fromong and Alfred Beardsley at gunpoint Sept. 13
in a Las Vegas hotel room and taking boxes of autographed
footballs and other collectibles. Simpson has claimed some of the
items belonged to him and he was retrieving them.

Each man faces 10 charges including kidnapping, armed robbery,
assault with a weapon, burglary and conspiracy. The kidnapping
charge carries the possibility of life in prison if convicted.
