Malawi to formulate law to protect people from deliberate HIV
infection

LILONGWE, Feb. 2 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
Malawi has started a process of formulating a law that will
protect people from deliberate and malicious infection of HIV, a
senior government official disclosed on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The government is just responding to the needs of the people who
have been calling for such a law for a very long time," Mary
Shawa, principal secretary for HIV/AIDS and nutrition in the
president's office told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Shawa said the Malawian government had set up a special law
commission that would come up with an HIV/AIDS law after
consulting the whole country.
</P>
<P>
She said Malawi needed an HIV/AIDS law that would ably protect
people from malicious HIV infection especially in cases of rape
or other sexual abuses, adding that the current legal framework
had huge loopholes in addressing such issues.
</P>
<P>
"We need to protect people from such infections that are
happening in hospitals, homes and everywhere in the country so
that no one gets away with infecting another person
deliberately," she said.
</P>
<P>
Shawa could not however state how soon Malawi would have the
HIV/AIDS law in place but said the country should have formulated
the law some years back.
</P>
<P>
The impoverished southern African country, whose total number of
HIV infected people currently stands at about 1 million, has
about 170,000 infected people who require HIV/AIDS drugs.
</P>
<P>
Malawi, whose population currently stands at about 12 million,
loses 80,000 people every year to HIV/AIDS and about 110,000
people catch HIV annually.
</P>
<P>
The country has however managed to increase the number of people
receiving free anti-retroviral drugs (ARVs) from about 4, 000 two
years ago to 80,000 at present.
</P>
<P>
Malawi, like other southern African countries, has seen its life
expectancy at birth drop from about 60 in the early 1990s to
below 35 presently due to the HIV/AIDS pandemic.
