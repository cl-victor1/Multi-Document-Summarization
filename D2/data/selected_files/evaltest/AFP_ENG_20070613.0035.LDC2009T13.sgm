Insufficient sleep increases risk of cardiovascular disease:
study

<P>
Chronic sleep deprivation can do more than leave you short-
tempered: it can also stress your heart and raise your risk of
cardiovascular disease and death, according to a study released
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The neurological and behavioural effects of long-term sleep loss
have been well- documented, ranging from lowered concentration
and hand-eye coordination to poor mood.
</P>
<P>
But the study by researchers at the University of Pennsylvania
School of Medicine adds to a growing body of evidence that there
is also a physiological price to be paid for insufficient time
under the sheets.
</P>
<P>
The study found that a sleep deficit built up over just five
nights can significantly impair heart function.
</P>
<P>
The researchers tested the cardiac function of their 39
volunteers twice -- once at the beginning of the study, after a
night of 10 hours' sleep, and again after five nights when they
got a mere five hours of shut-eye each night.
</P>
<P>
The electrocardiograms revealed that all of the volunteers had a
much faster heart beat and significantly less heart rate
variability following the nights of sleep deprivation.
</P>
<P>
Heart rate variability describes the naturally occurring beat-to-
beat changes in heart rate which reflect the body's adjustment to
a host of stresses and stimuli.
</P>
<P>
Reduced variability can be a marker for cardiac problems and
other diseases and has been linked to high blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
"The effect of the sleep deficit was to increase the stress on
the hearts of these volunteers," said Siobhan Banks, a lead
author on the study.
</P>
<P>
"If our finding is sustained by a larger group and further
analysis, it may suggest why short sleep duration is associated
with a heightened risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality."
</P>
<P>
The findings are consistent with previous research showing that
shift workers are at higher risk for cardiovascular disease due
to the fact that they get less sleep because of the disruption in
their circadian or sleep-wake rhythms.
</P>
<P>
Banks, an assistant professor at the University of Pennsylvania
in Philadelphia, will present her study Wednesday at SLEEP 2007,
the annual gathering of the Associated Professional Sleep
Societies in Minneapolis, Minnesota.
