NICKEL MINES, Pa.

He was a soccer dad, and a quiet hard-working, church-going family man
who didn't flinch at changing diapers.

So those who knew Charlie Roberts were in a state of shock Monday when
authorities named him as the suicidal gunman who shot a classroom full
of girls, execution-style, in a tiny Amish schoolhouse.
</P>
<P>
``The man who did this today is not the Charlie that I've been married
to for almost 10 years,'' said Marie Roberts, 28, the alleged gunman's
widow, in a statement released to the news media.
</P>
<P>
``My husband is loving, supportive, thoughtful, all the things you'd
always want and more.''

Charles Carl Roberts IV, 32, held a steady job working nights driving
a truck that picked up milk from area dairy farms. A driver who worked
with Roberts said he picked up milk from some of the farms where the
children in the school lived.

<P>
``I imagine he knew some of these kids,'' said Ray Shirk, 60.
</P>
<P>
Roberts, his wife and three children -- two boys and one girl ages
about 1 to 7 -- lived in the tiny village of Georgetown, Pa., 55 miles
west of Philadelphia and a short drive from the school.
