CITES urges Africa to overcome differences on ivory trade
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The UN agency regulating the trade in endangered species, CITES,
on Wednesday urged African states to overcome their deepening
divide over a ban on the ivory trade and elephant conservation.
</P>
<P>
"We need an African position on this issue," said David Morgan,
the head of CITES' scientific support unit.
</P>
<P>
"As long as Africa is divided, then the chances of success are
not so high," he told journalists.
</P>
<P>
The agency revealed that the mainly southern and eastern African
nations in the elephants' range, as well as Mali, submitted
conflicting proposals for the its triennial conference starting
on June 3.
</P>
<P>
They range from Tanzania's request to downgrade controls locally,
to Kenya and Mali's joint proposal to maintain a complete ban on
ivory trade for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
"This demonstrates the divisions that still exist between African
nations on the way forward for conservation of African elephants.
That gap is certainly something we in the secretariat feel needs
to be bridged," Morgan said.
</P>
<P>
"We're hoping to organise a dialogue meeting for all the
countries that hold African elephants before the conference, so
that away from the spotlight they can find some sort of
agreement," he added.
</P>
<P>
The conference allows countries to amend rules aimed at defining
and protecting endangered animal and plant species, including the
1989 ban on commercial ivory trade and some conditional, one-off
sales allowed since then.
</P>
<P>
Kenya and Mali have proposed a complete ban on the overall trade
in elephant tusks or finished ivory products for two decades for
consideration at the conference in The Hague, CITES said.
</P>
<P>
The West and East African nations argued that allowing any trade
in ivory would increase elephant poaching.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Tanzania is recommending that its domestic elephant
population be downgraded from the blanket protection afforded
under a complete trade ban (CITES Appendix I), to more limited
restrictions (Appendix II).
</P>
<P>
Although it did not propose any immediate quota, Tanzania said
some ivory trading would provide a "sustainable and valuable
instrument of conservation," according to the UN agency.
</P>
<P>
Botswana and Namibia have submitted a joint proposal to maintain
restricted sales in southern Africa while easing conditions for
future sales.
</P>
<P>
Botswana is also independently seeking authorisation for
additional one-off ivory sales of 40 tonnes.
</P>
<P>
The conference on June 3 to 15 is also due to re-examine a
monitoring system to assess the impact of poaching, which
Botswana, Namibia and South Africa were meant set up in return
for being allowed one-off sales totalling 60 tonnes of ivory.
</P>
<P>
CITES found that the data was still not sufficiently complete
last October and maintained its block on the one-off sales that
had been agreed in principle five years ago.
