Responding to the current floods in Bangladesh, the United
Kingdom has given 2.5 million U.S. dollars of immediate aid for
the flood victims, private news agency UNB reported Wednesday.

The aid money will be spent for providing food, water, shelter
and medicines for 50,000 people in the ten worst-affected
districts and special assistance through the chars livelihoods
program (CLP).

The UK's Department for International Development (DFID) is
supporting the Bangladesh government's ongoing relief work,
channeling 1.5 million U.S. dollars aid through the United
Nations Development Program (UNDP).

The UK has also authorized DFID's own chars livelihoods program
to offer further flood relief efforts in their operation areas in
five districts in the northern region including Jamalpur,
Sirajgonj, Bogra, Gaibandha and Kurigram. Up to 1 million U.S.
dollars will be spent for this worst hit region by CLP.
