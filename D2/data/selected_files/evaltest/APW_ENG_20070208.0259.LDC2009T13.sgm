VeriSign to spend more than $100M on infrastructure upgrade
</HEADLINE>

SAN FRANCISCO 2007-02-08 04:10:56 UTC
</P>
<P>
VeriSign Inc., which manages the ".com" and ".net" domain names
registry and ensures Internet users can reach those locations,
said it will spend more than $100 million (euro77 million) in a
massive infrastructure upgrade to combat a new wave of computer
attacks and manage a surge in online activity.
</P>
<P>
Industry experts said VeriSign's investment comes at a critical
time for the computing world. They pointed to hackers' powerful
attacks this week on the computers that manage global Internet
traffic as evidence of the mounting threat from online criminals.
</P>
<P>
Stratton Sclavos, VeriSign's chief executive officer, was
scheduled to announce the upgrade Thursday in San Francisco at a
security conference sponsored by RSA Inc., the security division
of EMC Corp.
</P>
<P>
Sclavos said it's the company's largest investment in
infrastructure upgrades and technology development. The overall
investment is slated to boost capacity tenfold by 2010.
</P>
<P>
Sclavos said VeriSign, which operates two of the 13 so-called
"root" servers that manage global Internet traffic, has an
obligation to stay ahead of increasingly insidious and widespread
Internet attacks.
</P>
<P>
"We're seeing a lot more sophistication in these attacks," he
said. "And they're not just targeting thousands of users --
they're targeting hundreds of thousands or millions of users."
</P>
<P>
The Mountain View-based company said the expansion will increase
its ability to process domain name system, or DNS, queries from
400 billion a day to more than 4 trillion a day. Those queries
occur every time Internet users click on ".com" or ".net" Web
sites or check e-mail and use applications that utilize those
domain names.
</P>
<P>
VeriSign said it currently processes 24 billion such interactions
daily, and it is preparing for dramatically higher activity as
more users get online worldwide and conduct more of their
business and leisure on the Web.
</P>
<P>
The investment also will boost bandwidth on VeriSign's systems
from more than 20 gigabits per second to more than 200 gigabits
per second.
</P>
<P>
The company promises reduced bottlenecks and ramped-up speed from
infrastructure that is more broadly distributed around the world.
</P>
<P>
But Sclavos said security is also a key element of the upgrade,
including the strengthening of security provisions and
engineering improvements to bolster the ability to identify and
track security threats around the globe.
</P>
<P>
"This is good for the whole Internet infrastructure," Sclavos
said. "If the Internet's infrastructure fails, hundreds of
billions of dollars in commerce and communications will be at
risk. We can't afford for that to happen."
</P>
<P>
Will Stofega, a research manager with market researcher IDC, said
the attacks this week that overwhelmed at least three of the 13
root servers highlight the growing threat posed by online
criminals.
</P>
<P>
He said the last major round of large upgrades occurred during
the dot-com boom and that VeriSign's investment could prod other
companies into following suit.
</P>
<P>
"This is a very timely investment," Stofega said. "In a couple of
years, we're going to start seeing some very, very serious types
of attacks. If we don't start making these types of investments
now, we're in trouble."
