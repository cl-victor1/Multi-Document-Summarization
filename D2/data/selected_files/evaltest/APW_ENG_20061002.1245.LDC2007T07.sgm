NICKEL MINES, Pennsylvania 2006-10-02 18:55:54 UTC

An armed man walked into an Amish school, sent the boys outside and
tied up and shot the girls, killing three of them, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
The gunman, Charles Carl Roberts IV, 32, a truck driver from the town
of Bart, apparently killed himself, state police Commissioner Jeffrey
B. Miller said.
</P>
<P>
Three children were found dead at the scene and seven others were
taken to hospitals, Miller said.
</P>
<P>
Roberts walked into the one-room West Nickel Mines Amish School with a
shotgun and handgun and barricaded himself inside after letting the
boys go, Miller said. The school has about 25 to 30 students, ages six
to 13, Miller said.

<P>
The suspect apparently called his wife from a cell phone shortly
before the shooting began, saying he was "acting out in revenge for
something that happened 20 years ago," Miller said. "It seems as
though he wanted to attack young, female victims."
</P>
<P>
Lancaster County Coroner G. Gary Kirchner told The Associated Press
early Monday afternoon that six people were killed. He later said he
was not sure of the number.
</P>
<P>
Two hours after the shooting, about three dozen people in traditional
Amish clothing, hats and bonnets stood near the small school building
speaking to one another, several young people and authorities.
</P>
<P>
The school is among farmlands just outside Nickel Mines, a tiny
village about 55 miles (88 kilometers) west of Philadelphia.
