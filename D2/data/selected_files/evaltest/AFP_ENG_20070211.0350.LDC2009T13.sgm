Mount Semeru in Indonesia's densely-populated East Java province
spewed ash at the weekend, coating a nearby town, but the volcano
does not pose any danger to residents, officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The ash rain fell on Saturday and Sunday but luckily we also
have had heavy rains, so the ash was quickly cleaned from the
surface," said Edi Susanto, an official from the Lumajang
district spokesman's office.
</P>
<P>
Winds had carried the ash from the 3,676-metre (12,277-foot)
Mount Semeru to the town of Lumajang, some 35 kilometers (22
miles) away.
</P>
<P>
Susanto said the ash rain that had coated everything in the town
was not a source of concern for local residents.
</P>
<P>
"We are quite used to ash rains as we live in such close
proximity with Mount Semeru," he said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia sits on the so-called "Pacific Ring of Fire", where
continental plates meet and cause frequent volcanic and seismic
activity.
