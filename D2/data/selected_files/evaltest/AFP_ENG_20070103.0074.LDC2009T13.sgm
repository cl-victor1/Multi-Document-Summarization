Indonesian navy battles storm to rescue ferry survivors
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Indonesian navy ships Wednesday battled storms and gale force
winds to rescue 13 survivors of a ferry disaster, with hundreds
still missing five days after the ship sank in a storm off Java
island.
</P>
<P>
"(Warship) KRI Hiu saved 13 survivors just south of Bawean island
today (Wednesday)," Central Java navy commander Colonel Yan
Simamora told AFP.
</P>
<P>
Bawean is 350 kilometres (220 miles) northeast of the Javanese
port of Semarang, the original destination of the ill-fated
ferry.
</P>
<P>
Navy ships, fishermen and search and rescue teams have found more
than 200 survivors since the ferry sank late Friday with some 600
people on board.
</P>
<P>
"So far there are 205 survivors and seven people found dead,"
Semarang port official Bagasto told AFP.
</P>
<P>
Three unidentified victims were buried Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The large wooden coffins were lowered into the ground in a simple
ceremony in Rembang, east of Semarang, television pictures
showed.
</P>
<P>
Survivors have been spotted on liferafts but bad weather and huge
waves have been hampering efforts to pluck them to safety after
days on the open sea.
</P>
<P>
Food and drinks have been dropped to them, attached to tyres.
</P>
<P>
"The weather is still relatively bad, with strong winds and
rain," Simamora said, stressing that the search would continue
despite the adverse conditions.
</P>
<P>
"We have seven navy ships, helicopters and Nomads (patrol
aircraft) currently searching the area as far east as north of
Madura island," just off Surabaya in East Java province, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meteorologists have warned that the bad weather and rough seas
will continue for the next few days, with waves of two to four
metres (six to 12 feet) high and strong winds.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary investigations show bad weather was to blame for the
accident, transport safety officials have said, as they continue
to collect data.
</P>
<P>
The "Senopati Nusantara" (Archipelago Commander) was en route
from Kumai on Borneo island to Semarang when it sank.
</P>
<P>
The vessel was carrying 542 passengers and 57 crew when it sank.
It was licensed to carry 850.
</P>
<P>
Ferries are a crucial link between the archipelago nation's
17,000 islands and frequently carry more people than officially
acknowledged.
