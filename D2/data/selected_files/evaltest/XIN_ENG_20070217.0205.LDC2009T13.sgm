NANCHANG, Feb. 18 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
The number of migratory birds in Poyang Lake, China's largest
freshwater lake, has dropped by 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to survey by the Jiangxi Bureau of Wildlife Protection,
the current number of birds staying by Poyang Lake over winter is
about 460,000, down from 730,000 last year.
</P>
<P>
Experts blamed the low water level of the 330,000-hectare lake
for the decrease. The lake's water level has been falling
continuously since last July as it supplies water to the drought-
stricken Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
A long drought in the upper reaches of the Yangtze saw the water
level in the middle reaches drop to their lowest point in more
than a century. The water level at 2 p.m. on Tuesday was just
7.48 meters, according to statistics from Xingzi Station of
Poyang Hydrological Center.
</P>
<P>
Poyang Lake in east China's Jiangxi Province is a reserve for
large flocks of rare migratory birds from north China and
Siberia, including white cranes, gray cranes and swans.
</P>
<P>
Experts estimate that the water shortage will not be alleviated
until March. The local authorities are building weirs to preserve
water and provide food for the birds.
