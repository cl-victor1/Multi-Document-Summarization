China's grain production up in 2006, but shortages still loom
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
China increased its grain production 2.8 percent to 497.46
million tonnes in 2006, but the world's most populous nation
still faces the prospect of shortages, state press reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Production last year was 13.46 million tonnes more than in 2005,
as annual grain output in China increased for the third year
running, but still short of the country's demand, the China Daily
said.
</P>
<P>
No break down was given on the differing grains. China also
includes legumes, such as beans, and oil bearing seeds, as part
of its grain statistics.
</P>
<P>
China faces the possibility of a 48 million tonne grain shortage
in 2010, equal to nearly nine percent of the country's grain
consumption, according to a recent study published by the ruling
Communist Party's central school.
</P>
<P>
The nation of 1.3 billion people needs to feed its growing
population but its arable land is increasingly being lost to
expanding cities and environmental degradation.
</P>
<P>
China had 105.38 million hectares of land for grain crops last
year, an increase of 1.1 million hectares over the previous year,
according to the latest statistics cited by the state news agency
Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
However, the country's arable land had shrunk from 131 million
hectares in 1996 to 123 million hectares in 2005.
</P>
<P>
Given the shrinking acreage, falling water tables and a growing
population, some grain experts have predicted that China will not
be able to raise yields per hectare and the nation will remain a
net food importer in the coming years.
