Soil erosion deteriorates in Xinjiang, affecting two thirds of
national territory

URUMQI, July 2 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
Soil erosion is deteriorating in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region as excessive herding and farming have outpaced
the government's conservation efforts.
</P>
<P>
A recent national remote sensing survey shows 1.03 million sq km
of land in Xinjiang suffered from soil erosion, including 20,000
sq km of the region's total 70,000 sq km of oasis.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang is blamed for nearly 30 percent of China's total acreage
of soil erosion, the regional water resources administration
said.
</P>
<P>
"The region has a vulnerable ecology. Besides the natural
factors, human activities are largely blamed for the
deteriorating soil erosion," said an official in charge of soil
conservation.
</P>
<P>
He pointed a finger to the excessive herding on the pastureland
and farming along the Tarim River, China's largest inland river
in the southern part of Xinjiang. "Irrational human activities
have far outpaced the government's soil conservation efforts,"
the official said on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
As a result, desertification is affecting 80 of Xinjiang's 90
counties and cities and nearly two thirds of its territory. At
least 12 million people are suffering the consequences, ranging
from drinking water shortages to cropland infertility.
</P>
<P>
The regional water resources administration said sand sediments
have taken up a third of the total storage capacity of local
reservoirs and at least one third of its arable land is
salinized.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, deserts are creeping at least 100 square kilometers
annually in Xinjiang, it said.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang has conducted three remote sensing surveys and set up a
monitoring network to track its soil erosion.
</P>
<P>
By diverting nearly 2.3 billion cubic meters of water to save the
endangered vegetation along the lower reaches of the Tarim River,
Xinjiang has improved the river ecology over the past six years.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 2005, the region has curbed soil erosion on more
than 7,400 sq km of land.
