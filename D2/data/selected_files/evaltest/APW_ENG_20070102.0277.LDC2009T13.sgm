Dozens of survivors who drifted at sea for three days were picked
up by fishing boats Tuesday after a ferry sunk in a storm off
central Indonesia, an official said.
</P>
<P>
Strong winds and poor visibility prevented search aircraft from
taking to the skies to search for about 400 people still missing,
but ships continued to patrol the waters off Java, near the site
where the boat went down.
</P>
<P>
Rescue teams were focused around Madura island, around 600
kilometers (375 miles) east of the capital, Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
"Heavy surf and high waves are still hampering our relief
efforts, but we believe many survivors are over there, they need
our help," said rescue worker Agus Anwari.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 200 have been found alive since the ferry sinking and
authorities say they will keep searching until Sunday. Thirteen
corpses have been recovered and scores of others have been
spotted floating at sea, officials said.
</P>
<P>
Survivor Susilo, 35, was picked up by fishermen and taken to a
hospital with chest pain and respiratory problems along with five
others after drifting in a life raft for four days.
</P>
<P>
"Six among us died, one by one, due to starvation, cold and after
drinking too much sea water," he said.
</P>
<P>
Another 27 survivors were rescued elsewhere off the Java coast
Tuesday. Air force planes have dropped food and water to some
survivors stranded in the Java Sea.
</P>
<P>
Weeping relatives camped out at a local hospital, and a temporary
morgue was being set up at a port close to where the crowded
passenger ship went down late Friday.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of body bags were being prepared.
</P>
<P>
The Senopati Nusantara sank after being pounded by heavy waves
for more than 10 hours as it neared the end of a two-day journey
from the Indonesian section of Borneo island to the country's
main island of Java.
</P>
<P>
Head of the search and rescue mission Jan Simamora said that high
winds and poor visibility had prevented helicopters and search
planes from taking to the air on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Harrowing tales about the ship's last moments continued to
emerge.
</P>
<P>
Waluyo, 50, recalled holding onto a large tire and seeing two of
his children lose their grip and drown.
</P>
<P>
"For 17 hours we held on, sometimes being turned over in the
swell, but one by one the people fell off, including my two
children," he said. "I could not do anything apart from pray."
Waluyo goes by a single name.
</P>
<P>
The ferry, which was built in Japan in 1992, had a capacity of
850 people. Officials say bad weather was the cause of the
accident.
</P>
<P>
Separately, a speed boat capsized in poor weather Monday night
off the coast of Borneo island, killing 15, officials said -- the
fourth deadly accident in less than a week in the vast
archipelago.
