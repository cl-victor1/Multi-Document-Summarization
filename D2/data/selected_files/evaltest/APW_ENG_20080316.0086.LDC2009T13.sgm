NEW YORK 2008-03-16 00:23:35 UTC

<P>
A crane mounted to the side of a skyscraper under construction
toppled with a roar, smashing into a block of apartment
buildings, killing at least four people and setting off a
scramble for survivors in the rubble.
</P>
<P>
The crane split into pieces as it fell Saturday, pulverizing a
four-story brownstone and demolishing parts of three other
buildings.
</P>
<P>
Mayor Michael Bloomberg said at least four people, believed to be
construction workers, have died and at least 10 people were
injured in one of the city's worst construction accidents in
recent memory.
</P>
<P>
The collapse created a virtual war zone on an affluent block on
Manhattan's East Side: Cars were overturned and crushed. A huge
dust cloud rose over the neighborhood. Rubble was piled several
stories high.
</P>
<P>
"It's a horrible situation, very gory. There's blood in the
street," said Lt. Gov. David Paterson, who takes over as governor
for disgraced Eliot Spitzer on Monday.
</P>
<P>
An intensive rescue operation was under way to find anyone
possibly trapped. One man was pulled from a collapsed townhouse 3
1/2 hours after the building was crushed.
</P>
<P>
Fire Commissioner Nicholas Scoppetta said the rescue was "a
painstaking hand operation, as we try to remove the rubble so we
don't cause further collapse or injure anyone who may still be in
that building." He said the operation would continue all night if
necessary, including the use of search dogs and thermal-imaging
and listening devices.
</P>
<P>
John LaGreco, who owns Fubar in the crushed building, said he
feared one of his employees was dead inside.
</P>
<P>
"Our bar is done," he said. "The crane crashed the whole
building. If I wasn't watching a Yankees game, I would've come to
work early and gotten killed."
</P>
<P>
About 19 of the planned 44-story condominium had been erected,
and the crane was scheduled to be extended Saturday so workers
could start work on a fresh story, said an owner of the company
that manages the construction site on 51st Street near 2nd
Avenue.
</P>
<P>
A piece of steel fell and sheared off one of the ties holding it
to the building, causing it to detach and topple, said Stephen
Kaplan, an owner of the Reliance Construction Group.
</P>
<P>
"It was an absolute freak accident," Kaplan said. "All the piece
of steel had to do was fall slightly left or right, and nothing
would have happened."
</P>
<P>
Kaplan said the company had subcontracted the work to different
companies and was not in charge of the crane. Phone messages and
an e-mail left for the crane company were not immediately
returned.
</P>
<P>
Neighborhood residents said they had complained to the city
several times about the construction at the site, saying crews
worked illegal hours and the building was going up too fast.
</P>
<P>
City Building Department records showed that on March 4, a caller
told officials that the upper portions of the crane appeared to
lack the proper number of safety ties attaching it to the
building.
</P>
<P>
A city inspector visited the site and determined on March 6 that
no violation was warranted.
</P>
<P>
Another call questioning the crane's safety was dismissed as
unwarranted by another inspector in February.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, nearby residents reported hearing a terrible roar as
the structure detached from the condominium.
</P>
<P>
"First I heard a rumble, and it increased, and then it
increased," said Bill Reilly, who lives a block away. "It
continued building in strength until there was a final vroom! It
shook the six-story brick building that I live in."
