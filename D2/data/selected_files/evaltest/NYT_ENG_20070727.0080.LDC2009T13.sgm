VICK DESERVES A POODLE IN HIS SHORTS

AUSTIN, Texas -- If you're a betting man, you're probably
wondering what the over/under is on Michael Vick, the star
quarterback for the Atlanta Falcons.
</P>
<P>
I'd say his NFL career will be over in under a year.
</P>
<P>
See, the feds are charging Vick with holding pit bull dog fights
on his property in rural Virginia. Remember the good old days
when football bad boys got busted for simple stuff like bouncing
topless dancers on their laps? Well, those halcyon Norman
Rockwell days are gone. The charges on Vick say dogs who were too
scared to fight were tortured, shot, drowned, hanged or
electrocuted.
</P>
<P>
So much for Vick getting a gig endorsing Purina Dog Chow.
</P>
<P>
I can think of a few things Vick could do other than torturing
dogs that would make himself and the NFL look worse. But I won't
mention them here because I don't want to ruin your breakfast.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the NFL has ordered Vick to stay away from the
Falcons' training camp. Who could blame them? It's hard to work
out when PETA is pelting your helmet with eggs.
</P>
<P>
Every time one of these dog-fighting stories pops up, people
blame the pit bulls. I lived next to a pit bull for about 10
years, and she was a sweet old thing. See, the trouble with pit
bulls isn't the pit bulls. It's the entourage they attract. Pit
bulls are goober magnets. As trailer homes are to tornadoes, so
are pit bulls to rednecks. Bring home a couple of pit bulls, and
soon someone will be cooking a whole hog in your front yard. And
the banjo music will commence.
</P>
<P>
To stop the dog fighting, maybe the NFL should establish a weight
ceiling on dog ownership that tops out at, say, Pomeranian.
</P>
<P>
Early in the investigation, Vick claimed innocence by saying he
didn't know what was going on on his property. That's a little
tough to swallow, isn't it? The grounds have dog pens all over
the place, and the buildings on the property are painted black.
</P>
<P>
He didn't notice the black paint? Did he think there was a teen
goth convention going on back there?
</P>
<P>
You know, I've never really figured out why anybody would want to
go to a dog fight. OK, so I do sort of understand the appeal.
It's a macho thing taken part in by guys who are living their
lives vicariously through critters who get to spend the day
scratching themselves in public and eating off the floor.
</P>
<P>
So they're jealous.
</P>
<P>
But the fact that dog fights exist proves people will bet on just
about anything.
</P>
<P>
Which makes you wonder: What was the first bet ever made? I can
think of several possibilities:
</P>
<P>
-- How long do you suppose she's going to put up with his
garbage?
</P>
<P>
-- ?Do you think he's really going to eat that oyster?
</P>
<P>
-- ?Is you is, or is you ain't, my baby?
</P>
<P>
-- Do you think he can really get that sofa through the front
door of that cave?
</P>
<P>
-- Do you think that thing is really going to roll?
</P>
<P>
-- I'll take the woolly mammoth and the points.
</P>
<P>
-- If we throw it in the water, do you think it'll sink?
</P>
<P>
But I doubt if the first bet ever was placed on a dog fight.
Although I'll betcha Michael Vick is going to do some time.
