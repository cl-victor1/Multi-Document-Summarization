SEC seeks to salvage assets of NY financier

The implosion of a Wall Street firm whose owner is accused in a
$50 billion swindle left regulators scrambling to seize control
of its assets Friday as dozens of investors worried that they had
gone from rich to poor overnight.
</P>
<P>
The collapse of Bernard L. Madoff's company came just hours
before his arrest Thursday on a single securities fraud count.
Madoff, who allegedly told his employees he was running a "giant
(pyramid) scheme," was freed on $10 million bail.
</P>
<P>
Officials with the Securities and Exchange Commission were due in
federal court Friday after a judge put a temporary hold on some
assets of the firm until a court-appointed receiver could take
control of its finances.
</P>
<P>
Fear ran deep for investors in Bernard L. Madoff Investment
Securities LLC. Stephen A. Weiss, who said he had spoken to at
least 30 of them, said some entrusted all of their savings to
Madoff, who had delivered steady returns for decades.
</P>
<P>
"They were living comfortable lives and serene retirements and by
the late afternoon their lives were thrown into a spiral of
horror," Weiss said. "These people are panicked. These people are
sorrowful. These people are angry. And many are now destitute."
</P>
<P>
One investor, Lawrence Velvel, 69, dean of the Massachusetts
School of Law, said he and a friend may have lost millions of
dollars between them.
</P>
<P>
"This is a major disaster for a lot of people," Velvel said in a
telephone interview from his Andover, Massachusetts, office. "You
work all your life, you finally manage to save up something, and
somebody who's entrusted with it, it turns out suddenly he's a
crook. Lots of people are getting fully or partially wiped out."
</P>
<P>
Velvel said he wants to know where government regulators, as well
as accountants and others at Madoff's company, were when the
money was being lost.
</P>
<P>
According to a criminal complaint filed with the court, Madoff
told senior employees of his firm Wednesday that he had blown
more than $50 billion with fraudulent financial moves, that he
was "finished" and that he had "absolutely nothing." The FBI said
Friday that family members turned Madoff in after he confessed
his fraud to them.
</P>
<P>
Madoff's lawyer, Dan Horwitz, said his client was "a longstanding
leader in the financial-services industry with an unblemished
record" and would "fight to get through this unfortunate event."
</P>
<P>
Madoff, a former Nasdaq stock market chairman, founded his firm
in 1960, using $5,000 he earned in part as a lifeguard on Long
Island beaches. In the industry, he had a reputation for safe
investments and steady returns that made individual investors
eager to place their money with him and competitors suspicious of
his success.
</P>
<P>
Marc Powers, a former SEC enforcement branch chief and head of
the securities practice at Baker Hostetler, said Madoff was "a
very well respected, highly regarded person" on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
"Everybody heard of him," he said, noting his firm had received
calls from investors Friday worried about their future. "There's
a shell shock that's going on now. This ruins people's lives. It
destroys whatever they built up over 40 years at the hands of a
person they trusted."
</P>
<P>
Velvel said he listened to Madoff's employees explain how the
firm made profits in good times and bad through computerized
trading on blue-chip stocks and options, enabling small and
steady profits on scores of trades.
</P>
<P>
"It made all the bloody sense in the world," he said. "The way we
understood, they never went for the big hits. If you take a
percent here, a half percent there, this can add up to what
Madoff was saying."
