British Foreign Secretary David Miliband on Tuesday condemned the
near- simultaneous bombings in the Indian city of Jaipur that
killed at least 80 people.
</P>
<P>
"Today's bombings in Jaipur have shown again the horrific
destruction which terrorism brings," Miliband said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
"My thoughts are with the families of the victims and with those
injured. There can never be any justification for acts of
indiscriminate violence such as these, and I utterly condemn
those who have perpetrated today's attacks."
</P>
<P>
Seven blasts occurred within minutes of each other, tearing apart
markets, in what Indian police described as a "terror attack."
</P>
<P>
Miliband said Britain "stands and will continue to stand with the
government and people of India against terrorism in all its
manifestations."
