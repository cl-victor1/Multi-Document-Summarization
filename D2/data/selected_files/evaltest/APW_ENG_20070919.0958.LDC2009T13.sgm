A judge set bail Wednesday at $125,000 (euro89,445) for O.J.
Simpson in the former football star's alleged role in the armed
robbery of sports memorabilia collectors at a Las Vegas hotel.

Simpson, standing in a blue jail uniform and handcuffs, furrowed
his brow as the judge read the list of charges against him.

He answered quietly in a hoarse voice and nodded as Justice of
the Peace Joe Bonaventure Jr. detailed charges of kidnapping and
robbery and laid out restrictions for his release. He did not
enter a plea.
