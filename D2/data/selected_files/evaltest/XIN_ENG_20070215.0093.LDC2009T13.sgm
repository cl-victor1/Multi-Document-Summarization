MADRID, Feb. 15 (Xinhua)

<P>
Rabei Ousmane Sayed Ahmed, an alleged mastermind of the train
bombings on March 11, 2004, in Madrid, on Thursday rejected all
charges against him.

<P>
"I don't recognise any of the accusations or any of the
denunciations," he said when appearing at a heavily-guarded
courtroom.

Ahmed, also known as "Mohamed the Egyptian," was accused of
inciting people to carry out the deadliest al-Qaida related
attacks in Europe, which killed 191 and injured about 2,000
people.

Twenty Arab men and nine Spaniards face charges that range from
belonging to a terrorist group to stealing dynamite to sell to
the bombers as the trial opens weeks before the third anniversary
of the March 11 bombings.
