BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
China needs a law on organ transplant to regulate donation
procedures, and encourage and facilitate people to become donors,
lawmakers said on the sidelines of the annual full session of the
National People's Congress (NPC).
</P>
<P>
NPC deputy Li Bangliang, board chairman of East China
Pharmaceutical Group Corporation, said a proper law is needed to
guide the public how to donate their organs if they have such an
intention.
</P>
<P>
"With a large number of organs in need, some people want to
donate but often run into difficulties in the application
process, " said Li, adding a specific law should be enacted to
standardize the application and transplant process."
</P>
<P>
China is faced with a huge gap between the patients who need
functional organs and limited donations. About 1.5 million
patients need organ transplant each year, but only 10,000 can
find organs for transplant, according to statistics from the
Ministry of Health.
</P>
<P>
Most organs were donated by ordinary citizens upon their death
after the voluntary signing of donation agreements. It is
strictly prohibited in China for illegal organ transplant, said
Huang Jiefu, China's vice health minister.
</P>
<P>
Experts believe that the concept of dead-brain declaration will
greatly promote organ transplant.
</P>
<P>
However, Chinese people's traditional view of "living till the
last breath" has restrained living human organ supply, said NPC
deputy Chen Haixiao, head of Taizhou Hospital in China's eastern
Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
"Social customs are a big reason," said Chen, explaining that
many Chinese are unwilling to donate organs because they consider
the stop of breath and heartbeat the standard of death.
</P>
<P>
He suggested the law allow doctors to declare people brain dead
so their organs can be used to save the lives of people suffering
the prostration of an organ.
</P>
<P>
"It will benefit many patients if the public can take the
donation as a charity," said Chen.
</P>
<P>
Actually, the Ministry of Health in 2006 drafted a set of
regulations on human organ transplant to the State Council for
revision and improvement.
