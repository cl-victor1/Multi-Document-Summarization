RAMALLAH, Feb. 4 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian National Authority (PNA) on Monday condemned a
suicide bombing which rocked a shopping mall in southern Israel
and killed an Israeli woman.
</P>
<P>
The PNA "renews its firm position which condemns every operation
that targets the civilians whether they were Palestinians or
Israelis", a PNA spokesman told the official Wafa news agency.
</P>
<P>
An Israeli woman was killed and 11 others were wounded in the
suicide bombing at a shopping mall in southern Israel town of
Dimona, the first of its kind on the Israeli soil in more than
one year.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also condemned the killing of two Islamic Jihad
fighters by Israeli troops in the West Bank city of Jenin on
Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas' Fatah
movement denied any involvement of Fatah's military wing al-Aqsa
Martyrs Brigades in the explosion, but media reports quoted a
spokesman for the military group as claiming its responsibility
in the incident in collaboration with the Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine (PFLP).
</P>
<P>
"The side which stands behind this attack is known for its hard-
line stances which reject any calmness that may help the peace
process," said the Fatah spokesman, implicitly referring to
Islamic Hamas movement.
</P>
<P>
For its part, Hamas praised the attack, saying it was a natural
response to the Israeli siege and offensive on the Hamas-run Gaza
Strip.
</P>
<P>
"Hamas hails this martyrdom operation and calls on the armed
groups to go ahead in this way," said Hamas spokesman Sami Abu
Zuhri in a statement sent to the media.
