Iraqi Journalist Hurls Shoes at Bush
</HEADLINE>

Al-Maliki missed, but so did the shoe, landing like the first one
with a loud thud against the wall behind the two leaders, who
held their ground as other journalists and security officials
wrestled the shoe-thrower to the ground. Later, Iraqi journalists
identified him as Muntadar al-Zeidi, a correspondent for Al-
Baghdadia, a satellite TV channel that broadcasts from Cairo,
Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Colleagues said al-Zeidi has done extensive reporting from Sadr
City, the stronghold of anti-U.S. cleric Muqtada al-Sadr, and was
rescued by Sadr's Mahdi Army militia after being abducted by an
unidentified group in November 2007.
</P>
<P>
Al-Zeidi was one of several Iraqi journalists attending the
Sunday evening news conference inside Baghdad's heavily secured
International Zone. His outburst came without warning as Bush and
al-Maliki prepared to answer questions. The first shoe flew over
the heads of other journalists and might have hit Bush square in
the face had the lame-duck president not ducked.

<P>
"This is a gift from the Iraqis. This is the farewell kiss, you
dog," the man said, according to a pool translation.
</P>
<P>
Seconds later, the journalist hurled his other shoe with similar
precision as another Iraqi journalist reached over in an attempt
to stop him. "This is from the widows, the orphans and those who
were killed in Iraq," he said.
</P>
<P>
After being pinned to the ground, the shoe-thrower was dragged
out by security guards. Officials from Al-Baghdadia refused to
comment. White House press secretary Dana Perino reported
suffering a minor eye injury during the melee.
</P>
<P>
Bush himself played down the incident.
</P>
<P>
"All I can report is it is a size 10," he said jokingly.
</P>
<P>
"So what if a guy threw his shoe at me," the president added,
dismissing it as "one way to gain attention."
</P>
<P>
Times special correspondents in Baghdad contributed to this
report.
