Floods kill 100, displace millions in SAsia

<P>
Millions of people have fled their homes in India, Bangladesh and
Nepal on Monday as the death toll in the past week from floods
triggered by heavy monsoon rains topped 100, officials said.
</P>
<P>
More than 22 people have died in Nepal, 13 others lost their
lives in Bangladesh and the toll has risen to about 70 in north
and northeastern India, where meteorologists have warned of more
rain in the next 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
"The situation has turned devastating overnight, drowning five
more people in separate incidents and displacing another three
million," said Bhumidhar Barman, relief and rehabilitation
minister in northeastern Assam state.
</P>
<P>
The water levels in all major rivers and their tributaries in the
state were well above the danger mark, authorities said in a
bulletin.
</P>
<P>
Indian air force helicopters were on stand-by to deliver food and
other essentials to some four million displaced people as the
Brahmaputra River -- one of the longest in Asia at 2,900
kilometres (1,800 miles) -- swelled.
</P>
<P>
The Brahmaputra is usually in full flood in the summer from
monsoon rains and melting glaciers as it crosses Tibet, India and
Bangladesh before emptying into the Bay of Bengal.
</P>
<P>
Soldiers used rubber boats and rafts to evacuate trapped
residents, as communication and transport links across the area
were badly disrupted.
</P>
<P>
A team of doctors and paramedics was sent to the flood-hit areas
by boat and raft to treat people suffering from water-borne
diseases.
</P>
<P>
"We have also sent veterinarians along with adequate cattle and
poultry feed in several areas," Barman said.
</P>
<P>
The worst-hit part of Assam was eastern Dhemaji district, where
an estimated 250,000 people had taken refuge in makeshift
shelters on raised embankments, in government schools and
offices.
</P>
<P>
In the past week, 20 people have died in Assam and neighbouring
Meghalaya states, while another 50 people have been killed in
northern Bihar and Uttar Pradesh states, according to official
figures.
</P>
<P>
In Bangladesh, where about 675,000 villagers have fled their
homes, the flood watch centre said the situation could worsen,
with the country's central regions at risk of major flooding in
the next two days.
</P>
<P>
"The flood situation in northern Bangladesh has been aggravated
overnight. Water levels of both the Ganges and the Brahmaputra
have increased, inundating vast new areas," disaster management
secretary Dhiraj Malakar said.
</P>
<P>
Malakar said thousands of military, government and volunteer
groups had been mobilised to evacuate people and distribute food,
relief and medical aid to those affected by the disaster.
</P>
<P>
The state-owned BSS news agency said at least three more people
had died from snakebites and drowning at the weekend, taking the
reported death toll from the floods to 13.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh is criss-crossed by a network of 230 rivers and
suffers annual floods with at least a fifth of the country
submerged each year.
</P>
<P>
In 2004, flooding killed more than 700 people and 38 percent of
the country was under water, forcing millions to flee their
homes. In Assam, at least 200 people were killed and more than 12
million displaced the same year.
</P>
<P>
In Nepal, about 70 people have been killed in floods since the
monsoon season began last month, officials said.
