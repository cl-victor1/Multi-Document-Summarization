Internet design challenges lead to work on rebuilding network

Government and university researchers have been exploring ways to
redesign the Internet from scratch. Some of the challenges that
led researchers to start thinking of clean-slate approaches:
</P>
<P>
SECURITY
</P>
<P>
THE CHALLENGE: The Internet was designed to be open and flexible,
and all users were assumed to be trustworthy. Thus, the
Internet's protocols were not designed to authenticate users and
their data, allowing spammers and hackers to easily cover their
tracks by attaching fake return addresses onto data packets.
</P>
<P>
THE CURRENT FIX: Internet applications such as firewalls and spam
filters attempt to control security threats. But because such
techniques do not penetrate deep into the network, bad data still
get passed along, clogging systems and possibly fooling the
filtering technology.
</P>
<P>
THE CLEAN-SLATE SOLUTION: The network would have to be redesigned
to be skeptical of all users and data packets from the start.
Data would not be passed along unless the packets are
authenticated. Faster computers today should be able to handle
the additional processing required within the network.
</P>
<P>
MOBILITY
</P>
<P>
THE CHALLENGE: Computers rarely moved, so numeric Internet
addresses were assigned to devices based on their location. A
laptop, on the other hand, is constantly on the move.
</P>
<P>
THE CURRENT FIX: A laptop changes its address and reconnects as
it moves from one wireless access point to another, disrupting
data flow. Another workaround is to have all traffic channel back
to the first access point as a laptop moves to a second or a
third location, but delays could result from the extra distance.
</P>
<P>
THE CLEAN-SLATE SOLUTION: The address system would have to be
restructured so that addresses are based more on the device and
less on the location. This way, a laptop could retain its address
as it hops through multiple hot spots.
</P>
<P>
UBIQUITY
</P>
<P>
THE CHALLENGE: The Internet was designed when there were
relatively few computers connecting to it. The proliferation of
personal computers and mobile devices led to a scarcity in the
initial address system. There will be even more demand for
addresses as toasters, air conditioners and other devices come
with Internet capability, as will standalone sensors for
measuring everything from the temperature to the availability of
parking spaces.
</P>
<P>
THE CURRENT FIX: Engineers expanded the address pool with a
system called IPv6, but nearly a decade after most of the
groundwork was completed, the vast majority of software and
hardware still use the older, more crowded IPv4 technology. Even
if more migrate to IPv6, processing the addresses for all the
sensors could prove taxing.
</P>
<P>
THE CLEAN-SLATE SOLUTION: Researchers are questioning whether all
devices truly need addresses. Perhaps sensors in a home could
talk to one another locally and relay the most important data
through a gateway bearing an address. This way, the Internet's
traffic cops, known as routers, wouldn't have to keep track of
every single sensor, improving efficiency.
