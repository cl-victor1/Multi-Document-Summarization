Owner of hijacked Saudi tanker says crew safe

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates 2008-11-18 08:59:35 UTC
</P>
<P>
The owner of a Saudi oil supertanker hijacked by Somali pirates
over the weekend said the 25 crew members are safe and the ship
is fully loaded with crude -- a cargo worth about $100 million at
current prices.
</P>
<P>
Dubai-based Vela International Marine Ltd., a subsidiary of Saudi
oil company Aramco, said in a statement Monday that company
response teams have been set up and are working to ensure the
release of the crew and the vessel.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Navy said the MV Sirius Star was seized far off the
coast of Kenya on Saturday and that the bandits were taking the
ship to a Somali port known as a hub of pirate activity.
</P>
<P>
However, the statement posted on Vela's Web site late Monday said
the ship was hijacked Sunday. The discrepancy could not
immediately be explained.
</P>
<P>
Attacks by Somali pirates have surged this year as bandits have
become bolder, better armed and capable of operating hundreds of
miles from shore.
</P>
<P>
A coalition of warships from eight nations, as well as from NATO
and the U.S. Navy's 5th Fleet, is patrolling a critical zone in
the Gulf of Aden leading to and from the Suez Canal. That's where
most of the more than 80 attacks this year have occurred.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi tanker, however, was seized far to the south of the
patrolled zone, about 450 nautical miles (833 kilometers)
southeast of Mombasa, Kenya, according the U.S. Navy.
</P>
<P>
Maritime security experts said they have tracked a southward
spread in piracy over the last several weeks into a vast area of
the Indian Ocean, noting with alarm that the area would be almost
impossible to patrol.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Navy's 5th Fleet said Tuesday it was monitoring the
situation but didn't expect to send warships to surround the
vessel as it has done with a Ukrainian ship loaded with tanks and
other weaponry the was seized off the Somali coast on Sept. 25
and remains in pirate hands.
</P>
<P>
"I don't anticipate any U.S. ships on station," said Lt. Nathan
Christensen, a spokesman for the 5th Fleet, speaking from its
headquarters in Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
He would not elaborate on how the Navy was watching the hijacked
tanker.
</P>
<P>
"We remain deeply concerned because this attack represents a
fundamental change in pirates' ability to hijack bigger vessels
farther out at sea," Christensen said.
</P>
<P>
The Sirius Star is the largest ship ever taken by Somali pirates,
though large chemical tankers and freighters have also been
hijacked.
</P>
<P>
It is "the largest pirated vessel in the region" to date,
Christensen said.
</P>
<P>
At 1,080 feet (329 meters), it is the length of an aircraft
carrier and can carry about 2 million barrels of oil.
</P>
<P>
"We are very concerned that a (ship) of this size has been
hijacked. We have safety concerns, security concerns,
environmental concerns," said Noel Choong, the head of the
International Maritime Bureau's regional piracy center in Kuala
Lumpur, Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
"Of course, as long as there is no firm deterrent, pirates will
continue to attack. The risk is low and returns are extremely
high. You will see more and more of such attacks," he told The
Associated Press on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Vela, the ship's owner and operator, is one of the largest crude
oil tanker companies in the world.
</P>
<P>
Including the Sirius Star, Vela owns and operates a fleet of 19
vessels classed as Very Large Crude Oil Carriers. It uses the
ships to transport supplies primarily between the Middle East,
Europe and the U.S. Gulf Coast, according to the company's Web
site.
</P>
<P>
The Sirius Star was sailing under a Liberian flag and its crew
includes citizens of Croatia, Britain, the Philippines, Poland
and Saudi Arabia. A British Foreign Office spokesman said there
were at least two British nationals on board.
