Fishery officials to push for global tracking of world ' s tuna
catch at Japan conference

International fisheries officials are expected to push for a
global tracking system that would certify the origin of every
tuna headed to market at an unprecedented conference that
convenes Monday to reverse a sharp decline in tuna catches.
</P>
<P>
The conference brings together the world's regional tuna
management groups and runs through Friday in the western city of
Kobe. It is seen as a key step in combatting the downturn in one
of the most valuable and endangered high seas fisheries.
</P>
<P>
Attendees, representing the commercial fishing industry as well
as government regulators, will seek the creation of a framework
requiring fishermen worldwide to produce certificates of origin
for all species of tuna they catch, Kyodo News reported Sunday,
citing a draft action plan for the meeting. Doing so would help
clamp down on excessive or illegal fishing, it said.
</P>
<P>
Requiring certificates of origin for all tuna would expand the
conservation programs already under way in some regions, which
cover certain threatened species such as bluefin tuna, Kyodo
reported, without saying how it got the draft or who wrote it.
</P>
<P>
The draft also calls for a monitoring system that would track the
tuna catch from the open sea to the fish market.
</P>
<P>
The recommendations echo those of the World Wildlife Fund, which
released a position statement before the meeting calling for a
"global catch identification system," according to the Australian
Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
This week's meeting is being hosted by Japan, one of the world's
biggest tuna consumers and a frequent target of conservationists
who accuse its fleets of overfishing. The tuna talks will for the
first time bring together the five so-called regional fishery
management organizations, including the oversight bodies for tuna
fishing in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans.
</P>
<P>
The discussions are also expected to focus on ways the regional
groups can better share information.
</P>
<P>
By 2004, the number of adult Atlantic bluefin tuna capable of
spawning had plummeted to roughly 19 percent of its 1975 level in
the western half of the ocean, according to the International
Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas.
</P>
<P>
Overfishing and illegal fishing is often cited as the cause.
</P>
<P>
In October, the Commission for the Conservation of Southern
Bluefin Tuna agreed at a meeting in Miyazaki, Japan, to reduce
the global catch of the endangered southern bluefin tuna by more
than 20 percent for 2007.
</P>
<P>
At that meeting, Japan also promised to halve its quota for the
southern bluefin tuna as punishment for overfishing, but denied
allegations it has poached thousands of tons of the endangered
species every year.
</P>
<P>
Concern has been growing about overfishing of tuna and other fish
species. In November, a study in the journal Science warned that
if current trends of overfishing and pollution continue, the
populations of just about all seafood face collapse by 2048.
