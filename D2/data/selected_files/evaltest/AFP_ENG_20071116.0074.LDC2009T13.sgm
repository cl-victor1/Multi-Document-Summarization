The United States expressed "its deepest sympathy" for the
victims of the cyclone that struck Bangladesh as it took part in
international efforts to provide emergency relief.

"The United States government would like to express its deepest
sympathy for the victims of the cyclone," US State Department
spokesman Sean McCormack said, reading a statement.

"We're ready to work with the (Bangladesh) government and foreign
donors to assist in relieving the effects of the disaster," he
added.

Hundreds of people died and tens of thousands were left homeless
after a powerful cyclone smashed impoverished Bangladesh with
huge waves, severe winds and torrential rains, officials said
Friday.

Cyclone Sidr, described as the worst storm in years to hit low-
lying and disaster-prone Bangladesh, crashed into the
southwestern coast Thursday night before sweeping north over the
capital Dhaka.

The statement said the impact of the storm was mitigated by US
stockpiles of emergency supplies as well as shelters and wave
barriers that US aid projects had set up in Bangladesh in recent
years.

"The storm's damage is significant, but with the measures already
in place and post-relief activities ongoing, the United States is
actively and quickly assisting Bangladesh in the recovery
process," it said.

"Upon hearing of the impending storm, the US Mission in
Bangladesh took immediate action to pre-position required
supplies and equipment," the statement said.

<P>
"Sixteen zodiac boats were ready to use for emergency operations.
Six water treatment systems were mobilized. Ten water ambulances
were available," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"With partners CARE and Save the Children 30,000 Emergency
Survival Packages were pre-positioned in areas facing the
oncoming cyclone and food commodities were pre-positioned for
emergency response," it added.
