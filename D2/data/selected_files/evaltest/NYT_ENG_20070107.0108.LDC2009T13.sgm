Polar bears are the kings of the Arctic, having adapted to an
environment where few predators can survive. Yet with global
warming, these kings are watching their kingdom melt away.
</P>
<P>
According to NASA, the Arctic Ocean has lost about 20 percent of
its sea ice since the 1970s, an area of 502,000 square miles --
twice the size of Texas. Polar bears depend on sea ice so they
can travel and float to hunt seal and to reach coastal areas off
Greenland, Canada, Alaska, Russia and Scandinavia.
</P>
<P>
With the loss of sea ice, the worldwide population of polar bears
-- estimated at about 20,000 to 25,000 -- has steadily declined.
The most studied population, in the West Hudson Bay of Canada,
dropped 22 percent from 1987 to 2004. Some scientists project a
further 30 percent decline by midcentury as Earth continues to
warm.

Faced with incontrovertible evidence that polar bears are
imperiled, Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne agreed recently to
designate polar bears as threatened under the Endangered Species
Act. The designation means the federal government must come up
with a recovery plan for bears in its jurisdiction off the coasts
of Alaska. It is a rare acknowledgement by the administration
that global warming is already causing wide environmental
impacts, particularly in polar regions.
</P>
<P>
Yet it is a half-baked acknowledgment. In a conference call to
reporters, Kempthorne said his department is not taking a
position on why the ice is melting or what to do about it. "That
whole aspect of climate change is beyond the scope of the
Endangered Species Act," the Interior secretary said.
</P>
<P>
This is nonsense. There is no way administration officials can
hope to help the polar bear population to recover if its
officials do not acknowledge the science of global warming --
that industrial emissions are altering the atmosphere and
contributing to rapid warming in the polar regions and elsewhere.
While U.S. officials have limited ability to do much by
themselves to slow and reverse this warming, it is long past time
for them to take the blinders off and lead a global effort to
reduce emissions.
