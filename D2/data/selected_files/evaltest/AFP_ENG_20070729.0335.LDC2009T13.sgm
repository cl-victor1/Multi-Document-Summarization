200,000 marooned in northern Bangladesh floods

<P>
At least 200,000 people have been marooned in northern
Bangladesh, as monsoon rains and snow melt from the Himalayas hit
the flood-prone nation, state-run media said.
</P>
<P>
The military has begun to evacuate people and distribute relief
as major rivers burst their banks and inundated low areas in the
north, the state-run BSS news agency said.
</P>
<P>
Unconfirmed reports said at least 10 people have so far died of
drowning and snake-bites in the area. Last month, landslides
triggered by heavy rains killed at least 126 people in
southeastern city of Chittagong on the bay of Bengal.
</P>
<P>
The government's flood forecasting and warning centre said the
situation could worsen in the next few days as major monsoon and
Himalayan-glacier fed rivers -- the Ganges and the Brahmaputra
that flow through Bangladesh -- are expected to crest.
</P>
<P>
The Brahmaputra, the source of two-thirds of river water in the
country, was flowing at least 25 centimetres (one foot) above
danger levels, the centre said.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh is criss-crossed by a network of 230 rivers and
suffers annual floods with at least a fifth of the country
inundated each year.
</P>
<P>
In July and August in 2004 flooding left more than 700 people
dead and 38 percent of the country submerged, forcing millions to
flee their homes.
