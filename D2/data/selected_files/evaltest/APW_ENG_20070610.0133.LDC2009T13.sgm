Report: China forcing Tibetan nomads to settle in towns,
disrupting traditional life

China is forcing nomadic Tibetan herders to settle in towns to
clear land for development, leaving many unable to earn a living,
a human rights group said in a report issued Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Herders have been forced to slaughter herds of yaks, sheep and
goats and Communist officials have paid minimal compensation and
failed to protect Tibetans' legal rights, Human Rights Watch
said. It said tens of thousands, and possibly hundreds of
thousands, of people have been affected.
</P>
<P>
The group appealed to Beijing to suspend the resettlements until
a review system is put in place and to allow Tibetans to return
to their land if they were forcibly moved or received no
compensation.
</P>
<P>
"They are destroying our Tibetan (herder) communities by not
letting us live in our area and thus wiping out our livelihood
completely," one Tibetan, identified only by the initials F.R.,
was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Human Rights Watch said the resettlements in Tibet and in
adjacent ethnic Tibetan areas of Sichuan, Gansu and Qinghai
provinces are linked to Beijing's effort, launched in 1999, to
develop China's poor, restive west and bind it to the bustling
east.
</P>
<P>
China's foreign ministry and the local governments of Tibet and
the provinces cited did not respond to requests by phone and fax
for comment.
</P>
<P>
The resettlements began in 2000 and have taken place more
intensively since 2003, Human Rights Watch said.
</P>
<P>
"Many Tibetan herders have been required to slaughter most of
their livestock and move into newly built housing colonies in or
near towns, abandoning their traditional way of life," the report
said.
</P>
<P>
"Many Tibetan agricultural communities have had their land
confiscated, with minimal compensation, or have been evicted to
make way for mining, infrastructure projects or urban
development," the report said.
</P>
<P>
The most extreme efforts were in Sichuan's Golok region, where
authorities banned grazing in 2003 and required herders to sell
their herds and move into newly built townships, Human Rights
Watch said, citing interviews with Tibetans who were affected.
</P>
<P>
It quoted one as saying: "Even if we become town dwellers and try
to do business, we don't have the education or the experience to
succeed. We don't even know how to live from farming. So in
future we will face great difficulty."
</P>
<P>
Chinese authorities explained the changes as a response to
overgrazing by Tibetan herds that was causing erosion and soil
loss, Human Rights Watch said.
