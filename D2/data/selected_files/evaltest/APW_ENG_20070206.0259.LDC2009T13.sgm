China lacks resources to cut critical emissions, official says

<P>
China is concerned about global warming but lacks the money and
technology to significantly reduce its own greenhouse gas
emissions that are worsening the problem, a top government
scientist said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
China is the world's biggest consumer and producer of coal, and
is expected to surpass the United States as the world's No. 1
greenhouse gas emitter in the next decade.
</P>
<P>
It wants to reduce its dependence on coal but converting to
cleaner energies on a mass scale would be prohibitively costly
for China, which is still a developing economy.
</P>
<P>
It also "lags behind Europe and the United States" in the
technology needed to burn cleaner coal, which accounts for 69
percent of its energy output, said Qin Dahe, chief of the China
Meteorological Administration, and an adviser to the government
on climate change.
</P>
<P>
"It takes time to catch up," he said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
Qin served as one of China's representatives to the United
Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which last
week announced that global warming is very likely caused by
mankind and that climate change will continue for centuries.
</P>
<P>
He said China agreed with and was concerned about the report's
conclusions. China, like the rest of the world, will increasingly
face problems of extreme temperatures, rising sea levels, drought
and more intense typhoons because of the effects of global
warming, he said.
</P>
<P>
Qin's comments come as winter temperatures in China's capital
have hit a 30-year high, state media said.
</P>
<P>
Qin and other scientists are preparing to brief the central
government on climate change based on the findings of the UN
study. They would recommend that China invest more in research
and observation of weather patterns and climate change and
promote environmental awareness, Qin said.
</P>
<P>
He said the central government had already set a "very ambitious
and arduous goal" of reducing carbon dioxide and other emissions
by 4 percent a year over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
The central government is "very serious about the commitment and
has firmly demanded all regions to meet the emissions reduction
targets," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, China has no binding international commitments to reduce
its emissions and failed to meet similar targets set by the
government five years ago.
</P>
<P>
Last month, state media reported that some regions were suspected
of submitting fake data on emissions in 2006.
</P>
<P>
A separate Chinese report released last month said climate change
could cause large drops in agricultural output over the coming
decades.
</P>
<P>
In the latter half of this century production of wheat, corn and
rice in China will drop by as much as 37 percent, and the
country's average temperatures would rise by 2 or 3 degrees
Celsius in the next 50 to 80 years, the report said.
</P>
<P>
It also said evaporation rates for some inland rivers would
increase by 15 percent. China already faces a severe water
shortage, especially in the northern part of the country.
</P>
<P>
A British environmental expert said Monday that water shortages
in China were already reaching "incredible" proportions, with
Shanghai particularly vulnerable unless drastic action is taken
quickly.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese are facing an incredible water-stressed economy,"
Justin Mundy, a government adviser on climate change said.
</P>
<P>
"All the water in the southwest of China is fed by glacial melt,"
he said. "Glacial melt in about 25 years' time is not going to be
there in anything like the capacity that is going to be required.
What then, Shanghai?"
</P>
<P>
The China Daily newspaper said Beijing's temperature hit 12.8
degrees Celsius (55 Fahrenheit) on Saturday -- a 30-year high for
the date -- prompting an early spring, with frozen lakes melting
and trees blooming.
