Tainted food affects 300 million Chinese a year: report
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tainted food impacts at least 300 million Chinese people a year
and could lead to a disease outbreak that exacts a huge social
and economic toll, the Asian Development Bank warned Monday.
</P>
<P>
"In recent years, China's actual food safety situation has not
led one to be optimistic," the financial institute said in a
report posted on its website.
</P>
<P>
"The economic and social impact of the production of tainted
foods is very large... diseases stemming from food can have a
negative social impact and can even influence social stability."
</P>
<P>
The report said at least 300 million people in China were
affected by diseases stemming from tainted food sources every
year, but did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
Such diseases cost an estimated 36 billion yuan (4.6 billion
dollars) to 168 billion yuan a year, or between 0.2 percent and
0.9 percent of GDP in 2005, it said.
</P>
<P>
Food-related diseases pose a constant threat to consumers and if
not addressed could lead to an outbreak with a bigger impact than
the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic that struck
China in 2002-2003, it said.
</P>
<P>
Such an outbreak and its knock-on effect on industries like
tourism could pose a serious risk to high-profile events like the
2008 Beijing Olympics.
</P>
<P>
"If a large-scale epidemic linked to food explodes in China, the
negative impact could be more serious, especially if one
considers the 2008 Beijing Olympics and the 2010 Shanghai World
Expo and the Guangzhou Asian Games," the report said.
</P>
<P>
Tainted foodstuffs could also have a negative impact on China's
food export industry, which earned 27.6 billion dollars in 2005,
it added.
</P>
<P>
"China has no basic food safety law and no legal framework to
develop a structure to ensure the safety of food," it said.
</P>
<P>
"The government needs to set up a food safety management
interagency structure that is powerful and that places the health
of the people and consumers in the top place."
</P>
<P>
China has nine ministries that independently implement a series
of rules and regulations on food safety that are at times
overlapping, confusing and contradictory, the report said.
