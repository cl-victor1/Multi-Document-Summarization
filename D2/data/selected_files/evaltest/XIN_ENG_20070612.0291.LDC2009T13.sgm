LOS ANGELES, June 12 (Xinhua)

<P>
Sleep loss or disturbed sleep can heighten the risk for
adolescents to take up smoking and drinking, according to a new
study.
</P>
<P>
The study, conducted by Xianchen Liu, MD, PhD, of the University
of Pittsburgh, was based a questionnaire survey among 1, 362
adolescents, with an average age of 14.6 years, in five high
schools in China. The self-administered questionnaire collected
data on sleep patterns, sleep problems, smoking and drinking
behavior, behavioral and emotional problems, life stress, and
demographic characteristics of the adolescent and family.

<P>
The research abstract was presented on Tuesday at SLEEP 2007, the
21st Annual Meeting of the Associated Professional Sleep
Societies (APSS) in Westchester, Illinois.

The results showed that sleeping less than eight hours at night,
frequent nightmares and difficulty initiating sleep were
significantly associated with drinking. Further, smoking was
related to sleeping less than eight hours, bedtime later than
midnight, nightmares, difficulty initiating sleep, difficulty
maintaining sleep and hypnotic medication use.

"These findings demonstrate significant associations between
sleep quantity and sleep disturbances and smoking and drinking in
Chinese adolescents," said Liu. "Although prospective,
longitudinal studies are warranted, these findings suggest a
potential role of sleep intervention, that is, education in sleep
hygiene and the treatment of sleep disturbances in the prevention
of adolescent substance use."

<P>
The amount of sleep a person gets affects his or her physical
health, emotional well-being, mental abilities, productivity and
performance, according to the study.
</P>
<P>
Recent studies associate lack of sleep with serious health
problems such as an increased risk of depression, obesity,
cardiovascular disease and diabetes.
