Madrid train bombings trial opens by Chris Wright
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The trial opened Thursday of 29 suspects charged with involvement
in the 2004 Madrid train bomb attacks, which killed 191 people in
one of Europe's worst terror strikes.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution alleges that the March 11 attacks, which left
more than 1,800 injured, were the work of mainly Moroccan Islamic
extremists inspired by Al- Qaeda and angered by Spanish military
participation in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The trial, which opened amid tight security at a high court venue
on the outskirts of Madrid, is expected to hear evidence from
some 600 witnesses and around 100 experts, and to last some five
months before an October verdict.
</P>
<P>
The proceedings began with one of the four alleged masterminds of
the coordinated bombings, Rabei Ousmane Sayed Ahmed, alias
"Mohammed the Egyptian," rejecting all charges against him and
refusing to give evidence.
</P>
<P>
The blasts on four packed commuter trains were the biggest in the
Western world since the September 11, 2001 attacks in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Squadrons of police were outside the court, many of them armed,
others with dogs, while a helicopter flew overhead.
</P>
<P>
The accused were brought to the venue in two armoured police
vans, which arrived with sirens wailing.
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be difficult to look in the eye those who
destroyed my life but I will do it for my son," said Pilar
Manjon, a woman who lost her son in the attacks and who chairs a
victim support association.
</P>
<P>
"My legs are trembling, I'm afraid. My stomach is churning," said
a tearful Manjon, who briefly addressed reporters and emotionally
embraced her lawyer before heading into court.
</P>
<P>
"Mohammed the Egyptian" is alleged to have boasted in intercepted
telephone calls that the whole Madrid operation was "my idea."
</P>
<P>
He is one of seven defendants facing sentences of some 40,000
years each for the deaths and membership of a terrorist
organisation, although under Spanish law the longest jail term
anyone can actually serve is 40 years.
</P>
<P>
The other accused will stand trial for lesser offences, including
collaboration with a terrorist group.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of survivors and relatives of the victims will follow the
proceedings on the spot, some in the courtroom itself but mostly
from a separate room where they will watch on a flatscreen.
</P>
<P>
A just-released report by psychiatrists and social workers
involved with helping the survivors and relatives overcome their
trauma showed that almost one in five survivors have not been on
a train since.
</P>
<P>
The accused were to give evidence from a bullet-proof box.
</P>
<P>
The four alleged masterminds spent a year planning the worst
terror attack in Europe since the December 1988 bombing of a Pan
Am jet over the Scottish town of Lockerbie that killed 270
people.
</P>
<P>
Three of the four will be in the dock: Ousmane, Youssef Belhadj,
alias "the Afghan" and Hassan el-Haski, alias "Abu Hamza."
</P>
<P>
Seven men who "led and coordinated" the attacks blew themselves
up in a police raid three weeks later.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution says the "final detonator" for the train bombings
was a message broadcast by Arab television channel Al-Jazeera on
October 18, 2003, from Al- Qaeda's fugitive leader Osama bin
Laden naming Spain as a potential target.
