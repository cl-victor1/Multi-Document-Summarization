New Jersey U.S. Sen. Frank Lautenberg is on the growing list of
potential victims of what prosecutors are calling a multibillion-
dollar fraud scheme run by New York money manager Bernard Madoff.
</P>
<P>
Lautenberg spokesman Scott Mulhauser says the senator was an
investor in Madoff's investment fund -- primarily in the form of
the Lautenberg family's charitable foundation.
</P>
<P>
The 70-year-old Madoff was arrested Thursday in what prosecutors
say was a $50 billion scheme by the Wall Street veteran to
defraud investors.
</P>
<P>
Those who have acknowledged potential losses so far include
former Philadelphia Eagles owner Norman Braman, New York Mets
owner Fred Wilpon, and J. Ezra Merkin, the chairman of GMAC
Financial Services, among others.
