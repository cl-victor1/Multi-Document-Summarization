GAZA, Feb. 4 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
The military wing of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas' Fatah
movement claimed responsibility on Monday for a suicide bombing
which ripped through a shopping mall in southern Israel town of
Dimona.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian news agency of Maan reported that a spokesman for al-
Aqsa Martyrs Brigades of Fatah confirmed during a phone interview
with Maan that his group was behind the blast, which killed at
least four Israelis and wounded 16 others, six of them in
critical condition.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, the first suicide attack on Israeli
soil in more than a year was carried out in cooperation with the
military wings of the Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine (PFLP) and the Democratic Front the Liberation of
Palestine (DFLP).
</P>
<P>
A second suicide bomber was reportedly killed by Israeli police
officers before he blew himself up in the mall.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also said the attackers were Gazans "who crossed
from the liberated territories (Gaza) into the occupied
territories of Palestine (Israel)."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli sources believed that the assailants have
succeeded in infiltrating southern Israel from Sinai when Hamas
militants blew up Gaza-Egypt border on Jan. 23 and allowed floods
of Palestinians into Egypt's Sinai Peninsular.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that the suicide bombers entered Israel from Gaza, the
spokesman said the Israeli claims that they crossed from Sinai
was meant at "exporting Israel's crisis to Egypt."
</P>
<P>
On Jan. 29, 2006, Islamic Jihad movement carried out the latest
suicide bombing in Eilat town, leaving three Israelis dead.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian forces on Sunday resealed the only remaining gap on the
Egyptian side of the border fences with barbed wire and metal
barricades, ending the nearly two-week-long border breaches
crisis.
