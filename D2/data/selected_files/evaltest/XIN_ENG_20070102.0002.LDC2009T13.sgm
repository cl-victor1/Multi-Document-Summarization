The Indonesian rescue team Tuesday arrived at the mountainous
area in West Sulawesi province where a passenger plane with 102
people onboard crashed Monday, finding at least 90 bodies at the
scene.

The plane crashed into pieces at a mountain in Polewali regency,
some 1,500 km northeast of Jakarta.

Rescuers reached the scene after walking overnight accompanied by
local residents, search and rescue team member Suyatno was quoted
by the national Antara news agency as saying.

"The nearest airport would soon deploy a helicopter to help the
evacuation and send 102 body bags," he said.

The Boeing 737-400 belonging to low-cost carrier Adam Air made a
distress call Monday evening and disappeared from the radar
screen minutes later. The cause of the accident remains unknown,
but airport officials reported hostile weather around the
location when it occurred.

It was the worst air disaster since Sept. 5, 2005, when a Mandala
Airline's Boeing 737-200 crashed shortly after taking off from
the North Sumatra's airport, killing 103 people onboard and 47
others on the ground.
