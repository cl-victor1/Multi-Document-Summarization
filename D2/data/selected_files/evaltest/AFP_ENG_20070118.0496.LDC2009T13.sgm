Greenland cuts polar bear hunting quota
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Greenland on Thursday said it would cut its annual quota for its
polar bear hunt as the animal was threatened by climate change.
</P>
<P>
Warmer temperatures have caused the Arctic ice cap to melt,
shrinking the bears' hunting grounds and making it increasingly
difficult for them to find food.
</P>
<P>
Hunters, who can get up to 2,685 euros (3,500 dollars) for a bear
pelt, had been killing around 250 bears a year before the first
quota of 150 kills was introduced for 2006.
</P>
<P>
The quota for 2007 has now been reduced to 139 in the semi-
autonomous Danish territory.
</P>
<P>
"We have decided on this reduction in the 2007 quota to be more
in line with a level suggested by biologists, who wanted an even
lower number," a ministry of fisheries and hunting official, Ole
Heinrich, told AFP.
</P>
<P>
The decision was taken after consultation with local authorities
and the Greenland Hunters and Fishers Association (KNAPK), said
Heinrich, who spoke to AFP by telephone from Greenland's capital
Nuuk.
</P>
<P>
KNAPK president John Billmann criticised the authorities for not
having stuck to plans to allow the killing of 203 bears.
</P>
<P>
Only hunters who are granted special permits are allowed to hunt
polar bears. The hunting of bear cubs and pregnant bears is
banned.
</P>
<P>
There is a complete ban on the hunting of polar bears between
July 1 and September 30.
