OTTAWA, June 7 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
Canada's Cancer Society on Thursday urged people to increase
vitamin D intake, citing growing evidence of the supplement
reducing cancer risks.
</P>
<P>
The society recommended that adults living in Canada should
consider taking 1,000 international units (IU) of vitamin D
supplements a day during the fall and winter.
</P>
<P>
Adults at higher risk of having vitamin D deficiency, including
older people, those with darker skin, not going outside often or
wearing clothing that covers most skin, should consider taking
the 1,000 IU supplement year round, the society said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
"We're recommending 1,000 IUs daily because the current evidence
suggests this amount will help reduce cancer risk with the least
potential for harm," said Heather Logan, the society's director
of cancer control policy.
</P>
<P>
A study published Thursday in the "American Journal of Clinical
Nutrition" showed a 60 to 77 percent drop in cancer rates among
postmenopausal women who took vitamin D combined with calcium,
compared with a placebo.
