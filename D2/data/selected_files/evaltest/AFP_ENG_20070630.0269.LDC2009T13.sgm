A blazing car crashed into the terminal building at Glasgow
Airport in Scotland on Saturday, police said.
</P>
<P>
The incident came just a day after police foiled car bomb attacks
in London.
</P>
<P>
"The police have been called at about 3:15 (pm) (1415 GMT) at
Glasgow Airport. A car had crashed inside the terminal. It was on
fire," a police spokeswoman told AFP.
</P>
<P>
She added that she did not know if it was a terrorist attack or
if there were any victims.
</P>
<P>
Witness James Edgar said there was "absolute chaos" at the
airport.
</P>
<P>
"I was in the airport building trying to book a holiday and
people were running past us and then suddenly they told us all to
get out of the airport," he told Sky News television.
</P>
<P>
"When we went out the main building there was a 4X4 (four-wheeled
drive vehicle), as if it was rammed into the building. It was on
fire and at that point everybody was just in a panic."
</P>
<P>
Edgar added that police and security scuffled with an Asian man.
</P>
<P>
"They later took him away. The fire is now out. As you can
imagine there is absolute chaos in the airport."
</P>
<P>
BBC television meanwhile showed a still image of the terminal's
exterior engulfed by a ball of fire.
