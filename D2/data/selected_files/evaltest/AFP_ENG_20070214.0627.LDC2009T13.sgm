'No proof' against Egyptian in  Madrid train bombings: lawyer
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There is no material evidence against Egyptian Rabei Ousmane
Sayed Ahmed, who goes on trial on Thursday accused of being one
of the masterminds behind the deadly train bombings in Madrid on
March 11, 2004, his lawyer told AFP.
</P>
<P>
"There is no evidence against him ... There are only two
recordings from Milan where he talks about Madrid," said Italian
Luca D'Auria, one of two lawyers representing Ahmed, nicknamed
"Mohammed the Egyptian".
</P>
<P>
The conversations caught on tape by Italian intelligence services
in no way constituted "claiming responsibility right after the
attack," D'Auria said, pointing out that Ahmed had told someone
else in the room: "look, that thing there, I was the one who did
it."
</P>
<P>
"This does not appear to me to be resounding evidence against
him," the lawyer said, adding that "It will be up to the public
prosecutor to explain where the evidence lies."
</P>
<P>
Ahmed, 35, is suspected of having helped organise the bombings of
four commuter trains, which killed 191 people and injured 1,824.
If found guilty he faces 38,656 years in jail, although under
Spanish law he could only serve a maximum 40 years.
</P>
<P>
Ahmed was arrested on June 7, 2004, in Italy. He was temporarily
extradited to Spain but sent back to Milan and sentenced last
November to 10 years in jail for "criminal association for
purposes of international terrorism", before being returned to
Spain.
</P>
<P>
The Italian judges deemed Ahmed to be "an influential member of
Al-Qaeda".
