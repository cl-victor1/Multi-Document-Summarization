Malaysian court jails Chinese fishermen for turtle poaching

KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia 2007-04-12 06:41:37 UTC

<P>
A court in eastern Malaysia has jailed 17 Chinese fishermen for 1
1/2 years each after they failed to pay fines for poaching almost
300 protected turtles in Malaysian waters, an official said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The same court also jailed nine Vietnamese fishermen for six
months each for illegally fishing off the eastern state of Sabah,
prosecuting officer Mohammad Yusoff Anthony of the Sabah state
fisheries department told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
The rulings were handed down Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Mohammad Yusoff said the Chinese fishermen were fined a total of
1.88 million ringgit (US$545,000; euro406,000) after they
admitted to the three offenses of encroaching into Malaysian
waters and catching two types of protected species -- the green
and the hawksbill turtles.
</P>
<P>
Instead of paying the fines, all of them went to jail for 18
months -- six months for each offense, he said, confirming
reports of the case in the New Straits Times and The Star.
</P>
<P>
He said Malaysian marine police seized the turtles from the
Hainan fishermen's trawler late last month after they were caught
in the waters off Malaysia's Sabah state on Borneo island. Only
about 20 turtles were still alive.
</P>
<P>
Mohammad Yusoff, who represented the Sabah state fisheries
department, had called for stiff sentences to deter fishermen
from poaching endangered wildlife and protect the country's
resources, according to the Times.
</P>
<P>
"We need to send a strong message to (the poachers) because they
only think of profits and are not bothered by the laws of our
country," the Times quoted Yusoff as saying.
</P>
<P>
Yusoff confirmed his comments and the reports, but declined to
say whether he thought the court's ruling had been strict enough.
</P>
<P>
The same court also fined nine Vietnamese fishermen 80,000
ringgit (US$23,200; euro17,300) each for fishing illegally off
Sabah. The fishermen did not pay and so went to jail for six
months each.
</P>
<P>
The case of another Chinese trawler found also late last month
with 70 mostly dead turtles on board will be heard Friday, Yusoff
said.
</P>
<P>
Turtles are poached for their shells to be made into decorative
items, and for their meat, which is believed in many Asian
cultures to have medicinal value. Both green and hawksbill
turtles are listed as endangered by global conservation group
WWF.
