Government Adopts Colorado River Guidelines
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The shortage guidelines, more than two years in the making, come
in the eighth year of the worst drought in the century-long
historic record of the Colorado, which supplies water to 25
million people and 1 million acres of farmland.
</P>
<P>
Federal water managers say a shortage could be declared as early
as 2010, allowing the Department of the Interior to reduce water
deliveries to Arizona and Nevada, two of the seven states that
have sparred over the waterway for decades.
</P>
<P>
California, which has the biggest water allocation and seniority
rights in the Lower Basin, would not be affected.
</P>
<P>
The ongoing drought has left Lake Powell and Lake Mead, the
Colorado's two mammoth reservoirs, half empty, their receding
shorelines marked by a wide band of bleached rocks that a decade
ago were under water. Without some very wet years, Lake Mead
might never refill, according to federal hydrologists.
</P>
<P>
"We have had good news and bad news," said U.S. Secretary of the
Interior Dirk Kempthorne  in a speech before signing the shortage
document at the Colorado River Water Users Association meeting at
Caesars Palace.
</P>
<P>
The bad news, he added, is that the Colorado drought shows "no
sign of ending."
</P>
<P>
Scientists also predict that climate change will worsen Western
drought patterns and reduce Colorado flows by increasing
evaporation and decreasing snowfall. One study released earlier
in 2007 warned that global warming could thrust the Southwest
into a state of permanent drought by 2050.
</P>
<P>
"Runoff in five of the seven Colorado River basin states is
projected to decline by more than 15 percent during the 21st
century," Kempthorne said.
</P>
<P>
Against that backdrop, Wyoming, Utah, Colorado, Nevada, New
Mexico, Arizona and California began negotiations in 2005 to
write a blueprint for water shortages. Their plans formed the
basis of the document signed by Kempthorne, who called it "an
agreement to share adversity" and a landmark in the tangled
history of Colorado River management.
</P>
<P>
The agreement avoided a prolonged legal battle among the seven
states by tinkering with river law without changing the
fundamentals of the 1922 compact that divided the Colorado's flow
among them.
</P>
<P>
Although California's seniority rights put it in the best
position of the Lower Basin states, the agreement benefited the
state by preventing "bloody legal fights in Congress or the
courts," said Jeffrey Kightlinger, general manager of the
Metropolitan Water District of Southern California.
</P>
<P>
The guidelines, which will be in effect for the next 19 years,
contain three major elements:
</P>
<P>
-- They set particular water-level elevations of Lake Mead as
triggers for water cutbacks. The reductions will total less than
10 percent of the Lower Basin's allocation. Arizona agriculture
will bear the brunt of the shortfall and Nevada a small portion
of it.
</P>
<P>
"California is secure. It's entitlement is not impacted," said
Bill Swan, water rights attorney for the Imperial Irrigation
District, which gets three-fourths of California's Colorado
allotment.
</P>
<P>
-- Lake Powell, which holds water from the upper-basin states,
and Lake Mead, which receives water from Powell, will be operated
as one reservoir system. That is expected to make it easier to
control Mead's level and the shortage triggers.
</P>
<P>
-- States will be allowed to hold "conserved" water in Mead from
year to year, changing existing rules that require them to use or
lose their annual allocations. Water agencies then could pay
irrigation districts to let farmland lie fallow, keep the unused
irrigation water stored in Mead and draw on it at a later date.
</P>
<P>
The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California will be
able to store up to 1.5 million acre-feet in Mead, nearly double
the capacity of its Diamond Valley Lake Reservoir in Riverside
County. That is enough water to meet annual needs for about 3
million average households.
</P>
<P>
Nevada, which has the smallest water allotment in the Lower
Basin, plans to hold water in Mead from fallow farmland along the
Virgin and Muddy rivers. The Southern Nevada Water Authority also
will build a small reservoir, called Drop Two, near the Mexican
border to capture flows ordered by  U.S. farmers who don't use it
during rain. That measure would decrease flows to the Colorado's
ecologically important delta, potentially sparking outcry from
Mexico. In return for financing the reservoir, Southern Nevada
will get some of the captured water. Metropolitan and Arizona
also might take part in the arrangement.
</P>
<P>
Las Vegas' exploding population and growing water needs have been
a driving force behind the state talks. Pat Mulroy,  head of the
Southern Nevada Water Authority, had threatened to go to court to
get more water.
</P>
<P>
Michael Cohen, senior associate for the Pacific Institute, called
the agreement a  large step forward. But he wasn't prepared to
say the states that rely on the Colorado River have fully
acknowledged a drier future.
</P>
<P>
"None of the municipal agencies are saying, `We need to re-
evaluate our urban plans, our growth plans because there's only
so much water,' " he said. "It's not clear that the states are
saying, `OK, we're going to now live in this era of limits.' "
</P>
