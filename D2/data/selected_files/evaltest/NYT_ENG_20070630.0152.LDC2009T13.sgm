4 HELD IN SCOTTISH ATTACK AS BRITISH SEE BROADER PLOT )

LONDON
</P>
<P>
British officials raised the country's terrorism threat alert to
its highest level on Saturday after two men slammed an SUV into
entrance doors at Glasgow Airport and turned the vehicle into a
potentially lethal fireball.
</P>
<P>
Less than 38 hours earlier, the police had uncovered two cars in
London rigged to explode with gasoline, gas canisters and nails.
</P>
<P>
Early Sunday, after a day of fast-moving developments, the London
police announced that two people had been arrested in Cheshire,
in northwest England, "in connection with the events in London
and Scotland."
</P>
<P>
The arrests were in addition to those of the two occupants of the
blazing car at Glasgow Airport. A witness to the attack said on
BBC television that one of the car's occupants had been ablaze
from head to foot, and as he struggled with the police, "was
throwing punches and shouting 'Allah, Allah."'
</P>
<P>
Britain's threat level is now at "critical," meaning that another
attack is considered imminent. The threat has not been as high
since last year, after authorities discovered what they called a
plot to attack trans-Atlantic airliners with liquid explosives.
</P>
<P>
A British security official, who like many other officials who
disclosed information insisted on anonymity, said Saturday that
the heightened level reflected an assessment that the London and
Glasgow cases were "linked in some ways and, therefore, there are
clearly individuals who have the capability and intent to carry
out further attacks."
</P>
<P>
The links related to the way the London car bombs and Glasgow
airport attack had been conceived and planned, using vehicles and
gasoline, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The airport in Liverpool was also closed on Saturday, apparently
reflecting a fresh area of concern in an increasingly jittery
nation.
</P>
<P>
In the United States, the Department of Homeland Security issued
a statement from Secretary Michael Chertoff saying there were no
plans to raise the national threat level because there was "no
specific, credible information" suggesting any threat to the
United States.
</P>
<P>
But the federal government took a number of steps on Saturday,
given the events in Britain and the approaching July 4 holiday,
to elevate security.
</P>
<P>
Homeland Security officials said they included additional bomb
detection canine teams at airports and behavior-detection squads.
