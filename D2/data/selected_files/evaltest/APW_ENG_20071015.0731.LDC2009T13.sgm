A co-defendant in the O.J. Simpson armed robbery case told a
judge Monday he would plead guilty to a felony and testify
against Simpson and four others in the hotel room theft of sports
collectibles from two memorabilia dealers.
</P>
<P>
The plea agreement with Charles Cashmore, 40, of Las Vegas ups
the ante in the prosecution of Simpson. Cashmore can testify that
guns were involved in the Sept. 13 confrontation with two sports
memorabilia dealers at a Las Vegas casino hotel room, his lawyer
said.
</P>
<P>
Simpson and his lawyers have denied guns were in the room.
</P>
<P>
"In District Court, he'll be pleading guilty to accessory to
robbery," District Attorney David Roger told the judge. "He's
agreed to provide truthful testimony."
</P>
<P>
Procedurally, Cashmore waived his preliminary hearing. Las Vegas
Justice of the Peace Joe Bonaventure Jr., set arraignment for
Oct. 23.
</P>
<P>
Simpson and the others, Walter Alexander, Clarence "C.J."
Stewart, Michael McClinton, and Charles Ehrlich, are due in court
for a preliminary hearing on Nov. 8 and 9. Bonaventure will
decide then whether there is enough evidence to send the case to
trial in state court.
