Coral, trees, cuddly mammal up for protection from human trade:
CITES
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

Pink coral, cedar trees, types of fish eaten in Europe and a
cuddly, wide-eyed mammal that is prized in Asian medicine are
among the animal and plant species that could gain greater
protection this year, a UN agency said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations agency regulating the trade in endangered
species, CITES, unveiled some 40 new government proposals for
changes to wildlife trade rules which will be considered at the
organisation's conference in June.
</P>
<P>
The agency said many of the proposals reflected growing
international concern about the accelerating destruction of the
world's marine and forest resources through overfishing and
excessive logging.
</P>
<P>
"Biological diversity faces many threats, ranging from habitat
destruction to climate change to unrestrained commercial
harvesting for trade," said Achim Steiner, executive director of
the UN Environment Programme, which administers CITES.
</P>
<P>
Potentially the most endearing candidate for a complete ban trade
is the Slow Loris, a small furry nocturnal primate from south and
southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia, which is sponsoring full protection under CITES
Appendix I, says the Loris is threatened by a combination of the
destruction of its forest habitat and growing demand for
traditional medicine and as a pet.
</P>
<P>
The requests also include an attempt by the United States to
control the trade in pink coral for the first time, because of
the overexploitation of tropical coral reefs which have been
rendered fragile and bleached by climate change.
</P>
<P>
The pink variety of the polyp has been prized in jewellery and
for decoration for 5,000 years.
</P>
<P>
"Extensive deforestation" of the cedar tree in South and central
America, is prompting the European Union to seek trade
restrictions under Appendix II for the species, which is valued
for its insect and rot resistant wood.
</P>
<P>
The EU also wants the trade in the European eels, a popular food
in coastal areas of northern Europe, and the spiny dogfish, a
type of shark prized in fish and chip shops, to be subject to a
permit system and fisheries management, CITES said.
</P>
<P>
Germany, which currently holds the European Union presidency,
said the spiny dogfish was vulnerable because of its tendency to
travel in large schools that are easily trawled by fishing boats
and its slow reproductive rate.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile European eel stocks have declined "dramatically" due to
overfishing according to CITES.
</P>
<P>
Other fish species up for protection due to overexploitation
include Brazilian lobsters, while several countries want complete
halt in trade in the sawfish, a favourite for traditional
medicine.
</P>
<P>
A popular item in home aquariums, the striking tropical Bangai
cardinal fish, is also a candidate for listing, because about
700,000 to 900,000 of them are collected every year.
