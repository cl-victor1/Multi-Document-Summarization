DHAKA, July 31 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
Eight more people were killed in flooding in three districts of
Bangladesh on Monday as the overall flood situation worsened in
the country's northern and northeastern districts, local media
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Five people drowned in floodwaters in northwestern Sirajganj
district, two in northern Jamalpur district and one in northern
Sherpur district, private news agency UNB reported.
</P>
<P>
At least eight people died in floodwater or flood-related
incidents in three northern districts on Sunday, and about 1
million people were marooned by floodwater in about ten districts
in northern, northeastern and central parts of the country,
according to local media.
</P>
<P>
A bulletin of Bangladesh Flood Forecasting and Warning Center (
FFWC) said on Monday the flood situation in about fifteen
districts in the northern, northeastern and central parts of the
country continued to deteriorate.
</P>
<P>
It said the country's major rivers were flowing above their
danger levels in 19 water-level monitoring stations Monday
morning. The water levels of those rivers marked rise at 37
stations while registered fall in 25.
</P>
<P>
Experts apprehended that the current spell of floods could take a
disastrous turn like the one in 1998, which once submerged nearly
two-thirds of the country's land, claiming more than 1,000
people's lives.
</P>
<P>
The flood-affected residents were passing days in miseries. They
have been reported to be helplessly looking for dry shelter for
their families and livestock. Country boats and makeshift rafts
have replaced motorcars and rickshaws to be their major means of
communication.
</P>
<P>
Communication systems suffered serious disruptions as highways,
motorways, railway tracks, bridges and culverts have either been
submerged or washed away in many regions.
</P>
<P>
Almost all the stricken areas are reeling under scarcity of food
and safe drinking water. The army is helping out local
administration in providing relief for the victims.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of primary schools were declared closed as water levels
of the major rivers continued to rise in the affected districts.
