MAKERS PULL INFANT COLD MEDICINES OFF THE SHELVES
</HEADLINE>

WASHINGTON
</P>
<P>
Major makers of over-the-counter infant cough and cold medicines
announced Thursday that they were withdrawing their products from
the market for fear that they could be misused by parents.
</P>
<P>
The voluntary withdrawal, already under way, affects only
products labeled for use in infants, not for use in children 2
and older. And some small companies could continue selling infant
products. More changes, perhaps mandated by federal drug
regulators, could be in the offing.
</P>
<P>
The withdrawal comes two weeks after safety reviewers within the
Food and Drug Administration urged the agency to consider an
outright ban of over-the-counter cough and cold products for
children under 6. Even the industry's main trade group, the
Consumer Healthcare Products Association, recommended two weeks
ago that the products not be used on infants.
</P>
<P>
Despite the recommendation, giant drugmakers like Johnson
&amp;amp; Johnson, Wyeth and Novartis continued to sell cough and
cold products labeled for infants. Last week, Rep. Henry A.
Waxman, D-Calif., chairman of the House Committee on Oversight
and Government Reform, sent a letter to the industry's trade
association asking why the products were still being sold.
</P>
<P>
Until Thursday, industry representatives answered that they were
discussing the issue with the FDA and defended their medicines as
safe and effective.
</P>
<P>
"The reason the makers of over-the-counter oral cough and cold
medicine for infants are withdrawing these medicines is that
there have been rare patterns of misuse leading to overdose
recently identified, particularly in infants," said Linda A.
Suydam, president of the trade association.
</P>
<P>
"Safety is our top priority," Suydam added.
</P>
<P>
Sen. Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y., criticized the drug agency for a
delayed withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
"The FDA should be first to act to ensure consumer safety rather
than leaving families to rely on the industry itself," Schumer
said.
</P>
<P>
Next week, a committee of outside experts will consider the
safety of these medicines and offer recommendations to the
agency.
</P>
<P>
Dianne Murphy, director of the agency's office of pediatric
therapeutics, said in an interview that in addition to asking
basic questions about the drugs' safety and effectiveness, the
agency intended to question the experts closely about the
advisability of combination medicines. It will also explore how
to address the issue of accurate dosing when there are a dizzying
array of measuring devices, some provided by the manufacturers
and some not.
</P>
<P>
"These measuring devices, we would hope that is an area that
would change," Murphy said.
</P>
<P>
The experts will also consider whether children from 2 to 6
should be given these medicines.
</P>
<P>
"I don't recommend their use in any child," said Dr. Daniel
Frattarelli, a pediatrician from Detroit who serves on the
American Academy of Pediatrics' committee on drugs. "These
medicines don't help, they may hurt, so don't use them."
</P>
<P>
There are roughly 800 over-the-counter pediatric cough and cold
products. In the fiscal year that ended July 15, makers sold at
least 41 million units of these products in the United States,
about a fifth of which were sold in the form of drops that are
generally given to infants, according to the trade association. A
1994 study found that more than a third of all 3-year-olds in the
country were given over-the-counter cough and cold preparations
in one 30-day span.
</P>
<P>
The products being withdrawn include Dimetapp Decongestant Infant
Drops and Robitussin Infant Cough DM Drops, both made by Wyeth;
Little Colds Decongestant Plus Cough, by Prestige Brands;
Pediacare Infant Drops Decongestant and Tylenol Concentrated
Infant Drops Plus Cold and Cough, both by Johnson &amp;amp;
Johnson; and Triaminic Infant &amp;amp; Toddler Thin Strips
Decongestant, by Novartis.
</P>
<P>
Companies would not disclose sales figures for the products.
Prestige Brands said that its two withdrawn products represented
about 1 percent of its net sales, which were $318.6 million in
its 2007 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Doug Petkus, a Wyeth spokesman, said the withdrawals would "have
minimal impact on the company." Wyeth's entire line of Robitussin
products had $225.5 million in sales last year. Johnson &amp;amp;
Johnson does not report overall Tylenol sales but has hinted that
they approach $1 billion annually.
</P>
<P>
There is little evidence that cough and cold medicines are
effective in young children, and there are increasing fears that
they may be dangerous. From 1969 to 2006, at least 45 children
died in the United States after taking decongestants, and 69 died
after taking antihistamines, according to the FDA.
</P>
<P>
Many children sickened after they were mistakenly given too much
-- either because parents failed to realize that products from
two makers contained identical medicines or because parents had
given improper amounts. But there are a growing number of reports
that even children given recommended doses are at risk.
</P>
<P>
The Poison Control Center of the Children's Hospital of
Philadelphia recently reported four cases of prolonged
hallucinations in children as old as 6 who were given recommended
doses.
</P>
<P>
Infant cough-and-cold products were approved decades ago without
adequate testing in children because experts assumed that
children were simply small adults, and that drugs approved for
adults must also work in children. More recent research showed
that neither assumption was true. Indeed, recent studies suggest
that pediatric cough and cold medicines work no better than
placebos.
</P>
<P>
Joshua M. Sharfstein, the Baltimore commissioner of health,
cheered the withdrawals but said that the FDA should ban all such
products so that smaller companies do not continue to sell them.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that companies should also stop marketing cough and
cold products for toddlers," Sharfstein said.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Andrew D. Racine, a pediatrician at the Children's Hospital
at Montefiore in the Bronx, said that most parents who give cold
medicines to young children were just hoping for a good night's
sleep themselves.
</P>
<P>
Racine said that he tells all new parents never to combine cough
and cold medicines and to expect that their child will get six to
eight colds each year.
</P>
<P>
"When you become a parent," he said, "you have to be prepared for
some sleepless nights."
</P>
<P>
Murphy of the FDA said parents should be more cautious about
using such medicines.
</P>
<P>
"All drugs have risks," she said, "and these drugs are mostly
used to treat symptoms and not the underlying disease, and we
need to be very careful about deciding whether and when to use
them or not."
