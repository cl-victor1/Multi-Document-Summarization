Defense Secretary Robert Gates says people found to have been
responsible for allowing substandard living conditions for
soldier outpatients at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in
Washington will be "held accountable," although so far no one in
the Army chain of command has offered to resign.

Gates spoke to reporters after visiting the medical compound,
whose reputation as a premier caregiver for soldiers wounded in
Iraq and Afghanistan has taken a severe hit in the aftermath of a
Washington Post series of reports last week that documented
problems in soldiers' housing and in the medical bureaucracy at
Walter Reed.

"A bedrock principle of our military system is that we empower
commanders with the responsibility, authority and resources
necessary to carry out their mission," Gates said. "With
responsibility comes accountability."
</P>
<P>
His comment suggested that senior officials in the Army chain of
command would not be immune from disciplinary action.

Gates announced that two former Army secretaries, Togo West and
Jack Marsh, would head an independent panel to review treatment
and administrative processes at Walter Reed, in Washington, and
the National Naval Medical Center in the capital's Maryland
suburbs. Gates said the group has been asked to report its
findings within 45 days.

"After the facts are established, those responsible for having
allowed this unacceptable situation to develop will indeed be
held accountable," Gates said, adding that so far no one involved
has offered to resign.
</P>
<P>
"We are not going to wait 45 days to begin addressing these
problems," he said. "And so there have been some people who are
most directly involved who have been relieved. But we will be
looking and evaluating the rest of the chain of command as we get
more information."
</P>
<P>
Asked about Gates' statement that some have already been relieved
of duty, Army officials said they were unsure that any such
actions had been taken. One Army official, speaking on condition
of anonymity because the Army also is undertaking its own review
of what happened at Walter Reed, said officials are considering
possible personnel changes.
