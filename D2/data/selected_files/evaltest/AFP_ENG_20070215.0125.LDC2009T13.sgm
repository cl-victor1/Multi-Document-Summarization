Madrid train bombings trial opens
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The trial opened Thursday of 29 mostly Moroccan suspects charged
with involvement in the 2004 Madrid train bomb attacks, which
killed 191 people and injured 1,824 in the worst terror strike to
hit Spain.
</P>
<P>
The trial, which is expected to hear evidence from more than 600
witnesses and last for some five months before an October
verdict, opened amid tight security at a high court venue on the
outskirts of Madrid.
</P>
<P>
The attacks, which the prosecution alleges were the work of
mainly Moroccan Islamic extremists inspired by Al-Qaeda and
angered by Spanish military participation in Iraq, were the
biggest in the Western world since the September 11, 2001 attacks
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Squadrons of police were outside the court on Madrid's western
outskirts, many of them armed, others with dogs, while a
helicopter flew overhead.
</P>
<P>
The accused were brought successively in armoured police vans,
which arrived with sirens wailing.
</P>
<P>
"My legs are trembling, I'm afraid. My stomach is churning," said
Pilar Manjon, a woman who lost her son in the attacks and who
chairs a victim support association.
</P>
<P>
The court will hold three days of sessions per week through to
July with a verdict due in October.
