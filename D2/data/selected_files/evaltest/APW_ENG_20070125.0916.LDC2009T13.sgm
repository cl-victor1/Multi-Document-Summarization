Report: Global fisheries officials agree on plan to save
plummeting tuna stocks

International fisheries officials have agreed on an unprecedented
action plan to reverse the decline in global tuna stocks,
including a plan to track each fish from the ocean to the market,
a news report said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The plan was adopted in principle by the five international tuna
conservation organizations at a first-of-its kind summit in the
western city of Kobe, Kyodo News agency reported, citing
unidentified conference officials.
</P>
<P>
Delegates are expected to adopt the plan on Friday when they wrap
up the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Fisheries Agency official Takaaki Sakamoto said
officials were still working on the draft action plan and
couldn't comment on its content. The agency said participants are
focusing on sustainable use of tuna resources.
</P>
<P>
The plan calls for closer communication between the five global
regulatory bodies, especially in sharing data on illegal fishing
and tuna stock assessment, Kyodo said. The plan also recommends
establishing an international high seas inspection team.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, the groups will clamp down on poaching by
harmonizing a trade tracking program that will improve
documentation of the world's catch through electronic tagging,
Kyodo said.
</P>
<P>
Overfishing and poaching are largely to blame for tumbling tuna
stocks worldwide, conservationists say.
</P>
<P>
By 2004, for example, the number of adult Atlantic bluefin tuna
capable of spawning had plummeted to roughly 19 percent of the
1975 level in the western half of the ocean, according to the
International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas.
</P>
<P>
Japan's role as host to the Kobe conference is highly symbolic of
its role as a major tuna consumer. The country accounts for 12
percent of the global catch of 2.06 million tons and gobbles up
about a quarter of the world's supply of the five big species:
bluefin, southern bluefin, bigeye, yellowfin and albacore.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from the commercial fishing industry,
environmental groups and government regulators are discussing
ways to strengthen information sharing and cooperation among
regional organizations to track and manage tuna stocks.
