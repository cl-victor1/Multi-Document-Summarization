Early rising no good for the heart: study

<P>
Generations have praised the wisdom of getting up early in the
morning, but a Japanese study says early-risers are actually at a
higher risk of developing heart problems.
</P>
<P>
The study, conducted by researchers from several universities and
hospitals in the western Japanese city of Kyoto, revealed a link
between wake-up times and a person's cardiovascular condition.

"Rising early to go to work or exercise might not be beneficial
to health, but rather a risk for vascular diseases," said an
abstract of the study.
</P>
<P>
The study, covering 3,017 healthy adults aged between 23 through
90, found that early risers had a greater risk of heart
conditions including hypertension and of having strokes.
</P>
<P>
However, the study also noted that early risers were usually
older.

<P>
The study is being presented this week at the World Congress of
the World Federation of Sleep Research and Sleep Medicine
Societies, being held in Cairns, Australia.

<P>
A separate study released in June by researchers at the
University of Pennsylvania found that chronic sleep deprivation
adds stress to the heart, putting a person at greater risk of
cardiovascular disease and death.
