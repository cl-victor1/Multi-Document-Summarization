HARARE, Feb. 24 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe could soon revive its human organ donation program in a
bid to keep up with global health technological developments, the
official New Ziana reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Health and Child Welfare Deputy Minister Edwin Muguti said strong
regulatory measures would be put in place to ensure the success
of the program and shield it from abuse.
</P>
<P>
Funding, which hindered the previous attempt to set up the
program some 10 years ago, would also be sourced, he said.
</P>
<P>
The government is working on resuscitating the human organ
donation program and, because of its international scrutiny,
Zimbabwe will craft strong legislative laws to guard it from
abuse, Muguti said.
</P>
<P>
He said the program, which registered some meaningful success in
the early 1990s, would help address some health issues and
improve service delivery.
</P>
<P>
Currently, patients that require human organ donations have to go
abroad as Zimbabwe does not have adequate and proper resources
such as machines and funds to conduct the operations.
