Taylor lawyers plead for more time
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lawyers for former Liberian president Charles Taylor, on trial at
a UN-backed court in The Hague for alleged war crimes, demanded
Friday more time to construct his defence.
</P>
<P>
The trial of the ex-warlord, the biggest case before the
International Criminal Court (ICC), has already been delayed once
from April 2 until June 4 after a similar request, and this time
the judge said no.
</P>
<P>
"I need more time to prepare," Taylor's British lawyer Karim Khan
had told the hearing which Taylor himself did not attend because
of a bad back. "The prosecution had five years, we had less than
five months," she protested.
</P>
<P>
Taylor was moved out of Freetown and to the premises in The Hague
to avoid stirring unrest in strife-prone west Africa.
</P>
<P>
Taylor is seen as the single most powerful figure behind a series
of civil wars in Liberia and neighbouring Sierra Leone between
1989 and 2003 which left some 400,000 people dead.
</P>
<P>
He faces a total of 11 charges of crimes against humanity, war
crimes and violations of international human rights and is
specifically accused of aiding rebel groups which murdered,
enslaved and mutilated civilians.
