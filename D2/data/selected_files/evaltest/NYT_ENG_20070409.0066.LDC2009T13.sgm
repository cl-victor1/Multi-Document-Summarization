A MILLION TINY LIFE RAFTS
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On a night of fierce winds and savage waves, the freighter Miss
Beholden started taking on water.
</P>
<P>
The 142-foot ship was 5 miles off Key West, carrying 20 tons
cargo of candy and cigarettes, and straining against what later
would be called the no-name storm. With water pooling inside the
ship, the captain feared it would sink. So to save the crew, he
ran the ship aground.
</P>
<P>
Fourteen years later, scientists from the Florida Aquarium in
Tampa are still trying to repair the damage caused that night not
to the freighter, but to the delicate coral reef it smashed into.
</P>
<P>
The scientists have nursed dozens of tiny coral fragments in a
lab in Ruskin, and transported them to Western Sambo Reef in the
Keys.
</P>
<P>
It's all part of a complicated experiment to find a new way to
save Florida's vast coral reefs, which lately have been dying
from everything from shipwrecks to pollution to climate change.
The idea is to grow coral in labs, kind of like fish farms, so
they can be returned to their natural settings in Florida's
struggling coral reefs.
</P>
<P>
Ilze Berzins of the Florida Aquarium, who is in charge of the
effort, said it's more than an interesting scientific pursuit.
Because of all the dangers facing Florida's coral reefs today,
she said, doing something to restore them is urgently needed.
</P>
<P>
"If we can't come up with answers to our environmental problems,"
she said, "we're not being good stewards."
</P>
<P>
Coral are animals related to sea anemones and jellyfish, whose
skeletons can form rocklike structures that make up reefs. They
have tiny mouths that they can open to swallow plankton, and also
get nourishment from algae in the surrounding water. But two
species of coral last year were listed as "threatened" under the
Endangered Species Act.
</P>
<P>
Reefs are not only a big attraction for divers and tourists, but
they also are the backbone of an ecosystem that supports a wide
diversity of fish and other undersea life. Scientists want to
protect the coral to save the surrounding environment.
</P>
<P>
This project has its roots in a conversation about the state's
coral that Berzins had with Craig Watson from the Tropical
Aquaculture Laboratory in Ruskin, and an official from the
Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary.
</P>
<P>
They developed a plan: Take some tiny bits of coral from a
construction site in the Keys. Study the coral in a lab, watch it
grow, make sure it's healthy. And then find a way to return it to
the wild in hopes that it will flourish.
</P>
<P>
A look around Berzins' office it's one of those nooks you can't
see on a normal tour of the Florida Aquarium shows what makes her
a good candidate to lead this effort: posters from academic
conferences and pictures of seascapes, just as you would expect
from a marine biologist with a doctorate.
</P>
<P>
But her shelves also contain books with titles such as Goat
Medicine and Zoo and Wild Animal Medicine. That's because she
also is a veterinarian. She specializes in aquatic medicine a
fish doctor, you could say.
</P>
<P>
After obtaining government grants, she and colleagues studied the
coral and developed health certificates for the tiny animals a
way of determining whether they were healthy enough to be put
back in the wild. Scientists from the University of South
Florida, Florida Atlantic University and Mote Marine Laboratory
in Sarasota have assisted in the research.
</P>
<P>
Some of the tiny corals from the Keys came to the aquarium.
Others went to Hillsborough County, to the Tropical Aquaculture
Lab in Ruskin. This University of Florida lab works closely with
the tropical fish industry, which has a large presence in Tampa
Bay. Still others went to Mote.
</P>
<P>
Challenging process
</P>
<P>
Scientists at the Hillsborough lab went to work with equipment
similar to what you might get from Lowe's or Home Depot. They cut
the corals with a tile saw, and used epoxy to glue them onto
small concrete disks. They monitored the different species of
brain coral, boulder coral and others.
</P>
<P>
In December, scientists went to Western Sambo Reef and used more
epoxy to glue the disks in place.
</P>
<P>
"I like the challenge," said Ryan Czaja of the aquarium, who
dives to place and inspect the coral. "It's something I always
felt, why can't it be done?"
</P>
<P>
Everyone in the project stressed that growing coral in "farms"
and placing it in the wild is a complicated process that may take
years to accomplish and study. But they have high hopes.
</P>
<P>
"If restoration of coral reefs is going to occur, you need
corals," Watson said of the aquaculture lab. "If we can't grow
them outside of the coral reef, you're not going to get them."

Great star coral, or Montastrea cavernosa, at the University of
Florida Tropical Aquaculture Laboratory in Ruskin is being raised
in an effort to restore reefs in the Florida Keys. This image is

of a cluster of individual coral polyps, or animals.
