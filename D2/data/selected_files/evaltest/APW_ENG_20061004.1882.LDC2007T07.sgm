Two relatives of the man who attacked Amish school girls said Monday
they were not molested by him 20 years ago, as he had claimed in a
phone call to his wife during the siege.

Charles Carl Roberts IV revealed to his family in notes he left behind
and in a cell phone call from inside the West Nickel Mines Amish
School that he was tormented by memories of molesting two young
relatives 20 years ago. He also spoke of having dreams about doing it
again.

Investigators spoke to the two women, who would have been 4 or 5 at
the time, and they said there was no such abuse.

"Both of them have no recollection of being sexually assaulted by
Roberts," state police Trooper Linette Quinn said. "They were
absolutely sure they had no contact with Roberts."

Roberts stormed the school and shot 10 girls before turning the gun on
himself. Investigators said Roberts, who brought lubricating jelly and
plastic restraints with him, may have been planning to sexually
assault the Amish girls.
