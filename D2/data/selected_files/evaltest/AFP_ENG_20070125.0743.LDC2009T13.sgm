Tuna meet in Japan to adopt first global action plan
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An international meeting aimed at saving global tuna populations
from overfishing is set Friday to adopt a first-of-a-kind global
action plan.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, involving representatives from 60 countries or
areas, is concluding a five-day meet in the Japanese city of
Kobe. Japan is the world's biggest tuna consumer, eating one
quarter of the global catch.
</P>
<P>
"We have a general agreement on the action plan," a member of the
Australian delegation said after the Thursday session. "I'd be
very disappointed if we will not adopt it tomorrow."
</P>
<P>
The meeting was the first to bring together the world's five tuna
conservation bodies that cover different regions, including the
Pacific Ocean, Atlantic Ocean and Indian Ocean.
</P>
<P>
The action plan is expected to address ways to share information
among such regions to monitor tuna numbers and control illegal
fishing vessels. So far the five conservation bodies have lacked
global standards on tuna-fishing.
</P>
<P>
Japan, which initiated the conference, has faced pressure from
environmentalists, who say a worldwide fad for Japanese food is
bringing tuna numbers to the brink of eventual extinction.
