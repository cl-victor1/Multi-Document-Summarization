BEIJING, March 15 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
China's Health Ministry made public Wednesday an interim
regulation aimed at strengthening coordination of food safety
inspection in the 31 provinces, municipalities and autonomous
regions on the Chinese mainland.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry is soliciting public opinion on the regulation,
which is posted on its website.
</P>
<P>
The regulation stipulates that health watchdogs at the provincial
level have to inform their counterparts about cases of
substandard food sold or manufactured within their jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
The two sides should debrief each other through express mail,
direct phone, fax or E-mail.
</P>
<P>
The Health Ministry is responsible for supervising such
information across the country.

<P>
Last year China experienced a string of food safety problems
including steroid- tainted pork, parasite-infested snails,
turbots that contain excessive amount of carcinogens, and ducks
that were fed cancer-causing dye to make their egg yolks red.
</P>
<P>
Food poisoning claimed 196 lives in China last year, according to
the Ministry.
