Three trials now proof that circumcision prevents AIDS infection:
scientists
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Trials showing that male circumcision more than halves the risk
of HIV infection are published in The Lancet on Friday, giving
the seal of approval to calls for circumcision to be cautiously
launched as an AIDS prevention strategy.
</P>
<P>
The trials, conducted in Kenya and Uganda and earlier in South
Africa, found that men who were uncircumcised were twice as
likely to catch the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) compared
with circumcised counterparts.
</P>
<P>
The data were so dramatic that the trials in Kenya and Uganda
were halted ahead of schedule, for it would have been ethically
wrong to continue them.
</P>
<P>
The trials' results were announced by their researchers last
year.
</P>
<P>
But Friday's publication in the peer-assessed Lancet of the Kenya
and Uganda research is the medical community's de-facto
validation of the findings, and enshrines circumcision's place in
the war against AIDS.
</P>
<P>
"We have proof of a permanent intervention that can reduce the
risk of HIV infection in men, which is positive news about
prevention after past and current disappointments," said a
commentary by Marie-Louise Newell and Till Barnighausen of the
University of KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa and the Harvard
School of Public Health.
</P>
<P>
They calculate that in KwaZulu-Natal province, where HIV
incidence is very high but circumcision rates very low, 35,000
new infections could have been prevented in 2007 alone if the 2.5
million men there had been circumcised.
</P>
<P>
In addition to being preventive, circumcision also carries cost
benefits. The operation is cheap, whereas treatment for HIV
infection entails a lifelong dependence on expensive drugs.
</P>
<P>
But Newell and Barnighausen join other experts in saying that the
urge to swiftly implement circumcision should be leavened with
caution.
</P>
<P>
Governments and doctors have to tread carefully in advising
circumcision, they said. In some cultures, circumcision is
considered a rite of passage to adulthood and a symbol of
manhood; in others, it is considered an emasculation.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the operation has to be conducted in sterile
conditions by trained personnel, and this will require resources
for awareness campaigns and set up medical facilities.
</P>
<P>
Most importantly, reduction of risk is not the same as
elimination of risk, which means that circumcised men should
still be encouraged to wear a condom.
</P>
<P>
"The emerging truth is that no single approach alone will be able
to stem the spread of HIV," The Lancet said in an editorial.
</P>
<P>
Botched operations and the temptations of unsafe sex could
squander a historic opportunity, it said.
</P>
<P>
In Geneva, the World Health Organization (WHO) and UNAIDS
welcomed publication of the trials in Kenya and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
"Male circumcision has major potential for the prevention of HIV
infection," said Kevin De Cock, director of the WHO's HIV/AIDS
department.
</P>
<P>
WHO and UNAIDS have convened an international meeting in early
March to examine the results of the new trials and assess their
impact on AIDS policies.
</P>
<P>
The theory behind circumcision's protective effect is that the
foreskin has a very thin epithelium, or lining, and easily
suffers minor abrasions during intercourse.
</P>
<P>
These microscopic cuts make it easier for the AIDS virus to enter
the man's bloodstream.
</P>
<P>
Another mooted reason is that the foreskin is rich in so-called
Langerhans cells whose surface configuration makes it easy for
the AIDS virus to latch on to them.
