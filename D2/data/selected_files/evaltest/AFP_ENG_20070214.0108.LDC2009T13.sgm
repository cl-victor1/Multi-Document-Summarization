Leading suspects in the Madrid train bombs trial
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Of the 29 people who go on trial Thursday for the March 2004
Madrid train bombings, seven face some 40,000 years in jail if
found guilty.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution has identified six as the chief plotters behind
Spain's worst ever militant attack.
</P>
<P>
Three men are suspected to have organised the bombings of four
commuter trains, which killed 191 people and injured 1,824.
</P>
<P>
They are, Rabei Ousmane Sayed Ahmed, a 35-year-old Egyptian.
Nicknamed "Mohammed the Egyptian", he is charged with 191
murders, 1,824 attempted murders and running a terrorist
organisation.
</P>
<P>
He faces 38,656 years in jail, although under Spanish law he
could only serve a maximum 40 years.
</P>
<P>
Sayed Ahmed was arrested on June 7, 2004, in Italy. He was
temporarily extradited to Spain but sent back to Milan and
sentenced last November to 10 years in jail before being returned
to Spain.
</P>
<P>
Hassan Al Haski, alias "Abu Hamza," is also accused of planning
the blasts.
</P>
<P>
A 43-year-old Moroccan, he faces the same charges and potential
jail sentence.
</P>
<P>
He was arrested on December 21, 2004, for presumed membership of
the Moroccan Islamic Combat Group (GICM), an Al-Qaeda affiliate
believed to have conceived the bombings.
</P>
<P>
Youssef Belhadj, alias "the Afghan," is the third accused
logistical planner. A 30-year-old Moroccan, he also faces the
38,656-year jail sentence.
</P>
<P>
Arrested on February 1, 2005, in Belgium, Belhadj was extradited
the following April. He is the cousin of Mohamed Belhadj, who
rented an apartment in the Madrid suburb of Leganes, where seven
men blew themselves up during a police raid three weeks after the
bombings.
</P>
<P>
The suspected bombers are Jamal Zougam, a 33-year-old Moroccan
who has been charged with 191 murders, 1,824 murders and
membership of a terrorist organisation.
</P>
<P>
Arrested on March 19, 2004, Zougam owned a mobile phone shop in
Madrid's high- immigrant district of Lavapies.
</P>
<P>
People on some of the "trains of death" say they remember seeing
Zougam, previously said by anti-terrorist judge Baltasar Garzon
to have links with a Spanish Al-Qaeda cell accused of aiding in
the September 11, 2001 attacks in the United States.
</P>
<P>
He was not charged on that occasion but Morocco told Spain in
2003 that Zougam was "particularly dangerous".
</P>
<P>
Another alleged bomber was Abdelmajid Bouchar, a 24-year-old
Moroccan.
</P>
<P>
Bouchar was arrested in Montenegro on June 23, 2005, for breaking
immigration laws after being found to be holding an Iraqi
passport and was extradited to Spain three months later.
</P>
<P>
Nicknamed "the Zebra", he fled just before police raided the flat
where seven top suspects blew themselves up.
</P>
<P>
Bouchar's fingerprints were found at a Madrid house where the
bombs were put together and investigators say he took supplies to
the Leganes seven.
</P>
<P>
Basel Ghalyoun, a Syrian who turns 27 on February 25, is also
accused of being a bomber.
</P>
<P>
Ghalyoun is said to have been closely linked to Serhane Ben
Abdelmajid Fakhet, one of the seven who blew themselves up in the
police raid.
</P>
<P>
Although neither an alleged planner or an alleged bomber,
Spaniard Jose Emilio Suarez Trashorras faces the most charges as
a suspected supplier of explosives in exchange for drugs.
</P>
<P>
The 30-year-old former miner faces murder charges for the 191
killed, the attempted murders of the injured and is further
accused of the murder of a policeman who died in the raid at
Leganes. He is also charged with the attempted murder of 10 other
police and faces 38,654 years in jail.
