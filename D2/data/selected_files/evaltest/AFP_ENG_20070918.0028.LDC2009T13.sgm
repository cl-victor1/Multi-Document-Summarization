O.J. Simpson to face kidnapping, armed robbery charges
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former American football star O.J. Simpson has been charged with
eight offences, including kidnapping and armed robbery, court
documents showed Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Simpson, an iconic sports star who was dramatically acquitted of
brutally murdering his ex-wife and her friend 12 years ago, is to
appear in court in Las Vegas on Wednesday for an arraignment
hearing.
</P>
<P>
The charges against Simpson and three other men were detailed in
a criminal complaint filed by Nevada prosecutors in Clark County
on Tuesday, following the fallen icon's arrest on Sunday in
connection with an alleged armed robbery.
</P>
<P>
Simpson and the men have been charged with seven felony offences:
conspiracy to commit kidnapping; conspiracy to commit robbery;
first degree kidnapping with use of a deadly weapon; burglary
with a deadly weapon; robbery with a deadly weapon; assault with
a deadly weapon and coercion with a deadly weapon.
</P>
<P>
The four men have also been charged with the misdemeanor offence
of conspiracy to commit a crime.
</P>
<P>
If convicted on the most serious charges Simpson would face
several years, possibly decades, in prison.
</P>
<P>
The charges stem from an incident at the Palace Station casino on
Thursday, when a gang of gun-toting men that included Simpson is
reported to have stormed into a hotel room and snatched sporting
memorabilia from two dealers.
</P>
<P>
Simpson is currently behind bars in Las Vegas in connection with
the alleged robbery. In interviews with US media prior to his
arrest he denied robbery, saying he was only recovering items
that had been illegally stolen from him.
</P>
<P>
One of the most famous American football players of his
generation during the 1970s, Simpson was the prime suspect in the
1994 murders of his ex-wife Nicole and her friend Ron Goldman.
</P>
<P>
Simpson, who has always vehemently denied the killings, was
acquitted of them after a racially charged Los Angeles trial in
1995, a verdict that was greeted with widespread outrage across
America.
</P>
<P>
Simpson was subsequently found liable for the deaths in a 1997
civil suit and was ordered to pay damages to the victims'
families totaling 33.5 million dollars.
