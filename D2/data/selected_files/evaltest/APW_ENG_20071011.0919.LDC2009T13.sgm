Drug makers on Thursday voluntarily pulled kids' cold medicines
off the market less than two weeks after the U.S. government
warned of potential health risks to infants.
</P>
<P>
Products aimed at children under the age of 2 are being removed
from store shelves due to "rare instances of misuse" that could
lead to accidental overdose, a trade group that represents over-
the-counter drug makers said.
</P>
<P>
Cold medicines being withdrawn include Johnson &amp; Johnson
Pediacare Infant Drops and Tylenol Concentrated Infants Drops,
Wyeth's Dimetapp Decongestant Infant Drops, Novartis' Triaminic
Infant &amp; Toddler Thin Strips and Prestige Brands Holdings'
Little Colds Decongestant Plus Cough.
</P>
<P>
CVS Caremark Corp. said Thursday it would remove the affected
products as well as CVS-brand equivalents from store shelves.
</P>
<P>
Late last month, the Food and Drug Administration tentatively
recommended adding labeling to the medicines indicating they are
not to be used for young children.
</P>
<P>
Current labeling directs parents to consult a doctor before
administering the drugs to infants and toddlers, and many doctors
say they are safe to use.
</P>
<P>
The FDA will formally consider revising labeling at a meeting
scheduled for Oct. 18-19.
</P>
<P>
After reviewing reports of side effects over the last four
decades, FDA found 54 child fatalities from over-the-counter
decongestant medicines. The agency found 69 reports of children's
deaths connected with antihistamines, which are used to treat
runny noses.
</P>
<P>
Shares of Johnson and Johnson rose 22 cents to $66.05 while
shares of Wyeth fell 17 cents to $45.99. Shares of Novartis AG
dipped one cent to $54.07 and Prestige Brands Holdings Inc. fell
7 cents to $11.09.
