Atlanta zoo hatches rare turtle

Zoo Atlanta officials said Tuesday they hatched a rare Arakan
forest turtle this week, marking the fourth of the brown-and-tan
spotted reptiles to be born there.
</P>
<P>
The zoo is the only facility in the world successfully breeding
the Arakan forest turtle, a species native to Myanmar that is on
the list of the world's most critically endangered species. They
were believed to be extinct for close to a century, but the
turtles turned up in Asian food markets in the mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
Scientists blame the rapid disappearance of the Arakan forest
turtle -- much like other shelled reptiles -- on their popularity
in Asia for cooking and medicinal purposes.
</P>
<P>
The turtle, native to the Arakan hills of western Myanmar, has an
abysmal survival rate. Two of the zoo's four hatchlings have died
so far, and scientists say few of the turtles make it through the
transport from their natural habitat to zoos and other
conservation facilities.
</P>
<P>
"The animals seem to be extremely difficult to establish in
captivity," said Peter Paul van Dijk, director of the tortoise
and freshwater turtle program for Conservation International.
</P>
<P>
Though conservationists prefer to preserve endangered animals
within their natural habitats, captive breeding programs act as
"as insurance policies," particularly with the demand for turtles
in Asia, he said.
</P>
<P>
"It's really a tragedy to lose a species that took millions of
years to evolve," van Dijk said. "It's irreplaceable."
</P>
<P>
There are 12 of the turtles living in captivity in the United
States -- at Zoo Atlanta, the St. Louis Zoo, the Miami Metro Zoo
and River Banks Zoo and Garden in Columbia, South Carolina.
