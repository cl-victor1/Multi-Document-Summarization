HARARE, April 7 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's Parks and Wildlife Management Authority officials is
preparing plans on how to deal with the proposal to ban
international trade in ivory, the official New Ziana reported on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The authority director general Morris Mutsambiwa said they have
already discussed responses to the proposal by Kenya and Mali to
ban international trade in ivory.
</P>
<P>
Mutsambiwa said recommendations of the SADC countries would be
taken to the African Range of States a few weeks before the
Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES)
conference to be held in June this year so that the continent
would take a common position to the international conference.
</P>
<P>
He said Zimbabwe did not want a repeat of the last CITES meeting
when some African countries disowned the common position that had
been agreed on.
</P>
<P>
Kenya and Mali are proposing an international ban on trade in
ivory arguing that it was causing poaching of its elephants.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government has prepared a 62-page document that it
will take to CITES justifying its proposals.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Zimbabwe is arguing that instead of banning the trade,
countries should put in place adequate measures to prevent
poaching of wildlife as it has done.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe has invested heavily in protecting its wildlife
resulting in the country becoming a prime tourist destination.
</P>
<P>
"If international trade is killed, it will destroy jobs for
traders and other downstream industries," said Mutsambiwa.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Britain are using some African countries to
settle their political differences with Zimbabwe through
sponsoring them to take positions and decisions that adversely
affect the country's economy, Mutsambiwa added.
