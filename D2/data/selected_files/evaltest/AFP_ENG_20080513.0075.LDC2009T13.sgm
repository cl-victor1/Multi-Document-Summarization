Seven bombs kill 80 in Indian tourist city
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Seven near-simultaneous bomb blasts tore through crowded markets
in the Indian tourist city of Jaipur Tuesday, killing at least 80
people and wounding 200 in what police said was a terror attack.
</P>
<P>
"We have information that 80 people have died," Rajasthan state
home minister Gulab Chand Kataria told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"One suspect was detained and is being investigated," he added in
Jaipur, the state capital.
</P>
<P>
One of the explosions went off near a packed Hindu temple,
leaving pools of blood outside in the street and cycles and
rickshaws in a mangled heap, television pictures showed.
</P>
<P>
Among the 80 dead were a 10-year-old boy at the Hanuman (monkey
god) temple, a bride in a bright red saree still wearing marriage
bangles and a young man covered in blood who was left hanging
over the twisted wreckage of a bicycle rickshaw, the Press Trust
of India said.
</P>
<P>
Shopping bags, bloodied sandals and shoes were strewn around
Johri bazaar, one of the hit markets, which security forces
cleared quickly for fear of further blasts.
</P>
<P>
One live bomb was found attached to a bicycle at one of the
explosion sites and was defused, police said.
</P>
<P>
Government officials usually blame Islamic militants based in
Pakistan for such attacks, which have plagued India in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
Junior home minister Shriprakash Jaiswal told reporters, "The
people responsible for these attacks have foreign connections,"
but he refused to point a finger directly at traditional foe
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Press Trust of India, which said 200 had been injured, quoted a
statement from Pakistan Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani saying
his country, "condemns all acts of terrorism and reaffirms its
firm commitment to fight this scourge together with the
international community."
</P>
<P>
Police said seven blasts occurred within minutes of each other
during the evening in crowded markets of old walled Jaipur, about
260 kilometres (160 miles) from New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
"It's a terror attack. There was no (intelligence) report of
this," police director general A.S. Gill told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Manmohan Singh condemned the blasts and appealed
for calm, while the United States immediately condemned the wave
of bombings.
</P>
<P>
"We're still collecting some information about this. But given
the facts that we know now, quite clearly these bombs were
intended to claim innocent life and it's something that we very
clearly condemn," US state department spokesman Sean McCormack
said.
</P>
<P>
Historic Jaipur, which has a population of more than two million,
is one of India's top tourist resorts and a favourite attraction
for foreigners.
</P>
<P>
Jaipur is popularly known as the 'pink city' because of the
ochre-pink hue of its hill top forts, Hindu maharajah's palaces
and crenellated city walls.
</P>
<P>
State borders were sealed and a high alert sounded in Rajasthan
state and neighbouring areas, police said.
</P>
<P>
The government also issued a nationwide security alert,
particularly in New Delhi, where roadblocks were set up on major
roads, and the financial capital Mumbai.
</P>
<P>
The bombings took place as India marked the 10th anniversary of
nuclear tests conducted on May 13 in Rajasthan, but it was
unclear if there was any link.
</P>
<P>
India has been plagued by bombings across the country in recent
years and routinely points the finger at foreign-based Islamic
militant groups fighting New Delhi's rule in the Himalayan state
of Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
In October last year, an explosion killed six people and wounded
32 in a packed cinema hall in Ludhiana in Punjab state in
northern India. Police called it a "terrorist" bombing.
</P>
<P>
In August, 43 people were killed and 70 injured in the southern
city of Hyderabad when attackers triggered blasts at an outdoor
auditorium and a popular eatery.
</P>
<P>
A series of explosions outside courts in three northern cities
killed 13 last November.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say Islamic extremist groups are attempting to stoke
sectarian tensions to derail an India-Pakistan peace process and
damage the country's booming economy.
