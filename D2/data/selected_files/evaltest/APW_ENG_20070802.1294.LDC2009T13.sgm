LOS ANGELES 2007-08-02 17:59:16 UTC

<P>
Mattel apologized Thursday to customers affected by a recall
nearly a million toys from its Fisher-Price division and said the
move will cut pretax operating income at the world's largest
toymaker by $30 million (euro22 million).
</P>
<P>
The plastic preschool toys were made in China with paint found to
have excessive amounts of lead.
</P>
<P>
"We apologize to everyone affected by this recall, especially
those who bought the toys in question," Robert A. Eckert, Mattel
Inc.'s chairman and CEO, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"Our goal is to correct this problem, improve our systems and
maintain the trust of the families that have allowed us to be
part of their lives by acting responsibly and quickly to address
their concerns," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mattel shares fell 55 cents, or 2.3 percent, to $23.03 in
afternoon trading Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The apology came a day after El Segundo-based Mattel disclosed
the recall of 967,000 toys manufactured by a Chinese vendor and
sold in the United States between May and August.
</P>
<P>
Included in the recall were 83 types of toys based on the popular
characters Big Bird, Elmo and Dora, among others.
</P>
<P>
Mattel will adjust its already reported 2007 second-quarter
results to reflect the impact of the recall, the company said in
a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
Mattel also said it was not aware of any additional issues
related to lead in paints with its products but cannot guarantee
that more issues will not be identified.
</P>
<P>
"We require our manufacturing partners to use paint from approved
and certified suppliers and have procedures in place to test and
verify, but in this particular case our procedures were not
followed," Jim Walter, Mattel's senior vice president of
worldwide quality assurance, said in a statement. "We are
investigating the cause to ensure such events do not reoccur."
</P>
<P>
The company said it was reviewing the procedures of all of its
manufacturing partners in China.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Mattel reported a 15 percent increase in its second-
quarter profit on strong sales of toy cars.
