DNA from ivory may lead to poachers

<P>
The complex science of DNA analysis is now helping protect
elephants by showing police and conservationists the source of
black-market ivory.
</P>
<P>
The price of ivory has nearly quadrupled in recent years,
prompting poachers to kill more elephants to sell their tusks
illegally.
</P>
<P>
Protecting the giant beasts is complicated by the fact they
spread across large parts of Africa and authorities are unsure
where the illegal hunting is occurring.
</P>
<P>
But the seizure of more than six tons of ivory in Singapore in
2002 has helped solve part of that puzzle, according to a report
by Samuel K. Wasser of the Center for Conservation Biology at the
University of Washington in this week's online edition of
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
Wasser and colleagues took samples of the confiscated ivory and
compared it with baseline DNA collected from elephants across the
continent over several years. DNA is the internal blueprint for
life that carries the genes that develop into each individual.
</P>
<P>
The comparison showed that the tusks seized from the black market
came from elephants on Africa's broad savannas, primarily from a
small area of southern Africa, most likely centered on Zambia,
the researchers said.
</P>
<P>
Authorities had suspected the confiscated ivory had multiple
origins, the researchers said, but "our results caused law
enforcement to substantially narrow the area of origin and the
trade routes being investigated."
</P>
<P>
The research was funded by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service,
African Elephant Conservation Fund, the International Fund for
Animal Welfare, the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation and the
Center for Conservation Biology.
