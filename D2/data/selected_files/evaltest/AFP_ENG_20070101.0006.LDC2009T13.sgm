Search continues for Indonesia ferry survivors by Nabiha Shahab
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Indonesian navy ships on Monday renewed efforts to reach
survivors of a ferry disaster who spent a third night on the open
sea as continuing rough weather hindered the search for hundreds
still missing.
</P>
<P>
"Navy ships are still searching now. We're still trying the best
we can," Central Java navy commander Colonel Yan Simamora told
AFP.
</P>
<P>
Fishermen and search and rescue teams have thus far found around
200 survivors following the sinking of the ferry off the coast of
Java late Friday with some 600 on board, officials said.
</P>
<P>
The ill-fated ferry was en route from Kumai on Borneo island to
the Javanese port city of Semarang when it sank. Initial
investigations showed bad weather was likely to blame.
</P>
<P>
Eleven survivors and two bodies were brought in here before dawn
Monday. Search and rescue workers had to carry the survivors who
were too weak to walk off the fishing boat which picked them up.
</P>
<P>
Other rescue efforts were focusing on three liferafts with around
30 to 40 survivors which were found by helicopters on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Transport Minister Hatta Radjasa told ElShinta radio the
survivors seemed healthy and had waved to the helicopters.
</P>
<P>
But Simamora said bad weather had made it impossible to pick them
up Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"We did try to evacuate them by air, but the weather did not
permit us to do so as the waves were up to four metres high and
it was raining heavily," he told ElShinta, adding that food and
drinks had been dropped to them.
</P>
<P>
Some 177 survivors had been rescued, the official Antara news
agency quoted the transport ministry as saying late Saturday.
</P>
<P>
But Radjasa later said 157 had been saved, with 125 already
ashore and others being brought in on ships.
</P>
<P>
Navy ships were also bringing in about 60 bodies to the port of
Rembang in Central Java, ElShinta reported.
</P>
<P>
Warships, fishing vessels and helicopters have braved continuing
bad weather and rough seas to scour the waters off the north
coast of Java since the "Senopati Nusantara" (Archipelago
Commander) sank.
</P>
<P>
Meteorologists warned the bad weather would continue for the next
few days.
</P>
<P>
"The weather is still not conducive for sailing. We expect waves
as high as two to four metres (six to 12 feet) in north Java,
east Java and in central Java," said Arif Triono from the
Meteorology and Geophysics Agency in Surabaya, East Java.
</P>
<P>
"Besides high waves in these areas, we also expect heavy and
continuous rains with strong winds up to 80 kilometres (50 miles)
per hour," he told AFP.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary investigations showed bad weather was to blame for
the accident, officials said as they continued to collect data.
</P>
<P>
"Our investigation so far shows that bad weather coupled with
high and heavy waves had caused the ferry to sink," said Setio
Rahardjo, head of the National Committee on Transportation
Safety.
</P>
<P>
"We have not had evidence of a collision or any carelessness by
the Senopati," Antara quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
The vessel was carrying 542 passengers and 57 crew when it sank.
It was licensed to carry 850.
</P>
<P>
It was still not known exactly where the ferry sank, but search
efforts were being concentrated in the seas between Surabaya and
Semarang off the north coast of central Java.
</P>
<P>
Officials said they lost contact with the vessel around midnight
(1700 GMT) Friday.
</P>
<P>
Ferries are a crucial link between the archipelago nation's
17,000 islands and frequently carry more people than officially
acknowledged. Boats are also often overloaded due to lax safety
standards.
