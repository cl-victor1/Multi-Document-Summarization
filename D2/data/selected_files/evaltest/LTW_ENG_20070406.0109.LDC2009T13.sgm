The United States and southern Europe will be far better prepared
than the poor nations of Africa to deal with more frequent
drought.

For the U.S., the biggest problem in a future of chronic drought
would be water shortages. The seven Colorado basin states --
Colorado, Wyoming, Utah, Nevada, New Mexico, Arizona, California
-- would battle each other for diminished Colorado River flows.
Mexico, which has a share of the river under a 1944 treaty and
has complained of U.S. diversions in the past, would join the
conflict.

Inevitably, water be would reallocated from agriculture, which
uses most of the West's supplies, to urban users, drying up
farms. California would come under pressure to build desalination
plants on the coast, despite environmental concerns.

``This is a situation that is going to cause water wars,'' said
Kevin Trenberth, a scientist at the National Center for
Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo.

``If there's not enough water to meet everybody's allocation, how
do you divide it up?''
</P>
<P>
Officials from seven states recently forged a agreement about how
to handle the current drought, which has left the Colorado
River's big reservoirs -- Lake Powell and Lake Mead -- roughly
half empty. Without some very wet years, federal water managers
say Lake Mead may never completely refill.
