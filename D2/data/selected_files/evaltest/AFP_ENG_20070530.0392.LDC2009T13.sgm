Charles Taylor defence has enough resources: prosecutor
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The defence of Liberian ex-president Charles Taylor, whose war
crimes trial is set to start Monday, has "fully adequate
resources," the prosecutor of the Special Court for Sierra Leone
said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the defence has fully adequate resources to
defend this case, the same level of resources as provided, if not
greater than provided, by the other tribunals," prosecutor
Stephen Rapp who will try Taylor's case told journalists.
</P>
<P>
The former Liberian leader will be tried in The Hague by a
special chamber of the UN-backed Special Court for Sierra Leone,
for security reasons.
</P>
<P>
Rapp stressed that the prosecution did have more resources that
the defence because the prosecution "has the burden of proof to
prove a case beyond a reasonable doubt."
</P>
<P>
"So the great burden is on us. (The defence) just have to take
out one element on each case, an essential element and they win
an acquittal," the prosecutor explained.
</P>
<P>
In the run-up to the trial Taylor's lawyers had complained that
there were insufficient resources for the defence with just two
attorneys versus some nine prosecution trial lawyers. They also
demanded more time to prepare their case, but were turned down.
