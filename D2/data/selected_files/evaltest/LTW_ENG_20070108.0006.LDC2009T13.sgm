Threatened by Warming: Polar Bear as Harbinger

The following editorial appeared in Sunday's Washington Post:

The Bush administration has done everything in its power to do as
little as possible about climate change. Yet the reality of
global warming has a way of intruding even on the most willfully
heedless of politicians. Not even an administration dead set
against mandatory curbs on carbon emissions can deny that the
habitat of the polar bear, as Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne
put it the other day, ``may literally be melting.'' In response,
the administration is proposing to list the polar bear as a
threatened species under the Endangered Species Act.

Such a listing would have symbolic and practical importance.
Polar bears live most of their lives on sea ice, which is
diminishing in an Arctic region warming much faster than more
temperate regions of the globe. A formal designation, following a
lengthy period of comment and analysis, would acknowledge that
the law compels action at least to mitigate the effects of global
climate change. What's more, it's hard to see how one could act
to preserve polar bear habitat without taking steps to reduce
fossil fuel consumption and slow the rate of carbon emissions
into the atmosphere.

The administration proposed the polar bear designation only after
environmental groups petitioned for it and then sued to force a
decision. Still, when confronted with the need to make a
decision, it made the right one -- and thereby set the stage for
action down the road. Cuddly, loveable animals -- even ferocious
ones that can kill a seal with a single blow of a monster-strong
paw -- have a way of precipitating steps that non-furry creatures
just can't manage. Unfortunately, the threat to these majestic
giants of the North is all too real.
