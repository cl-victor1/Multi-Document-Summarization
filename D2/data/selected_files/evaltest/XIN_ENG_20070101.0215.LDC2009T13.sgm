<P>
Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono said Tuesday he was
deeply concerned with the crash of a passenger plane and the
sinking of a ferry in the last few days that might have killed
hundreds of people.
</P>
<P>
A Boeing 737-400 plane with 102 people onboard crashed into a
mountain in the West Sulawesi province Monday, killing at least
90 people.

<P>
Earlier on Friday, a ferry carrying 628 people sank off the Java
coast with some 400 passengers reported missing.

<P>
On Thursday, another ferry overturned off Sumatra and some 26
passengers were missing.

<P>
Speaking at a ceremony to mark the resumption of the Jakarta
Stock Exchange, Susilo blamed violent weather for the disasters.
</P>
<P>
"The culture of becoming vigilant to the weather factor has not
existed among our societies... I have told the transport minister
to investigate if our ships are built and designed to be capable
of overcoming bad weathers," he said.
