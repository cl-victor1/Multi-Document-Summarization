Malaysian authorities seized a second Chinese trawler allegedly
poaching endangered turtles and other marine animals from waters
off its coast this week, newspapers reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Marine police on Wednesday stopped a fishing boat from China's
Hainan province near the coast of Malaysia's eastern Sabah state
and found more than 200 protected green and hawksbill turtle
species on board, The Star and the New Straits Times reported.
Only about 20 of the turtles were still alive, the newspapers
said.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, officers stopped another Chinese fishing trawler in a
nearby area and discovered more than 70 green and hawksbill
turtles, most of which were dead, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
"This is a serious offense," state Marine Police Chief Sueb
Abdullah was quoted as saying in The Star. "Not only have they
encroached into our waters, they were catching internationally
protected turtles."
</P>
<P>
Officers also found three live sharks and a shark skin on the
vessel on Wednesday, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
A total of 17 crew members were also being held for encroachment,
they said.
</P>
<P>
Phone calls to Sueb's office for further details went unanswered
Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
Turtles are poached for their shell, for decorative items and
meat, which is believed in many Asian cultures to have medicinal
value. Both green and hawksbill turtles are listed as endangered
by global conservation group WWF.
