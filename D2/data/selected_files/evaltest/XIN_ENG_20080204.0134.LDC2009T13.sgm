JERUSALEM, Feb. 4 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
One Israeli woman was killed and at least eight others wounded on
Monday in a suicide bombing which ripped through a commercial
center in the southern Israeli town of Dimona, the first attack
of the kind since January 2007.
</P>
<P>
Loud explosion rocked Dimona at 10:00 a.m. local time (0800 GMT)
as a suicide bomber detonated an explosive belt in the commercial
center, according to local media reports.
</P>
<P>
A second suicide bombers was shot dead by Israeli police before
he set off the explosive device. Sappers were dispatched to the
scene to detonate the device in a controlled manner.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, local daily Yedioth Ahronoth put the death toll at
three.
</P>
<P>
Magen David Adom ambulances have evacuated the wounded to Soroka
Hospital in Beersheba.
</P>
<P>
About 20 ambulances and large police forces were dispatched to
the scene and residents there were pushed away by the police for
fear of another explosion device.
</P>
<P>
An eyewitness said that "I see police here, roads have been
blocked. People are panicking. The firefighters are here. There
are dozens of people around and everyone is hysterical."
</P>
<P>
Dimona is the site of Israel's nuclear reactor and the explosion
took place about 10 kilometers from the reactor site.
</P>
<P>
The "Army of Palestine" wing of Fatah's al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades
claimed responsibility for the attack in Dimona along with the
Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), according
to local Channel 2 Television.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Hezbollah's television station al-Manar reported that
the two suicide bombers were residents of the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
Hamas hailed the Dimona attack as "a heroic act" and "a natural
response to the crimes of the occupation."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli security establishment is looking into the
possibility that the suicide bombers crossed into Israel through
the Gaza-Egypt border.
</P>
<P>
Israeli security forces had been on high alert after Palestinian
militants blew open Gaza's border with Egypt on Jan. 23, raising
fears that militants might sneak into Israel from Egypt.
</P>
<P>
A security source said "it is still too early in the
investigation to determine the terrorists' route, but the
breached border between Gaza and Egypt certainly increased the
threat."
</P>
<P>
However, the investigation has yet to rule out the possibility
that the bombers came from the West Bank, since there is no
separation fence in the area.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli army and Shin Bet (Israel Security Agency) are also
trying to locate anyone who might have assisted the terrorists.
The defense establishment believes that more terror cells are
located in Egypt's Sinai Peninsula and may have already crossed
over to Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israeli security brass have expressed their fear over the past
few days that terrorists would infiltrate southern Israel from
the Gaza Strip through the breached Philadelphi Corridor.
</P>
<P>
Shin Bet chief Yuval Diskin said during a cabinet security
briefing on Sunday that considerable amounts of high quality
weaponry have been smuggled into Gaza through the breached border
with Egypt along the Philadelphi Corridor.
</P>
<P>
On Jan. 23, Hamas militants blew up the border wall separating
Gaza and Egypt, allowing tens of thousands of Palestinians living
in the poor isolated Gaza enclave to cross into Egypt to purchase
daily necessities.
