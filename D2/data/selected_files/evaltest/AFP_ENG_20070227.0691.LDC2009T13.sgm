DNA testing to identify origin of poached ivory
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A team of US scientists has used DNA testing to identify the
geographic origin of poached elephant tusks -- research they hope
may help curb the illegal ivory trade.
</P>
<P>
"Resurgence of illicit trade in African elephant ivory is placing
the elephant at renewed risk," the scientists said in a study
published this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of
Sciences.
</P>
<P>
"Regulation of this trade could be vastly improved by the ability
to verify the geographic origin of tusks," they said.
</P>
<P>
"Monitoring the origin of ivory passing through the major ivory
markets around the world would greatly assist efforts to contain
such trade."
</P>
<P>
The researchers used DNA testing to identify the geographic
origin of 6.5 tons of contraband ivory seized in Singapore in
June 2002. The tests revealed the ivory came from southern
Africa, most likely Zambia.
</P>
<P>
The seizure of the shipment from Malawi bound for the Far East
was the largest since a 1989 international convention banning the
ivory trade took effect and represented ivory from 3,000 to 6,500
elephants.
</P>
<P>
The researchers analyzed genetic similarities between the tusks
seized in 2002 and a reference database of elephant DNA samples
created by Samuel Wasser, the lead author of the study, and his
colleagues.
</P>
<P>
The researchers in collaboration with Interpol, the International
Police Organization, hope to use their findings and the database
to concentrate efforts in the most active poaching regions of
Africa.
</P>
<P>
Wasser, a biologist at the Center for Conservation Biology at the
University of Washington, said elephants were being slaughtered
at an unprecedented rate.
</P>
<P>
"The problem is so serious that the giant creatures might be on
the path to extinction unless Western nations reinstate strong
enforcement that all but halted black-market ivory trade in the
four years immediately after the (1989) ban was enacted," Wasser
said.
</P>
<P>
"Elephants are majestic animals and are not trivial to the
ecosystem. They are a keystone species and taking them out
significantly alters the habitat.  It has ripple effects on lots
of different species," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the study's authors, more than 23,400 kilograms
(51,480 pounds) of ivory was seized in the year ending in August
2006.
</P>
<P>
Assuming only about 10 percent of contraband is detected, the
actual amount of poached ivory was closer to 234,000 kilograms
(514,800 pounds), or 23,000 elephants, about five percent of
Africa's total population.
</P>
<P>
The researchers identified China's burgeoning economy as a "major
force driving the black-market ivory trade" and urged strong
enforcement against poaching and education.
