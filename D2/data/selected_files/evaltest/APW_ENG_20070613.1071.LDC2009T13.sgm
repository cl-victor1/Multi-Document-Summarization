Wildlife trade watchdog regulates trade in red coral

The global wildlife trade watchdog agreed Wednesday to regulate
sales of red coral, which conservationists say is under threat
from overfishing for the jewelry industry.
</P>
<P>
"This is the best possible decision to start getting the trade in
these corals under some form of international control," said
Ernie Cooper, a coral trade expert from wildlife monitoring
network TRAFFIC.
</P>
<P>
Delegates at the triennial meeting of the 171-nation Convention
on International Trade in Endangered Species put the coral on a
list of protected wildlife, meaning exporters will now have to
prove that the coral was harvested without threatening the
species' survival before they can sell it.
</P>
<P>
Red coral, also known by its Latin name corallium, is a slow-
growing deep-sea coral that grows all over the world but is
harvested mainly in the Mediterranean and parts of the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
In the Mediterranean, it is gathered by scuba divers but in some
other parts of the world fishermen still use trawl nets dragged
along the seabed -- a practice that devastates the coral.
</P>
<P>
Andy Bruckner of the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration, who drafted the U.S. proposal adopted at the
conference, welcomed its acceptance.
</P>
<P>
"Red coral is the most valuable and widely traded out of all the
coral species, and CITES protection will help ensure the future
of the species and the red coral industry," he said. "We are
pleased that the international community has recognized the
threats corallium face, and is taking the necessary steps to
safeguard these species."
</P>
<P>
The United States, the world's biggest market for corallium
products, imported more than 26 million pieces from 2001-2006,
says the environmental group SeaWeb, which lobbied for the CITES
protection.
</P>
<P>
Raw coral can sell for US$900 (euro670) per kilogram (2.2 pounds)
at auction and finished works of art or pieces of jewelry can
cost anywhere from US$20 (euro15) to US$20,000 (euro15,000)
depending on their size and quality.
</P>
<P>
Part of the reason the coral is so vulnerable is that it grows so
slowly -- in some cases just 1.5 millimeters (0.06 inches) or
less per year -- takes up to seven years to reach maturity and
has low reproduction rates.
</P>
<P>
Italian craftsmen from the town of Torre Del Greco near Naples
had lobbied against CITES regulating the trade, saying that they
had been harvesting it in a sustainable way for 800 years and
would continue to do so to preserve their livelihoods.
</P>
<P>
"We are not an industry; this is our tradition, our culture.
Coral is our life," Ciro Condito of Assocoral, a lobby group
representing the craftsmen, said before Wednesday's decision.
