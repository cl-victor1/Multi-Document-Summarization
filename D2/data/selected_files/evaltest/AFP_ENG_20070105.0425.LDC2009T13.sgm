Liberian ex-leader Taylor's lawyers threaten to withdraw
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The family of former Liberian president Charles Taylor, facing
charges of war crimes, said Friday that his lawyers have
threatened to withdraw from the case, claiming a lack of time and
resources.
</P>
<P>
"The lawyers argued that the time and resources available to them
were so inadequate that it places them in a position of conflict
with their professional obligation and renders the possibility of
fair trial impossible", the family said in a statement sent to
AFP.
</P>
<P>
"The lawyers threaten to withdraw their services if the situation
does not change", the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Taylor's family also accused the Special War Crimes Court in The
Hague, where the ex-leader is imprisoned, of violating Taylor's
right to privacy and right to legal professional privilege by
installing a video surveillance camera to record conferences with
his attorneys.
</P>
<P>
"That has compromised Mr. Taylor's ability to give instructions
and freely discuss with his defence counsels and other
individuals," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
His family complained that the prosecution currently has five
senior counsels in its team while the defence has two lawyers
with no proper offices both in The Hague and in Monrovia.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Taylor was said to be in good health in his
cell at The Hague where he mostly reads the Bible.
</P>
<P>
The trial of the ex-warlord, the biggest case before the UN-
backed court due to start in April, was moved out of Freetown and
to the premises of the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The
Hague to avoid stirring unrest in strife-prone west Africa.
</P>
<P>
Taylor is seen as the single most powerful figure behind a series
of civil wars in Liberia and neighbouring Sierra Leone between
1989 and 2003 which left some 400,000 people dead.
</P>
<P>
He faces a total of 11 charges of crimes against humanity, war
crimes and violations of international human rights and is
specifically accused of aiding rebel groups which murdered,
enslaved and mutilated civilians.
