HIV dementia alarmingly high in Africa: study

WASHINGTON, Jan. 29 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
An international study led by Johns Hopkins University suggests
on Monday that the rate of HIV-related dementia is so high in
sub-Saharan Africa that HIV dementia along with Alzheimer's
disease and dementia from strokes may be among the most common
forms of dementia in the world.
</P>
<P>
In the first study of HIV dementia on the African continent using
rigorous neurological and neuropsychological tests, 31 percent of
a small but presumably representative group of HIV-positive
patients in Uganda were found to have HIV dementia, according to
Ned Sacktor, M.D., a Johns Hopkins neurologist and senior author
of a multi-institutional study that will be published Jan. 29 in
Neurology.

<P>
HIV dementia is defined as memory, learning, behavioral and motor
disabilities that interfere with normal daily life and in extreme
cases lead to total disability and a bedridden state. Unlike
Alzheimer's- and stroke-induced dementia, HIV dementia is
treatable and potentially reversible with the same antiretroviral
medication that is used to treat the infection. Treatment can
even restore completely normal cognitive function to some of
those affected.
</P>
<P>
The study looked at 178 subjects in Kampala, Uganda, from
September 2003 to January 2004. Seventy-eight were HIV-positive
patients recruited from the Infectious Disease Clinic in Mulago
Hospital, Makerere University, and 100 were HIV-negative
individuals recruited from the AIDs Information Center who were
used to obtain normative data for the cognitive tests.
</P>
<P>
In diagnosing HIV dementia, researchers looked at medical history
and the results of a series of comprehensive neurological and
neuropsychological tests and functional assessments.
</P>
<P>
"Clearly, large-scale testing would have to be conducted before
we know the global reach of HIV dementia, but this study sends a
clear message that it exists in high proportions in sub-Saharan
Africa and is an under-recognized condition that needs to be
studied and treated," Sacktor says.
</P>
<P>
Of the estimated 40 million adults and children worldwide who are
living with HIV infection, an estimated 27 million live in sub-
Saharan Africa, according to Sacktor.
</P>
<P>
"If the rate we saw in our study translates across sub-Saharan
Africa, we're looking at more than 8,000,000 people in this
region with HIV dementia," says Sacktor.
</P>
<P>
Sacktor says an extremely high rate of HIV dementia in Africa and
other poor regions of the world adds enormously to the social and
economic burden of their populations and governments. Dementia
not only disrupts jobs and adds to the cost of care, but also
interferes with a patient's ability to adhere to a regular course
of antiretroviral medication, thus increasing the risk of drug
resistance.
</P>
<P>
"We hope studies like these will shed additional light on the
devastating problem of HIV in resource-limited countries like
Uganda and encourage more programs that bring much-needed
medication to these poor regions of the world," Sacktor says.
