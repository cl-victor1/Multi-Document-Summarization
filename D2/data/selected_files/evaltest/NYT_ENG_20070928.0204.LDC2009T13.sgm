EXPERTS AT FDA URGE FIRM ACTION ON CHILD DRUGS
</HEADLINE>

WASHINGTON
</P>
<P>
Safety experts for the Food and Drug Administration urged the
agency on Friday to consider an outright ban on over-the-counter,
multi-symptom cough and cold medicines for children under 6.
</P>
<P>
The recommendation, in a 356-page safety review, is the clearest
signal yet that the agency may take strong action against the
roughly 800 popular medicines marketed in the United States under
names like Toddler's Dimetapp, Triaminic Infant and Little Colds.
</P>
<P>
The next step in the process will be a meeting of outside experts
on Oct. 18-19 to examine the medicines' safety and offer
recommendations to the agency.
</P>
<P>
In the new safety review, the FDA's experts suggested that all
"infant" cough and cold formulations be removed from the market,
and that the droppers, cups and syringes included with products
for children be standardized to reduce the risks of confusion and
overdose.
</P>
<P>
The reviewers wrote that there is little evidence that these
medicines are effective in young children, and there are
increasing fears that they may be dangerous. From 1969 to 2006,
at least 54 children died after taking decongestants, and 69 died
after taking antihistamines, the report said. And it added that
since adverse drug reactions are reported voluntarily and
fitfully, the numbers were likely to significantly understate the
medicines' true toll.
</P>
<P>
The Consumer Healthcare Products Association, an industry trade
group that has consistently defended the safety of pediatric
cough and cold medicines, recommended in its own 156-page safety
review, also released Friday, that the FDA consider mandatory
warning labels saying that they should not be used in children
younger than two. Many cough and cold medicines now advise
parents to "consult a physician" before use in such children.
</P>
<P>
The proposed warnings "are recommendations that we have brought
forth and we look forward to having a thorough discussion with
the FDA," said Virginia Cox, a spokeswoman for the trade group.
</P>
<P>
Despite the industry's recommendation, many companies --
including such giants as Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson -- continue to
sell cough and cold medicines with "infant" in their titles and
pictures of babies on their labels.
</P>
<P>
Mark Boston, a spokesman for a Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson
subsidiary that sells pediatric cough and cold medicines, said
the company "supports the materials" that the trade association
submitted to the FDA, but declined to say why the company
continues to sell such products as "Concentrated Tylenol Infants'
Drops Plus Cold."
</P>
<P>
Dr. Joshua Sharfstein, Baltimore's commissioner of health and an
author of a petition that led the FDA to conduct its current
review, cheered its new report, saying it raised serious
questions about why anyone would give cough and cold medicines to
young children. "These products are used by hundreds of thousands
of kids every year, but no one can say that they're safe or
effective," he said.
</P>
<P>
The petition followed a study by the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention that found that more than 1,500 children under the
age of two had suffered serious health problems between 2004 and
2005 after being treated with common cough and cold medicines.
</P>
<P>
Current figures on the medicines' sales and use are not
available, but in 1994 researchers reported in The Journal of the
American Medical Association that more than a third of all three-
year-olds in the United States were given over-the-counter cough
and cold preparations in one 30-day span.
</P>
<P>
The petition noted that in 1990, Americans spent nearly $2
billion on these medications, and it said that in a typical
drugstore, over 30 separate cough and cold preparations are
marketed to parents for use in children.
</P>
<P>
Also on Friday, the FDA warned the makers of nearly 200
unapproved prescription medicines containing the pain-and-cough-
relief drug hydrocodone that by Oct. 31 they must stop making
these products for children under six.
</P>
<P>
Makers of all other unapproved hydrocodone products have until
Dec. 31 to stop making them.
</P>
<P>
Hydrocodone is a narcotic that is widely used to treat pain and
suppress cough. There are seven FDA-approved prescription cough
products containing hydrocodone, and doctors can continue to
write prescriptions for those.
</P>
<P>
The agency's safety review and its decision to ban unapproved
hydrocodone products both result from gradual but significant
changes in the standards used for drug approvals.
</P>
<P>
In the case of pediatric over-the-counter medicines, the agency
decided decades ago that drug makers could market the medicines
for children even though they had only been tested in adults.
Back then, it was assumed that children's bodies were simply
smaller versions of adult ones.
</P>
<P>
That assumption has proven untrue. Indeed, a growing number of
studies suggest that cough and cold medicines work no better in
children than placebos.
</P>
<P>
Despite this, there are 800 such products on the market and sales
have long been strong. Most major pharmacies carry a dozen or
more brands. The medicines are popular largely because children
have an average of six to 10 colds each year, far more than
adults.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, hydrocodone has never been shown to be safe and
effective in children, and its dangers as a powerful and
potentially addictive narcotic are clear. Even more broadly, 200
hydrocodone-containing products never won approval from the
modern-day FDA.
</P>
<P>
There are thousands of such unapproved drugs on the market.
Indeed, an estimated 2 percent of all prescriptions are written
for unapproved products. Most have been around for decades, and
the FDA is gradually forcing their makers to either get official
approval or stop selling them.
