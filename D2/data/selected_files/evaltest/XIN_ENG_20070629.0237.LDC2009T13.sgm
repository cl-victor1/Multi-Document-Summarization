BEIJING, June 29 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
China's hillside farm areas lose 1.5 billion tons of soil
annually, about a third of the nation's total soil loss each
year, said Vice Water Resources Minister E Jingping on Friday.
</P>
<P>
E said hillside farmland had become a primary source of erosion,
with about 40 to 60 kilograms of soil lost in producing a
kilogram of grain on slopes on the northern Loess Plateau.
</P>
<P>
China has about 21.3 million hectares of hillside farmland, about
18 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
Farmers also found it difficult to grow crops on slopes that were
easily eroded.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said it would help farmers working on hillsides at
an incline above 25 degrees to build terraces, so the soil could
be better contained, said E.
</P>
<P>
About 3.3 million hectares of hillside farmland were scattered
along the upper Yangtze River, the Loess Plateau on the upper and
middle reaches of the Yellow River, and in northeast provinces.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has banned farming and forestry projects on all
hillsides at an incline above 25 degrees.
