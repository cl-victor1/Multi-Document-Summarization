US heaps praise on Greece for response to embassy attack - BPT
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The United States heaped praise on Greek authorities for their
response Friday to a rocket attack on the US embassy in Athens, a
city it once considered a relatively soft target for violent
extremists.
</P>
<P>
The early morning attack with a rocket-propelled grenade caused
no casualties and only minor damage to the embassy and was
claimed by a far-left group called Revolutionary Struggle.
</P>
<P>
While condemning the attack, US State Department spokesmen hailed
the response from Green government and law enforcement officials.
</P>
<P>
"We've been getting great cooperation from Greek authorities,"
Department spokesman Sean McCormack said.
</P>
<P>
We "appreciate very much the extraordinarily positive and
supportive response that we got from the Greek government in
addition to the Greek law enforcement activity associated with
this," added his deputy, Tom Casey said.
</P>
<P>
They said Greek Foreign Minister Dora Bakoyannis visited
Ambassador Charles Ries at the embassy within hours of the
attack, as did the government's minister for public order.
</P>
<P>
US officials said they were unaware of any international links to
the attack.
</P>
<P>
"We think it's an isolated incident," said White House spokesman
Tony Snow.
</P>
<P>
But Casey said the attack was still viewed as serious and that
forensic experts from the US Federal Bureau of Investigation were
going to Athens to help with the probe.
</P>
<P>
"I don't know any other word to call it other than terrorism, but
the main point is this violent attack against our diplomatic
facility is something obviouly that we want to see fully
investigated and we want to see the perpetrators brought to
jsutice," he said.
</P>
<P>
US institutions, banks and companies in Greece were frequently
targeted by militant groups in past decades, including the murder
of a CIA station chief in Athens in 1975 by the far-left November
17 group.
</P>
<P>
While security has been seen to improve significantly since
November 17 was broken up in 2002, US officials were outspoken
about their concerns over security preparations for the 2004
Athens Olympics and pressed for a big international role in
protecting the games from possible terrorist attack.
</P>
<P>
Friday's incident was viewed as one of the most serious since
November 17 was dismantled and raised fears of a resurgence of
extremist violence in Greece.
