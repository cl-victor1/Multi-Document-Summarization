Gov. Ed Rendell said Wednesday he will ask Amish elders if they want
state police protection from a Kansas church group that plans to
demonstrate at funerals of five girls fatally shot in an attack on
their one-room schoolhouse.
</P>
<P>
Rendell also asked the members of the Westboro Baptist Church in
Topeka, Kansas, as well as members of the public and news media, to
allow the Amish to conduct their funerals in privacy.
</P>
<P>
"I won't do anything that the Amish community doesn't want us to do,"
Rendell said. "If they want us to do something, we will make sure that
(church members) can demonstrate, but they demonstrate far enough away
that they don't interfere with the privacy of the funerals."
</P>
<P>
The Westboro Baptist Church routinely pickets military funerals,
saying that American servicemen and women are dying overseas because
God is displeased that the United States tolerates homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
In a statement on its Web site, the church blamed Rendell for the
deaths of the Amish children because of comments he made about the
Westboro group on national television several months ago.
</P>
<P>
"They're insane," Rendell responded when asked about the group's
statement.
</P>
<P>
In June, Rendell signed legislation into Pennsylvania law designed to
restrict Westboro Baptist Church's picketing by making it a crime to
demonstrate near a funeral or memorial service in Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
On Monday morning, Charles Carl Roberts IV entered the West Nickel
Mines Amish School in Lancaster County and shot 10 girls, killing
five. Roberts killed himself as police stormed the building.
