MAN ACCUSED OF MURDERING 11 IN DERAILMENT SAYS HE WANTED TO KILL,
BUT NOT TRAIN RIDERS
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES - The man who caused the 2005 Metrolink train
derailment that left 11 dead was "violent" and "dangerous" and
considered killing people in the days leading up to the crash, he
said Wednesday during cross-examination in his murder trial.
</P>
<P>
Deputy District Attorney John Monaghan pounded Juan Manuel
Alvarez for details about threats he admitted making to kill or
injure his then-estranged wife, his cousin and others before he
parked his SUV on railroad tracks in Glendale, causing the Jan.
26, 2005, collision.
</P>
<P>
"So you were mad," Monaghan said. "So you said you were going to
kill somebody, is that what you're telling this jury?"
</P>
<P>
Alvarez shot back that it appeared that Monaghan was trying to
say he intended to kill people on the train, which he denies.
</P>
<P>
Alvarez, 29, faces 11 counts of murder, one count each of train
wrecking and arson, as well as special-circumstance allegations
of multiple murder and train wrecking. If convicted, he could
face the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution's cross-examination is scheduled to continue this
morning.
</P>
<P>
During his second day of testimony in Los Angeles Superior Court,
Alvarez said he was in good spirits when he woke up that January
morning, even taking time to water his landlord's roses before
driving off for a meeting about a job.
</P>
<P>
Alvarez was an admitted methamphetamine user at the time of the
crash, although he testified that it had been three or four days
since he had used the drug, even though he initially told a
doctor it had been longer because he was ashamed and afraid it
would make him look bad.
</P>
<P>
That morning, Alvarez, a man who defense witnesses have testified
hallucinated that his wife's phantom lover slept in their bed and
could fly, thought his wife and her lover were in the back seat
of his vehicle, mocking him.
</P>
<P>
Under earlier questioning Tuesday from defense attorney Thomas
Kielty, Alvarez said that's when he decided to douse himself with
gasoline and kill himself.
</P>
<P>
He said he ditched that plan because he thought it would be "too
painful," and decided to kill himself by parking his SUV on the
train tracks instead. But he changed his mind again, he testified
Tuesday, and wanted to live for his children, but couldn't get
the stuck SUV off the tracks.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday, he admitted to Monaghan that he has repeatedly lied to
people, and the prosecutor noted that in recent months, Alvarez
told a doctor he thought that January morning about killing his
wife at work "and everybody else."
</P>
<P>
"I probably meant everybody else that was spying on me, the
people that were following me," he said.
</P>
<P>
The day began with Kielty continuing his direct examination, in
which Alvarez admitted that while in custody, he has illegally
stored razor blades, sold prescription medicine and made a batch
of "pruno" -- a homemade alcoholic brew.
</P>
<P>
Alvarez also admitted passing a friend heroin that had been
smuggled in by a new inmate, as well as using extortion and
threats against another inmate, a man he said was in custody for
child molestation.
</P>
<P>
In his questioning, Kielty pointed out that Alvarez had been
recorded in jail saying he was drug-free and didn't intend on
using drugs, in part, because they caused him to hallucinate and
"get crazy."
</P>
<P>
"I think I'm better now and I'm afraid to take anything," Alvarez
said.
</P>
<P>
But just Wednesday morning, Alvarez took anti-depression
medication, he admitted under cross-examination. And Monaghan
highlighted Alvarez's jailhouse problems as proof that he hasn't
changed, quoting from a recorded phone conversation in which
Alvarez told someone he extorted two $10.75 phone cards and a bag
of coffee from another inmate under threats of harm.
</P>
<P>
"Didn't you tell this inmate if he didn't pay you, he would get
'f----- up,'?" Monaghan asked. "Are you still dangerous?"
</P>
<P>
Alvarez's response: "I don't consider myself dangerous."
