The student who gunned down eight people in a Finnish school
subscribed to an Internet page thought to belong to a youth
arrested in the United States for allegedly planning a school
massacre.
</P>
<P>
Pekka-Eric Auvinen, 18, who killed eight people Wednesday before
killing himself at the Jokela High School in southern Finland,
had subscribed to a user page on video-sharing website YouTube
belonging to someone identifying themselves as "shadow19462",
records visible on the website showed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Against a white background covered in Kalachnikov assault rifles,
the page purports to belong to Dillon Cossey.
</P>
<P>
Cossey was arrested last month after police in Pennsylvania state
found weapons at his home that school officials feared had been
intended for a Columbine-style school shooting.
</P>
<P>
The page features numerous videos hailing school shootings in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
Auvinen's YouTube account under the pseudonym "naturalselector89"
was suspended last month but "shadow19462" remained online
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Auvinen posted videos on the site under another pseudonym paying
tribute to, among others, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, who
killed 12 schoolmates at Columbine High School in the United
States in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Before Wednesday's massacre, in which five teenage boys and three
women were killed, Auvinen also posted a notice detailing his
plans as well as a video entitled "Jokela High School Massacre --
11/7/2007".
</P>
<P>
"I don't want this to be called only as 'school shooting'," he
said of the shooting, which appears to have been planned to
coincide with the anniversary of Russia's Bolshevik revolution.
</P>
<P>
The video, which AFP watched before YouTube withdrew it and
suspended the account following the shooting, shows the Jokela
school, then pans to a young man aiming his weapon at the camera.
</P>
<P>
The scenes are set to loud hard-rock music.
