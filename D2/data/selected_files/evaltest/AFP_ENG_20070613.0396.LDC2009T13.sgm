Sharp limits imposed on global trade in coral
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The UN wildlife trade organisation imposed strict limits
Wednesday on the global trade of pink and red coral, severely
depleted by commercial exploitation.
</P>
<P>
With a finished necklace retailing for up to 20,000 dollars
(15,000 euros), red corals are among the world's most expensive
wildlife commodities.
</P>
<P>
But destructive fishing methods and over-harvesting have reduced
worldwide catches by 90 percent in the past two decades,
scientists say.
</P>
<P>
"This is the best possible decision to start getting the trade in
these corals under some form of international control," said
Ernie Cooper, a coral trade expert from TRAFFIC, the wildlife
trade monitoring network.
</P>
<P>
"Until now most species of Corallium have been over-harvested as
a result of a free-for-all situation."
</P>
<P>
All 26 species in the Corallium genus will now be protected by
the 171-nation Conference on International Trade in Endangered
Species (CITES), which regulates the world trade in wildlife.
</P>
<P>
But the ones most often exploited to make jewelry and art objects
are red and pink coral, found throughout the world's tropical and
temperate seas but harvested mainly in the Mediterranean and
Western Pacific.
</P>
<P>
Stocks off the coasts of Spain, Italy and France have already
been commercially depleted, experts say.
</P>
<P>
Several major retailers have supported the new restrictions.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that coral harvesting as currently practiced is not
sustainable and threatens marine ecosystems," said Fernanda
Kellogg, senior vice president of Tiffany and Co.
</P>
<P>
"We will not use this precious material in our jewelry until
harvesting methods have been adopted that ensure the
sustainability of coral reefs," she told Sea Web, an ocean
conservation group that works with the international jeweler.
