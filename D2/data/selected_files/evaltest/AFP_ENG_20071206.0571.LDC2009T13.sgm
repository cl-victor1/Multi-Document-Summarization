Teen kills eight in US mall rampage
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A teenager armed with a semi-automatic rifle opened fire on
Christmas shoppers at an Omaha shopping mall, killing at least
eight people before turning the gun on himself.
</P>
<P>
At least five other people were injured and taken to area
hospitals after Wednesday's shooting inside the Westroads Mall,
Omaha Police Chief Thomas Warren told reporters. Two are
reportedly in critical condition.
</P>
<P>
The shooting "appears to be very random and without provocation,"
Warren said late Wednesday, adding that police were still
interviewing witnesses.
</P>
<P>
He identified the shooter as Robert Hawkins, 19, and said he was
armed with an SKS assault rifle.
</P>
<P>
"We believe there was one shooter and one shooter only," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We do have a (suicide) note. I can't describe the contents of
this note, but it does appear this incident was premeditated."
</P>
<P>
Hawkins' landlady, Debora Maruca Kovac, told CNN that in the note
the shooter said "that he was sorry for everything, that he
didn't want to be a burden to anybody, he loved his family, he
loved all of his friends. He was a piece of shit all of his life
and now he'll be famous."
</P>
<P>
Kovac said that Hawkins had lived in her house for a year and a
half, and had recently broken up with his girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
"He was withdrawn," she said. "He was like a lost pound puppy
that nobody wanted. ... He had a lot of emotional problems."
</P>
<P>
The Omaha World Herald reported that Hawkins had also been fired
from his job at a McDonald's, and was arrested Friday for being a
minor in possession of alcohol -- the legal drinking age in the
United States is 21.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said he had been sent to jail for seven days in
2005 on charges of disorderly conduct.
</P>
<P>
The Sarpy County Sheriff's Department, located just south of
Omaha in Papillion, told KETV that Hawkins' mother walked into
its office shortly after the shooting with a note that "could be
interpreted as suicidal."
</P>
<P>
The sheriff's office and Omaha police could not be immediately
reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
Employees and shoppers fled the mall or locked themselves inside
stores after hearing dozens of shots from the upscale Von Maur
department store, where police said the shooting took place.
</P>
<P>
"People were freaking," an employee at Whitehall jewelers, who
refused to give her name, told AFP by telephone.
</P>
<P>
Shoppers and workers described a terrifying scene.
</P>
<P>
"We heard about 35, 40 shots, and on our way we did see someone
down by the escalator, bleeding," witness Jennifer Cramer told
KETV.
</P>
<P>
"I was standing around getting ready to go back to work and all
of a sudden I heard this bang, bang, bang -- it sounded like
someone shooting fireworks," another witness told KETV. "I ran to
get away from whatever was happening."
</P>
<P>
The Nebraska incident was the latest in a series of shootings in
the United States, where private gun ownership is legal and
widespread.
</P>
<P>
Late last month two people were found dead in an apparent murder-
suicide at a Texas mall.
</P>
<P>
The woman was working at a store when she got a phone call from
her angry boyfriend who threatened to harm her, local television
station KHOU said.
</P>
<P>
The woman called mall security for help, but the boyfriend
arrived before they did and took her hostage, pulling down the
store's front gate and barricading them inside.
</P>
<P>
There have also been a series of school shootings this year, the
worst being the Virginia Tech massacre in April in which 32
people were killed when a student went on a campus rampage.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's shooting took place as President George W. Bush
headed back to Washington after delivering a Republican fund-
raising speech in Omaha.
</P>
<P>
Bush expressed sadness after learning about the shooting.
</P>
<P>
"His thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families
this evening," the White House said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"Having just visited with so many members of the community in
Omaha today, the president is confident that they will pull
together to comfort one another as they deal with this terrible
tragedy," it said.
