SEOUL, Dec. 7 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
About 10.5 million liters of crude oil leaked to waters off the
western coast of South Korea on Friday after an oil tanker and a
barge collided early on the day and became the largest offshore
oil spill in South Korea.
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred at 07:15 a.m. local time (2215 GMT
Thursday) in waters 6 miles northwest off the seashore of Taean
Peninsula, South Chungcheon Province when the 146,000-ton tanker
Hebei Sprit collided with a South Korean barge ship, the maritime
police said.
</P>
<P>
However, no casualties were reported during the accident.
</P>
<P>
According to the coast guard, the Hebei Spirit was registered in
Hong Kong, while the barge ship belongs to a South Korean
company. The tanker was at anchor when the South Korean barge
ship hit into the larboard of the oil tanker and punctured three
holes in the tanker.
</P>
<P>
The maritime police estimates that about 10.5 million liters of
crude oil leak from the holes and spread to an area of 2 km wide
and 7.4 km long.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean government sent 57 vessels and 4 helicopters to
the spot soon after the accident to prevent further spreading of
the floating oil.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean Defense Ministry said Friday it has dispatched
500 soldiers in four Navy boats to assist with the containment
efforts.
</P>
<P>
Friday's accident is the largest offshore oil spill in South
Korea.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, a 144,567-ton tanker, the Sea Prince, struck a reef and
released 5,035 tons of oil in waters off the south coast of the
country.
