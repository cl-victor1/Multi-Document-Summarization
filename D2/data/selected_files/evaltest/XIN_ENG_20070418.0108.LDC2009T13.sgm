FUZHOU, April 18 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
In the fourth mass food poisoning incident to hit China in a
week, thirty-four students were hospitalized with suspected food
poisoning after eating lunch at a factory cafeteria in Fujian
Province on Tuesday, local food safety authorities said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The food watchdog is analyzing food from the cafeteria of the
Guanda Garment Company in the provincial capital Fuzhou after
receiving reports that more than 30 students from two technical
secondary schools had fallen ill on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The officials suspect that mushrooms in the meal might be the
source of the poisoning.
</P>
<P>
The students, who were doing field work in the firm, developed
cramps, vomiting and diarrhea and were taken to hospital in
Tuesday afternoon and diagnosed with suspected food poisoning.
</P>
<P>
All the students have been discharged after being treated.
</P>
<P>
The exact cause of the food poisoning is still unknown and an
investigation is in progress.
</P>
<P>
The incident follows hot on the heels of three other mass
poisonings in the country this month.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, more than 60 migrant workers in Shanghai were
hospitalized with food poisoning after eating supper at a
construction site cafeteria.
</P>
<P>
Also on Monday, 19 middle-school students were hospitalized with
suspected food poisoning after eating lunch in a school cafeteria
in Changchun, capital of northeast China's Jilin Province.
</P>
<P>
On April 9, more than 200 people fell ill and one person died in
Harbin in northeastern China after they ate a hospital breakfast
suspected of being contaminated with rat poison.
</P>
<P>
With food poisoning cases frequently reported to have caused
deaths and injuries in China, the government is expected to issue
a comprehensive plan to track and trace food products.
</P>
<P>
According to authorities on standardizing market economic order,
the national guidelines for food and drug safety have been
approved by the State Council and will be soon promulgated.
</P>
<P>
China will in the next five years enhance the safety assessment
of food and drug and the monitoring of drugs and medical
equipment, and better handle safety incidents in the field, the
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
Food and drug safety has become a major concern of Chinese
people. According to a survey by the State Food and Drug
Administration, 65 percent of the respondents worried about the
food safety situation in China.
</P>
<P>
Besides food poisoning cases, several drug safety incidents
occurred in China last year, the most notorious one causing the
deaths of at least six patients and severe side-effects in more
than 80 others.
