International tuna bodies demand catch limits
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two international fishing industry groups called for limits to
tuna catches Wednesday to stop the population of the fish from
deteriorating due to overfishing.
</P>
<P>
The Tokyo-based Organisation for the Promotion of Responsible
Tuna Fisheries and the World Tuna Purse Seine Organisation,
headquartered in Seoul, adopted a joint statement demanding a
moratorium on the use of additional large tuna vessels, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
The statement would be sent to five international tuna
conservation bodies, which would hold their first joint meeting
in Kobe, Japan, Monday through Friday next week, the officials
said.
</P>
<P>
The bodies are the Western Central Pacific Ocean Fisheries
Commission, the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission, the
Indian Ocean Tuna Commission, the International Commission for
the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas and the Commission for the
Conservation of the Southern Bluefin Tuna.
</P>
<P>
The statement also expressed concerns about "the stock status of
the world tuna resources being exploited close to, or over the
level capable of producing the maximum sustainable yield".
</P>
<P>
Japan eats a quarter of the world's tuna, more than any other
country, but faces pressure from environmentalists, who have
blamed the global fad for Japanese food for bringing tuna numbers
to the brink of extinction.
</P>
<P>
An international commission in November reduced the world's gross
catch of bluefin tuna in the Mediterranean from 32,000 tons this
year to 29,500 tons for 2007, a move likely to lead to an import
crunch in Japan.
</P>
<P>
Japan has also accepted a major cut in its quota for southern
bluefin tuna in the Pacific Ocean as punishment for overfishing.
