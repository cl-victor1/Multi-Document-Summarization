Key Water Source Is Affected by Global Warming, Report Finds
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Global warming will worsen drought and reduce flows on the
Colorado River, a key water source for several western states,
according to a report released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The study, prepared by a National Research Council committee,
paints a sobering picture as the water needs of a rapidly
expanding population test the limits of a river system strained
by the effects of climate change.
</P>
<P>
``The basin is going to face increasingly costly, controversial
and unavoidable trade-off choices,'' said Ernest Smerdon, who
chaired the panel of academicians and scientists who wrote the
report. ``Increasing demands are impeding the region's ability to
cope with droughts and water shortages.''
</P>
<P>
Such measures as conservation, desalination and water recycling
would be helpful, the authors said, but wouldn't offer a panacea.
</P>
<P>
The report, which examined climate modeling and tree ring data,
reaffirms a more pessimistic assessment of river hydrology that
has emerged in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Scientists have concluded that the Colorado river system, which
supplies water to 25 million people and several million acres of
crop and ranch land, has been drier and more prone to severe
drought than was the case in the early 20th century, when the
river's flows were divvied among the seven basin states.
</P>
<P>
It turns out that period was unusually wet, prompting an overly
generous estimate of how much water would be available to farms
and cities. Ancient tree rings, which provide graphic evidence of
past precipitation patterns, indicate it had been three centuries
since the basin was last awash with that much water.
</P>
<P>
The most recent drought began in 2000 and has left the river's
biggest reservoirs, Lake Mead and Lake Powell, roughly half
empty.
</P>
<P>
``Now that is not a happy picture,'' Smerdon said. ``What we want
people to do is to be aware of these scientific facts and take
them into account as they plan for development, for drought-
contingency plans.''
</P>
<P>
Global warming will only make matters worse, said Connie
Woodhouse, a University of Arizona associate professor of
geography who helped write the report. ``It's going to enhance
the droughts'' that are part of the natural climate cycle.
</P>
<P>
Although the river's flows returned to normal in 2005 after five
years of dramatic lows, they fell again last year. Federal
scientists say that if they remain below average or even average,
Lake Mead might never completely refill.
</P>
<P>
The study, which was sponsored by the National Academies, the
U.S. Bureau of Reclamation and several water agencies, notes that
temperatures have risen in the western United States over the
past century and are expected to keep climbing.
</P>
<P>
``All of the models are predicting very significant warming in
the future,'' said Smerdon, a former engineering college dean at
the University of Arizona in Tucson.
</P>
<P>
The report acknowledges some uncertainty over whether climate
change would alter the amount of precipitation in the basin. But
as the mercury rises, water demands would increase. There would
be more evaporation from croplands and reservoirs, and wild land
vegetation would suck more moisture from the soil, reducing
runoff.
</P>
<P>
``I think a reasonably savvy person would have to say you're
going to see less water in that river,'' said Brad Udall,
director of Western Water Assessment at the University of
Colorado in Boulder, who was not a member of the report
committee. ``The real question is how much less. Is it 5 percent
less or is it 40 percent less and by when?''
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Department of Interior, which oversees the Colorado's
management, is reviewing a drought plan the states put together
last year. Because California holds some of the most senior
rights to the river, Arizona, Nevada and Mexico would experience
cuts in deliveries before California, said Roger Patterson,
assistant general manager of the Metropolitan Water District of
Southern California.
</P>
<P>
The river is a major source for Metropolitan, Southern
California's major urban water supplier. Last year about 30
percent of the agency's water deliveries came from the Colorado,
which provides about 10 percent of California's overall urban and
agricultural supplies.
</P>
<P>
Most of the state's river allotment -- the biggest in the system
-- goes to the Imperial Irrigation District, which distributes
water to the croplands of the Imperial Valley, one of the
nation's biggest lettuce producers.
</P>
<P>
Noting that farms remain the dominant water user in the Colorado
basin, the report called agricultural water ``the most important
and perhaps final large reservoir of available water for urban
use in the arid U.S. West.''
</P>
<P>
But that supply is also finite, the authors emphasized, and
shifting water from farm to city could have negative impacts.
Transfers could hurt rural economies, lower food production and
rob wildlife of leaking irrigation water that nourishes important
habitat.
