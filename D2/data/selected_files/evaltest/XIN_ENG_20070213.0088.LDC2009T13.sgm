JAKARTA, Feb. 13 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
A leading Indonesian environmental group has filed a suit against
President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono and an energy firm on mud flow
that has damaged environment and displaced more than 10,000
people in Java Island, the group's chairman said here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Chairman Chalid Muhammad said the Wahana Lingkungan Hidup (
Walhi) filed a law suit on the South Jakarta court on Monday,
naming the operator of the drilling Lapindo Brantas Corp., its
partners, Indonesian President Susilo and other officials as
defendants.
</P>
<P>
The accident of oil drilling in May last year caused hot mud
pouring into surrounding area and inundated entire villages in
Siduarjo in East Java, the second biggest city in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Experts have failed to curb or channel the mud to the sea. The
Indonesian government has been criticized for not doing enough to
handle the problem.
</P>
<P>
Muhammad said hundreds of hectares of agricultural land have been
damaged, scores of factories have been closed and over 9,000
workers lost their jobs,
</P>
<P>
In addition, the ecosystem also destroyed as the government
decided to channel the hot mud to the sea.
</P>
<P>
"The hot mud flow has damaged ecosystem and hundreds of hectares
of agricultural land. It inundated villages and internally
displaced residents," he told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
"The settlement of the hot mud has never touched the
environmental aspects and pointed who are responsible to prevent
the pouring of the mud," said Muhammad.
</P>
<P>
In its suit, the group demanded the president order Lapindo
Brantas Inc., and its partners to allocate fund and resources to
compensate victims and restore the environment.
</P>
<P>
Lapindo and Energi Mega Persada companies, which indirectly
control the operation, have been in dispute on whether the mud
flow was caused by the drilling and whether Lapindo alone should
shoulder the cost.
</P>
<P>
Persada belongs to the Bakrie Group, controlled by the family of
Indonesia's Coordinating Minister for People Welfare and Poverty
Alleviation, Aburizal Bakrie.
</P>
<P>
In December last year, President Susilo said Lapindo would pay
420 millions U.S. dollars to victims and make efforts to stop the
flow of the mud.
</P>
<P>
But Lapindo only agreed to pay 276 millions U.S. dollars per
square meter for inundated land and damaged buildings, and about
12 U.S. dollars for a square meter of rice fields.
