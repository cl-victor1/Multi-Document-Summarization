Former American football star OJ Simpson was questioned by police
in Las Vegas over an alleged armed robbery at a casino hotel
room, police said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Simpson was quizzed late Thursday following reports of a robbery
from a guest's room at the Palace Station casino, Las Vegas
Police Department Captain James Dillon told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"Police responded to a call from a person alleging he had been
the victim of an armed robbery," Dillon said. "The victim stated
that one of the suspects was OJ Simpson."
</P>
<P>
Simpson was later released without charge but was continuing to
help police with their investigation, Dillon said, adding that
items allegedly taken were "sports-related products."
</P>
<P>
The alleged victim was identified by celebrity news website
TMZ.com as Alfred Beardsley, a collector of sports memorabilia.
</P>
<P>
Beardsley told the website that Simpson and a group of men
entered his room pretending to be customers. Two men with Simpson
pulled guns during the robbery, Beardsley said.
</P>
<P>
Simpson, one of the most famous American football players of his
generation during the 1970s, was the prime suspect in the brutal
1994 murders of estranged wife Nicole Brown-Simpson and her
friend Ron Goldman.
</P>
<P>
Simpson, who always has vehemently denied the killings, was
acquitted of the slayings after a racially charged Los Angeles
trial in 1995, a verdict that was greeted with widespread outrage
across America.
</P>
<P>
The former sports star was subsequently found liable for the
deaths in a 1997 civil suit and was ordered to pay damages to the
victims' families totaling 33.5 million dollars.
