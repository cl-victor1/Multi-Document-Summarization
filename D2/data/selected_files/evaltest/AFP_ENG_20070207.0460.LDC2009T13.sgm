Massive hacker attack slows but fails to bring down Internet by

The worst attack in years on the Internet's infrastructure, which
slowed traffic but failed to bring down the Web, used infected
computers around the world as "zombies," security experts said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The US Department of Homeland Security meanwhile confirmed that
its cybersecurity arm had been monitoring "anomalous" activity on
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
"The nature of the traffic has not been confirmed, and the
servers which are overseas remain operational," DHS spokesman
Russ Knocke said.
</P>
<P>
"There are no indications of any direct nexus to the United
States at this time. Also, there is no credible intelligence to
suggest an imminent threat to the homeland or our computing
systems at this time."
</P>
<P>
Graham Cluley, senior technology consultant at the London-based
firm Sophos, said Tuesday's incident "seems to have been the most
serious attack against these domain name servers" since late
2002.
</P>
<P>
Cluley said three of the 13 domain name system (DNS) servers that
control global Internet traffic were hit with a so-called "denial
of service" attack, which means they were bombarded with
information requests in an effort to bring them down.
</P>
<P>
Cluley noted that the attack was coming from PCs taken over by
hackers to create zombie networks or "botnets" to bombard the
servers with traffic.
</P>
<P>
"These zombie computers could have brought the Web to its knees,
and while the resilience of the root servers should be commended,
more needs to be done to tackle the root of the problem -- the
lax attitude of some users towards IT security," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that since the 2002 attacks, "the system has become more
resilient and is well set up to bounce back from these attacks."
</P>
<P>
The US-based SANS Internet Storm Center said experts at the
computer security institute were "aware of the attacks," and
trying to get more information about them.
</P>
<P>
"We're still hunting for some technical details," said center
director Marcus Sachs.
</P>
<P>
Cluley said some reports traced the attacks to South Korea, but
added that "it doesn't mean the hackers are based there ... the
bad guys could be based anywhere in the world."
</P>
<P>
"It could be that your grandmother's computer in the bedroom,
unbeknownst to her, may have been trying to bring down the
Internet."
</P>
<P>
He said the motive of the attack was unclear. One tactic used by
hackers in the past was blackmail, or to threaten to shut down a
website with a denial of service attack if money is not paid.
</P>
<P>
"Another possibility is just plain mischief, and my feeling is
that this may have been just a bit of a lark," Cluley said.
"Fortunately this was repelled."
</P>
<P>
The attack was on three of the 13 Internet root servers, which
manage the domains from various locations around the world and
convert website names such as Amazon.com to their numeric IP
(Internet Protocol) address.
</P>
<P>
"If the DNS servers were to fall over then pandemonium would
ensue, emphasizing the importance of properly defending all PCs
from being taken over by hackers," said Cluley.
</P>
<P>
"A denial-of-service attack like this swamps Web-connected
servers with traffic from many computers around the globe. It's a
bit like 20 hippos trying to get through a revolving door at the
same time -- there's no route through and everything clogs up."
</P>
<P>
In October 2002, another major attack targeted the 13 root
servers and slowed traffic. But experts said at the time that the
Internet would still operate with at least one of the servers
functioning.
