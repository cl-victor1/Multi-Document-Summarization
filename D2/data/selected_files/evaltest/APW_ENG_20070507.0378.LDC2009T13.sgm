Security Council travel bans

THE HAGUE, Netherlands 2007-05-07 10:09:30 UTC

<P>
Potential defense witnesses for Charles Taylor are refusing to
testify at the former Liberian president's war crimes trial for
fear of being slapped with U.N. travel bans, Taylor's lawyer told
a court Monday.
</P>
<P>
Taylor, 59, is to go on trial June 4 on 11 charges, including
terrorism, murder, rape, sexual slavery, mutilation and
recruiting child soldiers linked to his alleged support for
rebels in Sierra Leone's brutal civil war.
</P>
<P>
He has pleaded innocent and faces a maximum sentence of life
imprisonment if convicted by the Special Court for Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
At a pretrial hearing in The Hague, Taylor's lawyer Karim Khan
said his efforts to build a defense were being hampered by the
perceived threat of U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
"Numerous individuals ... are unwilling to speak to the defense
(because) they are petrified of having travel bans imposed upon
them and having their assets frozen by the Security Council
because they are associated to the defense of Mr. Charles
Taylor," Khan said.
</P>
<P>
Khan said he would file a motion asking judges at the court to
grant witnesses protection from sanctions.
</P>
<P>
He said that the possibility of sanctions, "would amount to
witness intimidation, whether it comes from a group or a party or
even as august a body ... as the Security Council of the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
The Sierra Leone court usually sits in the capital, Freetown, but
Taylor's trial is to be held in a courtroom rented from the
International Criminal Court in The Hague because of fears the
case could trigger new violence.
</P>
<P>
Taylor sat in court listening to proceedings wearing a dark suit
and brown tie. Judges also allowed him to wear sunglasses in the
windowless courtroom because of an eye infection.
</P>
<P>
At Monday's hearing, slated to be the last before the trial
starts next month, Khan also complained that the court was not
funding an adequate defense team for Taylor.
</P>
<P>
Taylor has two attorneys and three legal assistants, while
prosecutors have a trial team of some 10 attorneys and lawyers.
</P>
<P>
Khan said that former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic had a
much larger defense team when he went on trial for genocide at
the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal.
</P>
<P>
"The concern of my client is that he is being shortchanged," Khan
said.
</P>
<P>
Taylor's lawyers are seeking to appeal the decision setting the
start date for the trial, arguing that they have not had enough
time to prepare.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors say that in exchange for diamonds smuggled out of
Sierra Leone, Taylor provided rebels with arms, ammunition,
communication equipment, as well as alcohol, drugs and
cigarettes.
