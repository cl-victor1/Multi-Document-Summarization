IN VEGAS, WASTING WATER IS A SIN

LAS VEGAS - Outside the Bellagio casino, tourists stare at
fountains thrusting water into the sky as Elvis sings "Viva Las
Vegas." Meanwhile, off the Strip, residents dig up their lawns to
save water - and get paid for it.
</P>
<P>
That's the paradox in this desert town where water lured people
thousands of years before casino-constructed wonders such as the
canals of the Venetian, the shark reef of Mandalay Bay and the
fountains of the Bellagio.
</P>
<P>
By the 1800s, a life-sustaining spring on the Old Spanish Trail
had inspired travelers to label this spot Las Vegas, "the
meadows." Then in 1935, the Hoover Dam opened on the Colorado
River, creating what is now Lake Mead. The region seemed
guaranteed a reliable flow of water as far into the future as
anyone could see.
</P>
<P>
But the original spring dried up 45 years ago, and now Lake Mead
is in serious trouble. A seven-year drought has the 157,000-acre
reservoir looking as if someone pulled the plug, leaving a
waterline 100 feet high that locals labeled "the bathtub ring."
</P>
<P>
Reminds you of Georgia's Lake Lanier.
</P>
<P>
When it comes to water, the Big Peach has a thing or two in
common with Sin City.
</P>
<P>
Both are among the country's fastest-growing cities. Nevada
shares the Colorado River with six other states; Georgia competes
with Alabama and Florida for the Chattahoochee. And in Las Vegas,
as in Atlanta, the rain has stopped falling.
</P>
<P>
Las Vegas, a few years ahead of Atlanta on the drought curve,
responded with an all-out assault on wasteful attitudes and an
exhaustive search for new water sources.
</P>
<P>
The city offered inducements to cut consumption, negotiated
agreements with other regions and proposed a controversial
pipeline that resulted in a tug of war with a neighboring state.
</P>
<P>
Water cops on the beat
</P>
<P>
Las Vegas takes conservation seriously enough to give its water
agency its own police force.
</P>
<P>
On a "good day," Francis Reyes writes 40 citations. But most
days, he and the 10 other Las Vegas water cops average about 14
apiece.
</P>
<P>
On this fall morning, Reyes is patrolling in his Water Waste
Investigator's SUV, looking for violators. On the overnight
shift, he'd have his windows down to hear any water he couldn't
see.
</P>
<P>
He rolls past lawns with bright green grass and yards with rocks
and desert landscaping, some of the latter no doubt the result of
a financial incentive offered by the Southern Nevada Water
Authority. Owners of new homes have no choice; no grass is
allowed in front yards of new developments. Backyards can be half
turf, a concession to children and dogs.
</P>
<P>
Driving through a neighborhood of 1950s-era homes on quarter-acre
lots, Reyes, 24, passes someone washing a silver van - washing
vehicles once a week is permitted - and stops to warn a man
draining a pool that he must feed the water into the sewer system
for recycling.
</P>
<P>
On the edge of an emerald green lawn, Reyes sees a defective
sprinkler shooting water into the air like a geyser. Although
outdoor watering is still permitted on a strict schedule,
spilling water into the street is not. Reyes records the offense
with a video camera, then logs onto his computer to check the
address for previous citations. None.
</P>
<P>
He checks "Broken sprinkler/emitter" on a form. If it's not
repaired next time he checks, a fine will be added to the water
bill for this address. Should the homeowner appeal, Reyes has his
video evidence.
</P>
<P>
Just as he gets out of the van to plant a small yellow flag at
the precise scene of the crime, the automatic sprinkler system
shuts off. Reyes sticks the pennant into the gleaming wet grass.
</P>
<P>
More residents, less grass
</P>
<P>
Conservation efforts saved Southern Nevada 18 billion gallons of
water annually from 2002 to 2006 - a 20 percent reduction during
a period when nearly 330,000 more residents moved in and 40
million tourists visited. Nevadans have cut five billion gallons
a year just on the turf they've dug up since 2003, when the
Southern Nevada Water Authority started paying people $1 a square
foot to get rid of their grass so they wouldn't have to water it.
The 26 golf clubs alone tore out 472 acres, the equivalent of
five 18-hole courses. The areas where play takes place - the
rough, the fairway and the green - are still grass. Other parts
of the course feature drought-tolerant plants, many of them
desert natives.
</P>
<P>
Doug Bennett, who moved to Vegas from New Mexico about the time
the drought started in 2000, is the water authority's manager of
conservation. He settled into a Las Vegas neighborhood of lush
grass and immediately got rid of his.
</P>
<P>
"If the only time people walk on that lawn they're pushing a
mower, it's not functional," he said.
</P>
<P>
Desert landscaping offers many possibilities beyond cacti, he
said. Some colorful flowering plants and shrubs demand much less
water than grass.
</P>
<P>
Bennett believes regulations about how and when water can be used
are more palatable here because Vegas and all its suburban
satellites operate under the same rules. They're set by the
regional water authority, formed in 1991 to bring together seven
separate water jurisdictions.
</P>
<P>
If each agency sets its own standards, Bennett said, "it's easy
to send out mottled messages."
</P>
<P>
Push for higher prices
</P>
<P>
Despite the strides the authority has made, critics say Las Vegas
should do more to conserve water. One way of discouraging water
use could be to make it more expensive.
</P>
<P>
The Rates Citizen's Advisory Committee, a 14-member panel, was
appointed by the Las Vegas Valley Water District to recommend a
water pricing structure that would strengthen conservation.
</P>
<P>
The committee's charts show that Las Vegas pays a fraction of the
water fees of Tucson, Ariz., San Antonio, Santa Barbara, Calif. -
and even Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
Scot Rutledge, executive director of the Nevada Conservation
League, is all for Vegas increasing water fees.
</P>
<P>
"You sure as hell should pay more for water if you're moving to
an area with limited water resources," said Rutledge, who's not
on the panel. "There are people in this valley who don't care how
much water they use. Those are the people who should have to
pay."
</P>
<P>
Because about three-quarters of water use in the Las Vegas
vicinity is by single-family homes, the committee is focusing on
those users. But all customers would be affected.
</P>
<P>
Some members of the advisory board - which includes
representatives of gaming and development, labor unions and golf
courses - are concerned that prices may escalate too quickly and
businesses might be disproportionately affected.
</P>
<P>
"I think there's going to be rate shock no matter what," said Ron
Winkle, who represents older adults on the committee. He cited
the possibility that a 20 percent increase could bankrupt a golf
course with a million-dollar water bill.
</P>
<P>
"At the same time," said Cynthia Lopez, who represents the
residential sector, "golf is a luxury, especially in the desert."
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we want golf courses to go out of business,"
Winkle replied.
</P>
<P>
"Of course not," agreed Lopez, "but we're talking about water
conservation."
</P>
<P>
When the meeting was over, committee facilitator Lewis Michaelson
said the panel's mission is to curtail demand and encourage
conservation while making sure everyone pays a fair share.
</P>
<P>
Water administrator Richard Wimmer shook his head. "It's a
balancing act that's not achievable," he said. "You know that."
</P>
<P>
New sources needed
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, conservation will fall short, said Pat Mulroy,
general manager of both the Las Vegas Valley Water District and
of the Southern Nevada Water Authority.
</P>
<P>
Southern Nevada must find new ways to bring in water, she said.
</P>
<P>
A complex plan hammered out by the states along the Colorado
River and expected to be signed by the secretary of interior next
month will do that. It allows the Southern Nevada Water Authority
to pipe water from the Muddy, a short river about 60 miles
northeast of Las Vegas; the Virgin, a long tributary of the
Colorado; and the Coyote Spring Basin northeast of the city. As
part of the seven-state agreement, Nevada will help pay for a
reservoir in Southern California.
</P>
<P>
The plan is supposed to ensure that Lake Mead doesn't fall below
a minimum level.
</P>
<P>
Mulroy said the agreement, reached after "four years of chest
beating" and "some very childish behavior" among the states, is
much more equitable.
</P>
<P>
"We had to succeed," she said. "We could spend the next 20 years
in the Supreme Court. In the meantime, we'd all be sucking air."
</P>
<P>
In a separate plan, the Southern Nevada Water Authority proposes
purchasing and pumping billions of gallons of groundwater from
rural east-central Nevada for use by Las Vegas, an idea that's
sparked much controversy.
</P>
<P>
Some environmentalists say parts of the state could become a dust
bowl. Some rural Nevadans resent the expanding city. And some
Utah officials want a federal study to make sure the pipeline
doesn't tap into Utah's aquifer - a request Mulroy says would
interfere with Nevada's sovereign right.
</P>
<P>
"It's going to get uglier before it gets better," Mulroy
predicted.
</P>
<P>
Controlling growth, she said, is not an option -although
environmentalists insist the area's population explosion must be
curtailed.
</P>
<P>
"What are we going to do, build walls?" she asked. "Will we reach
a point where our own kids can't live here?"
</P>
<P>
A history lesson in order
</P>
<P>
The people pouring into Vegas must be educated about the concept
of desert life, said Bronson Mack, a spokesman for the water
authority.
</P>
<P>
One way water officials are trying to do that is through the Las
Vegas Springs Preserve. On the site of the defunct original
spring, the preserve opened in June as a $250 million attraction
of exhibits, gardens and trails that illustrate the heritage and
ecology of the Mojave Desert and Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
"The history of the city is the history of the water in this
valley," said Marcel Parent, the preserve's education director.
</P>
<P>
Current casinos and hotels are also feeding most of the water
they use back into the Las Vegas Wash, which feeds recycled water
back to Lake Mead.
</P>
<P>
The gaming and hospitality industries, which account for only 3
percent of the area's overall water use, are generally pretty
good stewards, authority officials say. And, of course, they
drive the area's economy.
</P>
<P>
Tourists aren't drawn to casinos only for the gambling.
Sometimes, it's all about the show.
</P>
<P>
At the Golden Nugget, an older hotel and casino in downtown Las
Vegas, a Michigan mother waited for a hamburger at a grill.
During three days in town with her grown daughter, she had been
in almost every casino on the Strip. The neon and noise had left
her unimpressed.
</P>
<P>
But she said she would cherish one experience - watching the
Bellagio's fountain shooting water to the heavens as Elvis sang.
</P>
<P>
That, she said, was worth the trip.
