<P>
This year's first sandstorm hit Minqin County of northwest
China's Gansu Province on Friday, the China Meteorological
Administration (CMA) said here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The sandstorm started at 11:28 a.m., with a minimum visibility of
600 meters, and died down an hour later, according to the CMA.

<P>
Minqin County, located between the Badain Jaran desert and the
Tengger desert, has seen 94 percent of its area turn into desert
as a result of years of erosion by wind and sand.
</P>
<P>
Deserts have advanced an average three to four meters into the
remaining land each year. Last year, they advanced 6.19 meters,
statistics from the local meteorological bureau showed.
</P>
<P>
The county suffered only 14 sandstorms last year, compared with
around 26 on average. The most severe storm brought visibility
down to 100 meters in April.
