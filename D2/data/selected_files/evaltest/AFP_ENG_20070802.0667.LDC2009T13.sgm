Bridge collapses over Mississippi River
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A bridge collapsed over the Mississippi river Wednesday leaving
drivers stranded on massive chunks of concrete amid the rushing
water.
</P>
<P>
Several cars were flung into the river and there was no immediate
news on how many people were hurt or killed.
</P>
<P>
Photographs taken from an apartment overlooking the bridge in
Minneapolis, Minnesota shown on CNN showed a disastrous scene of
people crouching on bent and crumpled concrete with parts of the
bridge submerged in the brown river.
</P>
<P>
A school bus was on the bridge but did not fall into the river as
it collapsed, local media reports. Several of the children were
injured.
</P>
<P>
At least eight cars and a truck went into the water, and at least
20 vehicles may have been on the massive bridge when it
collapsed, the Minneapolis Star Tribune reported.
</P>
<P>
Rescue workers scrambled into the river gorge to help people off
the huge chunks of concrete roadway as fire and smoke rose from
the wreckage, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The 40-year-old bridge was undergoing repairs at the time of the
accident, and there were reports that construction workers were
using a jackhammer at the time of the collapse, AFP has learned.
</P>
<P>
Ramon Houge was driving on the bridge when heard a rumbling
noise, saw the ground collapse in front of him and watched cars
go down into the water.
</P>
<P>
Traffic was bumper-to-bumper at the time, and he estimated
hundreds of people must have been involved.
</P>
<P>
"It didnâ€™t seem like it was real," he told the Star-Tribune.
</P>
<P>
Those still on solid ground backed up as best they could and he
saw kids on a bus with blood on their faces.
</P>
<P>
Sarah Fahnhorst, who lives in an apartment a block away from the
bridge, heard a huge thud and then "the entire building shook. It
shook the ground," she told the paper.
