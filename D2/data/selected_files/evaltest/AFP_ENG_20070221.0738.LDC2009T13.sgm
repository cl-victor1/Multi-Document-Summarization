China plans to cut water consumption

<P>
China plans to cut its average water consumption by 20 percent by
the end of 2010 in an effort to avert a looming shortage crisis,
state media reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The government will set up consumption quotas and make local
officials responsible for managing the use of water, the Xinhua
news agency reported, citing the ministry of water resources.
</P>
<P>
The government also aims to establish 100 pilot water-saving
schemes in the run- up to 2010, and to roll out successful
projects across the nation, according to the agency.
</P>
<P>
"There is huge potential for water saving in China," said Wang
Shucheng, minister of water resources.
</P>
<P>
China only recycles 60 to 65 percent of its industrial water,
compared with 80 to 85 percent in developed countries, the agency
said.
</P>
<P>
Double-digit economic growth and a growing population are putting
a heavy strain on China's limited water resources, and the
consequences are beginning to show.
</P>
<P>
There was enough water in Beijing to adequately supply just over
14 million people in 2005, but the city had 15 million permanent
residents and four million migrant workers at the end of last
year, Xinhua said recently.
