STATES AGREE TO NEW WATER-SHARING PACT

<P>
Facing the worst drought in a century and the prospect that
climate change could yield long-term changes on the Colorado
River, the lifeline for several Western states, federal officials
have reached a new pact with the states on how to allocate water
if the river runs short.
</P>
<P>
State and federal officials praised the agreement, which Interior
Secretary Dirk Kempthorne was expected to sign Thursday, as a
landmark akin to the Colorado River Compact of 1922 that first
divvied up how much water the seven states served by the river --
California, Nevada, Arizona, Colorado, Utah, New Mexico, and
Wyoming -- receive annually.
</P>
<P>
The new accord, outlined by federal officials in a telephone news
conference Friday, spells out how three down-river states,
California, Arizona and Nevada, will share the pain of river
shortages. It puts in place new measures to encourage
conservation and manage the two primary reservoirs, Lake Mead and
Lake Powell, which have gone from nearly full to just about half
empty since 1999.
</P>
<P>
The accord is expected to forestall litigation that was likely to
have arisen as fast-growing states jockey for the best way to
keep the water flowing to their residents and businesses in
increasingly dry times. It would be in effect through 2026 and
could be revised during that time.
</P>
<P>
Some environmental groups said the pact did not go far enough to
encourage conservation and discourage growth. But federal
officials said they took the best of several proposals by the
states, environmental organizations and others and emphasized the
importance of all seven states agreeing with the result.
</P>
<P>
"I think for the first time in 85 years we are on the same page,"
said Herb Guenther, the director of water resources in Arizona,
which had initially balked at some terms of the agreement and was
threatening legal action over it.
</P>
<P>
But with water levels in reservoirs dropping, a record eight-year
drought, the prospect that climate change could bring more dry
spells and new scientific analyses suggesting the West could be
drier than has been traditionally believed, the states were
pushed to act.
</P>
<P>
These factors "forced the issue to the head and we decided to do
something unique and different," Guenther said.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, the product of two-and-a-half years of negotiation
and study, establishes criteria for the Interior Department to
declare a shortage on the river, which would occur when the
system is unable to produce the 7.5 million acre-feet of water,
enough to supply 15 million homes for a year, that the three down
river states are entitled to.
</P>
<P>
Water deliveries would be decreased based on how far water levels
drop in Lake Mead and Lake Powell. The Bureau of Reclamation,
which manages the river system, predicts about a 5 percent chance
of such a shortage being declared by 2010, but it all depends on
how much the states are able to conserve and, of course, the
weather.
</P>
<P>
The probability projection "does not imply it can't happen," said
Terry Fulp, a bureau official involved in managing the river.
</P>
<P>
Water districts, anticipating an eventual cutback of Colorado
River water, have been storing large amounts of water and the
accord encourages them to continue to do so.
</P>
<P>
The pact includes a bundle of agreements with the states,
including approval for water managers in the Las Vegas area,
which gets 90 percent of its water from the Colorado, to get a
greater share of Lake Mead water in exchange for financing a
reservoir in California to capture large amounts of river water
destined for Mexico but beyond that country's entitlement by
treaty.
</P>
<P>
"It's hugely important for us," said Scott Huntley, a spokesman
for the Southern Nevada Water Authority. "This really does
provide the bridge for us to get into the next decade."
</P>
<P>
But John Weisheit, conservation director for Living Rivers, a
Utah-based environmental group, said the agreement sends the
message to the states that growth trumps sensible water
management. Weisheit said the conservation should have been
stressed and the government's computer modeling was overly
optimistic about future water supply.
</P>
<P>
"There is more water on paper than there actually is on the
landscape," he said. "They are looking at this in a way that will
allow more development even though the water is not theoretically
there."
