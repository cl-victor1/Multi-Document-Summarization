Hackers overwhelm some vital Internet traffic computers

WASHINGTON 2007-02-07 01:43:26 UTC

<P>
Hackers briefly overwhelmed at least three of the 13 computers
that help manage global computer traffic Tuesday in one of the
most significant attacks against the Internet since 2002.
</P>
<P>
Experts said the unusually powerful attacks lasted as long as 12
hours but passed largely unnoticed by most computer users, a
testament to the resiliency of the Internet. Behind the scenes,
computer scientists worldwide raced to cope with enormous volumes
of data that threatened to saturate some of the Internet's most
vital pipelines.
</P>
<P>
The Homeland Security Department confirmed it was monitoring what
it called "anomalous" Internet traffic.
</P>
<P>
"There is no credible intelligence to suggest an imminent threat
to the homeland or our computing systems at this time," the
department said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The motive for the attacks was unclear, said Duane Wessels, a
researcher at the Cooperative Association for Internet Data
Analysis at the San Diego Supercomputing Center. "Maybe to show
off or just be disruptive; it doesn't seem to be extortion or
anything like that," Wessels said.
</P>
<P>
Other experts said the hackers appeared to disguise their origin,
but vast amounts of rogue data in the attacks were traced to
South Korea.
</P>
<P>
The attacks appeared to target UltraDNS, the company that
operates servers managing traffic for Web sites ending in "org"
and some other suffixes, experts said. Officials with NeuStar
Inc., which owns UltraDNS, confirmed only that it had observed an
unusual increase in traffic.
</P>
<P>
Among the targeted "root" servers that manage global Internet
traffic were ones operated by the Defense Department and the
Internet's primary oversight body.
</P>
<P>
"There was what appears to be some form of attack during the
night hours here in California and into the morning," said John
Crain, chief technical officer for the Internet Corp. for
Assigned Names and Numbers. He said the attack was continuing and
so was the hunt for its origin.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think anybody has the full picture," Crain said. "We're
looking at the data."
</P>
<P>
Crain said Tuesday's attack was less serious than attacks against
the same 13 "root" servers in October 2002 because technology
innovations in recent years have increasingly distributed their
workloads to other computers around the globe.
