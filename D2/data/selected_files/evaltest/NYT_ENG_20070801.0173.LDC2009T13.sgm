MATTEL RECALLING 1 MILLION TAINTED TOYS MADE IN CHINA
</HEADLINE>

Mattel, the maker of Barbie dolls and Hot Wheels cars, is
recalling nearly 1 million toys in the United States on Thursday
because the products' surfaces are covered in lead paint.
</P>
<P>
According to Mattel, all the toys were made by a contract
manufacturer in China.
</P>
<P>
The recall, the second-biggest this year involving toys, covers
86 different products, manufactured between April and July 6.
Many of them feature "Sesame Street" and Nickelodeon characters
-- including the Elmo Tub Sub, the Dora the Explorer Backpack,
and the Giggle Gabber, a toy shaped like Elmo or Cookie Monster
that toddlers shake to hear giggles and funny noises.
</P>
<P>
Mattel says it prevented more than two-thirds of the 967,000
affected toys from reaching consumers by contacting retailers,
like Wal-Mart, Target and Toys 'R' Us, late last week. But more
than 300,000 of the tainted toys have been purchased by consumers
in the United States.

A complete list can be found at nytimes.com, as well as the Web
sites of Mattel and the Consumer Product Safety Commission.

<P>
In recent months, factories in China have been sources of
poisonous pet food sold in stores in the United States, dangerous
car tires, and lead paint on the popular Thomas &amp;amp; Friends
wooden toys.
</P>
<P>
This is Mattel's 17th recall in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the new recall, Nancy Nord, acting Consumer Product
Safety Commission chairwoman, said in a statement, "These
recalled toys have accessible lead in the paint and parents
should not hesitate in taking them away from children." The
statement said that the commission had launched an investigation
and that "ensuring that Chinese made toys are safe for U.S.
consumers is one of my highest priorities and is the subject of
vital talks currently in place between CPSC and the Chinese
government."

Earlier this summer, RC2, the maker of Thomas trains, recalled
1.5 million trains and accessories because a Chinese supplier had
coated them in lead paint. At that time, consumer safety experts
and toy industry analysts said that Mattel was unlikely to face
such a problem.
</P>
<P>
In early July, according to Mattel executives, one of the
European retailers that sells Mattel toys discovered the lead on
some products. On July 6, Mattel stopped operations at the
factory that produced the toys and initiated an investigation.
</P>
<P>
On July 18, Mattel took a reporter for The New York Times on a
tour of a factory in Guanyao, China, and of Mattel's toy safety
laboratory in Shenzhen. At that time, Mattel executives say, it
was unclear whether Mattel was facing a widespread lead paint
problem, or if the European case was an anomaly.
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday, the company's executives say they received
conclusive data that persuaded them to recall the 86 products.
