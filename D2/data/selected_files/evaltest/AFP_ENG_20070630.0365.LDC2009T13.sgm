Glasgow airport car fire was 'attack': British PM
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
British Prime Minister Gordon Brown confirmed Saturday that an
incident in which a blazing jeep rammed into a terminal at
Scotland's Glasgow airport was "an attack", as he justified
raising the security threat level to "critical".
</P>
<P>
Speaking after an emergency meeting of senior ministers and
intelligence chiefs, he praised the emergency services for their
response to foiling two car bomb attacks in London Friday and
"now today the attack in Glasgow."
</P>
<P>
Until Brown spoke, there had been no official confirmation that
the incident in Glasgow Saturday afternoon was being treated as a
deliberate attack.
</P>
<P>
"The first duty of a government is the security and safety of all
the British people," Brown said in a televised statement from his
Downing Street office.
</P>
<P>
"So it is right to raise the levels of security at airports and
in crowded places in the light of the heightened threat.
</P>
<P>
"I want all British people to be vigilant and I want them to
support the police and all the authorities.... I know the British
people will stand together united, resolute and strong."
