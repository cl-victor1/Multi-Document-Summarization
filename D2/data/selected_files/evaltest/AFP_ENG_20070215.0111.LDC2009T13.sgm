Tight security for Madrid bombings trial
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tight security was imposed Thursday for the start of the trial of
29 mostly Moroccan suspects charged with involvement in the 2004
Madrid train bomb attacks.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of police were deployed at the high-security court on the
outskirts of Madrid, while a helicopter flew overhead.
</P>
<P>
The first defendants arrived in two vans led by a police car with
sirens wailing.
</P>
<P>
Family members of the victims of the attacks which killed 191
people and injured 1,824 others, making it the worst terror
strike Spain has ever known, also gathered at the high court.
</P>
<P>
"My legs are shaking, I am scared, my stomach is churning," said
Pilar Manjon, the head of a victims association, who lost her 20
-year-old sone in the attacks.
</P>
<P>
"It will be difficult to look into the eyes of those who
destroyed my life, but I am going to do it for my son," she added
with tears in her eyes as she arrived at the court, falling in
the arms of her lawyer.
</P>
<P>
Over 1,000 people, police, family members of the victims,
lawyers, and journalists from around the world are expected at
the court for the first day of the trial.
</P>
<P>
All those on trial will give evidence from a bullet-proof box.
Media, survivors and relatives of the victims will be able to
watch via closed circuit television in different rooms, although
a handful of seats in the 180-seat courtroom have been reserved
for the public.
</P>
<P>
Spain raised its anti-terrorist alert to medium from low on
Tuesday in advance of the trial and ahead of the third
anniversary of the attacks.
</P>
<P>
Extra police and soldiers will guard crowded areas such as
shopping centres and transport hubs as well as the water supply
and power plants while the heightened alert level is in place.
</P>
<P>
The trial is expected to wrap up in July with a verdict expected
in October.
