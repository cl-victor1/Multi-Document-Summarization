Pollution puts postmenopausal women at greater health risk: study

LOS ANGELES, Feb. 1 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
Air pollution poses a greater risk to postmenopausal women,
making them more vulnerable to cardiovascular disease, said a new
study.
</P>
<P>
Postmenopausal women who live in areas with higher air pollution
levels have a higher risk of developing cardiovascular disease
and of dying from it, said the study by researchers at the
University of Washington.
</P>
<P>
The higher and longer the exposure to air pollution, the bigger
the threat to postmenopausal women, warned the study appearing on
the HealthDay News website.
</P>
<P>
The risk of heart disease is higher than previously thought, and
there can be substantial variations within individual cities,
said the study.
</P>
<P>
"The risk of having a cardiovascular event, that is, a heart
attack, stroke or needing bypass surgery, or of dying of a
cardiovascular cause, was increased," said study senior author
Dr. Joel Kaufman, professor of environmental and occupational
medicine and epidemiology at the University of Washington.
</P>
<P>
The study is the first to look at new cases of cardiovascular
disease, not just death. It was also the first to look at air
pollution levels within cities.
</P>
<P>
Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the
United States, accounting for one in three deaths.
</P>
<P>
Reducing fine particulate air pollution could result in less
cardiovascular disease and fewer deaths, the study stated.
</P>
<P>
Fine particulate matter is comprised of tiny particles of soot or
dust carried in the air. "They mostly come from combustion of
fossil fuels, although vegetative burning has an impact in some
cities," Kaufman said.
