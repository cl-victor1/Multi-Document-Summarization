Bridge collapses into Mississippi River during rush hour in
Minneapolis

Rescuers have given up hope of finding any more survivors after
an eight-lane bridge spanning the Mississippi River collapsed in
rush-hour traffic, although more vehicles can be seen in the
murky water, a rescue official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"At this point it is a recovery effort," said Hennepin County
Sheriff Rich Stanek, speaking early Thursday after rescue
attempts were abandoned for the night because of the dangers of
the operation. "It's dark, it's not safe with the currents in the
water and the concrete," he said.
</P>
<P>
About 50 cars were still in the water, the officials added. The
collapse did not appear to be terrorism-related. The bridge
linked the twin cities of Minneapolis and Saint Paul.
</P>
<P>
Minneapolis Fire Chief Jim Clack also said there were unlikely to
be any survivors. "We think there are several more vehicles in
the river we can't see yet," Clack said.
</P>
<P>
About 20 families had gathered at an information center, looking
for information on loved ones apparently missing.
</P>
<P>
"I've never wanted to see my brother so much in my life," said
Kristi Foster, who went to the center looking for Kirk. She
hadn't had contact with her brother or his girlfriend since the
previous night, and his cell phone was switched off.
</P>
<P>
Clack said 60 people were taken to area hospitals for treatment
and that the death toll could rise.
</P>
<P>
The eight-lane Interstate 35W bridge, a major Minneapolis artery,
was being repaired and two lanes in each direction were closed
when the bridge buckled Wednesday evening, breaking into huge
sections and collapsing into the river, pitching dozens of cars
60 feet (18 meters) into the water and killing at least seven.
</P>
<P>
Search lights on the banks illuminated a horrific scene of
twisted wreckage, thick concrete slabs, twisted steel and crushed
cars tossed about haphazardly. A line of ambulances idled along
the adjacent bridge.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, this is a catastrophe of historic proportions for
Minnesota," said Gov. Tim Pawlenty.
</P>
<P>
Pawlenty said the 40-year-old bridge was inspected by the
Minnesota Department of Transportation in 2005 and 2006 and that
no immediate structural problems were noted. "There were some
minor things that needed attention," he said.
</P>
<P>
Federal officials and Minnesota lawmakers will travel to the Twin
Cities Thursday to begin investigating the collapse.
</P>
<P>
The National Transportation Safety Board will be sending a team
of investigators, NTSB spokesman Ted Lopatkiewicz said.
</P>
<P>
Road crews were working on the bridge's joints, guardrails and
lights this week, with lane closures overnight on Tuesday and
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Aerial shots from local television stations showed the entire
span of Interstate 35W had crumpled into the river below. Some
injured people were carried up the riverbank, while emergency
workers tended to others on the ground and some jumped into the
water to look for survivors. Fire and black smoke rose from the
wreckage.
</P>
<P>
A school bus had just crossed the midsection of the bridge before
it collapsed. The bus did not go into the water, and broadcast
reports indicated the children on the bus exited out the back
door.
</P>
<P>
Christine Swift's 10-year-old daughter, Kaleigh, was on the bus,
returning from a field trip to Bunker Hills in Blaine. She said
her daughter called her about 6:10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
"She was screaming, 'The bridge collapsed,'" Swift said. All 60
kids got off the bus safely, but about 10 of the children were
injured, officials said.
</P>
<P>
The collapsed bridge stood just blocks from the heart of
Minneapolis, near tourist attractions like the new Guthrie
Theater and the Stone Arch Bridge. As the steamy night
progressed, massive crowds gathered.
</P>
<P>
The river's depth at the bridge was not immediately available,
but the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers maintains a channel depth of
at least 9 feet (three meters) in the Upper Mississippi from
Minneapolis southward to allow for barge and other river traffic.
</P>
<P>
There were 18 construction workers on the bridge at the time of
the collapse, said Tom Sloan, head of the bridge division for
Progressive Contractors Inc., in St. Michael. One of the workers
was unaccounted for.
</P>
<P>
Sloan said his crew was placing concrete finish on the bridge for
what he called a routine resurfacing project. "It was the final
item on this phase of the project. Suddenly the bridge gave way,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Sloan said his workers described a horrific scene. "They said
they basically rode the bridge down to the water. They were
sliding into cars and cars were sliding into them," he said.
</P>
<P>
Several hundred people climbed to the top of the hill in nearby
Gold Medal Park, which offered a partially blocked view of the
collapsed bridge. A few cried, while others stood in circles and
prayed.
</P>
<P>
The steel-arched bridge, which was built in 1967, rose about 64
feet (20 meters) above the river and stretched about 1,900 (580
meters) feet across the water. The bridge was built with a single
steel arch to avoid putting any piers in the water that might
interfere with river navigation.
