NY Times: US regulators reviewing safety of children ' s cold
drugs

Common children's cold and cough medicines are coming under
scrutiny from federal drug regulators, who say the remedies and
their recommended doses have not been studied enough in children,
a newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Charles J. Ganley, a top Food and Drug Administration
official, said the agency was "revisiting the risks and benefits
of the use of these drugs in children," especially those under 2,
The New York Times reported in Friday's editions.
</P>
<P>
Most over-the-counter cold and cough medicines have been
insufficiently tested in children, said Ganley, the director of
the FDA's office of nonprescription drug products.
</P>
<P>
"We have no data on these agents of what's a safe and effective
dose in children," he told The Times in an interview.
</P>
<P>
The FDA said it could not yet determine whether new regulations
would result from the safety review, according to the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
A group of pediatricians and public health officials asked the
agency Thursday to bar drug manufacturers from marketing such
remedies as Toddler's Dimetapp, Infant Triaminic and Little Colds
to children under 6.
</P>
<P>
A recent study by the federal Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention showed that more than 1,500 children under 2 had
experienced serious health problems -- and three died -- after
taking common cold medicines in 2004 and 2005. The American
College of Chest Physicians last year recommended avoiding using
cough and cold medicines in children, especially young ones.
</P>
<P>
In above-normal doses, cold medicines can lead to heart
arrhythmias, and some have been linked to hypertension and stroke
when taken in high doses, The Times reported. In rare cases,
children have had medical problems after taking recommended
doses, the article said.
</P>
<P>
The president of the Consumer Healthcare Products Association,
which represents companies that sell over-the-counter cold drugs,
noted that the medicines had FDA approval and had been used for
decades. They should be taken only in recommended doses,
association president Linda A. Suydam said.
</P>
<P>
The pediatricians who petitioned the FDA Thursday acknowledged
that children's cold medicines were generally safe in recommended
doses, but they said overdoses were common because many children
were given more than one medicine, among other reasons. They also
questioned the drugs' effectiveness in children.
</P>
<P>
Many cold and cough drugs won FDA approval decades ago, when the
agency's standards were less strict, The Times reported.
