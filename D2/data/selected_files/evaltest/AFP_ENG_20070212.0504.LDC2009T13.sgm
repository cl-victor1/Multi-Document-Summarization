Jail for ETA members who wanted to 'sow panic' in Madrid
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two members of Basque separatist group ETA arrested while
transporting half a tonne of explosives to Madrid just prior to
the March 2004 bombings Monday received jail sentences of 22
years each.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors alleged Irkus Badillo and Gorka Vidal wanted to "sow
panic" in Madrid after being caught in possession of 500
kilogrammes (1,100 pounds) of explosives, and had called on the
high court to hand down 29-year sentences.
</P>
<P>
The two men were jailed for belonging to a terrorist group,
conspiring to commit terrorist offences and illegally
transporting explosives.
</P>
<P>
A third ETA member, Benat Barrondo, was jailed for five years for
collaborating with a terrorist group.
</P>
<P>
Badillo and Vidal are both due to appear in court again at the
separate trial of the Madrid train bombers which begins on
Thursday. The men have been called as defence witnesses for one
of the accused, Moroccan national Jamal Zougam.
</P>
<P>
Zougam is accused of being one of the men who placed the bombs
which exploded aboard four packed commuter trains on the morning
of March 11, 2004.
</P>
<P>
A total of 191 people died in Spain's worst terror attack.
</P>
<P>
The then conservative government initially blamed ETA for the
train blasts, even as evidence emerged suggesting radical Muslims
were to blame.
</P>
<P>
The majority of the 29 people on trial for the blasts are
Moroccan.
</P>
<P>
Judicial investigators, the police and a parliamentary
investigation ruled out ETA involvement in the bombings.
