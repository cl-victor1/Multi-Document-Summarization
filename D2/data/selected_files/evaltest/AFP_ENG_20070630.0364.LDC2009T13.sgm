Glasgow airport incident, fire was 'attack': British PM
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Prime Minister Gordon Brown confirmed Saturday that an incident
in which a blazing jeep rammed into a terminal at Scotland's
Glasgow airport was "an attack", as he justified raising the
security threat level to "critical".
</P>
<P>
Speaking after an emergency meeting of senior ministers and
intelligence chiefs, he praised the emergency services for their
response to foiling two car bomb attacks in London Friday and
"now today the attack in Glasgow".
</P>
<P>
"It is right to raise the levels of security at airports and
crowded places in the light of the heightened threat," he added.
