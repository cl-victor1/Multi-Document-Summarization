JINAN, Feb. 22 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
East China's Shandong Province, a coastal region that suffers
from a shortage of fresh water, will invest 3.6 billion yuan over
the next four years to build 21 sea water desalination plants.
</P>
<P>
Once built, the plants will turn out about 140 million cubic
meters of fresh water every year, according to a government plan.
</P>
<P>
Qingdao, Yantai, Binzhou and a few other cities will benefit from
the project, according to the plan.
</P>
<P>
Like many Chinese regions, Shandong is suffering a worsening
water shortage, but its 3,024 kilometers of coastline offers the
solution of desalinating sea water.
</P>
<P>
Shandong currently has 16 plants desalinating 32,000 cubic meters
of sea water per day, 57 percent of the country's total.
</P>
<P>
Besides sea water desalination, Shandong is seeking more fresh
water through China's mammoth south-to-north water diversion
program and the water diversion program of the Yellow River.
</P>
<P>
The water resources in Shandong meet only one third of the
province's demand.
</P>
<P>
According to the State Development and Reform Commission and some
other state- level agencies, desalinated seawater is expected to
contribute 16 to 24 percent of the water supply in coastal areas
by 2010, with a daily processing capacity of up to 3 million
cubic meters in 2020.
</P>
<P>
China is among the driest countries in the world, and 400 out of
600 Chinese cities suffer from water shortages for domestic and
industrial uses.
