<P>
The U.S. government is warning parents not to give cough and cold
medicines to children under 2 without a doctor's order, part of
an overall review of the products' safety and effectiveness for
youngsters.
</P>
<P>
Amid questions about benefits and risks, the Food and Drug
Administration said Wednesday its Nonprescription Drugs Advisory
Committee will meet Oct. 18-19 to discuss the use of cough and
cold drugs by children.
</P>
<P>
The FDA issued a public health advisory that cited serious
adverse effects linked to children -- particularly those 2 and
younger -- who have received too great a dose of over-the-counter
medications for coughs and colds.
</P>
<P>
Parents should carefully follow directions for use that come with
a medication, the FDA said. Other recommendations in the advisory
included:
</P>
<P>
--Do not use cough and cold products in children under 2 unless
given specific directions to do so by a health care provider.
</P>
<P>
--Do not give children medicine that is packaged and made for
adults. Use only products marked for use in babies, infants or
children, sometimes called "pediatric" use.
</P>
<P>
--Cough and cold medicines come in different strengths. If unsure
about the right product for a child, ask a health care provider.
</P>
<P>
--If other medicines, whether over-the-counter or prescription,
are being given to a child, the child's health care provider
should review and approve their combined use.
</P>
<P>
--Read all of the information in the "Drug Facts" box on the
package label to know the active ingredients and the warnings.
</P>
<P>
--For liquid products, parents should use the measuring device
that is packaged with each medicine formulation and is marked to
deliver the recommended dose. A kitchen teaspoon or tablespoon is
not an appropriate measuring device.
