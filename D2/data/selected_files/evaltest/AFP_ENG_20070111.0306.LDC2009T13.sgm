Heart disease: chromosomes show the long and the short of it
</HEADLINE>

Telomeres -- nubby strips of DNA that cap the ends of chromosomes
-- predict a man's risk of developing heart disease, according to
study published in Saturday's issue of The Lancet.
</P>
<P>
Telomeres get shorter each time a cell divides. Shorter telomeres
indicate older cells and are thus a marker of biological ageing,
which varies according to the individual.
</P>
<P>
British doctors measured the length of telomeres in the
chromosomes of white blood cells among men aged 45-64 who had
enrolled in a big study on coronary prevention in western
Scotland.
</P>
<P>
The 484 men who went on to develop coronary heart disease had
shorter telomeres than the 1,058 men who remained disease-free,
the investigators discovered.
</P>
<P>
The same Scottish study also randomly assigned some volunteers to
receive statins, a drug which breaks down artery-clogging
cholesterol. Other volunteers received a dummy lookalike pill
called a placebo.
</P>
<P>
The researchers found that in the placebo group, the risk of
heart disease was almost double among the men with short
telomeres compared with counterparts with long telomeres.
</P>
<P>
But the good news was that in the statin group, those with short
telomeres enjoyed a substantial cut in the risk of heart disease.
</P>
<P>
The study says that measuring the length of telomeres in middle-
aged men could help pinpoint those most at risk of heart disease
and direct them to statin treatment.

science at the University of Leicester, central England.
