Unprecedented Japan summit aims to save world ' s threatened tuna
stocks

Nothing highlights Japan's insatiable hunger for tuna like the
fish aisle at a supermarket -- brick-size chucks of savory red
meat, trays of delicately sliced sashimi and shelf-loads of sushi
rolls.
</P>
<P>
Prized bluefin specimens the size of grown men, hooked as far
away as the Mediterranean, are packed in ice and flown for next-
day delivery to Tokyo, where they can fetch hundreds of dollars
per pound (hundreds of euros per kilogram) at auction.
</P>
<P>
With soaring demand and prices to match, it's a small wonder that
global tuna stocks are on the verge of collapse. The new question
is how long -- or if -- the binge can continue.
</P>
<P>
This week scientists, regulators and fishermen are trying to
reverse the decline at an unprecedented global summit to save the
silvery fish and one of the world's most valuable and endangered
catches.
</P>
<P>
At stake is an annual global haul worth hundreds of millions of
dollars (euros) and the preservation of a top-tier predator fish
that helps hold the ocean ecosystem in balance.
</P>
<P>
The conference, which ends Friday in the western city of Kobe, is
the first by the world's five regional tuna regulating bodies to
form a global strategy.
</P>
<P>
"Sustainable management of the world's tuna fisheries should be
possible, if the will can be found," Simon Cripps, director of
World Wildlife Fund's marine program, said in a statement Monday.
"But many governments are routinely ignoring scientific advice,
failing to implement the available conservation and management
measures."
</P>
<P>
Some scientists believe that by 2030 there may be no mature tuna
left among species like the southern bluefin if overfishing and
poaching aren't addressed.
</P>
<P>
Japan's role as host to the Kobe conference is highly symbolic of
its role as a major tuna consumer. The country accounts for 12
percent of the global catch of 2.06 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Japan's fisheries agency says the country gobbles up a quarter of
the world supply of the five big species: bluefin, southern
bluefin, bigeye, yellowfin and albacore.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from the commercial fishing industry,
environmental groups and government regulators are discussing
ways to strengthen information sharing and cooperation among
regional organizations to track and manage tuna stocks.
</P>
<P>
Participants are seeking to create a framework requiring
fishermen -- not just exporters -- to produce certificates of
origin for the tuna they catch.
</P>
<P>
The delegates also want to call for a monitoring system to track
tuna from the open sea to the fish market.
</P>
<P>
That should help crack down on illegal fishing and countries that
exceed quotas.
</P>
<P>
A global approach is seen as essential because tuna are highly
migratory, journeying thousands of miles (kilometers) between
feeding and spawning grounds. Overfishing on one side of an ocean
can affect fisheries half a world away.
</P>
<P>
By 2004, the number of adult Atlantic bluefin tuna capable of
spawning had plummeted to roughly 19 percent of the 1975 level in
the western half of the ocean, according to the International
Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas.
</P>
<P>
Some action has already been taken.
</P>
<P>
In October, the Commission for the Conservation of Southern
Bluefin Tuna agreed at a meeting in Miyazaki, Japan, to reduce
the global catch of the endangered southern bluefin tuna by more
than 20 percent in 2007.
</P>
<P>
At that meeting, Japan also promised to halve its quota for the
southern bluefin tuna as compensation for overfishing, but denied
poaching allegations.
</P>
<P>
But activists say overall quotas are still too high, and other
challenges persist.
</P>
<P>
Tuna farms, for instance, are seen as one way of feeding global
demand without depleting natural populations. But
conservationists warn that poaching has expanded to capture live
tuna for delivery to such farms, where they are fattened for
market.
</P>
<P>
At the Kobe meetings, Australia, Japan and the United States have
also proposed a unified performance review of the five global
tuna organizations to figure out which conservation techniques
work. It would also assess efforts to combat illegal fishing and
bycatch -- the accidental catching of the fish.
</P>
<P>
"We hope to accelerate cooperation as a result of this study,"
said Takaaki Suzuki, an official at Japan's fisheries ministry.
"Some stocks are not in danger, others are."
</P>
<P>
Delegates were expected to conclude the conference Friday by
releasing an action plan outlining future steps to save the tuna.
