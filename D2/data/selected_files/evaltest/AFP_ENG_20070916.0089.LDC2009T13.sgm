OJ Simpson, the ex-American footballer at the center of a
notorious murder trial in the 1990s, has been arrested in
connection with an armed robbery in Las Vegas, US television
reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Police arrested him in a continuing investigation over an alleged
armed robbery of sports memorabilia at a casino hotel room, Las
Vegas police cited on news networks said.
</P>
<P>
Simpson had been interrogated late Thursday following reports of
a robbery from a guest's room at the Palace Station casino in
which he is alleged to have played a part, police Captain James
Dillon told reporters Friday.
</P>
<P>
Simpson was released without charge last week after questioning,
but taken into custody again Sunday, according to reports.
</P>
<P>
Media said Sunday another man, Walter Alexander, was arrested in
the case and charged with armed robbery, but CNN news reported
that according to witnesses Simpson himself did not possess a
gun.
</P>
<P>
The alleged stolen items included "sports-related products"
according to authorities. The alleged victim was identified by
celebrity news website TMZ.com, as Alfred Beardsley, a collector
of sports memorabilia.
</P>
<P>
Beardsley told the website that Simpson and a group of men
entered his room pretending to be customers. Two men with Simpson
pulled guns during the robbery, Beardsley said.
</P>
<P>
Simpson, one of the most famous American football players of his
generation during the 1970s, was the prime suspect in the 1994
murders of his estranged wife Nicole Brown-Simpson and her friend
Ron Goldman.
</P>
<P>
Simpson, who has always denied the killings, was acquitted of
them after a racially charged Los Angeles trial in 1995, a
verdict that was greeted with widespread outrage across America.
</P>
<P>
The former sports star was subsequently found liable for the
deaths in a 1997 civil suit and was ordered to pay damages to the
victims' families totaling 33.5 million dollars.
