<TEXT>
	   OAK HARBOR, Ohio (AP) _ The atomic power plant's control room
grew dim. Instrument lights flashed red as the storm raging outside
knocked out two of three power lines. Then came the urgent warning
from security: Cameras showed three distinct funnel clouds taking
dead aim.
	   Moments later the last power link was cut, and the control room
briefly went dark. The plant computer failed. A ``red phone'' hot
line to Washington went dead.
	   On June 24, the Davis-Besse Nuclear Station on Lake Erie took
the worst direct hit by a tornado ever weathered by a U.S. atomic
plant. The 900-megawatt reactor shut down automatically and no
radiation leaked, largely because of the staff's quick, competent
responses and backup equipment.
	   But for 41 tense hours, an array of equipment problems
complicated efforts to keep the reactor's radioactive fuel core
cool and to communicate inside and outside the plant. Among the
problems:
	   _The tornado severed fiber optic lines and knocked out the
plant's main phone system. The federal hot line, linked directly to
the plant, also failed. A microwave-based phone system provided
limited service but slowed plant officials' efforts to notify local
and state emergency managers that they had declared an alert _ the
second of four increasingly serious emergency classifications.
	   _ Because of a faulty switch, a key safety display went black
for two hours immediately after the tornado. Heat knocked it out
again the next afternoon.
	   _ Two locomotive-sized emergency diesel generators provided
power to avert a total plant blackout, but temperatures in the room
housing one generator rose just above the operating limit when a
vent got stuck the afternoon after the storm.
	   ``For a few minutes your heart goes up into your throat,'' said
Bob Donnellon, the plant's emergency director when the generator
alarm sounded. ``But you have a gut feeling that it's OK. Your guys
confirm it. Your comfort level comes back a bit.''
	   Hours later, as the plant was switching back to offsite power,
the second generator shut down a few seconds early because of a
faulty relay.
	   Plant managers also worried about rising temperatures in a
23-foot-deep (7-meter-deep) pool that cools spent reactor fuel. The
temperature reached 140 degrees Fahrenheit (60 degrees Celsius) _
roughly the point where evaporation would increase _ but enough
offsite electricity returned to power the cooling pumps.
	   In the end, public safety was never threatened, according to the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The NRC, which activated its
emergency command post outside Washington and alerted the White
House and other U.S. and international agencies, is preparing a
report on the equipment problems. The agency's senior inspector at
Davis-Besse, Steve Campbell, said he was aware of no operator error
throughout the episode.
	   An industry watchdog group complimented the plant staff.
	   ``They were faced with a lot of challenges they shouldn't have
had to face, and they met those challenges very well,'' said David
Lochbaum of the Union of Concerned Scientists. ``They're trying to
gain all the lessons learned from this event to make things even
better in the future.''
	   One lesson will be to alert plant workers about threatening
weather. The National Weather Service issued a severe thunderstorm
warning at 7:48 p.m. A tornado warning cleared at 8:44 p.m. With
winds of 80-90 mph (128-145 kph) on the leading edge of the storm
knocking out power all over Ottawa County, a regional dispatcher
for Toledo Edison neglected to pass along both warnings to the
Davis-Besse control room.
	   Inside the fortified command center, workers could not hear the
roaring winds or see the sickly yellowish sky. Their first warning
was a phone call from an off-duty colleague who lives nearby, at
8:36 p.m., NRC spokesman Jan Strasma said.
	   Less than 10 minutes later, a guard monitoring outside cameras
from the plant's security room saw three funnel clouds converging
into one over the plant and called the control room, said Jim
McGee, the plant supervisor that night.
	   Davis-Besse security analyst Jim Theisen went outside to check
conditions and saw water and debris being sucked out of the base of
the plant's cooling tower. ``There was large chunks of stuff coming
out,'' he said.
	   The tornado destroyed the plant's wind gauge; weather service
forecaster Larry Gabric estimated the twister's winds at almost 160
mph (255 kph).
	   Most seriously, the tornado ripped power cables from their
connectors in the electrical switchyard _ in essence the fuse box
for the entire plant.
	   In the control room, McGee watched the indicator for the last
power link go from green to red. The room briefly went dark except
for instruments and emergency lighting.
	   ``For those few seconds everyone's just standing still,'' McGee
said. ``And then the diesels come up, and everyone goes on with
their tasks.''
	   Even so, as the backup electricity relighted the control room,
the safety display stayed black. This was a system the NRC ordered
installed in U.S. nuclear plants after the partial meltdown in 1979
at Pennsylvania's Three Mile Island reactor, where control-room
confusion contributed to the nation's worst nuclear accident.
	   The 21-year-old Davis-Besse plant has a similarly designed
reactor to Three Mile Island's. It had serious operational problems
in the 1980s but is now considered one of the better-run of 107
operating nuclear plants in the country.
	   Plant officials declared the emergency over at 1:58 p.m. on June
26 after restoring a second power line.
	   Davis-Besse managers said the emergency proved the value of
their frequent accident drills.
	   ``We may complain about the emergency response guys and how much
they make us drill, but we don't now,'' Donnellon said.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Let the games begin.
	   No, not those games. The other ones _ The Goodwill Games, touted
as the alternative to the Olympic experience that offers money, as
well as gold medals, to winners.
	   On Saturday in lower Manhattan, revelry, fireworks and songs
opened the games' 15 days of multi-sport competition.
	   More than 1,300 athletes from 60 countries, representing sports
like swimming, gymnastics and ice skating (yes, even in the
summer), are expected to compete in the games.
	   The audience at Battery Park City had a clear view of the Statue
of Liberty as they awaited entertainment as mixed as the
competition: teen singing-sensation Brandy, pop stars Hootie and
the Blowish, Ray Charles, and a few Broadway stars.
	   ``New York City is the most diverse city in the world, it's the
best-known city in the world, and it's undergoing a remarkable
renaissance,'' mayor Rudolph Giuliani said. ``There's no more
appropriate place for this year's Goodwill Games than right here in
the city that's known far and wide as the capital of the world _
New York City.''
	   The crowd, which police estimated at 8,500, went wild with the
appearance of the Goodwill Games Dancers performing with a group of
kids dressed all in white _ the Junior Division Students of the
Alvin Ailey American Dance Center. As the two groups danced,
Natalie Cole and gospel singers BeBe and CeCe Winans sang ``In the
Eyes of a Child.''
	   ``It's really exciting to have one of the world's best sports
events right where you live. I love it. It's like waking up one day
_ and Godzilla's in your backyard,'' said Stoya Ruach, 12, who
lives on Manhattan's Lower East Side.
	   She's rooting for American and Canadian gymnasts, partly because
she got a chance to meet some Canadian athletes in the VIP section.
	   The Goodwill Games were founded by billionaire media mogul Ted
Turner as an olive branch offering to athletes after the Olympic
boycotts in 1980 and 1984 by the United States and the Soviet
Union, respectively.
	   Some of the proceeds will go to The Boys and Girls Clubs of
America to develop programs and activities for youngsters.
	   Vice President Al Gore also got into the act. During a Saturday
morning visit to The Children's Aid Society Boys and Girls Club in
Harlem, he taped a message to the athletes to be played at the
opening ceremonies.
	   Gore refereed a relay race along with OIympic gold medal hurdler
Allen Johnson and former NCAA half-mile champion Joetta Clark, both
of whom are expected to compete.
	   The vice president even managed to shoot hoops with teen-agers,
drawing cheers from the crowds when he sank two consecutive 3-point
shots.
	   ``They told me no dunking today,'' Gore said to the crowd after
14-year-old John Jemmett slammed the basketball into the hoop.
	   But the real competition starts Sunday, with big names like
Olympic champs Michael Johnson, Alexander Popov, Dan O'Brien and
Jackie Joyner-Kersee on hand.
	   Ticket sales have not been impressive, with about half of the
600,000 available sold for events spread around New York City and
Long Island.
	   But there's a bright side to the smaller crowds.
	   ``It's better than the Olympics because it's not as large and
imposing,'' said Eileen Letter of Boston, sitting in a front row
with her husband and two boys. The family planned to take in the
swimming events and women's soccer.
	   ``You can come here, actually get tickets and grab a little
piece of the Goodwill Games for yourself,'' Mrs. Letter said.

	   AITAPE, Papua New Guinea (AP) _ Surrounded by dozens of people
injured when a towering tsunami hit Papua New Guinea's remote north
coast, local doctor Menno Swier warned on Sunday that the area is
dangerously short of medical supplies.
	   ``We need a lot of medication,'' Swier said. ``We're running out
of antibiotics ... we're running out of organic drip material. We
need blood banks and we need surgeons to operate on all these
people.''
	   At least 599 people were killed and hundreds more injured when a
tsunami spawned by a 7.0 magnitude earthquake crashed into Papua
New Guinea's north coast late Friday, crushing several villages.
	   At the Raihu Health Center in Aitape, one of the villages worst
hit, Swier stood surrounded by dozens of injured people sitting on
the floor waiting to be attended by overworked medical staff
members.
	   Most of the injured were suffering fractures and internal
bleeding, he said.
	   The relief center is stretched to its limit and more people were
expected to come in from areas devastated by the tsunami.
	   ``I think we only see the tip of the iceberg,'' said Swier, the
officer in charge of the medical center.
	   A small amount of relief supplies, including stretcher beds and
biscuits, have begun trickling into Aitape from the nearby town of
Wewak.
	   An international relief effort is underway, with three
Australian defense forces Hercules C-130 transport planes loaded
with medical and other supplies due to leave Sydney later Sunday.

Rescuers find two more bodies from southern Philippine landslide
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAMBOANGA, Philippines (AP) _ Rescuers, armed only with spades
and hampered by rains, have recovered two more bodies from a
landslide in the southern Philippines, bringing the death toll to
five, police said Sunday.
	   The bodies were recovered late Saturday, police said.
	   At least two others were still missing and presumed to have died
in the landslide in Zamboanga del Norte province.
	   Heavy rain triggered the landslide, which sent tons of boulders
and mud cascading down the side of a mountain onto several houses
in Sinay village Thursday. Three people were immediately rescued
and three bodies were retrieved on Friday and Saturday afternoon.
	   Relatives of the victims blame years of heavy illegal logging in
Zamboanga's mountains for the tragedy.

Jones dominates despite being knocked down
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ED SCHUYLER JR. &QC; 
 &UR; AP Boxing Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Three years ago, Lou Del Valle worked for Roy
Jones Jr. as a sparring partner. On Saturday night, in The Theater
at Madison Square Garden, Del Valle found out Jones is still the
boss.
	   Jones pounded Del Valle's face lumpy, hurt him with body shots
and found time to showboat, too, as he won a clear-cut unanimous
12-round decision.
	   But, before Del Valle lost the WBA light heavyweight title to
Jones, the WBC 175-pound (79 kilos) champion, he brought the crowd
to its feet by knocking Jones down in the eighth round.
	   After Del Valle's brief moment in the spotlight, Jones took
control again but stopped the showboating.
	   Jones had just too much power and too much speed for Del Valle,
who was paid dlrs 750 a week when he sparred with Jones in 1995. On
Saturday night, Del Valle got dlrs 850,000 and he earned it.
	   Jones blasted him with rights to the head, left hooks and both
hands to the body and Del Valle had no answer except his courage.
	   Jones rocked Del Valle several times and cut him over the left
eye with an accidental head butt in the seventh round. By that
time, the left side of Del Valle's face was badly swollen and the
right side was puffed as well.
	   Jones was doing his thing again in the eighth round when, with
35 seconds left, the left-handed Del Valle landed a right-left to
the head that dropped Jones for a five-count.
	   Del Valle simply had nothing with which to follow up that
advantage.
	   However, that knockdown was the highlight of the fight for most
of the 4,519 fans in the 5,200-seat arena.
	   Judge Duane Ford scored it 119-108 for Jones and Marty Denkin
and Fred Ucci each favored Jones 118-109.
	   The AP scored it 118-109 for Jones.
	   ``He's a great fighter,'' Del Valle said. ``I'm a good fighter.
I respect him. I gave him too much respect. I could have fought him
better.''
	   ``He's not the toughest fighter I've fought, it's just that he
knows me from all the sparring,'' Jones said.
	   Jones, 29, who weighed the class limit of 175 pounds (79 kilos),
got dlrs 2 million for his 37th victory against one defeat. He
couldn't register his 32nd knockout.
	   The 30-year-old Del Valle, also 175 (79), is 27-2 with 19
knockouts.
	   On the undercard, Derrick ``Smoke'' Gainer twice knocked down
former WBC featherweight champion Kevin Kelley and won a unanimous
10-round decision. Kelley went down in the first and seventh rounds
as Gainer (24-4, 16 knockouts) avenged a knockout loss to Kelley
(48-3-2, 32 knockouts) in 1996. Both fighters weighed 126 (57).

	   In Pasadena, California, Jeff Cassar saved all three shootout
shots and made a team-record 10 saves during regulation to help the
Miami Fusion to a 3-2 win over the Los Angeles Galaxy on Saturday
night.
	   The Fusion scored on two of their three shots in regulation and
all three during the tie-breaking shootout to upset Major League
Soccer's Western Conference-leading Galaxy.
	   Marcelo Herrera scored in the 60th minute and Dan Stebbins in
the 80th for Miami (8-11), which won the shootout 3-0 on goals by
David Vaudreuil, John Maessner and Leo Cullen.
	   Mauricio Cienfugos scored in the 50th and 76th minutes for Los
Angeles (16-4), which led 27-3 in shots and 12-2 in shots on goal.
	   The first half was scoreless, with the Galaxy outshooting Miami
16-0.
 &UR; Mutiny 1, Clash 0
	   In San Jose, California, Mauricio Ramos scored the game-winner
with less than five minutes to play as the Tampa Bay Mutiny beat
the San Jose Clash 1-0 Saturday night.
	   Ramos took a pass from former Clash midfielder Dominic Kinnear
and left-footed a shot into the upper corner from 18 yards (16
meters) out.
	   Alan Prampin played the ball back to Kinnear to keep his
six-game scoring streak alive. Prampin has had a goal or an assist
in all six games since Tim Hankinson took over as Mutiny coach.
	   Goalkeeper Doug Petras, who started in place of the suspended
Thomas Ravelli, had six saves for his first career shutout.
	   Tampa Bay (6-15) moved into fourth place in the Eastern
Conference. San Jose, last in the Western Conference, fell to 6-13.

	   In Anaheim, California, Gary DiSarcina hit a tiebreaking two-run
double and rookie Jarrod Washburn pitched well after a rocky start
as Anaheim snapped Baltimore's nine-game winning streak.
	   After giving up two runs in the first inning, Washburn (5-2)
settled down and didn't allow another hit until Lenny Webster
chased him with a two-out homer in the sixth that cut Anaheim's
lead to 5-3.
	   The Angels scored a pair of runs in the seventh on Norm
Charlton's wild pitch and Matt Walbeck's sacrifice fly, then
increased their lead to 8-3 on Craig Shipley's RBI double in the
eighth.
	   The Orioles, who had only two hits after the first inning,
suffered their first loss since the All-Star break. The first-place
Angels won for only the fourth time in their last 15 games to stay
a half-game ahead of Texas in the AL West.

South Korea ends massive manhunt for possible North Korean spies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ South Korea has effectively ended a
fruitless manhunt for two possible North Korean spies, a week after
the body of a suspected communist infiltrator was found on an east
coast beach, military officials said Sunday.
	   Small-scale searches by regional land and coast guard units will
continue, but a massive search has ended and a dusk-to-dawn curfew
in most of the immediate area was lifted Saturday, said officials
at the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
	   South Korea believes any foreign agents who might have been in
the coastal region have probably either died or already returned to
North Korea, one military official said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
	   The official declined to elaborate.
	   The South Korean military has come under intense public
criticism for carrying out the unsuccessful week-long manhunt and
damaging the east coast's vital tourism industry.
	   The search was initiated after a body clad in a black diving
suit was washed ashore July 12 on an east coast beach. Also found
were a submachine gun, hand grenade and a torpedo-shaped underwater
propulsion device.
	   The underwater transport is capable of carrying up to five scuba
divers and is similar to devices used by North Korean spies in the
past.
	   Analyzing the weapons and equipment seized, military officials
thought that two companions of the dead communist infiltrator might
have come ashore. But the manhunt failed to find any North Korean
agents.
	   Late last week, the Defense Ministry fired three military
commandos, holding them responsible for the incursion.
	   North Korea denied involvement, accusing South Korean
ultra-rightists of staging the incident as part of an anti-North
Korea campaign.
	   A month ago, a small North Korean submarine was found entangled
in a fishing net off the east coast of South Korea.
	   Nine bodies were discovered in the Yugo-class sub, all shot to
death in what military investigators described as a murder-suicide
committed by senior officers to avoid capture.
	   With no peace treaty signed at the end of the 1950-53 Korean
War, the Koreas remain technically in a state of war. Their border
is the world's most heavily guarded, with nearly 2 million troops
deployed on both sides.

UN envoy holds talks in East Timor despite security fears
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER TORCHIA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAUCAU, Indonesia (AP) _ The search for a peace in troubled East
Timor gathered pace Sunday when a U.N. mediator flew into the
territory and held talks with military, local government and church
officials on Sunday despite security fears.
	   Jamsheed Marker, the U.N. special envoy on East Timor, arrived
in East Timor's second largest town of Baucau on an Indonesian
military C-130 plane from the tourist island of Bali after earlier
talks in Jakarta, Indonesia's capital.
	   ``I'm happy to be here,'' Marker said before entering an airport
building for a series of meetings with local military commanders,
East Timor's two Roman Catholic bishops and the provincial
governor.
	   There was no sign Sunday of the protests that have marred recent
visits by other foreign officials to East Timor, which is located
about 2,000 kilometers (1,200 miles) east of Jakarta.
	   Before leaving for East Timor, Marker told The Associated Press
that his visit would only be for a few hours, during which time he
hoped to canvass as many views and opinions as possible.
	   ``I'll be in and then out,'' he said.
	   Marker is trying to broker a peace deal for East Timor, ruled by
Portugal for hundreds of years before Indonesia sent in troops and
annexed the territory in 1976.
	   After talks with Indonesian President B.J. Habibie on Saturday,
Marker said he was ``very optimistic'' that peace can be negotiated
for the half-island territory.
	   Indonesia invaded East Timor in 1975, but many of the
territory's 800,000 inhabitants fervently wish for a vote on
independence and deeply resent Indonesian control.
	   The territory has endured guerrilla warfare and human rights
abuses for more than two decades.
	   Marker made his visit despite fears by the Indonesian government
and East Timor's 1996 Nobel Peace Prize winner, Roman Catholic
Bishop Carlos Belo, that his presence could trigger violent
protests by groups who either support or oppose Indonesian rule.
	   Since last month, Indonesian soldiers have killed two
pro-independence protesters. Two demonstrators were shot and killed
during Marker's last visit to East Timor in 1997.
	   More than 100 riot police staged a brief exercise around the
local government building in Dili on Sunday.
	   Stating that he wants to end the conflict in East Timor, Habibie
has offered to release jailed guerrilla leader Xanana Gusmao and
grant special status to the territory in return for international
recognition of it as an integral part of Indonesia.
	   However, he has refused to bow to demands by separatists for an
referendum on outright independence.
	   Indonesia says East Timor is its 27th province. But the United
Nations, Portugal and many other governments do not recognize the
claim.
	   Marker, who has also met Gusmao in a Jakarta prison on Friday,
arrived in Indonesia on Thursday and is due to leave Wednesday.

Suspected kidnapper of Taiwanese businessman arrested
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The suspected kidnapper of a wealthy
Taiwanese businessman who was held hostage in Thailand for 135 days
has been arrested, Thai newspapers reported Sunday.
	   Hsu Chung I, 56, was kidnapped in his factory by two armed men
on March 2 and held in squalid conditions while his captors
demanded a dlrs 1 million ransom. He escaped July 12.
	   The English-language Bangkok Post said police nabbed Bancha
Wanichbancha, a 57-year-old Thai, on Friday but were still looking
for two alleged accomplices.
	   The newspaper quoted Police Col. Chaturong Phumarin as saying
the kidnappers sent 14 letters to Hsu's relatives in Taiwan
demanding payment for his release.
	   Chaturong said that Bancha, who knew the Taiwanese businessman,
confessed to taking part in the kidnapping but accused another
person, known only as Berm, of being the mastermind.
	   Hsu was reportedly handcuffed, covered with a bag and held in a
building where he was given only one meal a day during his
captivity.

Second Malaysian editor resigns, conflict with government suspected
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The chief editor of Malaysia's
largest newspaper has resigned just days after the sudden departure
of another top editor, apparently over conflicts with the country's
leadership.
	   Ahmad Nazri Abdullah resigned as group editor of the
Malay-language daily Berita Harian with ``immediate effect,''
according to a statement from its owner, Malaysian Resources Corp.,
that was published in local newspapers Saturday.
	   Nazri, who has served as a company director since 1993, will
remain as director of New Straits Times Press, the Star newspaper
said. MRC is the parent company of NSTP, which in turn owns Berita
Harian.
	   The report did not give the reasons behind Nazri's reshuffling
but the move has prompted further fears of press curbs by the
governing party of Malaysia's Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
	   Most Malaysian newspapers follow a ``speak no evil'' policy in
reporting on the government and the country in general. Newspapers
must get annual publishing permits from the Home Ministry, which is
headed by Mahathir.
	   Nazri's resignation came four days after Johan Jaafar, the
editor-in-chief of another leading Malay-language daily, Utusan
Malaysia, handed in his resignation to Mahathir.
	   When Johan resigned observers said they expected the resignation
of Nazri because Berita Harian, like Utusan Malaysia, was viewed as
having stirred up problems within the United Malays National
Organization, which is headed by Mahathir.
	   Rustam Sani, a noted social critic, said Johan had been
perceived as supportive of Anwar Ibrahim, the country's finance
minister and deputy prime minister, whose views on economic policy
have often conflicted with those of Mahathir.
	   ``(Utusan's) line of reporting has always been favorable to
Anwar,'' he said.
	   Before the UMNO annual conference last month, both papers
highlighted allegations made by Zahid Hamidi, the leader of UMNO
youth and an Anwar supporter, of nepotism and cronyism in the
party.
	   Berita Harian is the country's largest newspaper with a daily
circulation of 270,000 and a Sunday readership of 450,000.
	   The Utusan group, which is largely owned by Mahathir's UMNO
party, has a larger Sunday circulation with about a half million
copies. Its chief editor is often a political appointee of the
prime minister.
	   Nazri will be replaced by Ahmad Rejal Arbee, the former editor
of the Sun newspaper, an English-language tabloid.
	   Lim Kit Siang, the parliamentary opposition leader, said in a
statement he believed the resignations were ``forced,'' and
evidence of ``a possible crackdown against an already very limited
press freedom in Malaysia.''
	   His concerns echoed those by The Committee to Protect
Journalists, which, earlier in the week, called Johan's resignation
``alarming'' for the same reason.
	   Mahathir Saturday denied that Johan had faced ``political
pressure'' to resign and said there was no government clampdown on
the media.
	   Mahathir, however, said that news reports should be ``balanced''
so as not to cause ``chaos and confusion in society.''
	   He lashed out at the Western press as having had a bad influence
on the domestic press.

Newcastle into three-point lead in NRL
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Newcastle moved three points ahead of
the rest of the field for the National Rugby League premiership
after escaping with a 28-22 win over St. George on Sunday.
	   The Knights led 22-6 at halftime but had to withstand a spirited
Saints comeback and several key injuries.
	   With captain Paul Harragon still not having recovered from a
knee problem, Newcastle lost prop Glenn Grief and second rower Troy
Fletcher during the match and both are expected to be sidelined for
several weeks.
	   In Brisbane, replacement fullback Michael Devere collected 18
points as the Broncos punished the Gold Coast 44-10. Filling in for
Darren Lockyer, Devere scored two tries and booted six goals from
eight attempts.
	   The Broncos, who moved into second spot on the ladder, led 22-4
at halftime.
	   Sydney City scored 11 tries to record its biggest win over
Western Suburbs 62-4. Roosters coach Phil Gould made six changes
shortly before kickoff, highlighted by the inclusion of halfback
Adrian Lam, who suffered a concussion last week.
	   Lam ran in three tries while center Ivan Cleary finished with 22
points from a try and nine goals.
	   In Canberra, Raiders center Brandon Pearson strained his
hamstring in the only bad note in Canberra's 46-16 demolition of
South Sydney.
	   The match started with a minute's silence for former South
Sydney first grade front rower Adam Wright who was fatally shot
outside a Sydney hotel on Friday night.
	   On Saturday, a field goal from replacement Jamie Owens earned
Parramatta a 7-6 win over Canterbury, while Cronulla and Penrith
played to a 14-14 draw.
	   Manly preserved its slender semifinal hopes with a 22-12
come-from-behind win over Illawarra. The Sea Eagles scored four
unanswered tries in the second half to beat the Steelers.
	   Adelaide was denied two tries as North Queensland kept its slim
finals hopes alive with a 14-10 over the Rams.
	   On Friday, North Sydney scored a 34-10 win over Melbourne,
grinding out an 18-10 lead midway through the second half before
scoring three tries in the final 12 minutes.
	   Matthew Ridge, Tony Tatupu, Nigel Vagana scored tries for
Auckland as the Warriors edged Balmain 21-20, keeping alive their
slim playoff chances. (djp)

<TEXT>
	   PORT MORESBY, Papua New Guinea (AP) _ A tsunami spawned by a 7.0
magnitude earthquake crashed into Papua New Guinea's north coast,
crushing villages and killing nearly 600 people, officials said
Sunday.
	   The 23-foot (seven-meter) wall of water hit Friday night without
warning following an earthquake about 18 miles (30 kilometers) off
the coast of Papua New Guinea in the Pacific Ocean.
	   Australian government aid agency Ausaid officers in Papua New
Guinea estimated the final death toll would climb to more than
1,000, with many thousands injured, Australian Defense Minister Ian
McLachlan said.
	   Authorities at Aitape in the West Sepik province, on Papua New
Guinea's northwest coast, said the tsunami that hit the coast west
of the village on Friday night had wiped out three villages and had
almost completely destroyed another.
	   ``The latest death toll for the district is 599,'' district
disaster coordinating chairman Dickson Dalle said. ``But the figure
may increase as more bodies are found.''
	   Dalle said it was impossible to say how many people are missing.
	   ``There are still people out there who are injured that we have
not rescued,'' he said. ``They are scattered all over in the
mangroves.''
	   Dalle said most of the victims of the disaster were old people
and schoolchildren. Ausaid estimated 6,000 people were left
homeless, McLachlan said.
	   ``We have assumed that the schools in Arop, the schools in
Sissano and the schools in Warapu will be closed because we don't
have the children,`` Dalle said. ``They're dead . . . they're all
dead.''
	   Dalle said the Nimas village near the Sissano lagoon, the Warapu
village and the Arop village had been wiped out and the Malol
village had almost been completely destroyed.
	   Associated Press photographer Brian Cassey flew over the lagoon
Sunday and said the beaches on which a number of villages had been
built had been swept clean.
	   ``The villages no longer exist. The beaches are clean,'' Cassey
said. ``The lagoon is filled with debris, coconut palms and what
used to be houses.''
	   In Arop, where according to locals about 2,000 people lived,
there was no sign of life, he said. No bodies were visible from the
air.
	   ``The place is desolate. Not a soul is there,'' Cassey said.
	   Dalle said that at Warapu 500 people had been confirmed dead,
while Malol village had 40 dead and Sissano 41.
	   Prime Minister Bill Skate was expected to arrive in Aitape later
this afternoon to assess the situation.
	   Earlier, the National Disaster Center said that hundreds of
people were missing and thousands had no food or shelter.
	   Papua New Guinea, with a population of 4 million, is largely
dependent on agriculture and mining. The capital of Port Moresby is
located about 600 kilometers (375 miles) east of the northeastern
tip of Australia.
	   Disaster authorities said the stricken area, about 600
kilometers (370 miles) northwest of the capital of Port Moresby, is
spotted with villages consisting of homes made of jungle materials
and built on beaches.
	   Robert Igara, the government's chief secretary, said the
population in the area affected by the tsunami was 8,000 to 10,000
people.
	   Three Australian Defense Forces Hercules C-130 transport planes
were due to takeoff from Australia late Sunday with equipment to
set up a filed hospital in the stricken region. A fourth was
diverted from training exercises in Papua New Guinea and has begun
making food drops, McLachlan said.
	   The condition of airstrips in the region was unknown and it was
not known if the planes would be able to land.
	   Small aircraft and helicopters are already ferrying some of the
injured to unaffected towns.
	   Queen Elizabeth II sent a message to Papua New Guinea, which is
a member of the Commonwealth, expressing her shock at the deaths.
	   ``She said she was shocked at the tidal wave, and that her
thoughts were with the families of the bereaved and injured,'' said
a Buckingham Palace spokeswoman.

Candidates for Japanese prime minister pledge tax cuts, banking
</HEADLINE>
reform &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The three candidates to succeed Japan's outgoing
prime minister squared off for the first time Sunday, pledging on
live television to cull sick banks and trim taxes in an effort to
stimulate Japan's anemic economy.
	   Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto was forced to resign last week
after his ruling Liberal Democratic Party suffered a surprise
defeat in elections for the upper house of Parliament.
	   The vote was seen as a sign of broad discontent with Japan's
slide into recession earlier this year. All three contenders to
replace Hashimoto reiterated their support Sunday for tax cuts on
corporate and personal incomes as a way to revive economic demand.
	   Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi, head of the LDP's largest faction
and campaign front-runner, indicated that banks overburdened with
unrecoverable loans should not expect the government to pay to save
them.
	   ``It can't be helped,'' he said of the possibility that some
banks would fail. Obuchi, 61, spoke on national broadcaster NHK's
``Sunday Debate'' program.
	   Health Minister Junichiro Koizumi, 56, who declared his
candidacy on Saturday, suggested that weaker banks should be
allowed to collapse, in order to strengthen Japan's distressed
banking sector. Rival candidate Seiroku Kajiyama, 72, a former
chief Cabinet secretary, has also expressed this view.
	   Kajiyama declared he would target an annual growth rate of 3 to
4 percent, while Obuchi pledged to seek growth of 2 to 3 percent,
on TV Asahi's ``Sunday Project'' debate program.
	   Japan's gross domestic product for the fiscal year that ended in
March shrank by 0.7 percent, the first full year of economic
contraction since 1974.
	   The similarity in the trio's policy proposals reflects their
common party affiliation. The LDP's chief is sure to become prime
minister because the party controls the powerful lower house of
Parliament.
	   The ruling party will choose its new president on Friday, and
both houses of parliament are expected to vote the winner of that
contest into office as prime minister by the end of the month.

Progressive Iranian paper to stop daily publication
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ The Iranian newspaper Farda will stop daily
publication this week because of financial problems, the official
Islamic Republic News Agency reported Sunday.
	   IRNA said, however, that the editorial staff will try to keep
the paper alive as a weekly.
	   Farda, which means ``Tomorrow,'' ran into financial problems
because it did not accept advertising, fearing this would affect
its independent news stance.
	   The paper's editors on Saturday launched a campaign for
donations.
	   ``Help Farda today. Tomorrow will be too late,'' said an article
that used the paper's name in a play on words.
	   Farda was among a number of papers established after moderate
Iranian President Mohammad Khatami took power in August and lifted
restrictions on the press. Its daily circulation was believed to be
about 5,000.

Pro-democracy leader commemorates father's death
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Myanmar's political archrivals _
pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi and the military junta _ both
commemorated the assassination of Suu Kyi's father 51 years ago
Sunday.
	   Dressed in a black sarong, white jacket and black shawl, Suu Kyi
placed three baskets of purple orchids at the tomb of Aung San, who
led Myanmar to independence from Britain, only to be gunned down by
his own countrymen.
	   Aung San is regarded as one of Myanmar's great heroes, a fact
that probably deters the military from taking extreme action
against his daughter.
	   The Nobel Peace Prize winner arrived in a government car. She
was accompanied by Lt. Col. Than Tun, the liaison officer between
the government and Suu Kyi during her house arrest between 1989 and
1995.
	   Suu Kyi's initial appeal to Myanmar's pro-democracy forces
stemmed from her father's reputation. After prolonged residence
abroad, she returned to the country, earlier known as Burma, in
1988, the year hundreds of thousands rose up against military rule.
	   After bloody suppression of the demonstrators, the military
placed Suu Kyi under house arrest and annulled elections won by her
party, but did not imprison her.
	   The official ceremony Sunday began with military buglers
sounding the last post and the laying of a wreath by the government
representative, Minister of Culture Sein Win.
	   The Martyr's Day ceremony is held every year at a mausoleum at
the foot of Yangon's renowned Shwedagon Pagoda. Remembered are Aung
San, six Cabinet ministers and two civil service officials who were
assassinated by gunmen at a Cabinet meeting on July 19, 1947.
	   At a private ceremony, Suu Kyi offered meals to Buddhist monks
at her home. Some 500 people, including diplomats, attended.

Australians face tough task in Tri Nations
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PERTH, Australia (AP) _ Australia faces the tough task of having
to win both of its away games to clinch the Tri Nations rugby union
series after losing 14-13 to South Africa on Saturday.
	   A week after stunning nemesis New Zealand with a 24-16 win in
the series opener in Melbourne, the Wallabies fell to the
Springboks in slippery conditions in a match both coaches agreed
either side deserved to win.
	   Australian coach Rod Macqueen listed several problem areas for
his team, notably ball retention, the lineout and a communication
problem at the back off the scrum where five-eighth Stephen Larkham
is learning the role.
	   The one consolation was the bonus point Australia gained for
losing by seven or fewer points. But the Wallabies must now fly to
Christchurch and Johannesburg endeavoring to do what they have
never done before _ win a Tri Nations test away from home.
	   While the mistake-riddled Test was not the spectacle rugby
officials wanted to put on for a Subiaco Oval crowd of 38,079 at
the first union test held in Perth, it was at least exciting with
the lead changing hands five times and Australia mounting a
desperate assault on the South African line in the final three
minutes.
	   Goal kicking proved the difference, with Australia scoring two
tries to one. But fullback Matt Burke, the hero last week, only
managed one goal from five attempts and missed a potential winner
from almost straight in front, while South Africa's Percy
Montgomery landed three from four.
	   ``We are a much better team than that, we showed it in
patches,'' Australian coach Rod Macqueen said.
	   ``We probably did the hard things well and the easy things
badly. We just can't make that many mistakes and expect to win test
matches.''
	   South African coach Nick Mallett, who took his record to 10 wins
out of 10 tests in charge, was also not entirely happy with the
Springbok performance. But he said the Tri Nations was such a tight
contest, he would take any win, especially away from home, no
matter how it was executed.
	   ``It wasn't a convincing win, we'd be fooling ourselves if we
thought that,'' Mallett said.
	   ``It was a test match where the guys were nervous to lose as
opposed to going out there to win it.''
	   The Springboks play New Zealand in Wellington next Saturday.
	   The Wallabies have a few days off now before regrouping at their
camp in Caloundra, Queensland to prepare for their next Tri Nations
test against New Zealand in Christchurch on Aug. 1. (djp)

	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ More than 100,000 Cambodians
overcame fear of grenades and guns Sunday and watched massive,
festive parades and rallies marking the final week of a
violence-marred campaign for parliamentary elections.
	   The vote July 26 is aimed at putting to rest political divisions
festering since strongman Hun Sen toppled his co-prime minister,
Prince Norodom Ranariddh, in a coup a year ago. But though Hun Sen
has been accused of using murder, fear and vote-rigging to ensure
victory, a clear-cut result may prove elusive and Cambodia risks
another round of turmoil.
	   Ranariddh told an emotional rally of about 5,000 people in the
capital's Olympic Stadium that the election represented a choice
between ``a dictatorial military regime and liberal democracy. If
we don't make a careful decision, Cambodia will never see
liberty.''
	   Stores around the stadium were closed after news swept the city
that the country's main political parties would hold rallies or
marches Sunday, raising the danger of clashes with each other or
the Hun Sen-controlled military and police.
	   In the end, a promised motorcade of hundreds of truckloads of
supporters of Hun Sen's formerly communist Cambodian People's Party
was canceled and the police presence was minimal, an apparent
attempt to soothe the populace's jittery nerves.
	   Apart from the stadium area, most businesses were open. Tens of
thousands of onlookers packed sidewalks and balconies to watch
motorcades of party supporters file by, waving flags and chanting
slogans. Even guards at the grim French colonial-era prison came
out to watch.
	   Saturday night, Chea Sophara, the deputy municipal governor,
gave a televised statement calling rumors of violence
``psychological warfare'' to disrupt the election and raise the
price of goods. Nervous residents have stocked up on rice, cooking
oil and other essentials in the past week.
	   The party led by prominent dissident Sam Rainsy, the third major
force in the election, ran a colorful motorcade of some 50 trucks
and hundreds of motorcycles through the capital, past the royal
palace, the market, the stadium and on into the countryside.
Supporters beat drums and honked horns to the rhythm of ``Chai-yo,
Sam Rainsy,'' or ``Long live Sam Rainsy.''
	   Before setting out, they stopped near the National Assembly and
laid a fresh wreath at the park where at least 16 people were
killed and more than 100 injured March 30, 1997, when four grenades
were hurled into a rally Sam Rainsy was leading. The attack was
widely blamed on Hun Sen. Sam Rainsy escaped with slight injuries.
	   Hun Sen was recuperating Sunday in a hospital from an emergency
appendectomy performed Friday following a rare campaign appearance.
An aide, Prak Sokhon, said the Cambodian leader was able to get out
of bed on his own and walk a little bit.
	   Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy have accused Hun Sen and his party of
intimidating voters with threats and of being unlikely to transfer
power if he loses. Hun Sen says he will if the elections are free
and fair, though most irregularities have been attributed to his
party.
	   U.N. human rights monitors investigating political violence
issued a weekly report Sunday saying that one killing, two
attempted killings and about 50 other credible allegations of
election-related violence and intimidation had been brought to
their attention July 10-17.
	   That period does not include the subsequent killings of three
ethnic Vietnamese villagers by unknown gunmen, which police said
appeared to be political, nor an ambush by Khmer Rouge guerrillas
on an election convoy in northern Cambodia reported Saturday.
	   Diehard elements of the greatly diminished rebel group have
vowed to disrupt the elections. The convoy was taking voting
materials and election officials to a site where guerrillas who
have defected to the government are preparing to vote in their
first election.
	   Hun Sen is favored to win, since his supporters control the
electoral machinery and the military, but large crowds drawn by
Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy show they have significant support.
	   Hun Sen, who came to power in 1985 under the Vietnamese military
occupation that succeeded the genocidal Khmer Rouge regime, was
also favored to win a U.N.-organized vote in 1993. But Ranariddh,
the son of popular King Norodom Sihanouk, and his royalist party
finished first. Hun Sen forced his way into a co-premiership by
threatening civil war.

Burke goes from one extreme to the other
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PERTH, Australia (AP) _ Being a team's goal kicker is often
risky business, as Australian rugby union Matt Burke can attest.
	   ``From the penthouse to the you-know-what house,'' was the way
Burke explained it after Australia's 14-13 loss to South Africa in
their Tri Nations test Saturday.
	   Burke landed only one goal from five attempts, missing an easy
penalty kick which could have won the match with the Wallabies
14-13 down 15 minutes from full time.
	   Only seven days earlier, Burke was hailed a hero when he scored
all of Australia's points in its 24-16 win over New Zealand in
Melbourne.
	   When Springbok hooker James Dalton infringed in a ruck 24 meters
out and directly in front of the goalposts on Saturday, Burke
stepped up and the huge South African contingent among the 38,079
at Subiaco Oval expected to see the game slip by.
	   ``I hit everything pretty well all night, it came off quite
sweetly, just a bit to the right,'' Burke said of the kick. ``The
radar was just a bit to the right.''
	   ``It brings you back to reality I suppose, you can take some of
the blame for missing kicks and that sort of stuff but the
performance from both teams wasn't that great and it wasn't a great
spectacle.''
	   Burke leveled the scores at 8-8 on halftime with a booming
penalty from 52 meters.
	   That was his only success, with goal kicking proving the
difference as South Africa answered Australia's two tries to one
with three penalties from four attempts to fullback Percy
Montgomery.
	   The Wallabies pushed hard at the Springbok line in the last
three minutes, but couldn't breach the tight defense, although
Burke suggested a penalty or two could have gone Australia's way.
	   He acknowledged in hindsight they should have taken a shot at
field goal when they had a scrum set right under the posts in the
final minute, instead of continuing to press forward through the
forwards.
	   ``We were going hard at the end there and a few things went
unnoticed, but that's the game,'' he said.
	   ``We were going for a try and doing a pretty good job about it
but in hindsight watching it we probably should have gone for the
field goal.'' (djp)

Two police wounded in blasts at telephone exchange
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Two explosions ripped through a
cellular telephone exchange in western Sri Lanka Sunday, wounding
two policemen, a police official said.
	   The first explosion damaged the transmission tower of the
private cellular operator in Nittambuwa, a town 35 kilometers (22
miles) northeast of Colombo, the Sri Lankan capital, said the
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   Police arrived to investigate, he said, and a subsequent blast
wounded two officers, he added.
	   Almost two dozen explosions have hit telephone exchanges
throughout this Indian Ocean island nation since April. Police have
yet to learn who is responsible, but the official did not rule out
possible involvement of Tamil Tiger rebels.
	   The rebels are fighting for a separate homeland for minority
Tamils, claiming that the majority Sinhalese, who control the
government and military, discriminate against them. More than
54,000 people have been killed in the fighting since 1983.

Hanson forced to cancel appearance after demonstration
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ A planned speech by One Nation
leader Pauline Hanson was canceled Sunday after only a handful of
supporters braved hundreds of protesters.
	   Streets around Hawthorne Town Hall in eastern Melbourne were
blocked and the building was ringed by barricades as about 1,500
noisy demonstrators awaited Hanson's arrival for the meeting. Riot
police were also on standby.
	   But an hour before the right-wing legislator was due to begin
her address, only 22 of the 800 invited guests had turned up and
Hanson canceled her appearance.

Swans victory hollow as captain lost to injury
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Sydney's hopes for an Australian
Football League title were dealt a blow Sunday when captain Paul
Kelly suffered knee ligament damage in the Swans' Australian Rules
football win.
	   With spearhead Tony Lockett at his best in kicking 12 goals, the
Swans' 18.10 (118) to 12.12 (84) win over Port Adelaide should have
been cause for celebration.
	   But Sydney coach Rodney Eade confirmed after the match that
Kelly was almost certainly out for the rest of the year.
	   ``It looks like it's probably the worst, it's probably a
cruciate,'' Eade said. ``We'll probably find out tomorrow, so it'll
be a reconstruction.''
	   In other matches Sunday, North Melbourne beat the West Coast
Eagles 13.16 (94) to 11.14 (80) and Essendon defeated Richmond
14.10 (94) to 10.15 (75).
	   On Saturday, Melbourne scored a 23-point win over Fremantle,
16.10 (106) to 13.5 (83).
	   The Western Bulldogs kicked 11.2 to 1.1 in the opening quarter
en route to a 91-point win over Brisbane, beating the Bears 27.15
(177) to 13.8 (86). St. Kilda put an end to Geelong's post-season
hopes with a 15.10 (100) to 10.16 (76) win over the Cats.
	   Collingwood kept its season alive while virtually consigning
Hawthorn to last place in the league after thrashing the Hawks by
86 points. In front of nearly 40,000 fans, the Magpies produced one
of their best performances in what has been a difficult season,
winning 19.10 (124) to 4.14 (38).
	   On Friday, Carlton made up a 25-point quarter-time deficit to
beat Adelaide by four points. The winners booted 15 goals after the
first break to win 16.9.(105) to 16.5.(101). (djp)

Iranian wrestlers to compete in Goodwill Games in New York
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iranian wrestlers will compete in the
Goodwill Games that open Sunday in New York, Iran's official
Islamic Republic News Agency reported Sunday.
	   Media reports had said earlier that Iran would boycott the
games. But the Iranian Wrestling Federation said not participating
would harm the country's standing in the wrestling world, the daily
Iran News reported Sunday.
	   IRNA said that in addition to the Goodwill Games in New York
City, the wrestlers also will participate in international youth
free-style competition in Nevada starting Aug. 6.
	   They are the latest in a series of athletic exchanges that have
followed the election of Mohammad Khatami, a moderate, as Iran's
president.
	   Khatami, who took office in August, has called for greater
cultural exchanges between between Iran and the United States as a
way of improving relations.
	   In February, a team of American wrestlers came to Tehran for a
tournament. In April, Iranians wrestled in a tournament in
Oklahoma.
	   That team, however, faced problems on arrival in the United
States, where the players were photographed and fingerprinted by
immigration authorities on arrival at Chicago.
	   The State Department said federal law requires such procedures
for visitors from countries that are not on friendly terms with the
United States.
	   The two countries met in the recently concluded World Cup
competition in France, with Iran defeating the United States 2-0.
	   Relations between the two countries were broken in 1979 after
Iranian militants stormed the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and took
Americans hostage.

Singapore starts rationing exercise to underscore water scarcity
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore, which imports most of its water from
abroad, briefly cut supplies to thousands of households Sunday,
rehearsing for rationing even though there is no immediate shortage
or drought.
	   The shutoff of supplies to 30,000 residences across the island
republic for several hours was part of the annual Save Water
Campaign, one of a plethora of government-organized drives in this
regimented society.
	   Adding an element of surprise, affected households were not
informed before the cut. Unlike in past campaigns, there were no
trucks distributing water to those homes.
	   ``The purpose is to get Singaporeans to conserve water, which is
a precious and strategic resource,'' Minister of Trade and Industry
Lee Yock Suan said last month at the launch of the drive.
	   Singapore's water resources are so limited that it is forced to
import most of its water from Malaysia, and the often strained
relations between the neighbors have elevated the water issue to a
national concern here.
	   Roughly half of the 1.2 million cubic meters (42 million cubic
feet) consumed here each day comes from Malaysia, under one treaty
that expires in 2011 and another in 2061. The two countries have
been unable to negotiate new pacts.
	   The government already has announced that water rates will rise
annually from this year through 2000, just as the Asian economic
crisis is pinching family finances.
	   On Friday, the government-run Public Utilities Board added a
warning that ``unconventional schemes'' such as desalination and
rainfall collection will raise the price of water.
	   In May, Singapore announced that it was working on plans to
build two seawater desalination plants by 2011 in addition to one
already under construction, to replace the water supplied by its
northern neighbor.
	   Desalination would provide a controlled but expensive source of
water for the country.
	   This year's Save Water Campaign also includes lectures, seminars
and various high-profile media publicity. File Stored As: TXS9710

Police: attempted car bombing fails

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ What police said was a car bomb failed to
detonate in downtown Jerusalem Sunday, averting what the police
chief called a ``terrible tragedy.''
	   Police and soldiers blocked off a large section of downtown to
search for any other suspicious objects.
	   Jerusalem police chief Yair Yitzhaki told reporters that a van
driven by a Palestinian caught fire and a passer-by quickly called
police, who discovered explosive materials inside.
	   He refused to specify what the materials were, but described the
quantity as ``very large.''
	   ``It has been definitely established that it was a car bomb,''
he said.
	   Israel radio said components for detonating a bomb were found,
but police did not confirm that. Bomb-squad police were seen
removing two gas tanks and cans of an unidentified fluid from the
van after the fire was put out.
	   Yitzhaki said the fire may have broken out as the driver was
attempting to detonate the materials.
	   ``A terrible tragedy was averted,'' he said.
	   Police said the driver was hospitalized with serious burns,
under heavy guard. He was not conscious and thus could not be
questioned, Yitzhaki told reporters.
	   There was no immediate word on any other arrests.
	   A half-mile (kilometer) of Jerusalem's main downtown
thoroughfare and part of a downtown pedestrian mall were closed to
foot and car traffic for more than three hours, and scores of
stores and restaurants were ordered to close. Sunday is a regular
business day in Israel.

Iranian wrestlers to compete in Goodwill Games in New York
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iranian wrestlers are to compete in the
Goodwill Games in New York, Iran's official Islamic Republic News
Agency reported Sunday.
	   Media reports had said earlier that Iran would boycott the
games. But the Iranian Wrestling Federation said not participating
would harm the country's standing in the wrestling world, the daily
Iran News reported.
	   IRNA said that in addition to the Goodwill Games, which were to
open Sunday, the wrestlers also will participate in an
international youth free-style competition in Nevada, starting Aug.
6.
	   The events are the latest in a series of athletic exchanges that
have followed the election of Mohammad Khatami, a moderate, as
Iran's president.
	   Khatami, who took office in August, has called for greater
cultural exchanges between Iran and the United States as a way of
improving their often bitter relations.
	   In February, a team of American wrestlers competed in a
tournament in Tehran. In April, Iranians wrestled in a tournament
in Oklahoma.
	   That Iranian team, however, faced problems upon arrival in the
United States, where the players were photographed and
fingerprinted by immigration authorities.
	   The U.S. State Department said federal law requires such
procedures for visitors from countries that are not on friendly
terms with the United States.
	   The two countries met in the World Cup competition in France,
with Iran defeating the United States 2-0.
	   Relations between the two countries were ruptured in 1979 after
Iranian militants stormed the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and took
Americans hostage.

Aftershocks jolt southern Taiwan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ An earthquake with a preliminary magnitude
of 4.8 jolted southern Taiwan Sunday in the biggest of 570
aftershocks following a major quake that killed five people two
days earlier.
	   The latest quake, at 1:02 a.m. (1702 GMT Saturday), was centered
12 kilometers (7.2 miles) west of Alishan, a mountainous region
about 300 kilometers (180 miles) south of Taipei, the Central
Weather Bureau said.
	   The China Times Express said the tremor opened new crevices in
highways, stranding dozens of people in a village near the town of
Rweili, the area hardest hit by the 6.2 magnitude quake on Friday.
	   Firemen also suspected the latest tremor was the cause of a
short circuit that started a fire at a bicycle factory in nearby
Nantou County. The fire destroyed the factory and a warehouse
stocked with spare parts, they said.
	   Friday's quake caused rock slides in Alishan. Its casualties
also included 27 injured.
	   Hundreds of people who had been stranded on the mountain were
evacuated by Saturday as rocks were removed and highways cleared.
	   Geologists blamed the severe damage on excessive development of
the region with agriculture and road construction.
	   The government said 22 school buildings suffered damage, some
seriously, in Chiayi County, where Alishan is located.
	   Of all the aftershocks, only 17 were felt. But weathermen warned
that the frequent tremors could precede another major earthquake.
	   Unrelated to the quakes in southern Taiwan, two other tremors,
with magnitudes of 4.3 and 4.4, struck eastern Hualien, 180
kilometers (108 miles) south of Taipei, on Sunday, weathermen said.
	   An earthquake's magnitude is a measure of the total energy
released, as indicated by ground motion recorded on seismographs.
An increase of one digit in the scale represents a tenfold increase
in the strength of the quake.
	   An earthquake with a magnitude of 6 can cause severe damage in a
populated area.

Police: attempted car bombing fails

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ What police said was a car bomb failed to
detonate in downtown Jerusalem Sunday, averting what the police
chief called a ``terrible tragedy.''
	   Police and soldiers blocked off a large section of downtown to
search for any other suspicious objects.
	   Jerusalem police chief Yair Yitzhaki told reporters that a van
driven by a Palestinian caught fire and a passer-by quickly called
police, who discovered explosive materials inside.
	   He refused to specify what the materials were, but described the
quantity as ``very large.''
	   ``It has been definitely established that it was a car bomb,''
he said.
	   Israel radio said components for detonating a bomb were found,
but police did not confirm that. Bomb-squad police were seen
removing two gas tanks and cans of an unidentified fluid from the
van after the fire was put out.
	   Yitzhaki said the fire may have broken out as the driver was
attempting to detonate the materials.
	   ``A terrible tragedy was averted,'' he said.
	   Police said the driver was hospitalized with serious burns,
under heavy guard. He was not conscious and thus could not be
questioned, Yitzhaki told reporters.
	   There was no immediate word on any other arrests.
	   A half-mile (kilometer) of Jerusalem's main downtown
thoroughfare and part of a downtown pedestrian mall were closed to
foot and car traffic for more than three hours, and scores of
stores and restaurants were ordered to close. Sunday is a regular
business day in Israel.

Rats still rampant at new Malaysian airport
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Eateries at Malaysia's new
multimillion-dollar airport have been urged to keep their garbage
cans closed to help exterminators sweep the site of 600 rats, news
reports said Sunday.
	   Reports of rats scurrying around the dlrs 2.3 billion Kuala
Lumpur International Airport surfaced last week after a flight was
delayed 15 hours because a rat was discovered on board.
	   Transport Minister Ling Liong Sik said exterminators already had
caught 291 of the rodents but estimated that 600 remained, the Star
newspaper reported.
	   An hour's drive from downtown Kuala Lumpur, the sleek new
airport sprawls across 10,000 hectares (24,700 acres) of former
palm oil plantations, which Ling said were riddled with rat
burrows.
	   The minister said exterminators were trying not only to rid the
facility of rodents but to trace them back to their breeding
grounds.
	   In the meantime, Ling asked that airport food outlets cooperate
by keeping a lid on garbage and cutting off food supplies to the
pests.
	   Rats are the latest in a string of troubles that have gripped
the KLIA since it opened last month. Most computer-related
problems, including lost baggage and flight delays, have begun to
ease.
	   Opposition leader Lim Kit Siang questioned Sunday how the rats
had found their way into the airport.
	   ``It's no use talking about KLIA being a high-tech yet passenger
friendly airport when some 600 rats are running all over the
airport,'' he said in a statement.

Chinese police bust child kidnapping rings
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Police in southern China have broken up three
criminal gangs that had kidnapped 27 children, mostly boys intended
for sale to couples wanting sons, a newspaper reported Sunday.
	   Police in coastal Fujian and Guangdong provinces arrested 45
suspects in connection with the gangs, the Legal Daily reported.
	   The suspects and children were turned over to authorities in
central Guizhou province, the landlocked and poverty-stricken
central region where the children were kidnapped, the paper said.
	   China's policy of allowing most couples to bear just one child
has put a premium on male offspring, traditionally prized for
carrying on the family name and paying respects to deceased
ancestors.

Not kosher: religious rules to dampen Israel's millennium bash
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DINA KRAFT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ It may be the biggest party night on Earth, but
in Jerusalem, religious rules are likely to put a damper on
celebrations ushering in the new millennium.
	   That's because Dec. 31, 1999, falls on the Jewish sabbath, and
rabbis will be closely watching to make sure non-religious
observances don't mar the biblically mandated day of rest.
	   Hotels and reception halls will be able to hold low-key dinners.
But they would risk losing their kosher licenses _ their economic
lifeblood _ if they permitted music and dancing or put on
boisterous bashes to mark the millennium.
	   Israel's tourism industry is gloomily accepting the reality that
it's likely to miss out on a lot of business.
	   ``All I can do is be frustrated,'' said Jonathan Harpaz,
director of the Jerusalem Hotels Association. ``We are in dire
straits.''
	   Tiki Mula, a spokeswoman for the Ramada Renaissance Hotel, said,
``No hotel in Jerusalem will celebrate the New Year, even if it is
the year 2000.''
	   Some 5 million visitors are expected in Israel during the
millennium year _ more than twice the annual average _ with the
crowds to peak during the Christmas-New Year's season leading into
2000.
	   So many are expected that Jerusalem's mayor has suggested tent
cities may be needed to house tourists and Christian pilgrims.
	   Many visitors will likely be Christians pilgrims seeking to
renew their faith in the Holy Land, and Rabbi Shmuel Borstein, who
supervises the issuing of kosher licenses in Jerusalem, said he
doesn't expect religious restrictions to keep them away.
	   ``I don't think that their not being allowed to have a party
would prevent them from visiting on the 2,000th anniversary of
Jesus' birth,'' Borstein said.
	   Observant Jews don't celebrate New Year's Eve since it marks the
beginning of the Christian year, not the Jewish one.
	   In recent years, secular Israelis have taken to ringing in Jan.
1 with the rest of the world at clubs and private parties.
	   But most hotels and restaurants have a kosher license and would
not risk losing it by playing host to a New Year's Eve bash.
Without the license, they can't stage weddings and two Jewish rites
of passage _ bar mitzvahs and brit milas _ that provide steady
income throughout the year.
	   Many in the tourism industry are already scrambling to find
alternative sites for millennium parties, including Israeli
communal farms, which are usually secular in outlook.
	   David Dassa, whose travel agency caters mostly to Christian
tourists, said he complained to Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert about
the restrictions but hadn't received a response.
	   A spokeswoman for the Jerusalem municipality, Johanne Malka,
said she was not aware of any requests from tour operators, but
said the city did not have a budget for throwing a party for
visitors.
	   Next door in the Palestinian lands, hoteliers and restaurateurs
are eager to take up the slack.
	   ``If this happens, we will expect huge amounts of people, and we
will use our facilities to absorb any visitors,'' said Nabil
Kassis, who is directing millennium festivities in Jesus'
birthplace, the West Bank town of Bethlehem just south of
Jerusalem.
	   Visitors to Palestinian areas might face another religious
complication, this one on the Muslim side. New Year's Eve 1999 will
come during the Islamic fasting month of Ramadan, when observant
Muslims do not eat from sunrise to sunset.
	   Kassis said, however, that the Palestinian Authority would make
allowances for hungry tourists.

Japan's top communist makes breakthrough visit to China
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Ending a 30-year freeze in relations between
their parties, the chairman of the Japanese Communist Party arrived
in Beijing Sunday for talks with President Jiang Zemin, China's
Communist Party leader.
	   Tetsuzo Fuwa's four-day visit marks a watershed in relations
between the two parties that could be significant if Japan's
Communists are able to capitalize on recent gains at the polls.
	   Fuwa will reportedly discuss future exchanges between the
parties and details of the Japan-U.S. defense cooperation agreement
updated last year. China has strongly criticized new cooperation
guidelines as directed at a perceived security threat stemming from
its increased influence in the region.
	   Relations between the two parties were severed in 1967 after the
Chinese Communist Party condemned the JCP for refusing to accept
the primacy of Mao Tse-tung's interpretation of communist ideology.
	   Ties were normalized last month when a JCP delegation visited
Beijing.
	   The 76-year-old Japanese Communist Party added nine new seats in
recent elections for half the seats in the 252-seat upper house of
Parliament, leapfrogging two other parties to become the
second-largest opposition force.
	   That victory adds to the party's already strong position in
regional politics, where it holds more local assembly seats than
any other party.

Rushdie death sentence proves contentious issue in talks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Senior EU officials on a fence-mending visit
were to meet Sunday with Iran's foreign minister following talks a
day earlier in which Iran's death sentence on Salman Rushdie proved
a still-contentious issue.
	   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency said that six hours
of talks on Saturday between the visiting Europeans and an Iranian
delegation indicated wide differences over the British writer.
	   It quoted Morteza Sarmadi, the deputy foreign minister for
Euro-American affairs, as saying the Europeans asked Iran ``to
distance itself from the award set for Rushdie.''
	   In return, Sarmadi argued that the West must revise its notion
of free speech, the agency reported.
	   Sarmadi also put forth Iran's views on human rights and
terrorism, IRNA said, without reporting what was said by either
side.
	   Iran has refused to revoke its 1989 death sentence against
Rushdie, an Indian-born British writer, saying he must be killed
for insulting Islam in his novel ``The Satanic Verses.''
	   An official Iranian foundation has offered a bounty of more than
dlrs 2 million for Rushdie, forcing the author to live in hiding
and under armed protection.
	   The European Union delegation, led by Albert Rohan,
secretary-general of the Austrian Foreign Ministry, was to meet
with Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi for further talks
Sunday, ministry officials said.
	   The visiting team includes foreign ministry officials from
Britain, Austria and Germany and represents the past, present and
future holders of the EU's rotating presidency.
	   The talks are intended to formulate topics for future talks
between the EU and Iran, IRNA said.
	   The EU broke off five years of ``critical dialogue'' with Iran
last year following allegations by a German court that Iranian
leaders ordered the killings of Kurdish-Iranian dissidents in
Berlin.
	   The EU has indicated it is keen to normalize ties following the
May 1997 election of President Mohammad Khatami, a moderate cleric
who has been trying to temper Iran's hard-line foreign and domestic
policies.
	   In Saturday's talks, the two sides also discussed economic
cooperation, drug trafficking and ways to resolve regional
conflicts in Afghanistan, Central Asia, Caspian Sea, the Gulf and
the Balkans, IRNA said.
	   Iranian newspapers said Tehran expected the talks to go beyond
the usual Western concerns about Iran's human rights record and
allegations that Tehran was sponsoring international terrorism and
seeking nuclear weapons.
	   ``The two sides have realized that expansion of economic and
political ties are beneficial to both,'' the English-language Iran
News said Sunday. The daily is close to the Foreign Ministry.
	   Part of the EU drive for better ties stems from business
prospects in oil and gas in Iran, where U.S. companies are banned
from working under sanctions imposed by Washington.
	   A U.S. law also threatens to punish non-U.S. companies that
invest more than dlrs 20 million annually in Iran's oil and gas
sectors. European countries have criticized the law and said they
would not abide by it.
	   Earlier this month, Iran whetted European business appetites
further by seeking financial backing for oil ventures worth dlrs 8
billion.

Power wins Australian Open title
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ADELAIDE, Australia (AP) _ Jonathon Power of Canada became the
first overseas player in 16 years to win the Australian Open men's
squash title when he beat Australian Anthony Hill in the final
Sunday.
	   Power, ranked No. 3 in the world and the tournament's top seed,
was relatively untroubled in beating Hill 15-10, 15-8, 15-8.
	   Hill, ranked No. 9 in the world, had caused a major upset in
getting to the final, beating world champion and defending
Australian Open champion Rodney Eyles in four games on Saturday.
	   The last international winner of the Open was legendary
Pakistani Jahangir Khan (1982), who won the world title five times
after winning the Australian Open and once before it.
	   ``If I do something remotely similar to what he's done in squash
I'll live a happy life,'' Power said.
	   Power, playing his first tournament since December after an
ankle injury sidelined him in January, will now travel to Brisbane
for a week of specialist coaching from former world champion Rodney
Martin.
	   In the South Australian women's open held in conjunction with
the men's event, Australia's Michelle Martin easily beat
countrywoman Carol Owens 9-5, 9-1, 9-2. (djp)

Akebono spoils Takanohana's bid for perfect record
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAGOYA, Japan (AP) _ Takanohana received the champion's trophy
but Akebono gained satisfaction Sunday, spoiling his fellow
yokozuna's (grand champion's) bid for a perfect record in the
Nagoya Grand Sumo Tournament.
	   Takanohana already had clinched his 19th tournament title on
Saturday, when he beat his closest rival, Hawaiian-born ozeki
(champion) Musasahimaru. On Sunday, he was trying for his fifth
perfect tournament.
	   But Akebono, or Chad Rowan from Hawaii, charged him with hand
thrusts, grabbed his belt, bulldozed him to the ring's edge and
crushed him out.
	   Takanohana finished at 14-1, and received the top prize of 10
million yen (dlrs 71,000). Akebono ended at 11-4.
	   It was Takanohana's first title since he won in the Autumn Grand
Sumo Tournament last September.
	   ``I had thought of retiring because I couldn't get good results
even if I made efforts,'' said Takanohana of his problems in the
three previous tournaments.
	   With four defeats after 12 days, he dropped out of the January
tournament because of a severe cold and fever and a liver ailment.
	   In the March tournament, liver trouble forced him out again
after he had suffered three defeats in four days.
	   In the May tournament, he ended at 10-5.
	   Musashimaru, or Fiamalu Penitani, ended this tournament at 12-3
by sending out Wakanohana, Takanohana's elder brother, with a
series of hand thrusts. Newly promoted Wakanohana, in his first
tournament as a yokozuna, finished at 10-5.
	   New sekiwake (junior champion) Chiyotaikai tossed down ozeki
Takanonami and received his second technique prize of 2 million yen
(dlrs 14,000) for an 11-4 record, including victories over
Wakanohana and Musashimaru. Takanonami finished at 9-6.
	   No. 9 maegashira Kotonowaka received his third Fighting Spirit
Award of 2 million yen for an 11-4 record, although he lost the
final day's bout to No. 1 maegashira Takatoriki (10-5) by an arm
throw.
	   No. 4 maegashira Dejima pushed out No. 10 maegashira Minatofuji
(9-6) and won his second Outstanding Performance Award of 2 million
yen for a 10-5 record, including victories over yokozunas Akebono
and Wakanohana and ozeki Takanonami.
	   No. 13 maegashira Mitoizumi clamped No. 11 maegashira
Kyokushuzan's arms from outside and sent him out for his eighth
victory against seven defeats.
	   Kyokushuzan, or Mongolian Batbayar Davaa, ended at 9-6.
	   No. 15 maegashira Kyokutenho, or Mongolian Tsevegnyam Nyamjav,
sent out No. 7 maegashira Wakanojo, leaving both at 4-11.
	   Because of his present low ranking, Kyokutenho may be demoted to
the 26-member juryo division, just below the senior makuuchi
division, before the next tournament, starting Sept. 13 in Tokyo.
	   No foreign wrestlers in junior divisions had bouts Sunday.
	   No. 2-ranked Hoshitango, or Argentine Imach Marcelo Salomon, who
finished at 6-1 in makushita, may be promoted to the juryo
division.

Man shot to death in paramilitary `punishment' attack
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Gunmen shot a man to death early Sunday on the
stairs of his Belfast apartment block in what police said appeared
to be a ``punishment'' attack by paramilitaries.
	   The man, who was in his early 30s, was with his mother and
two-week-old daughter in his apartment in the Catholic New Lodge
area when five men burst in soon after midnight, police said.
	   The men disconnected the family's phone, then took the man to an
outside stairwell, where they shot him in both legs, said a police
spokesman, speaking with customary anonymity. The man, who was not
identified, died later of his injuries.
	   Police Supt. Tim McGregor said the attack appeared to be a
paramilitary ``punishment'' shooting. It was not immediately clear
if it was the work of the Irish Republican Army _ which despite its
cease-fire, has continued to inflict ``punishment'' beatings and
shootings on scores of people accused of criminal behavior _ or was
inflicted by members of a splinter republican group.
	   ``The mother was unable to phone for an ambulance and left the
(apartment) block and ran to an adjoining block,'' McGregor said.
``An ambulance was called, but when they got him to the hospital he
was found to be dead on arrival.''
	   ``Had he got medical treatment at the time and if they hadn't
pulled out the phone he might have lived,'' he said.
	   Separately, members of the Orange Order failed to strike a
compromise with residents of a Catholic neighborhood of Portadown
who object to the Orangemen marching throught their area. Talks
between the two sides broke up early Sunday without agreement.
	   Jonathan Powell, a senior aide to Prime Minister Tony Blair,
oversaw the discussions, in which the two sides communicated
through mediators but did not speak directly to each other. Similar
talks broke down after a few hours a week ago.
	   However, go-betweens said the contacts will continue. ``We were
negotiating on a text today. Some progress was made but we were
unable to reach agreement,'' they said in a statement. ``We will
stay in close contact with the parties with the aim of resuming
talks when further progress can be made.''
	   Police and soliders, enforcing an order by the
government-appointed Parades Commission, prevented members of the
Orange Order, Northern Ireland's largest Protestant brotherhood,
from marching down the Garvaghy Road in Portadown, 25 miles (40
kms) southwest of Belfast, on July 5.
	   Orangemen massed on the hillside near a rural church every night
for a week, underlining their determination to follow their
traditional parade route. But the number of protesters fell after
arsonists killed the three young sons of a Catholic woman in the
town of Ballymoney last Sunday in what police said was a sectarian
attack.
	   Police still are questioning seven people in connection with
that attack.

U.N.: Job uncertainty fueling violence, bullying at work
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: EMBARGOED by source until 0001 GMT, Monday July 20. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Increasing job uncertainty worldwide is fueling
violence at work, according to a U.N. report released Monday.
	   Psychological violence, such as group harassment of employees,
is emerging as a major problem, it said.
	   ``Violence at work has become a global concern,'' said Vittorio
Di Martino, co-author of the 165-page International Labor
Organization report.
	   Japan's economic downturn, leading to the loss of lifetime job
security, has led to alleged bullying of workers as ``personal
relationships become more precarious,'' Di Martino said.
	   The report identified France, Argentina, Romania and Canada
among the countries which have reported the highest rates of
assaults and sexual harassment on the job.
	   But it cautioned that the problem's severity is recognized and
documented most in Europe and North America. No general
international definition of violence at work has yet been agreed,
it noted.
	   The response to violence is often ``limited, episodic and
ill-defined,'' although employers end up bearing the costs of lost
work and improved security, as well as risking loss of product
quality and company image.
	   An average of 20 workers are killed every week in the United
States, while some 18,000 are assaulted at work or on duty, the
survey said.
	   In the United States, retail and service industries account for
85 percent of all assaults in the workplace, it said. As elsewhere,
taxi drivers ran the highest risk of assault.
	   Psychological violence can also have dire effects, the report
said.
	   In Sweden, mobbing of employees, also reported in the United
States and Britain, was estimated to be a factor in 10 to 15
percent of suicides.
	   The ``Violence At Work'' report compiled information from a
range of national and international surveys.

Sri Lankan, 2 Iranians executed for crimes in Kuwait
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ Two Iranian men were hanged in Kuwait on Sunday,
the first executions ever for drug smuggling in this small Gulf
state, a Kuwaiti official said.
	   A third man, a Sri Lankan identified as Yassin Bawa
Abdul-Ghafour, was executed for murdering his lover, said the
Interior Ministry official, who spoke on customary condition of
anonymity.
	   The hangings were carried out at the Central Prison, the
official said.
	   He identified the Iranians as Abbas Bouriaimi and Hanash
Salmeen. The two were arrested in 1996 on a boat with 58 kilograms
(128 pounds) of hashish, 849 grams (30 ounces) of opium and about
one kilogram (2 pounds) of heroin.
	   They were found guilty of smuggling drugs under a law amended by
Parliament in 1995 to introduce capital punishment for drug
trafficking. The law aims to curb rising drug abuse.
	   Abdul-Ghafour was found guilty of murdering his Sri Lankan lover
in 1996 by smashing her head with a rock in the desert.
	   In May, three Kuwaiti men convicted of murder, robbery and
kidnapping were hanged.

U.N. envoy holds talks in East Timor despite security fears
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with meetings over; ADDS new quotes, comments
throughout &QL; 
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER TORCHIA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAUCAU, Indonesia (AP) _ The search for peace in troubled East
Timor gathered pace Sunday when a U.N. mediator flew into the
territory and held talks with military, local government and church
officials despite security fears.
	   Jamsheed Marker, the U.N. special envoy on East Timor, arrived
in East Timor's second largest town of Baucau on an Indonesian
military C-130 plane from the tourist island of Bali after earlier
talks in Jakarta, Indonesia's capital.
	   ``There are many obstacles. This is a longstanding problem that
has gone on for years. There is a lot of bitterness,'' Marker said
after meeting local military commanders, East Timor's two Roman
Catholic bishops, the provincial governor and former separatist
guerrillas for several hours.
	   ``But regardless of the shade of opinion, there is a desire for
a peaceful settlement as early as possible.
	   ``All the parties are eager for a solution and for the United
Nations to play a significant role,'' Marker said.
	   There was no sign Sunday of the protests that have marred recent
visits by other foreign officials to East Timor, about 2,000
kilometers (1,200 miles) east of Jakarta.
	   Marker is trying to broker a peace deal for East Timor, ruled by
Portugal for hundreds of years before Indonesia sent in troops and
annexed the territory in 1976.
	   Emerging from his meeting, Marker appealed for calm and
continuing dialogue between former enemies.
	   ``You don't have to break a man's head in order to convince him
you are right. The time for slogans is over,'' he said.
	   After talks with Indonesian President B.J. Habibie on Saturday,
Marker said he was ``very optimistic'' that peace can be negotiated
for the half-island territory.
	   On Sunday, Marker said U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan would
convene talks between the foreign ministers of Indonesia and
Portugal in New York on Aug. 4 and 5.
	   ``A lot of what I learned today will be the basis for
ministerial talks in New York,'' he said.
	   Indonesia invaded East Timor in 1975, but many of the
territory's 800,000 inhabitants fervently wish for a vote on
independence and deeply resent Indonesian control.
	   The territory has endured guerrilla warfare and human rights
abuses for more than two decades.
	   Marker made his visit despite fears by the Indonesian government
and East Timor's 1996 Nobel Peace Prize winner, Roman Catholic
Bishop Carlos Belo, that his presence could trigger violent
protests by groups supporting or opposing Indonesian rule.
	   Since last month, Indonesian soldiers have killed two
pro-independence protesters. Two demonstrators were shot and killed
during Marker's last visit to East Timor in 1997.
	   More than 100 riot police staged a brief exercise around the
local government building in Dili on Sunday.
	   After the meeting with Marker, Belo said he was pleased that
Marker had come after all.
	   ``This is a miracle,'' Belo said, referring to the wide range of
people who met the U.N. envoy peacefully.
	   Stating that he wants to end the conflict in East Timor, Habibie
has offered to release jailed guerrilla leader Xanana Gusmao and
grant special status to the territory in return for international
recognition of it as an integral part of Indonesia.
	   However, he has refused to bow to demands by separatists for a
referendum on outright independence.
	   Indonesia says East Timor is its 27th province. But the United
Nations, Portugal and many other governments do not recognize the
claim.
	   Marker, who also met Gusmao in a Jakarta prison on Friday,
arrived in Indonesia on Thursday and is due to leave Wednesday.

Rushdie death sentence proves contentious issue in talks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Senior EU officials on a fence-mending visit
were to meet Sunday with Iran's foreign minister, following talks a
day earlier in which the two sides disagreed about Iran's death
sentence on author Salman Rushdie.
	   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency said that six hours
of talks on Saturday between the visiting Europeans and an Iranian
delegation indicated wide differences over the British writer.
	   It quoted Morteza Sarmadi, the deputy foreign minister for
Euro-American affairs, as saying the Europeans asked Iran ``to
distance itself from the award set for Rushdie.''
	   In return, Sarmadi argued that the West must revise its notion
of free speech, the agency reported.
	   Sarmadi also put forth Iran's views on human rights and
terrorism, IRNA said, without reporting what was said by either
side.
	   Iran has refused to revoke its 1989 death sentence against
Rushdie, an Indian-born Briton, saying he must be killed for
insulting Islam in his novel ``The Satanic Verses.''
	   An official Iranian foundation has offered a bounty of more than
dlrs 2 million for Rushdie, forcing the author to live in hiding
and under armed protection.
	   The European Union delegation, led by Albert Rohan,
secretary-general of the Austrian Foreign Ministry, was to meet
with Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi for further talks
Sunday, ministry officials said.
	   The visiting team includes foreign ministry officials from
Britain, Austria and Germany and represents the past, present and
future holders of the EU's rotating presidency.
	   The talks are intended to formulate topics for future talks
between the EU and Iran, IRNA said.
	   The EU broke off five years of ``critical dialogue'' with Iran
last year following allegations by a German court that Iranian
leaders ordered the killings of Kurdish-Iranian dissidents in
Berlin.
	   The EU has indicated it is keen to normalize ties following the
May 1997 election of President Mohammad Khatami, a moderate cleric
who has been trying to temper Iran's hard-line foreign and domestic
policies.
	   In Saturday's talks, the two sides also discussed economic
cooperation, drug trafficking and ways to resolve regional
conflicts in Afghanistan, Central Asia, Caspian Sea, the Gulf and
the Balkans, IRNA said.
	   Iranian newspapers said Tehran expected the talks to go beyond
the usual Western concerns about Iran's human rights record and
allegations that Tehran was sponsoring international terrorism and
seeking nuclear weapons.
	   ``The two sides have realized that expansion of economic and
political ties are beneficial to both,'' the English-language Iran
News said Sunday. The daily is close to the Foreign Ministry.
	   Part of the EU drive for better ties stems from business
prospects in oil and gas in Iran, where U.S. companies are banned
from working under sanctions imposed by Washington.

Singapore loan sharks prowl waters of economic duress
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ For some Singaporeans who owe money, the bite
of Asia's economic slump includes increasing vandalism, harassment
and violence by loan sharks, The Sunday Times reported.
	   The dismal economic climate is compelling an increasing number
of struggling Singaporeans to turn to this illegal and potentially
dangerous alternative source of funds, the paper said.
	   ``In the past, these cases would crop up once in a very long
while and sometimes there'd be none at all,'' lawyer Tan Kok Leong,
who has represented loan sharks, told the paper. ``But I'm seeing
more now, because more people are borrowing from loan sharks to get
quick money. But most are first-time borrowers and they don't know
the consequences.''
	   Splashed across the front page of the country's leading
newspaper was a photograph of a tardy borrower's name and details
prominently spray-painted in the apartment block for hundreds of
neighbors to see.
	   ``I will swing a baton just to scare them, but I won't use it,''
loan shark Xiao Long told the newspaper. ``We just want to scare
them. ... We can't kill them ..., or else we'll never get our money
back.''
	   Regular customers _ such as food stall operators, taxi drivers
and night-club hostesses _ have now been joined by office workers
and salesmen, the money lenders say.
	   The huge interest payments of 20 to 30 percent per week,
combined with the often shrinking wages and investment assets of
those who are forced to seek help from the loan sharks, mean they
are finding it hard or impossible to repay the money.
	   Arrests and court cases against loans sharks are on the rise,
the report said.
	   ``Recently some of my clients told me that they are finding it
harder to get their money back on time, so they resort to
strong-arm tactics,'' the paper quoted lawyer Tan as saying.
	   Current figures on arrests weren't available. Last year, more
than 2,840 cases of illegal money lending were reported, 40 percent
above the 2,024 in 1996.

William, Harry preparing 50th birthday party for their father
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Prince William and Prince Harry have been
preparing a surprise 50th birthday party for their father, Prince
Charles, but are ``very disappointed'' that the news has surfaced
in a tabloid newspaper, a spokeswoman for Charles said Sunday.
	   She declined to confirm a Sunday Mirror report that the event
would be held at Charles' country home, Highgrove, on July 31, and
that the young princes would star in a specially-written comedy
play.
	   The Sunday Mirror said William, 16, and Harry, 13, would appear
with Oscar-winning actress Emma Thompson and comedy actor Stephen
Fry, who have written the script.
	   ''William and Harry have planned a surprise birthday for their
father, and they have worked really hard on it,'' said Charles'
spokeswoman, who spoke with customary anonymity. ''It is sad that
the surprise has now been spoiled.
	   ``The party will go ahead, though it isn't going to be a
surprise any more. I am not going to talk about the details because
it isn't fair to the boys.
	   ``They are very disappointed that it has got out after they kept
it a secret for so long.''
	   The Sunday Mirror said William conceived the idea of a play in
the style of the comedy hit series ``Blackadder'' and his former
nanny, Tiggy Legge-Bourke helped him organize it, the Sunday Mirror
said.
	   The newspaper said the party is scheduled for the end of this
month to fit in with the young princes' school vacations, the royal
family's traditional summer stay at Balmoral in Scotland, and
crowded diaries.
	   Charles turns 50 on Nov. 14.

Senior official of main opposition party to visit China
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Taiwan's main opposition party, which has
advocated independence for the island from China, will allow a
senior member to visit the Chinese mainland later this week, a
party leader said Sunday.
	   Lin Yih-hsiung, chairman-elect of the Democratic Progressive
Party, said Chiu Yih-jen will make the trip as a private citizen
and not in his capacity as the party's secretary-general.
	   Still, Chiu would be the most senior party official to visit
China. He will attend a July 24-25 academic meeting on cross-Strait
relations and Asian economies to be held at Xiamen University in
the southern coastal city.
	   ``Our policy is clear,'' Lin told reporters. ``We want to have
dialogue, interaction and exchanges with China.
	   ``We hope to understand more about China, and also let China
understand more about the wishes of Taiwanese people.''
	   Lin was elected chairman in May and will assume the new job next
month.
	   The planned visit by Chiu, the DPP's top theorist, reflects
growing pragmatism in the party.
	   Since its victory in local elections last year, the DPP has been
more sensitive to public anxiety about its provocative independence
platform. The polls gave the party control over 77 percent of
Taiwan's population on the local level.
	   Most Taiwanese prefer to maintain the island's status quo of de
facto independence to avoid roiling tensions with China.
	   Taiwan's ruling Nationalists fled the communist takeover of the
Chinese mainland after losing a civil war in 1949.
	   Beijing claims sovereignty over Taiwan and has threatened to use
force against the island if it declares independence.
	   But the mainland has become more pragmatic too. In recent
months, Beijing has expressed a wish to increase contacts with all
of Taiwan's political parties, including the DPP.
	   But some DPP politicians are wary that contacts with China could
alienate many of its supporters, who have been antagonized by
Beijing's tough stance and its diplomatic isolation of Taiwan.
	   Taking heed, Chiu said he will drop an earlier plan to visit
Beijing and Shanghai and reiterated that he would not meet any

Chandelier that fell near Estrada went uninspected for decades
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ A chandelier that crashed near
President Joseph Estrada on his first day in office had not been
inspected for nearly a quarter-century and fell by accident, an
official said Sunday.
	   A local company said the chandeliers at Manila's Malacanang
Palace hadn't undergone any safety inspection since it installed
the lights in 1975 at the height of strongman Ferdinand Marcos'
martial law rule, Press Undersecretary Icasiano Gutierrez said.
	   ``It was neither a case of bad luck nor the threat of sabotage
but an accident waiting to happen,'' Gutierrez said in a statement.
	   A government investigation has concluded that the chandelier was
simply too old and brittle and gave in to its weight, he added.
	   Past earthquakes and constant pounding during a military rebel
attack on the palace in the 1980s might have loosened the
chandelier's bolts, he said, adding that an inspection of the
lights is being planned.
	   Estrada, who was sworn into office as the country's 13th
president on June 30, was leaving the presidential palace music
room to induct new members of his Cabinet when the chandelier
dropped to the floor.
	   Estrada ordered his security staff to investigate the case,
which he called ``very suspicious.'' He also asked his spiritual
adviser to sprinkle holy water in the room to ward off bad luck.
	   The superstitious new president jokes about rumors of ghosts in
the palace and tries to avoid being referred to as the country's
13th president because of the bad luck associated with the number.
He said he also was planning a blessing of the rest of the palace
in the near future.

Roger Quilliot, former government minister, Camus specialist, dies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Roger Quilliot, a former French government minister
and specialist in the writings of Albert Camus, has died. He was
73.
	   Quilliot committed suicide Friday at his home in the central
French city of Clermont-Ferrand, where he had served as mayor for
more than 20 years.
	   His wife, Claire, also tried to commit suicide but was
unsuccessful in her attempt and is now in the hospital, the daily
Le Monde reported in its Sunday edition.
	   Quilliot was born in 1925 in Normandy into a family of teachers.
He studied literature in Paris and was named professor at the
University of Clermont-Ferrand in 1963.
	   A specialist in the writings of Albert Camus, Quilliot edited
the author's complete works in the prestigious Pleiade edition.
	   A lifelong socialist, Quilliot became mayor of his adopted city
in 1973. President Francois Mitterrand appointed him Minister of
Urban Affairs in 1981, a post he would hold for two years.
	   Quilliot resigned as mayor of Clermont-Ferrand in 1997. He was
increasingly preoccupied with his declining health and had
contemplated suicide for a long time, Le Monde reported.
	   Funeral plans were not immediately known.

<TEXT>
	   PORT MORESBY, Papua New Guinea (AP) _ A tsunami spawned by a 7.0
magnitude earthquake crashed into Papua New Guinea's north coast,
crushing villages and killing nearly 600 people, officials said
Sunday.
	   The 23-foot (seven-meter) wall of water hit Friday night without
warning following an earthquake about 18 miles (30 kilometers) off
the coast of Papua New Guinea in the Pacific Ocean.
	   ``We heard a large bang, then saw the sea rising up. We had no
choice but to run for our lives,'' Paul Saroya, a resident of Nimas
village, told Australian Broadcasting Corp. television.
	   Nimas was one of at least three villages swept away when a bank
of three waves crashed into flimsy seafront homes along a 20-mile
(35-kilometer) stretch of coastline in West Sepik province Friday
night.
	   Australian government aid agency Ausaid officers in Papua New
Guinea estimated the death toll would climb to more than 1,000,
with many thousands injured, Australian Defense Minister Ian
McLachlan said.
	   Authorities at Aitape on the country's northwest coast said the
tsunami had wiped out three villages and had almost completely
destroyed another.
	   ``The latest death toll for the district is 599,'' district
disaster coordinating chairman Dickson Dalle said. ``But the figure
may increase as more bodies are found.''
	   Dalle said it was impossible to say how many people were
missing.
	   ``There are still people out there who are injured that we have
not rescued,'' he said. ``They're scattered all over in the
mangroves.''
	   Dalle said most of the victims were old people and
schoolchildren.
	   ``Schools in Arop, Sissano and Warapu will be closed because we
don't have the children,'' Dalle said. ``They're all dead.''
	   Ausaid estimated 6,000 people were left homeless. Many were
believed to have fled to high ground and to be still hiding inland
in the jungle, McLachlan said.
	   Associated Press photographer Brian Cassey flew over the Sissano
lagoon Sunday and said the beaches on which a number of villages
had been built had been swept clean.
	   ``The villages no longer exist. The beaches are clean,'' Cassey
said. ``The lagoon is filled with debris, coconut palms and what
used to be houses.''
	   In Arop village, where locals said about 2,000 people lived,
there was no sign of life, he added. No bodies were visible from
the air.
	   ``The place is desolate. Not a soul is there,'' Cassey said.
	   Fisherman Jerry Apuan from Aitape village said that on Sunday
morning, he saw more bodies than he could count floating in the
lagoon.
	   ``In one place there were so many bodies together I had to move
the boat slowly to pass through them,'' he said. ``I was afraid. It
was the first time I had seen so many bodies.''
	   Dalle said the confirmed dead included 500 at Warapu village, 40
at Malol and 41 at Sissano.
	   Prime Minister Bill Skate inspected part of the stricken area
Sunday.
	   Queen Elizabeth II sent a message to Papua New Guinea, which is
a member of the Commonwealth, expressing her shock at the deaths.
	   ``Her thoughts were with the families of the bereaved and
injured,'' said a Buckingham Palace spokeswoman.
	   Papua New Guinea, with a population of 4 million, is largely
dependent on agriculture and mining. The capital of Port Moresby is
about 600 kilometers (375 miles) east of the northeastern tip of
Australia.
	   Disaster authorities said the stricken area, about 600
kilometers (370 miles) northwest of Port Moresby, is spotted with
villages consisting of homes made of jungle materials and built on
beaches.
	   Robert Igara, the government's chief secretary, said the
population in the area affected by the tsunami was 8,000 to 10,000
people.
	   Three Australian Defense Forces Hercules C-130 transport planes
left Australia Sunday with equipment to set up a field hospital.
The equipment includes a mini-surgery theater, water treatment and
inspect sprays to avoid potential disease outbreaks.
	   ``They are looking mainly at antimalarial strategies,'' army
Capt. Mike Harris said of the Australian medical team.
	   Small aircraft and helicopters already were ferrying some of the
injured to unaffected towns, authorities said.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Only hours before the first high-level talks in
months by Israel and the Palestinians, police said a Palestinian
man apparently tried to detonate a car bomb in the heart of
Jerusalem.
	   ``A terrible tragedy was averted,'' Jerusalem police chief Yair
Yitzhaki told reporters after anti-terrorism police arrested the
badly burned driver of what he said was a van packed with
``dangerous'' materials.
	   ``It has been definitely established that it was a car bomb,''
the police chief said. The city's main downtown thoroughfare was
closed for three hours while police searched for possible
accomplices and other bombs.
	   Israel radio cited senior Israeli officials as blaming the
militant Islamic group Hamas, and saying the attempted bombing was
linked to Sunday evening's planned talks by Israeli Defense
Minister Yitzhak Mordechai and Yasser Arafat's deputy Mahmoud
Abbas.
	   Palestinians, however, suggested that Israel had staged the
incident to sabotage the peace effort.
	   ``It is a suspicious act _ you can ask the Israeli side who is
responsible,'' said Arafat spokesman Nabil Abourdeneh. ``It seems
to be a phony act aiming to mar the beginning of the
Palestinian-Israeli meetings.''
	   On Saturday, Palestinians said they would listen to what Israel
had to say, but would not renegotiate a U.S. initiative calling for
Israel to withdraw from another 13 percent of the West Bank.
	   Israel so far has balked at the pullback plan, citing security
concerns. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday he wanted
to move ahead with the peace process, but that Palestinians must
live up to security commitments.
	   ``We won't be satisfied with the current situation _ there could
be an attack at any moment,'' he told reporters. He said, however,
that it was not known who was responsible for Sunday's attempted
attack.
	   Police spokesman Shmuel Ben-Ruby said the bombing was thwarted
when an off-duty Jerusalem policeman and a bus driver saw smoke
coming from a van with front and back license plates that did not
match.
	   They smashed its windows, pulled out the burned driver and
called for help. Anti-terrorist police quickly arrived and
determined it was a car bomb, said Jerusalem police chief Yair
Yitzhaki.
	   Israel radio said components for detonating a bomb were found,
but police did not confirm that. The police chief also refused to
specify what materials were found in the van, but members of the
bomb squad were seen removing more than a dozen cans of
unidentified fluid and a pair of small gas tanks.
	   Yitzhaki said the fire may have broken out as the driver was
attempting to detonate the materials. The driver, who was
identified only as being from the Palestinian lands, was
hospitalized under heavy guard with serious burns.
	   He was not conscious and thus could not be questioned, Yitzhaki
told reporters. There was no immediate word on any other arrests.
	   A half-mile (kilometer) of Jerusalem's main downtown
thoroughfare and part of a downtown pedestrian mall were closed to
foot and car traffic for three hours, causing a massive traffic
jam. Crowds milled behind the police barricades.
	   Scores of stores and restaurants were temporarily evacuated.
Sunday is a regular business day in Israel.
	   There have been no major bombings in Israel in nearly a year. A
pair of suicide bombings last July 31 and Sept. 4 in downtown
Jerusalem killed 25 people, including five suicide bombers.
	   Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations broke down 16 months ago
after Israel's groundbreaking on a housing project in traditionally
Arab east Jerusalem. The United States, after months of trying to
bring the two sides together, urged them to talk directly about the
withdrawal plan.

Khmer Rouge troops surround former base in pre-election offensive
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DEAN JOHNSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SIEM REAP, Cambodia (AP) _ A Khmer Rouge military commander said
Sunday that diehard guerrillas were being deployed ahead of
elections next week to retake territory lost to the government army
in April.
	   Kim Eng, an assistant to the Khmer Rouge's chief of staff,
claimed that many Khmer Rouge fighters who defected to the
government in April, precipitating the loss of the guerrilla base
of Anlong Veng, were now angry with the government and wanted to
switch sides again.
	   They were apparently upset with pressure to vote for strongman
Hun Sen's party in parliamentary elections July 26, Kim Eng said.
He attributed an attack on election workers Friday in a remote area
near Anlong Veng to such a group.
	   The claims by Kim Eng threw an element of confusion over the
attack, which killed two people and injured five. Government
officials have said that a five-man raiding party of Khmer Rouge
guerrillas sprayed the convoy with automatic-weapons fire as it was
transporting ballot boxes and other materials from Anlong Veng to a
remote location.
	   Kim Eng said the diehard Khmer Rouge who have refused to make
peace with Hun Sen's government, estimated to number a few hundred
fighters, were being deployed to link up with the disaffected
defectors and fight to reclaim lost territory.
	   Government officials vowed Sunday that voting will go forward
around Anlong Veng. But military officials refused to let
journalists board helicopters from this northern town to Anlong
Veng, saying the situation was too dangerous.
	   ``We must go on,'' said Chea Tamrath, a member of the National
Election Committee overseeing the polls. ``We must let the people
elect.''
	   Though such raids would have little impact on the nationwide
outcome of the parliamentary elections, they would demonstrate that
the Khmer Rouge is still capable of doing damage. Ta Mok, its
leader, has vowed to disrupt the polls.
	   Srey Yon, a survivor of the attack, said that after attacking
the tractor carrying his team, the raiders took off everything _
ballot boxes and other election materials _ and burned it.
	   ``Ta Mok does not want anyone in these elections,'' Srey Yon
told Associated Press Television.
	   Ta Mok seized power from the Khmer Rouge's historic leader, Pol
Pot, in a bloody power struggle last year. Pol Pot died of a
purported heart attack while under house arrest by his ex-comrades
shortly after Anlong Veng fell.
	   The Khmer Rouge caused the deaths of as many as 2 million people
under a Maoist-inspired state it imposed between 1975 and 1979. It
waged guerrilla war against successive governments before mass
defections starting two years ago crippled the group.

	   HONG KONG (AP) _ The Philippines and Hong Kong split the last
two singles matches Sunday, giving the Filipinos a 4-1 overall
victory in the Asia-Oceania Zone Group 2 Davis Cup tennis
competition.
	   Melvin Tong scored Hong Kong's only victory point when he beat
Joseph Lizardo 7-5, 6-4 in Sunday's first match at the Victoria
Park court. Bryan Juinio then beat Hong Kong's Shane Barr 6-2, 6-2.
	   Sunday's singles were meaningless after Michael John Misa and
Adelo Abadia had defeated Hong Kong's Barr and Andrew Brothers 7-5,
7-5, 6-4 in the doubles Saturday, giving the Philippines an
unbeatable 3-0 lead. The Philippines won both the opening singles
matches on Friday.
	   Hong Kong is relegated to Group 3 following its defeat.

	   BEIJING (AP) _ China's longest runway has been built at
Shanghai's Pudong International Airport and will begin receiving
flights next year, the official Xinhua News Agency reported Sunday.
	   The runway is four kilometers (2.5 miles) long and 63 meters
(208 feet) wide, and is capable of handling Boeing 747s and other
types of large aircraft, Xinhua said.
	   The new airport, in an outer suburb of China's largest city and
commercial capital, is being built at a cost of 250 million yuan
(U.S. dlrs 30 million). Planners expect the airport to handle
100,000 flights annually after it opens in 1999, the agency
reported.

Singapore's largest supermarket chain closes all Malaysian outlets
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore's largest supermarket chain has
closed all seven outlets in neighboring Malaysia due to the
economic downturn and poor performance there, a newspaper reported
Sunday.
	   NTUC Fairprice, owned by Singapore's National Trade Union
Congress, established stores in Malaysia in 1994 under a joint
venture with Malaysia's Hong Leong Group.
	   From the start, it faced stiff competition from other
supermarket chains operating there, such as the French-owned
Carrefour, The Sunday Times reported.
	   ``It is due to the business downturn,'' chairman Chandra Das
said Saturday. ``We were losing money, so we decided to cease
operations there.''
	   Fairprice owns 63 stores in Singapore in addition to
supermarkets and trading offices in Indonesia, China and Myanmar.
	   It recently closed its solitary store in the Myanmar capital
Yangon, but continues to maintain a trading presence there.

Schnyder takes tour-high fifth title in Palermo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PALERMO, Sicily (AP) _ Top seed Patty Schnyder claimed her WTA
tour-high fifth title of the season Sunday, battling past Barbara
Schett in three sets at the Palermo Grand Prix.
	   Schnyder dropped only her second set of the week at the dlrs
107,500 clay court event but held on for the 6-1, 5-7, 6-2 victory
over the fourth-seeded Schett in 1 hour, 33 minutes.
	   The win, which gives her one more title than No. 1 Martina
Hingis, will push Schnyder's WTA ranking into the top 10 for the
first time in her career.
	   The Swiss 19-year-old, who was ranked 11th heading into the
Palermo tourney, had never captured an event before 1998.
	   Schnyder and Schett teamed up after the singles final to go
after the doubles trophy. The pair, seeded first, faced No. 4 seeds
Pavlina Stoyanova and Elena Wagner.

Russian miners lift rail blockade
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Striking coal miners in Siberia lifted their
blockade of the Trans-Siberian railway Sunday after a senior
Kremlin official opened talks with strike leaders, news reports
said.
	   The blockade was lifted after Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Sysuyev
agreed to meet with the miners and negotiate their demands, the
Interfax news agency said.
	   The miners blockaded the railway on July 3 to protest the
non-payment of wages, which the government had promised to provide
in May to end a similar protest.
	   Sysuyev told journalists that the government would pay its debts
to the miners by Wednesday, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported. The
government will also set up a commission in August to examine the
social and economic conditions in the Kemerovo coal-mining region,
Sysuyev said.
	   The 16-day blockade of the region has cost the regional economy
more than 125 million rubles (dlrs 20 million), ITAR-Tass said.

Court extends suspended sentence against top opposition leader
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serbia's Supreme Court extended from
four to seven months a suspended sentence against top opposition
leader Zoran Djindjic, which he had been handed in a libel suit
involving Serbian premier Mirko Marjanovic.
	   The pro-government Politika daily reported Sunday that the court
made the decision on Saturday, the very day Djindjic was re-elected
president of the Democratic Party at a party convention in
Belgrade.
	   Last year, following a public allegation against Marjanovic of
fraud in a trade deal, Djindjic was sued by the premier. A Belgrade
court sentenced him to a four-month suspended term.
	   The Supreme Court ruling was based on an appeal from the
prosecutor. Djindjic would have to stay in jail for seven months if
convicted on any criminal charge in the next three years.
	   Djindjic briefly served as Belgrade's first non-communist mayor
in more than 50 years.
	   But he was removed following a rift among opposition leaders.
Some of them have since openly or secretly sided with Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic, while Djindjic has emerged as the
most articulate and active Milosevic opponent.
	   Djindjic was expected to meet with a top U.S. envoy to the
Balkans, Robert Gelbard, in the Netherlands on Monday to discuss
the worsening crisis in Serbia's southern province of Kosovo.

Hick recalled, Flintoff may debut against South Africa
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Veteran Graeme Hick is recalled after two years
and Andrew Flintoff is included for a possible debut as England,
1-0 down in the series, makes changes for the fourth test against
South Africa starting Thursday.
	   Alarmed that England only just avoided going 2-0 down by
salvaging a draw from the game at Old Trafford, the England
selectors have decided to make changes to the bowling attack too.
	   Leg-spinner Ian Salisbury and left-arm paceman Alan Mullally
also are recalled to a 13-man squad for the match at Trent Bridge.
	   Hick, who has played 46 times for England but has been unabled
to carry his standout county form for Worcestershire into the test
arena, replaced injured Surrey batsman Graham Thorpe, who is
sidelined with persistent back trouble.
	   Opener Mark Butcher returns after injury to replace Nick Knight
and 20-year-old Flintoff, who has excelled for Lancashire with the
bat, may have to wait for his debut.
	   Knight, Ashley Giles, Ben Hollioake, Dean Headley and the
injured Thorpe are the five players dropped from the squad of 13
chosen for Old Trafford.
	   Squad:
	   Michael Atherton, Mark Butcher, Nasser Hussain, Alec Stewart,
Mark Ramprakash, Graeme Hick, Andrew Flintoff, Dominic Cork, Robert
Croft, Ian Salisbury, Darren Gough, Angus Fraser, Alan Mullally.

	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ More than 100,000 Cambodians
overcame fear of grenades and guns Sunday and watched massive,
festive parades and rallies marking the final week of a
violence-marred campaign for parliamentary elections.
	   The vote July 26 is aimed at putting to rest political divisions
festering since strongman Hun Sen toppled his co-prime minister,
Prince Norodom Ranariddh, in a coup a year ago. But though Hun Sen
has been accused of using murder, fear and vote-rigging to ensure
victory, a clear-cut result may prove elusive and Cambodia risks
another round of turmoil.
	   Ranariddh told an emotional rally of about 5,000 people in the
capital's Olympic Stadium that the election represented a choice
between ``a dictatorial military regime and liberal democracy. If
we don't make a careful decision, Cambodia will never see
liberty.''
	   Stores around the stadium were closed after news swept the city
that the country's main political parties would hold rallies or
marches Sunday, raising the danger of clashes with each other or
the Hun Sen-controlled military and police.
	   In the end, a promised motorcade of hundreds of truckloads of
supporters of Hun Sen's formerly communist Cambodian People's Party
was canceled and the police presence was minimal, an apparent
attempt to soothe the populace's jittery nerves.
	   Apart from the stadium area, most businesses were open. Tens of
thousands of onlookers packed sidewalks and balconies to watch
motorcades of party supporters file by, waving flags and chanting
slogans. Even guards at the grim French colonial-era prison came
out to watch.
	   Saturday night, Chea Sophara, the deputy municipal governor,
gave a televised statement calling rumors of violence
``psychological warfare'' to disrupt the election and raise the
price of goods. Nervous residents have stocked up on rice, cooking
oil and other essentials in the past week.
	   The party led by prominent dissident Sam Rainsy, the third major
force in the election, ran a colorful motorcade of some 50 trucks
and hundreds of motorcycles through the capital, past the royal
palace, the market, the stadium and on into the countryside.
Supporters beat drums and honked horns to the rhythm of ``Chai-yo,
Sam Rainsy,'' or ``Long live Sam Rainsy.''
	   Before setting out, they stopped near the National Assembly and
laid a fresh wreath at the park where at least 16 people were
killed and more than 100 injured March 30, 1997, when four grenades
were hurled into a rally Sam Rainsy was leading. The attack was
widely blamed on Hun Sen. Sam Rainsy escaped with slight injuries.
	   Hun Sen was recuperating Sunday in a hospital from an emergency
appendectomy performed Friday following a rare campaign appearance.
An aide, Prak Sokhon, said the Cambodian leader was able to get out
of bed on his own and walk a little bit.
	   Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy have accused Hun Sen and his party of
intimidation and being unlikely to transfer power if they lose. The
Sam Rainsy Party has claimed three of its activists have been
murdered in the past week.
	   Hun Sen says he will transfer power if the elections are free
and fair, though most irregularities have been attributed to his
party.
	   U.N. human rights monitors investigating political violence
issued a weekly report Sunday saying that one killing, two
attempted killings and about 50 other credible allegations of
election-related violence and intimidation had been brought to
their attention July 10-17.
	   The report does not include an ambush by Khmer Rouge guerrillas
on an election convoy reported Saturday.
	   Diehard elements of the greatly diminished rebel group have
vowed to disrupt the elections. The convoy was taking voting
materials and election officials to a site where guerrillas who
have defected to the government are preparing to vote in their
first election. Government officials said voting will go on.
	   Kim Eng, an assistant to the Khmer Rouge chief of staff, told
The Associated Press by telephone that the attack was carried out
by defectors upset over pressure to vote for Hun Sen. He claimed
they now want to switch sides again.
	   Hun Sen is favored to win, since his supporters control the
electoral machinery and the military. He came to power in 1985
under the Vietnamese military occupation that succeeded the
genocidal Khmer Rouge regime, and was also favored to win a
U.N.-organized vote in 1993. But Ranariddh and his royalist party
finished first. Hun Sen forced his way into a co-premiership by
threatening civil war.

More than 700 bishops gather for opening of Lambeth Conference
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANTERBURY, England (AP) _ The ancient cathedral of Canterbury
pulsed with African drums and whirling Latin-American dancers as
Anglican bishops from around the world gathered for communion
Sunday at the start of their once-a-decade Lambeth Conference.
	   The service, according to the Kenyan rite, began with a greeting
in Swahili from Archbishop of Canterbury George Carey. Among the
guests was heir to the throne Prince Charles, who as king one day
will be temporal head of the Church of England.
	   More than 700 bishops from national churches affiliated with the
Church of England are attending the conference, the main forum for
consultation among Anglicans, which runs through Aug. 8.
	   Business, which begins Monday, relations with other churches and
Third World debt, as well as an appeal from lesbian and gay
Christians for ''a healthy debate'' on their place in the church.
The Lambeth Conference can adopt resolutions but has no authority
to impose its will on the national churches.
	   In an apparent reference to the homosexuality question, the
Rt.Rev. Simon Chiwanga, Bishop of Mpwapwa in Tanzania, told
communicants Sunday: ``Controversial issues and passionate debates
do happen, and the Lambeth conference cannot be an exception.''
	   ``What is essential for every participant to be aware of is that
we have to look for Christ in each other and to turn the other
cheek,'' said Chiwanga, who preached the sermon. ``Change comes by
enlightenment, not by force. Forcing your point of view by
excluding from your circle those who disagree with you, or by
compelling acceptance, is to usurp the place of God.''
	   To reflect its multi-ethnic character, the Anglican Communion
organized a vibrant, colorful service in which Kikuyu hunting drums
alternated with the cathedral's great organ. Dancers in swirling
white dresses swayed to a Latin-American rhythm. Readings were in
Portuguese and Arabic.
	   Behind the scenes, lesbian and homosexual Anglicans are
vigorously lobbying bishops to reconsider the church's traditional
teaching on homosexuality.
	   But in an interview with the British Broadcasting Corp. aired
Sunday, Carey insisted heterosexual marriage or celibacy were the
only options for Christians.
	   ``We are going to resist homophobia. We are going to say
homosexuals are welcome in the church, in the priesthood, in the
working congregations,'' Carey said.
	   But he added, ``As a communion we have said the only lifestyles
that are permissible is that of marriage between a man and a woman
and that of celibacy for life.''
	   On Saturday, at a service in central London, Canon Elizabeth
Keaton of the diocese of Newark, New Jersey, became the first
openly lesbian priest to celebrate communion in Britain.
	   Bishop of Newark, the Rt. Rev. Jack Spong, is leading the
campaign for a more liberal attitude towards homosexuality.

<TEXT>
	   AITAPE, Papua New Guinea (AP) _ Lusien Romme fled in terror
before a giant wave he said was as tall as the coconut trees around
his home in Arop, a village on Papua New Guinea's north coast.
	   The 10-meter (33-foot)-high wall of water smashed his flimsily
built house, swept away his entire village and drowned his wife.
	   The force of the tidal wave hurled him into a coconut tree and
then into the lagoon behind his village.
	   Lusien was lucky. He broke only two fingers and hurt his ribs
and shoulder.
	   For hundreds of others who lived in beachfront villages along
Papua New Guinea's remote north coast, Friday night's terrifying
tsunami brought death or terrible injury.
	   The only warning was a sound like a jet plane approaching,
witnesses said later.
	   Minutes later, homes were pounded to matchwood and their
occupants dragged hundreds of meters (yards) in a mass of water,
trees and tangled timber.
	   Speaking Sunday from his bed at the Raihu Health Center at
Aitape, Lusien recalled feeling the powerful offshore earthquake
that triggered the tsunami.
	   He felt three shakes.
	   As he stood in his beachside village fronting the Sissano
Lagoon, Lusien saw ``the sea rising up and coming toward me.''
	   He ran, shouting to fellow villagers to save themselves.
	   He called to his wife Monica to search for their 6-year-old
daughter Martina.
	   ``I was really scared,'' Lusien said.
	   ``The wave came above the house and the coconut trees.''
	   The wave pushed down his house, made from materials cut from the
Papua New Guinea jungle, ``like a bulldozer.''
	   Before he could find his daughter, Lusien was struck by the wave
and the debris of his house and hurled into Sissano Lagoon.
Fortunately he surfaced near a boat.
	   Other people washed into the lagoon in the dark were yelling.
	   ``I called out for help,'' Lusien said. ``I called for anyone
who was alive. Other people got in the boat.
	   ``It all happened in one flash.''
	   Lusien learned later that his daughter had survived but his wife
had drowned in the lagoon, which Sunday was littered with debris
and hundreds of bodies.
	   Arop, one of three villages on the slip of beach, was literally
washed away.
	   ``There was nothing left except for coconut trees,'' Lusien
said.

Cypriot government protests arrival of Turkish warplanes, ships
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALEX EFTY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ The Greek Cypriot government on Sunday
accused Turkey of ``threatening peace'' by sending a dozen
warplanes and 10 warships to the Turkish-occupied north of the
island.
	   The air and naval units were dispatched to participate in the
weeklong Turkish Cypriot celebrations beginning Monday to mark the
24th anniversary of Turkey's invasion of the island.
	   The Turks invaded to protect the Turkish Cypriot minority
following an abortive coup by Greek Cypriot supporters of union
with Greece.
	   A breakaway Turkish Cypriot state established in the north is
recognized only by Ankara, which maintains 35,000 troops there.
	   The Greek Cypriot defense minister, Yiannakis Omirou, criticized
the arrival of the Turkish warplanes and ships, saying: ``The
international community must realize after this latest Turkish
display who is threatening peace and who is the troublemaker in the
region.''
	   Government spokesman Christos Stylianides said the arrival of
the units ``proves once more the provocative attitude and
intransigence of Turkey.''
	   He added: ``Such actions are a challenge to the international
community to adopt a clear stand toward those who create tension on
the island.''
	   The anniversary is getting much more attention this year because
of increased tension between Greece and Turkey over the Greek
Cypriots' decision to buy S-300 anti-aircraft missiles from Russia.
	   Also Sunday, the Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash said in a
speech broadcast on the Turkish Cypriots' Bayrak Radio that ``We
have suffered, but we have not become the slaves of the Greek
Cypriots.''
	   He pledged closer cooperation with Turkey, especially to improve
the economy.
	   Celebrations in the north will include a visit Monday by Turkish
Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz.
	   Greek Cypriots began marking the anniversary Sunday with
memorial church services for the more than 5,000 Greek Cypriots who
were killed or went missing during the Turkish invasion.
	   Organizations representing the 180,000 Greek Cypriots who fled
or were forcibly expelled from the north plan a series of protest
demonstrations along the U.N.-patrolled buffer zone that splits the
island.
	   The missiles, scheduled for deployment in the fall, have raised
tensions between rival Turkey and Greece, which have close
relations with the two Cyprus communities.
	   Turkey has warned it will prevent the deployment of the missiles
by force if necessary.
	   Greece, which has a joint defense agreement with Cyprus, warned
in turn that a Turkish attack would spark a wider conflict between
Greece and Turkey, both NATO allies.
	   Stylianides said Turkey's decision to send warplanes and ships
appeared to be a rejection of a recent proposal by President
Glafcos Clerides for the demilitarization of the island.
	   Clerides' demilitarization proposal followed intense criticism
from the United States and other Western governments over his
decision to buy the Russian missiles.

Official says kidnapping wave led to huge capital flight
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ About dlrs 3 billion in capital has
been taken out of the Philippines by investors threatened by ransom
kidnappings, which peaked last year, President Joseph Estrada's
chief aide said Sunday.
	   Estrada has pledged to make crime-busting a cornerstone of his
six-year administration to woo business and capital back, Executive
Secretary Ronaldo Zamora said.
	   The lost capital represented a drop in dollar bank deposits amid
last year's wave of ransom kidnappings, aimed mostly at wealthy
traders, Zamora said, quoting a report by Finance Secretary Edgardo
Espiritu.
	   ``A large number of businessmen and investors, mostly Chinese
Filipinos, have left the country and taken their money with them,''
Zamora said in a statement.
	   More than 150 kidnappings occurred in the country last year,
involving 249 victims. At least 18 died in the hands of kidnappers
and a total of 306 million pesos (dlrs 7.6 million) in ransom was
paid, the statement said.
	   More than 200 kidnappers belonging to at least 19 kidnap gangs
remain at large, said Zamora.
	   Estrada, a former movie actor, has said he would be his own
secretary of interior and local government, in charge of the
national police, to personally supervise an anti-crime and -graft
drive until most criminals were driven ``to extinction.''
	   Estrada is to issue an order this week creating a multi-agency
anti-crime task force. He also has ordered police to identify,
investigate and charge more than 2,400 soldiers and policemen
implicated in ransom kidnappings, drug trafficking and other crimes
in the last three years.
	   The names of the policemen and soldiers, including those still
on active duty, were compiled by military intelligence agents under
Estrada's predecessor, Fidel Ramos.

Veteran soldier's savings become moldy and worthless
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ A veteran soldier left 400,000 Taiwan
dollars (U.S. dlrs 11,600) of his life savings hidden under his bed
when he died, but most of the money had become worthless because of
mold, a newspaper reported Sunday.
	   The China Times Express quoted a Bank of Taiwan official as
saying the moldy dollar bills were stuck together like a brick when
they were found by the dead man's children.
	   The paper did not identify the man, but said he died recently in
Taipei.
	   After hours spent trying to sort them out, only about
one-twentieth of the bills were recoverable, the official was
quoted as saying.
	   Many elderly Taiwanese hide their savings in secret places at
home because of a lack of confidence in banks or other financial
institutions.

Computer giant Compaq expects to remain profitable in Asia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ U.S. computer giant Compaq expects continued
profitability in crisis-ridden Asia but will cut costs in its
regional operations nonetheless, The Sunday Times reported.
	   Paul Chan, Compaq's Asia-Pacific vice president and managing
director, said Friday the company plans to cut inventory and
introduce more value-added products to ensure profitability in the
region, according to the newspaper.
	   Chan stressed the need to ensure proper inventory levels by
improving efficiency in the company's supply network.
	   Compaq's second-quarter sales in Asia-Pacific dipped 15 percent
from the previous quarter, the report said. The company noted sales
in Indonesia fell sharply because of the recent social and
political unrest there.
	   ``The Indonesian crisis has affected our volumes dramatically,''
Chan said. ``In 1996, it looked as if Indonesia was going to be a
fairly large market for us, but then came the crisis.''
	   ``Demand (there) is still good, but the credit is not,'' he
added.
	   Compaq posted a dlrs 3.6 billion net loss in the second quarter
because of huge charges related to its purchase of Digital
Equipment Co. and global plant closings.
	   The company announced last month that it is closing six plants
overseas and eliminating 5,000 jobs worldwide as part of a
cost-cutting drive.
	   The plants to be closed include two in Scotland and one each in
Brazil, China, Singapore and Taiwan. The company is also closing
operations in Australia, Brazil and Japan used for final assembly
of computers for shipment to customers.
	   Founded in 1982 and based in Houston, Texas, Compaq is the
second-largest computer company in the world and the largest
personal computer manufacturer.

	   The Greek Cypriot defense minister, Yiannakis Omirou, criticized
the deployment, saying: ``The international community must realize
after this latest Turkish display who is threatening peace and who
is the troublemaker in the region.''
	   The anniversary is getting much more attention this year because
of increased tension between Greece and Turkey over the Greek
Cypriots' decision to buy S-300 anti-aircraft missiles from Russia.
	   Also Sunday, the Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash said in a
speech broadcast on the Turkish Cypriots' Bayrak Radio that ``We
have suffered, but we have not become the slaves of the Greek
Cypriots.''
	   He pledged closer cooperation with Turkey, especially to improve
the economy.
	   Celebrations in the north will include a visit Monday by Turkish
Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz.
	   Greek Cypriots began marking the anniversary Sunday with
memorial church services for the more than 5,000 Greek Cypriots who
were killed or went missing during the Turkish invasion.

Pope's spokesman: Visit to Romania a possibility next year
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BORNO, Italy (AP) _ Pope John Paul II, who has been seeking to
improve relations with Orthodox Christians, might visit Romania
next year, his spokesman said Sunday.
	   The government recently invited the pope, but there have been
questions over the response from the dominant Orthodox Church
because of conflicts over the ownership of church property as has
happened elsewhere in eastern Europe following the fall of
communism.
	   Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls, accompanying John Paul
on a stop in Borno during the pope's vacation, listed Romania as a
possible trip in 1999, along with a confirmed visit to Mexico and
the U.S. city of St. Louis in January and an expected trip to his
native Poland in the spring.
	   Borno, in the foothills of the Alps about 100 kilometers (60
miles) east of Milan, is the hometown off one of the pope's closest
assistants, Archbishop Giovanni Battista Re, the Vatican's
undersecretary of state.
	   John Paul was flown here by helicopter for the day from his
vacation retreat in Lorenzago. He was welcomed by tens of thousands
of villagers and vacationers, who jammed the main square to receive
the pope's blessing.
	   The Vatican has tried to set up a historic meeting with the
Russian Orthodox patriarch, but the Russians said recently the time
is still not ripe.
	   In Romana, the Communists seized Catholic properties in 1948 and
handed them to the Orthodox Church. Tensions over who owns the
buildings have erupted between the two, culminating in a recent
cathedral brawl in Transylvania.

	   MONTPELLIER, France (AP) _ French police seized about 700
kilograms (1,500 pounds) of marijuana while checking a stolen car
falsely registered in Germany, police said.
	   The three French occupants of the car that had been stolen in
the French port of Marseille were detained Saturday by police near
the Mediterranean city of Montpellier.
	   Police had stopped the car on the A9 highway near Montpellier
and discovered the drugs while inspecting the vehicle and

After 159 strokes, Woods and Price just happy it's over
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to CORRECT to golf sted tennis in slug &QL; 
 &UR; By TIM DAHLBERG &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SOUTHPORT, England (AP) _ Nick Price looked as if he was
shell-shocked. Tiger Woods stared straight ahead in disbelief.
	   Together they walked off the 18th green Saturday, out of
patience and most likely out of chances to win the British Open.
	   ``I'm just happy it's over,'' Woods said. ``The suffering is
over.''
	   Indeed it was, after a day that began with much promise ended
with only the polite applause of the grandstand galleries.
	   Price had just missed a final putt for par to shoot 82. Woods
tapped in for par and a 77. Between the two, they spent 159 strokes
in a futile attempt to tame wind-swept Royal Birkdale.
	   Now, after four hours of hitting balls in and out of knee-high
rough, missing short putts and generally playing like weekend
golfers, they walked step-in-step to the scoring trailer to make it
official.
	   Price stepped aside to let Woods in first, as if he was
reluctant to formally commit this round to history, and with good
reason. On the scorecard it looked just as ugly as it did on the
course _ 37-45-82.
	   ``I lost a little bit of confidence and suddenly _ 82,'' Price
said. ``I've probably had worse rounds as a pro, but not too
many.''
	   It wasn't supposed to be this way as Price and Woods stepped to
the first tee.
	   One stroke off the lead at 2 under for the tournament and
playing in the next-to-last group, they were supposed to set the
pace and put the pressure on second-round leader Brian Watts and
17-year-old English amateur Justin Rose.
	   If anyone was to blow up, it would be the untested Watts or the
young Rose. Not Woods, and especially not Price, who won the claret
jug in 1994.
	   But in the 35 mph (55 kph) winds of Birkdale, they did. So did
many others on a day when no one shot under par on the coast of the
Irish Sea. Phil Mickelson shot an 85 and 21 others couldn't break
80.
	   ``When you have 82 professionals and no one can break par,
something's amiss,'' Pric

Stevie Wonder, Michael Jackson to help Mandela celebrate
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ For an 80-year-old newlywed,
it's been quite a weekend, and the partying to celebrate President
Nelson Mandela's birthday was far from over on Sunday.
	   Singers Stevie Wonder and Michael Jackson, actor Danny Glover,
former Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere and former Zambian
President Kennth Kaunda were reportedly among 2,000 people on the
guest list for Mandela's birthday banquet, being held Sunday night
at an estate north of Johannesburg.
	   Mandela's birthday was on Saturday, but the celebration is
spread over several days. And now, there is something else to
toast: Mandela's wedding on his birthday to Graca Machel, the widow
of a Mozambican president.
	   Sunday night's banquet, broadcast live to millions of South
Africans, was expected to be the first time the newlyweds would be
seen in public since they were married at Mandela's home.
	   Relatives and close friends, including fellow Nobel Peace Prize
laureate Desmond Tutu, were present as the couple were wed by a
Methodist bishop.
	   Machel, 52, works on children's issues for the United Nations
and is the widow of Mozambique President Samora Machel, who died in
a 1986 plane crash.
	   Mirroring a spirit of multi-cultural diversity Mandela has
fostered in South Africa, the Jewish, Hindu and Muslim communities
also gave their blessings to the marriage.
	   Tutu, a retired Anglican archbishop who had chided Mandela for
setting a bad example for the nation's youth by carrying on a
relationship with Machel outside marriage, helped officiate. A
magistrate was also present.
	   The marriage is the third for Mandela and the second for Machel.
	   The couple met in 1990, shortly after Mandela was released from
prison.
	   Machel had expressed reluctance to complicate her relationship
with Mandela by marrying him. For some time, Mandela has said she
should be treated as a first lady during foreign state visits.
	   Mandela divorced his second wife, Winnie, in 1996 on grounds she
had been
	   unfaithful. Winnie Madikizela-Mandela remains a member of the
African National Congress' executive committee but has been at odds
with other leaders of the ruling party after she publicly
criticized the ANC for its policies.
	   Mandela first married in 1944, the marriage to Evelyn ended in
divorce in
	   1957 after quarrels over his long nights of political
involvement. He had four children from his first marriage. Two of
them died.
	   Mandela and Madikizela-Mandela had two daughters.

U.N.: Job uncertainty fueling violence, bullying at work
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: EMBARGOED by source until 0001 GMT, Monday July 20. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Increasing job uncertainty worldwide is fueling
violence at work, according to a U.N. report released Monday.
	   Psychological violence, such as group harassment of employees,
is emerging as a major problem, it said.
	   ``Violence at work has become a global concern,'' said Vittorio
Di Martino, co-author of the 165-page International Labor
Organization report.
	   Japan's economic downturn, leading to the loss of lifetime job
security, has led to alleged bullying of workers as ``personal
relationships become more precarious,'' Di Martino said.
	   The report identified France, Argentina, Romania and Canada as
among the countries which have reported the highest rates of
assaults and sexual harassment on the job.
	   But it cautioned that the problem's severity is recognized and
documented most in Europe and North America. No general
international definition of violence at work has yet been agreed,
it noted.
	   The response to violence is often ``limited, episodic and
ill-defined,'' although employers end up bearing the costs of lost
work and improved security, as well as risking loss of product
quality and company image.
	   An average of 20 workers are killed every week in the United
States, while some 18,000 are assaulted at work or on duty, the
survey said.
	   In the United States, retail and service industries account for
85 percent of all assaults in the workplace, it said. As elsewhere,
taxi drivers ran the highest risk of assault.
	   Psychological violence can also have dire effects, the report
said.
	   In Sweden, mobbing of employees, also reported in the United
States and Britain, was estimated to be a factor in 10 to 15
percent of suicides.
	   The ``Violence At Work'' report compiled information from a
range of national and international surveys.

Iraq criticizes U.S. stand on oil pricing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ American reservations over Iraq's oil
pricing formula could disrupt exports under the U.N.-approved
oil-for-food program, an Iraqi official said Sunday.
	   ``The delay in approving the pricing mechanism by the U.S. envoy
... will disrupt the scheduled arrival of tankers,'' the official
Iraqi News Agency quoted an unnamed Oil Ministry spokesman as
saying.
	   ``This stand of U.S. administration is a flagrant violation of
adopted procedures as has never happened since the start of the
memorandum of understanding'' that launched the program in December
1996, the spokesman added.
	   He said the action also ``confirms that the U.S. administration
harbors ill intentions against the Iraqi people.''
	   On Thursday the United States objected to Iraq's selling price
for August on grounds that exports to Europe were underpriced.
	   Iraq's State Oil Marketing Organization proposed a price of dlrs
2.60 a barrel below Brent crude for Kirkuk crude destined for the
European market in August.
	   The discount is similar to that it proposed for July. Iraq has
typically sold its oil at an average of dlrs 1.5 below the North
Sea benchmark.
	   The oil-for-food program is an exception from the punishing U.N.
trade sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   Iraq initially was allowed to export dlrs 2 billion worth of oil
every six months to buy needed food and medicine.
	   The quota was raised to dlrs 5.2 billion this summer, but Iraq
has said it probably can't meet the target because of low world oil
prices and a shortage of spare parts at its oil facilities.

Chechen president calls up reservists to combat crime
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov Sunday ordered
the mobilization of 5,000 military reservists to help in the
crusade against crime, Russian news agencies said.
	   Maskhadov issued the decree ``to re-man the Chechen Defense
Ministry's units safeguarding the state of emergency regime and
fighting criminal groups,'' the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   The decree calls for 5,000 veterans of the 1994-96 war with
Russia to be issued uniforms and weapons. The mobilized reservists
will guard check points and take part in other operations aimed at
combating crime, Maskhadov said.
	   On Friday, Maskhadov extended a state of emergency to give
security forces time to complete operations against a spreading
wave of violent crime and kidnapping.
	   The state of emergency in the separatist, imposed by Maskhadov
on June 23, was to have expired Friday. He extended it for 10 days.
	   Chechnya remains a center of violent crime and frequent
kidnappings despite the end of its independence war against Russia
two years ago.

Heavy fighting flares in wider Orahovac area
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES with heavy fighting reported around
Orahovac, Serbs claiming they retook police station, British aid
worker sentenced to 30 days in prison; EDITS throughout. &QL; 
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Heavy fighting resumed Sunday
between government forces and Kosovo separatists around the central
Kosovo town of Orahovac, the target of a guerrilla offensive a day
before, field reports said.
	   Saturday's offensive at Orahovac, about 50 kilometers (30 miles)
southwest of Pristina, appeared aimed at expanding the estimated 40
percent of territory held by the militant Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   The advance provoked a Serbian counter-offensive. Reliable
witnesses near Orahovac on Saturday saw Serb tanks and artillery
pieces moving to back up the counter-attack. Hundreds of civilians
fled on tractors and horse-drawn wagons.
	   Sunday's fighting affected a wider area around Orahovac,
focusing on nearby Drenoc village, which was under fierce Serb
artillery fire, and Bela Crkva, another area village which was all
in flames, initial unconfirmed Albanian reports said.
	   One report said that at least two civilians were killed, but
many more were feared dead or wounded
	   The Serbian Media Center in Pristina said that on Sunday morning
strong police forces freed the Orahovac police station and the
center of the town of 20,000.
	   The police were reported battling remaining isolated groups of
rebel fighters, who barricaded themselves in several spots in the
town _ the post office, a local daytime hospital and a school.
	   Police had not taken any casualties in the fighting there since
it erupted, and a total of eight KLA fighters, including three
``officers,'' surrendered to the police overnight, the center said.
	   The report could not be independently confirmed, and the ethnic
Albanians had not yet released their version of the Orahovac
fighting Sunday.
	   On Saturday, a Yugoslav army statement said some 1,000
``terrorists'' tried to cross from Albania into Kosovo, west of
Decani town. The attack was foiled and about 30 guerrillas were
``liquidated.''
	   In another border clash, Yugoslav forces shelled Saturday the
region of Padesh village on the Albanian border in an attempt to
further disrupt the guerrillas' gun-smuggling network into Kosovo,
a province of Serbia, which makes up most of present-day
Yugoslavia.
	   Ethnic Albanians, who outnumber Serbs 9-to-1 in Kosovo, are
demanding independence from Serbia.
	   Albanian border guards near Padesh reported seeing the bodies of
dead and wounded victims but gave no casualty count.
	   Officials in Albania said 19 wounded Kosovo Liberation Army
members crossed into Albania to escape the barrage. Albania's state
TV said 80 others fleeing the violence, apparently civilians,
strayed into a deadly border minefield. They were evacuated by
Albanian border troops, state TV reported.
	   The wounded guerrillas, some wearing uniforms with the KLA
insignia, were flown to Tirana, Albania's capital, where reporters
said most of the wounds appeared relatively minor.
	   Albania's deputy interior minister, Ilir Cano, said two Serb
mortar rounds landed inside Albanian territory. The Yugoslav army
denied any border violations.
	   In a statement condemning the reported border violations, the
Albanian government late Saturday spoke of ``a barbarian acts.''
	   It called on foreign powers and organizations ``to use all their
means and take urgent and extraordinary steps to stop this fascist
aggression of the Belgrade authorities on the Albanian
population.''
	   But the government also said it was ``capable of facing any
provocations or threats against its sovereignty and territorial
integrity ...''
	   Also on Saturday, British aid worker Sally Becker was handed a
30-day prison term by a court in the town of Djakovica for crossing
illegally the Yugoslav-Albanian border, Serbian sources said.

China betting on private business to lift economy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China's first nominally private bank will lend 5
billion yuan (U.S. dlrs 604 million) to small businesses as part of
efforts to recharge the sputtering economy, the People's Daily said
Sunday.
	   The China Minsheng Banking Corp. signed loan agreements with 20
businesses at a ceremony at the Great Hall of the People, the
massive building where China's legislature meets and its rulers
receive foreign dignitaries, the official Communist Party newspaper
said.
	   Loans will be made to a total of 100 private businesses that are
``small to medium-size, advanced, with bright futures, and able to
create many employment opportunities,'' the paper said.
	   The high-profile lending follows last Friday's announcement that
the economy grew at a pace slower than the targeted 7 percent in
this year's first half, largely due to fallout from the Asian
economic crisis.
	   Though the performance was outstanding in a region of stumbling
economies, officials say 8 percent growth for the year is crucial
to creating jobs for workers laid off from bloated and inefficient
state industries.
	   The government hopes private businesses can pick up the economic
slack created by the reform drive. But state lending institutions
have little experience with private start-ups, and many
entrepreneurs complain that banks, courts and the bureaucracy
discriminate against them.
	   Minsheng Bank was established in 1996 and so far has made loans
of 13.9 billion yuan (U.S. dlrs 1.7 billion), the People's Daily
reported. Its chairman is Jing Shuping, who also heads the private
business group All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce and is
a key advocate of new laws to protect entrepreneurs.

German team finds ships believed to date from Thirty Years' War
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SCHLESWIG, Germany (AP) _ Following up on a 139-year-old tip,
archaeologists have found nine shipwrecks dating from the 17th
century buried in mud at a Baltic Sea inlet in northern Germany.
	   The 30- to 50-foot boats are believed to be from a military
fleet that sank during the Thirty Years' War, a series of political
and religious conflicts in Europe from 1618 to 1648.
	   The team was led to the find by a note written in 1859 and found
in the state's museum archives, said Willi Kramer, head of the
Schleswig-Holstein state archaeology department.
	   In the note, royal surveyor Wilhelm von Sommer said that an
unusually violent storm on Feb. 11, 1859 drove water from the
Schlei inlet, near Schleswig, and partially uncovered a number of
old wrecks.
	   The archaeological team, which began searching in 1996, found
nine boats buried under about six feet of mud in the inlet. Kramer
said Thursday that he did not rule out finding more boats in the
area.
	   The exact age of the ships is to be confirmed only after they
are excavated from the inlet, Kramer said.

have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   PORT MORESBY, Papua New Guinea _ A tsunami spawned by a 7.0
magnitude earthquake crashed into Papua New Guinea's north coast,
crushing villages and killing nearly 600 people, officials said
Sunday. The 23-foot (seven-meter) wall of water hit Friday night
without warning following an earthquake about 18 miles (30
kilometers) off the coast of Papua New Guinea in the Pacific Ocean.
``We heard a large bang, then saw the sea rising up. We had no
choice but to run for our lives,'' Paul Saroya, a resident of Nimas
village, told Australian Broadcasting Corp. television. (PAPUA NEW
GUINEA TSUNAMI)
	   JERUSALEM _ Only hours before the first high-level talks in
months between Israel and the Palestinians, police said a
Palestinian man apparently tried to detonate a car bomb Sunday in
the heart of Jerusalem. ``A terrible tragedy was averted,''
Jerusalem police chief Yair Yitzhaki told reporters after
anti-terrorism police arrested the badly burned driver of what he
said was a van packed with ``dangerous'' materials. ``It has been
definitely established that it was a car bomb,'' the police chief
said. The city's main downtown thoroughfare was closed for three
hours while police searched for possible accomplices and other
bombs. (ISRAEL PALESTINIANS)
	   LONDON _ Gunmen shot a man to death early Sunday on the stairs
of his Belfast apartment block in what police said appeared to be a
``punishment'' attack by paramilitaries. The man, who was in his
early 30s, was with his mother and two-week-old daughter in his
apartment in the Catholic New Lodge area when five men burst in
soon after midnight, police said. The men disconnected the family's
phone, then took the man to an outside stairwell, where they shot
him in both legs, said a police spokesman, speaking with customary
anonymity. The man, who was not identified, died later of his
injuries. (NORTHERN IRELAND)
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia _ More than 100,000 Cambodians overcame
fear of grenades and guns Sunday and watched massive, festive
parades and rallies marking the final week of a violence-marred
campaign for parliamentary elections. The vote July 26 is aimed at
putting to rest political divisions festering since strongman Hun
Sen toppled his co-prime minister, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, in a
coup a year ago. But though Hun Sen has been accused of using
murder, fear and vote-rigging to ensure victory, a clear-cut result
may prove elusive and Cambodia risks another round of turmoil.
Ranariddh told an emotional rally of about 5,000 people in the
capital's Olympic Stadium that the election represented a choice
between ``a dictatorial military regime and liberal democracy. If
we don't make a careful decision, Cambodia will never see
liberty.'' (CAMBODIA ELECTIONS)
	   BAUCAU, Indonesia _ The search for peace in troubled East Timor
gathered pace Sunday when a U.N. mediator flew into the territory
and held talks with military, local government and church officials
despite security fears. Jamsheed Marker, the U.N. special envoy on
East Timor, arrived in East Timor's second largest town of Baucau
on an Indonesian military C-130 plane from the tourist island of
Bali after earlier talks in Jakarta, Indonesia's capital. ``There
are many obstacles. This is a longstanding problem that has gone on
for years. There is a lot of bitterness,'' Marker said after
meeting local military commanders, East Timor's two Roman Catholic
bishops, the provincial governor and former separatist guerrillas
for several hours. (INDONESIA EAST TIMOR)

Chiefs to discuss Queen Elizabeth's role for Fiji
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBERT KEITH REID &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SUVA, Fiji (AP) _ Fiji's tribal chiefs will discuss this week
whether Britain's Queen Elizabeth should be restored as the Pacific
country's sovereign, the government said Sunday.
	   A government spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity,
confirmed that the matter would be debated at a two-day meeting of
the Great Council of Chiefs starting Tuesday in the capital, Suva.
	   Fiji discarded Queen Elizabeth as its sovereign and became a
republic after the second of two military coups in 1987.
	   The country's new constitution, due to take effect July 27,
specifies that the country will retain its republic status, with a
president chosen by the chiefs and whose powers are restricted to
acting on the advice of a democratically elected prime minister.
	   The new document replaces a constitution instituted in 1990 but
condemned internationally as being undemocratic.
	   Fijian chiefs expressed disquiet about the break with the
British crown after the coups, and instructed coup leader Col.
Sitiveni Rabuka, now the prime minister, to explore the possibility
of restoring ties.
	   Rabuka visited Britain last year for the Commonwealth Heads of
Government conference in Edinburgh and held meetings with Queen
Elizabeth there and at Buckingham Palace.
	   Rabuka confirmed that while in London, he gave Queen Elizabeth a
tabua (sperm whale's tooth), which in Fijian custom is a gesture of
utmost respect and, depending on the circumstances of the
presentation, also an apology.
	   In Fiji, most public sentiment tends to favor a restoration.
	   Some commentators believe that the Fijian chiefs, whose public
authority is waning, will try to bolster their position in the
community by approving Queen Elizabeth's return as a symbolic
``paramount chief.''

Iraq criticizes U.S. stand on oil pricing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ American reservations over Iraq's oil
pricing formula could disrupt exports under the U.N.-approved
oil-for-food program, an Iraqi official said Sunday.
	   ``The delay in approving the pricing mechanism by the U.S. envoy
... will disrupt the scheduled arrival of tankers,'' the official
Iraqi News Agency quoted an unnamed Oil Ministry spokesman as
saying.
	   ``This stand of the U.S. administration is a flagrant violation
of adopted procedures as has never happened since the start of the
memorandum of understanding'' that launched the program in December
1996, the spokesman added.
	   He said the action also ``confirms that the U.S. administration
harbors ill intentions against the Iraqi people.''
	   On Thursday the United States objected to Iraq's selling price
for August on grounds that exports to Europe were underpriced.
	   Iraq's State Oil Marketing Organization proposed a price of dlrs
2.60 a barrel below Brent crude for Kirkuk crude destined for the
European market in August.
	   The discount is similar to one proposed for July. Iraq has
typically sold its oil at an average of dlrs 1.5 below the North
Sea benchmark.
	   The oil-for-food program is an exception from the punishing U.N.
trade sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   Iraq initially was allowed to export dlrs 2 billion worth of oil
every six months to buy needed food and medicine.
	   The quota was raised to dlrs 5.2 billion this summer, but Iraq
has said it probably can't meet the target because of low world oil
prices and a shortage of spare parts at its oil facilities.

Bomb attempt fails hours before Israel-Palestinian talks

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Only hours before the first high-level talks in
months between Israel and the Palestinians, police said a
Palestinian man apparently tried to set off a car bomb Sunday in
the heart of Jerusalem.
	   ``A terrible tragedy was averted,'' Jerusalem police chief Yair
Yitzhaki told reporters after anti-terrorism police arrested the
badly burned driver of what he said was a van packed with
``dangerous'' materials.
	   ``It has been definitely established that it was a car bomb,''
the police chief said. The city's main downtown thoroughfare was
closed for three hours while police searched for possible
accomplices and other bombs.
	   Israel radio cited senior officials as blaming the militant
Islamic group Hamas, but in the Gaza Strip, Hamas spokesman Mahmoud
Zahar said he had no knowledge of the attempted attack. ``Israel
puts the name of Hamas in everything,'' he said.
	   Yasser Arafat's spokesman Nabil Abourdeneh called the incident a
``phony act'' meant to mar Sunday evening's planned talks between
Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai and Yasser Arafat's
deputy Mahmoud Abbas.
	   The talks were being held at the urging of the United States,
which called on Israel and the Palestinians to negotiate directly
to resolve differences over a U.S. initiative calling for Israel to
withdraw from another 13 percent of the West Bank.
	   On Saturday, Palestinians said they would listen to what Israel
had to say, but would not renegotiate the American plan. Israel has
so far balked at the pullback proposal.
	   Palestinian chief negotiator Nabil Shaath said he thought the
meeting had only a ``very, very limited chance'' of success.
	   ``But for a chance of one percent we will go, because we don't
want to be told that we have wasted an opportunity,'' he told
reporters in the West Bank town of Ramallah.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the bomb attempt
illustrated Israel's security concerns, but that he wanted the
peace process to move ahead.
	   ``You saw that we had a car-bomb attempt in the middle of
Jerusalem, and thereby you can understand why we insist that the
Palestinians carry out their responsibilities, first of all in
fighting terrorism,'' he told reporters in Jerusalem. ``But at the
same time we are coming with an open mind and a desire to achieve
an agreement.''
	   Police spokesman Shmuel Ben-Ruby said the bombing was thwarted
when an off-duty Jerusalem policeman and a bus driver saw smoke
coming from a white van with front and back license plates that did
not match.
	   They smashed its windows, pulled out the burned driver and
called for help. Anti-terrorist police quickly arrived and
determined it was a car bomb, said Jerusalem police chief Yair
Yitzhaki.
	   Israel radio said components for detonating a bomb were found,
but police did not confirm that. The police chief also refused to
specify what materials were found in the van, but members of the
bomb squad were seen removing more than a dozen cans of
unidentified fluid and a pair of small gas tanks.
	   Yitzhaki said the fire may have broken out as the driver was
attempting to detonate the bomb. The driver, who was identified
only as being an Arab from the Palestinian lands, was hospitalized
under heavy guard with serious burns.
	   He was not conscious and thus could not be questioned, Yitzhaki
told reporters. There was no immediate word on any other arrests.
	   A half-mile (kilometer) of Jerusalem's main downtown
thoroughfare and part of a downtown pedestrian mall were closed for
three hours. Traffic jams backed up on both ends of the street, and
large crowds milled behind the police barricades .
	   Scores of stores and restaurants were temporarily evacuated.
Sunday is a regular business day in Israel.
	   Jerusalem police remained on high alert, said spokeswoman Linda
Menuhin. Army radio said Palestinian security forces were
cooperating in the investigation.
	   There have been no major bombings in Israel in nearly a year. A
pair of suicide bombings last July 31 and Sept. 4 in downtown
Jerusalem killed 25 people, including five suicide bombers.

Embattled soccer coach survives in his post
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Hristo Bonev, Bulgaria's embattled soccer
coach, survived in his function Sunday despite his team's
disastrous performance at the World Cup finals in France.
	   At a closed-door meeting, Bulgaria's top soccer officials voted
12-0 to reelect Bonev, although he had earlier announced his
resignation.
	   ``Bonev will sign a four-year contract, it was a unanimous
decision,'' said Bulgaria's Soccer Union (BSU) spokesman Nikola
Ekserov.
	   Despite harsh criticism from the media and leading players,
soccer union president Ivan Slavkov proposed Bonev's reelection.
	   Bonev himself wouldn't comment.
	   He had declared he would quit after Bulgaria's 1-6 loss to Spain
in group D at the World Cup finals.
	   In earlier World Cup action, Bulgaria lost 0-1 to Nigeria and
played Paraguay to a scoreless draw.
	   With almost the same team, Bulgaria had finished fourth at the
1994 World Cup finals in the United States after beating previous
world champions Argentina and Germany.
	   Bonev succeeded Dimitar Penev in 1996 after Bulgaria's bleak
performance at the European Championship in England.

Bomb attempt fails hours before Israel-Palestinian talks

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A Palestinian man apparently tried to set off a
car bomb Sunday in the heart of Jerusalem only hours before the
first high-level talks in months between Israel and the
Palestinians, police said.
	   ``A terrible tragedy was averted,'' Jerusalem police chief Yair
Yitzhaki told reporters after anti-terrorism police arrested the
badly burned driver of what he said was a van packed with
``dangerous'' materials.
	   ``It has been definitely established that it was a car bomb,''
the police chief said. The city's main downtown thoroughfare was
closed for three hours while police searched for possible
accomplices and other bombs. Sunday is a regular business day in
Israel.
	   Israel radio cited senior officials as blaming the militant
Islamic group Hamas, but in the Gaza Strip, Hamas spokesman Mahmoud
Zahar said he had no knowledge of the attempted attack. ``Israel
puts the name of Hamas on everything,'' he said.
	   Yasser Arafat's spokesman Nabil Abourdeneh called the incident a
``phony act'' meant to mar Sunday evening's planned talks between
Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai and Yasser Arafat's
deputy Mahmoud Abbas.
	   The talks were being held at the urging of the United States,
which called on Israel and the Palestinians to negotiate directly
to resolve differences over a U.S. initiative calling for Israel to
withdraw from another 13 percent of the West Bank.
	   On Saturday, Palestinians said they would listen to what Israel
had to say, but would not renegotiate the American plan. Israel has
so far balked at the pullback proposal.
	   Palestinian chief negotiator Nabil Shaath said he thought the
meeting had only a ``very, very limited chance'' of success.
	   ``But for a chance of one percent we will go, because we don't
want to be told that we have wasted an opportunity,'' he told
reporters in the West Bank town of Ramallah.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the bomb attempt
illustrated Israel's security concerns, but that he wanted the
peace process to move ahead.
	   ``You saw that we had a car-bomb attempt in the middle of
Jerusalem, and thereby you can understand why we insist that the
Palestinians carry out their responsibilities, first of all in
fighting terrorism,'' he told reporters in Jerusalem. ``But at the
same time we are coming with an open mind and a desire to achieve
an agreement.''
	   Police spokesman Shmuel Ben-Ruby said the bombing was thwarted
when an off-duty Jerusalem policeman and a bus driver saw smoke
coming from a white van with front and back license plates that did
not match.
	   They smashed its windows, pulled out the burned driver and
called for help. Anti-terrorist police quickly arrived and
determined it was a car bomb, said Jerusalem police chief Yair
Yitzhaki.
	   Israel radio said components for detonating a bomb were found,
but police did not confirm that. The police chief also refused to
specify what materials were found in the van, but members of the
bomb squad were seen removing more than a dozen cans of
unidentified fluid and a pair of small gas tanks.
	   Yitzhaki said the fire may have broken out as the driver was
attempting to detonate the bomb. The driver, who was identified
only as being an Arab from the Palestinian lands, was hospitalized
under heavy guard with serious burns.
	   He was not conscious and thus could not be questioned, Yitzhaki
told reporters. There was no immediate word on any other arrests.
	   There have been no major bombings in Israel in nearly a year. A
pair of suicide bombings last July 31 and Sept. 4 in downtown
Jerusalem killed 25 people, including five suicide bombers.

One killed, one wounded in fight over Yemen mosque
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ One person was killed and another wounded in
a fight over control of a mosque, witnesses said Sunday.
	   The fight broke out Saturday in front of the Athrub mosque in
the capital San`a between rival Muslim groups vying to run the
mosque, they said.
	   The victim died in crossfire when the rival armed groups,
affiliated with the Islah and Al-Haq Islamic parties, started
shooting at each other, said one witness, who spoke on condition of
anonymity. Another was wounded, he said.
	   He said the fighters, who numbered about a dozen, ran away when
police came.
	   Police refused to discuss details of the incident, but confirmed
that they had closed down the mosque and had launched an
investigation.
	   The Islah and Al-Haq parties have been feuding for years over
control of the country's mosques.

German team finds ships believed to date from Thirty Years' War
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SCHLESWIG, Germany (AP) _ Following up on a 139-year-old tip,
archaeologists have found nine shipwrecks dating from the 17th
century buried in mud at a Baltic Sea inlet in northern Germany.
	   The 30- to 50-foot (9- to 15-meter) to boats are believed to be
from a military fleet that sank during the Thirty Years' War, a
series of political and religious conflicts in Europe from 1618 to
1648.
	   The team was led to the find by a note written in 1859 and found
in the state's museum archives, said Willi Kramer, head of the
Schleswig-Holstein state archaeology department.
	   In the note, royal surveyor Wilhelm von Sommer said that an
unusually violent storm on Feb. 11, 1859 drove water from the
Schlei inlet, near Schleswig, and partially uncovered a number of
old wrecks.
	   The archaeological team, which began searching in 1996, found
nine boats buried under about six feet (1.8 meters) of mud in the
inlet. Kramer said Thursday that he did not rule out finding more
boats in the area.
	   The exact age of the ships is to be confirmed only after they
are excavated from the inlet, Kramer said.

Polish parliament approves health reform legislation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Parliament's lower house has approved
legislation to introduce competition in Poland's inefficient health
care system and shift its funding away from the national budget.
	   The bill approved late Saturday in the Sejm represents a first
major step toward overhauling Polish health care in the
post-communist era. It also needs approval from the upper house and
the president.
	   The legislation would set up patient funds that would be
financed directly by 7.5 percent of employees' incomes. Industries
with more than 500,000 employees would set up their own funds, and
municipalities would run the funds for everyone else.
	   Patients would be able to choose a doctor and hospital for their
care, and the fund management would solicit contracts for health
services on their behalf.
	   With doctors and hospitals competing for contracts, the quality
of Poland's health sector is expected to improve. It currently is
considered inefficient and corrupt.
	   ``Doctors will scramble for patients,'' said Health Minister
Wojciech Maksymowicz, who added that the legislation was ``a key''
to reforming Poland's health care.
	   Health care is currently financed by social security
contributions and national budget allocations, but those
allocations have been squeezed in recent years by other needs.
	   The new health care system, which would take effect Jan. 1, is
one of the major goals of the Solidarity-dominated government voted
into power last September.

Embattled Bulgarian soccer coach holds onto his job

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Hristo Bonev, Bulgaria's embattled soccer
coach, hung onto his job Sunday despite his team's disastrous
performance at the World Cup finals in France.
	   At a closed-door meeting, Bulgaria's top soccer officials voted
12-0 to reelect Bonev, although he had announced his resignation.
	   ``Bonev will sign a four-year contract, it was a unanimous
decision,'' said Bulgarian Soccer Union spokesman Nikola Ekserov.
	   Despite harsh criticism from the media and leading players,
Soccer Union president Ivan Slavkov proposed Bonev's reelection.
	   Bonev himself wouldn't comment.
	   He had declared he would quit after Bulgaria's 1-6 loss to Spain
in group D at the World Cup finals.
	   In earlier World Cup action, Bulgaria lost 0-1 to Nigeria and
played Paraguay to a scoreless draw.
	   With almost the same team, Bulgaria finished fourth at the 1994
World Cup finals in the United States after beating previous world
champions Argentina and Germany.
	   Bonev succeeded Dimitar Penev in 1996 after Bulgaria's bleak
performance at the European Championship in England.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A Palestinian man apparently tried to set off a
car bomb Sunday in the heart of Jerusalem only hours before the
first high-level talks in months between Israel and the
Palestinians, police said.
	   ``A terrible tragedy was averted,'' Jerusalem police chief Yair
Yitzhaki told reporters after anti-terrorism police arrested the
badly burned driver of what he said was a van packed with
``dangerous'' materials.
	   ``It has been definitely established that it was a car bomb,''
the police chief said. The city's main downtown thoroughfare was
closed for three hours while police searched for possible
accomplices and other bombs. Sunday is a regular business day in
Israel.
	   Israel radio cited senior officials as blaming the militant
Islamic group Hamas, but in the Gaza Strip, Hamas spokesman Mahmoud
Zahar said he had no knowledge of the attempted attack. ``Israel
puts the name of Hamas on everything,'' he said.
	   Yasser Arafat's spokesman Nabil Abourdeneh called the incident a
``phony act'' meant to mar Sunday evening's planned talks between
Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai and Yasser Arafat's
deputy Mahmoud Abbas.
	   The talks were being held at the urging of the United States,
which called on Israel and the Palestinians to negotiate directly
to resolve differences over a U.S. initiative calling for Israel to
withdraw from another 13 percent of the West Bank.
	   On Saturday, Palestinians said they would listen to what Israel
had to say, but would not renegotiate the American plan. Israel has
so far balked at the pullback proposal.
	   Palestinian Cabinet minister Nabil Shaath said he thought the
meeting had only a ``very, very limited chance'' of success.

Chinese women win four golds on opening day of Asian Athletic meet

	   FUKUOKA, Japan (AP) _ Gu Yuan, a 16-year-old newcomer to hammer
throwing, broke the Asian record Sunday, helping China sweep the
four women's gold medals decided on the opening day of the Asian
Athletic Championships.
	   Kazakstan and Uzbekistan split the day's two men's golds.
	   On her third of five tries, Gu threw the hammer 61.86 meters,
breaking the Asian mark of 61.20 set by Japan's Aya Suzuki in 1989.
	   Suzuki finished second with 56.12, followed by compatriot Eriko
Kubota with 48.48.
	   ``I know it isn't quite close yet to the world record, but I'll
try to be closer to the world level in the next Olympics,'' said
Gu, a freshman at a Beijing college. The world mark stands at
73.10.
	   Gu said she shifted to hammer throw from shot put a year ago,
and puts in two three-hour training sessions daily.
	   ``I kind of like the sport because it's fun and action-packed to
turn and turn before throwing,'' she added.
	   The 30-year-old Suzuki said, ``I want to know myself how she
could make it,'' developing so quickly to break a 9-year-old Asian
record.
	   In the women's 5,000-meter race, Wang Chunmei surged ahead of
Japan's Masae Ueoka on the final lap and won in 15 minutes, 49.48
seconds.
	   Compatriot Liu Shixiang placed second in 15:53.76, followed by
Japan's Megumi Tanaka in 15:55.10. Ueoka slipped to fourth in
16:02.50.
	   ``I'm not quite satisfied with today's result,'' said Wang.
``Despite the heat and humidity here, I planned to run faster than
15:30.00.''
	   China also finished 1-2 in the women's long jump and shot put.
	   Guang Yingnan won the long jump with 6.83 meters, followed by
compatriot Yu Yiqun with 6.74.
	   Li Meisu beat compatriot Yu Juan 18.63 meters to 18.12 in the
shot put.
	   China is expected to dominate these four-day biennial
championships, in which 517 athletes from 38 countries and regions
are competing.
	   But the field also includes many athletes from newly independent
Central Asian states that formerly were part of the Soviet Union.
	   Among them, Kazakstan's Igor Potapovich missed an Asian record
of 5.90 meters but won the men's pole vault with 5.55. Teammate
Alexandr Korchagin took the silver medal with 5.40.
	   In the hammer throw, Uzbekistan's Andrey Abduvaliev won with
76.67 meters, followed by Japan's Koji Murofushi with 74.17.

	   PALERMO, Sicily (AP) _ Top seed Patty Schnyder claimed her WTA
tour-high fifth title of the season Sunday, battling past Barbara
Schett in three sets at the Palermo Grand Prix.
	   Schnyder dropped only her second set of the week at the dlrs
107,500 clay court event but held on for the 6-1, 5-7, 6-2 victory
over the fourth-seeded Schett in 1 hour, 33 minutes.
	   The win, which gives her one more title than No. 1 Martina
Hingis, will push Schnyder's WTA ranking into the top 10 for the
first time in her career.
	   The Swiss 19-year-old, who was ranked 11th heading into the
Palermo tourney, had never captured an event before 1998.
	   Schnyder and Schett teamed up after the singles final to go
after the doubles trophy, but the pair, seeded first, lost to No. 4
seeds Pavlina Stoyanova of Bulgaria and Elena Wagner of Germany,
6-4, 6-2.

<TEXT>
	   A CORUNA, Spain (AP) _ World No. 4 Carlos Moya won Spain a place
in the Davis Cup semifinals by downing Marc Rosset of Switzerland
on Sunday in straight sets.
	   The reigning French Open champion struggled a little before
winning the first set 7-5 and getting into his stride to take the
second set 6-1.
	   Rosset, 1992 Olympic champion, managed a limited comeback in the
third set, but could not prevent Moya from winning 7-5 and sealing
victory for himself, his team and his country.
	   Spain goes to the semifinals in September, to meet either
Germany or defending champion Sweden, secure of the quality of its
singles stars but a little doubtful when it comes to doubles.
	   On Saturday the Swiss duo, Rosset and Lorenzo Manta beat the
Spanish pair Julian Alonso and Javier Sanchez Vicario in a five set
marathon.
	   With Spain leading Switzerland 3-1, the outcome of the final
match of the quarterfinal tie, pitting Spaniard Alex Corretja
against Swiss Ivo Heuberger later Sunday, will not change the
overall result.

 &UR; ST. KITTS AND NEVIS: Officials plans first hanging in 13 years &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BASSETERRE, St. Kitts and Nevis (AP) _ The Caribbean nation of
St. Kitts and Nevis plans to hang a convicted murderer on Monday,
joining a regional backlash against international pressure to ban
the death penalty.
	   The hanging of David Wilson, 28, for the 1994 murder of a hotel
night watchman will be the twin-island country's first execution in
13 years. Officials confirmed Saturday that Governor-General
Cuthbert Sebastian had signed the required execution notice.
	   St. Kitts and Nevis, along with other former British colonies,
has come under increasing pressure from British courts and human
rights groups to stop executions.
	   Caribbean nations say the death penalty is needed as a deterrent
to crime caused by drug traffic through the region.
	   Wilson and another man, Clement Thomas, were convicted in 1996
of beating night watchman Kenneth Herbert to death at Ottley's
Plantation Inn on St. Kitts.
 &UR; PUERTO RICO: Guerrilla says group planted two bombs during strike
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ A fugitive guerrilla leader said
his group planted bombs at banks during a strike by Puerto Rican
telephone workers, but he denied responsibility for one that
wounded a police officer.
	   Filiberto Ojeda Rios, the leader of the pro-independence
People's Boricua Army, claimed responsibility during a taped
interview transmitted on WKAQ-AM radio Saturday.
	   He said the group planted two bombs at San Juan area branches of
Banco Popular, which has joined U.S. telecommunications giant GTE
Corp. in a dlrs 1.9 billion deal to privatize the state-owned
Puerto Rico Telephone Co.
	   The signing of the deal touched off weeks of bombings, sabotage
and an island-wide strike. On Saturday, an unconfirmed report in
the El Nuevo Dia newspaper said Spanish company Telefonica
Internacional SA had offered to best GTE's deal by dlrs 200
million.
	   Ojeda's group is also known as the Macheteros, or
``cane-cutters.'' It carried out a wave of bombings and attacks on
U.S. government installations during the 1970s and 1980s.
 &UR; CUBA: Flotilla commemorates 41 drowning victims
	   IN THE FLORIDA STRAITS (AP) _ Cuban exiles floating within view
of the Havana skyline flashed signals ashore Saturday, tossed
flowers and crosses into the ocean and prayed for Cubans who died
fleeing Fidel Castro's rule.
	   ``I believe they're in a better place,'' said Maggie Aguiar, 55,
of Miami. ``In trying to find freedom, death was the liberation for
them.''
	   She was on one of four boats that made their way to the edge of
Cuban waters to memorialize 41 refugees who died four years earlier
when their tugboat was rammed by Cuban government vessels.
	   Midway through the ceremony, planes buzzed overhead, dropping
smoke canisters that trailed plumes about 3,000 feet long in memory
of four Brothers to the Rescue pilots who were shot down in
February 1996.
	   The flotilla, organized by exile group Democracy Movement,
tossed 41 floating crosses and hundreds of pink and white roses and
carnations at a site about 12 miles (19 kilometers) from Havana to
remember the those who died when the tugboat 13 de Marzo sank.
 &UR; GUYANA: Government hikes wages for public workers
	   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) _ Wages for about 12,200 Guyanese
government employees will rise between 13.5 percent and 30 percent
under a new labor agreement, the government announced Saturday.
	   Cabinet Secretary Roger Luncheon and representatives of the
Guyana Public Service Union signed a deal Friday that hikes wages
for the lowest-paid workers from about dlrs 59 (Guyanese dlrs 8800)
to dlrs 76 (Guyanese dlrs 11,445) a month.
	   Workers in the highest of the government's 14 pay scales will
see their wages rise from a minimum of about dlrs 541 (Guyanese
dlrs 81,200) to dlrs 612 (Guyanese dlrs 91,753), the government
said in a news release Saturday.
	   Employees will also receive a 9.5 percent raise retroactive to
Jan. 1.
 &UR; U.S. VIRGIN ISLANDS: Tourist beach may hold ruins of Indian chief's
house
	   ST. JOHN, U.S. Virgin Islands (AP) _ A hunk of pottery dug up by
a vacationing college student suggests an Indian chief's house once
stood on one of the most popular beaches in the U.S. Caribbean.
	   Archaeologists said Saturday the shard from Cinnamon Bay on the
island of St. John shows a ``zemi,'' a god worshipped by the Taino,
a pre-Colombian Indian tribe. Only Taino nobles were allowed to
have such figures in their homes.
	   ``It represented prestige,'' said archaeologist Sharon Fulcome.
``It represented social hierarchy, even fertility. So it's an
interesting symbol and leads us to believe that we have found
perhaps the chief's house.''
	   The fragment was hidden under about 20 centimeters (8 inches) of
sand on Cinnamon Bay beach. It was found by Destin Schnell, a Texas
A and M University student who had volunteered to work on an
archaeological dig at the site.

New round of peace talks set to begin as cease-fire date
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ARUSHA, Tanzania (AP) _ Reports of continued fighting between
Burundi's mainly Tutsi army and Hutu rebels appeared likely to marr
the opening of the second round of all-party peace talks on
Burundi.
	   A nationwide cease-fire was supposed to accompany the talks
scheduled to begin Monday in this northern Tanzanian town.
	   Last month, representatives of the government of President
Pierre Buyoya, political parties and the main Hutu rebel movement
agreed to settle their differences by peaceful means _ and to
observe a cease-fire from July 20.
	   The June gathering marked the first time Buyoya, who took power
in a coup in July 1996, agreed to join the talks, which were also
attended by former Interior Minister Leonard Nyangoma, head of the
National Council for the Defense of Democracy (CNDD), whose armed
wing is fighting the Burundi army.
	   But Brussels-based members of the CNDD claim Nyangoma no longer
speaks for the group, even though he is recognized by former
Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere, who is mediating the talks.
	   Last week Burundi's Minister for Peace and Reconciliation
Ambroise Niyonsaba held preparatory talks with Nyerere, but no
details of the discussion were available.
	   The Tanzanian, whom Buyoya has criticized as being too close to
the Hutus, has been trying to get all parties in the tiny central
African nation to sit down to talks since October 1993 when Tutsi
paratroopers killed the country's first Hutu president. The
assasination led to widespread violence or reprisal and thousands
of deaths.
	   Six days after the July 1996 coup, countries in the region
slapped an economic and transport boycott on Burundi in an attempt
to get Buyoya to restore the democratic process and talk to rebels.
	   Buyoya, a retired officer who served as president from 1989 to
1993, claimed he alone could stop the bloodshed that has resulted
in at least 200,000 deaths, most of them civilian. An estimated
600,000 people have been driven from their homes.
	   Since the beginning of the year, Buyoya's government has moved
to establish a transition process and, with the agreement of
political parties, has enlarged the national assembly from 81 to
121 seats.
	   Buyoya says Burundi has complied with regional demands and that
the sanctions should thus be lifted.
	   Kenya, the largest economy in the region, has called for a
relaxation of some sanctions. Even Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni, who has taken a hard line on Burundi, appeared to be
considering softening his position when he sent an envoy to meet
with Buyoya last week.
	   But attacks by Hutu rebels and clashes with government troops
have continued, and it was unclear Sunday whether the cease-fire
would take hold.
	   Despite general agreement that Burundi's conflicts should be
settled by peaceful means, the government says it should not be
considered a party in any cease-fire since it argued that the
army's role was to defend citizens.

	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ The Greek Cypriot government on Sunday
accused Turkey of ``threatening peace'' by sending six warships and
an aerobatics squadron to the Turkish-occupied north of the island.
	   The air and naval units were dispatched to participate in the
weeklong Turkish Cypriot celebrations beginning Monday to mark the
24th anniversary of Turkey's invasion of the island.
	   The Turks invaded to protect the Turkish Cypriot minority
following an abortive coup by Greek Cypriots who support union with
Greece.
	   A breakaway Turkish Cypriot state established in the north is
recognized only by Ankara, which maintains 35,000 troops there.
	   A seven-jet Turkish squadron is to perform a show of precision
flying, and the six warships will be on display.

Senator accuses president of siding with friends
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ A Senator complained Sunday that
in crucial moments, President Vaclav Havel often loses his
impartiality and sides with his friends.
	   ``Especially before elections, he often fails to keep his role
of a non-partisan president and engages himself on the side of his
favorites,'' Senator Milan Kondr, member of the Civic Democratic
Party of former Premier Vaclav Klaus, said on private NOVA
television Sunday.
	   ``The problem is not against whom this is aimed, the problem is
in whose favor it is _ and it's always his friends,'' Kondr said.
	   In a televised interview just three days before early elections
last month, Havel refused to ally himself with either left or right
but named several ministers of the caretaker government then in
power - which he played a large part in forming - as an example of
young politicians who meet his standards.
	   Kondr also criticized Havel for televised remarks accusing his
party of trying to topple him.
	   Last Sunday, Havel accused the Civic Democratic Party of
planning his ouster, purportedly on charges of high treason. He
referred to ``second-hand information'' but gave no source.
	   ``The Civic Democratic Party never considered recalling the
president,'' Kondr said, adding he does not know whether it was the
president or his source who lied about it.
	   Havel and the Civic Democratic Party have been at odds since
Klaus was accused last November of accepting dubious party
donations.

Europe's top clubs reportedly meet to discuss breakaway league
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The owners of several of Europe's top soccer clubs
reportedly met in secret Sunday with a view to forming their own
breakaway Super League in the 2000-2001 season.
	   According to reports in Germany and England, the main movers
behind the idea were powerhouses AC and Inter Milan, Juventus, Real
Madrid, FC Barcelona, Paris St. Germain, Ajax Amsterdam, Manchester
United and Bayern Munich.
	   The Sunday edition of the German publication Bild reported that
Bayern Munich's vice president, Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, and general
manager Uli Hoeness flew to the gathering.
	   The meeting apparently was somewhere in London but, according to
the Sunday Telegraph, it was so secret that the clubs wouldn't even
admit it was taking place.
	   The Premier League, which runs the 20-club top flight in
England, said it knew of no such meeting. ``It sounds like another
bout of speculation,'' said a spokesman.
	   The idea of a Super League, which would effectively undermine
UEFA's own competitions, has been around for two decades.
	   The reports said that the richest clubs would prefer the concept
of playing each other on a regular and lucrative basis rather than
travelling to remote eastern European locations to play first round
elimination games which attract very little revenue.
	   Aware of what damage it would do to the Champions Cup, UEFA has
already taken steps to try and stop a Super League taking shape.
	   Four seasons ago it changed the format to bring in a group
structure at the mid-point of the competition and even went as far
as changing the name of the tournament to Champions League.
	   To make it more attractive to the big clubs, UEFA then altered
the rules so that runners up in the high profile leagues also would
take part. That opened up the prospect of the Champions Cup being
won by a team that wasn't a champion.
	   The latest move is to change the league format from six groups
of four to four groups of six to ensure even more matches and make
it even more of a league structure.
	   After the group stage, the competition reverts to the knockout
formula from the quarterfinal onwards.

Hick recalled, Flintoff may debut against South Africa
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Stewart named as one-day captain &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Veteran Graeme Hick is recalled after two years
and Andrew Flintoff is included for a possible debut as England,
1-0 down in the series, makes changes for the fourth test against
South Africa starting Thursday.
	   In another move by the selectors Sunday, test captain Alec
Stewart was named as replacement for Adam Hollioake to lead the
one-day team in a triangular series against South Africa and Sri
Lanka in August. Hollioake had mixed results in the 12 games he was
in charge and has lost his place on the test team.
	   Alarmed that England only just avoided going 2-0 down by
salvaging a draw from the game at Old Trafford, the England
selectors have decided to make changes to the test bowling attack
too.
	   Leg-spinner Ian Salisbury and left-arm paceman Alan Mullally
also are recalled to a 13-man squad for the match at Trent Bridge.
	   Hick, who has played 46 times for England but has been unabled
to carry his standout county form for Worcestershire into the test
arena, replaced injured Surrey batsman Graham Thorpe, who is
sidelined with persistent back trouble.
	   Opener Mark Butcher returns after injury to replace Nick Knight
and 20-year-old Flintoff, who has excelled for Lancashire with the
bat, may have to wait for his debut.
	   Knight, Ashley Giles, Ben Hollioake, Dean Headley and the
injured Thorpe are the five players dropped from the squad of 13
chosen for Old Trafford.
	   Squad:
	   Michael Atherton, Mark Butcher, Nasser Hussain, Alec Stewart,
Mark Ramprakash, Graeme Hick, Andrew Flintoff, Dominic Cork, Robert
Croft, Ian Salisbury, Darren Gough, Angus Fraser, Alan Mullally.

Bangladesh floods maroon 8 million, worse feared ahead

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Flooding in Bangladesh has claimed 82
lives, marooned over 8 million people and damaged hundreds of
thousands of acres of standing crops, but the worst is yet to come,
a government expert said Sunday.
	   Newspapers reported 10 more deaths Sunday from three districts,
taking the death toll in a week's flooding to 82. Over 8 million
people are living in makeshift houses or relief camps across the
country, reports said.
	   But a senior official at the Relief Ministry confirmed only 32
deaths and said nearly four and a half million people had been
affected in 25 districts across the country.
	   A senior meteorological official said there would no immediate
relief from the fury of the Ganges, which flows into Bangladesh
from neighboring India.
	   ``The Ganges basin in Bangladesh is bracing for a wave of
devastating flood with heavy monsoon rainfall continuing in the
upper catchment of the river in Nepal and India,'' Ishad Hossain,
director of the Bangladesh Meteorological Department, told The
Associated Press.
	   Some 300 feet of the flood protection embankment of the Gumti
river was washed away Friday and Saturday, flooding areas in the
Comilla district in eastern Bangladesh, officials said.
	   Millions of flood victims are struggling with a shortage of dry
food, drinking water and life saving drugs, newspaper reports said.
The Bangladesh Observer on Sunday reported an outbreak of
water-borne diseases in the flood-hit areas where little medical
assistance was available for the victims.
	   The low lying areas in capital Dhaka, a city of nine million,
are submerged as three rivers in and around the city _ the
Buriganga, Turag and Sitalhayia _ are flooded. An official at the
Communication Ministry Sunday said the flood waters had caused
massive damage to road and railway communication systems.

Israel's Sharon meets Chinese officials
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Israeli Infrastructure Minister Ariel Sharon
visited Beijing Sunday, just days after China's premier criticized
Israel for refusing to pull out of the West Bank.
	   Sharon, a hard-line critic of the Middle East peace process, met
Chinese Vice Premier Wen Jiabao and Construction Minister Yu
Zhengsheng Sunday for talks on technical cooperation, the official
Xinhua News Agency reported.
	   His visit follows a friendly meeting between Chinese Premier Zhu
Rongji and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat last week in Beijing.
Zhu told Arafat that China backed the Palestinians' ``just cause,''
and said Israel was wrong to reject a U.S. plan calling for Israeli
withdrawal from 13 percent of the West Bank.
	   Sharon strongly opposes that deal, saying withdrawal from more
than 9 percent of the territory would harm Israel's security. He
warned Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last week that
right-wing members of his coalition would abandon him and bring
down the government if Netanyahu accepted the U.S. proposal.
	   China has long been a strong supporter of the Palestinian cause,
but over the past decade has developed good diplomatic and strong
economic ties with Israel.

Report: Nigerian military leader to announce transition plan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) _ Nigeria's new military ruler will unveil
his highly-anticipated plan Monday to embark on a transition to
democracy, a newspaper reported Sunday.
	   Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar has decided upon a program ``in the
best interests of the nation,'' the head of state's chief press
secretary David Attah was quoted as saying by the Lagos Guardian
paper.
	   The plan is to be announced in a national broadcast by the
military leader on television and radio Monday evening, the
newspaper said. Nigeria's new military ruler has been promising for
several weeks to announce his transition program, but has hedged on
the timing.
	   ``The government is a listening one,'' Attah said. ``The nation
should rest assured that all the various issues touching on the
survival of the nation will be addressed.''
	   Attah did not elaborate on the plan and did not say whether
Abubakar had agreed to demands by leaders in southern Nigeria for a
government of national unity involving a broad spectrum of
political groups.
	   ``It would be unwise for me to predict the head of state's
address but if there would be a government of national unity or
not, the head of state will tell the nation,'' Attah was quoted as
saying.
	   Since taking power after the late dictator Gen. Sani Abacha died
in early June, Abubakar has promised democracy to this West African
nation which has been ruled by military governments for most of its
38 years as an independent state.
	   While dozens of political prisoners jailed under Abacha's
five-year rule have been released, the country's most prominent
detainee, Moshood Abiola, died of an apparent heart failure in
prison earlier this month.
	   Abiola was the apparent winner of presidential elections in 1993
that were annulled by the military before he could take office.
	   Abiola's death sparked several days of rioting and triggered
suspicions that the ruling military junta may have poisoned the
high-profile prisoner.
	   The preliminary findings of an independent autopsy by Western
doctors indicates he died of a heart attack.
	   Western governments which shunned Nigeria under Abacha, who
often jailed his opponents and on occasion had them put to death,
have begun cautiously restoring ties with Abubakar's government in
anticipation of democratic reforms.

Ruling party wins local elections in Mozambique
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) _ The ruling party scored a sweeping
victory in the country's first democratic local elections, but the
vote was marked by apathy with only a 15-percent turnout, according
to official results.
	   The ruling FRELIMO party won in all 33 municipalities in the
June 30 vote. The former rebel movement RENAMO boycotted the polls,
claiming irregularities in voting procedures.
	   Among the victors were Artur Canana, the incumbent FRELIMO mayor
of Maputo, the capital. Canana won 65 percent of votes cast,
leading independent candidate Phillip Gagnaux who won 29 percent,
according to the results which were announced Friday night.
	   Mozambique, a former Portuguese colony in southeast Africa,
emerged from 16 years of civil war in 1992. The former foes,
FRELIMO _ an acronym for the Mozambique Liberation Movement, and
RENAMO _ which stands for the Mozambican Resistance Movement _
contested the first democratic national elections in 1994.
	   President Joaquim Chissano's socialist FRELIMO government has 55
percent of seats in parliament. RENAMO holds the remainder.
	   Until the June 30 local election, FERELIMO had appointed the
local governments in the 33 municipalities.

U.N. envoy travels, briefly and in secrecy, to East Timor

	   BAUCAU, Indonesia (AP) _ In a swift, secretive trip that
highlighted the tensions that reign in East Timor, a U.N. envoy
flew to the disputed territory Sunday aboard an Indonesian military
plane for talks with key players in the decades-old conflict.
	   Despite calls to stay away from the former Portuguese colony for
fear the visit could trigger fresh violence, U.N. mediator Jamsheed
Marker met with clergy, student leaders, former separatist
guerrillas and Indonesian-appointed local officials.
	   ``Regardless of the shade of opinion, there is a desire for a
peaceful settlement as early as possible,'' Marker said at a news
conference after the flurry of unannounced meetings.
	   However, East Timor has been so shaken by violence since last
month that Marker spent only a few hours there before flying out on
the C-130 transport plane that ferried him from the tourist island
of Bali.
	   And he flouted expectations that he would visit East Timor's
seaside capital of Dili, choosing instead the poor coastal town of
Baucau, where he remained cloistered in an airport building as
selected East Timorese loitered outside, awaiting their turn to
speak.
	   In the exchanges, some of which lasted only 10 minutes, Marker
heard arguments for a vote on independence and an opposing view
that favors autonomy while maintaining Indonesian authority.
	   Indonesia invaded the territory of 800,000 people in 1975 and
annexed it a year later. Tens of thousand of people died in
fighting and of famine and disease, and several hundred rebels
still roam the hills, enjoying wide support among the civilian
population.
	   But the resignation of authoritarian President Suharto in May
and the democratic changes that have swept Indonesia under his
successor, B.J. Habibie, have pushed along negotiations for a
solution that had stagnated for years.
	   Marker said the foreign ministers of Indonesia and Portugal,
which advocates an independence vote in East Timor, will meet Aug.
4-5 in New York under the auspices of the United Nations. He urged
the Indonesian military as well as East Timorese to show restraint
and step up dialogue.
	   ``You don't have to break a man's head to convince him you're
right,'' said Marker, who planned to leave Indonesia Wednesday
after a weeklong trip. ``The time for slogans is over.''
	   In recent weeks, Indonesian soldiers have shot and killed two
pro-independence demonstrators during protests staged to impress
three visiting European ambassadors. Thousands of immigrant workers
have fled East Timor on buses, boats and planes, complaining of
harassment by indigenous residents.
	   The Indonesian government and East Timor's Nobel peace laureate,
Bishop Carlos Belo, had urged Marker not to visit East Timor. When
he last went in 1997, security forces killed two protesters
involved in a rally outside the Dili hotel where he was staying.
	   The secrecy of Marker's trip apparently paid off: there were no
reports of rallies or political violence Sunday in East Timor. And
the mix of pro- and anti-independence community leaders made for an
unusual gathering of clashing viewpoints.
	   ``This is a miracle,'' said Belo, a participant.
	   Still, major obstacles remain. Habibie has offered to grant a
degree of autonomy and free the territory's jailed rebel leader,
Xanana Gusmao, in exchange for international recognition that
Indonesia controls East Timor.
	   Pro-independence activists say they will settle for nothing less
than a vote on self-determination, possibly after five years or so
to lay the groundwork for a referendum.
	   Basilio Araujo, a local government official who favors autonomy,
said he warned the U.N. envoy to beware of advocates who claim to
represent the majority of East Timorese. Seventy-five percent of
East Timorese, he said, are farmers who know little about politics.
	   ``We have a silent mass,'' Araujo said. ``Do not sacrifice these
people just for our own personal interests.''

Appeal Court rescinds ban imposed on newspaper for woman picture
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ The Appeal Court rescinded Sunday a one-week ban
imposed on a Kuwaiti newspaper for publishing a picture of a woman

	   But the court upheld a 100-dinar (dlrs 326) fine against the

last month in a case brought by a private citizen.

``excellent'' and said it was final.

decency.''
	   Al-Jumaili said the defense team had argued that the law did not
define what constitutes a violation.
	   Kuwaiti newspapers sometimes superimpose clothes on pictures of
women wearing swim suits or revealing dresses.
	   Last month the Court of First Instance also sentenced the editor
of another daily, Al-Qabas, to six months in prison for publishing
a cartoon deemed insulting to Islam.
	   It was the first time an editor had been sentenced to prison in
Kuwait, which has one of the freest media in the region. The
editor, Mohammed al-Saqar, is appealing.
	   In the cartoon, a teacher asks his students: ``Why did God kick
out Adam and Eve from heaven?'' A student answers: ``Because they
hadn't paid the rent.''
	   Muslim fundamentalist legislators complained about the joke to
the Information Ministry, which took the newspaper to court.

 &UR; French Health Minister urges debate on drugs in sports &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The French health minister on Sunday recommended
debate on the use of performance-enhancing drugs by athletes, as
the fabled Tour de France sought to rebound from a doping scandal.
	   ``We should all together debate what is lawful and what is not
lawful,'' Kouchner said in an interview with France Info radio.
	   Kouchner, whose father was a doctor on the Tour de France 30
years ago, reminded reminded listeners that alcohol had been used
to improve performances by cyclists on the Tour and that in the
past deaths had resulted from that practice.
	   ``Ever since there has been cycle racing there has been doping.
And since the show has become more and more profitable, there is
more and more doping,'' said Kouchner.
	   Calling the cyclists ``slaves,'' Kouchner blamed sponsors,
newspapers, media and companies for pushing the riders into drugs
to achieve performances that would be impossible without them.
	   ``It's a commercial enterprise,'' Kouchner said referring to the
Tour.
	   The director of the Tour de France on Friday kicked out the
Festina team from this year's race because of a doping scandal.
Three team officials are under investigation for procuring
performance-enhancing drugs.

	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ A Turkish Airlines plane bound for
Dusseldorf, Germany, was forced to return to Istanbul airport
shortly after takeoff Sunday because of an engine failure, an
airport official said.
	   The Airbus A 310 with about 200 passengers on board, dumped fuel
and made an emergency landing 10 minutes after take off, the
official said on condition of anonymity.
	   No one was injured and passengers were placed on another plane.
	   It was the second time in a week the same plane developed engine
trouble. On Friday, while bound for Ankara with 175 passengers, the
aircraft made an emergency landing at Istanbul after a small
explosion in its left engine. No one was hurt.

<TEXT>
	   ZAMBOANGA, Philippines (AP) _ Police set up checkpoints in
southern Zamboanga city Sunday night after armed men abducted a son
of an army sergeant, the third kidnapping in the city in recent
weeks.
	   Police said armed men in a van blocked a motorcycle ridden by
Joel Esteban, 17, and two friends about a kilometer (half-mile)
from the headquarters of the military's Southern Command.
	   Esteban's two friends were left unharmed when the men took away
the teen-ager, the son of an army sergeant assigned to the
command's operations center.
	   Two wealthy traders were separately abducted in Zamboanga in May
and June and were freed unharmed after their families paid ransom.
	   A police investigator said there has been no ransom demand for
Esteban's release and they were determining whether the abduction
was connected to his father's work.
	   Despite government crackdowns, ransom kidnappings have persisted
in many areas in the Philippines.

	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Warships from the U.S. Sixth Fleet,
Turkey, Ukraine, Italy and Bulgaria met Sunday along Blgaria's
Black Sea coast for an exercise meant to raise cooperation between
navies of NATO members and countries seeking membership.
	   Participants in the exercise, dubbed ``Breeze '98'', were to
simulate a humanitarian operation in a crisis region, the state
news agency BTA said.
	   The drill was under NATO's Partnership for Peace Program, which
allows former Soviet bloc countries to establish closer military
ties with the western alliance.
	   Bulgaria, a member of the program, was not among the first batch
of countries invited to joint NATO, which includes the Czech
Republic, Hungary and Poland.

Poll: More than a third of eastern German youth support fringe

parties &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ More than a third of young voters in
eastern Germany support the former communists or radical-rightist
parties for the Sept. 27 national elections, said a poll released
Sunday.
	   The poll of eastern Germans aged 18 to 24 by the Munich
Institute for Youth Study was released in an advance copy of Focus
magazine's Monday edition.
	   The results correspond with concerns among western German
politicians that easterners are increasingly turning toward fringe
parties on the left and right.
	   Many easterners are disgruntled with the slow pace of economic
development in their region; Chancellor Helmut Kohl promised that
the former East Germany would blossom after the 1990 reunification.
	   The poll of 1,000 young easterners showed that 20 percent backed
the former communists, the Party of Democratic Socialism. Ten
percent backed the anti-foreigner German People's Union, and 6
percent supported the neo-Nazi Republicans party. The poll had a
margin of error of about three percentage points.
	   In April state elections in eastern Saxony-Anhalt _ considered a
an election-year bellwether for the mood in eastern Germany _ the
former communists and extreme-right parties together scored about
30 percent of the vote.

New Zealand beats Australia for Super Max 8s title
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ A late boundary carried New
Zealand to a one-run victory over Australia on Sunday and the
championship of the three-day Super Max 8s cricket tournament.
	   New Zealand came out ahead 99 to 98, scoring the winning runs in
the last over.
	   Australia, champion in 1996 and 1997, suffered from loose
batting, losing three wickets for just 21 runs in the early stages.
	   This badly upset their rhythm and they fell to all out for 98
runs, their lowest total in all three years of the tournament.
	   Andrew Symonds was Australia's top scorer with 22 runs off 10
balls. Damien Martyn had 19, Garvin Robertson 16 not out and Damien
Fleming 14 not out.
	   Chris Drum took 2-31 and Nathan Astle 2-13.
	   In the New Zealand innings, Robertson returned figures of 3-11.
But New Zealand got 36 from Matthew Horne and 21 from Craig
Spearman.
	   In other games, South Africa beat India and New Zealand defeated
Pakistan.
	   South Africa batted first and scored 140 runs off the allotted
14 overs. Morne Van Wyk led scoring with an unbeaten 75 off 44
deliveries. His innings included six fours and two sixes.
	   Skipper Dave Callaghan was next with 40 off 20 balls. He hit
three fours and a six.
	   Sunil Joshi, a left-arm spinner, bowled best for India, taking
two for 13 in his three overs.
	   The Indian innings were boosted by Rohan Gavaskar, whose
unbeaten 66 included four boundaries and a six.
	   With the departure of skipper Robin Singh, who scored 21, the
challenge fizzled out and the Indians found themselves six runs
short of the target.
	   Against Pakistan, New Zealand scored 150 runs, mainly through
the efforts of Chris Harris, who achieved 71 before being bowled by
Shahid Afridi after facing 27 balls.
	   Matthew Horne weighed in with 38 runs off 23 balls.
	   Abdul Razzaq took three wickets for the loss of 15 runs.
	   Afridi gave the Pakistanis a good start with 41 runs off 25
balls. But generally the other batsmen found runs hard to get and
fell short by seven at the end.

Cambodian police kill suspected kidnapper
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Police shot and killed an alleged
kidnapper Sunday in central Phnom Penh after he threatened to kill
his 23-year-old hostage, police officials said.
	   Yin Chhoeun, the son of a Ministry of Posts and
Telecommunications official, was the most recent victim in a spate
of kidnappings targeting wealthy families that are spreading fear
through Phnom Penh.
	   The university student, who escaped injury, was abducted by a
gang of fellow classmates Friday and taken to a rented apartment,
said the deputy chief of the Phnom Penh municipal police, Ek Kret.
	   One of the kidnappers made several calls to the victim's family
Sunday demanding a dlrs 150,000 ransom, Ek Kret said.
	   ``The kidnapper called twice and said if the money did not
arrive within 48 hours, Yin Chhoeun would be killed,'' said a
district police inspector who was working on the case.
	   Police discovered and surrounded the hideout Sunday and opened
fire, killing one gang member and wounding another. A third escaped
and two others were arrested, said Neth Sovoeurn, municipal police
commissioner.
	   Last week, the government set up a new commission to fight a
wave of kidnappings that have terrorized well-to-do families, many
of whom are frightened to leave their homes.

	   The four-time world champion finished the 108.748 kilometer race
in 46 minutes, 00.876 seconds. It was the 130th grand prix race of
his career.
	   Italy's Max Biaggi finished second in 46:00.876 on a windy
circuit that Doohan and others criticized for poor visibility
before the race. Spain's Alex Criville on a Honda was third in
46:12.255.
	   ``I didn't get off to a good start. I knew it would be hard to
pass someone on this track,'' said Biaggi.
	   The Australian, seeking his fifth world title, built his lead in
the overall standings over Biaggio with 160 to 148 for the Italian.
Criville is third with 142.
	   ``I knew Biaggi would be strong, but I was consistent today,''
said Doohan, who rode to his fourth win this season.
	   Simon Cravar, riding a Yamaha, crashed out of the race. The New
Zealander had broken Honda's streak of 22 straight wins in the
class at the British Grand Prix.
	   In the 250 cc race, Japan's Tetsuya Hara led from start to
finish on his Aprilia, covering the 105.24 kilomers in 44.43.421.
Britain's Jeremy McWilliams, riding a Honda, was second and 9.033
seconds behind.
	   Japan's Tomomi Manako won the 101.732 kilometer 125 cc race on
his Honda in 44:37.947, while runaway points leader Kazuto Sakata
of Japan was seventh on a Yamaha.

Mount Merapi's activities reported entering critical stage
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Authorities were preparing for
possible evacuation of nearby residents after a volcano spewed heat
clouds as far as five miles (8 kilometers) Sunday, a news report
said.
	   Two observation posts near Mount Merapi reported large
quantities of heat clouds from the volcano for about one hour
Sunday, the official Antara news agency said.
	   There have been no reports of casualties so far, Antara said.
	   It said authorities in the nearby city of Yogyakarta, about 400
kilometers (250 miles) east of Jakarta, have asked sand miners in
nearby rivers to stop their activities so as to avoid heat clouds.
	   They also have made preparations to evacuate people living
closest to the volcano, it added.
	   Occasional clouds of gas have been reported at the mountain
since a loud explosion early this month sent gray ash over a wide
area.
	   The 2,968-meter (9,737-foot) Mount Merapi, near the border of
Central Java and East Java, is the most active of 500 Indonesia's
volcanoes.
	   A sudden eruption in 1994 sent a steam cloud that flattened a
village on its slopes, killing 60 inhabitants and severely burning
others.
	   Its most destructive eruption this century killed 1,300 people
in 1930.

 &UR; Yugoslav Foreign Ministry lodges protest to Albanian Embassy

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The Yugoslav Foreign Ministry has lodged a
strong protest to the Albanian Embassy in Belgrade over incidents Saturday
along the border between the two countries.
	   The Yugoslav news agency Tanjug said the government note maintained that
the Tirana authorities bear all the responsibility for the serious
consequences of the series of border incidents.
	   Early Saturday, hundreds of armed Albanians entered Yugoslav territory in
the region of the Djeravica and Kosare border posts and attacked Yugoslav
border guards, seriously wounding one Yugoslav soldier, Tanjug said.
	   The protest note said that despite numerous warnings and previous
Yugoslav Foreign Ministry protests, a series of serious border incidents had
continued.
	   Tanjug said this shows that the Albanian government has a lenient
attitude towards ``terrorist activities and serious violations of the state
border.''
	   It accused the Albanians of ignoring their responsibilities.

Man shot to death in paramilitary `punishment' attack
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with man's identity, other details &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Gunmen shot a man to death early Sunday on the
stairs of his Belfast apartment block in what police said appeared
to be a ``punishment'' attack by paramilitaries.
	   Andy Kearney, 33, was with his mother and two-week-old daughter
in his apartment in the Catholic New Lodge area when five men burst
in soon after midnight, police said.
	   The men disconnected the family's phone, then took the man to an
outside stairwell, where they shot him in both legs, said a police
spokesman, speaking with customary anonymity. The man, who was not
identified, died later of his injuries.
	   Police Supt. Tim McGregor said the attack appeared to be a
paramilitary ``punishment'' shooting. It was not immediately clear
if it was the work of the Irish Republican Army _ which despite its
cease-fire, has continued to inflict ``punishment'' beatings and
shootings on scores of people accused of criminal behavior _ or was
inflicted by members of a splinter republican group.
	   ``The mother was unable to phone for an ambulance and left the
(apartment) block and ran to an adjoining block,'' McGregor said.
``An ambulance was called, but when they got him to the hospital he
was found to be dead on arrival.''
	   ``Had he got medical treatment at the time and if they hadn't
pulled out the phone he might have lived,'' he said.
	   Kearney's mother Maureen, 65, said she believed her son had been
targeted by republican paramilitaries because of a personal grudge.
``If they don't like you you are dispensable and my son was
dispensable,'' she said.
	   Separately, members of the Orange Order failed to strike a
compromise with residents of a Catholic neighborhood of Portadown
who object to the Orangemen marching throught their area. Talks
between the two sides broke up early Sunday without agreement.

Wall of water crashes into remote Papua New Guinean villages

<TEXT>
	   PORT MORESBY, Papua New Guinea (AP) _ Villagers on Papua New
Guinea's northwest coast heard only what sounded like an
approaching jet plane. Minutes later, nearly 600 died, many of them
after being dragged from their flattened homes into a mass of
water, trees and tangled timber.
	   Scores of children were among the dead when a 23-foot
(seven-meter) wall of water known as a tsunami hit the coast. The
death toll in the late Friday disaster is expected to climb as high
as 1,000.
	   Hundreds more were injured and were awaiting urgent medical
help, while others were believed to have fled to higher ground in
the interior, making accurate counts of how many perished in the
disaster nearly impossible.
	   The tsunami hit without warning following an earthquake about 18
miles (30 kilometers) off the coast in the Pacific Ocean.
	   Fisherman Jerry Apuan said Sunday morning that he was unable to
count the number of bodies floating in a lagoon near one of the
villages hardest hit by the wave.
	   ``There were so many bodies together I had to move the boat
slowly to pass through them,'' he said. ``I was afraid. It was the
first time I had seen so many bodies.''
	   Papua New Guinea, with a population of 4 million, occupies the
eastern half of the South Pacific island of New Guinea. It has a
mountainous, jungle-filled interior that has only been explored in
the past 20 to 30 years, along with lush tropical beaches on the
coastal plains.
	   The capital of Port Moresby is about 600 kilometers (375 miles)
east of the northeastern tip of Australia.
	   ``We heard a large bang, then saw the sea rising up. We had no
choice but to run for our lives,'' Paul Saroya, a resident of Nimas
village, told Australian Broadcasting Corp. television.
	   Nimas was one of at least three villages swept away when a bank
of three waves crashed into flimsy seafront homes along a 20-mile
(35-kilometer) stretch of coastline in West Sepik province.
	   Australian government aid agency Ausaid officers in Papua New
Guinea estimated the death toll would climb to more than 1,000,
with many thousands injured, Australian Defense Minister Ian
McLachlan said.
	   Authorities at Aitape on the country's northwest coast said the
tsunami had wiped out three villages and had almost completely
destroyed another.
	   ``The latest death toll for the district is 599,'' district
disaster coordinating chairman Dickson Dalle said. ``But the figure
may increase as more bodies are found.''
	   Dalle said it was impossible to say how many people were
missing.
	   ``There are still people out there who are injured that we have
not rescued,'' he said. ``They're scattered all over in the
mangroves.''
	   Dalle said most of the victims were old people and
schoolchildren.
	   ``Schools in Arop, Sissano and Warapu will be closed because we
don't have the children,'' Dalle said. ``They're all dead.''
	   Ausaid estimated 6,000 people were left homeless. Many were
believed still hiding inland in the jungle after fleeing to high
ground, McLachlan said.
	   Associated Press photographer Brian Cassey flew over the Sissano
lagoon Sunday and said the beaches on which a number of villages
had been built had been swept clean.
	   ``The villages no longer exist. The beaches are clean,'' Cassey
said. ``The lagoon is filled with debris, coconut palms and what
used to be houses.''
	   In Arop village, where locals said about 2,000 people lived,
there was no sign of life, he added. No bodies were visible from
the air.
	   ``The place is desolate. Not a soul is there,'' Cassey said.
	   Dalle said the confirmed dead included 500 at Warapu village, 40
at Malol and 41 at Sissano.
	   Prime Minister Bill Skate inspected part of the stricken area
Sunday.
	   Queen Elizabeth II sent a message to Papua New Guinea, which is
a member of the Commonwealth, expressing her shock at the deaths.
	   ``Her thoughts were with the families of the bereaved and
injured,'' said a Buckingham Palace spokeswoman.
	   In Rome, Pope John Paul II, who has visited Papua New Guinea
twice during his papacy, was described by his spokesman as ``very
concerned'' over the disaster and has asked to be constantly
informed. He dedicated his Sunday morning prayers to the victims.
	   Disaster authorities said the stricken area, about 600
kilometers (370 miles) northwest of Port Moresby, is spotted with
villages consisting of homes made of jungle materials and built on
beaches.
	   Robert Igara, the government's chief secretary, said the
population in the area affected by the tsunami was 8,000 to 10,000
people.
	   Three Australian Defense Forces Hercules C-130 transport planes
left Australia Sunday with equipment to set up a field hospital.
The equipment includes a mini-surgery theater, water treatment and
inspect sprays to avoid potential disease outbreaks.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat will brief
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on Tuesday on the
Palestinian-Israeli negotiations, Egypt's Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa said Sunday.
	   The negotiations, scheduled to take place Sunday night, are the
first for months and were arranged at the instance of the United
States, which has pressed both sides to hold direct talks.
	   Moussa said Arafat will arrive in Cairo on Tuesday for a meeting
with Mubarak.
	   The Israeli-Palestinian talks are aimed at resolving differences
over a U.S. plan for Israel to withdraw from another 13 percent of
the West Bank.

Heavy fighting flares in wider Orahovac area
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with more casualties, Yugoslav protest against illegal
border crossings. &QL; 
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Heavy fighting resumed Sunday
between government forces and Kosovo separatists around the central
Kosovo town of Orahovac, the target of a guerrilla offensive a day
before, field reports said.
	   Saturday's offensive at Orahovac, about 50 kilometers (30 miles)
southwest of Pristina, appeared aimed at expanding the estimated 40
percent of territory held by the militant Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   The advance provoked a Serbian counter-offensive. Reliable
witnesses near Orahovac on Saturday saw Serb tanks and artillery
pieces moving to back up the counter-attack. Hundreds of civilians
fled on tractors and horse-drawn wagons.
	   Sunday's fighting affected a wider area around Orahovac,
focusing on nearby Drenoc village, which was under fierce Serb
artillery fire, and Bela Crkva, another area village which was all
in flames, initial unconfirmed Albanian reports said.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, which distributes information
from ethnic Albanian sources, said two civilians were killed and
four were wounded.
	   In a grenade attack on two other villages some 20 kilometers
(12.5 miles) east of Orahovac, a 12-year-old girl and another
teenager were killed, the center said without providing other
details of the fighting.
	   The Serbian Media Center in Pristina said that early Sunday
strong police forces freed the Orahovac police station and the
center of the town of 20,000.
	   The police were reported battling remaining isolated groups of
rebel fighters, who barricaded themselves in several spots in the
town _ the post office, a local daytime hospital and a school.
	   A total of eight KLA fighters, including three ``officers,''
surrendered to the police overnight, the center said.
	   The report could not be independently confirmed.
	   On Saturday, a Yugoslav army statement said some 1,000
``terrorists'' tried to cross from Albania into Kosovo, west of
Decani town. The attack was foiled and about 30 guerrillas were
``liquidated.''
	   In another border clash, Yugoslav forces shelled Saturday the
region of Padesh village on the Albanian border in an attempt to
further disrupt the guerrillas' gun-smuggling network into Kosovo,
a province of Serbia, which makes up most of present-day
Yugoslavia.
	   Ethnic Albanians, who outnumber Serbs 9-to-1 in Kosovo, are
demanding independence from Serbia.
	   Albanian border guards near Padesh reported seeing the bodies of
dead and wounded victims but gave no casualty count.
	   Officials in Albania said 19 wounded Kosovo Liberation Army
members crossed into Albania to escape the barrage. Albania's state
TV said 80 others fleeing the violence, apparently civilians,
strayed into a deadly border minefield. They were evacuated by
Albanian border troops, state TV reported.
	   Albania's deputy interior minister, Ilir Cano, said two Serb
mortar rounds landed inside Albanian territory. The Yugoslav army
denied any border violations.
	   In a statement condemning the reported border violations, the
Albanian government late Saturday called on foreign powers and
organizations ``to use all their means and take urgent and
extraordinary steps to stop this fascist aggression of the Belgrade
authorities on the Albanian population.''
	   But the government also said it was ``capable of facing any ...
threats against its sovereignty and territorial integrity ...''
	   In return, the Yugoslav Foreign Ministry Sunday sent a protest
note to the Albanian Embassy in Belgrade, the Tanjug news agency
reported.
	   ``Despite numerous warnings and earlier protests by the
(Yugoslav) Ministry, the series of serious border incidents
continued _ five in the last two days.
	   ``This points to the fact that Albanian government is tolerating
terrorist activities and grave violations of the state border,
without taking any measures to stop them,'' the protest note said.
	   It said the ``Albanian government bears all responsibility for
grave consequences of the border incidents.''

<TEXT>
	   HOHENSTEIN-ERNSTTHAL, Germany (AP) _ Australia's Michael Doohan
Sunday steadily pulled away from the field at the German Motorcyle
Grand Prix to capture his 50th career world championship race.
	   Doohan, riding a Honda, took the 500 cc race in the first world
championship event held at Sachsenring in 26 years in front of
80,000 spectators.
	   The four-time world champion finished the 108.748 kilometer race
in 46 minutes, 00.876 seconds. It was the 130th grand prix race of
his career.
	   Italy's Max Biaggi finished second in 46:00.876 on a windy
circuit that Doohan and others criticized for poor visibility
before the race. Spain's Alex Criville on a Honda was third in
46:12.255.
	   ``I didn't get off to a good start. I knew it would be hard to
pass someone on this track,'' said Biaggi.
	   The Australian, seeking his fifth world title, built his lead in
the overall standings over Biaggio with 160 to 148 for the Italian.
Criville is third with 142.
	   ``I knew Biaggi would be strong, but I was consistent today,''
said Doohan, who rode to his fourth win this season.
	   Simon Cravar, riding a Yamaha, crashed out of the race. The New
Zealander had broken Honda's streak of 22 straight wins in the
class at the British Grand Prix.
	   In the 250 cc race, Japan's Tetsuya Hara led from start to
finish on his Aprilia, covering the 105.24 kilomers in 44.43.421.
Britain's Jeremy McWilliams, riding a Honda, was second and 9.033
seconds behind.
	   Japan's Tomomi Manako won the 101.732 kilometer 125 cc race on
his Honda in 44:37.947, while runaway points leader Kazuto Sakata
of Japan was seventh on a Yamaha.

Rights body to check new report on killings in Irian Jaya
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's human rights commission
has received reports of additional killings of villagers in a 1996
military operation to free hostages held by separatists in remote
Irian Jaya province.
	   Two members of the National Commission on Human Rights have been
investigating an earlier report by local church leaders that 11
villagers were killed and some were missing after the operation.
	   New reports, however, say a total of 43 were killed, the
official Antara news agency said.
	   It quoted one member, Asmara Bababan, as saying, ``But we need
to verify ... because there is a possibility that of duplication in
the reporting process,'' with the same deaths counted twice.
	   The initial report said some churches and houses were also
burned down near the mining town of Timika, about 3,452 kilometers
(2,157 miles) northeast of Jakarta.
	   Indonesian troops led by the elite Kopassus force mounted a
large-scale operation that rescued four Britons, two Dutch citizens
and three Indonesians held by rebels.
	   The six had been held for four months by the Free Papua
Movement, a group fighting against Indonesian rule in Irian Jaya.
	   The territory, in the western part of New Guinea, was taken over
by Indonesia in 1963. In a U.N.-sponsored vote in 1969, people in
the former Dutch colony formally chose to join with Indonesia.
	   The latest reports on the 1996 case follow more recent
accusations against the special force then headed by Lt. Gen.
Prabowo Subianto, a son-in-law of former President Suharto.
	   At least seven of its members face charges in connection with
the kidnapping of pro-democracy activists before a special assembly
re-elected Suharto to a seventh five-year term in March.
	   Suharto stepped down in May amid riots triggered by Indonesia's
economic crisis and student-led protests against his 32-year
authoritarian rule.

Rats still rampant at new Malaysian airport
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with prime minister making surprise visit to airport,
last three grafs &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Eateries at Malaysia's new
multimillion-dollar airport have been urged to keep their garbage
cans closed to help exterminators sweep the site of 600 rats, news
reports said Sunday.
	   Reports of rats scurrying around the dlrs 2.3 billion Kuala
Lumpur International Airport surfaced last week after a flight was
delayed 15 hours because a rat was discovered on board.
	   Transport Minister Ling Liong Sik said exterminators already had
caught 291 of the rodents but estimated that 600 remained, the Star
newspaper reported.
	   An hour's drive from downtown Kuala Lumpur, the sleek new
airport sprawls across 10,000 hectares (24,700 acres) of former
palm oil plantations, which Ling said were riddled with rat
burrows.
	   The minister said exterminators were trying not only to rid the
facility of rodents but to trace them back to their breeding
grounds.
	   In the meantime, Ling asked that airport food outlets cooperate
by keeping a lid on garbage and cutting off food supplies to the
pests.
	   Rats are the latest in a string of troubles that have gripped
the KLIA since it opened last month. Most computer-related
problems, including lost baggage and flight delays, have begun to
ease.
	   Opposition leader Lim Kit Siang questioned Sunday how the rats
had found their way into the airport.
	   ``It's no use talking about KLIA being a high-tech yet passenger
friendly airport when some 600 rats are running all over the
airport,'' he said in a statement.
	   Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad made an unscheduled visit to the
airport Sunday to observe overall operations. He did not mention
the rats, but said, ``The food center looks good, ... very
attractive.''
	   Overall, he told reporters, there was ``a little (problem) here
and there'' but the airport was ``generally operating smoothly.''
	   Asked whether he was satisfied with the airport's operations, he
said: ``I am never satisfied, but satisfied all the same. ...
Because it's a new big facility, it's not easy to have very smooth
operations all at once.''

Heavy fighting flares in wider Orahovac area

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Heavy fighting resumed Sunday
between government forces and Kosovo separatists around the central
Kosovo town of Orahovac, the target of a guerrilla offensive, field
reports said.
	   Saturday's offensive at Orahovac, about 50 kilometers (30 miles)
southwest of Pristina, appeared aimed at expanding the estimated 40
percent of the Serbian province held by the militant Kosovo
Liberation Army.
	   The advance provoked a Serbian counter-offensive. Reliable
witnesses near Orahovac on Saturday saw Serb tanks and artillery
pieces moving to back up the counter-attack. Hundreds of civilians
fled on tractors and horse-drawn wagons.
	   Sunday's fighting spread to areas around Orahovac, focusing on
nearby Drenoc village, which was under fierce Serb artillery fire,
and Bela Crkva, another village which was reportedly in flames,
unconfirmed Albanian reports said.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, which distributes information
from ethnic Albanian sources, said two civilians were killed and
four were wounded.
	   In a grenade attack on two other villages some 20 kilometers
(12.5 miles) east of Orahovac, a 12-year-old girl and another
teenager were killed, the center said without providing other
details of the fighting.
	   The Serbian Media Center in Pristina said police freed the
Orahovac police station and the center of the town of 20,000 Sunday
morning.
	   The police were reportedly battling remaining isolated groups of
rebel fighters, who barricaded themselves in several spots,
including the post office, a local daytime hospital and a school.
	   Police had not taken any casualties in the fighting, and a total
of eight KLA fighters, including three ``officers,'' surrendered to
police overnight, the center said.
	   The report could not be independently confirmed.
	   On Saturday, a Yugoslav army statement said some 1,000
``terrorists'' tried to cross from Albania into Kosovo, west of
Decani town. The attack was foiled and about 30 guerrillas were
``liquidated.''
	   In another border clash, Yugoslav forces on Saturday shelled
Padesh village on the Albanian border in an attempt to further
disrupt the guerrillas' gun-smuggling network. Albanian border
guards near Padesh reported seeing the bodies of dead and wounded
victims but gave no casualty count.
	   Ethnic Albanians, who outnumber Serbs 9-to-1 in Kosovo, are
demanding independence from Serbia, which makes up most of
present-day Yugoslavia.
	   Albania's deputy interior minister, Ilir Cano, said two Serb
mortar rounds landed inside Albanian territory. The Yugoslav army
denied any border violations.
	   In a statement condemning the shelling, the Albanian government
late Saturday spoke of ``a barbarian acts.''
	   It called on foreign powers and organizations ``to use all their
means and take urgent and extraordinary steps to stop this fascist
aggression of the Belgrade authorities on the Albanian
population.''
	   But the government also said it was ``capable of facing any
provocations or threats against its sovereignty and territorial
integrity ...''
	   In return, the Yugoslav Foreign Ministry Sunday sent a protest
note to the Albanian Embassy in Belgrade, the Tanjug news agency
reported.
	   ``Despite numerous warnings and earlier protests by the
(Yugoslav) Ministry, the series of serious border incidents
continued _ five in the last two days.
	   ``This points to the fact that Albanian government is tolerating
terrorist activities and grave violations of the state border,
without taking any measures to stop them,'' the protest note said.

Blind athletes from around the globe show they can compete
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MAR ROMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Athletes at the World Championships for the
Blind in Madrid are intent on proving to the world what they have
already proved to themselves.
	   Just ask Tim Willis from Atlanta, Georgia, one of the 51-member
U.S. squad sent to the July 18-26 event that is billed as the first
ever international sporting competition for the blind.
	   ``With the competition you let people know you can do it,
regardless of your disability,'' said Willis, 27, who lost his
sight as a young boy.
	   Willis, holds the 10,000-meter world record for the blind of 33
minutes, 54 seconds. He also boasts a silver medal from the 1996
Atlanta Paralympic Games.
	   A law student, Willis trains and competes with a sighted guide
who runs alongside him attached by a lose cord.
	   A total of 1,216 athletes are participating in the all-blind
competition held at the Spanish national sporting authority's
facilities in the capital's Complutense University Campus.
	   At the event, organized by the International Blind Sports
Association, athletes are classified as B1 if they are totally
blind, B2 if they are partially blind, and B3 if they are only
visually impaired.
	   Willis' swimming teammate Trisha Zorn, from Orange California,
was born with limited vision. Now 37, she has 41 gold and five
silver medals from the Paralympics.
	   ``When we train with sighted athletes, they feel sorry for us at
first but not when we beat them'' she said.
	   As well as the traditional track, field, swimming and judo
events the Madrid competition also features goalball _ the
archetypal blind sport that first made an impact in the 1950s as a
rehabilitation technique for World War II blind veterans.
	   Two teams of three blindfolded players roll bell-filled
basketballs at the opposing squad's goal with a bowling action.
Silence is required of the audience so defenders can listen out for
the approaching ball they are trying to block before it enters the
goal.
	   Natalie Chartrend of Quebec, Canada, began playing goalball
after she lost her sight in a car accident at the age of 20. Eleven
years later, she says her blindness may even have helped her
sporting career.
	   ``When I was sighted my dream was to go to the Olympics as a
basketball player, but I was too small. Since I've been blind my
dream has come true and I have participated in the Paralympics with
goalball and got the bronze medal in Barcelona 92,'' Chartrend
said.
	   Preparing to face the Netherlands' team in Madrid, Chartrend
said she was proud of having proved wrong the skeptics who told her
she would never be an athlete.
	   Not that everybody is convinced, a fact reflected in the scant
coverage given to the Madrid event by the Spanish media.
	   ``We are unsure about reporting on blind sports. They are worth
while, but they are also marked by a kind of unhealthy
fascination,'' said Juanjo Fernandez, sports editor of leading
Spanish daily El Pais.

Siemens denies it plans to shed memory chip operations
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ German electronics group Siemens on
Sunday dismissed as ``pure nonsense'' reports that it planned to
close or sell five memory chip factories.
	   Company spokesman Eberhard Posner said there were no concrete
plans for Siemens' memory chip operations, and that none would be
made until September at the earliest.
	   Der Spiegel magazine reported Saturday that Siemens planned to
shed its memory chip operations following substantial losses in its
semiconductor business. The Hamburg-based magazine, which did not
cite sources for its report, said the company planned to shut down
or sell five chip factories.
	   ``It is true we will have to adjust capacity, but that does not
mean we plan to sell any of the factories,'' Posner said, adding
that the Spiegel report was ``pure nonsense.''
	   Siemens has said it expects a loss of more than 1 billion marks
(dlrs 560 million) in its semiconductor business during the fiscal
year that runs through September. That compares with a net profit
of 109 million marks (dlrs 61 million) the previous year.

 &UR; Festina ban may be tip of iceberg, critics say &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The expulsion of the Festina team from the Tour de
France was a drugs scandal waiting to happen.
	   Cycling has gone hand in hand with doping tragedies for 30 years
and critics argue that what happened to Festina was just the tip of
the iceberg.
	   A substantial quantity of steroids and the artificial hormone
stimulant Erythropoietin, known as EPO, were found by customs
officers 10 days ago in a car belonging to Festina team trainer
Willy Voet on route to the start of the Tour de France in Dublin.
	   Voet has been held in custody since then while team director
Bruno Roussel and team doctor Erik Ryckaert also are under
investigation in one of the biggest scandals to hit the sport. The
nine riders were kicked out of the race on Saturday.
	   Although the Festina riders declare their innocence and blame
team chiefs for the scandal, the customs find was significant.
	   It is the first time that EPO has been linked to a major cycle
race. Difficult to detect, the hormone stimulates the production of
red blood cells which increases the blood's capacity to carry
oxygen.
	   It a sport where endurance is the key to success, it's almost
like carrying a fresh blood supply around and former pros have
alleged that EPO is in widespread use.
	   ``You cannot deny that a quantity of other riders are doing the
same thing,'' said Cyrille Guimard who gained success as a team
manager on seven Tours between 1976 and '84.
	   ``The riders are victims of the doctors and the sponsors who pay
the doctors.''
	   Now the debate about how widespread the problem has become is
stealing the headlines from the stage winners.
	   Since British star Tommy Simpson died of heat exhaustion at the
1967 Tour de France and amphetamines were discovered in his blood,
cycling has dragged along the stigma of drug abuse like a ball and
chain.
	   Steroids, stimulants and human growth hormones have all been
detected in recent years and cyclists thrown out of events, some
for inventing elaborate ways of trying to submit clean samples.
	   EPO is also a dangerous substance to take artificially. If too
much is administered into the bloodstream, it can make the blood
too thick and that sets off heart attacks.
	   The discovery of EPO and the connection with such a high-profile
team as Festina has again tarnished the image of a sport which is
hugely popular in Europe and attracts massive revenues, both from
sponsors and TV.
	   The critics say that, to maintain the interest of the sponsors
and keep their riders at the front of the game, team leaders have
been pumping the athletes with drugs.
	   That also might explain why cycling has been a little slow in
adopting the same rigorous drug testing procedures that are now
present in sports which have a bad record in doping abuse such as
athletics, swimming and weightlifting.
	   Michel Gros, who replaced Roussel on the banned team, said
Festina was a scapegoat in the cycling world where doping, he
claimed, was common practice.
	   ``Within the entire pack, it exists,'' Gros said.
	   Gerald Gremion, who was doctor to Swiss teams PMU Romand and
Swiss Port, said he believed 99 percent of Tour de France cyclists
used performance-enhancing drugs.
	   ``Each racer had his little suitcase with dopes and syringes.
They did their own injections,'' he said. ``I was horrified and
left the team.''
	   Even French president Jacques Chirac, who watched part of the
Tour on Saturday, scolded the drug cheats.
	   ``We don't have the right to play with the health of young
sportsmen who get caught up in doping,'' he said. ``Doping is above
all dishonesty. It is cheating and as such must be condemned and
punished in the strongest way.''

Blind athletes from around the globe show they can compete
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MAR ROMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Athletes at the World Championships for the
Blind in Madrid are intent on proving to the world what they have
already proved to themselves.
	   Just ask Tim Willis from Atlanta, Georgia, one of the 51-member
U.S. squad sent to the July 18-26 event that is billed as the first
ever international sporting competition for the blind.
	   ``With the competition you let people know you can do it,
regardless of your disability,'' said Willis, 27, who lost his
sight as a young boy.
	   Willis holds the 10,000-meter world record for the blind, at 33
minutes, 54 seconds. He also boasts a silver medal from the 1996
Atlanta Paralympic Games.
	   A law student, Willis trains and competes with a sighted guide
who runs alongside him attached by a loose cord.
	   A total of 1,216 athletes are participating in the all-blind
competition held at the Spanish national sporting authority's
facilities in the capital's Complutense University Campus.
	   At the event, organized by the International Blind Sports
Association, athletes are classified as B1 if they are totally
blind, B2 if they are partially blind, and B3 if they are only
visually impaired.
	   Willis' swimming teammate Trisha Zorn, from Orange California,
was born with limited vision. Now 37, she has 41 gold and five
silver medals from the Paralympics.
	   ``When we train with sighted athletes, they feel sorry for us at
first but not when we beat them'' she said.
	   As well as the traditional track, field, swimming and judo
events the Madrid competition also features goalball _ the
archetypal blind sport that first made an impact in the 1950s as a
rehabilitation technique for World War II blind veterans.
	   Two teams of three blindfolded players roll bell-filled
basketballs at the opposing squad's goal with a bowling action.
Silence is required of the audience so defenders can listen out for
the approaching ball they are trying to block before it enters the
goal.
	   Natalie Chartrend of Quebec, Canada, began playing goalball
after she lost her sight in a car accident at the age of 20. Eleven
years later, she says her blindness may even have helped her
sporting career.
	   ``When I was sighted my dream was to go to the Olympics as a
basketball player, but I was too small. Since I've been blind my
dream has come true and I have participated in the Paralympics with
goalball and got the bronze medal in Barcelona 92,'' Chartrend
said.
	   Preparing to face the Netherlands' team in Madrid, Chartrend
said she was proud of having proved wrong the skeptics who told her
she would never be an athlete.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Nigel Wilson drove in four runs and Jerry Brooks
sent home one as the Pacific League's front-running Nippon Ham
Fighters beat the Kintetsu Buffaloes 9-3 at Osaka Dome Sunday.
	   Wilson hit a home run in the third inning, singled home two runs
in the sixth inning and singled in another in the ninth. Wilson,
formerly with the Cleveland Indians, now has 18 homers.
	   Brooks, formerly with the Florida Marlins, went 4-for-4 and
singled in a run in the sixth.
	   The Fighters are eight games ahead of the Seibu Lions, who beat
the Chiba Lotte Marines 4-1 at Chiba.
	   The Lions' Domingo Martinez hit a home run in the second inning
and teammate Kazuo Matsui singled home the tie-breaking run in the
two-run second inning.
	   Martinez, formerly with the Triple-A Rochester team, has 20
homers this season.
	   At Fukuoka Dome, Kenji Jojima singled home two runs in the
six-run sixth inning as the Fukuoka Daiei Hawks trounced the Orix
BlueWave 12-7.
	   In the Central League, Robert Rose smashed a home run in the
sixth and singled home another run in the two-run seventh as the
front-running Yokohama BayStars beat the Hiroshima Toyo Carp 6-3 at
Yokohama.
	   Rose, formerly with the California Angels, has 10 homers.
	   The BayStars are 4 1/2 games ahead of the Chunichi Dragons, who
beat the Hanshin Tigers 3-2 in 11 innings at Koshien Stadium.
	   The Tigers tied 2-2 in the bottom of the ninth on Makoto
Imaoka's third home run of the season, against reliever Sun
Dong-yol, but in the top of the 11th, Koji Yamaguchi singled home
the winning run.
	   Sun, who formerly played for the Hai Tai Tigers of the South
Korean professional league, relieved Eiji Ochiai in the eighth and
gave up two hits and struck out five over two innings. Later, the
Korean was relieved by Hiroaki Nakayama and Yukinaga Maeda (2-0).
	   At Tokyo Dome, Kouta Soejima hit a home run and Tetsuya Iida

French Health Minister urges debate on drugs in sports
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with background graf on Chirac calling for eradication
of drugs in sports. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The French health minister on Sunday recommended
debate on the use of performance-enhancing drugs by athletes, as
the fabled Tour de France sought to rebound from a doping scandal.
	   ``We should all together debate what is lawful and what is not
lawful,'' Bernard Kouchner said in an interview with France Info
radio.
	   The scandal prompted French President Jacques Chirac on Saturday
to urge the eradication of the use of drugs that enhance
performance.
	   Kouchner, whose father was a doctor on the Tour de France 30
years ago, reminded reminded listeners that alcohol had been used
to improve performances by cyclists on the Tour and that in the
past deaths had resulted from that practice.
	   ``Ever since there has been cycle racing there has been doping.
And since the show has become more and more profitable, there is
more and more doping,'' said Kouchner.
	   Calling the cyclists ``slaves,'' Kouchner blamed sponsors,
newspapers, media and companies for pushing the riders into drugs
to achieve performances that would be impossible without them.
	   ``It's a commercial enterprise,'' Kouchner said referring to the
Tour.
	   The director of the Tour de France on Friday kicked out the
Festina team from this year's race because of a doping scandal.
Three team officials are under investigation for procuring
performance-enhancing drugs.

</HEADLINE>
Switzerland &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with final late victory Corretja over Bastl; Heuberger
substituted by Swiss No. 3 Bastl &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   A CORUNA, Spain (AP) _ World No. 4 Carlos Moya won Spain a place
in the Davis Cup semifinals for the first time in 11 years by
downing Marc Rosset of Switzerland on Sunday in straight sets.
	   The reigning French Open champion struggled a little before
winning the first set 7-5 and getting into his stride to take the
second set 6-1.
	   Rosset, 1992 Olympic champion, managed a limited comeback in the
third set, but could not prevent Moya from winning 7-5 and sealing
victory for himself, his team and his country.
	   Adding extra icing to Spain's victory cake, Alex Corretja beat
George Bastl of Switzerland 6-0, 7-5 in the final match of the
quarterfinal tie.
	   Bastl, Swiss No. 3, substituted for Ivo Heuberger in the match
that was limited to the best of three sets due to the irrelevance
of it's outcome for the overall result.
	   Spain goes to the semifinals in September, to meet either
Germany or defending champion Sweden, secure of the quality of its
singles stars but a little doubtful when it comes to its doubles
performances.
	   On Saturday the Swiss duo, Rosset and Lorenzo Manta beat the
Spanish pair Julian Alonso and Javier Sanchez Vicario in a five set
marathon.

Desbiens takes lead on 8th stage with Tour approaching mountains
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Will be updated
 &UR; BY SALVATORE ZANCA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MONTAUBAN, France (AP) - Laurent Desbiens of France took the
overall lead of the Tour de France Sunday on a hot but relatively
calm day after a week of tumultuous events that rocked the race.
	   Jacky Durand of France won the eighth stage as he was part of a
long breakaway that included Desbiens in the day's leg from
Brive-La Gaillarde to Montauban, 190 kilometers (118 miles).
	   Durand won the final spring over Andrea Tafi with two other
Italians, Fabio Sacchi and Eddy Mazzoleni third and fourth.
	   Desbiens was fifth.
	   The major pack finished more than seven minutes behind Durand.
That was enough to let Desbians take the leader's yellow jersey
from defending champion Jan Ullrich of Germany who took it in
Saturday's time trial.
	   Temperatures reached above 40 C (104 F) on the road and the
major favorites in the pack let the small group escape without
risking much. The extreme heat allowed Tour officials to change
regulations on route to allow water to be brought to the riders
more often than usual.
	   Desbiens is not expected to hold onto to the lead in the
mountains. Desbiens ended up nearly four hours behind Ullrich in
last year's final standings, placing 127th.
	   The ninth stage is from Montauban to Pau at the base of the
mountains followed by two stages with four major climbs on Tuesday
and five on Wednesday. Three of the mountains are rated ''out of
category'' on a scale measuring height, distance and steepness.
	   Last year Ullrich made his first big move in the Pyrenees to
take control of the race for good, stretching his lead by minutes
over the final 12 days with the help of his German Telekom team.
	   Only the Festina team, led by Richard Virenque, was able to
challenge Ullrich and Telekom. Virenque was the only racer within10
minutes of Ullrich in 1997.
	   But the Festina team is gone now. Its ouster ended a hectic week
since making an historic start in Ireland July 11.
	   The leader of the first two days, Chris Boardman, fell and
crashed out of the race last Monday while wearing the yellow
jersey.
	   Then the drug scandel exploded. First Festina's director Bruno
Roussel was put into police detention for questioning with the team
doctor. Then they were moved to Lille for further investigation.
	   Tour officials decided to throw the Festina team out of the
three-week race Friday after after Roussel admitted a practice of
supplying illegal drugs with medical supervision to improve
performances.
	   The riders of the Festina team withdrew from the race Saturday
at the request of the Tour de France after first trying to defy the
ban and race in Saturday's time trial.
	   Roussel, team doctor Erik Ryckaert and team masseur Wily Voet
were still under police custody in Lille. Voet was jailed July 9
after customs officials found a stash of performance-enhacing drugs
in Voet's car bearing Festina emblems.
	   The three are expected to have their first confrontation in
court on July 24.

<TEXT>
	   ARUSHA, Tanzania (AP) _ Reports of continued fighting between
Burundi's mainly Tutsi army and Hutu rebels appeared likely to marr
the opening of the second round of all-party peace talks on
Burundi.
	   A nationwide cease-fire was supposed to accompany the talks
scheduled to begin Monday in this northern Tanzanian town, where
delegates from the 17 parties participating in the talks began
arriving Sunday.
	   Last month, representatives of the government of President
Pierre Buyoya, political parties and the main Hutu rebel movement
agreed to settle their differences by peaceful means _ and to
observe a cease-fire from July 20.
	   The June gathering marked the first time Buyoya, who took power
in a coup in July 1996, agreed to join the talks, which were also
attended by former Interior Minister Leonard Nyangoma, head of the
National Council for the Defense of Democracy (CNDD), whose armed
wing is fighting the Burundi army.
	   But Brussels-based members of the CNDD claim Nyangoma no longer
speaks for the group, even though he is recognized by former
Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere, who is mediating the talks.
	   Last week Burundi's Minister for Peace and Reconciliation
Ambroise Niyonsaba held preparatory talks with Nyerere, but no
details of the discussion were available.
	   Delegates said Sunday the second round could prove more
difficult as the talks focus on more substantive issues in the
conflict, including opposition demands that the Tutsi military be
dismantled in favor a mixed Hutu-Tutsi army.
	   The demand, which essentials asks Buyoya and his military
backers give up total control, has been rejected by Burundi's
military leadership.
	   ``Once that is solved, everything should be clear for peace to
return to Burundi,'' said Sesoya Antoine, a representative of the
staunchly Hutu Palipehutu party.
	   Nyerere, Niyonsaba, Nyangoma and Antoine, representatives
several other political parties and Organization of African Unity
secretary-general Salim Ahmed Salim arrived Sunday.
	   Nyerere, whom Buyoya has criticized as being too close to the
Hutus, has been trying to get all parties in the tiny central
African nation to sit down to talks since October 1993 when Tutsi
paratroopers killed the country's first Hutu president. The
assasination led to widespread violence or reprisal and thousands
of deaths.
	   Six days after the July 1996 coup, countries in the region
slapped an economic and transport boycott on Burundi in an attempt
to get Buyoya to restore the democratic process and talk to rebels.
	   Buyoya, a retired officer who served as president from 1989 to
1993, claimed he alone could stop the bloodshed that has resulted
in at least 200,000 deaths, most of them civilian. An estimated
600,000 people have been driven from their homes.
	   Since the beginning of the year, Buyoya's government has moved
to establish a transition process and, with the agreement of
political parties, has enlarged the national assembly from 81 to
121 seats.
	   Buyoya says Burundi has complied with regional demands and that
the sanctions should thus be lifted.
	   Kenya, the largest economy in the region, has called for a
relaxation of some sanctions. Even Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni, who has taken a hard line on Burundi, appeared to be
considering softening his position when he sent an envoy to meet
with Buyoya last week.
	   But attacks by Hutu rebels and clashes with government troops
have continued, and it was unclear Sunday whether the cease-fire
would take hold.
	   Despite general agreement that Burundi's conflicts should be
settled by peaceful means, the government says it should not be
considered a party in any cease-fire since it argued that the
army's role was to defend citizens.

 &UR; French Health Minister urges debate on drugs in sports
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with background graf on Chirac calling for eradication
of drugs in sports. Version has moved on general news lines. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The French health minister on Sunday recommended
debate on the use of performance-enhancing drugs by athletes, as
the fabled Tour de France sought to rebound from a doping scandal.
	   ``We should all together debate what is lawful and what is not
lawful,'' Bernard Kouchner said in an interview with France Info
radio.
	   The scandal prompted French President Jacques Chirac on Saturday
to urge the eradication of the use of drugs that enhance
performance.
	   Kouchner, whose father was a doctor on the Tour de France 30
years ago, reminded reminded listeners that alcohol had been used
to improve performances by cyclists on the Tour and that in the
past deaths had resulted from that practice.
	   ``Ever since there has been cycle racing there has been doping.
And since the show has become more and more profitable, there is
more and more doping,'' said Kouchner.
	   Calling the cyclists ``slaves,'' Kouchner blamed sponsors,
newspapers, media and companies for pushing the riders into drugs
to achieve performances that would be impossible without them.
	   ``It's a commercial enterprise,'' Kouchner said referring to the
Tour.
	   The director of the Tour de France on Friday kicked out the
Festina team from this year's race because of a doping scandal.
Three team officials are under investigation for procuring
performance-enhancing drugs.

	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Flooding in Bangladesh has claimed 82
lives, marooned over 8 million people and damaged hundreds of
thousands of acres of standing crops, but the worst is yet to come,
a government expert said Sunday.
	   Newspapers reported 10 more deaths Sunday from three districts,
taking the death toll in a week's flooding to 82. Over 8 million
people are living in makeshift houses or relief camps across the
country, reports said.
	   A senior official at the Relief Ministry confirmed only 32
deaths and said nearly 4 1/2 million people had been affected in 25
districts across the country. There was no explanation for the
conflicting reports.
	   A more accurate estimate of the deaths and displacement due to
the floods is expected in a few days from relief workers. Officials
are now trying to reach the affected people in far-flung areas
where road, railroad and telecommunication links have been cut off.
	   A senior meteorological official said there would be no
immediate relief from the fury of the Ganges, which flows into
Bangladesh from neighboring India.
	   ``The Ganges basin in Bangladesh is bracing for a wave of
devastating flood with heavy monsoon rainfall continuing in the
upper catchment of the river in Nepal and India,'' Ishad Hossain,
director of the Bangladesh Meteorological Department, told The
Associated Press.
	   Some 300 feet of the flood protection embankment of the Gumti
river was washed away Friday and Saturday, flooding areas in the
Comilla district in eastern Bangladesh, officials said.
	   Millions of flood victims are struggling with a shortage of dry
food, drinking water and life saving drugs, newspaper reports said.
The Bangladesh Observer on Sunday reported an outbreak of
water-borne diseases in the flood-hit areas where little medical
assistance was available for the victims.
	   The low lying areas in capital Dhaka, a city of 9 million, were
submerged as three rivers in and around the city _ the Buriganga,
Turag and Sitalhayia _ flooded. An official at the Communication
Ministry Sunday said the flood waters had caused massive damage to
road and railway communication systems.

First synagogue built after Holocaust dedicated in Hungary
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By EVA KEKES &QC;

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Hundreds of Jewish children, wearing
identical T-shirts emblazoned with the Star of David, solemnly
watched as the first synagogue to open in Hungary since the
Holocaust was dedicated Sunday.
	   The synagogue is part of a newly built community center in an
international Jewish youth camp in Szarvas, 200 kilometers (125
miles) southwest of Budapest _ the only such institution in
East-Central Europe.
	   ``A camp in this region presents an unprecedented opportunity to
awaken countless young people, long denied access to their
heritage, to the joy of Judaism,'' the founder and sponsor of the
camp, cosmetics heir Ronald Lauder, said at the opening ceremony.
	   The community center is also housing an educational complex with
a library, study rooms, and a computer center.
	   It has been named Beit David (the House of David), after David
Ben Rafael, a diplomat at the Israeli Embassy in Buenos Aires,
Argentina, who was among the 87 victims of a terrorist bombing
there on March 17, 1992.
	   Among the guests at the ceremony were U.S. Ambassador to
Hungary, Peter Tufo, and Israeli Ambassador Joel Alon.
	   After World War II, when the remnants of the once
1-million-strong Jewish community returned to Hungary, there were
more synagogues than necessary for the few survivors. Then, for
decades under the officially atheist Communist system, there was
neither a need nor an incentive to build new synagogues.
	   The new synagogue was erected on the site of the Lauder-Joint
International Jewish Camp, where, since 1990, thousands of Jewish
children have spent their summer vacations.
	   This year over 2,000 children, between 8 and 16 years, from
Austria, Germany, Slovakia, Lithuania, the former Yugoslavia,
Russia, Ukraine, Romania and Albania have spent time in the camp.
	   Lauder donated dlrs 500,000 to build the community center, and
the Torah scrolls were donated by the Antwerp Jewish community.
	   ``For many children, especially for those coming from countries
like Albania, it is the realization that `I'm not alone by being
Jewish, there are many like me,'' said Israel Sela, director of the
Hungarian office of the American Jewish Joint Distribution Center,
which established the camp along with the Lauder Foundation.

Bjorkman beats Kiefer as Sweden reaches Davis Cup semis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HAMBURG, Germany (AP) _ Fighting a racous crowd, Jonas Bjorkman
won a five-set struggle Sunday against Nicolas Kiefer as defending
champion Sweden ousted Germany to reach the semifinals of the Davis
Cup.
	   Bjorkman outlasted the German, 6-3, 4-6, 6-2, 5-7, 6-4 to give
Sweden an insurmountable 3-1 lead in their World Group match.
	   Kiefer, backed by 10,200 spectators jeering every call by the
line judges, failed twice to break Bjorkman's serve at 4-4 in the
final set, then was broken on his next serve to end a wild match.
	   ``I had doubts a lot of times I would win,'' said Bjorkman, 26.
``I didn't play well, but I never gave up.''
	   Bjorkman, the world no. 9 who won three singles and went
undefeated in doubles in Sweden's title run last year, appeared
close to losing several times.
	   The Swede squandered a 40-0 lead at 4-4 in the final set, then
was saved from a break when Kiefer netted an easy passing shot. His
double fault also cost him a wild fourth set in which both players
had trouble holding serve.
	   The crowd began to boo and jeer steadily as several close calls
went against Kiefer early, with the German visibly upset.
	   Sweden, seeking a seventh title, will face Spain in the
semifinals.
	   Tommy Haas, who had beaten Bjorkman in straight sets in Friday's
singles, faces Thomas Enqvist in the meaningless final singles.
	   Bjorkman, also one of the world's top doubles players, had
teamed up with Nicklas Kulti Saturday to give Sweden a 2-1 lead by
beating the German pair of Boris Becker and David Prinosil.
	   Sweden's third point against Germany, a three-time Davis Cup
champion came in Friday's singles when Enqvist rolled past Kiefer
in three easy sets.

Yemeni minister says land dispute with Saudis is a threat to region
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANTHONY SHADID &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ A simmering border dispute between Saudi
Arabia and Yemen that has come close to war could upset the
security of the entire Arabian Peninsula, a region of key
importance to the United States, Yemen's foreign minister said
Sunday.
	   His warning was the latest in a little-known but potentially
explosive standoff along the 2,000-kilometer (1,300-mile) frontier
between the uneasy neighbors, whose decades-old quarrel erupted
into fighting in 1995.
	   Large swaths of the Yemeni-Saudi border, particularly in a part
of the desert known as the Empty Quarter, remain undefined.
	   ``A collapse in security between Yemen and Saudi Arabia would be
a collapse in security for the whole region,'' Foreign Minister
Abdul-Qader Bajammal told The Associated Press.
	   Any conflict would spill over into the Gulf, through which much
of the world's oil passes, he said. It would also endanger
countries on the Red Sea, he said. Some of those countries, such as
Sudan and Eritrea, are already embroiled in conflict.
	   Last week, Yemen accused Saudi Arabia of occupying parts of the
border region as a way of ``putting pressure on Yemen.''
	   Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil producer and one of
Washington's main allies, denied any violation of Yemeni territory.
	   Yemen, a country of rugged mountains and fertile valleys on the
southern tip of the Arabian Peninsula, has long contested Saudi
Arabia's claim to parts of the Empty Quarter and to three small but
strategic islands near the mouth of the Red Sea.
	   Frustrated with the lack of progress in talks, Yemen says it
wants to take the dispute to international arbitration. But the
Saudis have rejected this idea.
	   ``If there is no intention to solve the border dispute in a
friendly and honest manner, then there's no way out of the
problem,'' said Bajammal, who also serves as deputy prime minister.
	   Tension over the border dispute follows weeks of strife in
Yemen, one of the Arab world's poorest countries.
	   A government decision to raise fuel prices by 40 percent _ in
line with demands by the International Monetary Fund _ was met by
four days of protests in the capital, San`a, and other cities.
	   Restive tribesmen, many of them well armed, took advantage of
the unrest to press their demands for government funds and a bigger
share of revenue from the oil extracted in their regions. Dozens
were killed in the ensuing clashes with government forces.
	   Bajammal accused Saudi Arabia of backing the tribesmen to
undermine Yemen's stability.
	   ``The groups shaking the security in Yemen are known, very well
known historically, by their behavior and by their relations with
groups in Saudi Arabia,'' he said.

Ex-police chief takes over as RFU chairman
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BIRMINGHAM, England (AP) _ Former police chief Brian Baister
stepped into one of the hottest seats in rugby union Sunday when he
voted out Cliff Brittle 520-345 and became chairman of the English
RFU's management board.
	   Brittle was forced to step down after 30 stormy months in charge
of the RFU and now Baister, 58, takes over with a pledge to improve
the union's image with organizations it has riled during his
predecessor's time in office.
	   Baister says he intends ``to restore relations with the
International Board, the Five Nations, the European Cup organizers,
the England management, the clubs, sponsors and TV companies.
	   ``We are in dispute with all of them,'' he said.
	   The RFU management has been in disarray since the game in
England went pro three years ago and Brittle, described as
dictatorial by some members, was accused of blocking moves by
clubs, sponsors and TV companies to upgrade the game.

Earthquake rattles U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHARLOTTE AMALIE, U.S. Virgin Islands (AP) _ An earthquake
measuring 4.5 in magnitude rattled the U.S. Virgin Islands and
Puerto Rico early Sunday but caused no damage.
	   The tremor struck at about 5:27 a.m. and was centered off the
northwest coast of St. Thomas, about 12 miles (20 kilometers)
northeast of the Puerto Rican island of Culebra and 55 miles (90
kilometers) deep.
	   It rattled windows across St. Thomas and in eastern Puerto Rico,
but there were no reports of damage. The earthquake did not cause a
tsunami because it was so deep, said Victor Huerfano, interim
director of the Puerto Rico Seismic Network.

Italian left leader calls for no prison for illegal financing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italy's leftist leader on Sunday called for an end
to prison terms for illegal party financing, a charge that was the
core of six years of sweeping corruption probes.
	   Massimo D'Alema, whose Democratic Left party dominates the
governing coalition, also suggested that Parliament leaders set up
a five-member commission to explore ``Tangentopoli'' (Bribesville),
as the corruption scandal came to be known.
	   D'Alema's comments at a party convention showed how the
corruption issue continues to dominate Italian politics six years
after the corruption probes began.
	   The cases implicated thousands of politicians, businessmen and
government bureaucrats and brought down the country's ruling class.
Few politicians have gone to jail. Appeals have dragged on for
years, and many of the sentences have been short enough to be
automatically suspended.
	   D'Alema said that rather than jail time, illegal party financing
should be subject to ``a sanctioning system, that foresees the
removal from office of a Parliament member.''
	   His comments did not appear to refer to past convictions.
	   Most of the corruption probes revolved around kickbacks by
business figures to politicians and state industry bureaucrats in
exchange for contracts or other favors.
	   The question of what to do with all the charged and convicted
people has become more prominent with the recent convictions and
sentencing of Silvio Berlusconi on bribe and illegal party
financing charges.
	   Berlusconi, a media tycoon and former premier, heads the
center-right opposition, and accuses prosecutors of being
left-leaning plotters against him.
	   He has been pushing for a special Parliament committee to
explore Tangentopoli, but his forces and the center-left coalition
backing Premier Romano Prodi have been unable to agree.
	   D'Alema sought to break the impasse by proposing the five-member
committee, an idea which was immediately rejected by the
center-right.

Gaultier's great couture, Givenchy's jungle drums
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo PAR101-106 &QL; 
 &UR; By SUZY PATTERSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Fashion Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) - Jean-Paul Gaultier showed his winter haute couture
Sunday in an elegant mansion in a truly splendid moment for this
innovative designer who knows all about fashion, from the dregs _
which he has shown _ to the heights.
	   The audience gave him a big cheer as his bride and groom came
out in dressy cream outfits fashioned on Norwegian sweaters, after
feather-and-fur displays that were both fun and often wearable.
	   ``I absolutely loved this,'' said Nathalie, daughter of Sonia
Rykiel, also a Gaultier admirer.
	   Gaultier's couture and color sense were admirable, from the silk
crepe sun-pleated long tunic dress, to the bright blouson of cassis
leather adorned with rooster feathers over a trumpet shaped
georgette khaki skirt.
	   There were superb bomber jackets or blousons, such as a bright
coppery red elaborately accordion-pleated one. Or a sun-pleated
black and white tweed blouson with charcoal straight pants, a
sequined tank top.
	   No trouble keeping warm, as fur by Saga-Scandinavia was very big
throughout - many fox stoles, gold fox sleeves on a beautiful
charcoal trouser suit. And then for fun and warmth - a whole
classic pin-striped suit made of graded brownish sheared mink. Or
try that ``breischwantz'' gray jumpsuit to lounge at the ski bar.
	   There were great embroidery ideas such as the ``beaded handbag''
patterns, in patchwork designs on evening wear, very pretty as a
bodice with a fur edging on a hazy blue chiffon evening dress.
	   Some outfits were so original, yet Parisian - like the splendid
grand gold-lined tuxedo opera coat over its black micro-mini for
dancing, or the perfect alpaca and black satin long tuxedo
coat-dress with its billowing organza train.
	   Gaultier had some of his famed corselet looks, but the fireworks
were definitely in the explosion of graded fire-shaded bird of
paradise feathers like elegant feather duster sleeves on the pine
chiffon tank top and aubergine skirt.
	   For Givenchy, Alexander McQueen took his audience at the Cirque
d'Hiver (Winter Circus) on a quirky Amazonian trip with exotic
birds cawing, real model-birds parading, jungle drums from the rain
forest pounding relentlessly.
	   First arrived a kind of Godiva-amazon clothed in flowers and
tulle over her nearly-nude back under chiffon, on an elegant
stallion with rider to get the creature into a deep bow.
	   Then there were some splendid shiny, fitted trouser suits with
top hats, high heels, plenty of finery like lace blouses showing.
	   Insolent ladies paraded in well-cut hourglass short or long
suits with plenty of glitter; long evening suits looked beautifully
draped over shiny skirts.
	   Perhaps they were ghosts of the ancient opera house in Bahia
north of Rio, but it's sure the buggy Amazon was never quite like
this.
	   To the tom-tom rhythms came on a huge feather headdress over a
slinky embroidered almond crepe draped siren - plus another peacock
draped gown with an off-shoulder effect.
	   Then came the cute savages in their hipster pants, or their
clothing of leafy shawls, low hipsters or minis with navels
showing. There was an occasional civilized look at lace.
	   The ``savages'' entertained with their mask-like red make-up,
their cupid-like native bows with silvery arrows. The salon
``ladies'' had fun in their fuzzy big beehive hairdos.
	   Details there were, and quite good tailoring cuts, as usual. But
so much fabric shininess - with all the laces and rhinestones -
that the circus-like look at the rainforest turned out more like a
travelogue for Tarzan's Jane who'd like to dress like the colonists
than a fashion show for serious fashion-watchers.
	   But spectacle is the buzz-word these days, and McQueen usually
turns it out in spades for Givenchy.
	   Christophe Rouxel's couture debut at an old left-bank Gothic
convent building was on the shaky side.
	   The clothes were soothing, with wispy little flared silk-chiffon
minis in colors like cyclamen or silvery gray. Some excellent
indigo gowns in satin and chiffon for evening hit a good note for
right now, though there were also modern fabrics with wiry silver
embroidery, to enhance the romantic gowns for this young couturier,
still in his early thirties.

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ Seeking to break a 16-month deadlock,
Israel and the Palestinians held their first high-level talks in
months on Sunday, hours after police foiled what they said was an
attempted a car bombing in Jerusalem.
	   A Palestinian man described by police as a known Hamas activist
was arrested in the failed attack, in which he suffered serious
burns. No one else was hurt.
	   The incident created a tense backdrop for the evening talks by
Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai and Yasser Arafat's
deputy Mahmoud Abbas.
	   None of the participants _ who also included chief Palestinian
negotiator Saeb Erekat and Yitzhak Molcho, a senior aide to Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu _ made any statements as they headed
into the negotiating session in a Tel Aviv hotel.
	   Beforehand, the Palestinians signalled their low expectations.
Palestinian Cabinet minister Nabil Shaath said he thought the
meeting had only a ``very, very limited chance'' of success.
	   ``But for a chance of one percent we will go, because we don't
want to be told that we have wasted an opportunity,'' Shaath, the
planning minister, told reporters in the West Bank town of
Ramallah.
	   In Jerusalem, Netanyahu said Israel was coming to the talks with
``an open mind and a desire to achieve an agreement.''
	   ``I call on the Palestinian Authority to engage with us
continually, day and night, in negotiations, including at the
highest levels,'' he said. The prime minister told reporters he did
not rule out a meeting later with Arafat.
	   Earlier in the day, Netanyahu separately told his Cabinet and
visiting Jordanian Foreign Minister Jawad Anani that he was
determined to reach an agreement with the Palestinians, and soon.
	   Sunday's talks came at the urging of the United States, which
called on Israel and the Palestinians to negotiate directly to
resolve differences over a U.S. initiative calling for Israel to
withdraw from another 13 percent of the West Bank.
	   Israel has balked, citing security concerns _ concerns that
Netanyahu said were underscored by Sunday's attempted attack in the
center of Jerusalem.
	   Police spokesman Shmuel Ben-Ruby said the bombing was thwarted
when an off-duty Jerusalem policeman and a bus driver saw smoke
coming from a white van with front and back license plates that did
not match.
	   They smashed its windows, pulled out the burned driver and
called for help. Anti-terrorist police quickly arrived and
determined it was a car bomb, said Jerusalem police chief Yair
Yitzhaki.
	   Police described the van's contents as 600 liters (160 gallons)
of ``flammable fluid'' in plastic containers. Yitzhaki said the
material was capable of causing considerable damage and casualties.
	   ``A terrible tragedy was averted,'' he told reporters.
	   Police said the driver _ who had been previously jailed for
being a member of a ``hostile organization'' _ was hospitalized
under heavy police guard with serious burns. Israel radio said his
brother was arrested Sunday evening.
	   Members of the man's family, who live in the Al-Amari refugee
camp outside the West Bank town of Ramallah, said they knew nothing
of his activities on Sunday.
	   Jerusalem police remained on high alert in the wake of the
failed attack, said spokeswoman Linda Menuhin, and authorities
appealed for public vigilance.
	   ``I ask Jerusalemites to be on alert _ it's critical,'' the
police chief said.
	   While the bomb squad worked, a half-mile (kilometer) of
Jerusalem's main downtown thoroughfare and part of a downtown
pedestrian mall were closed for three hours.
	   Traffic backed up, large crowds milled behind the police
barricades, and scores of stores and restaurants were closed.
Sunday is a regular business day in Israel.
	   Army radio said Palestinian security forces were cooperating in
the investigation.
	   The attempted attack came almost a year after a pair of suicide
bombings in downtown Jerusalem that killed 25 people, including the
five bombers.

Separatists release Georgian commander held for three years
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ Abkhazian separatists freed a Georgian
military commander who had been held captive in the breakaway
province since 1995, Georgian national television reported Sunday.
	   Ruzgen Gogokhia, a battalion commander in Georgia's war with
Abkhazia in 1993, was taken captive by Abkhazians in 1995 when he
was a member of a Georgian delegation on the exchange of prisoners
of war.
	   In 1996, he was sentenced to death by an Abkhazian court, and
there had been rumors last year that he had been executed.
	   The television report did not say when or where Gogokhia was set
free. It quoted Avtandil Ioseliani, chief of military
reconnaissance, as saying the release was the result of recent
talks involving Georgia, Abkhazia and Chechnya.

	   PRATO, Italy (AP) _ Diego Nargiso powered past Zimbabwe's Genius
Chidzikwo 6-0, 6-2 Sunday as Italy, already assured of its third
straight Davis Cup semifinal appearance, moved within one point of
a quarterfinal sweep.
	   Nargiso had teamed with Italy's top player, Andrea Gaudenzi,
Saturday for a four-set doubles victory over brothers Byron and
Wayne Black that gave the hosts an insurmountable 3-0 lead in the
best-of-5 encounter.
	   Italy will face the United States in September in the
semifinals.
	   In Friday's opening singles matches, Gaudenzi, ranked 35th by
the ATP, beat Wayne Black 6-3, 6-3, 6-4, while Davide Sanguinetti,
a Wimbledon quarterfinalist, defeated Byron, 6-3, 6-3, 6-0. Then
Gaudenzi and Nargiso settled things with their 1-6, 7-5, 7-5, 6-3
doubles victory.
	   The Black brothers had lifted Zimbabwe past favored Australia
playing on grass, but had a difficult time on the slower red clay
in this town near Florence.

Another wave of immigrants arrives off Sicily
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAMPEDUSA, Sicily (AP) _ Hundreds of North Africans arrived on
this island between Tunisia and Sicily early Sunday in the latest
wave of would-be immigrants seeking entry into Italy.
	   Estimates for the numbers of arrivals varied widely because at
least three separate forces detained them -- the coast guard,
Carabinieri paramilitary police and financial police.
	   The ANSA news agency late Sunday afternoon put the number at
about 300, saying they landed in at least three boatloads. Most
were Moroccans and Tunisians, and most were expected to be expelled
immediately.
	   Immigrant smugglers often dupe their human cargo by dumping them
on the tiny island of Lampedusa, which sits south of Sicily and
about 100 kilometers (60 miles) east of Tunisia.
	   Clandestine immigrants arrive every week on Italy's long
coastlines when the weather turns warm and the water calm.

	   They smashed its windows, pulled out the burned driver and
called for help. Anti-terrorist police quickly arrived and
determined it was a car bomb, said Jerusalem police chief Yair
Yitzhaki.
	   Police described the van's contents as 600 liters (160 gallons)
of ``flammable fluid'' in plastic containers. Yitzhaki said the
material was capable of causing considerable damage and casualties.
	   ``A terrible tragedy was averted,'' he told reporters.
	   Police said the driver _ who had been previously jailed for
being a member of a ``hostile organization'' _ was hospitalized
under heavy police guard with serious burns. Israel radio said his
brother was arrested Sunday evening.
	   Members of the man's family, who live in the Al-Amari refugee
camp outside the West Bank town of Ramallah, said they knew nothing
of his activities on Sunday.
	   Jerusalem police remained on high alert in the wake of the
failed attack, said spokeswoman Linda Menuhin, and authorities
appealed for public vigilance.
	   The attempted attack came almost a year after a pair of suicide
bombings in downtown Jerusalem that killed 25 people, including the
five bombers.

Turkish Prime Minister faces censure motion
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz denied any
wrongdoing in the allocation of state land to a private company on
the eve of a debate by lawmakers over whether to censure him, a
newspaper reported Sunday.
	   The pro-Islamic Virtue Party moved in Parliament to censure
Yilmaz, whom it accuses of abusing his powers by giving land used
as a tree nursery near the western city of Izmit to a leading
Turkish holding company, Koc, to establish a Ford auto plant.
	   Parliament will debate the motion Monday. Voting is scheduled
for Wednesday.
	   ``My conscience is clear,'' Yilmaz told the daily Hurriyet. ``A
new design by Ford will be built in Turkey. This is a giant step
for the Turkish automotive industry.''
	   It was not clear if opposition parties would muster enough votes
to censure Yilmaz.
	   Yilmaz, leader of the center-right Motherland Party, is already
under investigation by Parliament over allegations that he tried to
conceal some of his personal wealth and on charges of unfairly
awarding consulting work to private firms.
	   He could face prosecution if the investigations find evidence of
guilt.
	   The Virtue Party is the main opposition party, with 145 deputies
in the 550-member Parliament. It is the successor of the Islamic
Welfare Party which was forced out of power by the secular military
last year because of its radical Islamic policies.

Most wanted criminal returned to Barbados
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRIDGETOWN, Barbados (AP) _ The most wanted criminal in
Barbados, a death row convict who twice escaped police custody, was
handed over to island officials by Trinidadian police Saturday
night.
	   Winston Hall, 34, was arrested in Trinidad and Tobago on an
arson charge. Barbadian prison officials said he would be put in a
high-security cell specially built to hold him.
	   Hall was sentenced to hang in 1985 for the murder of the manager
of Francia Plantation, a farm on Barbados.
	   He escaped from police that year while on the way to a
courthouse and was recaptured in 1989 while stowing away on a
cruiser liner in St. Vincent. He broke out of jail again in 1991.

Police battle secessionist guerrillas for control of Kosovo town

to fend off police attack on Orahovac, Serbs saying they control
the center of town, report of 20 KLA fighters killed early Sunday;

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Hundreds of Serb police battled
secessionist guerrillas for control of a central Kosovo town
Sunday, while refugees streamed into nearby hills to flee the
fighting.
	   Meanwhile, the Serb Media Center in Pristina, said that 20
ethnic Albanian rebel fighters were killed early Sunday when a few
hundred tried to cross the Albanian-Yugoslav border northwest of
Djakovica, the scene of an even bigger attempted incursion on
Saturday.
	   Both sides claimed they controlled most of the town of Orahovac,
about 50 kilometers (30 miles) southwest of Pristina, but
explosions and machine-gun fire echoed throughout surrounding hills
and several buildings burned intensely. Orahovac, with a normal
population of 20,000, is the largest town yet caught in the
five-month ethnic conflict.
	   Reporters on the scene said it wasn't clear if either force
controlled the town amid the house-to-house fighting and shelling
in one of the largest battles in the five-month conflict.
	   A few hours later, the Serb Media Center in Pristina said in a
press release that the Serbian security forces had gained ``total
control'' of the center of Orahovac and were calling in
telecommunication and other workers to restore the town's
infrastructure.
	   Witnesses said hundreds of refugees from nearby villages fled
the area in tractors and trailers as police and the ethnic Albanian
Kosovo Liberation Army deployed snipers and heavy weapons
throughout the wooded hills to battle for the third consecutive
day.
	   An ethnic Albanian guerrilla commander claimed earlier he was
using heavy weapons, including rocket launchers and vehicle-mounted
machine guns, to fight a siege by hundreds of police on Orahovac.
	   ``These steps were taken to change the quality of the war from
(fighting in) the countryside to urban areas,'' said the local KLA
commander in an interview with Associated Press Television. ``This
is the beginning of this type of war which will end up in
Pristina.''
	   Reporters with the guerrillas could see anti-aircraft guns,
heavy machine-guns and smaller arms.
	   The commander claimed 200 Serb policemen were in the Orahovac
police station, cut off from hundreds of reinforcements trying to
reach the area.
	   The commander said his forces killed at least 30 Serb policemen
and captured almost all of Orahovac since the guerrillas launched
an offensive on Orahovac late Friday.
	   The pro-government Serb Media Center said police captured most
of the town early Sunday.
	   The Kosovo Information Center said two civilians were killed and
four were wounded in the Orahovac area.
	   In a grenade attack on two other villages east of Orahovac, a
12-year-old girl and another teenager were killed, the center said
without providing other details.
	   The guerrilla offensive on Orahovac appeared aimed at expanding
the estimated 30 percent of the Serbian province they hold.
	   On Saturday, a Yugoslav army statement said some 1,000
``terrorists'' tried to cross from Albania into Kosovo, west of
Decani town. The attack was foiled and about 30 guerrillas were
``liquidated.''
	   The Serb media center said that in the same Mt. Djeravica area
northwest of Djakovica at least 20 KLA fighters were killed early
Sunday when several groups of Albanians tried to cross into
Yugoslavia.
	   In another border clash, Yugoslav forces on Saturday shelled
Padesh village on the Albanian border in an attempt to further
disrupt the guerrillas' gun-smuggling network. Albanian border
guards near Padesh reported seeing the bodies of dead and wounded
victims but gave no casualty count.
	   Ethnic Albanians, who outnumber Serbs 9-to-1 in Kosovo, are
demanding independence from Serbia, which makes up most of
present-day Yugoslavia.
	   Albania's deputy interior minister, Ilir Cano, said two Serb
mortar rounds landed inside Albanian territory. The Yugoslav army
denied any border violations and protested the repeated incursions.
	   In a statement condemning the shelling, the Albanian government
late Saturday spoke of ``barbarian acts.''
	   It called on foreign powers and organizations to help halt
``this fascist aggression,'' but also said it was capable of facing
``any provocations or threats.''
	   In a note sent to the Albanian Embassy in Belgrade, the Yugoslav
government protest the ``series of serious border incidents ...
five in the last two days.''
	   ``This points to the fact that Albanian government is tolerating
terrorist activities and grave violations of the state border,
without taking any measures to stop them,'' the protest note said.

birthday &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Far away from his Pretoria residence,
Indians celebrated South African President Nelson Mandela's 80th
birthday on Saturday in their own ways: the prime minister sent a
card, schoolchildren sang songs, and an army of barbers gave 3,000
free haircuts.
	   Celebrity barber M.S. Muthuraj, known to have given haircuts to
many famous Indian personalities, lined up a few hundred colleagues
to give free haircuts to children in the southern city of
Bangalore, Sunday's newspapers said. Muthuraj reveres Mandela and
wants to visit Johannesburg and meet the leader.
	   In New Delhi, schoolchildren sang and danced at colorful
cultural shows in honor of Mandela, hosted jointly by Africa Clubs
in the schools and the South African high commission, The Asian Age
reported.
	   Jerry Matsila, the South African High Commissioner to India, was
presented a birthday card for Mandela by the Indo-South Africa
Friendship Association, the paper said. The 18 signatories included
Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, opposition leader Sonia
Gandhi, four former film stars who are now lawmakers, an artist, a
former cricket captain and a leading journalist.
	   ``Your personal courage, political vision and strategic planning
for a mass struggle, have given your life an epic dimension,''
Indian President Kocheril Raman Narayanan wrote in a message to
Mandela.
	   ``Your Excellency has given to our times a quality of leadership
that occurs rarely in human affairs,'' he wrote.

Cypriot government protests arrival of Turkish warships, planes
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES with quotes from Turkish, Greek Cypriot
leaders; no pickup &QL; 
 &UR; By ALEX EFTY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ The Cypriot government accused Turkey on
Sunday of ``threatening peace'' by sending six warships and an
aerobatics squadron to the Turkish-occupied north of the island.
	   The air and naval units arrived to take part in celebrations,
beginning Monday, that mark the anniversary of Turkey's 1974
invasion of the island after a coup by Greek Cypriot supporters of
union with Greece.
	   Cypriot Defense Minister Yiannakis Omirou criticized the Turkish
deployment, saying: ``The international community must realize
after this latest Turkish display who is threatening peace and who
is the troublemaker in the region.''
	   In his annual address on the eve of the anniversary, Cypriot
President Glafcos Clerides said Greek Cypriots would ``not accept
the facts established by the Turkish invasion just as the
international community does not accept them.''
	   He appealed to the permanent members of the U.N. Security
Council ``to adopt a more decisive and coordinated approach''
toward Turkey.
	   On the other side of the demilitarized zone that divides Cyprus,
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash reminded his community of the
years before the invasion, when the Turkish minority suffered
discrimination from the Greek Cypriot majority and there was
inter-factional fighting and ethnic cleansing.
	   ``In the 1963-1974 period, the Greek Cypriot knife was held to
our throat. We held our heads high. We trusted (Turkey) and we
won,'' Denktash told the local Bayrak radio.
	   A breakaway Turkish Cypriot state, which Denktash heads, is
recognized only by Ankara, which maintains 35,000 troops there.
	   The anniversary of the invasion is getting more attention this
year because of increased tension over the Greek Cypriots' decision
to buy S-300 anti-aircraft missiles from Russia. Turkey has vowed
to act to stop their deployment, saying the missiles threaten its
security. Greece has warned it would respond to any attack on
Cyprus.
	   The latest peace talks between the two leaders collapsed in
August 1997 when Denktash insisted that Cyprus abandon its bid to
join the European Union and recognize the Turkish Cypriot statelet.
	   Referring to the West's recent efforts to revive peace talks,
Clerides said the Turkish side was setting new conditions ``in the
hope that in the end we shall be forced to accept its demands, or
that the problem will continue indefinitely and will eventually be
solved on the basis of the status quo.''
	   Clerides justified his purchase of the missiles, saying they
were ordered because of ``ever-threatening presence of the Turkish
occupation troops which are in attack formation and are able to
have immediate cover and reinforcements from neighboring Turkey.''
	   For his part, Denktash accused Greek Cypriots of wanting to
control all of Cyprus.
	   ``We hope that they do not chose to solve the problem by
force,'' he told a group of Turkish officials. ``(We hope they)
seek ways of compromising with Turkish Cypriots who have equal
rights. We are ready for this as long as they recognize our
status.''
	   Monday's celebrations in north Cyprus will feature a visit by
Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz and a show of precision flying
by seven jets of the Turkish air force.
	   Greek Cypriots began marking the anniversary Sunday with
memorial church services for the more than 5,000 Greek Cypriots who
were killed or disappeared during the invasion.
	   Organizations representing the 180,000 Greek Cypriot refugees
from the north plan to mount a series of demonstrations Monday
along the U.N.-patrolled buffer zone.

`Royal' wedding in Central Asia unites children of two presidents
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ALMATY, Kazakstan (AP) _ In the closest thing to a royal wedding
that the former Soviet Union is likely to see, the son of the
president of Kyrgyzstan married the daughter of the president of
Kazakstan on Sunday.
	   As many as four Central Asian presidents, including the fathers
of the bride and groom, were believed to have attended the wedding
at a mountain resort in Kyrgyzstan. The ceremony was relatively
small and private, with heavy security, and there was no official
announcement of who attended.
	   The groom was Aidar Akayev, the son of Kyrgyz President Askar
Akayev. The bride was Aliya Nazarbayev, the daughter of Kazakh
President Nursultan Nazarbayev. When they met, 4 1/2 years ago, he
is said to have joked that he would one day marry her.
	   Although the marriage is described as one of love, not politics,
it can't help but enhance relations between the two neighboring
countries, which have a common culture and enjoy generally good
relations.
	   ``People here are welcoming this wedding,'' Bernet Malikova of
the Kyrgyz presidential press service told the Moscow Times.
``Kyrgyz and Kazaks are really the same people, except that Kazaks
live on the steppe and Kyrgyz in the mountains.''
	   According to the newspaper, Aliya Nazarbayev is a student at
Georgetown University in Washington, and Aidar Akayev is just
completing an economics degree at the University of Maryland.

Desbiens takes lead on 8th stage with Tour approaching mountains
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: For AMS, Adds details, quotes
 &UR; BY SALVATORE ZANCA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MONTAUBAN, France (AP) - A hot day brought two Frenchman glory
Sunday with the Tour de France trying to return to racing after a
week of tumultuous events that rocked the Tour.
	   Ironically, a rider who was suspended for six months for failing
a drug test took over the overall lead.
	   Laurent Desbiens of France went into first by being part of a
breakaway that ended up more than seven minutes ahead of the pack.
	   Jacky Durand of France won the eighth stage as he was part of
the group that included Desbiens in the day's leg from Brive-La
Gaillarde to Montauban, 190 kilometers (118 miles).
	   Durand won the final sprint over Andrea Tafi with two other
Italians, Fabio Sacchi and Eddy Mazzoleni third and fourth.
	   Desbiens was fifth.
	   After a week of drug talk, ironically Desbiens was suspended for
six months in 1995 for nandrolone, a steroid, during a race in
France.
	   The major pack finished more than seven minutes behind Durand.
That was enough to let Desbians take the leader's yellow jersey
from defending champion Jan Ullrich of Germany who took it in
Saturday's time trial.
	   Temperatures reached above 40 C (104 F) on the road and the
major favorites in the pack let the small group escape without
risking much.
	   ``After 40 kilometers, I was tired already and I was giving
water to other members of the team just to help Hamburer,'' Durand
said. Hamburger was second in the overall standings at the time and
Durand was trying to keep him in contention.
	   ``The pack was tired because of the heat and somehow I wound up
with more water than expected,'' Durand said. ``Maybe that's why I
won.''
	   The extreme heat allowed Tour officials to change regulations on
route to allow water to be brought to the riders more often than
usual.
	   Desbiens is not expected to hold onto to the lead in the
mountains. Desbiens ended up nearly four hours behind Ullrich in
last year's final standings, placing 127th.
	   Ullrich is now fifth, 3:21 behind but he still has large margins
over his major rivals.
	   Bo Hamburger of Denmark is 1:18 behind Ullrich is sixth with
American Bobby Julich in seventh, in the same time as Hamburger.
	   Last year Desbiens won a stage by coming in second. Sergei
Outschalkov of Ukraine was first in Perpignan but was placed last
after a interference in the final sprint.
	   ``Last year I won a stage in special conditions,'' Desbiens
said. But I wanted to come back and do something better this year.
I came back and I had the feeling i could do something great this
year.''
	   The ninth stage is from Montauban to Pau at the base of the
mountains followed by two stages with four major climbs on Tuesday
and five on Wednesday. Three of the mountains are rated ''out of
category'' on a scale measuring height, distance and steepness.
	   Last year Ullrich made his first big move in the Pyrenees to
take control of the race for good, stretching his lead by minutes
over the final 12 days with the help of his German Telekom team.
	   Only the Festina team, led by Richard Virenque, was able to
challenge Ullrich and Telekom. Virenque was the only racer within10
minutes of Ullrich in 1997.
	   But the Festina team is gone now. Its ouster ended a hectic week
since making an historic start in Ireland July 11.
	   The leader of the first two days, Chris Boardman, fell and
crashed out of the race last Monday while wearing the yellow
jersey.
	   Then the drug scandel exploded. First Festina's director Bruno
Roussel was put into police detention for questioning with the team
doctor. Then they were moved to Lille for further investigation.
	   Tour officials decided to throw the Festina team out of the
three-week race Friday after after Roussel admitted a practice of
supplying illegal drugs with medical supervision to improve
performances.
	   The riders of the Festina team withdrew from the race Saturday
at the request of the Tour de France after first trying to defy the
ban and race in Saturday's time trial.
	   Roussel, team doctor Erik Ryckaert and team masseur Wily Voet
were still under police custody in Lille. Voet was jailed July 9
after customs officials found a stash of performance-enhacing drugs
in Voet's car bearing Festina emblems.
	   The three are expected to have their first confrontation in
court on July 24.

	   MONTAUBAN, France (AP) _ A quick look at Sunday's stage of the
85th Tour de France.
	   STAGE _ The eighth stage from Brive-La Gaillarde to Montauban,
190 kilometers (118 miles) south, approaching the Pyrenees.
	   WINNER _ Jacky Durand of France in a final sprint ahead of five
other riders who made a long break away in the 40 C (104 F) degre
heat.
	   YELLOW JERSEY _ Laurent Desbiens of France was a member of the
small group with Durand at the finish and took over the overall
lead.
	   HOW THE OTHERS FARED _ Jan Ullrich, who regained the yellow
jersey in Saturday's time trial, dropped to fifth, 3:21 behind.
	   American Bobby Julich is seventh, 4:49 behind.
	   Among others, Laurent Jalaabert, who replaced Richad Virenque as
the French hope, is eighth, 4:45 behind.
	   The 1996 winner, Bjarne Riis of Denmark and Ullrich's teammate
on the Telekom team, is dropping down, 7:12 behind at 26th.
	   TOUR TIDBIT _ Last year Laurent Desbiens won a stage by coming
in second. Sergei Outschalkov of Ukraine won the stage but was
placed last after a interference in the final sprint.
	   QUOTE OF THE DAY _ ``The page is turned, we can return to
cycling,'' Jacky Durand, on the day that the Tour de France had
much of its attention on the race and the heat of the day instead
of the Festina affair.
	   NEXT STAGE _ The ninth stage from Montauban to Pau, 210
kilometers (139 miles) at the base of the Pyrenees.

Bjorkman beats Kiefer as Sweden reaches Davis Cup semis

<TEXT>
	   HAMBURG, Germany (AP) _ Jonas Bjorkman Sunday picked up right
where he left off last year in Davis Cup, winning the decisive
point as defending champion Sweden beat Germany.
	   Bjorkman, fighting a hostile crowd, outlasted Nicolas Kiefer
6-3, 4-6, 6-2, 5-7, 6-4 to hand Sweden an insurmountable 3-1 lead
in their World Group matchup and send his country into the
semifinals.
	   Bjorkman, the world's ninth-ranked player, was the Swedish
team's mainstay last year. He won both his singles and the doubles
as Sweden took home its seventh Davis Cup with a 5-0 rout of the
United States in the final.
	   But in the middle of a wild three hour, 18 minute match against
the stubborn Kiefer, the 26-year-old Swede began to wonder if he
would pull out the match.
	   ``I had doubts a lot of times I would win,'' said Bjorkman, 26.
``I didn't play well, but then you pick up a point and get back in
the match. I never gave up.''
	   Bjorkman came out on the short end of a fourth set in which
neither he or Kiefer, ranked 27th, could hold serve amidst the
steady booing of 10,200 spectators, angered by some close calls
against the German.
	   Bjorkman lost his serve to fall behind 4-5, broke back, then
double faulted to drop the next game and the set.
	   In the fifth set, the Swede let a 40-0 lead slip away on errors
at 4-4, then found himself pinned at the net on break point after a
weak volley.
	   But Kiefer, 21, rifled a return into the net instead of the open
court.
	   ``Bjorkman's hard to beat, but Kiefer had his chances,'' said a
disappointed German captain, Carl-Uwe Steeb.
	   Sweden faces Spain Sept. 25-27, while the United States tackles
Italy in the second semifinal.
	   Bjorkman was beaten by Tommy Haas in Friday's first single, but
bounced back in doubles with Nicklas Kulti to down the German duo
of Boris Becker and David Prinosil.
	   The win, which gave Sweden a 2-1 lead in the tie, was the sixth
straight for the Swedish duo which went unbeaten last year in Davis
Cup play.
	   Tommy Haas plays Magnus Larsson in the meaningless final singles
later Sunday.
	   Thomas Enqvist picked up Sweden's first point, when he raced
past Kiefer in three sets in Friday's singles play.

Omani foreign minister arrives in Saudi Arabia for border talks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ Oman's foreign minister arrived in
Saudi Arabia on Sunday for talks with the government on an
Omani-Yemeni border agreement to which the Saudis object.
	   A spokesman for the Omani Embassy said that Foreign Minister
Youssef bin Alawi would hold talks with Saudi Crown Prince
Abdullah.
	   The minister arrived in the western port of Jiddah.
	   Saudi Arabia recently lodged a formal protest with the
Cairo-based Arab League over a border agreement signed by Oman and
Yemen in 1992. The Saudis say the pact seeks to incorporate Saudi
territory.
	   The protest has angered Yemen and Oman, which both share borders
with oil-rich Saudi Arabia.
	   Yemen and Saudi Arabia have been locked in a border dispute for
years.

Man charged with deaths of three in attempted potato theft
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A man in Russia's Far East was arrested for
killing three people who tried to steal potatoes from his garden, a
news agency reported Sunday.
	   The man, who was not identified, allegedly came home, saw the
three digging up his potatoes, grabbed a hunting rifle, shot them
to death and buried them nearby, Interfax reported.
	   The man was a resident of Vladivostok, the main port city on
Russia's Pacific coast, but had a country home nearby in the hamlet
of Bavykino, where the shooting occurred. He was arrested three
days after the killing, Interfax said.
	   Many Russians survive on the vegetables they grow in rural
plots. There have been other recent cases of people killed while
trying to steal them.

Paper suggests painkiller caused fit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Ronaldo's dramatic bedroom convulsion only hours
before last weekend's World Cup final may have been caused by a
reaction to a common painkiller, a press report said Sunday.
	   The Mail on Sunday suggested that the Brazilian striker, whose
lackluster performance was seen as a major reason for Brazil's poor
showing in the 3-0 loss to France, took a combination of an
anti-inflammatory, cortisone, and the painkiller, lignocaine,
because of a knee injury.
	   The paper quoted British Olympic doctor Michael Turner as saying
that an injection of lignocaine could result in exactly the sort of
fit Ronaldo suffered on the afternoon before the final at the Stade
de France.
	   ``There's always a great temptation in sport to stick a needle
in someone before a big game and give them something stronger,''
Turner told the Mail on Sunday.
	   ``If you had strained a knee ligament, there's a very good
chance you would be given an injection of cortisone and lignocaine
and that injection would be administered by the team doctor.
	   ``If it was lignocaine they used, then it is a drug noted to
have side effects that include convulsions,'' Turner said.
	   ``Normally the dosage is quite small but, if it went into a
vein, who knows? It's a case of patch them up and send them out.''
	   The paper quoted from a standard phamarcology textbook which
states: ``Lignocaine overdoses can result in seizures, coma,
respiratory arrest and death. Seizures also have been reported
after excessive doses administered on the skin.''
	   Ronaldo's room-mate, Roberto Carlos, raised the alarm when he
went into the room at the Chateau de Grande Romaine at Lesigny to
see the young striker in a convulsion on his bed.
	   Brazilian team officials initially pulled Ronaldo from the
starting lineup and then reinstated him 45 minutes before kick off.
	   Reports after the game suggested that Ronaldo may have suffered
an epileptic fit possibly brought on by stress. Although the player
dismissed the theory, the reasons for his pre-match convulsion
remain a mystery.
	   Piero Volpi, team doctor for Ronaldo's Italian club, Inter
Milan, has flown to Rio to see the player for himself.

Report: Germans invade Spanish island of Mallorca
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The German middle and upper classes are
``invading'' the Spanish Mediterranean resort island of Mallorca,
according to a report published Sunday in a major national daily.
	   Germans have bought up about 20 percent of Mallorca, one of the
Balearic Islands off Spain's eastern coast, evidence of a trend
that began six years ago and has yet to reach its peak, the
newspaper El Mundo reported.
	   Top model Claudia Schiffer recently built a villa on the south
east of the island, tennis star Boris Becker retreats to a refuge
in the west, and businessman Klaus Graf owns a village in the
center, El Mundo said.
	   The island is also awash with restaurants, stores, discotheques,
doctors, dentists, vets and real estate agents that cater to the
specific needs of the several million Germans who visit annually,
and the 30,000 who have made Mallorca their permanent or seasonal
home.
	   But impressive economic growth figures in recent years
associated with this influx of Deutsch marks is apparently no
guarantee against resentment.
	   The El Mundo report quoted politicians complaining that the
foreigners showed little desire to integrate into island life, and
last week the Balearic Islands regional parliament passed
legislation forcing businesses that advertise or label products in
foreign languages to provide matching Spanish or Catalan.
	   Last year pamphlets were distributed in Mallorca declaring ``no
to German colonialism,'' and an Association for the Defense of
Mallorca was set up, evidence according to the El Mundo report that
locals feel marginalized from the prosperity.
	   1997 also saw the creation of the German Friends of Spain, a
group formed to further the interests of German residents of
Mallorca.
	   The Balearic Islands are also a popular destination for British
tourists and vacation home hunters.

Yemeni minister says land dispute with Saudis is a threat to
</HEADLINE>
region &QL; 
 &UR; By ANTHONY SHADID &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ A simmering border dispute between Saudi
Arabia and Yemen could upset security on the Arabian Peninsula,
Yemen's foreign minister said in an interview Sunday.
	   His warning was the latest in a little-known but potentially
explosive standoff along the 2,000-kilometer (1,300-mile) frontier
between the uneasy neighbors, whose decades-old quarrel erupted
into fighting in 1995 when 20,000 Saudi troops and hundreds of
tanks crossed into Yemen.
	   Large swaths of the border, particularly a part of the desert
known as the Empty Quarter, remain undefined.
	   ``A collapse in security between Yemen and Saudi Arabia would be
a collapse in security for the whole region,'' Foreign Minister
Abdul-Qader Bajammal told The Associated Press.
	   Any conflict could spill over into the Gulf, through which much
of the world's oil passes, he said. It could also endanger
countries on the Red Sea, which separates the Arabian peninsula
from Africa.
	   Last week, Yemen accused Saudi Arabia of occupying parts of the
border region as a way of ``putting pressure on Yemen.''
	   Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil producer and one of
Washington's main allies, denied any violation of Yemeni territory.
Saudi Arabia rarely comments on the dispute over the border region,
home to potentially lucrative oil fields.
	   Yemen, a country of rugged mountains and fertile valleys on the
southern tip of the Arabian Peninsula, has long contested Saudi
Arabia's claim to parts of the Empty Quarter and to three small but
strategic islands near the mouth of the Red Sea.
	   Frustrated with the lack of progress in talks, Yemen says it
wants to take the dispute to international arbitration. But the
Saudis have rejected this idea.
	   ``If there is no intention to solve the border dispute in a
friendly and honest manner, then there's no way out of the
problem,'' said Bajammal, who also serves as deputy prime minister.
	   Tension over the border dispute follows weeks of strife in
Yemen, one of the Arab world's poorest countries.
	   A government decision to raise fuel prices by 40 percent _ in
line with demands by the International Monetary Fund _ was met by
four days of protests in the capital, San`a, and other cities.
	   Restive tribesmen, many of them well armed, took advantage of
the unrest to press their demands for government funds and a bigger
share of revenue from the oil extracted in their regions. Dozens
were killed in the ensuing clashes with government forces.
	   Bajammal accused Saudi Arabia of backing the tribesmen to
undermine Yemen's stability.
	   ``The groups shaking the security in Yemen are known, very well
known historically, by their behavior and by their relations with
groups in Saudi Arabia,'' he said.

50 prisoners escape from two Sao Paulo jails
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) - Fifty prisoners escaped from two
Sao Paulo jails Sunday by digging tunnels from their cells to city
streets, a television station reported.
	   The jailbreaks occurred at the Vila Rica and Perreira Barreto
precinct jails. By Sunday afternoon, none of the prisoner had been
recaptured, said TV Globo News.
	   The escapes occurred just one week before some 6,000 prisoners
are scheduled to be transferred from city jails to 21 recently
built state prisons. Sao Paulo, Brazil's richest and most populous
state, has the nation's most prisoners-- more than 60,000 -- and
the most prison rebellions and escapes.
	   In most cases, outbursts are caused by overcrowding and the slow
process to move the state jail population to prisons with more
space.
	   Prisoners often sleep on floors or are forced to share the same
bed by sleeping in shifts. Substandard food, hygiene and medical
care is typical.

Israel had sent Mossad agents to Europe to find Manbar
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DANNA HARMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu confirmed
reports Sunday that two operatives from the Mossad spy agency were
killed in a European capital several years ago while chasing an
Israeli man wanted for selling weapons materials to Iran.
	   The man, Nahum Manbar, was arrested last year as he entered
Israel. In a closed-door trial, he was convicted of treason and
sentenced last week to 16 years in jail for selling millions of
dollars of chemical weapons materials to Iran, an enemy of the
Jewish state.
	   The trail had been tinged by scandal and Sunday police announced
they were beginning a preliminary investigation into allegations of
misconduct surrounding the case including defense charges that the
judge had an improper relationship with a female member of the
defense team and discussed the case with Netanyahu.
	   Israeli newspapers and The Sunday Times of London both published
reports Sunday that two Israeli agents were killed in a motorcycle
accident while chasing Manbar.
	   Asked to confirm the reports, Netanyahu said ``As far as the
deaths of the two Mossad agents, yes, this was of course known to
me.''
	   The Times said the agents died while trailing Manbar through the
streets of Vienna but Netanyahu would not divulge details of the
incident.
	   ``I don't think there is any point going into details of the
surveillance and other particulars connected with the operations of
Israel's security agencies,'' Netanyahu told reporters at a news
conference.
	   Manbar, who had pleaded innocent in his trial, claimed that his
business dealings with Iran were known to Israel's intelligence
agencies and that he never hid any of his activities.
	   The Times reported that Manbar had cooperated with, and perhaps
worked for the Israeli security service until 1993, offering his
business connections to help find missing Israeli airman Ron Arad
believed held by Iran.
	   The Defense Ministry denied the report and issued a statement
saying Manbar had offered phony leads on the navigator shot down
over Lebanon in 1986.
	   ``Nachum Manbar approached the defense establishment with a
variety of suggestions, ostensibly to give us information and a
sign of life from missing navigator Ron Arad,'' the statement said.
	   ``All of Manbar's suggestions were carefully checked and found
to be completely false.'' The statement said Israel received no
help from Manbar regarding Arad, but did not address reports that
Manbar had helped intelligence agencies with other matters.
	   Eitan Haber, who served as a senior advisor to Yitzhak Rabin,
prime minister at the time of the Mossad deaths, told Israel's
Channel 2 TV that ``Manbar was being followed in a European
capital,'' when the agents died. He said that capturing Manbar had
been a top priority for Rabin, who was premier from 1992 until his
assassination in 1995.

<TEXT>
	   STUTTGART, Germany (AP) _ Kenya's Japheth Kimutai shattered
Sebastian Coe's stadium record by two seconds Sunday as he captured
the 800 meters at the Stuttgart track meet.
	   Kimutai, who owns the junior record in the event, ran the year's
fastest time at the distance of one minute, 42.76 seconds at
Gottlieb Daimler Stadium.
	   The 19-year-old led a sweep of Kenyans of the top six places in
the event with Kenneth Kimwetich finishing second at 1:43.03.
	   Wilson Boit Kipketer also produced another best this year in the
3,000 steeplechase with a run of 8:01.05 as fellow Kenyan Paul
Kosgei grabbed second in 8:07.86.
	   Namibia's Frankie Fredericks fought a strong backwind to win the
100 meters in 10.11 seconds. Ghana's Eric Nkansah was second in
10.19, edging Nigeria's Davidson Ezinwa in the same time.
	   Morocco's Zahra Ouaziz captured the 1500 in 4:00.60, while
Kenya's John Kibowen won the men's race in 3:30.76 Minuten.
	   Lithuania's Virgilius Alekna tossed 66.43 meters to win the
discuss as Adam Settliff of the United States grabbed second at
65.45. The Olympic champion, Germany's Lars Riedel, finished third
at 65.44 before injuring himself and being taken to the hospital
for treatment.
	   In the women's 800, Cathy Rounds led a sweep for the United
States of the top two places with a race of 1:59.97, followed by
Michelle Dimuro-Ave at 2:00.34.
	   Another American, Courtney Hawkins, captured the 110 hurdles in
a time of 13.19.

<TEXT>
	   PRATO, Italy (AP) _ Davide Sanguinetti outlasted Zimbabwe's
Wayne Black 6-4, 3-6, 6-1 Sunday as Italy, already assured of its
third straight Davis Cup semifinal appearance, completed a 5-0
sweep of their quarterfinal.
	   In the other reverse singles match Sunday, Diego Nargiso powered
past Zimbabwe's Genius Chidzikwo 6-0, 6-2.
	   Nargiso had teamed with Italy's top player, Andrea Gaudenzi,
Saturday for a four-set doubles victory over Wayne Black and his
brother, Byron, that gave the hosts an insurmountable 3-0 lead in
the best-of-5 encounter.
	   Italy will face the United States in September in the
semifinals.
	   In Friday's opening singles matches, Gaudenzi, ranked 35th by
the ATP, beat Wayne Black 6-3, 6-3, 6-4, while Sanguinetti, a
Wimbledon quarterfinalist, defeated Byron, 6-3, 6-3, 6-0. Then
Gaudenzi and Nargiso settled things with their 1-6, 7-5, 7-5, 6-3
doubles victory.
	   The Black brothers had lifted Zimbabwe past favored Australia
playing on grass, but had a difficult time on the slower red clay
in this town near Florence.

Cypriot government protests arrival of Turkish warships, planes
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES with quotes from Turkish, Greek Cypriot
leaders; no pickup &QL; 
 &UR; By ALEX EFTY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ The Cypriot government accused Turkey on
Sunday of ``threatening peace'' by sending six warships and an
aerobatics squadron to the Turkish-occupied north of the island.
	   The air and naval units arrived to take part in celebrations,
beginning Monday, that mark the anniversary of Turkey's 1974
invasion of the island after a coup by Greek Cypriot supporters of
union with Greece.
	   Cypriot Defense Minister Yiannakis Omirou criticized the Turkish
deployment, saying: ``The international community must realize
after this latest Turkish display who is threatening peace and who
is the troublemaker in the region.''
	   In his annual address on the eve of the anniversary, Cypriot
President Glafcos Clerides appealed to the permanent members of the
U.N. Security Council ``to adopt a more decisive and coordinated
approach'' toward Turkey.
	   On the other side of the demilitarized zone that divides Cyprus,
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash reminded his community of the
years before the invasion, when the Turkish minority suffered
discrimination from the Greek Cypriot majority and there was
inter-factional fighting and ethnic cleansing.
	   ``In the 1963-1974 period, the Greek Cypriot knife was held to
our throat. We held our heads high. We trusted (Turkey) and we
won,'' Denktash told the local Bayrak radio.
	   A breakaway Turkish Cypriot state, which Denktash heads, is
recognized only by Ankara, which maintains 35,000 troops there.
	   The anniversary of the invasion is getting more attention this
year because of increased tension over the Greek Cypriots' decision
to buy S-300 anti-aircraft missiles from Russia. Turkey has vowed
to act to stop their deployment, saying the missiles threaten its
security. Greece has warned it would respond to any attack on
Cyprus.
	   The latest peace talks between the two leaders collapsed in
August 1997 when Denktash insisted that Cyprus abandon its bid to
join the European Union and recognize the Turkish Cypriot
government.
	   Monday's celebrations in north Cyprus will feature a visit by
Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz and a show of precision flying
by seven jets of the Turkish air force.
	   Greek Cypriots began marking the anniversary Sunday with
memorial church services for the more than 5,000 Greek Cypriots who
were killed or disappeared during the invasion.
	   Organizations representing the 180,000 Greek Cypriot refugees
from the north plan to mount a series of demonstrations Monday
along the U.N.-patrolled buffer zone.

EU and Iran finish second day of talks, admitting division
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ European Union and Iranian officials
finished a second day of talks here Sunday, with both sides
admitting differences but expressing a will to cooperate.
	   The leader of the EU team, Albert Rohan of Austria, emerged from
talks with Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi, saying the EU
was committed to dialogue with Iran.
	   ``Some differences exist, but we are working to explore grounds
for Iran-EU cooperation in various areas, especially economic
cooperation,'' the official Islamic Republic News Agency quoted the
secretary general of the Austrian Foreign Ministry as saying.
	   The EU is known to be anxious that its companies win contracts
for the development of Iran's oil and gas fields.
	   Kharrazi told the agency: ``It is clear some differences may
come up, but we should work to pave the way for Iran-EU
cooperation.''
	   The agency did not say whether the discussions covered Salman
Rushdie, the British author whom Iran sentenced to death in 1989
for his allegedly blasphemous novel ``The Satanic Verses.''
	   But in comments on Saturday's talks, Iranian Deputy Foreign
Minister Morteza Sarmadi made clear the Rushdie issue was a
significant dispute.
	   The EU had asked Iran ``to distance itself from the reward set
for Rushdie,'' Sarmadi told the news agency Sunday.
	   Iran has refused to revoke the death sentence and an official
Iranian foundation has offered a bounty of more than dlrs 2 million
for the death of Rushdie, who lives in hiding under British police
protection.
	   Sarmadi said the West must revise its notion of free speech, the
agency reported.
	   The talks were the first since the EU broke off its ``critical
dialogue'' with Iran in April 1997 after a German court found that
Iranian leaders had ordered the killings of Kurdish-Iranian
dissidents in Berlin.
	   The EU has sought to normalize ties following the inauguration
of President Mohammad Khatami last August. A moderate cleric,
Khatami has tried to temper Iran's hard-line foreign and domestic
policies.
	   The visiting team includes foreign ministry officials from
Britain, Austria and Germany, representing the past, present and
future holders of the EU's rotating presidency. The team is due to
leave Iran on Monday.
	   Iranian newspapers say Tehran expected the talks to go beyond
the usual Western concerns about Iran's human rights record and
allegations that Tehran was sponsoring international terrorism and
seeking nuclear weapons.

Israel had sent Mossad agents to Europe to find Manbar
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DANNA HARMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu confirmed
reports Sunday that two operatives from the Mossad spy agency died
in a European capital several years ago while chasing an Israeli
man wanted for selling weapons materials to Iran.
	   The man, Nahum Manbar, was arrested last year as he entered
Israel. In a closed-door trial, he was convicted of treason and
sentenced to 16 years in jail for selling millions of dollars of
chemical weapons materials to Iran.
	   The trail had been tinged by scandal and Sunday police announced
they were beginning a preliminary investigation into allegations of
misconduct surrounding the case including defense charges that the
judge had an improper relationship with a female member of the
defense team and discussed the case with Netanyahu.
	   Israeli newspapers and The Sunday Times of London both published
reports Sunday that two Israeli agents were killed in a motorcycle
accident while chasing Manbar.
	   Asked to confirm the reports, Netanyahu said ``As far as the
deaths of the two Mossad agents, yes, this was of course known to
me.''
	   The Times said the agents died while trailing Manbar through the
streets of Vienna but Netanyahu would not divulge details of the
incident.
	   Manbar, who had pleaded innocent in his trial, claimed that his
business dealings with Iran were known to Israel's intelligence
agencies and that he never hid any of his activities.
	   The Times reported that Manbar had cooperated with, and perhaps
worked for the Israeli security service until 1993, offering his
business connections to help find missing Israeli airman Ron Arad
believed held by Iran.
	   The Defense Ministry denied the report and issued a statement
saying Manbar had offered phony leads on the navigator shot down
over Lebanon in 1986.

Report: New evidence of drug links with former prosecutor
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Prosecutors have received new testimony
linking former assistant attorney general Mario Ruiz Massieu to
drug trafficking in Mexico, local media reported Sunday.
	   The testimony by members of the Gulf and Juarez drug cartels
against Ruiz Massieu may help win his extradition from the United
States, where he has been under arrest since he fled Mexico in
1995.
	   Ruiz Massieu allegedly received large payments from drug
traffickers to provide protection for their shipments of cocaine
through Mexico, according to prosecutors quoted by the daily
newspaper El Universal.
	   That testimony follows an appearance by a former Mexican police
director before a Houston grand jury, in which he said collected
nearly dlrs 2 million in payoffs in 1993 and 1994 and turned the
money over to Ruiz Massieu.
	   Ruiz Massieu's lawyers have successfully fought four extradition
requests filed by Mexican prosecutors. An immigration judge
dismissed deportation proceedings against Ruiz Massieu in May 1997.
The government is appealing that decision and he remains under
house arrest in New Jersey pending a decision.
	   Ruiz Massieu, 46, who served for a time as Mexico's top
anti-drug prosecutor, has said he is innocent and maintains he is a
victim of political persecution by the current Mexican government.

EU and Iran finish second day of talks, admitting division

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ European Union and Iranian officials
finished a second day of talks here Sunday, with both sides
admitting differences but expressing a will to cooperate.
	   The leader of the EU team, Albert Rohan of Austria, emerged from
talks with Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi, saying the EU
was committed to dialogue with Iran.
	   ``Some differences exist, but we are working to explore grounds
for Iran-EU cooperation in various areas, especially economic
cooperation,'' the official Islamic Republic News Agency quoted the
secretary general of the Austrian Foreign Ministry as saying.
	   The EU is known to be anxious that its companies win contracts
for the development of Iran's oil and gas fields.
	   Kharrazi told the agency: ``It is clear some differences may
come up, but we should work to pave the way for Iran-EU
cooperation.''
	   The agency did not say whether the discussions covered Salman
Rushdie, the British author whom Iran sentenced to death in 1989
for his allegedly blasphemous novel ``The Satanic Verses.''
	   But in comments on Saturday's talks, Iranian Deputy Foreign
Minister Morteza Sarmadi made clear the Rushdie issue was a
significant dispute.
	   The EU had asked Iran ``to distance itself from the reward set
for Rushdie,'' Sarmadi told the news agency Sunday.
	   Iran has refused to revoke the death sentence and an official
Iranian foundation has offered a bounty of more than dlrs 2 million
for the death of Rushdie, who lives in hiding under British police
protection.
	   Sarmadi said the West must revise its notion of free speech, the
agency reported.
	   The talks were the first since the EU broke off its ``critical
dialogue'' with Iran in April 1997 after a German court found that
Iranian leaders had ordered the killings of Kurdish-Iranian
dissidents in Berlin.
	   The EU has sought to normalize ties following the inauguration
of President Mohammad Khatami last August. A moderate cleric,
Khatami has tried to temper Iran's hard-line foreign and domestic
policies.
	   The visiting team includes foreign ministry officials from
Britain, Austria and Germany, representing the past, present and
future holders of the EU's rotating presidency. The team is due to
leave Iran on Monday.
	   Iranian newspapers say Tehran expected the talks to go beyond
the usual Western concerns about Iran's human rights record and
allegations that Tehran was sponsoring international terrorism and
seeking nuclear weapons.

Former prime minister says he'll be next Russian president
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Former Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin
predicted Sunday that he would be the next president of Russia.
	   Chernomyrdin, who was fired by President Boris Yeltsin in March,
had previously said he would run for president in the next
election, scheduled for 2000. Asked in a television interview
Sunday whether he thought he would win, he said without hesitation,
``Yes.''
	   Yeltsin has said he has no intention of running for re-election,
although there has been speculation that he will anyway. The
constitution would appear to bar him from running for a third term,
but some aides claim his first term doesn't count because it began
during the Soviet era.
	   Asked whether he thinks Yeltsin will run despite his statements
to the contrary, Chernomyrdin said, ``I have no reason to mistrust
our president.''

<TEXT>
	   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) _ Facing simmering anger from an
impoverished, ethnically-divided populace, Nigeria's new military
ruler was to unveil his plan Monday for embarking on a transition
to democracy, a newspaper reported Sunday.
	   Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar was to announce his plan in a national
TV and radio broadcast Monday evening, the newspaper said.
	   ``The government is a listening one,'' his spokesman, David
Attah, was quoted as saying in the Lagos Guardian. ``The nation
should rest assured that all the various issues touching on the
survival of the nation will be addressed.''
	   Some opposition politicians that Abubakar has consulted recently
expect him to appoint a new cabinet and say he may name a civilian
from southern Nigeria, where opposition to the military government
is strongest, to run day-to-day government affairs.
	   Abubakar has been promising for several weeks to announce his
transition program, but has hedged on the timing. He took power
after the death of dictator Gen. Sani Abacha early in June. Nigeria
has been ruled by military governments for most of its 38 years as
an independent state.
	   Attah did not elaborate on the plan and did not say whether
Abubakar had agreed to opposition demands for a government of
national unity comprising a broad spectrum of political groups.
	   Abubakar was expected to stay on until elections are held, the
paper said.
	   As part of his promise to move toward democracy, Abubakar has
freed dozens of political prisoners. But Nigeria's most prominent
detainee, Moshood Abiola, died in prison of apparent heart disease
earlier this month. His death sparked several days of rioting.
	   Abiola was the apparent winner of presidential elections in 1993
that were annulled by the military. He was jailed the following
year.
	   Western governments that shunned Nigeria under Abacha, who often
jailed his opponents and on occasion put them to death, have begun
cautiously restoring ties with Abubakar's government in
anticipation of democratic reforms.

Israel wants new court to reconsider occupied land a crime
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VITA BEKKER
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A United Nations treaty creating a war crimes
tribunal was rejected by Israel because it would consider occupying
land to be a punishable crime, officials said Sunday.
	   Israel's foreign ministry said the Jewish state, founded on the
ashes of the Nazi Holocaust, was in a bind when it came to the
historic agreement.
	   ``As a people that suffered from the most terrible crime in
history, genocide, setting up of such a court has always been a
very important development as far as Israel is concerned,'' said
Alan Baker, a legal expert with the foreign ministry.
	   The treaty, signed and approved by more than 100 nations Friday
in Rome, lists the establishment of settlements on occupied land as
punishable along with genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes
and aggression.
	   Israel has annexed formerly Jordanian east Jerusalem and
occupied most of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, home to over two
million Palestinians, since capturing the areas from Jordan and
Egypt in the 1967 Mideast war. Successive governments have offered
incentives and encouraged citizens to move to the areas, now home
to some 150,000 Jewish settlers.
	   Baker said that signing the agreement would have put potentially
hundreds of thousands of Israelis at risk or prosecution.
	   ``Israel has no choice but to go against any such statute which
would render Israelis war criminals just for being active in
setting up or establishing settlements,'' Baker said at a news
conference Sunday.
	   Israel was one of several nations which backed away from signing
the treaty. The United States also refused to sign after failing to
secure an exemption for American citizens from the court's
authority.
	   Baker said that the occupied lands article was wrongly included
in the treaty and charged that Arab nations would use it to condemn
Israel at the United Nations assembly.
	   The treaty will be ratified once at least 60 countries, roughly
a third of the U.N., approve it in their governments. The treaty is
not retroactive and will only apply to crimes occurring after its
ratification. Changes could be made in the treaty in the next seven
years, and Baker said plans to fight for the revision of the
wording of the crimes list.
	   ``We still believe in the idea and we hope that the
establishment of an international war crimes court...will not
become another political tool to be used against Israel,''Baker
said.

Police battle secessionist guerrillas for control of Kosovo town

fend off police attack on Orahovac, Serbs saying they control the

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Hundreds of Serb police battled
secessionist guerrillas for control of a central Kosovo town
Sunday, while refugees streamed into nearby hills to flee the
fighting.
	   The Serb Media Center in Pristina also said 20 ethnic Albanian
rebel fighters were killed early Sunday when a few hundred tried to
cross the Albanian-Yugoslav border northwest of Djakovica, the
scene of an even bigger attempted incursion on Saturday.
	   Both sides claimed they controlled most of the town of Orahovac,
about 50 kilometers (30 miles) southwest of Pristina, but
explosions and machine-gun fire echoed throughout the surrounding
hills and several buildings burned. Orahovac, with a normal
population of 20,000, is the largest town caught in the five-month
ethnic conflict so far.
	   Reporters on the scene said it wasn't clear if either force
controlled the town amid the house-to-house fighting and shelling
in one of the largest battles in the five-month conflict.
	   A few hours later, the Serb Media Center said in a press release
that the Serbian security forces had gained ``total control'' of
the center of Orahovac and were calling in telecommunication and
other workers to restore the town's infrastructure.
	   Witnesses said hundreds of refugees from nearby villages fled
the area in tractors and trailers as police and the ethnic Albanian
Kosovo Liberation Army deployed snipers and heavy weapons
throughout the wooded hills to battle for the third consecutive
day.
	   An ethnic Albanian guerrilla commander claimed earlier he was
using heavy weapons, including rocket launchers and vehicle-mounted
machine guns, to fight a siege by hundreds of police on Orahovac.
	   ``These steps were taken to change the quality of the war from
(fighting in) the countryside to urban areas,'' said the local KLA
commander in an interview with Associated Press Television. ``This
is the beginning of this type of war which will end up in
Pristina.''
	   Reporters with the guerrillas could see anti-aircraft guns,
heavy machine-guns and small arms.
	   The commander claimed 200 Serb policemen were in the Orahovac
police station, cut off from hundreds of reinforcements trying to
reach the area.
	   The commander said his forces killed at least 30 Serb policemen
and captured almost all of Orahovac since the guerrillas launched
an offensive on Orahovac late Friday.
	   The Kosovo Information Center said two civilians were killed and
four were wounded in the Orahovac area.
	   In a grenade attack on two other villages east of Orahovac, a
12-year-old girl and another teenager were killed, the center said
without providing other details.
	   The guerrilla offensive on Orahovac appeared aimed at expanding
the estimated 30 percent of the Serbian province they hold.
	   Ethnic Albanians, who outnumber Serbs 9-to-1 in Kosovo, are
demanding independence from Serbia, which makes up most of
present-day Yugoslavia.
	   In another border clash, Yugoslav forces on Saturday shelled
Padesh village on the Albanian border in an attempt to further
disrupt the guerrillas' gun-smuggling network. Albanian border
guards near Padesh reported seeing the bodies of dead and wounded
victims but gave no casualty count.
	   Albania's deputy interior minister, Ilir Cano, said two Serb
mortar rounds landed inside Albanian territory. The Yugoslav army
denied any border violations and protested the repeated incursions.
	   In a statement condemning the shelling, the Albanian government
late Saturday spoke of ``barbarian acts.''
	   It called on foreign powers and organizations to help halt
``this fascist aggression,'' but also said it was capable of facing
``any provocations or threats.''
	   In a note sent to the Albanian Embassy in Belgrade, the Yugoslav
government protest the ``series of serious border incidents ...
five in the last two days.''
	   ``This points to the fact that Albanian government is tolerating
terrorist activities and grave violations of the state border,
without taking any measures to stop them,'' the protest note said.

Man shot to death in paramilitary `punishment' attack
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS dateline to Belfast, deletes extraneous words in graf
2. Edits to trim &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Gunmen shot a man to death
early Sunday on the stairs of his Belfast apartment building in
what police said appeared to be a punishment attack by
paramilitaries.
	   Andy Kearney, 33, was with his mother and 2-week-old daughter in
his apartment in the Catholic New Lodge area when five men burst in
soon after midnight, police said.
	   The men disconnected the family's phone, then took Kearney to an
outside stairwell, where they shot him in both legs, said a police
spokesman, speaking with customary anonymity. Kearney died later of
his injuries.
	   Police Superintendent Tim McGregor said the attack appeared to
be a paramilitary punishment shooting. It was not immediately clear
if it was the work of the Irish Republican Army _ which despite its
cease-fire, has continued to inflict punishment beatings and
shootings on scores of people accused of criminal behavior _ or was
inflicted by members of a splinter republican group.
	   Kearney's mother Maureen, 65, said she believed her son had been
targeted by republican paramilitaries because of a personal grudge.
``If they don't like you you are dispensable and my son was
dispensable,'' she said.
	   Separately, members of the Orange Order, the Protestant
fraternal order, failed to strike a compromise with residents of a
Catholic neighborhood of Portadown who object to the Orangemen
marching through their area. Talks between the two sides broke up
early Sunday without agreement.
	   Jonathan Powell, a senior aide to Prime Minister Tony Blair,
oversaw the discussions in which the two sides communicated through
mediators but did not speak directly to each other. Similar talks
broke down after a few hours a week ago.
	   However, go-betweens reported ``some progress'' and said in a
statement, ``We will stay in close contact with the parties with
the aim of resuming talks when further progress can be made.''
	   Police and soliders, enforcing an order by the
government-appointed Parades Commission, prevented members of the
Orange Order from marching down the Garvaghy Road in Portadown, 25
miles (40 kms) southwest of Belfast, on July 5.
	   Orangemen massed on the hillside near a rural church every night
for a week, underlining their determination to follow their
traditional parade route. But the number of protesters fell after
arsonists killed the three young sons of a Catholic woman in the
town of Ballymoney last Sunday in what police said was a sectarian
attack.
	   Police still are questioning seven people in connection with
that attack.

Israel wants new court to reconsider occupied land a crime
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VITA BEKKER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A United Nations treaty creating a permanent
international criminal tribunal was rejected by Israel because it
would consider occupying land to be a punishable crime, officials
said Sunday.
	   Israel's foreign ministry said the Jewish state, founded on the
ashes of the Nazi Holocaust, was in a bind when it came to the
historic agreement.
	   ``As a people that suffered from the most terrible crime in
history, genocide, setting up of such a court has always been a
very important development as far as Israel is concerned,'' said
Alan Baker, a legal expert with the foreign ministry.
	   The treaty, signed and approved by more than 100 nations Friday
in Rome, lists the establishment of settlements on occupied land as
punishable along with genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes
and aggression.
	   Israel has annexed formerly Jordanian east Jerusalem and
occupied most of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, home to over two
million Palestinians, since capturing the areas from Jordan and
Egypt in the 1967 Mideast war. Successive governments have offered
incentives and encouraged citizens to move to the areas, now home
to some 150,000 Jewish settlers.
	   Baker said that signing the agreement would have put potentially
hundreds of thousands of Israelis at risk of prosecution.
	   ``Israel has no choice but to go against any such statute which
would render Israelis war criminals just for being active in
setting up or establishing settlements,'' Baker said at a news
conference Sunday.
	   Israel was one of several nations which backed away from signing
the treaty. The United States also refused to sign after failing to
secure an exemption for American citizens from the court's
authority.
	   Baker said that the occupied lands article was wrongly included
in the treaty and charged that Arab nations would use it to condemn
Israel at the United Nations assembly.
	   The treaty will be ratified once at least 60 countries, roughly
a third of the United Nations, approve it. The treaty is not
retroactive and will only apply to crimes occurring after its
ratification. Changes could be made in the treaty in the next seven
years, and Baker said plans to fight for the revision of the
wording of the crimes list.
	   ``We still believe in the idea and we hope that the
establishment of an international war crimes court...will not
become another political tool to be used against Israel,'' Baker
said.

Human rights group revived with European grant
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ The Independent Jamaica Council for
Human Rights, a lobbying organization that ran out of money and
closed in December 1996, has reopened with the help of a dlrs
250,000 (Jamaica dlrs 9 million) grant from the European Union.
	   The council led protests against Jamaica's death penalty, a
touchy topic as Britain and European rights groups pressure Jamaica
to stop hangings of murder convicts.
	   Supporters of the death penalty argued the group was ignoring
the rising murder rate in Jamaica. In 1997 there were a record
1,038 murders on this island of 2.6 million people.
	   Hilaire Sobers, the new executive director of the council, said
the group would begin new fund raising campaigns within 18 months.

Brazilian government fears alliance between cocaine traffickers and
</HEADLINE>
marijuana growers &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ A confidential government report
says international drug traffickers are forging new alliances with
marijuana farmers in northeastern Brazil to start growing plants
used in cocaine and heroin production, a newspaper reported Sunday.
	   The report, written by a military intelligence unit assigned to
President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, revealed that such alliances
already exist in the south and southeastern regions, said the
newspaper Folha de Sao Paulo.
	   The trafficker's latest target is the northeastern region known
as the ``marijuana polygon,'' located in Pernambuco, Brazil's main
marijuana-producing state.
	   The polygon, a region with 16 municipalities and 1.3 million
inhabitants, is ideal for marijuana growing because of its fertile
soil, dry and warm weather and ample irrigation from the nearby Rio
Sao Francisco.
	   It's also isolated and suffers from a shortage of law
enforcement officers. Only 26 of 68 area police stations have a
police chief, who typically heads criminal investigations, said the
newspaper.
	   ``There is such a lack of control that the area is just one step
away from growing coca and poppy plants,'' the report said.
	   The government report also blamed local officials for the surge
in marijuana growers, charging them with breaking pledges to aid
some 10,000 rural families who were removed from their farms in the
1980s to make way for a series of hydroelectric dams.
	   This year, Pernambuco police have reportedly destroyed 490 tons
of marijuana valued at dlrs 42 million. In the past, such raids
have met resistance from local mayors and politicians who argue
that leaving peasants without a steady income causes commerce to
fall sharply.
	   Most farmers earn an average dlrs 3.50 per day, while marijuana
growers earn dlrs 43 per day, local officials say.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Hundreds of Serb police battled
secessionist guerrillas for control of a central Kosovo town
Sunday, while refugees streamed into nearby hills to flee the
fighting.
	   Meanwhile, the Serb Media Center in Pristina, said that 20
ethnic Albanian rebel fighters were killed early Sunday when a few
hundred tried to cross the Albanian-Yugoslav border northwest of
Djakovica, the scene of an even bigger attempted incursion on
Saturday.
	   Both sides claimed they controlled most of the town of Orahovac,
about 50 kilometers (30 miles) southwest of Pristina, but
explosions and machine-gun fire echoed throughout surrounding hills
and several buildings burned intensely. Orahovac, with a normal
population of 20,000, is the largest town yet caught in the
five-month ethnic conflict.
	   Reporters on the scene said it wasn't clear if either force

	   The commander said his forces killed at least 30 Serb policemen
and captured almost all of Orahovac since the guerrillas launched
an offensive on Orahovac late Friday.
	   In a statement carried by Albania's state TV, the KLA called on
Albanians not to recognize the self-styled Kosovo parliament, which
convened earlier in the week and is dominated by the party of
Ibrahim Rugova, the moderate ethnic Albanian leader, and to join
the Kosovo Liberation Army instead.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Hundreds of Serb police battled
secessionist guerrillas for control of a central Kosovo town
Sunday, while refugees streamed into nearby hills to flee the
fighting.
	   The Serb Media Center in Pristina also said 20 ethnic Albanian
rebel fighters were killed early Sunday when a few hundred tried to
cross the Albanian-Yugoslav border northwest of Djakovica, the
scene of an even bigger attempted incursion on Saturday.
	   Both sides claimed they controlled most of the town of Orahovac,
about 50 kilometers (30 miles) southwest of Pristina, but
explosions and machine-gun fire echoed throughout the surrounding
hills and several buildings burned. Orahovac, with a normal
population of 20,000, is the largest town caught in the five-month
ethnic conflict so far.
	   Reporters on the scene said it wasn't clear if either force
controlled the town amid the house-to-house fighting and shelling
in one of the largest battles in the five-month conflict.
	   A few hours later, the Serb Media Center said in a press release
that the Serbian security forces had gained ``total control'' of
the center of Orahovac and were calling in telecommunication and
other workers to restore the town's infrastructure.
	   Witnesses said hundreds of refugees from nearby villages fled
the area in tractors and trailers as police and the ethnic Albanian
Kosovo Liberation Army deployed snipers and heavy weapons
throughout the wooded hills to battle for the third consecutive
day.
	   An ethnic Albanian guerrilla commander claimed earlier he was
using heavy weapons, including rocket launchers and vehicle-mounted
machine guns, to fight a siege by hundreds of police on Orahovac.
	   ``These steps were taken to change the quality of the war from
(fighting in) the countryside to urban areas,'' said the local KLA
commander in an interview with Associated Press Television. ``This
is the beginning of this type of war which will end up in
Pristina.''
	   Reporters with the guerrillas could see anti-aircraft guns,
heavy machine-guns and small arms.
	   The commander claimed 200 Serb policemen were in the Orahovac
police station, cut off from hundreds of reinforcements trying to
reach the area.
	   The commander said his forces killed at least 30 Serb policemen
and captured almost all of Orahovac since the guerrillas launched
an offensive on Orahovac late Friday.
	   The Kosovo Information Center said two civilians were killed and
four were wounded in the Orahovac area.
	   In a grenade attack on two other villages east of Orahovac, a
12-year-old girl and another teenager were killed, the center said
without providing other details.
	   The guerrilla offensive on Orahovac appeared aimed at expanding
the estimated 30 percent of the Serbian province they hold.
	   In a statement carried by Albania's state TV, the KLA further
established its independence by calling on Albanians not to
recognize the self-styled Kosovo parliament, which convened earlier
in the week and is dominated by the party of Ibrahim Rugova, the
moderate ethnic Albanian leader, and to join the Kosovo Liberation
Army instead.

Moroccan star fails in world 2,000-meter record bid
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GATESHEAD, England (AP) _ Six days after breaking the world
1,500 meter mark, Hachim El Guerrouj failed in a bid to become the
fastest ever over 2,000 meters Sunday when he clocked 4 minutes
48.35 seconds, .47 off the record.
	   The 23-year-old Moroccan was left to run the last 600 meters on
his own after Kenyan pacemakers Sammy Langat and William Tanui
dropped out after keeping him inside world record pace.
	   In windy conditions on a rainsoaked track at Gateshead, El
Guerrouj grimaced as he hit the final stretch and, although there
was no one else in sight in the finish straight, he was just short
of the record of 4:47.88, owned by his great Algerian rival,
Noureddine Morceli.
	   El Guerrouj beat Morceli's 1,500 meter mark in Rome on Tuesday
and, two days later in Nice, was only a fifth of a second away from
the Algerian's world mile record.

Princes William, Harry preparing 50th birthday play for their

 &UR; Eds: Updates with newspaper's regrets, last two grafs, edits to
trim elsewhere &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Prince William and Prince Harry have been
preparing a surprise 50th birthday party for their father, Prince
Charles, but are ``very disappointed'' that the news has surfaced
in a tabloid newspaper, a spokeswoman for Charles said Sunday.
	   She declined to confirm a Sunday Mirror report that the event
would be held at Charles' country home, Highgrove, on July 31, and
that the young princes would star in a specially written comedy
play.
	   The Sunday Mirror said William, 16, and Harry, 13, would appear
with Oscar-winning actress Emma Thompson and comedy actor Stephen
Fry, who have written the script. Although Prince Charles doesn't
turn 50 until Nov. 14, the play has to be given early to fit into
school and work schedules, it said.
	   ``William and Harry have planned a surprise birthday for their
father, and they have worked really hard on it,'' said Prince
Charles' spokeswoman, with customary anonymity. ``It is sad that
the surprise has now been spoiled.
	   ``The party will go ahead, though it isn't going to be a
surprise any more. I am not going to talk about the details because
it isn't fair to the boys. They are very disappointed that it has
got out after they kept it a secret for so long.''
	   The Sunday Mirror said William conceived the idea of a play in
the style of the comedy series ``Blackadder,'' and his former nanny
Tiggy Legge-Bourke helped him organize it, the Sunday Mirror said.
	   ``In view of the obvious secret nature of a party being planned
by two children as a surprise for their father, the Prince of Wales
is sad that the newspaper involved didn't handle the information it
received with greater common sense and courtesy,'' his spokeswoman
said.
	   The Sunday Mirror, which put the story on page one and covered
two inside pages with it, later said it regretted the boys were
upset. But it laid the blame on the unidentified source of the
information leak.
	   ``The Sunday Mirror regrets that Princes William and Harry are
upset that news concerning the play was leaked,'' the newspaper's
statement said.

O'Meara wins British Open in playoff
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; URGENT &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Sunday play. CHANGES byline.
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SOUTHPORT, England (AP) _ Mark O'Meara won the British Open on
Sunday in a playoff against Brian Watts just three months after
winning the Masters.
	   O'Meara, who started the day two shots off the lead, won by two
strokes in the four-hole playoff at Royal Birkdale.
	   He used a birdie on the first playoff hole, No. 15, and held on
as Watts hit into the rough several times and then hit into a
greenside bunker on No. 18.
	   O'Meara is the fourth consecutive American to win the Open,
following Justin Leonard, Tom Lehman and John Daly.
	   Tiger Woods, who entered the day five shots behind leader Watts,
made a late charge with birdies on three of the last four holes,
including a 30-foot chip-in on No. 17 and a 30-foot putt on No. 18.
	   He shot a 66 for the final round and finished in second at
1-over 281, a shot behind O'Meara and Watts.
	   O'Meara and Watts' 280 for the four rounds was the first time
even-par has been good enough to claim the British Open since Greg
Norman in 1986.
	   Four players were tied for third at 2-over 282: Jim Furyk,
Raymond Russell, Jesper Parnevik and 17-year-old English amateur
Justin Rose, who finished the day with an incredible 45-yard
(41-meter) chip-in.
	   O'Meara shot a 2-under 68 in regulation and sat watching on the
fringe of the 18th green as Watts needed to par to force the
playoff.
	   Watts, an Oklahoman who plays on the Japanese tour, was in deep
trouble after hitting his second shot into a greenside bunker. But
in one of the greatest shots ever in the Open, he chipped from
about 60 yards to within 6 inches to save par and force the
playoff.
	   O'Meara is the first player to win two of golf's majors in the
same season since Nick Price in 1994.

Firefighters' helicopter crashes killing two as forest fires

<TEXT>
	   BARCELONA, Spain (AP) _ A helicopter crashed Sunday in
northeastern Spain killing the pilot and only passenger who were on
a firefighting mission amid rising concern about rapidly spreading
forest fires in the area, authorities said.
	   Reports that the helicopter crashed because it hit a high
tension cable could not be confirmed.
	   Unusually high temperatures in the last few days have hindered
attempts to control the fires that have so far destroyed about
1,000 hectares of forest in the region of Catalonia, a spokeswoman
at the firefighters' headquarters in the area said.
	   With weather forecasters predicting that Monday's temperatures
will be at least equal to Sunday's 38C (100F), the region's
firefighters are seeking support from sister services in Madrid and
over the border in France, the spokeswoman said.
	   Several isolated rural residences have been evacuated, she said.

Mubarak urges US to publish its Mideast peace proposals
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The United States should publish its
proposals for an Israeli-Palestinian accord or risk losing its
credibility in the Middle East, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
said Sunday.
	   ``Perhaps its special relationship with Israel prevents the
United States from doing this, but (keeping the proposals secret)
will produce a negative reaction from the masses and it's not right
to ignore public opinion,'' Mubarak said in an interview with
Egypt's official Middle East News Agency.
	   The president spoke shortly before Israeli and Palestinian
officials held talks on the U.S. proposals, whose main feature is
that Israel should withdraw its troops from a further 13.1 percent
of the West Bank.
	   The other elements of the U.S. package have not been released
because of a reluctance to press Israel publicly to accept terms to
which members of the Israeli coalition government are opposed.
	   In his strongest comments to date on the confidentiality of the
proposals, Mubarak said: ``This (secrecy) ... puts the whole matter
into question. Public opinion asks, `Where is America?'.''
	   ``That's why I think that the United States should disclose its
initiative,'' he added.
	   The Israeli-Palestinian talks Sunday were the first high-level
meeting between the two sides for months. They were held at the
instance of the United States, which has long grappled with the
stalemate.
	   The Palestinians have accepted the 13.1 percent proposal, but
the Israelis have rejected it, saying it would compromise their
security.

World Youth Games end with host victory in soccer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The World Youth Games ended Sunday with a
crowd-pleasing victory by Russia's youth soccer team, and Mayor
Yuri Luzhkov said Moscow is ready to host the next youth games _ as
well as the 2012 Olympics.
	   The Russian soccer squad defeated Turkey 1-0 at a packed
Luzhniki Stadium. The match _ one of the few events in the weeklong
games that attracted a crowd _ was followed by brief closing
ceremonies capped by fireworks.
	   In other finals Sunday, the United States defeated Russia in
basketball, 78-72, and Brazil took the volleyball crown, defeating
Ukraine 3-0.
	   The games, which were staged like a junior Olympics, were aimed
at showing the International Olympic Committee that Moscow was
ready to handle the real thing in 2012.
	   They appeared to run smoothly, although Luzhkov was criticized
for heavy-handed security and for failing to make tickets available
to the public.
	   At a news conference Sunday, Luzhkov said Moscow would be
willing to host the games again in four years, although he said it
would be better to hold them the year before the Olympics, which
will next be held in 2000.
	   As it was, the youth games were sandwiched between the World Cup
and Goodwill Games, and also competed with other youth sports
events around the world.
	   Luzhkov noted that he has sent a letter to the IOC voicing
Moscow's readiness to host the Olympics in 2012. The city has not
yet made an official bid for the games.
	   Moscow's previous stint as an Olympic host, in 1980, was marred
by an international boycott. Many facilities remain, however, some
of which were spruced up for the World Youth Games.

<TEXT>
	   BARCELONA, Spain (AP) _ A helicopter crashed Sunday in
northeastern Spain killing the pilot and only passenger who were on
a firefighting mission amid rising concern about rapidly spreading
forest fires in the area, authorities said.
	   The helicopter crashed after hitting a high tension cable on its
way to investigate reports of a new blaze, Xavier Pomes from the
Catalonia regional authority said on national Spanish television.
	   Unusually high temperatures in the last few days have hindered
attempts to control the fires that have so far destroyed about
1,000 hectares (2,500 acres) of forest in the region of Catalonia,
a spokeswoman at the firefighters' headquarters in the area said.
	   With weather forecasters predicting that Monday's temperatures
will be at least equal to Sunday's 38C (100F), the region's
firefighters are seeking support from sister services in Madrid and
over the border in France, the spokeswoman said.
	   Several isolated rural residences have been evacuated, she said.

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) - Jean-Paul Gaultier showed his winter haute couture
Sunday in an elegant mansion in a truly splendid moment for this
innovative designer who knows all about fashion, from the dregs _
which he has shown _ to the heights.
	   The audience gave him a big cheer as his bride and groom came
out in dressy cream outfits fashioned on Norwegian sweaters, after
feather-and-fur displays that were both fun and often wearable.
	   Gaultier's couture and color sense were admirable, from the silk
crepe sun-pleated long tunic dress, to the bright blouson of cassis
leather adorned with rooster feathers over a trumpet shaped
georgette khaki skirt.
	   There were superb bomber jackets or blousons, such as a bright
coppery red elaborately accordion-pleated one. Or a sun-pleated
black and white tweed blouson with charcoal straight pants, a
sequined tank top.
	   No trouble keeping warm, as fur by Saga-Scandinavia was very big
throughout - many fox stoles, gold fox sleeves on a beautiful
charcoal trouser suit. And then for fun and warmth - a whole
classic pin-striped suit made of graded brownish sheared mink.
	   Some outfits were so original, yet Parisian - like the splendid
grand gold-lined tuxedo opera coat over its black micro-mini for
dancing.
	   Gaultier had some of his famed corselet looks, but the fireworks
were definitely in the explosion of graded fire-shaded bird of
paradise feathers like elegant feather duster sleeves on the pine
chiffon tank top and aubergine skirt.
	   For Givenchy, Alexander McQueen took his audience at the Cirque
d'Hiver (Winter Circus) on a quirky Amazonian trip with exotic
birds cawing, real model-birds parading, jungle drums from the rain
forest pounding relentlessly.
	   First arrived a kind of Godiva-amazon clothed in flowers and
tulle over her nearly-nude back under chiffon, on an elegant
stallion with rider to get the creature into a deep bow.
	   Then there were some splendid shiny, fitted trouser suits with
top hats, high heels, plenty of finery like lace blouses showing.
	   To the tom-tom rhythms came on a huge feather headdress over a
slinky embroidered almond crepe draped siren - plus another peacock
draped gown with an off-shoulder effect.
	   Then came the cute savages in their hipster pants, or their
clothing of leafy shawls, low hipsters or minis with navels
showing. There was an occasional civilized look at lace.
	   Details there were, and quite good tailoring cuts, as usual. But
so much fabric shininess - with all the laces and rhinestones -
that the circus-like look at the rainforest turned out more like a
travelogue for Tarzan's Jane who'd like to dress like the colonists
than a fashion show for serious fashion-watchers.
	   But spectacle is the buzz-word these days, and McQueen usually
turns it out in spades for Givenchy.
	   Christophe Rouxel's couture debut at an old left-bank Gothic
convent building was on the shaky side.
	   The clothes were soothing, with wispy little flared silk-chiffon
minis in colors like cyclamen or silvery gray. Some excellent
indigo gowns in satin and chiffon for evening hit a good note for
right now, though there were also modern fabrics with wiry silver
embroidery, to enhance the romantic gowns for this young couturier,
still in his early thirties.
	   Valentino's Sunday show at his Place Vendome shop was packed
with aristocracy and gorgeous clothes to please them.
	   ``Coats, coats, coats! I loved them all,'' said Victoria
Brynner, daughter of actor Yul Brynner.
	   Not only were there coats galore, in the most beautiful cashmere
and tweed mixes in three-quarter lengths with shortie sleeves and
mink trim.
	   This was super-refined Valentino, not too much icing on the
cake. The white cashmere coats and suits with abbreviated jackets,
skirts just below the knee would look good in any top restaurant.
	   Crocheted-effect knit dresses or fitted suits with satin coats,
faille cocktail dresses with streaky or new-moon patterns in gold
and silver were lean but never mean.
	   Embroidered chiffon dresses drifted by with lightly embroidered
gold flowers, evansescent under a gold lace coat, all just
caressing the body.
	   Gold and silver spidery weaves were all over the light chiffon,
satin velvet and and georgette clothes, sophisticated without being
glitzy. Tempting and tantalizing, the intricate sheathes with
icicle spangles could never be knocked off - only dedicated couture
workers could achieve this.

O'Meara wins British Open in playoff

<TEXT>
	   SOUTHPORT, England (AP) _ Mark O'Meara won the British Open on
Sunday in a playoff against Brian Watts just three months after
winning the Masters.
	   O'Meara, who started the day two shots off the lead, won by two
strokes in the four-hole playoff at Royal Birkdale.
	   He used a birdie on the first playoff hole, No. 15, and held on
as Watts hit into the rough several times and then hit into a
greenside bunker on No. 18.
	   O'Meara is the fourth consecutive American to win the Open,
following Justin Leonard, Tom Lehman and John Daly.
	   Tiger Woods, who entered the day five shots behind leader Watts,
made a late charge with birdies on three of the last four holes,
including a 30-foot (9-meter) chip-in on No. 17 and a 30-foot
(9-meter) putt on No. 18.
	   He shot a 66 for the final round and finished in third at 1-over
281, a shot behind O'Meara and Watts.
	   O'Meara and Watts' 280 for the four rounds was the first time
even-par has been good enough to claim the British Open since Greg
Norman in 1986.
	   Four players were tied for fourth at 2-over 282: Jim Furyk,
Raymond Russell, Jesper Parnevik and 17-year-old English amateur
Justin Rose, who finished the day with an incredible 45-yard
(41-meter) chip-in.
	   O'Meara shot a 2-under 68 in regulation and sat watching on the
fringe of the 18th green as Watts needed to par to force the
playoff.
	   Watts, an Oklahoman who plays on the Japanese tour, was in deep
trouble after hitting his second shot into a greenside bunker. But
in one of the greatest shots ever in the Open, he chipped from
about 60 yards (55 meters) to within 6 inches (15 centimeters) to
save par and force the playoff.
	   O'Meara is the first player to win two of golf's majors in the
same season since Nick Price in 1994.

Car bomb in southern Sweden injures driver
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ A bomb in a car blew off the roof and
severely in jured the driver Sunday, the national news agency TT
reported.
	   The incident, unusually violent for Sweden, occurred in the
southern city Malmo, the country's third largest.
	   The 32-year-old victim's identity was not disclosed in keeping
with police procedures. He apparently had been threatened and
assaulted earlier by members of a motorcycle gang, said police, who
reportedly found traces of explosives in the car.
	   The man was taken to hospital with burns and injuries that were
described as severe but not life-threatening.

Russian negotiator: Odds are strong for approval of IMF loan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's chief negotiator with international
lenders said Sunday he expected the International Monetary Fund to
approve a package of dlrs 17 billion in new loans, but that a balky
parliament might threaten the bailout.
	   Speaking on the weekly television program ``Itogi,'' Anatoly
Chubais said he thought the chances that the loan package would be
approved by the IMF board of directors was ``80 to 20.'' The board
was scheduled to meet Monday in Washington.
	   If it doesn't approve the loans, Chubais said blame would fall
on the Russian parliament, which recessed last week after failing
to approve several elements of a government economic plan that the
IMF had set as a prerequisite to the loan.
	   The government has said it would pass the rest of the plan by
decree. On Sunday, President Boris Yeltsin signed a land tax
measure doubling the tax on certain non-agricultural property.
	   Chubais said the IMF had said in negotiations that Russia ``will
only be trusted when the government, the State Duma, the Federation
Council and the president have similar positions on the key
issues.''
	   The State Duma and Federation Council are the two houses of
parliament.

Gunfight revives fears of Freetown residents
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) _ West African peacekeepers and
Sierra Leone rebel fighters waged a fierce one-hour gunbattle
Sunday in Freetown, prompting fears of renewed fighting in the
battered capital.
	   There were no known casualties in the fighting between soldiers
of the Nigerian-led West African intervention force and renegade
members of Sierra Leone's ousted military government.
	   The West African force, known as ECOMOG, played down the
fighting, saying it was an ``isolated incident'' involving a
contingent of peacekeepers and 15 armed rebels suspected of
carrying out a spate of recent armed robberies.
	   All of the rebels had been captured and were being
``vigorously'' interrogated, ECOMOG commander Lt. Gabriel Oheime
told reporters.
	   The rebels had allegedly hidden by day in dense bush surrounding
the city, while robbing civilian and businesses by night, Oheime
added.
	   When the gunfire began in the Malama suburb, residents ran for
cover, fearing battles similar to those that blazed throughout the
city for several weeks in February before the peacekeepers ousted
the junta forces.
	   Since President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah's elected government returned
to power from more than 10 months in exile, peace has returned to
the capital. But the rebels continue to terrorize villages in the
countryside.
	   Kabbah had been forced to flee the country in a bloody coup in
May 1997 launched by forces loyal to Lt. Col. Johnny Paul Koroma.
	   The rebels continue to control parts of the diamond-rich Kono
district in the northern region of this impoverished West African
country despite ECOMOG patrols through the country.
	   Koroma's whereabouts are unknown.

	   AITAPE, Papua New Guinea (AP) _ The wave higher than the coconut
trees it crashed into swept away three villages on Papua New
Guinea's northwest coast, turning flimsily built homes into
matchsticks. The death toll by Sunday was at least 599, but could
rise to more than 1,000.
	   Across the Sissano lagoon Sunday, the beaches where a number of
villages used to be built were washed away, and the lagoon was
filled with debris, coconut palms and the remains of houses.
	   The 23-foot (7-meter) wall of water known as a tsunami hit the
southwest Pacific island nation without warning late Friday
following a magnitude-7 earthquake about 18 miles (30 kilometers)
off the coast.
	   The village of Arop was demolished, said resident Lusien Romme,
whose wife was killed and his home destroyed.
	   ``There was nothing left except for coconut trees,'' Romme, who
broke two fingers and injured his ribs and shoulder, told
Australian Associated Press by telephone Sunday from his bed at
Aitape's Raihu Health Center.
	   Romme said he saw ``the sea rising up and coming toward me''
before he was hurled into a coconut tree and then into the Sissano
lagoon.
	   Fisherman Jerry Apuan said Sunday that he couldn't even count
the number of bodies floating near one of the devastated villages.
	   ``There were so many bodies together I had to move the boat
slowly to pass through them,'' he said. ``I was afraid. It was the
first time I had seen so many bodies.''
	   Scores of children were among the dead. Hundreds of people were
injured and were awaiting urgent medical help, while others were
believed to have fled to higher ground in the interior. An
estimated 6,000 people were left homeless.
	   ``We heard a large bang, then saw the sea rising up. We had no
choice but to run for our lives,'' Paul Saroya, a resident of Nimas
village, told Australian Broadcasting Corp. television.
	   Papua New Guinea, with a population of 4 million, occupies the
eastern half of the island of New Guinea. It has a mountainous,
jungle-filled interior that has only been explored in the past 20
to 30 years, along with lush tropical beaches on the coastal
plains. The capital, Port Moresby, is about 375 miles (600
kilometers) east of Australia.
	   The tsunami struck west of the town of Aitape in West Sepik
province, hitting villages about 370 miles (595 kilometers)
northwest of Port Moresby.
	   District disaster coordinating chairman Dickson Dalle said the
Nimas village near the Sissano lagoon, the Warapu village and the
Arop village were wiped out and the Malol village suffered severe
damage.
	   Dalle said the latest death toll was 599, including 500 people
confirmed dead at Warapu. But he said the figure could increase as
more bodies were found, and it was impossible to say how many were
missing.
	   ``There are still people out there who are injured that we have
not rescued,'' he said. ``They're scattered all over in the
mangroves.''
	   Dalle said most of the victims were old people and
schoolchildren.
	   ``Schools in Arop, Sissano and Warapu will be closed because we
don't have the children,'' Dalle said. ``They're all dead.''
	   Australian aid officials in Papua New Guinea estimated the death
toll would climb to more than 1,000, with many thousands injured,
Australian Defense Minister Ian McLachlan said.
	   Prime Minister Bill Skate inspected part of the stricken area
Sunday.
	   The area is a jungle, swamp area that includes tribes that rely
on subsistance farming and fishing. Most live in homes made of
jungle materials and built on beaches. The population in the area
affected was 8,000 to 10,000 people, said Robert Igara, the
government's chief secretary.
	   Three Australian Defense Forces Hercules C-130 transport planes
left Australia on Sunday with equipment to set up a field hospital.
The equipment includes a mini-surgery theater, water treatment and
insect sprays to avoid potential disease outbreaks.
	   In Rome, Pope John Paul II, who has visited Papua New Guinea
twice during his papacy, dedicated his Sunday morning prayers to
the victims. A spokesman said the pope as ``very concerned'' and
asked to be kept informed.

Yuri Luzhkov said Moscow is ready to host the next youth games _ as
well as the 2012 Olympics.
	   The Russian soccer squad defeated Turkey 1-0 before a crowd of
nearly 80,000 at Luzhniki Stadium. The match _ one of the few
events in the weeklong games that drew a large crowd _ was followed
by brief closing ceremonies capped by fireworks.
	   In other finals Sunday, the United States defeated Russia in
basketball, 78-72, and Brazil took the volleyball crown, defeating
Ukraine 3-0.
	   The games, which were staged like a junior Olympics and featured
teams from 131 countries, were aimed at showing the International
Olympic Committee that Moscow was ready to handle the real thing in
2012.
	   They appeared to run smoothly, although Luzhkov was criticized
for heavy-handed security and for failing to make tickets available
to the public.
	   At the closing ceremonies, Russian Olympic Committee President
Vitaly Smirnov read a message from IOC President Juan Antonio
Samaranch, who visited the games earlier in the week. Samaranch
praised the games for promoting the Olympic spirit.
	   At a news conference Sunday, Luzhkov said Moscow would be
willing to host the games again in four years, although he said it
would be better to hold them the year before the Olympics, which
will next be held in 2000.
	   As it was, the youth games were sandwiched between the World Cup
and Goodwill Games, and also competed with other youth sports
events around the world.
	   Luzhkov noted that he has sent a letter to the IOC voicing
Moscow's readiness to host the Olympics in 2012. The city has not
yet made an official bid for the games.
	   Moscow's previous stint as an Olympic host, in 1980, was marred
by an international boycott. Many facilities remain, however, some
of which were spruced up for the World Youth Games.

Amid high tensions, Israel and Palestinians hold talks

	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ After months of stalemate, Israeli and
Palestinian officials signaled they had made some progress after
holding their first round of high level talks brokered by the
United States aimed at ending a 16-month impasse.
	   ``We have discussed all the outstanding issues, dealt with them
from all their aspects and we will follow up in order to hear more
ideas, hoping that such an endeavor will lead to a bridging of the
sides,'' Mahmoud Abbas, deputy to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat,
said at the conclusion of three and a half hours of talks primarily
with Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai.
	   Mordechai said the two delegations had agree to set-up ``small
teams,'' to discuss the issues which stand in the way of a long
overdue Israeli troop withdrawal from West Bank land.
	   Just hours before the talks began in Tel Aviv, police in
Jerusalem said they had foiled an attempted car bombing in the
city.
	   A Palestinian man described by police as a known Hamas activist
was arrested in the failed attack, in which he suffered serious
burns. No one else was hurt.
	   Beforehand, Palestinian negotiators signaled low expectations.
Palestinian Cabinet minister Nabil Shaath said he thought the
meeting had only a ``very, very limited chance'' of success.
	   ``But for a chance of one percent we will go, because we don't
want to be told that we have wasted an opportunity,'' Shaath, the
planning minister, told reporters in the West Bank town of
Ramallah.
	   But afterwards, some negotiators sounded slightly more upbeat.
	   Mohammed Dahlan, head of Palestinian security said that while no
breakthrough had been reached, the sides agreed to keep talking and
would meet again Monday.
	   Sunday's talks came at the urging of the United States, which
called on Israel and the Palestinians to negotiate directly to
resolve differences over a U.S. initiative calling for Israel to
withdraw from another 13 percent of the West Bank.
	   Israel has balked, citing security concerns _ concerns that
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said were underscored by Sunday's
attempted attack in the center of Jerusalem.
	   Dahlan said the Israeli team had refused to discuss the U.S.
plan. ``Whenever the Palestinians brought up the U.S. initiative,
the Israelis would say `not yet,''' Dahlan told the Associated
Press.
	   Netanyahu said Israel was coming to the talks with ``an open
mind and a desire to achieve an agreement.''
	   ``I call on the Palestinian Authority to engage with us
continually, day and night, in negotiations, including at the
highest levels,'' he said. The prime minister told reporters he did
not rule out a meeting later with Arafat.
	   Earlier in the day, Netanyahu separately told his Cabinet and
visiting Jordanian Foreign Minister Jawad Anani that he was
determined to reach an agreement with the Palestinians, and soon.
	   The meeting seemed to started off well with Mordechai and Abbas
shaking hands in front of cameras and then moving into a round of
one-on-one talks before bringing in aides.
	   ``We decided in the coming days to concentrate on the main
issues, and to look for solutions to bridge the gaps with the idea
of moving forward the agreements between the sides.''
	   Negotiators had feared that Sunday's attempted attack could hurt
the talks. Police spokesman Shmuel Ben-Ruby said the bombing was
thwarted when an off-duty Jerusalem policeman and a bus driver saw
smoke coming from a white van with front and back license plates
that did not match.
	   They smashed its windows, pulled out the burned driver and
called for help. Anti-terrorist police quickly arrived and
determined it was a car bomb, said Jerusalem police chief Yair
Yitzhaki. IT was not clear what caused the fire inside the van.
	   Police described the van's contents as 600 liters (160 gallons)
of ``flammable fluid'' in plastic containers. Yitzhaki said the
material was capable of causing considerable damage and casualties.
Also found were several kilograms (pounds) of nails, Israel radio
reported. In the past, militants have rigged bombs with nails to
increase the devastation caused by the explosion.
	   ``A terrible tragedy was averted,'' he told reporters.
	   Israel TV said its station had received an anonymous call
Saturday warning of a planned attack in the city's downtown area
and had passed on the information to police.
	   Police said the driver _ who had been previously jailed for
being a member of a ``hostile organization'' _ was hospitalized
under heavy police guard with serious burns. Israel radio said his
brother was arrested Sunday evening.
	   Members of the man's family, who live in the Al-Amari refugee
camp outside the West Bank town of Ramallah, said they knew nothing
of his activities on Sunday.
	   Jerusalem police remained on high alert in the wake of the
failed attack, said spokeswoman Linda Menuhin, and authorities
appealed for public vigilance.
	   ``I ask Jerusalemites to be on alert _ it's critical,'' the
police chief said.
	   While the bomb squad worked, a half-mile (kilometer) of
Jerusalem's main downtown thoroughfare and part of a downtown
pedestrian mall were closed for three hours.
	   Traffic backed up, large crowds milled behind the police
barricades, and scores of stores and restaurants were closed.
Sunday is a regular business day in Israel.
	   Army radio said Palestinian security forces were cooperating in
the investigation.
	   The attempted attack came almost a year after a pair of suicide
bombings in downtown Jerusalem that killed 25 people, including the
five bombers.

Sri Lankan, 2 Iranians executed for crimes in Kuwait
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ Two Iranian men were hanged in Kuwait on Sunday,
the first executions ever for drug smuggling in this small Gulf
state, a Kuwaiti official said.
	   A third man, a Sri Lankan identified as Yassin Bawa
Abdul-Ghafour, was executed for murdering his lover, said the
Interior Ministry official, who spoke on customary condition of
anonymity.
	   The hangings were carried out at the Central Prison, the
official said.
	   He identified the Iranians as Abbas Bouriaimi and Hanash
Salmeen. The two were arrested in 1996 on a boat with 58 kilograms
(128 pounds) of hashish, 849 grams (30 ounces) of opium and about
one kilogram (2 pounds) of heroin.
	   They were found guilty of smuggling drugs under a law amended by
Parliament in 1995 to introduce capital punishment for drug
trafficking. The law aims to curb rising drug abuse.
	   Abdul-Ghafour was found guilty of murdering his Sri Lankan lover
in 1996 by smashing her head with a rock in the desert.
	   In May, three Kuwaiti men convicted of murder, robbery and
kidnapping were hanged.

Spain claims 37 medals at Ibero-American Games
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Spain dominated the medals table at the
end of the three-day VIII Ibero-American athletics meeting Sunday,
totaling 37 medals. The Spanish team boasted 16 gold medals,
followed by Mexico with seven and the Portuguese host-team with
five.
	   In Sunday's relay finals, the Spanish women's 4x100-meter team
crossed the finishing line first with 44.54 seconds. Portugal
finished 0.19 seconds later, the Colombian team abandoned the race,
and the Brazilians failed to present themselves at the starting
line.
	   But the Brazilians were more than present in the men's
4x100-meter, claiming gold with 39.82 seconds, ahead of the
Mexico's 40.49 seconds.
	   Mexico cleaned up in the 4x400-meter relay, winning the men's
event with 3 minutes, 06.12 seconds and the women's with 3 minutes,
33.41 seconds.
	   In individual events, Brazilian Araujo Eronildes claimed gold in
the 400-meter hurdles, breaking the Ibero-American record by 0.26
seconds, with 48.96 seconds.
	   Fellow countryman Flavio Godoy also passed the finishing line
first in the men's 800 meters clocking 1 minute, 50.05 seconds,
while Spaniard Ana Menendez took the women's 800 meters in 2
minutes, 01.32 seconds.
	   Fighting it out for gold in the 3,000-meter steeple, Spain's
Luis Martin edged Portugal's Vitor Almeida into second to win with
8 minutes, 28.96 seconds.
	   Portuguese Antonio Pinto faired better for the home crowd in the
5,000 meters, claiming goal with 13 minutes, 34.34 seconds, ahead
of Pablo Olmedo of Mexico.
	   Other winners Sunday included Brazil's Elisangela Adriano in the
women's shotput with 18.38 meters; Cuban Isbet Macer in the men's
javelin with 78.72 meters; Mexican Ivan Salcedo in the men's triple
jump with 16.36 meters; and Spaniard Ignacio Perez in the men's
high jump with 2.20 meters.
	   Twenty three 23 countries officially took part in the three-day
meeting held at Lisbon's University Stadium.

Tsunami waves can tower, and crash with deadly result
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Papua New Guinea-Tsunami &QL; 
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   A tsunami is a series of sea waves caused by underwater
earthquakes, landslides or volcanos. Sometimes referred to as
``great sea waves,'' a tsunami can travel at speeds up to 450 mph
(725 kph) and waves range in height from a harmless few inches
(centimeters) to 100 feet (30 meters).
	   A magnitude-7 quake generated the deadly and destructive
23-foot-high (7-meter) wave that swamped Papua New Guinea's
northern coast Friday.
	   The worst tsunami on record followed the Aug. 27, 1883, eruption
of Krakatau volcano in the East Indies. Its 100-foot (30-meter)
waves killed more than 36,000 people on the coasts of Java and
Sumatra.
	   On April 1, 1946, an earthquake in the Aleutian Islands sent a
wave ashore on Unimak Island, Alaska, that killed five. Hours
later, it reached Hawaii, where it killed 159 people.
	   More recently, a July 12, 1993, quake under the Sea of Japan
spawned waves up to 100 feet (30 meters). About 200 people died.
	   Tsunami can occur anywhere, but are most common in the Pacific
Ocean. Use of the Japanese name for the waves reflects the fact
that Japan has been the most affected country, with more than
100,000 deaths recorded in about 250 tsunamis over the centuries.

	   UNIONDALE, New York (AP) _ Michael Johnson is 1-for-3 in recent
meets, a downright slump for a runner used to winning.
	   Still, Johnson says he's in good shape as he prepares to run the
400 meters at the Goodwill Games and has his eyes on drastically
lowering the world record.
	   ``My injuries are behind me,'' Johnson said Sunday. ``I feel
confident that when I get caught up condition-wise that I can get
back into the 43-second range. And in the next couple of years, I
think I can run 42 seconds.''
	   Johnson, who has chased Butch Reynolds' decade-old world mark of
43.29 for years, said he was confident of being ranked No. 1 in the
world at 400 meters for the sixth consecutive year and eighth
overall.
	   He said injuries to his hamstrings and Achilles' tendons had
contributed to losses in two of his three most recent outings. But,
while Johnson said his hips had not given him any trouble, his
coach said that was where the Olympic star's problem started.
	   Clyde Hart said improper alignment, the result of Johnson's left
leg being shorter than his right, affected the hamstrings.
	   ``When the hips are out of line, everything else is out,'' Hart
said.
	   The injuries forced Johnson to miss about two weeks of training
during a recent six-week period. Hart said the hip problem began at
the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta.
	   ``Between the semifinals and the final (in the 200 meters), we
had to get a hip adjustment,'' Hart said. ``The last two or three
meters of the final, they also got out of line.''
	   Despite the pain, Johnson lowered the world record to 19.32,
completing the first 200-400 gold-medal sweep by a man in Olympic
history.
	   Last year, Johnson injured his right quadriceps in a 150-meter
match race against Canada's Donovan Bailey. Two months later, he
ran a gutsy race in winning the 400 title at the world
championships in Athens, Greece.
	   ``His (left) leg was swinging out,'' Hart said. ``It was
unbelievable. We found out when we came back to the States that the
leg had about one-third less strength and one-third less reaction
time. It was like running on a flat tire.''
	   An ailing Johnson could not run faster than a wind-aided 20.28
in the 200, finishing third at the Prefontaine Classic at Eugene,
Ore., on May 31. His next race wasn't until July 9 at Oslo, Norway,
where he again finished third in the 400 in 44.58, far off his best
of 43.39. It was only his second loss in the 400 during the 1990s.
	   ``After the race, he was very sick, which was not usual for him,
but I told him it would be like daylight and dark between here
(Oslo) and Rome,'' Hart said.
	   Finally feeling better last Tuesday at Rome, Johnson won the 400
in 44.40, his fastest time of the year.
	   ``At Rome, he controlled the race,'' Hart said. ``He looked
vintage Michael Johnson before the injury.''
	   Johnson also realized his improvement.
	   ``I don't think I will be having any more problems this year,''
he said. ``I feel better about my training than I did a couple of
months ago.''

Amid high tensions, Israel and Palestinians hold talks

	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ After months of stalemate, Israeli and
Palestinian officials signaled they had made some progress after
holding their first round of high level talks brokered by the
United States aimed at ending a 16-month impasse.
	   ``We have discussed all the outstanding issues, dealt with them
from all their aspects and we will follow up in order to hear more
ideas, hoping that such an endeavor will lead to a bridging of the
sides,'' Mahmoud Abbas, deputy to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat,
said at the conclusion of three and a half hours of talks primarily
with Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai.
	   Mordechai said the two delegations had agree to set-up ``small
teams,'' to discuss the issues which stand in the way of a long
overdue Israeli troop withdrawal from West Bank land.
	   Just hours before the talks began in Tel Aviv, police in
Jerusalem said they had foiled an attempted car bombing in the
city.
	   A Palestinian man described by police as a known Hamas activist
was arrested in the failed attack, in which he suffered serious
burns. No one else was hurt.
	   Beforehand, Palestinian negotiators signaled low expectations.
Palestinian Cabinet minister Nabil Shaath said he thought the
meeting had only a ``very, very limited chance'' of success.
	   ``But for a chance of one percent we will go, because we don't
want to be told that we have wasted an opportunity,'' Shaath, the
planning minister, told reporters in the West Bank town of
Ramallah.
	   But afterwards, some negotiators sounded slightly more upbeat.
	   Mohammed Dahlan, head of Palestinian security said that while no
breakthrough had been reached, the sides agreed to keep talking and
would meet again Monday.
	   Sunday's talks came at the urging of the United States, which
called on Israel and the Palestinians to negotiate directly to
resolve differences over a U.S. initiative calling for Israel to
withdraw from another 13 percent of the West Bank.
	   Israel has balked, citing security concerns _ concerns that
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said were underscored by Sunday's
attempted attack in the center of Jerusalem.
	   Dahlan said the Israeli team had refused to discuss the U.S.
plan. ``Whenever the Palestinians brought up the U.S. initiative,
the Israelis would say `not yet,''' Dahlan told the Associated
Press.
	   Netanyahu said Israel was coming to the talks with ``an open
mind and a desire to achieve an agreement.''
	   ``I call on the Palestinian Authority to engage with us
continually, day and night, in negotiations, including at the
highest levels,'' he said. The prime minister told reporters he did
not rule out a meeting later with Arafat.
	   Earlier in the day, Netanyahu separately told his Cabinet and
visiting Jordanian Foreign Minister Jawad Anani that he was
determined to reach an agreement with the Palestinians, and soon.
	   Netanyahu has said a deal was within reach if the Palestinians
met several key Israeli demands including disarming militants,
reducing the size of its police force and removing sections of the
PLO covenant which call for Israel's destruction.

 &UR; Toronto Blue Jays 9, New York Yankees 9-3

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Jose Canseco hit two home runs, including a grand
slam, and Carlos Delgado hit the first ball into SkyDome's fifth
deck in right field as the Toronto Blue Jays slowed the New York
Yankees 9-3 Sunday.
	   The Blue Jays won twice in the three-game series. New York lost
a series for only the third time this season, and has now dropped
three of four games.
	   Canseco's sixth career slam gave the Blue Jays a 4-1 lead in the
third against Andy Pettitte (12-6), who lost for the first time
since May 31.
	   Canseco's 26th homer in the seventh hit the facing of the fifth
deck in left field, a 460-foot (140-meter) shot. It was his fourth
multi-homer game of the season and 31st of his career.
	   Delgado homered over the Hard Rock Cafe in right field, a
467-foot (142-meter) shot in the fifth. The two-run drive was
Delgado's 19th homer of the season.
	   In the 1989 AL playoffs while playing for Oakland, Canseco
became the first player to homer anywhere into the fifth deck,
connecting against Mike Flanagan.
	   Woody Williams (9-4) allowed three earned runs and six hits in 6
1-3 innings. He struck out three and walked five.
 &UR; Detroit Tigers 3, Boston Red Sox 1
	   At Detroit, Damion Easley and Bobby Higginson each hit RBI
singles in the eighth inning to give Justin Thompson his second
straight home win.
	   Tied 1-1 in the eighth, Joe Randa hit a one-out single off Tom
Gordon (4-3) and took third on Brian Hunter's single. Easley and
Higginson then hit consecutive singles.
	   Thompson (9-8) struck out 10 in a seven-hitter, his fourth
complete game.
	   Luis Gonzalez homered for the Tigers, who took two of three from
the Red Sox.
	   Boston starter Bret Saberhagen pitched seven strong innings but
got his third straight no-decision.
 &UR; Chicago White Sox 8, Cleveland Indians 1
	   At Chicago, Mike Sirotka pitched a four-hitter, slumping Frank
Thomas hit a three-run homer and Chicago capitalized on three
Cleveland errors.
	   Sirotka (9-9) retired 12 straight before Kenny Lofton singled
with one out in the ninth. He beat the Indians for the third time
this season while picking up his first victory since June 23 and
his fifth complete game.
	   Thomas, having his worst season since coming to the majors in
1990, was in a 1-for-16 skid when he lifted a pitch from Dave Burba
(10-8) over the fence in right-center for his 16th homer.
	   Burba, who has lost three straight, allowed nine hits and eight
runs in 5 2-3 innings.

	   SOUTHPORT, England (AP) _ A look at the final round of the
British Open on Sunday at the 7,018-yard, par-70 Royal Birkdale
Golf Club:
	    &UR; Victor: Mark O'Meara, by two strokes in a four-hole playoff
after an even-par 280.
	    &UR; Spoils: dlrs 525,000.
	    &UR; Runner-up: Brian Watts.
	    &UR; Quotable: ``Just pretend you've got Tiger out for an emergency
nine.''_ Caddie Jerry Higginbotham to Mark O'Meara as they prepared
for the playoff. O'Meara routinely wins practice rounds against
Tiger Woods.
	    &UR; Round of the day: Scotland's Raymond Russell and Tiger Woods,
both at 66.
	    &UR; Shot of the day: Seventeen-year-old Justin Rose of England made
an incredible 45-yard (41-meter) chip-in on No. 18. He tied for
fourth place at 2-over 282, the best showing by an amateur at the
British Open since 1953.
	    &UR; Comeback Kid: Tiger Woods' 66 included a 30-foot (9-meter)
birdie chip-in on No. 17 and a 30-foot (9-meter) birdie putt on No.
18. Woods, who entered the final round five shots off the lead,
missed making the playoff by one shot.
	    &UR; Noteworthy: Mark O'Meara's 280 was the first even par to win
the Open since Greg Norman in 1986 at Turnberry.
	    &UR; Key Statistic: On the final six holes, runner-up Brian Watts
never made worse than par during the tournament until the last hole
of the playoff, No. 18.

Stevie Wonder, Michael Jackson help Mandela celebrate
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: New throughout to UPDATE with scenes from birthday banquet,
Mandela quotes &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos planned &QL; 
 &UR; By ANDREW SELSKY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Singers Stevie Wonder and
Michael Jackson, actor Danny Glover and 2,000 other guests sang for
President Nelson Mandela on Sunday, but the highlight of the
star-studded birthday bash was a kiss.
	   The party at an estate north of Johannesburg marked the first
time Mandela appeared in public with Graca Machel, his long-time
sweetheart, since he married her at his home on Saturday, his 80th
birthday.
	   Surrounded by 80 children _ each carrying a candle marking his
years _ and facing a chest-high birthday cake, Mandela said: ``My
wife and I...''
	   At those four words, the estate's banquet hall erupted into
applause, cheers and whistles. Mandela and Graca then kissed,
causing outright pandemonium. When it subsided, Mandela was able to
continue: ``My wife and I say thank you very much.''
	   After Mandela and Machel blew out a candle atop the cake on the
third try, Wonder, on keyboards, led Jackson _ replete in black
hat, spangly black jacket and aviator sunglasses _ and dozens of
other performers in singing a version of Happy Birthday. National
television broadcast the banquet live to the nation and a worldwide
audience of 150 million people.
	   Earlier, Mandela made his birthday wish, expressing hope for a
South Africa ``free of hatred and discrimination; a place from
which hunger and homelessness have been banished; a safe place for
our children to grow into our future leaders.''
	   Some of Mandela's 26 grandchildren and four great-grandchildren
helped him celebrate in the Gallagher Estate, a posh conference
venue. The site has historical significance not lost on the guests
_ Gallagher Estate was where the Independent Electoral Commission
coordinated South Africa's first all-race elections in 1994, a vote
which was the death knell of apartheid.
	   Mandela spend 27 years in prison for leading the fight against
white rule, and Sunday's party was as much a tribute to his
sacrifices as to his turning 80.
	   Deputy President Thabo Mbeki, who will likely win the 1999
elections _ Mandela is retiring _ toasted Mandela, saying he ``gave
so much to ensure that we live in conditions of freedom and
prosperity.''
	   Photos from Mandela's life were on display: Mandela as a young
amateur boxer, Mandela upon his release from prison in 1994,
Mandela with world leaders and celebrities.
	   Guests paid up to 10,000 rand (dlrs 1,590) to attend. The money
goes to charities sponsored by Mandela.
	   Saturday's wedding wass the third for Mandela and the second for
Machel. The couple met in 1990.
	   Machel, 52, works on children's issues for the United Nations
and is the widow of Mozambique President Samora Machel, who died in
a 1986 plane crash.
	   Mandela divorced his second wife, Winnie, in 1996 after 38 years
of marriage on grounds she had been unfaithful. He was in prison
during most of their marriage _ from 1964 until 1990.
	   Mandela's first marriage was in 1944, but he and his wife,
Evelyn, divorced in 1957 after quarrels about his long nights of
political involvement. The couple had four children. Two of them
died.

	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Singers Stevie Wonder and
Michael Jackson, actor Danny Glover and 2,000 other guests sang for
President Nelson Mandela on Sunday, but the highlight of the
star-studded birthday bash was a kiss.
	   The party at an estate north of Johannesburg marked the first
time Mandela appeared in public with Graca Machel, his long-time
sweetheart, since he married her at his home on Saturday, his 80th
birthday.
	   Surrounded by 80 children _ each carrying a candle marking his
years _ and facing a chest-high birthday cake, Mandela said: ``My
wife and I...''
	   At those four words, the estate's banquet hall erupted into
applause, cheers and whistles. Mandela and Graca then kissed,
causing outright pandemonium. When it subsided, Mandela was able to
continue: ``My wife and I say thank you very much.''
	   After Mandela and Machel blew out a candle atop the cake on the
third try, Wonder, on keyboards, led Jackson _ replete in black
hat, spangly black jacket and aviator sunglasses _ and dozens of
others in a funky version of Happy Birthday. National television
broadcast the banquet live to the nation and a worldwide audience
of 150 million people.

<TEXT>
	   MONTAUBAN, France (AP) - A hot day brought two Frenchman glory
Sunday with the Tour de France trying to return to racing after a
week of tumultuous events that rocked the Tour.
	   Ironically, a rider who was suspended for six months for failing
a drug test took over the overall lead.
	   Laurent Desbiens of France went into first by being part of a
breakaway that ended up more than seven minutes ahead of the pack.
	   Jacky Durand of France won the eighth stage as he was part of
the group that included Desbiens in the day's leg from Brive-La
Gaillarde to Montauban, 190 kilometers (118 miles).
	   Durand won the final sprint over Andrea Tafi with two other
Italians, Fabio Sacchi and Eddy Mazzoleni third and fourth.
	   Desbiens was fifth.
	   After a week of drug talk, ironically Desbiens was suspended for
six months in 1996 for nandrolone, a steroid, during a race in
France.

	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ In his 80th birthday message,
President Nelson Mandela congratulated South Africans for changing
their nation from an apartheid state to a multi-racial democracy,
but said more work lies ahead.
	   The message was inscribed on a scroll and enclosed in a box
painted with the colors of the South African flag. Each of the
2,000 guests attending a banquet Sunday to celebrate Mandela's 80th
birthday received one.
	   It read:
	   ``I am humbled by the support and enthusiasm that has been shown
by our people to mark the celebration of my 80th birthday.
	   ``Together with some 40 million citizens of our land we have
walked a difficult path to reach where we are. We have made
gigantic strides indeed. Peace and tranquility now reign in South
Africa. Democracy is firmly entrenched and people all over South
Africa are setting to the task of rebuilding our country.
	   ``Yes, many challenges lay ahead, but we are a democracy which,
young as it is, has made success its trademark.
	   ``On my 80th birthday, I appeal to all South Africans
irrespective of political affiliation to work together to make
South Africa the shining example of a better place to live in.
	   ``We have made a good start. The foundation we have laid is
firm. Let us all build on it.''

Puerto Rico 84, United States 76
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BILL BARNARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Basketball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The Dream Team this time was from Puerto Rico,
not the National Basketball Association.
	   At least two-thirds of the crowd of 8,617 at Madison Square
Garden on Sunday was rooting for an experienced Puerto Rican team
over a group of U.S. college players, who led by 19 points early in
the second half before falling 84-76 in the Goodwill Games.
	   ``We were expecting the fan support,'' said Jose Ortiz, a former
Utah Jazz player who scored 13 of his 17 points in the second half.
``There is a great Puerto Rican community in New York.''
	   Ortiz, 34; Jerome Mincy, 33; and Eddie Casiano, 25, are the
nucleus of a Puerto Rican team that has played together
internationally for the entire decade. The U.S. college players
were in junior high school when the bulk of Puerto Rico's team
started playing together, and the Americans came together as a team
only last week.
	   ``Even though they're young players, they had the weapons to
beat us,'' Ortiz said, ``but we played well in the second half.''
	   Casiano scored 26 of his 31 points after halftime for Puerto
Rico, which trailed 55-36 with 15 1/2 minutes left, then outscored
the Americans 48-21 the rest of the way.
	   ``In the second half, our defense came together and we got the
ball to Casiano and Jose,'' Puerto Rico coach Carlos Morales said.
	   Casiano, 4-for-5 from 3-point range and 10-for-16 from the field
overall, said it was ``the biggest mistake of my life that I didn't
come to the United States'' to play college basketball in 1992.
Instead, he forfeited his eligibility to play in a pro league in
Puerto Rico that folded after one year.
	   Elton Brand of Duke was the only consistent performer for the
United States, scoring 24 points. The only other U.S. player in
double figures was Wally Szczerbiak of Miami-Ohio, who scored 12
points but only two in the second half.
	   ``This is a higher level of basketball than I'm used to,'' Brand
said. ``We did our best. We have to bounce back and finish
strong.''
	   The United States plays China on Monday night, while Puerto Rico
faces Brazil in the round-robin tournament.
	   Andre Miller of Utah and Khalid El-Amin of Connecticut were
repeatedly thwarted on drives to the basket in the second half as
Puerto Rico tightened its inside defense, then let Casiano lead the
way offensively.
	   ``Without a doubt, experience was the deciding factor,'' U.S.
coach Clem Haskins said. ``They've got guys who have been together
a long time. That really proved out in the second half.''
	   Miller, who led Utah to the Final Four this year, was 1-for-9
from the field, and El-Amin was 2-for-8.
	   ``Puerto Rico knew how to make you do what you didn't want to
do,'' Szczerbiak said.

Watts needed two miracle shots but found only one
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos BIRK107; LON120 &QL;

 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SOUTHPORT, England (AP) _ Brian Watts made the shot of his life
to get into a British Open playoff. Four holes later, he needed
something even better.
	   When his second sand shot on the 18th hole in less than an hour
didn't go in Sunday, his improbable Open hopes were gone with it.
	   Watts had already pulled off one amazing shot from nearly the
same spot, but a second one just wasn't in the bag.
	   Mark O'Meara was the Open champion in a playoff, and Watts had
to settle for the dlrs 329,000 second-place prize money and,
perhaps, a one-way ticket from Japan to the PGA Tour.
	   ``I knew I had to try to hole the bunker shot to have any
chance,'' Watts said.
	   On a day when Watts played steady but unspectacular golf on the
wet Royal Birkdale links, his Open chances ended up resting on two
nearly impossible shots out of sand traps fronting the left side of
the 18th green.
	   Watts thrilled the huge crowd with the first shot, hitting from
an awkward stance to within about 6 inches (15 centimeters) of the
hole. He made par to force the playoff.
	   But he couldn't make an even harder shot _ a birdie from the
sand that could have extended the four-hole playoff into sudden
death.
	   When the shot didn't drop, and rolled 25 feet (7.6 meters) past,
O'Meara had his second major championship of the year. (He won the
Masters in April).
	   ``I never gave up,'' said Watts, an Oklahoman who plays on the
Japanese tour. ``Obviously, I'm not happy I lost, but I'm proud of
myself.''
	   O'Meara was sitting on a towel with his family on the wet grass
surrounding the 18th green as Watts came up the fairway for the
first time Sunday.
	   O'Meara had just finished at even par, and Watts had just made a
12-footer (3.6 meter shot) on the 17th hole to draw even.
	   But Watts was in the left rough after pulling a 3-wood off the
tee. His chances of making a par that would force a playoff were
slim.
	   Watts looked up at the scoreboard to see O'Meara had made par.
He took out a 6-iron and caught more ball than grass, but he pulled
it and the ball hopped a few times before rolling gently into the
first trap to the left of the green.
	   The fun was just beginning.
	   With the ball in a down-slope just inside the front edge of the
trap, Watts could not stand with both feet inside it. He would have
to dig in with his left foot in the bunker and plant his right foot
on the slippery grass surrounding it, then hit a shot high enough
to clear the lip but low enough to carry to the pin.
	   ``I just tried to create something in my mind, visualize a great
shot,'' Watts said.
	   In his mind, he saw it going in. If it had, he would be the Open
champion.
	   Watts went into the bunker once, then came back out to look
again at the pin. He climbed back in, took two half swings and
waggled the club once. Then he hit the shot of his life.
	   The ball shot out of the sand, hit softly on a mound on the
fringe and began rolling to the right toward the hole. It didn't go
quite right enough, though, sliding past the hole on the left and
finishing within tap-in distance.
	   From his greenside perch, O'Meara applauded, then got ready for
the playoff.
	   ``The bunker shot he played on the 72nd hole was as good as I've
ever seen with all the pressure on,'' O'Meara said.
	   As good as it was, Watts would need one more. Only this time, it
was not to be.
	   A stroke down in the four-hole playoff, he came to 18 for the
second time in less than an hour. This time he didn't help his
chances by pulling a 4-iron into a bunker just in back of the one
he played from before.
	   With O'Meara on the fringe 18 feet (5.5 meters) away in two,
Watts needed to sink his bunker shot to have any chance.
	   When it flew past the hole and rolled down the fringe, the Open
was over.

Funk back on top after winning Deposit Guaranty Golf Classic
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEPHEN HAWKINS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADISON, Miss. (AP) _ Fred Funk used stretch of birdies on the
back nine Sunday to win the Deposit Guaranty Golf Classic for his
fifth PGA Tour victory.
	   Funk, who had finished top five in the three of his last four
tournaments, had four birdies down the stretch for a final-round
68. He finished with a four-day total of 18-under 270 and his first
victory since the 1996 B.C. Open.
	   Franklin Langham, who was trying to become the PGA Tour's fourth
first-time winner in six weeks, blew a four-stroke lead on the back
nine and lost any chance for a victory by messing up at No. 17 for
the second day in a row.
	   Langham finished two strokes back in second place with Paul
Goydos and Tim Loustalot, who carded a final-round 66 for his first
top 30 finish in 37 tournaments.
	   Funk, who began the final round tied with Mike Brisky, two shots
ahead of the field, played the front nine in even par. As he stood
in the No. 10 fairway at 14-under, Langham tapped in a birdie on
the green to go to 18-under.
	   But Langham, who had a front-nine 31, bogeyed the 11th, 13th,
14th and 17th, where he had a triple bogey on Saturday.
	   Like Langham, Funk had a tap-in birdie at the 407-yard
(372-meter) 10th. Funk took a par at No. 11 and then sank long
birdie putts on the next two holes to take a one-stroke lead.
	   Funk, the former Maryland golf coach, entered the tournament
with more than dlrs 4.2 million in 10 full PGA Tour seasons.
	   After finishing third in the Kemper Open, he withdrew from the
Buick Open after a first-round 74 and then followed with top-five
finishes the last two weeks at Hartford and Quad City.
	   Loustalot had nine birdies and three bogeys Sunday. The former
Nike Tour player, who regained his PGA card at Qualifying School
last winter, had made just 10 cuts before this weekend and had
never finished better than 32nd.
	   Brisky quickly fell out of contention for his first PGA Tour
victory when he started the day double bogey-bogey.
	   Brisky's first two shots of the day hit trees and the third
ended up in a bunker short of the green, and he didn't get up and
down. On No. 2, a 213-yard (195-meter) par 3, his tee shot missed
the green to the right. After pitching over a small creek, he
two-putted for bogey.

	   EAST RUTHERFORD, New Jersey (AP) _ Eduardo Hurtado scored two
goals and assisted on another Sunday as New York-New Jersey beat
the Columbus Crew 3-0 in Major League Soccer.
	   The victory gave the MetroStars a 10-9 record, lifting them into
second place in the MLS Eastern Conference, one point (28-27) ahead
of the Crew. Columbus is now 9-9.
	   Hurtado set up the MetroStars' first goal in the 26th minute
when he fought off two Columbus defenders at the top of the box to
head the ball to the feet of teammate Giovanni Savarese.
	   Savarese pushed the ball past defender Thomas Dooley and put the
ball under goalkeeper Juergen Sommer into the left corner of the
Columbus net.
	   Hurtado tallied his first goal in the 42nd minute, leaping high
over a defender in the box to drill a header past Sommer following
a cross from Tab Ramos. Hurtado closed out the scoring in the 86th
minute running onto a long pass from Billy Walsh and rolling a shot
into the Crew net for his eighth goal of the season.
	   Tony Meola made four saves to register his record 18th MLS
career shutout. His toughest save was a diving fingertip stop on a
header by Brian McBride in the 56th minute.

	   MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) _ The embattled leader of the Sandinista
Front threatened Sunday to reactivate rebel fighters if the current
administration tries to roll back land reforms made following the
1979 revolution.
	   The remarks by Sandinista leader and former president Daniel
Ortega came during ceremonies 19th anniversary of the entrance of
rebel forces into Managua on July 19, 1979, and the overthrow of
dictator Anastasio Somoza.
	   ``We will reactivate the guerrilla commandos to fight for the
conquests of the people,'' Ortega told a rally of about 10,000
Sandinista supporters at a downtown square once known as the Plaza
of the Revolution.
	   Following Ortega's defeat in 1989 presidential elections, the
square was renamed Plaza of the Republic. That was the same name it
bore under Somoza.
	   ``Let's hope (the government) does not force us to organize the
Sandinista guerrilla commands in the mountains and the cities'' to
defend the land grants, said Ortega, who has made similar threats
in the past.
	   President Arnoldo Aleman has claimed that some land reforms
carried out under the 1979-1989 Sandinista government and a
subsequent administration involved unfair land confiscations.

	   CANCUN, Mexico (AP) _ Mexico's largest television network is
scheduled to inaugurate a shared news-programming format Monday
with correspondents from other media outlets in 18 Latin American
countries.
	   Mexico's Grupo Televisa said the plan to share more resources
with Latin American broadcasters is an effort to extend its reach
into Spanish-language television households.
	   As a first step, the Mexican media giant said its 24-hour news
channel, Eco, will begin to rely on a network of hundreds of
reporters, most of whom work for local stations in their home
countries.
	   In return, the local stations will be allowed to air Eco reports
to bolster international coverage.
	   The arrangement could be extended to include entertainment
programming and equipment purchases.
	   Televisa executives said they had no plans to buy stakes in
Latin American stations, an approach they said risks resentment
from local owners.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Misconduct in the financing of a troubled
30-year-old Mexico City office tower project reached into the
highest levels of government, a developer charged in reports
published Sunday.
	   The developer, Francisco de Paula Leon, filed a dlrs 17 million
civil suit last week charging former finance secretary and current
central bank head Guillermo Ortiz with having pressured the
projects' owners to sell out to another construction company in
1992.
	   Private and government banks then allegedly showered the new
owners with more than dlrs 400 million in loans, most of which the
new owners, Grupo Gutsa, never paid back, De Paula Leon told the
magazine Proceso.
	   De Paula Leon said his group was denied such loans. He said
Ortiz, then assistant finance secretary, threatened to expropriate
the project unless the owners sold their stake at a price below
market value.
	   The tower, now known as the World Trade Center of Mexico, was
begun in the late 1960s as a hotel. One of the tallest buildings in
Mexico City, it has been plagued by financial problems and
scandals.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Four people have died in recent days from a
heat wave battering the city of San Luis Rio Colorado, local media
reported Sunday.
	   Temperatures have hit highs of 120 degrees in recent days in San
Luis, located in the northwest corner of Sonora state about 20
miles (30 kms) south of Yuma, Arizona.
	   One man was found dead in his car Saturday, apparently from heat
exhaustion or sun stroke, while another died at a San Luis shopping
center.
	   The body of an unidentified male was found in a rural area 15
miles (25 kms) south of San Luis Saturday, and another man also
died of apparent heat exhaustion in the same area that day, the
government news agency Notimex quoted local health officials as
saying.

Players stay unified _ and away from championships in Greece

	   MIAMI (AP) _ Gary Payton scanned the defense as he ran upcourt,
zipping a pass between two defenders to teammate Tim Hardaway.
Hardaway returned the favor, and Payton fired a no-look pass to
Glen Rice for a mid-range jumper.
	   This wasn't happening Sunday in Monte Carlo, where the trio
originally was scheduled to be preparing for the World
Championships in Greece. It took place at Miami Arena, at a charity
game organized by Alonzo Mourning of the Miami Heat.
	   And until the work dispute between the National Basketball
Association management and players ends, it's the closest any of
them are going to get to organized competition.
	   NBA management has longe wanted to re-open contract talks; the
players refuse. Last month the league delivered on a season-long
threat by declaring a lockout effective July 1, when the old
contract expired. The lockout means there could be no trades,
free-agent signings, practices or summer camps.
	   ``It's disappointing,'' said Payton, one of five members of the
original World Championship team who took part in the second annual
``Zo's Summer Groove'' event Sunday.
	   The 12 original members of the US team were removed from the
roster in late June for refusing to play in the event of a lockout.
They have been replaced by a team of CBA players and collegians.
	   ``We want to represent our country,'' Payton continued. ``That's
a lot of guys' dream, to win a gold medal. Like my buddy Vin
(Baker, a Seattle teammate) _ he's never won anything like that.
But we've got to stick together.''
	   While the original Team USA players are somewhat saddened by the
missed opportunity, there were no regrets.
	   ``I'd love to go,'' said Milwaukee's Terrell Brandon. ``Greece
is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. And I've heard so much about
Monte Carlo. It's disappointing. But we made the right decision.''
	   New York's Patrick Ewing, the NBA Players Association president,
and other union officials have a breakfast meeting scheduled Monday
with commissioner David Stern. It will be the first time the sides
have met since the lockout was imposed.
	   ``We'll see how it goes,'' said Ewing, limited to coaching duty
Sunday because his right wrist remains bandaged from the
dislocation he suffered in December. ``I don't know what's going to
happen.''
	   Nineteen other NBA players and two top draft picks came to Miami
for Mourning's game. Unity was the buzzword whenever the subject of
the lockout came up, and some even thought games might be lost for
the first time. Training camps begin in October, with season
openers the first week in November.
	   ``We've got a long way to go. I think (owners) are going to
prolong it, then get down to negotiating in September,'' Payton
said. ``They want us to just sweat it out, see if the players break
down.''
	   Not this time, many said.
	   ``We have definite unity,'' said Washington's Juwan Howard, a
member of the union's executive board. ``Three years ago, we didn't
have this kind of camaraderie.''
	   Miami's P.J. Brown said: ``It's going to be a long summer. It's
at a standstill.''

	   EAST RUTHERFORD, New Jersey (AP) _ Eduardo Hurtado scored two
goals and assisted on another Sunday as New York-New Jersey beat
the Columbus Crew 3-0 in Major League Soccer.
	   The victory gave the MetroStars a 10-9 record, lifting them into
second place in the MLS Eastern Conference, one point (28-27) ahead
of the Crew. Columbus is now 9-9.
	   Hurtado set up the MetroStars' first goal in the 26th minute
when he fought off two Columbus defenders at the top of the box to
head the ball to the feet of teammate Giovanni Savarese.
	   Savarese pushed the ball past defender Thomas Dooley and put the
ball under goalkeeper Juergen Sommer into the left corner of the
Columbus net.
	   Hurtado tallied his first goal in the 42nd minute, leaping high
over a defender in the box to drill a header past Sommer following
a cross from Tab Ramos. Hurtado closed out the scoring in the 86th
minute running onto a long pass from Billy Walsh and rolling a shot
into the Crew net for his eighth goal of the season.
	   Tony Meola made four saves to register his record 17th MLS
career shutout. His toughest save was a diving fingertip stop on a
header by Brian McBride in the 56th minute.

<TEXT>
	   CHARLESTON, West Virginia (AP) _ There was a time when Tyrone
Phillips had a future any schoolyard hotshot would envy.
	   He was a top college player with a chance to make it to the
National Basketball Association. He had the moves and the acclaim.
And he had a dream that didn't seem too far off.
	   Now it's over. And he knows it.
	   Phillips, 25, is a quadriplegic. On Monday he is scheduled to be
sentenced to up to life in prison for conspiring to sell cocaine.
	   ``What can they do? They can't kill me,'' he said. ``My day
consists of watching TV and watching movies. I don't go anywhere or
do anything. The only thing they can do is take me somewhere
else.''
	   His life was always tough. His parents divorced when he was in
junior high school and he moved in with his aunt, May Elders, in
Compton, California, a rough Los Angeles neighborhood filled with
drugs and gangs.
	   She was strict with him through high school. She says he had to
come to West Virginia to find trouble.
	   ``If I had been around I'm sure it wouldn't have happened. But
he was so far away from me.'' said Elders, 72. ``I can't understand
why somebody that's as nice as he is could have such horrible,
terrible luck.''
	   Wayne Wade, his church basketball coach in Los Angeles,
remembers his protege as a good player and ``bright young man.''
	   Phillips became a starting forward as a sophomore at Marshall
University in nearby Huntington. His 22-point average kept fans and
sports writers circling.
	   ``Tyrone was a very talented person on and off the court,'' said
assistant coach Donnie Jones, now an assistant at Florida. ``I
thought his best days were ahead of him if he could have just done
the right thing.''
	   Added former teammate Brett Vincent: ``He had a great athletic
ability and he could have made a living playing professional
basketball,'' Vincent said.
	   But some saw Phillips' downfall coming.
	   ``He was a real `head case' in a lot of ways. He had a trail of
troubles,'' said Rick McCann, sports writer for The Herald-Dispatch
in Huntington. ``He's just a guy who had tons of potential, but he
just never seemed to reach it. He kind of went his own way a lot of
times. He was not really a team type of guy.''
	   In the spring of his senior year, Phillips dropped out to play
for a summer league in Canada. He then played four months for a pro
league in France, broke his wrist and returned to Huntington.
	   Many of his teammates had graduated, and he began spending time
with a new crowd: drug dealers.
	   ``I hung out with everybody who wanted to have a good time,'' he
said. ``I never even thought about it.''
	   In February 1994, Phillips said one of those friends agreed to
lend him dlrs 300 to attend his grandmother's funeral.
	   In Charleston to pick up the cash, Phillips said he got between
his friend, a known drug dealer, and a gunman who wanted money from
the dealer. Phillips was shot four times in the legs and lower
torso.
	   When he recovered, he played two months in France before
learning his girlfriend, Katrina Wynes, was pregnant. He used dlrs
40,000 in basketball money to buy a house in Winston-Salem, North
Carolina, for his family.
	   In January 1995, he returned to Marshall to finish his criminal
justice degree, driving home on weekends to be with Wynes and their
daughter, Tyra. But he was still hanging out with his drug-dealing
friends during the week.
	   Phillips was headed to New York in hopes of signing another
basketball contract on Feb. 19, 1995, when his truck hit a tree
near the airport in Greensboro, North Carolina. He was paralyzed
and a passenger was killed.
	   Phillips was in the hospital three months and underwent about 10
operations to ease pressure in his brain and remove glass from his
head.
	   A federal grand jury indicted him for conspiracy to sell cocaine
in October 1996 after prosecutors said Phillips gave his father and
another man a list of drug clients from his hospital bed. They said
Phillips authorized deals, made introductions and enforced debt
collections.
	   ``I was a target for drugs,'' he said. ``When they saw I had
money, the first thing they assumed was it was drug money. They
never found anything.''
	   Phillips was convicted in March in Huntington on two counts of
conspiracy to distribute cocaine and three counts of having his
father and others distribute cocaine in Huntington from 1995 to
1996. He was released on bond.
	   Phillips' father, Edward Phillips, 48, was sentenced to nine
years in prison last year after pleading guilty to selling cocaine.
The elder Phillips testified against his son on a plea bargain.
	   The younger Phillips admitted being in the drug business, but
denied any involvement following his accident, said Assistant U.S.
Attorney Ray Shepard.
	   ``If he can commit a crime in his condition, and he did so, then
he should have to answer for it,'' Shepard said.
	   Some of his old friends, like Wade, still cannot believe it.
	   ``If a man is on his sick bed and can't get out and do anything,
how can people say he's out selling drugs?'' Wade said. ``Me,
personally, I don't think so unless he flipped or changed.''
	   Phillips testified he had seen cocaine only once in his life.
	   ``After I got paralyzed I didn't think anything else could
happen,'' he said. ``I still enjoy life. I still have my
memories.''

	   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) _ Todd Martin spoiled Xavier Malisse's 18th
birthday Sunday but Belgium avoided a sweep when Jim Courier
retired with an arm injury.
	   Courier was leading Christophe Van Garsse, 6-3, 1-4, when he
left the court. In Sunday's opening match at the Indianapoils
Tennis Center, Martin beat Malisse, 7-6 (7-1), 6-3.
	   ``I just have a tired arm from a lot of tennis this weekend,''
said Courier, who won a four-set singles match against Filip Dewulf
on Friday and then teamed with Martin as the United States clinched
the tie with a five-set doubles triumph in a three-and-a-half hour
match.
	   Courier said he could have played if the match had meant
anything.
	   ``I'm more willing to risk injury when there's something on the
line,'' he said. ``I just don't think it's wise for me to continue
on, playing like that. If I can't play comfortably out there,
there's really not much point in playing.''
	   The United States won on its home soil for the 18th consecutive
time and will play Italy in the semifinals on September 25-27. The
tie will be in the United States at a site to be determined.
	   Sunday's matches were reduced to best-of-three sets since the
Americans had clinched by winning the opening three matches.
	   Belgium made a switch with 18-year-old Malisse making his Davis
Cup singles debut as a replacement for Dewulf.
	   Court temperatures in the 90's (30's) with high humidity created
difficult playing conditions.
	   ``It is Malisse versus Martin or Belgium versus the USA but it
is us versus the weather,.'' said Martin, who was only broken once
and won 80 percent of his first serve points.
	   ``If there's anything I can count on, day in and day out, it's
my serve,'' Martin said. ``A day like today, it's easy to serve
because it's so hot, you're loose.''

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Fire broke out on a cruise liner anchored in a
river near the south coast of England on Sunday but firefighters
extinguished it quickly, the coast guard said.
	   Six crew were treated for smoke inhalation but no one was
reported injured. Passengers gathered on deck in their lifejackets
but did not have to evacuate.
	   The Caledonian Star, with 97 passengers and 76 crew, was berthed
in the River Dart near Dartmouth when the fire started in the linen
storage room, the Brixton coast guard reported.
	   Shore-based firefighters from Brixham and Dartmouth extinguished
the blaze.
	   Many passengers were on a shore visit after the
Nassau-registered vessel had arrived from the Channel Islands.
	   The Caledonian Star was due to go on to the Scilly Isles, off
the southwest coast of England, but the coast guard said officials
would seek more information about the ship before it is permitted
to sail

17-year-old Justin Rose is England's newest hero

<TEXT>
	   SOUTHPORT, England (AP) _ Justin Rose is England's newest hero
and golf's latest prodigy.
	   The 17-year-old ``Boy Wonder,'' as the British tabloids have
dubbed him, upstaged Sunday's Open winner Mark O'Meara in the
hearts of English fans frustrated by a disappointing finish in
soccer's World Cup.
	   ``Go Rose. You are doing England proud,'' read a good-luck
message Sunday on the scoreboard at hole No. 7 at Royal Birkdale.
	   ``Rose, stay on the scent,'' said a headline in Sunday's The
Observer newspaper.
	   Rose, in the sweetest moment of his young career, finished tied
for fourth with a 1-under 69 Sunday, just two strokes behind
O'Meara and Brian Watts after regulation. O'Meara won in a
four-hole playoff.
	   He made a serious run at a title no amateur has won since Bobby
Jones 68 years ago and recorded the best finish by an amateur since
Frank Stranahan tied for second behind Ben Hogan at Carnoustie in
1953.
	   So much for his amateur career.
	   Born in South Africa but living in England since he was 5, Rose
said after the round he was turning pro. Not being one cost him
69,875 pounds (dlrs 121,000) Sunday, the cut of the prize money he
couldn't share.
	   ``That would be lovely,'' he said of the money. ``But that's
something I'm not going to regret one bit.''
	   On a day of light on-and-off showers, Rose brought thunder to
thousands in the gallery at 18 when he chipped in from 45 yards for
a birdie to end his round.
	   ``It was a tough shot, out of the rough and over a bunker,'' he
recalled. ``It was one of those incredible moments. The ball got
nearer and nearer and finally disappeared. I couldn't believe it.''
	   The 6-foot Rose is slender, the swing is fluid. He had plastic
clubs at 11 months, a real set at 5, and was playing scratch golf
at 14. His 4-under 66 in the second round tied the lowest round by
an amateur in the Open, set by Stranahan in 1950 and matched by
Tiger Woods two years ago at Royal Lytham.
	   ``I was going to use this week as a big sort of _ you know to
help me judge (about going pro),'' he said. ``The way it's gone I'd
be silly not to.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   TIGER'S PUTT: For a second, it looked like Hale Irwin all over
again.
	   Tiger Woods, needing an 8-footer to avoid a three-putt on the
first hole, missed it to the left and stomped over to tap it in
with one hand.
	   It first looked as though the putter stubbed the grass and
missed the ball, but replays showed that Woods dropped the putter
down and swept it in.
	   The stroke caught the attention of the Royal and Ancient.
Secretary Michael Bonallack studied replays in the television
trailer before ruling it was OK.
	   In 1983 at Royal Birkdale, Irwin missed a 20-foot birdie putt on
No. 14 in the third round, but whiffed trying to backhand it in. He
had to take bogey, and wound up losing by one stroke to Tom Watson.
	   For Woods, it was nearly critical as he shot 4-under 66 Sunday
for third place just one stroke behind O'Meara and Watts.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   NO TIGER: &LR;  Woods will not defend his BellSouth Classic title
next year because of a change in the PGA Tour schedule. The event
has been moved to April 1-4, the week before the Masters. The event
this year was May 7-10.
	   ``My routine of several consecutive Florida tournament followed
by a week off before the Masters has proven to permit me to play my
best and I will likely follow that schedule again in 1999,'' he
said.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   CHIP SHOTS: &LR;  Attendance the first three days at Royal Birkdale
was 158,100, up 5,200 on 1991 and 43,000 on 1983. ... The lowest
aggregate score by an amateur at the Open was 281 by Iain Pyman at
Sandwich in 1993. ... Sir Michael Bonallack, the recently knighted
secretary of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club, may retire early. He
was expected to retire at the 2000 Open, but may push it forward.
He turns 65 on Dec. 31, 1999. ... Ian Woosnam blasted Open
officials for not moving up the tees to compensate for the
gale-force winds in the third round. ``They could see the wind
before we started,'' he said. ``But they hadn't given it much
thought.''

He came from nowhere and everywhere

<TEXT>
	   SOUTHPORT, England (AP) _ Brian Watts didn't come out of nowhere
to contend for the British Open. He came from everywhere.
	   From Montreal, Dallas, Oklahoma and Japan. From every
journeyman's dream and every name pro's nightmare. From out of a
greenside bunker in the fading light of a summer evening to give
Mark O'Meara the scare of a lifetime. Not once, but twice.
	   The first time Watts came out of the left-hand sand trap at
Royal Birkdale's 18th, he already had one foot in the grave. His
ball had settled in just below the lip and when he took a stance,
Watts had to plant his right foot outside the bunker. Somehow he
still cozied the shot up to within a foot of the cup, tapped in for
par, and forced O'Meara into a playoff.
	   The second time came an hour later, in almost the same place.
This time, Watts needed to hole an almost identical shot to force
another playoff. But he didn't have any hero shots left.
	   ``I never gave up,'' Watts said, defiant to the end. ``Never.
That's what I'm proud of most.''
	   His is the feel-good story of this tournament, the story of a
golfing gypsy with a chance, at last, to make his way back home.
	   Born in Canada and raised in Texas, the 32-year-old Watts played
college golf at Oklahoma State, where he won an National Collegiate
Athletic Association championship 11 years ago and where his wife
and baby boy still live. He plays nearly all of his golf, though,
in Japan, where he headed in 1993 after failing to hang onto the
PGA Tour card he had won two years earlier. He became a star there,
but a forgotten man just about everywhere else.
	   Then, beginning early Friday afternoon and continuing through
Saturday, the winds kicked up violently along the Lancashire coast
and turned the tournament upside down. Seagulls started walking.
Watts and his wind-cheating swing thrived.
	   He got around Birkdale with just 69 shots Friday, good enough
for the lead. So Watts and his wife, Debbye, and his caddie,
decided to hold a small celebration that night at a Chinese
restaurant. Nobody interrupted them, probably because nobody knew
he was the Open leader.
	   On Saturday, he was paired with Justin Rose, the 17-year-old
English amateur sensation. Everywhere they went, the galleries
greeted them with roars. Even with the swirling winds throwing the
cheers in every direction, Watts had no illusions who they were
for. ``Being honest,'' he said wistfully, referring to Rose, ``I
wish I was him.''
	   Even so, Watts managed a 73 on a day when the ``names'' were
running for cover. Defending champion Justin Leonard shot 82, Phil
Mickelson, 85, and Tiger Woods, 77. Watts was leading the
tournament again, but this time he didn't have to worry about not
being recognized. He and Debbye brought food back to the apartment
where they were staying, watched some television and went to sleep.
	   ``He wasn't nervous. He's been the same Brian Watts every
night,'' she said, ``which is really nice.''
	   The tournament was as close to a vacation together as the couple
gets. Watts lives in hotels in Japan, because even though he has
won 11 times there and has made as much as dlrs 1 million, he can't
afford any of the apartments he likes. He flies back to the States
a half-dozen times a year, stays long enough to avoid jet lag and
then returns.
	   Until Watts' runner-up finish here, the Japanese tour was the
only place he was assured a place to play. Whether the last four
days have raised his profile remains to be seen. But this much
about his life has changed already: His dlrs 329,000 share of the
purse is enough to rank him around 75th on the PGA Tour's
money-winning list. That virtually guarantees Watts a playing card
and another shot at playing full time in the United States.
	   Right after the playoff, though, Watts had no idea whether he
was ready to come back, to give up being a golfing citizen of the
world.
	   ``I haven't even thought about it, to be honest,'' he said. ``I
guess I'll make up my mind some other time.''
	   While the trophy presentation was being held on the 18th green,
his wife stood off to one side and watched. Someone asked whether
she expected her husband to join the PGA Tour.
	   ``The decision is up to Brian,'' she said.
	   Until this week, the last time she visited him in Japan with
their 1-year-old son, Jason, was at Thanksgiving. Jason was home
with Debbye's grandparents, and according to the latest reports, he
took his first steps this week.
	   ``What's next?'' Watts said, repeating a question. ``Long term,
I'm not sure. But tomorrow I'm going home.''

<TEXT>
	   MADISON, Mississippi (AP) _ Fred Funk used a stretch of birdies
on the back nine Sunday to win the Deposit Guaranty Golf Classic
for his fifth PGA Tour victory.
	   Funk, who had finished top five in the three of his last four
tournaments, had four birdies down the stretch for a final-round
68. He finished with a four-day total of 18-under 270 and his first
victory since the 1996 B.C. Open.
	   Franklin Langham, who was trying to become the PGA Tour's fourth
first-time winner in six weeks, blew a four-stroke lead on the back
nine and lost any chance for a victory by messing up at No. 17 for
the second day in a row.
	   Langham finished two strokes back in second place with Paul
Goydos and Tim Loustalot, who carded a final-round 66 for his first
top 30 finish in 37 tournaments.
	   Funk, who began the final round tied with Mike Brisky, two shots
ahead of the field, played the front nine in even par. As he stood
in the No. 10 fairway at 14-under, Langham tapped in a birdie on
the green to go to 18-under.
	   But Langham, who had a front-nine 31, bogeyed the 11th, 13th and
17th, where he had a triple bogey on Saturday.
	   Like Langham, Funk had a tap-in birdie at the 407-yard
(372-meter) 10th. Funk took a par at No. 11 and then sank long
birdie putts on the next two holes to take a one-stroke lead.
	   Funk, the former Maryland golf coach, has won more than dlrs 4.2
million in 10 full PGA Tour seasons.
	   After finishing third in the Kemper Open, he withdrew from the
Buick Open after a first-round 74 and then followed with top-five
finishes the last two weeks at Hartford and Quad City.
	   Loustalot had nine birdies and three bogeys Sunday. The former
Nike Tour player, who regained his PGA card at Qualifying School
last winter, had made just 10 cuts before this weekend and had
never finished better than 32nd.
	   Brisky quickly fell out of contention for his first PGA Tour
victory when he started the day double bogey-bogey.
	   Brisky's first two shots of the day hit trees and the third
ended up in a bunker short of the green, and he didn't get up and
down. On No. 2, a 213-yard (195-meter) par 3, his tee shot missed
the green to the right. After pitching over a small creek, he
two-putted for bogey.

	   SOUTHPORT, England (AP) _ Tiger Woods couldn't wait to get off
the course after the third round of the British Open. With the
championship on the line, he couldn't wait to get back on.
	   Woods, who went into the final round five strokes behind the
leader, used an incredible string of shots on the back nine to grab
a brief share of the lead.
	   He birdied three of the last four holes, including a 30-foot
(9-meter) chip-in on No. 17 and a 30-foot (9-meter) putt on the
last hole that brought the cheering gallery to its feet.
	   But the Open ended for Woods in the clubhouse at Royal Birkdale,
where he sat in front of a television watching as good friend Mark
O'Meara, then Brian Watts, birdied the 17th hole to pull a stroke
ahead.
	   Caddie Fluff Cowan waited outside the clubhouse door with clubs
at the ready in case both faltered on the 18th. But when O'Meara
sank a 2-footer (60 centimeter putt) to finish regulation play at
even par, Woods' 1 over posted 15 minutes earlier was no longer
good enough.
	   ``I knew that probably even par was going to be the number, and
I just didn't do it,'' Woods said.
	   Not that Woods didn't make it interesting, with a Palmer-like
charge capping a 4-under-66 that brought him into contention.
	   It happened in a flurry at the end, and it electrified the staid
British fans who crowded around the closing fairways to watch Woods
inject some added drama into an Open that ended up lacking none.
	   Cruising along at 1 under for the round and four shots off the
lead, Woods hit a 3-wood out of the rough to the fringe of the
par-5 15th hole for a two-putt birdie that seemed at the time to
have little significance other than being a well-played hole.
	   After a routine par on 16, Woods found himself on the fringe of
the par-5 17th hole in three. He took a pitching wedge out, chipped
it on and watched as it ran down toward the cup and dropped into
the hole for a birdie.
	   Woods pumped his fist and shouted ``Yeessss'' as the crowd
erupted. But he was not done.
	   Now just a stroke down, Woods stood on the 18th tee and hit an
iron to the fairway, followed by a 4-iron to 30 feet (9 meters). He
stroked the putt and it went from right to left into the hole for a
birdie.
	   ``I thought if I could shoot somehow about 30, 31, maybe a 32 if
I'm lucky on the back nine, I might have a chance of winning,''
Woods said.
	   But it was a 33, and it proved one shot short.
	   ``I came back and birdied three of the last four when I was kind
of out of it to give myself a chance,'' he said.
	   Woods' performance showed he has learned from his mistakes last
year at Royal Troon and picked up some of the patience needed on
the tough links courses of the British Open. He finished at even
par at Troon, 12 strokes behind winner Justin Leonard.
	   Woods, who had rounds of 73 and 77 at Birkdale between an
opening round of 65 and his closing round of 66, was in contention
in a major for the first time since winning the Masters in 1997.
	   He appeared to shoot himself out of it on Saturday, when he wore
a shell-shocked look and was simply relieved to be off the course
after struggling to a 7-over 77 in high winds.
	   Instead, he fought back on the final day in the rain to make a
decent run at his second major title at the age of 22. And he
wasn't going to second guess the poor shots he hit while things
were going badly for two rounds.
	   ``You could do that, and you could beat yourself up forever,''
he said. ``You have to look at the positive _ the fact I started
out good, finished good and I hit a lot of good shots this week.''
	   Cowan, protecting the clubs outside the clubhouse, agreed.
	   ``The kid's got no quit in him,'' the caddie said. ``He's
amazing.''

 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Goodwill Games founder Ted Turner and wife Jane
Fonda had Spike Lee's usual courtside seats at Madison Square
Garden for the United States-Puerto Rico basketball game Sunday.
But Turner's attention was elsewhere.
	   Late in the first half, Turner got a little antsy about how his
Atlanta Braves baseball team was doing against the Milwaukee
Brewers, and turned to the press table for an update.
	   His mood brightened considerably when he learned the Braves were
leading 5-2, and he started joking with reporters about how the
Goodwill Games are criticized as being ``made-for-TV Olympics. I'd
like to know what the Olympics are if not made-for-TV.''
	   Turner left at halftime to find a television for himself and
returned to courtside at the basketball game only briefly.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; GYMNASTICS CHANGES: The U.S. gymnastics team picked up an
Olympic name and lost a member to a knee injury.
	   Organizers said Dominique Dawes, a member of the gold-medal
winning U.S. women's team at the 1996 Summer Games was added to the
field for the uneven bars, joining Elsie Ray.
	   Kendall Beck was forced to withdraw because of a knee injury.
Beck, who suffered a torn anterior cruciate ligament in her right
knee while training for the games, was be replaced in the beam
event by Kristen Maloney who originally was scheduled to compete in
the floor exercise. Vanessa Atler of will double up, competing in
the floor exercise as well as the vault.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; REVENGE ON THE MATS: U.S. athletes will get another shot at
Iran in the Goodwill Games after all.
	   The Islamic Republic News Agency said Sunday in Tehran that
Iranian wrestlers will participate in the New York evemnt, as well
as an international youth freestyle tournament in Nevada starting
Aug. 6.
	   It had been reported earlier that Iran would boycott the
Goodwill Games. But the Iranian Wrestling Federation said not
participating would harm the country's standing in the wrestling
world, the daily Iran News reported.
	   These are the latest in a series of sports exchanges that have
followed the election of Mohammad Khatami, a moderate, as Iran's
president.
	   Khatami, who took office in August, has called for greater
cultural exchanges between Iran and the United States as a way of
improving relations, which were broken off in 1979 after Iranian
militants stormed the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and took Americans
hostage.
	   In February, a team of American wrestlers came to Tehran for a
tournament. In April, Iranians wrestled in a tournament in
Oklahoma.
	   Last month in Lyon, France, Iran beat the United States 2-1,
eliminating the Americans from the World Cup.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; BUT WHAT ABOUT SHARING THE SHOWER? Bill May says his status as
a rare man in the world of synchronized swimming has its
advantages.
	   ``I don't have to put on any makeup or hair gel, and I get to
wear a smaller suit,'' May said Sunday after he and partner
Kristina Lum finished second in the duet short program at the
Goodwill Games.
	   If the reigning U.S. national champions hold onto their position
behind Russia's Olga Brousnikina and Maria Kisseleva, May would win
one of the first medals for a man in international synchro. Men are
barred from the sport in the Olympics and most other major meets
but the Goodwill Games allowed May to compete under regional rules.
	   ``We did this because we wanted to change synchronized swimming
by utilizing the different skills of a man and women,'' May said.
``We want to evolve the sport, like ice skating has.''

Sorenstam sets records in winning

<TEXT>
	   NEW ROCHELLE, New York (AP) _ Annika Sorenstam finished off her
assault on the JAL Big Apple Classic record book Sunday with a
4-under-par 67 for her third tournament win of the year.
	   The 27-year-old established marks for 72-hole total (265),
strokes under par (19) and margin of victory (eight) after setting
the 54-hole record on Saturday and going into the final round with
a six-stroke lead.
	   Joan Pitcock had three birdies in a four-hole stretch on the
back nine and closed with a 66 to finish second at 273. Michell
Estill, who started the final round in second place, had a 71 and
was alone at 275. Betsy King was another stroke back in fourth
after a 67.
	   Estill was as close as four strokes early in the final round,
but Sorenstam pulled away with birdies at Nos. 6, 7 and 8 to offset
two early bogeys.
	   Sorenstam then put it away with birdies at Nos. 12, 13 and 15 on
the 6,161-yard (5,631.5-meter) Wykagyl Country Club course in the
New York suburb of New Rochelle. Her closing round matched her
opening 67 which she followed with a 66 and the third-round 65.
	   Sorenstam, who has won all three of her tournaments since the
first weekend in June, tied rookie sensation Se Ri Pak with the
three wins and passed Pak to take over the No. 1 spot on the money
list with the winner's share of dlrs 116,250 giving her dlrs
661,724 for the year.
	   The 1995 and 1997 LPGA player of the year, Sorenstam has won 15
tournaments in her career, nine in the last two years. She set the
money record last season with over dlrs 1.2 million.
	   The previous lowest score in the Big Apple Classic was Michele
Redman's 272 last year, and the lowest total under par was Betsy
King's 15-under in 1990 when the course played to a par of 72. The
largest margin of victory was Caroline Pierce McMillan's
five-stroke win in 1996 when the tournament was 54 holes.
	   Sorenstam's year has been as impressive as her four rounds this
week. She has finished in the top 10 in 11 of the 13 official
events she has played.
	   Pak's winning streak came to an end with a final-round 76 that
left her at 4-over 288. She won the U.S. Women's Open in a 20-hole
playoff two weeks ago _ her second major of the year _ and set LPGA
records for a round (61) and total (23-under 261) in last week's
Jamie Farr Kroger Classic.
	   ``Many, many times today I have bad breaks,'' she said. ``Today
I did not play well, but I'm happy I do my best and fans here are
so great.''

Sri Lankans lose to Glamorgan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CARDIFF, Wales (AP) _ Bowled out for only 54 in its first
innings, Sri Lanka lost by five wickets to English county champion
Glamorgan Sunday.
	   The tourists, who play England in a one-off test next month as
well as taking part in a triangular series of one day games
involving the host and South Africa, managed 222 in its seconds
innings thanks to 99 from Marvan Atapattu.
	   But Adrian Dale, who took four or 20 in the first innings,
followed it up with five for 25 in the second. Glamorgan needed
only 53 to win and got there despite the loss of five wickets, all
of them falling to off-spinner Muttiah Muralitherano, who wound up
with match figures of 10 for 94.

	   SOUTHPORT, England (AP) _ A look at the key hole in the final
round of the British Open on Sunday at Royal Birkdale Golf Club:
	   Hole: 18.
	   Yardage: 472. (Metrage: 431.5)
	   Par: 4.
	   Stroke average: 4.21.
	   Rank: 6.
	   Key fact: Brian Watts hit a spectacular bunker shot to set up a
tap-in par and force a four-hole playoff. Eventual winner Mark
O'Meara came to the 18th a second time leading by a stroke and
facing an easy two-putt for par. But he wasn't assured of his
second major title of the year until Watts, playing from almost the
same spot, hit his bunker shot over the top of the flag and
two-putted for bogey.

Graf wins again at Mahwah
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MAHWAH, New Jersey (AP) _ Showing flashes of the brilliance that
propelled her to 21 Grand Slam singles titles, Steffi Graf captured
her sixth A&AMP;P Tennis Classic championship Sunday by defeating
Amanda Coetzer, 6-3, 6-3.
	   Graf has won the annual exhibition tournament six of the seven
times she's participated, losing only to Kathy Rinaldi in the 1985
final. In the 21-year history of the event, no other player has won
it more than twice.
	   Winning the the A-and-P Classic, though it is only an exhibition
event, was a significant step in Graf's comeback from surgery on
her right knee in June of 1997.
	   ``I think I made the best out of these three days,'' she said.
``I couldn't expect to come here and win all three matches,
especially today. I haven't really felt so great in the heat
because I haven't really been in the heat for quite some time, but
it's a great way to start.''
	   Although Coetzer is only 4-10 lifetime against Graf on the WTA
Tour, three of those four wins came in 1997, including a victory at
the Australian Open when Graf was still ranked No. 1 and another at
the French Open. Graf is currently ranked 57th in the world while
Coetzer is ranked eighth.
	   Neither player was at their best in Sunday's error-filled final.
Still, despite oppressive heat and humidity which elevated the
on-court temperature to 94 degrees Farenheit (34.44 Celsius), Graf
continued to show signs of improvement.
	   Her backhand slice was her most effective weapon. She used it
repeatedly to work Coetzer's backhand, causing her to commit
several unforced errors.
	   Her biggest improvement was in her serve. After double faulting
six times in her three-set semifinal win over Fang Li Saturday,
Graf didn't have any double faults against Coetzer and registered
three aces. Coetzer, on the other hand, double faulted six times
and held serve only once in the second set and three times on the
day.
	   Although she is still battling a sinus infection, Graf, 29, won
almost every long rally and showed good agility in running down
several solid Coetzer forehands, reminding more than a few of the
Graf of old.
	   ``At certain points I saw a lot of it,'' Coetzer said. ``Both of
us made a lot of errors and we both have to clean that up going
into the next few tournaments. But I was impressed with the way she
moved. I think she moved very well and she's starting to serve
better and better.''
	   In preparation for the U.S. Open, which begins Aug. 31, Graf
plans to play tournaments at Stanford Univerity, San Diego and
Montreal. She's skipping the Germany's Federation Cup match against
Russia next week in Moscow to make sure she's ready for the Open
because she felt she didn't get in enough tournaments before she
played Wimbledon earlier this month.
	   If she continues to progess as she has, Graf feels there's no
reason she shouldn't be factor in Flushing.
	   ``No question about it,'' she said. ``That's why I decided to
come here really early. I'll be here all the way through the U.S.
Open. Next week would have been the Federation Cup and I decided to
stay here and continue to play tournaments because I felt that if I
want to really be a threat at the open I really need to start
playing tournaments and get accustomed to playing matches.''

 &UR; San Diego Padres 7, Cincinnati Reds 6

<TEXT>
	   CINCINNATI (AP) _ Greg Vaughn hit his fourth homer of the series
and Tony Gwynn broke an eighth-inning tie with a sacrifice fly as
the San Diego Padres beat the Cincinnati Reds 7-6 Sunday to
complete a three-game sweep.
	   San Diego blew a 6-0 lead set up by Vaughn's 34th homer of the
season before rallying against John Hudek (2-5), who let the Padres
load the bases on a pair of walks and second baseman Bret Boone's
error. Gwynn drove in his second run of the game with a fly out.
	   Donne Wall (3-2) got the win despite allowing Barry Larkin's
tying RBI single in the seventh, and Trevor Hoffman pitched the
ninth to remain perfect in 30 save opportunities this season.
	   The Padres took 11 of 12 from the Reds this season, matching
their best one-year record against another team. San Diego has won
five straight overall to open a double-digit lead in the NL West.
	   Cincinnati took a 10-game winning streak into the series but
wound up getting swept by San Diego for a third straight series. It
was San Diego's first three-game sweep in Cincinnati since
September 1990.
 &UR; Atlanta Braves 11, Milwaukee Brewers 6
	   Atlanta scored in each of the first six innings at home, getting
homers from Tony Graffanino and Curtis Pride.
	   John Smoltz (8-2) benefited from the offensive support, allowing
two earned runs in seven innings as Milwaukee lost for the seventh
time in its last eight road games.
	   The Braves, who have won five of six, built an 11-3 lead before
the fourth Milwaukee pitcher, David Weathers, got through the
seventh without allowing a run.
	   Graffanino snapped an 8-for-56 slump by going 4-for-4 _ a career
high for hits _ with a walk. He hit his third homer of the season
in the sixth and had two RBIs.
	   Milwaukee starter Jeff Juden (7-9) lasted only three innings.
 &UR; Piitsburgh Pirates 6, Montreal Expos 1
	   At Montreal, Chris Peters pitched seven strong innings, Tony
Womack got three hits and stole his National League-leading 36th
base and Pittsburgh won its third straight.
	   The Pirates stole a season-high five bases, with Jason Kendall
stealing home on the back end of a double steal.
	   Peters (4-7) allowed five hits, struck out five and walked one
in his longest outing of the season. Mark Grudzielanek homered
leading off the seventh to spoil Peters' shutout bid.
	   Dustin Hermanson (7-8) allowed three runs and seven hits in five
innings.
 &UR; Philadelphia Phillies 7, New York Mets 6, 10 innings
	   At New York, Mike Lieberthal singled for his fourth hit and
scored on Ruben Amaro's double in the 10th.
	   The Phillies, shut out the previous two days by the Mets, won
for the ninth time in 13 games. New York lost its sixth straight
extra-inning game after winning its first three of the season.
	   Philadelphia overcame a 5-2 deficit, then gave up the tying run
in the ninth before completing its 28th comeback win of the season.
	   Mark Leiter (3-2) struck out Mike Piazza with runners on first
and third to end the game.
	   Lieberthal, who tied a career high for hits, singled off Dennis
Cook (4-3) to start the 10th. Bobby Abreu sacrificed and Amaro
doubled to the base of the left-field wall.

<TEXT>
	   HAMBURG, Germany (AP) _ Unruffled by a raucous crowd, Jonas
Bjorkman picked up right where he left off last year in the Davis
Cup.
	   He beat Nicolas Kiefer in five sets Sunday to send defending
champion Sweden past Germany and into the semifinals of the Davis
Cup.
	   In another quarterfinal, Spain ousted Switzerland and will play
the Swedes in one semifinal. The United States and Italy will meet
in the other. Both semifinals are Sept. 25-27.
	   Bjorkman won 6-3, 4-6, 6-2, 5-7, 6-4 to give Sweden a 3-1 lead
in the first of two matches, with a crowd of 10,200 jeering every
call that went against the German.
	   ``I had doubts a lot of times I would win,'' Bjorkman said. ``I
didn't play well, but I never gave up.''
	   Kiefer failed twice to break Bjorkman at 4-4 in the final set,
then was broken on his next serve to end a wild match.
	   ``Bjorkman's hard to beat, but Kiefer had his chances,'' German
captain Carl-Uwe Steeb said.
	   In a final singles reduced to three sets, Germany's Tommy Haas
defeated Magnus Larsson 6-7 (4-7), 7-5, 6-2.
	   Bjorkman, ranked No. 9 in the world, won three singles and went
undefeated in doubles in Sweden's title run last year.
	   One of the world's top doubles players, Bjorkman teamed with
Nicklas Kulti on Saturday to give Sweden a 2-1 lead by beating
Boris Becker and David Prinosil.
	   __ &QC; 
 &UR; United States 4, Belgium 1 &QC; 
	   INDIANAPOLIS _ The United States won on its home soil for the
18th consecutive time and will play Italy in the semifinals on
September 25-27. The tie will be in the United States at a site to
be determined.
	   Todd Martin spoiled Xavier Malisse's 18th birthday Sunday but
Belgium avoided a sweep when Jim Courier retired with an arm
injury.
	   Courier was leading Christophe Van Garsse, 6-3, 1-4, when he
left the court. In Sunday's opening match at the Indianapoils
Tennis Center, Martin beat Malisse, 7-6 (7-1), 6-3.
	   Sunday's matches were reduced to best-of-three sets since the
Americans had clinched by winning the opening three matches.
	   Belgium made a switch with 18-year-old Malisse making his Davis
Cup singles debut as a replacement for Dewulf.
	   Court temperatures in the 90's (30's) with high humidity created
difficult playing conditions.
	   ___ &QC; 
 &UR; Spain 4, Switzerland 1 &QC; 
	   At La Coruna, Spain, Carlos Moya, the world's No. 4 player, won
Spain a place in the semifinals for the first time in 11 years by
downing Marc Rosset 7-5, 6-1, 7-5. Alex Corretja finished off a 4-1
victory by beating George Bastl 6-0, 7-5.
 &UR; Italy 5, Zimbabwe 0
	   At Prato, Italy, Davide Sanguinetti topped Zimbabwe's Wayne
Black 6-4, 3-6, 6-1 and Diego Nargiso powered past Zimbabwe's
Genius Chidzikwo 6-0, 6-2 to give Italy a sweep on clay courts.

Dismissed junior cabinet minister vows to sue
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ST. GEORGE'S, Grenada (AP) _ An opposition politician who was
fired from his junior cabinet post last year is vowing to sue the
government for wrongful dismissal.
	   Clarence Rapier, a parliament member representing the Grenada
United Labor Party, said he wants Prime Minister Keith Mitchell to
compensate him for lost wages after he was fired from his post as
junior minister of cooperatives.
	   Rapier had helped give Mitchell's New National Party a 9-6
majority by joining the administration. Mitchell fired him only
weeks after the switch, claiming Rapier had fought in public with
the foreign owner of an inn. Rapier claims the man's dog had
attacked him.
	   Rapier was acquitted of disorderly behavior and unlawful conduct
charges.
	   ``The time has come where the government should either
compensate him fully for unlawful dismissal or force us to take the
necessary action to secure remuneration for the time that he has
been unemployed,'' his lawyer, Anslem Clouden said Sunday.

	   DAYTON, Ohio (AP) _ Apollo 13 commander James Lovell, whose book
on the doomed space flight formed the basis for the film starring
Tom Hanks as Lovell, was inducted into the National Aviation Hall
of Fame.
	   Lovell, 70, returned to Dayton for the honor Saturday. The
veteran astronaut was selected early in the space program for
training at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton but wasn't
chosen as one of America's first seven astronauts.
	   ``Now, no longer disappointment here in Dayton,'' Lovell said at
the 37th annual induction ceremonies.
	   Lovell eventually made four missions as an astronaut, including
the first orbit of the moon aboard Apollo 8 and the perilous Apollo
13 moon shot. The flight had to aborted because of a possibly
life-threatening malfunction, but the crew managed to return
safely.
	   ``Apollo 13'' was based on Lovell's book, ``The Lost Moon.''
	   The other inductees were jet-engine pioneer Sam Williams,
aviation medicine leader Maj. Gen. Harry G. Armstrong and Maj.
Raoul Gervais Lufbery, America's first aerial ace in World War I.
	   Williams, 77, the only other living inductee, attended the
awards dinner.
	   The aviation hall was founded in Dayton in 1962 and later
established by Congress. The 150-plus inductees include the Wright
brothers, Charles Lindbergh, Neil Armstrong and Amelia Earhart.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Steven Spielberg took a page from Oliver Stone,
questioning authority and depicting the horrors of war in his World
War II drama, ``Saving Private Ryan.''
	   Starring Tom Hanks and Matt Damon, the film follows a team of
soldiers trying to extricate one enlisted man from action after all
his other brothers die in combat. For Spielberg, the seemingly
straightforward humanitarian mission raised broader concerns.
	   ``The moral question at the heart of the story. Why do we send
eight boys on a mission to save one, simply because that one lost
all of his brothers within 48 hours of each other?'' Spielberg asks
in Sunday's Daily News. ``Is this a ... Washington public relations
mission?''
	   The critically acclaimed film bothered some with its sometimes
grisly depictions of combat during and after the famed D-Day
invasion of German-occupied France, including showing Americans
guilty of wartime atrocities.
	   ``I'm only holding a mirror up to what really took place.''
Spielberg said. ``There are soldiers today, in their 80s, who
candidly come out and talk about shooting prisoners. It's something
that happened, and I just wanted to show it the way it actually
happened.
	   ``I don't want to turn Americans away from the patriotism many
of us feel, but in the process of the chaos of combat, these were
some of the things men were driven to do.''
	   Spielberg said a lot of WWII veterans he interviewed told him
traditional Hollywood war movies glossed over the horrors of
combat, while they praised the realism of Stone's ``Platoon.''
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Dennis Quaid couldn't say no to playing the
divorced father in the remake of ``The Parent Trap.''
	   ``Every woman I know insisted,'' Quaid says in the August issue
of Cosmopolitan. The husband of Meg Ryan said his wife was first on
the list.
	   ``Meg was like, `You have to do it,''' he said.
	   Doing the updated version of the 1961 classic, in which two
long-separated twins (Hayley Mills in a dual role) meet
accidentally and try to get their parents back together, agreed
with Quaid for personal reasons too.
	   ``It was one of my favorite movies as a kid,'' Quaid said. ``I
had a huge crush on the star, Hayley Mills.''
	   Quaid's many film credits include ``Breaking Away,'' ``The Right
Stuff,'' ``The Big Easy,'' ``Great Balls of Fire'' and ``Wyatt
Earp.''
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Hip-hop fans thought maybe Queen Latifah was
making a personal statement about her sexuality in her new song
``Get Off Minez,'' which features raw, explicit _ and ambiguous _
lyrics.
	   ``Coming out? Of the closet?'' the rapper-actress whose real
name is Dana Owens says in the August issue of The Source magazine.
``The funny thing is, I don't really (care) what people think about
my sexuality. There was a time when I wasn't dating a guy, I wasn't
dating anybody at the time. And people started those rumors about
me being gay, and I felt like I had to go get a boyfriend.''
	   Latifah made her rap debut in 1989 with ``All Hail to the
Queen'' and won a Grammy in 1993 for her song ``U.N.I.T.Y.'' As an
actress, she has co-starred for five years on the TV sitcom
``Living Single'' and played a lesbian character in the film ``Set
It Off.''
	   ``I don't have any problems with my sexuality, whatever you
wanna think I am,'' Latifah said. ``I'll never answer the question.
I'd rather have you die wanting to know.''
	   Besides, she said, she's too straightforward to use ``Get Off
Minez'' as a veiled sexual announcement. ``If I wanted to come out
... why wouldn't I just say it?'' Latifah said.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb police claim to have prevailed
in a seesaw battle over the weekend for control of the central
Kosovo town of Orahovac, but independent reports said the fighting
was still raging.
	   Neither Serb authorities nor the ethnic Albanians fighting them
release reliable updated casualty counts. But figures provided by
the two sides indicated more than 100 people died in fighting in
Orahovac and a series of violent border clashes on Saturday and
Sunday.
	   The reports would make battles among the deadliest in nearly
five months of fighting.
	   Hundreds of refugees streamed into hills in the Orahovac area
Sunday, about 50 kilometers (30 miles) southwest of the provincial
capital Pristina, in a desperate attempt to stay out of harm's way.
	   The pro-government Serb Media Center in Pristina said that at
least 20 ethnic Albanian rebel fighters were killed early Sunday
when a few hundred tried to cross the Albanian-Yugoslav border
northwest of Djakovica, the scene of an even bigger attempted
incursion on Saturday.
	   Ethnic Albanians, who outnumber Serbs 9-to-1 in Kosovo, are
demanding independence from Serbia, which makes up most of
present-day Yugoslavia. The rebel Kosovo Liberation Army now
controls about 30 percent of Kosovo.
	   Both sides claimed Sunday they controlled most of Orahovac.
However, explosions and machine-gun fire echoed throughout
surrounding hills and several buildings burned intensely. Orahovac,
with a normal population of 20,000, is the largest town yet caught
in the five-month ethnic conflict.
	   Reporters on the scene said it wasn't clear if either force
controlled the town amid the house-to-house fighting and shelling.
	   The Serb Media Center said police captured most of the town
early Sunday.
	   An ethnic Albanian guerrilla commander claimed earlier he was
using heavy weapons, including rocket launchers and vehicle-mounted
machine guns, to fight a siege by hundreds of police on Orahovac.
	   He said the larger weapons were needed as the fighting spreads
from the countryside into urban areas. ``This is the beginning of
this type of war which will end up in Pristina,'' he told APTV.
	   Reporters with the guerrillas could see anti-aircraft guns,
heavy machine-guns and smaller arms.
	   The commander claimed his forces killed at least 30 Serb
policemen and captured almost all of Orahovac in an offensive that
began late Friday.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, linked to moderate ethnic
Albanian leaders, said two civilians were killed and four were
wounded in the Orahovac area. Two teen-agers died in two nearby
villages.
	   On Saturday, the Yugoslav army said some 1,000 ``terrorists''
tried to cross from Albania into Kosovo. The attack was foiled and
about 30 guerrillas were ``liquidated.''
	   In the same area, at least 20 KLA fighters were killed early
Sunday when several groups of Albanians tried to cross into
Yugoslavia.
	   In another border clash, Yugoslav forces on Saturday fired
across the border into Albania to disrupt the guerrillas'
gun-smuggling network. Albanian border guards reported seeing the
bodies of dead and wounded victims but gave no casualty count.
	   Claiming two Serb mortar rounds landed in Albanian territory,
the Albanian government issued a stern protest to the Yugoslavs.
Conversely, the Yugoslav government protested what it called a
series of serious attempted rebel incursions across the border.

Mercury poisoning still haunts Japanese city

	   MINAMATA, Japan (AP) _ Fading sunlight reddens the fumes
billowing from the smokestacks at the sprawling Chisso chemical
plant, the city's biggest employer and, to some, its worst
affliction.
	   In 1932, Chisso Co. began using Minamata's cobalt-blue bay as a
dumping ground for organic mercury waste. The result was the worst
case of industrial pollution Japan has ever known _ thousands of
people were poisoned and crippled and hundreds died.
	   A 26-year ban on fishing in the bay was lifted earlier this
year, after the government declared the bay free of mercury.
	   Chisso, however, still dominates the town. And so does the
stigma and pain it created.
	   Residents, healthy or not, are shunned by outsiders, and once
proud fishing villages are dying. Jobs are scarce. First- and
second-generation victims of the poisoning continue to suffer.
	   ``The sea was our mother,'' said Tsuginori Hamamoto, a victim of
the disease and former fisherman. ``The children can't survive when
the mother dies.''
	   Before the Chisso disaster, Minamata was a solid, if not
affluent, city on the shores of Japan's southern island of Kyushu.
Its natural beauty is striking. Hills are draped in forests of pine
and dotted with palm trees; the surrounding sea is a breathtaking
expanse of blue.
	   But dead fish began littering the scenic waters in the 1950s.
	   Before long, residents who ate the fish displayed numbness,
tunnel vision, slurred speech, spasms. Many suffered violent
convulsions _ a strange dance of death _ before going mad and
dying.
	   ``Minamata disease'' lived on to curse another generation.
Children of victims were born with severe mental retardation.
	   All told, thousands were afflicted and more than 900 died. As of
April 1997, more than 17,000 people had applied to the government
to be certified as Minamata victims; 12,615 have been officially
recognized.
	   ``If the same thing happened again, people would be able to sue
not only for physical damage, but for the psychological pain that
was inflicted,'' said Dr. Hiroyuki Moriyama, director of a clinic
that cares for bedridden Minamata victims.
	   But times were different then.
	   Chisso knew mercury was causing the disease as early as 1956.
Its own company doctor made the discovery testing waste water on
cats. Executives ordered the cats destroyed and continued to pump
out mercury waste.
	   The pollution didn't stop until 1968, when the national
government _ slow to rule against a major corporation _ officially
recognized that Chisso had caused the environmental disaster.
	   By then, the town was torn apart.
	   Locked in a decades-long battle for compensation, victims of the
poisoning were accused by their own townspeople of the same vice
that had caused Chisso to dump mercury: greed. They got hate mail,
and were called ``roaches'' and ``freaks.''
	   Chisso was first ordered to make a one-time ``consolation''
payment of 18 million yen (about dlrs 130,000) to certified victims
as of 1973.
	   But the battle for compensation dragged on. In 1996, the
government instructed Chisso to pay an additional 25.8 billion yen
(dlrs 184 million) to 10,353 previously unrecognized victims.
	   Chisso spokesman Masaaki Kuboki said the company is complying
with its responsibilities to victims.
	   But Minamata's scars are unhealed.
	   Businesses were scared away by the disaster, triggering an
exodus from the city, whose population has dwindled from 50,000 in
the 1950s to a little over 32,000 today. Jobs are scarce, and per
capita income has lagged the national average by 20 percent to 30
percent for two decades.
	   The fishing industry has been hit especially hard.
	   In the village of Modo, Jinichi Hamatsuki, an 83-year-old
Minamata disease victim, recalled scavenging for sweet potatoes to
survive after the bay was closed to fishing. He went as far as
China to find work on fishing boats.
	   Many fishermen turned to tangerine farming. Others, sapped of
the will to start again, became dependent on welfare.
	   Hamatsuki believes the fishing days of towns like this are gone
forever. ``The young people don't even know how to dock a boat,''
he scoffed while untangling ropes on his rickety boat rocking by
the docks.
	   What Minamata's youths do know is that they are tarred with the
same stigma as their elders.
	   ``Every year from the time we're five, they teach us about
Minamata disease in school,'' said 18-year-old high-school student
Taisuke Matsumoto. ``It's enough!''
	   Escaping Minamata isn't easy.
	   A clothing shop owner, Koichi Hara, 39, moved to Osaka as a boy
to escape the oppressive atmosphere of Minamata. What he found
there was worse: constant bullying and physical assaults by
schoolmates who would mimic the jerky movements of Minamata disease
sufferers.
	   ``I came back to Minamata because of the discrimination I
faced,'' Hara said.
	   He said the city is divided between those who want the world to
remember their tragedy so other disasters might be avoided and
those who just want to move on with their lives.
	   ``There's a silent majority that would like everybody to stop
talking about Minamata disease,'' he said. ``The city is dark
enough as it is.''

Smart and charming, Ugandan leader brings stability, more openness

	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ When Yoweri Kaguta Museveni promised
Ugandans responsible and accountable leadership 12 years ago, they
had little reason to believe the new president.
	   Today, Uganda's longest-serving leader is convinced he has
delivered on his promise.
	   A former guerrilla, the 54-year-old Museveni has combined a
Marxist education, pan-African ideology and capitalist pragmatism
to lead Uganda to unprecedented stability after decades of
political upheaval, civil war and governmental mismanagement.
	   Still one of the poorest countries on the continent, Uganda
boasts the fastest-growing economy in Africa, an improved human
rights record and an independent press.
	   The government is privatizing state-owned enterprises and
channeling the proceeds into development projects. Donor aid goes
toward road construction and health services.
	   Critics note Uganda is still a one-party state, ruled now by
Museveni's National Resistance Movement. But that may change next
year when Ugandans vote in a referendum on whether to allow
political parties.
	   Falling back on his Marxist vocabulary, Museveni said in an
interview that Uganda's ``no-party democracy'' is a part of the
``progressive changes'' that have brought stability.
	   ``These changes that we started are moving the continent
forward, not backward,'' he said.
	   Religious leaders and political opponents have criticized
Museveni for failing to end insurgencies in northern and western
Uganda. Although he has refused to negotiate with rebels, Museveni
said he would not stand in the way of someone else doing it.
	   Unlike most of his predecessors who were highly suspicious
authoritarians or outright dictators, Museveni is relaxed,
confident and charming and gives his presidency a human touch.
	   Accounts of his easy rapport with his fellow Ugandans underscore
his popularity.
	   When his helicopter was forced to land outside Kampala recently
because of mechanical problems, Museveni hailed a passing taxi and
told the dumbfounded driver to drop him off at State House, the
presidential office.
	   While campaigning for the 1996 presidential election, Museveni
often wore his trademark, floppy green bush hat _ a sign, he said,
that he has a sense of humor.
	   Museveni grew up on a farm in southwestern Uganda and is so fond
of his 1,500 head of long-horned Ankole cattle that he keeps
pictures of his favorites _ along with his four children _ in his
wallet.
	   For Museveni, cattle raising is more than a hobby. When he
talked farming with Bill Clinton during the American president's
March visit, he discussed the culture of survival in Africa through
self-reliance _ the central theme of his ideology.
	   ``Genetic makeup of Africans is very strong. That's how we
managed to survive,'' Museveni said in an interview.
	   To prove his point, last year he was responsible for starting
production of a toothpaste made from a local grass that people in
his Ankole region use to clean their teeth. Ugandans dubbed the
Nile brand product the ``presidential'' toothpaste.
	   And he says what he thinks.
	   Although Uganda is heavily dependent on outside aid, Museveni
told Harvard economist Jeffrey Sachs _ the guru of economic
liberalization and globalization _ that many of his ideas about
sub-Saharan Africa are ``rubbish and nonsense.''
	   He also likes to tease people who might take him too seriously.
During a recent interview, he tweaked an American environmental
reporter for wanting to ask all the questions and not letting
Museveni ask any of his own.
	   Such a relaxed approach was not the way for Ugandan leaders
before Museveni _ a time when a dusk-to-dawn curfew, military
checkpoints and strict obedience to authority were the rule.
	   Museveni's rebels won power in 1986 after a five-year guerrilla
war, ending two decades of oppressive rule by Milton Obote and Idi
Amin Dada.
	   Since then, Museveni has emerged as one of Africa's most
articulate spokesmen and is often compared to South African
President Nelson Mandela.
	   Both are seen as visionaries whose ideas of political
independence, pan-African solidarity and self-reliance are
influencing thinking beyond their own countries.
	   In neighboring Rwanda, Rwandan exiles who had served in
Museveni's rebel army seized power in July 1994, ending the
slaughter of more than a half million people.
	   Two years later, the governments of Uganda and Rwanda helped
rebels topple dictator Mobutu Sese Seko in Zaire, now known as
Congo.

Cypriot government protests arrival of Turkish warships, planes

	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ The Cypriot government accused Turkey of
``threatening peace'' by sending six warships and an aerobatics
squadron to the Turkish-occupied north of the island a day before
the 24th anniversary of the invasion of Northern Cyprus by Turkish
troops.
	   The air and naval units arrived to take part in celebrations
that mark the anniversary of Turkey's 1974 invasion after a coup by
Greek Cypriot supporters of union with Greece.
	   Monday's celebrations in north Cyprus will feature a visit by
Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz and a show of precision flying
by seven jets of the Turkish air force.
	   The anniversary is getting more attention this year because of
increased tension over the Greek Cypriots' decision to buy S-300
anti-aircraft missiles from Russia. Turkey has vowed to act to stop
their deployment, saying the missiles threaten its security. Greece
has warned it would respond to any attack on Cyprus.
	   The latest peace talks between the two sides collapsed in August
1997 when Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash insisted that Cyprus
abandon its bid to join the European Union and recognize the
Turkish Cypriot government.
	   Cypriot Defense Minister Yiannakis Omirou criticized the Turkish
deployment, saying: ``The international community must realize
after this latest Turkish display who is threatening peace and who
is the troublemaker in the region.''
	   In his annual address on the eve of the anniversary, Cypriot
President Glafcos Clerides appealed to the permanent members of the
U.N. Security Council ``to adopt a more decisive and coordinated
approach'' toward Turkey.
	   On the other side of the demilitarized zone that divides Cyprus,
Denktash reminded his community of the years before the invasion,
when the Turkish minority suffered discrimination from the Greek
Cypriot majority and there was inter-factional fighting and ethnic
cleansing.
	   ``In the 1963-1974 period, the Greek Cypriot knife was held to
our throat. We held our heads high. We trusted (Turkey) and we
won,'' Denktash told the local Bayrak radio.
	   A breakaway Turkish Cypriot state, which Denktash heads, is
recognized only by Ankara, which maintains 35,000 troops there.
	   Greek Cypriots began marking the anniversary Sunday with
memorial church services for the more than 5,000 Greek Cypriots who
were killed or disappeared during the invasion.
	   Organizations representing the 180,000 Greek Cypriot refugees
from the north plan to mount a series of demonstrations Monday
along the U.N.-patrolled buffer zone.

Israel and Palestinians announce set of talks to end stalemate

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ Trying to breathe new life into the
withering peace process, senior Israeli and Palestinian negotiators
have agreed to a round of talks aimed at ending 16-months of
stalemate.
	   Sunday's meeting between Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai and Yasser Arafat's deputy Mahmoud Abbas did not yield a
breakthrough. But after three hours, both men sounded determined to
go forward and set up teams to tackle issues blocking a long
overdue Israeli troop withdrawal from the West Bank. More talks
were scheduled Monday.
	   An aide to Mordechai said both U.S. peace envoy Dennis Ross and
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had been briefed by phone
immediately after the meeting.
	   ``We have discussed all the outstanding issues, dealt with them
from all their aspects and we will follow up in order to hear more
ideas, hoping that such an endeavor will lead to a bridging of the
sides,'' Abbas said after the meeting at a Tel Aviv hotel.
	   ``We decided in the coming days to concentrate on the main
issues, and to look for solutions to bridge the gaps with the idea
of moving forward the agreements between the sides,'' Mordechai
said.
	   The meeting came at the behest of the United States, which
called on the sides to negotiate directly after the American
administration failed to resolve differences over an initiative
calling for Israel to withdraw from another 13 percent of the West
Bank.
	   The Palestinians currently have full or partial control over 27
percent of the territory.
	   After months of mediation, the United States presdented a
proposal in January calling for Israel to carry out a promised West
Bank pullback, while the Palestinians would make greater efforts to
fight terrorism.
	   Arafat accepted the plan, but Netanyahu has balked, citing
security concerns. Hours before Sunday's talks, the Israeli leader
reiterated those concerns after police said they a Palestinian man
had attempted a car bombing in the center of Jerusalem.
	   With tensions high following the bombing reports, both sides had
said expectations were low for a breakthrough. Palestinian Cabinet
minister Nabil Shaath said he thought the meeting had only a
``very, very limited chance'' of success.
	   Netanyahu said Israel was coming to the talks with ``an open
mind and a desire to achieve an agreement.''
	   ``I call on the Palestinian Authority to engage with us
continually, day and night, in negotiations, including at the
highest levels,'' he said. The prime minister told reporters he did
not rule out a meeting later with Arafat.
	   Netanyahu has said a deal was within reach if the Palestinians
met several key Israeli demands, including disarming militants,
reducing the size of its police force and removing sections of the
PLO covenant which call for Israel's destruction.
	   The meeting seemed to start off well with Mordechai and Abbas
shaking hands in front of cameras, then meeting one-on-one before
bringing in aides.
	   After the meeting, Palestinian security chief Mohammed Dahlan
complained that the Israeli delegation had refused to discuss the
U.S. plan. ``Whenever the Palestinians brought up the U.S.
initiative, the Israelis would say `not yet,''' Dahlan told The
Associated Press. He said, however, that talks would continue
Monday in teams headed by Mordechai and Abbas.
	   Meanwhile, in Jerusalem, police went on high alert, setting up
road blocks at the entrances to the city and appealing for public
vigilance, after announcing an attempted car bombing in the city's
downtown had been thwarted
	   Police described the driver of the van as a known activist in
the militant Hamas group from the Al-Amari refugee camp outside the
West Bank town of Ramallah. He was arrested in the failed attack,
in which he suffered serious burns and remained under heavy guard
at a Jerusalem hospital. No one else was hurt.
	   Police said the bombing was prevented when an off-duty Jerusalem
policeman and a bus driver saw smoke coming from a white van with
front and back license plates that did not match. It was not clear
what started the fire inside the van, though police said they found
600 liters (160 gallons) of ``flammable fluid'' in plastic
containers. Also in the van were several kilograms (pounds) of
nails, which militants have rigged bombs with in the past to
increase the devastation caused by the explosion.
	   The attempted attack came as Israelis marked the one year
anniversary, according to the Jewish calender, of a bombing in the
city's main vegetable market claimed by Hamas which killed 16
people and two bombers.

	   LONG GROVE, Illinois (AP) _ Hale Irwin continued his assault on
the record books Saturday, shooting a 66 and taking an eight-stroke
lead after two rounds in the Ameritech Senior Open.
	   His 16-under 128 tied the record for 36 holes in relation to par
set by Irwin in last year's Vantage Championship. He also tied the
Senior PGA Tour record for largest lead, initially set by Arnold
Palmer in the 1984 Seniors Championship and tied three other times.
	   Irwin, the senior tour's money leader, set a course record with
a 10-under 62 Friday.
	   ``He's beating the tar out of all of us,'' said Bruce
Summerhays, who is at 8-under 136 after shooting a 68. ``It appears
we're all playing for second.''
	   Joining Summerhays at 136 was Larry Nelson, who shot a 67
Saturday. Tied at 137 were Ray Floyd (66), Leonard Thompson (68)
and Hugh Baiocchi (71).
	   Defending champion Gil Morgan had a rough day, shooting a 73
that left him 14 strokes back.
	   As in his record-setting first round, Irwin's strong short game
carried him Saturday. On the par-4 fourth, after putting his second
shot into a sand trap on the right of the green, he blasted out to
within six feet (1.83 meters) of the pin. He sank it for a birdie,
and then made another short birdie putt on No. 5.
	   He finished the front nine with two spectacular birdie putts. He
sank a 15-foot (4.57 meters), slightly uphill putt on the eighth.
On No. 9, his 18-footer (5.5-meter) from the fringe hit the back of
the cup and dropped in as the crowd roared.
	   After parring the 10th, Irwin took a little break. He headed
into the gallery and sat in an empty lawnchair, chatting with
spectators as he watched playing partners Baiocchi and Joe Inman
finish out the hole.
	   Irwin might have gotten a little too relaxed. He bogeyed the
par-3 13th _ his first of the tournament _ after his 10-foot
(3-meter) putt hit the right edge of the cup and skipped out.
	   Looking disgusted, Irwin tapped in for bogey, which left him at
14-under. He got the stroke back with a birdie on the next hole.
	   He birdied No. 18 for the second straight day, putting his
second shot five feet from the pin. The crowd cheered as he knocked
it in and Irwin tipped his baseball hat ass last 18 rounds. ... Don Bies (1989 Murata
Seniors Reunion), Isao Aoki (1998 BellSouth Senior Classic) and
Nelson (Pittsburgh Senior Classic) also share the record for
largest lead. Aoki also tied Irwin's record for 36 holes in
relation to par. ... Ameritech announced Saturday it will continue
sponsoring the Senior Open at Kemper Lakes Golf Club through 2001.
... Gary McCord, part of CBS' announcing crew, will make his senior
debut in next week's U.S. Senior Open at Riviera. ... Kemper Lakes
pro Emil Esposito finished in last place with a 26-over 242.

Steady O'Meara wins British Open
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; AP Golf Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SOUTHPORT, England (AP) _ Not even best in his own neighborhood
to start the year, Mark O'Meara is now the champion of golf.
	   He basked in suddenly sunny skies on the 18th green of Royal
Birkdale on Sunday, the claret jug in his hand and a green jacket
in his closet back home in Florida.
	   For 18 years, his steady, grinding play was good enough for 14
victories on the PGA Tour, but never a mention as one of the game's
elite players.
	   O'Meara changed that by winning the British Open in a playoff
over Brian Watts, raising his arms in defiant triumph just like he
had done three months earlier at Augusta National.
	   ``It's just an incredible feeling to have won two major
championships in a year,'' O'Meara said. ``If I could put my finger
on it, I'd have done it earlier in my career. It's just not that
easy.''
	   On a day of heroics and miracle shots, when Birkdale demanded a
little more than 72 holes of even par, O'Meara drew from his steely
nerves to become the first player since Nick Faldo in 1990 to win
the Masters and the British Open in the same year.
	   ``I use past experience to my advantage,'' said O'Meara, who
closed with a 2-under 68 and beat Watts by two strokes in the
four-hole playoff. ``Even though I'm nervous, more times than not
I've been able to finish off the deal.''
	   At 41, O'Meara became the oldest player to win two majors in the
same year. Jack Nicklaus (1980), Ben Hogan (1953) and Craig Wood
(1941) were all 40 when they won two majors.
	   O'Meara and Watts, a 32-year-old American who plays on the
Japanese tour, both finished at 280, the first time even par has
won the Open since Greg Norman in 1986 at Turnberry.
	   Tiger Woods roared from behind with birdies on three of the last
four holes and narrowly missed the playoff. He closed with a 66,
tied with Scotland's Raymond Russell for the best round of the day,
to finish at 281.
	   Russell, Jim Furyk, Jesper Parnevik and the 17-year-old amateur
Justin Rose of England were at 282.
	   ``Of all the championships in the world, this in my opinion is
the most special,'' O'Meara said.
	   He won it with the steady play that has marked his career, in
the face of one dramatic finish after another on a breezy day at
Birkdale.
	   First came Woods, pumping his fist in rapid-fire succession with
each of his three birdies over the final four holes. Needing a
birdie on No. 18 to tie for the lead at 1 over, he rammed home a
30-footer (9-meters) and let out a roar.
	   ``Unfortunately, it wasn't good enough,'' Woods said after his
best finish in a major since he won the Masters last year.
	   Then came Rose, his innocent smile as sweet as the name implies.
Impervious to the pressure of being an amateur mixing it up with
best in the world, he holed a wedge on No. 18 from 45 yards (41
meters) away in the nasty rough for a 69 that put him at 2-over
282.
	   He raised his hands and smiled into the heavens, soaking in a
performance that captivated a country.
	   ``To finish like that was unexplainable,'' said Rose, who posted
the highest finish in the Open by an amateur since Frank Stranahan
tied for second four strokes behind Hogan at Carnoustie in 1953.
	   ``It's just one of those magic moments.''
	   But there was one more piece of magic left at Birkdale.
	   O'Meara broke the 1-over tie with Woods by making a 15-foot
(4.5-meter) birdie putt on the 17th. One group behind, Watts
dropped a 12-footer (3.5-meters) for birdie to join him.
	   But Watts' drive on the 18th found the clumpy rough left of the
fairway, and his approach took one last hop into the bunker,
stopping on the down-slope of the sand _ no guarantee he would even
be able to knock it on the green.
	   Digging in the sand with his left foot, his right foot flexed at
an angle on the grass above, Watts took the club back twice,
hovered over the ball and then blasted out.
	   With O'Meara watching from behind the green, the ball hopped
slightly to the right and rolled to within a foot (30 cms) of the
cup for a tap-in par, setting the table for even more drama.
	   The playoff was the first since John Daly beat Costantino Rocca
at St. Andrews in 1995 to begin a four-year stretch of American
dominance across the Atlantic.
	   Watts, however, wasn't up to the task.
	   He missed a 3-foot (1 meter) birdie putt on the par-5 15th,
missed another birdie putt from 12 feet (3.5 meters) on the next
hole and only stayed in the game by saving par on the 17th with a
10-foot (3-meter) putt.
	   O'Meara never wavered, expressionless as he walked down the
fairway. He birdied the 15th from 5 feet (1.5 meters) and made
two-putt pars the rest of the way.
	   Watts' last hope was to hole a bunker shot at No. 18, but he
shook his head as soon as the ball emerged from a splash of sand
and scurried 20 feet (6 meters) past the hole.
	   Watts two-putted for bogey, his first on any of the last six
holes over the four rounds of the tournament.
	   ``I knew I had to hole the bunker shot to have any chance,''
Watts said. ``If you would have told me at the beginning of this
week that I'd be in position to win the Open championship, I
wouldn't have believed you.
	   ``I'm still proud of myself.''
	   O'Meara got dlrs 520,000 for the victory, his 23rd worldwide in
a career that is just now starting to blossom. Watts won dlrs
329,000 for second, which should be good enough to qualify for the
PGA Tour next year.
	   O'Meara won't play again until the PGA Championship next month
in Seattle. A win there would make him the first player to win
three majors in a year since Hogan won the Masters, U.S. Open and
British Open in 1953.
	   The odds against that are high. Just like they were four months
ago, when O'Meara was just another guy trying to make a living.

Five South Korean diplomats being asked to leave Russia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Five more South Korean diplomats are
being expelled from Russia in a worsening diplomatic squabble
triggered by spy charges, South Korean media reported Monday.
	   Quoting Russian intelligence sources, South Korean newspapers
reported from Moscow that the five _ two at Seoul's embassy in
Moscow and three at its consulate in Vladivostok _ have been asked
to leave Russia ``quietly.''
	   South Korea's Foreign Ministry neither confirmed nor denied the
reports.
	   South Korean media said Russia has identified the five as
``intelligence officials'' and demanded their removal without
officially declaring them persona non grata.
	   Acknowledging that it has two intelligence officials assigned to
its embassy in Seoul, Russia is asking Seoul to reciprocate by
limiting its intelligence agents in Russia to the same number, the
South Korean media said.
	   ``We hope that this will be the final step to end the dispute,''
the Chosun Ilbo, a major national daily, quoted one unidentified
Russian intelligence source as saying.
	   After expelling one diplomat each from the other's embassy
earlier this month, the two countries said they would try to
resolve the dispute quietly through negotiations, but those talks
apparently failed.
	   Russia earlier said that its foreign minister, Yevgeny Primakov,
would discuss the issue with his South Korean counterpart, Park
Chung-soo, during a meeting of the Asian Regional Forum, a security
meeting, to be held in Manila next Monday.
	   The diplomatic row began July 4 when Russia ordered the
expulsion of a South Korean diplomat, Cho Sung-woo, on spy charges.
Cho's alleged Russian contact, a senior Foreign Ministry official,
was arrested on treason charges.
	   Four days later, South Korea retaliated by ordering the
expulsion of a Russian diplomat in Seoul, Oleg N. Abramkin _ an
action Moscow said was unwarranted.
	   It was the most serious diplomatic dispute reported between
Moscow and Seoul since the former adversaries opened formal
diplomatic relations in 1990. Russia's predecessor, the former
Soviet Union, was a longtime ally of Seoul's rival, communist North
Korea.
	   Relations between Seoul and Moscow have warmed significantly in
the recent past, while ties between Moscow and Pyongyang have
cooled considerably.

New week, old problem
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Lead expected updating with day's stage about 1600 GMT &QL; 
 &UR; By SALVATORE ZANCA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MONTAUBAN, France (AP) _ The Tour de France began a new week
with an old problem _ drugs.
	   Shortly after the Festina team left amid a doping scandal that
has plagued the Tour even before it began, a new leader with drug
problems of his own took over.
	   Laurent Desbiens of France, who was suspended for six months in
1996 for steroid use, took the yellow jersey after the eighth stage
Sunday by being part of a small group that finished more than seven
minutes ahead of the main pack. The larger group included Jan
Ullrich, the defending champion who led following Saturday's time
trial.
	   Desbiens grabbed the lead a day after the Festina team
reluctantly pulled out of the race.
	   Festina's problems began when director Bruno Roussel was put
into police detention for questioning with the team doctor. Then
they were moved to Lille for further investigation.
	   Tour officials decided to throw the Festina team out of the
three-week race Friday after Roussel admitted a practice of
supplying illegal drugs with medical supervision to improve
performances.
	   The riders of the Festina team withdrew from the race Saturday
after first trying to defy the ban and race in Saturday's time
trial.
	   Roussel, team doctor Erik Ryckaert and team masseur Wily Voet
were still under police custody. Voet was jailed July 9 after
customs officials found a stash of performance-enhancing drugs in
Voet's car bearing Festina emblems.
	   The three are expected to appear in court on Friday.
	   Before that, the rest of the Festina team may be summoned by
police in Lille. Originally the investigation would have waited
until the Tour was over before hearing the riders.
	   Now it seems the riders have nothing to do the rest of July when
they were supposed to be in the Tour de France until Aug. 2.
	   Meanwhile, Jacky Durand of France won the eighth stage as he was
part of the group that included Desbiens in the day's leg from
Brive-La Gaillarde to Montauban, 190 kilometers (118 miles).
	   Durand won the final sprint over Andrea Tafi with two other
Italians, Fabio Sacchi and Eddy Mazzoleni third and fourth.
	   Desbiens was fifth.
	   The pack finished more than seven minutes behind Durand. That
was enough to let Desbians take the leader's yellow jersey from
Ullrich.
	   Temperatures reached above 40 C (104 F) on the road and the
major favorites in the pack let the small group escape without
risking much.
	   ``After 40 kilometers, I was tired already and I was giving
water to other members of the team just to help Hamburger,'' Durand
said. Bo Hamburger was second in the overall standings at the time
and Durand was trying to keep him in contention.
	   ``The pack was tired because of the heat and somehow I wound up
with more water than expected,'' Durand said. ``Maybe that's why I
won.''
	   The extreme heat allowed Tour officials to change regulations on
route to allow water to be brought to the riders more often than
usual.
	   Desbiens is not expected to hold onto to the lead in the
mountains. Desbiens ended up nearly four hours behind Ullrich in
last year's final standings, placing 127th.
	   Ullrich is now fifth, 3:21 behind but he still has large margins
over his major rivals.
	   Hamburger of Denmark is 1:18 behind Ullrich in sixth with
American Bobby Julich in seventh, in the same time as Hamburger.
	   Last year Ullrich made his first big move in the Pyrenees to
take control of the race for good, stretching his lead by minutes
over the final 12 days with the help of his German Telekom team.
	   Only the Festina team, led by Richard Virenque, was able to
challenge Ullrich and Telekom. Virenque was the only racer within
10 minutes of Ullrich in 1997.
	   But the Festina team is out of the Tour now, without any
positive tests and a person that had the positive test is in the
lead.

Moceanu wins overall gold in Goodwill gymnastics
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HAL BOCK &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNIONDALE, New York (AP) _ Last time, Dominique Moceanu's gold
medal was part of a team effort. This time, she earned gold all by
herself.
	   Moceanu, 7 inches (17 centimeters) taller than she was in
Atlanta when she won gold with the U.S. women's team, led from the
start Sunday, winning the all-around women's gymnnastics title at
the Goodwill Games.
	   She finished with a score of 38.662, well in front of Maria
Olaru of Romania with 37.975. Another Romanian, Simona Amanar, was
third with 37.850.
	   World champion Svetlana Khorkina of Russia finished a
disappointing seventh at 37.412 after a costly slip near the end of
the floor exercise, her final discipline.
	   Moceanu, who won't turn 17 until the end of September, took the
lead on the first rotation with a 9.625 on the uneven bars and was
comfortably ahead all night.
	   A crowd of 5,179 at the Nassau Coliseum watched the Houston
teenager put on a nearly flawless demonstration as she moved to the
balance beam, the floor exercise and finally the vault. First in
the rotation on the final discipline, she clinched the gold with
scores of 9.55 and 9.625 on her two attempts, then watched the
other 10 gymnasts complete their exercises.
	   It was a big win for Moceanu, who was the youngest U.S. gymnast
to win a gold when she was part of the ``Magnificent Seven''
women's team at Atlanta. She was just 4-feet-5 (1.35 meters) then,
and now stands a full 5 feet (1.52 meters) tall.
	   For Sierra Sapunar of Wyoming, Ohio, the toughest part of the
night came during warmups. As she practiced her first routine, the
vault, she tumbled heavily, landing on her knees.
	   She was bent over, in tears, as her coach and trainer rushed to
her side. Shaken by the fall, Sapunar scored a shaky 8.800 on her
first vault, the poorest score of the night on that discipline.
	   She recovered with a 9.225 on her second attempt but the average
9.012 still left her buried at the bottom of the standings, 10th of
the 11 competitors after the first apparatus. She spent the rest of
the night battling her way back up the standings and finished fifth
with 37.587.

 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CINCINNATI (AP) _ Greg Vaughn hit his fourth homer of the series
and Tony Gwynn broke an eighth-inning tie with a sacrifice fly as
the San Diego Padres beat the Cincinnati Reds 7-6 Sunday to
complete a three-game sweep.
	   San Diego blew a 6-0 lead set up by Vaughn's 34th homer of the
season before rallying against John Hudek (2-5), who let the Padres
load the bases on a pair of walks and second baseman Bret Boone's
error. Gwynn drove in his second run of the game with a fly out.
	   Donne Wall (3-2) got the win despite allowing Barry Larkin's
tying RBI single in the seventh, and Trevor Hoffman pitched the
ninth to remain perfect in 30 save opportunities this season.
	   The Padres took 11 of 12 from the Reds this season, matching
their best one-year record against another team. San Diego has won
five straight overall to open a double-digit lead in the NL West.
	   Cincinnati took a 10-game winning streak into the series but
wound up getting swept by San Diego for a third straight series. It
was San Diego's first three-game sweep in Cincinnati since
September 1990.
 &UR; Braves 11, Brewers 6 &QC; 
	   In Atlanta, the Braves scored in each of the first six innings,
getting homers from Tony Graffanino and Curtis Pride.
	   John Smoltz (8-2) benefited from the offensive support, allowing
two earned runs in seven innings as Milwaukee lost for the seventh
time in its last eight road games.
	   The Braves, who have won five of six, built an 11-3 lead before
the fourth Milwaukee pitcher, David Weathers, got through the
seventh without allowing a run.
	   Graffanino snapped an 8-for-56 slump by going 4-for-4 _ a career
high for hits _ with a walk. He hit his third homer of the season
in the sixth and had two RBIs.
	   Milwaukee starter Jeff Juden (7-9) lasted only three innings.
 &UR; Pirates 6, Expos 1 &QC; 
	   In Montreal, Chris Peters pitched seven strong innings, Tony
Womack got three hits and stole his NL-leading 36th base and
Pittsburgh won its third straight.
	   The Pirates stole a season-high five bases, with Jason Kendall
stealing home on the back end of a double steal.
	   Peters (4-7) allowed five hits, struck out five and walked one
in his longest outing of the season. Mark Grudzielanek homered
leading off the seventh to spoil Peters' shutout bid.
	   Dustin Hermanson (7-8) allowed three runs and seven hits in five
innings.
 &UR; Phillies 7, Mets 6, 10 innings &QC; 
	   In New York, Mike Lieberthal singled for his fourth hit and
scored on Ruben Amaro's double in the 10th.
	   The Phillies, shut out the previous two days by the Mets, won
for the ninth time in 13 games. New York lost its sixth straight
extra-inning game after winning its first three of the season.
	   Philadelphia overcame a 5-2 deficit, then gave up the tying run
in the ninth before completing its 28th comeback win of the season.
	   Mark Leiter (3-2) struck out Mike Piazza with runners on first
and third to end the game.
	   Lieberthal, who tied a career high for hits, singled off Dennis
Cook (4-3) to start the 10th. Bobby Abreu sacrificed and Amaro
doubled to the base of the left-field wall.
 &UR; Astros 4, Giants 3, 12 innings
	   In Houston, Derek Bell singled home the winning run off Robb Nen
in the 12th inning, giving the Houston Astros a three-game sweep of
the San Francisco Giants.
	   Bill Spiers doubled with one out in the 12th off Nen (6-2) and
Craig Biggio was intentionally walked before Ricky Gutierrez
walked. Bell, hitless in his four at-bats, then lined an 0-2 pitch
up the middle.
	   The Giants have lost four straight and eight of their last nine.
	   Doug Henry (5-2) pitched the 12th for his first win against his
former team. He pitched in 75 games for Houston last season.
	   Moises Alou went 3-for-5 with a three-run homer for the Astros.
Barry Bonds hit his 20th homer for the Giants.
 &UR; Cubs 7, Marlins 6, 12 innings
	   In Miami, the Chicago Cubs took advantage of Florida pitcher Rob
Stanifer's throwing error to score three runs in the top of the
12th inning, then held off the Marlins.
	   Tied at 4, Stanifer (0-3), the Marlins seventh pitcher, walked
Jose Hernandez and pinch-hitter Matt Mieske to begin the 12th.
	   Lance Johnson bunted and Stanifer threw wildly to third base,
and both runners scored when the ball bounced past left fielder
Cliff Floyd. Johnson reached third on the play and scored on Henry
Rodriguez's sacrifice fly.
	   The Marlins scored twice in the 12th against Rod Beck on RBI
singles by John Cangelosi and Floyd. But Beck got his 26th save,
striking out Craig Counsell and Gregg Zaun with runners on first
and second to end the game.
	   Terry Mulholland (3-2) pitched 1 1-3 scoreless innings for the
win.

	   TORONTO (AP) _ Jose Canseco hit two home runs, including a grand
slam, and Carlos Delgado hit the first ball into SkyDome's fifth
deck in right field as the Toronto Blue Jays slowed the New York
Yankees 9-3 Sunday.
	   The Blue Jays won twice in the three-game series. New York lost
a series for only the third time this season, and has now dropped
three of four games.
	   Canseco's sixth career slam gave the Blue Jays a 4-1 lead in the
third against Andy Pettitte (12-6), who lost for the first time
since May 31.
	   It was his Canseco's fourth multi-homer game of the season and
31st of his career.
	   Woody Williams (9-4) allowed three earned runs and six hits in 6
1-3 innings. He struck out three and walked five.
 &UR; Tigers 3, Red Sox 1 &QC; 
	   In Detroit, Damion Easley and Bobby Higginson each hit RBI
singles in the eighth inning to give Justin Thompson his second
straight home win.
	   Tied 1-1 in the eighth, Joe Randa hit a one-out single off Tom
Gordon (4-3) and took third on Brian Hunter's single. Easley and
Higginson then hit consecutive singles.
	   Thompson (9-8) struck out 10 in a seven-hitter, his fourth
complete game.
	   Luis Gonzalez homered for the Tigers, who took two of three from
the Red Sox.
	   Boston starter Bret Saberhagen pitched seven strong innings but
got his third straight no-decision.
 &UR; White Sox 8, Indians 1 &QC; 
	   In Chicago, Mike Sirotka pitched a four-hitter, slumping Frank
Thomas hit a three-run homer and Chicago capitalized on three
Cleveland errors.
	   Sirotka (9-9) retired 12 straight before Kenny Lofton singled
with one out in the ninth. He beat the Indians for the third time
this season while picking up his first victory since June 23 and
his fifth complete game.
	   Thomas, having his worst season since coming to the majors in
1990, was in a 1-for-16 skid when he lifted a pitch from Dave Burba
(10-8) over the fence in right-center for his 16th homer.
	   Burba, who has lost three straight, allowed nine hits and eight
runs in 5 2-3 innings.
 &UR; Royals 4, Mariners 1
	   In Seattle, Tim Belcher quieted the host Mariners' bats by
pitching seven strong innings, and the Kansas City Royals stopped
the Mariners' six-game winning streak.
	   The Mariners totaled 36 hits in beating Kansas City 18-5 and 8-5
the previous two days, but managed only four hits off Belcher.
	   Seattle lost its No. 1 catcher, Dan Wilson, who severely
sprained his left ankle chasing a passed ball in the third inning.
His ankle will be immobilized 7-10 days and then re-evaluated.
	   Wilson had a career-high six RBIs Friday night and hit three
home runs during the Mariners' 8-3 homestand.
	   Belcher (9-8), who helped the Mariners win the AL West in 1995,
gave up Alex Rodriguez's 30th home run in the first inning.
	   Jeff Montgomery pitched the ninth for his 22nd save. The
Mariners finished with five hits.
	   Jeff Fassero (9-6) had his four-game winning streak broken.
 &UR; Athletics 5, Twins 2
	   In Oakland, California, Matt Stairs hit two home runs, leading
Kenny Rogers and the host Athletics over the Minnesota Twins.
	   Stairs hit his 13th and 14th home runs, going 2-for-4 to improve
his average to .332, second only to Texas' Ivan Rodriguez in the
American League.
	   Rogers (10-3) gave up seven hits and allowed only one earned run
in his third complete game of the season.
	   Since a 1-0 loss at Los Angeles June 10, Rogers is 4-0 with a
2.06 ERA. He has not allowed more than two earned runs in eight of
his last nine starts, with a 1.56 ERA in that span.
	   Dan Serafini (3-3) held the A's hitless until Stairs homered
with one out in the fourth for a 1-0 lead. He led off the sixth his
14th home run of the season.

Report: Japan considering ending freeze on loans to Myanmar
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan is considering lifting a 10-year ban on loans
to Myanmar for humanitarian projects because the sanction has not
helped improve human rights in the country, a newspaper reported
Monday.
	   The change could come as early as this fall, said the Yomiuri,
Japan's largest newspaper, quoting unidentified government sources.
The move would leave intact, however, a ban on non-humanitarian
loans, the report said.
	   Officials at Japan's Foreign Ministry were unavailable for
comment.
	   Japan suspended the loans following the 1988 military crackdown
by the government of Myanmar, also known as Burma, on a
pro-democracy movement.
	   The report said the government was reconsidering the freeze
because it was seen as having been ineffective in ending human
rights abuses in Myanmar or helping bring about free elections.
	   Japan was now considering a two track approach of pressing the
Mynamar government to improve human rights and also helping improve
living standards by resuming loans, the Yomiuri quoted the sources
as saying.
	   Resuming such assistance could stir opposition from
pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi and Western nations, which
want tougher economic sanctions because of the poor human rights
record of Myanmar's military government.
	   Japan expressed concern last week over increased tension between
the Myanmar government and the opposition National League for
Democracy, headed by Suu Kyi, winner of the 1991 Nobel Peace prize.
	   The league overwhelmingly won 1990 general elections but its
legislators were never allowed to take their seats. They have been
put under tight restriction in recent weeks by the military
government.

	   AITAPE, Papua New Guinea (AP) _ Bodies, shattered coconut palms
and the remains of flimsy huts floated off the shores of this

The death toll Monday was at least 599, but could rise to more than
2,000.
	   Papua New Guinea's national radio quoted provincial officials as
saying that the confirmed death toll of 599 could rise to 2,000
people.
	   There was no warning before the 23-foot (7-meter) wall of water
crashed into the northwest coast of Papua New Guinea, a nation on
the island of New Guinea north of Australia, where some people live
a near-Stone Age existence amid jungles and swamps.

Jones wins ninth straight 100
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BERT ROSENTHAL &QC; 
 &UR; AP Track Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNIONDALE, New York (AP) _ Not even a false start could keep
Marion Jones from winning her ninth consecutive 100-meter race.
	   On her second try, Jones burst out of the blocks and raced to a
three-meter victory at the Goodwill Games Sunday night.
	   Although her time of 10.90 seconds was her second-slowest of the
year, it was the eighth straight time she had broken 11 seconds. No
other sprinter has done it more than six times.
	   Even more impressive was that Jones was running into a headwind
of nearly 2 mph (3 kph) and facing a field in which all the runners
had broken 11 seconds _ the fastest ever assembled.
	   No one but Jones, the second-fastest woman ever in the 100
behind Florence Griffith Joyner, could break 11 this time.
	   Ukraine's Zhanna Pintusevich was second at 11.09, with Inger
Miller third at 11.18, and Jamaica's Merlene Ottey fourth at 11.21.
	   Dan O'Brien, the Olympic gold medalist and world record-holder
in the decathlon, returned to the event for the first time since
the Atlanta Games and had a respectable showing.
	   After the first five events, O'Brien was in second place with
4,575 points, 45 behind Chris Huffins, the U.S. champion and world
leader.
	   ``I felt the two years' off,'' O'Brien said. ``I wanted to
finish in style, but I just didn't get a good rhythm going in the
400. My overall fitness is good and my technique was solid.''
	   O'Brien was ahead of his Olympic pace after four events and was
leading the final event, the 400, into the stretch before finishing
third. He also ran well early in the 100, again slowing in the
closing meters.
	   ``I had a great first four events,'' he said.
	   Huffins was pleased with his overall performance.
	   ``This was a very solid day, better than nationals,'' Huffins
said after accumulating 4,620 points. ``At the nationals, I didn't
do anything outrageous during the second day, so hopefully I can do
better tomorrow and get a higher score (than 8,694).''
	   The final five decathlon events will be Monday.
	   John Godina, the world leader in the shot put and discus, won
the shot at 70 feet, 4.5 inches (21.4503 meters) after finishing a
disappointing third in the discus at 206-2 (62.8396 meters) behind
Dmitri Shevchenko (212-8) (64.8208 meters) and Andy Bloom (209-11)
(63.9318 meters).
	   Ato Boldon, the 200 world champion from Trinidad and Tobago,
blazed around the curve and raced to a two-meter victory over Tyree
Washington in 20.15. The time matched the fifth-fastest of the
year, even though the race was run into a headwind.
	   Shana Williams took advantage of the absence of Jones, the world
leader in the long jump, and became the first American to win the
event at the Goodwill Games, leaping a wind-aided 22-9 (6.9342
meters) to beat Russia's Lyudmila Galkina, the 1997 world champion,
and Greece's Niki Xanthou, the world championship silver medalist.
	   Deon Hemmings, the 1996 Olympic champion in the women's 400
hurdles, capitalized on world record-holder Kim Batten's mistake at
the final hurdle and won in 54.20.
	   Mozambique's Maria Mutola led nearly all the way in winning her
second Goodwill Games women's 800 in 1:58.83, her season's best.
Mutola withstood a late charge from Jearl Miles-Clark, second in
1:59.08. Miles-Clark's sister-in-law, Joetta Clark, was third.
	   The competition began with basketball, and the U.S. team of
college players quickly found out there's a difference at the
international level.
	   Puerto Rico, cheered on by a clear majority of the 8,700 fans at
Madison Square garden, rallied from a 19-point deficit to beat the
United States 84-76.
	   Eddie Casiano scored 31 points fro the winners, while Elton
Brand led the United States with 24.
	   Australia, behind 17 points from Andrew Gaze, beat Argentina
84-72, and Lithuania beat Russia 79-72.
	   In gymnastics, Dominique Moceanu of the United States won the
women's all-around title. She finished with a score of 38.662, well
in front of Maria Olaru of Romania with 37.975. Another Romanian,
Simona Amanar, was third with 37.850.
	   In synchronized swimming, a U.S. athlete moved in on history.
	   Bill May and partner Kristina Lum were in second place behind
Russia after the short program of duet, and a medal when the event
is completed Monday would be a rare one for a man in an
international synchro meet.
	   The U.S. team, with May as a reserve, also was in second place
behind Russia.

Legislator kills himself after ruling party candidate loses vote
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A regional lawmaker committed suicide after
apparently failing to secure enough votes for a ruling party
candidate in elections to Japan's Parliament, police and newspaper
reports said Monday.
	   Junji Kaneko, a police spokesman in Mitsuke, a city in Niigata
prefecture, or state, said prefectural legislator Susumu Nishikawa,
55, hanged himself from a clothes line at his home early Sunday.
	   The mass-circulation Yomiuri newspaper reported Nishikawa had
expressed a sense of anxiety over the defeat of a candidate seeking
a seat in Parliament's upper house from the Niigata electoral
district. The candidate was backed by the ruling Liberal Democratic
Party, to which Nishikawa belonged.
	   The conservative LDP suffered a stunning defeat in the July 12
upper house elections, forcing the resignation of Prime Minister
Ryutaro Hashimoto.
	   Niigata is 256 kilometers (160 miles), northwest of Tokyo.
	   Police, however, were still investigating the motives of
Nishikawa's death, Kaneko said. He apparently left no suicide note.

resident Lusien Romme, whose wife was killed and his home
destroyed. Romme, who broke two fingers and injured his ribs and
shoulder, told Australian Associated Press by telephone Sunday from
his bed at Aitape's Raihu Health Center.
	   Romme said he saw ``the sea rising up and coming toward me''
before he was hurled into a coconut tree and then into the Sissano
lagoon.
	   The first of three Royal Australian Air Force C-130 transports
arrived at Vanimo at first light Monday with emergency supplies
including a field hospital and a team of doctors, nurses and
engineers.
	   Vanimo is about 60 miles (96 kilometers) west of the area wiped
out by the tsunami. It is the main administrative center and is
close to the border of the Indonesian province of Iryan Jaya.
	   Fisherman Jerry Apuan said Sunday that he couldn't even count
the number of bodies floating near one of the devastated villages.
	   ``There were so many bodies together I had to move the boat
slowly to pass through them,'' he said. ``I was afraid. It was the
first time I had seen so many bodies.''
	   Scores of children were among the dead. Hundreds of people were
injured and were awaiting urgent medical help, while others were
believed to have fled to higher ground in the interior. An
estimated 6,000 people were left homeless.
	   ``We heard a large bang, then saw the sea rising up. We had no
choice but to run for our lives,'' Paul Saroya, a resident of Nimas
village, told Australian Broadcasting Corp. television.

	   Papua New Guinea, with a population of 4 million, occupies the
eastern half of the island of New Guinea. It has a mountainous,
jungle-filled interior that has only been explored in the past 20
to 30 years, along with lush tropical beaches on the coastal
plains. The capital, Port Moresby, is about 375 miles (600
kilometers) east of Australia.
	   The tsunami struck west of Aitape in West Sepik province,
hitting villages about 370 miles (595 kilometers) northwest of Port
Moresby.
	   Area disaster coordinator Dickson Dalle said Monday the villages
of Nimas and Warapu have also been swept from a low-lying sand spit
into Sissano lagoon.
	   Other villages along the heavily populated coastline were also
badly damaged. The area, which was home to up to 10,000 people, was
deserted after villagers fled to higher ground.
	   Dalle said the confirmed death toll was 599, including 500 dead
at Warapu.
	   ``There are still people out there who are injured that we have
not rescued,'' he said. ``They're scattered all over in the
mangroves.''
	   Dalle said most of the victims were old people and
schoolchildren.
	   ``Schools in Arop, Sissano and Warapu will be closed because we
don't have the children,'' Dalle said. ``They're all dead.''
	   Prime Minister Bill Skate inspected part of the stricken area
Sunday.
	   The area is a jungle, swamp area that includes tribes that rely
on subsistence farming and fishing. Most live in homes made of
jungle materials and built on beaches.
	   In Rome, Pope John Paul II, who has visited Papua New Guinea
twice during his papacy, dedicated his Sunday morning prayers to
the victims. A spokesman said the pope was ``very concerned'' and
asked to be kept informed.

Record finish for Stars and Stripes in Chicago-Mackinac race
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MACKINAC ISLAND, Michigan (AP) _ America's Cup competitor Stars
and Stripes finished the Race to Mackinac in course-record time,
leading a field of 298 boats in the 333-mile (535 kms) event.
	   The 60-foot (18-meter) Morrelli catamaran piloted by Chicago's
Steve Fossett finished in 19 hours, 50 minutes, beating the
previous multi-hull boat record of 29:35.
	   Stars and Stripes also was first across the line in the previous
weekend's Port Huron to Mackinac yacht race. Last January, Fossett
fell short of setting a new world record for solo, around-the-world
hot air ballooning.
	   At least three other boats in the Chicago-to-Mackinac Island
event had crossed the line by 6:30 p.m. Sunday (2230 GMT). They
included the first mono-hull finisher, Sayonara. Skippered by Larry
Ellison, it finished with a time of 25:52:48. That was two minutes,
four seconds short of the course-record set by Dick Jennings' Pied
Piper in 1987.
	   The race's winners will be determined by a system of handicaps
based on each boat's speed potential. The results are expected
Monday afternoon.
	   ``This is really exciting stuff,'' race spokeswoman Penny Beatty
said. ``The wind is really holding up.''
	   Winds were 15-20 knots with 2-3 foot waves (up to 1 meter) in
the Straits of Mackinac, she said.
	   One boat had to withdraw because of equipment trouble, leaving
298 boats still in the race or across the line, Ms. Beatty said.
	   More of the faster boats were expected to come in later Sunday
but most would make it in on Monday, she said.

2,000.
	   There was no warning before the 23-foot (7-meter) wall of water
crashed into the northwest coast of Papua New Guinea, a nation on
the island of New Guinea north of Australia, where some people live
a near-Stone Age existence amid jungles and swamps.
	   The devastating wave, known as a tsunami, shattered the region

Report: Government panel says Thais need a tax cut
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thais need a tax cut to help their
troubled economy rebound, according to a government economic
committee, a newspaper reported Monday.
	   The government's economic screening committee will recommend to
the Cabinet of Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai that corporate and
personal income taxes be cut and utility prices lowered as a means
of injecting more cash into the economy, the Bangkok Post reported.
	   The paper said that while the government's main think tank, the
National Economic and Social Development Board, supported the
proposal, the Ministry of Finance had reservations.
	   The ministry believes the tax cuts will help a few million
people, but will reduce badly-needed revenue for the government,
the Post said.
	   Thailand is suffering through its worst economic crisis in
modern times. The economy is expected to contract by about 5.5
percent this year. The country is receiving a dlrs 17.2 billion
bailout supervised by the International Monetary Fund.

crawled up an electricity pole touched a high-voltage overhead rail
wire, a newspaper reported Monday.
	   About 12,000 passengers, mostly holiday-goers, were
inconvenienced by the incident Sunday morning in northern Japan,
the Mainichi newspaper said.
	   In addition to the cancellations, the report said that six other
trains were delayed by nearly two hours because of the
short-circuit in Eniwa, 800 kilometers (496 miles), northwest of
Tokyo.
	   The report said the snake touched overhead wiring after climbing
up a concrete electricity pole along the rail track. The wiring was
about 5.1 meters (16.8 feet) high.
	   Railway workers later removed the charred remains of the
electrocuted snake, which was about one meter (3 feet 4 inches)
long. The snake's type was not immediately known.
	   The newspaper quoted a local railway spokesman as saying it was
rare in Japan for train runs to be halted because of a
short-circuit caused by a snake.
	   Local railway officials were unavailable for comment Monday.

China to ban dumping in polluted lake
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China will ban waste discharges into the heavily
polluted lake Tai from next year, the official Xinhua News Agency
said.
	   The measures, announced by Vice Premier Wen Jiabao, seek to curb
serious pollution in the lake in eastern Jiangsu province, 50
kilometers (31 miles) west of the commercial city of Shanghai. The
region, traditionally one of China's most fertile, is also one of
its most economically dynamic.
	   Pollution treatment facilities will be built in the lake's
watershed and pollution discharges into rivers that flow into the
lake will be banned from next January 1, Xinhua said in a report
late Sunday.
	   Rapid economic growth has led to virtually unchecked dumping of
sewage and industrial waste into China's rivers and lakes.
	   China's seven major river systems, lakes and reservoirs are
polluted, the State Environmental Protection Administration said in
June. It plans to spend U.S. dlrs 54 billion on pollution controls
by 2000.
	   In one recent disaster, pollution from 20 sewage pipes caused a
massive fish kill in a lake in the central China industrial center
of Wuhan, leaving a ``white ribbon'' of dead fish a kilometer
(two-thirds of a mile) long and 30 meters (100 feet) wide.

<TEXT>
	   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) _ Eduardo Hurtado scored two goals
and assisted on another Sunday as New York-New Jersey beat the
Columbus Crew 3-0 in Major League Soccer.
	   The victory gave the MetroStars a 10-9 record, lifting them into
second place in the MLS Eastern Conference, one point (28-27) ahead
of the Crew. Columbus is now 9-9.
	   Hurtado set up the MetroStars' first goal in the 26th minute
when he fought off two Columbus defenders at the top of the box to
head the ball to the feet of teammate Giovanni Savarese.
	   Savarese pushed the ball past defender Thomas Dooley and put the
ball under goalkeeper Juergen Sommer into the left corner of the
Columbus net.
	   Hurtado tallied his first goal in the 42nd minute, leaping high
over a defender in the box to drill a header past Sommer following
a cross from Tab Ramos. Hurtado closed out the scoring in the 86th
minute running onto a long pass from Billy Walsh and rolling a shot
into the Crew net for his eighth goal of the season.
	   Tony Meola made four saves to register his record 18th MLS
career shutout. His toughest save was a diving fingertip stop on a
header by Brian McBride in the 56th minute.
 &UR; Wizards 4, Rapids 1
	   In Kansas City, Missouri, Preki had a goal and an assist to lead
four different scorers as the Kansas City Wizards defeated the
Colorado Rapids 4-1 in Major League Soccer.
	   Colorado (9-10) lost its seventh straight road game after
opening the game's scoring in the 18th minute on Ross Paule's kick
from 20 yards out.
	   Preki converted a penalty kick six minutes later to tie the
score. The Wizards' Ryan Tinsley then scored off a back pass from
Joey DiGiamarino in the 54th minute for the go-ahead goal.
	   Paul Wright and Digital Takawira added insurance goals for the
Wizards (9-10) in the 58th and 79th minutes. Scott Uderitz and Mark
Chung assisted on Wright's score, while Preki assisted on
Takawira's point-blank shot into an open net.

After scandals, Thai politicians call for tighter passport rules
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Phony monks and prostitutes arrested
abroad have Thai politicians demanding tighter rules for obtaining
passports to prevent undesirables from damaging Thailand's
reputation overseas.
	   The House of Representatives Budget Screening Committee has
appealed for tougher rules after a number of men pretending to be
Buddhist monks were found living with women overseas, the Bangkok
Post reported Monday.
	   Buddhist monks are supposed to be celibate and not live under
the same roof as women.
	   Bangkok is known as a prime transit point for people smuggling
and a place where it is easy to buy a forged passport or other
identity documents, according to law enforcement officials.
	   Changing one's name and buying a new identity card is also a
fairly common practice among many Thais who have landed in trouble.
	   One committee member said some Thai temples overseas were found
to be apartments where the so-called monks were living with wives
or girlfriends, the Post said.
	   Another committee member said that a large number of fake
passports were recently discovered in both northern and southern
Thailand.
	   Lalita Rirksamran, of the opposition Thai Citizens Party, said a
special agency should be set up to check the records of women
traveling overseas to prevent prostitutes from working in other
countries and damaging Thailand's reputation.
	   Police say thousands of Thai women are lured or smuggled to
countries such as Japan and Germany each year to work as
prostitutes.
