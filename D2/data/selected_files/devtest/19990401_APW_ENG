<HEADLINE> Three Bodies Found in Colo. Corral </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COMMERCE CITY, Colo. (AP) -- Three men were found shot to death  
in a corral at a rural boarding stable that neighbors say was 
regularly used for illegal cockfights. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities identified one victim as Jesus Antonio  
Cordova-Gandara, 29. Identities of the others had not been 
confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
	No suspects were named.  
</P>
<P>
	As for the rumor that the shootings resulted from a cockfight  
gone bad, Adams County sheriff's Sgt. Mike Kercheval said ``we've 
been told if it's a cockfight it usually happens on the weekends 
... It's not being discounted but there's nothing to support that 
yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The stable at the end of a country road is in a rural area  
northeast of Denver dotted by small houses and farms. The bodies 
were found when a man arrived at the stable to feed his horses 
Wednesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Marie Prince, who lives next door, said she heard gunshots  
Tuesday night as she watched a movie with her three children. 
</P>
<P>
	``The dog jumped up and started scraping at the window,'' she  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gunshots are fairly common in the neighborhood, with people  
shooting at foxes to keep them away from chickens, said Stephen 
Prince, Marie's husband.

<HEADLINE> Police Confiscate Mich. Riot Photos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- Authorities working to identify suspects  
from a weekend riot at Michigan State University have confiscated 
snapshots from a film developer and subpoenaed news organizations 
for photos and videotape. 
</P>
<P>
	The seizures by East Lansing police took place Monday and  
Wednesday from a film counter at Meijer's, an area department 
store. It came after employees spotted eight rolls of riot footage 
and notified detectives. Five of the rolls were taken by a 
freelance photographer who covered the riot for The Associated 
Press. 
</P>
<P>
	About 5,000 people rioted on the Michigan State campus after the  
school lost its Final Four college basketball game to Duke on 
Saturday. Rioters set cars aflame, broke windows and squared off 
with police. Police have made 27 arrests. 
</P>
<P>
	Meijer's spokesman John Zimmerman said employees in the store  
acted responsibly in alerting police to the riot images. ``This is 
a well-publicized act of violence,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ingham County prosecutor Stuart Dunnings III said his office  
also issued subpoenas Wednesday to 19 news organizations seeking 
all their videotape and film of the riot. He declined to identify 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Crosby, executive editor of the Lansing State Journal,  
said the newspaper sent police copies of photos it had published. 
But he said the newspaper is not turning over any other photos 
except one of a man believed to have assaulted a Journal employee. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need our independence and integrity to do our job,'' Crosby  
said. ``We don't want to be an arm of the police.'' 
</P>
<P>
	WILX-TV news director Kevin Ragan said he turned over only  
material that his station had broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
	``We see the need for our pictures to be part of that  
investigation,'' Ragan said. But he added, ``There are some basic 
First Amendment rights and freedom of the press rights we need to 
protect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police on Thursday also began using a Web site to display  
pictures of riot suspects. Some shots displayed there have been 
given to detectives voluntarily, Lansing Police Lt. Tom Johnstone 
said.

<HEADLINE>  Yugoslavia Captures 3 U.S. Soldiers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO reportedly took its bombing  
campaign to the heart of Serbia's second-largest city today, while 
Yugoslavia broadcast television footage of three U.S. soldiers 
captured by its forces. 
</P>
<P>
	Capt. John Clearwater, spokesman for the U.S. Army's 1st  
Infantry Division, confirmed that the three American soldiers were 
captured by Yugoslav forces. Their unit is based at Wuerzburg, 
Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	The men were captured Wednesday in Yugoslavia, the Yugoslav army  
said in an announcement carried by the state-run Tanjug news agency 
today. NATO has said the U.S. soldiers were in Macedonia, about 3 
miles from the Yugoslavia border, when they reported being 
surrounded. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hold President (Slobodan) Milosevic responsible for the  
safety of these three men,'' British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook 
said today. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO's aerial bombardment continued unabated in Yugoslavia. NATO  
missiles today destroyed a major bridge over the Danube River in 
Novi Sad, Serbian media said. Military warehouses are located at 
one end of the bridge. 
</P>
<P>
	Serbian state television showed the remnants of the destroyed  
bridge, which connects two parts of the city. It said the city's 
water system was heavily damaged. No casualties were reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The government's Tanjug news agency said 10 missiles had struck  
around the Kosovo capital, Pristina, since Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Serbian television showed the three U.S. soldiers, dressed in  
camouflage, with what appeared to be dirt or abrasions on their 
faces. The report apparently aired from Pristina, implying the 
captured soldiers were being held there. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the emissary of Pope John Paul II, French Archbishop  
Jean-Louis Tauran, left for a one-day visit to Belgrade today for 
talks with Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov failed to produce a  
breakthrough in a similar mission Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, Russian President Boris Yeltsin called for a meeting of  
the foreign ministers of the G-7 leading industrialized nations and 
Russia on halting the NATO attacks. But because six of the seven 
G-7 nations were participating in the NATO operation, it appeared 
unlikely they would agree to such a meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO has said it would refuse to suspend airstrikes during  
upcoming Easter celebrations. 
</P>
<P>
	``This would be a blank check for Milosevic to continue the  
killing,'' said German Gen. Klaus Naumann, chairman of NATO's 
military committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The Easter weekend starts Friday in the Western Christian  
Church. The Orthodox Church, to which most Serb's belong, 
celebrates Easter a week later. 
</P>
<P>
	With hints from Western diplomats that NATO bombs and missiles  
could soon be raining down on the Yugoslav capital of Belgrade, 
NATO spokesman Jamie Shea on Wednesday reiterated the alliance's 
insistence that Yugoslav security forces are bent on purging Kosovo 
of ethnic Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	Shea said Yugoslav forces were destroying property deeds,  
marriage licenses, birth certificates and financial records. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a kind of Orwellian scenario of attempting to deprive  
a people and a culture of the sense of past and the sense of 
community on which it depends,'' he said at the alliance's 
headquarters in Brussels, Belgium. 
</P>
<P>
	Yugoslav authorities claim the refugees are fleeing NATO  
attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	In a clear warning to remaining Kosovo Liberation Army rebels,  
the Yugoslav army ordered all Kosovo Albanians to surrender weapons 
or face ``rigorous and unmerciful measures,'' the private Beta news 
agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Kosovo, a southern Serbian province, has been wracked by war  
since Milosevic launched a campaign against separatist ethnic 
Albanian rebels in February 1998. Serbia is Yugoslavia's dominant 
republic. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yugoslav war crimes tribunal said Wednesday it had indicted  
Serb paramilitary leader Zeljko Raznatovic for Bosnian war-era 
atrocities -- an announcement seen as a warning signal to Milosevic 
about what legal action awaits him and other Yugoslavs for their 
actions in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands more refugees from the province poured across the  
frontier Wednesday into neighboring countries that are already 
overwhelmed by Kosovo Albanians who have fled their homes since the 
NATO bombing began March 24. 
</P>
<P>
	Long lines of refugees formed at the borders of both Macedonia  
and Montenegro, where departing Kosovo Albanians said another 5,000 
people were coming behind them. Refugees were crossing some border 
points at a rate of 4,000 an hour, the U.N. food agency said in an 
appeal for emergency food aid and vehicles to transport it. 
</P>
<P>
	``The human mind cannot imagine what they are doing there,''  
said Sabri Hajzeri, 30, a painter who was among the first group of 
refugees from Pristina to cross into Albania. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton authorized an additional $50 million in relief  
aid for the refugees and defended his reluctance to commit U.S. 
ground troops. 
</P>
<P>
	``The thing that bothers me about introducing ground troops into  
a hostile situation, into the Balkans and Kosovo, is the prospect 
of never being able to get them out,'' Clinton said in an interview 
with Dan Rather of CBS News.

<HEADLINE> Marine Cable Car Trial Continues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- Parents of three women who died when a  
Marine Corps jet severed an Italian ski gondola cable say a missing 
videotape could have helped them comprehend a confusing tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
	``It could have given us all the information we need to  
understand what happened,'' Margo Anthonissen of Belgium testified 
Wednesday at the sentencing hearing for Capt. Joseph Schweitzer, 
31, of Westbury, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	Schweitzer was the navigator aboard the jet that cut the cable  
on Feb. 3, 1998, near Cavalese, Italy, sending 20 people plunging 
to their deaths. He has pleaded guilty to obstruction and 
conspiracy charges, admitting that he and the pilot switched a 
videotape after they made an emergency landing. 
</P>
<P>
	Schweitzer said he later tossed the tape into a bonfire. The  
maximum sentence for the two charges is 10 years in prison, 
dismissal from the service and forfeiture of pay. 
</P>
<P>
	Bert Berger of the Netherlands said there was important  
information on the tape, despite Schweitzer's assertion that he 
stopped filming 10 minutes before the accident over a snow-covered 
valley in the Alps. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, it's a puzzle with missing pieces,'' Berger said.  
</P>
<P>
	Another parent told the military jury the tape could show ``what  
was really going on in that cockpit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, Schweitzer's former commanding officer testified he  
lost trust after learning Schweitzer lied to him about using the 
camera during the flight. 
</P>
<P>
	Retired Lt. Col. Richard Muegge, who was relieved of command  
after the accident, said Schweitzer had told him there was a video 
camera aboard the EA-6B Prowler, but he didn't use it. 
</P>
<P>
	``He made a series of very bad mistakes and errors in  
judgment,'' Muegge said. ``Something like that hurts the special 
trust and confidence you need in someone you may go to war with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schweitzer testified Monday that he used the camera three times  
to tape parts of the flight and once aimed the camera at his face 
and smiled. He said he and the pilot, Capt. Richard Ashby, 32, of 
Mission Viejo, Calif., agreed to switch the tape for a blank one so 
investigators wouldn't get it. 
</P>
<P>
	A jury earlier this month acquitted Ashby of manslaughter  
charges and the same charges were dismissed against Schweitzer. 
Ashby still faces obstruction of justice charges for his role with 
the videotape.

<HEADLINE> Marine: I Said To Ditch Cable Tape </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- A remorseful Marine aviator said today  
it was ``a big mistake'' to destroy a videotape he shot before his 
jet cut an Italian gondola cable, killing 20 people. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wish I had left it there. The videotape didn't have anything  
to do with the mishap,'' Capt. Joseph Schweitzer, who was the jet's 
navigator, testified at his sentencing hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Schweitzer could receive up to 10 years in prison after pleading  
guilty to obstruction of justice and conspiracy charges Monday, 
telling a judge he threw the videotape into a bonfire. A 
nine-member military jury is hearing testimony before recommending 
a sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense rested its case following Schweitzer's testimony.  
Court was to resume Friday with closing arguments. 
</P>
<P>
	The Marine EA-6B Prowler was on a low-level training flight near  
Cavalese, Italy, on Feb. 3, 1998, when it severed the ski gondola 
cable, sending it hurtling 370 feet to the ground and killing 
everyone aboard. The jet limped back to the air base at Aviano, 
Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I pleaded to was a big mistake, a big mistake,'' said  
Schweitzer, 31, of Westbury, N.Y. ``I will live with it the rest of 
my life. It doesn't change my core. I'm taking responsibility for 
that today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schweitzer choked up while describing when he learned people in  
the ski gondola had died. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was the worst moment I ever had in my life,'' he said.  
``Every thought of happiness and joy seeped out of my body.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A backseat crewman testified earlier Thursday that he advised  
Schweitzer and the jet's pilot, Capt. Richard Ashby, to destroy the 
videotape because he felt abandoned by higher-ups and was concerned 
about the hostility of the Italian news media. 
</P>
<P>
	``It surprises me that I made that decision,'' said Capt.  
Chandler Seagraves, 29, of Nineveh, Ind. ``It's wrong as a Marine 
Corps officer. Two fellow Marines were asking my advice as a Marine 
Corps officer, and I steered them in the wrong direction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the accident, the crew was removed from the air base to  
answer questions by Italian investigators, Seagraves said. When 
they came outside there was no one to take them back to the base, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seemed like nobody actually cared what happened,''  
Seagraves said. ``That started scaring all of us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seagraves was granted immunity to testify. Charges against him  
and the other backseat crewman, Capt. William Raney of Englewood, 
Colo., were dropped last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby, 32, of Mission Viejo, Calif., was acquitted last month by  
a separate jury of manslaughter charges. He still faces trial on 
obstruction charges.

<HEADLINE> BP Confirms $26.6B Purchase of Arco </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- BP Amoco Corp. announced today that it has  
acquired Atlantic Richfield Co. for $26.6 billion in stock, paving 
the way for the creation of the world's second largest oil company. 
The combined company would rank second in size behind the planned 
Exxon-Mobil combination and would be the latest in consolidation to 
take place in the rapidly changing oil industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``For BP Amoco, the strategic rationale for this deal is the  
immense potential it offers for future growth,'' said Sir John 
Browne, the company's chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal is subject to approval by shareholders in both  
companies. Browne said he hoped to complete the transaction by the 
end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	BP Amoco said 2,000 jobs are expected to be eliminated, mainly  
in the United States outside Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the terms of the deal, BP Amoco will exchange .82 of its  
own stock for each share held by Arco shareholders, BP Amoco said. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the deal, Arco's top management and board will fully  
relinquish control of the company. 
</P>
<P>
	BP Amoco has been a leading force in the oil industry's  
consolidation as the former British Petroleum PLC acquired Amoco 
Corp. of Chicago for $57.6 billion in December. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal could run into potential problems with Alaska statutes  
that limit how much exploration acreage companies and their 
subsidiaries can control in that state. 
</P>
<P>
	While BP Amoco now produces more oil than Arco in Alaska, it's  
Arco that has the best prospects. 
</P>
<P>
	Arco sold off its coal mining and petrochemical operations  
during 1997 and 1998 to focus on ``upstream'' activities -- oil 
discovery and production -- and on retail sales through its chain of 
convenience stores. 
</P>
<P>
	As Arco narrowed its focus, the company became particularly  
vulnerable to slumping oil prices because it derives a larger 
percentage of its revenue from oil than most petroleum companies. 
</P>
<P>
	BP Amoco is more diversified. The company not only ranks among  
the largest oil producers, but also is one of the biggest 
manufacturers of petrochemicals.

<HEADLINE> China Premier's Visit Still On </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongj is going ahead with  
his White House visit next week despite China's call for an 
immediate halt to NATO airstrikes in Yugoslavia, a top Chinese 
embassy official said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the face of growing U.S.-Chinese tensions over human rights,  
alleged Chinese nuclear spying and U.S. missile defense 
initiatives, Zhu is still hoping to close a deal with the Clinton 
administration to allow Beijing to join the World Trade 
Organization as well, said Liu Xiaoming. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know that the climate and atmosphere right now is not that  
good, but I think it is all the more important, all the more 
necessary for the leadership to meet,'' said Liu, deputy chief of 
mission at the embassy. ``I think when the relations are bad, we 
need more visits of this kind. 
</P>
<P>
	``So we believe that the premier is coming, despite the  
difficult time in our relations,'' Liu added, saying he was 
speaking for the Chinese government. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov canceled a visit to the  
White House at the last minute last week as NATO airstrikes got 
under way March 24. Primakov visited Yugoslav President Slobodan 
Milosevic this week in an attempt to negotiate a halt to NATO's air 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Liu said Zhu, who has acknowledged this might be a difficult  
visit, is ready to face the good and the bad of the U.S.-Chinese 
relationship. Liu said the Chinese are used to ``storms'' between 
Washington and Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
	Zhu, who is known for his blunt style, ``is very effective in  
communicating with the public,'' Liu said. ``He will not avoid any 
challenges.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The premier will make clear to Clinton, however, that China  
strongly opposes U.S. plans to condemn Beijing's human rights 
record at the annual U.N. Human Rights Commission meetings under 
way in Geneva, Liu said. The U.S. resolution, which hasn't been 
introduced yet, will protest recent long prison sentences for 
members of a banned democracy party. 
</P>
<P>
	On trade, Liu said it was uncertain whether U.S. and Chinese  
trade officials, who have been negotiating furiously during the 
past few weeks in Washington and Beijing, will agree on terms for 
China to join the WTO after 13 years of trying. Gaps still remain, 
he acknowledged, in how much China is willing to lower trade 
barriers and tariffs on imported goods. 
</P>
<P>
	``Important progress has been made, though there are still some  
differences,'' Liu said, adding that reaching a WTO deal is a top 
priority for Zhu but not necessary for a successful visit. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do not think there should be any linkage of WTO with the  
visit,'' Liu said. ``The visit itself stands on its own.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zhu's nine-day U.S. tour, which will take him to five cities  
outside Washington, is his first as prime minister. He will see 
President Clinton at the White House on April 8. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States and China are trying to hold regular visits  
after nearly a decade of strained relations following the Chinese 
military assault on pro-democracy demonstrators at Tiananmen Square 
in 1989. Chinese President Jiang Zemin visited the White House in 
October 1997, and Clinton went to China in June 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides meeting Clinton and Vice President Al Gore, Zhu also  
will hold talks with members of Congress, business and university 
leaders and other state and local authorities, the embassy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Zhu will arrive in Los Angeles April 6 before heading to  
Washington. He also will visit Denver, Chicago, New York and Boston 
and may observe financial markets, possibly the New York Stock 
Exchange and the Chicago Board of Trade.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Verdict Put Off for While </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Microsoft's antitrust case is on track to  
continue through late summer or early fall, after the judge 
outlined a new courtroom schedule and promised to resume the 
marathon trial in mid-May. 
</P>
<P>
	The extended recess provides Microsoft and the government more  
time to try to negotiate a settlement, although one round of talks 
ended unsuccessfully earlier this week after only two hours. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no plans to meet again on a specific date, but  
neither side ruled out future talks. A person close to the case 
said Wednesday that further negotiations were unlikely for at least 
one week. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tuesday night's negotiations at the Justice Department,  
described as cordial, Microsoft's top legal negotiators couldn't 
reach common ground with government lawyers, another person close 
to the discussions said. Talks broke up at 7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	Both the company and the government declined to comment about  
negotiations after a hearing Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there are going to be productive settlement discussions,  
they must not take place publicly,'' said Justice lawyer David 
Boies, standing beside Microsoft's top attorney, William Neukom. 
``None of us will have any comment whatsoever about settlement 
discussions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, presiding over an  
unrelated criminal trial expected to last all April, said he will 
resume the Microsoft case May 10 or the Monday following jury 
deliberations in his current case. 
</P>
<P>
	The new schedule will likely delay any verdict until August or  
September. In the interim, Microsoft is expected to release the 
next version of its popular Office package of business software 
programs, and it has promised the next generation of its computer 
operating system, Windows 2000, by year's end. 
</P>
<P>
	Antitrust expert William Kovacic of George Washington University  
said even with delays, the trial was progressing relatively fast. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the speed of light for antitrust,'' he said. ``To lay  
people, it may seem like the movement of a glacier, but in 
antitrust this remains extraordinarily quick.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The government alleges that Microsoft illegally wields its  
influence as the manufacturer of Windows to stifle competition in 
the technology industry. Much of its focus has centered on the 
company's latest software, Windows 98. 
</P>
<P>
	After nearly five months of testimony from two-dozen witnesses,  
the trial will soon enter its rebuttal phase, when Microsoft and 
the government will each use three more witnesses to refute the 
other's characterization of its case. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial, which could have significant effects on the computer  
industry in the future, began late in October and was originally 
expected to last six to eight weeks.

<HEADLINE> Blizzard Pounding Northern Plains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) -- April roared in like a lion today as a  
winter storm blanketed parts of the northern Plains with more than 
a foot of snow. 
</P>
<P>
	``You couldn't even see -- freezing rain, snow was blowing. It  
was just terrible,'' said Melvin Walker, a truck driver who was 
forced to pull off the road and wait at a truck stop because of the 
conditions. ``Looking at it now, it's even worse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many schools were closed, and authorities warned against  
traveling in several counties because of icy roads and poor 
visibility. 
</P>
<P>
	The storm moved to the north and weakened later in the day.  
</P>
<P>
	In the Black Hills in South Dakota, Deadwood got 13 inches of  
snow and nearby Lead received about a foot, the weather service 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In North Dakota, Bismarck and Dickinson both received 9 inches  
of snow, and Minot was expected to get about 6 inches, Leblang 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just holed up,'' said Kent Kibbel of Mott, in  
southwestern North Dakota. ``We can't even see out the window. It's 
not even fit for a dog to be out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The blizzard brought thunder, lightning and hail, and came just  
a week after temperatures soared into the 70s in some parts of the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
	The storm also brought back memories of the blizzard of April  
1997 -- more than 17 inches of snow coupled with freezing rain over 
a three-day period that led to the devastating flood in Grand 
Forks. 
</P>
<P>
	Grand Forks Mayor Pat Owens said officials were shoring up dikes  
and awaiting projections from the National Weather Service on the 
impact of the storm on the rising Red River. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials have said, however, they do not expect a repeat of the  
disaster. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know our people are on top of everything at this point. I  
have asked them to over-prepare, and that's what they are doing,'' 
Owens said. ``The adrenalin is flowing again.''

<HEADLINE> Captured U.S. Soldiers To Be Tried </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Three U.S. soldiers captured by  
Yugoslav forces in Kosovo will face a military trial on Friday, the 
state news agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tanjug report said Jovica Jovanovic, a judicial official in  
Pristina, the Kosovo capital, said an authorized military court 
would conduct the trial of the three soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO officials warned Thursday they would hold Yugoslav  
President Slobodan Milosevic responsible for any mistreatment of 
the three Americans, who disappeared during a patrol along the 
Macedonia-Yugoslavia border on Wednesday after sending a radio 
message they were under attack. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials said the three should be released immediately  
because they were part of a peacekeeping mission in Macedonia that 
represented no threat to Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	The capture came as NATO took its bombing campaign to the heart  
of Serbia's second-largest city and thousands of refugees continued 
pouring out of Kosovo with stories of an apparent eradication 
campaign that NATO officials contend is aimed at altering forever 
the ethnic makeup of the embattled Serbian province. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana and the alliance's top  
military officer, U.S. Gen. Wesley Clark, both expressed 
satisfaction with the results of the bombing campaign that began 
March 24 to try to stop the carnage in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Clark said the eight days of missile and bombing raids hit  
targets all over Yugoslavia, particularly air defenses, 
communications networks, military compounds and Serb forces 
carrying out attacks in Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> L.A.'s Spring Future Is Unsure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VERO BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- The Los Angeles Dodgers have completed  
their 51st year of spring training in Vero Beach. It might have 
been their last. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dodgers, who first set up camp in this quiet coastal city in  
1948 -- 10 years before they moved from Brooklyn to Los Angeles -- 
are considering a move to Fort McDowell, Ariz., near Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fort McDowell Indian Community has offered to build the  
Dodgers a 12,500-seat stadium, five or six practice fields and 
housing if the team decides to leave Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	The team, which headed home to Los Angeles on Wednesday, is  
expected to make a decision in about a month. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just being here this year I got a taste of what it feels like  
to be at Dodgertown, and I've always admired playing here,'' said 
left fielder Gary Sheffield, traded to the Dodgers last May. ``You 
have to feel for the people here, and you want to give them what 
they want, but you also have to look at the other side. Hopefully 
both sides can work it out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	City and county officials in Vero Beach have been negotiating  
with the Dodgers for about a year on how to keep the team at their 
current training site, generally considered the most traditional 
and fan-friendly in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	A Florida Senate bill introduced last week would provide $7.5  
million the next two years to renovate Dodgertown and help keep the 
team in Vero Beach. 
</P>
<P>
	Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone is optimistic that the team  
will stay in Florida, though he said the site needs upgrading to 
match Fort McDowell's offer. 
</P>
<P>
	``People call me the eternal optimist, but I've leaving some  
stuff behind,'' Malone said Wednesday as he packed up his 
Dodgertown office. ``I'm hoping it will be here when I get back. 
I'm not looking at it as though this is my last time here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A crowd of 4,717 fans, about 700 below this spring's average,  
watched the Houston Astros beat the Dodgers 6-4 in Wednesday's 
finale at Holman Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Bud Holman, a local businessman, who invited the Dodgers to set  
up camp in Vero Beach in 1948 after it was decided the city needed 
a tenant to occupy the former World War II naval air station. 
</P>
<P>
	The last game didn't feature any special ceremonies, but about  
250 fans attended a postgame sendoff sponsored by a local committee 
hoping to keep the Dodgers in Vero Beach. 
</P>
<P>
	Sonny Jones, a middle-aged fan who grew up in Vero Beach,  
recalled attending games with his brother as a youngster after 
school. 
</P>
<P>
	``It'll be sad if they go,'' Jones said. ``I understand where  
they're coming from. Economics is economics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe so, but Ed Niedziela, a resident of nearby Sebastian, said  
he felt frustrated ``because it's just a financial thing, and the 
tradition isn't even a concern.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Bagwell and Carl Everett hit back-to-back solo homers with  
two outs in the first off Dodgers ace Kevin Brown, and Bagwell hit 
another solo shot off Brown in the fourth when the Astros scored 
three times to take a 5-4 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown, in his final appearance before he faces the Arizona  
Diamondbacks next Monday in the season-opener, allowed five runs, 
four earned, on seven hits in five innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Young and Sheffield homered for the Dodgers.  
</P>
<P>
	Todd Hundley, who missed most of last season after undergoing  
reconstructive surgery on his right elbow late in 1997, caught 
back-to-back games for the first time all spring and said he felt 
fine despite going 0-for-3 at the plate. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything was good,'' Hundley said. ``This was something we  
wanted to get accomplished to check everything out, and things 
worked out fine.''

<HEADLINE> Gasoline, Crude Fall on Price Worry  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Gasoline and crude futures retreated Thursday on the New York  
Mercantile Exchange amid concern this week's price rally may have 
been premature. 
</P>
<P>
	On other markets, sugar futures also fell sharply, as did grain  
and soybeans. 
</P>
<P>
	Gasoline and crude prices were on the defensive throughout the  
session as market participants took profits following several 
sessions of strong gains for crude byproducts. Market participants 
also seemed to react to concerns that world oil producers have yet 
to meet commitments from a previous round of oil cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	Futures prices also were pressured by reports the Organization  
of Petroleum Exporting Countries last month met about 77 percent of 
its goal announced last year of cutting daily supplies by 2.6 
million barrels. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of those same producers and other non-OPEC countries  
pledged beginning today to slash another combined 2.1 million 
barrels daily from production, a goal that many are beginning to 
doubt they will be able to meet. 
</P>
<P>
	Gasoline prices this week also have been supported by a spate of  
refinery troubles on the West Coast, but some of those have been 
resolved, which should help ease tightness in one of the country's 
largest driving regions. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude for May delivery finished unchanged at $16.64 a barrel;  
May unleaded gasoline fell .92 cent to 53.10 cents a gallon; May 
heating oil fell .6 cent to 43.40 cents a gallon; May natural 2.5 
cents to $2.038 for each 1,000 cubic feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Sugar futures tumbled 6 percent on the Board of Trade of the  
City of New York amid perceptions a global supply glut will 
continue to grip the market. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices had been on the rise during the previous six sessions  
amid heavy fund house buying, but market participants sold again 
after examining a weak fundamental supply and demand picture. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil, the world's top producer, and other countries produced a  
bumper world crop this year -- new production for which there is few 
takers. Russia and other major Asian importing nations have slashed 
their orders because of economic problems within that make even the 
relatively cheap sugar too expensive. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sugar doesn't have a friend; it looks like an orphan,'' one  
trader noted. 
</P>
<P>
	May raw sugar fell .32 cent, or 6 percent, to 5.59 cents a  
pound. 
</P>
<P>
	Grain and soybean futures finished a holiday-shortened trading  
week lower on the Chicago Board of Trade under continued pressure 
from perceptions U.S. supplies will continue to build. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices were pushed lower in follow-through selling from  
Wednesday's weak close, when market participants interpreted the 
government's planting intentions and stocks reports as meaning 
supplies will increase in the face of anemic world demand. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn and soybeans also were pressured by harvesting of bumper  
competing crops in South America and amid prospects for beneficial 
weather in the Midwest that could aid early spring planting. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat fell after weekly export figures came in at the lowest so  
far this marketing year, as supplies rise to their highest in more 
than 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	July wheat fell 4 1/2 cents to $2.86 1/4 a bushel; May fell 3 1/2 cents  
to $2.22 a bushel; May soybeans fell 1/2 cent to $4.83 1/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	The markets are closed for Good Friday.

<HEADLINE> DaimlerChrysler Earnings Are Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- DaimlerChrysler AG sold 16.5 percent more  
Chryslers, Dodges, Plymouths and Jeeps in the United States last 
month than it did a year ago, setting first-quarter and March sales 
records as Americans' demand for new vehicles continued to grow 
unabated. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly every automaker that reported March results Thursday also  
had double-digit increases. 
</P>
<P>
	Toyota Motor Corp. said its sales increased 10.5 percent over  
March 1998, Mitsubishi Motors Corp. continued its rebound with a 63 
percent improvement, while Volkswagen AG posted a 52 percent gain 
for its best March in 18 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Honda Motor Co.'s sales were up only half a percent but enough  
to break its March record. Even ailing Nissan Motor Co. managed a 4 
percent gain, in part because of a big improvement in sales of its 
Quest minivan that was redesigned for 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the 13 major automakers who reported results Thursday,  
total sales were up 15 percent over the first three months of 1998. 
Executives said the quarter's torrid sales pace was unexpected. 
</P>
<P>
	``The economy has defied predictions of a slowdown through the  
first quarter and there is clear evidence that strong industry 
sales are on track to continue well into the summer,'' said Yale 
Gieszl, a vice president with Toyota Motor Sales USA. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts were surprised, too.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's amazing, isn't it?'' said Nick Colas of Credit Suisse  
First Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Colas suspects one contributing factor was the increase in  
electronic filing of income-tax returns, which has resulted in 
earlier disbursement of tax refunds. But the major factor remains 
the soundness of the U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything we knew about the economy last year is still  
true,'' he said. ``Unemployment remains quite low, confidence is 
high, interest rates are benign. This magic potion that worked for 
the past couple of years is still working.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Colas said the industry may be nearing a sales peak. ``We'll see  
some slowing -- not enough to call it a recession or to have a big 
effect on earnings. But nobody believes this pace is sustainable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jamie Jameson, DaimlerChrysler's vice president of U.S. sales  
and marketing, was more optimistic: ``Our economists say they think 
that unless something happens that nobody's predicting, they don't 
see much change.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler's sales were led by a 20 percent gain in light  
trucks. Car sales rose 9 percent. The company's U.S. brands broke 
their March record set in 1994 and a first-quarter record set in 
1996. The German-American automaker broke 17 of its first quarter 
sales records and 18 of its March records. 
</P>
<P>
	Mercedes-Benz, the German unit of DaimlerChrysler, was a major  
exception. Its U.S. sales fell 5 percent, in large part because of 
a 19 percent decline in demand for its M-Class SUV that's built in 
Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
	Honda's 7 percent drop in car sales was offset by strong demand  
for its redesigned Odyssey minivan and its CR-V sport utility 
vehicle; combined minivan and SUV sales were up 55 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitsubishi benefited from robust demand for its sedans and the  
Montero Sport SUV; the Japanese automaker doubled sales of its 
redesigned Galant family sedan. 
</P>
<P>
	Among smaller automakers, Land Rover was up 76 percent, Subaru  
posted a 19.5 percent gain, Audi AG rose 28 percent, Saab AB 
enjoyed a 9.5 percent improvement, Volvo AB was up 8 percent and 
Isuzu Motors Ltd. edged up 4 percent. The comparisons are based on 
the daily sales rate; there was one more sales day last month than 
in March 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford Motor Co. plans to release its March sales figures Tuesday,  
followed by General Motors Corp. on Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Holds Milosevic Responsible </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said Thursday he holds  
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic responsible for the capture 
of three Army soldiers near the Macedonian-Yugoslav border, warning 
him to ``make no mistake'' and release them immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States initially branded the capture an illegal  
abduction on the assumption that Serb forces had crossed into 
Macedonia. But later Thursday, Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon 
called the soldiers ``prisoners of war,'' raising the specter that 
they could be held until the end of hostilities. The Pentagon was 
investigating the possibility that the soldiers had blundered 
across the Macedonian border into Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Yugoslavia said the soldiers were invaders and would face  
criminal trial before a military court Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're outraged by that,'' Bacon said. ``They are covered by  
the Geneva Convention. Prisoners of war should not be tried.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Yugoslav announcement added a new and unsettling element to  
an expanding Balkan conflict that the Clinton administration 
struggled Thursday to explain. 
</P>
<P>
	Mixed with images of Kosovar Albanian refugees fleeing from  
apparent Yugoslav ``ethnic cleansing'' operations were television 
pictures apparently from Pristina, the Kosovar provincial capital, 
showing the three American soldiers in captivity. They bore facial 
cuts and bruises. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon released a transcript of the soldiers' final,  
frantic radio dispatches. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're in contact. We're taking direct fire,'' one of the three  
soldiers shouted into his radio, the sound of gunfire in the 
background. 
</P>
<P>
	``You better not be bull-----ing me,'' a soldier in another  
Humvee some distance away replied. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not. We're taking direct fire. (interim) We're trapped.  
(interim) They're all around us. (interim) We can't get out.'' That 
was the final transmission. The nearby Army soldiers mounted an 
immediate search but found no trace of the men or their Humvee. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO airstrikes, meanwhile, continued across a broad spectrum of  
targets Thursday, including a major bridge across the Danube River, 
a Yugoslav army unit in central Kosovo, an ammunition dump and fuel 
storage facility. Bacon said there were signs Yugoslav forces were 
low on fuel. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, who met with families of service members, pledged to  
stay the course in Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is something we are doing to try to avoid in the 21st  
century the kind of widespread war, large American casualties and 
heartbreak that we saw too much of in the century we are about to 
leave,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But a key Clinton ally in the Senate, Robert Torricelli, D-N.J.,  
was sharply critical, saying the U.S. military gave the Serbs ``a 
virtual invitation'' to capture the soldiers. ``It is 
incomprehensible to me that the U.S. military would send a 
three-man patrol near the borders of Serbia,'' Torricelli said in a 
telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona, who spent nearly six  
years as a prisoner of war in Vietnam, said the capture of the 
soldiers should not deter the United States from completing its 
mission in Kosovo, even if it requires more than air power. 
</P>
<P>
	``This plan did not go according to as the administration  
expected,'' McCain said on CNN's Crossfire. ``That's not a reason, 
even if Americans are killed or captured, to change the ends. It's 
a reason to change the means to reach that end, which is victory.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bacon said he did know why the lightly armed patrol was  
operating near the border, and said that was under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon, meanwhile, announced that Defense Secretary  
William Cohen had ordered 13 F-117A stealth fighter-bombers to the 
region this weekend to join 11 of the radar-evading planes already 
operating over Yugoslavia. One is a replacement for the F-117A that 
was apparently shot down Saturday near Belgrade. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Serb air defenses are robust and remain so,'' Bacon said,  
thus the need for more stealth planes. 
</P>
<P>
	The new fighters bring the total of U.S. aircraft to 220 out of  
400 NATO warplanes. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the captured soldiers, Bacon said the investigation was  
continuing to determine exactly who abducted them and from where 
they were taken. He asserted they were entitled to POW status ``at 
a minimum,'' and could be eligible for immediate release if they 
were captured in Macedonia. 
</P>
<P>
	The Army is revamping its patrol and security procedures for the  
roughly 400 soldiers conducting a peacekeeping and observation 
mission in Macedonia, Bacon said. Among other things, the Pentagon 
is concerned that even within Macedonia, soldiers could face 
hostile activity from Serbs angry over the NATO strikes. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton dispatched Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott to  
the Balkans to assess the effect of the Kosovo crisis on 
neighboring countries. 
</P>
<P>
	``The United States takes care of its own,'' Clinton said to  
emotional applause from service members gathered in a hangar at 
Norfolk Naval Base in Virginia. ``President Milosevic should make 
no mistake: We will hold him and his government responsible for 
their safety and their well-being.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon backed away from its initial assertion that the  
soldiers had not crossed into Yugoslav territory. Army Gen. Henry 
Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said that 
possibility was now being investigated, and he suggested that the 
three may have inadvertently crossed the border while fleeing from 
a Serb ambush. But the Clinton administration maintained that the 
capture of the soldiers was illegal. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was absolutely no basis for them to be taken,'' Clinton  
said. ``There is no basis for them to be held. There is certainly 
no basis for them to be tried.'' 
</P>
<P>
	State Department spokesman James P. Rubin called the capture an  
``illegal abduction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister Vuk Draskovic, a moderate in the  
Yugoslav government, told The Associated Press that the soldiers, 
who were caught Wednesday, would be treated ``with the full respect 
of all international conventions concerning prisoners of war.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon identified the three as Staff Sgt. Andrew A.  
Ramirez, 24, of Los Angeles; Staff Sgt. Christopher J. Stone, 25, 
of Smiths Creek, Mich.; and Spc. Steven M. Gonzales, 21, of 
Huntsville, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're pretty much in shock,'' Stone's father, Jim Stone, told  
the Times Herald of Port Huron, Mich. ``We didn't know anything 
that was going on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The men had been on a routine reconnaissance mission in the  
Kumanov area of northern Macedonia, about three miles from the 
southern Yugoslav border, when they radioed frantically at about 3 
p.m. (8 a.m. EST) that they were taking small arms fire and then 
that they were surrounded. Nothing further was heard from the 
patrol. The Pentagon kept the situation secret until Wednesday 
evening after U.S. search-and-rescue helicopter teams had failed to 
find the soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
	Draskovic said the wounds clearly visible on one soldier  
resulted from his ``trying to fight physically before being 
arrested.'' But U.S. officials voiced concern. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're very concerned about the safety and welfare of the three  
soldiers who were abducted by Serb forces,'' U.S. Army Gen. Wesley 
Clark, the NATO commander, said at a news conference in Brussels, 
Belgium. ``We've all seen their pictures. We don't like it. We 
don't like the way they're treated, and we have a long memory about 
these kinds of things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt was steaming toward the  
Mediterranean Sea and a possible rendezvous with other U.S. naval 
forces taking part in the Yugoslav strikes. The mission has been 
largely carried out by Air Force bombers and fighters based at 
Aviano Air Base, Italy, and Royal Air Force Base Fairford, England. 
But Clark has asked the Pentagon for use of the Roosevelt with its 
70-plus combat aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
	A defense official said three Navy ships in the Roosevelt battle  
group have been given permission to take part in the mission -- an 
attack submarine, destroyer and cruiser, all capable of firing 
Tomahawk cruise missiles. They are expected to arrive in the 
Adriatic Sea within days.

<HEADLINE> CBS Buys Top Syndicator King World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Hoping to shake a stodgy image and diversify  
beyond its traditional network TV business, CBS Corp. is buying the 
leading television syndicator, King World Productions Inc., for 
$2.5 billion in stock. 
</P>
<P>
	The purchase of the aggressive programming distributor, which  
sells TV stations hit shows like ``The Oprah Winfrey Show,'' 
``Wheel of Fortune'' and ``Jeopardy,'' is part of CBS's drive to 
make money from other sides of the media business rather than 
relying mainly on TV and radio advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	It was CBS's first major acquisition under the leadership of  
President Mel Karmazin, a hard-hitting manager who soared to the 
top of the company last fall, just two years after CBS acquired his 
Infinity Broadcasting radio company. 
</P>
<P>
	Karmazin is hoping to reshape CBS, which has been less  
successful than rivals NBC and ABC at luring in the younger 
audiences coveted by advertisers. He also is looking to make 
Internet acquisitions and develop the company's own online 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Many see his purchase of King World as a strong step, probably  
the first of many, toward diversifying CBS and shaking up the 
straight-laced world of network television. 
</P>
<P>
	``Karmazin is a great media entrepreneur, and there's never been  
a media entrepreneur running a network before,'' said Tom 
Vanderslice, an investment banker for media companies at CIBC 
Oppenheimer Corp. ``It took that kind of a guy to put together a 
deal like this. ... He's gonna be the guy to watch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The leaders of King World, brothers Roger and Michael King, said  
they spoke to several companies before settling on a deal with CBS, 
which has promised to keep King World independent and free to sell 
programming to whoever it wants to. 
</P>
<P>
	The King brothers told reporters in a teleconference that  
retaining autonomy was key to ensuring the continuing success of 
their business, which has gained the loyalty of many top program 
producers, including talk show star Oprah Winfrey. 
</P>
<P>
	Without a deal, King World faced the prospect of being an  
independent syndicator in an industry increasingly dominated by 
giant media conglomerates. ``If you're going to succeed and be 
competitive, you can't stand alone,'' said Michael King. 
</P>
<P>
	Roger King said he wants King World to become the ``Switzerland  
to the broadcast community,'' keeping up good relations with 
various competing media companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to be the Swiss banker,'' Karmazin chimed in.  
</P>
<P>
	Keeping stars like Winfrey signed with King World will be one of  
the challenges following closure of the deal. Winfrey is currently 
scheduled to continue with King World through the season that ends 
in June 2002, and she released a statement Thursday saying the deal 
would not change any of her current arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
	In his comments to reporters, Karmazin made it abundantly clear  
how important the ``The Oprah Winfrey Show'' is to King World, 
where it pulls in close to half of the company's revenues. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I spoke with her earlier this week, I sucked up to her  
big time,'' Karmazin said. ``I think she is an extraordinary talent 
and anything that Oprah would ever want to do for our company, we 
would be proud to have her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the deal, which calls for exchanging each King World  
share for 0.81 shares of CBS stock, CBS will get a cash stockpile 
of some $800 million, which Karmazin hopes to put to work 
immediately by investing in other properties. 
</P>
<P>
	``You'll be hearing a lot in the very near future,'' Karmazin  
said. ``As they say in the television business, stay tuned.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Based on the closing values for both stocks Wednesday, before  
the deal was formally announced, the offer would represent a 
premium of 8.2 percent for King World shareholders. But it would be 
a 14.2 percent premium over King World's stock price a week ago, 
before the latest takeover speculation heated up. 
</P>
<P>
	In trading Thursday, King World's stock rose 56 1/4 cents, or 1.8  
percent, to close $31.12 1/2 while CBS shares slipped 68 3/4 cents, or 
1.7 percent, to $40.12 1/2. Both stocks trade on the New York Stock 
Exchange.

<HEADLINE> USDA Proposes Milk Price Overhaul </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal milk pricing regions would be  
consolidated and the formulas used to determine how dairy farmers 
are paid would be changed under a major overhaul of dairy policy 
proposed by the Agriculture Department. 
</P>
<P>
	The changes, which must be approved by milk producers, are  
expected to benefit consumers only slightly: The government expects 
the average price of drinking milk to drop by about 2 cents a 
gallon. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the government said significant strides had been made.  
</P>
<P>
	``These reforms will help make sure that America's dairy farmers  
receive a fair price and that American consumers continue to enjoy 
an abundant affordable supply of milk,'' Agriculture Secretary Dan 
Glickman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's milk pricing regions are divided into what are  
called milk marketing orders, which set the price processors pay 
dairy farmers. Under the changes, the milk marketing orders would 
be reduced from 31 to 11. 
</P>
<P>
	The newly consolidated orders must be approved by either  
two-thirds of producers in a marketing area or by producers who 
supply two-thirds of the milk in a marketing area. If these 
producer referendums are approved, the changes will take effect 
Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	The pricing formulas would also see changes. The basic formula  
price, which establishes the minimum price for milk used in nearly 
all dairy products, would be replaced with a formula that looks at 
multiple across-the-board components. The basic formula price had 
been based on the price of raw milk used for cheese in Minnesota 
and Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the biggest and most contentious changes would be in the  
differentials received by farmers, which would vary by region. For 
instance, farmers in Texas would see their differential drop from 
$3.16 to $2.10 per hundredweight, while the Chicago area would see 
an increase from $1.40 to $1.95. 
</P>
<P>
	The differentials, which help cover the cost of dairy farming in  
those areas, are higher for regions that are considered milk 
deficient. They have also sparked the ire of farmers in the Upper 
Midwest who complain that the pricing system is more favorable to 
dairy farmers in the West, South and other regions. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday, the reaction from Congress was mixed.  
</P>
<P>
	``Secretary Glickman's decision is like a bad April Fool's  
joke,'' said Sen. Jim Jeffords, R-Vt. ``This plan will likely cost 
New England dairy farmers $1.5 million per week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Russell Feingold, D-Wis., said while the reforms will help  
some, the plan means farmers in his state will get ``far less for 
their milk than they should.'' 
</P>
<P>
	E. Linwood Tipton, president of the International Dairy Foods  
Association, which represents processors, said he was still 
evaluating the proposal but that ``a very early reading indicates 
that they may have moved the chairs on the deck, but not moved us 
much further toward true reform.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jerry Kozak, chief executive officer of the National Milk  
Producers Federation, said his organization was also still 
reviewing the complex decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	The overhaul reforms a milk marketing order system that has been  
in place since the 1930s. The orders essentially prevent processors 
from playing producers against each other to drive down the price. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1996 farm bill ordered Glickman to consolidate to between 10  
and 14 orders. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the new proposal, the 11 orders will include the following  
areas: Northeast, Appalachian, Florida, Southeast, Mideast, Upper 
Midwest, Central, Southwest, Arizona-Las Vegas, Western and Pacific 
Northwest.

<HEADLINE> Crop Insurance Aid Questioned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The federally subsidized crop insurance system  
is prone to abuse, conflicts of interest and errors because most of 
the risk for losses is born by taxpayers rather than the private 
companies that sell and service the policies, government auditors 
say. 
</P>
<P>
	Sometimes the insurance system allows farmers to earn more from  
crops they do not harvest. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies ``have little reason to effectively monitor risky  
policy holders, little reason to deny claims of questionable 
losses, and no cause to find fault with their own practices,'' said 
an internal report by the Agriculture Department's inspector 
general. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to assuming most of the risk for losses, the  
government subsidizes the premiums farmers pay for the insurance 
and pays the companies a fee for handling the policies. The program 
has cost the government more than $1.5 billion a year, and Congress 
is considering doubling that to improve the coverage and make it 
less costly to producers. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said that in west Texas last year, 200 farmers  
obtained federally subsidized insurance on a type of cotton that 
wasn't feasible to grow in their arid region. They paid $4.4 
million in premiums and then claimed nearly $15 million in benefits 
when most of the crop failed. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers in North Dakota and surrounding states recently rushed  
out and bought seed for durum wheat, even in areas not suited for 
the crop, to take advantage of a new insurance policy offering 
benefits far higher than they could earn if they grew and sold 
ordinary wheat, the IG said. 
</P>
<P>
	And in another case cited by the report, sales agents were  
working for tomato farmers to whom they sold insurance. One agent 
received commissions totaling $284,000, and the farmer he worked 
for collected $2.4 million in insurance benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	Stephen Frerichs, a spokesman for the companies, dismissed the  
inspector general's report this week, saying it was merely 
``rehashing a bunch of old'' audits. 
</P>
<P>
	The insurance companies have to pay some of the losses, with  
their share varying according to their government contracts. 
Nevertheless, they have made $2.8 billion in fees and underwriting 
gains -- their gross profits after losses -- over the last four 
years. That's $400 million more than they made in the previous 14 
years combined. 
</P>
<P>
	Acreage covered by the insurance has doubled to about 70 percent  
of all farmland since the program was last overhauled in 1994, 
while losses have been relatively low. The weather has been good 
through most of the country since 1993 except for droughts in the 
South and Southwest last year that prompted Congress to provide 
$1.7 billion in disaster relief for lost crops and livestock 
assistance. 
</P>
<P>
	USDA's Risk Management Agency, which oversees the program, has  
been shifting more of the risk to the companies in recent years and 
cutting their fees, officials say. In the case of the durum 
policies, USDA sharply reduced the potential benefits and is now 
being sued by farmers to have them reinstated. 
</P>
<P>
	``Farmers are honest folks. If they think someone is cheating,  
they'll report it,'' said John Zirschky, the agency's associate 
administrator. ``Farmers don't like to see people stealing 
taxpayer's money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The inspector general said the government should consider  
raising the companies' share of the risk still more and take over 
running some of the business. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers currently pay $50 a crop for basic ``catastrophic''  
coverage, regardless of acreage, and about 60 percent of the 
premium -- which can run into thousands of dollars -- for more 
extensive ``buyup'' insurance. Those policies cover losses from 
drought, floods, pests, and in some cases, drops in projected 
revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	The government pays the rest of the premium. In 1998, the  
government spent $946 million on premium subsidies and paid another 
$759 million to the companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers complain that crop insurance is usually too stingy and  
they want coverage for more specialty crops and also for livestock, 
which can't be insured now.

<HEADLINE> Japan Co. Starts Layoff Insurance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- As layoffs soar and restructuring becomes corporate  
Japan's new catchphrase, one company wants to sell jittery workers 
a bit of peace of mind. 
</P>
<P>
	Its product? Redundancy insurance.  
</P>
<P>
	Mitsui Marine &AMP; Fire Insurance Co. announced Thursday that it  
will launch Japan's first-ever ``Unemployment Life Support 
Insurance,'' a novel idea in a country long accustomed to the idea 
of lifetime employment. 
</P>
<P>
	Buyers will receive financial support if they get fired or if  
their companies go bankrupt. Mitsui Marine even guarantees to make 
up the difference if a worker's new job pays less than the old one. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan has for decades boasted one of the lowest jobless rates in  
the industrialized world. But with the economy mired in its worst 
recession since World War II, job-security fears are spreading 
rapidly. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese government announced this week that the  
unemployment rate reached a record-high 4.6 percent. In December, 
Japan's jobless rate surpassed that of the United States for the 
first time ever. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say unemployment in Japan would more than double if  
companies got rid of all of their unnecessary employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitsui Marine's insurance costs 15,000 yen ($126) the first year  
and 17,700 yen ($149) for every year after that. It promises 
financial assistance for up to 180 days in the event of 
unemployment, Mitsui Marine said. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said it is targeting private company employees with  
mortgages who would be particularly hurt by sudden job loss.

<HEADLINE>  BP Confirms $26.6B Purchase of Arco </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- BP Amoco Corp. is buying Atlantic Richfield Co.  
for $26.6 billion in stock in a deal that will make it the world's 
second largest oil company. 
</P>
<P>
	The combined company, which would be exceeded in size only by  
Exxon Corp. once it completes its purchase of Mobil Corp., would be 
the latest union to take place in the rapidly consolidating oil 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``For BP Amoco, the strategic rationale for this deal is the  
immense potential it offers for future growth,'' Sir John Browne, 
the company's chief executive, said today in announcing the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	BP Amoco said 2,000 jobs are expected to be eliminated from a  
combined work force of 115,000, mainly in the United States outside 
Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the overlap in business operations would be minimal, but  
said the company expects to sell some $3 billion in assets. He 
refused to give details on the assets likely to be sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal is subject to approval by shareholders in both  
companies. Browne said he hoped to complete the transaction by the 
end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	The acquisition would boost BP Amoco's daily oil output by 32  
percent to 2.7 million barrels, he told a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	It also would increase the company's natural gas output by 27  
percent and make it the third-biggest gas producer. BP Amoco would 
get Arco's proven gas reserves of 9.8 trillion cubic feet and an 
even larger amount of unproven gas reserves, particularly in 
Indonesia and other Southeast Asian countries. 
</P>
<P>
	With global demand for gas expected to grow at twice the rate of  
demand for oil, Arco's gas holdings were especially attractive, 
Browne said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the retail market for refined products, the acquisition would  
give BP Amoco a dominant refining and marketing presence in the 
car-dependent western United States, where Arco operates 1,760 
filling stations. 
</P>
<P>
	Browne said combining the two companies' operations in Alaska  
will greatly increase the competitiveness of the state in the face 
of uncertain oil prices and provide a strong incentive for 
significant investment in oil fields. 
</P>
<P>
	``The actual assets being acquired are very complementary,''  
said Mark Horn, head of European research for the brokerage T. 
Hoare and Co. 
</P>
<P>
	BP Amoco, Horn said, ``has come from being a third-rank player  
to challenging No. 1 in a short space of time, and it has done so 
in a way that has not harmed its structure financially. It has 
improved its assets and given itself a whole new range of choices 
and opportunities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under the terms of the deal, BP Amoco will exchange .82 of its  
own stock -- worth $82.82 based on Wednesday's closing stock prices 
-- for each share held by Arco shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
	BP Amoco's share price slipped 1.8 percent by mid-afternoon  
trading on the London stock exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	In trading on the New York Stock Exchange Wednesday, shares of  
BP Amoco fell $2.32 1/4 a share to $101, while shares of Arco lost 
$1.50 to $73.12 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the deal, Arco's top management and board will  
relinquish control of the company. 
</P>
<P>
	BP Amoco has been a leading force in the recent wave of  
consolidation in the oil industry. The former British Petroleum PLC 
acquired Amoco Corp. of Chicago for $57.6 billion in December, and 
Browne said the integration of Amoco into BP's operations has gone 
``extraordinarily well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The BP Amoco-Arco combination is subject to antitrust review and  
could run into potential problems with Alaska statutes that limit 
how much exploration acreage companies and their subsidiaries can 
control in that state. 
</P>
<P>
	While BP Amoco now produces more oil than Arco in Alaska, it's  
Arco that has the best prospects. Production from Prudhoe Field has 
diminished in recent years, but Arco expects to have its 
360-million barrel Alpine field operating in about two years. The 
company also is exploring acreage in the vast National Petroleum 
Reserve-Alaska west of Prudhoe. 
</P>
<P>
	Arco sold its coal mining and petrochemical operations during  
1997 and 1998 to focus on activities like oil discovery and 
production and on retail sales through its chain of convenience 
stores. 
</P>
<P>
	As Arco narrowed its focus, the company became particularly  
vulnerable to slumping oil prices because it derives a larger 
percentage of its revenue from oil than most petroleum companies. 
</P>
<P>
	BP Amoco is more diversified. The company not only ranks among  
the largest oil producers, but also is one of the biggest 
manufacturers of petrochemicals.

<HEADLINE> Church Ruling Triggers Response </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Christian Coalition officials said they plan  
to distribute a record 70 million voter guides next year, even as 
critics say a new federal court decision may help challenges to the 
group's activities. 
</P>
<P>
	Executive Director Randy Tate said churches distributing the  
Coalition voting guides won't be affected by a U.S. District Court 
decision stripping a church of its tax-exempt status for running 
ads attacking President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	His comments came Wednesday, a day after U.S. District Judge  
Paul Friedman backed the Internal Revenue Service, which had 
revoked the tax-exempt status of the Church at Pierce Creek near 
Binghamton, N.Y., for running newspaper advertisements against Bill 
Clinton in 1992. It marked the first time that a church had lost 
its tax exemption for partisan political actions. 
</P>
<P>
	Tate said the case would not affect the Christian Coalition,  
whose voter guides are nonpartisan and do not endorse candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a long history of constitutional protections in the  
IRS code,'' Tate said. ``We've never had a problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, Barry Lynn, executive director of Americans United  
for Separation of Church and State, said he hoped the court 
decision would cause the IRS to take a long, hard look at the voter 
guides, which he contended were partisan documents designed to 
support Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the first of what I hope will be a string of decisions  
by the IRS to crack down on politicking by churches,'' Lynn said. 
</P>
<P>
	The church, which had sued to overturn the IRS decision, plans  
to appeal. Its ads, which ran in The Washington Times and USA 
Today, warned ``Christian Beware'' and stated that ``Bill Clinton 
is promoting policies that are in rebellion to God's laws.'' The ad 
sought donations to help pay for the ads. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were running it to talk to our flock and Christian people  
in general,'' said the church's pastor, Rev. Daniel Little. 
</P>
<P>
	Little, pastor of Landmark Church in Binghamton, warned of a  
chilling effect on the church's role to speak out on moral issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``If every time the church decides to say something about morals  
in the public arena they have to stop and look over their shoulder 
to see what the IRS is going to say, they're no longer in control 
of their own words,'' he said.

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- A man suspected of killing six women in the  
northern border city of Juarez has declared his innocence and 
blamed another man for the slayings, a Mexico City newspaper 
reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Jesus Manuel Guardado Marquez, a 27-year-old former bus driver  
who transported factory workers in Juarez, was arrested last 
weekend in the neighboring state of Durango. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators said they hoped he would shed light on the  
killings of scores of women in the industrial city over the last 
six years. 
</P>
<P>
	The daily La Jornada reported that Guardado told a criminal  
court judge Wednesday that he had consensual sex with the victims 
but denied killing them. He said a fellow bus driver, whom he did 
not identify, was addicted to heroin and killed the women. 
</P>
<P>
	A 14-year-old girl told officials that Guardado beat and raped  
her last month and left her for dead. The girl, a factory worker, 
said she was the last passenger on Guardado's bus when he veered 
from the normal route and attacked her. 
</P>
<P>
	Police say about 100 women, mostly teens, have been killed since  
1993 in Juarez, across the border from El Paso, Texas. Independent 
groups say the number could be as high as 192. The victims were 
raped or sexually brutalized in 54 of those cases. 
</P>

	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- The city's most famous beaches,  
Copacabana and Ipanema, have been deemed unfit for bathing because 
of leaks in sewer pipes, local media reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The same problem frustrated hundreds of thousands of bathers  
during the Carnival only six weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The state's environmental agency has recommended bathing only at  
beaches far to the east of the city. 
</P>
<P>
	The situation will only get worse when new repairs begin April  
12. The government says 105 cubic feet of sewage per second will be 
discharged into the ocean during the repairs, which are not 
expected to finished until May. 
</P>
<P>
	City officials were unavailable for comment Thursday due to the  
Easter holiday.

	CHILPANCINGO, Mexico (AP) -- Thousands of leftist party activists  
blocked streets in the Guerrero state capital Thursday in a failed 
effort to stop the inauguration of a new governor they accuse of 
stealing his election victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Rene Juarez of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party was  
sworn into office in a Chilpancingo auditorium while angry crowds 
chanted outside. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters of the Democratic Revolution Party claim Juarez stole  
his Feb. 7 victory through ballot fraud and by buying votes in the 
poorest regions of the rugged Pacific coast state. 
</P>
<P>
	Juarez denies the charges, and on Tuesday, the nation's top  
electoral court upheld his victory as valid. 
</P>

batons and plastic shields but there were no reports of violence.

	LIMA, Peru (AP) -- Police have seized 2.3 tons of cocaine  
destined for Spain hidden under bags of frozen fish in a warehouse 
near Lima, the largest seizure of cocaine this year in Peru, 
authorities said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Police estimate the cocaine would be worth $105 million on  
Europe's streets. 
</P>
<P>
	Warehouse workers in the Lima port of Callao found the cocaine  
Wednesday night during a routine inspection, a police spokesman 
said. The owner of the cargo and the truck driver have been 
arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	Preliminary investigations indicate the cocaine was brought to  
the Callao warehouse by truck from the northern port of Paita, 560 
miles northwest of Lima, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Peru is one of the world's largest growers of the coca leaf used  
to make cocaine.

<HEADLINE> Georgia Hires Harrick As Hoop Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATHENS, Ga. (AP) -- Jim Harrick figures he can win another  
national championship at Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
	After spending the past two years at Rhode Island, where he  
rehabilitated his reputation, Harrick was hired Wednesday as coach 
of the Bulldogs, who haven't made the NCAA tournament since 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the lack of success under former coach Ron Jirsa,  
Georgia is the kind of school that can be force on the national 
scene, Harrick said. He cited the strength of the Southeastern 
Conference and the state's strong recruiting base, evidenced by 
Monday's national title game when Duke and Connecticut each had a 
player from the same Augusta high school. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is just a terrific basketball area,'' he said. ``I'd like  
to control the state. I think we would be very, very good if we do 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harrick came to the news conference with a stuffed dog that  
belted out the Georgia fight song, and he wasted little time 
issuing his first edict to a group of players standing in the back 
of the room 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to see you guys later,'' he said. ``I want you to get  
excited about Georgia basketball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After suffering through two disappointing seasons under Jirsa,  
the Georgia players were ecstatic to get a coach who has won a 
national title. Harrick guided UCLA to the 1995 championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's unbelievable,'' center Robb Dryden said. ``When I heard  
the news, I was like, `He's coming here?' That should do volumes 
for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Five returning players attended the news conference, but  
sophomore Jumaine Jones was a no-show. The All-SEC forward, who led 
the Bulldogs in scoring and rebounding, has said he plans to enter 
the NBA draft. He did not answer phone calls to his campus 
apartment. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he should change his decision'' because of Harrick's  
hiring, guard D.A. Layne said. 
</P>
<P>
	Athletic director Vince Dooley checked with the NCAA before  
hiring Harrick, who was fired by UCLA in 1996 for his involvement 
with an illegal recruiting dinner. 
</P>
<P>
	Harrick paid the tab and allegedly lied to cover up that more  
players were at the dinner than allowed by NCAA rules. After 
sitting out the 1996-97 season, he spent two years at Rhode Island, 
leading the Rams to the NCAA tournament both seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Harrick, who has long maintained that he didn't deserve to be  
fired by the Bruins, admitted Wednesday that mistakes were made and 
said he learned from the experience. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've grown from that,'' he said. ``I'm a better coach and a  
better human being.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Georgia president Michael Adams was vice president of  
development at Pepperdine when Harrick coached at the California 
school. The two are close friends, but Adams said he would not 
tolerate the kind of infractions that occurred at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
	``I take compliance very seriously,'' Adams said. ``If a coach  
ever misled me, I wouldn't have that coach working for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harrick, 60, has a record of 403-182 in 19 years as coach at  
Pepperdine, UCLA and Rhode Island. His teams qualified for the NCAA 
tournament 14 times, including a current streak of 10 in a row. 
</P>
<P>
	At UCLA, he won at least 21 games during each of his eight  
seasons, highlighted by the 31-2 team that won the national title. 
</P>
<P>
	Jirsa, who had never been a head coach before he was picked to  
succeed Tubby Smith, went 35-30 in two seasons. Jirsa was fired 
March 11 after the Bulldogs were routed by Clemson in the first 
round of the National Invitation Tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	But Smith showed the school's potential during his two-year  
stint as coach, winning 45 games and reaching the NCAA round of 16 
in 1996 before moving on to Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
	Harrick was chosen over Appalachian State's Buzz Peterson. The  
other finalist, Delaware's Mike Brey, removed himself from 
consideration. 
</P>
<P>
	``From the beginning, we said our commitment would be to hire a  
proven head coach,'' Dooley said. ``Obviously, we've far surpassed 
that expectation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harrick received about $350,000 a year at Rhode Island, while  
his four-year contract with Georgia is worth an estimated $550,000 
annually in salary and benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	The school also will set up a yearly $100,000 annuity, similar  
to the deal for football coach Jim Donnan, that would be paid in 
full if Harrick fulfills his contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are sorry to see him leave,'' Rhode Island athletic  
director Ron Petro said. ``His expertise as a coach was appreciated 
by the university, our fans, supporters and players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harrick hoped to bring his son, Jim Jr., to Georgia as an  
assistant coach, but the school nixed that idea because of the 
state's anti-nepotism law. 
</P>
<P>
	``That hurt me more than anything,'' Harrick said. ``That was  
really the only thing that delayed it.''

<HEADLINE> Marine Cable Car Trial Continues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- Parents of three women who died when a  
Marine Corps jet severed an Italian ski gondola cable say a missing 
videotape could have helped them comprehend a confusing tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
	``It could have given us all the information we need to  
understand what happened,'' Margo Anthonissen of Belgium testified 
Wednesday at the sentencing hearing for Capt. Joseph Schweitzer, 
31, of Westbury, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	Schweitzer was the navigator aboard the jet that cut the cable  
on Feb. 3, 1998, near Cavalese, Italy, sending 20 people plunging 
to their deaths. He has pleaded guilty to obstruction and 
conspiracy charges, admitting that he and the pilot switched a 
videotape after they made an emergency landing. 
</P>
<P>
	Schweitzer said he later tossed the tape into a bonfire. The  
maximum sentence for the two charges is 10 years in prison, 
dismissal from the service and forfeiture of pay. 
</P>
<P>
	Bert Berger of the Netherlands said there was important  
information on the tape, despite Schweitzer's assertion that he 
stopped filming 10 minutes before the accident over a snow-covered 
valley in the Alps. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, it's a puzzle with missing pieces,'' Berger said.  
</P>
<P>
	Another parent told the military jury the tape could show ``what  
was really going on in that cockpit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, Schweitzer's former commanding officer testified he  
lost trust after learning Schweitzer lied to him about using the 
camera during the flight. 
</P>
<P>
	Retired Lt. Col. Richard Muegge, who was relieved of command  
after the accident, said Schweitzer had told him there was a video 
camera aboard the EA-6B Prowler, but he didn't use it. 
</P>
<P>
	``He made a series of very bad mistakes and errors in  
judgment,'' Muegge said. ``Something like that hurts the special 
trust and confidence you need in someone you may go to war with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schweitzer testified Monday that he used the camera three times  
to tape parts of the flight and once aimed the camera at his face 
and smiled. He said he and the pilot, Capt. Richard Ashby, 32, of 
Mission Viejo, Calif., agreed to switch the tape for a blank one so 
investigators wouldn't get it. 
</P>
<P>
	A jury earlier this month acquitted Ashby of manslaughter  
charges and the same charges were dismissed against Schweitzer. 
Ashby still faces obstruction of justice charges for his role with 
the videotape.

<HEADLINE> 'Jenny Jones' Case Continues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- A sociologist said she told  
representatives of ``The Jenny Jones Show'' that having guests 
reveal intimate secrets could lead to violence -- and her warning 
was laughed at. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought it was a superficial, callous response to what they  
were doing with these people,'' Maryaltani Karpos, a University of 
Miami professor of criminology and sociology, testified Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Karpos said she gave the unsolicited warning a year before a  
gay guest was slain after admitting on the show that he had a crush 
on a heterosexual acquaintance. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott Amedure's family has filed a $50 million wrongful death  
lawsuit naming the show, its distributor and producer. The lawsuit 
contends the show's ``ambush'' tactics humiliated Jonathan Schmitz 
and drove him to shoot Amedure in March 1995, three days after they 
appeared on the program. The episode never aired. 
</P>
<P>
	Schmitz was invited on the show to meet a secret admirer only to  
discover it was Amedure. He was convicted of Amedure's murder, but 
the verdict was overturned due to an error in jury selection. His 
retrial is pending. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial was in recess until Monday.  
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Karpos said she spoke to the representatives by phone after  
recoiling at a ``Jenny Jones'' episode. She said she believes 
exposing secrets on camera can lead to an increased potential for 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
	``These emotions, once they are called for, don't just dissipate  
once you turn off the camera,'' she testified. ``There's some 
danger inherent in the period of time that follows the show.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When questioned by defense lawyer James Feeney, Ms. Karpos  
acknowledged she had never done investigative work or primary 
research in relation to televised talk shows. 
</P>
<P>
	In other testimony, a former emergency dispatcher said that  
Schmitz was sobbing and repeatedly mentioned ``The Jenny Jones 
Show'' when he called 911 just moments after the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	``It broke my heart to hear him,'' said Mary Jones, a former  
Auburn Hills police dispatcher. ``What stood out was he was upset. 
Jenny Jones, national television -- those were the things that kept 
coming up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Jones, who is not being sued, is expected to testify  
Wednesday.

<HEADLINE>  BP Confirms $26.6B Purchase of Arco </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- BP Amoco Corp. is buying Atlantic Richfield Co.  
for $26.6 billion in stock in a deal that will make it the world's 
second largest oil company. 
</P>
<P>
	The combined company, which would be exceeded in size only by  
Exxon Corp. once it completes its purchase of Mobil Corp., would be 
the latest union to take place in the rapidly consolidating oil 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``For BP Amoco, the strategic rationale for this deal is the  
immense potential it offers for future growth,'' Sir John Browne, 
the company's chief executive, said today in announcing the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	BP Amoco said 2,000 jobs are expected to be eliminated from a  
combined work force of 115,000, mainly in the United States outside 
Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the overlap in business operations would be minimal, but  
said the company expects to sell some $3 billion in assets. He 
refused to give details on the assets likely to be sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal is subject to approval by shareholders in both  
companies. Browne said he hoped to complete the transaction by the 
end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	The acquisition would boost BP Amoco's daily oil output by 32  
percent to 2.7 million barrels, he told a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	It also would increase the company's natural gas output by 27  
percent and make it the third-biggest gas producer. BP Amoco would 
get Arco's proven gas reserves of 9.8 trillion cubic feet and an 
even larger amount of unproven gas reserves, particularly in 
Indonesia and other Southeast Asian countries. 
</P>
<P>
	With global demand for gas expected to grow at twice the rate of  
demand for oil, Arco's gas holdings were especially attractive, 
Browne said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the retail market for refined products, the acquisition would  
give BP Amoco a dominant refining and marketing presence in the 
car-dependent western United States, where Arco operates 1,760 
filling stations. 
</P>
<P>
	Browne said combining the two companies' operations in Alaska  
will greatly increase the competitiveness of the state in the face 
of uncertain oil prices and provide a strong incentive for 
significant investment in oil fields. 
</P>
<P>
	``The actual assets being acquired are very complementary,''  
said Mark Horn, head of European research for the brokerage T. 
Hoare and Co. 
</P>
<P>
	BP Amoco, Horn said, ``has come from being a third-rank player  
to challenging No. 1 in a short space of time, and it has done so 
in a way that has not harmed its structure financially. It has 
improved its assets and given itself a whole new range of choices 
and opportunities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under the terms of the deal, BP Amoco will exchange .82 of its  
own stock -- worth $82.82 based on Wednesday's closing stock prices 
-- for each share held by Arco shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
	BP Amoco's share price slipped 1.8 percent by mid-afternoon  
trading on the London stock exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	In trading on the New York Stock Exchange Wednesday, shares of  
BP Amoco fell $2.32 1/4 a share to $101, while shares of Arco lost 
$1.50 to $73.12 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the deal, Arco's top management and board will  
relinquish control of the company. 
</P>
<P>
	BP Amoco has been a leading force in the recent wave of  
consolidation in the oil industry. The former British Petroleum PLC 
acquired Amoco Corp. of Chicago for $57.6 billion in December, and 
Browne said the integration of Amoco into BP's operations has gone 
``extraordinarily well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The BP Amoco-Arco combination is subject to antitrust review and  
could run into potential problems with Alaska statutes that limit 
how much exploration acreage companies and their subsidiaries can 
control in that state. 
</P>
<P>
	While BP Amoco now produces more oil than Arco in Alaska, it's  
Arco that has the best prospects. Production from Prudhoe Field has 
diminished in recent years, but Arco expects to have its 
360-million barrel Alpine field operating in about two years. The 
company also is exploring acreage in the vast National Petroleum 
Reserve-Alaska west of Prudhoe. 
</P>
<P>
	Arco sold its coal mining and petrochemical operations during  
1997 and 1998 to focus on activities like oil discovery and 
production and on retail sales through its chain of convenience 
stores. 
</P>
<P>
	As Arco narrowed its focus, the company became particularly  
vulnerable to slumping oil prices because it derives a larger 
percentage of its revenue from oil than most petroleum companies. 
</P>
<P>
	BP Amoco is more diversified. The company not only ranks among  
the largest oil producers, but also is one of the biggest 
manufacturers of petrochemicals.

<HEADLINE> Dell To Build Plant Near Nashville </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Dell Computer Corp. plans to build a new  
plant in the Nashville area, but many details remain to be worked 
out, a spokeswoman said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The size of the project is dependant on the state meeting  
certain telecommunications and transportation needs, spokeswoman 
Cathie Hargett said, declining to provide specifics. She also said 
the company is watching to see what type of business tax reforms 
are passed by the Legislature, which is meeting in special session. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would affect the scope of what we put there,'' Hargett  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dell is considering several sites in the Nashville area, Hargett  
said. She would not disclose the locations or say how many people 
might be employed at the plant. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tennessean reported today that Dell representatives have  
spoken to officials in Nashville and Williamson and Rutherford 
counties about a plant that could eventually employ 10,000.

<HEADLINE> Canadiens' Corson Suspended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTREAL (AP) -- Montreal Canadiens winger Shayne Corson was  
suspended for six games, including five for entering the opposing 
team's dressing room, by the NHL on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The suspension, which will cost Corson $66,406 in lost salary,  
stemmed from an incident last Saturday at Vancouver when the 
Canadiens left winger was sent off for attempt to injure after 
high-sticking Canucks' defenseman Ed Jovanovski. 
</P>
<P>
	Corson later went to talk to Jovanovski in the Canucks' dressing  
room. 
</P>
<P>
	While a news release issued by league disciplinarian Colin  
Campbell did not give a breakdown, Canadiens general manager Rejean 
Houle said he was told Corson got one game for high-sticking and 
five for going into the Canucks' locker room. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a precedent,'' Houle said. ``It's pretty heavy but I feel  
I'll go along with it. We know Shayne didn't have to go there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Campbell cited no rule about entering another team's locker  
room. 
</P>
<P>
	``After leaving the playing surface, Mr. Corson proceeded past  
his own dressing room, traveled a significant distance and entered 
the Vancouver dressing room, disregarding the objections of NHL 
security personnel,'' Campbell's statement read. 
</P>
<P>
	``The NHL has never tolerated, and never will tolerate,  
inappropriate off-ice conduct such as this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Corson was given a match penalty under rule 43a, attempt to  
injure, for hitting Jovanovski in the face with his stick at 12:39 
of the third period of Vancouver's 5-1 victory. Jovanovski got two 
minutes for roughing and a game misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
	Corson said he went to the Canucks' locker room to discuss  
something Jovanovski had said about a member of Corson's family 
while they were in the penalty box, before referee Stephen Walkom 
ordered them to their dressing rooms. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was upset about certain things that were said,'' Corson  
said, adding the players only talked in the room and did not fight. 
``We've all got a bit of a temper. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've all got families and when certain things are said, we  
get upset. I guess I reacted with my heart and not my head.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Corson wouldn't say what Jovanovski said but said Jovanovski's  
remarks were included in a report submitted to Campbell. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to keep that to myself,'' he said. ``But he knows what  
he said and I know what he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe there should be a rule about that, but I don't want  
to get into that. I'm devastated. I'm really disappointed. I'm in 
shock.''

 *Met Performs `Susannah' Opera    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Metropolitan Opera has presented  
``Susannah'' by Carlisle Floyd for the first time, with Renee 
Fleming, Samuel Ramey and Jerry Hadley making the story, set in 
rural Tennessee, come to life. 
</P>
<P>
	``Susannah'' was performed for the first time in 1955, at  
Florida State University and later that year by the New York City 
Opera. It and Gian Carlo Menotti's ``Amahl and the Night Visitors'' 
are the most performed American operas. 
</P>
<P>
	The first Met performance, on Wednesday night, was conducted by  
James Conlon. Floyd, who took bows with the cast, attended the 
opening with Phyllis Curtin, the original Susannah. 
</P>
<P>
	The opera is one that can be enjoyed on first viewing. A  
listener doesn't have to ``let it grow on you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There are two achingly beautiful arias. In Act 1, Susannah sings  
``Ain't It a Pretty Night.'' In this staging, a co-production of 
the Lyric Opera of Chicago and Houston Grand Opera, Fleming sings 
it after climbing a ladder to sit on the roof of her house, with 
stars behind her. She sounds gloriously young. 
</P>
<P>
	In Act 2, the revival preacher Olin Blitch sings, ``I'm a  
lonesome man, Susannah,'' when he goes to her house and finds her 
brother away for the night. Though Blitch plans to rape the girl, a 
listener feels some sympathy for both because of the desolation in 
Ramey's voice and the arching melody. 
</P>
<P>
	In an earlier scene, the revival meeting, Ramey didn't command  
the stage the way the preacher should, even though the pulpit is in 
the middle of the church, centering him amid the congregation. The 
late Norman Treigle as Blitch made the scene electric at the New 
York City Opera. 
</P>
<P>
	Hadley, with a dirty face, was excellent as Susannah's drunken  
brother, Sam. He also has a pleasing melody, a folk-like children's 
song about a jaybird which he sings when Susannah needs comforting. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd wrote the libretto, basing it on the apocryphal  
``Susanna,'' an addition to the biblical book of Daniel. He changed 
the ending to make it more operatic. 
</P>
<P>
	Wives of the church elders disapprove of Susannah, mainly  
because she's pretty. The elders search for a stream for the 
visiting revival preacher's baptisms and see Susannah bathing in a 
stream, naked. They decide she's depraved and exhort Blitch to 
demand a public apology. Insisting she hasn't sinned, she refuses 
to confess. 
</P>
<P>
	The preacher rapes her, then tells the elders the next day she  
was a virgin and they should apologize to her. Instead, they'd 
rather shun her. She tells her brother what happened, and he 
fatally shoots Blitch. Susannah is ostracized by the community. 
</P>
<P>
	Bathing, rape and murder happen offstage. Ominous moments are  
emphasized by dissonant chords in the orchestra. Vocal lines are 
tonal. 
</P>
<P>
	The music is less complex than Met Opera audiences are  
accustomed to. Some may believe, as they do with ``Porgy and 
Bess,'' that it isn't ``real opera.'' There are more complicated 
American operas, some composed by Floyd, but ``Susannah'' is not 
out of place at the Met.

<HEADLINE> Stewart Leaves as Missouri Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBIA, Mo. (AP) -- Norm Stewart recently said he wanted to  
coach another half-dozen years. 
</P>
<P>
	Then he ended a 32-year run at Missouri that produced 634  
victories when he announced his retirement Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	There was speculation that he was pushed out the door by new  
athletic director Mike Alden, who's been at the school only eight 
months, but Stewart said it was his call. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the inspiration came during a game at Kansas in January  
and a familiar chant from Jayhawks fans, ``Sit down, Norm!'' took 
on an entirely different meaning. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know what I said to myself that day? `I think I will,' ''  
Stewart said. 
</P>
<P>
	From then on, although he never let on to players or  
administration, Stewart said there was no turning back. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't always make all the right decisions, and you can't  
coach a perfect game,'' Stewart said. ``So you make the decision 
and that's it. I got to make mine. I wish more people in this 
profession got to do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart will serve the last four years of his contract as a  
special assistant to the school's chancellor. If there are any hard 
feelings, it was tough to tell as Stewart and Alden shared the 
podium at a center-court news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart was in such a light-hearted mood that when he received a  
standing ovation from several hundred fans and players -- past and 
present -- in attendance, he asked if it had been timed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've decided not to coach at Missouri, in basketball or in any  
other sport,'' Stewart said. ``I came to Missouri a young man and 
I'm leaving a young man. Everybody has been really nice and good to 
work with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alden said he was shocked when the coach brought up retirement  
for the first time on March 15, three days after Missouri was 
eliminated by New Mexico in the first round of the NCAA tournament, 
in what he thought would be a typical end-of-season review. He said 
Stewart reiterated his desire to step down the following day. 
</P>
<P>
	``I asked him, are you sure?'' Alden said. ``He said he had  
decided what he wanted to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Players weren't notified until Wednesday, more than two weeks  
after the meeting. They, too, were shocked. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was getting ready for class and my mom called me and she was  
like `Tell me the scoop, tell me the scoop,''' sophomore forward 
Johnnie Parker said. 
</P>
<P>
	Presumably, Stewart had earned the right to orchestrate his  
departure. He leaves with an impressive resume, at least from a 
numbers standpoint. 
</P>
<P>
	-- He's the third-winningest active coach with 731 victories,  
trailing only James Phelan of Mount St. Mary's (800) and Bobby 
Knight of Indiana (742), and he's seventh on the career list. 
</P>
<P>
	-- He averaged 19 victories a season at Missouri, and as player,  
assistant coach and head coach was involved in more than half 
(1,127) of the 2,151 games ever played at the school. 
</P>
<P>
	-- He bounced back from colon cancer in 1989 and NCAA probation  
in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	-- He produced an undefeated conference champion in 1993-94, a  
team that included zero future NBA stars. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart also leaves the program in good shape, with three  
starters back and two others with significant experience. That's a 
huge difference from his arrival in 1967, when Missouri totaled six 
victories in 49 games the previous two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I got here there wasn't much springboard,'' Stewart said.  
``There wasn't any pool, there wasn't any water. If you jumped in, 
you had problems. There's a better springboard now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the other hand, Missouri hasn't had much success in the  
postseason with a succession of first-round upsets to lightly 
regarded opponents that began in the late 1980s. Missouri missed 
the NCAAs for three years beginning in 1995-96, going a combined 
51-47, before ending that drought this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart's Missouri teams twice made it to the final eight, in  
1976 and 1994, but never to the Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement also came amid reports of a falling-out between  
Stewart and Alden, who wasn't happy with Stewart's lack of response 
last week when junior Albert White announced he wanted to jump to 
the NBA, and of repeated problems with players. Nine players have 
transferred in the last five years. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight of Stewart's current players attended the news conference,  
and the group did not include White or freshman point guard Keyon 
Dooling, who quarreled with Stewart during a game at Colorado in 
January. Stewart said the reason for the no-shows was he told them 
to attend class. 
</P>
<P>
	Dooling downplayed talk that he and fellow freshman guard  
Clarence Gilbert, a former high school teammate in Fort Lauderdale, 
Fla., might have transferred if Stewart stayed. Gilbert was another 
news conference no-show. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't nothing like that,'' Dooling said. ``From what I  
know, Coach made his decision a long time ago. It really had 
nothing to do with us. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was somewhat of a roller coaster, but it's all good. I mean  
it. I respect him a lot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alden said he has no short list of candidates in mind to succeed  
Stewart. Possible candidates include Duke assistant Quin Snyder, 
Bob Bender of Washington and longtime Missouri assistant Kim 
Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, I would be interested,'' Anderson said. ``As time goes  
on, we'll see what happens.''

<HEADLINE> Livan Is the Toast of Miami </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MELBOURNE, Fla. (AP) -- Livan Hernandez walked through the  
Florida Marlins clubhouse passing out cigars in a conspiratorial 
whisper. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're good,'' he said, pressing his index finger to his  
lips. ``They're from Cuba. Ssshhh.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The $20 Cohibas were appropriate because Hernandez has reason to  
celebrate: He's young, rich and the toast of Miami. And he believes 
his best days are yet to come. 
</P>
<P>
	``People think I'm 28 or 29 years old,'' Hernandez said. ``They  
say, `Hey, you're pitching pretty good.' They forget I'm only 24. 
My dream is to be one of the best pitchers in the major leagues, 
and they say you really start becoming that kind of pitcher at 25 
or 26.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an organization loaded with promising young arms, Hernandez  
is often inadvertently omitted from the list. But the 1997 World 
Series most valuable player is still younger than many rookies. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has thrown a lot of innings and pitched in some of the  
biggest games a pitcher can pitch in, and yet he's just turned 
24,'' Marlins general manager Dave Dombrowski said. ``With 
everything he has gone through, it's very easy to forget.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yes, Hernandez has experienced a lot since defecting from Cuba  
in September 1995. He struggled with the adjustment to American 
culture and cuisine, then sparked the Marlins' championship season 
as a rookie and provided an unforgettable sound bite during the 
city's celebration when he shouted, ``I love you, Miami!'' 
</P>
<P>
	But last year Hernandez succumbed to the sophomore jinx. As the  
ace on the worst pitching staff in the National League, Hernandez 
went 10-12, allowing a league-high 265 hits with 37 homers while 
his ERA climbed to 4.72, compared with 3.18 in his rookie season. 
</P>
<P>
	The dismantling of the World Series champions clearly troubled  
Hernandez. He found himself one of the few remaining stars on a bad 
team, and he disliked the role. 
</P>
<P>
	``I get mad when we lose, and I felt it a lot last year,'' he  
said. ``We had won it all, and to go through what we did, it 
hurt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was more distress off the field: A former girlfriend  
accused Hernandez of physically abusing her. He denied the 
allegation but said it affected his pitching and agreed in court to 
stay away from her. 
</P>
<P>
	The episode didn't seem to hurt Hernandez's enormous popularity  
in Miami. Following the final courtroom hearing he signed 
autographs for spectators, and many cheered as he departed. 
</P>
<P>
	Spring training means a fresh start, and there are signs of  
maturity from the Cuban with a passion for American movies and 
German luxury sedans. He displayed uncharacteristic devotion to 
offseason conditioning and addressed his chronic weight problem, 
reporting to spring training 15 pounds lighter than last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Livan has turned the corner,'' manager John Boles said. ``He  
is really interested in a big season. He has become a man 
professionally, and we're going to see the results this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hernandez struggled early in spring training but had his best  
outing Thursday, needing just 66 pitches in six shutout innings 
against the Baltimore Orioles. He said he feels great, as usual, 
and he smiled when asked about the impressive durability of his 
right arm. 
</P>
<P>
	``I used to throw a lot of rocks at mangoes in Cuba to knock  
them out of the trees,'' he explained. 
</P>
<P>
	As Hernandez spoke, an interview with UCLA basketball coaching  
legend John Wooden was showing on TV. Hernandez asked who Wooden 
was, and the answer surprised him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh,'' Hernandez said. ``I thought he was a golfer.''  
</P>
<P>
	So he's still adjusting to American culture, and he'll leave it  
for others to decide whether he has matured. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope so. I believe it's probably true,'' he said. ``But it's  
like dominoes. The person sitting at the table only sees his 
pieces. The person standing above the entire game has a different 
perspective.'' 
</P>
<P>
	From a distance, it appears that Hernandez's life is in order.  
His mother, who arrived from Cuba just in time to watch the Marlins 
win the World Series, now lives near his Miami Beach apartment. His 
half-brother, New York Yankees pitcher Orlando ``El Duque'' 
Hernandez, is another neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
	And Hernandez is relieved to relinquish the role of Marlins ace  
to close friend Alex Fernandez, who sat out last year following 
rotator cuff surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	``With me being back, maybe the pressure is somewhat off of  
him,'' Fernandez said. ``I think Livan is going to have a good 
year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There's plenty of motivation. Hernandez is entering the final  
year of a $4.5 million, four-year contract, and he hopes to sign 
another long-term agreement with the Marlins. 
</P>
<P>
	Hernandez still loves Miami, so when the deal is sealed, he'll  
supply the cigars.

<HEADLINE> Report: CBS ready To Buy King World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- CBS Corp. is poised to announce the purchase of  
television program syndicator King World Productions Inc. for $2.4 
billion in stock, The Wall Street Journal reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal would combine the network with hits such as ``60  
Minutes'' and ``Touched by an Angel'' with TV's largest program 
distributor, which has programs such as ``The Oprah Winfrey Show'' 
and ``Jeopardy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The companies were still working out details but the deal could  
be announced today, the Journal reported, citing sources familiar 
with the negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the stumbling blocks are the future roles of King World's  
top two executives, Michael and Roger King. CBS also is reportedly 
seeking the support of Ms. Winfrey in the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The Journal said that King World would be combined with Eyemark,  
CBS's in-house syndication arm, which produces programs such as 
``Martha Stewart Living.''

<HEADLINE> Sen. Gorton Raps Microsoft Judge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	REDMOND, Wash. (AP) -- Microsoft Corp. might lose the antitrust  
lawsuit filed against it because it faces a ``third-rate judge,'' 
Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., says. 
</P>
<P>
	During a visit Wednesday to the software company's suburban  
Seattle headquarters, Gorton -- much to the chagrin of his hosts -- 
discounted Microsoft's chances in the lengthy trial before U.S. 
District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson in Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have a second- or third-rate judge,'' Gorton said in a  
casual conversation with a group of employees. ``I don't know how 
optimistic I am about Microsoft winning at the district level.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gorton also doubted Microsoft could settle the case filed by the  
U.S. Justice Department and 19 states. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not optimistic about a settlement,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Gorton has been one of the staunchest defenders of Microsoft,  
often praising the company on the Senate floor. However, his 
remarks Wednesday were the first time he has openly criticized 
Jackson or suggested Microsoft could lose the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft quickly distanced itself from Gorton's comments.  
</P>
<P>
	``That is not the view of Microsoft,'' company spokesman Dan  
Leach said. ``We have the utmost respect for this court and believe 
that comments to the contrary are inappropriate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leach added that Microsoft is sincere in its settlement efforts.  
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft has endured a number of setbacks in the trial, and  
some court observers have suggested its best hope might be to win 
the case on appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other side of the country Wednesday, Jackson outlined a  
new courtroom schedule in which the long-running trial would resume 
in mid-May, and could continue through late summer or early fall. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial's extended recess, which began in February, gives  
Microsoft and the government more time to try to negotiate a 
settlement, although one round of talks on Tuesday ended 
unsuccessfully after only two hours, with no further negotiations 
scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
	The government alleges that Microsoft illegally wields its  
influence as the manufacturer of the computer operating system 
Windows to stifle competition in the technology industry. Much of 
its focus has centered on the company's latest software, Windows 
98. 
</P>
<P>
	Government and company lawyers have refused to comment on the  
negotiations, but Gorton, who has stayed in close contact with 
Microsoft officials, suggested that the degree to which Microsoft 
and the government might compromise would soon become clear. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll learn more about that over the next 24 to 48 hours,''  
Gorton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gorton met with about 75 Microsoft employees in a town  
hall-style gathering, answering questions about the lawsuit, the 
Kosovo crisis, campaign-finance reform and other issues. 
</P>
<P>
	He also criticized government proposals to break up the company  
or auction off the source code of its Windows operating system. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am convinced that Microsoft has made a reasonable offer,''  
Gorton said. ``I can't see how Microsoft could accept an offer that 
would break up the company or put its assets in the public 
domain.''

<HEADLINE> Lewinsky Inquiry Cost More Than $6M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Boosted by the millions he spent looking into  
the Monica Lewinsky affair, Kenneth Starr's investigation of 
President Clinton and his wife is about to become the most 
expensive independent counsel inquiry ever. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's expenditures totaled $6.2 million in the six months  
through Sept. 30, when the Lewinsky investigation was going full 
speed, pushing the cost of the independent counsel's 4 1/2-year 
inquiry of the president and Hillary Rodham Clinton to nearly $40 
million, according to figures released Wednesday by the 
congressional General Accounting Office. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr replaced prosecutor Robert Fiske, who already had spent $6  
million investigating the Clintons' Whitewater real estate dealings 
and other matters. 
</P>
<P>
	The most expensive independent counsel investigation to date was  
Lawrence Walsh's $48.5 million, six-year probe of the Reagan 
administration regarding its arms and money deals with Iran and its 
secret war against the communist-led government of Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
	The former Iran-Contra prosecutor said Starr's costs would jump  
by many millions of dollars when he concludes his investigation, 
because legal costs for witnesses would be included at that point. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure that Starr will exceed me (in costs) before he's  
through,'' Walsh said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Walsh said that under the independent counsel law, people who  
were subjects of Starr's investigation but who were never indicted 
are entitled to reimbursement from the government for legal costs. 
Among the many people who may fit into that category are the 
president -- who was impeached but not indicted -- and Mrs. Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Elizabeth Ray, a spokeswoman for Starr, said, ``The monumental  
effort required to conduct the investigation of Monica Lewinsky and 
others required unusual commitments of resources.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And White House spokesman Jim Kennedy said, ``Our concerns about  
the exorbitant expense of the independent counsel's investigation 
are well known, but we'll let this latest report speak for 
itself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The cost of investigating top administration officials during  
the Clinton era now tops $76 million, according to the GAO's 
figures. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's $6.2 million expenditure in the six months through Sept.  
30 was up nearly 60 percent from the $3.9 million in the previous 
six months, the GAO said. 
</P>
<P>
	The report did not cover costs for the first 2 1/2 months of  
Starr's investigation into the presidential affair with Ms. 
Lewinsky and the cover-up. Starr opened the Lewinsky investigation 
in mid-January 1998. The latest GAO figures start on April 1, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The GAO totals do not break out Starr's costs for other aspects  
of his investigation, such as the prosecutions of Clinton friend 
Webster Hubbell and Whitewater partner Susan McDougal. But those 
investigations pale in size and intensity to the Lewinsky case, 
which involved a massive grand jury inquiry that lasted seven 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr wrapped up the Lewinsky investigation on Sept. 9, 1998,  
with a report to Congress detailing 11 possible grounds for 
impeaching the president for lying and obstruction. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial of Mrs. McDougal in Arkansas on contempt and  
obstruction charges is in its fourth week. Mrs. McDougal was 
investigated and indicted last May, a cost that would be included 
in the latest financial figures for Starr's operation. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr has two court cases pending against Hubbell, one for  
income tax evasion, the other for obstructing federal regulators 
looking into the failure of the savings and loan owned by the 
Clintons' Whitewater partners. Both those cases were in the 
investigative stage in the months covered by the latest 
expenditures. 
</P>
<P>
	Independent counsels during the Clinton administration have  
investigated former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy, former Housing 
Secretary Henry Cisneros, Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt and 
Labor Secretary Alexis Herman.

<HEADLINE> Devils Closing in on Atlantic Crown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Despite a coaching change, a switch  
to a more offensive game and lower expectations after a playoff 
debacle a year ago, the New Jersey Devils haven't changed much 
where it counts -- in the standings. 
</P>
<P>
	Heading into the final weeks of the regular season, the Devils  
are on the verge of becoming the first team since the Philadelphia 
Flyers (1985-87) to win three straight third straight 
Patrick-Atlantic Division titles. 
</P>
<P>
	With nine games left, New Jersey also has a chance to beat out  
Ottawa and finish with the best record in the Eastern Conference 
for the second straight year. 
</P>
<P>
	That's not too bad for a team that has been viewed this season  
as somewhat of a work in progress because of the switch from 
defensive-minded coach Jacques Lemaire to the more aggressive 
Robbie Ftorek after last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Ftorek has opened the game up for players, encouraged them to  
gamble a little more and not held it against them when it hasn't 
worked. 
</P>
<P>
	Through 73 games, the Devils have a 40-22-11 record for 91  
points, which is eight less than a year ago. The team has scored 
220 goals, 17 more than a year ago, and given up 179, up 39 from 
1997-98. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody thought we'd be so dominant,'' goaltender Martin  
Brodeur. ``I don't think we're dominant playing the game, but we're 
getting the numbers. We're winning and we're scoring a lot of 
goals. 
</P>
<P>
	``Guys are happy with the way things are going,'' he added. ``We  
have to fine-tune our game to make sure we don't miss the good 
opportunity we have this year to go far in the playoffs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Expectations were even higher last year when Ottawa stunned the  
Devils in the opening round of the playoffs, beating New Jersey at 
its own game -- defense. 
</P>
<P>
	The frustration and a problem getting through to his players  
caused Lemaire to resign after the season. Ftorek, his top 
assistant, got the job and changed things this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Brodeur is seeing a lot more odd-man rushes as a result, but the  
Devils have not been involved in a season of seemingly endless 
one-goal games that can take a toll. The players are also having 
more fun, especially the young kids like Petr Sykora (26 goals), 
Jason Arnott (24), Brian Rolston (19), Brendan Morrison (13), 
Patrik Elias (14), Denis Pederson (11) and Vadim Sharifijanov (10). 
</P>
<P>
	Looking at the roster, the team isn't much different from last  
year. The defense still has most of the stars, Brodeur, Scott 
Stevens, Scott Niedermayer and the soon-to-be 35-year-old Ken 
Daneyko, who might be having his best season. 
</P>
<P>
	The big changes were on the forward lines with center Doug  
Gilmour and forward Steve Thomas opting for more money via free 
agency. That opened things up more for the kids, many who played 
for Ftorek at Albany of the AHL. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you look at it we pretty much have the same team with the  
exception of Doug Gilmour,'' veteran right wing Randy McKay said. 
``But we have a lot of fresh legs that are carrying us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The big line has been Arnott centering for Sykora and Elias. The  
veteran line of Bobby Holik, Mckay and Dave Andreychuk has 
struggled the past month but it showed signs of coming around on 
Wednesday in a 7-1 victory over Anaheim with each player scoring a 
goal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully, if we get more than one line going, we're going to  
do well down the stretch and hopefully in the playoffs,'' McKay 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Devils seem to have a real chance of going far in the  
playoffs this year. They've posted a conference-best 29-13-8 record 
against eastern foes and have been exceptional on the road, with a 
league-best 24-9-3 mark.

<HEADLINE> Docs: Don't Plan New Year's Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Because of uncertainty over what will happen when  
1999 becomes 2000, many doctors, hospitals and medical 
organizations are advising patients not to schedule elective 
surgery during the first few days of January. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors attending an American Medical Association regional  
seminar in Denver recently were urged not to consider elective 
surgery early in January, according to Dr. Jack Cletcher of 
Longmont, president of the Colorado Orthopedic Society and member 
of the board of Colorado Medical Society. 
</P>
<P>
	Cletcher said there is optimism that hospitals and other  
institutions will have all of their computers checked and ready for 
the changeover to the year 2000, a problem referred to as Y2K. 
</P>
<P>
	But, he cautioned, medical people want to err on the side of  
caution in case heating plants, oxygen systems or electrical 
systems are affected ``by unrecognized or unknown computer 
problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The March-April issue of Horizons, a newsletter of health  
insurance provider Secure Horizons, contained a similar warning. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think it wise to take an `expect the best; prepare for the  
worst' approach, so we advise all our members not to schedule any 
elective procedures for the first few days of January, 2000,'' 
Horizons wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado hospital groups have been meeting monthly to discuss  
work being done with their computer systems to make them ``Y2K 
Compliant,'' able to recognize the year 2000, according to Peg 
O'Keefe of the Colorado Hospital Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Many earlier computers were formatted with only two spaces to  
indicate the year and there are concerns they will take 00 to be 
1900 and shut down or corrupt files. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. O'Keefe said many officials are anticipating heavy partying  
and other New Year's factors may result in a heavy load for 
hospital emergency rooms, ``the same as Denver experienced after 
the Super Bowl victory'' by the Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesperson for Denver's Porter Hospital said because Jan. 1  
is a Saturday there would be no elective surgery until Monday in 
any event. 
</P>
<P>
	``This will give all hospitals a full weekend to look at the  
situation and work on problems,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	At Denver's Lutheran Hospital, Pat Barker said teams have worked  
on the Y2K problem for about a year and expect to have all work on 
systems critical to patient care finished by June 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``Then they will move on to less critical systems,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Vandy Hires Men's Basketball Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Vanderbilt finally ended its search for  
a new men's basketball coach Thursday by hiring Illinois State's 
Kevin Stallings as its replacement for Jan van Breda Kolff. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people have asked me `First choice? Second choice?  
Third choice?,'' athletic director Todd Turner said. ``That's not 
the issue. The issue is the best choice. We've got the best choice. 
Kevin Stallings represents everything we'd like to try and achieve 
at basketball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Van Breda Kolff resigned Feb. 25 after six seasons at his alma  
mater, and Turner has been searching for a replacement since the 
Commodores' season ended in the first round of the Southeastern 
Conference tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Delaware's Mike Brey and Washington's Bob Bender both pulled  
themselves out of consideration with Bender's decision coming after 
spending two days on campus. 
</P>
<P>
	Other coaches mentioned as candidates were Appalachian State's  
Buzz Peterson, who was a Vanderbilt assistant under Eddie Fogler, 
and Duke assistant Quin Snyder. 
</P>
<P>
	But Turner said Stallings' name first came up last week and that  
he went after him quickly. Vanderbilt, which does not report 
salaries as a private university, reportedly will pay Stallings 
between $400,000-$500,000 annually. He was paid $250,000 a year at 
Illinois State. 
</P>
<P>
	Stallings, 38, called the job ``a perfect fit.''  
</P>
<P>
	``It's well documented that I've been offered other openings in  
the past few years, but this is the best fit at the best time,'' he 
said. ``Everything is in place to have enormous success at 
Vanderbilt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stallings interviewed for the Tennessee job two years ago and  
withdrew his name from consideration. Tennessee then hired Jerry 
Green. Stallings said the reason for his decision in 1997 was the 
fit. 
</P>
<P>
	``Timing is always important whenever one is going. Vanderbilt  
represents everything I believe in. Vanderbilt has everything to 
offer that makes me excited,'' Stallings said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess all's well that ends well. Jerry is at Tennessee, and  
I'm at Vanderbilt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stallings had a 123-63 record at Illinois State, and took the  
Redbirds to the NCAA tournament in 1997 and 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	He played for Purdue from 1980-82, then started his coaching  
career as an assistant there under Gene Keady. He stayed there for 
six seasons before becoming an assistant at Kansas in 1988, then 
got his first head coaching assignment at Illinois State in 
1993-94. 
</P>
<P>
	Stallings met with his new players for a half hour before being  
introduced at the news conference. Sam Howard said they were 
expecting a different coach to walk in. 
</P>
<P>
	``(It was) kind of a surprise at first. He sat down and talked  
to us. We really liked what he had to say ...,'' Howard said. ``We 
put the past behind us, what all we had heard, and we're just 
looking at the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stallings planned to hit the telephones Thursday night to talk  
to potential recruits. Vanderbilt did not sign any players during 
the fall signing period and has three scholarships available when 
the spring signing period begins Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Breda Kolff was 104-81 at Vanderbilt, including a 14-15  
record this past season. He managed only one trip to the NCAA 
tournament, in 1998.

<HEADLINE> 'The Weir' Is a Real Workout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *An AP Entertainment Review    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Ghosts. Fairies. Dead children.  
</P>
<P>
	The fine art of storytelling gets quite a workout in ``The  
Weir,'' Irish playwright Conor McPherson's tantalizing collection 
of tales that are both supernatural and all too human. 
</P>
<P>
	The play, a London success that has now opened at Broadway's  
Walter Kerr Theater, makes for an unusual evening, static in terms 
of action but remarkably theatrical in its vivid use of language. 
It's also terrifically acted by four men and one woman, an ensemble 
worthy of a group Tony Award for its absolute fidelity to 
McPherson's very specific, often difficult material. 
</P>
<P>
	The stories are told against the backdrop of a small dilapidated  
bar in rural Ireland. What sparks their telling is the appearance 
of a young woman from Dublin, who has just moved to the country. 
</P>
<P>
	The stylish lass dazzles the four local residents, who try to  
impress her with their eerie experiences. These memories from the 
past force all of them to pause, wonder and then shiver in 
recognition about the strangeness of it all. 
</P>
<P>
	The 27-year-old McPherson has an ear for quirky facts, odd bits  
of information that reveal character. ``You have to relish the 
details,'' says Jack, the play's most garrulous and engaging 
character. He begins the evening's storytelling. 
</P>
<P>
	Jack tells of strange knockings at the doors and windows of a  
house owned by an elderly neighbor. The noises are never explained 
but then the woman's dwelling was built right over the fairy road, 
a mysterious thoroughfare that brings the little creatures down to 
the village. 
</P>
<P>
	Played to the hilt by Jim Norton, Jack, with a red face and  
white hair, is a stereotype of the genial, pint-loving Irishman. 
The man has charm and blarney to spare. Yet McPherson -- and Norton 
-- take the character a step further. 
</P>
<P>
	The second raconteur, Finbar, is the most financially successful  
of the lot. The owner of a nearby hotel, he tells of the conjuring 
of a spirit -- by a ``Luigi'' board -- that haunts not only a 
neighbor, but himself as well. Dermot Crowley gives the man a bit 
of sly worldliness, a quality that eludes the other less 
sophisticated characters. 
</P>
<P>
	Shy Jim, on the other hand, lives with his mother. He tells the  
spooky story of a grave-digging experience in a nearby town -- and 
why no local residents would help dig the grave. His manner of 
storytelling is simple and direct, which only adds to the unnerving 
quality of his tale. Kieran Ahern's portrait of Jim is a model of 
understatement. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet it is Valerie's remembrance that tops them all, a horrific  
personal recollection that evokes the strongest response -- silence 
-- from this usually talkative group. Michelle Fairley's Valerie is 
coolly unemotional, which gives even more power to what she has to 
say. 
</P>
<P>
	The bartender, beautifully brought to life by Brendan Coyle,  
doesn't tell a story. He doesn't have to. His unassuming character 
is right there in the little things he says and does, particularly 
in his quiet admiration of Valerie. Watch how he pours her a glass 
of wine or guides her into the house behind the pub to locate a 
bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
	When the ghostly tales are through, Jack has another story to  
spin, the memory of a love lost that is heartbreaking in its 
matter-of-factness and Jack's quiet acceptance of what didn't 
happen. 
</P>
<P>
	Ian Rickson's direction is deliberately understated. He simply  
lets the stories be straightforwardly told on the dimly lighted 
stage. 
</P>
<P>
	The title ``The Weir,'' by the way, refers to a dam, which  
regulates the water for generating power in the area. A photograph 
of the men who built it hangs in the pub. Many are relatives of the 
men who are drinking there now. 
</P>
<P>
	McPherson and his director have said it is Valerie's story that  
acts as if it were a weir, unleashing feelings in these four men 
they never thought they had. 
</P>
<P>
	These emotions dominate the play. Although the dialogue may be a  
trifle arcane for American audiences and the Walter Kerr a bit too 
big a theater to hear everything clearly, McPherson's conversations 
exude a passionate poetry that is haunting. If you listen carefully 
enough, ``The Weir'' will touch your heart.

<HEADLINE> Wheat Plantings Expected To Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- This season's wheat plantings could be the  
lowest in 26 years while soybean production will likely rise, the 
Agriculture Department said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn growers also intend to reduce their acreage. Farmers have  
indicated they will plant 78.2 million acres of corn, down 2 
percent from last year, USDA said. If the intentions materialize, 
it will be the lowest planted corn acreage since 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn acreages are down in the upper Midwest, Southwest, Texas  
and Southeast as farmers try to shift to more profitable crops. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat plantings are expected to total 63 million acres this  
season, down 4 percent from last year but the lowest in 26 years, 
the government said. 
</P>
<P>
	While other areas saw dips in planting intentions, soybean  
producers intend to plant 73.1 million acres in 1999, up 1 percent 
from last year. If realized, it will be the largest planted area 
for soybeans on record. 
</P>
<P>
	The planting estimates are based on surveys of more than 57,000  
producers across the country. 
</P>
<P>
	The shift in plantings comes after a year when farmers saw their  
prices drop to record low levels, largely due to a worldwide grain 
glut and the Asian economic crisis. Congress passed a $6 billion 
emergency aid package late last year, but many farmers have had 
trouble recovering. The government predicts low prices will linger 
for much of this year.

<HEADLINE> BP Amoco Acquisition Means Layoffs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) -- BP Amoco officials sent a clear message  
to Alaskans Thursday after announcing their purchase of Atlantic 
Richfield Co.: Don't panic. 
</P>
<P>
	True, the $25.6 billion deal leaves nearly all of Alaska's oil  
production in the hands of one company. And it's likely to mean 
another 400 well-paying oil jobs will disappear from Alaska, said 
company spokesman Paul Laird. 
</P>
<P>
	But at a news conference in BP Amoco's Alaska headquarters,  
managing director Richard Olver said the deal would mean more money 
for Alaska in the long run. By saving about $200 million annually 
in the state, the combined company would be able to invest more 
money and boost production on Alaska's North Slope, Olver said. 
</P>
<P>
	The combined company will control more than 70 percent of the  
13-billion barrel Prudhoe Bay field and own 73 percent of the 
trans-Alaska oil pipeline, but the companies reject the idea that 
such consolidation represents monopoly power. The pipeline's rates 
are controlled by state and federal regulators, Olver said, and 
environmental and production questions are closely watched by 
several state agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger will lead to some job losses, Laird said. The 400  
jobs represent about 17 percent of the total work force of the two 
companies in Alaska. Announcement of those expected cuts comes two 
months after BP Amoco laid off 400 workers in Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
	But BP Amoco tried to dispel worries that its dominant position  
would give it too much sway over the state's economy and 
government. 
</P>
<P>
	Olver said the company would give back enough acreage now under  
lease to comply with a 500,000-acre cap on the amount of state land 
a single company may control. BP Amoco also plans to spend $5 
billion on Alaska oil field development during the next five years 
-- more than the existing separate spending plans of each company. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps most importantly for Alaska's future, BP Amoco has  
promised to build a $70 million pilot plant on the North Slope that 
would convert Alaska's enormous natural gas supplies into a 
room-temperature liquid that could be shipped down the trans-Alaska 
oil pipeline. Those natural gas reserves are seen as a store of 
wealth to be exploited during the next several decades.

<HEADLINE> Gore Raises $7M, Bush Raises $6M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In the race for money, presidential hopefuls  
George Bush and Al Gore are staking out huge early leads that far 
surpass the early totals for the previous wide-open race for the 
White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore has raised at least $7 million so far this year for his bid  
for the Democratic nomination, aides close to his campaign said. 
Gore tapped more than 40,000 donors, 77 percent of whom gave less 
than $200 each, said the aides, who expect the final figure to be 
slightly higher because money was still rolling in Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The vice president's total is double the expected $3  
million-plus that his lone Democratic challenger, former senator 
and professional basketball star Bill Bradley, expects to report 
for the same period, according to Bradley aides. 
</P>
<P>
	In Austin, Texas, Gov. Bush announced he has been raising money  
at a $2 million-a-week clip since he formed his presidential 
exploratory committee March 4 and will finish the month with more 
than $6 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The total is eye-catching because the Texas governor, unlike  
Gore, has not hosted a single fund-raiser yet or even formally 
announced his candidacy. All of the GOP hopeful's money was raised 
through telephone and mail appeals, his aides said. Gore has had 
four fund-raising events so far. 
</P>
<P>
	The total is also important because Bush, if he runs, is  
considering forgoing federal financing provided to presidential 
candidates in the primaries so he can free himself from spending 
limits and better compete with millionaire publisher Steve Forbes 
for the GOP nomination. Forbes is spending much of his own money 
and has not provided his fund-raising totals. 
</P>
<P>
	To forgo federal matching funds, experts predict Bush will have  
to raise $50 million or more, substantially more than the $30 
million President Clinton raised as a popular incumbent in his 
primary re-election in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a great start, but I recognize that we have a lot of  
work ahead,'' Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other potential GOP presidential candidates such as Sen. John  
McCain of Arizona, former Vice President Dan Quayle, conservative 
activist Gary Bauer and former Red Cross chairwoman Elizabeth Dole 
are all expected to finish the first three months of 1999 with $3 
million or less in fund raising. 
</P>
<P>
	Both the Texas governor and Gore have raised money far faster  
than former President Bush did in the first quarter of 1987 when, 
as the vice president vying to replace Ronald Reagan in an open 
race, he raised $2.4 million and was the top fund-raiser in either 
party. 
</P>
<P>
	The record for the first three months of a two-year presidential  
election cycle still belongs to Texas Sen. Phil Gramm, who raised 
more than $8 million in the first quarter of 1995 for a GOP 
presidential bid that eventually stalled and died. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gore and Bush efforts continue a trend over the last decade  
in which candidates raise money faster and earlier as states have 
compressed their primary election schedules to the early part of 
2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's because the big states involved, California and New York,  
have pushed up their primaries so much and they are very expensive 
states,'' said Herb Alexander, a professor emeritus at the 
University of Southern California who has studied political 
fund-raising for four decades. ``And that is the biggest problem 
for candidates coming out of relatively inexpensive states like 
Iowa and New Hampshire -- there's not enough time to raise money 
after then.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``In 1976, Jimmy Carter had something like five weeks after New  
Hampshire and the next primary and that was the time he could raise 
money, but that doesn't exist anymore,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's campaign is stressing its smaller donations, hoping to  
distance the vice president from the 1996 Clinton fund-raising 
controversies over big donors. ``We have gotten support from people 
of all levels, from farmers to doctors and small business people to 
retired people, and we are very grateful,'' campaign manager Craig 
Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	The presidential candidates will formally report their totals to  
the Federal Election Commission on April 15.

<HEADLINE> 'Penthouse' Publisher To Evict Son </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Penthouse publisher Bob Guccione may evict his  
son from a $1.5 million apartment the son claims was a gift, a 
judge ruled. 
</P>
<P>
	Anthony Guccione, 38, has lived in the loft since 1987. He said  
his father gave it to him for doing well at Harvard and for joining 
the family business. 
</P>
<P>
	But Judge Shirley Werner Kornreich said the elder Guccione kept  
the apartment in his name and there was no proof he had given it to 
his son. 
</P>
<P>
	The elder Guccione would not comment. His son said he will  
appeal. The two don't speak. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel very aggrieved by what I see as my father's dirty  
tricks and harassment tactics for the 2 1/2 years since I left the 
company,'' the son said. 
</P>
<P>
	Anthony was vice president of General Media Inc., Penthouse's  
parent company. He left in 1997 because of what he termed 
differences with his father over the way the corporation should be 
run. He said he is now an entrepreneur developing film and new 
media projects.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Says Strikes Need Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton says NATO allies and the  
American public need to show resolve with the air campaign against 
Yugoslavia, now in its second week. Despite a growing humanitarian 
crisis, Clinton remains opposed to sending in U.S. ground troops. 
</P>
<P>
	``This air campaign is not a 30-second ad,'' he said in an  
interview Wednesday with CBS News anchor Dan Rather. ``It's only 
been going on a few days. ... And I'd like to see us keep working 
on this and not have our attention diverted by other things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As Serb forces appear to be pushing ethnic Albanians out of  
Kosovo into neighboring countries, critics of Clinton's Kosovo 
policy increasingly are saying an air-power-only approach will not 
bring Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to the peace table. 
</P>
<P>
	``The thing that bothers me about introducing ground troops into  
a hostile situation -- into Kosovo and into the Balkans -- is the 
prospect of never being able to get them out,'' Clinton told CBS. 
</P>
<P>
	Citing reports that Serb forces were stripping ethnic Albanians  
of documents that prove their citizenship, and slaughtering 
politicians and others, Clinton blamed Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are acting at a time when he's going through the country,  
killing people, according to reports, including moderate 
politicians, trying to destroy records of what their landholdings 
are, trying to eradicate any historical record of their claim to 
their own land,'' Clinton said. ``And he has given no indication 
that he is prepared to stop the aggression.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton made the remarks before Pentagon and NATO officials  
learned that three U.S. soldiers on a reconnaissance mission in 
Macedonia along the Yugoslav border had been captured by hostile 
forces. 
</P>
<P>
	The three were attached to one of several Army units guarding  
the border during the ongoing NATO airstrikes. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was visiting Navy personnel and their families today at  
the Norfolk (Va.) Naval Air Station to recognize their contribution 
to NATO's campaign to halt the killing in Kosovo. He also was 
meeting with Adm. Harold W. Gehman Jr., the supreme allied 
commander of the Atlantic for NATO. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO has requested that the Norfolk-based Theodore Roosevelt  
battle group -- which includes an aircraft carrier, two cruisers, a 
destroyer, a frigate and an attack submarine -- be sent to support 
NATO's Yugoslavia campaign. Administration officials couldn't say 
Wednesday night whether Clinton would approve the request. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas, Clinton's Republican opponent in  
the 1996 presidential campaign who before the airstrikes tried to 
broker peace in Yugoslavia at Clinton's behest, said use of U.S. 
ground troops there should not be ruled out. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to see ground troops go in ... in a combat mode  
into Kosovo, but I'm suggesting it should always be an option, and, 
if necessary, it should be exercised,'' he said Wednesday on 
ABC-TV's ``Nightline'' program. 
</P>
<P>
	Reflecting on World War II, Dole said: ``My generation, we stood  
by and watched genocide and we promised ourselves and everybody 
else it would never happen again. Now if this (Kosovo) isn't 
genocide, then I fail to understand the definition, and it's been 
going on for seven years. ... 
</P>
<P>
	``There are times that you can invade a sovereign nation or go  
after a leader in a sovereign nation for his conduct, and I think 
this is one of those times,'' Dole added. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John Warner, R-Va., chairman of the Senate Armed Services  
Committee, said he believed Milosevic was just weeks away from his 
goal of ethnic cleansing, making time too short to position ground 
troops in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``That option, practically speaking, is not there,'' Warner said  
on PBS' ``NewsHour With Jim Lehrer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton turned aside a request from Pope John Paul II to suspend  
the bombing over the Easter weekend, saying it would give Milosevic 
carte blanche to step up his aggression. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't observe Easter and honor the resurrection of Christ  
by allowing him another free day to kill more innocent civilians,'' 
Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The captured Army team had been on a daytime reconnaissance  
mission in the Kumanovo area of Macedonia near the southern 
Yugoslavia border when they reported ``they received small arms 
fire and said they were surrounded,'' according to NATO. 
</P>
<P>
	Pentagon officials said from the outset that they feared the  
soldiers had been captured by Serb military or police. White House 
officials said Clinton was informed of the incident Wednesday 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	In other developments Wednesday:  
</P>
<P>
	--The Clinton administration said it would airlift supplies in a  
$50 million aid effort to benefit the more than 100,000 ethnic 
Albanian refugees who have fled Kosovo ahead of a Serb offensive. 
</P>
<P>
	--Russia said it was sending seven warships to the Mediterranean  
in response to the NATO airstrikes against Yugoslavia, but White 
House press secretary Joe Lockhart said the United States has 
assurances the Russians wouldn't enter the conflict. ``The Russian 
government, at all levels that I'm aware of, have made very clear 
that they have no intention of becoming involved in this 
conflict,'' Lockhart said.

<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton says NATO allies and the  
American public need to show resolve with the air campaign against 
Yugoslavia, now in its second week. Despite a growing humanitarian 
crisis, Clinton remains opposed to sending in U.S. ground troops. 
</P>
<P>
	``This air campaign is not a 30-second ad,'' he said in an  
interview Wednesday with CBS News anchor Dan Rather. ``It's only 
been going on a few days. ... And I'd like to see us keep working 
on this and not have our attention diverted by other things.''

<HEADLINE> Good Morning America Ratings Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The bleeding has stopped at ABC's ``Good Morning  
America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bringing in Diane Sawyer and Charles Gibson as hosts has paid  
off in heartening ratings news for the troubled morning show. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first three months of 1999, ``Good Morning America''  
increased its average audience to 3.93 million from 3.29 million in 
the fourth quarter of 1998, according to Nielsen Media Research 
figures released Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The ABC morning program is still second to NBC's ``Today,''  
which had an average audience of 6.15 million people. CBS's ``This 
Morning'' was third with 3.08 million, Nielsen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sawyer and Gibson began as temporary hosts in January when the  
ratings slide at ``Good Morning America'' accelerated. ABC isn't 
talking about how long the new team will stay on the air. But 
success may mean continued early-morning wakeup calls for both of 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, we're pleased that people are tuning in,'' said  
Sonya McNair, ABC spokeswoman. ``As we all know, this is a 
marathon. We've said from the beginning our focus remains on 
improving the broadcast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Good Morning America'' ratings are still virtually  
identical to those for the first three months of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today'' had its second highest quarterly rating ever,  
executive producer Jeff Zucker said. Only the first three months of 
last year, when the Monica Lewinsky scandal broke, were higher for 
NBC's dominant morning show. 
</P>
<P>
	About a million more people watched the three network morning  
news shows during the first quarter than during the last three 
months of 1998. Zucker said some increase in viewership is common 
when people return to their routines after the holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think everybody can find something good in this for  
themselves,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS has to be concerned, however, about the increased distance  
between ``This Morning'' and ``Good Morning America.'' CBS is 
talking to former ``Today'' host Bryant Gumbel about returning to 
morning television on ``This Morning.''

<HEADLINE> N.M. Police Probe Sex Torture Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ELEPHANT BUTTE, N.M. (AP) -- Investigators have begun excavating  
around the lakeside trailer where two women said they were held in 
chains and sexually tortured, and today they brought in a dog. 
</P>
<P>
	A state-federal task force grew to nearly 100 investigators  
probing and digging around the home 150 miles south of Albuquerque. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are doing some selective digging by hand,'' FBI agent Doug  
Beldon said Wednesday. ``We're looking for some things that might 
be concealed subsurface.'' 
</P>
<P>
	David Parker Ray, 59, and Cynthia Lea Hendy, 39, have been  
charged with numerous crimes, including kidnapping, sexual abuse, 
battery and conspiracy. Two women accused the pair of holding them 
in separate days-long incidents of torture. 
</P>
<P>
	There has been no indication that bodies have been found, but  
authorities have not ruled out the possibility of homicides. An 
acquaintance said Ms. Hendy told him Ray had killed four to six 
people, mutilated the bodies and dumped them in Elephant Butte 
Lake. 
</P>
<P>
	She said other bodies were buried in the desert, the  
acquaintance said. 
</P>
<P>
	Agents used hand shovels, metal detectors and electronic probes  
to measure soil density around the home for any signs of recent 
excavation or burial. Beldon said they were looking for items 
listed in a search warrant, which was not released. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Ron Lopez said defense attorneys on Wednesday waived  
arraignment on the criminal complaint and trial was tentatively set 
for April 12. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys for both defendants said their clients are innocent.  
</P>
<P>
	``Quite frankly, there are no bodies,'' said Xavier Acosta,  
lawyer for Ms. Hendy. ``I believe Ms. Hendy is unjustly being tied 
to these matters just because of her association (with Ray).'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ray's co-workers said they were shocked by the allegations.  
</P>
<P>
	``He was the neatest, cleanest, politest person you could ever  
want to meet,'' said Glen Parks, a volunteer who works at the 
Elephant Butte State Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Ray was a maintenance worker at the park for about five years,  
fixing vehicles and heavy machinery, said his boss Jerome Madrid. 
</P>
<P>
	``He showed up, he did his job, we depended on him,'' Madrid  
said.

<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- American swimmer Jenny Thompson broke her own  
world record by more than one second Friday in the 100-meter 
individual medley during qualifying heats in the World Short Course 
Swimming Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	In the preceding heat, Slovakia's Martina Moravcova had broken  
Thompson's 2-month-old record of 1 minute, 0.41 seconds with a time 
of 1:00.35. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson responded with a 59.30 despite not being challenged in  
the heat. Runnerup Han Xue of China finished in 1:02.53. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson, who holds world records in two other events, had  
finished second-fastest earlier in the morning in qualifying for 
the 50-meter butterfly. Her time of 26.71 was behind her world mark 
of 26.05 and second to Dutch swimmer Inge de Briujn's 26.16. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to semifinals in the 100 medley and 50 butterfly,  
Thompson was to swim Friday night in the 100 freestyle final. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time in a world swimming championship, FINA, the

<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Henriette Delille, a descendant of slaves, is  
the first U.S.-born black person whose cause for canonization has 
been officially opened by the Catholic Church. Her story has drawn 
support from Maine to San Francisco to Central America. It has also 
piqued the interest of Hollywood, to her supporters' dismay. 
</P>
<P>
	Entertainer Vanessa L. Williams has plans to chronicle Delille's  
life in a made-for-TV movie, ``The Quadroon Ball.'' Supporters 
worry the movie could negatively affect the 10-year-old 
canonization cause, but Williams' spokesman says her film will be 
inspirational. 
</P>
<P>
	Delille, who died in 1862, preached to New Orleans slaves and  
free black people at a time when it was illegal. She then founded 
Sisters of the Holy Family, a religious community servingthe 
elderly, ignorant and dying. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without her courage and strong faith this community would not  
have existed,'' said Sister Sylvia Thibodeaux. ``We revere her 
memory and want the universal church to share in it and in the 
beauty of her life and her contributions. This is a gift for the 
church, not just the African-American church, but to the universal 
church.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The order maintains a ``Henriette Delille office,'' where a nun  
sorts about 100 letters a week: placing in one spot contributions, 
usually $5 or $10, and in another, correspondence reporting granted 
``favors,'' such as a relative getting a special job. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now and then we get letters from people mentioning things that  
appear to be miracles,'' a requirement for canonization, she said, 
``but there's nothing definitive yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The money helps research Delille's life and covers the cost of  
mailing prayer cards that include a history of Delille's work. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our mailing list has grown to about six or seven thousand,''  
said Sister Thibodeaux. ``We are doing whatever we can to make her 
known, through legitimate sources.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Delille guilds have been established in various parts of the  
country, including Louisiana, Texas, Ohio and Pennsylvania, and in 
the Central American nation of Belize. 
</P>
<P>
	Father Cyprian Davis, a Benedictine monk at St. Meinrad  
Archabbey in St. Meinrad, Ind., hopes to have a draft of a 
comprehensive biography ready for review by summer. The result of 
years of research at archives in the United States, Rome and 
France, it will then be compiled into a report for the Vatican. 
</P>
<P>
	There it will be examined again by the Congregation of Saints.  
If they find no contradictions, Delille would be declared 
``venerable'' and the panel would recommend that she ``is a woman 
of heroic virtue whose life merits being recognized as 
extraordinary, as a saint,'' said Charles E. Nolan, archivist for 
the Archdiocese of New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Then, the next step is up to God,'' Sister Thibodeaux said.  
``The next step is a miracle. People are praying to her because a 
miracle is required for beatification.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Delille was a descendant of freed slaves whose great-grandmother  
and godmother accumulated property in 18th century New Orleans and 
became wealthy. 
</P>
<P>
	Her great-great grandmother, Marie Ann, was owned by Claude  
Joseph Dubreuil, the royal engineer of the King of France, who 
built much of south Louisiana's canal and levee network. He also 
fathered three of her children, who took his surname after they 
were freed in the 1760s and 1770s. 
</P>
<P>
	In her teens, Delille and a few friends took it upon themselves  
to begin preaching to the city's slaves and free nonwhites. By 
1836, the women had organized into a confraternity, which was 
legally incorporated in 1847. A year later, they bought land to 
build a home for the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
	Using part of her inheritance and borrowing the rest, Delille  
bought a house for religious education of nonwhites. At the time, 
Nolan notes, educating nonwhites was against the law in Louisiana. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is documentation showing these women did not gloss over  
the prejudice, the difficulties, the hardships,'' he said. ``Still, 
there's not a note of bitterness -- and that's one of the gifts she 
had, the ability to step beyond all of the hurt and prejudice and 
take the next step, to do what God called them to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After her death, the order expanded and flourished. By the turn  
of the century, the community had a novitiate plus eight other 
schools, orphanages and homes for the aged in New Orleans. They 
also staffed three convent schools elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	Sisters of the Holy Family formally initiated the cause for  
canonization in 1989. The process is at a critical point, Sister 
Thibodeaux said, and that is why she is concerned about Vanessa 
Williams' TV plans. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've surely done such limited research on Mother  
Henriette's story, it's not possible to do it justice. We don't 
want her image marred in any way,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Brad Cafarelli, a publicist for Williams, said the producers  
have tried unsuccessfully to reach the nuns and plan to include 
them in planning for the program, whose script is being written and 
whose air date is uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
	``Neither Ms. Williams nor the other producers have any desire  
to jeopardize the canonization of Henriette Delille,'' Cafarelli 
said. ``It is their intention to produce an inspirational motion 
picture chronicling this incredible woman's life and work and to 
bring awareness to her impact as a Catholic and a woman of color.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sister Thibodeaux said she simply wants Delille's full story  
told. ``It's a miracle in itself,'' she said, ``when you consider 
the times we were founded and the sufferings earlier members went 
through.''

<HEADLINE> Govt. Audit Finds Woeful Accounting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The federal government could use a few good  
CPAs to keep track of everything from bullets to Medicare payments. 
</P>
<P>
	The second annual governmentwide audit by the congressional  
General Accounting Office found that 24 major agencies are doing a 
poor overall job of keeping their financial books. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet the audit released Wednesday actually was a cause for some  
optimism, because things weren't quite as bad in fiscal 1998 as the 
year before. 
</P>
<P>
	``Progress is coming, but we've sure got a lot to do,'' said  
Rep. Steve Horn, R-Calif., chairman of the House Government Reform 
subcommittee on government management, information and technology. 
</P>
<P>
	Comptroller General David Walker, who heads the GAO, told the  
panel that 24 major federal agencies do not properly account for a 
majority of the $466 billion in assets they hold. These range from 
buildings to heavy equipment to ammunition. 
</P>
<P>
	It does not necessarily mean the assets are missing, although  
some are. But it shows most government agencies do not have the 
basic financial controls that are commonplace in any private 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	``If small-business owners kept books like this, they'd be put  
in jail,'' House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, said today. 
``The federal government calls this an improvement from last year. 
I don't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The government's financial statements, Walker said, ``do not  
provide a reliable source of information for decision-making by the 
government or the public.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The audit showed numerous other problems, including inadequate  
data on loans and liabilities such as veterans' benefits, poor 
computer security, vast underestimates for costs such as 
environmental and nuclear cleanups and even lack of documentation 
to support the expense of many day-to-day government operations. 
</P>
<P>
	While the full extent of improper payments made by government  
agencies is unknown, the Health and Human Services Department 
estimated that $12.6 billion of its fee-for-service Medicare 
payments -- about 7 percent -- should not have been made in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet that is down from $23.2 billion in 1996, which Walker cited  
as an example of why accurate accounting matters. When the problem 
can be measured and analyzed, he said, government managers can 
better focus on finding solutions. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, Horn released his own ``report card'' that graded  
federal agencies in three financial categories: reliable 
information, effective internal controls and compliance with laws 
and regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	Horn gave only NASA and the National Science Foundation an  
``A'', while 12 agencies either got an ``F'' or had not submitted 
their statements as required by Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``If these were my kids and their report cards, they'd be  
grounded,'' said Rep. Tom Davis, R-Va. ``This is just 
unacceptable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite all these problems, the Clinton administration's Office  
of Management and Budget expects 13 of the 24 agencies to receive 
``clean'' audits of their financial statements in fiscal 1998. That 
compares with only one in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	``Given where we were in 1993 and the obstacles we faced, the  
progress we have made to date is extraordinary,'' said Edward 
DeSeve, OMB deputy director for management. ``We are working hard 
to resolve the problems, but much work remains to be done.''

<HEADLINE> Gas Hike Hits California Hard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- In car-crazy California, a dramatic hike in  
gas prices -- close to $2 a gallon in some spots -- is stirring up 
frustration and resentment reminiscent of the 1970s energy crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	``It angers me,'' said Robert Sumber, 39, who was filling up a  
car instead of his gas-guzzling pickup truck on Thursday to try to 
save money. ``You need to drive here. What can you do?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prices everywhere in the country have jumped with OPEC  
announcing production cuts to boost sagging oil prices, but 
California has been hit especially hard. 
</P>
<P>
	Fires at two refineries in Northern California cut into  
supplies, and the state's decision to remove a chemical additive 
from gasoline helped boost the cost, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
	Some consumer-rights activists say it's really a case of  
price-gouging. 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever the causes, the result is clear: Californians are  
paying an average of $1.46 for a gallon of regular gasoline, up 
from $1.12 a gallon just a month ago, said Aileen Bohn, a 
spokeswoman for the Washington-based Energy Information 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationwide, the average is $1.08 per gallon.  
</P>
<P>
	This is especially bad news for drivers in a state known as much  
for its cars as its sun. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't afford these prices when every dollar counts,'' said  
Kristina Whelan, a 19-year-old Spanish literature major at the 
University of California, Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	A television station has broadcast a hot line for cheap gas, and  
some stations are advertising the best deals in town during 
newscasts. 
</P>
<P>
	The anger is resonating on the Internet, too. A chain e-mail  
making the rounds Thursday called on Californians not to buy gas on 
April 30 to show their outrage. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's have a GAS OUT!'' it read.  
</P>
<P>
	A community group planned a news conference Friday to denounce  
what it called price-gouging and to ask the government to 
intervene. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of the parents are expressing the anger because they are  
now having to decide, make a choice between purchasing gasoline and 
milk,'' said the Rev. Lowe Barry, one of the activists. ``Gas is 
nearly $2 a gallon and milk is at least $3.50 a gallon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Asmann, owner of two Exxon stations in Pleasanton, a city  
of 60,000 in Northern California, raised his prices an average of 
12 cents a gallon Wednesday and was selling his premium for $1.99 
and nine-tenths. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've ordered the number 2 for my signs,'' he said. ``I never  
thought I'd have to use them, but now I don't know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Six weeks ago, it was possible to find 99-cent gas in San Jose.  
With the hikes, some stations were selling gas for $1.61 a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it will be a long time before we see 99-cent gas  
again,'' said Jerry Cummings, co-owner of a company that owns 
Rotten Robbie stations. 
</P>
<P>
	Oil industry analysts point to recent fires at two refineries in  
the state that limited production. 
</P>
<P>
	Another possible cause is Gov. Gray Davis' recent order to phase  
out the use of methyl tertiary butyl ether, or MTBE, an oxygenate 
added to gasoline to make it burn cleaner. Research has shown that 
the compound causes tumors in rats and may do so in humans. 
</P>
<P>
	Finding a replacement for MTBE -- which was thought to be  
necessary to help the state comply with clean-air laws -- could be 
costly. 
</P>
<P>
	Add a sizable state tax of 18 cents per gallon and a 7.25  
percent sales tax, and California's gas is among the most expensive 
in the nation. Motorists everywhere pay 18.4 cents per gallon in 
federal taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Relief may be in sight, however.  
</P>
<P>
	Oil companies are shoring up supplies by bringing in fuel from  
the oil-rich Gulf of Mexico and tankers near Los Angeles ``to take 
advantage of this price differential,'' Ms. Bohn said. 
</P>
<P>
	She couldn't specify when that might happen, however.

<HEADLINE> Fan Sues Trail Blazers' Rider </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Portland guard Isaiah Rider, suspended for  
the third time this season after climbing into the stands during a 
loss to Golden State, is being sued by a fan who claims Rider spit 
on him in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Zajuan Nenrod has filed suit against the Blazers and Rider,  
saying Rider spit on him without provocation during the halftime 
warmup of the Blazers' Nov. 20, 1997 game against the Detroit 
Pistons in Auburn Hills, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit, filed last week in Oakland County Circuit Court, seeks  
$25,000 for mental distress and humiliation plus court and lawyer 
fees. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither the Blazers nor the National Basketball Players  
Association have denied Rider spit on the fan. The NBA suspended 
Rider for three games for the incident. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, Billy Hunter, executive director of the players  
association, said Rider was provoked by a ``visibly drunken fan who 
physically and verbally threatened J.R. and his family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was not the only transgression for Rider.  
</P>
<P>
	He sat out Wednesday's 100-86 victory over Sacramento at the  
Rose Garden -- his third suspension this season and second in 12 
days. 
</P>
<P>
	He was suspended for going into the stands with two minutes left  
in Tuesday night's loss at Golden State. Rider went about 10 rows 
up at The New Arena, where his brother was involved in an argument 
that brought security to the area. 
</P>
<P>
	It was also learned Wednesday that Rider has received his second  
multiple-violation traffic stop in five weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Rider received a traffic citation on March 19 for driving  
without a license, driving without insurance and ``speed racing'' 
in Portland. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the third time in two years that Rider was cited for  
driving without a license and state records confirmed that Rider 
does not have an Oregon driver's license. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not clear whether Rider has a license to drive in  
California, where he lives much of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Blazers president Bob Whitsitt declined to comment on the  
traffic violation and lawsuit saying he was ``not aware of either 
of those things.''

<HEADLINE> Skyscraper Jumper Pleads Guilty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A Norwegian man who parachuted off the city's  
three tallest buildings, including the 110-story World Trade 
Center, pleaded guilty Thursday to three counts of reckless 
endangerment. 
</P>
<P>
	Thor Axel Kappfjell, 32, admitted he jumped from the Empire  
State Building last Oct. 24, the Chrysler Building on Oct. 27 and 
the World Trade Center on March 25. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Laura Visitacion-Lewis ordered Kappfjell, of Drammen,  
Norway, to do seven days of community service. Once completed, he 
can withdraw his guilty plea to the felony counts and plead guilty 
to lesser misdemeanor counts of reckless endangerment. 
</P>
<P>
	Kappfjell said he had planned to jump from the Trade Center in  
November, but fled New York after Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and police 
put him on their wanted lists. He was arrested in a hotel the day 
after he floated off the roof of one of the Trade Center's twin 
towers. 
</P>
<P>
	Kappfjell says he has jumped from more than 200 mountains and  
bridges. He told the Oslo newspaper Dagbladet, ``I promise not to 
bother New York anymore.''

<HEADLINE> Beef Industry Pushes Prepared Meals / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Taking a cue from pre-packaged salads,  
pre-shredded cheeses and pre-sliced luncheon meats, the beef 
industry has introduced a new line of meals made easy. 
</P>
<P>
	The industry is pushing pot roast and prime rib, meatloaf and  
meatballs -- all fully cooked and ready to microwave and serve in 10 
minutes. Cattlemen also have spent $25 million on marketing. 
</P>
<P>
	The media blitz, which began this week, revives the slogan  
``Beef. It's What's For Dinner,'' and features voice-overs from 
actor Sam Elliott. Among the companies offering these microwave 
products are Burnett &AMP; Son, Jimmy Dean and Lloyd's Barbecue. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers say they simply do not have time anymore to cook beef  
dinners, said George Swan, an Idaho rancher who is president of the 
National Cattleman's Beef Association. 
</P>
<P>
	``They say, `We're looking for convenient ways to provide a good  
meal for our families and for ourselves,''' Swan said. ``If you go 
home and make a pot roast it could take a couple of hours, and that 
isn't their choice or their desire.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But some Dallas grocery shoppers, like Emily Seibel, say they  
have no interest in buying precooked beef. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love to cook. I find it very relaxing,'' Ms. Seibel, 41,  
said while going through the beef section of a Dallas supermarket. 
``I like meat. I just like the way I prepare it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barbara Saccal of Addison said she also prefers to cook her own  
beef. ``I like to get my meat fresh. It costs a little more but 
it's worth it,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	That sentiment does not worry Burt Rutherford, spokesman for the  
Texas Cattle Feeders Association in Amarillo. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will always be those kinds of people, and thank goodness  
there are,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Swan said the demand for beef has declined in the past 20 years,  
but it has leveled in the past year because of the popularity of 
high-protein diets. 
</P>
<P>
	``They find out beef is nutritious, it's a source of iron and  
it's a dense product with nutrients we need for a healthy body 
today,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The beef industry needs all the help it can get. High feed grain  
prices in 1996, cyclically large cattle numbers, record heavy 
slaughter weights and record supplies of pork and poultry have 
taken a toll, the National Cattlemen's Beef Association has said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chuck Lambert, the association's chief economist, said he  
expects beef production levels to decline through 2001, causing 
slightly higher prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The campaign also comes a year after Texas cattlemen sued talk  
show host Oprah Winfrey and lost. A federal jury in Amarillo ruled 
Ms. Winfrey did not defame the beef industry when a guest on her 
show in April 1996 said U.S. beef could be at risk of spreading mad 
cow disease.

<HEADLINE>  Schilling Ready To Pitch for Phils </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEARWATER, Fla. (AP) -- Curt Schilling can't wait for the trade  
deadline, but not for the reason you might think. 
</P>
<P>
	Schilling, who made it to his last spring training start  
Wednesday without getting traded, hopes the Philadelphia Phillies 
are ready to do some wheeling and dealing in July. 
</P>
<P>
	Just not the kind that involves him.  
</P>
<P>
	``A couple of clubs are a trade away or an injury away from  
being good or bad,'' said Schilling, who struck out seven and 
looked strong in his last tuneup before opening day. ``We'll just 
try to compete, win more than we lose and get better as the season 
goes. Who knows? Maybe in July, something happens and we go out and 
get a player who puts us in the mix.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After getting plenty of run support in a 10-4 victory over the  
Cincinnati Reds, it was no wonder Schilling was in an optimistic 
mood. A frequent subject of trade rumors, Schilling said he 
believes this is the second-best Phillies team he's played for -- 
the other being the 1993 team that lost to Toronto in the World 
Series. 
</P>
<P>
	Some baseball observers believe that the Phillies might finally  
have to cave in to the crush of trade offers for Schilling if 
they're out of the NL playoff race when the summer trade deadline 
approaches. Schilling isn't so sure it will come to that. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to score more runs. I don't think there's any  
question about that,'' Schilling said. ``We're going to be a good 
defensive club. I think the same question since '93 is going to be 
the same one this year: How good is our starting pitching going to 
be?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Every fifth day, it should be marvelous. Behind Schilling, the  
Phillies are counting on four relatively unproven starters to 
bridge the gap. 
</P>
<P>
	Chad Ogea, who never stayed in the majors for a full season  
before the Indians traded him, is the No. 2 starter. Carlton 
Loewer, Paul Byrd and Paul Spoljaric finish out the rotation. 
</P>
<P>
	Schilling, coming off consecutive seasons with 300 or more  
strikeouts, allowed three runs and seven hits in six innings and 
threw 108 pitches. He walked one and gave up a line-drive homer by 
Greg Vaughn in the third. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm healthy. My arm feels good,'' Schilling said. ``The  
slider's better than it's ever been. The curveball's better. The 
split's not where it has to be. What irked me was, I was getting 
ahead in the count, I thought I was making good pitches and I 
wasn't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schilling is already jacked up about his opening day in Atlanta  
against defending NL Cy Young award winner Tom Glavine. Manager 
Terry Francona said Schilling looks ready to throw about 120 
pitches in the opener. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he's very, very strong,'' Phillies manager Terry  
Francona said. 
</P>
<P>
	He allowed four straight hits in the first inning after striking  
out leadoff batter Mike Cameron. Barry Larkin's double was followed 
by singles from Sean Casey, Vaughn and Dmitri Young. Schilling was 
ahead in the count or even on each batter. 
</P>
<P>
	The hits by Casey and Young each drove in a run, and Schilling  
got out of the inning on Brian Johnson's double-play grounder. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd venture to guess that on all seven of my hits I was ahead  
with one strike or ahead with two,'' Schilling said. ``... What 
irked me was, I was getting ahead in the count, I thought I was 
making good pitches and I wasn't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schilling struck out the side and walked one in the fourth and  
got out of a first-and-third, one-out jam in the fifth. Vaughn 
flied to the wall in center, and Young struck out looking. 
</P>
<P>
	Schilling struck out swinging at a curveball from Brett Tomko in  
the fifth, taking exception to Tomko's pitch selection. Schilling 
glared at Tomko as the two walked back to the dugout, but didn't 
get to face him. Schilling retired the side in order in the sixth, 
blowing away Pokey Reese for his seventh strikeout with Tomko 
waiting on deck. 
</P>
<P>
	``Actually, I was laughing,'' Schilling said. ``Did you see the  
swing? You can hurt yourself swinging like that. Every time I think 
I'm an athlete, I change my mind when I take a swing like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's OK, Curt. It's usually the other way around.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Up Vs. Yen; Down Vs. Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar and euro rose against the yen  
Thursday as Japanese bank and corporate traders started dumping the 
Japanese currency they had accumulated to build up their balance 
sheets. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the dollar more than recouped its losses from Wednesday  
against the yen, the U.S. currency fell against the strengthened 
euro. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the euro was quoted at $1.0793, up  
from $1.0768 late Wednesday. The dollar also was quoted at 120.43 
Japanese yen, up from 118.97 yen on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the weeks preceding the end of the Japanese fiscal year on  
March 31, banks and corporations enhance their balance sheets by 
selling overseas assets. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, the first day of the new fiscal year, some of those  
Japanese banks and corporations started dumping their accumulated 
yen and reacquiring foreign assets after first buying the requisite 
foreign exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	``The big mover was dollar/yen and euro/yen. They were buying  
dollars and buying euros, both against the yen, the play du jour,'' 
said Robert Houck, a foreign exchange vice president at Norwest 
Bank Corp. in Minneapolis. ``Money flowed out of Japan and into 
Europe and the United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese buyers helped U.S. Treasury bonds during early New York  
trading, but bonds fell after a U.S. economic report showed strong 
manufacturing activity in March. The same happened with U.S. 
stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	The majority of transactions took place in Asian and early  
European trading before European investors left early ahead of the 
Good Friday holiday observance. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once the European market closed for the long weekend, the U.S.  
market took a little snooze,'' Houck said. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was quoted at 1.4808 Swiss francs, down from  
1.4827, and 1.4993 Canadian dollars, down from 1.5095. The British 
pound fell to $1.6041 from $1.6116. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on Wednesday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.8123 German 
marks, down from 1.8162; 6.0790 French francs, down from 6.0901; 
and 1,792.11 Italian lire, down from 1,798.56.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Rallies Military </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NORFOLK NAVAL BASE, Va. (AP) -- Looking out at a sea of people in  
uniform, their spouses and their children, President Clinton asked 
military families today to ``be determined and patient'' as they 
send off loved ones to stop a war in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	The president came here -- NATO's only military command in North  
America -- for his first meeting with American servicemen and women 
since U.S. troops were committed to NATO's campaign to force 
Slobodan Milosevic's Serbian forces from crushing the ethnic 
Albanians of Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	His arrival coincided with fresh concerns among military  
families over the capture of three U.S. soldiers along the 
Macedonia-Yugoslavia border, and the president tried to soothe 
those fears with a pledge to hold the Yugoslav president personally 
responsible if those soldiers are harmed. 
</P>
<P>
	``All Americans are concerned about their welfare,'' Clinton  
said. ``President Milosevic should make no mistake: The United 
States takes care of its own.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton saw no signs of dissent here at the world's largest Navy  
base. But there was some disapproval, more for his personal 
morality -- the subject of a year's investigation and impeachment 
trial -- than for his decision to use military force in Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would have to go in uniform and salute him, and I really  
don't have any respect for the guy,'' said Jason Sherbrook, 20, of 
Norfolk, a seaman who has been in the Navy two years and who went 
shopping at the Navy Exchange rather than attend the speech. 
</P>
<P>
	Sherbrook said he thinks Clinton is a good leader and he  
supported his Kosovo policy. But he said he disagreed with 
Clinton's ``moral beliefs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a strong believer in marriage vows, and I think what he  
did was a no-no,'' said Michael Colwell, 22, of Newport News, Va., 
a seaman for 2 1/2 years. He was referring to Clinton's relationship 
with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	Colwell said he also opposed U.S. military involvement in  
Kosovo. ``We shouldn't be meddling in other people's business,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Clinton was applauded a few times during his speech and  
about a third of the 1,200 people amassed between two F-18s in a 
cavernous hangar waited when he walked along the rope line, 
reaching out to outstretched hands. 
</P>
<P>
	In the speech, Clinton again pressed his case for NATO's  
intervention -- and for patience. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been doing this for seven days now, just seven days,''  
he said. ``Our pilots have performed bravely and well, in the face 
of dangerous conditions and often abysmal weather. But we must be 
determined and patient.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He argued against complacency, saying that America must act to  
prevent atrocities elsewhere in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't respond to every tragedy in every corner of the  
world,'' Clinton said. ``But just because we can't do everything 
for everyone doesn't mean that for the sake of consistency we 
should do nothing for no one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 7,400 service members are deployed for the Kosovo mission,  
with roughly 3,900 of them Navy, according to the White House. ``A 
substantial percentage'' of the Navy personnel are from Norfolk, 
said national security spokesman P.J. Crowley. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was met by Adm. Harold W. Gehman Jr., NATO's supreme  
allied commander for the Atlantic. Gehman accompanied Clinton to a 
house on base, where he spoke with about 20 family members who have 
a loved one in each branch of service. 
</P>
<P>
	The families told of the toll that military service takes in  
terms that were ``very pointed'' and ``full of candor,'' said Adm. 
J. Paul Reason, commander of the Atlantic fleet. 
</P>
<P>
	The spouses also voiced concerns about the captured soldiers,  
saying such an incident ``reaches into every home of those who are 
deployed,'' Reason said. ``For them, it's very personal. ``They 
wanted to make sure that the president understood that very clear 
fact that, in their homes, their husbands are off to war.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also spoke by telephone to military personnel at Aviano  
Air Base in Italy, where many of NATO's planes are based, just 
before they departed on a mission.

<HEADLINE> Howe Suspended From Daughter's Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WHITEFISH, Mont. (AP) -- Steve Howe, who was suspended seven  
times for drug and alcohol violations during his career as a big 
league pitcher, has been suspended as a volunteer coach for the 
Whitefish girls' softball team. 
</P>
<P>
	Howe was told he could no longer help the team on which his  
daughter, Chelsi, is a second baseman, pending the outcome of a 
background check by the Whitefish administration. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're in the process of reviewing the information that goes  
along with Steve and his past,'' said school superintendent Dave 
Peters. ``We're trying to determine what is in the best interest of 
the district. It's a very difficult issue for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said Howe may be reinstated after the check. Howe's past  
problems with drugs and alcohol are the focal point of the inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's an excellent coach,'' said senior outfielder Michaela  
Herbert. ``He knows what he's talking about and he explains things 
very well. I hope he's able to come back soon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Howe has been helping the team since practices began more than  
two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The Whitefish softball team is funded by the Whitefish Softball  
Association and not the school, but the school district has a say 
in employment matters. A member of the Whitefish Softball 
Association declined comment Wednesday, but said the organization 
will have a response later. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully reasonable people can come to a reasonable  
solution,'' Howe said Wednesday night. ``I'm kind of dumbfounded by 
the whole thing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a very big investment in the kids in this community and  
right now a lot of damage is being done to these kids and to the 
program 
</P>
<P>
	``And for what reason? I don't know. For the life of me, I don't  
know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to his problems with major league baseball, the  
41-year-old Howe pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of 
attempting to buy cocaine in Kalispell in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	His career in the majors ended when the New York Yankees  
released him on June 22, 1996. He was arrested two days later at 
New York's JFK International Airport when a loaded gun was found 
inside his suitcase. 
</P>
<P>
	The left-hander pleaded guilty to gun possession and was placed  
on three years' probation and given 150 hours of community service. 
</P>
<P>
	The following year, Howe attempted a comeback with the Sioux  
Falls Canaries of the independent Northern League, but quit in 
midseason after injuring his arm.

<HEADLINE> Korean Air Pilot Averts Collision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Quick action by the pilot of a Korean Air jet  
taking off with 362 people aboard averted a collision with a cargo 
plane that had taxied into its path, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	The pilot of Korean Air Flight 36, bound for Seoul, veered  
sharply on an O'Hare International Airport runway to miss the Air 
China craft by less than 100 feet, Federal Aviation Administration 
spokesman Tony Molinaro said. 
</P>
<P>
	No injuries were reported on either Boeing 747 in the incident  
at about 2:30 a.m. Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	FAA investigators were trying to find out why the cargo plane  
pilot had turned his aircraft back onto the runway moments after 
landing, Molinaro said. ``The Air China pilot didn't seem to know 
where he was going,'' the FAA spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Korean plane, with 340 passengers and a crew of 22,  
continued on to Seoul. Korean Air praised the pilot, Capt. Dong 
Lee. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is exactly what pilots are trained to do,'' spokeswoman  
Penn Pfaelzer said. ``He averted what potentially could have been a 
collision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, a Continental flight with 123 people aboard returned  
to the Baltimore airport shortly after taking off because a 
passenger yelled ``fire'' and others joined in. 
</P>
<P>
	No signs of fire were reported after Flight 1563 landed Thursday  
evening at Baltimore-Washington International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
	``Someone yelled `Fire,' and everyone started yelling `Fire,'  
and the stewardess got onto the PA system and told everyone to stay 
calm,'' passenger Matt Bickel said. 
</P>
<P>
	After an inspection, the passengers and crew reboarded the plane  
and continued to Cleveland.

<HEADLINE> NATO Ground Campaign Being Examined </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The capture of three U.S. soldiers by Serb  
forces underscores the risks U.S. troops could face in a ground 
war, even as more defense and foreign policy analysts say that may 
be the only way to defeat Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	A ground war poses a much greater likelihood of casualties than  
the current air war by bringing the battle to rough terrain known 
well by Serb fighters. Because of those dangers, it is politically 
more difficult for a U.S. president to commit ground troops. From 
the day President Clinton sold the idea of NATO action to Congress, 
he has denied any plan to use U.S. or other NATO troops. 
</P>
<P>
	In any scenario, analysts said, ground troops provide the only  
way to secure areas now occupied by Serb forces and would be needed 
to protect Kosovar civilians if they are to be returned to their 
homes. They also provide a necessary part of any post-bombing 
strategy that aims to oust Milosevic by force -- a goal proponents 
of an all-out campaign say is necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, increasing numbers of defense analysts and some members  
of Congress believe NATO cannot meet its objectives in Yugoslavia 
from the sky alone. The capture of the three American soldiers on 
the Yugoslav-Macedonian border makes that even clearer, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The idea that it could be more than these three, that you  
could have dozens captured or killed ... could increase political 
pressure for ground intervention,'' says Michael O'Hanlon, foreign 
policy scholar at the Brookings Institution. ``It raises the 
possibility that people will say this reminds us of how bad things 
could get.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Any new course by Clinton likely would be better than current  
strategy, O'Hanlon said, echoing widespread discontent among 
defense and foreign policy analysts with the president's handling 
of the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said in a CBS-TV interview Wednesday that his chief  
concern about sending in ground troops would be ``the prospect of 
never being able to get them out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But retired Gen. William E. Odom, senior fellow at the Hudson  
Institute, said Thursday that an exit strategy should never govern 
a victory plan for war. 
</P>
<P>
	``We face the imperative of a ground invasion of Serbia -- not  
just Kosovo,'' Odom said, adding that NATO troops should be 
prepared, if necessary, to stay in Yugoslavia until the current 
generation of Serb leaders and their hostilities die of old age. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress remains divided over the NATO action and for the  
advisability of a ground attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., said use of troops is not warranted  
until NATO sets clear goals for their use, the threat from Yugoslav 
armored units is ``significantly reduced,'' and there is more 
aggressive bombing of Serb infrastructure. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John Warner, R-Va., who helped push through a Senate vote  
supporting NATO, said Wednesday on the ``Newshour with Jim Lehrer'' 
that a ground assault would take several weeks to organize and that 
NATO should stick to the air campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, of course hindsight may be that you should not have  
abandoned any option in the beginning, put all options in place and 
then determine whether or not to use them,'' he said. But now, he 
said, ``Let's see it through, stick to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two New York Democrats in the House joined the call for ground  
troops Thursday. Reps. Jerrold Nadler and Eliot Engle urged 
immediate deployment of a NATO force to occupy Kosovo and protect 
ethnic Albanians, arguing ``that the use of air power alone cannot 
and will not prevent these atrocities.''

<HEADLINE> Yankees Leave Irabu Behind in Fla. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- The New York Yankees packed their bags and  
left spring training in Florida for the West Coast on Thursday, 
leaving Hideki Irabu behind after owner George Steinbrenner called 
him a ``fat ... toad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fed up by Irabu's lack of motivation and the pitcher's mental  
lapses all spring, the Yankees decided to see if some time away 
from the club might help the Japanese right-hander ``clear his 
mind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He'll be staying here until Tuesday when he'll join the team  
in Oakland,'' Steinbrenner announced after a series of lengthy 
meetings with Irabu and general manager Brian Cashman following a 
7-6 exhibition win over Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a slap on the wrist by any means, it's a decision I  
made,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But earlier, the Boss blasted Irabu, calling him ``a fat ...  
toad'' after he failed to cover first base in the ninth inning. 
Steinbrenner said Irabu weighed 252 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not covering first base, I don't know what you've got to do.  
That's not a Yankee,'' Steinbrenner said. 
</P>
<P>
	Irabu did the same thing in a start last weekend in a game  
against Philadelphia, infuriating the Yankees and leading to 
speculation that if he did something like that again, he'd start 
the year in the minor leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, he'll be Florida.  
</P>
<P>
	``The season doesn't start until Monday and he'll be here. And  
while he's here we'll be able to make a decision accordingly,'' 
said Cashman, who said optioning Irabu to the minors or trading him 
were both possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
	Irabu entered the game in the sixth and pitched two solid  
innings before things unraveled for him with two outs in the ninth. 
Cleveland's Jolbert Cabrera hit a grounder that first baseman Clay 
Bellinger fielded while going to his right. 
</P>
<P>
	Irabu broke late toward first on the play, and by the time he  
got near the bag, Cabrera had already crossed it. Enrique Wilson 
followed with a two-run double and Irabu was pulled from the game. 
</P>
<P>
	As he walked toward the dugout, Irabu looked like he knew he was  
in trouble. The fans at Legends Field, aware of Irabu's lack of 
hustle and his shaky situation with club, booed his exit. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got a late start on the play,'' Irabu said through his  
interpreter, George Rose. ``To be honest, I can't understand all 
the things being said about me these days -- `I don't have any guts, 
I don't have any fight in me.' People are judging me on one play 
not the whole performance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not long after his comments, Irabu met in the Yankees' coaches  
office with Steinbrenner and Cashman while the rest of the Yankees 
waited in the clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
	The team, which had a tumultuous training camp with the Roger  
Clemens-David Wells trade, manager Joe Torre's diagnosis with 
prostate cancer and Darryl Strawberry's comeback, was supposed to 
leave by bus for their charter flight to Los Angeles 45 minutes 
after the game. 
</P>
<P>
	But when it appeared the Irabu situation would delay their  
departure some of the players sat quietly eating pizza while others 
used the time to get in a quick workout. 
</P>
<P>
	When Steinbrenner gave the word that it was time to leave about  
one hour, 45 minutes after the game, pitcher David Cone shouted to 
his teammates, ``Let's hit the road, we're outta here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the Yankees hollered back, ``I'm not going.''  
</P>
<P>
	As it turns out, that was Irabu's fate -- one that he apparently  
asked for. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said he wanted to stay behind,'' Steinbrenner said. ``I  
just feel this is something they and he needs right now. They 
needed to get on the plane ... they don't need to sit around the 
locker room two hours while we try to work this situation out. We 
will work this situation out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steinbrenner said he thinks Irabu needs to lose weight and said  
the pitcher will spend the next five days working out at the 
Yankees' training complex under the guidance of Billy Connors, the 
team's director of player personnel. 
</P>
<P>
	Steinbrenner said he has no regrets about all the effort he and  
the Yankees have put into Irabu, signed after a drawn-out bidding 
war in 1997 to a four-year, $12 million contract. Irabu was 13-9 
with a 4.06 ERA last year, but did not pitch in the postseason. 
</P>
<P>
	``No, I really don't,'' he said. ``He was a great pitcher for us  
last year. We wouldn't have had the record we had last year without 
him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steinbrenner said there are still some things to work out in the  
next few days with Irabu before he rejoins the team Tuesday when 
the Yankees open the season against the Athletics. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to work on them,'' Steinbrenner said.  
</P>
<P>
	Irabu went 0-2 this spring with an 8.38 ERA in four starts and  
Thursday's relief outing. In 19 1-3 innings he allowed 30 hits, 18 
earned runs with nine walks and eight strikeouts.

<HEADLINE> Unions: Mine Industry in Jeopardy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CABIN CREEK, W.Va. (AP) -- United Mine Workers President Cecil  
Roberts didn't take the top job in the wellspring of organized 
labor thinking the end of the union was in sight. 
</P>
<P>
	But he can see its demise -- an end, he says, made possible  
through a mix of cheap coal, costly pollution controls and 
unrealistic demands of environmental activists. 
</P>
<P>
	``Like our brothers and sisters in the steel industry, the men  
and women who mine this nation's coal are under assault as never 
before,'' he said. ``The American coal industry might well be 
eliminated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Roberts' order, about 30,000 union miners across the country  
planned a a 24-hour, contract-sanctioned work stoppage today, 
originally meant to honor co-workers killed on the job. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, however, the day will memorialize the frail condition  
of America's most basic of smokestack industries. To Roberts, the 
future of the U.S. coal industry -- and the cheap electricity it 
provides -- hinges on several things: 
</P>
<P>
	-- Stiffer air pollution standards beginning next year under the  
federal Clean Air Act, the first stage of which cost thousands of 
jobs in the high-sulfur coal fields of northern Appalachia and the 
Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
	-- A looming international global warming treaty that would limit  
developed countries' emissions from the burning of fossil fuels, 
especially coal, while exempting big producer-consumers like China 
and Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Environmental challenges to the industry's most productive  
mining techniques, especially the mountaintop removal strip mining 
that has been the focus of protests in West Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	On these issues, the union known for its fierce opposition to  
coal operators has allied itself with the industry, including 
longtime nemesis Arch Coal Inc. of St. Louis, the nation's 
second-largest coal producer. 
</P>
<P>
	The alliance has disappointed environmentalists, who had counted  
on the union's rabble-rousing reputation to put it on their side. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't they understand that this could mean more jobs?'' asked  
Laura Forman, a spokeswoman for the Ohio Valley Environmental 
Coalition. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they can't use mountaintop removal to strip it, they'll  
mine it underground,'' a much more labor-intensive method, she 
contends. 
</P>
<P>
	Roberts called that idea ``ridiculous.''  
</P>
<P>
	``If somebody could tell me how to mine this much coal with  
picks and shovels, I'd be glad to hear it,'' he said. ``But it 
can't be done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Roberts, the union's president since 1995, said he has an  
obligation to UMW members. He accused some environmentalists of 
living in a fantasy world. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have to live in the real world,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	In the real world, coal prices have dropped steadily since the  
post-oil embargo peaks of the late 1970s. Roberts remembers coal 
selling for $100 a ton; now it goes for $20. 
</P>
<P>
	Roberts also must confront the problems of an industrial-age  
union at the end of the 20th century -- how to make his union grow 
while mine employment rapidly dwindles, and how to finance health 
care and benefits for a growing pool of retirees. 
</P>
<P>
	Between 1993 and 1998 alone, the number of U.S. coal miners fell  
from 101,322 to an estimated 80,000, according to the National 
Mining Association. 
</P>
<P>
	From a pre-World War II peak of a quarter-million, the number of  
union-represented miners sunk to 30,606 in 1997, based on data 
compiled by the U.S. Energy Information Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Roberts isn't ignoring the growing portion of nonunion mining  
jobs. He appeared in Cabin Creek recently for a rally just before 
85 workers at Day Mining Co. voted for union representation after a 
long organizing campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	The union has also been recruiting workers from other  
industries: ambulance drivers and health care workers in southern 
West Virginia, corrections officers in western Pennsylvania, city 
employees and firefighters in Gallup, N.M. 
</P>
<P>
	At age 52 and a native of Cabin Creek, Roberts' personal profile  
could be the profile of his union or any of its members. 
</P>
<P>
	He is a sixth-generation coal miner whose grandfathers died in  
mining accidents. His parents, Evelyn and Cecil Roberts Sr., are 
union pensioners who still live in Cabin Creek about 15 miles east 
of Charleston. 
</P>
<P>
	No stranger to a fight, Roberts said the job now for the union  
founded in 1890 is to assure its survival in the 21st century. He 
said he won't stand by and watch members lose their jobs: ``It's 
unfair, unwarranted and wrong.''

<HEADLINE>  Tokyo Shares Close Sharply Higher / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo stock prices got a big boost today when  
domestic and foreign investors scooped up shares on the first day 
of Japan's new fiscal year. The dollar slipped against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 490.97 points, or 3.10  
percent, to close the day's trading at 16,327.56. On Wednesday, the 
average lost 22.53 points, or 0.14 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 118.52 yen in late trading, down 1.46 yen from  
late Wednesday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level of 
118.97 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, the fiscal year began with a bang on active  
buying by both foreign and domestic players, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The swing factor is domestic investors, or institutional  
investors, coming into the market in the new fiscal year with their 
hands free,'' said Chuck Lambert, market analyst at Jardine Fleming 
Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign investors, he said, continued to buy, ``the same as  
always.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buying was encouraged by the belief that a flood of new Japanese  
pension fund money would enter the market in April and by recent 
indications that Japanese companies are serious about 
restructuring, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	In specific stocks, shares of Mitsubishi Electric rallied after  
the company announced plans Wednesday to cut 10 percent of its 
global workforce in an effort to erase growing losses. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 726 million shares changed hands on the first  
section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, sharply up from 480 million 
shares traded the previous day. Advances outnumbered declines 764 
to 441, while 110 issues were unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section finished up 33.22 points, or 2.6 percent, to 1,300.44 
points. The TOPIX had fallen 2.02 points, or 0.16 percent, the 
previous day. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average closed at 9,786.16  
points Wednesday, down 127.10. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Heat Activates Jamal Mashburn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Miami Heat forward Jamal Mashburn, out since the  
opening weekend with a bruised knee, was activated from the injured 
list before Thursday night's game against the Philadelphia 76ers. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, guard Voshon Lenard may be not be far behind in  
returning to the Miami lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	Mashburn had missed 26 games since suffering a severely bruised  
left knee during a Feb. 7 win at New York, the Heat's second game 
of the season. He was Miami's leading scorer in both games before 
the injury, scoring 19 points in the opener against Detroit and 21 
against the Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
	The fifth-year forward did not accompany the Heat on its  
four-game road trip last week, but was a full participant as coach 
Pat Riley put the team through three tough days of practice since a 
94-87 loss at Orlando on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems like his condition is right where it was before,''  
Riley said. ``But running off screens, fighting through screens, 
that might take a little time. Sometimes you think you're ready, 
ready, ready -- then you realize you need to get on the court for a 
few more games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forward Terry Mills was returned to the injured list with a  
strength deficit in his left leg, the lingering effect from knee 
surgery during the offseason. He had been active for just four 
games and did not see game action. 
</P>
<P>
	Lenard, meanwhile, appears close to returning to the lineup  
after undergoing surgery for a stress fracture in his left leg. He 
returned to practice Monday and said he thought he could return in 
a couple of weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``It feels good. The X-rays looked good,'' Lenard said following  
the Heat's pregame shootaround. ``It's just a matter of time now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lenard suffered the stress fracture sometime last season, but it  
was not discovered until a physical exam after the NBA lockout was 
lifted. He began the season on the injured list and underwent 
surgery Feb. 12.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Shares Close Sharply Higher / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo stock prices got a big boost today when  
domestic and foreign investors scooped up shares on the first day 
of Japan's new fiscal year. The dollar slipped against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 490.97 points, or 3.10  
percent, to close the day's trading at 16,327.56. On Wednesday, the 
average lost 22.53 points, or 0.14 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 118.52 yen in late trading, down 1.46 yen from  
late Wednesday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level of 
118.97 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, the fiscal year began with a bang on active  
buying by both foreign and domestic players, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The swing factor is domestic investors, or institutional  
investors, coming into the market in the new fiscal year with their 
hands free,'' said Chuck Lambert, market analyst at Jardine Fleming 
Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign investors, he said, continued to buy, ``the same as  
always.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buying was encouraged by the belief that a flood of new Japanese  
pension fund money would enter the market in April and by recent 
indications that Japanese companies are serious about 
restructuring, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	In specific stocks, shares of Mitsubishi Electric rallied after  
the company announced plans Wednesday to cut 10 percent of its 
global workforce in an effort to erase growing losses. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 726 million shares changed hands on the first  
section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, sharply up from 480 million 
shares traded the previous day. Advances outnumbered declines 764 
to 441, while 110 issues were unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section finished up 33.22 points, or 2.6 percent, to 1,300.44 
points. The TOPIX had fallen 2.02 points, or 0.16 percent, the 
previous day. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average closed at 9,786.16  
points Wednesday, down 127.10. 
</P>
<P>
	On the foreign exchange market, the dollar moved lower against  
the yen on selling by overseas funds amid growing bearish sentiment

<HEADLINE> Judge Reduces Rebuffed Ref's Award </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A federal judge on Thursday blew the whistle on  
an $8 million jury award, reducing it to $350,000 for a woman who 
was passed over as an NBA referee. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Sidney H. Stein said Sandra Ortiz-Del Valle was entitled  
to damages because a jury fairly found that the league was liable 
because it had discriminated against her. 
</P>
<P>
	A jury last spring awarded Ortiz-Del Valle $7.85 million,  
including $7 million in punitive damages, after she rose to No. 2 
on the list of those in line to officiate in the NBA, only to be 
passed over repeatedly. 
</P>
<P>
	Stein said it was necessary to reduce the $7 million because it  
was 58.3 times the amount of compensatory damages, a ratio that 
differed greatly from awards in similar cases. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said it was fair to levy punitive damages because  
evidence supported the jury's finding that the NBA's conduct was 
wanton and reckless. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge reset the punitive damages at $250,000, lost wages at  
$76,926 and an award for emotional distress at $20,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeffrey A. Mishkin, a lawyer for the NBA, said the league will  
appeal the reduced award to the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. 
</P>
<P>
	``The jury's award was grossly excessive and the district court  
has now corrected many of the errors the jury made. In our view, 
there was no gender discrimination here and three should have been 
no award at all,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Patricia M. Flannery, a lawyer for Ortiz-Del Valle, said in a  
telephone interview from her Boston office that her client was out 
of the country on family matters. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge offered the option of accepting his reduced award or  
having another trial just to focus on damages. Flannery said no 
decision had been made. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're pleased that the decision finds that the NBA violated  
her civil rights by failing to hire her as an NBA referee because 
of her sex,'' she added. 
</P>
<P>
	Ortiz-Del Valle, 47, of Hillside, N.J., grew up in the Grant  
House projects on 125th Street in Harlem. She was a center and 
forward on City College's basketball team before beginning to 
officiate in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	Soon, she was refereeing in the Pro Am League, a league of 22  
teams throughout the nation. By 1991, she was officiating in the 
U.S. Basketball League, which features teams from Maine to Florida 
on the East Coast. From 1992 through 1994, she officiated preseason 
scrimmages for the New Jersey Nets. 
</P>
<P>
	Violet Palmer became the first woman to referee an NBA game in  
October 1997. Less than a week later, the second woman, Dee 
Kantner, worked her first game. The league said it had approached 
both women about four years earlier because it believed they had 
the makings of NBA officials.

	NATO Attacks Close In on Serb Forces  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO used its air assaults today to  
tighten a ring around Yugoslav forces in Kosovo, where Serbs were 
packing masses of ethnic Albanians into refugee trains so tightly 
that at least two people died. Allied attacks destroyed a bridge 
over the Danube River and struck at Yugoslav military units in 
Kosovo as the NATO campaign to halt the Serb eradication of ethnic 
Albanians reached its ninth day. A Vatican envoy traveled to 
Belgrade to urge an end to the airstrikes, but the Western alliance 
said the bombardment would proceed as long as necessary. NATO 
officials contend the Serbs are trying to forever alter the ethnic 
makeup of Kosovo.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton pledged today that the  
United States will do everything in its power to gain the return of 
three Army soldiers captured near the Yugoslav-Macedonia border. He 
warned Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic that ``the United 
States takes care of its own.'' ``President Milosevic should make 
no mistake: We will hold him and his government responsible for 
their safety and their well-being,'' Clinton told service members 
at Norfolk Naval Base in Virginia. Shortly before Clinton spoke, 
Yugoslav television announced that the three soldiers would face 
criminal proceedings before a military court tomorrow.

	Scrutiny of Bush's Past Growing  
</P>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush's creation of a  
presidential exploratory committee is setting off an exploration of 
his past behavior as well as his political prospects. Combined with 
the attention being paid to his tendency to duck hot issues, the 
focus on Bush's boisterous youth shows he's considered fair game, 
analysts say. But so far, not much more has emerged from the media 
scrutiny than a breakup with a fiancee 30 years ago. Bush has 
acknowledged doing ``some irresponsible things when I was young and 
irresponsible,'' but has not been more specific, except to say he 
used to drink too much.

	ATLANTA (AP) -- Smoking among middle-school students in Florida  
dropped 19 percent since the state launched an aggressive 
anti-tobacco campaign aimed at children, the federal government 
reported today. The decline, which is larger than any nationally 
among youth since 1980, could indicate that the prevalence of teen 
smoking has peaked, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
said. The number of Florida middle-school students who reported 
having smoked cigarettes declined from 18.5 percent in February 
1998 to 15 percent in February 1999.

percent, according to a new survey. The U.S. Public Interest 
Research Group survey charts a dramatic rise in the frequency of 
ATM surcharges. It found that 93 percent of banks charged consumers 
for using another bank's machine in March, up from 71 percent a 
year ago and 45 percent in March 1997.

</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Three U.S. soldiers who were  
captured by Serb forces while patrolling the border between 
Macedonia and Yugoslavia could face a military court as early as 
tomorrow. Deputy Prime Minister Vuk Draskovic said the soldiers who 
were caught yesterday would be treated ``with the full respect of 
all international conventions concerning prisoners of war.'' The 
Tanjug state news agency quoted a judicial officer as saying a 
military court would ``institute criminal proceedings'' against the 
three. Any trial ``would be in violation of international law,''

military personnel and their families at Norfolk Naval Base. ``The 
United States takes care of its own.'' Clinton came to Norfolk to 
rally the troops and express his appreciation for the sacrifices

districts competing for the money could use it to hire police, 
provide mental health services to at-risk youth, or for programs

<HEADLINE> Mammoth Bones, Other Fossils Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HEMET, Calif. (AP) -- Digging for a new reservoir in Southern  
California has uncovered a huge array of ice age fossils, including 
a mammoth that may be the best-preserved bones of the elephant 
ancestor found in the region, experts said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's huge,'' Eric Scott, a paleontology supervisor for the San  
Bernardino County Museum, said Wednesday of the fossils. ``It's 
going to rewrite North American paleontology.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The mammoth's yellow curving tusks, teeth, lower jaw and other  
bones were found Monday at the site of the Eastside Reservoir, a 
4.5-mile-by-2-mile expanse of raw, scraped earth in Riverside 
County, 75 miles east of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's certainly the best-preserved we've found,'' Scott said.  
``There could be a lot more of this critter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The museum is overseeing state-required fossil research at the  
reservoir, a $2.2 billion project scheduled for completion by the 
end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of bones have been dug up since construction began in  
1993. While the area today is a mix of dry desert and farmlands 
surrounded by hills, it was cooler and greener during the ice age 
50,000 to 11,000 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Mammoth, mastodon, sabertooth cats, horses, camels and many now  
extinct species wandered the site in Domenigoni Valley, which was 
lush with ponderosa pine and manzanita, Scott said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's not an assemblage of animals like this anywhere for  
this time period, not just in the inland valleys, but in California 
and even perhaps the western United States,'' said Kathleen 
Springer, senior curator of paleontology for the museum. 
</P>
<P>
	Paleontologists have also found bison, sloth, North American  
lion, dire wolves, bears, badgers, weasels, peccaries and deer. 
</P>
<P>
	The mammoth bones appear to be from a female in her mid-20s, a  
``sub-adult'' to very young adult who died 15,000 to 20,000 years 
ago, Scott said. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists will take the bones to a laboratory to try to  
determine whether the mammoth had a disease or injury, and will 
look for tooth marks that might indicate she was killed by a 
predator. 
</P>
<P>
	The find was the latest in an area that is surprisingly rich in  
fossils, especially those of mastodons, a smaller, more primitive 
elephant ancestor that lived at the same time as mammoths. However, 
most of the finds have been individual bones or fragments because 
an ancient stream scattered and dismembered the bodies. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott said bones from about 10 mammoths and 30 mastodons have  
been found, prompting researchers to nickname the area ``The Valley 
of the Mastodons.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mastodons have been found in the better-known La Brea Tar Pits  
in Los Angeles, but nobody suspected they would be found so far 
inland.

<HEADLINE> Brett Favre To Stop Drinking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- Brett Favre, who once protested when the  
NFL made him refrain from drinking, now is making a conscious 
effort to abstain from alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-time NFL MVP said in an interview with the Green Bay  
Press-Gazette published today that the decision was based on 
reasons that were both personal and professional. 
</P>
<P>
	The Packers' quarterback underwent rehabilitation for an  
addiction to painkillers three years ago. Afterwards, he complained 
that it was unfair that the NFL had banned him from drinking as 
part of its rehabilitation program. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said his decision to quit drinking isn't related to that,  
but to a desire to have a long and productive career and to be a 
good family man.

<P>
	``I don't want 15 years to go by and be looked at as a goofball  
bum who could still throw touchdown passes and defy the odds,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``And I don't want to be remembered as just being a good  
football player. I want to be remembered as a good family man, too. 
At times I haven't been that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Favre's wife, Deanna, is due to give birth to their second child  
in August. 
</P>
<P>
	``Deanna told me, `This baby is an act of God.' I said, `You may  
be right,''' Favre said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a time when all I cared about was the next game, the  
next party, the next tee time. I've come to a crossroads. ``I can't 
think of one thing that drinking has done that's been good for me 
or my family. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not saying everyone in the world should quit drinking, but  
I wasn't the best drinker in the world, so I'm quitting it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Favre said the pregnancy has changed his priorities.  
</P>
<P>
	``Being out drinking and doing other things isn't the best  
example of being a family man,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Favre said part of his move stems from a renewed interest in  
religion. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not calling myself Reggie White yet, but I've tried to  
become a better Christian, to show up at church and pay attention 
for a change,'' he said. ``I'm trying to make the right decisions. 
It's not easy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Favre said he has reassured teammates he is still going to be  
fun. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's not going to change,'' he said. ``I've had some guys  
asking me if something was wrong. They said I haven't been as 
talkative as in the past. Hey, I'm going to be the same ol' Brett 
but with a little more serious attitude.''

<HEADLINE> Yahoo! Is Buying Broadcast.com </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Yahoo! Inc. is buying Broadcast.com Inc. for  
$5.7 billion in stock, adding the Internet's leading supplier of 
radio and video programs to Yahoo!'s growing array of services. 
</P>
<P>
	The transaction announced today puts Yahoo! in a solid position  
to take advantage of the high-speed future of the Internet. Yahoo! 
currently offers a directory service and search engine for the 
World Wide Web, providing easy links to millions of sites. 
</P>
<P>
	Broadcast.com is perhaps best known for its Web broadcasts of  
John Glenn's second launch into space and the Victoria's Secret 
fashion show. But the company's services are expected to grow in 
popularity as connections to cyberspace get faster and easier. 
</P>
<P>
	The acquisition ``really positions Yahoo! to play a defining  
role as we see the rise of audio and video content on the Web,'' 
said Paul Noglows, a San Francisco-based analyst with Hambrecht &AMP; 
Quist. 
</P>
<P>
	``From Broadcast.com's perspective, it will make their services  
available to a much broader range of users, considering Yahoo! 
attracts 50 million unique users to its site a month.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yahoo! agreed to pay $130 a share for Broadcast.com's stock.  
Broadcast.com investors will receive .77 of a Yahoo share for each 
Broadcast.com share. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors were quick to bet on the success of the combination.  
</P>
<P>
	In trading Thursday, Broadcast.com's shares rose $4.87 1/2 to  
$123.06 1/4 on the Nasdaq Stock Market, while Yahoo!'s stock rose 
$1.87 1/4 to $170.25. 
</P>
<P>
	Founded in 1994 by Stanford University doctoral candidates David  
Filo and Jerry Yang, Yahoo! is one of the premier destinations on 
the Internet. The company's turbocharged stock, which has risen 264 
percent in the past 12 months, has turned into a currency to snap 
up rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	But Broadcast.com wasn't cheap. The Dallas-based firm, which  
went public in July, has seen its shares rise 1,213 percent in just 
eight months. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, however, isn't making any money yet. Broadcast.com  
lost $16.4 million last year on revenue of $22.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Yahoo!'s premium for a company in the red didn't seem to bother  
Yahoo! shareholder Charles Lax, a general partner with SoftBank 
Venture Capital. 
</P>
<P>
	``What else is new?,'' he asked. ``High-speed access (to the  
Internet) is very important, and this is just an anchor acquisition 
for that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This is Yahoo!'s second major deal this year. The Santa Clara,  
Calif.-based company announced the $4.58 billion acquisition of 
GeoCities Inc. in January. 
</P>
<P>
	GeoCities, based in Los Angeles, is the No. 5 Web destination  
and has been used by more than 3 million people to set up home 
pages where they can publish their writings, post their family 
photos or try to sell things. 
</P>
<P>
	The Internet industry is both expanding and consolidating at a  
rapid pace. New companies go public almost daily and quickly become 
targets or suitors in corporate takeovers. 
</P>
<P>
	Companies like Yahoo!, America Online Inc. and Lycos Inc. are  
just a few of the firms looking for strategic acquisitions that 
reflect the integration of computer, television and telephone 
services with information and media. 
</P>
<P>
	And Yahoo! may be back on the hunt soon.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's clear that the Web has been in a race for market share  
since the beginning,'' said Steve O'Leary, a managing director at 
Broadview International, a merger advisory firm. ``I wouldn't be 
surprised to see Yahoo! announce more bold strokes in the future.''

<HEADLINE> Belle's Reputation Precedes Him </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- The numbers Albert Belle has  
compiled over a very successful baseball career can be summed up 
precisely and accurately on page 53 of the Baltimore Orioles 1999 
media guide. 
</P>
<P>
	When it comes to assessing his personality and reputation,  
however, there are no shortcuts. Plenty of tall tales, though. 
</P>
<P>
	Belle's six suspensions, his disdain for reporters and his  
unyielding desire to win have made him somewhat notorious among his 
peers. Although a few of the anecdotes become embellished with 
time, that doesn't make them any less believable. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a time when he was hit square in the nose by a pitch  
and refused to go to first base. Instead, he pounded his bat on the 
plate, called the pitcher a name and demanded that he throw a 
strike,'' Baltimore's Brady Anderson said earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``Apparently, when Albert Belle doesn't want to go to first, he  
doesn't have to. (Umpire) Ted Hendry wasn't going to make him, 
either,'' Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Great story. Not true.  
</P>
<P>
	Actually, Hendry ruled that the pitch never hit Belle, who was  
batting for the Chicago White Sox in the sixth inning of a game in 
Cleveland last season. Belle glared and screamed at pitcher Dave 
Burba before finally lining out to the left fielder. 
</P>
<P>
	Once there was the time when Belle took a bat and smashed the  
thermostat in the Cleveland clubhouse because he was tired of the 
players turning it up a notch to keep the place from becoming a 
refrigerator. That incident earned him the nickname ``Mr. Freeze.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Great story. Absolutely true.  
</P>
<P>
	Belle just might add another tale or two to his continuing saga  
this season as he begins a $65 million, five-year contract with the 
Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
	Few players in baseball are as durable or as consistent at the  
plate as Belle, who hasn't missed a game in years and had at least 
30 homers and 100 RBIs in each of the past seven seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	That, of course, is only part of the package. The Orioles can  
only hope that all the headlines Belle produces this season come by 
virtue of his actions on the field. 
</P>
<P>
	When he arrived in Baltimore, Belle spoke excitedly about  
playing with a contender, giving more of himself to the fans and 
making an effort to be more accessible to reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	``I make a promise today that I am going to improve my  
relationship with the media,'' he said in December. 
</P>
<P>
	The new era lasted about three weeks into spring training. After  
he smashed a bat and threw a spiked shoe while sitting at his 
locker during an exhibition game, the tirade was reported the next 
day and Belle promptly announced that he was done talking with 
members of the Baltimore media. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, there's a very good chance that the surly slugger will  
give reporters plenty to write about this season. Playing 81 games 
in cozy Camden Yards, Belle just might make a run at the Triple 
Crown or even at Mark McGwire's record of 70 home runs. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he gets off to a good start, he'll have an unbelievable  
year,'' Orioles manager Ray Miller said. ``If he gets off to a slow 
start, he'll have a great year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson, a fierce competitor in his own right, has already  
taken a liking to Belle, as evidenced by a picture taped above 
Anderson's locker throughout spring training. The photo shows 
Anderson and Belle standing shoulder to shoulder, both smiling, 
near the batting cage. 
</P>
<P>
	``I find him to be a likable guy. Professionally, I've always  
appreciated the way he approached each at-bat. He doesn't give 
anything away,'' Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
	There are few players in the game who work harder to excel and  
who take more pride in their work. Belle has played in 334 
consecutive games, the longest current streak in the majors, and he 
hasn't slacked off after signing the most lucrative contract in 
franchise history. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's out here every morning early on the back fields. Then he  
does all the hitting we do,'' Miller said. ``He loves the game, 
loves to work and doesn't like to lose. What more can I ask?''

<HEADLINE> Derby Hopeful Not in `Prime' Post </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HIALEAH, Fla. (AP) -- Prime Directive, the only Flamingo Stakes  
entry with a shot at the Kentucky Derby, found his path even 
tougher when he drew the outside post in the eight-horse field for 
Saturday's race at Hialeah. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with the poor draw, Prime Directive was made the 2-1  
favorite in the 1 1/8-mile, $250,000 race for 3-year-olds. First 
American was next at 5-2, followed by Cryptodiplomacy at 4-1. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Prime Directive, making his debut under trainer Pat  
Byrne, nor his seven challengers are among the Daily Racing Form's 
list of the top 25 Derby contenders. 
</P>
<P>
	Byrne, who took over Prime Directive's training after the colt  
won the Count Fleet Stakes at Aqueduct in January, thinks the son 
of Tactical Advantage has a chance to move onto that list with a 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``The way he's trained, I'll be extremely disappointed if he  
doesn't win Saturday,'' said Byrne, who trained Horse of the Year 
Favorite Trick in 1997. ``If he can't beat this field or at least 
run a very big race, there wouldn't be much point in going to the 
Derby.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prime Directive, with Pat Day riding him for the first time, is  
usually close to the pace. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the Count Fleet, Prime Directive won the Grade 2  
Saratoga Special last August. He is the only horse in the Flamingo 
field to have won a Grade 2 stakes. 
</P>
<P>
	First American has run in three stakes and was out of the money  
each time. He finished fifth, at 119-1 odds, to Vicar and 
Wondertross in the Florida Derby at Gulfstream, beaten by 2 1/2 
lengths. 
</P>
<P>
	With Jose Velez Jr. aboard, First American has shown speed in  
some starts and closed ground in others. 
</P>
<P>
	Cryptodiplomacy, ridden by Oliver Castillo, likes to runs on the  
pace. He has made one stakes appearance, finishing next to last in 
the Iroquois last fall at Churchill Downs. 
</P>
<P>
	The only other winner of a graded stakes is Valid Reprized, who  
won the Grade 3 Tropical Park Derby at Calder in January. Valid 
Reprized was listed at 10-1. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest of the field is Forty One Carats (8-1), Vision And  
Verse (8-1), Silver Season (12-1) and Shut Out Time (15-1). 
</P>
<P>
	Silver Season broke his maiden in his most recent start. Vision  
And Verse and Forty One Carats never have run in a stakes. Shut Out 
Time won two minor stakes in a row at Aqueduct late last year. 
</P>
<P>
	All except Forty One Carats were early nominees to the Triple  
Crown and that colt was supplemented last week.

<HEADLINE> Pa. Student Standing Trial As Adult </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- A 15-year-old accused of killing a science  
teacher at a middle-school dance last April will be tried as an 
adult, a judge ruled today. 
</P>
<P>
	The pain that the shooting caused the victim's family and the  
community outweighed Andrew Wurst's immaturity and claims of mental 
illness, wrote Erie County Judge Michael Palmisano. 
</P>
<P>
	Conflicting testimony from psychiatric experts also made it  
impossible to determine whether Wurst was truly mentally ill, or if 
he could be treated adequately at a juvenile correctional facility, 
Palmisano said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The evidence suggests the defendant made a conscious decision  
to arm himself with a deadly weapon and ammunition, after which he 
selected his victims and executed his plan,'' the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wurst is charged with killing teacher John Gillette at a Parker  
Middle School graduation dance in Edinboro, near Erie. Wurst was 14 
and in eighth grade at the time. He also faces two attempted murder 
counts for wounding two students, among other charges. 
</P>
<P>
	State law mandates Wurst be tried as an adult because  
authorities charged him with homicide. The teen's attorney had 
asked Palmisano to try Wurst in juvenile court, arguing he was more 
likely to get treatment for mental disorders in a youth facility.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Cardinals Condemn Balkans War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Cardinal Bernard Law and other Roman Catholic  
cardinals on Thursday urged President Clinton and Yugoslav 
President Slobodan Milosevic to end the fighting in the Balkans and 
return to the negotiating table. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope somehow we might inject into the discussion the  
rhetoric of peace,'' said Law, who released letters signed by all 
eight U.S. cardinals. ``It's a lone voice for the moment but it's a 
very important voice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The letter to Milosevic urged ``an immediate cessation of  
Serbian military and police operations against the population of 
Kosovo,'' as well as Yugoslav cooperation with international aid 
agencies attempting relief efforts in the region. 
</P>
<P>
	In the letter to Clinton, the American cardinals called for an  
end to the NATO bombing campaign, which began March 24 and 
continued Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The letters were signed by Law, John O'Connor of New York, Roger  
Mahony of Los Angeles, William Keeler of Baltimore, James Hickey of 
Washington, Anthony Bevilacqua Bevilaqua of Philadelphia, Adam 
Maida of Detroit and Francis George of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Their letters noted that the Catholic Church is in the midst of  
Holy Week, which culminates Sunday with Easter. 
</P>
<P>
	``May this most holy of times in the Christian world be filled  
with thoughts and deeds of peace, not war,'' the cardinals wrote to 
both leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO leaders have opposed the idea of calling off military  
operations in observance of Easter, saying it would provide 
Milosevic too great an opportunity to commit unchecked violence. 
</P>
<P>
	A representative of Pope John Paul II traveled to Yugoslavia on  
Thursday to personally deliver a papal plea for peace to Milosevic. 
Law said the Vatican has also presented its position to 
representatives of the NATO powers and United Nations Security 
Council members. 
</P>
<P>
	Also on Thursday, the Serbian Orthodox Church filed suit in  
federal court in Chicago seeking an injunction barring Clinton from 
bombing Serbia and Kosovo. The lawsuit alleges the bombing violates 
various international treaties.

<HEADLINE> Purchasing Managers' Index Rises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The nation's manufacturing sector extended its  
growth spurt for a second month in March, as production and new 
orders gained momentum, corporate purchasing executives said in a 
survey released today. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Association of Purchasing Management reported its  
monthly index of business activity rose to 54.3 percent last month, 
an increase of 1.9 percentage points from its February level. 
</P>
<P>
	In February, the manufacturing sector reversed an eight-month  
slide that had been one of the few blights in the robust U.S. 
economy. The continued growth in March heartened economists. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks like a good, gradual recovery from a very weak fourth  
quarter,'' said Dan Seto, an economist with Nikko Securities 
International Co. 
</P>
<P>
	The NAPM voiced cautious optimism, noting that the report showed  
some signs of lingering weakness. 
</P>
<P>
	``It appears that the manufacturing sector is on a path of  
recovery, but the commodities sectors are lagging in their 
recovery,'' said Norbert J. Ore, chairman of the NAPM's 
Manufacturing Business Survey Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The NAPM assesses the health of the nation's factories, and in  
turn the overall economy, through a monthly survey of purchasing 
executives at manufacturing firms. The trade group's findings are 
widely followed by economists because they usually provide the 
first indication of how the economy performed in the just-ended 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	The strongest growth in today's report came from the NAPM's  
production index, which rose 2.7 percentage points to 59.6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Orders for new business rose 1 percentage point to 58.2.  
Electronic components and equipment makers experienced the sharpest 
rise in orders, the NAPM said. 
</P>
<P>
	Export orders were strong for a second consecutive month after  
14 months of decline. The slump was due to the Asian economic 
crisis that sapped demand for U.S. products. 
</P>
<P>
	Manufacturing employment declined for a 10th straight month,  
although the NAPM said the rate of decline had slowed. Several 
sectors said they were adding workers, with apparel and tobacco 
companies hiring the most. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are beginning to stop the job hemorrhaging in this  
sector,'' Seto said. 
</P>
<P>
	Separate reports from Washington today further illustrated the  
strength of the economy. Personal income increased a seasonally 
adjusted 0.5 percent in February, while consumer spending jumped 
0.7 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The NAPM considers any reading above 50 percent as a sign of  
growth in the industrial sector. Ore said the March report provided 
several indications of continued strength in the coming months. 
</P>
<P>
	``NAPM's Backlog of Orders index has strengthened significantly  
in the last two months and should help drive production in the 
second quarter,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The backlog index rose 3.5 percentage points to 52.0 percent in  
March.

<HEADLINE>  Soldiers Described as Bright, Brave </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	While Serb television showed images of three U.S. servicemen  
captured in Yugoslavia, their relatives and friends back home 
Thursday prayed for the soldiers' safe return and described them as 
brave young men who were proud to serve their country. 
</P>
<P>
	The three soldiers, part of a NATO peacekeeping force, were  
captured Wednesday near the Yugoslav-Macedonian border. 
Yugoslavia's state news agency reported the three will go on 
military trial Friday, a move President Clinton condemned as a 
violation of international treaties. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon identified the soldiers as Staff Sgt. Andrew A.  
Ramirez, 24, of Los Angeles; Staff Sgt. Christopher J. Stone, 25, 
of Smiths Creek, Mich.; and Spc. Steven M. Gonzales, 21, of 
Huntsville, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Gonzales appeared battered and bruised, his family  
expressed relief he didn't look worse. 
</P>
<P>
	His parents, Gilbert and Rosie Gonzales, are both employees of  
the Texas corrections system, and prisons statewide were asked to 
tie yellow ribbons to their entrances until the soldiers are 
released. 
</P>
<P>
	Yellow ribbons also were tied around trees in downtown Capac,  
Mich., where Stone went to high school. Small American flags were 
tied with yellow ribbon on the fence outside the home of Ramirez's 
father in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	``Steven and those other two soldiers don't deserve this,'' Mrs.  
Gonzales said at a news conference Thursday. ``They're young men 
with their whole lives ahead of them who were put in a bad 
situation. We're hopeful for the safe return of all three of 
them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Friends and former teachers said Gonzales was a likable, bright  
athlete during his high school days in Palestine, 90 miles north of 
Huntsville in east Texas. He graduated in 1995 and won a 
scholarship to Texas A&AMP;M, but left after a year to pursue a dream 
of joining an elite Army corps. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was the type of student you'd love to have: hard-working,  
always happy, funny,'' said teacher Kay Stroud, who had Gonzales in 
her advanced placement biology class his senior year. 
</P>
<P>
	A friend, Kelly Williams, recognized her former classmate as  
soon as she saw the Serbian TV pictures. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately, he's got rather big ears. He used to wiggle his  
ears for us and make us laugh,'' she said. ``That's how I knew it 
was him. I was like, you could not mistake those ears.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stone, whose wife and 5-year-old son live in San Antonio, was  
described by former teachers and classmates as a talented athlete 
also blessed with the ``gift of gab.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm surprised he couldn't talk his way out of this,'' said Ken  
Marzka, Stone's cross-country coach at Capac Community 
Junior-Senior High School, about 50 miles northeast of Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	``Chris is a tough kid ... he never quit,'' Marzka said. ``He  
never was great (as a runner),'' Marzka said. ``But when push came 
to shove, he got tougher and tougher. Chris is going to be just 
fine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	School counselor Kathy Kish said Stone was well-liked by  
students and teachers. His membership in Students Against Drunk 
Driving showed his concern for his fellow students, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't surprise us a bit that he's serving our country on  
a peace mission,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Los Angeles, outside the modest home of Ramirez's divorced  
father, Andy Ramirez, neighbors prayed for the captured staff 
sergeant and reminisced about the ``all-American kid'' they watched 
grow up. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramirez, a wrestler in high school, joined the Army after  
graduation in 1992. He wanted to follow the path of his hero, older 
brother Steven Ramirez, an Army veteran who is now a Los Angeles 
police detective. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those two brothers are very close. It hit home because we're a  
very united family,'' said Frank Jasso, Ramirez's great-uncle. 
</P>
<P>
	Some neighbors wept as they talked outside the home five miles  
east of downtown. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know he will come back and we will all greet him with open  
arms,'' said neighbor and longtime friend Johnny Rios. ``He's a 
hero now because he did his duty as a military personnel. We just 
thank God for putting him in our lives to serve the country.''

<HEADLINE> Retooled BP Amoco To Take on Arco </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- In 1992, BP Amoco was facing financial disaster.  
</P>
<P>
	Seven years later, it is the world's second largest oil company  
after announcing a $25.6 billion acquisition of Atlantic Richfield 
Co. 
</P>
<P>
	The key to the rise? Most industry observers would point to BP  
Amoco's single-minded chief executive, Sir John Browne. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday, as Browne detailed plans for the combined company, he  
reveled in its producing power. The company is expected to produce 
2.7 million barrels of oil a day, more than any other corporation. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said the deal was not motivated by the desire to be the  
biggest. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course scale is not everything,'' he said at a news  
conference Thursday. ``We're very conscious that we have to work to 
... counter the negative elements which size can bring.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Browne, who became chief executive in 1995, was speaking from  
bitter experience. He helped manage the company seven years ago, 
when -- as British Petroleum Co. -- it was struggling to pay its 
bills after making several costly acquisitions and betting that oil 
prices were heading to $25 a barrel. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, crude prices nose-dived to less than $15 a barrel, and  
BP found itself bloated with dangerously underperforming assets. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the key defining moments was in mid-1992 when they  
nearly went bust,'' said Alan Sinclair, an analyst with 
Charterhouse Securities in London. ``They set about selling assets 
they didn't want and streamlining the business by applying an 
extremely focused approach on returns.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That involved wrenching job cuts at the acquired businesses as  
Browne funneled his quest for efficiency into a near-obsession, 
analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
	By 1995, the company was leaner and back on track. Today, its  
return on average capital employed -- a measure of how efficiently a 
company uses its assets -- is one of the highest in the business, at 
9.1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	As BP's competitors began consolidating, Browne took his time  
before merging with Amoco Corp. That merger, completed in December, 
created the world's third-largest oil company and fueled Browne's 
cost-cutting reputation as he slashed 10,000 jobs to date. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger also gave the company's reputation a welcome  
makeover, analysts say. BP shed for good what Peter Hitchens, an 
analyst with Williams De Broe, called ``a pretty dull and boring 
image'' as it diversified beyond just oil exploration and 
production. 
</P>
<P>
	The Arco acquisition carries this evolution a big step further.  
The combined company now has 70 percent of its capital invested in 
upstream activities, 20 percent in downstream retail and marketing 
and 10 percent in petrochemicals. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is an ideal mix for an integrated oil company,'' Sinclair  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	It will also broaden BP Amoco's vast holdings, giving it  
operations ranging from natural gas fields in Indonesia to the 
biggest network of filling stations in California. 
</P>
<P>
	The BP Amoco-Arco combination still awaits approval by  
shareholders and regulators. If given the green light, it would 
become the second-biggest producer of oil and natural gas behind 
the still-to-be-approved Exxon-Mobil union. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts give much of the credit for this turnaround to Browne,  
an opera-loving workaholic who was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``John Browne is a visionary. The guy sets the pace,'' Sinclair  
said. ``I have not met a single individual that has such a good 
grasp of the industry they're involved in.''

<HEADLINE> Income and Spending Growth Strong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans continue to spend freely,  
manufacturing is reviving, construction is booming and unemployment 
benefit applications hover at a 25-year low -- all signs of the 
economy's continued brisk advance. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got strength pretty much across the board,'' said  
economist Sung Won Sohn of Wells Fargo &AMP; Co. in Minneapolis. 
``People who've been anticipating an economic slowdown will have to 
wait a while longer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reports on a wide range of sectors Thursday all pointed to an  
economy that, in the first quarter at least, showed little sign of 
suffering from overseas economic turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the Asian shock hit U.S. manufacturing, we asked, 'Is  
manufacturing going to drag down the economy or is economy going to 
pull up manufacturing?','' said Robert Dederick of Northern Trust 
Co. in Chicago. ``Well, it looks as if the economy is going to pull 
up manufacturing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In March, manufacturing grew for the second consecutive month,  
with both new orders and production gaining momentum, corporate 
purchasing executives told the National Association of Purchasing 
Management in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. factories' recovery has been spurred by strong demand at  
home, offsetting an anemic appetite for U.S. goods abroad. Consumer 
spending in February jumped a seasonally adjusted 0.7 percent, 
pushed higher by heavy auto sales, the Commerce Department said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, personal income increased a healthy 0.6 percent. But,  
because spending growth slightly outpaced income growth, the 
nation's savings rate again lapsed into negative territory. 
</P>
<P>
	It was minus 0.2 percent in February, marking the fifth month in  
six of a rate at or under zero. Consumers are fueling their 
purchases not just with wages, which grew 0.7 percent, but by 
cashing in some of their stock market gains and tapping their home 
equity in refinancings. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, the Dow Jones industrial average, after suffering  
two post-10,000 setbacks on Tuesday and Wednesday, rose 46.35 
points to 9,832.51. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts are expect a slowdown in stock gains will be among the  
factors cooling consumers' spending fever as the year progresses. 
</P>
<P>
	Demand for labor remains strong. First-time claims for  
unemployment benefits held under 300,000 last week for the ninth 
consecutive week, a stretch unprecedented since 1973. They fell by 
6,000 to 289,000, the Labor Department said. 
</P>
<P>
	But long-term interest rates have crept a bit higher.  
Thirty-year, fixed-rate mortgages averaged 6.98 percent this week 
for the second week in a row, up from 6.74 percent in late January, 
Freddie Mac said. 
</P>
<P>
	That could rein in the flourishing construction industry, where,  
the Commerce Department said, spending surged 2.2 percent in 
February, the largest increase in eight months and the fourth in a 
row. 
</P>
<P>
	However, a benchmark short-term interest rate targeted by the  
Federal Reserve probably will hold steady for now. Just-released 
minutes of a Feb. 3 meeting revealed that policy-makers believed 
economic risks were balanced between the potential for an upturn in 
inflation and a softening in economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
	They agreed they ``should be prepared to respond promptly in  
either direction'' by lowering or raising interest rates. At a 
subsequent meeting Tuesday, the panel decided again to hold the 
benchmark rate on overnight loans between banks unchanged at 4.75 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In details from Thursday's reports, the Commerce Department  
said: 
</P>
<P>
	--Business owners' income, transfer payments such as Social  
Security, interest and dividends and rental income all rose but 
farmers' income fell. 
</P>
<P>
	--Consumer spending was led by a 2.9 percent jump in purchases of  
durable goods, big-ticket items expected to last three or more 
years. It rose 0.6 percent for nondurable goods such as food and 
fuel and 0.3 percent for services. 
</P>
<P>
	--Construction was led by a 4.7 percent surge in government  
projects, reflecting a big increase for highways and streets. 
Commercial construction increased 3.9 percent, with gains in 
industrial projects, office buildings and retail stores. 
Residential construction rose 0.8 percent.

<HEADLINE> CDC: Anti-Smoking Campaign Works </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Smoking among middle school students in Florida  
dropped 19 percent in the year since the state launched an 
aggressive anti-tobacco campaign aimed at children, the federal 
government said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The decline, which is larger than any nationally among youth  
since 1980, could indicate that the prevalence of teen smoking has 
peaked, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of Florida middle school students who reported having  
smoked cigarettes declined from 18.5 percent in February 1998 to 15 
percent in February 1999. Cigarette use among high schoolers 
dropped from 27.4 percent to 25.2 percent during the same period. 
</P>
<P>
	The Florida Legislature last year allocated $70 million to  
vigorously enforce smoking age limits and for a series of TV and 
radio ads produced by teen-agers that poke fun at the tobacco 
industry. The program started last April. 
</P>
<P>
	``These results show why every state should have a comprehensive  
program to reduce youth smoking and why I oppose any legislation 
waiving the federal government's claim to tobacco settlement funds 
without making a commitment from the states to fund such efforts,'' 
President Clinton said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Since Florida's program was implemented, cigar use among middle  
school students dropped from 14.1 percent to 11.9 percent, the CDC 
said. And fewer sixth-, seventh- and eighth-graders are using 
smokeless tobacco -- 4.9 percent, down from 6.9 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Cigar and smokeless tobacco use dipped only slightly among high  
schoolers. 
</P>
<P>
	After the tobacco industry reached a $206 billion settlement  
with states last November, the nation's two largest cigarette 
makers increased wholesale prices by 45 cents a pack. The CDC said 
the higher prices also may have lowered the rates of teen smoking. 
</P>
<P>
	The study was based on 1998 and 1999 Florida Department of  
Health surveys of 20,000 public school students.

<HEADLINE>  Canadians Celebrate New Territory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IQALUIT, Nunavut (AP) -- With a midnight burst of fireworks over  
a frozen arctic bay, Canada redrew its map today and created the 
new, Inuit-led territory of Nunavut -- one of the world's boldest 
experiments in letting an aboriginal people govern themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	Elders who had dreamed of self-government decades ago stood next  
to small children in temperatures of minus 13 degrees, watching the 
fireworks flare in the moonlit skies over Iqaluit, which became 
North America's newest and most northern capital at the stroke of 
midnight. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of political dignitaries from southern Canada and scores  
of journalists from around the world converged on Iqaluit for 
today's ceremonies, ranging from a speech by Prime Minister Jean 
Chretien to Inuit folk dancing to a heavy-metal rock concert. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like New Year's Eve,'' said Hannah Nutarak after watching  
the fireworks with her two young sons. 
</P>
<P>
	Daniel, 4, ``was a little scared,'' she said, but Joey, 9, was  
proud about Nunavut's birth. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be different now, and better,'' Mrs. Nutarak said.  
``There will be more jobs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nunavut, as big as Western Europe, consists of the eastern 60  
percent of the Northwest Territories. The division is the first 
major change in the map of Canada since Newfoundland joined the 
nation 50 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Nunavut means ``our land'' in the Inuit language, Inuktitut.  
About 85 percent of Nunavut's 25,000 people are Inuit, as are 15 of 
the 19 candidates elected in February to the territorial 
legislature. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is proof that we are committed to reconciling aboriginal  
rights in Canada,'' Indian Affairs Minister Jane Stewart told 
reporters. ``We aren't stuck in the past. We are prepared to evolve 
... I can't tell you the sense of pride this gives me as a 
Canadian.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the foreseeable future, Nunavut will rely on federal funds  
for 90 percent of its budget. Much of that funding is earmarked to 
address severe social problems -- Nunavut's rates of unemployment, 
crime, substance abuse and suicide are among the highest in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart said she was confident that Inuit self-government would  
be a positive step in tackling these problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you bring government closer to the people ... it will be  
more effective than when decisions are made from afar,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The territory's first premier, elected by his fellow  
legislators, is Paul Okalik, 34, the first and only Inuit lawyer in 
Nunavut. 
</P>
<P>
	A soft-spoken man, he watched the fireworks quietly on Iqaluit's  
frigid waterfront, hugging his wife. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really nice,'' he said, then added, ``I'm cold.''  
</P>
<P>
	Just before the fireworks, hundreds of residents gathered at a  
school gymnasium for an interdenominational service blessing the 
new territory. 
</P>
<P>
	``That which we call Nunavut -- our land -- is in fact God's gift  
to us,'' said Anglican Bishop Christopher Williams. ``We are the 
stewards of that gift.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Iqaluit (pronounced Eee-kah-loo-eet), on Baffin Island, is  
normally home to 4,500 people, but is accommodating more than 1,000 
visitors for the ceremonies. All were invited to a community feast 
later today featuring caribou, musk ox and raw seal. 
</P>
<P>
	With only 150 hotel beds in town, visitors were advised to bring  
sleeping bags and were housed in a community college, at military 
barracks, in private homes, even at a drug-and-alcohol treatment 
center. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday evening, officers in scarlet tunics presided at a  
ceremony establishing a Nunavut division of the Royal Canadian 
Mounted Police. Later, the territory's three judges were sworn in. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mounties, responsible for law enforcement throughout  
Nunavut, have a checkered history in the region and were preparing 
an official statement of apology for some actions in the past that 
they have said were insensitive to Inuit values. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, several preliminary ceremonies took place,  
including the presentation of a new Canadian 25 cent coin designed 
by Inuit artists and engraved with an owl and bear.

<HEADLINE> Crackdown of Montenegro Beginning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PODGORICA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Yugoslav President Slobodan  
Milosevic removed Montenegro's army commander and seven other top 
generals Thursday, in what could be the first step in a crackdown 
against the republic's pro-Western government. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States, meanwhile, warned that any attempt to  
undermine Montenegro's government could escalate the conflict with 
NATO. Serbia and tiny Montenegro form Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Yugoslavia's official Tanjug news agency said that Milosevic's  
close ally, Gen. Milorad Obradovic, was named commander of the 
Second Army Corps in Montenegro, replacing Gen. Radosav Martinovic. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no official explanation for the reshuffle, announced  
in the second week of NATO's air attacks on Yugoslavia and seen as 
an effort to tighten Belgrade's control over Montenegro. 
</P>
<P>
	Sources in the Montenegrin government said Martinovic had not  
carried out Milosevic's orders to rein in Montenegro's pro-Western 
administration at a time the country is under attack. 
</P>
<P>
	The sources spoke on condition of anonymity. Their report could  
not be independently confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, State Department spokesman James Rubin said the  
United States is very concerned by the situation in Montenegro. He 
accused Belgrade of engaging in provocations. 
</P>
<P>
	``A Belgrade takeover in Montenegro would destroy the most  
credible and potent democratic force in the Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia and have negative implications throughout the region,'' 
Rubin said. 
</P>
<P>
	He urged the Montenegrin public to remain calm and avoid  
confrontation with security forces. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have reiterated to President Milosevic that world attention  
on Kosovo does not mean that Yugoslavia has a free hand to cause 
problems in other parts of Yugoslavia or the region,'' Rubin said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the military shake-up ordered by Milosevic is a clear  
indication that he has doubts about the loyalty of his forces 
there, and any attempt to overthrow Montenegro's democratically 
elected government would only ``escalate the conflict with NATO.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tanjug said Milosevic also removed seven other senior military  
commanders -- including two infantry generals -- apparently trying to 
boost his defense after NATO strikes and to strengthen his position 
against any possible military coup by officers calling for a 
cease-fire. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite U.S. support for Montenegro, NATO warplanes have  
targeted Yugoslav military facilities in the republic. 
</P>
<P>
	Secretary of State Madeleine Albright recently telephoned  
Montenegrin President Milo Djukanovic and expressed concern about a 
possible attempt by Belgrade to oust his government. 
</P>
<P>
	Montenegro's police force, which is loyal to Djukanovic, has  
indicated its opposition to any Yugoslav army moves against his 
government. 
</P>
<P>
	Montenegro's deputy police commander, Vuk Boskovic, said  
Wednesday that ``the citizens of Montenegro should trust the 
police, which are ready to protect their peace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There are an estimated 10,000 police and 15,000 Yugoslav army  
troops stationed in Montenegro. 
</P>
<P>
	The government sources said they expected the Yugoslav army to  
try and close Montenegro's borders with tanks. Montenegro refused 
to implement a state of war imposed by the Yugoslav government on 
March 24 when NATO started its strikes.

<HEADLINE>  Soldiers Described as Bright, Brave </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	While Serb television showed images of three U.S. servicemen  
captured in Yugoslavia, their relatives and friends back home 
Thursday prayed for the soldiers' safe return and described them as 
brave young men who were proud to serve their country. 
</P>
<P>
	The three soldiers, part of a NATO peacekeeping force, were  
captured Wednesday near the Yugoslav-Macedonian border. 
Yugoslavia's state news agency reported the three will go on 
military trial Friday, a move President Clinton condemned as a 
violation of international treaties. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon identified the soldiers as Staff Sgt. Andrew A.  
Ramirez, 24, of Los Angeles; Staff Sgt. Christopher J. Stone, 25, 
of Smiths Creek, Mich.; and Spc. Steven M. Gonzales, 21, of 
Huntsville, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Gonzales appeared battered and bruised, his family  
expressed relief he didn't look worse. 
</P>
<P>
	His parents, Gilbert and Rosie Gonzales, are both employees of  
the Texas corrections system, and prisons statewide were asked to 
tie yellow ribbons to their entrances until the soldiers are 
released. 
</P>
<P>
	Yellow ribbons also were tied around trees in downtown Capac,  
Mich., where Stone went to high school. Small American flags were 
tied with yellow ribbon on the fence outside the home of Ramirez's 
father in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	``Steven and those other two soldiers don't deserve this,'' Mrs.  
Gonzales said at a news conference Thursday. ``They're young men 
with their whole lives ahead of them who were put in a bad 
situation. We're hopeful for the safe return of all three of 
them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Friends and former teachers said Gonzales was a likable, bright  
athlete during his high school days in Palestine, 90 miles north of 
Huntsville in east Texas. He graduated in 1995 and won a 
scholarship to Texas A&AMP;M, but left after a year to pursue a dream 
of joining an elite Army corps. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was the type of student you'd love to have: hard-working,  
always happy, funny,'' said teacher Kay Stroud, who had Gonzales in 
her advanced placement biology class his senior year. 
</P>
<P>
	A friend, Kelly Williams, recognized her former classmate as  
soon as she saw the Serbian TV pictures. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately, he's got rather big ears. He used to wiggle his  
ears for us and make us laugh,'' she said. ``That's how I knew it 
was him. I was like, you could not mistake those ears.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stone, whose wife and 5-year-old son live in San Antonio, was  
described by former teachers and classmates as a talented athlete 
also blessed with the ``gift of gab.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm surprised he couldn't talk his way out of this,'' said Ken  
Marzka, Stone's cross-country coach at Capac Community 
Junior-Senior High School, about 50 miles northeast of Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	``Chris is a tough kid ... he never quit,'' Marzka said. ``He  
never was great (as a runner),'' Marzka said. ``But when push came 
to shove, he got tougher and tougher. Chris is going to be just 
fine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	School counselor Kathy Kish said Stone was well-liked by

Driving showed his concern for his fellow students, she said.

	In Los Angeles, outside the modest home of Ramirez's divorced  
father, Andy Ramirez, neighbors prayed for the captured staff 
sergeant and reminisced about the ``all-American kid'' they watched 
grow up. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramirez, a wrestler in high school, joined the Army after  
graduation in 1992. He wanted to follow the path of his hero, older 
brother Steven Ramirez, an Army veteran who is now a Los Angeles 
police detective.

<P>
	``Those two brothers are very close. It hit home because we're a  
very united family,'' said Frank Jasso, Ramirez's great-uncle. 
</P>
<P>
	Some neighbors wept as they talked outside the home five miles  
east of downtown. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know he will come back and we will all greet him with open  
arms,'' said neighbor and longtime friend Johnny Rios. ``He's a 
hero now because he did his duty as a military personnel. We just 
thank God for putting him in our lives to serve the country.''

<HEADLINE> Progress Cited in N. Ireland Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- Northern Ireland's politicians  
negotiated through the night and into the morning today in an 
exhausting push to bolster their nearly year-old peace accord. 
</P>
<P>
	As the sun rose over Hillsborough Castle, the prime ministers of  
Britain and Ireland remained locked in debate with Nobel laureates 
and ex-terrorists over how to overcome the most stubborn argument 
throughout four years of peacemaking: When will the Irish 
Republican Army start to disarm? 
</P>
<P>
	The formation of the 12-member administration set out in last  
year's Good Friday accord has been blocked by Protestant demands 
that the IRA disarm before the IRA-allied Sinn Fein party can join. 
The new Protestant-Catholic government for Northern Ireland should 
have been formed by October. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite their marathon mission that began here Monday, British  
Prime Minister Tony Blair and Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern 
hadn't yet bridged the chasm between Sinn Fein and the Ulster 
Unionists. The Ulster Unionists are the major Protestant party 
whose leader, Nobel Peace Prize winner David Trimble, would head 
the Northern Ireland government. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesmen for both prime ministers said they expected either a  
breakthrough sometime today, but more likely was an upbeat 
multiparty declaration summing up the past year's progress and 
expectations for the next. The prime ministers' plan, they said, 
was to emphasize how much good the accord had already delivered, 
but not to continue negotiating on Good Friday this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Sinn Fein Chairman Mitchel McLaughlin said his negotiators had  
stressed to the Ulster Unionists that the only way the IRA might be 
persuaded to start destroying its arms stockpiles was if the 
government could be formed and demonstrated to work. 
</P>
<P>
	``A considerable amount of ideas were generated by all sides.  
None of them, I have to report, have broken the deadlock. None have 
overcome the precondition imposed by the Ulster Unionist Party,'' 
McLaughlin said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ulster Unionists' senior negotiator, Reg Empey, noted it was  
``not simply a matter of an odd word here or there. There are very 
substantial matters still to be resolved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not the ones insisting of getting the benefits of  
democracy while simultaneously sitting on a hundred tons of 
weaponry,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout the night, the Ulster Unionists and Sinn Fein  
involved virtually their entire party leaderships in a series of 
meetings unprecedented in their scope and candor, both sides said. 
Until September, Ulster Unionists had refused to meet Sinn Fein 
leaders.

<HEADLINE> Gas Prices Jump Nearly 12 Cents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The American Automobile Association says  
gasoline prices jumped by nearly 12 cents per gallon in the past 
two weeks, the steepest increase since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	The national average price of self-serve regular unleaded  
gasoline increased 11.8 cents since March 16 to reach $1.088 per 
gallon, the AAA said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	This marks the largest increase since August 1990, after Iraq  
invaded Kuwait, when gas prices increased 23.2 cents, the 
association said. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices for other types of gasoline had smaller increases:  
self-serve mid-grade unleaded gas is up 11.4 cents to $1.178, and 
self-serve premium is up 11.1 cents to $1.235. 
</P>
<P>
	Across the country, prices at the pump have soared, in part  
because world oil producers agreed to take an additional 2.1 
million barrels daily off the market, and because of anticipated 
increases in demand for spring and summer driving. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts have also pointed to refinery production troubles in  
California, one of the largest U.S. driving markets. Gas is most 
expensive in the West, increasing nearly 14 cents in the past two 
weeks to bring self-serve regular unleaded gas to $1.243 a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
	Gas is least expensive in the Southeast at $1.003, an increase  
of 10.6 cents. 
</P>
<P>
	A separate survey found that gasoline prices had increased about  
8.5 cents a gallon in the two weeks leading up to March 19. The 
Lundberg Survey of 10,000 gas stations nationwide found the 
weighted average, including all grades and taxes, had increased to 
$1.0869 cents per gallon in that time period. 
</P>
<P>
	Other regional prices for self-serve unleaded:  
</P>
<P>
	--New England: up 7.2 cents to $1.054.  
</P>
<P>
	--Mid-Atlantic: up 8.8 cents to $1.032.  
</P>
<P>
	--Great Lakes: up 17 cents to $1.123.  
</P>
<P>
	--Midwest: up 11.9 cents to $1.042.  
</P>
<P>
	--Southwest: up 14.5 cents to $1.087.  
</P>
<P>
	The association's Fuel Gauge report is based on data from more  
than 37,000 transaction on March 30.

<HEADLINE> Judge Orders Overseer for Kiwi Air </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- A bankruptcy judge on Thursday ordered a  
federal trustee to take the helm of grounded Kiwi International Air 
Lines to assess if the tiny carrier should be liquidated or allowed 
to fight to fly again. 
</P>
<P>
	Kiwi, awash in debt and without planes to fly or permission to  
fly passengers, consented, telling U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Rosemary 
Gambardella its efforts to reverse last month's emergency 
revocation of its license to fly have failed. 
</P>
<P>
	Gambardella said the trustee must examine if it is worthwhile to  
keep the company alive until mid-April, when Kiwi can appeal the 
revocation by the Federal Aviation Administration to the National 
Transportation Safety Board. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 500 workers could lose their jobs if the trustee, who was  
not immediately named, persuades the judge to pull the plug before 
the hearing. They represent less than half the 1,200-person 
workforce which owned a controlling share of Kiwi at its peak in 
the mid-'90s, when the Newark-based airline had 15 leased jets. 
</P>
<P>
	The employees lost their ownership stake when a Baltimore  
surgeon rescued Kiwi from its first bankruptcy in July 1997, but 
the airline continued on a downward spiral, shedding workers, 
routes and planes. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA on March 24 stunned Kiwi by immediately revoking the  
license to fly, asserting the carrier was unable to fly its 
six-city schedule safely. 
</P>
<P>
	The action came a day after the U.S. Department of  
Transportation threatened to revoke Kiwi's certificate in two 
weeks, charging that the airline did not have adequate managers or 
financing. 
</P>
<P>
	That day, Kiwi filed for bankruptcy protection, offering a  
rescue plan based on a $3 million sale to Pan Am Airways. But 
shortly after Kiwi lost its flight certificate, Pan Am quit the 
deal.

<HEADLINE> FCC Questions SBC-Ameritech Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's top telecommunications regulator  
told SBC Communications and Ameritech Corp. on Thursday that he has 
``serious concerns'' about their planned merger and whether it 
would serve the public interest. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal Communications Commission Chairman Bill Kennard, in  
letters to the companies' chiefs, did not address whether the 
agency would try to block the proposed $57 billion merger if his 
concerns are not alleviated. 
</P>
<P>
	But Kennard said he wants discussions between the companies and  
commission staff to begin to explore ``whether it would be possible 
to craft conditions'' addressing his concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennard did not elaborate on what those conditions should be.  
</P>
<P>
	The merger, cleared by the Justice Department last month, would  
create the nation's largest local phone company that would control 
57 million telephone lines -- or one-third of the country's local 
lines -- spread across 13 states. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other things, Kennard asked how the commission can be  
assured that the merger ``will not interfere with the companies' 
willingness and ability'' to open their local phone markets to 
other companies that want to provide competing local phone and 
other communications services. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennard also wanted to know how the FCC can be assured that the  
public will receive the benefits the companies say will result from 
the union. 
</P>
<P>
	Specifically, Kennard was referring to the companies' claim that  
they need to combine to provide local phone and other services in 
30 targeted markets outside their combined 13-state local region. 
Such a move would have SBC-Ameritech competing against fellow Bell 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies say they will become more efficient and  
financially able to invade markets outside their region, which they 
contend they cannot do separately. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennard also asked how they can assure the commission that the  
merger will improve ``overall consumer welfare.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By law, the FCC must review proposed mergers to determine  
whether they will serve the public interest -- a broad legal 
standard. 
</P>
<P>
	``... at this stage I have serious concerns about whether your  
proposal satisfies this requirement,'' Kennard said in letters to 
SBC Chairman Edward Whitacre Jr. and Ameritech Chairman Richard 
Notebaert. 
</P>
<P>
	Ameritech spokeswoman Lisa Kim responded: ``This is an  
opportunity to put forth the many benefits of this pro-competition, 
pro-consumer merger.'' She said Ameritech believes the FCC will 
approve the deal. SBC had no immediate comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennard said he would like to begin discussions -- the contents  
of which would be made public -- this month and conclude by late 
June. The FCC could rule on the merger sometime thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
	This was the first time Kennard has sent such a letter to  
companies involved in a merger. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer groups and long-distance companies want the FCC to  
block the merger, contending it would thwart local phone 
competition and the prospect of lower prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Gene Kimmelman, co-director of the Consumers Union's  
Washington office, viewed Kennard's letters as a ``welcome sign 
that the chairman of the FCC recognizes the substantial competitive 
dangers of this merger.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But San Antonio-based SBC and Chicago-based Ameritech, supported  
by major telephone unions, say the merger would be good for 
consumers and competition. They say it will spur local phone 
competition and possibly lower prices, accelerate the roll-out of 
high-speed Internet access and data services, and create jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	The 13 states in the proposed merger are Arkansas, California,  
Connecticut, Kansas, Missouri, Nevada, Oklahoma, Texas, Illinois, 
Indiana, Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin.

<HEADLINE> US Raps China, EU, Others on Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration's annual report on  
foreign trade barriers says China, the European Union and Japan 
continue to have unfair practices that hurt U.S. exports, services 
and agricultural goods. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey, released today by the Office of the U.S. Trade  
Representative, lists significant practices harmful to American 
products by 54 trading partners, including its six largest: Canada, 
China, the European Union, Japan, South Korea and Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the report, the administration found China's  
``interlocking and pernicious market access barriers'' a serious 
concern. 
</P>
<P>
	``China's tariffs remain high, particularly when compared to  
those of other major participants in the global trading system and 
restrictive licensing, investment, and distribution practices make 
it difficult for exporters to penetrate Chinese wholesale and 
consumer markets,'' the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the administration said it was encouraged by China's  
recent progress in enforcing anti-piracy efforts to protect 
computer software, videos and CD-ROMs. 
</P>
<P>
	Although U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky left  
Beijing this week without reaching a deal to allow China to join 
the World Trade Organization, the report said the administration is 
``actively engaged in negotiations'' to secure the goal ``on 
commercially meaningful terms.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On its economic relationship with Europe, ``the largest and most  
complex in the world,'' the administration said that battles with 
the European Union over bananas and beef have ``not only hurt U.S. 
exports but have undermined the credibility of the WTO dispute 
settlement system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite hundreds of billions of dollars that are exchanged  
unhindered in annual two-way trade and investments, the report 
found that ``the EU's protectionist agriculture policies are likely 
to continue to cause disputes, unless addressed in upcoming 
multilateral trade negotiations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The administration, in its segment on Japan, said the country  
continues to make opening its markets to U.S. exports a top 
priority, ``emphasizing the need for implementation of fiscal 
stimulus and reform of Japan's financial sector.'' It said the 
administration would press Japan to implement further deregulation 
measures in telecommunications, medical devices, housing and 
pharmaceuticals. 
</P>
<P>
	The report called South Korea ``one of the toughest markets in  
the world for doing business.'' It commended the current Korean 
administration for implementing efforts to put its economy on a 
more open, market-oriented basis, in response to the Asian 
financial crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	``Resistance to key trade reforms remains, however, and many  
issues have arisen on Korea's compliance with its international 
obligations,'' the report said.

<HEADLINE> Coach Harrick Spurns Georgia for RI </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATHENS, Ga. (AP) -- Jim Harrick decided to return to coach Rhode  
Island, a day after he officially accepted the Georgia head 
coaching job. 
</P>
<P>
	Harrick told Georgia president Michael F. Adams on Thursday that  
he had a change of heart. Adams tried to talk him out of the 
decision, but Harrick told him Thursday that his decision was 
final, the university said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're disappointed in Coach Harrick's decision,'' Georgia  
athletic director Vince Dooley said. ``However, the most important 
thing is for him to have total peace of mind and commitment to 
whatever decision he would make.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Adams, who met with Harrick for an hour Thursday, said he told  
Harrick that returning to Rhode Island would be a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
	``However, we wanted a coach who was committed to this  
institution and the future of our basketball program. If he had 
doubts, certainly remaining at Rhode Island would be the correct 
choice.''

<HEADLINE> Everyday Folks Can Sell Via TV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- The latest stars on daytime TV  
aren't soap opera actors or talk show hosts. They're everyday folks 
with too much junk in their garage. 
</P>
<P>
	A husband hawking his wife's Harley. A guy unloading a vintage  
pinball machine. A kid named ``Fast Eddie'' pawning his parents' 
old furniture for summer camp money. 
</P>
<P>
	All these can be found on Pax TV, the family oriented network  
which is selling Floridians 30-second slots of airtime that can be 
used for just about anything: from selling a sofa to singing Happy 
Birthday to Grandma. 
</P>
<P>
	The price: About the same as a newspaper classified. The  
concept: That this televised swap shop might actually work as 
entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's something so sweet and so much fun about real people  
doing commercials,'' said Steve Sohmer, Pax TV's executive vice 
president who conceived the idea of the ``Pax People TV'' program. 
</P>
<P>
	Think funniest home bloopers meets low-budget infomercials.  
</P>
<P>
	The half-hour program began a three-week pilot run in the West  
Palm Beach area on Monday. If deemed a success, it will be put on 
the air on Pax TV's 116 broadcast stations nationwide, Sohmer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Five days of 30-second ads cost $27.50, or $62.50 if the item  
being sold is worth more than $500. Nothing political or off-color 
is allowed. 
</P>
<P>
	``This makes television accessible, maybe for the first time, to  
everyone,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	That was certainly the appeal for retirees Don and Ruth  
Chenoweth, regular viewers of Pax TV. They decided to try to create 
an ad for their $13,000 double-wide trailer in Lantana, about 70 
miles north of Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	``She felt like a movie star,'' Chenoweth said of his wife. The  
couple got some help from a Pax TV crew in making the commercial. 
``She always wanted to get into advertising, ... but nothing ever 
panned out. This was her opportunity to be on TV.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That could be as much of the attraction to ``Pax People TV'' as  
the possibility of selling something, said James Twitchell, a 
University of Florida professor who writes about American culture. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is this really advertising to sell, or is this advertising as  
a kind of self aggrandizement, a type of ... entertainment?'' 
Twitchell said. ``For a relatively small sum of money, anyone can 
be Frank Perdue. ... It's sort of celebrity on the cheap.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Robert Thompson, director of the Center for the Study of  
Popular Television at Syracuse University, said Pax TV may have 
seized on a compelling idea in an industry that's increasingly 
fragmented. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think a nicely packaged half-hour show with a bunch of  
salt-of-the-earth Americans with their Franklin Mint collections -- 
the garage sale -- will be fairly compelling viewing, for a while at 
least,'' Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Susan Berlinger-Schwartz was uneasy about the idea.  
Though she accepted two free introductory 60-second ads for her 
Boca Raton Speech and Rehabilitation Center, she's still not sure 
``Pax People TV'' is where she should be advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe it's an interesting concept, but I feel as though  
'professional' should be separated from 'sales','' she said. ``I 
don't want my piece to be a funny piece -- my piece is a 
professional piece.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The show currently airs at 11:30 a.m. weekdays -- when Pax TV  
would otherwise be showing infomercials. 
</P>
<P>
	Pax TV is an arm of Paxson Communications Corp., the nation's  
largest owner and operator of broadcast television stations. It 
launched Pax TV as a broadcast network in November 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Expanding the boundaries of television advertising is not  
unusual to Paxson's owner, Lowell ``Bud'' Paxson, who was a 
co-founder of the Home Shopping Network and immediately embraced 
the video classified idea, Sohmer said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are some things that belong on television,'' Sohmer  
said. ``I'm a big ballet fan -- the ballet doesn't belong on 
television. But this thing works. There's something 'television' 
about it.''

<HEADLINE> Bonds Slip on Strong Manufacturing / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices fell Thursday as signs of strength  
in the U.S. manufacturing sector further eroded hopes for more 
interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell 11/16  
point, or $6.88 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in 
the opposite direction, rose to 5.67 percent from 5.62 percent late 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Manufacturing activity grew in March for the second straight  
month, according to a survey of corporate purchasing executives by 
the National Association of Purchasing Management in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest sign of economic strength dampened hopes for lower  
rate cuts, which would boost the value of bonds. Higher rates, as 
well as the inflation that can result from rapid economic growth, 
hurt the value of investments like bonds that pay a fixed rate of 
return. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market, prices of short-term Treasury securities  
were off between 1/32 point and 3/32 point, and intermediate 
maturities were down 1/8 point to 1/4 point, reported Bridge Telerate, 
a financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 4.41 percent as the  
discount fell 0.07 percentage point to 4.30 percent. Six-month 
yields were 4.49 percent, as the discount fell 0.02 percentage 
point to 4.33 percent. One-year yields were 4.69 percent as the 
discount was unchanged from late Wednesday at 4.47 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, rose to 5.50 percent from 5.12 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds fell to 123 29/32 from 124 1/8. The average 
yield to maturity rose to 5.25 percent from 5.23 percent.

	Today's Highlight in History:  
</P>
<P>
	On April 2, 1917, President Wilson asked Congress to declare war

<HEADLINE> Comic Gary Morton Dies at 74 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RANCHO MIRAGE, Calif. (AP) -- Gary Morton, the Borscht Belt comic  
who married Lucille Ball and became her executive producer, has 
died. He was 74. 
</P>
<P>
	Morton died Tuesday at Eisenhower Memorial Hospital, said John  
Caranci of Wiefels &AMP; Son Funeral Directors in Palm Springs. The 
cause of death wasn't disclosed, but Daily Variety reported he died 
of lung cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Morton, a stand-up comic, married Miss Ball after she divorced  
Desi Arnaz, her ``I Love Lucy'' sidekick. Morton and the actress 
were married for 29 years; Miss Ball died in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	He was executive producer of Miss Ball's ``The Lucy Show,''  
which aired 1962-68, ``Here's Lucy'' from 1968-74 and ``Life With 
Lucy,'' which was canceled after two months in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	Morton also had supporting roles in films, including ``Lenny''  
in 1974 and ``Postcards From the Edge'' in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Born Morton Goldaper in New York City, Morton became a popular  
nightclub comedian in New York, Miami, Chicago, Las Vegas and the 
Borscht Belt before Miss Ball brought him to Hollywood and 
television. 
</P>
<P>
	After their marriage, Morton became involved with Miss Ball's TV  
career as warmup comedian for her second CBS sitcom, ``The Lucy 
Show,'' for which ex-husband Arnaz was executive producer for a 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	Upon Miss Ball's sale of Desilu to Paramount in 1967, she formed  
a new company, Lucille Ball Productions, naming Morton vice 
president. That company produced ``Here's Lucy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Over the years, Morton continued to do the warmups for the  
series. 
</P>
<P>
	Morton also produced several Lucille Ball television specials  
through the 1970s, and other specials and films for television, 
including ``Bungle Abbey'' in 1981 and ``Sentimental Journey'' in 
1984. 
</P>
<P>
	In motion pictures, he was executive producer of the 1983 ``All  
the Right Moves,'' which starred Tom Cruise as a high school 
football star. 
</P>
<P>
	He is survived by his wife of three years, Susie McAllister.

<HEADLINE> BP Acquiring Arco for $26.6 Billion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- In a February speech to oil industry leaders,  
Arco chairman Mike Bowlin declared that the ``last days of the age 
of oil'' had begun. 
</P>
<P>
	Few, if any, in the audience, knew that the last days of Arco  
also were unfolding as a result of quiet negotiations Bowlin had 
initiated weeks earlier with Arco's bigger rival, BP Amoco. 
</P>
<P>
	The fate of Atlantic Richfield Co. was revealed on Thursday when  
the two companies announced that BP Amoco would swallow Arco in a 
$25.6 billion stock deal that will create the world's 
second-largest oil company. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, expected to save the combined companies about $1  
billion a year, would be the eighth merger of the past six months 
in an industry shaken by more than a year of plummeting oil prices 
and increasing demands for cleaner fuels. 
</P>
<P>
	Arco's senior management, including Bowlin, will resign. The new  
company will be known as BP Amoco, but the Arco retail gasoline 
brand will continue for the time being. 
</P>
<P>
	During a news conference Thursday, Bowlin said he was confident  
Arco could have survived on its own but the combination with BP 
Amoco will be better for shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
	``We did this because we think it creates a really terrific  
company from our viewpoint, even though it's a bittersweet moment 
for us,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shareholders will get .82 share of BP Amoco stock for each share  
of Arco, a premium of 26 percent over Arco's price before the 
negotiations were made public on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The value of the deal -- initially pegged at $26.8 billion --  
shrank as shares of BP Amoco fell in trading on the New York Stock 
Exchange. American Depositary Shares of BP Amoco were at $95.81 1/4, 
down $5.18 3/4 while shares of Arco fell 68 3/4 cents to $72.81 1/4, also on 
the Big Board. 
</P>
<P>
	BP Amoco plans to sell about $3 billion in overlapping assets.  
About 2,000 jobs are expected to be eliminated from a combined work 
force of 115,000, mainly in the United States outside Alaska, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Idled workers will be able to pick from several severance  
options. Bowlin will leave Arco with $3.2 million in salary and 
bonuses plus another $29.3 million in exercisable stock options, 
according to estimates by Executive Compensation Advisory Services 
based on Arco's proxy statements. 
</P>
<P>
	As crude prices began to fall in late 1997, Arco was hit harder  
than most. Over the past two years the company had shed its 
chemicals and coal mining operations, leaving it more dependent on 
oil and more vulnerable to price fluctuations. 
</P>
<P>
	Worried about Arco's ability to compete, Bowlin last year began  
looking at possible mergers. He considered trying to boost Arco's 
clout by buying smaller companies. Then he looked at offering Arco 
to bigger corporations, finally settling on BP Amoco, a company run 
by Bowlin's old friend, John Browne. 
</P>
<P>
	In January, he called Browne with a proposition.  
</P>
<P>
	``I phoned him in his office and said, 'We ought to get together  
and talk about ways we could cooperate. He said, 'OK,' '' Bowlin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Only weeks earlier, British Petroleum had acquired Chicago-based  
Amoco in a $57.6 billion deal. But Browne jumped at the opportunity 
to deepen his reach in the United States by picking up Arco's 
Alaskan oil and gas reserves and its West Coast refining and 
retailing operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Together Arco and BP Amoco operate the giant Prudhoe Bay field  
in Alaska. Also, Arco expects to have its 360 million-barrel Alpine 
field operating in about two years. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's largest oil producer would be created by combining  
Arco's dominant West Coast business with BP Amoco's Midwest and 
East Coast operations. 
</P>
<P>
	BP Amoco also will obtain Arco's natural gas interests in Asia,  
which include up to 8 trillion cubic feet in Indonesia. Arco also 
has gas reserves in Qatar and oil interests in Algeria, Venezuela 
and Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	Browne's interest in developing natural gas as a cleaner  
alternative to petroleum was another element that attracted Bowlin 
to BP Amoco, the Arco chief said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	In his February speech to a Houston gathering of oil industry  
leaders, Bowlin said the demand for oil would diminish in the next 
century as the demand for low-polluting energy grows. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nations of the world that are striving to modernize will make  
choices different from the ones we have made. They will have to. 
And even today's industrial powers will shift energy use 
patterns,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowlin's outlook probably stemmed in part from Arco's growing  
vulnerability, said Fadel Gheit, an analyst with Fahnestock &AMP; Co. 
in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``In order to grow the company, he didn't have the financial  
flexibility that was needed,'' Gheit said. ``He was already talking 
to BP so he knew the end was near.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bowlin made the right move in initiating the merger, said Eugene  
Nowak, a New York-based analyst with ABN Amro Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	``Combined, it provides a greater opportunity for the growth of  
Arco,'' he said. ``Obviously, Arco is very leveraged with oil 
prices. I think (prices) dropped to the point where CEOs -- not just 
Mike Bowlin -- were rethinking their strategy.''

<HEADLINE> Parties Work Together in Congress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- From Jesse Helms to Ted Kennedy, Republicans  
and Democrats are finding that in this age of political distrust, 
they still need each other to get things done in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Measures on such touchy subjects as tobacco, taxes and health  
care are being offered jointly by Republicans and Democrats who 
know that without a soulmate from the other party, their bills are 
likely to go nowhere. 
</P>
<P>
	Campaign finance reform, mainly a Democratic priority, made  
headway last year and is back again this year, in part because two 
Republicans, Rep. Christopher Shays of Connecticut and Sen. John 
McCain of Arizona, joined two Democrats, Rep. Marty Meehan of 
Massachusetts and Sen. Russ Feingold of Wisconsin, in sponsoring 
the House and Senate bills. 
</P>
<P>
	Reining in government regulations, long a goal of Republicans,  
has some chance of advancing this year because Sen. Fred Thompson, 
R-Tenn., has a Democrat, Sen. Carl Levin of Michigan, as his 
legislative partner. 
</P>
<P>
	``It takes a long time to get the credibility to pass a bill  
like campaign finance reform,'' Meehan said. ``With Republicans in 
the majority, having Chris Shays being the lead on this bill was 
extremely important.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Northeastern Democrat is also working with a Western  
Republican, Rep. James Hansen of Utah, on a bill requiring states 
to set aside a quarter of tobacco settlement money on smoking 
health and awareness programs. ``We don't agree on very many 
issues, but we do on tobacco,'' Meehan said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the House, Republicans holding a slim 11-seat majority need  
all the Democratic help they can get. In the Senate, where the 
minority holds more sway because of filibuster rules, there's long 
been a tradition of reaching across the aisle. 
</P>
<P>
	``When it's a controversial bill, it is almost a necessity if  
you are going to get beyond the filibuster,'' said Sen. Charles 
Grassley, R-Iowa, who is teaming this year with Sen. Bob Graham, 
D-Fla., on a bill making it easier to carry pensions from one job 
to another and with Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., on a bankruptcy 
overhaul bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate historian Donald Ritchie recalled how liberal Robert  
Wagner, a New York Democrat, joined with conservative Robert Taft, 
an Ohio Republican, to bring opposing sides together on a major 
public housing legislation after World War II. ``There's historical 
precedent for bipartisanship,'' he said. ``Perhaps they are now 
reverting to form.'' 
</P>
<P>
	GOP-Democratic cooperation was even evident during the Senate  
impeachment trial. Sens. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., and Joseph 
Lieberman, D-Conn., unsuccessfully pushed a plan to limit the trial 
to one week, and Sens. Robert Bennett, R-Utah, and Dianne 
Feinstein, D-Calif., joined later, again unsuccessfully, on a 
resolution to censure President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Moderates such as Feinstein are the most apt to work with the  
opposition. Last year she and Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, backed one 
of the big anti-tobacco bills. This year she has proposed a crime 
victims constitutional amendment with Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., a Y2K 
liability bill with Hatch, a money-laundering bill with Sen. Paul 
Coverdell, R-Ga., and a bill involving hospital stays for 
mastectomy patients with Sen. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine. 
</P>
<P>
	But sometimes the partnerships span wide ideological  
differences. Conservative Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., and Democratic 
loyalist Torricelli are jointly behind a bill to help Taiwan better 
defend itself. 
</P>
<P>
	A Democratic-drafted HMO consumer protection plan that nearly  
passed the House last year paired Rep. John Dingell, a pro-labor 
Democrat from Michigan, with Rep. Greg Ganske, a wealthy Republican 
surgeon from Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the odder couples is Hatch and Kennedy, who have crossed  
ideological lines to co-author several bills, including an 
unsuccessful attempt in the last Congress to extend health care to 
more uninsured children. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always feel better if I can find a Democrat,'' the  
conservative Hatch said. ``I shriek for joy and jump up and down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy, D-Mass., a champion of liberal causes, is also regarded  
as a master of the political compromise. He has sponsored bills 
with such conservatives as Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., and former 
Sen. Lauch Faircloth, R-N.C., and in the 1980s pushed through a big 
jobs bill with then-Sen. Dan Quayle, R-Ind. 
</P>
<P>
	And after the Clinton White House failed in its attempt to  
revolutionize the health care system, it was Kennedy who stepped 
forward with then-Sen. Nancy Kassebaum, R-Kan., in 1996 to pass a 
more modest but still significant bill making it easier to carry 
health insurance from one job to another.

<HEADLINE> Followers Concerned About Farrakhan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite reports of their leader's swift  
recovery, Nation of Islam officials say they are gravely concerned 
for the health of Louis Farrakhan. 
</P>
<P>
	Farrakhan is recovering from surgery he underwent Wednesday  
related to his prostate cancer. His chief of staff said then that 
Farrakhan's treatment ``continues to be successful and his 
prognosis is excellent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But a Nation of Islam member, speaking on condition of  
anonymity, said there are serious worries within the organization 
about Farrakhan's health. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is nervousness,'' said a Nation of Islam member, who  
requested anonymity. ``At this point, we are simply hoping for the 
best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The source said members of the Nation of Islam recognized the  
gravity of the situation when Farrakhan's family accompanied him on 
this round of medical treatments. Farrakhan, his family -- including 
his wife, daughter and son-in-law -- and an entourage flew here 
Tuesday from Chicago 
</P>
<P>
	Members were also stunned at how Farrakhan looked at an event in  
February, the source said. 
</P>
<P>
	Farrakhan, 65, was first treated for prostate cancer in 1991,  
using a hormonal therapy. Three years later, doctors began 
implanting bits of radioactive metal in a bid to kill cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Farrakhan has 238 such seeds. Two weeks ago, his doctor, Abdul  
Alim Muhammad, said Farrakhan's score on a prostate specific 
antigen test has ranged from an ominous 16 to below one -- a level 
shown by men who are free of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	The Washington Post, in Friday's editions, reported that  
Farrakhan was again receiving the radioactive seed treatment this 
week while at Howard University Hospital. One university hospital 
source told the Post that Farrakhan was in ``very bad shape.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Farrakhan has been ill since early January with an undiagnosed  
condition, according to an article last month in Final Call, the 
Nation of Islam newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	Final Call quoted the minister as saying in a Feb. 28 speech  
that he had lost 20 pounds in two weeks and had ``no appetite, 
night sweats ... the after-effects of radiation therapy and other 
things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, civil rights leader Jesse Jackson revealed that  
Farrakhan had undergone surgery for his cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fortunately because he has kept up with it and maintained the  
discipline he's been able to more or less control it,'' Jackson 
said. ``And my sense is that the doctors today are satisfied with 
the effect of their work today. We can only pray and hope for the 
best results.''

<HEADLINE> Missouri Coach Stewart Might Resign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBIA, Mo. (AP) -- Is Norm Stewart retiring as coach at  
Missouri after a falling-out with athletic director Mike Alden? 
</P>
<P>
	No one at the university would confirm or deny published reports  
that Stewart, seventh among major college coaches with 731 
victories, is leaving the program after 32 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Alden scheduled a news conference this morning at the Hearnes  
Center in Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart, 64, and his lawyer spent Wednesday discussing a buyout  
of the last two years of Stewart's contract, several TV stations 
and newspapers reported. 
</P>
<P>
	KMOV-TV in St. Louis, WDAF-TV in Kansas City, The Kansas City  
Star and the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported that Stewart would 
retire. WDAF said that Stewart initiated a buyout of his contract, 
and that Duke assistant Quin Snyder was a leading candidate to 
replace Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
	But Snyder told the Star that he had not talked to anyone at  
Missouri about the job and would not be at today's news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great job,'' Snyder said Wednesday. ``But I've never  
talked to Mike Alden.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not having any comments. You need to talk to Mike Alden,''  
Stewart said Wednesday night as he left his office. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tomorrow's April Fools,''' Stewart jokingly added.  
</P>
<P>
	Reached at home later in the evening by the AP, Stewart again  
referred reporters to Alden. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart's lawyer, Steve Owen, also had no comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Stewart, who also coached six years at Northern Iowa, was  
634-333 at Missouri and 731-375 overall. He took Missouri to the 
NCAA tournament 16 times, twice advancing to the regional final. 
This season's team was 20-9, but lost in the first round of the 
NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Television reports in St. Louis and Columbia on Wednesday said  
some players threatened to transfer if Stewart returned next 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Four starters were to come back next year, though standout  
Albert White is considering skipping his senior year if he is 
drafted by an NBA team. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not immediately clear what prompted Stewart's decision,  
but several media reports hinted that he and Alden may have had a 
falling-out over White's situation. 
</P>
<P>
	Alden reportedly told Stewart, who attended the Final Four last  
weekend in St. Petersburg, Fla., to return to Columbia to talk 
about the future of the program rather than go to his vacation home 
in Palm Springs, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart apparently did not return to Columbia.  
</P>
<P>
	Word that Stewart would step down caught many Tigers fans by  
surprise. 
</P>
<P>
	Kyle Oelrichs, a junior at Missouri, said he heard the news  
Wednesday night on ESPN. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a suspicion that somebody is showing him the door,'' he  
said. ``It's going to be better for recruiting. He hasn't landed a 
lot of big recruits lately. I think there are a lot of people 
around who are glad to see him go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart, a native of Shelbyville, Mo., and a Missouri graduate,  
came to Columbia in 1968 to rebuild a program that had won only six 
of 49 games the previous two seasons. His teams had 17 20-victory 
seasons, topped by the 1989 club's 29-8 mark. The 1994 team that 
advanced to the regional final was 28-4. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, he's posted records of 20-9, 18-15, 16-17, 17-15 and  
20-9. This year's team shared second place in the Big 12. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart played basketball and baseball at Missouri. He led the  
Big Seven Conference in scoring with 24.1 points per game in 
1955-56. He spent one season with the NBA's St. Louis Hawks and a 
year in the Baltimore Orioles' minor league system. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart won a battle with colon cancer in 1989 and five years  
later began the Coaches vs. Cancer program. Individuals and 
corporations across the state pledge money for every 3-pointer made 
by Missouri, and in the first year of the program the Tigers broke 
the school record with 204. 
</P>
<P>
	Over 100 schools take part in the program.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think someday we should be able to raise 15 or 20 million  
dollars nationwide,'' said Syracuse coach Jim Boeheim, whose school 
also is a major contributor to the program. ``People will remember 
it began with the rough, gruff, obnoxious guy from Missouri.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One wealthy backer of Missouri's sports programs, Stan Kroenke  
of Columbia, said Wednesday night that he hadn't spoken to Stewart 
because the coach was recruiting his son, 18-year-old Josh Kroenke, 
to play for the Tigers. 
</P>
<P>
	But Kroenke told the AP, ``I've heard rumors Norm was thinking  
about stepping down, and his wife has joked about it. I think Norm 
has earned a break. It's a hugely competitive environment and if 
anybody's earned it, Norm has. 
</P>
<P>
	``Norm Stewart's legacy is clear: he's the man who has stood for  
Missouri basketball for years, and he has brought basketball to a 
different level at Missouri, and a level we can be proud of.''

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bringing in Diane Sawyer and Charles Gibson as  
hosts has paid off in heartening ratings news for ABC's ``Good

<P>
	For the first three months of 1999, ``Good Morning America''  
increased its average audience to 3.93 million from 3.29 million in 
the fourth quarter of 1998, according to Nielsen Media Research 
figures released Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The program is still second to NBC's ``Today,'' which had an  
average audience of 6.15 million people. CBS's ``This Morning'' was 
third with 3.08 million, Nielsen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sawyer and Gibson began as temporary hosts in January when the  
ratings slide at ``Good Morning America'' accelerated. ABC isn't 
talking about how long the new team will stay on the air. But 
success may mean continued early-morning wakeup calls for both of 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, we're pleased that people are tuning in,'' ABC  
spokeswoman Sonya McNair said. ``As we all know, this is a 
marathon. We've said from the beginning our focus remains on 
improving the broadcast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Good Morning America'' ratings are still virtually  
identical to those for the first three months of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today'' had its second highest quarterly rating ever,  
executive producer Jeff Zucker said. Only the first three months of 
last year, when the Monica Lewinsky scandal broke, were higher for 
NBC's dominant morning show. 
</P>
<P>
	About a million more people watched the three network morning  
news shows during the first quarter than during the last three 
months of 1998. Zucker said some increase in viewership is common 
when people return to their routines after the holidays 
</P>
<P>
	CBS has to be concerned, however, about the increased distance  
between ``This Morning'' and ``Good Morning America.'' CBS is 
talking to former ``Today'' host Bryant Gumbel about returning to 
morning television.

<HEADLINE> Diana Lookalikes Now Pose As Sophie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- When Princess Diana died suddenly, so did the  
market for her lookalikes. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost nobody was interested in hiring a Diana double after the  
princess perished in a Paris car crash. And most of the lookalikes 
thought it in bad taste to accept post-crash engagements. 
</P>
<P>
	But now the handful of women who sheathed themselves in designer  
dresses and pretended to the Princess of Wales are in demand again 
-- as doubles for Prince Edward's bride-to-be, Sophie Rhys-Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the youngest son of Queen Elizabeth II and Miss Rhys-Jones  
announced their engagement in January, bookings for Sophie doubles 
have shot up as newspapers, magazines, television shows and bridal 
boutiques begin to hype the June 19 royal nuptials. 
</P>
<P>
	I find it a bit creepy, really,'' said Susan Scott, owner of a  
London lookalike agency now booking a half-dozen former ``Dianas'' 
as doubles for Miss Rhys-Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Miss Rhys-Jones is considerably shorter and a bit rounder  
than the princess, the resemblance is very much there and -- much to 
the chagrin of the bride-to-be and royal family -- incessantly noted 
in the British press. 
</P>
<P>
	``Basically, I just got my hair cut like Sophie,'' said Sue  
Rice, a former Diana lookalike. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Rice just finished posing for a newspaper series suggesting  
different looks for Miss Rhys-Jones. She also has modeled wedding 
dresses for a bridal shop and fooled tourists outside Buckingham 
Palace as part of a stunt for German television. 
</P>
<P>
	It all can be pretty lucrative: The compensation per event  
starts at around 350 pounds ($570). 
</P>
<P>
	Former Diana double Tracy Sheriff said Miss Rhys-Jones' relative  
lack of exposure makes it easier to capture her than the moody 
princess whose shy glances behind heavy lashes were so familiar to 
the world. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't have to put on a particular act as such,'' said Ms.  
Sheriff, who now spends her spare time collecting and studying 
pictures of the princess-to-be. 
</P>
<P>
	Ray Whiting, owner of the London lookalike agency Derrick's  
Doubles, said he's had 30 to 40 requests for Sophie doubles since 
the engagement, with the former Dianas filling the bill nicely. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got some brand new Edwards coming on now, too,'' he said.

<HEADLINE>  2nd Death Sentence in Cuba Bombings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAVANA (AP) -- A court sentenced to death a second man convicted  
in a string of tourist hotel bombings that leader Fidel Castro 
blames on Cuban exiles in the United States, the government said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The death sentence comes amid a general toughening by Cuba,  
which in recent months has said it feels under growing attack by 
the U.S. government, violent Cuban groups in Miami and domestic 
political dissidents. 
</P>
<P>
	Otto Rene Rodriguez Llerena confessed to the 1997 explosion in  
the lobby of the upscale Melia Cohiba Hotel, which caused no 
injuries and very little damage. 
</P>
<P>
	The Salvadoran, arrested last year at Havana's international  
airport, was also convicted of attempting to import explosives for 
attacks on historical sites cherished by the communist government. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez Llerena's sentence will be appealed immediately to the  
Supreme Court, the Communist Party daily Granma reported Thursday 
in the first official confirmation of the decision. 
</P>
<P>
	The government did not say when the sentence was handed down.  
</P>
<P>
	The announcement of his sentence came a week after another  
Salvadoran, Raul Ernesto Cruz Leon, was sentenced to death for 
bombings at five hotels and a restaurant in a plot to scare away 
tourists from Cuba. The blasts killed an Italian man and injured 11 
people, including seven foreigners. 
</P>
<P>
	During Cruz Leon's trial, prosecutors sought to show that  
leaders of the Miami-based Cuban-American National Foundation 
recruited and paid Cruz Leon, arrested in 1997, to plant the bombs. 
</P>
<P>
	The foundation repeatedly has denied that it funded the  
bombings. 
</P>
<P>
	Cruz Leon's decision also was immediately appealed to the  
Supreme Court, as required by Cuban law. If the court upholds the 
decisions for both men, they will face execution by firing squad. 
</P>
<P>
	In Rodriguez Llerena's case, the prosecution initially sought a  
30-year sentence but later upgraded it to the death penalty after 
testimony indicated he was involved in a plan to attack historical 
sites. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuban exiles allegedly had paid him to investigate possibly  
bombing the Museum of the Revolution in Havana, the tomb of 
revolutionary icon Ernesto ``Che'' Guevara in the central city of 
Santa Clara, and Antonio Maceo Plaza in the eastern city of 
Santiago, dedicated to a hero of Cuba's battle for independence 
from Spain. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Cuban people, who over 40 years have been victim and  
witness to so many criminal actions, are especially upset and 
irritated by the monstrosity revealed by the failed terrorist 
plot,'' Trabajadores, the Communist Party's workers weekly 
newspaper, said of the plot in an editorial last month.

<HEADLINE> Pa. Student Standing Trial As Adult </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- A 15-year-old accused of killing a science  
teacher at a middle-school dance last year will be tried as an 
adult. 
</P>
<P>
	The pain that the shooting caused the victim's family and the  
community outweighed Andrew Wurst's immaturity and claims of mental 
illness, Erie County Judge Michael Palmisano wrote Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The evidence suggests the defendant made a conscious decision  
to arm himself with a deadly weapon and ammunition, after which he 
selected his victims and executed his plan,'' the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wurst is charged with killing teacher John Gillette at a Parker  
Middle School graduation dance in Edinboro in April 1998. Wurst was 
14 and in eighth grade at the time. He also faces two attempted 
murder counts for wounding two students, among other charges. 
</P>
<P>
	State law mandates Wurst be tried as an adult because  
authorities charged him with homicide. The teen's attorney had 
asked Palmisano to try Wurst in juvenile court, arguing he was more 
likely to get treatment for mental disorders in a youth facility.

<HEADLINE>  Tokyo Shares Close Sharply Higher / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo stock prices got a big boost today when  
domestic and foreign investors scooped up shares on the first day 
of Japan's new fiscal year. The dollar slipped against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 490.97 points, or 3.10  
percent, to close the day's trading at 16,327.56. On Wednesday, the 
average lost 22.53 points, or 0.14 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 118.52 yen in late trading, down 1.46 yen from  
late Wednesday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level of 
118.97 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, the fiscal year began with a bang on active  
buying by both foreign and domestic players, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The swing factor is domestic investors, or institutional  
investors, coming into the market in the new fiscal year with their 
hands free,'' said Chuck Lambert, market analyst at Jardine Fleming 
Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign investors, he said, continued to buy, ``the same as  
always.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buying was encouraged by the belief that a flood of new Japanese  
pension fund money would enter the market in April and by recent 
indications that Japanese companies are serious about 
restructuring, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	In specific stocks, shares of Mitsubishi Electric rallied after  
the company announced plans Wednesday to cut 10 percent of its 
global workforce in an effort to erase growing losses. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 726 million shares changed hands on the first  
section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, sharply up from 480 million 
shares traded the previous day. Advances outnumbered declines 764 
to 441, while 110 issues were unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section finished up 33.22 points, or 2.6 percent, to 1,300.44 
points. The TOPIX had fallen 2.02 points, or 0.16 percent, the 
previous day. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average closed at 9,786.16  
points Wednesday, down 127.10. 
</P>
<P>
	On the foreign exchange market, the dollar moved lower against  
the yen on selling by overseas funds amid growing bearish sentiment 
for the U.S. currency. 
</P>
<P>
	Dollar-supportive remarks from an influential Japanese official,  
however, helped slow the pace of its fall. 
</P>
<P>
	In global trading on Wednesday, the dollar plummeted nearly 3  
yen from a high of 120.94 yen, beginning today's trading on a weak 
note, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	``After the dollar failed to break above 121 yen Wednesday,  
dollar-bearish sentiment kicked in and is still looming,'' said 
Katsuaki Tanaka, a trader at Nippon Credit Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	But verbal intervention today from Japanese Vice Finance  
Minister for International Affairs Eisuke Sakakibara put the brakes 
on the dollar's slide, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the current time, we maintain a stance that excessive yen  
strength isn't desirable,'' Sakakibara told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the euro was traded at 128.42 yen, down from 128.59  
yen late Wednesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 211 10-year Japanese government  
bond fell to 1.715 percent from Wednesday's finish of 1.760 
percent, driving its price up to 100.73 yen from 100.34 yen.

<HEADLINE> 'Jenny Jones' Civil Trial Begins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- In a crass desire for ratings, ``The Jenny  
Jones Show'' orchestrated a public humiliation that led to the 
death of a guest who admitted to a secret gay crush on camera, a 
lawyer suing the program argued. 
</P>
<P>
	```The Jenny Jones Show' solicited the victim, Scott Amedure,  
picked his murderer, Jonathan Schmitz, provided the motive for the 
murderer and did everything but pull the trigger, and they must be 
held accountable,'' Geoffrey Fieger said Wednesday during opening 
statements in the civil trial. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial was to resume today.  
</P>
<P>
	Amedure's family is suing the show, distributor Warner Bros. and  
producer Telepictures Productions, claiming their ``ambush'' TV 
tactics drove Schmitz to shoot Amedure in 1995. The family is 
seeking $50 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Amedure was killed just three days after the two appeared on the  
show, which never aired. 
</P>
<P>
	Schmitz, who has said he is heterosexual, was invited on the  
show to meet a secret admirer. He discovered that it was Amedure, 
an acquaintance who described his sexual fantasies involving 
Schmitz as the audience whooped and hollered. 
</P>
<P>
	In his own opening remarks, defense lawyer James Feeney told the  
jury his clients are not responsible because Schmitz knew that the 
secret admirer could be a man. 
</P>
<P>
	Schmitz was found guilty of murder in 1996, but the conviction  
was overturned because of an error in jury selection. He is 
awaiting a retrial. His lawyers admitted he killed Amedure but 
contended the show humiliated Schmitz, who was fighting alcoholism, 
depression and a thyroid condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Fieger pressed that claim Wednesday, accusing the show of  
``tricking and cajoling'' Schmitz into appearing on the program for 
the sake of ratings and advertising revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fuse was lit, and his descent into madness began,'' Fieger  
said of Schmitz. 
</P>
<P>
	Fieger, the former lawyer for assisted suicide advocate Jack  
Kevorkian, called the program negligent in failing to research 
Schmitz's emotional background. Feeney said there was no reason to 
examine a guest's mental health. 
</P>
<P>
	Feeney said that during a pre-show interview, Schmitz told a  
program representative he had ``no clue'' who his secret admirer 
was, but seemed relatively unconcerned when told it could be a man. 
</P>
<P>
	```I'll say thanks, but no thanks,''' Feeney quoted Schmitz as  
telling the show's representative. ```It would be a disappointment, 
but don't worry, I'll be OK.'''

<HEADLINE> Sharks' Zyuzin Is AWOL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                         *BY ANNE M. PETERSON   	
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks ago, defenseman Andrei Zyuzin abandoned the San Jose  
Sharks and abruptly fired his agent. 
</P>
<P>
	Zyuzin missed a March 19 team flight to Boston and dismissed Jay  
Grossman in favor of a Ukrainian named Vitaly Shevchenko, who is 
uncertified as an NHL agent and reportedly under investigation by 
the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
	And so began the strange saga of Zyuzin's defection from the  
Sharks, just as the team makes its final push toward the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Zyuzin, popular with the fans and his teammates, is currently in  
Vancouver with Shevchenko as the Sharks play out the regular 
season. While the team had no choice but to suspend the 21-year-old 
without pay, there are still hopes for his return. 
</P>
<P>
	But every day the chances appear to grow slimmer.  
</P>
<P>
	In an interview this week with Canadian television, Zyuzin  
blamed Sharks coach Darryl Sutter for his troubles. The Russian 
also addressed general manager Dean Lombardi. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to tell Dean Lombardi and Darryl Sutter, I'm not going  
back to San Jose because they didn't do right to me in my 
situation,'' he said. ``I'm asking Dean Lombardi for a trade from 
the San Jose Sharks. I'm not going back to the San Jose Sharks 
team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Apparently Zyuzin had asked for a trade three days before the  
NHL deadline last Tuesday, and was threatening to sit out until the 
Sharks promised to trade him during the offseason. With the 
deadline passed, the Sharks cannot trade Zyuzin this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Shevchenko, now a constant presence in Zyuzin's life, remained  
close by during the rare interview -- one of the conditions for it. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Shevchenko is uncertified by the NHL Players  
Association, he has filed an application. Until he is certified, 
the Sharks can't deal with him, tying the team's hands. 
</P>
<P>
	Shevchenko is not without experience: He represented Dmitri  
Khristich and Alexander Godynyuk during the early 1990s. He lost 
certification when he didn't pay his dues. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharks president Greg Jamison is the only member of the  
organization allowed to speak about the Zyuzin situation, and he is 
pained and frustrated by it. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would very much like to have him back,'' Jamison said.  
``We'd very much like to talk to him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jamison is concerned about Zyuzin, fearing he's receiving bad  
advice that won't just impact his career, but his life. 
</P>

	SOUTH KINGSTOWN, R.I. (AP) -- Rhode Island was all ready to  
trumpet the return of Jim Harrick -- to celebrate his decision not 
to take the basketball coaching job at Georgia after all. 
</P>
<P>
	But with a last-minute phone call, Harrick disappointed Rhode  
Island for the second time in as many days. 
</P>
<P>
	University officials appeared miffed by Harrick's flip-flop.  
</P>
<P>
	Harrick said Wednesday he was taking the job at Georgia, told  
Rhode Island officials that night he had changed his mind, and 24 
hours later said he was going to Georgia after all. 
</P>
<P>
	``We consider this to be an unfortunate turn of events,'' said  
Bob Beagle, a university vice president. ``We have acted in good 
faith throughout this entire process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Beagle spoke during a news conference at which Harrick was  
supposed to announce he had decided to remain with Rhode Island. 
</P>
<P>
	Harrick didn't show up for the press conference. He also didn't  
show up for a meeting he had arranged with his team to tell them he 
was coming back. 
</P>
<P>
	``The job felt right, but about my family, I was concerned,''  
Harrick said Thursday night in an interview with WJAR television in 
Cranston, R.I. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked if he might change his mind again, he said, ``It's  
done. There is no more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Athletic director Ron Petro had a sharp response to Harrick's  
about-face. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are very concerned about his ability to make a decision,''  
Petro said during the news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Petro said he had gotten a call from Harrick at about 6 p.m.  
Wednesday saying he had changed his mind about the Georgia job. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Petro, Harrick said during that phone call he had  
decided to return to Rhode Island ``because the people in Rhode 
Island had been very good to him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Petro was glad to hear the news.  
</P>
<P>
	``We were disappointed with his decision to leave URI and  
obviously we would welcome him back,'' Beagle said. 
</P>
<P>
	At 4 p.m Thursday, Petro met Harrick and his wife at the  
Warwick, R.I. Petro said he asked Harrick and his wife if they 
remain committed to their decision to return to Rhode Island. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said `yes.' His wife was there with him and she said  
`yes,''' Petro said. 
</P>
<P>
	After failing to attend the players' meeting, Harrick talked  
with Petro by phone at about 6:10 p.m. Thursday to say he had again 
changed his mind. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said he was struggling with the decision, but that he has  
decided to go back to Georgia,'' Petro said. 
</P>
<P>
	Petro said Harrick didn't give him a clear reason for his latest  
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was hard getting it out of him,'' Petro said.  
</P>
<P>
	The first public sign of Petro's predicament emerged when the  
press conference failed to start at 7 p.m. as scheduled, and 
Harrick was nowhere to be seen. 
</P>
<P>
	Petro and Beagle shuttled anxiously between back offices in the  
university sports complex. 
</P>
<P>
	About 50 team boosters, mainly alumni, were also at the press  
conference and chatted happily about Harrick's expected return. 
</P>
<P>
	Told reporters were getting anxious, Petro pointedly replied:  
``How do you think we feel?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rumors of the bad news had already started to spread among the  
alumni before Petro and Beagle made their official statement, which 
elicited a collective gasp in the room. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, said Petro, life goes on.  
</P>
<P>
	``We'll gather ourselves tomorrow and get started again'' in the  
search for a coach, Petro said. 
</P>
<P>
	One of Harrick's former players, guard Preston Murphy, said he  
had never believed Harrick would ultimately turn down Georgia's 
offer of up to $650,000 per year, nearly double the $350,000 he was 
earning at Rhode Island. 
</P>
<P>
	``With all that type of money, it's hard to say no,'' Murphy  
said.

<HEADLINE> Body-Part Replacement Studied </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Researchers have isolated from adult bone  
marrow a master cell that can be directed to grow bone or 
cartilage, a laboratory feat that experts call a major step toward 
learning to make replacement parts for ailing or aged bodies. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers at Osiris Therapeutics in Baltimore report in  
the journal Science that they isolated a single cell, called a 
mesenchymal stem cell, and then grew it into a colony of more than 
a million cells that could be induced to produce bone, cartilage or 
fat. 
</P>
<P>
	Other experts in the rapidly expanding field of stem cell  
research applauded the achievement. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact that they can (isolate) a precursor cell like that,  
and direct it to produce specific cell types, is quite an 
advance,'' said Dr. James A. Thomson of the University of 
Wisconsin, a noted pioneer in stem cell research. ``It may be that 
such cells can eventually be used for therapy and that would be 
quite exciting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stem cells are the body's building blocks. Some, such as  
pluripotent stem cells, come only from embryos and their use in 
research is opposed by many people. 
</P>
<P>
	Other stem cells, such as the mesenchymal cells used by Osiris,  
are produced in adults. 
</P>
<P>
	But only the pluripotent stem cells from embryos are thought to  
be capable of growing into any tissue in the body. The mesenchymal 
stem cells are the parent lines for bone, cartilage, fat, tendon 
and muscle. 
</P>
<P>
	The Osiris work helps move stem cell research from the  
laboratory toward the clinic, said Dr. David J. Anderson, a Howard 
Hughes Medical Institute stem cell researcher at the California 
Institute of Technology. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you want to use stem cells to replace damaged tissue, you  
have to first know how to differentiate those cells in the lab dish 
before you put them into a patient,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In their work, Osiris researchers led by Dr. Mark F. Pittenger  
grew a single mesenchymal stem cell through more than 20 
generations to create about a million cells. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers then altered the culture medium and added  
proteins that caused the specimens to grow into cell families, or 
lineages, that would produce bone, tendon or fat, Pittenger said. 
Other work underway may lead to producing muscle cell lines. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've arrived at conditions that allow us a very strong degree  
of control,'' said Pittenger. ``When we direct these cells to the 
(cartilage) lineage, almost all of the cells grow to that 
lineage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That means it's very likely that researchers will eventually be  
able to inject specific types of cells into patients, which then 
would grow into replacement bone, tendon or muscle, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Laboratory research on animals is already underway and human  
studies may be possible in three years, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	If the technique proves successful, researchers predict that  
precursor cells for bone could be used to replace tissue lost to 
cancer, osteoporosis, injury or dental disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Research in rabbits and dogs already has shown that gaps in leg  
bone caused by surgery, such as for cancer, can be filled in with 
tissue grown in the body from stem cells. 
</P>
<P>
	Animal studies also are underway to determine if stem cells  
injected into the heart can replace scar tissue caused by heart 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
	The study using adult stem cells is important also because it  
avoids the controversy of using stem cells from embryos, Pittenger 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress has banned federal financing of research using human  
embryos, and some lawmakers oppose a National Institutes of Health 
plan to possibly pay for embryonic stem cell research. 
</P>
<P>
	But Thomson, one of the first to isolate stem cells from human  
embryos, said that although researchers have proven that some types 
of stem cells can be obtained from adults, there is still a 
scientific need for embryonic stem cell research. 
</P>
<P>
	There are no known adult stem cells for some critical organs,  
such as kidney, heart and lung, he noted. If replacements are to be 
grown for these parts, Thomson said, it would require embryonic 
stem cell research.

	CBS Buying King World for $2.5B  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- CBS Corp. is buying King World Productions Inc.,  
television's biggest program syndicator distributing shows like 
``Jeopardy'' and ``The Oprah Winfrey Show,'' for about $2.5 billion 
in stock. The deal announced today would greatly expand CBS's 
position in the business of selling programs to TV stations and 
complement its other broadcasting activities led by its ownership 
of the CBS television network. King World has been a frequent 
subject of takeover speculation but the rumors about a deal with 
CBS have intensified in recent days.

<P>
	Yahoo! Is Buying Broadcast.com  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Yahoo! Inc. is buying Broadcast.com Inc. for  
$5.7 billion in stock, adding the Internet's leading supplier of 
radio and video programs to Yahoo!'s growing array of services. The 
transaction announced today puts Yahoo! in a solid position to take 
advantage of the high-speed future of the Internet. Broadcast.com 
is perhaps best known for its Web broadcasts of John Glenn's second 
launch into space and the Victoria's Secret fashion show. But the 
company's services are expected to grow in popularity as 
connections to cyberspace get faster and easier.

	BP Confirms $26.6B Purchase of Arco  
</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- BP Amoco Corp. announced today that it has  
acquired Atlantic Richfield Co. for $26.6 billion in stock, paving 
the way for the creation of the world's second largest oil company. 
The combined company would rank second in size behind the planned 
Exxon-Mobil combination and would be the latest in consolidation to 
take place in the rapidly changing oil industry. The deal is 
subject to approval by shareholders in both companies. Browne said 
he hoped to complete the transaction by the end of the year. BP 
Amoco said 2,000 jobs are expected to be eliminated, mainly in the 
United States outside Alaska. Under the terms of the deal, BP Amoco 
will exchange .82 of its own stock for each share held by Arco 
shareholders, BP Amoco said.

	Income and Spending Growth Strong  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans' personal income increased at a  
robust pace in February and their spending even faster, sending the 
nation's savings rate into negative territory again. Personal 
income increased a seasonally adjusted 0.5 percent in February 
following a 0.6 percent gain in January, the Commerce Department 
said today. Consumer spending, meanwhile, jumped 0.7 percent after 
a 0.4 percent rise the month before. Both figures were expected by 
analysts and illustrate the strength of the U.S. economy during the 
first quarter. Economists had been expecting overseas economic 
turmoil to appreciably slow U.S. growth but now concede it didn't 
come, at least to any great extent, in the quarter just ended.

in response to several reports of the economy's continuing 
strength. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 127.10, or by 1.3 
percent, to 9,786.16. The Dow opened higher, climbing 88.80 to 
10,002.06 in the first hour of trading, but quickly fell back.

technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index fell 18.89 to 2,461.40 
after flirting with a new high early in the day. Dow component IBM, 
at one point up 2 15/16, closed down 1 5/16 at 177 1/4. In Nasdaq 
trading, Dell ended up 1 at 40 7/8, after trading as high as 42 1/4. But

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Verdict Put Off for While </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Microsoft's antitrust case is on track to  
continue through late summer or early fall, after the judge 
outlined a new courtroom schedule and promised to resume the 
marathon trial in mid-May. 
</P>
<P>
	The extended recess provides Microsoft and the government more  
time to try to negotiate a settlement, although one round of talks 
ended unsuccessfully earlier this week after only two hours. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no plans to meet again on a specific date, but  
neither side ruled out future talks. A person close to the case 
said Wednesday that further negotiations were unlikely for at least 
one week. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tuesday night's negotiations at the Justice Department,  
described as cordial, Microsoft's top legal negotiators couldn't 
reach common ground with government lawyers, another person close 
to the discussions said. Talks broke up at 7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	Both the company and the government declined to comment about  
negotiations after a hearing Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there are going to be productive settlement discussions,  
they must not take place publicly,'' said Justice lawyer David 
Boies, standing beside Microsoft's top attorney, William Neukom. 
``None of us will have any comment whatsoever about settlement 
discussions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, presiding over an  
unrelated criminal trial expected to last all April, said he will 
resume the Microsoft case May 10 or the Monday following jury 
deliberations in his current case. 
</P>
<P>
	The new schedule will likely delay any verdict until August or  
September. In the interim, Microsoft is expected to release the 
next version of its popular Office package of business software 
programs, and it has promised the next generation of its computer 
operating system, Windows 2000, by year's end. 
</P>
<P>
	Antitrust expert William Kovacic of George Washington University  
said even with delays, the trial was progressing relatively fast. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the speed of light for antitrust,'' he said. ``To lay  
people, it may seem like the movement of a glacier, but in 
antitrust this remains extraordinarily quick.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The government alleges that Microsoft illegally wields its  
influence as the manufacturer of Windows to stifle competition in 
the technology industry. Much of its focus has centered on the 
company's latest software, Windows 98. 
</P>
<P>
	After nearly five months of testimony from two-dozen witnesses,  
the trial will soon enter its rebuttal phase, when Microsoft and 
the government will each use three more witnesses to refute the 
other's characterization of its case. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial, which could have significant effects on the computer  
industry in the future, began late in October and was originally 
expected to last six to eight weeks.

<HEADLINE> CBS Buying King World for $2.5B </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- CBS Corp. is buying King World Productions Inc.,  
television's biggest program syndicator distributing shows like 
``Jeopardy'' and ``The Oprah Winfrey Show,'' for about $2.5 billion 
in stock. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal announced today would greatly expand CBS's position in  
the business of selling programs to TV stations and complement its 
other broadcasting activities led by its ownership of the CBS 
television network. 
</P>
<P>
	King World has been a frequent subject of takeover speculation,  
but the rumors about a deal with CBS have intensified in recent 
days. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have considered many strategic options over the last  
several years and this merger is by far the most attractive,'' said 
Roger King, chairman of King World. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the deal, King and his brother Michael, who is vice  
chairman of the syndication company, would continue in their 
current positions and report to the head of the CBS Television 
division, Leslie Moonves. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS's existing syndication division, Eyemark Entertainment,  
would operate independently of King World. It sells shows like 
``Martha Stewart Living'' to TV stations. 
</P>
<P>
	The CBS television network has hits like ``Sixty Minutes'' and  
``Everybody Loves Raymond.'' CBS also owns 14 television stations 
and a cable TV division with four music and sports networks and a 
controlling interest in a company that owns 160 radio stations and 
an outdoor advertising business. 
</P>
<P>
	Mel Karmazin, president and chief executive of CBS, said King  
World will over time supply programming for the CBS TV stations. 
</P>
<P>
	But that could take time as King World currently has deals to  
supply shows for non-CBS television stations. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal has been approved by the boards of both companies, and  
is subject to approval by King World shareholders and federal 
regulators. Members of the King family have pledged to vote their 
18 percent stake in the company for the deal, which is expected to 
be completed in mid-1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Under terms of the offer, CBS would pay 0.81 shares of CBS stock  
for each share of King World stock. At Wednesday's closing price, 
that would represent an 8.2 percent premium for King World 
shareholders. But it would be a 14.2 percent premium over King 
World's stock price a week ago before the latest takeover 
speculation heated up. 
</P>
<P>
	In late morning trading today, King World shares rose 25 cents,  
or 0.8 percent, to $30.81 1/4 on the New York Stock Exchange. CBS 
shares fell $1.37 1/2 or 3.4 percent to $39.43 3/4, also on the NYSE.

<HEADLINE> Japan Vehicle Sales Drop 11.2 Pct. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Sales of new cars, trucks and buses in Japan, hurt  
by sagging consumer confidence, plummeted 11.2 percent in fiscal 
1998 for the second straight yearly decline, an industry 
association said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	A total of 4.21 million new vehicles were sold in fiscal 1998,  
which ended Wednesday, down from 4.75 million vehicles the previous 
year, the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association said. 
</P>
<P>
	Vehicle sales dropped 14.6 percent in fiscal 1997.  
</P>
<P>
	The association also announced that auto sales tumbled 10.1  
percent in March from the year-earlier month, to 592,636 units, for 
the 24th consecutive monthly decline. 
</P>
<P>
	Truck sales in fiscal 1998 were the biggest victim of the auto  
slump, with new purchases plummeting 17.6 percent to 153,321 units. 
Passenger car sales fell 7.2 percent to 436,024, while bus sales 
dropped 2.7 percent to 3,291. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales were down at all of Japan's top automakers last year.  
Toyota Motor Corp.'s sales fell 9.1 percent to 1,678,668. Sales at 
struggling Nissan Motor Corp., which recently announced a capital 
tie-up with France's Renault SA, dropped 10.6 percent to 860,458. 
</P>
<P>
	Honda Motor Co. sales plunged 13.2 percent to 447,993 units,  
Mazda Motor Corp. sales fell 2.7 percent to 273,233, and Mitsubishi 
Motor Corp. sales dropped 13.6 percent to 338,817. 
</P>
<P>
	Import vehicle sales in fiscal 1998 fell 14.3 percent to  
275,546. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales figures are based on vehicle registrations, which indicate  
retail sales by dealers. Figures don't include sales of mini-cars 
and mini-trucks.

<HEADLINE> Harrick Shenanigans Miff R.I. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SOUTH KINGSTOWN, R.I. (AP) -- Rhode Island was all ready to  
trumpet the return of Jim Harrick -- to celebrate his decision not 
to take the basketball coaching job at Georgia after all. 
</P>
<P>
	But with a last-minute phone call, Harrick disappointed Rhode  
Island for the second time in as many days. 
</P>
<P>
	University officials appeared miffed by Harrick's flip-flop.  
</P>
<P>
	Harrick said Wednesday he was taking the job at Georgia, told  
Rhode Island officials that night he had changed his mind, and 24 
hours later said he was going to Georgia after all. 
</P>
<P>
	``We consider this to be an unfortunate turn of events,'' said  
Bob Beagle, a university vice president. ``We have acted in good 
faith throughout this entire process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Beagle spoke during a news conference at which Harrick was  
supposed to announce he had decided to remain with Rhode Island. 
</P>
<P>
	Harrick didn't show up for the press conference. He also didn't  
show up for a meeting he had arranged with his team to tell them he 
was coming back. 
</P>
<P>
	``The job felt right, but about my family, I was concerned,''  
Harrick said Thursday night in an interview with WJAR television in 
Cranston, R.I. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked if he might change his mind again, he said, ``It's  
done. There is no more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Athletic director Ron Petro had a sharp response to Harrick's  
about-face. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are very concerned about his ability to make a decision,''  
Petro said during the news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Petro said he had gotten a call from Harrick at about 6 p.m.  
Wednesday saying he had changed his mind about the Georgia job. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Petro, Harrick said during that phone call he had  
decided to return to Rhode Island ``because the people in Rhode 
Island had been very good to him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Petro was glad to hear the news.  
</P>
<P>
	``We were disappointed with his decision to leave URI and  
obviously we would welcome him back,'' Beagle said. 
</P>
<P>
	At 4 p.m Thursday, Petro met Harrick and his wife at the  
Warwick, R.I. Petro said he asked Harrick and his wife if they 
remain committed to their decision to return to Rhode Island. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said `yes.' His wife was there with him and she said  
`yes,''' Petro said. 
</P>
<P>
	After failing to attend the players' meeting, Harrick talked  
with Petro by phone at about 6:10 p.m. Thursday to say he had again 
changed his mind. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said he was struggling with the decision, but that he has  
decided to go back to Georgia,'' Petro said. 
</P>
<P>
	Petro said Harrick didn't give him a clear reason for his latest  
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was hard getting it out of him,'' Petro said.  
</P>
<P>
	The first public sign of Petro's predicament emerged when the  
press conference failed to start at 7 p.m. as scheduled, and 
Harrick was nowhere to be seen. 
</P>
<P>
	Petro and Beagle shuttled anxiously between back offices in the  
university sports complex. 
</P>
<P>
	About 50 team boosters, mainly alumni, were also at the press  
conference and chatted happily about Harrick's expected return. 
</P>
<P>
	Told reporters were getting anxious, Petro pointedly replied:  
``How do you think we feel?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rumors of the bad news had already started to spread among the  
alumni before Petro and Beagle made their official statement, which 
elicited a collective gasp in the room. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, said Petro, life goes on.  
</P>
<P>
	``We'll gather ourselves tomorrow and get started again'' in the  
search for a coach, Petro said. 
</P>
<P>
	One of Harrick's former players, guard Preston Murphy, said he  
had never believed Harrick would ultimately turn down Georgia's 
offer of up to $650,000 per year, nearly double the $350,000 he was 
earning at Rhode Island. 
</P>
<P>
	``With all that type of money, it's hard to say no,'' Murphy  
said.

<HEADLINE> Lyme Disease Vaccine Now Available </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- It's finally spring -- have you had your Lyme  
disease shot yet? 
</P>
<P>
	This spring marks the first time that Americans can enter tick  
season armed with a vaccine against Lyme disease, and doctors in 
New England, Minnesota and other Lyme-plagued areas are starting to 
bug outdoors-loving patients to get the shots. 
</P>
<P>
	Why the urgency? Because it takes a series of three shots to  
build up to full immunity. So, ``the time to start getting it is 
right now,'' advises Phillip Baker, Lyme disease chief at the 
National Institutes of Health. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyme disease is a serious illness caused by pin-sized ticks that  
live in wooded and grassy areas nationwide, but especially in the 
Northeast, from Maryland up to Maine, and in Wisconsin and 
Minnesota. About 16,000 new cases are reported each year, a number 
that scientists like Baker expect the new vaccine LYMErix will help 
drop in just a few years. 
</P>
<P>
	Typically, the illness -- named for Lyme, Conn., where it was  
discovered in 1975 -- starts with a telltale bull's-eye rash. Then 
comes fatigue, chills, fevers and joint pain that can persist for 
weeks. Some people develop serious arthritis. If untreated, Lyme 
disease also can severely damage the heart and nervous system. 
</P>
<P>
	Antibiotics can cure Lyme. But the earlier treatment starts, the  
better -- yet there's no good test to diagnose Lyme, and not 
everyone suffers early Lyme symptoms and thus knows to seek care. 
</P>
<P>
	So until now, doctors' best advice was: Use insecticide  
containing the chemical DEET. Check yourself and your children 
regularly for ticks. Wear long sleeves and pants tucked into socks 
or boots when venturing into tick-prone areas like unmowed grass or 
brush. 
</P>
<P>
	But that last bit of advice is unrealistic. Ticks are most  
active in the summer when people are stripping down to shorts and 
bare feet. And it's not just campers, hikers or utility workers 
stomping through the brush who are at risk. Many people in 
Lyme-plagued areas are exposed in their own well-manicured back 
yards, just sitting in the grass or weeding the garden. 
</P>
<P>
	In December, the Food and Drug Administration approved the  
world's first Lyme vaccine, SmithKline Beecham's LYMErix. Now 
doctors are advising anyone age 15 to 70 who lives in Lyme-endemic 
states and spends time outdoors to consider being vaccinated. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not for everyone. SmithKline hasn't yet finished testing  
how safe LYMErix is for children and how well it protects them; 
study results are expected later this year. It hasn't been tested 
in the very elderly, pregnant women or people with such chronic 
diseases as rheumatoid arthritis. 
</P>
<P>
	Nor is the vaccine a panacea: It requires two shots given about  
a month apart, and then a third shot a year later. After the 
three-shot series, LYMErix offers about 80 percent protection from 
Lyme disease. But after just the first two shots, the vaccine is 
only about 50 percent protective. 
</P>
<P>
	So even the vaccinated will still have to check for ticks and  
use insect repellent -- especially this year, before they get that 
final third shot. 
</P>
<P>
	Plus, ticks carry other diseases that this vaccine can't  
prevent. 
</P>
<P>
	Don't panic if you get bitten by a tick without being  
vaccinated. All ticks don't carry Lyme, and they have to feed on 
you for about 48 hours before they can transmit the disease, NIH's 
Baker said. It takes that long for the Lyme bacteria hibernating in 
a tick's gut to activate and move into the salivary glands, where 
it's injected into a person. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you do regular tick checks each day and remove them,  
chances are you won't be infected,'' he said. ``The bite itself is 
not enough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The vaccine, however, blocks Lyme by creating antibodies that  
recognize an outer protein of the bacteria in the tick's saliva, 
neutralizing it at skin level. 
</P>
<P>
	SmithKline began shipping LYMErix to doctors' offices in January  
and is trying to spread the word, running ads in the nation's most 
Lyme-ridden states. About 12,000 people who have seen those ads 
have called a hot line seeking more information, but SmithKline 
won't say how many doses of LYMErix have sold so far. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors buy each shot for $49, but patients may pay up to $60  
when the office visit is added. 
</P>

<HEADLINE>  Canadians Celebrate New Territory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IQALUIT, Nunavut (AP) -- A new flag rose Thursday in the Arctic  
as Nunavut, the self-governing territory of Canada's Inuit people, 
celebrated its birth with fireworks, festivals and vows to surmount 
the daunting challenges ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	The historic day culminated more than 20 years of often arduous  
negotiations between federal authorities and the Inuit, who make up 
85 percent of Nunavut's 25,000 people. The final result is Canada's 
biggest-ever aboriginal land claims settlement and the first major 
change in its map in 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have demonstrated to the world what we can accomplish,''  
said Paul Okalik, the 34-year-old lawyer elected by his fellow 
legislators as Nunavut's first premier. 
</P>
<P>
	``We achieved this through peaceful negotiations, without civil  
disobedience, without litigation,'' he told political leaders and 
Inuit elders at a 90-minute ceremony. ``We the people of Nunavut 
have regained the control of our destiny and will once again 
determine our own path.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Okalik, a veteran of the land-claims negotiations but a newcomer  
to politics, will govern a territory as big as Western Europe, 
carved out of the eastern 60 percent of the Northwest Territories. 
Its Inuit majority is admired for perseverance and generosity, yet 
plagued by serious social problems and heavily reliant on federal 
funding. 
</P>
<P>
	With Okalik, Prime Minister Jean Chretien and other dignitaries  
looking on, young military cadets unfurled the new territorial 
flag. It depicts the North Star in one corner and an inuksuk 
(eee-nook-shook) -- an Inuit guidepost made of stones -- in the 
middle. 
</P>
<P>
	``Through the centuries, they have guided you across the snow to  
your homes,'' said Canada's governor-general, Romeo LeBlanc. `You 
are the closest people to the North Star. And your courage and your 
values are a light and a lesson to others.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chretien noted that he encouraged moves toward Inuit  
self-determination three decades ago when he was Indian Affairs 
minister. He took that post not long after the federal government 
alienated many Inuit by forcing them to resettle in designated 
villages and pressuring their children to attend church-run 
boarding schools which often suppressed Inuit culture. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fifty years from now, school children will be reading about  
this day in their text books... when we, together, redrew the map 
of Canada,'' Chretien said. ``Canada is showing the world, once 
again, how we joyfully embrace our many peoples and cultures.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The nationally televised ceremony was opened by three elders who  
blessed the new territory and punctuated with entertainment by 
Inuit performers. An eight-member troupe danced and chanted to the 
beat of hand-held drums, and five women demonstrated the ancient 
art of throat singing, which produces haunting sounds through 
special breathing techniques. 
</P>
<P>
	Later events included a fiddle-and-accordion festival, a rock  
concert by Inuit heavy-metal band Angava, and a community feast 
featuring caribou brochette, raw fish and musk ox. 
</P>
<P>
	Nunavut's official birth came at midnight, and a few minutes  
later fireworks lit the sky over the new capital of Iqaluit 
(eee-kah-loo-eet). The flares illuminated the ice covering 
Frobisher Bay and startled dozens of local sled dogs into a chorus 
of frenzied barks. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like New Year's Eve,'' said Hannah Nutarak after watching  
the fireworks with her two sons. 
</P>
<P>
	Daniel, 4, ``was a little scared,'' she said, but Joey, 9, was  
proud about Nunavut's birth. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be different now, and better,'' Mrs. Nutarak said.  
``There will be more jobs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nunavut means ``our land'' in Inuktitut, the Inuit language  
which will be one of the territory's three official languages along 
with English and French. Fifteen of the 19 new legislators, who 
were sworn in Thursday morning, are Inuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Separate ceremonies were held to swear in Nunavut's three judges  
and establish a Nunavut division of the Royal Canadian Mounted 
Police. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mounties, responsible for law enforcement throughout  
Nunavut, have a checkered history in the region and have 
acknowledged that some of their past actions were insensitive to 
Inuit values. 
</P>
<P>
	``The RCMP is learning about the importance of respecting  
different cultures, about the power of spirituality and of the need 
to listen,'' said the Mounties' chief commissioner, Phil Murray.

<P>
	VALYERMO, Calif. (AP) -- The day begins early in this holy place  
on the high desert. 
</P>
<P>
	It's still dark when the black-robed monks of St. Andrew's Abbey  
gather in the chapel for vigils. They will gather four more times 
before the day ends in the Grand Silence -- when they will not speak 
again, save prayer, until after breakfast the following morning. 
</P>
<P>
	These are men who have decided to shun wives and kids, homes in  
the suburbs, good jobs and fast cars in search of a purely 
spiritual existence. Instead of fame and fortune, the monks have 
chosen to follow the way that St. Benedict established centuries 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The men of St. Andrew's are not alone. Though statistics show  
seminary enrollments in the United States have declined in recent 
decades -- from 37,383 in 1967 to 5,527 in 1997 -- priests of various 
religious orders say they have noticed a renewed and conservative 
religious interest among young people. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole point of monastic life, of living in one place and  
having the kind of schedule that we have, is to be focused on what 
we focus on -- which is God,'' said Brother Andrew Hayes. 
</P>
<P>
	At 27, he is among the youngest at St. Andrew's Abbey, where  
monks live their lives secluded on the rocky edge of the Mojave 
Desert north of Los Angeles. On a hill overlooking the ranch-style 
buildings of the abbey is the cemetery where they eventually will 
be laid to rest. 
</P>
<P>
	The reasons the men join are as different as the men themselves.  
</P>
<P>
	Lui Toilolo decided his career path in the fifth grade. Toilolo,  
36, hopes eventually to become a priest. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I look at the monks, I see a person striving for  
holiness,'' he said. ``That's what I want and I think that's why 
I'm here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For others, the road to this vocation was not a long one, with  
years of hands-clasped, eyes-to-heaven piety. 
</P>
<P>
	Brother Boniface Butterworth, 26, worked as a computer  
programmer for the Kansas Turnpike when he left to join St. 
Benedict's Abbey in Atchison, Kan. He said he didn't consider 
himself religious growing up and it wasn't until he began working 
that he realized his life was unfulfilling. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought if God exists then there's another purpose for  
life,'' he said. ``Seeking God and living a good life seems to make 
a lot of sense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But to some men, the mere idea of a lifetime without bills and  
9-to-5 workdays is enough to send them knocking on monastery doors. 
Vocation directors, like the Rev. Simon O'Donnell at St. Andrew's, 
turn them away. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Donnell said some don't realize that the monastery doesn't  
have to take everyone who seeks to join. He compares living in a 
cloister to a marriage -- it's a big commitment to spend a lifetime 
with someone. 
</P>
<P>
	``There probably isn't a lot of satisfaction in following a  
strict lifestyle that really doesn't do something inside of you, 
that doesn't enhance your spiritual relationship with God,'' 
O'Donnell said. 
</P>
<P>
	How do the monks describe their ``calling'' to the monastic  
life? Toilolo characterizes it as ``a calm, deep sigh.'' Others 
describe it as an ``inner peace'' or a ``tug of the heart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Meinrad Miller, director of vocations at St. Benedict's  
Abbey, attributes the initial spark in religious curiosity to Pope 
John Paul II's visit at World Youth Day in Denver in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	``Literally hundreds of thousands of young people around the  
world gathered, joyful about their faith,'' he said. ``A lot of 
them began to think at that time of serving the priesthood or 
religious life. It was a watershed event.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miller, 34, said he knows 40 men and women at Benedictine  
College in Atchison who seem serious about taking monastic vows. 
That's out of 800 students. 
</P>
<P>
	Interest is much greater than when he was in college in the  
early 1980s, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Many young people reject progressive religious ideals born of  
Vatican II's reforms, favoring instead a traditional life of 
prayer, Toilolo said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems to me younger people are wanting none of this  
wishy-washy stuff,'' he added. Having grown up in times that seemed 
morally ambivalent, in which ``everything goes,'' he said, they 
seem more conservative. ``I think people are sick and tired of this 
because they think, 'This can't be right.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Some priests, however, are skeptical about the rise in interest.  
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Joe Morris, a chaplain at St. John's University School  
of Law in Queens, N.Y., used to teach seminarians. 
</P>
<P>
	When his generation entered the priesthood in the 1960s and  
1970s it was to answer a call to service, he said. They were 
destined to help others and to spread the word of God. 
</P>
<P>
	Morris said many of today's young men and women who are joining  
religious orders come from broken homes and dysfunctional families. 
Often they say they are seeking a sense of community. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right before this people were really complaining'' about a  
lack of applicants, he said. ``It's really kind of a surprise. 
People are changing tunes and saying, 'At least we have bodies.' A 
lot of times there's really a tendency among people to talk about 
numbers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Morris said he worries how committed some of today's young  
people are to the religious life. Miller countered that such 
concerns, voiced mainly by older priests, represent ``a healthy 
tension.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His own view? ``The young seminarians will make fine priests.''

<HEADLINE> Fed Panel Reports on Y2K Readiness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Nearly a dozen federal agencies failed to meet  
President Clinton's deadline for protecting their most critical 
computer systems against potential problems when the Year 2000 
arrives. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Clinton administration officials emphasized that 92  
percent of the government's 6,123 crucial computer systems are 
``Y2K compliant'' and should work properly come January. 
</P>
<P>
	``These systems have gone through the full stages of not only  
analysis and assessment, but remediation, testing and 
implementation,'' said John Koskinen, chairman of the President's 
Council on Year 2000 Conversion. ``Implementation includes 
installing the upgraded or replaced systems wherever they're in 
operation, not only domestically but around the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement came Wednesday, the deadline Clinton imposed  
more than a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, immediately  
criticized the White House's characterization of the report. 
</P>
<P>
	``The administration is redefining success by patting themselves  
on the back for being 92 percent Y2K compliant. The reality is, the 
administration has failed to meet its own deadline,'' Armey said in 
a statement. ``The administration is fooling itself and luring the 
American public into a false sense of security.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Koskinen said 13 of the 24 departments now report that their  
most essential computer systems are 100 percent ready for business 
on Jan. 1. Ten agencies have repaired and tested at least 85 
percent of their systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Only the U.S. Agency for International Development has not fixed  
any of its critical systems, mainly because it started late and ran 
into more problems than expected, Koskinen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ironically, the White House reported that only one-fourth of its  
systems were compliant. It expects to repair all of its systems by 
the end of October. 
</P>
<P>
	Koskinen said his panel's findings were ``validated in a lot of  
different ways,'' including reviews by each agency's inspector 
general and the General Accounting Office, the investigative branch 
of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Roughly 500 critical computer systems need work before they are  
considered Y2K compliant. However, Koskinen expressed confidence 
that all agencies -- including USAID -- would finish their work by 
the end of the summer. 
</P>
<P>
	The so-called ``Y2K'' problem occurs because many computers are  
programmed to recognize only the last two digits of a year and, 
without repairs, may malfunction beginning Jan. 1 when they might 
assume it is 1900. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Steve Horn, R-Calif., chairman of the House Government  
Reform Committee's government management subcommittee, was 
encouraged by the 92 percent compliant rate but said ``we should 
have had it sooner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Now we've got to do the real serious work, which is test it in  
an operational environment. If we can test it and it still works, 
that's fine. But time's a wasting,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ed DeSeve, deputy management director for the administration's  
Office of Management and Budget, said the government will continue 
``end-to-end'' testing of its systems to make sure they work 
internally, as well as with those from state and local agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said OMB would seek contingency plans from departments  
by June 30.

<HEADLINE> Gas Prices Jump Nearly 12 Cents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The American Automobile Association says  
gasoline prices jumped by nearly 12 cents per gallon in the past 
two weeks, the steepest increase since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	The national average price of self-serve regular unleaded  
gasoline increased 11.8 cents since March 16 to reach $1.088 per 
gallon, the AAA said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	This marks the largest increase since August 1990, after Iraq  
invaded Kuwait, when gas prices increased 23.2 cents, the 
association said. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices for other types of gasoline had smaller increases:  
self-serve mid-grade unleaded gas is up 11.4 cents to $1.178, and 
self-serve premium is up 11.1 cents to $1.235. 
</P>
<P>
	Across the country, prices at the pump have soared, in part  
because world oil producers agreed to take an additional 2.1 
million barrels daily off the market, and because of anticipated 
increases in demand for spring and summer driving. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts have also pointed to refinery production troubles in  
California, one of the largest U.S. driving markets. Gas is most 
expensive in the West, increasing nearly 14 cents in the past two 
weeks to bring self-serve regular unleaded gas to $1.243 a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
	Gas is least expensive in the Southeast at $1.003, an increase  
of 10.6 cents. 
</P>
<P>
	A separate survey found that gasoline prices had increased about  
8.5 cents a gallon in the two weeks leading up to March 19. The 
Lundberg Survey of 10,000 gas stations nationwide found the 
weighted average, including all grades and taxes, had increased to 
$1.0869 cents per gallon in that time period. 
</P>
<P>
	Other regional prices for self-serve unleaded:  
</P>
<P>
	--New England: up 7.2 cents to $1.054.  
</P>
<P>
	--Mid-Atlantic: up 8.8 cents to $1.032.  
</P>
<P>
	--Great Lakes: up 17 cents to $1.123.  
</P>
<P>
	--Midwest: up 11.9 cents to $1.042.  
</P>
<P>
	--Southwest: up 14.5 cents to $1.087.  
</P>
<P>
	The association's Fuel Gauge report is based on data from more  
than 37,000 transaction on March 30.

<HEADLINE> Income and Spending Growth Strong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans' personal income increased at a  
robust pace in February and their spending even faster, sending the 
nation's savings rate into negative territory again. 
</P>
<P>
	Personal income increased a seasonally adjusted 0.5 percent in  
February following a 0.6 percent gain in January, the Commerce 
Department said today. Consumer spending, meanwhile, jumped 0.7 
percent after a 0.4 percent rise the month before. 
</P>
<P>
	Both figures were expected by analysts and illustrate the  
strength of the U.S. economy during the first quarter. Economists 
had been expecting overseas economic turmoil to appreciably slow 
U.S. growth but now concede it didn't come, at least to any great 
extent, in the quarter just ended. 
</P>
<P>
	``The consumer is still on a tear. The pace is far beyond any  
reasonable estimate of a sustainable trend,'' said economist David 
Orr of First Union Corp. in Charlotte, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	In another sign of economic vigor, the department reported  
separately that construction spending jumped a 
much-stronger-than-expected 2.2 percent in February, the largest 
increase in eight months and the fourth in a row. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the National Association of Purchasing Management, in New  
York, said manufacturing grew for the second consecutive month in 
March. Production and new orders are gaining momentum, it concluded 
from a survey of corporate purchasing executives. 
</P>
<P>
	By midmorning, an early attempt at a stock rally had fizzled and  
the Dow Jones industrial average was off abut 15 points. Interest 
rates rose in the bond market, largely in response to the strong 
manufacturing report. 
</P>
<P>
	Income growth has been supported by rising wages, up 0.7 percent  
in February. Demand for labor is strong, with the nation's 
unemployment rate hovering near a 29-year low. 
</P>
<P>
	Reflecting that, the Labor Department said today that first-time  
claims for unemployment benefits held under 300,000 last week for 
the ninth consecutive week, a stretch unprecedented since 1973. 
</P>
<P>
	Claims fell by 6,000 to 289,000. A four-week moving average of  
claims, which smoothes weekly fluctuations, rose slightly, by 250, 
to 293,750. 
</P>
<P>
	Americans' spending, however, has been supported by more than  
job income. They're spending some of their stock market gains -- the 
Dow average closed above 10,000 for the first time on Monday before 
retreating Tuesday and Wednesday -- and tapping into their home 
equity through refinancing. 
</P>
<P>
	That's produced the lowest personal savings rate -- savings as a  
percentage of after-tax income -- since the 1930s. It was minus 0.2 
percent in February, the fifth month in six at or below zero. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to wages, other income categories increasing were  
business owners' income, transfer payments such as Social Security, 
interest and dividends and rental income. Farmers' income, however, 
fell. 
</P>
<P>
	Spending was led by a 2.9 percent jump in purchases of durable  
goods, big-ticket items expected to last three or more years. Much 
of that was for autos. Spending rose 0.6 percent for nondurable 
goods such as food and fuel and 0.3 percent for services. 
</P>
<P>
	Construction spending in February was led by a 4.7 percent surge  
in government projects, reflecting a 10.4 percent increase for 
highways and streets. 
</P>
<P>
	Commercial construction increased 3.9 percent, with gains in  
industrial projects, office buildings and retail stores. 
</P>
<P>
	Residential construction rose 0.8 percent, including a 1.5  
percent advance for single-family homes.

<HEADLINE> Computers Shut Off in Y2K Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) -- Lt. Rusty Brown, an emergency  
dispatcher, welcomed the opportunity to think for himself today, 
when his county shut off its computers in a drill to check on Y2K 
readiness. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown took 911 calls and assigned police, fire and ambulance  
crews by filling in the blanks on small paper cards. 
</P>
<P>
	``The computer tells you what to send and where to send it. But  
on cards you have to think for yourself. You have to be familiar 
with which car responds to what area, for example,'' said Brown, a 
supervisor at Kanawha County's communications center. 
</P>
<P>
	The daylong test gave officials confidence there won't be too  
many problems come Jan. 1, 2000, when the so-called ``Y2K'' problem 
may cause computers to malfunction because they might assume it is 
1900 rather than 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Things didn't go smoothly, though.  
</P>
<P>
	In the tax collector's office, Fonda Whitt flipped through  
printouts up to 10 inches thick to check on records for people 
lined up to pay. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're so used to having customers in and out in a timely  
manner that I felt like I was holding them up,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents of Clendenin, a town of about 2,000 about 20 miles  
north of Charleston, flooded their city hall with calls of panic 
that their power would be shut off as part of the drill, county 
Manager Stephen Zoeller said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know where they got this from,'' he said. ``We had a  
drill and this town up there -- they lost it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Bill White, director of the county's emergency services,  
said the drill reaffirmed his belief that his agency ``doesn't 
really depend on computers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of the people here have many years of experience and  
could do their job without using a computer or opening a book,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly all of the county's computers have been replaced or  
upgraded to avoid the ``Y2K'' problem. The county still decided to 
go ahead with the drill as a precaution. 
</P>
<P>
	White used a laptop computer and electricity-run projector to  
review the county's emergency response plan with other agency 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said it wasn't cheating: ``We're on backup power and this  
laptop is Y2K compliant.''

<HEADLINE> Definition of 'Blue Moon' Corrected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- A 53-year-old error over the term ``blue moon''  
has journalists red in the face. 
</P>
<P>
	Sky &AMP; Telescope magazine has admitted it made an error in an  
article which said ``blue moon'' referred to the second full moon 
within the same month. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hate to admit it,'' said Roger Sinnott, associate editor of  
Sky &AMP; Telescope, who blamed the goof on an amateur astronomer, 
James Hugh Pruett. 
</P>
<P>
	Pruett wrote a 1946 piece for the magazine after apparently  
misinterpreting a complex 1937 article in the Maine Farmer's 
Almanac which said that when a season contains four full moons, the 
third is called a blue moon. 
</P>
<P>
	Pruett, according to the magazine, mistakenly thought that the  
almanac meant that a blue moon was the second full moon within the 
same month. 
</P>
<P>
	The mistake went unnoticed for decades. A 1980 National Public  
Radio story about blue moons used the wrong definition and the 
board game Trivial Pursuit repeated the error in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	Sky &AMP; Telescope, based in Cambridge, discovered the error when  
it was working on an article about how January and March of this 
year featured what would have been two blue moons. 
</P>
<P>
	But by the revised definition, Wednesday's much-discussed moon  
was blue-less. For the record, the next by-the-book blue moon will 
be on Feb. 19, 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Sky &AMP; Telescope's editors think the mistake by Pruett,  
of Eugene, Ore., led to the modern mis-definition of ``blue moon,'' 
it's unclear where the Maine Farmer's Almanac came up with the 
rule. 
</P>
<P>
	The almanac, put out by Augusta, Maine-based printer Charles E.  
Nash &AMP; Son, continued publication at least through the mid-1950s 
but is now defunct, said Peter Geiger, editor of the unrelated 
Farmers' Almanac in Lewiston, Maine. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Pruett, who died in 1955, never lived to see his mistake  
corrected, the amateur astronomer's definition may endure 
nevertheless. 
</P>
<P>
	``This meaning is so entrenched now. Nothing we can do is going  
to put the genie back in the bottle,'' Sinnott said. ``Our big 
mistake in 1946 has really caught on and there's no turning back.''

<HEADLINE> Owners of WD-40 Acquire Lava Soap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- A household product that can make hands greasy  
is teaming up with another than can make them clean. 
</P>
<P>
	The San Diego-based WD-40 Co. is acquiring Lava industrial  
cleaner from Block Drug Co. of Jersey City, N.J.. Terms were not 
disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	Garry Ridge, president and chief executive of the WD-40  
lubricant company, said the firm plans to revitalize the Lava brand 
and begin distributing it in Europe, Asia and Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lava has a brand awareness in America of 85 percent, although  
it's in only 16 percent of households right now,'' Ridge said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Block Drug Co., which markets the dental adhesive Polident,  
acquired Lava from Procter &AMP; Gamble, which originally developed the 
heavy-duty hand cleanser. 
</P>
<P>
	Industry analysts said WD-40's purchase of Lava may not be  
enough to improve the company's stodgy image as a caretaker of 
mature brands. 
</P>
<P>
	``WD-40 is a cash cow that should be using that (capital) to  
develop new brands for emerging markets,'' said Michael Shonstrom 
of brokerage Neidiger Tucker Bruner. ``I kind of would like to see 
(WD-40) do something unique and new, rather than old.''

<HEADLINE> Yahoo! To Acquire Broadcast.com </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Yahoo! Inc. is expected to announce today it  
will acquire Broadcast.com Inc. for $5.6 billion in stock, adding 
the Internet's leading supplier of radio and video programs to 
Yahoo!'s growing array of services. 
</P>
<P>
	According to a source familiar with the deal, Yahoo! will pay  
$130 a share for Broadcast.com's stock, a 10 percent premium over 
Wednesday's closing price of $118.18 3/4 on the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
Shares of Broadcast.com had run up in recent days on reports the 
two companies were talking about a deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Broadcast.com investors will receive .77 of a Yahoo share for  
each Broadcast.com share. 
</P>
<P>
	Broadcast.com is perhaps best known for its Web broadcasts of  
John Glenn's second launch into space and the Victoria's Secret 
fashion show. But the company's services are expected to grow in 
popularity as connections to cyberspace get faster and easier. 
</P>
<P>
	The acquisition ``really positions Yahoo! to play a defining  
role as we see the rise of audio and video content on the Web,'' 
said Paul Noglows, a San Francisco-based analyst with Hambrecht &AMP; 
Quist. 
</P>
<P>
	``From Broadcast.com's perspective, it will make their services  
available to a much broader range of users, considering Yahoo! 
attracts 50 million unique users to its site a month.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Founded in 1994 by Stanford University doctoral candidates David  
Filo and Jerry Yang, Yahoo! is one of the premier destinations on 
the Internet. The company's turbocharged stock, which has risen 264 
percent in the past 12 months, has turned into a currency to snap 
up rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	But Broadcast.com wasn't cheap. The Dallas-based firm, which  
went public in July, has seen its shares rise 1,213 percent in just 
eight months. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman for Yahoo! declined comment. Repeated calls to  
Broadcast.com were not returned. 
</P>
<P>
	This is Yahoo!'s second major deal this year. The Santa Clara,  
Calif.-based company announced the $4.58 billion acquisition of 
GeoCities Inc. in January. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Asian Stock Markets Rally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Led by a 3.1 percent surge in Tokyo's main  
index, most Asian stock markets shrugged off the overnight fall on 
Wall Street and rallied Thursday on a string of positive local 
news. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan started its fiscal year with a bang, as stock prices got a  
big boost from active buying by domestic and foreign investors. 
</P>
<P>
	The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 490.97 points to close  
at 16,327.56. On Wednesday, the average had lost 22.53 points, or 
0.14 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Buying was encouraged by the belief that a flood of new Japanese  
pension fund money would enter the market in April and by recent 
indications that Japanese companies are serious about 
restructuring, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	On the foreign exchange market, the U.S. dollar fell against the  
Japanese yen on selling by overseas funds amid growing bearish 
sentiment for the U.S. currency. 
</P>
<P>
	In late trading, the dollar bought 118.52 yen in late trading,  
down 1.46 yen from late Wednesday in Tokyo and also below its late 
New York level of 118.97 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	In South Korea, shares rallied on hopes that local interest  
rates would fall further. The key Kospi index surged 17.91 points, 
or 2.9 percent, to 636.89, with financial shares leading the gains. 
</P>
<P>
	Chon Chol-hwan, the central bank governor, said early Thursday  
that the bank will keep interest rates low in its effort to support 
the nation's burgeoning economic recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	In Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, shares also soared, with the  
blue-chip Composite Index rising 24.74 points, or 4.9 percent, to 
527.56. 
</P>
<P>
	Market confidence grew after the international rating agency  
Standard and Poor's upgraded credit ratings of the country and 
several key blue-chip companies to stable from negative. 
</P>
<P>
	Comments by Ali Abul Sulaiman, the central bank governor, that  
Malaysia this year could achieve a 2 percent growth, compared with 
the 1 percent forecast, further lifted sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
	In Hong Kong, share prices rose on a slew of positive news in  
the real estate market that lifted property and banking shares. 
</P>
<P>
	The blue-chip Hang Seng Index gained 130.78 points, or 1.2  
percent, to 11,072.98. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading was quiet ahead of a five-day market break. Financial  
markets are closed for Friday, Monday and Tuesday for Easter and 
then the Chinese Ching Ming Festival, and reopen Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial markets in the Philippines were closed Thursday and  
Friday for Easter. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>
	SINGAPORE: Shares rallied, with the Straits Times Index closing  
up 26.88 points, or 1.8 percent, higher at 1,545.19. 
</P>
<P>
	BANGKOK: Thai shares rose, led by banking stocks which were  
boosted by the Finance Ministry's approval of cutting the amount of 
cash banks must maintain in non-interest-bearing central bank 
accounts. The SET index rose 4.84 points, or 1.4 percent, to 
356.85. 
</P>
<P>
	JAKARTA: Buying in mining, pharmaceutical and tobacco stocks  
lifted Indonesian shares. The JSX Composite Index rose 0.808 point, 
or 0.2 percent, to 394.433. 
</P>
<P>
	SYDNEY: Australian shares finished mixed, shrugging off the fall  
on Wall Street. The All Ordinaries index edged up just 6.2 points, 
or 0.2 percent, to 2.973.4. 
</P>
<P>
	TAIPEI: Tokyo's rally and buying in stocks in textile, plastics  
and petrochemical companies lifted Taiwan's key index above the key 
7,000-point mark. The Weighted Price Index closed at 7,018.68 
points, up 136.96 points, or 2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	WELLINGTON: New Zealand shares were lifted by a rise in market  
heavyweight Telecom Corp. of New Zealand Ltd. The NZSE-40 capital 
index rose 4.58 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,147.76.

<HEADLINE> 'Fame' Actress Sues Husband </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Actress Lori Singer is suing her estranged  
husband, accusing him of stealing millions from her. 
</P>
<P>
	The star of the 1980s television series ``Fame'' and the 1984  
movie ``Footloose'' claims that Richard Emery and their accountant 
took the money from Kuba Productions Inc., the company they created 
to manage her finances. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Singer, 41, filed for divorce from Emery in 1996 after 16  
years of marriage. In papers filed Monday in state court, Ms. 
Singer said she doesn't know the exact amount allegedly stolen but 
the ``figure clearly and easily exceeds several million dollars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Emery, an attorney, denied that he stole any of his wife's  
money. He called her lawsuit ``a pathetic and perverse attempt to 
hold onto a marriage that she can't let go of.''

	Captured U.S. Soldiers To Be Tried  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Three U.S. soldiers who were  
captured and shown on Yugoslav TV with abrasions on their faces 
will be put on trial before a military court tomorrow, the state 
news agency said. In Washington, the United States reacted with 
outrage. Any trial ``would be in violation of international law,'' 
State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said today. The Yugoslav 
army said the Americans were caught yesterday in southern 
Yugoslavia. NATO, which initially insisted the soldiers were in 
Macedonia, later said their exact location at the time was 
uncertain. 

</P>
<P>
	Clinton To Milosevic: Free Soldiers  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said today the United States  
will hold Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic responsible for the 
safety of the three Army soldiers captured last night near the 
Macedonia-Yugoslav border. ``There was absolutely no basis for them 
to be taken,'' Clinton told service members in a speech at a Navy 
base in Norfolk, Va. ``There is no basis for them to be held. There 
is certainly no basis for them to be tried.''

	Bishops Urge Easter Bombing Halt  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. Serbian Orthodox bishops urged President  
Clinton and other NATO leaders today to stop bombing in Yugoslavia 
during the Easter season. ``We implore you to suspend the bombing 
campaign beginning today and at least through April 12. This will 
provide for an opportunity to restart negotiations,'' the bishops 
said in a statement. Today is Maundy Thursday in the Western 
Christian church and Easter is Sunday. The Orthodox church, to 
which most Serbs belong, celebrates Easter a week later.

	Marine: I Said To Ditch Cable Tape  
</P>
<P>
	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- A crewman on the Marine jet that  
clipped an Italian gondola cable, killing 20 people, testified 
today he advised the navigator to get rid of a videotape shot 
during the flight. Capt. Chandler Seagraves' admission came during 
the sentencing phase of the court-martial of Capt. Joseph 
Schweitzer, 31, of Westbury, N.Y. Schweitzer pleaded guilty to 
charges of obstruction of justice and conspiracy to obstruct 
justice. He faces 10 years in prison. The Marine EA-6B Prowler was 
on a low-level training flight near Cavalese, Italy, when it 
severed the ski lift cable Feb. 3, 1998.

	Breast Cancer Studies Conflict  
</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Two studies have reached conflicting conclusions  
about whether a delay of three months or more in the treatment of 
breast cancer can spell the difference between death and survival. 
In one study published in tomorrow's issue of The Lancet, 
scientists at the London-based Imperial Cancer Research Fund found 
that, for one in 20 patients, a delay of three to six months in 
getting treatment could mean the difference between death and 
surviving for five years. But in a separate study of more than 
32,000 women published in the same issue, researchers at 
Huddersfield Royal Infirmary in northern England found that the 
speed of treatment is not critical.

	Dolly the Cloned Sheep Has 3 Lambs  
</P>
<P>
	EDINBURGH, Scotland (AP) -- Dolly the sheep, the first cloned  
mammal, gave birth yesterday to healthy triplets conceived the 
old-fashioned way. Dolly gave birth to two males and one female 
lamb, and ``we are delighted,'' said Dr. Harry Griffin, assistant 
director of the Roslin Institute near Edinburgh. It was a second 
pregnancy for Dolly, who gave birth to a single lamb last spring. 
The institute says Dolly's pregnancies show that despite her 
unusual origins, she is able to breed normally.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rose today but were well off their  
earlier highs as reports of continuing economic strength deepened 
the market's concerns about inflation. Just before 2 p.m. EST, the 
Dow was up 7.50 at 9,793.66. Decliners led advancers 1,464-1,390. 
The Nasdaq was up 15.04 at 2,476.44.

	Stewart Leaves As Missouri Coach  
</P>
<P>
	COLUMBIA, Mo. (AP) -- Norm Stewart retired as Missouri basketball  
coach today after 32 years. He leaves as college basketball's 
third-winningest active coach with 731 victories. ``Stormin' 
Norman,'' as he was known for animated prowling of the sidelines, 
will continue as special assistant to the chancellor. His last team 
went 20-9, losing in the first round of the NCAA tournament. It was 
another postseason disappointment for Missouri -- Stewart took the 
Tigers to the tournament 16 times without ever reaching the Final 
Four.

<HEADLINE> Has Baseball Really Come to This? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The sleeves of a baseball jersey used to be reserved for serious  
stuff. 
</P>
<P>
	A tribute to a fallen comrade. A celebration of Jackie  
Robinson's breakthrough season. A date in franchise history worth 
commemorating. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, apparently, that same space will hawk laundry detergent or  
fast food or, if truth-in-advertising standards apply, credit 
cards. That way, every swing of the bat or sweep of the pitcher's 
arm will remind us what the games are really about: 
</P>
<P>
	Money.  
</P>
<P>
	What is it with baseball these days? Every time you try to  
snuggle up to the game, the people in charge insist on poking their 
fingers in your eye. 
</P>
<P>
	In the last couple of days, we've come to find out just how busy  
the quick-buck artists at central headquarters have been trying to 
turn the warm and fuzzy feelings generated by last season's home 
run chase involving Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa into cold cash. 
</P>
<P>
	It seemed harmless enough when they trotted out a likable ad  
campaign in which real players write letters or make telephone 
calls to fictional fans thanking them for their support. But don't 
pick up the phone just yet. They also hiked ticket prices an 
average of 10 percent and that, combined with the news that the 
bosses and players union will join forces to explore selling sleeve 
ads, means those calls are bound to include a sales pitch for 
something sooner rather than later. 
</P>
<P>
	It sounded funny when the story first broke and Orioles pitcher  
Mike Mussina said what came to his mind was the movie, ``The Bad 
News Bears,'' in which a kids' baseball team is outfitted in shirts 
advertising a bail bondsman. By Thursday, however, Mussina was 
likely summoned to commissioner Bud Selig's office, saluted as a 
creative genius, and put in charge of the entire operation. 
</P>
<P>
	There are a few ground rules in place to guide him: The ads  
apparently will be limited in size to 1- to 1 1/2-inch patches and 
tobacco, alcohol and media companies would not be allowed to buy 
any. But since he's going to need all the help he can get, we offer 
a few natural tie-ins: 
</P>
<P>
	-- ``Supercuts.'' Seen a picture of Randy Johnson lately? Enough  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	-- ``Jenny Craig.'' Only Thursday, after watching tubby hurler  
Hideki Irabu waddle toward first in a spring training game, Yankees 
owner George Steinbrenner called him a ``fat ... toad.'' But 
instead of shipping Irabu to the nearest Class Triple-A outlet at 
considerable cost and embarrassment, The Boss quietly slips him a 
card with the address of a nearby diet center and whispers the 
three words every baseball player understands: ``Free of charge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- The self-help book, ``The Memory Cure,'' by Thomas Crook.  
There's no truth to the rumor that the real reason for a coach at 
first base is to make sure hitters don't run all the way to the 
warning track. But ballplayers do have plenty of things on their 
minds. 
</P>
<P>
	In last season's ALCS, Yankees second baseman Chuck Knoblauch  
went to cover first on a play, then wound up arguing with the 
umpires instead of retrieving the baseball when it bounced off 
Cleveland's Travis Fryman as he crossed the base. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indians scored, eventually won the game and after several  
days of getting ripped, Knoblauch had to step forward and make a 
humbling admission. But if he'd had that little 1-by-1 ad reminder 
sewn on his sleeve, who knows how much embarrassment could have 
been avoided? 
</P>
<P>
	We could go on, but you get the point. And maybe it isn't  
completely fair to tear into baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	Individual sports like auto racing, golf and tennis already have  
taken the athlete-as-billboard model to varying extremes, and at 
least one team sport, Major League Soccer, has uniforms with almost 
as many patches as the Boy Scouts. Plus, if the flak blows over and 
the ads are even a modest financial success, look for the NFL and 
NHL to follow suit and the NBA to sew sleeves back onto its 
jerseys. 
</P>
<P>
	Sad to say, but we've already made peace with rotating  
signboards and statistics brought to us by razor-blade companies 
and the like. Three years ago, in a survey done by the Dallas-based 
Sports Marketing Group, 58 percent of sports fans polled agreed 
with the phrase ``sponsorship is necessary evil.'' A staggering 81 
percent believed those sponsorships were the principal reason that 
most pro and college teams were able to compete at their current 
level. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, they're right, and that being the case, maybe the  
only reason to smack baseball at all is its sense of timing. The 
problem with the game ever since the 1994 meltdown is the 
unsettling sense that the players and owners would swallow a table 
whole to make sure they don't leave a dime on it. 
</P>
<P>
	After which, they might want to consider that offer from  
Rolaids. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Transvestite Killed in Georgia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ABBEVILLE, Ga. (AP) -- Tracey Thompson spent his time hitchhiking  
up and down Interstate 75 in Georgia and Florida, hanging around 
truck stops dressed as a woman. 
</P>
<P>
	He ended up on a country road Tuesday 10 miles from the  
interstate, where he was beaten with a baseball bat. 
</P>
<P>
	Before dying at an area hospital, Thompson told investigators  
his boyfriend had beaten him. Detectives declined Thursday to say 
what else he told them, and have not ruled out the possibility of a 
hate crime. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know whether or not this had anything to do with his  
lifestyle,'' said Gary Rothwell, the Georgia Bureau of 
Investigation agent in charge of the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson, 33, lived in the north Georgia town of Dalton. Police  
said he often hitched rides into south Georgia and Florida, 
frequenting truck stops. 
</P>
<P>
	``From what we can gather, he traveled frequently and he was at  
high risk because of his lifestyle,'' Rothwell said. 
</P>
<P>
	The beating occurred late Monday or early Tuesday on a dirt road  
in central Georgia, about 75 miles south of Macon. Pieces of a 
baseball bat were found on the road. 
</P>
<P>
	Covered with blood and bleeding from head wounds, Thompson  
walked a half mile to a farmhouse before collapsing. He was wearing 
blue jeans and a white shirt dotted with pink flowers, and the 
couple whose home he went to first thought he was a woman, 
authorities said.

<HEADLINE> Schools Get Violence-Curb Grants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- To combat violence and drugs, 50 communities  
nationwide will share up to $180 million in federal grants this 
year for school-based anti-violence programs, mental health 
services and police officers. 
</P>
<P>
	The departments of Education, Justice and Health and Human  
Services are pooling money granted by Congress, agency officials 
announced Thursday. Applications for the Safe Schools/Healthy 
Students program are due June 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``There so many components that go into making schools safe,''  
said George Raiss, lobbyist for the 37,000-student Norfolk, Va., 
school district. ``If the grants enable us to put all of our 
efforts under one umbrella, then this is something we'd definitely 
go after.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department's share this year includes $80 million  
from a program to hire community police officers. But officials 
stressed that putting more police in schools isn't the plan's 
focus. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one group can do it by themselves,'' Attorney General Janet  
Reno said. ``Police chiefs and officers tell me ... we've got to do 
more in terms of prevention. Schools ... can't teach their children 
unless they feel that children are safe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reno said the medical community must address the mental health  
issues that bring about some violence. 
</P>
<P>
	In Anaheim, Calif., police officers work in the schools to build  
a rapport with students, so if they get into trouble with the law, 
they deal with officers they know and trust. But when it is time 
for counseling, the 30,000-student district has trouble finding 
affordable mental health services. 
</P>
<P>
	``They don't do a lot of volunteer work,'' said Bob Montenegro,  
safe schools coordinator for the Anaheim Union High School 
District, which covers Anaheim, Buena Park and other cities. 
``That's the area we really need help in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The grants come out of last fall's White House conference on  
school safety where President Clinton called for a stronger federal 
role in violence prevention. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration hopes Congress will approve $120 million more  
over the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
	After highly publicized shootings in the 1997-98 school year in  
towns such as West Paducah, Ky., Jonesboro, Ark., and Springfield, 
Ore., schools were forced to examine how to guarantee children's 
safety and address public thinking that deadly youth violence is on 
the rise. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those tragic incidences ... really focused the nation on  
school violence,'' Education Secretary Richard W. Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest figures available, from the 1996-97 school year, show  
10 percent of the nation's public schools reported violent crimes. 
Most incidents were concentrated in larger and urban districts. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno said the grants would be available to communities of all  
sizes: ``This type of tragedy happens everywhere.''

<HEADLINE> BP Acquiring Arco for $25.6 Billion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- With rock-bottom oil prices and mergers by  
rivals threatening his company last year, Arco chairman and chief 
executive Mike Bowlin launched a quiet search for a merger partner. 
</P>
<P>
	After unsuccessful overtures to smaller and comparably sized  
companies that Arco could acquire, Bowlin changed direction. In 
January, he picked up the telephone and called BP Amoco, a huge 
multinational big enough to swallow Arco whole and give 
shareholders a significant premium in the process. 
</P>
<P>
	The fate of Atlantic Richfield Co. was revealed on Thursday when  
the two companies announced that BP Amoco acquire Arco in a $25.6 
billion stock deal that will create the world's second-largest oil 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, expected to save the combined companies about $1  
billion a year, would be the eighth merger of the past six months 
in an industry shaken by more than a year of plummeting oil prices 
and increasing demands for cleaner fuels. 
</P>
<P>
	Arco's senior management, including Bowlin, 56, will resign. The  
new company will be known as BP Amoco, but the Arco retail gasoline 
brand will continue for the time being. 
</P>
<P>
	During a news conference Thursday, Bowlin said he was confident  
Arco could have survived on its own but the combination with BP 
Amoco will be better for shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
	``We did this because we think it creates a really terrific  
company from our viewpoint, even though it's a bittersweet moment 
for us,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shareholders will get .82 share of BP Amoco stock for each share  
of Arco, a premium of 26 percent over Arco's price before the 
negotiations were made public on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The value of the deal -- initially pegged at $26.8 billion --  
shrank as shares of BP Amoco fell in trading on the New York Stock 
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	BP Amoco plans to sell about $3 billion in overlapping assets.  
About 2,000 jobs are expected to be eliminated from a combined work 
force of 115,000, mainly in the United States outside Alaska, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Idled workers will be able to pick from several severance  
options. Bowlin will leave Arco with $3.2 million in salary and 
bonuses plus another $29.3 million in exercisable stock options, 
according to estimates by Executive Compensation Advisory Services 
based on Arco's proxy statements. 
</P>
<P>
	As crude prices began to fall in late 1997, Arco was hit harder  
than most. Over the past two years the company had shed its 
chemicals and coal mining operations, leaving it more dependent on 
oil and more vulnerable to price fluctuations. 
</P>
<P>
	Worried about Arco's ability to compete, Bowlin last year began  
looking at possible mergers. 
</P>
<P>
	In January, he called his old friend, BP Amoco chief executive  
John Browne. 
</P>
<P>
	``I phoned him in his office and said, 'We ought to get together  
and talk about ways we could cooperate. He said, 'OK,' '' Bowlin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Only weeks earlier, British Petroleum had acquired Chicago-based  
Amoco in a $57.6 billion deal. But Browne jumped at the opportunity 
to deepen his reach in the United States by picking up Arco's 
Alaskan oil and gas reserves and its West Coast refining and 
retailing operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Together Arco and BP Amoco operate the giant Prudhoe Bay field  
in Alaska. Also, Arco expects to have its 360 million-barrel Alpine 
field operating in about two years. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's largest oil producer would be created by combining  
Arco's dominant West Coast business with BP Amoco's Midwest and 
East Coast operations. 
</P>
<P>
	BP Amoco also will obtain Arco's natural gas interests in Asia,  
which include up to 8 trillion cubic feet in Indonesia. Arco also 
has gas reserves in Qatar and oil interests in Algeria, Venezuela 
and Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	Browne's interest in developing natural gas as a cleaner  
alternative to petroleum was another element that attracted Bowlin 
to BP Amoco, the Arco chief said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	In a February speech to a Houston gathering of oil industry  
leaders, Bowlin said the demand for oil would diminish in the next 
century as the demand for low-polluting energy grows. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nations of the world that are striving to modernize will make  
choices different from the ones we have made. They will have to. 
And even today's industrial powers will shift energy use 
patterns,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowlin's outlook probably stemmed in part from Arco's growing  
vulnerability, said Fadel Gheit, an analyst with Fahnestock &AMP; Co. 
in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``In order to grow the company, he didn't have the financial  
flexibility that was needed,'' Gheit said. ``He was already talking 
to BP so he knew the end was near.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bowlin made the right move in initiating the merger, said Eugene  
Nowak, a New York-based analyst with ABN Amro Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	``Combined, it provides a greater opportunity for the growth of  
Arco,'' he said. ``Obviously, Arco is very leveraged with oil 
prices. I think (prices) dropped to the point where CEOs -- not just 
Mike Bowlin -- were rethinking their strategy.''

<HEADLINE> Fed Panel Reports on Y2K Readiness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Nearly a dozen federal agencies failed to meet  
President Clinton's deadline for protecting their most critical 
computer systems against potential problems when the Year 2000 
arrives. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Clinton administration officials emphasized that 92  
percent of the government's 6,123 crucial computer systems are 
``Y2K compliant'' and should work properly come January. 
</P>
<P>
	``These systems have gone through the full stages of not only  
analysis and assessment, but remediation, testing and 
implementation,'' said John Koskinen, chairman of the President's 
Council on Year 2000 Conversion. ``Implementation includes 
installing the upgraded or replaced systems wherever they're in 
operation, not only domestically but around the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement came Wednesday, the deadline Clinton imposed  
more than a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, immediately  
criticized the White House's characterization of the report. 
</P>
<P>
	``The administration is redefining success by patting themselves  
on the back for being 92 percent Y2K compliant. The reality is, the 
administration has failed to meet its own deadline,'' Armey said in 
a statement. ``The administration is fooling itself and luring the 
American public into a false sense of security.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Koskinen said 13 of the 24 departments now report that their  
most essential computer systems are 100 percent ready for business 
on Jan. 1. Ten agencies have repaired and tested at least 85 
percent of their systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Only the U.S. Agency for International Development has not fixed  
any of its critical systems, mainly because it started late and ran 
into more problems than expected, Koskinen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ironically, the White House reported that only one-fourth of its  
systems were compliant. It expects to repair all of its systems by 
the end of October. 
</P>
<P>
	Koskinen said his panel's findings were ``validated in a lot of  
different ways,'' including reviews by each agency's inspector 
general and the General Accounting Office, the investigative branch 
of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Roughly 500 critical computer systems need work before they are  
considered Y2K compliant. However, Koskinen expressed confidence 
that all agencies -- including USAID -- would finish their work by 
the end of the summer. 
</P>
<P>
	The so-called ``Y2K'' problem occurs because many computers are  
programmed to recognize only the last two digits of a year and, 
without repairs, may malfunction beginning Jan. 1 when they might 
assume it is 1900. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Steve Horn, R-Calif., chairman of the House Government  
Reform Committee's government management subcommittee, was 
encouraged by the 92 percent compliant rate but said ``we should 
have had it sooner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Now we've got to do the real serious work, which is test it in  
an operational environment. If we can test it and it still works, 
that's fine. But time's a wasting,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ed DeSeve, deputy management director for the administration's  
Office of Management and Budget, said the government will continue 
``end-to-end'' testing of its systems to make sure they work 
internally, as well as with those from state and local agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said OMB would seek contingency plans from departments  
by June 30.

<HEADLINE> Yahoo! Is Buying Broadcast.com </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Yahoo! Inc. is buying Broadcast.com Inc. for  
$5.7 billion in stock, adding the Internet's leading supplier of 
radio and video programs to Yahoo!'s growing array of services. 
</P>
<P>
	The transaction announced today puts Yahoo! in a solid position  
to take advantage of the high-speed future of the Internet. Yahoo! 
currently offers a directory service and search engine for the 
World Wide Web, providing easy links to millions of sites. 
</P>
<P>
	Broadcast.com is perhaps best known for its Web broadcasts of  
John Glenn's second launch into space and the Victoria's Secret 
fashion show. But the company's services are expected to grow in 
popularity as connections to cyberspace get faster and easier. 
</P>
<P>
	The acquisition ``really positions Yahoo! to play a defining  
role as we see the rise of audio and video content on the Web,'' 
said Paul Noglows, a San Francisco-based analyst with Hambrecht &AMP; 
Quist. 
</P>
<P>
	``From Broadcast.com's perspective, it will make their services  
available to a much broader range of users, considering Yahoo! 
attracts 50 million unique users to its site a month.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yahoo! agreed to pay $130 a share for Broadcast.com's stock.  
Broadcast.com investors will receive .77 of a Yahoo share for each 
Broadcast.com share. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors were quick to bet on the success of the combination.  
</P>
<P>
	In trading Thursday, Broadcast.com's shares rose $4.87 1/2 to  
$123.06 1/4 on the Nasdaq Stock Market, while Yahoo!'s stock rose 
$1.87 1/4 to $170.25. 
</P>
<P>
	Founded in 1994 by Stanford University doctoral candidates David  
Filo and Jerry Yang, Yahoo! is one of the premier destinations on 
the Internet. The company's turbocharged stock, which has risen 264 
percent in the past 12 months, has turned into a currency to snap 
up rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	But Broadcast.com wasn't cheap. The Dallas-based firm, which  
went public in July, has seen its shares rise 1,213 percent in just 
eight months. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, however, isn't making any money yet. Broadcast.com  
lost $16.4 million last year on revenue of $22.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Yahoo!'s premium for a company in the red didn't seem to bother  
Yahoo! shareholder Charles Lax, a general partner with SoftBank 
Venture Capital. 
</P>
<P>
	``What else is new?,'' he asked. ``High-speed access (to the  
Internet) is very important, and this is just an anchor acquisition 
for that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This is Yahoo!'s second major deal this year. The Santa Clara,  
Calif.-based company announced the $4.58 billion acquisition of 
GeoCities Inc. in January. 
</P>
<P>
	GeoCities, based in Los Angeles, is the No. 5 Web destination  
and has been used by more than 3 million people to set up home 
pages where they can publish their writings, post their family 
photos or try to sell things. 
</P>
<P>
	The Internet industry is both expanding and consolidating at a  
rapid pace. New companies go public almost daily and quickly become 
targets or suitors in corporate takeovers. 
</P>
<P>
	Companies like Yahoo!, America Online Inc. and Lycos Inc. are  
just a few of the firms looking for strategic acquisitions that 
reflect the integration of computer, television and telephone 
services with information and media. 
</P>
<P>
	And Yahoo! may be back on the hunt soon.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's clear that the Web has been in a race for market share  
since the beginning,'' said Steve O'Leary, a managing director at 
Broadview International, a merger advisory firm. ``I wouldn't be 
surprised to see Yahoo! announce more bold strokes in the future.''

<HEADLINE> First Lady Wraps Up N. Africa Trip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MARRAKECH, Morocco (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton returns to  
Washington tonight from a part-sightseeing, part-diplomacy tour of 
North Africa that she hopes advanced U.S. ``strategic and human 
interests'' in this Arab region. 
</P>
<P>
	The 12 days in Egypt, Tunisia and Morocco with her daughter,  
Chelsea, also offered a welcome escape at the close of her 
husband's yearlong sex-and-impeachment scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always like getting away from Washington,'' the first lady  
said Wednesday as she wrapped up her tour with a brief news 
conference and a business meeting with Morocco's King Hassan. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope for our country this has also been a trip that has  
helped to move the agenda forward as to how we relate to people in 
this region of the world,'' the first lady told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Particularly, she said she hoped her tours helped to erase the  
``stereotypes and negative images'' that some Arabs and Americans 
harbor toward each other, and to solidify this region's partnership 
in the Middle East peace process. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are strategic and human interests both that I hope have  
been advanced by the trip.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton had been scheduled to spend several hours today in  
Fes, but bad weather prevented her plane from landing there and was 
diverted to Rabat, the Moroccan capital. 
</P>
<P>
	With her return flight to Washington booked for today, Mrs.  
Clinton sounded reluctant to face decisions about joining the 2000 
U.S. Senate race from New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've really tried to put it out of my mind the last 10 days,''  
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wherever she ventured, she was received as both stateswoman and  
royalty. 
</P>
<P>
	In almost daily telephone calls from President Clinton, the  
first lady has kept an eye on the world beyond the rolling oasis of 
adoring villagers, flattering foreign leaders and ancient wonders -- 
mosques, tombs and temples -- thrown open for her enjoyment. 
</P>
<P>
	The juxtaposition is sobering.  
</P>
<P>
	While Mrs. Clinton dined on King Hassan's largesse in a desert  
mecca built specially for her, her husband faced anti-war 
protesters outside Sunday church services who accused him of 
starting World War III in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	At home, polls showed New Yorkers cooling to the notion of Mrs.  
Clinton seeking the seat of retiring Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan. 
And, New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, her most likely opponent 
in that 2000 race, unveiled a Web site dubbed ``HillaryNo.Com'' to 
blast her leadership credentials. 
</P>
<P>
	Here, in North Africa, she could do no wrong.  
</P>
<P>
	``May God repay you for this. May God glorify you,'' an elderly  
Moroccan woman repeated over and over as Mrs. Clinton toured the 
run-down squatter community of Koudia. 
</P>
<P>
	``She is second in the world,'' Mariam Abouelouyoun enthused  
when Mrs. Clinton ventured to the rural village of Tasselmante. 
</P>
<P>
	Hassan insisted, ``We will not only treat her as a head of  
state, but as a member of my family,'' said U.S. Ambassador to 
Morocco Edward Gabriel. 
</P>
<P>
	To wit, the king dispatched to Mrs. Clinton's five-star hotel a  
pile of silk robes and invited her to his dynasty's mausoleum at 
Rissani, the first time it was opened to a non-Islamic visitor. 
</P>
<P>
	Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali turned the first  
lady's 15-minute courtesy call into an hourlong summit on tough 
issues, including his country's ``shortcomings'' on human rights. 
</P>
<P>
	``That really is going to be her greatest legacy -- calling  
attention to human rights, violations against women,'' historian 
Carl Anthony said. 
</P>
<P>
	The first lady showed a certain exuberance in her travels far  
from Washington -- belly laughs shared with diplomats and tour 
guides alike, the bounce of her hips as she clapped and flailed her 
arms to the beat of a Berber drummer. 
</P>
<P>
	She also endeavored to normalize relations with reporters, many  
of whom covered her husband's impeachment. She held two small news 
conferences, included the press in her ``let-her-hair-down'' desert 
sleepover, and held two off-the-record dinners with reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither publicly nor privately did she betray any clue on her  
future plans. But from holding such command of the world stage, 
could Mrs. Clinton see herself as one of 100 senators relegated to 
behind-the-scenes dealmaking? 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm still weighing all this in my own mind,'' Mrs. Clinton  
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Contemplating her work on the rights and health of women and  
children around the globe, Mrs. Clinton added: 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't believe that my one voice is in any way sufficient to  
speak out on some of these issues, but I will continue to add it no 
matter what decision I make about my own future.''

<HEADLINE> Mutual Fund Assets Fall $1.19 Bil. / Money Market Funds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Assets of the nation's retail money market  
mutual funds decreased by $1.19 billion to $871.89 billion in the 
latest week, the Investment Company Institute said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Assets of taxable money market funds in the retail category  
decreased by $950.3 million to $719.71 billion for the week ended 
Wednesday, the Washington-based mutual fund trade group said. 
Tax-exempt fund assets decreased by $238.3 million to $152.18 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Assets of institutional money market funds decreased by $15.24  
billion to $570.76 billion for the same period. Among institutional 
funds, taxable money market fund assets decreased by $14.37 billion 
to $522.39 billion while assets of tax-exempt funds decreased by 
$867.2 million to $48.37 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Total money market assets stood at $1.443 trillion for the week.  
</P>
<P>
	Assets for the previous week were revised to $1.459 trillion to  
reflect reporting errors and a change in the number of funds 
reporting. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds rose to  
4.35 percent in the week ended Tuesday compared with 4.32 percent 
the previous week, said IBC's Money Fund Report, a trade journal 
published in Ashland, Mass., by IBC Financial Data Inc. The 30-day 
average yield splipped to 4.34 percent from 4.35 percent, IBC 
Financial Data said. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven-day compounded yield rose to 4.44 percent from 4.42  
percent in the previous week, while the 30-day compounded yield 
remained unchanged at 4.44 percent, IBC Financial Data said. 
</P>
<P>
	The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds slid  
to 60 days from 61 days during the previous week, IBC Financial 
Data said. 
</P>
<P>
	The newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of 100 leading  
commercial banks, savings and loan associations and savings banks 
in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the annual percentage 
yield available on money market accounts fell to 2.10 percent as of 
Wednesday, compared with 2.15 percent the previous week. 
</P>
<P>
	The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the annual  
percentage yield available on interest-bearing checking accounts 
remained unchanged at 0.95 percent from a week earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank Rate Monitor said the annual percentage yield held steady  
at 4.14 percent on six-month certificates of deposit. Yields on 
1-year CDs also remained unchanged at 4.38 percent but fell to 4.46 
percent from 4.47 percent on 2 1/2-year CDs. Yields on 5-year CDs were 
unchanged at 4.61 percent.

<HEADLINE>  Soldiers Described as Bright, Brave </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	While Serb television showed images of three U.S. servicemen  
captured in Yugoslavia, their relatives and friends back home 
Thursday prayed for the soldiers' safe return and described them as 
brave young men who were proud to serve their country. 
</P>
<P>
	The three soldiers, part of a NATO peacekeeping force, were  
captured Wednesday near the Yugoslav-Macedonian border. 
Yugoslavia's state news agency reported the three will go on 
military trial Friday, a move President Clinton condemned as a 
violation of international treaties. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon identified the soldiers as Staff Sgt. Andrew A.  
Ramirez, 24, of Los Angeles; Staff Sgt. Christopher J. Stone, 25, 
of Smiths Creek, Mich.; and Spc. Steven M. Gonzales, 21, of 
Huntsville, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Gonzales appeared battered and bruised, his family  
expressed relief he didn't look worse. 
</P>
<P>
	His parents, Gilbert and Rosie Gonzales, are both employees of  
the Texas corrections system, and prisons statewide were asked to 
tie yellow ribbons to their entrances until the soldiers are 
released. 
</P>
<P>
	Friends and former teachers said Gonzales was a likable, bright  
athlete during his high school days in Palestine, 90 miles north of 
Huntsville in east Texas. He graduated in 1995 and won a 
scholarship to Texas A&AMP;M, but left after a year to pursue a dream 
of joining an elite Army corps. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was the type of student you'd love to have: hard-working,  
always happy, funny,'' said teacher Kay Stroud, who had Gonzales in 
her advanced placement biology class his senior year. 
</P>
<P>
	A friend, Kelly Williams, recognized her former classmate as  
soon as she saw the Serbian TV pictures. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately, he's got rather big ears. He used to wiggle his  
ears for us and make us laugh,'' she said. ``That's how I knew it 
was him. I was like, you could not mistake those ears.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stone, whose wife and 5-year-old son live in San Antonio, was  
described by former teachers and classmates as a talented athlete 
also blessed with the ``gift of gab.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm surprised he couldn't talk his way out of this,'' said Ken  
Marzka, Stone's cross-country coach at Capac Community 
Junior-Senior High School, about 50 miles northeast of Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	``Chris is a tough kid ... he never quit,'' Marzka said. ``He  
never was great (as a runner),'' Marzka said. ``But when push came 
to shove, he got tougher and tougher. Chris is going to be just 
fine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	School counselor Kathy Kish said Stone was well-liked by  
students and teachers. His membership in Students Against Drunk 
Driving showed his concern for his fellow students, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't surprise us a bit that he's serving our country on  
a peace mission,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Los Angeles, outside the modest home of Ramirez's divorced  
father, Andy Ramirez, neighbors prayed for the captured staff 
sergeant and reminisced about the ``all-American kid'' they watched 
grow up. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramirez, a wrestler in high school, joined the Army after  
graduation in 1992. He wanted to follow the path of his hero, older 
brother Steven Ramirez, an Army veteran who is now a Los Angeles 
police detective. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those two brothers are very close. It hit home because we're a  
very united family,'' said Frank Jasso, Ramirez's great-uncle. 
</P>
<P>
	Some neighbors wept as they talked outside the home five miles  
east of downtown. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know he will come back and we will all greet him with open  
arms,'' said neighbor and longtime friend Johnny Rios. ``He's a 
hero now because he did his duty as a military personnel. We just 
thank God for putting him in our lives to serve the country.''

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sheldon E. Kopp, a psychologist and author  
best known for his 1972 book ``If You Meet a Buddha on the Road, 
Kill Him,'' died of cardiac arrhythmia and pneumonia Monday. He was 
70. 
</P>
<P>
	Kopp was the author of 17 books, many of them written as guides  
to help readers discover importance in their own existence. 
</P>
<P>
	``If You Meet a Buddha on the Road, Kill Him'' examined the  
struggle to find meaning in oneself while relying less on spiritual 
teachers. 
</P>
<P>
	His other books include ``The Hanged Man'' (1974), ``The Hidden  
Meanings'' (1975), ``This Side of Tragedy'' (1977) and ``An End to 
Innocence'' (1978).

Pictures, died Sunday. He was 91. 
</P>
<P>
	Perkins was a stunt double for Spencer Tracy, Yul Brenner and  
Gene Hackman. 
</P>
<P>
	Perkins arrived in Hollywood in 1928 and got parts in movies  
like ``King Kong,'' ``Moby Dick,'' ``Robin Hood'' and ``Mutiny on

</P>
<P>
	In the 1950s and 1960s, Perkins was a familiar TV face with  
appearances ranging from ``Batman'' to ``The Virginian.''

</P>
<P>
	She was one of the last surviving grandchildren of Leo Tolstoy,  
who authored ``War and Peace'' and ``Anna Karenina.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vera Tolstoy was 7 when her grandfather died in 1910. A decade  
later, she fled her homeland in the wake of the Bolshevik 
revolution. She did not return to the Tolstoy estate of Yasnaya 
Polyana until 1991 for a reunion of the writer's descendants. 
</P>
<P>
	Vera Tolstoy spent 20 years as a Russian-language broadcaster  
for Voice of America in Washington. She retired in 1974.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- For some farmers, the best crop is the one

<P>
	In west Texas last year, 200 farmers obtained federally  
subsidized insurance on a type of cotton that wasn't feasible to 
grow in their arid region. They paid $4.4 million in premiums and 
then claimed nearly $15 million in benefits when most of the crop 
failed. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers in North Dakota and surrounding states recently rushed  
out and bought seed for durum wheat, even in areas not suited for 
the crop, to take advantage of a new insurance policy offering 
benefits far higher than they could earn if they grew and sold 
ordinary wheat. 
</P>
<P>
	Crop insurance provides a vital safety net for farmers,  
especially when prices are low and the government has been trying 
to phase out its role in agriculture. But government auditors say 
the insurance system is riddled with abuse, conflicts of interest 
and errors because taxpayers bear most of the risk for losses, not 
the private companies that sell and service the policies. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies ``have little reason to effectively monitor risky  
policy holders, little reason to deny claims of questionable 
losses, and no cause to find fault with their own practices,'' said 
an internal report by the Agriculture Department's inspector 
general. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies ``are supposed to ensure compliance, but they also  
have an aggressive sales function. ... The two don't mix well,'' 
said Scott Stofferahn, who oversees USDA's farm programs in North 
Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
	Stephen Frerichs, a spokesman for the companies, dismissed the  
inspector general's report this week, saying it was merely 
``rehashing a bunch of old'' allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides assuming most of the risk for losses, the government  
subsidizes the premiums farmers pay for the insurance and pays the 
companies a fee for handling the policies. The program has been 
costing the government more than $1.5 billion a year, and Congress 
is considering doubling that to improve the coverage and make it 
less costly to producers. 
</P>
<P>
	The insurance companies have to pay some of the losses, with  
their share varying according to their government contracts. 
Nevertheless, they have made $2.8 billion in fees and underwriting 
gains -- their gross profits after losses -- over the last four 
years. That's $400 million more than they made in the previous 14 
years combined. 
</P>
<P>
	Acreage covered by the insurance has doubled to about 70 percent  
of all farmland since the program was last overhauled in 1994, 
while losses have been relatively low. The weather has been good 
through most of the country since 1993 except for droughts in the 
South and Southwest last year that prompted Congress to provide 
$1.7 billion in disaster relief for lost crops and livestock 
assistance. 
</P>
<P>
	``Naturally the underwriting gains are going to be larger and  
the indemnity payments are lower,'' said Frerichs, manager of the 
American Association of Crop Insurers. 
</P>
<P>
	USDA's Risk Management Agency, which oversees the program, has  
been shifting more of the risk to the companies in recent years and 
cutting their fees, officials say. In the case of the durum 
policies, USDA sharply reduced the potential benefits and is now 
being sued by farmers to have them reinstated. 
</P>
<P>
	``Farmers are honest folks. If they think someone is cheating,  
they'll report it,'' said John Zirschky, the agency's associate 
administrator. ``Farmers don't like to see people stealing 
taxpayer's money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers currently pay $50 a crop for basic ``catastrophic''  
coverage, regardless of acreage, and about 60 percent of the 
premium -- which can run into thousands of dollars -- for more 
extensive ``buyup'' insurance. Those policies cover losses from 
drought, floods, pests, and in some cases, drops in projected 
revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	The government pays the rest of the premium. In 1998, the  
government spent $946 million on premium subsidies and paid another 
$759 million to the companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers complain that crop insurance is usually too stingy and  
they want coverage for more specialty crops and also for livestock, 
which can't be insured now. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the time, the insurance ``doesn't provide adequate  
revenue to cover the expenses put into the ground every spring, 
with the amount of risk that you're subjected to,'' said wheat 
grower Tom DeKrey of Steele, N.D.

<HEADLINE> Lawn Mowing May Cause Air Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- That sweet scent of a freshly mowed lawn may  
really be the smell of air pollution. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists studying the sources of chemicals in the air have  
found that injured grass gives off volatile compounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wounding, cutting and drying of leaves and stems occur both  
naturally and by human activities, wound-induced and drying-induced 
... compounds are expected to be significant in the atmosphere,'' a 
team of researchers says in a study scheduled to appear in a future 
issue of the journal Geophysical Research Letters. 
</P>
<P>
	``In urban areas, lawn mowing may contribute to the total ...  
emissions and impact air quality,'' the report says. 
</P>
<P>
	But do not panic. While total emissions from cutting grass and  
crops worldwide may seem large, it does not mean cutting the grass 
is dangerous for individuals. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just doesn't seem likely to me that the smell of newly mown  
grass is toxic,'' said Ray Fall of the University of Colorado, a 
biochemist and one of the researchers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mowing the lawn is no more hazardous than eating raw  
vegetables,'' he added, pointing out that chewing veggies also 
releases tiny amounts of the same chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the grazing of animals can release these compounds into the  
air, he said: ``Every time a cow chomps grass you get these little 
surges.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yet, Fall said the team was surprised at the variety of  
chemicals released when crops were cut and during the drying 
process, including methanol, hexanal, acetaldehyde, acetone and 
butatone. Some, such as acetone, can contribute to the formation 
smog, the paper notes. 
</P>
<P>
	The scientists estimate that cutting crops adds about 1.6  
million tons of acetone to the atmosphere annually, compared with 
estimated total natural emissions of eight to 13 million tons. They 
have not estimated the totals for other compounds. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers studied red fescue grass cut from a lawn near  
their laboratory in Boulder, Colo., and clover grown in a 
greenhouse. This summer they plan a study of alfalfa. 
</P>
<P>
	The Environmental Protection Agency has a laboratory in North  
Carolina looking at biological emissions of chemicals, but has not 
studied grass or clover. 
</P>
<P>
	The new report says that in addition to lawn mowing, chemicals  
are given off by drying plant material in arid areas and during the 
harvest in agricultural areas. 
</P>
<P>
	``It can be expected that the resulting emissions have a  
significant impact on the chemistry of the atmosphere over these 
areas,'' said the report. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cut and drying organic material appears to be a significant  
global, and possibly regional, source of volatile organic 
compounds. One that we think may not have been well accounted for 
before,'' Carlton J. Howard of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration's Aeronomy Laboratory in Boulder said in a telephone 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Howard noted that emissions from lawn mowers and even barbecues  
have been identified as components of pollution in some urban areas 
and this study adds one more source of chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is something that needs to be looked at carefully,'' he  
said.

<HEADLINE> Y2K Cancels Promise Keepers Rally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Worried about possible Y2K problems, the men's  
ministry Promise Keepers is canceling plans to hold rallies at 
state capitals nationwide on New Year's Day 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Law enforcement officials in several states have expressed  
concerns about ``the prospects of large gatherings, public safety 
personnel needs and too many unknowns connected with Y2K,'' Promise 
Keepers' spokesman Steve Chavis said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of the Christian organization are instead being  
encouraged to stay at home with their families and to practice 
their faith there. 
</P>
<P>
	The so-called ``Y2K'' problem occurs because many computers are  
programmed to recognize only the last two digits of a year and, 
without repairs, may malfunction beginning Jan. 1 when they might 
assume it is 1900.

	Income and Spending Growth Strong  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans' personal income increased in  
February by what's considered a robust rate, a seasonally adjusted 
0.5 percent, while consumer spending was up even more, 0.7 percent. 
Both figures announced by the Commerce Department today were 
expected by analysts and illustrate strength in the U.S. economy in 
the first quarter. In another sign of economic vigor, the 
department reported separately that construction spending jumped a 
much-stronger-than-expected 2.2 percent in February, the largest 
increase in eight months and the fourth in a row. And adding to the 
economic picture, the National Association of Purchasing Management 
in New York said manufacturing grew in March for the second 
consecutive month. ``We've got strength pretty much across the 
board,'' said economist Sung Won Sohn of Wells Fargo &AMP; Co. in 
Minneapolis. 

</P>
<P>
	Purchasing Managers' Index Rises  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The nation's manufacturing sector extended its  
growth spurt for a second month in March, as production and new 
orders gained momentum, corporate purchasing executives said in a 
survey released today. The National Association of Purchasing 
Management reported its monthly index of business activity rose to 
54.3 percent last month, an increase of 1.9 percentage points from 
its February level. In February, the manufacturing sector reversed 
an eight-month slide that had been one of the few blights in the 
robust U.S. economy. The continued growth in March heartened 
economists.

direction several times over the course of the day. The pre-holiday 
trading was light, allowing prices to take sharper swings than 
usual. The market will be closed tomorrow for Good Friday. Broader

workers from its staff and that of recently acquired Netscape Inc. 
The giant Internet service provider made the cuts yesterday. About 
half came from Dulles-based AOL's 10,000-person staff, the others

in stock. The deal announced today would greatly expand CBS's 
position in the business of selling programs to TV stations and 
complement its other broadcasting activities led by its ownership 
of the CBS television network. King World has been a frequent 
subject of takeover speculation but the rumors about a deal with 
CBS have intensified in recent days. CBS shares were down 11/16 at

advantage of the high-speed future of the Internet. Broadcast.com 
is perhaps best known for its Web broadcasts of John Glenn's second 
launch into space and the Victoria's Secret fashion show. But the 
company's services are expected to grow in popularity as 
connections to cyberspace get faster and easier. Yahoo! shares were 
up 11 3/8 at 179 3/4, and Broadcast.com was up 11 13/16 at 130.

second largest oil company. The combined company would be exceeded 
in size only by Exxon Corp. once it completes its purchase of Mobil 
Corp. BP Amoco said 2,000 jobs are expected to be eliminated from a 
combined work force of 115,000, mainly in the United States outside 
Alaska. The deal is subject to approval by shareholders in both 
companies. BP Amoco shares were down 5 3/16 at 95 3/16, and

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Boeing has offered to cut the price of its  
C-17 transport plane by 15 percent if the Air Force agrees to buy 
60 more of the cargo planes during the first decade of the 21st 
Century. Stu Thomson, Boeing's vice president for business 
development, said the aerospace company made an unsolicited offer 
this week to provide 60 additional C-17s between 2003 and 2007 at 
an average cost of $149 million each. That's 15 percent less than 
the expected cost of the last of 120 of the cargo planes already 
ordered by the Air Force through 2003, Thomson said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Not Shamed by Impeachment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton says he does not see his  
impeachment as ``some great badge of shame'' and believes 
historians will judge there were political motives behind Congress' 
action. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview Wednesday with CBS News, Clinton said he felt  
``honored'' that the impeachment gave him a chance to defend the 
Constitution. He said the American people saw the impeachment as an 
attempt by Republicans to undermine his presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those that did not agree with what I had done and were furious  
that it had worked and that the country was doing well, and 
attempted to use what should have been a constitutional and legal 
process for political ends, did not prevail,'' Clinton said. 
``That's the way I saw it.... 
</P>
<P>
	``But I do not regard this impeachment vote as some great badge  
of shame. I do not,'' Clinton said. ``I do not believe it was 
warranted and I don't think it was right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The interview, conducted at the White House by CBS anchor Dan  
Rather, elicited Clinton's most detailed assessment yet of his 
impeachment on charges stemming from his relationship with Monica 
Lewinsky. He was acquitted by the Senate in February. 
</P>
<P>
	The president said he never thought about resigning.  
</P>
<P>
	``I would never have legitimized what I believe is horribly  
wrong with what has occurred here over the last four or five years. 
So it never crossed my mind,'' he said. ``....I just, I prayed 
about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also said he has no consuming animosities toward those who  
pushed impeachment. ``I don't wake up every day mad at those 
people,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any moment I spend full of anger and bitterness is a moment I  
am robbing from my wife or from my daughter or from my country or 
from my friends,'' he said. ``I just think that it's past us and we 
need to put it behind us, and we need to go on. 
</P>
<P>
	``We owe that to the American people, to let it go. ... All the  
great players here, they need to let it go,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	While the interview focused largely on the crisis in Kosovo,  
Clinton also discussed how first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton's 
ruminations on running for a Senate seat in New York and how his 
family is faring the wake of the Lewinsky scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Given what we've been through, we're doing reasonably well,''  
he said. ``We're not a large family. We do love each other very 
much, and we work hard to support one another.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he had no idea what Mrs. Clinton would decide, but that  
it still struck him that having a first lady run for office was ``a 
highly unusual thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``And I can imagine that many voters in New York would wonder,''  
he said. ``And that would be a burden she would have to carry in 
the campaign.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But, Clinton said, ``I think if she could win an election like  
that, she would be magnificent.''

<HEADLINE> Congress Resists Recycling Effort </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Nearly a decade after recycling began on  
Capitol Hill, many congressional offices still aren't separating 
the paper and aluminum cans from the lunch trash. Even the House 
chairman who oversees environmental issues on public lands has 
turned his back on the effort. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Don Young, R-Alaska, said his office separated recyclables  
only to see the effort go to waste because of sloppy practices. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the time, the garbage was being separated by our office. It  
was later then placed in the same garbage bag by the cleaning 
folks, and it didn't seem as if it was being recycled,'' the 
chairman of the House Resources Committee said through a spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	Even high-grade white paper, the most lucrative product to  
recycle, isn't being widely sorted. For instance, the House earned 
$25,000 for that recycling in fiscal 1998 -- far short of the 
$150,000 that could be earned if 60 percent of the product was 
sorted, according to the chamber's former recycling coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
	Recycling advocates are frustrated that some on Capitol Hill  
ignore the program entirely while others recycle halfheartedly. 
It's the byproduct of an institution where the 535 lawmakers set 
the rules for each individual office and committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``The most stubborn bureaucracy in America is Congress itself,''  
said Rep. Sam Farr, D-Calif., a recycling supporter. ``There's 
never been an attitude that we should have to do that. No one is 
responsible inside an office. Some offices take it seriously and 
some don't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The recycling difficulties are the latest example of a Congress  
that is having trouble following the laws and regulations that 
apply to the rest of Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, The Associated Press reported that inspectors  
appointed to ensure Congress obeys the same workplace safety rules 
as corporate America found numerous violations, including 
unprotected workers digging through contaminated trash, high 
concentrations of Legionnaires' disease bacteria in one building 
and improper storage of flammable chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
	Many U.S. cities and counties, as well as the executive branch  
of the federal government, require recycling. But Congress has kept 
its program voluntary. The recycling effort is under control of the 
architect of the Capitol, whose 2,000 employees maintain 
congressional buildings. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1997 survey of the 435 House offices found that nearly a dozen  
refused to participate and that many others failed to keep their 
promise. 
</P>
<P>
	``The problem is, it's a totally voluntary program,'' said Herb  
Franklin, administrative assistant in the architect's office. 
``There are 535 employing offices and each sets the criteria for 
its office.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To enforce recycling, Franklin said, ``you would have to have  
policing, and what would you do if people didn't comply? What are 
we supposed to do if an apple core is in a container with white 
paper?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Also, staff turnover is pretty rapid. Our situation is not to  
be compared with a private employer or the executive branch,'' 
Franklin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite past setbacks, the architect's executive officer, Lynne  
Theiss, said her agency is making another attempt at improving 
Congress' record. In a pilot project started last August and set to 
expand, some offices have been given separate containers for 
high-grade white paper, a lower-grade mixed paper, cans and bottles 
and pure garbage. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of Congress' mixed trash is now compressed and taken away  
by a recycling company, which pays for sorted white paper but 
nothing for material that is ``contaminated'' with garbage and 
other refuse. 
</P>
<P>
	The House earned only $959 in fiscal 1996 from recycled paper,  
and that total fell to a minuscule $7.51 in fiscal 1997 before 
rebounding to more than $25,000 in fiscal 1998, said the General 
Services Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1998 improvement came after the House, in August 1997, hired  
a former paper industry consultant, Patricia Dollar, to be its 
recycling coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
	In an internal report in late 1997, Ms. Dollar said Congress  
could have earned $150,000 that year if 60 percent of its 
high-grade paper had been recycled at market prices. 
</P>
<P>
	But Ms. Dollar never met that goal. She was fired in February  
1998 from her $25,600 position after seven months on the job. 
</P>
<P>
	She alleged in an interview she was dismissed after refusing a  
superior's order to use ``evasive'' language in response to a 
congressman's complaints about problems in the recycling effort. 
The architect's office declined to address her allegation, citing 
ongoing litigation involving Ms. Dollar.

<HEADLINE> Amtrak Trucker Losing License </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Illinois officials said today they will suspend  
the commercial driver's license of the trucker involved in last 
month's deadly Amtrak collision. 
</P>
<P>
	John R. Stokes, 58, will lose his truck-driving privileges for  
two months starting in June, said Secretary of State Jesse White. 
</P>
<P>
	Keeping Stokes from driving a truck, even for 60 days, will ``no  
doubt'' make Illinois roads safer, White said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stokes' license had been under suspension at the time of the  
March 15 crash because of prior speeding tickets, but he had been 
allowed to drive with a temporary license during the suspension. 
</P>
<P>
	That suspension expired March 25. Last week, White said state  
lawyers concluded there was no way they could legally extend it, 
despite Stokes' checkered driving record. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, however, White has learned of an additional traffic  
violation on Stokes' record from last year. 
</P>
<P>
	A two-month suspension is the toughest penalty the state can  
impose on Stokes under Illinois law, White's office said. He will 
still be allowed to drive his car. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors have not filed any charges against Stokes in the  
wreck. Eleven people were killed and more than 100 injured when 
Amtrak's southbound City of New Orleans struck a semi-trailer truck 
that Stokes was driving at a rural crossing near Bourbonnais. 
</P>
<P>
	Stokes has denied any wrongdoing, and the National  
Transportation Safety Board has said crash witnesses gave possibly 
conflicting statements about his actions the night of the crash. 
</P>
<P>
	But Stokes has a long history of traffic citations in the 31  
years he has had an Illinois driver's license, including 
involvement in nine accidents before the train collision, state 
records show.

<HEADLINE> Fox-TV's Lyons Was 'Psycho' Player </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Steve Lyons always dreaded this time of year -- the uncertainty  
of whether he'd survive the final cut. 
</P>
<P>
	With the baseball season beginning Sunday, the former  
light-hitting utility player doesn't have to worry about being sent 
to the minors anymore. He's quickly become one of Fox's dependable 
sluggers. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons, who still can't fathom how he lasted nine years in the  
majors, is a rarity: An ex-pro athlete anchoring a national sports 
show. 
</P>
<P>
	His full-time gig with Chris Myers on Fox Sports Net airs  
weekdays, and he also works as the studio analyst for Fox's 
Saturday baseball broadcasts. 
</P>
<P>
	But unlike Ahmad Rashad, another ex-player who is the host of  
``NBA Inside Stuff'' and is friends with Michael Jordan, Lyons 
isn't afraid to take shots at his former colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a ton of former players out there who shy away from  
criticizing players,'' Lyons said. ``They don't want to ridicule 
the athletes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons knows all about being chastised back in his playing days.  
</P>
<P>
	Nicknamed ``Psycho'' for his reckless style of play and antics  
on and off the field, the career .252 hitter would often be found 
begging Boston reporters to interview him. 
</P>
<P>
	His career-highlight wasn't one of his 19 lifetime homers.  
Instead, it was when he pulled his pants down during a game after 
diving into first base. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons was released by the Red Sox after the 1993 season, and  
after soliciting every team in both leagues for employment -- 
admittedly more than once -- he took a job at a Phoenix-area golf 
course where his wife worked. 
</P>
<P>
	Not as a golf pro or in management. As the refreshment guy.  
</P>
<P>
	``I was making $3 and tips, plus I got to play golf for free,''  
Lyons said. ``I was the best-looking snack girl they ever had.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Finally coming to grips with the fact that his playing days were  
history, he redirected his lobbying for a job to radio and TV 
executives. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons got a couple of radio jobs in Chicago and Boston and  
worked briefly for ESPN2 as a features reporter before calling Fox 
executive producer Ed Goren four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``He called me when there were rumors of us getting a piece of  
the baseball coverage,'' Goren said. ``I shocked him when I told 
him that he was already on our list.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just like during his playing days when he once played all nine  
positions during one season, Lyons has proved versatile and 
entertaining. 
</P>
<P>
	He's been a studio analyst, game analyst and host of a weekly  
interview show. Now, he's a full-time anchor. 
</P>
<P>
	``This definitely makes me feel more successful than when I  
played,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *LEADER OF THE PACK?:* Billy Packer and Jim Nantz had their  
moments during the NCAA championship game, on target early with 
their prediction on how the Connecticut bench would have no 
difficulty matching up with the Duke reserves. 
</P>
<P>
	Packer also was ahead of the game when he questioned why Trajan  
Langdon would take the final shots when guarded by the nation's top 
defender, Ricky Moore. 
</P>
<P>
	But CBS' No. 1 team failed to criticize Duke coach Mike  
Krzyzewski's lack of adjustments during the game and didn't 
question why he kept freshman sensation Corey Maggette on the 
sidelines nearly the entire second half after he scored eight 
first-half points. 
</P>
<P>
	The top insight of the night came prior to the game from CBS  
host Clark Kellogg, who objected to Utah coach and guest analyst 
Rick Majerus' comment on Duke benefiting by a quicker pace. 
</P>
<P>
	``I disagree,'' Kellogg said. ``Pedal to the metal is the only  
way for UConn to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Give that man a coaching job. On second thought, fans need the  
intelligent, passionate Kellogg on TV. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though Majerus was off the mark on his prediction, CBS  
still hit the jackpot by bringing him in as Dean Smith's 
replacement. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Missouri Coach Stewart Might Resign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBIA, Mo. (AP) -- Is Norm Stewart retiring as coach at  
Missouri after a falling-out with athletic director Mike Alden? 
</P>
<P>
	No one at the university would confirm or deny published reports  
that Stewart, seventh among major college coaches with 731 
victories, is leaving the program after 32 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Alden scheduled a news conference this morning at the Hearnes  
Center in Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart, 64, and his lawyer spent Wednesday discussing a buyout  
of the last two years of Stewart's contract, several TV stations 
and newspapers reported. 
</P>
<P>
	KMOV-TV in St. Louis, WDAF-TV in Kansas City, The Kansas City  
Star and the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported that Stewart would 
retire. WDAF said that Stewart initiated a buyout of his contract, 
and that Duke assistant Quin Snyder was a leading candidate to 
replace Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
	But Snyder told the Star that he had not talked to anyone at  
Missouri about the job and would not be at today's news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great job,'' Snyder said Wednesday. ``But I've never  
talked to Mike Alden.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not having any comments. You need to talk to Mike Alden,''  
Stewart said Wednesday night as he left his office. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tomorrow's April Fools,''' Stewart jokingly added.  
</P>
<P>
	Reached at home later in the evening by the AP, Stewart again  
referred reporters to Alden. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart's lawyer, Steve Owen, also had no comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Stewart, who also coached six years at Northern Iowa, was  
634-333 at Missouri and 731-375 overall. He took Missouri to the 
NCAA tournament 16 times, twice advancing to the regional final. 
This season's team was 20-9, but lost in the first round of the 
NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Television reports in St. Louis and Columbia on Wednesday said  
some players threatened to transfer if Stewart returned next 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Four starters were to come back next year, though standout  
Albert White is considering skipping his senior year if he is 
drafted by an NBA team. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not immediately clear what prompted Stewart's decision,  
but several media reports hinted that he and Alden may have had a 
falling-out over White's situation. 
</P>
<P>
	Alden reportedly told Stewart, who attended the Final Four last  
weekend in St. Petersburg, Fla., to return to Columbia to talk 
about the future of the program rather than go to his vacation home 
in Palm Springs, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart apparently did not return to Columbia.  
</P>
<P>
	Word that Stewart would step down caught many Tigers fans by  
surprise. 
</P>
<P>
	Kyle Oelrichs, a junior at Missouri, said he heard the news  
Wednesday night on ESPN. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a suspicion that somebody is showing him the door,'' he  
said. ``It's going to be better for recruiting. He hasn't landed a 
lot of big recruits lately. I think there are a lot of people 
around who are glad to see him go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart, a native of Shelbyville, Mo., and a Missouri graduate,  
came to Columbia in 1968 to rebuild a program that had won only six 
of 49 games the previous two seasons. His teams had 17 20-victory 
seasons, topped by the 1989 club's 29-8 mark. The 1994 team that 
advanced to the regional final was 28-4. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, he's posted records of 20-9, 18-15, 16-17, 17-15 and  
20-9. This year's team shared second place in the Big 12. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart played basketball and baseball at Missouri. He led the  
Big Seven Conference in scoring with 24.1 points per game in 
1955-56. He spent one season with the NBA's St. Louis Hawks and a 
year in the Baltimore Orioles' minor league system. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart won a battle with colon cancer in 1989 and five years  
later began the Coaches vs. Cancer program. Individuals and 
corporations across the state pledge money for every 3-pointer made 
by Missouri, and in the first year of the program the Tigers broke 
the school record with 204. 
</P>
<P>
	Over 100 schools take part in the program.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think someday we should be able to raise 15 or 20 million  
dollars nationwide,'' said Syracuse coach Jim Boeheim, whose school 
also is a major contributor to the program. ``People will remember 
it began with the rough, gruff, obnoxious guy from Missouri.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One wealthy backer of Missouri's sports programs, Stan Kroenke  
of Columbia, said Wednesday night that he hadn't spoken to Stewart 
because the coach was recruiting his son, 18-year-old Josh Kroenke, 
to play for the Tigers. 
</P>
<P>
	But Kroenke told the AP, ``I've heard rumors Norm was thinking  
about stepping down, and his wife has joked about it. I think Norm 
has earned a break. It's a hugely competitive environment and if 
anybody's earned it, Norm has. 
</P>
<P>
	``Norm Stewart's legacy is clear: he's the man who has stood for  
Missouri basketball for years, and he has brought basketball to a 
different level at Missouri, and a level we can be proud of.''

<HEADLINE> Hitachi to Cut 6,500 Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Hitachi Ltd., Japan's largest machinery maker,  
plans to cut 6,500 workers by March 2000 as part of a major 
cost-cutting plan. 
</P>
<P>
	The labor cuts, to affect about 10 percent of Hitachi's  
67,000-member work force, will be achieved through attrition, an 
early retirement program, and the transfer of some 4,000 employees 
to a home electronics unit created Thursday as a spinoff of 
Hitachi's related division, said Hitachi spokesman Takeshi Okamoto 
on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Hitachi's new president Etsuhiko Shoyama said in a  
press conference that he aims to return to the company to the black 
this fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
	``My mission as president is to transform Hitachi into a high  
profit business,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, major trading company Marubeni Corp. announced on  
Thursday it would accelerate steps to improve its financial 
standing and business structure by cutting its work force by 900 to 
5,000 by next April. 
</P>
<P>
	The labor cuts are the latest a series of cutbacks for corporate  
Japan as companies struggle through the country's deepest-ever 
postwar recession and the region's economic crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Major job cuts were also recently announced by Mitsubishi  
Electric Corp., NEC Corp. and Sony Corp. -- three of Japan's 
electronics behemoths.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Religious leaders are divided on the conflict in  
Kosovo, where NATO forces are trying to stem a Serbian offensive 
against Kosovo's ethnic Albanian majority. 
</P>
<P>
	Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, spiritual leader of the  
Orthodox, including the Serbs, issued the statement: ``I ... 
fervently appeal from the tormented depths of my heart to all world 
leaders ... that they cease fire immediately and permanently.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pope John Paul II told European leaders: ``In response to  
violence, another violence is never a prospective way out of a 
crisis.'' He has appealed to all sides to return to bargaining. 
</P>
<P>
	Bishop Joseph A. Fiorenza, president of the National Conference  
of Catholic Bishops, called NATO's humanitarian objective 
legitimate. But he added, ``What is less clear are the consequences 
of the use of force.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among other comments:  
</P>
<P>
	--The Islamic Society of North America: ``It was indeed time that  
such a response was given to (Yugoslav President Slobodan) 
Milosevic and his forces ... ISNA only wishes that the United 
States and NATO should have stopped Milosevic before he butchered 
hundreds of thousands.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--The Rev. Thom White Wolf Fassett, general secretary of the  
United Methodist Board of Church and Society: ``Although U.S. 
President Clinton says peace is the final goal of these air 
strikes, we question a policy that brings further suffering on 
thousands of innocent people in Kosovo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--President Bruce M. Ramer and Executive Director David A. Harris  
of the American Jewish Committee: ``Diplomacy without credible 
military backing has never been persuasive for Milosevic. ... The 
fruitless end of the latest (diplomatic) mission could only have 
one result -- the NATO decision to commence air strikes.'' 
</P>
<P>

 *Baptists reopen seminary in Liberia    	
</P>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- After an extended shutdown during a  
ruinous civil war, Liberia Baptist Theological Seminary in Monrovia 
has been reopened with 95 students, according to the Southern 
Baptist Convention press service. 
</P>
<P>
	The campus was closed when the war began in 1990. Peacekeeping  
troops from Ghana lived there and protected it from looters. The 
school offered classes at a temporary location between 1993 and 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Liberia and China are the oldest mission fields of America's  
Southern Baptist Convention, which entered both nations in 1846. 
The Liberia mission resumed work in 1960 after a hiatus of many 
decades. A Baptist Training Center opened in 1969 and evolved into 
the seminary in 1976. In 1983 the Liberia school became the first 
seminary endorsed by the Accrediting Council for Theological 
Education in Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	The seminary president, Lincoln Brownell Jr., is a Liberian who  
graduated from Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, 
Ky.

 *Schools nix Tibetan monks' visits    	
</P>
<P>
	SLIPPERY ROCK, Pa. (AP) -- A scheduled visit by Tibetan monks to  
an elementary school was canceled after the school board objected. 
</P>
<P>
	The Slippery Rock School District board also canceled a high  
school field trip to Slippery Rock University where the monks 
visited for three days. 
</P>
<P>
	Board member Joan Courtney said laws that prevent promoting  
religion in public school classrooms prompted the board's decision. 
She said Buddhist principles shouldn't be taught when Christian 
principles are prohibited. 
</P>
<P>
	Tashi Jamyangling, a translator for the monks who coordinated  
their trip, said the tour was intended to expose others to their 
culture and raise funds for their monastery in India. However, he 
said the monks would respect the board's position. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacki Muller, assistant to Slippery Rock University President G.  
Warren Smith, said the elementary school visit and high school 
field trip were intended to give students a glimpse of another 
culture. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was one way of reaching out to the community,'' she said.  
``We thought it was in keeping with our mission, and we still do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Linda Desmond, a Baptist and parent of a third-grader said:  
``If my God can't be in that school, I don't want anybody's God in 
that school.''

 *University, Baptists at odds over homosexual clause    	
</P>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- A new University of Richmond policy on  
homosexuals appears to put the school at odds with the state 
Baptist association, which founded the school 169 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The clause, approved by trustees in March, bars discrimination  
against gays and lesbians in student admissions and staff hiring 
and promotion. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the Baptist General Association of Virginia sent  
member churches a policy statement ``affirming the biblical 
teaching that homosexual behavior is sinful and unacceptable to 
Christians,'' though it also advocated ``Christ-like compassion for 
homosexual persons.'' The national Southern Baptist Convention 
holds a similar view. 
</P>
<P>
	The executive director of the association called the university  
decision disappointing, and two trustees nominated by the 
association said they opposed the change. 
</P>
<P>
	The university received a $50 million gift in 1969 that was  
contingent on looser ties with the association, whose main support 
today is in the form of $230,000 in scholarships for Baptist 
students. Four years ago the university quit the Association of 
Southern Baptist Colleges and Schools. 
</P>
<P>
	University spokesmen said the homosexual policy codifies  
long-standing practice and brings the school in line with other 
American campuses.

<HEADLINE> CBS Buying King World for $2.5B </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- CBS Corp. is buying King World Productions Inc.,  
television's biggest program syndicator distributing shows like 
``Jeopardy'' and ``The Oprah Winfrey Show,'' for about $2.5 billion 
in stock. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal announced today would greatly expand CBS's position in  
the business of selling programs to TV stations and complement its 
other broadcasting activities led by its ownership of the CBS 
television network. 
</P>
<P>
	King World has been a frequent subject of takeover speculation,  
but the rumors about a deal with CBS have intensified in recent 
days. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have considered many strategic options over the last  
several years and this merger is by far the most attractive,'' said 
Roger King, chairman of King World. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the deal, King and his brother Michael, who is vice  
chairman of the syndication company, would continue in their 
current positions and report to the head of the CBS Television 
division, Leslie Moonves. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS's existing syndication division, Eyemark Entertainment,  
would operate independently of King World. It sells shows like 
``Martha Stewart Living'' to TV stations. 
</P>
<P>
	The CBS television network has hits like ``Sixty Minutes'' and  
``Everybody Loves Raymond.'' CBS also owns 14 television stations 
and a cable TV division with four music and sports networks and a 
controlling interest in a company that owns 160 radio stations and 
an outdoor advertising business. 
</P>
<P>
	Mel Karmazin, president and chief executive of CBS, said King  
World will over time supply programming for the CBS TV stations. 
</P>
<P>
	But that could take time as King World currently has deals to  
supply shows for non-CBS television stations. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal has been approved by the boards of both companies, and  
is subject to approval by King World shareholders and federal 
regulators. Members of the King family have pledged to vote their 
18 percent stake in the company for the deal, which is expected to 
be completed in mid-1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Under terms of the offer, CBS would pay 0.81 shares of CBS stock  
for each share of King World stock. At Wednesday's closing price, 
that would represent an 8.2 percent premium for King World 
shareholders. But it would be a 14.2 percent premium over King 
World's stock price a week ago before the latest takeover 
speculation heated up. 
</P>
<P>
	In late morning trading today, King World shares rose 25 cents,  
or 0.8 percent, to $30.81 1/4 on the New York Stock Exchange. CBS 
shares fell $1.37 1/2 or 3.4 percent to $39.43 3/4, also on the NYSE.

<HEADLINE> NFL's Panthers Cut Receiver Carrier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Mark Carrier, the Carolina Panthers'  
career leader in receptions, was released Thursday, a casualty of 
advancing age and the improvement of a young group of wide 
receivers. 
</P>
<P>
	Carrier, 33, had 176 receptions for 2,547 yards with the  
Panthers, but only 19 for 301 yards last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mark's a player who has obviously meant a lot to the Carolina  
Panthers during the team's first four seasons,'' coach George 
Seifert said. ``Mark will always be held in high esteem by everyone 
in the Panthers organization, but we feel that we have a good group 
of young receivers who need to develop.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That group is headed by Muhsin Muhammad, a second-round draft  
pick in 1996, and Rae Carruth, the Panthers' top selection in the 
1997 draft. Both have shown promise early in their NFL careers when 
not sidelined by injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	The Panthers, who lost free-agent wide receiver Raghib Ismail to  
the Dallas Cowboys last week, also are pleased with the progress of 
two wideouts they drafted last year. Donald Hayes, a fourth-round 
selection, and Jim Turner, a seventh-round pick, both were 
sidelined by injuries for extended periods in 1998 but looked solid 
when healthy. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Thursday, the Panthers re-signed unrestricted free-agent  
cornerback Steve Lofton, who had been claimed off waivers from New 
England midway through the 1998 season and started seven games for 
Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	The Panthers also waived linebacker Ray Farmer, who failed a  
physical.

<HEADLINE> America Online Lays Off 850 Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DULLES, Va. (AP) -- America Online Inc. has made good on a  
promise to do some post-merger trimming, firing a combined 850 
workers from its staff and that of recently acquired Netscape Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	The giant Internet service provider made the cuts Wednesday.  
About half came from Dulles-based AOL's 10,000-person staff, the 
others from Netscape's 2,500-person work force, mostly in its 
Mountain View, Calif., headquarters, AOL officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL had announced last week that it was planning to cut 20  
percent of Netscape's staff and some of its own overlapping workers 
as it absorbed the pioneering software maker in a $10 billion 
acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
	Early Wednesday morning, managers met face-to-face with those  
given pink slips. The terminations were effective immediately, and 
most dismissed employees left the building soon after they were 
notified. 
</P>
<P>
	``As we integrated Netscape, we took a hard look at how best to  
organize ourselves for future growth,'' AOL spokesman Jim Whitney 
said. ``The new structure is streamlined and will allow us to move 
very quickly to seize new opportunities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though the layoff plan had been announced in advance, there was  
one surprise: contrary to analysts' expectations, several of AOL's 
high-level employees lost their jobs. Six AOL vice presidents, all 
in the area of interactive services and AOL technologies, were let 
go, The Washington Post reported. There are about 100 AOL vice 
presidents. 
</P>
<P>
	Otherwise, the fired AOL employees were mostly programmers or  
content developers, the Post reported. On the Netscape side, the 
terminations affected mostly employees in administrative jobs 
rather than engineering or other technical positions. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said the laid-off workers have little to fear. Because  
technology workers are in such high demand, they are likely to get 
good offers from competing firms and to leave with stock-rich 
benefit packages. In addition, AOL officials said, all the laid-off 
employees received a minimum of three months' salary and health 
benefits, plus an offer of help finding new employment. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't shed any crocodile tears for these people,'' said Ulric  
Weil, an analyst with Friedman, Billings, Ramsey Group Inc. ``They 
will be snapped up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	AOL is the world's largest online service and Internet access  
provider with 16 million subscribers. Netscape's founders created 
the first widely used software for finding and retrieving 
information off the Internet.

<HEADLINE> First Lady Boosts Fund-Raiser </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton, eyeing a Senate race  
in New York, has agreed to speak at a fund-raising event for the 
congresswoman waiting in the wings if the first lady doesn't run. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're pleased that while she's making up her mind, she is  
clearly being helpful to us, which is very important,'' said Howard 
Wolfson, a spokesman for Rep. Nita Lowey, D-N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	While political ears perked up Thursday at word of the May 24  
event, aides to the first lady have said she planned to help Lowey 
raise money so the six-term congresswoman wouldn't be left in the 
lurch if Mrs. Clinton decides not to run. 
</P>
<P>
	Wolfson said the $1,000-a-person dinner would raise upwards of  
$500,000 for the congresswoman. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no immediate comment from the first lady, who was  
returning to Washington on Thursday with daughter Chelsea after a 
12-day trip to North Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate race, for the seat being vacated by Democrat Daniel  
Patrick Moynihan, could pit Mrs. Clinton against Rudolph Giuliani, 
the Republican mayor of New York City. 
</P>
<P>
	There was fresh evidence Thursday that the initial frenzy over  
Mrs. Clinton's possible candidacy has subsided. 
</P>
<P>
	A statewide poll conducted at Siena College had Mrs. Clinton  
favored by 45 percent of New Yorkers questioned to 41 percent for 
Giuliani, a statistical dead heat given the poll's margin of error 
of 4.5 percentage points. The telephone poll of 469 adults was 
conducted March 3-24. 
</P>
<P>
	Other recent polls have also shown such a race to be tight.

<HEADLINE> Survey: More Banks Charge for ATMs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- More than 90 percent of banks charge people to  
use their ATM machines if they aren't customers of the bank, up 
from 71 percent a year ago, according to a new survey. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Public Interest Research Group was releasing the survey  
today, the third anniversary of the decision by the two largest 
automated teller networks -- owned by Visa and MasterCard -- to allow 
banks and other ATM operators to impose surcharges. 
</P>
<P>
	The surcharges, which are paid to the bank operating the  
automated teller machine, come on top of any fees customers pay to 
their own banks when they use another bank's ATM. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's bankers say the surcharges are outweighed by the  
24-hour convenience for customers and are needed to make the 
machines profitable. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today consumers have more choices than ever to get cash when  
and where they want it,'' Donald Ogilvie, executive vice president 
of the American Bankers Association, said today. He said the 
surcharges ``have led to an explosion of new ATMs in places that 
previously couldn't support them due to low usage, such as 
theaters, hospitals and neighborhood markets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since January, giants Citibank and Chase Manhattan Bank began  
imposing ATM surcharges for customers of other banks, after 
resisting the fees for several years. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey by PIRG covered 336 banks and 31 credit unions in 23  
states and the District of Columbia, out of some 9,000 institutions 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey, conducted by the consumer group each year, charts a  
dramatic rise in the frequency of ATM surcharges. It found that 93 
percent of banks charged consumers for using another bank's machine 
in March, up from 71 percent a year ago and 45 percent in March 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``Consumers should not be charged twice to use the ATM only  
once,'' said Ed Mierzwinski, PIRG's consumer program director. 
``The double-dipping ATM surcharge is an outrageous example of ... 
gouging by banks. Banks raise fees, invent new fees and make it 
harder for consumers to avoid fees.'' 
</P>
<P>
	ATM surcharges continue to increase, the new survey found. The  
most common fee is $1.50, up from $1 a year ago. They range from 50 
cents to $2.50, up from 25 cents to $2.50. 
</P>
<P>
	The average surcharge found in the survey is $1.37, up from  
$1.23 a year ago. They averaged $1.42 for big banks (those among 
the nation's 300 largest), $1.30 for small banks and 98 cents for 
credit unions. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1997 report by congressional investigators also found  
increases in the surcharge amounts and in the frequency of 
surcharges. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department's Antitrust Division last year started  
looking into whether the nation's largest ATM networks are 
illegally preventing small banks from eliminating the double 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
	A proposed ban on ATM surcharges was rejected a few weeks ago by  
the House Banking Committee, which overwhelmingly approved instead 
a measure that would require ATM surcharges to be clearly disclosed 
at the teller machines. 
</P>
<P>
	Connecticut and Iowa have prohibited the surcharges by order of  
their banking commissioners. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Bankers Association says it believes the market  
should determine ATM fees and the government should stay out of the 
matter. 
</P>
<P>
	The bankers' group maintains that the rapid growth in ATMs in  
recent years was made possible by the surcharges, which go toward 
paying rent, security costs and other expenses for the machines. 
</P>
<P>
	Most banks offer unlimited free ATM use for their own customers,  
the bankers' group notes. 
</P>
<P>
	The PIRG survey also found:  
</P>
<P>
	--Banks are earning an estimated $2.1 billion a year from ATM  
surcharges. 
</P>
<P>
	--Nearly 25 percent of surcharging ATMs surveyed either had no  
sign posted on the machine warning of the fee or a sign that didn't 
disclose the correct amount. In those cases, consumers have to wait 
until they log in and see a message on the computer screen 
disclosing the surcharge, but they get a chance to terminate the 
transaction if they don't want to be charged. 
</P>
<P>
	The group recommends:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Use your own bank's ATM when possible, otherwise use machines  
that don't impose surcharges. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Join a credit union or open accounts at small or community  
banks.

<HEADLINE> Schools Get Violence-Curb Grants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Seeking to stop youth violence in its earliest  
stages, three federal agencies are giving schools the chance to 
compete for money for school-based anti-violence programs, mental 
health services and police officers. 
</P>
<P>
	Up to $180 million will be shared by 50 winning communities  
nationwide. The departments of Education, Justice and Health and 
Human Services are pooling money granted by Congress, agency 
officials said Thursday. Applications for the Safe Schools/Healthy 
Students program are due June 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Communities will be chosen based on how well they coordinate  
various services to students affected by violence, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the grants enable us to put all of our efforts under one  
umbrella, then this is something we'd definitely go after,'' said 
George Raiss, lobbyist for the 37,000-student Norfolk, Va., school 
district. 
</P>
<P>
	The money includes $80 million from the Justice Department's  
program to hire community police officers, but officials downplayed 
that part of the overall plan to stop school violence. 
</P>
<P>
	``Police chiefs and officers tell me ... we've got to do more in  
terms of prevention,'' said Attorney General Janet Reno, adding the 
medical community must address the mental health issues that bring 
about some violence. 
</P>
<P>
	In Anaheim, Calif., police officers work in the schools to build  
a rapport with students, so if they get into trouble with the law, 
they deal with officers they know and trust. But once a child is in 
trouble, the 30,000-student district has trouble finding affordable 
mental health counselors. 
</P>
<P>
	``They don't do a lot of volunteer work,'' said Bob Montenegro,  
safe schools coordinator for the Anaheim Union High School 
District, which covers Anaheim, Buena Park and other cities. 
</P>
<P>
	The grants idea comes out of last fall's White House conference  
on school safety, where President Clinton called for a stronger 
federal role in violence prevention. After highly publicized 
shootings in the 1997-98 school year in towns such as West Paducah, 
Ky., Jonesboro, Ark., and Springfield, Ore., schools were forced to 
examine how to guarantee children's safety and address public 
thinking that deadly youth violence is on the rise. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those tragic incidences ... really focused the nation on  
school violence,'' said Education Secretary Richard W. Riley, 
adding that the administration hopes Congress will approve $120 
million more for the grants over the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
	About 10 percent of the nation's public schools reported violent  
crimes in the 1996-97 school year. Most incidents were concentrated 
in larger and urban districts, but officials said the grants would 
go to communities of all sizes.

<HEADLINE> Japan Unit To Handle Bad Bank Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan launched a new institution on Thursday to  
recover banks' bad loans, in what could be an important step toward 
repairing its battered financial system. 
</P>
<P>
	The new government-backed body, the Resolution and Collection  
Corp., was modeled after the Resolution Trust Corp. of the United 
States, which helped clean up the savings and loan fiasco of the 
1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	The RCC will buy problem loans from banks and then try to sell  
the collateral -- mostly land -- to recover as much money as 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
	That may sound simple, but since the loans went bad -- many  
nearly a decade ago -- banks have been mostly unable to sell the 
collateral because of a moribund real estate market. 
</P>
<P>
	And while the banks have built up reserves against their  
expected losses on those loans, most still hold the collateral, 
making them vulnerable to further declines in property prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Kohei Nakabo, president of the RCC, said it will work to finally  
sell off the collateral so banks can be rid of their bad-loan 
problems for good. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not enough for banks to just build reserves against  
loans,'' he said in his inaugural press conference. ``Our country's 
financial system cannot recover unless the loans are actually 
removed from the balance sheet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nakabo said that he hopes to buy as many problem loans from  
healthy banks as possible. 
</P>
<P>
	But the process may not go so smoothly. For one thing, many  
healthy banks are reluctant to sell their problem loans to the body 
because they worry that they might still be held responsible for 
the loans if the RCC failed to collect. 
</P>
<P>
	Another problem is that real estate prices are still falling,  
which may make it difficult for the RCC to sell the collateral. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's land prices fell for the eighth consecutive year in  
1998, dropping an average of 4.6 percent, compared to 2.4 percent 
the previous year.

<HEADLINE> Coach Harrick Spurns Georgia for RI </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATHENS, Ga. (AP) -- Jim Harrick decided Thursday to return Rhode  
Island, a day after he officially accepted the Georgia head 
coaching job. 
</P>
<P>
	Harrick called Georgia president Michael F. Adams, a close  
friend, and said that he had a change of heart. Associate athletic 
director Dick Bestwick and Adams met with Harrick for an hour 
trying to talk him out of returning to Rhode Island, but he told 
them his decision was final. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're disappointed in Coach Harrick's decision,'' Georgia  
athletic director Vince Dooley said. ``However, the most important 
thing is for him to have total peace of mind and commitment to 
whatever decision he would make.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Adams said he told Harrick that returning to Rhode Island would  
be a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
	``However, we wanted a coach who was committed to this  
institution and the future of our basketball program,'' he said. 
``If he had doubts, certainly remaining at Rhode Island would be 
the correct choice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 60-year-old Harrick was hired to replace Ron Jirsa, fired  
after going went 35-30 in two seasons since taking over for Tubby 
Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	Harrick guided UCLA to the 1995 national championship but was  
fired the following year for his involvement with an illegal 
recruiting dinner. 
</P>
<P>
	He paid the tab and allegedly lied to cover up that more players  
were at the dinner than allowed by NCAA rules. After sitting out 
the 1996-97 season, he spent the past two years at Rhode Island, 
leading the Rams to the NCAA tournament both seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	He has a record of 403-182 in 19 years as coach at Pepperdine,  
UCLA and Rhode Island. His teams qualified for the NCAA tournament 
14 times, including a current streak of 10 in a row. 
</P>
<P>
	Harrick would have made $550,000 per year in Georgia, plus  
$100,000 per year if he completed his four-year contract. At Rhode 
Island, he made about $350,000 last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Harrick had hesitated before accepting the Georgia job because  
the state's anti-nepotism prevented him from hiring his son, Jim 
Jr., as an assistant. But his son talked him into taking the 
Bulldog job. 
</P>
<P>
	Adams said Georgia would resume its search for a coach, adding  
that a strong list of candidates existed. 
</P>
<P>
	Several coaches on Georgia's list are no longer available.  
Delaware coach Mike Brey removed himself from consideration and 
former St. John's coach Fran Fraschilla took the New Mexico job. 
</P>
<P>
	Another candidate was Appalachian State's Buzz Peterson, who was  
endorsed by Dean Smith and Michael Jordan, his former coach and 
teammate, respectively, at North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second time in three years that a coach embarrassed  
Georgia by changing his mind. In December 1995, Glen Mason was 
hired from Kansas to coach the Bulldogs football team but changed 
his mind days later and returned to the Jayhawks. 
</P>
<P>
	Dooley then hired Marshall coach Jim Donnan, who has led the  
Bulldogs to consecutive top 15 seasons. Mason left Kansas the 
following year after a 4-7 finish. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1993, Georgia Tech coach basketball coach Bobby Cremins  
accepted the job at his alma mater, South Carolina. A week later, 
he announced that he would remain at Georgia Tech.

<HEADLINE> Mortgage Rates Stay Below 7 percent / National Mortgage Survey  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The average interest rate on 30-year  
fixed-rate mortgages held steady at just below 7 percent this week. 
</P>
<P>
	The average was 6.98 percent, the same as last week, Freddie  
Mac, the mortgage company said Thursday. That's down from a 
10-month high of 7.11 percent three weeks earlier but nearly a 
quarter percentage point higher than the 6.74 percent average at 
the end of January. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifteen-year mortgages, a popular option for refinancing,  
averaged 6.58 percent this week, down from 6.61 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	On one-year adjustable-rate mortgages, lenders were asking an  
average initial rate of 5.65 percent, down from 5.69 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The rates do not include add-on fees known as points, which  
averaged just under 1 percent of the loan amount for all three 
types of mortgages.

<HEADLINE> Schilling Ready To Pitch for Phils </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEARWATER, Fla. (AP) -- Curt Schilling can't wait for the trade  
deadline, but not for the reason you might think. 
</P>
<P>
	Schilling, who made it to his last spring training start  
Wednesday without getting traded, hopes the Philadelphia Phillies 
are ready to do some wheeling and dealing in July. 
</P>
<P>
	Just not the kind that involves him.  
</P>
<P>
	``A couple of clubs are a trade away or an injury away from  
being good or bad,'' said Schilling, who struck out seven and 
looked strong in his last tuneup before opening day. ``We'll just 
try to compete, win more than we lose and get better as the season 
goes. Who knows? Maybe in July, something happens and we go out and 
get a player who puts us in the mix.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After getting plenty of run support in a 10-4 victory over the  
Cincinnati Reds, it was no wonder Schilling was in an optimistic 
mood. A frequent subject of trade rumors, Schilling said he 
believes this is the second-best Phillies team he's played for -- 
the other being the 1993 team that lost to Toronto in the World 
Series. 
</P>
<P>
	Some baseball observers believe that the Phillies might finally  
have to cave in to the crush of trade offers for Schilling if 
they're out of the NL playoff race when the summer trade deadline 
approaches. Schilling isn't so sure it will come to that. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to score more runs. I don't think there's any  
question about that,'' Schilling said. ``We're going to be a good 
defensive club. I think the same question since '93 is going to be 
the same one this year: How good is our starting pitching going to 
be?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Every fifth day, it should be marvelous. Behind Schilling, the  
Phillies are counting on four relatively unproven starters to 
bridge the gap. 
</P>
<P>
	Chad Ogea, who never stayed in the majors for a full season  
before the Indians traded him, is the No. 2 starter. Carlton 
Loewer, Paul Byrd and Paul Spoljaric finish out the rotation. 
</P>
<P>
	Schilling, coming off consecutive seasons with 300 or more  
strikeouts, allowed three runs and seven hits in six innings and 
threw 108 pitches. He walked one and gave up a line-drive homer by 
Greg Vaughn in the third. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm healthy. My arm feels good,'' Schilling said. ``The  
slider's better than it's ever been. The curveball's better. The 
split's not where it has to be. What irked me was, I was getting 
ahead in the count, I thought I was making good pitches and I 
wasn't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schilling is already jacked up about his opening day in Atlanta  
against defending NL Cy Young award winner Tom Glavine. Manager 
Terry Francona said Schilling looks ready to throw about 120 
pitches in the opener. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he's very, very strong,'' Phillies manager Terry  
Francona said. 
</P>
<P>
	He allowed four straight hits in the first inning after striking  
out leadoff batter Mike Cameron. Barry Larkin's double was followed 
by singles from Sean Casey, Vaughn and Dmitri Young. Schilling was 
ahead in the count or even on each batter. 
</P>
<P>
	The hits by Casey and Young each drove in a run, and Schilling  
got out of the inning on Brian Johnson's double-play grounder. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd venture to guess that on all seven of my hits I was ahead  
with one strike or ahead with two,'' Schilling said. ``... What 
irked me was, I was getting ahead in the count, I thought I was 
making good pitches and I wasn't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schilling struck out the side and walked one in the fourth and  
got out of a first-and-third, one-out jam in the fifth. Vaughn 
flied to the wall in center, and Young struck out looking. 
</P>
<P>
	Schilling struck out swinging at a curveball from Brett Tomko in  
the fifth, taking exception to Tomko's pitch selection. Schilling 
glared at Tomko as the two walked back to the dugout, but didn't 
get to face him. Schilling retired the side in order in the sixth, 
blowing away Pokey Reese for his seventh strikeout with Tomko 
waiting on deck. 
</P>
<P>
	``Actually, I was laughing,'' Schilling said. ``Did you see the  
swing? You can hurt yourself swinging like that. Every time I think 
I'm an athlete, I change my mind when I take a swing like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's OK, Curt. It's usually the other way around.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Somewhat Higher; Dow Up 13.88 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rose today but were well off their  
earlier highs as reports of continuing economic strength deepened 
the market's concerns about inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	At noon on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was up  
13.88 at 9,800.04. The blue-chip index rose nearly 54 points in 
early trading before falling back. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were mixed at midday. The Standard &AMP;  
Poor's 500 index was up 3.44 at 1,289.81, and the Nasdaq composite 
index was up 14.90 at 2,476.30. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks advanced on a spate of merger news.  
</P>
<P>
	Yahoo! announced a $5.7 billion planned purchase of  
Broadcast.com, sending Yahoo! shares up 7 7/16 at 175 13/16, while 
Broadcast.com rose 10 5/16 at 128 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	BP Amoco announced plans to buy Atlantic Richfield for $26.6  
billion, a deal that would create the world's second-largest oil 
company. And CBS said it would pay $2.5 billion for King World 
Productions, the largest TV-syndication company. 
</P>
<P>
	But the gains evaporated after the National Association of  
Purchasing Management reported its monthly index of business 
activity rose to 54.3 percent last month, an increase of 1.9 
percentage points from its February level. 
</P>
<P>
	In another sign of economic vigor, the Commerce Department  
reported construction spending jumped a much-stronger-than-expected 
2.2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The department also reported personal income increased a  
seasonally adjusted 0.5 percent in February after a 0.6 percent 
gain in January. Consumer spending, meanwhile, jumped 0.7 percent 
after a 0.4 percent rise the previous month. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond prices fell on the inflation concerns. The yield on the  
30-year Treasury rose to 5.68 percent from 5.62 late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were strong right at the opening, and then the purchasing  
managers report and construction spending were stronger than 
expected, and that hit bonds, and then stocks went over,'' said 
Alfred E. Goldman, chief market strategist, A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons 
Inc. in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	Many investors in both the stock and bond markets were trading  
carefully ahead of the long holiday weekend. Financial markets will 
be closed Friday in observance of Good Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Many are nervous about the intensifying U.S. military presence  
in Yugoslavia and worry that the situation could escalate over the 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was up down 0.55 at 603.04, and the  
American Stock Exchange composite index was down 0.98 at 709.32. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a narrow margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 332.92 million 
shares, down from 407.84 million shares on Wednesday.

<HEADLINE>  L.A.'s Spring Future Is Unsure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VERO BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- The Los Angeles Dodgers have completed  
their 51st year of spring training in Vero Beach. It might have 
been their last. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dodgers, who first set up camp in this quiet coastal city in  
1948 -- 10 years before they moved from Brooklyn to Los Angeles -- 
are considering a move to Fort McDowell, Ariz., near Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fort McDowell Indian Community has offered to build the  
Dodgers a 12,500-seat stadium, five or six practice fields and 
housing if the team decides to leave Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	The team, which headed home to Los Angeles on Wednesday, is  
expected to make a decision in about a month. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just being here this year I got a taste of what it feels like  
to be at Dodgertown, and I've always admired playing here,'' said 
left fielder Gary Sheffield, traded to the Dodgers last May. ``You 
have to feel for the people here, and you want to give them what 
they want, but you also have to look at the other side. Hopefully 
both sides can work it out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	City and county officials in Vero Beach have been negotiating  
with the Dodgers for about a year on how to keep the team at their 
current training site, generally considered the most traditional 
and fan-friendly in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	A Florida Senate bill introduced last week would provide $7.5  
million the next two years to renovate Dodgertown and help keep the 
team in Vero Beach. 
</P>
<P>
	Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone is optimistic that the team  
will stay in Florida, though he said the site needs upgrading to 
match Fort McDowell's offer. 
</P>
<P>
	``People call me the eternal optimist, but I've leaving some  
stuff behind,'' Malone said Wednesday as he packed up his 
Dodgertown office. ``I'm hoping it will be here when I get back. 
I'm not looking at it as though this is my last time here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A crowd of 4,717 fans, about 700 below this spring's average,  
watched the Houston Astros beat the Dodgers 6-4 in Wednesday's 
finale at Holman Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Bud Holman, a local businessman, who invited the Dodgers to set  
up camp in Vero Beach in 1948 after it was decided the city needed 
a tenant to occupy the former World War II naval air station. 
</P>
<P>
	The last game didn't feature any special ceremonies, but about  
250 fans attended a postgame sendoff sponsored by a local committee 
hoping to keep the Dodgers in Vero Beach. 
</P>
<P>
	Sonny Jones, a middle-aged fan who grew up in Vero Beach,  
recalled attending games with his brother as a youngster after 
school. 
</P>
<P>
	``It'll be sad if they go,'' Jones said. ``I understand where  
they're coming from. Economics is economics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe so, but Ed Niedziela, a resident of nearby Sebastian, said  
he felt frustrated ``because it's just a financial thing, and the 
tradition isn't even a concern.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Bagwell and Carl Everett hit back-to-back solo homers with  
two outs in the first off Dodgers ace Kevin Brown, and Bagwell hit 
another solo shot off Brown in the fourth when the Astros scored 
three times to take a 5-4 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown, in his final appearance before he faces the Arizona  
Diamondbacks next Monday in the season-opener, allowed five runs, 
four earned, on seven hits in five innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Young and Sheffield homered for the Dodgers.  
</P>
<P>
	Todd Hundley, who missed most of last season after undergoing  
reconstructive surgery on his right elbow late in 1997, caught 
back-to-back games for the first time all spring and said he felt 
fine despite going 0-for-3 at the plate. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything was good,'' Hundley said. ``This was something we  
wanted to get accomplished to check everything out, and things 
worked out fine.''

<HEADLINE> Body-Part Replacement Studied </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In what may be a major step toward learning  
how to grow replacement body parts, researchers in Baltimore have 
isolated from adult bone marrow a master cell that can be induced 
to grow bone or cartilage. 
</P>
<P>
	A study published today in the journal Science reports that  
researchers at Osiris Therapeutics extracted a single mesenchymal 
stem cell from bone marrow and then grew it into a colony of more 
than a million cells that could be directed to produce either bone, 
cartilage or fat. 
</P>
<P>
	If the technique proves successful, researchers predict that  
precursor cells for bone could be used to replace tissue lost to 
cancer, osteoporosis, injury or dental disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts said the study is an important achievement for the new  
and rapidly expanding field of stem cell research. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact that they can (isolate) a precursor cell like that,  
and direct it to produce specific cell types, is quite an 
advance,'' said Dr. James A. Thomson of the University of 
Wisconsin, a noted pioneer in stem cell research. ``It may be that 
such cells can eventually be used for therapy and that would be 
quite exciting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The study using adult stem cells is important also because it  
avoids the controversy of using stem cells from embryos, said Dr. 
Mark F. Pittenger, who led the team of Osiris researchers. 
</P>
<P>
	Stem cells are the body's building blocks. Some, such as  
pluripotent stem cells, come only from embryos and their use in 
research is opposed by many people. 
</P>
<P>
	Other stem cells, such as the mesenchymal cells used by Osiris,  
are produced in adults. 
</P>
<P>
	But only the pluripotent stem cells from embryos are thought to  
be capable of growing into any tissue in the body. The mesenchymal 
stem cells are the parent lines for bone, cartilage, fat, tendon 
and muscle. 
</P>
<P>
	The Osiris work helps move stem cell research from the  
laboratory toward the clinic, said Dr. David J. Anderson, a Howard 
Hughes Medical Institute stem cell researcher at the California 
Institute of Technology. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you want to use stem cells to replace damaged tissue, you  
have to first know how to differentiate those cells in the lab dish 
before you put them into a patient,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In their work, Osiris researchers led by Pittenger grew a single  
mesenchymal stem cell through more than 20 generations to create 
about a million cells. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers then altered the culture medium and added  
proteins that caused the specimens to grow into cell families, or 
lineages, that would produce bone, tendon or fat, Pittenger said. 
Other work under way may lead to producing muscle cell lines. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've arrived at conditions that allow us a very strong degree  
of control,'' said Pittenger. ``When we direct these cells to the 
(cartilage) lineage, almost all of the cells grow to that 
lineage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That means it's very likely that researchers will eventually be  
able to inject specific types of cells into patients, which then 
would grow into replacement bone, tendon or muscle, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Laboratory research on animals is already underway and human  
studies may be possible in three years, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Research in rabbits and dogs already has shown that gaps in leg  
bone caused by surgery, such as for cancer, can be filled in with 
tissue grown in the body from stem cells. 
</P>
<P>
	Animal studies also are underway to determine if stem cells  
injected into the heart can replace scar tissue caused by heart 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress has banned federal financing of research using human  
embryos, and some lawmakers oppose a National Institutes of Health 
plan to possibly pay for embryonic stem cell research. 
</P>
<P>
	But Thomson, one of the first to isolate stem cells from human  
embryos, said that although researchers have proven that some types 
of stem cells can be obtained from adults, there is still a 
scientific need for embryonic stem cell research. 
</P>
<P>
	There are no known adult stem cells for some critical organs,  
such as kidney, heart and lung, he noted. If replacements are to be 
grown for these parts, Thomson said, it would require embryonic 
stem cell research.

<HEADLINE> Survey: More Banks Charge for ATMs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After resisting for years, giants Citibank and  
Chase Manhattan Bank started charging people in January to use 
their ATM machines if they are not customers. 
</P>
<P>
	That helped push the ranks of banks nationwide that impose ATM  
surcharges to more than 90 percent from 71 percent a year ago, 
according to a new survey by U.S. Public Interest Research Group. 
</P>
<P>
	The consumer group released the survey on Thursday, the third  
anniversary of the decision by the two largest automated teller 
networks -- owned by Visa and MasterCard -- to allow banks and other 
ATM operators to impose the second charges. 
</P>
<P>
	The surcharges, which are paid to the bank operating the  
automated teller machine, come on top of any fees customers pay to 
their own banks when they use another bank's ATM. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey, conducted by the group each year, charts a dramatic  
rise in the frequency of ATM surcharges. It found that 93 percent 
of banks charged consumers for using another bank's machine in 
March, up from 71 percent a year ago and 45 percent in March 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``Consumers should not be charged twice to use the ATM only  
once,'' said Ed Mierzwinski, PIRG's consumer program director. 
``The double-dipping ATM surcharge is an outrageous example of ... 
gouging by banks. Banks raise fees, invent new fees and make it 
harder for consumers to avoid fees.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's bankers say the surcharges are outweighed by the  
24-hour convenience for customers and are needed to make the 
machines profitable. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today consumers have more choices than ever to get cash when  
and where they want it,'' said Donald Ogilvie, executive vice 
president of the American Bankers Association. He said the 
surcharges ``have led to an explosion of new ATMs in places that 
previously couldn't support them due to low usage, such as 
theaters, hospitals and neighborhood markets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chase Manhattan switched its position and began imposing ATM  
surcharges in January ``to ensure that non-customers who use 
Chase's network contribute to the significant cost of operation,'' 
bank spokesman Ken Herz said. 
</P>
<P>
	Citibank, which adopted the surcharges in states other than New  
York in January and in New York City in mid-March, had seen its 
ATMs become ``magnets'' for other banks' customers wishing to avoid 
the fees, said spokesman Mark Rodgers. That meant Citibank 
customers had to stand in long lines at their own machines, he 
noted. 
</P>
<P>
	Both banks said they continue to offer surcharge-free ATMs in  
several low-income neighborhoods in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey by PIRG covered 336 banks and 31 credit unions in 23  
states and the District of Columbia, out of some 9,000 institutions 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	It found that ATM surcharges continue to increase. The most  
common fee is $1.50, up from $1 a year ago. They range from 50 
cents to $2.50, compared with 25 cents to $2.50. 
</P>
<P>
	The average surcharge found in the survey is $1.37, up from  
$1.23 a year ago. They averaged $1.42 for big banks (those among 
the nation's 300 largest), $1.30 for small banks and 98 cents for 
credit unions. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1997 report by congressional investigators also found  
increases in the surcharge amounts and in the frequency of 
surcharges. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department's Antitrust Division last year started  
looking into whether the nation's largest ATM networks are 
illegally preventing small banks from eliminating the double 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
	A proposed ban on ATM surcharges was rejected a few weeks ago by  
the House Banking Committee, which overwhelmingly approved instead 
a measure that would require ATM surcharges to be clearly disclosed 
at the teller machines. 
</P>
<P>
	Connecticut and Iowa have prohibited the surcharges by order of  
their banking commissioners. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Bankers Association says it believes the market  
should determine ATM fees and the government should stay out of the 
matter. 
</P>
<P>
	The bankers' group maintains that the rapid growth in ATMs in  
recent years was made possible by the surcharges, which go toward 
paying rent, security costs and other expenses for the machines. 
</P>
<P>
	Most banks offer unlimited free ATM use for their own customers,  
the bankers' group notes. 
</P>
<P>
	The PIRG survey also found:  
</P>
<P>
	--Banks are earning an estimated $2.1 billion a year from ATM  
surcharges. 
</P>
<P>
	--Despite industry rules requiring signs on ATMs, nearly 25  
percent of surcharging ATMs surveyed either had no sign posted on 
the machine warning of the fee or a sign that didn't disclose the 
correct amount. 
</P>
<P>
	In those cases, consumers have to wait until they log in and see  
a message on the computer screen disclosing the surcharge, but they 
get a chance to terminate the transaction if they don't want to be 
charged.

<HEADLINE> Easter Halt to Bombing Called For </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Christian religious leaders from the United  
States today urged an end to hostilities in Kosovo and the 
resumption of peace talks as their congregations begin Easter 
observances. The Serbian Orthodox Church filed a lawsuit in federal 
court in an attempt stop the NATO bombings. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight U.S. Catholic cardinals, in joint letters to President  
Clinton and Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, urged a 
cessation of hostilities, while the head of the U.S. Conference of 
Catholic Bishops outlined steps to end ``the unfolding human 
tragedy in the Balkans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And Christian broadcaster Pat Robertson sent a letter to Clinton  
asking for a suspension of NATO's bombing in Yugoslavia during Holy 
Week, which is celebrated by both Western and Eastern Orthodox 
Churches. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, five Serbian Orthodox bishops who preside over  
the North American branch of the Serbian Orthodox Church called on 
Clinton and other NATO leaders to stop aerial bombing in Yugoslavia 
during the Easter season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We implore you to suspend the bombing campaign beginning today  
and at least through April 12,'' the Orthodox bishops said in a 
statement. ``This will provide for an opportunity to restart 
negotiations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Western Christian church this week observes Maundy Thursday,  
Good Friday and Easter Sunday. The Orthodox church, to which most 
Serbs belong, celebrates Easter a week later. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Thursday, the Serbian Orthodox Church asked a federal court  
in Chicago to halt the air attacks, saying that bombs are falling 
on sacred relics and icons. But a judge refused to hold an 
emergency hearing, ruling the court had no jurisdiction over 
political and military operations. 
</P>
<P>
	In their letter to Milosevic, the Catholic cardinals said  
Serbian military and police operations against the population of 
Kosovo should cease immediately. They also asked Clinton for a NATO 
cease-fire and said ``no time must be lost in an effort to return 
to the negotiating table.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both letters urged the convening of a peace conference involving  
other states in the region and the United Nations because any 
settlement would require the creation of an international 
peacekeeping force. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the signers, Cardinal Bernard Law of Boston, said, ``I  
hope somehow we might inject into the discussion the rhetoric of 
peace. It's a lone voice for the moment but it's a very important 
voice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cardinals John O'Connor of New York, Roger Mahony of Los  
Angeles, William Keeler of Baltimore, James Hickey of Washington, 
Anthony Bevilaqua of Philadelphia, Adam Maida of Detroit and 
Francis George of Chicago also signed the letters. 
</P>
<P>
	``May this most holy of times in the Christian world be filled  
with thoughts and deeds of peace, not war,'' the cardinals wrote to 
both leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO leaders have opposed the idea of calling off military  
operations in observance of Easter, saying it would provide 
Milosevic too great an opportunity to commit unchecked violence. 
</P>
<P>
	A representative of Pope John Paul II was traveling to  
Yugoslavia Thursday to personally deliver a papal plea for peace to 
Milosevic.

<HEADLINE> Explosion Injures Pa. Teacher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STATE COLLEGE, Pa. (AP) -- Three homemade bombs exploded Thursday  
inside a high school, injuring a science teacher in what 
authorities believe was intended as an April Fool's prank. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the 1,100 students at State College Area High School  
were hurt. The teacher was treated and released after being hit by 
shards from a detonation inside a plastic trash can. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a prank at all,'' said Police Chief Thomas King.  
``Had this occurred during class change, there could have been 
hundreds of kids in that area. It could have caused a lot of 
damage, a lot of injuries.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The plastic soda bottles were filled with water and dry ice and  
sealed shut. The mixture explodes under pressure. 
</P>
<P>
	The first bomb exploded under a bench shortly before 10 a.m.  
After the hallways filled with students and emptied during a class 
change, a second device went off in the boys' bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
	The third bomb detonated outside the bathroom minutes later.  
School officials evacuated students and called police, who found a 
fourth device hissing inside another trash can.

<HEADLINE> Baseball Uniforms May Pitch Brands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Can you picture Mark McGwire walking to the  
plate with a patch on his bulging biceps advertising a burger 
joint? 
</P>
<P>
	Or those famed New York Yankees pinstripes -- the ones worn with  
pride by Ruth and Gehrig, DiMaggio and Mantle -- hawking an ad for 
bagels? 
</P>
<P>
	It might be baseball's newest pitch: The sport's leaders and the  
players union are considering allowing teams to sell advertising on 
the sleeves of their uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first thing I think of is somebody's bail bonds on the  
back of the Bad News Bears' uniforms,'' Baltimore pitcher Mike 
Mussina said Wednesday. ``So it's going to be my name, my number 
and Joe's Bail Bonds? That's the first thing I think of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's not unprecedented: Soccer teams around the world have ads  
on their shirts, selling everything from breweries to banks, often 
emblazoned in letters larger than those of the team name. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball is talking to potential sponsors about putting  
corporate logos on 1- to 1 1/2-inch square patches -- perhaps too small 
to be easily seen from the upper deck, but certainly big enough to 
be picked up in TV closeups and photographs. The negotiations, 
conducted jointly by baseball and the players association, were 
first reported this week by the Sports Business Journal. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's one of those things where baseball is looking to further  
market itself and maybe that's a possibility we need to look at,'' 
Seattle catcher Dan Wilson said. ``If that's one way to do it, 
that's one way to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NASCAR drivers are walking billboards when they wear their track  
outfits. And tennis players and golfers frequently appear on the 
court and the course wearing shirts and caps with corporate logos. 
</P>
<P>
	Although shoes and equipment such as bats and gloves carry brand  
names and logos, ads on uniforms apparently would be a first for 
the four major U.S. team sports. Currently, the only corporate 
marking on baseball uniforms is an ``R'' for Russell Athletic, the 
manufacturer of the jerseys. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is about trying to find creative ways to bring valuable  
partners into baseball,'' said Tim Brosnan, baseball's senior vice 
president of domestic and international properties. 
</P>
<P>
	Brosnan wouldn't put a timetable on the discussions or when a  
final decision will be made, saying it depends ``on when things 
gel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a traditionalist, but I know all these things we're doing  
generate more revenue, and that's what we have to do,'' Florida 
Marlins manager John Boles said. If Mr. Henry (Florida owner John 
Henry) says, `This is what we're doing on the uniforms,' I'd say, 
`Looks great to me.' 
</P>
<P>
	Several officials speaking on the condition they not be  
identified said owners would have to give the final go-ahead and 
pointed out that commissioner Bud Selig moves slowly and carefully 
toward decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are active discussions about the issues that bring  
additional partners and additional sponsors into baseball,'' 
Brosnan said. ``We're kicking around a lot of things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Selig and chief operating officer Paul Beeston did not respond  
to telephone calls seeking comment on the plan. Gene Orza, the 
union's No. 2 official, said a national sponsor might buy the 
rights to all uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
	``The talks are still very preliminary. To even discuss them is  
to give them a substance they don't deserve,'' Orza said. ``But be 
assured that whatever we do, it will be tasteful, a small logo on 
the uniform.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball would prohibit uniform ads only from tobacco, alcohol  
and media companies. Broadcasters of games are unlikely to want to 
show closeups of players wearing ads for their competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer advocate Ralph Nader dislikes the idea, and sent a  
letter to Selig telling him so. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is bad enough already when outfielders are going back for a  
long drive, that fans have to see advertisements for Coca-Cola and 
other products,'' Nader wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	``You are trying the patience of loyal fans across the country.  
Fans yearn for baseball that is free from blatant huckstering and 
crass commercialism,'' he said. ``Enough is enough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the scramble to find new revenue in the 1990s, often to cover  
players' escalating salaries, teams have dramatically increased 
ballpark advertising, plastering ads on fences and -- for the first 
time -- behind home plate, where they are visible behind the batter 
from the center field television camera. 
</P>
<P>
	Teams have even sold the naming rights to stadiums -- Banc One  
Corp. will spend $66 million in the next 30 years on the naming 
rights to the Arizona Diamondbacks' ballpark in Phoenix. The 
Yankees are discussing whether to sell naming rights to their famed 
ballpark.

<HEADLINE> Harrick Changes Mind Second Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATHENS, Ga. (AP) -- Jim Harrick changed his mind twice Thursday,  
deciding after a surreal day of back-and-forth to accept the job as 
Georgia's basketball coach. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Harrick took the head job at Georgia, only to  
announce Thursday morning that he had changed his mind because of 
family concerns and would remain at Rhode Island, where he coached 
the past two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	In the afternoon, after flying back to Providence and consulting  
with his family, Harrick changed his mind again, saying he wanted 
to join the Bulldogs after all. Then it was up to Georgia officials 
to decide if they wanted Harrick back. 
</P>
<P>
	After consulting for just over an hour by telephone, university  
president Michael Adams, a close friend of Harrick, and athletic 
director Vince Dooley, who was touring Civil War battlefields in 
Virginia with his grandson, decided to stick with their original 
choice. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would not have understood or accepted any reason other than  
family,'' Dooley said during a conference call. ``I believe 
strongly in that, and I've come to admire coach Harrick even more 
because of his deep feeling for family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harrick, who was scheduled to meet with his Rhode Island players  
at 5:30 p.m. and hold a 7 p.m. news conference to announce his 
return, didn't attend either. Instead, he released a statement 
though Georgia expressing regret for his indecision. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has been an emotional time and it's been all about  
family,'' Harrick said. ``I had to get back to my family and sort 
things out. Once I did that, which was late Thursday afternoon, I 
know now the right thing for me and my family is to be at Georgia. 
... Georgia is where I want to be, it's where I need to be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harrick was scheduled to fly back to Athens by Friday to begin  
recruiting -- a condition of the Bulldogs taking him back. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope I haven't offended anyone, but if so, I deeply  
apologize,'' he said. ``I want the Georgia people to know that I'm 
totally committed to the success of the Georgia basketball 
program.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The job felt right, but about my family, I was concerned,''  
Harrick said Thursday night in an interview with WJAR television in 
Cranston, R.I. Asked if he might change his mind again, he said, 
``It's done. There is no more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Amazingly, the series of events occurred on April Fool's Day.  
</P>
<P>
	``My late grandmother was married to my grandfather on April  
Fool's Day,'' Adams said, managing a smile. ``They lived together 
for 61 years and she used to say that was the strangest thing that 
ever happened on April Fool's. I wish she were here, because I 
topped her today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dick Bestwick, associate athletic director, said he contacted  
another candidate for the job, thought to be Appalachian State's 
Buzz Peterson. Bestwick stressed that no one else was offered the 
job while Harrick flip-flopped. 
</P>
<P>
	Peterson and Delaware's Mike Brey were the other finalists, but  
Brey withdrew his name from consideration. 
</P>
<P>
	Harrick's indecision was the second time in three years that a  
coach embarrassed Georgia by accepting a head job and then changed 
his mind. In December 1995, Glen Mason was hired from Kansas to 
coach the football team, reconsidered a week later and returned to 
the Jayhawks. 
</P>
<P>
	Dooley moved quickly to hire Marshall coach Jim Donnan, who has  
led the Bulldogs to consecutive top 15 seasons. Mason left Kansas 
the following year after a 4-7 finish. 
</P>
<P>
	Harrick may not have gotten a chance to return if Dooley had  
been in Athens. However, the athletic director was having trouble 
getting his cell phone to work on a remote battlefield in New 
Market, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	``I might have made a commitment to someone else. Who knows?''  
Dooley said. ``But things always seem to work out for the best 
despite all the circumstances.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harrick's change of heart also brought back memories of Georgia  
Tech basketball coach Bobby Cremins, who accepted the job at his 
alma mater, South Carolina, in 1993. After an agonizing week, he 
said he would remain at Georgia Tech. 
</P>
<P>
	Adams and Bestwick met with Harrick for an hour Thursday morning  
trying to talk him out of returning to Rhode Island, where he led 
the Rams to two NCAA tournaments. He told them his decision was 
final. 
</P>
<P>
	At 4:30 p.m., Harrick reiterated his change of heart in a  
telephone call to Adams, who wanted to coordinate statements 
released by the schools. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted a coach who was committed to this institution and  
the future of our basketball program,'' Adams said. ``If he had 
doubts, certainly remaining at Rhode Island would be the correct 
choice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The turning point apparently came when Harrick met with his son,  
Jim Jr., an assistant on the Rhode Island staff who was barred from 
coming to Georgia because of the state's anti-nepotism law. 
</P>
<P>
	The younger Harrick told his father ``what a huge mistake he was  
making,'' Adams said. By 5:30 p.m., Harrick called Adams again and 
asked if Georgia would take him back. 
</P>
<P>
	``I regret what we've all been through in the last 24 hours,''  
Adams said. ``But I'm at peace with the way it stands now, and I 
look forward to a long relationship at the University of Georgia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rhode Island athletic director Ron Petro said he met Harrick and  
his wife, Sally, at the Warwick, R.I., airport and asked the coach 
if he was prepared to remain at Rhode Island. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said `yes.' His wife was there with him and she said  
`yes,''' Petro said. 
</P>
<P>
	At 6:10 p.m., Harrick called Petro again.  
</P>
<P>
	``He said he was struggling with the decision, but that he has  
decided to go back to Georgia,'' Petro said. 
</P>
<P>
	Petro then called Adams to verify that Harrick would be offered  
a position at Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
	Harrick, 60, was hired by Georgia to replace Ron Jirsa, fired  
after going 35-30 in two seasons since taking over for Tubby Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	Harrick guided UCLA to the 1995 national championship but was  
fired the following year for his involvement with an illegal 
recruiting dinner. 
</P>
<P>
	He paid the tab and allegedly lied to cover up that more players  
were at the dinner than allowed by NCAA rules. After sitting out 
the 1996-97 season, he spent the past two years at Rhode Island. 
</P>
<P>
	He has a record of 403-182 in 19 years as coach at Pepperdine,  
UCLA and Rhode Island. His teams qualified for the NCAA tournament 
14 times, including a current streak of 10 in a row. 
</P>
<P>
	At Rhode Island, Harrick made about $350,000 last season. The  
job at Georgia will bring in $550,000 per year, plus $100,000 per 
year if he completes the four-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Harrick hesitated before accepting the Georgia job because of  
the state's anti-nepotism law. But his son supported the decision 
to come to Georgia, and Dooley said there were other family 
concerns besides Jim Jr. 
</P>
<P>
	Another son, Glenn, recently moved to Rhode Island with his  
family to be closer to his father.

<HEADLINE> Retooled BP Amoco To Take on Arco </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- BP Amoco's acquisition of Atlantic Richfield Co.  
would broaden its vast holdings, giving it operations ranging from 
natural gas fields in Indonesia to the biggest network of filling 
stations in California. 
</P>
<P>
	The $25.6 billion acquisition, announced Thursday, marks the  
latest stage in BP Amoco's rise from the depths of cash-strapped 
mediocrity -- an evolution many observers attribute to its 
single-minded chief executive, Sir John Browne. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday, as Browne detailed plans for the combined company, he  
reveled in its producing power. The company is expected to produce 
2.7 million barrels of oil a day, more than any other corporation. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said the deal was not motivated by the desire to be the  
biggest. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course scale is not everything,'' he said at a news  
conference Thursday. ``We're very conscious that we have to work to 
... counter the negative elements which size can bring.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Browne, who became chief executive in 1995, was speaking from  
bitter experience. He helped manage the company seven years ago, 
when -- as British Petroleum Co. -- it was struggling to pay its 
bills after making several costly acquisitions and betting that oil 
prices were heading to $25 a barrel. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, crude prices nose-dived to less than $15 a barrel, and  
BP found itself bloated with dangerously under-performing assets. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the key defining moments was in mid-1992 when they  
nearly went bust,'' said Alan Sinclair, an analyst with 
Charterhouse Securities in London. ``They set about selling assets 
they didn't want and streamlining the business by applying an 
extremely focused approach on returns.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That involved wrenching job cuts at the acquired businesses as  
Browne funneled his quest for efficiency into a near-obsession, 
analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
	By 1995, the company was leaner and back on track. Today, its  
return on average capital employed -- a measure of how efficiently a 
company uses its assets -- is one of the highest in the business, at 
9.1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	As BP's competitors began consolidating, Browne took his time  
before merging with Amoco Corp. That merger, completed in December, 
created the world's third-largest oil company and fueled Browne's 
cost-cutting reputation as he slashed 10,000 jobs to date. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger also gave the company's reputation a welcome  
makeover, analysts say. BP shed for good what Peter Hitchens, an 
analyst with Williams De Broe, called ``a pretty dull and boring 
image'' as it diversified beyond just oil exploration and 
production. 
</P>
<P>
	The Arco acquisition carries this evolution a big step further.  
The combined company now has 70 percent of its capital invested in 
upstream activities, 20 percent in downstream retail and marketing 
and 10 percent in petrochemicals. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is an ideal mix for an integrated oil company,'' Sinclair  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The BP Amoco-Arco combination still awaits approval by  
shareholders and regulators. If given the green light, it would 
become the second-biggest producer of oil and natural gas behind 
the still-to-be-approved Exxon-Mobil union. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts give much of the credit for this turnaround to Browne,  
an opera-loving workaholic who was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``John Browne is a visionary. The guy sets the pace,'' Sinclair  
said. ``I have not met a single individual that has such a good 
grasp of the industry they're involved in.''

<HEADLINE> BC Seeks NCAA Hockey Crown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- After an overtime loss in last year's  
championship game, Boston College has another opportunity to win 
its second NCAA hockey championship -- a half-century after its only 
title. 
</P>
<P>
	The Eagles (27-11-4) face Maine (29-6-4) in the first semifinal  
Thursday at the Anaheim Arena. New Hampshire (30-6-3) will meet 
Michigan State (29-5-7) in the other semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite last season's success, Boston College is the least  
likely member of what is now officially dubbed the Frozen Four. 
</P>
<P>
	The Eagles finished third in Hockey East and qualified for the  
NCAA tournament by winning their conference tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Seeded fourth, Boston College opened the tournament with a 2-1  
victory over fifth-seeded Northern Michigan on Saturday and 
qualified for the final four with a 3-1 victory over top-seeded 
North Dakota on Sunday, its eighth consecutive victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got a little streak going here,'' forward Blake  
Bellefeuille said after Wednesdays practice. ``We're on top of our 
game right now. If we play our style, I think we'll come out with a 
W.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boston College and Maine have split their four games this  
season, with the Eagles winning the most recent matchup 3-2 March 
19 in the Hockey East Tournament semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to prepare to play a great team like Maine,'' said  
Bellefeuille, who scored two power-play goals and had an assist the 
last time the teams met. ``You have to focus and play your best 
game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although the tournament is being played west of Colorado for the  
first time in its 52-year history, both teams have links to the 
Anaheim rink. 
</P>
<P>
	For Boston Colleges seven seniors, it is a return trip to where  
their careers began. They played in a 7-1 loss to Miami (Ohio) in a 
Great Western Freeze-Out tournament game Oct. 15, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	For Maine's Steve Kariya, the game is his first opportunity to  
play at the home rink of his brother, Paul, the captain of the 
NHL's Mighty Ducks of Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
	The younger Kariya, a senior left wing and team captain, is a  
finalist for the Hobey Baker Award, annually presented to college 
hockey's top player. He leads the Black Bears with 27 goals and 38 
assists. 
</P>
<P>
	In the other semifinal, Central Collegiate Hockey Association  
champion Michigan State is the only outsider in what is otherwise 
an all-Hockey East affair. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spartans were seeded second in the West, had a first-round  
bye, and opened the tournament with a 4-3 victory over Colorado 
College on Sunday, with freshmen scoring all of their goals. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan State also has a Hobey Baker Award finalist, senior  
center Mike York, whose 22 goals and 30 assists represent 41.6 
percent of its scoring. 
</P>
<P>
	New Hampshire, the Hockey East regular-season champion, is led  
by forward Jason Krog, the nation's leader in points, goals and 
assists, and another Hobey Baker Award finalist.

<HEADLINE> Nissan Z-Car Will Return in 2002 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK -- The ``Z'' is back.  
</P>
<P>
	Ailing Nissan Motor Co. will bring back the Z sports car that  
helped establish it as a power in the U.S. market back in the 
1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	The original Z-car was known as the Datsun 240-Z when it was  
introduced in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
	The new version, which will debut no later than the 2002 model  
year, will simply be called the ``Z.'' 
</P>
<P>
	France's Renault SA announced last week that it was buying a 37  
percent stake in debt-ridden Nissan. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday's announcement at the New York International Auto Show  
was made by Minoru Nakamura, president and CEO of Nissan North 
America Inc., who borrowed a theme from the baseball movie ``Field 
of Dreams'': ``If you build it, they will come.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nakamura stood on a stage amid a fake cornfield and shouted,  
``We will build it!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nissan said the strong positive reaction to the Z concept car  
since it was unveiled in January at the Detroit auto show convinced 
executives in Japan to approve the project. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been overwhelmed with letters from all over the world to  
go forth,'' said Jerry Hirshberg, president of Nissan Design 
International in La Jolla, Calif. ``This a company that needs to 
get back in the business of doing passionate products.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nissan wants the Z to be more than a niche vehicle and hopes its  
price in the mid-$20,000 range will make it more affordable than 
most of the two-seaters that have crowded the sports car market in 
the last few years. 
</P>
<P>
	But the reincarnation represents a big gamble for Nissan.  
</P>
<P>
	If the car succeeds, it will help erase Nissan's reputation for  
bland styling and lure more customers into Nissan showrooms. 
</P>
<P>
	Should it flop, it will exacerbate Nissan's woes. The company is  
mired in nearly $20 billion in debt and is about to embark on the 
$5.4 billion deal with Renault, in which the French automaker plans 
to subject Nissan to a heavy dose of cost-cutting. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is just the motivation the corporation needed during what  
has been, after all, rather difficult times for us with our minds 
on a few other things, such as learning French and staying in 
business,'' Hirshberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	``But the Z, while risky, seemed like just the right thing to do  
at exactly this kind of time,'' he said. ``It says to the world, 
`We're playing hardball.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Hirshberg said the concept car, which was created in just four  
weeks, will be further refined and that the finished production 
model will be ``bolder.'' It likely will be rear-drive and powered 
by either a four- or six-cylinder. 
</P>
<P>
	Nissan plans to follow up the coupe with a convertible.  
</P>
<P>
	``While it will retain some reference to its heritage, it will  
not be a `retromobile.' It will be a forward-looking car because we 
think the car has to resonate with people for whom `Z' is just a 
letter in the alphabet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nissan picked New York for the announcement because the original  
240Z was unveiled here in October 1969. The show opens to the 
public Saturday and runs through April 11.

<HEADLINE> FCC Questions SBC-Ameritech Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's top telecommunications regulator  
told SBC Communications and Ameritech Corp. on Thursday that he has 
``serious concerns'' about their planned merger and whether it 
would serve the public interest. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal Communications Commission Chairman Bill Kennard, in  
letters to the companies' chiefs, did not address whether the 
agency would try to block the proposed $57 billion merger if his 
concerns are not alleviated. 
</P>
<P>
	But Kennard said he wants discussions between the companies and  
commission staff to begin to explore ``whether it would be possible 
to craft conditions'' addressing his concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennard did not elaborate on what those conditions should be.  
</P>
<P>
	The merger, cleared by the Justice Department last month, would  
create the nation's largest local phone company that would control 
57 million telephone lines -- or one-third of the country's local 
lines -- spread across 13 states. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other things, Kennard asked how the commission can be  
assured that the merger ``will not interfere with the companies' 
willingness and ability'' to open their local phone markets to 
other companies that want to provide competing local phone and 
other communications services. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennard also wanted to know how the FCC can be assured that the  
public will receive the benefits the companies say will result from 
the union. 
</P>
<P>
	Specifically, Kennard was referring to the companies' claim that  
they need to combine to provide local phone and other services in 
30 targeted markets outside their combined 13-state local region. 
Such a move would have SBC-Ameritech competing against fellow Bell 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies say they will become more efficient and  
financially able to invade markets outside their region, which they 
contend they cannot do separately. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennard also asked how they can assure the commission that the  
merger will improve ``overall consumer welfare.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By law, the FCC must review proposed mergers to determine  
whether they will serve the public interest -- a broad legal 
standard. 
</P>
<P>
	``... at this stage I have serious concerns about whether your  
proposal satisfies this requirement,'' Kennard said in letters to 
SBC Chairman Edward Whitacre Jr. and Ameritech Chairman Richard 
Notebaert. 
</P>
<P>
	Ameritech spokeswoman Lisa Kim responded: ``This is an  
opportunity to put forth the many benefits of this pro-competition, 
pro-consumer merger.'' She said Ameritech believes the FCC will 
approve the deal. SBC had no immediate comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennard said he would like to begin discussions -- the contents  
of which would be made public -- this month and conclude by late 
June. The FCC could rule on the merger sometime thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
	This was the first time Kennard has sent such a letter to  
companies involved in a merger. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer groups and long-distance companies want the FCC to  
block the merger, contending it would thwart local phone 
competition and the prospect of lower prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Gene Kimmelman, co-director of the Consumers Union's  
Washington office, viewed Kennard's letters as a ``welcome sign 
that the chairman of the FCC recognizes the substantial competitive 
dangers of this merger.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But San Antonio-based SBC and Chicago-based Ameritech, supported  
by major telephone unions, say the merger would be good for 
consumers and competition. They say it will spur local phone 
competition and possibly lower prices, accelerate the roll-out of 
high-speed Internet access and data services, and create jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	The 13 states in the proposed merger are Arkansas, California,  
Connecticut, Kansas, Missouri, Nevada, Oklahoma, Texas, Illinois, 
Indiana, Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin.

<HEADLINE> Chicago's Thomas Eager for Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- The Big Three is down to just the Big Hurt.  
</P>
<P>
	Albert Belle asked the Chicago White Sox to show their  
appreciation, and now he's in Baltimore. Robin Ventura went to New 
York, and the White Sox barely even waved goodbye. That leaves 
Frank Thomas -- and the Romper Room. 
</P>
<P>
	But if you're looking for the two-time MVP to mope or complain,  
go look somewhere else. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm happy right now, I really am,'' he said. ``I never know  
what's going to happen in the future. That's the nature of the 
business, but I'm happy to be here and to help lead this team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Happy was the last word that would have described Thomas last  
season. The White Sox were in the first year of their youth 
movement, and the kids fell 15 1/2 games behind Cleveland as they went 
35-51 before the All-Star break. Thomas, playing almost exclusively 
at designated hitter for the first time in his career, struggled, 
too, hitting .265 with 29 home runs and 109 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	While those might be great numbers for most players, Frank  
Thomas isn't most players. It was his first below-.300 season, and 
his 29 homers were his fewest since 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	``This game is not as easy as people think it is, and last year  
was very humbling,'' he said. ``I've never struggled in this game. 
I've always hit for a very high average. But last year just wasn't 
in the cards for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The White Sox didn't make his life any easier in the offseason.  
When Belle exercised an option to become a free agent, the White 
Sox let him go. They didn't come close to matching the offer 
Ventura got from the New York Mets. 
</P>
<P>
	And Thomas? With a contract through 2006, he was left to  
baby-sit the kiddies. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those guys got the money they deserved; it was best for them  
and their families, and I'm happy for them,'' he said. ``I've seen 
so many come and go in this organization over the last 8 1/2 years 
that you get used to it. But the game must go on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There were rumblings, though, that it might go on in Chicago  
without Thomas. There were trade rumors throughout the winter, and 
when Atlanta's Andres Galarraga learned he had cancer, there was 
speculation the Georgia native was headed for the Braves. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas just laughs at the gossip. He's not going anywhere, nor  
does he want to. Honest. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the biggest deal for the organization was, was I going  
to be happy or not? I guess I proved them wrong with my attitude 
this spring,'' he said, smiling. ``Ask the guys who really know me, 
they know it takes a lot to keep me upset. I'm a happy-go-lucky 
guy. I'm high on life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sure, he was disappointed when Belle and Ventura left. The trio  
made for one of the most dangerous lineups in baseball, and now 
there's no one to protect Thomas. And how do you replace Ventura's 
five Gold Gloves and Belle's 49 home runs and 152 RBIs? 
</P>
<P>
	You don't, Thomas said. So the White Sox will just have to find  
a different way to win. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got a lot of young talent, and we can go out and play,''  
he said. ``I'm not saying we're not going to miss (Belle and 
Ventura), of course we're going to miss those guys. But it's just a 
matter of time before the young guys we've got in this clubhouse 
develop.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But, two months shy of his 31st birthday, how long can Thomas  
wait? Despite his huge talent, the closest he's gotten to the World 
Series is the 1993 AL championship series, which Chicago lost 4-2 
to the Toronto Blue Jays. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't worry about that right now,'' he said. ``I look at a  
good friend of mine, Tim Raines, it took him until the age of 37 
and he was in the big leagues at 21. Those things will happen, in 
due time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For now, all Thomas wants is to focus on the upcoming season.  
His troubles last year have given him a new appreciation for the 
game, and he can't wait to get back onto the field -- regardless of 
who's there or not there. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to worry about things you can't control, just go  
out and have fun,'' he said. ``In my mind, I'm going to have my 
best year ever. As I said, it's humbling to struggle. Now I look 
forward to the high times because they're going to be much happier 
for me.''

<HEADLINE> Garth's Day at Spring Training </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PEORIA, Ariz. (AP) -- How it went for Garth Brooks Thursday at  
spring training for the San Diego Padres: 
</P>
<P>
	 *COUNTRY CAMPER:* Garth Brooks got his first RBI on the last day  
of spring training in Arizona, helping the San Diego Padres beat 
the Seattle Mariners 9-8 Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The popular singer was hitless in three at-bats, but drove in a  
run with an infield grounder. He fouled out to the catcher in the 
seventh and took a called third strike in the ninth. Brooks wound 
up 1-for-22 in spring games in Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	 *HIGH NOTE:* When camp broke Thursday, Brooks went with the team  
to Las Vegas for games against the Milwaukee Brewers and Chicago 
White Sox. Manager Bruce Bochy wouldn't guarantee Brooks would play 
in those games. A decision on Brooks' long-term status with the 
team was expected within the next few days. 
</P>
<P>
	 *ON THE RECORD:* ``I'm happy. I'm really happy. I finally feel  
like I contributed,'' Brooks said after his RBI. He finished the 
spring with an .045 average.

<HEADLINE>  Canadians Celebrate New Territory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IQALUIT, Nunavut (AP) -- With a midnight burst of fireworks over  
a frozen arctic bay, Canada redrew its map today and created the 
new, Inuit-led territory of Nunavut -- one of the world's boldest 
experiments in letting an aboriginal people govern themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	Elders who had dreamed of self-government decades ago stood next  
to small children in temperatures of minus 13 degrees, watching the 
fireworks flare in the moonlit skies over Iqaluit, which became 
North America's newest and most northern capital at the stroke of 
midnight. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of political dignitaries from southern Canada and scores  
of journalists from around the world converged on Iqaluit for 
today's ceremonies, ranging from a speech by Prime Minister Jean 
Chretien to Inuit folk dancing to a heavy-metal rock concert. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like New Year's Eve,'' said Hannah Nutarak after watching  
the fireworks with her two young sons. 
</P>
<P>
	Daniel, 4, ``was a little scared,'' she said, but Joey, 9, was  
proud about Nunavut's birth. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be different now, and better,'' Mrs. Nutarak said.  
``There will be more jobs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nunavut, as big as Western Europe, consists of the eastern 60  
percent of the Northwest Territories. The division is the first 
major change in the map of Canada since Newfoundland joined the 
nation 50 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Nunavut means ``our land'' in the Inuit language, Inuktitut.  
About 85 percent of Nunavut's 25,000 people are Inuit, as are 15 of 
the 19 candidates elected in February to the territorial 
legislature. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is proof that we are committed to reconciling aboriginal  
rights in Canada,'' Indian Affairs Minister Jane Stewart told 
reporters. ``We aren't stuck in the past. We are prepared to evolve 
... I can't tell you the sense of pride this gives me as a 
Canadian.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the foreseeable future, Nunavut will rely on federal funds  
for 90 percent of its budget. Much of that funding is earmarked to 
address severe social problems -- Nunavut's rates of unemployment, 
crime, substance abuse and suicide are among the highest in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart said she was confident that Inuit self-government would  
be a positive step in tackling these problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you bring government closer to the people ... it will be  
more effective than when decisions are made from afar,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The territory's first premier, elected by his fellow  
legislators, is Paul Okalik, 34, the first and only Inuit lawyer in 
Nunavut. 
</P>
<P>
	A soft-spoken man, he watched the fireworks quietly on Iqaluit's  
frigid waterfront, hugging his wife. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really nice,'' he said, then added, ``I'm cold.''  
</P>
<P>
	Just before the fireworks, hundreds of residents gathered at a  
school gymnasium for an interdenominational service blessing the 
new territory. 
</P>
<P>
	``That which we call Nunavut -- our land -- is in fact God's gift  
to us,'' said Anglican Bishop Christopher Williams. ``We are the 
stewards of that gift.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Iqaluit (pronounced Eee-kah-loo-eet), on Baffin Island, is  
normally home to 4,500 people, but is accommodating more than 1,000 
visitors for the ceremonies. All were invited to a community feast 
later today featuring caribou, musk ox and raw seal. 
</P>
<P>
	With only 150 hotel beds in town, visitors were advised to bring  
sleeping bags and were housed in a community college, at military 
barracks, in private homes, even at a drug-and-alcohol treatment 
center. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday evening, officers in scarlet tunics presided at a  
ceremony establishing a Nunavut division of the Royal Canadian 
Mounted Police. Later, the territory's three judges were sworn in. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mounties, responsible for law enforcement throughout  
Nunavut, have a checkered history in the region and were preparing 
an official statement of apology for some actions in the past that 
they have said were insensitive to Inuit values. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, several preliminary ceremonies took place,  
including the presentation of a new Canadian 25 cent coin designed 
by Inuit artists and engraved with an owl and bear.

</P>
<P>
	Stewart said she was confident that Inuit self-government would  
be a positive step in tackling these problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you bring government closer to the people ... it will be  
more effective than when decisions are made from afar,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The territory's first premier, elected by his fellow  
legislators, is Paul Okalik, 34, the first and only Inuit lawyer in 
Nunavut. 
</P>
<P>
	A soft-spoken man, he watched the fireworks quietly on Iqaluit's  
frigid waterfront, hugging his wife. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really nice,'' he said, then added, ``I'm cold.''  
</P>
<P>
	Just before the fireworks, hundreds of residents gathered at a  
school gymnasium for an interdenominational service blessing the 
new territory. 
</P>
<P>
	``That which we call Nunavut -- our land -- is in fact God's gift  
to us,'' said Anglican Bishop Christopher Williams. ``We are the 
stewards of that gift.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Iqaluit (pronounced Eee-kah-loo-eet), on Baffin Island, is  
normally home to 4,500 people, but is accommodating more than 1,000 
visitors for the ceremonies. All were invited to a community feast 
later today featuring caribou, musk ox and raw seal. 
</P>
<P>
	With only 150 hotel beds in town, visitors were advised to bring  
sleeping bags and were housed in a community college, at military 
barracks, in private homes, even at a drug-and-alcohol treatment 
center. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday evening, officers in scarlet tunics presided at a  
ceremony establishing a Nunavut division of the Royal Canadian 
Mounted Police. Later, the territory's three judges were sworn in. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mounties, responsible for law enforcement throughout  
Nunavut, have a checkered history in the region and were preparing 
an official statement of apology for some actions in the past that 
they have said were insensitive to Inuit values. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, several preliminary ceremonies took place,  
including the presentation of a new Canadian 25 cent coin designed 
by Inuit artists and engraved with an owl and bear.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Jalen Rose of the Indiana Pacers was fined  
$5,000 by the NBA and suspended for one game for tripping New 
York's Patrick Ewing and throwing a forearm that inadvertently hit 
referee Dick Bavetta. 
</P>
<P>
	Ewing was fined $2,500 for what the NBA said was ``escalating  
the altercation with Rose.'' The confrontation occurred Tuesday

<HEADLINE> Two Swimming Records Set </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Ian Thorpe of Australia set a shortcourse world  
swimming record today in the 200-meter freestyle and a Swedish 
women's team broke a world mark in a freestyle relay at the world 
championships. 
</P>
<P>
	The 16-year-old Thorpe broke a nine-year old record held by  
Giorgio Lamberti of Italy, cutting .36 seconds off the mark. Thorpe 
was time in 1 minute, 43.28 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Thorpe became the first to claim one of the $15,000 rewards  
being offered for the first time at the championships by FINA, 
swimming's world governing body. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, in the night's last race, Sweden's quartet broke China's  
world mark in the women's 4x200-meter freestyle relay by .22 
second. 
</P>
<P>
	Thorpe's record-breaking feat came a week after fellow  
Australian Grant Hackett had broken Lamberti's 10-year-old record 
for the 200 freestyle in a 50-meter Olympic-size pool by .02 
second, swimming the first leg of a relay in 1:46.67. 
</P>
<P>
	Records are faster in 25-meter pools because the swimmers turn  
more often and gain time from pushing off the wall.

<HEADLINE> Colleagues Pay Tribute to Stewart </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Upon hearing rumors that Norm Stewart  
was about to retire, rival coaches during his 32 stormy seasons 
must have had the same thought. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's got to be an April Fool's joke,'' Oklahoma State's Eddie  
Sutton told a colleague. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sounds like Norm's putting over a good April Fool's joke on  
everybody in the Big 12,'' TCU coach Billy Tubbs said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even after Stewart announced his retirement Thursday, they still  
had trouble imagining anybody pacing the Missouri bench except the 
cantankerous, craggy-faced man who'd been pacing there since 1968. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a sad day for college basketball and the Big 12,''  
said Sutton, whose coaching career began almost the same time as 
Stewart's. ``He is one of the outstanding coaches we have in the 
college game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Norm Stewart IS Missouri basketball,'' said Tubbs, who  
developed a colorful rivalry as well as a warm friendship with 
``Stormin' Norman'' during his days at Oklahoma from 1980-94. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw Norm briefly at the Final Four and we had a chance to  
visit a little. We talked about his properties ... and how much 
money it would take to retire. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told him, `Norm, the way you spend money, all you'll need is  
your Social Security.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Asbury will have the distinction of being the last Big 12  
coach to get the best of a Stewart-coached team. Asbury's Kansas 
State Wildcats beat the Tigers last month in the second round of 
the Big 12 tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was shocked when somebody told me he was stepping down,''  
Asbury said. ``I was amazed. I'm still not sure I believe it 
because I know that Norm is a classic jokester.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Hancock, an NCAA executive and former assistant  
commissioner of the Big Eight, bears a strong resemblance to 
Stewart and has been mistaken for him on occasion. 
</P>
<P>
	``One night at a Missouri-Kansas State game I was walking to my  
seat and somebody started yelling, `Hey, Norm, you stupid jerk,' or 
words to that effect,'' Hancock said. ``I just waved and sat down, 
but Norm got the biggest kick out of that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The way to get along with Stewart was not to let him intimidate  
you, Hancock said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Norm was viewed as cantankerous, but those who knew him knew  
that wasn't the true Norm,'' he said. ``You had to show him he 
wasn't going to intimidate you. From that moment on, you got his 
respect and he'd do anything for you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his last season, Stewart's teams tied for runnerup in the Big  
12 with two of his oldest rivals, Kansas and Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
	``When people think of Norm Stewart, they should thank him for  
all of his hard work and the contributions he's made to our game to 
make it better,'' Oklahoma coach Kelvin Sampson said. ``He's a guy 
I think will be missed in this league.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``College basketball is losing a great one,'' Kansas coach Roy  
Williams said. ``His 731 wins and 32 years at the same place are 
amazing accomplishments. I just can't picture Missouri basketball 
without Norm Stewart on the sideline. I can think of many 
characteristics to describe coach Stewart. He was a great 
competitor, a great coach ...'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Duke assistant Quin Snyder is considered the top  
candidate to replace Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
	But athletic director Mike Alden said that the search is only  
now beginning. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're taking a look at coaches all around the country,''  
Alden said. ``There are a lot of names out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Others being mentioned include Washington coach Bob Bender;  
departed Iowa coach Tom Davis; Larry Drew, an assistant with the 
Los Angeles Lakers who played for Stewart at Missouri, and 
Southeast Missouri coach Gary Garner, a one-time Stewart assistant.

<HEADLINE> Small Towns Hit Hard by Trials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LARAMIE, Wyo. (AP) -- Across the nation, small communities are  
finding that justice can be very expensive. Some prosecutors are 
deciding it's not worth it, especially for death penalty cases. 
</P>
<P>
	In Laramie, where Russell Henderson is on trial for the beating  
death of gay college student Matthew Shepard, social service 
agencies could lose more than $100,000 unless the county can come 
up with a way to pay for prosecuting and defending Henderson and 
co-defendant Aaron McKinney. 
</P>
<P>
	The first phase of jury selection in Henderson's trial concluded  
Wednesday with the choice of 47 prospects, who will undergo a final 
round of questioning Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	In Jasper, Texas, Judge Joe Folk said it will take county  
taxpayers three years to pay for prosecuting two defendants in the 
dragging death of a black man and three other pending capital 
cases. 
</P>
<P>
	``This can bankrupt small counties. Some county judges have said  
they won't prosecute some capital murder cases and will go for just 
murder because of the cost of a trial,'' Folk said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Okanagan, Wash., the government was financially crippled  
prosecuting Juan Duarte Gonzalez, accused of killing a policeman. 
The case is expected to cost up to $1 million, 9 percent of the 
county's budget. 
</P>
<P>
	The county responded by drastically cutting spending, including  
pay raises for its 350 employees. Gonzalez even has his own line in 
the budget. 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Pozner, president of the National Association of Defense  
Lawyers, said larger communities like Los Angeles are better able 
to absorb the costs of major prosecutions. 
</P>
<P>
	``A big case in a small community can be prohibitive,'' Pozner  
said. ``But you have to make the communities responsible for 
prosecution. If you just gave them access to the state budget, 
everyone would want to do show trials.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mid-sized communities aren't immune from the financial impact of  
a high-profile case either. 
</P>
<P>
	Before this year, Boulder, Colo., spent $1.2 million  
investigating the death of JonBenet Ramsey, and the district 
attorney spent another $400,000. No one has even been arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	``The county has a limited budget and we're restricted by state  
law how much we can raise taxes. The prospect of paying for a 
multimillion-dollar trial is staggering. We have to come up with 
the money somewhere, and if that's the case, there's going to have 
to be some budget-cutting,'' said county spokeswoman Jana Petersen. 
</P>
<P>
	Pozner blamed prosecutors for driving up the costs in  
high-profile cases, saying they feel pressure to get more witnesses 
when the national media is looking over their shoulders. Pozner 
said defense attorneys are compelled to match prosecutors witness 
for witness, driving up the cost. 
</P>
<P>
	But former federal prosecutor William Pizzi, now a law professor  
at the University of Colorado, said it's not fair to blame just the 
attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm critical of the system as a whole,'' he said. ``We ought  
to be able to do this in a less expensive way, but it's hard to 
reform our system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pizzi said it is up to judges to keep expenses in check. He said  
costs could be trimmed by reforming pretrial procedures and rules 
of evidence.

	Clinton Holds Milosevic Responsible  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said today he holds Yugoslav  
President Slobodan Milosevic responsible for the capture of three 
Army soldiers near the Macedonian-Yugoslav border, warning him to 
``make no mistake'' and release them immediately. The United States 
initially branded the capture an illegal abduction on the 
assumption that Serb forces had crossed into Macedonia. But 
Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon later called them ``prisoners of 
war,'' raising the specter that the soldiers could be held until 
the end of hostilities. Yugoslavia said the soldiers were invaders 
and would face criminal trial before a military court tomorrow. 

</P>
<P>
	NATO Attacks Serb Military Units  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO attacks today destroyed a  
bridge over the Danube River and struck at Yugoslav military units 
in Kosovo as the NATO campaign to halt the Serb eradication of 
ethnic Albanians in the province reached its ninth day. ``The ring 
is closing around the Yugoslav forces,'' NATO Secretary-General 
Javier Solana said. Both Solana and U.S. Gen. Wesley Clark, NATO's 
top military officer, expressed satisfaction with the bombing 
campaign. But Clark acknowledged that NATO air power alone cannot 
stop alleged Serb atrocities being committed on the ground. 
Meanwhile, state-run Serbian television claimed that Yugoslav 
forces had cleaned out key strongholds of the rebel Kosovo 
Liberation Army. 

</P>
<P>
	Crackdown of Montenegro Beginning  
</P>
<P>
	PODGORICA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Yugoslav President Slobodan  
Milosevic removed Montenegro's army commander and seven other top 
generals today, in what could be the first step in a crackdown 
against the republic's pro-Western government. There was no 
official explanation for the reshuffle. The United States warned 
that any attempt to undermine Montenegro's government could 
escalate the conflict with NATO. Serbia and tiny Montenegro form 
Yugoslavia.

	Leaders Call for N. Ireland Peace  
</P>
<P>
	BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- In a bid to save the Northern  
Ireland peace accord, the British and Irish prime ministers today 
called for the province's rival paramilitary groups to surrender 
their weapons. The initiative is aimed at settling Protestant 
demands that the IRA start disarming before the creation of the new 
Protestant-Catholic government. Tony Blair and Bertie Ahern 
proposed allowing the IRA-allied Sinn Fein to receive their posts 
in exchange for an IRA promise to start disarming within one month. 
In return, the British army and police would announce a schedule of 
planned troop withdrawals and base closures.

	Cases of Child Abuse on Decline  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Reported cases of child abuse and neglect  
declined for the fourth year in a row in 1997, the government said 
today. The Department of Health and Human Services estimated that 
child protective services investigated reports of alleged 
maltreatment of nearly 3 million children in 1997. Of those, the 
states found 963,870 children were victims of abuse and neglect. 
Parents and relatives comprise the majority of those responsible 
for abuse and neglect, according to the HHS.

reported today. The decline was larger than any nationally among 
youth since 1980, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
said. The number of Florida middle-school students who reported 
having smoked cigarettes declined from 18.5 percent in February 
1998 to 15 percent in February 1999.

from 71 percent a year ago, according to a new survey. The U.S. 
Public Interest Research Group survey also found that ATM 
surcharges continue to increase. The most common fee is $1.50, up 
from $1 a year ago.

accepted the Georgia head coaching job. Georgia president Michael 
F. Adams tried to talk him out of the decision, but Harrick told 
him that his decision was final, the university said. Harrick has a 
record of 403-182 in 19 years as coach at Pepperdine, UCLA and

<HEADLINE> Umpire Kaiser Contests Bad Rating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- Ken Kaiser issued a challenge to the  
baseball players who voted him the worst umpire in the American 
League. 
</P>
<P>
	Scrawling some of the biggest names in baseball on a piece of  
paper -- names like Mark McGwire, Cal Ripken Jr. and Sammy Sosa -- he 
declared: ``If any of them tells you I'm the worst umpire in the 
American League, I'll retire on the spot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kaiser, who lives in Rochester, thinks the Major League Baseball  
Players Association survey that ranked him last among the AL's 32 
umpires was flawed. ``I seriously question how many players 
actually participated,'' he said in Thursday's Rochester Democrat 
and Chronicle. 
</P>
<P>
	While working his last game of the exhibition season in Florida  
on Tuesday, he said several players told him they hadn't even 
received the survey. 
</P>
<P>
	Kaiser said he thinks the survey was a grandstanding attempt by  
union head Donald Fehr to ``show his players that he's sticking up 
for them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Players rated umpires on physical condition, physical and mental  
toughness, accuracy of calls on the bases, accuracy of calls at the 
plate, consistency, temperament, respect for players and overall 
capacity. 
</P>
<P>
	Tim McClelland and Jerry Crawford were rated as baseball's top  
umpires. Charlie Williams was 36th and last in the National League. 
Kaiser was ranked last in five categories, including respect for 
the players and temperament. 
</P>
<P>
	Kaiser said his reputation for being confrontational is  
undeserved. He has ejected just three players in five years, and 
said he has not had a player come out to argue one of his calls on 
the bases since the 1996 World Series.

<HEADLINE> Mammoth Bones, Other Fossils Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                       *Associated Press Write    	
</P>
<P>
	HEMET, Calif. (AP) -- Digging for a new reservoir in Southern  
California has uncovered a huge array of ice age fossils, including 
a mammoth that may be the best-preserved bones of the elephant 
ancestor found in the region, experts said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's huge,'' Eric Scott, a paleontology supervisor for the San  
Bernardino County Museum, said Wednesday of the fossils. ``It's 
going to rewrite North American paleontology.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The mammoth's yellow curving tusks, teeth, lower jaw and other  
bones were found Monday at the site of the Eastside Reservoir, a 
4.5-mile-by-2-mile expanse of raw, scraped earth in Riverside 
County, 75 miles east of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's certainly the best-preserved we've found,'' Scott said.  
``There could be a lot more of this critter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The museum is overseeing state-required fossil research at the  
reservoir, a $2.2 billion project scheduled for completion by the 
end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of bones have been dug up since construction began in  
1993. While the area today is a mix of dry desert and farmlands 
surrounded by hills, it was cooler and greener during the ice age 
50,000 to 11,000 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Mammoth, mastodon, sabertooth cats, horses, camels and many now  
extinct species wandered the site in Domenigoni Valley, which was 
lush with ponderosa pine and manzanita, Scott said.

	``There's not an assemblage of animals like this anywhere for  
this time period, not just in the inland valleys, but in California 
and even perhaps the western United States,'' said Kathleen 
Springer, senior curator of paleontology for the museum. 
</P>
<P>
	Paleontologists have also found bison, sloth, North American  
lion, dire wolves, bears, badgers, weasels, peccaries and deer. 
</P>
<P>
	The mammoth bones appear to be from a female in her mid-20s, a  
``sub-adult'' to very young adult who died 15,000 to 20,000 years 
ago, Scott said. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists will take the bones to a laboratory to try to  
determine whether the mammoth had a disease or injury, and will 
look for tooth marks that might indicate she was killed by a 
predator. 
</P>
<P>
	The find was the latest in an area that is surprisingly rich in  
fossils, especially those of mastodons, a smaller, more primitive 
elephant ancestor that lived at the same time as mammoths. However, 
most of the finds have been individual bones or fragments because 
an ancient stream scattered and dismembered the bodies. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott said bones from about 10 mammoths and 30 mastodons have  
been found, prompting researchers to nickname the area ``The Valley 
of the Mastodons.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mastodons have been found in the better-known La Brea Tar Pits  
in Los Angeles, but nobody suspected they would be found so far 
inland.

<HEADLINE> Dow Gains 31 in Early Trading / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices have opened higher. The Dow Jones  
industrial average is up 31 points in today's early going. 
Advancers on the New York Stock Exchange hold a 3-2 lead over 
decliners. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq Composite Index is up 32 points and the S&AMP;P 500 Index  
is up five points. 
</P>
<P>
	Plenty for Wall Street to look at today, from corporate news to  
economic data. 
</P>
<P>
	First, in the mergers field, there have been three big deals  
announced today. 
</P>
<P>
	BP-Amoco has agreed to buy Arco. CBS has announced a deal for  
King World Productions. And Yahoo! is purchasing Broadcast.com. 
</P>
<P>
	As far as economic information, we've already seen evidence of  
continued strength in the labor market, as well as signs that 
consumers remain on a spending spree. 
</P>
<P>
	Today marks the start of the second quarter, but also the end of  
the trading week. 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street will be closed tomorrow in observance of Good  
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, there could be a good deal of choppiness in the

<HEADLINE>  UNHCR Mulls Airlift for Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- The United Nations is considering an airlift --  
similar to the one used to ease the Serb siege of Sarajevo during 
the Bosnian war -- to send relief to hundreds of thousands of 
refugees expected to flee Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Kris Janowski, spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for  
Refugees, said today that more than 156,000 Kosovars had crossed 
into Albania, Macedonia and Montenegro in the past nine days and 
that the exodus was gathering speed. 
</P>
<P>
	``UNHCR staff said the scene reminded them at times of the  
darkest days at the end of World War II, with refugees streaming in 
all directions. Everyone interviewed told similar stories of masked 
men in uniforms knocking on doors and telling people to leave or be 
killed,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A jet loaned to the United Nations by the British government  
arrived today in the Albanian capital, Tirana, with supplies. It 
was due to shuttle between Tirana and a U.N. warehouse in 
Copenhagen, Denmark. 
</P>
<P>
	Marie Heuze, spokeswoman for the U.N. Children's Fund, said the  
plane would fly in emergency health kits for 40,000 people as well 
as 2,000 children's blankets, oral rehydration salts, water 
purification tablets and syringes. 
</P>
<P>
	But Janowski said that might not be enough.  
</P>
<P>
	``We are looking quite urgently at the option of organizing a  
Sarajevo-style airlift because with the numbers we're looking at, 
it will certainly be needed,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Planning was still in the early stages, but the airlift would be  
used to supply Tirana and the Macedonian capital, Skopje, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	World Food Program spokeswoman Christiane Berthiaume said the  
agency had about 34 tons of emergency food stocks in the region but 
faced problems in distributing it. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite chaos on the ground, aid workers were generally upbeat  
that they could cope with the outflow and said they had sufficient 
funds to cover their work. 
</P>
<P>
	But fears grew about the fate of people left in Kosovo.  
</P>
<P>
	``The people of Kosovo are now subject to the worst violations  
of body and soul that can be described,'' UNICEF chief Carol 
Bellamy said in a statement. ``All of this is happening without 
humanitarian workers to help alleviate the suffering.''

	Bombing Showing Results, NATO Says  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO's top military officer, U.S.  
Gen. Wesley Clark, said bombing raids hit targets all over 
Yugoslavia Thursday, particularly air defenses, communications 
networks, military compounds and Serb forces carrying out attacks 
in Kosovo. And NATO officials finally had a chance to express 
satisfaction with the bombing campaign that began March 24. ``The 
ring is closing around the Yugoslav forces,'' NATO 
Secretary-General Javier Solana. But he acknowledged that NATO air 
power alone cannot stop alleged Serb atrocities being committed on 
the ground. He said it was up to NATO's political leaders to decide 
how to respond.

	NORFOLK NAVAL BASE, Va. (AP) -- In the wake of having three U.S.  
soldiers captured on the Yugoslav-Macedonia border, President 
Clinton asked military families Thursday to ``be determined and 
patient.'' The president came here -- NATO's only military command 
in North America -- as concerns surfaced over the captured soldiers. 
Clinton pledged to hold Yugoslav leader personally responsible if 
those soldiers are harmed. ``President Milosevic should make no 
mistake: The United States takes care of its own,'' Clinton said. 
Meanwhile, the three captured soldiers are set to face a Yugoslav 
military court tomorrow.

for the province's rival paramilitary groups to surrender their 
weapons on Thursday. Tony Blair and Bertie Ahern proposed allowing 
the IRA-allied Sinn Fein to receive their posts in the new

start disarming within one month. In return, the British army and

	GENEVA (AP) -- The Iranian government is making progress toward  
building a more ``tolerant society'' that recognizes human rights, 
a U.N. expert said Thursday. However, the Islamic nation should 
remain under special scrutiny at the U.N. Human Rights Commission 
because improvements are not extensive enough, said Maurice Danby 
Copithorne, the U.N. special investigator on Iran. Copithorne, who 
presented his report to the 53-nation commission today, cited the 
killings of prominent dissident writers at the end of last year as 
an example of the ``unanswered questions'' about the regime.

learning to make replacement parts for ailing or aged bodies. The

into a colony of more than a million cells that could be induced to 
produce bone, cartilage or fat.

hurricanes, predicted Colorado State weather forecaster William 
Gray. Last season, there were 14 tropical storms, including 10 
hurricanes. The hurricane death toll in 1998 was at least 10,000, 
mostly from Hurricane Mitch's damage in Central American. The

<HEADLINE> Calif. Prison Will Be Full By 2001 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TRACY, Calif. (AP) -- They sleep nearly head-to-toe, sit  
elbow-to-elbow to use the toilet and wait in lines even for water. 
They swelter in summer and freeze in winter. 
</P>
<P>
	They are prisoners, sullen young men who mill about in the dim  
light of a converted gym, wandering along narrow aisles between 
rows of bunk-beds stacked two and three high. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's unconstitutional,'' said Rafael Harper, a 38-year-old  
drug offender built like a heavyweight boxer. ``It's very crowded. 
You can't hardly move around. In the bathrooms, your buttocks are 
bumping each other.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This is the prison at the Deuel Vocational Institute, a  
``temporary'' conversion of a dingy, half-century-old gym that has 
housed prisoners for more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
	It is close to bursting, a symbol of a state prison system that  
is the nation's largest with 160,000 inmates. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Presley, Gov. Gray Davis' new cabinet secretary for  
prisons, knows exactly when the state's rising inmate population 
will outstrip available space. 
</P>
<P>
	``April 2001,'' he said. ``By then, we will have exhausted every  
cranny and nook.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although a slowing crime rate has eased inmate growth, Presley  
has warned lawmakers that state prisons are approaching ``critical 
mass.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a time to take a critical look at all facets of the  
correctional system. This is a good time to consider 
alternatives,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Presley says he will try to reduce recidivism among the 110,000  
supervised parolees by expanding drug treatment programs and 
boosting educational opportunities for inmates. 
</P>
<P>
	The inmate population in California increased sixfold in the  
1980s and early 1990s thanks to stricter sentencing laws. At the 
same time, the prison system nearly tripled, from 12 to 33 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	California spent more than $5 billion in an unprecedented  
attempt to build its way out of the overcrowding problem. Voters 
approved about half the money and the rest was covered by bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	When voters stopped approving prison bonds in 1990, Republican  
Gov. Pete Wilson deadlocked with Democratic leaders over expensive 
new construction. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the burden falls on Davis, a Democrat who is still forming  
his policies, and the Democratic-controlled Legislature. The 
dilemma is whether to build more prisons or possibly be forced in 
two years to release felons. 
</P>
<P>
	Advocates of social change see an opportunity at hand.  
</P>
<P>
	``Prison should not be the catchall solution to all of the  
social problems that we have -- to mental illness, to homelessness, 
to lack of health care, to the lack of education,'' says Angela 
Davis, a former '60s militant turned prison reformer. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Assemblyman Bill Leonard, a Republican, has introduced a  
$4 billion prison construction bond measure that would go before 
California voters in March 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very concerned,'' Leonard said. ``We will have court  
orders when we reach full capacity that would entail release of 
violent felons.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Construction to relieve crowding, even if approved, would take  
three to four years and must be combined with social reforms to 
reduce the number of inmates, legislative analysts warn. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, prison officials are using every cranny they  
can find for inmates, creating a volatile atmosphere in a system 
already plagued by violence. 
</P>
<P>
	In the converted gym near Tracy, 60 miles east of San Francisco,  
TV cameras and razor-wire haven't prevented fistfights among the 
inmates, who swell to more than 600 by the evening count. 
</P>
<P>
	``When it's crowded like this, the potential for anything to  
happen is that much worse,'' said Glenn Schmidt, 37, a convicted 
burglar. 
</P>
<P>
	Added Rene Gallegos, a slight 24-year-old drug offender wearing  
prison blues: ``We're human beings. We can't be living like 
savages. That's what it's coming to.''

<HEADLINE> FCC Questions SBC-Ameritech Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A proposed merger that would create the  
nation's largest local phone company is causing ``serious 
concerns'' for the government's top telecommunications regulator. 
</P>
<P>
	In letters Thursday to the chiefs of SBC Communications and  
Ameritech Corp., Bill Kennard, chairman of the Federal 
Communications Commission, questioned whether their union would 
serve the public interest. 
</P>
<P>
	Given that, Kennard said he wants the companies and commission  
staff to begin discussions this month to explore ``whether it would 
be possible to craft conditions'' addressing his concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	He did not elaborate on what those conditions should be, but  
said he wanted the discussions to conclude by late June. The FCC 
could rule on the merger sometime thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed $57 billion merger, which was cleared by the  
Justice Department last month, would create the nation's largest 
local phone company, spread across 13 states. 
</P>
<P>
	By law, the FCC must review proposed mergers to determine  
whether they will serve the public interest -- a broad legal 
standard. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this stage I have serious concerns about whether your  
proposal satisfies this requirement,'' Kennard said in letters to 
SBC Chairman Edward Whitacre Jr. and Ameritech Chairman Richard 
Notebaert. 
</P>
<P>
	Ameritech spokeswoman Lisa Kim responded: ``This is an  
opportunity to put forth the many benefits of this pro-competition, 
pro-consumer merger.'' She said Ameritech believed the FCC would 
approve the deal. SBC declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other things, Kennard asked how the commission can be  
assured that the merger ``will not interfere with the companies' 
willingness and ability'' to open their local phone markets to 
other companies that want to provide competing local phone and 
other communications services. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennard also wanted to know how the FCC can be assured that the  
public will receive the benefits the companies say will result from 
the union. 
</P>
<P>
	Specifically, Kennard was referring to the companies' claim that  
they need to combine to provide local phone and other services in 
30 targeted markets outside their combined 13-state local region. 
Such a move would have SBC-Ameritech competing against fellow Bell 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies say they will become more efficient and  
financially able to invade markets outside their region, which they 
contend they cannot do separately. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennard also asked how they can assure the commission that the  
merger will improve ``overall consumer welfare.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jeffrey Kagan, a telecommunications analyst based in Atlanta,  
continues to believe the FCC will approve the merger. ``The FCC 
basically wants to be convinced the companies will do what they 
promised,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer groups, meanwhile, want the FCC to block the deal,  
contending it would thwart local phone competition and the prospect 
of lower prices. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T welcomed Kennard's letters, but called the merger ``so  
anticompetitive that there are serious questions as to whether it 
can be `fixed' with conditions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 13 states in the proposed merger are Arkansas, California,  
Connecticut, Kansas, Missouri, Nevada, Oklahoma, Texas, Illinois, 
Indiana, Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin.

<HEADLINE> Desert Hero Trainer Aiming High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARCADIA, Calif. (AP) -- When he was 16 and planning to become a  
racehorse trainer, Dick Mandella said his goal was to win a Derby 
by the time he was 30. 
</P>
<P>
	At 23, he won the Sacramento Derby, which wasn't exactly  
achieving his goal. 
</P>
<P>
	Now that goal -- victory in the Kentucky Derby -- could be within  
reach. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday, the 48-year-old Mandella will try to win the Santa  
Anita Derby with Desert Hero, a colt he never has seen race. If he 
succeeds, he will have a leading contender for the May 1 Kentucky 
Derby at Churchill Downs. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Desert Hero has had only two career starts, he was made  
the 5-2 early favorite to beat seven other 3-year-olds in the 
1 1/8-mile Santa Anita Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	The second and third early choices -- General Challenge (3-1) and  
Prime Timber (7-2) are trained by Bob Baffert, who finished 1-2 
with Indian Charlie and Real Quiet in last year's Santa Anita 
Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	Either or both General Challenge, a gelding, and Prime Timber,  
could give Baffert a good shot at winning an unprecedented third 
straight Kentucky Derby. He won with Silver Charm in 1997 and Real 
Quiet. 
</P>
<P>
	Adding spice to the Santa Anita Derby will be Honest Lady, who  
will be trying to become only the fourth filly winner in the 
62-year history of the race. Only three fillies have reached the 
winner's circle in 124 Kentucky Derbies. 
</P>
<P>
	Completing the field for the $750,000-added Santa Anita Derby  
will be Capsized, High Wire Act, Charismatic and Walk That Walk. 
</P>
<P>
	Honest Lady will carry 115 pounds, the others will carry 120  
pounds each. 
</P>
<P>
	Post time is 5:40 p.m. EST.  
</P>
<P>
	Mandella got Desert Hero and four other horses from the stable  
of Prince Ahmed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia after the prince's 
racing manager, Richard Mulhall, fired trainer Wally Dollase, 
citing philosophical differences. 
</P>
<P>
	Mandella said he has put a couple of stiff workouts into Desert  
Hero ``and he's done everything right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked what else he could do to prepare the lightly-raced colt  
for the grueling 1 1/4-mile Kentucky Derby, Mandella said, ``If he 
runs good in the Santa Anita Derby, he's as ready as he going to 
get'' 
</P>
<P>
	Desert Hero, a son of 1993 Kentucky Derby winner Sea Hero, made  
his first start Feb. 7 and won a 6 1/2-furlong maiden race at Santa 
Anita. In his second start, he overtook Prime Timber in the stretch 
and won the 1-mile San Rafael by a neck. 
</P>
<P>
	Mandella said he would watch a tape of Desert Hero's San Rafael  
before Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	There has been only one Kentucky Derby winner to not have raced  
as a 2-year-old. That was Apollo in 1882. 
</P>
<P>
	Baffert said he was surprised that Prime Timber was not made the  
favorite. Other people were surprised that the colt also was behind 
his stablemate, General Challenge, in the early line. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought Prime Timber would be the favorite off his last race  
(a two-length victory in the San Felipe March 13),'' Baffert said. 
``He ran an incredible race. If he runs that race back, he's a 
galloping winner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prime Timber, a winner of three of five career starts, with two  
seconds, wore blinkers for the first time in the San Felipe. 
</P>
<P>
	General Challenge will wear blinkers for the first time Saturday  
in his first start since finishing fifth in the 1 1-16-mile 
Louisiana Derby March 14 at the Fair Grounds for his only loss in 
four starts. He wore blinkers for a workout March 23 at Santa Anita 
and sizzled five-eighths of a mile in 57 3-5 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Since General Challenge is owned by John and Betty Mabee and  
Prime Timber is owned by Aaron and Marie Jones, the two will not 
race as an entry. 
</P>
<P>
	Honest Lady, winner of two of three starts, will be facing colts  
for the second time. She finished fifth in the San Rafael, but was 
only one length behind winner Desert Hero. She is stabled at 
Hollywood Park in Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
	The field in post-position order is Honest Lady, ridden by Kent  
Desormeaux; Prime Timber, David Flores; Desert Hero, Corey 
Nakatani; Capsized, Alex Solis; Walk That Walk, Chris Antley; High 
Wire Act, Chris McCarron; General Challenge, Gary Stevens, and 
Charismatic, Laffit Pincay Jr.

<HEADLINE> Grains, Soybeans Mostly Lower / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures prices were mostly  
lower early today on the Chicago Board of Trade under continued 
pressure from perceptions U.S. supplies will continue to build. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices were pushed lower after Wednesday's weak close, when  
market participants interpreted the government's planting 
intentions and stocks reports as meaning supplies will increase in 
the face of anemic world demand. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn and soybeans also were pressured by harvesting of bumper  
competing crops in South America and amid prospects for beneficial 
weather in the Midwest that could aid early spring planting. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat fell after weekly export figures showed continued weak  
business as supplies rise to their highest in more than 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for July delivery fell 2 3/4 cents to $2.88 a bushel; May  
corn fell 1 1/2 cents to $2.24 a bushel; May oats rose 3/4 cent to $1.15 
a bushel; May soybeans fell 3/4 cent to $4.83 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Live cattle and pork bellies futures were mostly higher on the  
Chicago Mercantile Exchange, while feeder cattle and lean hogs were 
mixed. 
</P>
<P>
	June live cattle rose .17 cent to 63.77 cents a pound; May  
feeder cattle rose .28 cent to 72.35 cents a pound; June lean hogs 
rose .40 cent to 52.75 cents a pound; July pork bellies rose .55 
cent to 52 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Yankees Sign 17-year-old Dominican </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The New York Yankees signed 17-year-old  
outfielder-third baseman Willi Mo Pena to a five-year, $3.7 million 
contract Thursday, a spokesman for his agent said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pena originally signed with the New York Mets last year. But on  
March 7, the commissioner's office ruled the Mets had illegally 
signed him -- it did not detail the improprieties -- and declared him 
a free agent. 
</P>
<P>
	Pena never played in the Mets' farm system because his status  
was uncertain. After becoming a free agent, the 6-foot-3, 185-pound 
Pena worked out for more than 15 teams in Arizona and Florida this 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	Agent Don Nomura's office said Pena's contract, which it said  
was a record for a 17-year-old player, included a signing bonus of 
$2.5 million.

<HEADLINE> Auburn Receiver Charged in Sex Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUBURN, Ala. (AP) -- Auburn receiver and punt returner Clifton  
Robinson was arrested and charged with second-degree rape, accused 
of having sex with a 15-year-old girl. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson was suspended from the team pending the results of an  
investigation, according to school spokesman Kent Partridge. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson, who started in nine games last season, was the Tigers'  
second-leading receiver last year with 42 receptions for 672 yards. 
He also led the team in all-purpose yards with 943. 
</P>
<P>
	The 20-year-old athlete apparently knows the teen-ager according  
to police, who said the sex took place about 1:30 a.m. Wednesday in 
an apartment. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson was released from the Lee County Justice Center on  
$10,000 bond. His court date was scheduled for mid-April. 
</P>
<P>
	Second-degree rape, a felony, occurs when a male over the age of  
16 has sex with a female under the age of 16, provided the male is 
at least two years older than the female. The sex can be 
consensual. If convicted, Robinson could face a maximum of 20 years 
in prison and a $10,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson was a reserve guard for the Auburn basketball team two  
years ago, averaging 1.4 points a game in 11 appearances.

<HEADLINE> NCAA Is Changing Eligibility Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- The NCAA, granted some time by a federal  
appeals court to make changes in freshman eligibility standards, 
says it could have changes ready by September. 
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA said Wednesday that it had been studying modifications  
in its minimum standards for months before U.S. District Judge 
Ronald Buckwalter ruled in Philadelphia that excluding athletes 
based on test scores ``has an unjustified disparate impact against 
African-Americans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The standards include minimum scores on the SAT or ACT, a core  
group of high school courses and a minimum grade-point average in 
that core. The 3rd U.S. Court of Appeals on Tuesday issued a stay 
of Buckwalter's ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA hopes to have modifications of the standards, known as  
Proposition 16, in place by Sept. 1, said Penn State president 
Graham B. Spanier, chairman of the NCAA Division I Board of 
Directors. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not promising we will have it done by that date.  
Circumstances can change,'' Spanier said. ``The stay gives us a 
window of opportunity following our own schedule and pursuing our 
research to have something in place by Sept. 1.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA will continue to pursue an appeal of Buckwalter's  
ruling not only because it struck down Proposition 16, but because 
it also raised other issues that needed clarification, Spanier 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The standards were challenged by four black athletes who  
contended they were denied athletic scholarships or sports 
eligibility because they did not score the minimum on the 
standardized tests. 
</P>
<P>
	The tests have long been a subject of debate in the academic and  
athletic worlds as to whether they are discriminatory. 
</P>
<P>
	Proposition 16 was a refinement of Proposition 48, which was  
enacted during the NCAA convention in 1983 at the bidding of 
reform-minded university presidents who wanted tougher academic 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
	Spanier said some sort of minimum standards are needed to avoid  
revisiting ``the bad old days'' when high school athletes arrived 
on campus ill-equipped to handle the rigors of university 
academics, were exploited for their athletic ability and then 
thrown out without education or skills when their eligibility was 
used up. In studies since then, the NCAA has found athletes 
graduate at a higher rate than the general student body. 
</P>
<P>
	``The NCAA position is that it has produced sufficient evidence  
linking graduation rates to test score cutoffs under Proposition 
16,'' Spanier said. 
</P>
<P>
	Modifying Proposition 16 likely will involve adjusting the  
weighting of the three components that make up the minimum 
standards, Spanier said. In particular, more weight would likely be 
given to overall performance in high school. 
</P>
<P>
	Studies show that the ``single best predictor of success is  
performance in high school,'' Spanier said. There are members of 
the NCAA board who believe high school performance ``is extremely 
important and should carry the greatest weight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, standardized tests must be part of the mix and those  
that think the tests are ``irrelevant or full of bias don't have a 
good understanding of testing or measurement,'' Spanier said. 
</P>
<P>
	The tests keep high school teachers or counselors from inflating  
grades, Spanier said, and also provide a benchmark in the face of 
the wide disparity of high schools across the country. 
</P>
<P>
	The standards of Proposition 16 remain in effect under the  
appeals court stay, meaning coaches should recruit under the same 
rules during the spring season as they have in the past, the NCAA 
said.

<HEADLINE> NFL Schedule for 1999 Is Announced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The new Cleveland Browns begin with an old  
rival, the Pittsburgh Steelers. 
</P>
<P>
	In prime time, no less.  
</P>
<P>
	The 1999 NFL schedule, released Thursday, has the expansion  
Browns, created to replace the team that left for Baltimore after 
the 1995 season, entertaining the Steelers Sept. 12. The game 
against the team that was the old Browns' heated rival will begin 
at 8:20 p.m. and be televised nationally by ESPN. 
</P>
<P>
	But that may be just a precursor to Cleveland's Nov. 7 game that  
brings in the old Browns, now the Baltimore Ravens, and their 
owner, Art Modell, an arch-villain in Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	The season opens a week later this year because of the calendar,  
which would have playoff games clashing with college bowl games if 
the NFL had its traditional Labor Day start. One result of that 
will be only a one-week break between the conference championship 
games and the Super Bowl, to be played Jan. 30 at Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	The Atlanta Falcons also are in one of the first week's top  
games, at home against the Minnesota Vikings, whom they upset in 
January in the NFC championship game. Another highlight comes 
Thanksgiving, when Jimmy Johnson returns to Dallas for the first 
time with the Miami Dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
	Another change is a return of the 9 p.m. starting time for  
Monday night games, the first of which will be Miami at two-time 
Super Bowl champion Denver Sept. 13. If John Elway returns, it 
would be the third meeting since last December of quarterbacks 
Elway and Dan Marino, who had opposed each other only once in their 
first 15 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Last season, the league went from 9 p.m. starts to 8:20 for  
Monday night games, but ratings were down, particularly outside the 
eastern time zone. NFL spokesman Greg Aiello said returning them to 
9 p.m. was a joint decision between the league and the network. 
</P>
<P>
	The addition of Cleveland gives the NFL 31 teams, which means at  
least one must be off every week. 
</P>
<P>
	San Diego will get a bye the first week, while Cleveland will be  
off the last week. 
</P>
<P>
	For the most part, teams that finished last season with poor  
records got late byes on the assumption they wouldn't contend for 
playoff berths -- Philadelphia (3-13) is off the next-to-last week 
and Cincinnati (3-13) the previous week. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike previous seasons, bye weeks aren't grouped by divisions  
but are at random. The first full bye week, the third, has Dallas, 
Miami and New Orleans off.

<HEADLINE>  Stewart Leaves as Missouri Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBIA, Mo. (AP) -- Norm Stewart retired as Missouri basketball  
coach today after 32 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart leaves as college basketball's third winningest active  
coach with 731 victories. 
</P>
<P>
	``Stormin' Norman'', as he was known for animated prowling of  
the sidelines, will continue as special assistant to the 
chancellor. He is 64. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart's last team went 20-9, losing in the first round of the  
NCAA tournament to New Mexico. It was another postseason 
disappointment for Missouri -- Stewart took the Tigers to the 
tournament 16 times without ever reaching the Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
	The winless streak included the heartbreaking 75-74 loss to then  
top-ranked and eventual champion UCLA in the second-round in 1995 
when Tyson Edney took the ball with 4.8 seconds left and drove 
through the Tigers the length of the court for a layup. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart, who made his announcement at a news conference, did not  
say what was behind his decision. Instead, he reminisced about his 
career and the teams he had coached. 
</P>
<P>
	``I came to Missouri a young man and I'm leaving a young man,''  
Stewart said after being given a standing ovation by several 
hundred supporters, players and others in the Hearnes Center. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement followed reports Wednesday of a falling-out  
between Stewart and athletic director Mike Alden. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart said today that the retirement was his own idea.  
</P>
<P>
	He informed Alden of the decision on March 15, three days after  
the New Mexico loss. At the end of the annual postseason meeting, 
Stewart said, ``I think I'd like to step down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He shocked me,'' Alden said today. ``I asked him, `Coach, are  
you sure?''' They met again the next day and Stewart said the same 
thing, Alden said. 
</P>
<P>
	Alden said he has no short list of candidates in mind to succeed  
Stewart, who took part as a player or coach in 1,127 of the 2,150 
games played by Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart weathered colon cancer and an NCAA investigation during  
his tenure. He was diagnosed with cancer after he collapsed on a 
team flight to Oklahoma in February 1989 and missed the last 14 
games of that season. 
</P>
<P>
	``What a great showing,'' Stewart said today of the fan reaction  
he received when he returned to coaching. ``I'll never forget this. 
What a great showing when I came back when I was stricken with 
cancer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the road, he often heard the chant, ``Sit Down Norm.''  
</P>
<P>
	Stewart concluded his remarks by saying he loved the chant.  
</P>
<P>
	``You know what I said to myself that day when they said `Sit  
Down Norm' -- I think I will,'' Stewart said.

<HEADLINE> Jordan a Hornet Player-Owner? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Michael Jordan will not -- and cannot -- play for the Charlotte  
Hornets if he gets his wish and buys a 50 percent share of the 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's absolutely no truth to it,'' Jordan's agent, David  
Falk, said of a report that Jordan was considering coming out of 
retirement and becoming a player-owner for the Hornets. 
</P>
<P>
	If Falk's denial isn't enough to convince everyone that such a  
scenario is bunk, the wording of the NBA bylaws should put all 
remaining doubts to rest. The league's constitution forbids players 
from owning teams, as Magic Johnson learned three years ago, and 
thus would prevent Jordan from being a player-owner even if he 
desired to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	In the opinion of one of Jordan's best friends, he shouldn't  
even consider coming out of retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	``First of all, (Jordan) is not good enough to make that team  
win anyway,'' Charles Barkley said. ``They need the old Michael 
Jordan, the guy from five or six years ago, to make that team a 
contender. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's the greatest player to ever play the game, and he would  
only do himself a disservice. I just hope he doesn't play because 
he'd damage his legendary status.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the prospect of Jordan returning to the court was being  
widely shot down, the possibility of him becoming an owner remained 
open. Earlier this month, Jordan held face-to-face discussions with 
Hornets owner George Shinn month about buying a 50 percent share of 
the team, and the two have agreed to meet again in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox Sports, citing unidentified sources close to Jordan,  
reported Tuesday night that Jordan's best-case scenario would 
involve him playing one full season for the Hornets while his 
ownership shares were held in a trust or otherwise deferred. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Michael Jordan and George Shinn negotiations have never  
involved a playing role for Jordan,'' Hornets spokesman Harold 
Kaufman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan, vacationing in the Bahamas, did not return a message  
seeking comment. NBA commissioner David Stern was out of his office 
Wednesday and could not be reached. 
</P>
<P>
	When Johnson ended his retirement and returned to the Los  
Angeles Lakers in 1996, the league made him sell his ownership 
shares back to principal owner Jerry Buss. Johnson later 
repurchased some of those shares after he finally retired for good. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan, in announcing his retirement earlier this year, left the  
door open for a possible return by pronouncing himself anywhere 
from ``95'' to ``99.9 percent retired.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those who have seen Jordan recently estimate he is about 20  
pounds heavier than his playing weight, and he recently said he 
hasn't picked up a basketball since hitting the final shot of his 
career -- the game-winner in Utah at the end of Game 6 of the NBA 
Finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan also recently underwent surgery on his right index  
finger, which he damaged with a cigar cutter. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan previously gave up basketball in October 1993 to pursue a  
career in professional baseball, then unretired in the spring of 
1995. He won championships with the Chicago Bulls in his final 
three seasons, giving him six for his career. 
</P>
<P>
	The scenario of him playing again next season, according to Fox,  
also would include Phil Jackson being brought in to coach the 
Hornets for one year and Dean Smith, Jordan's college coach at 
North Carolina, being brought aboard as team president. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson's agent dismissed the report, while Smith did not return  
a phone call seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Buck Williams, the former president of the players association  
whose 17-year career ended last season, is reportedly considering 
joining Jordan's potential ownership bid. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it makes a lot of sense beacuse Michael and myself  
bring a lot to the table,'' Williams said. ``You have to have 
business savvy and know the personnel in the league. I think it's a 
natural fit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Hornets have been a team in turmoil all season. Shinn has  
been going through a divorce and battling numerous sexual 
harassment allegations, coach Dave Cowens publicly ripped the 
organization before quitting, Anthony Mason has missed the entire 
season with a shoulder injury and the team's best player, Glen 
Rice, was traded to the Lakers for Elden Campbell and Eddie Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	The team has been playing better recently under interim coach  
Paul Silas, but it seems certain the Hornets will miss the 
postseason for the first time since 1995-96.

<HEADLINE> More Taxpayers Using E-Filing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The number of tax returns zapped  
electronically to the IRS is growing by leaps and bounds, but for a 
majority of taxpayers paper still rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Drawn by the promise of swifter refunds and reduced chances of  
error, the number of people doing their taxes themselves on 
computers and filing electronically has shot up 156 percent 
compared to last year. 
</P>
<P>
	But the 1.7 million returns prepared on home computers through  
March 26 represent a tiny fraction of the total of 63.1 million 
returns filed so far. 
</P>
<P>
	Counting returns prepared by professionals and simple returns  
filed over the telephone, total electronic returns have reached 24 
million, up more than 16 percent from last year, the Internal 
Revenue Service said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	One major reason people are filing electronically is the quick  
refund turnaround time, an average of 15 days compared to a 35-day 
minimum for paper returns. And ``e-filed'' returns are easier to 
screen for simple math or processing errors and can then be sent 
back to the taxpayer for correction without major IRS hassles. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are certain problems we can identify, send the return  
back to you and that way you can correct it up front,'' said Terry 
Lutes, director of IRS electronic program operations. 
</P>
<P>
	The IRS has aggressively marketed e-filing, including a mailing  
to taxpayers who used computers last year that had a new personal 
identification number to be used in place of a paper ``signature'' 
form. But most of the estimated 126 million returns the IRS expects 
to get this year still will be on paper. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some people are just technophobes,'' said Eddie Feinstein,  
director of electronic commerce at H&AMP;R Block. ``They're afraid 
their data is going to be corrupted. Some people fear they're more 
likely to be audited. Some people just enjoy going down to the post 
office on April 15th.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not much can be done about technophobes or the April 15 post  
office visitors. But the IRS says people should not worry that 
their returns will get messed up or fear they are upping their 
audit chances by filing electronically. 
</P>
<P>
	For one thing, returns don't get sent directly through the  
Internet to the IRS. They go through providers such as Intuit -- 
maker of the leading TurboTax and MacIntax software -- or via 
professionals such as firms like H&AMP;R Block. 
</P>
<P>
	These providers transmit returns directly to the IRS service  
centers and must undergo detailed background checks first. There 
have been instances of fraud, but Lutes said it's usually a small 
professional firm attempting to sneak in a few bad returns and 
pocket the fees. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have never had an instance of anybody breaking into the  
system,'' Lutes said. 
</P>
<P>
	People can obtain computer filing software over the Internet,  
and some sites offer tax preparation services. But Gene Goldenberg, 
vice president at Block Financial Corp., said there's a reluctance 
to do taxes on the World Wide Web. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are still mortally afraid to put most personal  
information directly on the Web,'' said Goldenberg, whose firm 
publishes Kiplinger TaxCut software. 
</P>
<P>
	As for audits, Lutes said IRS uses the same selection process  
for electronic returns and those on paper. 
</P>
<P>
	Some glitches have occurred this year, particularly during the  
peak electronic period of late January and early February. H&AMP;R 
Block's Feinstein said the high volume caused some problems for 
preparers transmitting returns to the Cincinnati IRS service 
center, and there were initial delays in direct bank deposits of 
some refunds, but the IRS responded promptly and solved the 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	One other area of electronic growth for the IRS is its program  
of accepting both state and federal income tax returns at once. Out 
of 24 million federal returns filed electronically, there were 7 
million state returns attached -- an increase of 47 percent from 
last year. Thus far, 35 states offer the shared return. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, Lutes said the IRS is close to its goal of 20 percent  
growth compared with last year. But it will take major changes to 
reach the long-term objective of 80 percent of all returns filed 
electronically by 2007.

<HEADLINE> 'The Weir' Is a Real Workout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *An AP Entertainment Review    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Ghosts. Fairies. Dead children.  
</P>
<P>
	The fine art of storytelling gets quite a workout in ``The  
Weir,'' Irish playwright Conor McPherson's tantalizing collection 
of tales that are both supernatural and all too human. 
</P>
<P>
	The play, a London success that has now opened at Broadway's  
Walter Kerr Theater, makes for an unusual evening, static in terms 
of action but remarkably theatrical in its vivid use of language. 
It's also terrifically acted by four men and one woman, an ensemble 
worthy of a group Tony Award for its absolute fidelity to 
McPherson's very specific, often difficult material. 
</P>
<P>
	The stories are told against the backdrop of a small dilapidated  
bar in rural Ireland. What sparks their telling is the appearance 
of a young woman from Dublin, who has just moved to the country. 
</P>
<P>
	The stylish lass dazzles the four local residents, who try to  
impress her with their eerie experiences. These memories from the 
past force all of them to pause, wonder and then shiver in 
recognition about the strangeness of it all. 
</P>
<P>
	The 27-year-old McPherson has an ear for quirky facts, odd bits  
of information that reveal character. ``You have to relish the 
details,'' says Jack, the play's most garrulous and engaging 
character. He begins the evening's storytelling. 
</P>
<P>
	Jack tells of strange knockings at the doors and windows of a  
house owned by an elderly neighbor. The noises are never explained 
but then the woman's dwelling was built right over the fairy road, 
a mysterious thoroughfare that brings the little creatures down to 
the village. 
</P>
<P>
	Played to the hilt by Jim Norton, Jack, with a red face and  
white hair, is a stereotype of the genial, pint-loving Irishman. 
The man has charm and blarney to spare. Yet McPherson -- and Norton 
-- take the character a step further. 
</P>
<P>
	The second raconteur, Finbar, is the most financially successful  
of the lot. The owner of a nearby hotel, he tells of the conjuring 
of a spirit -- by a ``Luigi'' board -- that haunts not only a 
neighbor, but himself as well. Dermot Crowley gives the man a bit 
of sly worldliness, a quality that eludes the other less 
sophisticated characters. 
</P>
<P>
	Shy Jim, on the other hand, lives with his mother. He tells the  
spooky story of a grave-digging experience in a nearby town -- and 
why no local residents would help dig the grave. His manner of 
storytelling is simple and direct, which only adds to the unnerving 
quality of his tale. Kieran Ahern's portrait of Jim is a model of 
understatement. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet it is Valerie's remembrance that tops them all, a horrific  
personal recollection that evokes the strongest response -- silence 
-- from this usually talkative group. Michelle Fairley's Valerie is 
coolly unemotional, which gives even more power to what she has to 
say. 
</P>
<P>
	The bartender, beautifully brought to life by Brendan Coyle,  
doesn't tell a story. He doesn't have to. His unassuming character 
is right there in the little things he says and does, particularly 
in his quiet admiration of Valerie. Watch how he pours her a glass 
of wine or guides her into the house behind the pub to locate a 
bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
	When the ghostly tales are through, Jack has another story to  
spin, the memory of a love lost that is heartbreaking in its 
matter-of-factness and Jack's quiet acceptance of what didn't 
happen. 
</P>
<P>
	Ian Rickson's direction is deliberately understated. He simply  
lets the stories be straightforwardly told on the dimly lighted 
stage. 
</P>
<P>
	The title ``The Weir,'' by the way, refers to a dam, which  
regulates the water for generating power in the area. A photograph 
of the men who built it hangs in the pub. Many are relatives of the 
men who are drinking there now. 
</P>
<P>
	McPherson and his director have said it is Valerie's story that  
acts as if it were a weir, unleashing feelings in these four men 
they never thought they had. 
</P>
<P>
	These emotions dominate the play. Although the dialogue may be a  
trifle arcane for American audiences and the Walter Kerr a bit too 
big a theater to hear everything clearly, McPherson's conversations 
exude a passionate poetry that is haunting. If you listen carefully 
enough, ``The Weir'' will touch your heart.

<HEADLINE> H-P Apologizes to Baltimore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Hewlett-Packard is apologizing to Baltimore for  
a recent national advertisement interpreted by a few officials as 
painting the city in a negative light. 
</P>
<P>
	In the ad, a banner headline across two pages said, ``You're  
dying in Baltimore.'' In smaller type on succeeding pages, the ad 
continued, ``Oddly enough you're killing them in Milwaukee. What 
you can't give away in one place is flying off the shelves in 
another.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The advertisement, for an Internet inventory system sold by the  
Palo Alto, Calif. computer company, appeared last week in The Wall 
Street Journal, The New York Times, USA Today and San Jose Mercury 
News. 
</P>
<P>
	The multi-page ad was part of a $100 million campaign that  
covers several months, according to an HP spokeswoman. The campaign 
was created by the San Francisco office of Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi, a New 
York advertising company. 
</P>
<P>
	The Greater Baltimore Alliance said the ad is difficult to  
understand and misleading. Alliance members organized a 
letter-writing campaign to voice unhappiness with the ad, 
generating about 40 letters and promises of letters. Four 
businessmen said they planned to tell HP they might reconsider 
their contracts with the company, GBA officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement issued Wednesday, HP said it didn't mean to cast  
aspersions on the city. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think Baltimore is a wonderful city, and we regret any  
offense the ad may have caused unintentionally,'' the statement 
said. HP said the flap has convinced it to stop running the ad. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're very pleased that they have acknowledged the faux pas,''  
said Lois C. Yates, vice president of marketing and work force 
development for the GBA. ``We're not letting them off the hook yet. 
I think we want to go a few steps farther.'' 
</P>
<P>
	GBA officials want HP President and Chief Executive Officer  
Lewis E. Platt to come to Baltimore to see the area for himself. 
They also would like to see HP run an ad that promotes the region 
along with an HP product. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to follow up with them on that,'' Yates said.

<HEADLINE>  Judge Sets Anwar Verdict Date </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) -- Malaysia's former deputy prime  
minister insisted he was being ``politically assassinated'' by his 
corruption trial, which closed today as the longest criminal trial 
in the country's history. 
</P>
<P>
	The case ended with Judge Augustine Paul setting April 14 as the  
day the verdict will be announced. The verdict had been scheduled 
for next Tuesday, but the judge said he needed more time to 
consider final arguments. 
</P>
<P>
	After prosecutors gave their closing arguments, former Deputy  
Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim told The Associated Press he was the 
victim of a political plot by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad and 
his allies. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still maintain that a political conspiracy involving Dr.  
Mahathir and his close associates to politically assassinate me'' 
were behind the four corruption charges, Anwar said. 
</P>
<P>
	Anwar, 51, said he was reconciled to a prison term.  
</P>
<P>
	Each corruption charge could carry 14 years in jail and a $5,000  
fine. A conviction would bar Anwar from entering politics for five 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	He still faces another corruption charge and five counts of  
sodomy. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial opened Nov. 2, and prosecutors attempted to prove  
Anwar was a corrupt adulterer. Defense lawyers claimed Anwar was 
framed. 
</P>
<P>
	They argued that the Sept. 2 firing of Anwar and his arrest 18  
days later were a conspiracy to eliminate the challenge he posed to 
Mahathir's 18-year rule. However, defense lawyers were repeatedly 
blocked from arguing that Anwar was a victim of a conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecution witnesses corroborated, often in lurid detail, that  
Anwar led an immoral lifestyle. They insisted he abused his power 
by forcing police to try to cover up his sexual misdeeds. 
</P>
<P>
	``The prosecution has proved its case beyond a shadow of  
doubt,'' said prosecutor Abdul Gani Patail. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Christopher Fernando countered: ``The only  
crime he has committed is being courageous enough to stand up 
against powerful politicians and to uphold justice and freedom. He 
is entitled to an acquittal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The judge initially ended the trial on March 22 after defense  
lawyers insisted he hear a motion asking the judge to disqualify 
himself. In the motion, Anwar said the trial had been unfair and 
the judge was biased against him. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul declined to hear the motion and threatened to hold the nine  
defense lawyers in contempt for insulting the court. But he 
relented and heard the motion Saturday, only to dismiss it, 
clearing the way for the defense to conclude its closing arguments.

<HEADLINE> Francis Leaves Maryland for NBA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLLEGE PARK, Md. (AP) -- Steve Francis ended his one-year career  
at the University of Maryland, announcing he will make himself 
available for the NBA draft, where he is expected to be one of the 
top picks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe it is time to take the next step and take on a new  
challenge,'' the junior said Wednesday. ``It's time to start a new 
and exciting chapter in my life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Francis, who helped lead the Terrapins to a school-record 28  
victories, made the announcement just two days after the NCAA 
championship game, to which many thought Francis would lead the 
Terrapins, either this year or next. The Terrapins fell short this 
season, going only as far as the Sweet 16 before losing to St. 
John's. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-3 Francis averaged 17 points for a team ranked as  
high as No. 2 in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm really proud of Steve,'' Maryland coach Gary Williams  
said. ``I don't have any doubt he's ready to play in the NBA. It is 
obvious Steve will be a very high lottery pick. Very few people in 
their lifetime get an opportunity like Steve has in front of him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Francis said he will finish his degree, adding that money was  
not the overriding factor in his decision to turn pro. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just something that I weighed in,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Francis flirted with the idea of entering the NBA draft last  
season after a stellar junior college career at San Jacinto, Texas, 
and Allegany in Maryland. Francis, who grew up in Takoma Park, a 
few miles from the Maryland campus, opted to play for the Terrapins 
instead. 
</P>
<P>
	In his only year of Division I basketball, he led the Terrapins  
(28-6) in scoring (17.2) and 3-point shooting (.388) and led the 
Atlantic Coast Conference in steals (2.8). He was named first-team 
All-ACC in addition to being named second-team All-American. 
</P>
<P>
	Three senior Maryland starters this season -- Laron Profit,  
Obinna Ekezie and Terrell Stokes -- won't return next year, leaving 
forward Terence Morris the only returning starter. 
</P>
<P>
	Francis joins forward Albert White of Missouri in leaving  
college early. 
</P>
<P>
	Others who might enter the NBA draft are: Duke's William Avery  
and Elton Brand, the latter the national player of the year; Khalid 
El-Amin and Richard Hamilton of national champion Connecticut; 
Lamar Odom of Rhode Island; Ron Artest of St. John's; Baron Davis 
of UCLA; Jumaine Jones of Georgia; Chris Porter of Auburn; and 
Mateen Cleaves of Michigan State. 
</P>
<P>
	Top NBA prospects who have said they will return next season  
include junior point guards Ed Cota of North Carolina and Scoonie 
Penn of Ohio State, and DePaul freshman Quintin Richardson.

<HEADLINE> Baseball in D.C. This Weekend </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Mark McGwire will be chasing Frank Howard.  
Nearly everyone else in the city already is chasing Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire was expected to be the big drawing card this weekend  
when the St. Louis Cardinals and Montreal Expos play a couple of 
exhibition games at RFK Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Three seats in the high upper deck have been painted white,  
marking the landing spots of three of Howard's mammoth blasts with 
the old Washington Senators. That should give the 70-homer man a 
target for batting practice. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll see if he can hit 'em as far as Frank used to,'' said  
stadium manager Jim Dalrymple, who oversaw an $80,000 effort to 
move the stands back to baseball configuration and otherwise spruce 
up the stadium for the games Friday and Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``You are looking at RFK Stadium the way it was set when the  
Yankees and Senators finished their last game,'' Dalrymple said. 
</P>
<P>
	Well, they didn't quite finish. Fans, upset over the Senators'  
impending move to Texas, stormed the field in the seventh inning 
and umpires called a forfeit. 
</P>
<P>
	That was in 1971, and the city's long-suffering, baseball-less  
fans have since been jilted over and over again as teams repeatedly 
flirts with a return to the nation's capital either via expansion 
or relocation. 
</P>
<P>
	The financially troubled Expos are the latest hot prospect,  
especially with the team unable to secure financing for a new 
ballpark. They are close, however, to getting several millions of 
dollars per year from the Quebec government toward building a new 
downtown stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``The rest of the league is using us,'' said Charlie Brotman,  
the Senators public address announcer, who remembers conversations 
with Presidents John Kennedy and Richard Nixon before opening day 
games in the 1960s. ``We're gullible enough to believe every owner 
who says he's going to move here. We go crazy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The most such recent approach was made by the Astros. Had  
Houston voters there not approved a 1996 referendum to finance a 
new ballpark, the Astros probably would have been sold and moved to 
the D.C. suburbs in northern Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Expos were to move, it wouldn't take place until next  
year. That gives the team's current owners a few more months to 
figure out a way to keep the franchise in place. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Expos will keep playing in front of the mostly  
empty seats at cavernous Olympic Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's difficult in the fact that we go to the ballpark and  
there's just not many people,'' said Expos catcher Chris Widger, 
who went to George Mason University in northern Virginia. ``If the 
team would have to move, I think it would be nice to play in a 
place where I played college ball. It's a great city for major 
sports.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Expos would play two or three seasons at RFK while a new  
stadium is built in either Washington or northern Virginia -- both 
jurisdictions have a group in position to bid on a team -- but a 
move into the area would be vigorously opposed by Baltimore owner 
Peter Angelos, who claims Washington is part of his market. 
</P>
<P>
	Otherwise, there is much sentiment for putting the national  
pastime back in the nation's capital. Although both previous 
editions of the Senators failed to draw well, the metro area is 
experiencing a financial boom and is the nation's No. 7 television 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	``The area is such a hotbed of population and in terms of our  
country,'' said St. Louis manager Tony La Russa, who first played 
at RFK in 1963 when he was an 18-year-old backup infielder for the 
Kansas City Athletics. ``It only makes sense that a National League 
team should be there.''

</P>
<P>
	HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) -- Saul Kohler, a former White House  
reporter who later served as executive editor of The Patriot-News 
in Harrisburg, died Tuesday of a heart attack. He was 70. 
</P>
<P>
	Kohler's career as a reporter, editor and public relations  
representative spanned more than 45 years, 36 of them in newsrooms. 
</P>
<P>
	Kohler joined the Atlantic City (N.J.) Tribune in 1948 before  
taking a sportswriting job at The Patriot-News two years later. He 
joined The Philadelphia Inquirer in 1956 and headed the paper's 
Harrisburg and Washington bureaus before joining the Newhouse News 
Service as a political reporter and White House correspondent in 
1971. 
</P>
<P>
	Kohler returned to Harrisburg when he was named editor of The  
Evening News in 1978 and became executive editor of The 
Patriot-News in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
	He left the newspaper in August 1984 to become director of media  
relations for Bell of Pennsylvania in the company's Harrisburg 
office. He retired from Bell in December 1992 and operated a public 
relations firm. 
</P>
<P>
	Kohler is survived by his wife of 43 years, Mary Virginia Baum  
Kohler; a son and daughter, and two granddaughters.

<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Angelo LaPietra, a former high-ranking Chicago  
mobster who ran the so-called ``26th Street Crew,'' died Sunday. He 
was 80. 
</P>
<P>
	LaPietra was one of five mob leaders convicted in 1986 of  
skimming $2 million in unreported gambling profits from Las Vegas 
casinos and was sentenced to 16 years in Leavenworth federal 
penitentiary. At the time, organized crime experts called the 
conviction the biggest blow to the Chicago mob since the 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
	After his release from prison, LaPietra returned to Chicago and  
founded the Old Neighborhood Italian-American Club. The club grew 
to more than 800 members and later also included members of Irish, 
Chinese, Mexican and Croatian ancestry.

<P>
	HAVANA, Fla. (AP) -- Lee F. Mainella, artist and longtime  
television newsman, was found dead Wednesday. He was 53. 
</P>
<P>
	Havana Police Chief Brian Mitchell said Mainella's death was  
ruled a suicide by hanging pending a toxicological report from the 
medical examiner's office. 
</P>
<P>
	Mainella's watercolor paintings were featured in numerous  
private collections and Florida art galleries, including his own 
Art Center &AMP; Gallery in Havana, a small town near Tallahassee.

<P>
	Mainella began his career as a television reporter at WECA-TV in  
Tallahassee in 1977. He also worked for television stations WPEC in 
West Palm Beach and WTVJ in Miami before returning to Tallahassee 
in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	From 1984 to 1990, Mainella covered Florida's state government  
for 11 television stations throughout the state. 
</P>
<P>
	He left journalism in 1990 to pursue painting fulltime, but took  
a part-time role in 1997 as the producer and anchor of the 
Legislature's Capitol Update, a statewide program covering the 
regular legislative session.

</P>
<P>
	RANCHO MIRAGE, Calif. (AP) -- Gary Morton, the Borscht Belt comic  
who married Lucille Ball and became her executive producer, died 
Tuesday. He was 74. 
</P>
<P>
	The cause of death wasn't disclosed, but Daily Variety reported  
he died of lung cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Morton, a stand-up comic, married Miss Ball after she divorced  
Desi Arnaz, her ``I Love Lucy'' sidekick. Morton and the actress 
were married for 29 years; Miss Ball died in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	He was executive producer of Miss Ball's ``The Lucy Show,''  
which aired from 1962-68, ``Here's Lucy'' from 1968-74 and ``Life 
With Lucy,'' which was canceled after two months in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	Morton also had supporting roles in films, including ``Lenny''  
in 1974 and ``Postcards From the Edge'' in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Born Morton Goldaper in New York City, Morton became a popular  
nightclub comedian in New York, Miami, Chicago, Las Vegas and the 
Borscht Belt before Miss Ball brought him to Hollywood and 
television. 
</P>
<P>
	Upon Miss Ball's sale of Desilu to Paramount in 1967, she formed  
a new company, Lucille Ball Productions, naming Morton vice 
president. That company produced ``Here's Lucy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Morton also produced several Lucille Ball television specials  
through the 1970s, and other specials and films for television, 
including ``Bungle Abbey'' in 1981 and ``Sentimental Journey'' in 
1984. 
</P>
<P>
	In motion pictures, he was executive producer of the 1983 ``All  
the Right Moves,'' which starred Tom Cruise as a high school 
football star.

</P>
<P>
	NEW SMYRNA BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Countess Vera Tolstoy, the  
granddaughter of Russian author Leo Tolstoy and a former broadcast 
announcer for Voice of America, died Monday of complications 
related to injuries she suffered in a November auto accident. She 
was 95. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the last surviving grandchildren of Leo Tolstoy -- who  
authored ``War and Peace'' and ``Anna Karenina'' -- Countess Tolstoy 
was the last in her family to have a personal memory of life at 
Yasnaya Polyana, the estate where her grandfather spent much of his 
adult life. 
</P>
<P>
	Born in Dubrovska, Russia, Vera Tolstoy was 7 years old when her  
grandfather died in 1910. A decade later, she fled her homeland in 
the wake of the Bolshevik revolution. She did not return to the 
Tolstoy estate until 1991 for a reunion of the writer's 
descendants, at which time she remarked on her grandfather's strong 
influence on the people of that country. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reverence of ordinary Russians for anything to do with  
Tolstoy is incredible. Anything my grandfather ever touched, 
anything that he ever used, is regarded as a museum piece,'' she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Vera Tolstoy spent 20 years as a Russian-language broadcaster  
for Voice of America in Washington. She retired in 1974 and moved 
to Florida.

<HEADLINE> Russia Mulls Larger NATO Response </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- President Boris Yeltsin was studying plans today  
to send more warships to the Mediterranean to shadow NATO ships 
conducting operations against Yugoslavia while his generals 
considered other possible responses. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin also today called for a meeting of the foreign ministers  
of the G-7 leading industrialized nations and Russia on halting the 
NATO attacks. But because six of the seven G-7 nations were 
participating in the NATO operation, it appeared unlikely they 
would agree to such a meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	``Despite Russia's resolute actions, NATO military action  
against Yugoslavia continues to escalate,'' Yeltsin said in an 
address on Russian television. ``Such an escalation threatens to 
lead to a grave disaster, and not only for Europeans. That mustn't 
be allowed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, officials said, Russia would increase its  
military preparedness, but no further details were given. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO attacks against Yugoslavia have ``raised new objectives for  
the Russian armed forces,'' Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said after 
senior officials discussed the situation at the Kremlin. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia has stressed it will not become involved in the conflict  
militarily, but it has angrily denounced the airstrikes. 
</P>
<P>
	One Russian warship was to depart Friday for the Mediterranean  
and more could follow shortly if Yeltsin approves, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Turkey, which controls the Bosporus Straits through which  
Russian ships must pass from the Black Sea to the Mediterranean, 
said it had agreed to allow eight warships to pass. Four ships 
could move through the straits this weekend, three more next 
Tuesday and one next Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Secretary of State Madeleine Albright spoke with Ivanov by  
telephone late Wednesday to express concern about the naval 
deployment, Russian news agencies reported. Ivanov said the move 
was to ensure Russia's security and give Moscow a clear idea of 
what was happening in the region, reports said. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia's Foreign Ministry today criticized the U.S. fears,  
calling them ``absurd in light of NATO's huge forces in the 
Balkans,'' the Interfax news agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though Russia has decided to deploy ships, Moscow ``has no  
intention of interfering in the current conflict around 
Yugoslavia,'' the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ivanov said today that Russia was still looking for ways to  
restart peace talks on the Kosovo crisis and several initiatives 
were under review, but he gave no details. A Russian peace mission 
headed by Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov failed to produce a 
breakthrough Tuesday in Belgrade. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kosovo crisis has put the Russian government in a difficult  
situation, domestically and overseas. It opposes the NATO 
airstrikes, but has few ways to counter them, while its domestic 
opponents are using the crisis to accuse the Yeltsin administration 
of weakness. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian military is in shambles and the nation badly needs  
Western loans to crawl out of one of the worst recessions ever 
experienced by an industrial country.

<HEADLINE> Boeing Offers Cargo-Plane Discount </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Boeing has offered to cut the price of its  
C-17 transport plane by 15 percent if the Air Force agrees to buy 
60 more of the cargo planes during the first decade of the 21st 
Century. 
</P>
<P>
	Stu Thomson, Boeing's vice president for business development,  
told reporters Thursday the aerospace company made an unsolicited 
offer this week to provide 60 additional C-17s between 2003 and 
2007 at an average cost of $149 million each. 
</P>
<P>
	That's 15 percent less than the expected cost of the last of 120  
of the cargo planes already ordered by the Air Force through 2003, 
Thomson said, and $100 million a plane below the estimated cost in 
1993 when it was being developed. 
</P>
<P>
	Air Force spokeswoman Gloria Cales said Boeing's offer was being  
evaluated. She said the Air Force is conducting a study to 
determine its long-range air lift needs and how best to meet them. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomson said Boeing made the offer now because it wants to have  
its best price on the table as the Air Force conducts that study. 
He said Boeing also wants to be able to continue production of the 
C-17 without interruption should the Air Force decide it needs more 
than the 120 C-17s now on order. 
</P>
<P>
	About 9,000 workers nationwide help produce the C-17, with major  
operations in Long Beach, Calif.; Macon, Ga.; and St. Louis. The 
C-17 program has suppliers or subcontractors in 43 states. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Force earlier this year awarded Lockheed Martin a $120  
million contract to update the avionics on the 120 C-5 cargo planes 
still in the Air Force inventory. Lockheed Martin currently is 
developing a proposal to replace the engines and upgrade the 
propulsions systems on the C-5s. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomson refused to speculate on whether the Air Force would need  
to modernize the C-5 fleet if it decided to accept Boeing's offer 
of another 60 C-17s at a reduced price. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's up to the Air Force to determine the mix,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The C-17 program came close to being canceled by the Air Force  
in the early 1990s because of cost overruns and questions about 
performance. But reforms demanded by the Pentagon and put into 
place by the company has turned the program around. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomson said the last 35 C-17s delivered to the Air Force have  
been on time or ahead of schedule, while the per-plane cost has 
declined steadily in response to engineering changes and 
acquisition reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, he said the plane has proven its versatility and  
reliability in recent U.S. operations, including ferrying troops 
and supplies to Bosnia in 1995 and 1996 in support of Operation 
Joint Endeavor peacekeeping forces.

<HEADLINE> Drug Firm Says Diet Drug Misused </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEBURNE, Texas (AP) -- Attorneys for American Home Products  
Corp. insist the company is not liable for the health problems of a 
woman who used the diet-drug combination fen-phen, saying she 
misused the products and was predisposed to heart disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Sandra Moore has sued the company for $110 million in the  
nation's first trial involving the once-popular weight-loss drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Testimony was expected to begin today.  
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Moore claims she had to quit her job because of heart valve  
damage caused by fenfluramine, half of the fen-phen combination, 
and Redux, a similar product. Both were marketed by Wyeth-Ayerst 
Laboratories, a subsidiary of American Home Products. 
</P>
<P>
	In opening statements Wednesday, defense attorney Sandy Liser  
said Ms. Moore's condition is not severe and could be linked to 
other causes. The attorney said Ms. Moore has a mild and common 
disorder often called a heart murmur that could be hereditary. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will show she had a family history of serious heart disease  
and obesity,'' the attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense also plans to present testimony that fen-phen, which  
Ms. Moore took for 22 months, carried labels that recommended usage 
of no longer than three months. 
</P>
<P>
	American Home Products, the world's seventh-largest drug maker,  
has been hit with more than 1,800 lawsuits since it pulled the 
drugs off the market in 1997 at the request of federal health 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Fenfluramine carried labels starting in 1988 warning that in  
rare instances it caused primary pulmonary hypertension, a 
potentially fatal disorder. The other half of the fen-phen 
combination, phentermine, has not been linked to heart problems 
when taken alone and is still being sold. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for Ms. Moore said American Home Products knew fen-phen  
caused serious heart problems and underreported the number of cases 
of primary pulmonary hypertension. 
</P>
<P>
	``These drugs were taken off the market because they were  
unreasonably dangerous,'' said attorney Michael McGartland. ``This 
should have been told to patients many years before.''

<HEADLINE> ABL's Former Players Work and Wait </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- A little over three months ago, Shanele  
Stires was a professional basketball player. Now she's waiting 
tables and waiting for the phone to ring. 
</P>
<P>
	``Actually, I'm a pretty decent waitress,'' the former Columbus  
Quest player said. ``I haven't dumped a drink or an appetizer on 
anybody yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But it's still painful when she is recognized by a customer.  
</P>
<P>
	``It feels kind of awkward, kind of odd, because I don't have a  
lot of time to talk with them about the situation,'' Stires said. 
``I'm not giving up on my dream, though. I may try to go WNBA or 
I'll try to play overseas. That's what I love to do. Now I have to 
find somebody that will pay me to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the two-time champion Quest and the rest of the American  
Basketball League went out of business in December, most players 
were left scrambling to find work. 
</P>
<P>
	The ABL's top players will likely move to the WNBA. The only  
former Quest players assured of spots are Katie Smith and Shannon 
Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest bide their time, trying to work out while hoping for a  
phone call from the ``other'' league. The WNBA is negotiating with 
its players union about how many players to bring in and how to do 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	``The WNBA players are trying to protect their own jobs, and you  
can't blame them for that,'' former Quest forward Andrea Lloyd 
said. ``But until they get this worked out, there are a bunch of 
ABL players who aren't sure what they want to do with their 
futures.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lloyd is planning her future right now. A veteran of domestic  
and overseas pro leagues, she's living in Atlanta, making the final 
arrangements for her May wedding and rehabbing a knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a tough decision for younger players, especially the ones  
that weren't making a lot of money,'' she said. ``They had to make 
up their minds pretty quickly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sonja Tate and Tonya Edwards, both Quest mainstays, are working  
odd jobs around Columbus and have filed for unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
	Angie Potthoff is a substitute teacher and volunteer assistant  
basketball coach in Indiana, Pa. Lisa Harrison is living with her 
parents in Louisville, Ky., ``just working out and staying in 
shape.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to swallow your pride a little bit,'' said Latina  
Davis, who is working part time as a maid and as a basketball coach 
with an AAU team in Maryville, Tenn. ``I've worked in the past, so 
the real world is nothing new to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The money's not even close to what it was, but that's not a  
big problem,'' Davis said. ``I'm able to stay prepared for my next 
chance. You can't always get everything you want all at once. I've 
always known that, and I'm willing to work for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stires works more than 40 hours a week. She doesn't have time to  
think about what she lost. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got this job about two days after the ABL folded,'' she  
said. ``What am I going to do, sit around and mope about it? No 
way. I needed the money.''

<HEADLINE> Congress Resists Recycling Effort </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a subterranean room of a House office  
building, bales of trash that mix high-grade white paper with lunch 
leftovers serve as a testament to Congress' failed efforts to start 
an effective recycling program. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers who support recycling are frustrated that some of  
their colleagues reject the program outright, while others back the 
effort halfheartedly. The failure to separate garbage from 
recycling material is the byproduct of an institution where the 535 
lawmakers set the rules for each individual office and committee, 
backers of the program said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The most stubborn bureaucracy in America is Congress itself,''  
said Rep. Sam Farr, D-Calif., a recycling supporter. ``There's 
never been an attitude that we should have to do that. No one is 
responsible inside an office. Some offices take it seriously and 
some don't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even the House chairman who oversees environmental issues on  
public lands has turned his back on the effort. Rep. Don Young, 
R-Alaska, said his office once separated recyclables only to see 
the effort come to nothing because of sloppy practices. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the time, the garbage was being separated by our office. It  
was later then placed in the same garbage bag by the cleaning 
folks, and it didn't seem as if it was being recycled,'' the 
chairman of the House Resources Committee said through a spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	High-grade white paper, the most lucrative product to recycle,  
isn't being widely sorted. For instance, the House earned $25,000 
for that recycling in fiscal 1998 -- far short of the $150,000 that 
could have been earned if 60 percent of the product was sorted, 
according to the chamber's former recycling coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
	The recycling difficulties are the latest example of a Congress  
having trouble following the laws and regulations that apply to the 
rest of Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, The Associated Press reported that inspectors  
appointed to ensure Congress obeys the same workplace safety rules 
as corporate America found numerous violations, including 
unprotected workers digging through contaminated trash, high 
concentrations of Legionnaires' disease bacteria in one building 
and improper storage of flammable chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
	Many U.S. cities and counties, as well as the executive branch  
of the federal government, require recycling. But Congress has kept 
its program voluntary. The recycling effort is under control of the 
architect of the Capitol, whose 2,000 employees maintain 
congressional buildings. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1997 survey of the 435 House offices found that nearly a dozen  
refused to participate and that many others failed to keep their 
promise. 
</P>
<P>
	``The problem is, it's a totally voluntary program,'' said Herb  
Franklin, administrative assistant in the architect's office. To 
enforce recycling, he said, ``you would have to have policing, and 
what would you do if people didn't comply? What are we supposed to 
do if an apple core is in a container with white paper?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, the architect's office is trying again. In a pilot  
project started last August and set to expand, some offices have 
been given separate containers for high-grade white paper, a 
lower-grade mixed paper, cans and bottles and pure garbage. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of Congress' mixed trash is now compressed and taken away  
by a recycling company, which pays for sorted white paper but 
nothing for material that is ``contaminated'' with garbage. 
</P>
<P>
	The House earned only $959 in fiscal 1996 from recycled paper,  
and that total fell to a minuscule $7.51 in fiscal 1997 before 
rebounding to more than $25,000 in fiscal 1998, said the General 
Services Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1998 improvement came after the House, in August 1997, hired  
a former paper industry consultant, Patricia Dollar, to be its 
recycling coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
	In an internal report in late 1997, Ms. Dollar said Congress  
could have earned $150,000 that year if 60 percent of its 
high-grade paper had been recycled at market prices. 
</P>
<P>
	But Ms. Dollar never met that goal. She was fired in February  
1998 from her $25,600 position after seven months on the job. 
</P>
<P>
	She alleged in an interview she was dismissed after refusing a  
superior's order to use ``evasive'' language in response to a 
congressman's complaints about problems in the recycling effort. 
The architect's office declined to address her allegation, citing 
ongoing litigation involving Ms. Dollar.

<HEADLINE> Braves' Klesko Is Ready for First </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KISSIMMEE, Fla. (AP) -- All Ryan Klesko wants this season is to  
stay healthy. He's not concerned with trying to be another Andres 
Galarraga. 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves' new first baseman, who is replacing Galarraga,  
played the position in the minors, but has been in left field since 
his rookie season with Atlanta in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	If his bat this spring is any indication, Klesko will be a  
capable fill-in for Galarraga, who was diagnosed with cancer in a 
small bone in his back last month and is undergoing treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	Klesko is hitting .440 (22-for-50) with five doubles, three home  
runs and 12 RBIs, including a solo homer in Wednesday's 7-1 
exhibition loss to the Detroit Tigers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Staying healthy. For me, if I can do that, I think I can be  
satisfied with my season,'' Klesko said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not changing anything. This game is all about pressure.  
Everybody knows that, especially in this organization. You're 
expected to win. I'm just going to go out and play hard while I'm 
taking over his job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Klesko, mentioned in several trade rumors during the winter when  
the Braves signed free-agent outfielders Otis Nixon and Brian 
Jordan, suddenly became indispensable because of Galarraga's 
illness. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every year since I've been in this organization, it seems like  
there's always trade talk,'' Klesko said. ``I'm just thankful some 
other teams are trying to get me and thankful that the Braves 
didn't let me go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He didn't let the trade rumors bother him. He recently purchased  
a log home on more than 200 acres east of Atlanta and is closing on 
another 200 acres next month. 
</P>
<P>
	Galarraga's prognosis is good for his return next season, but in  
the meantime, the Braves are looking for Klesko to help make up for 
the 44 home runs and 121 RBIs the Big Cat had last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just feel that he'll be back, and our hopes and prayers will  
be with him that he comes back to be healthy again,'' Klesko said. 
</P>
<P>
	But he's isn't looking to duplicate Galarraga's numbers.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to try to go out and hit an extra 10 home runs  
because he's sick. I'll do it because I'm supposed to do it,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The left-hander is coming off one of his worst power seasons,  
having batted .274 with 18 home runs and 70 RBIs last season, off 
his career-high numbers of 1996 when he had 34 homers and 93 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	He has a valid excuse for the drop-off from even the previous  
season, when he had 24 homers and 84 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	Klesko was hampered by a wrist injury and then had his appendix  
removed arthroscopically on June 29, days before the All-Star 
break. He had 13 homers and 47 RBIs and was hitting .285 in 73 
games at that point. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was going good until I went down with the appendicitis. From  
there on I just struggled,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	When he returned after missing only nine games, his power  
numbers shrank considerably, hitting .250 with five home runs and 
23 RBIs in the remaining 56 games of the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	``The second half I had a lot of doubles, but I didn't have that  
extra boost because I was injured. That was part of it,'' he said. 
``But I'm healthy now, and if I can stay healthy, I can definitely 
hit 25-30 home runs. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I'm not really concerned about more home runs, I just want  
to drive in runs and keep a high average,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	To do that, Klesko will have to play more against left-handed  
pitchers and improve his numbers. He hit only .213 in 61 at-bats 
against lefties without a home run last season, sitting on the 
bench for the most part in favor of right-handed hitter Gerald 
Williams. Klesko is a career .221 hitter against left-handers, with 
nine home runs in 408 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
	``I played against certain lefties, and I faced some tough ones  
in Randy Johnson and Al Leiter,'' he said. ``It's just one of those 
things that I have to work hard at and get better.''

<HEADLINE> Minor Rail Disruptions Expected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- CSX Corp. and Norfolk Southern Corp. are  
bracing for minor service snags as they prepare to split Conrail 
routes between them two months from today. 
</P>
<P>
	Seeking to play down the significance of any problems, officials  
from the two companies said Wednesday that the transition will not 
be error-free and that disruptions are inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
	They said they have maximized planning and capacity so that any  
problems do not lead to a service meltdown similar to one that 
faced Union Pacific Railroad following its 1996 merger with 
Southern Pacific Rail Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	``We expect things will go bump in the night, so we have  
contingencies ... and more assets and people than you really 
need,'' said John Snow, CSX chairman and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
	Slowdowns will occur in the first several hours of the  
transition as computers are shut down and reprogrammed, forcing a 
temporary shift to manual operations, Snow said. 
</P>
<P>
	The $10.3 billion takeover of Philadelphia-based Conrail by CSX  
and Norfolk Southern, now scheduled for June 1, has come under 
scrutiny because of the Union Pacific problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Snow likened the adverse effects from the computer shutdown and  
other, unforeseen problems to those of ``a freak ice storm that 
slows the railroads for a little while.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Union Pacific gridlock in the West and Midwest lasted  
several months and caused major delivery delays. It spawned several 
lawsuits by shippers and a drive in Congress to give federal 
regulators more oversight over the rail industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Norfolk Southern spokeswoman Susan Terpay said her company had  
contingency and backup plans to address problems as they occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	Teams from Conrail, CSX and Norfolk Southern will spend the next  
several weeks testing their computer systems and running through 
scenarios that could cause problems. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, approved by the federal Surface Transportation Board  
last summer, is the most complex and most extensive rail 
transaction in U.S. history, covering nearly 45,000 miles of tracks 
among the three railroads.

<HEADLINE> Minister Sentenced To 5 1/2 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LARGO, Fla. (AP) -- The Rev. Henry Lyons sobbed and begged for  
mercy at his sentencing for racketeering and theft, but a judge 
ignored his pleas and took away his freedom. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's time to pay the piper, Dr. Lyons,'' Circuit Judge Susan  
Schaeffer said Wednesday before sentencing the man who once headed 
one of the nation's most influential black denominations to 5 1/2 
years in prison. The judge also ordered him to pay nearly $2.5 
million in restitution. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons, the former president of the National Baptist Convention  
USA, was led from the Pinellas County courtroom to immediately 
begin serving his prison term. He still faces sentencing in federal 
court in June on related charges of fraud and tax evasion. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons had faced up to eight years in prison under state  
guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
	In asking for the maximum prison term, prosecutor Bernie McCabe  
accused the minister of apologizing in order to influence the 
judge's sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	``The words he speaks are the words he thinks will serve him  
best at the moment,'' McCabe said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons was convicted Feb. 27 of racketeering for stealing more  
than $4 million from companies seeking to market life insurance 
policies, credit cards and cemetery plots to convention members. 
</P>
<P>
	In court, Lyons also apologized for the theft of almost $250,000  
from the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, money intended to 
rebuild burned churches. 
</P>
<P>
	``It stinks in God's nostrils and I know it stinks in the law's  
nostrils and it stinks to me,'' he said. ``I ask the court and I 
ask America and I ask black people to forgive me because I believe 
that it will haunt me the rest of my life. I really do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons and his alleged mistress, convention publicist Bernice  
Edwards, were accused of spending the money on luxury homes, cars, 
jewelry and travel. 
</P>
<P>
	``I cannot shake the feeling that I have let so many people  
down,'' Lyons told the judge. ``I've asked God every single night 
and day to forgive me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I ask for mercy,'' Lyons said, breaking into sobs.  
</P>
<P>
	The judge and McCabe were rankled by a newspaper advertisement  
that ran March 15 accusing the jury of racism. The ad, taken out by 
the Rev. J.J. Barfield, a staunch Lyons' supporter, said Lyons was 
convicted by a racist jury in a racist state. 
</P>
<P>
	``It offends me terribly when people who were not here ... take  
it upon themselves to try to put unnecessary unrest in our 
community,'' Schaeffer said from the bench. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got a lot of bad advice ... so I lashed out,'' Lyons said of  
his early reaction to the criminal investigation. But he denied 
approving the newspaper advertisement. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those who spoke on Lyons' behalf was his wife, Deborah.  
</P>
<P>
	``I love my husband very much. We have been through some rough  
times together,'' she said. ``If you can find it in your heart, 
look not at Dr. Lyons in the last three or four years but look at 
the good he brings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons' troubles began in 1997 when his wife set fire to a  
$700,000 waterfront home he owned with Ms. Edwards. The fire led to 
closer scrutiny of Lyons' lavish spending. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons, the pastor of a St. Petersburg church, served as  
president of the National Baptist Convention from 1994 until he 
tearfully resigned that post on March 16, a few weeks after he was 
convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	The next day, he avoided a second trial by pleading guilty in  
federal court to evading taxes, engaging in fraudulent activities 
and lying to officials -- charges that grew out of convention 
business dealings. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Edwards went on trial with Lyons but was acquitted. However,  
she pleaded guilty in federal court to tax evasion and is awaiting 
sentencing Sept. 13. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons' sentencing in federal court is set for June 18. His  
lawyers said he will probably serve a little more than seven years.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Companies Land Deals in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GUANGZHOU, China (AP) -- Four American companies landed  
telecommunications deals Thursday as U.S. Commerce Secretary 
William Daley wrapped up a trade mission to get China to drop 
market barriers. 
</P>
<P>
	The contract signings, worth a total of $141 million, followed a  
speech Daley gave on China's telecommunications sector. Daley has 
urged Chinese leaders to open up the sector, raising the issue 
Monday in Beijing with Premier Zhu Rongji. China has been reluctant 
to allow foreigners in. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday's deals mainly involved sales of telecommunications  
equipment. They included $100 million in sales by Motorola Inc., 
and a $41 million purchase by China's postal bureau of equipment to 
help automate its operations. 
</P>
<P>
	The deals didn't include an anticipated agreement to open up the  
telecommunications sector by permitting overseas investment into a 
digital phone network. 
</P>
<P>
	Daley said Zhu indicated to him Monday that China would allow  
more foreign investment in its restricted telecommunications 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Daley said Washington and Beijing were ``unlikely''  
to agree on China's bid to join the World Trade Organization before 
a planned visit to the United States by Zhu next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite recent progress, ``serious differences remain,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Daley's downbeat assessment came two days after a top U.S. trade  
negotiator left Beijing saying there were ``substantial gaps'' 
between the two sides on terms for China's entry into the 
rule-making body for global trade. Daley had said earlier in the 
week he was ``cautiously optimistic'' that a deal could be reached.

<HEADLINE> AMP Shareholders OK Tyco Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) -- The chairman and chief executive officer  
of AMP Inc. resigned Thursday after a majority of shareholders 
agreed to an $11.3 billion merger with Tyco International Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Ripp, 58, had been expected to join Tyco's management  
team as president of AMP and a member of Tyco's board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripp, who was an IBM executive before joining AMP, said he  
wanted to pursue other opportunities. His resignation is effective 
April 30. 
</P>
<P>
	He was named head of the Harrisburg-based company last July  
after a drop in earnings and the elimination of thousands of jobs 
compelled the board of directors to shake up top management. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripp was given the mission of turning the world's leading  
manufacturer of electronic devices around, but found himself 
fighting a $10 billion hostile takeover from AlliedSignal Inc. of 
Morristown, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripp announced his resignation after 99 percent of the voting  
shareholders agreed to merge with Bermuda-based Tyco, a diversified 
manufacturing and service company.

<HEADLINE> India Choppers Drop Quake Relief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GWAI, India (AP) -- Army helicopters were dropping food Thursday  
to remote villages leveled earlier this week by a powerful 
earthquake in northern India. Residents complained that help wasn't 
coming fast enough. 
</P>
<P>
	Many village elders walked several miles up the winding mountain  
roads to district officials in Chamoli, near the epicenter of 
Monday's magnitude 6.8 quake, and submitted requests for tents. But 
they returned dejected. 
</P>
<P>
	``The officials asked us to go back and wait for the help to  
arrive,'' said Ranvir Lal, a 63-year-old stonecutter. 
</P>
<P>
	Mild tremors continued to shake the region and unnerve the  
residents Thursday. Many people were still sleeping in the streets, 
in playgrounds, or wherever they could find shelter. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief Minister Kalyan Singh, the highest elected official in  
Uttar Pradesh state, where the quake was centered, said he appealed 
to the federal government for $70 million in emergency funds. 
</P>
<P>
	``The relief work is not going as fast as I want,'' Singh told a  
reporter in Lucknow, the state capital. ``We don't have the money. 
We are a cash-starved state,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The government has confirmed 100 deaths from Monday's quake, but  
witnesses say more bodies were found in remote villages and the 
toll was at least 110. About 350 people were injured and 2,500 
houses were destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
	A 5.0-magnitude aftershock toppled more houses early Wednesday,  
injuring at least 50 people in the town of Nandprayag. 
</P>
<P>
	Associated Press journalists were the first outsiders to reach  
four remote villages Wednesday, where residents begged for help. 
</P>
<P>
	In Gwai, a 1,500-foot climb above the nearest road, 30-year-old  
Bimla Devi was living in a tattered plastic tent next to the ruins 
of her house. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is our exile,'' she said. ``We will live here until we  
die.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Indian Red Cross Society sent a first relief shipment of  
tarpaulins, blankets, clothing, rice and food for 500 people, and 
said it asked Red Cross headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland, for 
$95,000 for further efforts.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Mixed; Dow Up 14.71 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed today as investors adjusted  
their portfolios ahead of the long holiday weekend and a jobs 
report due out Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	At 3 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
up 14.71 at 9,800.87. The blue-chip index rose nearly 54 points in 
early trading before falling back and then recovering again. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500  
index was up 3.09 at 1,289 46, and the Nasdaq composite index was 
up 17.06 at 2,478.46. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks advanced early on a spate of merger news, then backed off  
in tandem with bonds as strong economic reports stirred inflation 
concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	Many investors in both the stock and bond markets were trading  
carefully ahead of the long holiday weekend. Financial markets will 
be closed Friday in observance of Good Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Many are nervous about the continuing U.S. military presence in  
Yugoslavia and worry that the situation could escalate over the 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think you can make much'' of this afternoon's  
recovery,'' said Ricky Harrington, technical analyst at 
Interstate/Johnson Lane in Charlotte, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's just a little more caution in the air, and people are  
going into the long weekend trying to not have a great deal of 
exposure either on the up or down side. When the Dow's at 9,800, it 
doesn't take much of a movement in a few Dow stocks to put the 
market up 20 pr 30 points.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yahoo! announced a $5.7 billion planned purchase of  
Broadcast.com, sending Yahoo! shares up 5 5/16 at 173 113/16, while 
Broadcast.com rose 9 1/16 at 127 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	BP Amoco announced plans to buy Atlantic Richfield for $26.6  
billion, a deal that would create the world's second-largest oil 
company. And CBS said it would pay $2.5 billion for King World 
Productions, the largest TV-syndication company. 
</P>
<P>
	The gains evaporated after the National Association of  
Purchasing Management reported its monthly index of business 
activity rose to 54.3 percent last month, an increase of 1.9 
percentage points from its February level. 
</P>
<P>
	In another sign of economic vigor, the Commerce Department  
reported construction spending jumped a much-stronger-than-expected 
2.2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The department also reported personal income increased a  
seasonally adjusted 0.5 percent in February after a 0.6 percent 
gain in January. Consumer spending, meanwhile, jumped 0.7 percent 
after a 0.4 percent rise the previous month. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond prices fell on the inflation concerns. The yield on the  
30-year Treasury rose to 5.68 percent from 5.62 late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>

managers report and construction spending were stronger than 
expected, and that hit bonds, and then stocks went over,'' said

<HEADLINE>  Dodgers May Leave Vero Beach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VERO BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- The Los Angeles Dodgers have completed  
their 51st year of spring training in Vero Beach. It might have 
been their last. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dodgers, who first set up camp in this quiet coastal city in  
1948 -- 10 years before they moved from Brooklyn to Los Angeles -- 
are considering a move to Fort McDowell, Ariz., near Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fort McDowell Indian Community has offered to build the  
Dodgers a 12,500-seat stadium, five or six practice fields and 
housing if the team decides to leave Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	The team, which headed home to Los Angeles on Wednesday, is  
expected to make a decision in about a month. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just being here this year I got a taste of what it feels like  
to be at Dodgertown, and I've always admired playing here,'' said 
left fielder Gary Sheffield, traded to the Dodgers last May. ``You 
have to feel for the people here, and you want to give them what 
they want, but you also have to look at the other side. Hopefully 
both sides can work it out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	City and county officials in Vero Beach have been negotiating  
with the Dodgers for about a year on how to keep the team at their 
current training site, generally considered the most traditional 
and fan-friendly in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	A Florida Senate bill introduced last week would provide $7.5  
million in the next two years to renovate Dodgertown and help keep 
the team in Vero Beach. 
</P>
<P>
	Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone is optimistic that the team  
will stay in Florida, though he said the site needs upgrading to 
match Fort McDowell's offer. 
</P>
<P>
	``People call me the eternal optimist, but I'm leaving some  
stuff behind,'' Malone said Wednesday as he packed up his 
Dodgertown office. ``I'm hoping it will be here when I get back. 
I'm not looking at it as though this is my last time here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A crowd of 4,717 fans, about 700 below this spring's average,  
watched the Houston Astros beat the Dodgers 6-4 in Wednesday's 
finale at Holman Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Bud Holman, a local businessman, invited the Dodgers to set up  
camp in Vero Beach in 1948 after it was decided the city needed a 
tenant to occupy the former World War II naval air station. 
</P>
<P>
	The last game didn't feature any special ceremonies, but about  
250 fans attended a postgame sendoff sponsored by a local committee 
hoping to keep the Dodgers in Vero Beach. 
</P>
<P>
	Sonny Jones, a middle-aged fan who grew up in Vero Beach,  
recalled attending games with his brother as a youngster after 
school. 
</P>
<P>
	``It'll be sad if they go,'' Jones said. ``I understand where  
they're coming from. Economics is economics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe so, but Ed Niedziela, a resident of nearby Sebastian, said  
he felt frustrated ``because it's just a financial thing, and the 
tradition isn't even a concern.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Bagwell and Carl Everett hit back-to-back solo homers with  
two outs in the first off Dodgers ace Kevin Brown, and Bagwell hit 
another solo shot off Brown in the fourth when the Astros scored 
three times to take a 5-4 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown, in his final appearance before he faces the Arizona  
Diamondbacks next Monday in the season-opener, allowed five runs, 
four earned, on seven hits in five innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Young and Sheffield homered for the Dodgers.  
</P>
<P>
	Todd Hundley, who missed most of last season after undergoing  
reconstructive surgery on his right elbow late in 1997, caught 
back-to-back games for the first time all spring and said he felt 
fine despite going 0-for-3 at the plate. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything was good,'' Hundley said. ``This was something we  
wanted to get accomplished to check everything out, and things 
worked out fine.''

<HEADLINE> Tommy Morrison Pleads Guilty to DUI </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TULSA, Okla. (AP) -- Tommy Morrison, who at one time held the  
fringe World Boxing Organization's heavyweight title, pleaded 
guilty Thursday to a drunken-driving charge and two other traffic 
misdemeanors. 
</P>
<P>
	Tulsa County District Court Special Judge Kyle Haskins ordered a  
pre-sentencing background report and scheduled sentencing for July 
1. The maximum possible punishment on the three counts combined is 
2 years, 10 days in jail. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said Morrison, who recently spent time in Delaware  
County's jail for a 1997 impaired driving offense, did not have a 
sentencing agreement with prosecutors before entering a guilty plea 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant district attorney Caleb Raynolds said prosecutors  
wanted some jail time as part of any plea agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Morrison, 30, was charged July 17 with driving under the  
influence of alcohol, driving while his license was revoked and 
failing to stop at a red light. 
</P>
<P>
	Morrison was arrested by Broken Arrow police July 16. The Jay  
native listed a Bixby address then, but indicated Thursday that he 
now lives in Fayetteville, Ark. 
</P>
<P>
	Morrison missed a March 3 court date on the Tulsa County charges  
because he was in a treatment program as part of his punishment in 
the Delaware County case. His Thursday appearance was four days 
earlier than scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
	Morrison became the WBO heavyweight champion in 1993 by  
defeating George Foreman. He lost the title later that year and 
retired from boxing in 1996.

<HEADLINE> 'Smart' Parties Abound With Kid Set </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Dr. Peter Kranz led his young charges through  
rain and mud in search of the ancient secrets buried in a former 
suburban junkyard. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've found a tooth,'' one 8-year-old dinosaur hunter  
announced. 
</P>
<P>
	``No,'' said Kranz, a local paleontologist, shaking the water  
off the wide brim of his hat. ``That's just a rock.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The recent dig, where about 20 youngsters learned about dinosaur  
bones and other fossils, was more than an adventure; it was a 
birthday party. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is exciting, and plus I know they're learning  
something,'' said Alex Sacks, who held plastic baggies of rocks and 
dirt as she watched her son, Benjamin, the 8-year-old birthday boy, 
poke through the mud with friends. 
</P>
<P>
	As more parents seek children's parties that come with a lesson,  
zoos and museums increasingly are moving into the lucrative 
birthday-party market, once dominated by restaurants and arcades. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of parents really seem to want education over clowns,''  
said Kathy Burkholder of Kathy's Critters in Redondo Beach, Calif. 
``They prefer getting their money's worth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Burkholder's live animal-education program, which also travels  
to schools, includes two emperor scorpions named Nero and Napoleon; 
Medusa, a 10-foot Burmese python; and Bubba, an American bullfrog 
who ``looks exactly like the frog in the beer commercial.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For $10 to $15 a child, partygoers handle the animals and learn  
such facts as that reptiles are dry and scaly, while amphibians are 
wet and slippery. 
</P>
<P>
	The current focus on student tests and performance is leading  
parents to seek out such opportunities and take charge of their 
children's learning, said parent Pam Hawkins. 
</P>
<P>
	Her daughter, Ashley, spent her sixth birthday at the Capital  
Children's Museum here, making Japanese carp kites and learning 
simple greetings in Japanese. The fee was $200 for up to 15 
children, and included a daylong museum visit. 
</P>
<P>
	``The more education she has, the more opportunities will open  
up for her,'' Hawkins said. ``I just want to know the educational 
choices we make are best for her, so that down the road we have no 
regrets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Parents also find they are more likely to stay for the  
educational parties, said father Rene LaVigne, who attends ``a 
party nearly every weekend'' with 7-year-old son Rene Jr. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're not just dropping off the child and leaving,'' he said  
at the Hawkins party. ``Parents get more into these parties.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among the growing options:  
</P>
<P>
	--Naper Settlement in the Chicago suburb of Naperville, Ill.,  
offers pioneer- or Victorian-style celebrations with craft 
activities and visits to a log cabin or Victorian home. 
</P>
<P>
	--Davis' Farmland in Sterling, Mass., features overnight birthday  
parties with a campfire, hayride and chances to feed animals. 
</P>
<P>
	--Santa Fe Community College in New Mexico holds parties at its  
planetarium in which the birthday child gets a star adopted in his 
or her name, complete with certificate. 
</P>
<P>
	Education is even becoming a part of traditionally lighter  
markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Chuck E. Cheese, a chain of 300 pizza parlors, holds nearly 1  
million birthday parties a year featuring video games and skits 
with dancing characters. In recent years, Chuck E., a large fuzzy 
mouse, has added bicycle safety and good nutrition to his ``happy 
birthday'' repertoire. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, ``The primary reason they come is just to have fun,''  
said Jon Rice, spokesman for the parent company, CEC Entertainment 
in Irving, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Fun for fun's sake is not so bad, say some child experts.  
</P>
<P>
	``There are quite a few 4- and 5-year-olds who would be just as  
happy in a park with their friends, going down slides and rolling 
in the sand box,'' says Judith T. Wagner, a professor of child 
development and education at Whittier College in Whittier, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Parents should not overdo birthdays regardless of their  
educational value, Wagner said, adding that simple experiences such 
walking in the wood and identifying trees can be just as enriching 
and fun. 
</P>
<P>
	Deborah Sampson, who owns a children's activity center in  
Bethesda, Md., agrees. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a fine line. After all, you don't want it to be school,''  
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	At her Smarty Parties, which run about $15 a child, children use  
computers to design paper models of cars, trucks and houses, as 
well to compose music and draw. Cake and ice cream and goodie bags 
are included. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it's done the right way, parents feel better and the kids  
have fun,'' Sampson says.

<HEADLINE> Time To Set Clocks Ahead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Those long evenings, perfect for cookouts and  
sports, return Sunday with the start of daylight-saving time. 
</P>
<P>
	Daylight time returns at 2 a.m. for a stay of nearly seven  
months as clocks are turned forward an hour. 
</P>
<P>
	Remember, spring forward.  
</P>
<P>
	Most people will make the change before retiring Saturday night  
-- especially those who want to avoid being late for church on 
Easter Sunday. Standard time returns Oct. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	The law allows states and U.S. territories to exempt themselves  
from daylight time, and the clock-changing ritual is not observed 
in Arizona, Hawaii, the part of Indiana in the Eastern time zone, 
Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands or American Samoa. 
</P>
<P>
	Safety officials note that the time for changing clocks also is  
a good time to replace the batteries in smoke detectors.

<HEADLINE> Green Candidate Wins in Calif. Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Audie Elizabeth Bock decided to run for  
the California Assembly with the backing of the Green Party, going 
up against a well-known former Oakland mayor who outspent her 20-1. 
</P>
<P>
	Bock, whose last bid for office was a campaign for high school  
class secretary, appears to have pulled off the upset. 
</P>
<P>
	If Wednesday's results are confirmed, Bock will be the first  
Green Party member in the nation to win state office, shocking 
Democratic political veteran Elihu Harris in a runoff election. 
</P>
<P>
	Unofficial results gave Bock a winning margin of about 300  
votes, with some ballots still to be counted. Official results were 
expected Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bock said her apparent victory showed voters were unhappy with  
their elected officials. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that in itself indicates there is a change going on,  
that people are not satisfied by what the two major parties have to 
offer,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris, who was mayor for eight years and had served 12 years in  
the Legislature, appeared stunned. 
</P>
<P>
	``After 20 years in politics, this is the first time that I've  
suffered an election loss,'' he said. ``But obviously, if you 
accept the will of the voters when you win, you must also accept it 
when you lose.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Green Party members exulted over Bock's showing against Harris,  
51. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think you're going to see a lot more Greens running for  
office in the year 2000,'' said Nancy Marmol, spokeswoman for the 
Green Party of California. ``We think this proves that people will 
vote for a Green Party candidate when there's a hope that the Green 
Party candidate will win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bock, 53, is a single mother of one who teaches at a community  
college and runs a small foreign language film distribution 
business from her home in Piedmont, a small city next to Oakland. 
She campaigned on a promise of more school funding, universal 
health care and closing corporate tax loopholes. 
</P>
<P>
	Her party is similar in philosophy to Green parties in various  
European countries, sharing goals such as feminism, decentralized 
authority, nonviolence and environmental consciousness. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's important to us because she's shown to the public she's  
a person who is electable,'' said her campaign treasurer, Dan 
Marsh. ``There's a stereotype of Green Party members as being 
hippie tree-huggers.''

<HEADLINE> Congress Resists Recycling Effort </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Nearly a decade after recycling began on  
Capitol Hill, many congressional offices still aren't separating 
the paper and aluminum cans from the lunch trash. Even the House 
chairman who oversees environmental issues on public lands has 
turned his back on the effort. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Don Young, R-Alaska, said his office separated recyclables  
only to see the effort go to waste because of sloppy practices. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the time, the garbage was being separated by our office. It  
was later then placed in the same garbage bag by the cleaning 
folks, and it didn't seem as if it was being recycled,'' the 
chairman of the House Resources Committee said through a spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	Even high-grade white paper, the most lucrative product to  
recycle, isn't being widely sorted. For instance, the House earned 
$25,000 for that recycling in fiscal 1998 -- far short of the 
$150,000 that could be earned if 60 percent of the product was 
sorted, according to the chamber's former recycling coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
	Recycling advocates are frustrated that some on Capitol Hill  
ignore the program entirely while others recycle halfheartedly. 
It's the byproduct of an institution where the 535 lawmakers set 
the rules for each individual office and committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``The most stubborn bureaucracy in America is Congress itself,''  
said Rep. Sam Farr, D-Calif., a recycling supporter. ``There's 
never been an attitude that we should have to do that. No one is 
responsible inside an office. Some offices take it seriously and 
some don't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The recycling difficulties are the latest example of a Congress  
that is having trouble following the laws and regulations that 
apply to the rest of Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, The Associated Press reported that inspectors  
appointed to ensure Congress obeys the same workplace safety rules 
as corporate America found numerous violations, including 
unprotected workers digging through contaminated trash, high 
concentrations of Legionnaires' disease bacteria in one building 
and improper storage of flammable chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
	Many U.S. cities and counties, as well as the executive branch  
of the federal government, require recycling. But Congress has kept 
its program voluntary. The recycling effort is under control of the 
architect of the Capitol, whose 2,000 employees maintain 
congressional buildings. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1997 survey of the 435 House offices found that nearly a dozen  
refused to participate and that many others failed to keep their 
promise. 
</P>
<P>
	``The problem is, it's a totally voluntary program,'' said Herb  
Franklin, administrative assistant in the architect's office. 
``There are 535 employing offices and each sets the criteria for 
its office.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To enforce recycling, Franklin said, ``you would have to have  
policing, and what would you do if people didn't comply? What are 
we supposed to do if an apple core is in a container with white 
paper?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Also, staff turnover is pretty rapid. Our situation is not to  
be compared with a private employer or the executive branch,'' 
Franklin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite past setbacks, the architect's executive officer, Lynne  
Theiss, said her agency is making another attempt at improving 
Congress' record. In a pilot project started last August and set to 
expand, some offices have been given separate containers for 
high-grade white paper, a lower-grade mixed paper, cans and bottles 
and pure garbage. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of Congress' mixed trash is now compressed and taken away  
by a recycling company, which pays for sorted white paper but 
nothing for material that is ``contaminated'' with garbage and 
other refuse. 
</P>
<P>
	The House earned only $959 in fiscal 1996 from recycled paper,  
and that total fell to a minuscule $7.51 in fiscal 1997 before 
rebounding to more than $25,000 in fiscal 1998, said the General 
Services Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1998 improvement came after the House, in August 1997, hired  
a former paper industry consultant, Patricia Dollar, to be its 
recycling coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
	In an internal report in late 1997, Ms. Dollar said Congress  
could have earned $150,000 that year if 60 percent of its 
high-grade paper had been recycled at market prices. 
</P>
<P>
	But Ms. Dollar never met that goal. She was fired in February  
1998 from her $25,600 position after seven months on the job. 
</P>
<P>
	She alleged in an interview she was dismissed after refusing a  
superior's order to use ``evasive'' language in response to a 
congressman's complaints about problems in the recycling effort. 
The architect's office declined to address her allegation, citing 
ongoing litigation involving Ms. Dollar.

<HEADLINE> Mich. Fines Over Fireworks Blast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- The state fined a fireworks factory  
$562,500 today for worker safety violations in a December explosion 
that left seven people dead. 
</P>
<P>
	The fine comes three days after another explosion that killed  
five people at the Independence Professional Fireworks Co. of 
Osseo, about 80 miles southwest of Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	The fine was related only to the December blast and was based on  
employee interviews because so little physical evidence was left, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The General Industry Safety Division fined the company for 23  
violations, including failing to train workers on how to handle 
hazardous chemicals. The company has 15 working days to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	After Monday's explosion, company founder William Richardson  
said the factory won't reopen. Investigators did not known the 
cause of either blast. 
</P>
<P>
	The brother of one of the December victims was arraigned  
Thursday after police said he violated a personal protection order 
by phoning Richardson. Richardson filed the order in January, 
saying Jeffery A. Gates, 40, threatened to blow up the factory and 
harm him.

<HEADLINE> Odyssey Channel Reinvents Itself </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Odyssey Channel is making a leap of faith.  
</P>
<P>
	Created in 1988 as a haven for religious programming, the cable  
channel is reinventing itself as a source of family-friendly 
entertainment that intends to remain true to its spiritual roots. 
</P>
<P>
	The combination, according to the channel's market research, is  
what viewers say is most lacking in television and what they most 
crave. Beginning Sunday, Odyssey will learn if people will watch 
what they claim they want. 
</P>
<P>
	``Call me crazy, but I think we're going to be very  
successful,'' said Margaret Loesch, the veteran TV executive who is 
Odyssey's president and chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not minimizing the challenges of being yet another new  
program service, but I think our blend of elements is distinctive 
and unique.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new Odyssey is not a mom-and-pop operation. Two  
heavyweights, Hallmark Entertainment and Jim Henson Co. (bearing 
the name of its late founder, the Muppet creator), became Odyssey 
partners last year with a $100 million stake. 
</P>
<P>
	Hallmark and Henson bring to the table the mainstay of Odyssey's  
revised schedule: their rich program and movie libraries. Added to 
the mix will be at least 30 hours a week of shows focusing on faith 
and values. 
</P>
<P>
	The religious programs are produced by the National Interfaith  
Cable Coalition Inc., which founded the venture previously called 
the Faith &AMP; Values Channel. The coalition is made up of nearly 80 
Christian and Jewish groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those programs: ``Quiet Triumphs,'' a celebrity interview  
series with host Mary Alice Williams; the gospel music and variety 
``CeCe's Place'' with CeCe Wynans; and ``30 Minutes,'' featuring 
sermons from Protestant, Catholic and Jewish leaders. The channel 
also offers Daily Mass from St. Anne's Shrine in Scranton, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	From Hallmark, the contributions are led by its ``Hall of Fame''  
movies, including the recent August Wilson Pulitzer Prize-winning 
play, ``The Piano Lesson,'' starring Alfre Woodard, and ``What the 
Deaf Man Heard,'' with Matthew Modine, and such golden oldies as 
``Harvey'' (a 1972 remake with Jimmy Stewart of his 1950 movie). 
</P>
<P>
	A collection of director Hal Roach's movies, including Laurel  
and Hardy comedies and other vintage films, also is owned by 
Hallmark. Film critic Leonard Maltin will be host of a daily 
showing of Roach's movies and comedy shorts. 
</P>
<P>
	The shows from Henson Co.'s shelves include ``Jim Henson's  
Muppet Babies,'' ``Fraggle Rock,'' ``ALF'' and ``Mother Goose 
Stories.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New programming, expected to make up at least one-quarter of the  
Odyssey schedule within five years, will be produced exclusively by 
Hallmark, Henson, Odyssey Productions and the coalition. 
</P>
<P>
	The network debuts in its new form 6 p.m. EST Sunday with a  
showing of ``Gulliver's Travels,'' the Jim Henson Productions 
miniseries starring Ted Danson that was a ratings success when it 
first aired on NBC in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	But will viewers return for a second bite of such fare, popular  
though it was the first time around? PAX TV, another new 
family-oriented channel that relies on recycled programs such as 
``Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman,'' has found it rough to build ratings. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite PAX's early results, there is an unmet demand for  
family-oriented programming -- witness the rise of WB's 
fresh-scrubbed family drama ``7th Heaven.'' And Odyssey does have 
an edge, according to an industry analyst. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've got some terrific programs in that Henson and Hallmark  
have been associated with quality for decades,'' said Janeen Bjork 
of New York-based Seltel, which advises TV station clients on 
program purchases. 
</P>
<P>
	``But they've got the same challenge any cable network does in  
our constantly multiplying numbers of choices: That is, you've got 
to be distinctive,'' Bjork said. 
</P>
<P>
	Loesch says the Henson-Hallmark library ensures that, along with  
the faith programming. The channel is available in nearly 30 
million homes, which puts it in the league of Bravo (35 million 
homes) and Court TV (34 million). 
</P>
<P>
	The goal is to reach 54 million cable subscribers. By  
comparison, A&AMP;E, Discovery and USA Network are in 70 million to 78 
million homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Loesch, who was the founding president and later vice chairman  
of Fox's highly successful children's network before joining Henson 
in its Odyssey venture, said she initially cringed at the idea of 
making a religious channel a partner. 
</P>
<P>
	She equated religion on TV with moneymaking televangelism, she  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Odyssey, however, was begun in 1988 as an effort to redefine  
religious programming, said Father Bob Bonnot, a Roman Catholic 
priest who helped launch it under its original name, Vision 
Interfaith Satellite Network. (Liberty Media Corp. became a joint 
owner in 1995.) 
</P>
<P>
	The goal in providing an alternative to the Jim Bakker-Jimmy  
Swaggart TV model was to deliver ``the kind of messages our faith 
groups try to teach people,'' Bonnot said -- tolerance, peace, and 
respect for the Earth's environment, among them. 
</P>
<P>
	The Henson and Hallmark programs are not overtly religious but  
contain themes consistent with those messages, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Acknowledging that the coalition had to surrender programming  
hours as part of the new schedule, Bonnot said the attitude is an 
upbeat ``less is more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We have less time on a channel that has a much stronger  
carriage and viewership, allowing us to reach more eyeballs, hearts 
and souls. The coalition entered this partnership happily and is 
very enthusiastic.''

<HEADLINE>  Dodgers May Leave Vero Beach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VERO BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- The Los Angeles Dodgers have completed  
their 51st year of spring training in Vero Beach. It might have 
been their last. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dodgers, who first set up camp in this quiet coastal city in  
1948 -- 10 years before they moved from Brooklyn to Los Angeles -- 
are considering a move to Fort McDowell, Ariz., near Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fort McDowell Indian Community has offered to build the  
Dodgers a 12,500-seat stadium, five or six practice fields and 
housing if the team decides to leave Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	The team, which headed home to Los Angeles on Wednesday, is  
expected to make a decision in about a month. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just being here this year I got a taste of what it feels like  
to be at Dodgertown, and I've always admired playing here,'' said 
left fielder Gary Sheffield, traded to the Dodgers last May. ``You 
have to feel for the people here, and you want to give them what 
they want, but you also have to look at the other side. Hopefully 
both sides can work it out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	City and county officials in Vero Beach have been negotiating  
with the Dodgers for about a year on how to keep the team at their 
current training site, generally considered the most traditional 
and fan-friendly in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	A Florida Senate bill introduced last week would provide $7.5  
million in the next two years to renovate Dodgertown and help keep 
the team in Vero Beach. 
</P>
<P>
	Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone is optimistic that the team  
will stay in Florida, though he said the site needs upgrading to 
match Fort McDowell's offer. 
</P>
<P>
	``People call me the eternal optimist, but I'm leaving some  
stuff behind,'' Malone said Wednesday as he packed up his 
Dodgertown office. ``I'm hoping it will be here when I get back. 
I'm not looking at it as though this is my last time here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A crowd of 4,717 fans, about 700 below this spring's average,  
watched the Houston Astros beat the Dodgers 6-4 in Wednesday's 
finale at Holman Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Bud Holman, a local businessman, invited the Dodgers to set up  
camp in Vero Beach in 1948 after it was decided the city needed a 
tenant to occupy the former World War II naval air station. 
</P>
<P>
	The last game didn't feature any special ceremonies, but about  
250 fans attended a postgame sendoff sponsored by a local committee 
hoping to keep the Dodgers in Vero Beach. 
</P>
<P>
	Sonny Jones, a middle-aged fan who grew up in Vero Beach,  
recalled attending games with his brother as a youngster after 
school. 
</P>
<P>
	``It'll be sad if they go,'' Jones said. ``I understand where  
they're coming from. Economics is economics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe so, but Ed Niedziela, a resident of nearby Sebastian, said  
he felt frustrated ``because it's just a financial thing, and the 
tradition isn't even a concern.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Bagwell and Carl Everett hit back-to-back solo homers with  
two outs in the first off Dodgers ace Kevin Brown, and Bagwell hit 
another solo shot off Brown in the fourth when the Astros scored 
three times to take a 5-4 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown, in his final appearance before he faces the Arizona  
Diamondbacks next Monday in the season-opener, allowed five runs, 
four earned, on seven hits in five innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Young and Sheffield homered for the Dodgers.  
</P>
<P>
	Todd Hundley, who missed most of last season after undergoing  
reconstructive surgery on his right elbow late in 1997, caught 
back-to-back games for the first time all spring and said he felt 
fine despite going 0-for-3 at the plate. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything was good,'' Hundley said. ``This was something we  
wanted to get accomplished to check everything out, and things 
worked out fine.''

<HEADLINE> Lewinsky Inquiry Cost More Than $6M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Boosted by the millions he spent looking into  
the Monica Lewinsky affair, Kenneth Starr's investigation of 
President Clinton and his wife is about to become the most 
expensive independent counsel inquiry ever. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's expenditures totaled $6.2 million in the six months  
through Sept. 30, when the Lewinsky investigation was going full 
speed, pushing the cost of the independent counsel's 4 1/2-year 
inquiry of the president and Hillary Rodham Clinton to nearly $40 
million, according to figures released Wednesday by the 
congressional General Accounting Office. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr replaced prosecutor Robert Fiske, who already had spent $6  
million investigating the Clintons' Whitewater real estate dealings 
and other matters. 
</P>
<P>
	The most expensive independent counsel investigation to date was  
Lawrence Walsh's $48.5 million, six-year probe of the Reagan 
administration regarding its arms and money deals with Iran and its 
secret war against the communist-led government of Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
	The former Iran-Contra prosecutor said Starr's costs would jump  
by many millions of dollars when he concludes his investigation, 
because legal costs for witnesses would be included at that point. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure that Starr will exceed me (in costs) before he's  
through,'' Walsh said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Walsh said that under the independent counsel law, people who  
were subjects of Starr's investigation but who were never indicted 
are entitled to reimbursement from the government for legal costs. 
Among the many people who may fit into that category are the 
president -- who was impeached but not indicted -- and Mrs. Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Elizabeth Ray, a spokeswoman for Starr, said, ``The monumental  
effort required to conduct the investigation of Monica Lewinsky and 
others required unusual commitments of resources.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And White House spokesman Jim Kennedy said, ``Our concerns about  
the exorbitant expense of the independent counsel's investigation 
are well known, but we'll let this latest report speak for 
itself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The cost of investigating top administration officials during  
the Clinton era now tops $76 million, according to the GAO's 
figures. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's $6.2 million expenditure in the six months through Sept.  
30 was up nearly 60 percent from the $3.9 million in the previous 
six months, the GAO said. 
</P>
<P>
	The report did not cover costs for the first 2 1/2 months of  
Starr's investigation into the presidential affair with Ms. 
Lewinsky and the cover-up. Starr opened the Lewinsky investigation 
in mid-January 1998. The latest GAO figures start on April 1, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The GAO totals do not break out Starr's costs for other aspects  
of his investigation, such as the prosecutions of Clinton friend 
Webster Hubbell and Whitewater partner Susan McDougal. But those 
investigations pale in size and intensity to the Lewinsky case, 
which involved a massive grand jury inquiry that lasted seven 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr wrapped up the Lewinsky investigation on Sept. 9, 1998,  
with a report to Congress detailing 11 possible grounds for 
impeaching the president for lying and obstruction. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial of Mrs. McDougal in Arkansas on contempt and  
obstruction charges is in its fourth week. Mrs. McDougal was 
investigated and indicted last May, a cost that would be included 
in the latest financial figures for Starr's operation. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr has two court cases pending against Hubbell, one for  
income tax evasion, the other for obstructing federal regulators 
looking into the failure of the savings and loan owned by the 
Clintons' Whitewater partners. Both those cases were in the 
investigative stage in the months covered by the latest 
expenditures. 
</P>
<P>
	Independent counsels during the Clinton administration have  
investigated former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy, former Housing 
Secretary Henry Cisneros, Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt and 
Labor Secretary Alexis Herman.

<HEADLINE> Gore Raises $7 Million, Bush Raises $6 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In the race for money, presidential hopefuls  
George Bush and Al Gore are staking out huge early leads that far 
surpass the early totals for the previous wide-open race for the 
White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore has raised at least $7 million so far this year for his bid  
for the Democratic nomination, aides close to his campaign said. 
Gore tapped more than 40,000 donors, 77 percent of whom gave less 
than $200 each, said the aides, who expect the final figure to be 
slightly higher because money was still rolling in Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The vice president's total is double the expected $3  
million-plus that his lone Democratic challenger, former senator 
and professional basketball star Bill Bradley, expects to report 
for the same period, according to Bradley aides. 
</P>
<P>
	In Austin, Texas, Gov. Bush announced he has been raising money  
at a $2 million-a-week clip since he formed his presidential 
exploratory committee March 4 and will finish the month with more 
than $6 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The total is eye-catching because the Texas governor, unlike  
Gore, has not hosted a single fund-raiser yet or even formally 
announced his candidacy. All of the GOP hopeful's money was raised 
through telephone and mail appeals, his aides said. Gore has had 
four fund-raising events so far. 
</P>
<P>
	The total is also important because Bush, if he runs, is  
considering forgoing federal financing provided to presidential 
candidates in the primaries so he can free himself from spending 
limits and better compete with millionaire publisher Steve Forbes 
for the GOP nomination. Forbes is spending much of his own money 
and has not provided his fund-raising totals. 
</P>
<P>
	To forgo federal matching funds, experts predict Bush will have  
to raise $50 million or more, substantially more than the $30 
million President Clinton raised as a popular incumbent in his 
primary re-election in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a great start, but I recognize that we have a lot of  
work ahead,'' Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other potential GOP presidential candidates such as Sen. John  
McCain of Arizona, former Vice President Dan Quayle, conservative 
activist Gary Bauer and former Red Cross chairwoman Elizabeth Dole 
are all expected to finish the first three months of 1999 with $3 
million or less in fund raising. 
</P>
<P>
	Both the Texas governor and Gore have raised money far faster  
than former President Bush did in the first quarter of 1987 when, 
as the vice president vying to replace Ronald Reagan in an open 
race, he raised $2.4 million and was the top fund-raiser in either 
party. 
</P>
<P>
	The record for the first three months of a two-year presidential  
election cycle still belongs to Texas Sen. Phil Gramm, who raised 
more than $8 million in the first quarter of 1995 for a GOP 
presidential bid that eventually stalled and died. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gore and Bush efforts continue a trend over the last decade  
in which candidates raise money faster and earlier as states have 
compressed their primary election schedules to the early part of 
2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's because the big states involved, California and New York,  
have pushed up their primaries so much and they are very expensive 
states,'' said Herb Alexander, a professor emeritus at the 
University of Southern California who has studied political 
fund-raising for four decades. ``And that is the biggest problem 
for candidates coming out of relatively inexpensive states like 
Iowa and New Hampshire -- there's not enough time to raise money 
after then.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``In 1976, Jimmy Carter had something like five weeks after New  
Hampshire and the next primary and that was the time he could raise 
money, but that doesn't exist anymore,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's campaign is stressing its smaller donations, hoping to  
distance the vice president from the 1996 Clinton fund-raising 
controversies over big donors. ``We have gotten support from people 
of all levels, from farmers to doctors and small business people to 
retired people, and we are very grateful,'' campaign manager Craig 
Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	The presidential candidates will formally report their totals to  
the Federal Election Commission on April 15.

<HEADLINE>  Yeltsin Appeals To End Airstrikes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Warning that the Yugoslav crisis could lead to a  
``grave disaster,'' President Boris Yeltsin on Thursday appealed to 
the G-7 nations to stop the NATO airstrikes and weighed Russian 
plans to send more warships to the Mediterranean. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin called for a meeting of the foreign ministers of the  
Group of Seven leading industrialized nations and Russia on halting 
the NATO attacks. But with all the Group of Seven nations except 
Japan taking part in the assault, it appeared unlikely they would 
agree to such a meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer said the group would  
discuss it and then come to a decision. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States rejected the idea. State Department spokesman  
James P. Rubin said Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is 
already in constant contact with the group's foreign ministers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not sure that an emergency meeting of this kind is  
therefore an appropriate venue for discussion of Kosovo,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian leader issued the invitation in a dramatic  
television address, reiterating his country's demand that NATO 
immediately halt the airstrikes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every lost day brings new victims and tragedies; immediate  
action is needed,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Despite Russia's resolute actions, NATO military action  
against Yugoslavia continues to escalate,'' Yeltsin warned. ``Such 
an escalation threatens to lead to a grave disaster, and not only 
for Europeans. That mustn't be allowed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The government said it would send a warship to the Mediterranean  
on Friday, with several others possibly to follow, to monitor NATO 
military action. 
</P>
<P>
	Turkey, a NATO member that controls the Bosporus -- through which  
Russian ships must pass from the Black Sea to the Mediterranean -- 
said it had agreed to allow eight warships through. 
</P>
<P>
	Four ships could move through the straits this weekend, three  
more on Tuesday and one on April 8. 
</P>
<P>
	The ships' deployment near NATO warships in action against  
Yugoslavia could spark an unintentional confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
	Secretary of State Madeleine Albright expressed American concern  
over the move to Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov by telephone 
late Wednesday. Ivanov said the deployment was intended to ensure 
Russia's security and give Moscow a clear idea of what was 
happening in the region, Russian news reports said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, the Foreign Ministry scoffed at the U.S. fears,  
calling them ``absurd in light of NATO's huge forces in the 
Balkans,'' the Interfax news agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though Russia has decided to deploy ships, Moscow ``has no  
intention of interfering in the current conflict around 
Yugoslavia,'' the ministry said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kremlin has so far walked a thin line between solidarity  
with its Yugoslav ally and confrontation with the West, ignoring 
domestic opponents who have accused the government of weakness and 
have urged sending air-defense missiles and Russian volunteers to 
battle NATO. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet the crisis in Yugoslavia has highlighted the government's  
weak leverage in global affairs. A peace mission headed by Prime 
Minister Yevgeny Primakov to Belgrade on Tuesday failed to produce 
a breakthrough. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia's desire for Western loans to cope with the worst  
economic crisis since the Soviet collapse makes it hard for the 
Kremlin to go beyond words and symbolic steps in defiance of the 
West. So does its own declining economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The once-proud Russian military desperately lacks fuel and other  
basics, and such action as sending a naval squadron to the 
Mediterranean would be a heavy burden for the cash-strapped 
government. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Russian news reports, ships of the Black Sea Fleet  
have rarely left harbor in recent years, and their crews lack 
proper training.

<HEADLINE> Utah Tribe in Nuke Dump Flap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- For Leon Bear and 27 other members of the  
Skull Valley Band of Goshute Indians, home is an 18,000-acre patch 
on the parched alkali flats of Utah's western desert. 
</P>
<P>
	The reservation is tucked between a low-level nuclear waste  
dump, a hazardous waste incinerator, an Army chemical and 
biological testing range, the nation's largest storehouse for 
chemical weapons and an Air Force bombing range. 
</P>
<P>
	Those unsavory neighbors make it hard for the tribe to attract  
jobs, and more and more of the band's members are leaving to find 
work. 
</P>
<P>
	So the tribe decided to make a virtue of its desolation. It  
contracted to temporarily store high-level nuclear waste shunned by 
every other state. 
</P>
<P>
	But the plan has divided the tribe and placed it in conflict  
with state leaders, who say they're worried the dump will become 
permanent. They also shudder at the thought of waste being shipped 
along Interstate 80 and fear the site's proximity to the bombing 
range. 
</P>
<P>
	Legislators have backed Republican Gov. Mike Leavitt in opposing  
the proposed dump, voting for state control over a chain of dirt 
roads around the reservation. 
</P>
<P>
	That would allow the state to block waste shipments on paved  
roads or rail lines that cross the roads if the Nuclear Regulatory 
Commission approves the dump and it begins operating, which could 
happen as soon as 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just don't want it,'' Leavitt said. ``The drawbridge will  
be raised to the waste storage utilities and permission to cross 
refused.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers have also stripped the proposed dump's owners of  
protection from lawsuits that could result from an accident there. 
</P>
<P>
	Bear, the tribal chairman, eyes the jobs, roads, sewer system,  
health clinic and fire station the project backers have promised 
for his tiny reservation 50 miles west of Salt Lake City. He said 
the safety arguments weren't voiced against the other hazardous 
repositories in the area, and raising them now ``is racist.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``All we have is our land,'' Bear said. ``If this economic  
development can be done in balance between the environment, our 
people and private corporations, why not do it?'' 
</P>
<P>
	But one-third of the tribe's adult members don't see it that  
way. They and the state have gone to federal court to challenge the 
lease with the utilities. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are going to be waking up every morning wondering when this  
thing is going to be contaminating our land,'' Margene Bullcreek, a 
Skull Valley Goshute and founder of a group opposed to the 
facility, said in a hearing last year. ``If they tell us they are 
doing us a favor by making millionaires out of us, then why are 
they sacrificing our lives?'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, the tribe signed a potentially lucrative lease with  
Private Fuel Storage, a consortium of eight utilities: Southern 
California Edison, GPU Nuclear Corp., Northern States Power, 
Consolidated Edison of New York, Illinois Power, Indiana Michigan 
Power, Southern Nuclear Operating Co. and Genoatech. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither the tribe nor the consortium will disclose how much the  
tribe would receive. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the plan, 40,000 metric tons of spent reactor rods would  
be stored in concrete casks with 2 1/2-foot-thick walls and placed on 
a concrete pad 3 1/2 miles from a cluster of Goshute homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Only 28 of the band's 119 members live on the reservation, where  
a rocket-testing facility is the main employer. Bear said the 
dump's 200 temporary and 50 permanent jobs are needed to keep more 
members from leaving and further eroding the tribe's heritage. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the lease spans 25 years, with a 25-year option, Bear  
and the consortium point out that it may be just 10 years before 
the Department of Energy opens a permanent nuclear waste 
repository. 
</P>
<P>
	The DOE is looking at burying the waste at Yucca Mountain, 100  
miles northwest of Las Vegas, as early as 2010. But Nevada Gov. 
Kenny Guinn remains vehemently opposed to the plan, which is why 
Leavitt and other Utah officials worry that the Goshutes' dump 
would become permanent. 
</P>
<P>
	Leavitt says the waste should stay at the utilities' reactor  
sites until a permanent repository is found. Scott Northard, the 
project manager for Private Fuel Storage, says that would force the 
reactors to stop operating because they can't store more waste. 
</P>
<P>
	Northard says one big reason for Utah's opposition is fear and  
mistrust stemming in part from open-air nuclear tests in Nevada 
during the 1950s that may have caused cancer in southern Utah 
residents downwind of the explosions. 
</P>
<P>
	Leavitt, a southern Utah native who had friends die of cancer,  
says the state won't back down even if can't stave off the 
utilities in court. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're clearly at a disadvantage in terms of our resources but  
we're not at all disadvantaged in terms of our resolve,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bear has seen a bottled-water company reject the reservation  
because of its inhospitable surroundings. But he says the tribe 
will still try other economic development options if the plans for 
the dump fall through. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to die, that's for sure,'' he said. ``We're  
going to be out there. We've survived all these years and will 
continue to survive.''

<HEADLINE> `Fluff' Will Caddie for Furyk  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Mike ``Fluff'' Cowan will be back at work  
as a caddie in the Masters. Just not for Tiger Woods. 
</P>
<P>
	Golfweek magazine reported on its web site Thursday evening that  
Cowan will be on the bag for Jim Furyk next week at Augusta 
National, and possibly longer than that. 
</P>
<P>
	Furyk, who finished third on the money list last year, fired  
caddie Steve DuPlantis after 4 1/2 years and gave Cowan a call after 
The Players Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had a need, and there wasn't any finer man available,''  
Furyk told Golfweek. ``All the good caddies I know, they all have a 
great player's bag. I needed somebody, and he's the best available. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd have been an idiot not to give Mike a call.''  
</P>
<P>
	Cowan rose to tremendous popularity as the 50-year-old former  
hippie with the thick mustache, carrying the bag for the sleek and 
talented Tiger Woods from the day he turned professional and 
stormed to the top of golf. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods fired Cowan last month, saying it was ``time to move on.''  
</P>
<P>
	While players change caddies all the time, Cowan took on such a  
high-profile role that his split with Woods even got two pages in 
People magazine. The Masters draws hundreds of reporters from 
around the world, and the sight of Cowan on the Augusta fairways 
with someone other than Woods is sure to attract attention. 
</P>
<P>
	Furyk, who tied for fourth in the 1998 Masters, said he is  
prepared for it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Being that his first time back will be at Augusta, it'll  
definitely add a buzz,'' Furyk said. ``But the flip side is that 
I'm also going with a guy who has been there lots of time, many 
more times than I've been there, and going with a guy who has won 
there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Furyk conceded there would be one difference because of Woods'  
length. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure the clubs he pulls for me will be a little different  
than the ones he used to have to pull for him,'' Furyk said.

<HEADLINE> Fans Pay the Cost of Higher Salaries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Baseball fans will be paying the price of higher  
salaries this season, with the average price of a ticket increasing 
9.7 percent, from $13.59 to $14.91. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Sox, whose Fenway Park is the smallest stadium in the  
major leagues, are still the most expensive team to see. Boston 
raised its tickets 16.6 percent to an average of $24.05, according 
to the Team Marketing Report, which released its annual study 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The World Series champion New York Yankees remained second after  
raising prices 13.8 percent to $23.33. The cost of the best box 
seats at Yankee Stadium has risen from $25 in 1996 to $50 this 
season. In addition, the Yankees last year added 60 field-level 
seats that cost $16,000 per season -- $197.53 a game. The price of 
those seats didn't go up this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Seattle, which moves from the Kingdome to Safeco Field on July  
15, had the highest increase, a 27.2 percent rise to $19.01. The 
New York Mets raised prices 23.5 percent to an average of $19.98, 
Philadelphia 21.2 percent to $13.60, the Chicago Cubs 21.1 percent 
to $17.46 and Texas 20.9 percent to $19.93. 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota again has the cheapest average ticket price, even  
after a 2.9 percent increase to $8.46. 
</P>
<P>
	Montreal, which decreased its average price 6 percent to $9.38,  
was 29th and Cincinnati was 28th at $9.71 after a 16 percent 
increase. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the Expos, two other teams lowered their average  
prices, with Oakland going down 4.5 percent to $10.10 and Tampa Bay 
going down 3.1 percent to $15.08. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball's average ticket price has gone up 42.6 percent since  
the 1994 strike, when it was $10.45. The average has increased 72.6 
percent from 1991, when TMR began its annual studies. 
</P>
<P>
	In comparison, the Consumer Price Index has gone up 1.0 percent  
in the last year, 12.1 percent since 1994 and 18.7 percent since 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the increases, baseball tickets remain far cheaper than  
seats for the other major U.S. sports. NFL ticket prices rose 4.7 
percent last season to $42.86, NBA prices went up 3.4 percent this 
season to $42.54 and NHL prices went up 2.5 percent to $42.79. 
</P>
<P>
	NFL tickets have increased 70 percent since 1991 and NBA tickets  
have gone up 83 percent since the 1991-92 season. TMR's NHL studies 
go back only to 1994-95. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fan Cost Index, which includes two average-price tickets,  
two average-price child tickets, four small soft drinks, two small 
beers, four hot dogs, parking, two programs and two adult caps, 
increased 6.8 percent to $121.36. The Yankees remained No. 1 in the 
index at $166.84, followed by Boston ($160.21) and the Mets 
($154.58). 
</P>
<P>
	Montreal had the lowest index at $87.87, with Oakland 29th at  
$92.78 and Milwaukee 28th at $95.81. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL's average was $244.98 last season. The NBA is at $240.26  
this season, the NHL at $238.97.

<HEADLINE> Cubs Sign Nomo to Minor-League Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX, Ariz. (AP) -- Nomo Mania is coming to Wrigley Field.  
Maybe. 
</P>
<P>
	Hideo Nomo, who went from NL Rookie of the Year in 1995 to the  
waiver wire this spring, signed a minor league contract with the 
Chicago Cubs on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The right-hander will get three or four starts to prove himself  
at Triple-A Iowa before the Cubs decide whether to add him to their 
roster or cut him loose. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a win-win situation,'' Cubs manager Jim Riggleman said.  
``Everybody has seen the up side. Hopefully he can regain that 
form, come back and pitch similar to what he used to pitch. He's 
had a rough time the last year, but who knows? Maybe good things 
will come from it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nomo, 30, is 49-41 with a 3.66 ERA in four seasons with the Los  
Angeles Dodgers and the New York Mets. After starring in Japan, he 
joined the Dodgers in 1995 and was nearly unhittable. 
</P>
<P>
	It took him just three seasons to reach 200 strikeouts, and he  
was the fastest pitcher in major league history to get 500 
strikeouts. He pitched a no-hitter in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	But he appeared to lose his touch last season, going 2-7 with  
the Dodgers before being dealt to the Mets in June in a four-player 
deal. He was ineffective this spring, going 0-2 with a 7.62 ERA in 
four appearances. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's been struggling for a while,'' Riggleman said. ``His  
velocity was down, and I don't know what the reason for that is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets finally gave up on Nomo on March 24, sending him  
outright to Triple-A Norfolk and then putting him on unconditional 
release waivers two days later. He became a free agent Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Nomo received $719,262 termination pay from the Mets instead of  
a $2,925,000 salary. He will make a base salary of $800,000 if he's 
added to the Cubs' major league roster, with an additional $2 
million in incentives possible. 
</P>
<P>
	After an extended spring training, he will make three or four  
starts in Iowa. After that, the Cubs must either put him on the 
major league roster or give him his unconditional release. 
</P>
<P>
	While Nomo might not cause the stir he once did -- dozens of  
reporters used to cram the clubhouse when he started and all of his 
games were televised in Japan -- the Cubs welcomed his arrival. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's going to be good for us,'' Sammy Sosa said.  
``He's got pretty good pitches. When they're working, nobody can 
hit him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Grace said Nomo's split-finger fastball is the best he's  
ever seen. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've faced him. I know how dominant he can be,'' Grace said.  
``When he's right, he's outstanding.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nomo made his much-publicized U.S. debut in May 1995 and  
immediately proved he could pitch well in any country. He won the 
NL rookie of the year award, led the league with 236 strikeouts and 
limited opposing batters to a .182 batting average. 
</P>
<P>
	Henry Rodriguez was with the Dodgers when Nomo arrived, and  
shook his head as he remembered the spectacle. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was crazy,'' said Rodriguez, who knows a little something  
about a frenzy after Sosa Mania last year. ``He was like Fernando 
(Valenzuela) in those days. All of the media, all of the time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nomo's no-hitter came Sept. 17, 1996, against Colorado, and he  
finished the year 16-11 with a 3.19 ERA. He finished second in the 
league by holding the opposition to a .216 batting average. It was 
more of the same in 1997, when he recorded 233 strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
	But he struggled last year. Rodriguez said it looked last season  
as if Nomo had lost about 5 mph off his pitches. 
</P>
<P>
	``But he's going to be OK here,'' Rodriguez said. ``He's going  
to feel really comfortable in this place. It's the best place for 
him. He'll have the fans behind him, even if he's struggling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And if Nomo can bolster the Cubs pitching staff, Nomo Mania will  
be back in full swing. Kerry Wood tore an elbow ligament in his 
first Cactus League start and needs season-ending replacement 
surgery, and Terry Mulholland had to move back to the bullpen when 
Terry Adams sprained his throwing elbow. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cubs lost the Orel Hershiser derby to the Mets, and the two  
pitchers they did get Wednesday -- lefties Brad Woodall and Dan 
Serafini -- are castoffs from other teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the addition of Nomo, that's a good arm out there every  
fifth day,'' Grace said. ``If he's healthy, I think we got 
ourselves a bargain.''

<HEADLINE> Don Imus' Request Rejected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) -- The state has rejected Don Imus' request  
for rights to water for a ranch he bought to help seriously ill 
children. 
</P>
<P>
	John Silver, the radio host's attorney, applied last year to  
transfer water rights from land owned by George and Francis Gusler. 
</P>
<P>
	State engineer Tom Turney rejected the request Wednesday, saying  
no valid water right exists at the Gusler land, which is near Imus' 
ranch. 
</P>
<P>
	Imus, who raised millions for his ranch, wouldn't comment  
Thursday. He could appeal, take the issue to court, ask the state 
engineer's office for a new appropriation of water rights in the 
area, buy existing rights elsewhere or seek a well permit.

<HEADLINE> Baseball Uniforms May Pitch Brands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Can you picture Mark McGwire walking to the  
plate with a patch on his bulging biceps advertising a burger 
joint? 
</P>
<P>
	Or those famed New York Yankees pinstripes -- the ones worn with  
pride by Ruth and Gehrig, DiMaggio and Mantle -- hawking an ad for 
bagels? 
</P>
<P>
	It might be baseball's newest pitch: The sport's leaders and the  
players union are considering allowing teams to sell advertising on 
the sleeves of their uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first thing I think of is somebody's bail bonds on the  
back of the Bad News Bears' uniforms,'' Baltimore pitcher Mike 
Mussina said Wednesday. ``So it's going to be my name, my number 
and Joe's Bail Bonds? That's the first thing I think of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's not unprecedented: Soccer teams around the world have ads  
on their shirts, selling everything from breweries to banks, often 
emblazoned in letters larger than those of the team name. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball is talking to potential sponsors about putting  
corporate logos on 1- to 1 1/2-inch square patches -- perhaps too small 
to be easily seen from the upper deck, but certainly big enough to 
be picked up in TV closeups and photographs. The negotiations, 
conducted jointly by baseball and the players association, were 
first reported this week by the Sports Business Journal. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's one of those things where baseball is looking to further  
market itself and maybe that's a possibility we need to look at,'' 
Seattle catcher Dan Wilson said. ``If that's one way to do it, 
that's one way to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NASCAR drivers are walking billboards when they wear their track  
outfits. And tennis players and golfers frequently appear on the 
court and the course wearing shirts and caps with corporate logos. 
</P>
<P>
	Although shoes and equipment such as bats and gloves carry brand  
names and logos, ads on uniforms apparently would be a first for 
the four major U.S. team sports. Currently, the only corporate 
marking on baseball uniforms is an ``R'' for Russell Athletic, the 
manufacturer of the jerseys. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is about trying to find creative ways to bring valuable  
partners into baseball,'' said Tim Brosnan, baseball's senior vice 
president of domestic and international properties. 
</P>
<P>
	Brosnan wouldn't put a timetable on the discussions or when a  
final decision will be made, saying it depends ``on when things 
gel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a traditionalist, but I know all these things we're doing  
generate more revenue, and that's what we have to do,'' Florida 
Marlins manager John Boles said. If Mr. Henry (Florida owner John 
Henry) says, `This is what we're doing on the uniforms,' I'd say, 
`Looks great to me.' 
</P>
<P>
	Several officials speaking on the condition they not be  
identified said owners would have to give the final go-ahead and 
pointed out that commissioner Bud Selig moves slowly and carefully 
toward decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are active discussions about the issues that bring  
additional partners and additional sponsors into baseball,'' 
Brosnan said. ``We're kicking around a lot of things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Selig and chief operating officer Paul Beeston did not respond  
to telephone calls seeking comment on the plan. Gene Orza, the 
union's No. 2 official, said a national sponsor might buy the 
rights to all uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
	``The talks are still very preliminary. To even discuss them is  
to give them a substance they don't deserve,'' Orza said. ``But be 
assured that whatever we do, it will be tasteful, a small logo on 
the uniform.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball would prohibit uniform ads only from tobacco, alcohol  
and media companies. Broadcasters of games are unlikely to want to 
show closeups of players wearing ads for their competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer advocate Ralph Nader dislikes the idea, and sent a  
letter to Selig telling him so. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is bad enough already when outfielders are going back for a  
long drive, that fans have to see advertisements for Coca-Cola and 
other products,'' Nader wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	``You are trying the patience of loyal fans across the country.  
Fans yearn for baseball that is free from blatant huckstering and 
crass commercialism,'' he said. ``Enough is enough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the scramble to find new revenue in the 1990s, often to cover  
players' escalating salaries, teams have dramatically increased 
ballpark advertising, plastering ads on fences and -- for the first 
time -- behind home plate, where they are visible behind the batter 
from the center field television camera. 
</P>
<P>
	Teams have even sold the naming rights to stadiums -- Banc One  
Corp. will spend $66 million in the next 30 years on the naming 
rights to the Arizona Diamondbacks' ballpark in Phoenix. The 
Yankees are discussing whether to sell naming rights to their famed 
ballpark.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Advance at Midday / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo share prices advanced slightly Friday morning  
on buying by pension funds. The dollar edged higher against the 
yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei Stock Average gained 10.80 points, or 0.07 percent,  
to 16,338.36 points at the end of the morning session. On Thursday, 
the average advanced 490.97 points, or 3.1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 120.52 yen in late morning, up 2.00 yen from  
late Thursday in Tokyo and also above its level of 120.43 in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, a flood of heavy buy orders from pension  
funds initially pushed share prices higher, but profit-taking after 
Thursday's sharp rise capped gains, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market is taking a break from yesterday, but the energy is  
very good,'' said Sachio Ishikawa, general manager of the stock 
division at Chuo Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section advanced 7.55 points, or 0.58 percent, to 1,307.99. 
The TOPIX rose 33.22 points, or 2.6 percent, the previous day. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, which marked the 50th  
anniversary of its founding on Thursday, held a small ceremony 
Friday morning at the exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average closed at 9,832.51  
points Thursday, up 46.35. 
</P>
<P>
	On the foreign exchange market, the dollar gained ground against  
the yen on buying by Japanese insurers and investment trusts. 
</P>
<P>
	The greenback also got support after Haruhiko Kuroda, a senior  
official at Japan's Finance Ministry reiterated the ministry's 
stance that excessive yen strength is undesirable. 
</P>
<P>
	Kuroda, director-general of the ministry's international bureau,  
spoke to a small group of reporters without specifying an 
appropriate level for the currency. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said trade was thin ahead of the weekend and holidays  
in Europe and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the euro was traded at 129.94 yen, up from 128.42 yen  
late Thursday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the 10-year Japanese government bond rose to 1.730  
percent from Thursday's finish of 1.720 percent, driving its price 
down to 100.60 yen from 100.69 yen.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Close Higher; Dow Up 46.35 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks closed mostly higher on a late burst of  
buying Thursday as optimism generated by merger announcements 
overcame worries about interest rates and Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average rose 46.35 to 9,832.51 after  
changing direction several times over the course of the day. The 
pre-holiday trading was light, making price swings sharper than 
usual. The Dow ended up 10.27 for the week. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators also rose. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500  
rose 7.35 to 1,293.72, and the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite 
index rose 31.97 to 2,493.37. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors in both the stock and bond markets were trading  
cautiously ahead of the long holiday weekend. Financial markets are 
closed Friday in observance of Good Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders were nervous about the continuing U.S. military presence  
in Yugoslavia and worried that the situation might escalate over 
the weekend. They were also wary about Friday's scheduled release 
of March employment data, especially because the stock market would 
be closed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think you can make much of this afternoon's  
recovery,'' said Ricky Harrington, technical analyst at 
Interstate/Johnson Lane in Charlotte, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's just a little more caution in the air, and people are  
going into the long weekend trying to not have a great deal of 
exposure either on the up or down side. When the Dow's at 9,800, it 
doesn't take much of a movement in a few Dow stocks to put the 
market up 20 or 30 points.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, corporate mergers helped lift the market.  
</P>
<P>
	Yahoo! announced a $5.7 billion planned purchase of  
Broadcast.com, sending Yahoo! shares up 11 3/8 to 179 3/4, and 
Broadcast.com up 11 13/16 to 130. 
</P>
<P>
	As expected, BP Amoco announced plans to buy Atlantic Richfield  
for $26.6 billion, a deal that would create the world's 
second-largest oil company. Atlantic Richfield shares fell 11/16 to 
72 7/16, and BP's shares fell 5 3/16 to 95 13/16. 
</P>
<P>
	And CBS said it would pay $2.5 billion for King World  
Productions, the largest TV-syndication company. CBS shares fell 
11/16 to 40 1/8, but King World's rose 5/8 to 31 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger talk produced an opening rally, but that soon  
evaporated when the National Association of Purchasing Management 
reported its monthly index of business activity rose to 54.3 
percent last month, an increase of 1.9 percentage points from its 
February level. 
</P>
<P>
	In another sign of economic vigor, the Commerce Department  
reported construction spending jumped a much-stronger-than-expected 
2.2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The department also reported personal income increased a  
seasonally adjusted 0.5 percent in February after a 0.6 percent 
gain in January. Consumer spending, meanwhile, jumped 0.7 percent 
after a 0.4 percent rise the previous month. 
</P>
<P>
	The news sent bond prices lower as traders feared the strong  
economy would reignite inflation and lead to higher interest rates. 
The yield on the 30-year Treasury rose to 5.67 percent from 5.62 
late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks followed bonds' lead until late afternoon.  
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues narrowly led advancers on the New York Stock  
Exchange, and consolidated volume was moderate at 848.68 million 
shares, down sharply from Wednesday's pace of 922.16 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index rose 1.40 to 604.99, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index rose 1.00 to 711.30. The Russell 
2000 index of smaller companies rose 1.11 to 398.74. 
</P>
<P>
	In overseas stock markets, the Nikkei 225 index in Tokyo surged  
3.10 percent, as domestic and foreign investors scooped up shares 
on the first day of Japan's new fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
	European stock markets rose on widespread expectations that the  
European Central Bank will lower its main refinancing rate when its 
governing council meets April 8, traders said. The DAX index in 
Frankfurt climbed 1.01 percent, the FT-SE 100 in London advanced 
0.55 percent, and the CAC in Paris added 0.76 percent.

<HEADLINE> N.M. Police Probe Sex Torture Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ELEPHANT BUTTE, N.M. (AP) -- Investigators have begun excavating  
around the lakeside trailer where two women said they were held in 
chains and sexually tortured, and today they brought in a dog. 
</P>
<P>
	A state-federal task force grew to nearly 100 investigators  
probing and digging around the home 150 miles south of Albuquerque. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are doing some selective digging by hand,'' FBI agent Doug  
Beldon said Wednesday. ``We're looking for some things that might 
be concealed subsurface.'' 
</P>
<P>
	David Parker Ray, 59, and Cynthia Lea Hendy, 39, have been  
charged with numerous crimes, including kidnapping, sexual abuse, 
battery and conspiracy. Two women accused the pair of holding them 
in separate days-long incidents of torture. 
</P>
<P>
	There has been no indication that bodies have been found, but  
authorities have not ruled out the possibility of homicides. An 
acquaintance said Ms. Hendy told him Ray had killed four to six 
people, mutilated the bodies and dumped them in Elephant Butte 
Lake. 
</P>
<P>
	She said other bodies were buried in the desert, the  
acquaintance said. 
</P>
<P>
	Agents used hand shovels, metal detectors and electronic probes  
to measure soil density around the home for any signs of recent 
excavation or burial. Beldon said they were looking for items 
listed in a search warrant, which was not released. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Ron Lopez said defense attorneys on Wednesday waived  
arraignment on the criminal complaint and trial was tentatively set 
for April 12. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys for both defendants said their clients are innocent.  
</P>
<P>
	``Quite frankly, there are no bodies,'' said Xavier Acosta,  
lawyer for Ms. Hendy. ``I believe Ms. Hendy is unjustly being tied 
to these matters just because of her association (with Ray).'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ray's co-workers said they were shocked by the allegations.  
</P>
<P>
	``He was the neatest, cleanest, politest person you could ever  
want to meet,'' said Glen Parks, a volunteer who works at the 
Elephant Butte State Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Ray was a maintenance worker at the park for about five years,  
fixing vehicles and heavy machinery, said his boss Jerome Madrid. 
</P>
<P>
	``He showed up, he did his job, we depended on him,'' Madrid  
said.

<HEADLINE> New Drug Set for Hemophiliacs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hemophilia patients have won a genetically  
engineered new drug called NovoSeven that may offer significant 
help when standard therapy fails. 
</P>
<P>
	Hemophilia patients' blood doesn't clot properly, so they are at  
risk of hemorrhage from even minor injuries. They are treated with 
infusions of blood clotting factors called Factor VIII or Factor 
IX. 
</P>
<P>
	But about 10 percent of hemophiliacs lose the ability for those  
treatments to work -- their bodies develop ``inhibitors'' that block 
them. Manufacturer Novo Nordisk Pharmaceuticals estimates that 
NovoSeven could help some 1,500 such Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors have tried giving patients massive amounts of Factor  
VIII, an expensive endeavor that sometimes works by overwhelming 
the inhibitors, said Food and Drug Administration hematology chief 
Dr. Mark Weinstein. A few other drugs offer mixes of different 
clotting factors, but too often patients don't respond. 
</P>
<P>
	NovoSeven, which the FDA quietly approved last Friday, offers  
the first alternative. Also called recombinant Factor VIIa, and 
genetically engineered to contain no human proteins, it bypasses 
the need for typical hemophilia blood factors, instead targeting 
proteins in the damaged blood-vessel wall to clot blood, Weinstein 
explained. 
</P>
<P>
	The drug carries an average wholesale price of $1.40 per  
microgram -- an unusual pricing method that Novo Nordisk chose 
because patients' doses are customized according to body weight and 
the severity of bleeding. A 132-pound, moderately bleeding adult, 
for example, might require two 5,400-microgram doses, roughly 
$7,500 per dose.

<HEADLINE> Many Hurricanes Expected This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- The upcoming Atlantic hurricane season  
could be as fierce as last season in which thousands of people were 
killed, a leading storm forecaster said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1999 season will have 14 named storms and nine hurricanes,  
four of them major, predicted Colorado State weather forecaster 
William Gray. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a very active season,'' said Gray, who was taking part  
in the three-day National Hurricane Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Last season, there were 14 tropical storms, including 10  
hurricanes. The hurricane death toll in 1998 was at least 10,000, 
mostly from Hurricane Mitch's damage in Honduras. 
</P>
<P>
	The hurricane season begins June 1 and lasts through Nov. 30.  
</P>
<P>
	Over the last 30 years, an average of about 10 tropical storms  
have occurred annually, and five or six have reached hurricane 
strength. 
</P>
<P>
	Changes in the Atlantic that make the ocean warmer and saltier  
are the reason for the increase, Gray said. These cyclical 
conditions haven't been seen since the late 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
	``The odds strongly favor us entering a new era for storms,''  
Gray said. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the devastation wreaked by Hurricane Andrew in 1992,  
Florida has been lucky during the past 25 years in that the state 
has seen fewer than usual hurricanes, Gray said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Florida could see more damage in the near future because  
of the upswing in the number of storms and because more people are 
living in storm-prone areas. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to be seeing a $50 billion-, $70 billion-, $100  
billion- damage storm,'' Gray said. ``Florida is a sitting duck.''

<HEADLINE> Scrutiny of Bush's Past Growing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush's creation of a  
presidential exploratory committee is setting off an exploration of 
his past behavior as well as his political prospects. But so far, 
not much more has emerged from the media scrutiny than a breakup 
with a fiancee 30 years ago, and she wishes him only the best. 
</P>
<P>
	Combined with the attention increasingly being paid to Bush's  
tendency to duck hot issues, the focus on his boisterous youth 
shows he's fair game as he gets closer to an official candidacy, 
analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
	``These things are inevitable,'' said Bruce Buchanan, a  
political scientist at the University of Texas. ``It's perhaps 
painful, but a truth. People that enter the arena take hits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush has acknowledged doing ``some irresponsible things when I  
was young and irresponsible,'' but has not been more specific, 
except to say he used to drink too much. He said he hasn't had 
alcohol since a 40th birthday binge 12 years ago, and that he has 
been faithful to his wife. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dallas Morning News quoted his former fiancee, Cathy Young,  
on Thursday as saying she has only best wishes for Bush. ``I loved 
him. But I have no thoughts of 'what if' -- no regrets,'' said Ms. 
Young, 52, a longtime homemaker and now an artist living in Palo 
Alto, Calif. ``It's been too long, and I'm happy as a clam.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They were engaged in 1967, making her witness to what Bush has  
called his irresponsible years. ``If he had wild days, they weren't 
with me,'' she said. Ms. Young married a year after the breakup 
with Bush and has been divorced for three years. 
</P>
<P>
	She did not offer details on the breakup; he recently said he  
always ``thought the world'' of her. People who knew them back then 
said they saw nothing scandalous about them postponing their 
wedding for a year, then calling it off. 
</P>
<P>
	With Bush leading the field of Republican prospects in opinion  
polls, he is drawing more attention for his reluctance to tackle 
issues such as abortion and the U.S. bombing of Yugoslavia. He 
repeatedly begs off, saying he will air his views ``as I leave the 
state and move across the country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Kosovo, Bush spokeswoman Karen Hughes said Americans don't  
want leaders criticizing the administration while soldiers' lives 
are at stake. 
</P>
<P>
	In the state capital, the Austin American-Statesman criticized  
the governor for doing a ``2-step around hot topics'' while Wall 
Street Journal columnist Albert R. Hunt on Thursday questioned 
whether he's ``ready for prime time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the other hand, Republican prospect Elizabeth Dole, too, has  
said little about many issues. 
</P>
<P>
	William Bennett, a former Republican education secretary who  
writes about morality and harshly criticized President Clinton over 
his relationship with Monica Lewinsky, says he's not troubled if 
Bush had some wild times in the old days. ``The Irish have a 
saying: The merry-hearted boys make the best men,'' Bennett said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Young and male, some of us in college, some of us in high  
school, did things we weren't particularly happy about or proud of 
later. I don't think that's a concern of the American people.''

<HEADLINE> Security Grounds Student Satellites </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STANFORD, Calif. (AP) -- Doctoral student Michael Swartwout had  
hoped his class project would be orbiting over the Arctic Ocean by 
now. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the 2-foot-wide hexagonal satellite is grounded --  
probably for good -- in a dust-free room at Stanford University. 
</P>
<P>
	Like other projects built by engineering students around the  
country, Swartwout's has been kept Earth-bound by a new U.S. policy 
borne of fears over national security. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a wonderfully simple problem,'' said Lewis Franklin, a  
former vice president of TRW Inc., the defense and aerospace 
equipment maker. ``They can't get an affordable launch in the 
United States. They have a free launch offered in another country. 
</P>
<P>
	``But political problems are making it impossible to ship it  
out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now a research fellow at Stanford's Center for International  
Security and Cooperation, Franklin has served as a volunteer 
liaison between Stanford's satellite project and potential 
launchers. 
</P>
<P>
	Normally, a private satellite launch in the United States costs  
about $4.5 million. Students usually don't have to foot the bill -- 
they can launch their projects at a big discount or pro bono by 
hitching a ride on larger private or public rockets. 
</P>
<P>
	The 28-year-old Swartwout and his crew, who began their project  
in 1994, had just such a plan, with Moscow Bauman State Technical 
University in Russia offering a free launch for their SAPPHIRE 
(Stanford Audio Phonic Photographic Infra Red Experiment). 
</P>
<P>
	All the students had to do was get their glittering 40-pound  
gadget over there and connect it to the Russian rocket. 
</P>
<P>
	But their plan fell apart last fall when President Clinton  
signed the 1999 defense bill, which reclassified commercial 
satellites as ``munitions'' and turned primary control over 
exporting them from the Commerce Department to the State 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
	The policy shift was a response to controversy following the  
1996 crash of a Chinese rocket carrying a satellite built by Loral 
Space &AMP; Communications. After the crash, U.S. officials worried 
that sensitive technology may have been made available to the 
Chinese. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole reason the State Department is handling all  
satellite export licenses is to protect the national security of 
the United States,'' an agency spokesman said. ``We're making sure 
we have a tab on who gets what and that sensitive technology is 
safeguarded.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The SAPPHIRE, however, is an unlikely threat to national  
security. Built in an old basement chemistry lab, it has payload 
that includes a digital camera, a voice synthesizer and a couple of 
telemetry and autonomy experiments -- not the stuff of master spies. 
</P>
<P>
	And certainly there are no trade secrets aboard -- it's made  
mostly from material anyone could buy at a Radio Shack. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just want to put these nifty things in space,'' said Robert  
Twiggs, a visiting professor hired five years ago to jump-start 
Stanford's small satellite development project. ``I'm trying to get 
the students through the life cycle of one of these projects.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Twiggs said the political wrench thrown in the way may have  
taught the students a good lesson: Make launch arrangements early. 
The program's next satellite, the OPAL, is slated to hitch a ride 
on a U.S. military rocket in September. 
</P>
<P>
	Swartwout isn't going to let the problem hold up his life: ``At  
some point I got kind of resigned to this and realized that I 
better focus on finishing my degree instead of the launch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, there are some advantages to working with a satellite  
that never leaves campus. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess in a way it's not bad,'' he said. ``If I have a  
problem I can just walk down and take a look.''

<HEADLINE> 'Jenny Jones' Case Continues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- A former guest on ``The Jenny Jones Show''  
sobbed and repeatedly mentioned the program as he told a 911 
dispatcher that he had killed a gay man who went on the show to 
reveal a crush on him. 
</P>
<P>
	A tape of the conversation between Jonathan Schmitz and the  
dispatcher was played today for jurors hearing a $50 million 
wrongful death lawsuit against the show, its distributor, Warner 
Bros., and producer, Telepictures Productions. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit, brought by the family of Scott Amedure, contends  
the show's ``ambush'' tactics humiliated Schmitz and drove him to 
shoot Amedure in March 1995, three days after the two appeared on 
the program. The episode never aired. 
</P>
<P>
	Schmitz had been invited on the show to meet a secret admirer,  
only to discover that it was Amedure, an acquaintance. Amedure went 
on to describe fantasies involving Schmitz as the audience whooped 
and hollered. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense contends Schmitz knew that the secret admirer could  
be a man or a woman and that Schmitz and Amedure had a sexual 
relationship after the show was taped. 
</P>
<P>
	Schmitz was convicted of Amedure's murder in 1996, but the  
verdict was overturned due to an error in jury selection, and his 
retrial is pending. 
</P>
<P>
	During his criminal trial, Schmitz' lawyers admitted he killed  
Amedure but said the shooting was fueled by the humiliation of the 
incident, which was aggravated by Schmitz's alcoholism, depression 
and a thyroid condition. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-and-a-half-minute 911 tape is largely inaudible, but  
repeated references to Jenny Jones and ``national television'' can 
be heard. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those were the things that kept coming up,'' Mary Jones, a  
former police dispatcher in Auburn Hills, Mich., testified 
Thursday. ``It didn't matter where it happened, why it happened at 
the time. But he did say `Jenny Jones and national television.' It 
broke my heart to hear him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors also viewed the never-aired show.  
</P>
<P>
	On the videotape, after Schmitz learns Amedure is his admirer,  
Schmitz laughs, bends over in his chair and claps, then calls the 
confession ``interesting, very interesting.'' When Amedure reveals 
his sexual fantasies, Schmitz covers his face with his hands. 
</P>
<P>
	When he is asked by Jenny Jones whether he was involved with  
anyone, he replies, ``No, but I'm definitely heterosexual, I guess 
you could say,'' and said he was ``flattered'' by Amedure's 
interest. 
</P>
<P>
	Jenny Jones, is not named in the lawsuit, but is scheduled to  
testify on Monday.

<HEADLINE> Congress Mulls Crop Insurance Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- For some farmers, the best crop is the one  
they don't harvest. 
</P>
<P>
	In west Texas last year, 200 farmers obtained federally  
subsidized insurance on a type of cotton that wasn't feasible to 
grow in their arid region. They paid $4.4 million in premiums and 
then claimed nearly $15 million in benefits when most of the crop 
failed. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers in North Dakota and surrounding states recently rushed  
out and bought seed for durum wheat, even in areas not suited for 
the crop, to take advantage of a new insurance policy offering 
benefits far higher than they could earn if they grew and sold 
ordinary wheat. 
</P>
<P>
	Crop insurance provides a vital safety net for farmers,  
especially when prices are low and the government has been trying 
to phase out its role in agriculture. But government auditors say 
the insurance system is riddled with abuse, conflicts of interest 
and errors because taxpayers bear most of the risk for losses, not 
the private companies that sell and service the policies. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies ``have little reason to effectively monitor risky  
policy holders, little reason to deny claims of questionable 
losses, and no cause to find fault with their own practices,'' said 
an internal report by the Agriculture Department's inspector 
general. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies ``are supposed to ensure compliance, but they also  
have an aggressive sales function. ... The two don't mix well,'' 
said Scott Stofferahn, who oversees USDA's farm programs in North 
Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
	Stephen Frerichs, a spokesman for the companies, dismissed the  
inspector general's report this week, saying it was merely 
``rehashing a bunch of old'' allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides assuming most of the risk for losses, the government  
subsidizes the premiums farmers pay for the insurance and pays the 
companies a fee for handling the policies. The program has been 
costing the government more than $1.5 billion a year, and Congress 
is considering doubling that to improve the coverage and make it 
less costly to producers. 
</P>
<P>
	The insurance companies have to pay some of the losses, with  
their share varying according to their government contracts. 
Nevertheless, they have made $2.8 billion in fees and underwriting 
gains -- their gross profits after losses -- over the last four 
years. That's $400 million more than they made in the previous 14 
years combined. 
</P>
<P>
	Acreage covered by the insurance has doubled to about 70 percent  
of all farmland since the program was last overhauled in 1994, 
while losses have been relatively low. The weather has been good 
through most of the country since 1993 except for droughts in the 
South and Southwest last year that prompted Congress to provide 
$1.7 billion in disaster relief for lost crops and livestock 
assistance. 
</P>
<P>
	``Naturally the underwriting gains are going to be larger and  
the indemnity payments are lower,'' said Frerichs, manager of the 
American Association of Crop Insurers. 
</P>
<P>
	USDA's Risk Management Agency, which oversees the program, has  
been shifting more of the risk to the companies in recent years and 
cutting their fees, officials say. In the case of the durum 
policies, USDA sharply reduced the potential benefits and is now 
being sued by farmers to have them reinstated. 
</P>
<P>
	``Farmers are honest folks. If they think someone is cheating,  
they'll report it,'' said John Zirschky, the agency's associate 
administrator. ``Farmers don't like to see people stealing 
taxpayer's money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers currently pay $50 a crop for basic ``catastrophic''  
coverage, regardless of acreage, and about 60 percent of the 
premium -- which can run into thousands of dollars -- for more 
extensive ``buyup'' insurance. Those policies cover losses from 
drought, floods, pests, and in some cases, drops in projected 
revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	The government pays the rest of the premium. In 1998, the  
government spent $946 million on premium subsidies and paid another 
$759 million to the companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers complain that crop insurance is usually too stingy and  
they want coverage for more specialty crops and also for livestock, 
which can't be insured now. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the time, the insurance ``doesn't provide adequate  
revenue to cover the expenses put into the ground every spring, 
with the amount of risk that you're subjected to,'' said wheat 
grower Tom DeKrey of Steele, N.D.

	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Churchill Downs, looking to expand its  
operations to the West Coast, said Thursday it is negotiating to 
acquire Hollywood Park in California. 
</P>
<P>

broaden its simulcast operations. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Odyssey Channel Reinvents Itself </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Odyssey Channel is making a leap of faith.  
</P>
<P>
	Created in 1988 as a haven for religious programming, the cable  
channel is reinventing itself as a source of family-friendly 
entertainment that intends to remain true to its spiritual roots. 
</P>
<P>
	The combination, according to the channel's market research, is  
what viewers say is most lacking in television and what they most 
crave. Beginning Sunday, Odyssey will learn if people will watch 
what they claim they want. 
</P>
<P>
	``Call me crazy, but I think we're going to be very  
successful,'' said Margaret Loesch, the veteran TV executive who is 
Odyssey's president and chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not minimizing the challenges of being yet another new  
program service, but I think our blend of elements is distinctive 
and unique.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new Odyssey is not a mom-and-pop operation. Two  
heavyweights, Hallmark Entertainment and Jim Henson Co. (bearing 
the name of its late founder, the Muppet creator), became Odyssey 
partners last year with a $100 million stake. 
</P>
<P>
	Hallmark and Henson bring to the table the mainstay of Odyssey's  
revised schedule: their rich program and movie libraries. Added to 
the mix will be at least 30 hours a week of shows focusing on faith 
and values. 
</P>
<P>
	The religious programs are produced by the National Interfaith  
Cable Coalition Inc., which founded the venture previously called 
the Faith &AMP; Values Channel. The coalition is made up of nearly 80 
Christian and Jewish groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those programs: ``Quiet Triumphs,'' a celebrity interview  
series with host Mary Alice Williams; the gospel music and variety 
``CeCe's Place'' with CeCe Wynans; and ``30 Minutes,'' featuring 
sermons from Protestant, Catholic and Jewish leaders. The channel 
also offers Daily Mass from St. Anne's Shrine in Scranton, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	From Hallmark, the contributions are led by its ``Hall of Fame''  
movies, including the recent August Wilson Pulitzer Prize-winning 
play, ``The Piano Lesson,'' starring Alfre Woodard, and ``What the 
Deaf Man Heard,'' with Matthew Modine, and such golden oldies as 
``Harvey'' (a 1972 remake with Jimmy Stewart of his 1950 movie). 
</P>
<P>
	A collection of director Hal Roach's movies, including Laurel  
and Hardy comedies and other vintage films, also is owned by 
Hallmark. Film critic Leonard Maltin will be host of a daily 
showing of Roach's movies and comedy shorts. 
</P>
<P>
	The shows from Henson Co.'s shelves include ``Jim Henson's  
Muppet Babies,'' ``Fraggle Rock,'' ``ALF'' and ``Mother Goose 
Stories.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New programming, expected to make up at least one-quarter of the  
Odyssey schedule within five years, will be produced exclusively by 
Hallmark, Henson, Odyssey Productions and the coalition. 
</P>
<P>
	The network debuts in its new form 6 p.m. EST Sunday with a  
showing of ``Gulliver's Travels,'' the Jim Henson Productions 
miniseries starring Ted Danson that was a ratings success when it 
first aired on NBC in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	But will viewers return for a second bite of such fare, popular  
though it was the first time around? PAX TV, another new 
family-oriented channel that relies on recycled programs such as 
``Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman,'' has found it rough to build ratings. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite PAX's early results, there is an unmet demand for  
family-oriented programming -- witness the rise of WB's 
fresh-scrubbed family drama ``7th Heaven.'' And Odyssey does have 
an edge, according to an industry analyst. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've got some terrific programs in that Henson and Hallmark  
have been associated with quality for decades,'' said Janeen Bjork 
of New York-based Seltel, which advises TV station clients on 
program purchases. 
</P>
<P>
	``But they've got the same challenge any cable network does in  
our constantly multiplying numbers of choices: That is, you've got 
to be distinctive,'' Bjork said. 
</P>
<P>
	Loesch says the Henson-Hallmark library ensures that, along with  
the faith programming. The channel is available in nearly 30 
million homes, which puts it in the league of Bravo (35 million 
homes) and Court TV (34 million). 
</P>
<P>
	The goal is to reach 54 million cable subscribers. By  
comparison, A&AMP;E, Discovery and USA Network are in 70 million to 78 
million homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Loesch, who was the founding president and later vice chairman  
of Fox's highly successful children's network before joining Henson 
in its Odyssey venture, said she initially cringed at the idea of 
making a religious channel a partner. 
</P>
<P>
	She equated religion on TV with moneymaking televangelism, she  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Odyssey, however, was begun in 1988 as an effort to redefine  
religious programming, said Father Bob Bonnot, a Roman Catholic 
priest who helped launch it under its original name, Vision 
Interfaith Satellite Network. (Liberty Media Corp. became a joint 
owner in 1995.) 
</P>
<P>
	The goal in providing an alternative to the Jim Bakker-Jimmy  
Swaggart TV model was to deliver ``the kind of messages our faith 
groups try to teach people,'' Bonnot said -- tolerance, peace, and 
respect for the Earth's environment, among them. 
</P>
<P>
	The Henson and Hallmark programs are not overtly religious but  
contain themes consistent with those messages, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Acknowledging that the coalition had to surrender programming  
hours as part of the new schedule, Bonnot said the attitude is an 
upbeat ``less is more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We have less time on a channel that has a much stronger  
carriage and viewership, allowing us to reach more eyeballs, hearts 
and souls. The coalition entered this partnership happily and is 
very enthusiastic.''

<HEADLINE> Finance Minister Confident in Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa voiced confidence  
on Friday that Japan will achieve economic growth in the new fiscal 
year, fueling hopes the nation can recover from a prolonged 
recession. 
</P>
<P>
	Responding to recent remarks by U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert  
Rubin that Japan's growth could be zero or negative, Miyazawa said: 
``I personally think 0.5 percent growth for this fiscal year is a 
reasonable estimate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In December, the government forecast economic growth of 0.5  
percent for fiscal 1999 based on previously announced stimulus 
measures, following two years of contraction. 
</P>
<P>
	Miyazawa also said he is not considering an extra budget for  
fiscal 1999, which began Thursday, but will let the $682 billion 
budget approved last month stand alone. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one is sure whether the Japanese economy has hit the  
bottom,'' the finance minister said at a press conference, ``but 
I'm not thinking of compiling an extra budget.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, the director general of Japan's Economic Planning  
Agency, Taichi Sakaiya, said that he expects the economy will turn 
around in the ``not-so-distant'' future. 
</P>
<P>
	Sakaiya told reporters that there are signs of worsening as well  
as improvement in the economy, but the pace of overall 
deterioration in the economy is slowing. 
</P>
<P>
	Sakaiya said Japan must take measures to stop growing  
unemployment, which hit a record high 4.6 percent in February, but 
he added that ``in the dark before the dawn,'' the number of 
jobless people tends to increase. 
</P>
<P>
	Sakaiya also said that he planned to visit the United States in  
late April or early May in preparation for Prime Minister Keizo 
Obuchi's scheduled official visit in May.

<HEADLINE> USC Star Catcher Injures Hand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Southern California catcher Eric Munson,  
expected to be a top pick in June's amateur baseball draft, has a 
fractured bone in his right hand and will be out six to eight 
weeks, according to Trojans coach Mike Gillespie. 
</P>
<P>
	Munson, who helped lead the Trojans (17-16) to their NCAA-record  
12th College World Series championship last season, was injured 
Saturday against Washington State when a foul tip hit his throwing 
hand, fracturing the pisaform bone. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-3 junior, who was hitting .304 with a team-high 10  
home runs and 31 RBIs, will not need surgery. Munson will be in a 
cast for four weeks before beginning rehabilitation, and may return 
for USC's final regular-season series against Washington in 
mid-May. 
</P>
<P>
	Munson, named preseason player of the year by Collegiate  
Baseball newspaper, missed 16 games last season with a stress 
fracture in his right foot.

<HEADLINE> Mannesmann Buys Telecom Rival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DUESSELDORF, Germany (AP) -- Telecommunications concern  
Mannesmann Arcor has bought competitor o.tel.o, a move that gives 
it control of 50 percent of the German market. 
</P>
<P>
	Mannesmann Arcor paid $1.3 billion for o.tel.o, which was  
jointly owned by German utilities RWE and Veba. 
</P>
<P>
	O.tel.o was one of several companies launched after the  
liberalization of Germany's telecommunications market last year, 
and was intended to compete with former monopoly Deutsche Telekom. 
The company posted heavy losses in its first year. 
</P>
<P>
	Mannesmann Arcor, a subsidiary of industrial conglomerate  
Mannesmann AG, will take over o.tel.o's customer base, trade name 
and 2,800 employees. 
</P>
<P>
	It gains 1,000 large customers, including TV station RTL and  
Dresdner Bank, as well as 400,000 private customers. Mannesmann 
officials said o.tel.o would remain an independent company. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal does not include o.tel.o Internet branch, Germany.net,  
which has more than 600,000 customers. Also excluded is a 60 
percent ownership in the cellular phone business E-plus and cable 
company Telecolumbus.

<HEADLINE>  Soldiers Shown on TV Are US Troops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. military officials confirmed today that  
three captured U.S. soldiers shown on Serbian television were those 
reported missing several hours earlier near the Yugoslav-Macedonia 
border. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans had told comrades they were under attack and  
surrounded shortly before losing radio contact. 
</P>
<P>
	Capt. John Clearwater, spokesman for the U.S. Army's 1st  
Infantry Division in Germany, said the soldiers' identities were 
being withheld pending notification of family members, who were in 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``The great news is the fact that these soldiers are alive and  
well and appear to be healthy,'' Clearwater told The Associated 
Press by telephone from the unit's base at Wuerzburg, Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	``That has been the greatest relief to the families and the  
other soldiers at the base.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clearwater said he had no information on the circumstances of  
their capture. The Serbian television images showed three U.S. 
servicemen in combat fatigues and in apparent good shape, although 
at least one had abrasions on his face. 
</P>
<P>
	Even before official acknowledgment that the three missing men  
had been captured, NATO spokesman Jamie Shea said at a news 
conference in Brussels, Belgium that they were part of a 
peacekeeping mission in Macedonia that posed ``absolutely no threat 
to Yugoslavia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Any soldiers that happen under any circumstance to be captured  
by the Yugoslav armed forces must be treated in a humane way in 
accordance with international civilized norms of behavior,'' Shea 
said. ``NATO fully expects this to happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Until their capture was confirmed, a multinational force had  
been conducting an intensive search for them along the 
Yugoslavia-Macedonia border. 
</P>
<P>
	``The search will continue until we find them or until we have  
some idea where they are,'' Col. Richard Bridges, a Pentagon 
spokesman, had said late Wednesday. ``It's pretty rough out 
there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The captured Army team had been on a daytime reconnaissance  
mission in the Kumanovo area, about 3 miles from the southern 
Yugoslavia border when they reported ``they received small arms 
fire and said they were surrounded,'' according to NATO. 
</P>
<P>
	``No more was heard from the patrol,'' a NATO statement said.  
</P>
<P>
	NATO officials didn't say who had the soldiers surrounded, but  
Pentagon officials said it was presumed to be Serb Army, 
paramilitary, police of perhaps angry citizens. 
</P>
<P>
	The urgent radio calls for help came between 2:30 p.m. and 3  
p.m. Macedonia time (7:30 a.m. to 8 a.m. EST), the Pentagon said. 
When the other reconnaissance teams from the Army's 1st Infantry 
Division headquartered in Wurzburg, Germany, failed to find their 
colleagues, they radioed their commanders for help, according to 
the Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
	An immediate rescue mission was launched, involving ground and  
helicopter teams from several NATO countries and the Allied Rapid 
Reaction Corps based in the Macedonian capital of Skopje, U.S. 
officials said. Searchers included 80 to 90 soldiers on U.S. 
Blackhawk, British, French and Italian helicopters. 
</P>
<P>
	Searchers were unable to find the missing team's Humvee vehicle,  
which had been traveling on a civilian road during part of the 
reconnaissance mission, U.S. officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The missing team was one of several Army units guarding the  
border during the ongoing NATO airstrikes against the Serb 
military, now in their second week. 
</P>
<P>
	At least three Army teams had been out on a reconnaissance  
mission together, but had split up to engage in some rough terrain 
training, the Pentagon said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Army reconnaissance team was a part of the former U.N.  
peacekeeping operation in Macedonia called ``Able Sentry,'' which 
ended in February. 
</P>
<P>
	The force of about 1,200 included about 350 Americans, who  
remained in the region following the March 24 start of NATO 
airstrikes to act as a protective force. 
</P>
<P>
	National security adviser Sandy Berger informed President  
Clinton, who was tracking the search's progress, said David Leavy, 
a White House spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're still determined to push forward on our sustained air  
campaign and the operation will continue'' against military targets 
in Yugoslavia, Leavy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has cautioned from the beginning of the airstrikes on  
March 24 against Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic that 
Americans would be put at risk during NATO operations. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, an F-117A stealth fighter went down near Belgrade,  
the Yugoslav capital, after it was apparently hit with a Serb 
anti-aircraft missile. It was the first time the radar-evading 
aircraft had gone down in combat. 
</P>
<P>
	The American pilot, who received only minor injuries, was  
rescued six hours later.

<HEADLINE> Stewart Leaves as Missouri Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBIA, Mo. (AP) -- Norm Stewart retired as Missouri basketball  
coach today after 32 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart leaves as college basketball's third winningest active  
coach with 731 victories. 
</P>
<P>
	``Stormin' Norman'', as he was known for animated prowling of  
the sidelines, will continue as special assistant to the 
chancellor. He is 64. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart's last team went 20-9, losing in the first round of the  
NCAA tournament to New Mexico. It was another postseason 
disappointment for Missouri -- Stewart took the Tigers to the 
tournament 16 times without ever reaching the Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
	The winless streak included the heartbreaking 75-74 loss to then  
top-ranked and eventual champion UCLA in the second-round in 1995 
when Tyson Edney took the ball with 4.8 seconds left and drove 
through the Tigers the length of the court for a layup. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart, who made his announcement at a news conference, did not  
say what was behind his decision. Instead, he reminisced about his 
career and the teams he had coached. 
</P>
<P>
	``I came to Missouri a young man and I'm leaving a young man,''  
Stewart said after being given a standing ovation by several 
hundred supporters, players and others in the Hearnes Center. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement followed reports Wednesday of a falling-out  
between Stewart and athletic director Mike Alden. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart said today that the retirement was his own idea.  
</P>
<P>
	He informed Alden of the decision on March 15, three days after  
the New Mexico loss. At the end of the annual postseason meeting, 
Stewart said, ``I think I'd like to step down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He shocked me,'' Alden said today. ``I asked him, `Coach, are  
you sure?''' They met again the next day and Stewart said the same 
thing, Alden said. 
</P>
<P>
	Alden said he has no short list of candidates in mind to succeed  
Stewart, who took part as a player or coach in 1,127 of the 2,150 
games played by Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart weathered colon cancer and an NCAA investigation during  
his tenure. He was diagnosed with cancer after he collapsed on a 
team flight to Oklahoma in February 1989 and missed the last 14 
games of that season. 
</P>
<P>
	``What a great showing,'' Stewart said today of the fan reaction  
he received when he returned to coaching. ``I'll never forget this. 
What a great showing when I came back when I was stricken with 
cancer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the road, he often heard the chant, ``Sit Down Norm.''  
</P>
<P>
	Stewart concluded his remarks by saying he loved the chant.  
</P>
<P>
	``You know what I said to myself that day when they said `Sit  
Down Norm' -- I think I will,'' Stewart said.

<HEADLINE> Nissan To Take Renault Executive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Nissan Diesel Motor Co., a truck-making subsidiary  
of Japan's debt-laden Nissan Motor Co., said Thursday it will 
accept an executive from French automaker Renault SA. 
</P>
<P>
	The move followed Saturday's agreement that Renault will invest  
$5.4 billion in Nissan Motor to buoy the Japanese automaker, 
creating the world's fourth-largest auto partnership. 
</P>
<P>
	A Nissan Diesel Motor official, who spoke on condition of  
anonymity, declined to say when the French executive will assume 
the post or to detail the new person's responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
	In a restructuring effort, Nissan Diesel will halve the number  
of its top managers from the current total of 10, and the French 
executive will become one of the remaining five, the official said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the reduction of the executive staff would be approved  
at a shareholders' meeting, expected to be held in late June. 
</P>
<P>
	Under an agreement signed in Tokyo between Renault and Nissan  
Motor Co., Renault will take a 36.8 percent stake in Nissan Motor 
and a 22.5 percent state in Nissan Diesel Motor Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Nissan Diesel Motor is capitalized at 11.8 billion yen ($99  
million) and is now 39.8 owned percent by Nissan Motor Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Nissan Diesel Motor produced 29,033 trucks and buses in 1998,  
down 40.8 percent from a year earlier, the official said.

<HEADLINE> Farrakhan Treated in D.C. Hospital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan remains  
under treatment at Howard University Hospital, but there is little 
official word about his condition. 
</P>
<P>
	A statement Wednesday from the Nation of Islam newspaper, The  
Final Call, said Farrakhan's treatment `continues to be successful 
and his prognosis is excellent.' 
</P>
<P>
	Farrakhan, who was treated for prostate cancer several years  
ago, has been ill since early January with an undiagnosed 
condition, according to a Final Call article last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Farrakhan, 65, was admitted Tuesday afternoon.  
</P>
<P>
	Civil rights leader Jesse Jackson said Farrakhan underwent  
prostate surgery Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fortunately because he has kept up with it and maintained the  
discipline he's been able to more or less control it,'' Jackson 
said. ``And my sense is that the doctors today are satisfied with 
the effect of their work today. We can only pray and hope for the 
best results.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At a March 19 press conference in Chicago, Nation of Islam  
Minister of Health Abdul Alim Muhammad said Farrakhan was being 
treated in Chicago, where he lives, for complications stemming from 
treatment of his prostate cancer. Alim said Farrakhan was not in 
any imminent danger. 
</P>
<P>
	A source within the Nation of Islam said Farrakhan, his family --  
including his wife, daughter and son-in-law -- and an entourage flew 
here Tuesday from Chicago, where Farrakhan lives.

<HEADLINE> Police Kill Texas Shooting Suspect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- A 19-year-old man suspected in four  
slayings was shot to death by police after aiming a handgun at 
officers who had stopped his car. 
</P>
<P>
	Arthur Goodman was shot in the back seat of a white Mercury  
Cougar that had been pulled over on Interstate 35 late Wednesday, 
Lt. Ric Clark said. It wasn't clear if Goodman fired his gun. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodman was a suspect in the Monday night shootings of his  
girlfriend, Sandy Witt, 20, Naomi Martinez, 23, Erica Arispe, 21, 
and Penny Estrada, 21, who was pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
	A fifth victim, maintenance man Larry Hammond, was wounded as he  
ran to investigate the shootings at an apartment in Abilene, 185 
miles west of Fort Worth. He was in serious condition at Hendrick 
Medical Center early today. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodman had been charged with capital murder.  
</P>
<P>
	Three people who were in the car with him were questioned,  
including Goodman's 16-year-old brother. 
</P>
<P>
	The motive behind the shootings remains murky. Police said  
Goodman may have heard that Ms. Witt was about to inform on him or 
had refused to provide him with an alibi for another crime, 
possibly a shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	The others were killed because they happened to be at the  
apartment, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Officers also suspected Goodman was involved in the Sunday night  
shooting of 16-year-old Jimmy Estrada at his home. Authorities said 
Estrada, who survived, is not related to victim Penny Estrada.

<HEADLINE> Grains, Soybeans Down in Short Week / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures finished a  
holiday-shortened trading week lower Thursday on the Chicago Board 
of Trade under continued pressure from perceptions U.S. supplies 
will continue to build. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices were pushed lower in follow-through selling from  
Wednesday's weak close, when market participants interpreted the 
government's planting intentions and stocks reports as meaning 
supplies will increase in the face of anemic world demand. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn and soybeans also were pressured by harvesting of bumper  
competing crops in South America and prospects for beneficial 
weather in the Midwest that could aid early spring planting. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat fell after weekly export figures came in at the lowest so  
far this marketing year, as supplies rise to their highest in more 
than 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for July delivery fell 4 1/2 cents to $2.86 1/4 a bushel; May  
fell 3 1/2 cents to $2.22 a bushel; May oats rose 1/4 cent to $1.14 1/2 a 
bushel, while other contract months fell; May soybeans fell 1/2 cent 
to $4.83 1/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Meat and livestock futures were mostly higher on the Chicago  
Mercantile Exchange amid expectations those items would be included 
in any new food aid package to Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	June live cattle cattle rose .85 cent to 64.45 cents a pound;  
May feeder cattle rose .83 cent to 72.90 cents a pound; June lean 
hogs rose .60 cent to 52.95 cents a pound; July pork bellies rose 
.25 cent to 51.70 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Thompson Breaks Swimming Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- American swimmer Jenny Thompson lost her world  
record in the 100-meter individual medley for a few minutes Friday 
night, reclaiming it and a $15,000 bonus in the World Short-Course 
Swimming Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson, of Dover, N.H., set a new mark of 59.30 seconds during  
a qualifying heat just after Slovakia's Martina Moravcova had won 
her heat in 1:00.35, slightly under the world record of 1:00.41 
that Thompson set in January. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the third world mark to fall in the meet, in which FINA,  
swimming's world governing body, is offering $15,000 for world 
records for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	Australia's chances for a world mark in the men's 800-meter  
freestyle relay disappeared when its team was disqualified in the 
heats for not following the listed order of its four swimmers. The 
coach said a jury refused to hear Australia's argument that 
officials were partly to blame. 
</P>
<P>
	Australian Grant Hackett was on a record pace for 300 meters in  
heats of the men's 400-meter freestyle, but finished 0.85 seconds 
behind the world mark of 3:39.82 held by 16-year-old teammate Ian 
Thorpe. 
</P>
<P>
	Thorpe, who broke the 200-meter freestyle world record on  
Thursday, won his heat in 3:43.35, with Italian Massi Rosolino just 
behind in 3:43.88. 
</P>
<P>
	Those swimmers had another chance at the 400 record in the  
finals Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	But a team that would have included Thorpe, Hackett, 200-meter  
long-course world champion Michael Klim and Matthew Dunn lost its 
chance at the relay record held by Australia because of the 
disqualification. 
</P>
<P>
	Even without Thorpe, Hackett and Klim in the lineup, the  
Australians finished in 7:04.73, just two seconds off the 
2-year-old world mark. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Don Talbot said the Australian quartet entered in the  
heats -- Dunn, Todd Pearson, Daniel Kowalski and Ray Hass -- did not 
follow the order he had listed on the entry card. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said officials did not allow the Australians to check the  
entry card again just before the race to make sure the order was 
correct, and a meet official assigned to ensure the correct order 
did not do so. He added that Canada was not disqualified for a 
women's relay team that swam out of order Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly there was fault with us,'' Talbot said, ``but I  
think everybody has a right to argue their case. They didn't want 
to hear that there was error on their side. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to rebound from the disappointment. They were set on  
getting a world record, and there's bonus money for that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In another setback, Australian Samantha Riley, world  
record-holder in the women's 200-meter breaststroke, failed to 
qualify for the final, finishing 10th in qualifying. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the end of 100 I felt OK, but when I went to push it I had  
nothing to give,'' said Riley, whose world record, set in 1995, is 
2:20.85. ``I don't know what happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first time since 1993 that Riley, the 1994 world  
champion at 100 and 200 meters, had failed to reach a major final. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson's record swim came shortly after she had finished  
second in qualifying for the 50-meter butterfly. Her time of 26.71 
was behind her own world mark of 26.05 and second to Dutch swimmer 
Inge de Briujn's 26.16. 
</P>
<P>
	She also holds the world short-course (25-meter) record in the  
100 butterfly, and is the world long-course (50-meter) champion in 
the 100 freestyle and 100 butterfly. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday night, she was to swim semifinals in the 100 medley  
and 50 butterfly, and the 100 freestyle final. 
</P>
<P>
	In line with a new Olympic format, semifinals are being held in  
50- and 100-meter races. Thompson was fastest in the 100 freestyle 
semifinals Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Sweden set a world record Thursday in the women's 800 freestyle  
relay. 
</P>
<P>
	In other qualifying Friday, Olympic champion Alexander Popov of  
Russia and world short-course record holder Mark Foster of Britain 
coasted into the semifinals of the men's 50 freestyle. 
</P>
<P>
	World record-holder Jani Sievinen was fourth in qualifying for  
the men's 100 medley. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuban Rodolfo Falcon, winner of the men's 50 backstroke, was  
third fastest in qualifying for the 200, behind Australian Josh 
Watson and Canada's Mark Versfeld.

<HEADLINE>  Diallo Case Shows Courtroom Divide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The cheering began as the parents of Amadou  
Diallo left the prosecutor's office. 
</P>
<P>
	Black bystanders fell in behind the couple Wednesday as they  
marched two blocks to a courthouse where four white police officers 
pleaded innocent to murder charges in the shooting death of the 
Diallos' son, a 22-year-old street vendor from Guinea with no 
criminal record. 
</P>
<P>
	The officers heard cheers, too -- from scores of their off-duty  
colleagues, most of them white. 
</P>
<P>
	``On Feb. 4, in the vestibule in his own building, Amadou Diallo  
stood blameless, unarmed and defenseless when 19 of 41 shots were 
fired at him, struck him and killed him,'' prosecutor Robert 
Johnson told the court. ``These four defendants intended to take 
his life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The case has inspired a painful examination of police attitudes  
and tactics across the nation. Earlier this month, President 
Clinton said he was worried that recent charges of police 
misconduct could undermine the fight against crime. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 1,200 people have been arrested in the city in  
demonstrations since Diallo was cut down in the fusillade. Many of 
the protesters -- white and black, celebrities and common folk -- 
also demonstrated against the alleged police torture of Haitian 
immigrant Abner Louima in 1997 and the feeling that law-abiding 
minorities are routinely humiliated by police stop-and-search 
tactics. 
</P>
<P>
	``Amadou's blood will feed the battle for justice,'' his mother,  
Kadiadou Diallo, told 1,000 supporters outside the courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Jesse Jackson, who was arrested at a Feb. 19 rally  
protesting the Diallo killing, praised prosecutors for taking what 
he called ``the first step in the pursuit of justice'' but added 
that ``justice will not prevail until the officers are punished for 
the crime.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Even under duress,'' Jackson said, ``those who are called to  
uphold the law must be held at a higher standard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The killing has frayed Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's already tense  
relationship with New York's black community. Many have accused him 
of failing to understand the depth of New Yorkers' anger over the 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani declined to comment on the charges, but said earlier in  
the day: ``We should allow the criminal justice system to now 
operate. ... Now you move to another stage in which the crime has 
to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officers Kenneth Boss, Sean Carroll, Edward McMellon and Richard  
Murphy -- who were searching for a rape suspect and fired apparently 
believing Diallo had a gun -- showed little emotion when the charges 
were read. 
</P>
<P>
	Each was indicted on two counts of second-degree murder and one  
count of reckless endangerment. They could get 25 years to life in 
prison on the murder charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge John Collins set bail at $100,000 for each officer,  
although Johnson had asked that they be held without bail. The 
officers were immediately suspended from the force. They had been 
on desk duty. 
</P>
<P>
	Marvyn Kornberg, Carroll's lawyer, called the murder count  
``ludicrous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``What's the district attorney saying, that they had nothing to  
do that night but roll up on an individual and attempt to kill him 
because he's black?'' he asked. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for the four officers spoke separately in court,  
offering the first glimpse of the defense account of what went 
wrong the night they confronted Diallo outside his Bronx apartment 
building. 
</P>
<P>
	James Culleton, Murphy's lawyer, said his client ``had a sick  
feeling inside of him, believing that he was going to be shot, and 
he reacted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Culleton and Steven Brounstein, Boss's attorney, said their  
clients fired because they saw an officer on the ground. McMellon 
reportedly slipped and fell as the officers confronted Diallo. 
</P>
<P>
	Boss ``believed there was a fire fight was going on,''  
Brounstein said. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference, Johnson criticized the officers for  
choosing not to testify before the grand jury which voted last week 
to indict them. 
</P>
<P>
	``Having exercised that right, they cannot then say, `We're  
police officers, therefore what we did was OK,''' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without explanation, what we have is four people driving up to  
a location, pulling out their guns and killing an individual.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Al Sharpton, who organized daily protests against the  
shooting, praised the grand jury's action. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can only say that it is appropriate that these policemen  
have been indicted for murder,'' he said. Diallo's father would 
only say, ``I'm very happy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since the shooting, New York's street-crime unit has been  
ordered to wear uniforms instead of plainclothes, and 50 slots at 
the predominantly white division will be reassigned to minority 
police officers. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Wednesday, Giuliani and Police Commissioner Howard Safir  
attended an emotional tribute to a cop killed in the line of duty 
in 1996. Safir called Diallo's death a tragedy but urged NYPD 
critics to ``acknowledge the tragedies that befall our family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We grieve for Amadou Diallo and the four officers involved and  
pray they get a fair trial,'' Safir said.

<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- If John Elway decides to come back for another  
season, he'll face Dan Marino Sept. 13 on ABC's ``Monday Night 
Football.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miami will play at Denver in the first Monday night game of the  
season. ABC, which begins its 30th season of Monday night coverage, 
has decided to bring back the traditional starting time of 9 p.m. 
after ratings fell last season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Broncos will also appear on ``Monday Night Football'' on  
Nov. 22 against Oakland and on Dec. 13 at Jacksonville. 
</P>
<P>
	``The goal in TV is to enable as many viewers as possible to  
watch,'' said ABC spokesman Mark Mandel. ``The move back to 9 p.m. 
will accomplish that. Last year's 8:20 p.m. experiment proved to us 
that people wanted it to start later.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seven other teams will play on Monday night three times this  
year other than Denver, including last year's Super Bowl loser, 
Atlanta. The others are Miami, New York Jets, Dallas, Green Bay, 
Minnesota and San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	ESPN's first game will feature the expansion Cleveland Browns'  
debut, at home against Pittsburgh on Sept. 12 at 8:20 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	It marks the second year that ESPN will televise an entire  
schedule. Previously, it had split games with TNT. 
</P>
<P>
	ESPN will showcase all 12 playoff teams in an improved schedule  
from last year. The winning percentage of the teams on last year's 
slate was under .500. This season's teams won 55 percent of their 
games last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Only six teams will not be shown on either schedule:  
Indianapolis, Chicago, Philadelphia, Cincinnati, St. Louis and San 
Diego.

<HEADLINE> Players Are Mixed to Uniform Ads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Some baseball players were angered by a plan to  
have them pitch ads on their uniforms. Others said it was a sign of 
the times. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just employees of the Cleveland Indians, so whatever  
they want us to wear, we'll wear,'' catcher Sandy Alomar said 
Thursday. ``But pretty soon we're going to look like race car 
drivers or Boy Scouts with these badges everywhere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With baseball and its players' association conducting  
negotiations to sell ads on 1- to 1 1/2-inch square patches, players 
were wondering which companies would step up to the plate with some 
cash. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first thing I think of is somebody's bail bonds on the  
back of the `Bad News Bears'' uniforms,'' Baltimore pitcher Mike 
Mussina said, ``So it's going to be my name, my number and Joe's 
Bail Bonds?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Actually, Mike, it was Chico's Bail Bonds in the movie. And  
baseball said it might negotiate one deal with a national company. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's about the right time for that the happen,'' said Bill  
Potts, vice president of marketing for Foster Grant sunglasses. 
``It's worth a lot. You can imagine the exposure you would get from 
having a patch on a baseball player's uniform.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Oakland pitcher Tom Candiotti wasn't happy with the idea.  
</P>
<P>
	``It seems like every traditional thing about this game is going  
out the window,'' he said. ``So what's next?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Philadelphia outfielder Ron Gant agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``Ads belong on billboards and on walls, not on uniforms,'' he  
said. ``To me, my uniform is sacred, and I'd like to keep it that 
way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland Indians manager Mike Hargrove said the size and  
placement of any ads would make a difference. 
</P>
<P>
	``As long as it's not on the chest -- `Pepsi Indians.' I'd have a  
little bit of a tough time with that,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	With salaries at record levels, some players saw the connection  
between the ads and their paychecks. 
</P>
<P>
	``The purists don't pay the bills. It's all about dollars and  
cents,'' Milwaukee Brewers infielder David Nilsson said. ``I think 
it's necessary. It's for the economic benefit of baseball. It's 
done in every other sport around the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The idea for the ads came out of discussions between the  
players' association and the commissioner's office about what 
constitutes the uniform, according to Gene Orza, the No. 2 official 
of the players' association. Some players have worn mock 
turtlenecks in recent years with the logos of athletic equipment 
companies, such as Nike. 
</P>
<P>
	While the union is taking part in the talks, the players'  
association won't necessarily get a 50-50 split of the cash. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're the bosses. They can make us do whatever they want,''  
Chicago Cubs first baseman Mark Grace said. ``We're walking 
billboards, if that's what they want us to do.''

</P>
<P>
	The officers heard cheers, too -- from scores of their off-duty  
colleagues, most of them white. 
</P>
<P>
	``On Feb. 4, in the vestibule in his own building, Amadou Diallo  
stood blameless, unarmed and defenseless when 19 of 41 shots were 
fired at him, struck him and killed him,'' prosecutor Robert 
Johnson told the court. ``These four defendants intended to take 
his life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The case has inspired a painful examination of police attitudes  
and tactics across the nation. Earlier this month, President 
Clinton said he was worried that recent charges of police 
misconduct could undermine the fight against crime. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 1,200 people have been arrested in the city in  
demonstrations since Diallo was cut down in the fusillade. Many of 
the protesters -- white and black, celebrities and common folk -- 
also demonstrated against the alleged police torture of Haitian 
immigrant Abner Louima in 1997 and the feeling that law-abiding 
minorities are routinely humiliated by police stop-and-search 
tactics. 
</P>
<P>
	``Amadou's blood will feed the battle for justice,'' his mother,  
Kadiadou Diallo, told 1,000 supporters outside the courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Jesse Jackson, who was arrested at a Feb. 19 rally  
protesting the Diallo killing, praised prosecutors for taking what 
he called ``the first step in the pursuit of justice'' but added 
that ``justice will not prevail until the officers are punished for 
the crime.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Even under duress,'' Jackson said, ``those who are called to  
uphold the law must be held at a higher standard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The killing has frayed Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's already tense  
relationship with New York's black community. Many have accused him 
of failing to understand the depth of New Yorkers' anger over the 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani declined to comment on the charges, but said earlier in  
the day: ``We should allow the criminal justice system to now 
operate. ... Now you move to another stage in which the crime has 
to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officers Kenneth Boss, Sean Carroll, Edward McMellon and Richard  
Murphy -- who were searching for a rape suspect and fired apparently 
believing Diallo had a gun -- showed little emotion when the charges 
were read. 
</P>
<P>
	Each was indicted on two counts of second-degree murder and one  
count of reckless endangerment. They could get 25 years to life in 
prison on the murder charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge John Collins set bail at $100,000 for each officer,  
although Johnson had asked that they be held without bail. The 
officers were immediately suspended from the force. They had been 
on desk duty. 
</P>
<P>
	Marvyn Kornberg, Carroll's lawyer, called the murder count  
``ludicrous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``What's the district attorney saying, that they had nothing to  
do that night but roll up on an individual and attempt to kill him 
because he's black?'' he asked. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for the four officers spoke separately in court,  
offering the first glimpse of the defense account of what went 
wrong the night they confronted Diallo outside his Bronx apartment 
building. 
</P>
<P>
	James Culleton, Murphy's lawyer, said his client ``had a sick  
feeling inside of him, believing that he was going to be shot, and 
he reacted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Culleton and Steven Brounstein, Boss's attorney, said their  
clients fired because they saw an officer on the ground. McMellon 
reportedly slipped and fell as the officers confronted Diallo. 
</P>
<P>
	Boss ``believed there was a fire fight was going on,''  
Brounstein said. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference, Johnson criticized the officers for  
choosing not to testify before the grand jury which voted last week 
to indict them. 
</P>
<P>
	``Having exercised that right, they cannot then say, `We're  
police officers, therefore what we did was OK,''' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without explanation, what we have is four people driving up to  
a location, pulling out their guns and killing an individual.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Al Sharpton, who organized daily protests against the  
shooting, praised the grand jury's action. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can only say that it is appropriate that these policemen  
have been indicted for murder,'' he said. Diallo's father would 
only say, ``I'm very happy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since the shooting, New York's street-crime unit has been  
ordered to wear uniforms instead of plainclothes, and 50 slots at 
the predominantly white division will be reassigned to minority 
police officers. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Wednesday, Giuliani and Police Commissioner Howard Safir  
attended an emotional tribute to a cop killed in the line of duty 
in 1996. Safir called Diallo's death a tragedy but urged NYPD 
critics to ``acknowledge the tragedies that befall our family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We grieve for Amadou Diallo and the four officers involved and  
pray they get a fair trial,'' Safir said.

<HEADLINE> Police Investigate Transvestite Slay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CORDELE, Ga. (AP) -- A 33-year-old transvestite was beaten to  
death in rural Georgia, and authorities were investigating the 
beating as a possibly hate-motivated crime. 
</P>
<P>
	Covered with blood and bleeding from head wounds, Tracey  
Thompson managed to walk a half mile to a farmhouse before he lost 
consciousness. He died Tuesday at a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	``We backtracked where he had walked down the dirt road and  
found the crime scene,'' Sheriff Stacy Bloodworth said Wednesday. 
``In the middle of the road were blood and a partial piece of a 
baseball bat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bat appears to be the murder weapon, Georgia Bureau of  
Investigation agent Gary Rothwell said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Rothwell said authorities were able to question Thompson before  
he died, but he declined to say what the victim told them. He said 
Thompson lapsed into unconsciousness while he was being questioned. 
</P>
<P>
	Possible motives ranged from robbery to a sex- or hate-crime,  
Rothwell said. But the state has no specific law that provides for 
extra punishment for attacking a person because of his or her 
sexual orientation. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson, who also used the names Billy Joe Turner and Tracey  
Turner, was wearing blue jeans and a white shirt dotted with pink 
flowers, and the couple whose home he went to at first thought he 
was a woman, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rothwell said Thompson lived in Dalton in northern Georgia but  
was often seen at truck stops along Interstate 75 in southern 
Georgia. Cordele is about 10 miles off the interstate in southern 
Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know whether or not this (killing) had anything to do  
with his lifestyle,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The beating took place late Monday or early Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Atlanta Police Officer Killed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- A man suspected of fatally shooting a police  
officer was arrested after he fled in a patrol car, crashed the 
vehicle and then ran into a church where the rector subdued him 
during evening services, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kimini Atu Archie was cornered inside the sacristy of St. Luke's  
Episcopal Church, moments after police said he shot Officer Russell 
Stalnaker, 24. 
</P>
<P>
	Officers had stopped Archie on Wednesday evening when they found  
him pushing a pickup truck along a downtown street, said Lt. 
William Charles. 
</P>
<P>
	An argument started and officers wrestled him to the ground. As  
they tried to handcuff him, Archie pulled a gun and shot Stalnaker, 
Charles said. 
</P>
<P>
	The officers returned fire and Archie, 24, jumped into a police  
car and tried to drive away. He wrecked about a block later and 
fled on foot. 
</P>
<P>
	At St. Luke's, Archie allegedly tried to steal a woman's car.  
When she screamed, he dropped the gun, darted inside the church and 
ran down the aisle in front of worshipers, said parishioner Joe 
Geshwiller. 
</P>
<P>
	The church security guard gave chase along with the Rev. Spenser  
Simrill. 
</P>
<P>
	``They chased the man down the aisle while the service was going  
on, and he ran through a side door mistakenly into the sacristry 
that holds the communion sacraments,'' Geshwiller said. 
</P>
<P>
	Simrill, who once worked as a police officer, grabbed the man  
and held him in a bear hug until he stopped struggling, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Archie was jailed overnight on a charge of felony murder.  
</P>
<P>
	Police Chief Beverly Harvard said Stalnaker had been on the  
force for three years and was recently married. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've lost a family member,'' she said. ``For me, as a chief,  
it's almost like losing a child.''

<HEADLINE> Nets' Jayson Williams Breaks Leg </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Jayson Williams broke his right leg  
in a fourth-quarter collision with New Jersey Nets teammate Stephon 
Marbury on Thursday night and will be sidelined for the rest of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	X-rays disclosed that Williams, 31, broke his leg in the  
collision in the final minute of the Nets' 90-85 victory over the 
Atlanta Hawks. He was admitted to Hackensack Medical Center late 
Thursday and will be evaluated on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The break occurred around the shin area of Williams' leg.  
Doctors could either opt to put the leg in a cast or it might be 
necessary to repair the leg with surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, who signed a six-year, $90 million contract before the  
season, was averaging 8.0 points and 12.1 rebounds, second best in 
the league. He had 11 points and 10 rebounds before being injured 
with 50.9 seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams was hurt after slamming his right leg into Marbury's  
back seconds after Marbury hit a floater in the lane to give New 
Jersey an 87-83 lead. It was a collision of players going in 
different directions, with Williams looking to crash the boards 
from the right wing and Marbury falling backward toward the 
sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
	Both players lay on the court for a couple of minutes and play  
wasn't stopped until Atlanta's Dikembe Mutombo was fouled at the 
other end eight seconds later.

<HEADLINE> USDA Proposes Milk Price Overhaul </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal milk pricing regions would be  
consolidated and the formulas used to determine how dairy farmers 
are paid would be changed under a major overhaul of dairy policy 
proposed by the Agriculture Department. 
</P>
<P>
	The changes, which must be approved by milk producers, are  
expected to benefit consumers only slightly: The government expects 
the average price of drinking milk to drop by about 2 cents a 
gallon. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the government said significant strides had been made.  
</P>
<P>
	``These reforms will help make sure that America's dairy farmers  
receive a fair price and that American consumers continue to enjoy 
an abundant affordable supply of milk,'' Agriculture Secretary Dan 
Glickman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's milk pricing regions are divided into what are  
called milk marketing orders, which set the price processors pay 
dairy farmers. Under the changes, the milk marketing orders would 
be reduced from 31 to 11. 
</P>
<P>
	The newly consolidated orders must be approved by either  
two-thirds of producers in a marketing area or by producers who 
supply two-thirds of the milk in a marketing area. If these 
producer referendums are approved, the changes will take effect 
Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	The pricing formulas would also see changes. The basic formula  
price, which establishes the minimum price for milk used in nearly 
all dairy products, would be replaced with a formula that looks at 
multiple across-the-board components. The basic formula price had 
been based on the price of raw milk used for cheese in Minnesota 
and Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the biggest and most contentious changes would be in the  
differentials received by farmers, which would vary by region. For 
instance, farmers in Texas would see their differential drop from 
$3.16 to $2.10 per hundredweight, while the Chicago area would see 
an increase from $1.40 to $1.95. 
</P>
<P>
	The differentials, which help cover the cost of dairy farming in  
those areas, are higher for regions that are considered milk 
deficient. They have also sparked the ire of farmers in the Upper 
Midwest who complain that the pricing system is more favorable to 
dairy farmers in the West, South and other regions. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday, the reaction from Congress was mixed.  
</P>
<P>
	``Secretary Glickman's decision is like a bad April Fool's  
joke,'' said Sen. Jim Jeffords, R-Vt. ``This plan will likely cost 
New England dairy farmers $1.5 million per week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Russell Feingold, D-Wis., said while the reforms will help  
some, the plan means farmers in his state will get ``far less for 
their milk than they should.'' 
</P>
<P>
	E. Linwood Tipton, president of the International Dairy Foods  
Association, which represents processors, said he was still 
evaluating the proposal but that ``a very early reading indicates 
that they may have moved the chairs on the deck, but not moved us 
much further toward true reform.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jerry Kozak, chief executive officer of the National Milk  
Producers Federation, said his organization was also still 
reviewing the complex decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	The overhaul reforms a milk marketing order system that has been  
in place since the 1930s. The orders essentially prevent processors 
from playing producers against each other to drive down the price. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1996 farm bill ordered Glickman to consolidate to between 10  
and 14 orders. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the new proposal, the 11 orders will include the following  
areas: Northeast, Appalachian, Florida, Southeast, Mideast, Upper 
Midwest, Central, Southwest, Arizona-Las Vegas, Western and Pacific 
Northwest.

<HEADLINE> Longtime Mizzou Coach Stewart Quits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBIA, Mo. (AP) -- Norm Stewart left Thursday after 32 seasons  
as Missouri basketball coach, and insisted it was his idea. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart, 64, said the inspiration came during a game at Kansas  
in January and a familiar chant from Jayhawks fans, ``Sit down, 
Norm!'' took on a different meaning. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said to myself that day, `I think I will,''' said Stewart,  
who will complete the final four years of his contract as a special 
assistant to the school's chancellor. 
</P>
<P>
	Athletic director Mike Alden, who has been at the school only  
eight months, said he didn't push Stewart out, as had been 
speculated. Alden said he was ``shocked'' when the coach brought it 
up for the first time March 15 during what he thought would be a 
typical end-of-season review. He said Stewart reiterated his desire 
to retire from coaching the following day. 
</P>
<P>
	``I asked him, are you sure?'' Alden said. ``He said he had  
decided what he wanted to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then again, players were shocked Wednesday when Stewart broke  
the news to them. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was getting ready for class and my mom called me and she was  
like `Tell me the scoop, tell me the scoop,''' sophomore forward 
Johnnie Parker said. 
</P>
<P>
	Presumably, Stewart had earned the right to orchestrate his  
departure. He leaves with an impressive resume, at least from a 
numerical standpoint. 
</P>
<P>
	-- He's the third-winningest active coach with 731 victories  
(97-42 in six seasons at Northern Iowa, 634-333 at Missouri), 
trailing only James Phelan of Mount St. Mary's (800) and Bob Knight 
of Indiana (742), and he's eighth on the career list. 
</P>
<P>
	-- He averaged 19 victories a season at Missouri, and as player,  
assistant coach and coach was involved in more than half (1,127) of 
the 2,151 games played by the school 
</P>
<P>
	-- He produced eight conference championships and led his 16th  
team to the NCAA tournament this season with a 20-9 record. 
</P>
<P>
	-- He weathered colon cancer in 1989 and NCAA probation in 1991  
during his tenure. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart leaves the program in good shape, with three starters  
back and two others with significant experience. That's a big 
change from his arrival in 1967, when Missouri had totaled six 
victories in 49 games the previous two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I got here there wasn't much springboard,'' Stewart said.  
``There wasn't any pool, there wasn't any water. If you jumped in, 
you had problems. There's a better springboard now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the other hand, Missouri hasn't had much success in the  
postseason with a succession of first-round upset losses to lightly 
regarded opponents that began in the late 1980s. Missouri missed 
the NCAAs for three years beginning in 1995-96, going a combined 
51-47, before ending that drought this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart's Missouri teams twice made it to the final eight, in  
1976 and 1994, but never to the Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
	The game he may be most known for was a heartbreaking 75-74 loss  
to eventual champion UCLA in the second round in 1995. Tyus Edney 
drove the length of the court with 4.8 seconds for a game-winning 
layup. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a little too much emphasis on one game a year,''  
Stewart said. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement also came amid reports of a falling out between  
Stewart and Alden, who wasn't happy with Stewart's lack of response 
last week when junior Albert White said he wanted to jump to the 
NBA, and of repeated problems with players. Nine players have 
transferred in the past five years, including center Tate Decker, 
who went to Wake Forest last season after Stewart heaved a 
basketball at his head. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight of Stewart's current players attended the news conference,  
and the group did not include White or freshman point guard Keyon 
Dooling, who quarreled with Stewart during a game at Colorado in 
January. Stewart said the reason for the no-shows was he told them 
to attend class.
