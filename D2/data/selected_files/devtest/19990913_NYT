EMMYS GO TO `PRACTICE' AND TO `ALLY MCBEAL' 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The 51st annual Emmy Awards ceremony was marked on
Sunday night by plenty of deja vu.
</P>
<P>
   Although ``The Sopranos,'' the acclaimed new HBO series about a
Mafia family in suburban New Jersey, was expected to walk off with
numerous awards, it won only two. Veteran shows like ``The
Practice,'' ``Ally McBeal'' and ``N.Y.P.D. Blue'' emerged as
significant winners. ``Ally McBeal'' won for best comedy series and
for the second year in a row ``The Practice'' won for best drama
series.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard for dazzling new shows to break through at the
Emmys,'' said the actor John Lithgow, who won as best actor in a
comedy series for NBC's ``Third Rock From the Sun.'' He cited the
scarcity of awards to ``The Sopranos'' and said, ``The old guard
never seems to like new kids on the block.''
</P>
<P>
   David Chase, the creator of ``The Sopranos,'' won the Emmy for
writing of a drama series.
</P>
<P>
   And Edie Falco won the best-actress Emmy for a drama series for
her role as the shrewd and complicated Mafia wife in ``The
Sopranos.'' She beat such veteran television stars as Gillian
Anderson (``The X-Files''), Christine Lahti (``Chicago Hope'') and
Julianna Margulies (``E.R.''), as well as Lorraine Bracco, who
plays a psychiatrist on ``The Sopranos.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Falco said that she felt a little lonely as a winner when
some of her colleagues were passed up.
</P>
<P>
   The big winner of the night was David E. Kelley, creator of
``The Practice'' and ``Ally McBeal,'' two shows that took the top
drama and comedy prizes.
</P>
<P>
   And Dennis Franz won his fourth Emmy for his role as Andy
Sipowicz in ``N.Y.P.D. Blue.'' His rivals included James Gandolfini
of ``The Sopranos,'' Dylan McDermott of ABC's ``Practice,'' Sam
Waterston of ABC's ``Law and Order'' and Jimmy Smits of ``N.Y.P.D.
Blue.''
</P>
<P>
   Chase told reporters that he was unsure why ``The Sopranos'' had
been so resonant for many television viewers. ``It goes beyond the
success of `The Sopranos.' There's something about mob stories that
people love. It has to do with loyalty, high-stakes living. And
people identify oddly enough with that family.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the the top acting prizes went to Holland Taylor of
``The Practice'' on ABC; she won the supporting-actress Emmy for a
drama series. The supporting-actor award for a drama series went to
Michael Badalucco, also of ``The Practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Taylor, who is in her 50s, paid tribute to Kelley, thanking
him for creating ``a woman who is a viable human being over 40,
which America doesn't seem to want to go along with.''
</P>
<P>
   Moments after the three-hour ceremony began, Emmys were awarded
to previous winners of several longtime hit comedy shows.
</P>
<P>
   Kristen Johnston of NBC's ``Third Rock From the Sun'' was named
best supporting actress in a comedy series. It was the second time
Ms. Johnston had won for that role.
</P>
<P>
   Once again David Hyde Pierce of NBC's ``Frasier'' won the Emmy
for supporting actor in a comedy. It was his third Emmy for the
role. And Stanley Tucci won a leading-actor award for his role as
``Winchell,'' about the gossip columnist, over HBO.
</P>
<P>
   Under a pulsing sun, hundreds of television celebrities as well
as writers, directors and producers surged over the red carpet to
attend the ceremonies at the Los Angeles Shrine Auditorium, near
the campus of the University of Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   What stamped the Emmy show this year was the ascendancy of cable
television, namely the 16 nominations given to ``The Sopranos.'' It
was the most nominations given to a single show this year, and was
followed by 13 nominations for Fox's ``Ally McBeal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sopranos,'' had been rejected by the leading television
networks before HBO agreed to produce it. It was the first cable
series nominated for best drama.
</P>
<P>
   Besides HBO, such cable networks as Showtime, TNT and A&AMP;E also
competed for awards, a sharp contrast to the Emmy presentation a
decade ago when cable scored only 4 percent of the nominations and
were barely taken seriously by the voters of the Academy of
Television Arts and Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   Several Emmy hopefuls cited the impact of cable television on
the networks.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the networks were getting more daring, Smits of
``N.Y.P.D. Blue,'' said, ``Because of what's going on in cable,
they have to get edgier.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Johnston told reporters after she won the Emmy that she
never missed an episode of either ``The Sopranos'' or ``Sex and the
City,'' both HBO shows. ``It's a great force in television,'' she
said referring to the cable network.
</P>
<P>
   In the first hour of the awards ceremony winners for directing
included Thomas Schlamme for ABC's ``Sports Night'' and Paul Miller
for staging the 1998 Tony Awards on CBS.
</P>
<P>
   John Leguizamo won the Emmy for his performance in a variety
series in HBO's ``John Leguizamo's `Freak.''' Leguizamo called HBO
``the Hispanic Box Office'' for championing his shows. ``The Latin
voice is very lacking and missing in the media,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Rock, the comedian, also accepted an Emmy for the writers
on HBO's ``Chris Rock Show.''
</P>
<P>
   Jay Kogen, a top television comedy writer, won for writing
``Frasier.''
</P>
<P>
   Barclay of ABC's ``N.Y.P.D. Blue'' said he supported any
pressure on the networks to change.
</P>
<P>
   Anne Bancroft won for supporting actress in a mini-series for
the CBS drama ``Deep In My Heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Ann Peacock won for writing the HBO drama ``A Lesson Before
Dying.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter O'Toole won the supporting-actor award as Bishop Cauchon
on CBS's ``Joan of Arc.''
</P>
<P>
   The hosts for the awards were Jenna Elfman, a star of the ABC
comedy ``Dharma and Greg,'' and Pierce. Ms. Elfman was nominated in
the comedy actress field.
</P>
<P>
   The show began at 8 p.m. Eastern time. It was broadcast live on
Fox across most of the country, except in states like California,
which were on Pacific time. In those Western states, the broadcast
was delayed until 8 p.m. local time to gain the widest audience.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the Academy Awards, the Emmy winners in the 77
categories are not selected by a large number of voters. Nominees
are determined by a popular vote of the 9,500 members of the
American Academy of Television Arts and Sciences. But the winner of
each category is then selected by judging panels of Academy
volunteers who watch videotapes submitted by the nominees as
examples of their best work from the previous season. Perhaps 100
people pick the winner for best comedy, for example. A smaller
number select the winners of individual and technical categories.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The panels are sometimes older and unemployed academy members,
which can skew the vote against more unconventional choices. For
years ``Roseanne'' was ignored by the Emmys. In 1990 the risky
series ``Twin Peaks'' was the leading Emmy contender with 14
nominations, but walked off with only two technical awards. Critics
said the Emmy Awards were marked by middle-class stuffiness.
Similarly, HBO's acclaimed ``Larry Sanders Show,'' starring Garry
Shandling as a cynical talk show host, had 19 Emmy nominations
during its run, but failed to win the top prize for best comedy
series. In the show's last season in 1998, however, Shandling and
Peter Tolan won Emmys for best writers in a comedy series.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Academy Awards, the Emmys can save a winner from
oblivion. Such series as ``Hill Street Blues, `` ``Cagney and
Lacey,'' ``Cheers'' and even ``Mission: Impossible'' were
struggling to find audiences and in danger of being canceled until
they were named Emmy winners.
</P>
<P>
   The nominations for ``The Sopranos'' included ones for best
drama, best actor and best actress. It was the first cable series
nominated as best drama. Its fellow nominees, ``The Practice,''
``E.R.,'' ``N.Y.P.D. Blue'' and ``Law and Order,'' have already
earned Emmys in the drama category.
</P>
<P>
   The show had won perhaps the best reviews for a television
series this year. Its level of violence, often blunt street
language and sex would have disqualified if from any traditional
network. What potentially hurt the show somewhat in the voting was
that because it was on a pay-cable channel as opposed to a network,
the series was seen by a relatively small audience.
</P>
<P>
   HBO's comedy series ``Sex and the City,'' starring Sarah Jessica
Parker, also picked up the nomination for best comedy. Its rivals
were last year's winner, ``Frasier,'' as well as ``Friends,''
``Ally McBeal'' and ``Everybody Loves Raymond.''
</P>
<P>
   Overall HBO, which waged an aggressive Emmy campaign for its
shows, received 74 nominations, second to 82 for NBC, which has
hits like ``Friends'' and ``Frasier.'' ABC was third with 58,
followed by CBS with 46 and Fox with 33.
</P>
<P>
   Two long-standing hits suffered setbacks this year in terms of
Emmy nominations, a clear result of their longevity. ``E.R.,'' the
hospital series that received 16 nominations last year, earned only
6 this year, the lowest tally for the show since its first year of
eligibility in 1995. Cast changes played a role in the show's
decline. Similarly, ``The X-Files'' dropped from 16 nominations
last year to 8 this year. By contrast, ``Law and Order,'' which
broke into the top 20 for the first time last season, earned 9
nominations.

SEAHAWKS' BUMBLING DEBUT DEFIES POLITE DESCRIPTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The adjective ``inauspicious'' lacks the firepower to
describe Sunday's seasonal debut of the Seahawks.
</P>
<P>
   The words that do pack proper ordnance fail to meet this
newspaper's minimum standard for polite society.
</P>
<P>
   So we'll settle on this:
</P>
<P>
   Jets, '97 season opener.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, the horror. Oh, the humanity.
</P>
<P>
   That 41-3 loss was the worst opener in Seahawk history. While
the 28-20 defeat doesn't seem as gruesome on the scoreboard, the
opponent, along with the expectations for the Seahawks, make this
one every bit the same high dive into an empty pool.
</P>
<P>
   For coach Mike Holmgren, who for the past several seasons has
been living a fairy tale, this was a kiss from Broomhilda.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything that could go wrong, seemed to go wrong,'' said
Holmgren, normally a loquacious sort reduced to rummaging the
clich &UR; gfacute &LR; e bin. ``I was very surprised by it.''
</P>
<P>
   The only indecisive aspect about this whipping was who was
laughing louder: Joey Galloway or Dennis Erickson.
</P>
<P>
   Fergawdsakes, this was the Detroit Lions, 5-11 stiffs last year
and nine-point underdogs who were rocked by the retirement of
superstar running back Barry Sanders. Down three injured offensive
linemen _ they also lost standout wide receiver Herman Moore five
minutes into the game _ the Lions used a fifth-year stumblebum off
special teams, an ex-Nebraska bowling ball named Cory Schlesinger,
as a primary offensive weapon. He killed the Seahawk defense.
</P>
<P>
   On offense, the Seahawks rushed for 31 yards. Until Ricky
Watters staggered about for a 9-yard gain in the fourth quarter,
forward progress was measured in lengths of lint.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the worst first half of football,'' tight end
Christian Fauria said. ``We couldn't do anything right. We saved
face a little bit in the second half, but ... just to give them
points like we like them, man, it's just so hard to stay mentally
in it when that happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Down 25-7 at the half, the Seahawks weren't the only ones not
into it. Several thousand fans in the non-sellout sellout (the
goofs at Motorola covered the ticket-sale shortfall, so the game
could be locally splattered, er, telecast) abandoned their seats
for the second half. Perhaps they trundled across the street to the
Guilty Pleasure, where they have become used to a bad result, but
at least it's in the sun.
</P>
<P>
   No greater symbol of the day's ghastly nature existed than the
Kingdome's humble north-end service entrance: Not only did an
ambulance pass through it with the team's best player, linebacker
Chad Brown, a Seahawk punt snap went in the same general direction.
</P>
<P>
   Brown turned out to be OK, but was done for the day. The punt
snap is still going.
</P>
<P>
   Much was foretold on the Seahawks' first play from scrimmage, a
flea flicker in which Watters took the handoff and flipped the ball
back to quarterback Jon Kitna, who presumably would see the Detroit
secondary in various stages of flimflammery.
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren had the play scripted in the first series of 15, then
the night before decided to go with it at the top as a sort of
show-biz splash that would underscore the annoyingly ubiquitous
marketing phrase, ``It's Now Time.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Kitna was smashed for a 7-yard sack. The only ones
fooled were wearing bird helmets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was real excited about the play,'' Watters said. ``I thought
it would be a touchdown right away. I flipped the ball back, looked
downfield and saw Charles Jordan wide open. Then I looked back ...
aaaah!''
</P>
<P>
   The play was representative of the Seahawks' most obvious flaw:
Too much too soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like when you run a reverse or any other special, goofy
play, it's either real good or real bad,'' Holmgren said. ``There
is no middle ground. We had a chance, we just didn't block it
right. We have some young guys playing, and they didn't do that
right.''
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks have a lot of young guys playing, especially on
offense and particularly with the holdout of Galloway and Sunday's
injuries. There is so much to learn from so many new coaches that
the force-feeding inevitably makes for a lot of sloppy burping.
</P>
<P>
   Five minicamps, a full training camp and four exhibitions might
seem like a lot of time to introduce a new way. But it isn't, as
Sunday proved. Building winners usually takes a while, especially
when losing is just as stitched in as the Kingdome rug.
</P>
<P>
   Confusion still reigns, particularly among the receivers, nearly
all of whom are new this year.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about how Jordan's first-quarter injury absence affected
an already thin receiving corps, tight end Fauria, who also has
been out of action until Sunday with an injury, looked at the
reporter blankly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have Jordan,'' he said. Suddenly, he shook his head
hard and sheepishly. ``Oh, I thought you meant Michael. You mean
Charles.''
</P>
<P>
   Told you the Seahawks were thinking big.
</P>
<P>
   And, so far, playing small.
</P>
<P>
   It's not time.

GAGNE LOSES BATTLE BUT NOT WAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Most rookies wouldn't get the chance to pitch the
sixth inning. Not after the Los Angeles Dodgers rallied from two
runs down to take a one-run lead in the bottom of the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   But righty Greg Gagne's tenacity and toughness isn't
characteristic of a rookie, so Dodgers manager Davey Johnson let
the 23-year-old stay in.
</P>
<P>
   In the short term it backfired. The Mets scored three runs in
the sixth and then rolled to a 10-3 victory Sunday to take three of
four from the Dodgers in their lone visit to Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   What long-term effects Johnson's confidence in the
French-Canadian produced will have to wait, but both said the
experience was good.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a good day to learn,'' Gagne said. ``I didn't have
very good stuff. I had to battle. I'm sorry I let (Johnson) down.''
</P>
<P>
   It was much different than Gagne's major-league debut last
Tuesday against Florida, when he allowed two hits and struck out
eight in six scoreless innings. That effort prompted Johnson to
stick with Gagne for the sixth inning against the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Gagne nearly rewarded Johnson, but he made a few mistakes. With
the bases empty and two outs, he walked Mike Piazza on a curveball
instead of challenging him. Robin Ventura then singled and Shawon
Dunston doubled in two runs. Benny Agbayani added an RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was still a good outing,'' Johnson said. ``I liked what I
saw. After (Edgardo) Alfonso's (first-inning homer), he (bore) down
and didn't let it affect him. The way he handled it after two runs,
he was clean to the sixth, and I think he was good in the sixth. .
. . He didn't let the previous hitter affect him. He went right
after him.''
</P>
<P>
   Gagne (0-1) allowed five runs on six hits in six innings. He
walked three and struck out four.
</P>
<P>
   __ Judd shut down: First the Mets wracked right-hander Mike Judd
for four runs on three hits and three walks in a third of an inning
of relief, and then the Dodgers lowered the boom, perhaps ending
Judd's season because of tendinitis in his pitching shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to take any chances with him,'' Johnson said.
``We might shut him down the rest of the way. We'll have to see how
it goes.''
</P>
<P>
   Judd has felt the soreness in his shoulder since the club
returned from Florida last week, but he said he wanted to pitch
through it. However, after getting smacked around by the Mets, that
was put to an end.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Johnson said Judd's dud of a performance doesn't hamper
what the organization thinks of him. Judd impressed the Dodgers
with four solid starts before Gagne took over his spot in the
rotation so the club could get a look at another young arm.
</P>
<P>
   __ FYI: Dodgers right-hander Antonio Osuna pitched 11/3
scoreless innings in a rehab stint for Class-A San Bernardino and
is expected to be activated Tuesday. . . . Right-hander Robinson
Checo returned from a 41-game hiatus on the disabled list because
of a groin injury and uncorked a wild pitch on his first attempt.
He settled down and retired both batters he faced. . . . Dodgers
lefty Jeff Williams became the ninth Australian to pitch in the
major leagues when he made his debut in the ninth inning. He
allowed one run on one hit. . . . When Alfonso hit a two-run homer
in the first inning, it gave him 100 RBI and marked the first time
in club history three players drove in 100 runs in a season. Robin
Ventura (112) and Mike Piazza (112) also reached the century mark.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If the Los Angeles Dodgers accomplish their
mission of trading Eric Young during the offseason, they might
replace him by moving shortstop Mark Grudzielanek to second base.
</P>
<P>
   According to sources, the Dodgers have had backroom talks about
Grudzielanek changing positions and are considering it if they can
acquire the appropriate replacement at shortstop.
</P>
<P>
   The upcoming free-agent market is weak in comparison to others
years, particularly at the shortstop position. But it doesn't rule
out the Dodgers' making a deal that would include a shortstop,
sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Moving Grudzielanek to second would also give the Dodgers more
flexibility in the offseason. Instead of having to fill a need at
second base (if Young is traded), they could look for either a
second baseman or shortstop.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's our shortstop,'' Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone
said. ``That's all I'm going to say about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Grudzielanek, who went 4 for 5 in the Dodgers' 10-3 loss to the
Mets on Sunday, said he wouldn't be receptive to such a move. But
he also said he could be talked into it under the right
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ``It depends on the situation,'' Grudzielanek, 29, said. ``The
first instinct would be no. Who would be coming in? It would be no
one here. Right now, there's no way I would change. I'm thinking I
have a lot of years left at shortstop.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason for the possible change is that Grudzielanek
spent most of the offseason working on his defense with Bucky Dent,
and in a season gone awry, Grudzielanek is one of the few bright
spots. After averaging 31 errors in the last three seasons,
Grudzielanek has committed 11 this season.
</P>
<P>
   He also leads the Dodgers regulars with a .326 average. Since
leaving the disabled list July 6 after a broken hand, Grudzielanek
is hitting .355 (89 for 251). He is also trying to become the first
Dodgers shortstop to hit .300 in a season (minimum 100 at-bats)
since Maury Wills did it in 1963.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not many shortstops are hitting well over .300 and cut their
errors in half,'' Malone said. ``If we can get better, we'll look
to get better.''
</P>
<P>
   Grudzielanek leads National League shortstops in batting
average, but his bat at second base would add zing to the Dodgers'
lineup if they could acquire a strong offensive shortstop.
</P>
<P>
   Grudzielanek has limited experience as a second baseman. When he
was promoted to Montreal in 1995, he started 10 games at second. He
also started 25 games at third base. If the Dodgers ask
Grudzielanek to move over on the infield, they would want him to
work at it during the offseason, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said he plans to give Alex Cora a
strong look at shortstop the remaining 19 games, but there are
questions in the organization as to whether Cora can hit at the
big-league level. Cora's status is unrelated to Grudzielanek's
situation, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Cora is a player the Dodgers don't know well; he missed many of
the spring- training games with a broken hand. Cora, 23, hit .310
with Triple-A Albuquerque this season, but there is skepticism
since he was consistently overmatched in hitting .121 in 29 games
for the Dodgers last season. Sources said the Dodgers won't have
Grudzielanek change positions for a player of Cora's caliber.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before this year, I (thought about it) once or twice,''
Grudzielanek said of a position change. ``It was to the point where
I needed to improve what I was doing out there or make a change. No
question. But I went and worked with Bucky Dent and now I feel
comfortable with how I've played shortstop this season.''

RED SOX BEAT CLEMENS FOR SWEEP 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-YANKEES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ This is not about one man, as Yankees outfielder Paul
O'Neill claimed Friday night, when he said, ``We didn't get beat by
the Red Sox, we got beat by Pedro Martinez.''
</P>
<P>
   This is, as it has been for nearly six months, about something
else: The collective energies and will of an unflappable team that
has been undersold all summer but now, after winning, 4-1, Sunday
at Yankee Stadium to complete a stunning three-game sweep of the
Yankees in the Bronx and registering their first-ever win over
Roger Clemens, must be taken seriously as a threat in October.
</P>
<P>
   ``What (O'Neill) said is really how people look at this team,''
said outfielder Darren Lewis, whose bloop single off Clemens broke
a 1-1 tie in a three-run, eighth-inning rally touched off by rookie
Trot Nixon's single. ``We're not a bunch of superstars, just a
bunch of guys who play the game hard, play it right, and don't take
even one day lightly.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team has a bunch of guys where not one person is looking
for any credit. Nobody wants the credit. Everybody just wants to
show up and contribute what they can.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox have not yet assured themselves of a playoff spot,
even after their first sweep in Yankee Stadium in 13 years, all
three wins coming in front of full houses. The biggest of the three
(56,028) bore witness Sunday afternoon to a team that not only
refused to bow to Clemens's intimidation tactics, but responded
with some steel of its own, whether it was Bret Saberhagen throwing
in retaliation at Yankees third baseman Scott Brosius,
mild-mannered designated hitter Reggie Jefferson leveling Yankee
catcher Joe Girardi with a cross-body block to score the tying run
in the fourth, or flyweight Donnie Sadler flinging himself into
Girardi in a futile bid to score in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   The Oakland A's won for the third straight time against the
expansion Tampa Bay Devil Rays Sunday, leaving them three games
behind the Sox in the wild-card race. But this is no longer just
about making the playoffs as a bonus qualifier. The Sox have a shot
at winning the American League East, which in some ways is just
window dressing but nonetheless still makes a statement.
</P>
<P>
   With 19 games left, the Sox trail the Yankees by 3 1/2 games.
Time is short, but they've made up the same ground on the Bombers
when even more urgency was required: In 1978, the Sox were 3 1/2
back with 14 games to go and won their last eight to force the
Bucky Dent playoff game.
</P>
<P>
   And in the last 13 days, the Sox have shaved five games off a
Yankee lead that stood at 8 1/2 on the morning of Aug. 31. They are
as close to first place Monday as anytime since July 16, when they
were three games back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody's going to quit or get scared or anything like that,''
said Yankees manager Joe Torre.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go over and ask Jimy, I'll still take this situation,'' Torre
said, referring to Sox counterpart Jimy Williams. ``A four-game
bulge in the loss column, I'm sure he'd take that, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams insists he doesn't concern himself with such matters.
``I don't think we've changed from the first day of spring
training,'' he said when asked how the sweep might have altered the
Sox' approach to the final three weeks. ``It's just about the same.
We played good against a very good team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know who we were playing. These guys are the world
champions.''
</P>
<P>
   With one out in the top of the third, Clemens yelled at rookie
Wilton Veras for taking a big swing, then hit him in the back with
a 95-mile-an-hour fastball with the next pitch. Later that inning,
Clemens also barked at Jose Offerman after Offerman took offense to
a third-strike call by plate umpire John Hirschbeck.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was griping about the pitch and I liked the pitch, so
that's where the disagreement came in,'' said Clemens, who further
displayed his disgust with Offerman by firing his glove into the
Yankee dugout.
</P>
<P>
   Offerman barked back and had to be restrained by Williams from
heading in Clemens's direction. He refused after the game to
discuss what he said to Clemens, but there was no mistaking the
message from Saberhagen, who hit Scott Brosius in the derriere to
start the bottom of the third.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to let Roger know he can't control the game,'' said
Saberhagen, who gave up a leadoff home run to Chuck Knoblauch but
gave the Yankees just two more hits while striking out five in five
gritty innings that served as his first test in almost a month
since coming off the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he's yelling at Veras after he took that big swing, and
then hits him with the next pitch, that's not a coincidence. Then
he yelled at Offerman. You've got to come back and establish that
you're going to throw inside, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a big game, and he might have got caught up in the
emotion. We'd won the first two games, this was really the first
big game he's been in, and it's against the Red Sox, so his
emotions might have been on edge as it was.''
</P>
<P>
   Saberhagen was poker-faced when he hit Brosius, then even more
coolly picked him off second base, after shortstop Nomar
Garciaparra sneaked in behind the runner. The pickoff play was
typical of the Sox' crisp execution Sunday after making four errors
the day before.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson, who had doubled to center for the Sox' first hit off
Clemens in the fourth, reacted to Troy O'Leary's single to right by
throwing himself into Girardi just as O'Neill's throw from the
plate arrived.
</P>
<P>
   In the sixth, rookie first baseman Brian Daubach pulled
Offerman's relay out of the dirt to complete a double play as
lefthanded reliever Rheal Cormier came in after John Wasdin gave up
back-to-back singles and induced O'Neill to hit into the twin
killing before striking out Bernie Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Offerman, with Nixon on the move after his leadoff single in the
seventh, reached beyond the strike zone to slap a low-and-away
Clemens serving into left for a hit-and-run single. Then Lewis put
his bat on the ball, dropping a hit in front of Williams as Nixon
scored. After Jefferson drew a walk to load the bases, Offerman
came home on Garciaparra's shallow fly to center, as Williams's
throw was on line but took a big bounce over Girardi's head. The
Sox final run came home on another blooper, this one by O'Leary.
</P>
<P>
   By then, Clemens already had left, saddled with his first loss
in seven starts against the Sox.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gave him the ball today,'' Torre said of Clemens. ``That's
what I wanted and I got it. This was a big-game performance for
Roger. We just didn't hold up our end of the bargain.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox, meanwhile, continue to raise the bar on what has
been a remarkable trip: They are 7-2 on this 13-day, four-city
tour, with three games left in Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good feeling,'' Lewis said of the sweep. ``These guys
(the Yankees) can explode at any time. For us to come in here in
the middle of a long road trip and do what we did says a lot about
this team.''

2ND DEADLY APARTMENT BLAST HITS MOSCOW 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By MICHAEL WINES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ A predawn explosion leveled a large apartment building
in southern Moscow on Monday morning, killing at least 19 people.
It was the second blast to hit an apartment building in the city in
less than a week.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Security Service called the blast a terrorist act,
adding that it was clear that ``professionals'' were at work.
</P>
<P>
   The explosion occurred about 5 a.m. Moscow time (9 p.m. Sunday,
Eastern time) along a busy highway leading to downtown Moscow from
the south. The Interfax news service reported that the building had
been destroyed and that the explosion had thrown chunks of debris
as far as 350 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities rushed dozens of ambulances and fire trucks to the
scene, and the state-owned NTV television said that 11 dead had
been pulled from the debris by daylight.
</P>
<P>
   Only this weekend, the police rounded up 15 suspects in an
investigation into an explosion in an apartment building last
Wednesday in which 94 people were killed.
</P>
<P>
   They cited new evidence that terrorists, using the identity
papers of a dead man to conceal their own identities, moved
explosives into a ground-floor office of the nine-story building
before the explosion occurred.
</P>
<P>
   No one has claimed responsibility for either blast. But the
mayor of Moscow, Yuri M. Luzhkov, said over the weekend that he was
certain that the first explosion was the work of terrorists who
were retaliating for Russia's efforts to suppress an invasion of
Dagestan by Islamic rebels from neighboring Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am sure Chechnya is to blame,'' Luzhkov said on an NTV
program. ``It was a promised expansion of hostilities and terrorist
acts by Chechen warlords.''
</P>
<P>
   The explosion on Monday morning appeared to be the third major
act of terrorism in Russia in recent weeks. Two weeks ago, shortly
after Russian jets bombed the villages of an Islamic sect in
Dagestan, terrorists blew up an apartment housing Russian military
familes in the region, killing at least 64 people.

PATRIOTS SURPRISE JETS, PARCELLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Bruce Armstrong said he couldn't sleep
all week, so he reluctantly watched the preseason football shows
that either made no mention of the Patriots or trashed them.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got the Vikings or Tampa Bay in the Super Bowl, the
Jets winning the AFC East. You wonder whether you should even show
up for the season,'' said Armstrong. ``We didn't get any credit for
anything last season. Well, a funny thing happened on the way to
the coronation.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots beat the Jets Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   And the season-opening 30-28 nail-biter, which was decided on
Adam Vinatieri's 23-yard field goal with three seconds remaining,
came in the most hostile of conditions _ before 78,227 people,
nearly all of whom appeared to be dressed in green and shouting
``Jets, Jets, Jets!'' the entire game.
</P>
<P>
   To make it all the better for their fans, the Patriots, who face
the Indianapolis Colts next Sunday, beat Bill Parcells after losing
the last three meetings with their former coach. They took
advantage of Jets mistakes, didn't allow their own miscues to shoot
them in the foot, and were able to capitalize on a rash of Jets
injuries, none greater than the season-ending ruptured Achilles'
tendon suffered by quarterback Vinny Testaverde with 7:12 remaining
in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   And not one bit of the win came easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a remarkable effort by the Jets,'' said Patriots
coach Pete Carroll. ``They hung and hung and hung, and they made it
a really tough game for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots did not score any points for artistry, winning
because Drew Bledsoe completed 21 of 30 passes for 340 yards and
one touchdown and threw one interception; because Willie McGinest
had two sacks, scored a touchdown on a fumble recovery, and
pressured the quarterback all game; and because receivers Terry
Glenn (7 catches, 113 yards) and Tony Simmons (a 58-yard touchdown
reception early in the second quarter following a Lawyer Milloy
interception) made big plays.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe was brilliant until throwing an interception at the
worst possible moment _ when trying to hold a 27-22 fourth-quarter
lead. Linebacker Bryan Cox stepped in front of Troy Brown, the
intended receiver, and raced 27 yards unscathed for the go-ahead
score with 9:34 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was late with the throw,'' said Bledsoe. ``I needed to hit
it early to Terry, and really, I shouldn't have thrown it at all
and taken the sack. Fortunately our defense stiffened at the end
and we got another shot at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe didn't get it back right away. On the next series, the
11th of the game for the Patriots, Bledsoe was sacked by backup
nose tackle Jason Wiltz, who had spelled the injured Jason
Ferguson, for a 9-yard loss on third down.
</P>
<P>
   But on the Jets possession, Rick Mirer, who was 4 of 11 for 28
yards and two interceptions in relief of middle man Tom Tupa, threw
an ill-advised pass intended for Keyshawn Johnson (8 catches, 194
yards) into triple coverage. The ball tipped off Johnson's hands
and into the arms of Chris Slade, and the Patriots took over at the
Jets 49, giving Bledsoe his last chance.
</P>
<P>
   First he hit Glenn on a 12-yard sideline throw, then veteran
running back Terry Allen ran up the middle for 7 and 2 yards. On
third and 6, following a motion penalty, Bledsoe connected with
Troy Brown for 18 yards to the Jets 15. Allen, who was the
Patriots' leading rusher with 54 yards on 15 carries, converted on
third and 2 for a first down at the 3.
</P>
<P>
   After Allen lost a yard with a run to the left, the Jets called
their final timeout with 22 seconds left. Bledsoe then took a knee
at the 6, and Vinatieri booted the winning field goal.
</P>
<P>
   But with three seconds remaining, there was still the kickoff,
which had proved adventurous in the Patriots' final exhibition
game, when Carolina converted a squib kick on a similar play into a
last-second, 61-yard winning field goal. Vinatieri tried a squib
again and hit this one out of bounds, giving the Jets the ball at
their 40. Mirer tried a Hail Mary pass to Johnson, but Ty Law
batted it down.
</P>
<P>
   ``They played very well today,'' said Parcells of the Patriots.
``They took advantage of our mistakes. I pretty much anticipated it
would be a tough game like this. I expect those to continue.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots trailed, 16-10, at the half after Tupa's first pass
after replacing Testaverde was a 25-yard touchdown pass to Johnson
to make it 14-10. Testaverde ruptured the tendon as he took a step
toward a loose ball after Steve Israel stripped Curtis Martin.
</P>
<P>
   Big defensive plays by Slade and McGinest prevented further
scoring by Tupa, who on the next series hit a 50-yarder to Johnson,
putting the ball at the Patriots 33. But Tupa was forced to punt
after McGinest sacked him for a 7-yard loss, as the Patriots
continued to pressure their former teammate, who had seen no snaps
at quarterback in the exhibition season.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells went with Tupa because had put only one backup
quarterback, Tupa, on the active game roster, with Mirer designated
as the emergency quarterback. By NFL rules, if Mirer were inserted
before the fourth quarter, Tupa would have been ineligible.
</P>
<P>
   Right before the end of the half, with the Patriots in punt
formation at their 7, Mike Bartrum snapped the ball out of the end
zone to give the Jets a safety and a 16-10 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was completely my fault,'' said Bartrum. ``I messed up.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots' game plan after intermission was simple: Disrupt
Tupa and create turnovers. On the Jets' first possession, Israel
blitzed on first and 10 from the right corner, sacked Tupa, and
forced a fumble. After Brandon Mitchell, trying to scoop up the
loose ball, batted it toward the end zone, McGinest pounced on it
for the score. Vinatieri's extra-point gave New England a 17-16
lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots put another score up with 11:35 left in the third
quarter after Brown returned a punt 26 yards to the Jets 31. After
Bledsoe went to Glenn for 7 yards and Kevin Faulk ran for 2,
setting up third and 1 at the 22, Allen busted through an
impressive hole on the left side (Armstrong and Heath Irwin
throwing key blocks) for the score and a 24-16 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Vinatieri kicked the lead up to 27-16 when he booted a 21-yarder
with 6:06 left in the third quarter, the score set up by a
Bledsoe-to-Glenn 45-yard pass play.
</P>
<P>
   Just when it appeared the Patriots were headed toward a blowout,
``a funny thing happened on the way to the coronation.'' New
England couldn't run the ball well enough to comfortably ice the
win.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets took over at their 35 after a 27-yard kickoff return by
Aaron Glenn. On a slant pattern, Law and Chris Carter converged to
intercept Tupa's throw, but Johnson got the ball instead and raced
65 yards to the Patriots 5. Three plays later, Tupa and backup
tight end Fred Baxter combined for a 7-yard score. A 2-point
conversion attempt failed, leaving the score 27-22.
</P>
<P>
   Lacking a dependable ground attack, Bledsoe tossed to Ben Coates
for 17 yards and Shawn Jefferson for 19 to the Jets 46 before
Bledsoe was sacked by linebacker Roman Phifer and fumbled. The Jets
recovered at the Patriots 49.
</P>
<P>
   Mirer moved the ball well, getting a big interference call on
Law at the New England 35. On a third-down play from the 14, one
official again called interference on Law, but following a
conference it was ruled the pass was not catchable and the penalty
was waved off.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets lined up for a field goal, but Tupa took the ball and
ran toward the first-down marker. But Larry Whigham stopped him,
and the Patriots took over on downs at the 10.
</P>
<P>
   It was not the end of the afternoon's big plays.

BLEDSOE BACK TO LEAD WAY IN BIG-PLAY WAY 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Now it can be told. The man with the
great Stone Face was very scared. Every time he looked at his ugly
right index finger, he started thinking about his future. Would he
ever throw for 340 yards and make big play after big play for his
team again?
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure,'' admitted Drew Bledsoe, ``there were nights like that.
When I had to sit out those games last year, I definitely started
thinking about my football mortality.''
</P>
<P>
   That cloudy future is, well, somewhere off in the future. Back
in the here and now, Drew Bledsoe is still Drew Bledsoe. He can
still throw for 340. He can still air it out. He can still shove
the ball into infinitesimal openings and hit receivers a half-step
before they go out of bounds. He can still be the most important
man on the football field, which is exactly what he was as the
Patriots eked out a weird and wonderful 30-28 victory over the
suddenly mortal and mortified New York Jets at Giants Stadium
Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Who knows? Messing up his finger might have become some sort of
epiphany for the quarterback, who has never been one to wear his
heart on his sleeve or, frankly, anywhere on the outside at all.
And even Sunday he was dead-panning the win in Tuna Bowl V as only
he could, to wit: ``I don't know if you guys believe me when I say
it's simply a division win on the road. We won it. It's a good win
for us.''
</P>
<P>
   That's standard-issue Bledsoe rhetorical pabulum, but behind
closed doors he was in something of a fire-and-brimstone mode. The
New England Patriots occasionally get to see a different Drew
Bledsoe than the media and fans ever do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before the game,'' reports Terry Glenn, ``he was going around
saying, `We're gonna win this game!' And any time he does that, he
sends a message to this team. It lifts all our spirits. When Drew
Bledsoe does something like that, it gives us a boost.''
</P>
<P>
   As welcome as the Bledsoe rhetoric was, what mattered
exponentially more was his actual play. And it was evident from
what you call your basic get-go that Number 11 had gotten off the
bus in firm possession of his A-game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he was terrific,'' said an ebullient Pete Carroll.
``Right from the opening drive, he played a beautiful game. It's
too bad he had the one pick, but overall, it's what I've been
telling you: That's who he is.''
</P>
<P>
   He is 27 now, and this is Bledsoe's seventh NFL season. He is
entering what should be the most productive phase of his career.
For the next five or 10 or however many years, he has got the
requisite combination of raw talent and experience to make him a
superior NFL quarterback. The simple truth is that not very many
can do what Drew Bledsoe did here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how he did statistically,'' said veteran tackle
Bruce Armstrong. ``But he made big plays, and that's what he's got
to do all year. It's not as if he has to put the whole team on his
shoulders, but he has to make big plays. I think he'll be as good
as anybody in the league this year.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not quantum physics. The man is 6 feet 5 inches, 235
pounds, and he can zing the football. He can throw the killer
crossfield sideline pass and he can stretch the defense with a bomb
such as the 58-yarder to Tony Simmons that provided the Patriots
with their first touchdown of the '99 season. He'll make a mistake
now and again, such as the unfortunate interception on a pass
intended for Glenn in the fourth quarter, but who doesn't? And when
he does, he's man enough to take the blame.
</P>
<P>
   ``I threw it late,'' he confessed. ``I should have thrown it
early or not at all.''
</P>
<P>
   It could have cost his team the game. It didn't because Rick
Mirer, the third New York quarterback of the day, made a very bad
judgment that resulted in a vital Chris Slade interception with
3:30 remaining and the Jets leading, 28-27. Bledsoe took the team
from the Jets 49 to the Jets 1, and with three seconds left Adam
Vinatieri kicked the winning 23-yard field goal.
</P>
<P>
   His 21 completions went to nine different men. Not bad, huh?
``I've said all along that with all the weapons we have if I can
just play well _ I don't have to be great _ we can win games,''
Bledsoe declared. ``We've got four excellent (wide) receivers.
We've got Ben (Coates). We've got running backs who can catch. I
don't have any problems throwing to any of those guys in any
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Now with all due respect to the Coateses, Simmonses, and Shawn
Jeffersons of the world, not all receivers are created equal.
Nothing happened on the Giants Stadium turf Sunday to alter the
universally held opinion that if Drew Bledsoe is Mr. 1 on this
team, then Terry Glenn is Mr. 1A. Having Terry Glenn (seven catches
for 113 yards) back in the lineup means there are residual benefits
for everyone in a Patriots uniform. Bledsoe-to-Glenn is on the very
short list of most dangerous NFL passing duos. The trick, of
course, is to keep Mr. 1A in the lineup, but Mr. 1 has no control
over that.
</P>
<P>
   What we do know is that when Drew Bledsoe has some offensive
weapons he is one dangerous dude. We also know that he really is
passionate about the game, even if we must depend on an occasional
leaked locker room anecdote, as well as his own sparse testimony,
as proof.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned a lot last year when I was hurt,'' he confided. ``I
learned what the game meant to me. I was a lot more emotional about
this than I thought I would be.''
</P>
<P>
   So now Drew knows what the game means to him. Sunday's little
show reminded the rest of us what he means to the team. Pretty much
everything.

AGASSI CAPTURES US OPEN

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It's Agassi again.
</P>
<P>
   Andre Agassi, Comeback Kid II, did it once more in the US Open
Sunday by rallying to a 6-4, 6-7 (5-7), 6-7 (2-7), 6-3, 6-2
championship victory over a game and gutsy Todd Martin.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so at 29, Agassi is not exactly a kid. But what a comeback
artist.
</P>
<P>
   When Agassi won his first US Open in 1994, he was dressed all in
black, had long hair flowing out of the back of his black cap, and
was completing a comeback from a wrist injury and the depths of the
rankings.
</P>
<P>
   Agassi won this US Open with a shaved head and chest, capless,
and completing a tremendous comeback year as he recovered from
disinterest and the depth of the rankings.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what you play for,'' Agassi said. ``It does mean a lot
to win when it really matters most.''
</P>
<P>
   Agassi, who bashed his customary forehands and served
tremendously, collected $750,000 for his efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago Agassi got to the fourth round here but it was the
only major he played and a couple of months later he sunk to No.
141 in the rankings.
</P>
<P>
   Last year he rose dramatically in the rankings but did not do
well in the major tournaments. But he had a base for this year and
he focused on getting even more fit. And he focused on the majors.
</P>
<P>
   Missions accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   Agassi went out in the fourth round at the Australian, but has
been pretty much unstoppable since. He won the French Open, lost to
Pete Sampras in the finals at Wimbledon, and then came here.
</P>
<P>
   The French victory gave him a win in each of the Grand Slam
events and now he is starting on a second set of titles. This is
his second US Open, his fifth major overall.
</P>
<P>
   And he did it playing well, against an opponent playing well, in
front of a crowd of 23,053 that included five-time winner _ and now
retired _ Steffi Graf, who called the match ``incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   None of which takes away from what Martin, known more for guts
than glory as he quietly turned himself into one of the world's
best players, accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, also 29, did not seem bothered a bit by the hoopla or
the stage, Agassi said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like I was hanging by a thread for much of the match,''
Agassi said. ``He knows how to boil it down to tennis out there and
he was really executing in a way that was giving me all sorts of
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin missed more than half of 1997 with elbow problems, sunk
in the rankings as well, and will be No. 4 _ behind Agassi, Yevgeny
Kafelnikov, and Sampras _ when the rankings are released Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But it has been Agassi's year.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, eventually, it was his day.
</P>
<P>
   Agassi, the best returner in the game, was perfect on his serve.
Martin had eight break points and could not convert a single one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't remember any five-setter that I ever played that I
didn't lose my serve,'' Agassi said.
</P>
<P>
   In the fifth set, Martin managed only three points on Agassi's
four service games. It wasn't until the fourth set that Agassi
could do much with Martin's serve.
</P>
<P>
   Then in the fifth, Agassi broke Martin to jump in front early.
And broke again for the match. Agassi was simply marvelous in
putting Martin in a love-40 hole in the deciding game. Backhand
down the line. Backhand off the net and over. Great forehand off a
tough serve. Martin got it to 15-40, but would get no closer and
when his backhand went into the net, it was over.
</P>
<P>
   Championship clinched, Agassi raised high his arms. Saluted
coach Brad Gilbert and trainer Gil Reyes and the others in his
corner. And waved and bowed to each side of the Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Agassi's winners (45) far outnumbered his unforced errors (23).
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not easy with a guy that hits the ball as well as him
on a fast court,'' Agassi said.
</P>
<P>
   Martin had 77 winners and 60 errors.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than anything else, it was the relentless pressure he put
on me,'' Martin said. ``Not just with his serve, not just with his
feet, not just with his returns, but every game he seemed to be
there.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the first five-setter in an Open final since Mats
Wilander outlasted Ivan Lendl in 1988 and only the second since
1980.
</P>
<P>
   The play was efficient, if not overly inspiring through nearly
two sets. Agassi broke Martin in the first game of the match and
survived a couple of break points in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Near the end of the second, the pace picked up. At 4-4, Martin
escaped two break points. Next game, Martin had his two break
points of the set, but could convert neither and they headed to the
tiebreaker.
</P>
<P>
   Agassi went up, 3-1, but Martin rallied to win it with a volley.
</P>
<P>
   Third set, same as the second. And back to a 'breaker. Agassi
double faulted to open it and never recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Agassi began to take command early in the third set, breaking
for 2-1. He wriggled free of a couple of break points in the eighth
game, then broke Martin again in the ninth. And Agassi broke again
early in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Before long, he had his championship. He has his eye on more.
``I definitely feel I have more titles in me,'' Agassi said.
</P>
<P>
   It might be tough to find anyone who disagrees with him today.

GILL GETS TWO-YEAR CONTRACT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ One week into the holdout life, defenseman Hal Gill
came to contract terms with the Bruins Sunday and is expected on
the ice Monday afternoon when workouts resume in Wilmington.
</P>
<P>
   Gill signed a two-year deal believed to be worth an average of
$750,000 per season _ a significant increase over the $410,000 he
made in 1998-99.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel pretty good about it,'' said Gill, speaking by phone
from his Lynnfield home Sunday &UR;  &LR; night. ``I'm ready to get going,
get started, and start doing what I do out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, two key Bruins, one in California and one in Sweden,
remain without contracts for the fast-approaching 1999-2000 season.
It doesn't sound as if Gill's deal portends anything in the near
future for either Byron Dafoe or P.J. Axelsson.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's great for Hal,'' said Boston netminder Dafoe, reached
at his home Sunday &UR;  &LR; night in Manhattan Beach, Calif., where he
continues his holdout vigil. ``That's one piece of the puzzle
solved.''
</P>
<P>
   Dafoe is looking for a three-year deal worth approximately $12
million, about a million dollars per year more than the Bruins have
offered. Axelsson, still home in Sweden, recently began talking
about a two-year deal to return to Boston, but his agent, Neil
Abbott, said Sunday &UR;  &LR; night that he was not optimistic about
completing a deal in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I don't think it's going to get done,'' said Abbott, who
says Axelsson has multiple offers to play this season in Sweden and
possibly another offer to play in Switzerland. ``Clearly, they
think Hal is a more valuable member of the team than my guy. They
think (Axelsson) is a replaceable part. There's a clear difference
as to where we think P.J. ranks in the hierarchy of the team, from
a salary standpoint.''
</P>
<P>
   The 24-year-old Gill initially sought a three-year contract, but
negotiations progressed slowly through the summer. Late last week,
the Bruins and Gill's agent, Mark Witkin, began negotiating a
two-year deal which would include the 2000-2001 season, which would
be the first year that the former Providence Friar would be
eligible for arbitration. When the length of term got narrowed, the
deal got done.
</P>
<P>
   The second year of Gill's deal is likely worth slightly more
than $800,000. Two years from now, he'll be 26, and his qualifying
offer would have to be at least $900,000. Given his impressive
development his first two years in the league, he'll likely land a
multimillion dollar deal with his next pact. Nice work for the
207th pick in the '93 draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to talk about figures,'' said Witkin, asked to
confirm the $1.4 million salary. ``I think there's too much
emphasis on it. Overall, I'd say (Gill) is pretty happy about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Dafoe's agent, Ron Salcer, and Abbott are expected to continue
talks Monday with Boston bosses Harry Sinden and Mike O'Connell.
O'Connell said Saturday that the club offered added incentives to
Dafoe, but the goalie said Sunday the sweetening of the pot wasn't
enough to entice him to sign.
</P>
<P>
   ``The incentive they offered was based on winning the Stanley
Cup _ an all-or-nothing kind of thing,'' said Dafoe. ``The
incentives they've offered are fine _ it's just the base we're
worried about.''
</P>
<P>
   Dafoe, who opted not to go to arbitration earlier this summer,
said he is willing to talk about a new deal of one, two, three, or
four years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if it's one year, that's fine with me,'' said Dafoe.
``I've worked with short contracts all my career, had to go out
there each year and prove myself. If that's what it takes this
time, no problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Sinden, the club's president and general manager, quibbled last
week with Salcer's attempt to use New Jersey goalie Martin Brodeur,
who will make $3.75 million this season, as the netminder most
comparable to Dafoe. Sinden argued that Dafoe has not won a Stanley
Cup, a feat accomplished by Brodeur in the spring of '95.
</P>
<P>
   According to Dafoe, the Bruins on Friday forwarded Salcer their
list of comparables, names that included the likes of Tommy Salo,
Jocelyn Thibault, Damian Rhodes, and Ron Tugnutt, among others.
</P>
<P>
   ``And they're all great goaltenders; I'm not knocking any of
them,'' said Dafoe. ``But their numbers don't compare to mine the
last two years. Ron (Salcer) took the statistics for the top 12
goalies in the league and looked at their numbers in about eight
categories _ things like save percentage, goals-against average,
wins, all the key numbers _ and when you blend them all together
for the last two years, I came out second overall _ that's second
to you-know-who (Dominik Hasek). I'm looking for money that ranks
down around 10th in the league, and I think that's reasonable.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins will work out the next three days in Wilmington
before heading to Portland, Maine, to face the Canadiens in their
second preseason game. They then head to Florida for a pair of
games vs. the Panthers . . . Ray Bourque should get his first
preseason action vs. the Habs, but it's unlikely he'll play against
Florida.

SWEEP DREAMS COME TRUE IN N.Y. 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<P>
   NEW YORK _ We are New Englanders. New York is all things rude,
evil, powerful, and loud. It takes our best, laughs, and never
looks back. It dismisses us. That's what's so infuriating. We hate
New York, but Gotham doesn't give us much thought at all.
</P>
<P>
   And this is why Sunday was one of the greatest days in the
history of New England. On a splendid Sunday in New York, the
oft-mocked Boston Red Sox beat Roger Clemens, 4-1, in front of
56,028 to complete a three-game sweep at Yankee Stadium. Less than
10 miles away, in Northern New Jersey, the maligned Patriots upset
Bully Bill Parcells and the New York Jets, 30-28, in their NFL
season opener.
</P>
<P>
   It simply doesn't get any better. If you are a New Englander
working in a brokerage house or law firm, or studying in a college
dorm, you are sick of obnoxious New Yorkers rubbing it in your
face. They took Babe Ruth, the 1949 pennant, the Tuna, Leonard
Bernstein, Curtis Martin, Clemens, Jordan Marsh, the 1978 pennant,
the Boston Globe, and two thirds of Nantucket. They forever ruined
clam chowder, polluting it with tomatoes, then had the gall to call
it Manhattan clam chowder.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday we fought back, if only for a day.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox' sweep was their first in New York since 1986, when
young Clemens went 24-4 and took the Sox to the seventh game of the
World Series. The Yankees have won 24 world championships to
Boston's zero since Sox owner Harry Frazee sold Ruth to New York
some 80 years ago. The Sox have earned a reputation as the team
that always chokes.
</P>
<P>
   Look who's gagging now. The defending world champion Yankees,
winners of a record 125 games last year, led the Red Sox in the
American League East standings by 8 1/2 games on Aug. 30, but the
Sox have cut that margin to 3 1/2 with 19 games
</P>
<P>
   to play. Boston this year went 8-4 against the so-called
``greatest team ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Beating Clemens made it that much sweeter. He always told us he
hated New York. Couldn't stand the place. Then he got himself
traded to the Yankees and started talking as if he had Mickey
Mantle's poster on his wall when he was a child in Dayton, Ohio.
Boston fans didn't like Clemens as a Blue Jay, but seeing him in
pinstripes was intolerable. Sunday marked the first time the Sox
beat Clemens in seven tries against the onetime Boston ace.
</P>
<P>
   The Rocket, who was loudly booed when introduced at Fenway
during All-Star Game festivities in July, again claimed there was
nothing special about pitching against Boston, but we know he's
lying. He pitched 12 years for the Red Sox, which would make it
impossible for him not to know what this weekend meant. He is no
stranger to the Curse of the Bambino and used to wipe his sweat on
the Babe's center-field monument at the Stadium in an effort to
turn the bad karma back in favor of Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Are the 1999 Yankees panicking?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that nobody's sitting back or waiting or any
kind of panic at all,'' said Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   Yankees manager Joe Torre, suddenly confronted with questions we
used to put to Don Zimmer, Darrell Johnson, John McNamara, and Joe
Morgan, assumed the same position. ``Nobody's gonna quit or get
scared or anything like that,'' said Torre. ``If we get beaten,
it's just because we get beaten. Go over and ask Jimy (Williams,
the Sox manager). I'll still take this seat. We've got a four-game
bulge in the loss column. I'm sure Jimy would take it, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, with his good-luck Baby Ruth candy bar still on his
desk, downplayed the obvious and said, ``It's good to sweep
anytime. We're just playing that schedule. We know they're the
champs.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, beating Parcells goes down as one of the greatest
moments in the history of the Patriots franchise. The Tuna led New
England to the Super Bowl in 1996, then inherited a 1-15 Jets team
and immediately made it better than the Patriots team he left
behind. In Foxborough, Mass., Patriots management became obsessed
with all things Parcells, dismantling what he built and even firing
a secretary who made a couple of phone calls to the Tuna. New
England's victory in the Meadowlands will go a long way toward
putting the Ghost of Parcells to rest. And just try wiping the
smile off the face of Patriots owner Bob Kraft today.
</P>
<P>
   There is no way to underestimate what the victory means to the
Patriots. It is temporary vindication for Kraft, general manager
Bobby Grier, and all the Patriot players who were in New England
under Parcells. Most of all, it saves coach Pete Carroll from more
of the darts and abject ridicule that have marked his two-plus-year
tenure as unfortunate successor to the Tuna. At least for a while,
Pete gets to tell his critics to shut up.
</P>
<P>
   Happy day. Boston has been Mudville for too long. Today we are
Pleasantville and woe is the New Yorker who crosses our path.

NFL CAN'T MUSTER PASSERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Today's bumbling, rumbling, stumbling edition of The Sporting
Muse:
</P>
<P>
   The most important position in football is quarterback. And
there is mounting evidence that the second-most important position
is backup quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   On opening day of the NFL, also known as the official start of
hunting season among defenses coast-to-coast, the postgame accent
again was on casualties and a lack of depth over center. In the
time it took Vinny Testaverde to scream, the New York Jets went
from Super Bowl contender to a team staring 15 games in the face
with Rick Mirer or Tom Tupa over center. Bill Parcells had better
be a genius.
</P>
<P>
   It took Atlanta's Chris Chandler only three quarters to retire
with an injury, Cincinnati's Jeff Blake left his game with cramps,
and Green Bay's Brett Favre and Arizona's Jake Plummer played on
courageously despite injuries to their throwing hands.
</P>
<P>
   No one wants to see the league put a skirt on quarterbacks and
render them untouchable. Testaverde's ruptured Achilles had more to
do with age and artificial turf than the Patriots. But with
sophisticated defensive packages and bigger players, the game has
evolved to the point where quarterbacks are an endangered species.
With the exception of demigods named Aikman, Favre and Marino,
quarterbacks are either physically or mentally lame.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure who had a worse day Sunday, Parcells or those
coaches stuck with the following:
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia, where Doug Pederson went 12 for 26 for 91 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City, where Elvis Grbac threw eight straight
incompletions with the game on the line against Chicago, and where
Warren Moon, who turns 43 in November, is the backup. Baltimore,
where Scott Mitchell was 17 for 40 with two picks and 188 yards
against the Rams, and where another failure, Tony Banks, is the
backup.
</P>
<P>
   Carolina, where Steve Beuerlein, Steve Bono and Jeff Lewis are
poised to make George Seifert regret his decision to unretire.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta, which is testing fate with Danny Kanell and Tony
Graziani as Chandler's backup.
</P>
<P>
   New York, where Giants coach Jim Fassel watched Kent Graham go
12 for 23 for 91 yards, and where Ryan Leaf mentor's, Kerry
Collins, is the backup.
</P>
<P>
   Or Tampa Bay, which saw the Giants (107 net yards) turn two of
five Trent Dilfer mistakes (four picks, one fumble) into defensive
touchdowns and force Tony Dungy to yank Dilfer for Eric Zeier.
</P>
<P>
   I'm willing to predict that the next quarterback injury will be
to Dilfer, and it will happen Tuesday when he is the victim of
friendly fire during practice. ...
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the smartest teams in the league are the few who chose
to secure a reserve quarterback with some credentials, and those
who spent a first-round draft pick on a quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo (Rob Johnson), San Diego (Erik Kramer), Denver (Bubby
Brister), Pittsburgh (Mike Tomczak) and Minnesota (human retrovirus
Jeff George) all armed themselves deeper than other teams in case
of emergency. I'm willing to bet that Buffalo and Minnesota will
get offers for Johnson and George by the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   The Cade McNowns, Tim Couchs and Donovan McNabbs may be
inexperienced, but that works to their advantage. We already know
Mitchell, Graham and Dilfer suck. ...
</P>
<P>
   McNabb, Pederson's backup in Philadelphia, and the Browns' Couch
are likely to start by October, if not sooner. McNown played Sunday
for the Bears behind Shane Matthews. Akili Smith (Cincinnati) could
be on the sidelines if Jeff Blake plays back to 1997. Daunte
Culpepper (Minnesota) gives the Vikings the chance to entertain
offers for George. ...
</P>
<P>
   One of the subtle shifts in the NFL has to do with the
quick-strike ability of defenses. There were 10 defensive
touchdowns and a pair of safetys Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   When you think about it, defenses now employ more skill players
on the field these days than offenses. Offenses employ five huge
linemen and a pair of blockers at tight end and fullback. Depending
on the scheme, defenses can have as many as nine great athletes on
the field at any time. ...
</P>
<P>
   Official 1999 coaching hot seat rankings: 1, Bruce Coslet,
Cincinnati; 2, Norv Turner, Washington. 3, Gunther Cunningham,
Kansas City. Those excused this week: Bobby Ross, Detroit; Pete
Carroll, New England. ...
</P>
<P>
   It would be disingenuous to say I believed the Lions would beat
the Seahawks Sunday. But Bobby Ross got the Chargers to a Super
Bowl, and this isn't a running back league any more. ...
</P>
<P>
   Based on their first effort, it's 50-50 whether the new
Cleveland Browns score an offensive touchdown by Halloween. You'd
think $530 million would buy more.

 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
Sammy Sosa was the main drawing card in a weekend series that
attracted more than 150,000 fans to the Astrodome. But in the end
he was a mere bit player in the unfolding drama that is the Astros'
quest for a third consecutive division title.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Astros upstaged Sosa once again, defeating the Chicago Cubs
7-1 Sunday to extend their winning streak to a
franchise-record-tying 10 games.
</P>
<P>
   Under most circumstances, that would have been enough to take
the mystery out of the National League Central race. But the
second-place Cincinnati Reds refuse to go away. The Reds have won
nine of their last 10, including Sunday's victory over Florida that
kept them three games behind the Astros.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been very special because of what the Reds are
doing,'' Astros manager Larry Dierker said of his team's winning
streak. ``It's almost like we're going to have to win every game to
win the division.''
</P>
<P>
   While it's highly unlikely that will happen, you would never
know by watching the Astros over the last 10 days. Of course, the
competition hasn't exactly been the best the NL has to offer, but
the Astros have done exactly what they're supposed to do against
the likes of Montreal, Philadelphia and Chicago, which became the
Astros' 11th sweep victim of the season and their third in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Holt's resilient pitching and a balanced offensive attack
led by Cubs-killer Carl Everett made it an easy victory for the
Astros. Holt overcame a shaky start and worked out of a couple of
jams to notch his first victory since Aug. 14 and only his fourth
of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Holt (4-13) allowed a run on four hits in six innings, and
relievers Jose Cabrera, Jay Powell and Doug Henry combined for
three shutout innings. The Astros have held their opponents to 2.7
runs per game during the winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank God for our pitching staff,'' Astros second baseman
Craig Biggio said. ``They've been the story of our season. If it
weren't for them, I don't know where we'd be.''
</P>
<P>
   The same could be said for Everett, who has been an absolute
terror to opposing pitchers, particularly those who receive their
paychecks from the Cubs. Everett was 4-for-4 with an RBI and three
runs Sunday, and he hit .522 with six homers and 20 RBIs against
the Cubs this season.
</P>
<P>
   Since being activated from the disabled list Aug. 6 at Chicago,
Everett has hit safely in 18 of 20 games, compiling a .432 batting
average with 10 homers and 29 RBIs. What makes those numbers even
more impressive is the fact Everett recently missed 11 games
because of another injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carl is hitting everything right now,'' Dierker said. ``It's
almost impossible to defend him, because he's hitting the ball in
every direction. He's really hot right now.''
</P>
<P>
   As well as the Astros are playing, most of them believe their
best is yet to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we continue to play like this, who knows what might
happen?'' said Everett, who tied a career high for hits in a game.
``I don't think we've played our best baseball yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Holt certainly didn't appear to be at his best after he walked
the first two batters of the game, prompting a visit to the mound
from pitching coach Vern Ruhle. Holt stranded both runners, coaxing
an infield popout from Sosa and striking out Mark Grace and Henry
Rodriguez. Holt finished with seven strikeouts, one shy of his
career high.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was overthrowing a little bit in the beginning,'' Astros
catcher Tony Eusebio said. ``But after he settled down, he was
hitting his spots.''
</P>
<P>
   Holt retired 10 consecutive batters after the two first-inning
walks, and by the time he finally allowed a run, the Astros already
had given him a two-run lead on Everett's RBI single in the first
and Biggio's third-inning solo homer _ the 150th of his career.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs scored their only run in the fourth inning on Jeff
Reed's sacrifice fly, which scored Grace. Eusebio drove home a run
with a ground ball in the fourth, and Daryle Ward's sixth-inning
sacrifice fly gave the Astros a three-run lead. Eusebio, Ken
Caminiti and Russ Johnson each drove in a run in the Astros'
three-run eighth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Caminiti had three hits in the game, and Bill Spiers added two
as six Astros combined for 12 hits.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa was 2-for-4 Sunday, but he had only three hits (none a
homer) in 14 at-bats during the three-game series. It marked the
first time Sosa, who leads the majors with 59 round-trippers, went
homerless in a series since Aug. 6-8 when the Astros visited
Wrigley Field, a span of 10 series.

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was supposed to be a wonderful US Open, the last
of the so-called American century, but nowhere was the name of an
American, Todd Martin, mentioned as somebody who would rescue the
men's proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Martin? Good fellow, relentless tryer, top 10 resident off
and on, kind to people and dogs. However, Martin was maybe the last
good player you'd expect to find unpacking his bags at Flushing
Meadow Sunday and suiting up to save the title bout from one-sided
oblivion. Nevertheless, it was this self-effacing Ichabod Crane in
knee-pants who made the tournament that Andre Agassi inevitably
won.
</P>
<P>
   Andre became the `99-er, the game's man of the year, adding a
second major to his French conquest, yet the odyssey of
over-achiever Martin through a fortnight of viruses, IV drips,
escapes, and bone-weariness earned at least an asterisk in the
honor-roll book.
</P>
<P>
   1999 _ lost final but won hearts.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, yes, there was also a male go-round at the Meadow. Nobody to
upstage Serena, of course, but the guys were hanging out. Sort of.
And there were people who believed it wasn't wrong to deal them
equal prize money. Guys gotta eat, too.
</P>
<P>
   But when the top half of the draw immediately started to look
like the earthquake scenes in ``San Francisco'' when champs Sampras
and Rafter crumbled and others of name value like Kuerten and
Ivanisevic vanished in the rubble, you wondered if anybody would
remain to contest any kind of a final with Agassi.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there was Martin as the lone ranger. Swaddled in all
sorts of bandages and braces and resembling a refugee from the set
of ``The Mummy's Curse,'' he may have been nowhere in the pundits'
reckonings, but he was surviving. Going grayer with every match,
looking older than springtime _ sometimes more like 92 than 29 _ a
self-declared ``late bloomer,'' he was to bloom latest and best at
the end of the line: the final.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had me hanging on by a thread,'' whewed Agassi, who pulled
himself together and into focus in time to triumph, 6-4, 6-7 (5-7),
6-7 (2-7), 6-3, 6-2. For 3 hours and 23 minutes, Martin roughed-up,
hassled, and much of the time outhit the peerless shotmaker with 23
aces, backhand blasts, and twinkle-toe volleys.
</P>
<P>
   Todd made Agassi prove his greatness, and in doing so he wowed
23,053 witnesses surrounding him. It was neck-and-neck all the way,
although Andre's relentless counter-punching began to cut Martin's
legs out from under him and erode the big guy's serve.
</P>
<P>
   At 6-feet-6, Martin was the loftiest individual to grace a US
final, and it's been clear that a huge percentage of that frame is
heart. He feared three years ago that his career was ending,
discourtesy of a gimpy right elbow, but surgery and a long spell of
rehab pulled him through.
</P>
<P>
   The game was a beneficiary, too, because Martin is a guy who
appreciates ``being in the arena,'' win or lose. He started out
barely eluding a no-name qualifier, Stephane Huet, in a fifth set
tie-breaker, and didn't think he was long for this Open.
</P>
<P>
   Todd caught a break in the third round when the dangerous Swede,
Magnus Larsson, quit with a wobbly knee, and realized ``euphoria''
in the fourth by improbably overtaking 1997 finalist Greg Rusedski
in a post-midnight resurgence. He wouldn't let Greg loose even
though the Brit led by two sets, served for victory at 5-4 in the
third, and led again in the fifth, 4-1.
</P>
<P>
   Dividing his time between medical treatment and the court, ``and
a little sleep,'' Martin saved the Open from a final-round occupant
named Slava Dosedel or Cedric Pioline. Fine fellows _ but 1999 US
Open finalists? Spare us, please _ and Martin did.
</P>
<P>
   He did it with style and moxie, understatement, good humor, and
crushing shots that flattened six foes and put some tremble into
Andre. When Martin looked at his end of town and saw it in ruins,
and that Pete Sampras and Patrick Rafter had disappeared, did he
decide to be a good citizen and do what he could as a one-man
salvage crew?
</P>
<P>
   ``They're great players. I never think about being great. I
figure I just have to be better than the guy across the net.'' He
was, six-and-two-fifths times. He took it to the limit and brought
the last major of the century to a splendid crescendo.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Martin probably won't win a major. This was as close as
he'll get. But give him that major asterisk. 1999 _ lost final, won
hearts, rescued men's tournament.

 By DALE ROBERTSON  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
NEW YORK _ Call him Andre the giant. Andre the gallant, too.
<TEXT>
<P>
   And, yes, Andre the gutsy. The Andre Agassi who once drew
criticism for failing to play to the best of his ability, for
spending more time selling products than selling out on the tennis
court, is but a distant memory.
</P>
<P>
   Pushing 30, having returned to the top of the tennis rankings
after free-falling well into triple digits just 24 months earlier,
Agassi completed the best year of his wildly careening career
Sunday with a 6-4, 6-7 (7-5), 6-7 (7-2), 6-3, 6-2 comeback victory
over Todd Martin for his second U.S. Open championship.
</P>
<P>
   No U.S. Open titlist had rallied from a two-sets-to-one deficit
since John Newcombe defeated Jan Kodes at Forest Hills in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   But kudos to Martin, too. In this, just his second major final,
he didn't choke, as he has been wont to do. Rather, Agassi choked
him with a brilliant one-two punch of power and finesse on the
serving and receiving end, beginning with the final game of the
fourth set.
</P>
<P>
   They played for almost 3{ hours, which took more of a toll on
Martin's weary body than on Agassi's. The runner-up was hit by a
stomach virus early last week and then had to dig himself out of a
two-set hole in the fourth round Tuesday night against Greg
Rusedski.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a shame somebody had to lose,'' said Agassi, who was
seeded second. ``I was hanging by a thread for the longest time. It
was exciting tennis. It really speaks a lot for his spirit because
he knows how to boil it down to tennis out there. Todd was really
executing in a way that was giving me all sorts of problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was serving so well. I think the statistics really reflect
what a great match it was. I only had 22 unforced errors. Through
the course of a five-set match, that's not easy with a guy who hits
the ball as well as him on a fast court. I was very worried. He
gave me a lot to worry about.''
</P>
<P>
   Agassi broke his fellow American's serve, a weapon strong enough
for Martin to have belted 22 aces up to that juncture, three times
in the last five games to secure the fifth major title of his
career and his second of the summer.
</P>
<P>
   At the French Open, Agassi, had rallied from a two-set deficit
to beat Andrei Medvedev, a victory that made him only the fifth
player to complete a career Grand Slam.
</P>
<P>
   Agassi also reached the Wimbledon final, where Pete Sampras beat
him in straight sets.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras, trying to become the first man to win 13 Slam titles,
had pulled out of the U.S. Open the day it began, having injured
his back practicing.
</P>
<P>
   Twice-defending champion Patrick Rafter retired from his
first-round match with a shoulder injury. Sampras and Rafter were
slotted in Martin's half of the draw. But he seized the opportunity
and came within a set of the title.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't be disappointed with what happened today, or over the
last two weeks,'' the seventh-seeded Martin said. ``I feel very
good about the way I played.''
</P>
<P>
   And so for the fourth time in the 1990s _ but for the first time
since '95 _ U.S. men won three of the four Slam stops. Agassi last
prevailed here in 1994, beating Michael Stich.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras then defeated him 12 months later, a loss he admits
plunged him into a competitive free fall it took him almost three
years to escape. To get his game back, he was reduced to entering a
couple of Challenger Series events.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to make a choice if I was going to really play the game
or quit,'' he said. ``If I was going to play, I had to do a lot of
work.''
</P>
<P>
   Agassi had sent a U.S. Open final to a fifth set for the first
time in 11 years _ Mats Wilander beat Ivan Lendl in five in 1988 _
by breaking Martin twice in the fourth while saving two break
points himself in the eighth game, the last time he would be on the
brink of losing his serve.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, 29, was 0-for-8 on break opportunities up to then but
had stayed a leg up in the match by managing the tiebreakers better
than the world's new No. 1, a ranking Agassi locked up with his
semifinal win over Australian Open champ Yevgeny Kafelnikov.
</P>
<P>
   He took the first one 7-5, winning three of Agassi's six service
points, and the second 7-2, taking five of six.
</P>
<P>
   The quality of Martin's tennis until the last set _ the shortest
of the afternoon at 28 minutes _ was unquestionably the highest of
a career that had seen him advance to only one previous Grand Slam
final, a loss to Sampras in Australia in 1994. His ranking is
fourth, a personal best.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I did have my opportunities on Andre's second serve,''
Martin said, ``I probably didn't do enough with them. I was up
love-30 countless times. I missed a lot of chances, although that
was due to the way he played as much as anything. But I did not
expect to go five sets without breaking his serve.''
</P>
<P>
   After he incurred a break in the opening game, the 6-6 Martin's
crushing serve routinely bedeviled Agassi, the game's best
returner. He was effective in pulling Agassi off the court by
kicking the ball wide to the forehand. But as he has done all
summer against everyone except Sampras, who gave him three of his
four defeats in 39 matches beginning with the French Open run,
Agassi found an answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really had to make every point incredibly important,''
Agassi said. ``It was crucial that I took care of my own service
games because I knew I would not get many chances (to break him).''
</P>
<P>
   In the fifth set, he left no doubt his No. 1 ranking _ 140
notches above where it had fallen in 1997 _ is in deserving hands.
He lost just three points on his serve and was so energized, he
sprinted to the chair for the final two changeovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important in a five-set match if you feel strong,'' he
said, ``to let your opponent know you feel that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Agassi won two of his fifth-set service games at love and broke
at love in the second game. He then broke for the championship at
15-40, when Martin netted a backhand off a blistering, deep Agassi
backhand.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's incredible,'' Agassi said. ``It's been a long road back
for me, one I'm quite proud of.''
</P>
<P>
   What if somebody had told him, in mid-1997, that he would be
where he is today, all by his lonesome on top of his sport again?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd tell them to stop smoking that crack pipe,'' he said.

PATRIOTS TUNED OUT THE TUNA 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Drew Bledsoe and Ty Law believe they
understand what happened to their team Sunday at the Meadowlands.
It won a game to be sure, but maybe, just maybe, it did something
more important.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, this time, it also grew up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't pretty; in fact, it was pretty damn ugly,'' Law said
after his team had rallied to catch the scrappy New York Jets at
the buzzer, 30-28, winning the season opener on the road with three
seconds on the clock and their season on the line as early as it
possibly could be.
</P>
<P>
   It had been an up-and-down afternoon when it should have been
something far smoother. It had been a day when the Jets lost their
starting quarterback for the season and two other starters for a
while and still held the Patriots off with a stoic defense and a
punter under center.
</P>
<P>
   It had been a day when Law's Patriots did many good things but a
few things so exceedingly poor that, in another lifetime, they
would have surely cracked under the weight of their own series of
faux pas and let this opportunity slip away after the Jets
intercepted a Bledsoe pass and ran it in for a touchdown to take a
28-27 lead midway through the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   By then the game should have been long over. It should have been
a game no longer. But it was and the Patriots were not discouraged
by it. They were displeased but not discouraged, which was as it
should be.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a roller-coaster ride for us but it was a good ride,''
Law said. ``It was the best ride we could have had. It was good for
our team because it boosts our confidence. It showed us we can play
when it's tight. We can win as a team, not with just a few
individuals making plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't play our best. We know that. If we had gotten them
off the field when we should, we would have won easily but out of
all the crap that went on they could have blown us out of the
water. But we wouldn't let them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jets were without not only Vinny Testaverde but also nose
tackle Jason Ferguson, kick returner Leon Johnson, and, for a time,
tight end Eric Green as green-and-white clad men fell to the ground
one after another. They had Tom Tupa, their punter, at quarterback,
and he rallied them when all appeared lost by throwing two unlikely
touchdown passes, the latter of which helped reduce an 11-point
Patriot lead to dust in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Yet still the Patriots hung on until they finally hung one on a
team that had haunted them for two years. Haunted them until
Saturday night, when Bledsoe had a notion the Jets would haunt them
no longer even if they did beat them from time to time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew we were going to win this game on Saturday,'' Bledsoe
said after he had recovered from Bryan Cox's 27-yard interception
return for a fourth-quarter touchdown by marching his team 44 yards
in 10 plays to set up Adam Vinatieri's winning, 23-yard field goal
with three seconds to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could feel the difference in us last night. You could
sense it was just a football game again and we were ready to win
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The difference this time was that the game was not between the
Patriots and The Ghost of Christmas Past. It was not between the
Patriots and Bill Parcells. This time it was just a football game,
not an exorcism, although the way it ended may have allowed it to
function in both capacities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely over,'' safety Lawyer Milloy said of the
feared Curse of the Tuna. ``We'll treat them like the next opponent
from now on. It will be a rivalry but it was a different feeling
this time. I'm not saying we'll dominate them. We're rivals so
every game will be tough and the best team on that day will win,
but we'll be fundamentally sound now.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't running around all hyped up, like we did last year.
We understand now that they use that to their advantage. Today our
coaches did a good job of getting us into base defenses if we
weren't ready to make adjustments, and we played from there.''
</P>
<P>
   They played hard from there all afternoon, spectacularly at
times and disastrously at others but never once did they lose their
poise. Never once did they waver. Never once did they let the Jets
destroy them where it counts _ in their heads.
</P>
<P>
   ``We beat one of the teams that people were giving the respect
to on the road, the respect we once had,'' Milloy said. ``When
things went bad, we stayed calm. We remained focused on one thing _
winning the game. It was a sticky situation for us for a while, but
we stayed together and we won. Now we move on to Indianapolis.''
</P>
<P>
   Moving on after success has not been easy for this Patriot team
of late. Two years in a row they have followed 4-1 starts with 1-4
collapses. That has made for roller-coaster years that were akin to
Sunday's roller-coaster game, except this time, with the exception
of nitwit linebacker coach Bo Pelini cursing out members of the
local media after the game as if they had been found trying to put
a mojo on his team, they not only said the right things, they
seemed to mean them this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a damn good team we beat, but it's just one game,''
said Willie McGinest on a day in which he had two sacks, forced a
fumble, and recovered another for a touchdown. ``That's all it is.
One game. We're not playing this season for the Jets. We're playing
for the division.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always weird here. The coaches told us to be prepared for
three or four things that would be very unusual. It happened, but
you've just got to keep going and tune things out. We did that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we have to stay focused and stay humble. You don't win the
season on one game.''
</P>
<P>
   No, you don't. But knowing that is the case may have been the
Patriots' biggest victory of all Sunday.

NEW YORK _ Well, hooray. The American century ends with a blooming
American tennis renaissance, with as glorious a summer as the Old
Glory brigade has enjoyed in a generation.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The last two majors of the 1900s produced a clean sweep by the
Yanks, who took the men's and women's championships at Wimbledon,
then repeated the feat at the U.S. Open. This after Sunday's king
of Queens, Andre Agassi, had claimed the French Open title, too.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a distinction to be made. On the women's side, a
new era beckons. The sisters Williams have announced themselves
worthy heiresses to the legacy of Helen Wills Moody, Billie Jean
King and Chris Evert, the greatest of our home-grown heroines.
Serena, 17, opened the door here. Venus, still a teen-ager herself,
will follow her through it next year.
</P>
<P>
   After Saturday, the deluge. They conspired to win the doubles
Sunday, just to make sure we were paying attention.
</P>
<P>
   Only their dual presence likely will prevent one or the other
from breaking all the records, but together they're certain to
collect more Grand Slam titles than any family in history, unless
the sheer boredom of terrorizing the Women's Tennis Association _
soon to stand for Williams Tennis Association _ Tour short-circuits
their careers ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
   A not-very-bold prediction: Between them, Venus and Serena will
surpass Margaret Court's record of 24 Slams won.
</P>
<P>
   Inside of 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   As for the U.S. men, though, the smashing year they're having
smacks more of a last gasp than a second wind, at least at first
glance. Agassi and Todd Martin, Sunday's game runner-up, are
crowding 30; Pete Sampras isn't far behind them. Jim Courier, the
only other U.S. player ranked in the top 50, is right there as
well.
</P>
<P>
   Five years from now, they figure to be off playing golf and
preparing to steal a bunch more money on the senior circuit.
</P>
<P>
   And, no, there are no heirs apparent popping off the current
ranking charts or the junior draw sheets. Jan-Michael Gambill and
Justin Gimelstob aren't on the cusp of accepting the baton.
Regarding the latter group, Mardy Fish is the U.S.'s closest thing
to a big kahuna _ and he's just 10th on the junior computer. At the
Open, Fish was the only U.S. lad to advance as far as the
quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the next Pete (12 majors won) or Andre (five
after Sunday) is not even a faint blip on the radar screen.
</P>
<P>
   But, short term, everything is fine. Couldn't be finer,
actually.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras' pursuit of Slam history _ one more victory and he holds
the all-time record by his lonesome _ stalled two weeks ago when he
suffered a fluke back injury preparing for the Open, but it was a
temporary setback. He will be a force to reckon with at every major
he enters save Roland Garros through at least 2002 and likely
longer at Wimbledon, where the length of his points are timed in
nanoseconds.
</P>
<P>
   If he stays in shape, Pete could still win on the grass at 35.
</P>
<P>
   Agassi's shelf life can also be as long as he wants it to be. I
mean, here's a guy who has been in three consecutive Slam finals,
winning two of them, after his career had appeared over, for the
second time, two years ago. Agassi, the master of self-reinvention,
has far fewer miles on his body than any of the game's other
gracefully aging elite players.
</P>
<P>
   His style of play also minimizes wear and tear. Unless he falls
in love again with a beautiful actress, his next couple of years
should cement his place among the greatest of the game's greats.
Having squandered numerous opportunities to make his mark in his
early 20s, Andre is like the college dropout who returns to school
late in life, determined to get his degree. He's hungry, something
he rarely showed during his image-is-everything period.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely feel I have more titles in me,'' Agassi argued
after defeating Martin in five sets. ``I feel like I can get
stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin, meanwhile, is an altogether different case study.
Ostensibly a peer of Pete's and Andre's, he was barely good enough
to survive on the tour at an age when the aforementioned
Wunkerkinder were the toast of same.
</P>
<P>
   After a short stint in college, he turned pro in 1992 and then
spent the next six years trying hard to stay invisible. When he did
surface, he didn't enhance his reputation much, losing the
Australian Open final of 1994 in straight sets to Sampras, then
choking away a '96 semifinal at Wimbledon, a tournament he might
have won.
</P>
<P>
   But clean living makes him a young 29, and he believes his best
tennis is ahead of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lately, I've been thinking of the tortoise-and-the-hare
analogy,'' Martin said before the Open. ``I'm the tortoise. I'm
slower than a lot of other players. I'm also very deliberate. But I
show up every day and work hard. If I continue to do so, I stand
the best chance in my career of competing for an important
tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps winning one. For three sets Sunday, he was good
enough.

PATRIOTS DEFENSE STOPS AT NOTHING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Sunday's victory, of course, was a
mini-Super Bowl for the Patriots, beating the despised Jets here
when thoughts of the real Super Bowl already were sweeping the
Meadowlands early in the first Sunday of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, as New England defensive lineman Chad Eaton pointedly put
it, ``there's something wrong with the Jets' offseason conditioning
program.''
</P>
<P>
   Those words had been said time and again about New England since
the dismal end of last season. If it had been New England coaches
who had sat down Tom Tupa (6 of 10, 165 yards, 3 TDs) and brought
in shaky Rick Mirer as quarterback on the first play of the fourth
quarter, even after Tupa had his team on the move and had just
completed a nifty 14-yard pass to Keyshawn Johnson, critics would
have been hoarse by sunset.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, even though the Patriots defense had its
``ugly'' moments, as cornerback Ty Law said, it was the defense
that helped save New England's sweetest victory in months, if not
years. Players who had been beat earlier in the game _ Chris Slade,
Steve Israel, and Law the most prominent _ came back to make key
plays in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Law has to be first. The Patriots corner said he was ``bored out
there'' for much of the game as New York's offensive formations
often left him guarding running backs. In other words, Law was
looking for Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   That matchup came as coach Pete Carroll grew more and more
worried as the game clock wore down to 6 minutes left, then 5, then
4, then 3:45. The Jets were in control of the ball, the clock, and
seemingly the game as Mirer stepped back to throw on a
second-and-10 situation from his 45-yard line. The Jets were lined
up in a familiar formation, ``the one they called me for pass
interference before,'' and Law was on Johnson and sensed Johnson
was going for a short slant route.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keyshawn had been coming up big for them all day long,'' said
Law, ``and so maybe I would have thrown to him, too.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Jets came out in formation, ``I kind of sensed what they
were going to do,'' said Law. ``It was me and Keyshawn on the back
side (of the formation) and I was on him one-on-one and I knew nine
times out of 10 he was going to get the ball. So I was right on his
hip pocket.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept my eyes on the quarterback, and I kind of knew what he
was going to do. And then I just broke when Keyshawn did, and for
that one split second I was looking for an interception. But then I
thought if I didn't come up with the interception, maybe Keyshawn
would come up with the big ball.''
</P>
<P>
   So Law did what his reputation now demands and the millions of
dollars paid to him now require. He went head-to-head against the
Jets' best receiver with the game hanging in the balance, and made
the play that had to be made. As Johnson cut quickly to the inside,
Law shadowed him and ``got a good piece'' of the pass.
</P>
<P>
   The ball spun crazily into the air, and the only defender near
it was Slade. As much as _ or more than _ any Patriot, the outside
linebacker wanted to beat Bill Parcells's team; ``It's been a long
time coming against this team,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the first quarter it was Slade who had been beaten, and
beaten badly, when Vinny Testaverde fired a 27-yard touchdown pass
down the right sideline to running back Richie Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got beat on that play,'' said Slade. ``But, hey, there are a
lot of big plays to be made in a game. I tried to forget about that
and just keep going.''
</P>
<P>
   With Mirer's deflected pass ready for the taking, Slade leaped
to pull in the interception.
</P>
<P>
   The play was made, just as Willie McGinest had made his plays
earlier and just as Law had initiated the interception with tight
coverage on Johnson. Slade, McGinest, Law, Lawyer Milloy, and a few
others are counted on to make plays in these situations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certain guys are counted on to make big plays on this team as
opportunities come, to change the whole game,'' said Slade. ``I
consider myself one of those guys. Willie (McGinest) considers
himself one of those guys. We're guys who try to make a difference
when it counts.''
</P>
<P>
   Also beaten earlier, and also very confused, Israel twice came
up with big plays in the second half. But in the eerie silence of
Giants Stadium after Testaverde had just been wheeled off the field
with his torn Achilles' tendon, a confused Israel had allowed
former teammate Tupa to complete an embarrassing 25-yard TD pass to
Johnson on his first pass attempt in three years. Instead of being
dispirited and down, with the game and their season perhaps over,
the Jets again were alive.
</P>
<P>
   Israel made amends in the second half, though, blind-siding Tupa
on a corner blitz on the third play of the third quarter, a big
play that led directly to a New England score. And then, in the
fourth quarter, Israel shadowed receiver Dedric Ward and
intercepted a lazy pass from Mirer at the Patriots 2-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   The corner blitz was ``a picture-perfect call'' by defensive
coordinator Steve Sidwell, said Israel, ``and they never saw me
coming. I came clean, and once you come clean you've got to make
sure to make something happen. So I'm thinking, `They never saw me
coming and a sack's not going to be good enough.' I had to look for
a way to get the ball out, and that's what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Israel pounced on Tupa from the blind side and knocked the ball
loose. The ball was batted around until finally, in the Jets end
zone, it was McGinest who recovered it for an easy New England
touchdown and 17-16 lead. As important as the score, the play
showed an aggressiveness missing from the Patriots defense when
Tupa first replaced Testaverde in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   For McGinest to score the TD was also a symbolic recovery.
``Last year was hard for me to take,'' he said of his
injury-plagued campaign. ``And it was great to win this, but we got
to remember we don't just have to beat the Jets. We're trying to
win the AFC East. And now we've got to worry about the Indianapolis
Colts.''
</P>
<P>
   But not until after many Patriots and Patriots fans savor this
win over the Jets for a day.

NORTH KOREA AGREES TO END MISSILE TESTING IN EXCHANGE FOR ECONOMIC
AID 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ North Korea has tentatively agreed to end its
testing of long-range ballistic missiles in exchange for a
commitment from the United States and Japan to move forward with
economic assistance for the Communist government there, American
officials said on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, which was reached on Sunday in Berlin after five
days of negotiations there by American and North Korean diplomats,
appears to end the immediate threat that North Korea will test a
new long-range missile this autumn.
</P>
<P>
   American officials cautioned, however, that the agreement was
dependent on what one described as ``the always questionable
sincerity of the North Koreans,'' and that North Korea could
quickly reverse course and resume tests of its long-range missiles
within weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``They could be back in business with the missiles in a hurry,''
said one Clinton administration official. ``This is one positive
step in what has proved to be a long, frustrating process.''
</P>
<P>
   The North Koreans have begun preparations for a new test of
their latest long-range missile, which is believed to be capable of
striking portions of Alaska and Hawaii. Washington officials have
been monitoring activities at the North Korean launching site by
satellite.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese have been particularly alarmed by the threat of a
new test, because the last long-range missile tested by the
Pyongyang government flew directly over Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The talks in Berlin were being held about the time that the
administration thought the North Koreans might test the new
Taepodong 2 rocket. North Korea is marking the 50th anniversary of
Communist rule this month, and some analysts had suggested that the
missile test would be staged as part of the celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, South Korea and Japan had shown an unusually
high degree of diplomatic coordination in condemning North Korea
and pledging to slow down food and oil assistance if the test was
carried out. On Sunday, while meeting in Auckland, New Zealand,
during the Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, President
Clinton, Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi of Japan and President Kim
Dae- jung of South Korea committed to penalizing North Korea if it
conducted the test.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Japan and the United States also agreed to conduct
joint research on a missile-defense system that in theory could
destroy ballistic missiles from North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   In June, a U.S. envoy, former Defense Secretary William J.
Perry, laid out proposals essentially offering to lift some trade
sanctions and to begin a formal recognition of North Korea in
return for a halt to its missile testing and an end to its export
of missile technology to the Middle East and Pakistan.

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
LANDOVER, Md. _ With just more than four minutes gone in overtime,
Emmitt Smith lowered his head and plowed straight into the line,
Troy Aikman performed his own nifty bit of sleight-of-hand to sell
the ball fake, and Rocket Ismail went right down the middle of the
field like a, well, rocket, practically leaving a trail of smoke as
he gathered in the pass and zoomed into the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   And just like that, it was over.
</P>
<P>
   There are NFL games of little worth that cannot end soon enough.
There are other games that a football fan would like to see go on
forever, not so much for their technical brilliance as the sheer
entertainment factor.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas and Washington turned Redskins Stadium into a sandlot and
turned the latest incarnation of their fevered rivalry into the
equivalent of Moe and Curly exchanging two-fingered pokes in the
eye.
</P>
<P>
   Yet when all of the dropped passes, blown coverages, penalties
and missed field goals had faded into the shadows, what remained
was an image of a stirring comeback that had the Cowboys trailing
by 21 with 12 minutes left in regulation and winning the season
opener 41-35.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman's 76-yard connection with Ismail was a virtual repeat of
the same play _ ``132 run it'' in the lexicon of the playbook _
tried by the Cowboys late in the first quarter. The only difference
was that on the first toss, the ball dropped right through Ismail's
hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we broke out of the huddle there in the overtime, I just
told Rocket, `Go get it,''' said Smith. ``I knew all I had to do
was to make a good fake, and he'd probably be open.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew Rocket would be wide-open,'' said offensive tackle Erik
Williams. ``He's open on that play every single time we run it in
practice. He was open in the first quarter. It was only a matter of
whether he'd come down with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ismail did, and that set off the kind of
out-of-the-back-of-the-end-zone celebration that usually comes with
the high-stakes atmosphere of a playoff game.
</P>
<P>
   Club owner Jerry Jones called it the greatest comeback in the
history of the Cowboys. Aikman said it was the wildest game he'd
ever been in. Smith called it inspirational. Michael Irvin said it
was like going to war and coming out a survivor. Head coach Chan
Gailey called it a character-builder that will pay off even bigger
dividends down the line.
</P>
<P>
   They are, of course, entitled to all of those opinions. Mostly
because these Cowboys, coming off last season's homestretch failure
and nose dive into an empty pool in the playoffs, need for those
opinions to be true if they are going to compete in a wide-open
Super race in the first season of the post-Elway era.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that cornerback Kevin Mathis' frequent brain lock
makes Deion Sanders' case of turf toe look like a hangnail. Forget
that the Redskins' Stephen Davis ran for 109 yards and journeyman
quarterback Brad Johnson threw for 382 yards against the supposedly
improved Dallas defense.
</P>
<P>
   There was Smith running for 109 yards. There was Irvin catching
five passes for 122 passes and two touchdowns, double his TD total
from 1998. There was Aikman doing a fourth-quarter Elway
impersonation that was as good as or better than anything by Elway
himself. And there was Ismail, the trumpeted ``speed'' receiver on
the opposite side of the field who can take defensive pressure off
Irvin. He caught eight passes and gained 149 yards.
</P>
<P>
   There might be those who remember another wide receiver who was
going to play that role and had an equally impressive debut. In the
1997 season opener at Pittsburgh, Anthony Miller caught two
touchdown passes in a 37-7 win and then almost fell off the face of
the earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is a team that is going to come together because
of this win,'' said Irvin. ``We have some veteran guys who know how
to win, and we have some younger guys who are looking to be shown
the way.''
</P>
<P>
   It did certainly help that the Redskins were directional arrows
themselves for the Cowboys, rolling up a 35-14 advantage early in
the fourth quarter and then collapsing like a tepee in a hurricane.
Dallas did make plays on defense. And the Cowboys did make a
momentum-changing play when rookie Dat Nguyen recovered an onside
kick.
</P>
<P>
   But there was also some boneheadedness by embattled Redskins
coach Norv Turner, who seemed to reach into the Kevin Gilbride toy
box of play calling. One possession in the final two minutes of the
fourth quarter lasted just 24 seconds and netted three straight
incompletions.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys also benefited when holder Matt Turk fumbled the
snap on what could have been a game-winning 41-yard field goal by
Washington's Brett Conway at the end of regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Yet none of that mattered in the crush of the celebration. Or in
the level of the entertainment provided.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just means we're 1-0,'' Gailey said. ``But it sure feels a
lot better.''
</P>
<P>
   And you have to start somewhere.

</P>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ True, Adam Vinatieri had little more
than an extra point for the Patriots to win the game that so few
thought they could win. A field goal from the 13-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   Routine?
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to take it like a normal kick,'' said the Patriots
place kicker, whose 23-yard field goal with three seconds left put
the official stamp on the Patriots' 30-28 victory. ``I tried not to
get too messed up in the head about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The same might not be said of New England fans. This magnificent
game for those who love wild and wacky football already had had its
weird kicking moment. It came when Patriots long snapper Mike
Bartrum hiked the ball virtually into the mez- zanine of Giants
Stadium, instead of to punter Lee Johnson, giving New York a safety
just before halftime.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't thinking of Bart doing that (again),'' said Vinatieri
of the moments just before the winning kick. ``That's about the
first and only time I've seen Bart do something like that, in
practice, games, any- thing. He's a great snapper and I guess he
was just trying to show he was human.''
</P>
<P>
   The heavy lifting for these win- ning points had been done by
Vina-H tieri's teammates _ quarterback L Drew Bledsoe, wide
receivers Troy Brown and Terry Glenn, running back Terry Allen and
the offensive line. The Patriots twice got seldom- seen first downs
on running plays in  &UR; -------------------- &LR;  the winning drive, even
if one was called back because of a motion pen- alty.
</P>
<P>
   But Vinatieri still had to put foot to ball, even if he was
thinking as he trotted onto the field, ``this team has so much
heart ... they got us nice and close and worked the clock L down.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; -------------------- &LR;  Vinatieri swung his foot as L smoothly
and calmly as a golfer swinging a wedge, and the ball sailed
through the uprights. The Patriot victory seemed certain ... well,
until the kickoff following the field goal. Just as happened in the
final exhibi- tion game against Carolina, Vinatieri did not do what
he wanted to do on  &UR; -------------------- &LR;  the kickoff after making
a clutch field goal.
</P>
<P>
   The worst thing to happen on the kickoff in this situation would
be a Jets return for a touchdown. The second-worst thing would be
what Vinatieri did in Carolina, a very short kick that would give
the Jets a last-gasp field-goal attempt. The L third-worst thing
would be a kickoff out of bounds, allowing New York one more play
from scrimmage when anything could happen.
</P>
<P>
   Vinatieri kicked the ball out of bounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to do a power squib,'' said the kicker, ``and I
was trying to hit it down the middle. Un- fortunately, I don't know
if the refs started the (25-second) clock wrong but as I started
taking my steps, I saw the (other Patriots on the kick- off team)
just starting to pan out and line up. But I looked up at the clock
and there was only 4 seconds left.''
</P>
<P>
   Vinatieri was torn. Kick the ball quickly even though his
teammates might not be ready or allow the clock to run down, take
the penalty and bring the ball a crucial 5 more yards closer to the
Patriot goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I sprinted up to the ball, I approached it too fast and my
steps got kind of screwed up,'' he said. ``Personally, I didn't
know whether it was better to take the penalty or get the ball
off.''
</P>
<P>
   All's well that ends well for the Patriots. A Hail Mary pass
from Jets QB Rick Mirer was batted down by the Patriot defense as
time expired and the saga of Adam Vinatieri con- tinued.
</P>
<P>
   His clutch field goals now are getting routine. It's the
kickoffs fol- lowing those clutch field goals that aren't.

   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Want to be a backup quarterback?
</P>
<P>
   Imagine watching on the sideline while the starter suffers a
season-ending Achilles' tendon injury with your team trailing,
10-7, in the second quarter. Consider the confidence that is likely
drained from fans _ and possibly teammates _ when you take the
field. Then try to go out and win the game.
</P>
<P>
   New York Jets backup quarterback Tom Tupa, who is used almost
exclusively as a punter, came close to pulling it off in Sunday's
contest with the Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   Playing with his fifth team in 11 seasons (including a
three-year stint with the Patriots), Tupa, who last started at
quarterback in 1991 with Phoenix, completed 6 of 10 passes for 165
yards and 2 touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was always prepared during the whole offseason for this, and
I was at all the quarterback meetings, so I knew there's always a
chance this could happen,'' said Tupa, who entered the game having
thrown 11 touchdown passes in his career, two since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple of games I was supposed to go in, but with the way we
were going, they wanted to see a little bit more of the guys so I
didn't see any snaps this year in preseason.''
</P>
<P>
   His performance wasn't bad considering Jets coach Bill Parcells
put him in merely to keep the Jets honest in what he called ``a
holding pattern'' until the fourth quarter, when he could put
regular backup Rick Mirer in.
</P>
<P>
   NFL rules state you must designate an ``emergency'' quarterback
prior to the contest, and if you insert that quarterback prior to
the fourth quarter, you lose the services of your backup
signal-caller for the remainder of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells had designated Mirer as his emergency QB. So if he had
brought Mirer in when Vinny Testaverde ruptured his Achilles'
tendon in the second quarter, he would have lost Tupa's punting
services for the rest of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells said later that Mirer would be the starter, but at
least he knows he'll still have a solid player on the bench. ``Tom
came in, got us a touchdown right away, and took us back down
again,'' said Parcells. ``Two touchdowns, not much else you can
expect from a guy that's second string.''
</P>
<P>
   Tupa's first touchdown came on his first pass of the game, a
25-yard toss to wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson that put the Jets
ahead, 14-10.
</P>
<P>
   ``They gave me a great play to start off with, because (the
Patriots) were still back in zone,'' said Tupa. ``They were off the
guy I was going to throw to, so I got him the ball. I knew they
would be back a bit, and I told the coaches let's try to go deep a
few times.''
</P>
<P>
   Tupa said he felt the quick touchdown pass gave the Jets
confidence. ``Vinny had a great year last year, and the last few
years,'' he said. ``I think when the quarterback goes down you have
a tendency to let down a little bit but after that play we got
going a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the beginning of a most eventful day for Tupa, who threw
for his second touchdown in the third quarter, a 7-yarder to tight
end Fred Baxter that gave the Jets a 27-22 lead.
</P>
<P>
   He also had a 4-yard run on a fourth-quarter fake punt on fourth
and 5 from the New England 14. Tupa was stopped by tackle Chad
Eaton and defensive back Larry Whigham just shy of the first down.
</P>
<P>
   After the Jets challenged the spot of the ball and officials
checked the replay, the call was upheld.
</P>
<P>
   ``The official on the play got knocked for a loop, and then he
went and spotted the ball,'' said Parcells. ``That's the way it is.
I'm not disputing the call. I'm just saying that's why I challenged
it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I made it, but obviously they saw something
different,'' said Tupa. ``I don't know what they saw on television,
but I thought it was pretty close.''
</P>
<P>
   Tupa had a better day than Mirer, who completed 4 of 11 for 28
yards and two interceptions. But Tupa has no illusions about who
the new starter is. ``I think going into next week, we're going to
have a great week of practice with Rick and just move forward,'' he
said.

JETS' SUPER THOUGHTS TURN TO SURVIVAL 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Throughout the preseason, Jets fans and
the New York media wondered ``what would happen without Vinny?''
</P>
<P>
   Now they'll find out.
</P>
<P>
   The talk has moved rapidly from Super Bowl to survival.
</P>
<P>
   When Vinny Testaverde went out for the season in the second
quarter of Sunday's season opener against the New England Patriots
with a ruptured Achilles' tendon, so went the hopes of another big
season for the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   It was evident backups Tom Tupa and Rick Mirer cannot do the
job. At least not like Testaverde, who was coming off a Pro Bowl
season and was expected to do it again in '99.
</P>
<P>
   Tupa played very well in an emergency role. He seemed to have
the Jets on the verge of an incredible victory when his coach, Bill
Parcells, made the decision that changed the game.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells decided to bring on veteran Rick Mirer, whom he traded
for during training camp and who played well in New York's final
exhibition game against Minnesota, throwing for three touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Mirer was given a 28-27 lead to protect and couldn't do it. He
threw a critical interception with time running down in the fourth
quarter that the Patriots turned into the winning field goal with
three seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   It was a terrible throw by Mirer, into heavy coverage, that
bounced into the hands of Chris Slade. The game seemed to be
slipping away from the Patriots after a tough Jets defense made a
succession of big plays. But Mirer gave it back with one throw.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells found himself in an unusual situation in the second
quarter. Early Sunday morning, concerned with the Patriots' fast
wide receivers and their ability to spread out the field, he
decided to add untested defensive back Jermaine Jones from the
practice squad and take Ray Lucas off the active roster.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas is a combination backup quarterback/special teams player.
The gamble backfired when Testaverde went down. Vinny is one of the
most durable and better-conditioned athletes in the NFL. He has
missed just eight games since 1987 because of injury. He doesn't
figure to get hurt. But he did this time.
</P>
<P>
   Now Parcells had another decision to make. If he played Mirer
for Testaverde right away, Tupa, who is also the Jets' punter,
would be done for the day. The reason: Parcells had put only one
backup quarterback, Tupa, on the active game roster, with Mirer
designated as the emergency quarterback. By NFL rules, if Mirer
were inserted before the fourth quarter, Tupa would have been
ineligible.
</P>
<P>
   Tupa played well, completing 6 of 10 passes for two touchdowns
and 165 yards, but Parcells took him out at the start of the fourth
quarter. Mirer did not play well, throwing two interceptions. He
looked very nervous in the pocket, and several of his throws were
wobbly.
</P>
<P>
   It was a devastating day for the Jets. Testaverde's loss is a
backbreaker. But New York was crippled by other injuries as well.
Leon Johnson, a solid running back and special teams player,
suffered ligament damage to his knee and likely is out for the
season. Parcells counts on him for 30-35 plays a game. Tight end
Eric Green left in the second half with a neck injury. The Jets
were thin at tight end to begin with as Kyle Brady, who started all
of last season for them at that position, left for Jacksonville via
free agency. The Jets signed Green and hoped second-year man Blake
Spence would come along fast behind him. But Spence was hurt twice
in preseason.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the Jets built a powerful offense around Testaverde's
ability to throw the ball quickly and to the right man. That's just
what he was doing Sunday until he suffered the freak injury,
without being hit.
</P>
<P>
   His understudies are not to blame, but it became evident Tupa
and Mirer could neither make the decisions as fast as Testaverde,
nor deliver the ball nearly as well.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells had said during preseason that the thing he liked about
the Jets offense was the number of big weapons he had at his
disposal. Testaverde, Wayne Chrebet, Keyshawn Johnson, Curtis
Martin. Now two of them, Testaverde and Chrebet (who broke his foot
in an exhibition game, also without being hit), are gone. Johnson
was brilliant in defeat, making one spectacular play after another,
but will now see double coverage everywhere he goes.
</P>
<P>
   Next week the Jets go on the road to play Buffalo, which was
surprised by the Colts Sunday in Indianapolis. New York could
easily start the season 0-2. That happened last season, and
Parcells got the Jets to the AFC Championship Game. But he had
Vinny.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells also lost the first two games in his last season with
New England, when the Patriots went to the Super Bowl. But he had
Drew.
</P>
<P>
   This time there is no one at his disposal who can throw the ball
like either of those guys.

DIAMONDBACKS FIND OUT WHAT MONEY CAN BUY

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Promise Keepers are coming to Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   The men's religious organization started by former Colorado
football coach Bill McCartney has booked Bank One Ballpark on Oct.
22-23 for the final stop on their latest nationwide tour. The
stadium is expected to be filled both days, although there's no
word yet on how they'll utilize the swimming pool beyond the
right-field fence.
</P>
<P>
   There's only one problem. The World Series is scheduled to open
on Oct. 22, a Saturday, in the National League city, putting
Promise Keepers on a collision course with the Arizona
Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll deal with it when it becomes an issue,'' stadium booking
manager Charles Johnston said. ``But no one in the Promise Keepers
organization thinks it's going to be an issue, because they don't
think the Diamondbacks are going to go to the World Series.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, the Promise Keepers, with a much more important
agenda on their minds, haven't been keeping up with the latest
trend in sports. There was a time when it was completely
unreasonable to expect a second-year expansion team to make the
playoffs, much less go all the way to the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Not anymore. All that is needed is a little faith, a little hope
and a lot of money. This is the sports era of instant
gratification: If an owner can afford to buy himself a pennant,
there is nothing in the way to stop him.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Huizenga did it with the Florida Marlins in 1997, and
Jerry Colangelo is doing it with the Diamondbacks. With less than
three weeks to go in the season, the Diamondbacks, in their second
season of existence, have a seven-game lead in the National League
West and, barring a complete collapse, have all but wrapped up a
division title.
</P>
<P>
   It will be a record for an expansion team making the playoffs.
The Colorado Rockies snuck in as a wild-card team in 1995, their
third season in existence.
</P>
<P>
   But as Colangelo pointed out last week, ``The Rockies didn't win
their division. We're in a position not only to get there, but win
our division. We have an opportunity to make history.''
</P>
<P>
   The price has been steep but Colangelo has never wavered, even
when his fellow owners demanded a $130 million franchise fee. When
Travis Lee, the second overall pick in the 1996 draft, was made a
free agent after the Minnesota Twins failed to offer him a
contract, the Diamondbacks stepped in and signed him for a
staggering $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   That was just the start. Baseball officials around the country
were further appalled when the Diamondbacks, before the 1998
season, signed shortstop Jay Bell to a five-year, $34 million deal
and gave third baseman Matt Williams a five-year, $45 million
extension.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks then paid $118.9 million this off-season for
free-agent pitchers Randy Johnson, Todd Stottlemyre, Greg Swindell
and Armando Reynoso, center fielder Steve Finley and first baseman
Greg Colbrunn.
</P>
<P>
   Pitching was most important, and adding the four free agents to
a staff that already included Andy Benes, Omar Daal and Brian
Anderson caught people's attention. Suddenly, the Diamondbacks had
a staff to compete with the Atlanta Braves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pitching is the No. 1 ingredient, and this team has it,''
Finley said. ``When you've got a rotation like ours, especially
with Randy Johnson leading it, your goal is to make the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Shrewd trades also have helped, especially on offense. They
dealt fifth outfielder Karim Garcia to the Detroit Tigers for Luis
Gonzalez, who is third in the league in hitting, and they got Tony
Womack from the Pittsburgh Pirates for two minor-leaguers, thus
solving their leadoff problems. Womack leads the league with 64
stolen bases.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks scored 667 runs last season, fourth-fewest in
the National League. But, because of the trades and because
Williams and Bell are enjoying their best seasons ever, the
Diamondbacks are on pace to score 884 runs this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the reasons we are where we are,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the biggest trade was made on July 9 when the
Diamondbacks acquired closer Matt Mantei from the Florida Marlins
for pitchers Vladimir Nunez and Brad Penney, reinforcing the
Diamondbacks' one troubled spot. They were 47-40 on the day the
trade was made and 36-17 since then.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where would we be if we had Matt Mantei all year?'' Colangelo
said. ``When you are close and you can smell it, you better go for
it. You just don't know when the opportunity is going to come
again. My input _ we go now.''
</P>
<P>
   Colangelo said the Diamondbacks are in this for the long run and
won't be another one-year wonder like the Marlins. They already
have the fan support, averaging 37,577 fans a game, fourth in the
National League.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks are hoping for a long run that includes many
Octobers with full stands, and not just for late-month Promise
Keepers rallies.
\Nsubheds:Evaluating the expansion teams \Nsubheds:Anaheim Angels
1st season: 1961. 1st title: 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Original blueprint: The Angels did well in the first expansion
and had some good young players. But they never could win with them
and eventually went heavy for free agents. \Nsubheds:Texas Rangers
1st season: 1961. 1st title: 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Original blueprint: This organization was in total chaos when
they were the Washington Senators, with absolutely no discernible
plan at all. It was a long climb to respectability once they got to
Texas in 1972. \Nsubheds:New York Mets
1st season: 1962. 1st title: 1969.
</P>
<P>
   Original blueprint: The Mets were a joke when they first
started, but they put together an outstanding farm system in the
1960s. That brought about a miracle in 1969. \Nsubheds:Houston
Astros
1st season: 1962. 1st title: 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Original blueprint: The Astros also landed some decent young
players early, and they've been respectable for much of their 38
seasons. But they've never had the financial power to finish the
job. \Nsubheds:Montreal Expos
1st season: 1969. 1st title: 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Original blueprint: The Expos went for veterans in the expansion
draft and tried to be contender early. They failed, but by the
mid-'70s, they had put together a farm system that remains one of
the most productive in baseball. \Nsubheds:San Diego Padres
1st season: 1969. 1st title: 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Original blueprint: They went for young players and did a
terrible job. Then they tried to buy players and weren't very good
at that. \Nsubheds:Kansas City Royals
1st season: 1969. 1st title: 1976.
</P>
<P>
   Original blueprint: They went young from the start and did it
right, needing only eight seasons to win their first division
title. They were a model franchise until owner Ewing Kauffman died.
\Nsubheds:Milwaukee Brewers
1st season: 1969. 1st title: 1982.
</P>
<P>
   Original blueprint: They started as the Seattle Pilots and went
with too many veterans early. The franchise turned the corner in
1978 when Harry Dalton became general manager and he built a strong
farm system. \Nsubheds:Toronto Blue Jays
1st season: 1977. 1st title: 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Original blueprint: The best expansion franchise ever because
Pat Gillick did it right from the start, building up an impressive
farm system. They won 89 games in 1983 and remained competitive
until the 1994-95 strike crushed their attendance.
\Nsubheds:Seattle Mariners
1st season: 1977. 1st title: 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Original blueprint: They went with young players early, but bad
ownership doomed the franchise from the start. Everything started
to change on June 2, 1987, when they drafted Ken Griffey Jr.
\Nsubheds:Florida Marlins
1st season: 1993. 1st title: 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Original blueprint: They were going nice and slow until owner
Wayne Huizenga decided to splurge in 1997. Then they dismantled and
started over again, basically as a second expansion franchise.
\Nsubheds:Colorado Rockies
1st season: 1993. 1st title: none.
</P>
<P>
   Original blueprint: Their geography has set the rules. All
hitting, no pitching. They won the wild card in 1995 with their
offense. They're trying to develop sinkerball pitchers, but are
having limited success. \Nsubheds:Tampa Bay Devil Rays
1st season: 1998. 1st title: none.
</P>
<P>
   Original blueprint: They went hard on some free agents without
any real success. The farm system is being developed properly.
\Nsubheds:Arizona Diamondbacks
1st season: 1998. 1st title: none.

   Original blueprint: Spend money. Owner Jerry Colangelo came out
with his wallet wide open and hasn't slowed up yet.

INJURIES LEAVE JETS LICKING THEIR WOUNDS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ New York Jets quarterback Vinny
Testaverde suffered a season-ending rupture of his left Achilles'
tendon with no one within five feet of him. Running back Leon
Johnson tore the anterior cruciate and medial colateral ligaments
in his left knee; he also is out for the season. Defensive tackle
Jason Ferguson suffered a sprained right ankle.
</P>
<P>
   And, for two minutes, tight end Eric Green couldn't feel a
thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``My whole body went numb. I couldn't feel my legs, my arms. It
was a scary feeling,'' said Green, who suffered a neck injury
following a head-first hit in Sunday's 30-28 loss to the Patriots.
He returned to action and will be evaluated Monday.
</P>
<P>
   New England suffered injuries as well. Tackle Zefross Moss
sprained his left ankle, guard Heath Irwin suffered a right knee
sprain, and running back Lamont Warren had a right thigh contusion.
</P>
<P>
   But the Patriots' injuries paled in comparison to those of the
Jets, who lost not only one of their leaders in Testaverde but
another key player in Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   That meant within hours all the talk about the team making it to
their first Super Bowl since 1969 shifted to whether the team could
salvage the season amid an onslaught of misfortune.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see where we're at,'' said Jets coach Bill Parcells.
``Johnson and Testaverde are gone for the year. That's two of our
big losses, two guys that are productive offensive players.''
</P>
<P>
   It marks the first time Testaverde will miss a game since 1997,
when a knee strain kept him out of the last three weeks of the
season. Sunday's injury came after he took a couple of steps
forward to pounce on a Curtis Martin fumble then went to the turf,
wincing in pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what happened,'' said Martin, the former Patriot.
``I got the ball and I believe (Patriots defensive lineman Willie)
McGinest stripped it, and I fell on it. I looked up and I could see
that Vinny was down.
</P>
<P>
   ``You usually don't see him lying there. If he falls down, he
just gets right up. I said, `Come on, Vinny.' When see him lying
there like that, you know it's serious.''
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde was helped off the field and carried via a cart out
of the arena, a towel draped over his head. He was scheduled to be
operated on Sunday night at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's life in the big city,'' said Parcells, who initially
brought in Tom Tupa to replace Testaverde but later subbed Rick
Mirer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very humbling game. It's a game that can turn very
quickly. We have 15 games to go, and we have to figure out how to
approach those and keep going.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the Jets took the injuries with the same mindset.
Linebacker Bryan Cox said the team has enough players to make up
for the losses and praised his teammates for almost winning the
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure guys are going to make it. Just as you were hooping
it up, `Super Bowl, Super Bowl,' you're going to say, `We're dead,
we're dead, we're dead,' '' he said. ``The bottom line is we still
have to play the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Green reminded one and all that last year's team lost its first
two games and came back to make it to the AFC Championship Game. He
did add, however, that the NFL should consider switching to a
surface other than artificial turf.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they want us to be around for a great period of time, they
definitely should do something about it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson, who had a field day (8 catches
for 194 yards), didn't take the injuries as well.
</P>
<P>
   He began his postgame press conference calmly. Then, when asked
about losing Testaverde, one of the team's most durable players,
for the season, he whispered an expletive then said, ``What can you
do? You can't do anything. Nothing. You can't do (expletive). We
couldn't (expletive) throw. We were throwing interceptions. Man,
this is just . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson then slammed his fists on the podium and stormed out of
the interview room.

   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Argentine writer Dante Panzeri described
soccer's attraction as ``La Dinamica de lo Impensado'' _ the
dynamic of the unexpected _ in his book published in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   So many imponderable occurrences, the ball played hundreds and
hundreds of times, players interacting, each decision accompanied
by dozens of options, everyone trying to tame the ball and bring a
sense of order to the chaos through the sheer force of their
intelligence and skill.
</P>
<P>
   When the stakes are high and the teams are low in the standings,
pragmatism takes precedence over beauty. But so many things can
happen that an analysis of the game is incomplete without an
explanation of most of them.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, after the Revolution and Miami Fusion played to a
1-1 regulation-time tie, the story of the game Saturday night
became the post-match shootout. Revolution goalkeeper Jeff Causey
was ejected by referee Ricardo Valenzuela for taking down Miami's
Welton, and was replaced by striker Joe-Max Moore in what became a
parody of a gimmick. The Fusion won the shootout, 3-2, and moved 1
point ahead of the Revolution in the battle for the final playoff
spot in the Eastern Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, more enticing and important questions went
unanswered, as the shootout took precedence over the 90 minutes of
drama.
</P>
<P>
   Why did Mike Burns and Brian Dunseth switch positions after
Miami's goal? How bad was Ivan McKinley's concussion and will he be
in condition to make his international debut for South Africa this
week? Is Imad Baba prepared to be thrown head-first into a playoff
race after missing six months with a groin and hip injury? Why did
Paulo Dos Santos look like an accomplished veteran when he was in
central midfield, and why did he and John Harkes switch roles
midway through the second half? Was Leonel Alvarez so upset to have
been replaced that he felt compelled to run straight to the locker
room? How could Joe-Max Moore flub such great chances? Was Giovanni
Savarese offside on what appeared to be the winning goal?
</P>
<P>
   Why did the role of Miami's Edwin Gorter devolve from captain of
the team to substitute? What compelled Gorter to spike Mario Gori
in the second half? Is Miami going to permanently switch to a 4-4-2
alignment? Since Welton was evicted by the Revolution, why have
they gone seven successive games without defeating his team in
regulation time? Is Eric Wynalda prepared to be thrown head-first
into a playoff race after missing six months with a knee injury? Is
Longmeadow's Jay Heaps disappointed that he did not play for the US
against Jamaica last week and is he suited to midfield for Miami?
</P>
<P>
   Nobody has been in the mood to examine these questions since the
shootout, after which player-coach Walter Zenga and Moore clashed
with security guards. The theme has been that the Revolution felt
unjustly treated in the shootout, and this will continue until
attention turns to Saturday's opponent, the Columbus Crew.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything can happen in soccer,'' assistant coach Giuseppe
Galderisi said. ``But let us lose because we made a mistake or
because they were better than us.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am happy with the team. Maybe if we win this game we have a
good chance to qualify for the playoffs, but we are still in the
right frame of mind and we kept our confidence high. We didn't lose
and we are still a good team.''

TOUGH WEEK AT POLLS FOR SEMINOLES, NITTANY LIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Florida State barely beats Georgia Tech. Penn State
edges Pittsburgh. Naturally, both were punished this week by the
pollsters, losing some votes.
</P>
<P>
   It's only fair. Tennessee lost three first-place votes a couple
of weeks ago and the Volunteers didn't even play.
</P>
<P>
   It's only September, and poll watching already has started in
earnest.
</P>
<P>
   For those lucky enough to see it (not in Boston without a dish
or a pay-per-view package), Florida State and Georgia Tech staged a
classic, with FSU coming out a 41-35 winner.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that Florida State isn't as good as people thought. The
Seminoles are every bit as good, but they have set the bar so high
that a 6-point win over a tough opponent is not good enough.
</P>
<P>
   What people fail to realize is that Tech may very well be a
great team as well. And that quarterback Joe Hamilton has vaulted
into the Heisman race after an astonishing (22 of 25 for 387 yards
and four touchdowns) effort. Included in that performance was a
streak in which Hamilton, who had been knocked out of the last two
games against the Seminoles, completed his last 14 passes as the
Yelllow Jackets desperately tried to pull off the upset of the
early season.
</P>
<P>
   Not since the Doug Flutie-Bernie Kosar battle of 1984 in the
Miami-Boston College ``Hail Mary'' game has the state of Florida
witnessed such as Saturday night's battle.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton wasn't the only one who established himself in the
Heisman race. All Florida State's Peter Warrick did was catch a
touchdown pass, run for another score, and gain 167 yards in total
offense as FSU extended its home unbeaten streak to 42.
</P>
<P>
   Is FSU as good as most observers think? Maybe not. But by
outlasting Georgia Tech in a true gut-check game, the Seminoles
proved they can trade shots with the best teams around and still
finish on top.
</P>
<P>
   And that may be as true a sign of a champion as any one-sided
win over East Cupcake State.
</P>
<P>
   Over at Penn State, there also probably are mutterings by some
Nittany Lion bandwagoners who feel their team is invincible.
</P>
<P>
   Shed no tears for the Lions over their 20-17 win over
Pittsburgh. Truth be told, Penn State coach Joe Paterno is not all
that disappointed, despite the votes it will cost his team this
week. With two blowouts in a row, the Lions were getting a little
cocky going into next week's game against Miami. Pittsburgh was a
reality check.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew a game like this would come for us because things have
come so easy for us,'' said Paterno. ``You've got to be able to win
a game like this if you've got aspirations.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Alabama might not be in anyone's national title picture, but the
Tide does know how to get off to a good start. With Saturday's
37-10 win over Houston, the Tide is 2-0 for the eighth consecutive
season. Of course, one could argue that the Tide doesn't generally
extend itself in its nonconference games. This year's first two
victims were Vanderbilt and Houston . . . Ron Dayne continues to
pile up yards _ he had 158 in Wisconsin's 50-10 win over Ball State
_ but until he puts up those numbers against what people consider
more serious Big Ten competition, his Heisman chances will be slim
at best . . . Don't expect Alabama-Birmingham to criticize the way
Virginia Tech plays. UAB was limited to 63 yards in total offense
in Saturday's 31-10 loss to the Hokies. In three games, Tech has
outscored UAB, 109-10 . . . Nebraska backup QB Eric Crouch is
trying to win his battle with starter Bobby Newcombe with his
versatility. In Saturday's 45-0 win over California, Crouch came in
and ran for a touchdown, passed for a touchdown, and caught a
touchdown pass, becoming the first Nebraska player since Johnny
Rodgers in 1971 to accomplish that. All told, Crouch scored three
TDs and passed for one . . . Someone needs to give Notre Dame a
lesson in time management. For the second straight week, the Irish
were not so much beaten on the field but beaten by the clock as
time expired in the throes of a final Irish drive. In Saturday's
28-23 loss to Purdue, time ran out with Jarious Jackson trying to
run a final play inside the Boilermakers 10. It was just like last
week, when the Irish lost to Michigan in the final seconds, 26-22.
Part of the problem is that the Irish offense seems to take its
time coming out of the huddle in crucial situations. Now they have
two losses and a game coming up against unbeaten Michigan State . .
. Hmmm. Danny Ford gets inducted into the Clemson Hall of Fame and
the Tigers upset Virginia. The coach of the Tigers' 1981 national
championship team, who was honored at Death Valley for the first
time in 10 years, might be feted every week if the Tigers can keep
pulling off upsets like that . . . Don't look now, but college
football might have another great passing combination ready to move
into prime time _ Georgia QB Quincy Carter and wide receiver
Terrence Edwards, who had seven catches for 90 yards, including a
47-yard TD pass from Carter. All of which contributed to Georgia's
24-9 win over winless South Carolina and coach Lou Holtz.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Florida's pattern for the season seems to be developing nicely.
The Gators may not have the best defense around, but few, if any
teams are going to outscore them. The Gators crushed Central
Florida, 58-27, on Saturday, a result similiar to the Gators' 55-26
win over Western Michigan last weekend. Tennessee looms next week
in what shapes up as the Southeastern Conference game of the year.
In two games, Florida's offense has produced 1,193 yards . . . Glad
to see Temple is off to its usual start. Two games, two losses, and
the Owls have yet to score. Kansas State beat them, 40-0, a week
after Temple's 6-0 loss to Maryland . . . Ronald Curry, who has yet
to decide if he wants to play basketball or football full time at
North Carolina, continues to gather evidence that he may be what
the scouts said he was coming out of high school: a good basketball
player, but a great QB. Curry ran for a TD and passed for 241 yards
and two more scores in the Heels' 42-30 win over Indiana . . . Give
credit to Division 1-AA UConn for hanging with 1-A Kentucky through
three quarters before getting blown out by the Wildcats in the
weekend's other ``basketball'' matchup . . . UMass's 34-19 victory
over New Hampshire proves how good a coach Mark Whipple is. The
Minutemen have only marginally beter talent than New Hampshire, but
Whipple, who is surely on a fast track to a 1-A job next season if
UMass comes close to repeating its championship campaign of a year
ago, and his staff broke down the UNH defenses, calling plays
throughout the day that pounced on every UNH weakness or breakdown.

`STIGMATA' TOPS LIST; OH, THE HORROR!
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- The supernatural continued to hold sway at the
nation's multiplexes as ``Stigmata'' edged out ``The Sixth Sense''
with a better-than-expected $18.5 million at 2,899 theaters during
the Friday-Sunday period in the first weekend following the
record-setting summer, studio sources said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stigmata,'' MGM's tale of demonic possession with echoes of
``The Exorcist,'' pulled the plug on the five-week winning streak
by ``The Sixth Sense'' by taking advantage of the sizzling market
for horror movies. ``It was the right movie at the right time,''
said industry tracker Arthur Rockwell, a former MGM executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stigmata,'' with a reported $30 million budget, became the
fifth horror film in the past two months to meet or exceed
forecasts following ``The Blair Witch Project,'' ``The Haunting,''
``Deep Blue Sea'' and ``The Sixth Sense.'' The quintet has grossed
about $515 million; ``Stigmata'' is likely to wind up its domestic
run with $60 million, according to Robert Bucksbaum, president of
the Reel Source tracking service.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're seeing is that these horror films don't cannibalize
each other,'' Bucksbaum said. ``They play off each other so when
one sells out at a multiplex, people are likely to go see the other
one.''
</P>
<P>
   Bucksbaum also credited long-suffering MGM -- which has scored
its first box office victory since 1996's ``The Birdcage'' -- with
releasing an attention-grabbing trailer featuring lead actress
Patricia Arquette in the throes of a takeover by evil spirits.
``Everyone is going to see these movies right now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite losing the top spot, Disney's ``Sixth Sense'' continued
to post impressive results with $17 million at 2,782 theaters, down
only 25 percent from the previous Friday-Sunday period, to push its
overall take to $198.2 million. The tale of a haunted 8-year-old
boy replaced ``Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade'' for 29th place
on the all-time list.
</P>
<P>
   Horror-hungry moviegoers also offered moderate support to
Artisan's opening of ``Stir of Echoes,'' which finished a distant
third with $6.2 million at 1,888 theaters. ``Echoes,'' a murder
mystery with Kevin Bacon's character acquiring paranormal powers,
gave the top three films an impressive 55 percent of the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't recall a time when three films that were this similar
have done this well,'' Bucksbaum noted.
</P>
<P>
   The trio of chillers lifted overall box office to $75 million,
or 37 percent up from the same weekend last year when ``Rounders''
led with $8.5 million. They also kept up Hollywood's hot streak,
with year-to-date grosses now topping $5.1 billion to lead the same
period of 1998 by about 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is normally one of the slowest weekends of the year since
there's so much attention on going back to school,'' Rockwell
noted. ``The aggressive demand for product by audiences continues
to be phenomenal.''
</P>
<P>
   Holdovers took the remaining slots in the top 10, led by a
continued solid performance from Paramount's ``Runaway Bride'' with
$3.9 million at 2,773 theaters in its seventh weekend. That pulled
the 45-day ``Bride'' total to $140.5 million, replacing ``Deep
Impact'' as the 82nd-highest domestic grosser of all time.
</P>
<P>
   Universal's fifth weekend of ``Bowfinger'' followed in fifth
with $3.7 million at 2,452 screens to top $60 million overall while
Disney's third weekend of ``The 13th Warrior'' continued to fade
with $2.9 million at 2,283 locations. MGM's sixth weekend of ``The
Thomas Crown Affair'' came in seventh with $2.8 million at 1,849
theaters to pull it past $61 million overall.
</P>
<P>
   Warner Bros., which suffered through a disappointing summer,
took the next two spots with its fourth weekend of ``Mickey Blue
Eyes'' with $2.3 million at 1,975 theaters and its second weekend
of ``Chill Factor'' with $1.9 million at 2,558 sites.
</P>
<P>
   Artisan's ninth weekend of ``The Blair Witch Project,'' a key
factor in triggering the late-summer surge in moviegoing, finished
10th with $1.6 million at 1,933 theaters to push its overall total
to $136.2 million. The $35,000 project has become the 88th-highest
grosser of all time, replacing ``Godzilla,'' which carried a price
tag of well over $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   Miramax's third weekend of ``In Too Deep'' came in 11th with
$1.3 million at 641 theaters, followed by its second weekend of
``Outside Providence'' with $1.2 million at 1,052 locations. They
and several other holdovers finished ahead of the debut of romantic
comedy ``Love Stinks,'' starring French Stewart and Tyra Banks,
with a deadly $950,000 at 1,325 theaters in the first release from
Independent Artists.
</P>
<P>
   The weekend also saw Universal generate strong response from
sneak Saturday screenings its romance-drama ``For the Love of the
Game,'' starring Kevin Costner as an aging baseball pitcher. More
than 80 percent of the shows sold out and 94 percent of viewers
polled ranked ``Game,'' which will open Friday at 2,800 theaters,
as ``excellent'' or ``very good.''
</P>
<P>
   Sony also held sneak screenings Saturday of ``Blue Streak,'' its
Martin Lawrence action-comedy which also opens Friday. Bucksbaum
said both new entries should perform well, along with Paramount's
revenge-drama ``Double Jeopardy'' on Sept. 24 and Warner's Gulf War
action project ``Three Kings'' on Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``The studios are going to be offering a lot of diversity this
fall,'' he noted. ``They saw that `Rush Hour' and `The Waterboy'
did very well last fall in part because they were so different from
everything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Final results for the Friday-Sunday period will be released
today.
</P>
<P>
   TOP MOVIES!off! &QL;

VINATIERI SHOWS FLAIR FOR DRAMA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ True, Adam Vinatieri had little more
than an extra point for the Patriots to win the game that so few
thought they could win. A field goal from the 13-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   Routine?
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to take it like a normal kick,'' said the Patriots
place kicker, whose 23-yard field goal with three seconds left put
the official stamp on the Patriots' 30-28 victory &UR;  &LR; Sunday. ``I
tried not to get too messed up in the head about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The same might not be said of New England fans. This magnificent
game for those who love wild and wacky football already had had its
weird kicking moment. It came when Patriots long snapper Mike
Bartrum hiked the ball virtually into the mezzanine of Giants
Stadium, instead of to punter Lee Johnson, giving New York a safety
just before halftime.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't thinking of Bart doing that (again),'' said Vinatieri
of the moments just before the winning kick. ``That's about the
first and only time I've seen Bart do something like that, in
practice, games, anything. He's a great snapper and I guess he was
just trying to show he was human.''
</P>
<P>
   The heavy lifting for these winning points had been done by
Vinatieri's teammates _ quarterback Drew Bledsoe, wide receivers
Troy Brown and Terry Glenn, running back Terry Allen and the
offensive line. The Patriots twice got seldom-seen first downs on
running plays in the winning drive, even if one was called back
because of a motion penalty.
</P>
<P>
   But Vinatieri still had to put foot to ball, even if he was
thinking as he trotted onto the field, ``this team has so much
heart . . . they got us nice and close and worked the clock down.''
</P>
<P>
   Vinatieri swung his foot as smoothly and calmly as a golfer
swinging a wedge, and the ball sailed through the uprights. The
Patriot victory seemed certain . . . well, until the kickoff
following the field goal. Just as happened in the final exhibition
game against Carolina, Vinatieri did not do what he wanted to do on
the kickoff after making a clutch field goal.
</P>
<P>
   The worst thing to happen on the kickoff in this situation would
be a Jets return for a touchdown. The second-worst thing would be
what Vinatieri did in Carolina, a very short kick that would give
the Jets a last-gasp field-goal attempt. The third-worst thing
would be a kickoff out of bounds, allowing New York one more play
from scrimmage when anything could happen.
</P>
<P>
   Vinatieri kicked the ball out of bounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to do a power squib,'' said the kicker, ``and I
was trying to hit it down the middle. Unfortunately, I don't know
if the refs started the (25-second) clock wrong but as I started
taking my steps, I saw the (other Patriots on the kickoff team)
just starting to pan out and line up. But I looked up at the clock
and there was only 4 seconds left.''
</P>
<P>
   Vinatieri was torn. Kick the ball quickly even though his
teammates might not be ready or allow the clock to run down, take
the penalty and bring the ball a crucial 5 more yards closer to the
Patriot goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I sprinted up to the ball, I approached it too fast and my
steps got kind of screwed up,'' he said. ``Personally, I didn't
know whether it was better to take the penalty or get the ball
off.''
</P>
<P>
   All's well that ends well for the Patriots. A Hail Mary pass
from Jets QB Rick Mirer was batted down by the Patriot defense as
time expired and the saga of Adam Vinatieri continued.
</P>
<P>
   His clutch field goals now are getting routine. It's the
kickoffs following those clutch field goals that aren't.

   Miramax's third weekend of ``In Too Deep'' came in 11th with
$1.3 million at 641 theaters, followed by its second weekend of

Independent Artists.

   The weekend also saw Universal generate strong response from
sneak Saturday screenings its romance-drama ``For the Love of the
Game,'' starring Kevin Costner as an aging baseball pitcher. More

polled ranked ``Game,'' which will open Friday at 2,800 theaters,
as ``excellent'' or ``very good.''

   Sony also held sneak screenings Saturday of ``Blue Streak,'' its
Martin Lawrence action-comedy which also opens Friday. Bucksbaum

 By JOHN McCLAIN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
CLEVELAND _ Although they had the first pick in the NFL draft, were
given extra draft choices and took advantage of the salary cap to
load up with veterans who had started for other teams, the new
Cleveland Browns looked like just another horrendous expansion team
against the Pittsburgh Steelers.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Because Art Modell moved the old Browns to Baltimore and renamed
them the Ravens, Cleveland was forced to endure three seasons
without the NFL. When the new Browns were reborn Sunday night in
their new stadium before a national television audience, they
looked like the worst team in the league.
</P>
<P>
   The Pittsburgh Steelers ruined the Browns' coming-out party with
a 43-0 victory before 73,138 fans who barked like Dawgs for about
one quarter, then howled at the moon over the beating they absorbed
from Pittsburgh, which always has been Cleveland's most bitter
rival.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, I'm impressed with our performance, but I can't get too
caught up in it because it's only one game,'' Steelers coach Bill
Cowher said. ``We need to see what happens over the long haul, but
it is hard to find fault with anything tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   The Steelers dominated the Browns in every possible way. They
generated 460 yards and limited the Browns to 40. Cleveland had
only nine yards rushing and two first downs, none in the second
half. The Browns failed to convert a third-down situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we played very poorly,'' Browns coach Chris Palmer
said. ``Defensively, we couldn't get them off the field.
Offensively, we couldn't stay on the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just one game, but we really have no place to go but
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Under new offensive coordinator Kevin Gilbride, Pittsburgh
scored five offensive touchdowns. It didn't score that many in any
game last season.
</P>
<P>
   After being stopped on fourth down on their first series, the
Steelers scored on their next eight possessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't make a lot of big plays, but in terms of
consistency, we played about as well as you can,'' Gilbride said.
``Our guys needed something like this to feel good about
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilbride and quarterback Kordell Stewart got off to a successful
start.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did some things to take advantage of Kordell's
athleticism,'' Gilbride said. ``We wanted to get him on the
perimeter because it opened things up in the middle.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart finished 15-of-23 passing for 173 yards and a touchdown.
He was not intercepted. He also ran six times for 33 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way I like to play my first game,'' Stewart said.
``I had to make a lot of decisions. He (Gilbride) was calling plays
to make me comfortable, and he did a great job. There's still more
to come.''
</P>
<P>
   The Steelers ran for 213 yards, which enabled them to control
the ball for 47 minutes, 49 seconds to Cleveland's 12:11. Jerome
Bettis, who sat out the preseason after undergoing arthroscopic
knee surgery, led the team with 89 yards on 18 carries.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the game went on, I got the rust off,'' Bettis said.
``Coach Gilbride gave us every opportunity to succeed. He called a
great game. Give him a lot of credit.''
</P>
<P>
   The Steelers dominated from start to finish. Steelers strong
safety Chris Oldham intercepted quarterback Ty Detmer to put
Pittsburgh in position for its first touchdown. Stewart rolled to
his right and just made it inside the goal line. Kris Brown kicked
the extra point for the 7-0 lead with 5:16 left in the first
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Brown added field goals of 18 and 28 yards in the first half.
Pittsburgh's other first-half TD came on Stewart's five-yard
scoring pass to running back Richard Huntley.
</P>
<P>
   In the second half, the Steelers kept up the pressure on both
sides of the football. On their first series, they went 76 yards on
14 plays. Huntley scored on a three-yard run. Brown's extra-point
attempt was blocked, leaving Pittsburgh with a 26-0 lead with 5:38
left in the third.
</P>
<P>
   After Brown kicked a 19-yard field goal to give Pittsburgh a
29-0 lead early in the fourth period, Stewart went to the bench and
was replaced by veteran backup Mike Tomczak.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't seem to matter who played quarterback for the Steelers
in this game. Even Mark Malone or Todd Blackledge could have put
points on the board against the overmatched Browns.
</P>
<P>
   After Brown's field goal, the Browns fumbled the kickoff at
their 21. On the first play, Tomczak threw a 21-yard scoring pass
to Huntley, who gained his third touchdown. Brown's extra point
made it 36-0.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, there was 10:38 left in the game. Quarterback Tim
Couch, the first pick in the draft, entered the game in place of
Detmer.
</P>
<P>
   Couch, the franchise quarterback, will remember his first pass
because it was intercepted by free safety Scott Shields. The
interception led to Tomczak's one-yard touchdown pass to receiver
Hines Ward with 6:28 left.
</P>
<P>
   And at that point, Cowher cleared his bench.

`ALLY' NO UNDERDOG; CABLE STEWS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVID KRONKE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Early on in the 51st Emmy ceremony,David E. Kelley
didn't seem to be having a particularly good time _ all he could
manage was a wan smile at David Spade's lame joke about his
presumably frantic work ethic.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley's mood had improved exponentially by evening's end,
however, as he had the last laugh. He managed an unprecedented feat
_ winning Emmys for both the Outstanding Drama and Outstanding
Comedy Series categories, for ``The Practice'' and ``Ally McBeal,''
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley's ``this is for all the underdogs'' acceptance speech was
a mite specious _ how can any network series that won the Emmy the
year before be considered an underdog? _ but it underscored the
assumption of many that HBO's ``The Sopranos'' was going to win the
Outstanding Drama Emmy. The fact that ``Sopranos'' came up short to
repeat network winners _ Outstanding Actor in a Drama nominee James
Gandolfini lost to ``NYPD Blue's'' four-time winner, Dennis Franz _
suggests that the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences isn't yet
prepared to honor, on a network TV broadcast, a non-network series.
Still, progress is slowly but surely being made: ``Sopranos'' did
win for writing, and the series's Edie Falco was named Outstanding
Actress in a Drama.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ally McBeal's'' win underscores the trend in TV comedy: There
are fewer half-hour sitcoms on the schedule this coming season, but
many hourlong, predominantly comic series. Such shows used to be
called ``dramedies'' until Brandon Tartikoff observed that just
meant a comedy that wasn't funny. But hourlong comedies allow
writers to develop richer, character-driven humor rather than
emphasize shtick. (Oddly enough, Kelley has gone in the other
direction and spun ``Ally McBeal'' off into a half-hour series this
season _ the way his luck is running, he'll be up against himself
at the Emmys next year.)
</P>
<P>
   The Emmys may be one of the few places one will see diversity on
TV this season. John Leguizamo, ``NYPD Blue'' director Paris
Barclay and ``The Chris Rock Show'' picked up trophies, and
African-American themed productions ``A Lesson Before Dying'' and
``The Temptations'' won major awards.
</P>
<P>
   And the hands-down most stirring moment of the evening came from
Robert Guillaume, who suffered a stroke nine months ago and whose
presence and brief speech about appreciating life was the lone
moment that didn't seem canned.
</P>
<P>
   It was a fairly briskly paced production, so let us muck up the
producers' efforts by observing that enforcing time limits on the
winners' acceptance speeches has clearly become problematic. Most
of the winners spent a couple of the precious few seconds they're
allowed referring to the time crunch, to the uniform detriment of
their speeches. Just let 'em talk, and let the Monday-morning
water-cooler deconstructors slag 'em if anyone's a blowhard
babbler.
</P>
<P>
   And how they do choose to spend those three hours can be awfully
head-scratching _ trotting out members of the World Wrestling
Federation to introduce accountants? An unfunny, multilingual
``Friends'' clip? The ``Felicity'' cast doing wan parodies of
``NYPD Blue,'' ``ER'' and ``The X-Files''; and the ``Dawson's
Creek'' and ``Entertainment Tonight'' casts riffing on the
``Felicity'' faux-teen writing scandal? (And people worry that
Fox's new series on Hollywood, ``Action,'' may be too inside?)
</P>
<P>
   All this, instead of giving viewers any idea what many of the
nominated shows had done to earn these plaudits. ``Very funny
clips,'' Garry Shandling deadpanned about the moments _ or virtual
lack of same _ shown from the nominees for Outstanding Writing for
a Comedy Series, underscoring how the ceremony fails to give
viewers any insight on what the nominated shows are like. This
doesn't give them a chance to sample the shows they don't watch but
may in fact enjoy. Another series of clips of highlights from the
past season didn't label the shows _ again, if you haven't seen the
show or telefilm before, how would you be able to seek it out?
</P>
<P>
   Clips of the nominees would be more instructive than the alleged
comic bits _ remember, even those nominated haven't seen all the
work of the other nominees.
</P>
<P>
   Other random observations:
</P>
<P>
   !bbox!David Hyde Pierce and Jenna Elfman proved an odd-couple
hosting choice. Pierce was admirably droll; Elfman didn't make much
of an impression. And who on earth talked them into that faintly
embarrassing interpretive-dance opening (itself a watery variation
on Billy Crystal's Oscar song medleys)?
</P>
<P>
   !bbox!Emmy voters showed less originality than most TV shows.
Helen Hunt won her fourth consecutive Emmy (a feat matched only by
John Larroquette in the Supporting Actor category from 1985 to
1988), Dennis Franz won his fourth Emmy, John Lithgow won his third
for ``3rd Rock from the Sun,'' and Kristen Johnston won her second
for the same show. (It does, however, say something about the
show's resilience that it can still cop trophies after NBC's
apparent attempts to kill off the show.)
</P>
<P>
   !bbox!Emmy voters managed some rare Solomon-like wisdom in
giving ``The Sopranos'' the trophy for writing and ``NYPD Blue''
the award for Paris Barclay's directing the episode in which Bobby
Simone died.
</P>
<P>
   !bbox!Emmy executive producer Don Mischer showed some brass by
running the hilariously nasty ``South Park'' tribute to fallen
stars _ or, at least, Kennys and Charlie Sheens _ near the top of
the show (and running the actual tribute that it parodied for the
last hour).
</P>
<P>
   !bbox!As usual, the funniest thing in the show were the fake
clips introducing the writing teams from the nominated variety
shows ``Late Night with Conan O'Brien'' (all victims from ``When
Animals Attack''), ``The Chris Rock Show'' (in a quixotic nod to
diversity, all sombrero-wearing African-Americans) and ``Late Show
with David Letterman'' (body bags dispatched by ``The Sopranos'').
</P>
<P>
   And what was director Louis J. Horvitz thinking, cutting away to
Calista Flockhart when Martin Short made a cosmetic surgery joke?

`ALLY' NO UNDERDOG; CABLE STEWS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVID KRONKE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Early on in the 51st Emmy ceremony,David E. Kelley
didn't seem to be having a particularly good time _ all he could
manage was a wan smile at David Spade's lame joke about his
presumably frantic work ethic.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley's mood had improved exponentially by evening's end,
however, as he had the last laugh. He managed an unprecedented feat
_ winning Emmys for both the Outstanding Drama and Outstanding
Comedy Series categories, for ``The Practice'' and ``Ally McBeal,''
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley's ``this is for all the underdogs'' acceptance speech was
a mite specious _ how can any network series that won the Emmy the
year before be considered an underdog? _ but it underscored the
assumption of many that HBO's ``The Sopranos'' was going to win the
Outstanding Drama Emmy. The fact that ``Sopranos'' came up short to
repeat network winners _ Outstanding Actor in a Drama nominee James
Gandolfini lost to ``NYPD Blue's'' four-time winner, Dennis Franz _
suggests that the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences isn't yet
prepared to honor, on a network TV broadcast, a non-network series.
Still, progress is slowly but surely being made: ``Sopranos'' did
win for writing, and the series's Edie Falco was named Outstanding
Actress in a Drama.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ally McBeal's'' win underscores the trend in TV comedy: There
are fewer half-hour sitcoms on the schedule this coming season, but
many hourlong, predominantly comic series. Such shows used to be
called ``dramedies'' until Brandon Tartikoff observed that just
meant a comedy that wasn't funny. But hourlong comedies allow
writers to develop richer, character-driven humor rather than
emphasize shtick. (Oddly enough, Kelley has gone in the other
direction and spun ``Ally McBeal'' off into a half-hour series this
season _ the way his luck is running, he'll be up against himself
at the Emmys next year.)
</P>
<P>
   The Emmys may be one of the few places one will see diversity on
TV this season. John Leguizamo, ``NYPD Blue'' director Paris
Barclay and ``The Chris Rock Show'' picked up trophies, and
African-American themed productions ``A Lesson Before Dying'' and
``The Temptations'' won major awards.
</P>
<P>
   And the hands-down most stirring moment of the evening came from
Robert Guillaume, who suffered a stroke nine months ago and whose
presence and brief speech about appreciating life was the lone
moment that didn't seem canned.
</P>
<P>
   It was a fairly briskly paced production, so let us muck up the
producers' efforts by observing that enforcing time limits on the
winners' acceptance speeches has clearly become problematic. Most
of the winners spent a couple of the precious few seconds they're
allowed referring to the time crunch, to the uniform detriment of
their speeches. Just let 'em talk, and let the Monday-morning
water-cooler deconstructors slag 'em if anyone's a blowhard
babbler.
</P>
<P>
   And how they do choose to spend those three hours can be awfully
head-scratching _ trotting out members of the World Wrestling
Federation to introduce accountants? An unfunny, multilingual
``Friends'' clip? The ``Felicity'' cast doing wan parodies of
``NYPD Blue,'' ``ER'' and ``The X-Files''; and the ``Dawson's
Creek'' and ``Entertainment Tonight'' casts riffing on the
``Felicity'' faux-teen writing scandal? (And people worry that
Fox's new series on Hollywood, ``Action,'' may be too inside?)
</P>
<P>
   All this, instead of giving viewers any idea what many of the
nominated shows had done to earn these plaudits. ``Very funny
clips,'' Garry Shandling deadpanned about the moments _ or virtual
lack of same _ shown from the nominees for Outstanding Writing for
a Comedy Series, underscoring how the ceremony fails to give
viewers any insight on what the nominated shows are like. This
doesn't give them a chance to sample the shows they don't watch but
may in fact enjoy. Another series of clips of highlights from the
past season didn't label the shows _ again, if you haven't seen the
show or telefilm before, how would you be able to seek it out?
</P>
<P>
   Clips of the nominees would be more instructive than the alleged
comic bits _ remember, even those nominated haven't seen all the
work of the other nominees.
</P>
<P>
   Other random observations:
</P>
<P>
   !bbox!David Hyde Pierce and Jenna Elfman proved an odd-couple
hosting choice. Pierce was admirably droll; Elfman didn't make much
of an impression. And who on earth talked them into that faintly
embarrassing interpretive-dance opening (itself a watery variation
on Billy Crystal's Oscar song medleys)?
</P>
<P>
   !bbox!Emmy voters showed less originality than most TV shows.
Helen Hunt won her fourth consecutive Emmy (a feat matched only by
John Larroquette in the Supporting Actor category from 1985 to
1988), Dennis Franz won his fourth Emmy, John Lithgow won his third
for ``3rd Rock from the Sun,'' and Kristen Johnston won her second
for the same show. (It does, however, say something about the
show's resilience that it can still cop trophies after NBC's
apparent attempts to kill off the show.)
</P>
<P>
   !bbox!Emmy voters managed some rare Solomon-like wisdom in
giving ``The Sopranos'' the trophy for writing and ``NYPD Blue''
the award for Paris Barclay's directing the episode in which Bobby
Simone died.
</P>
<P>
   !bbox!Emmy executive producer Don Mischer showed some brass by
running the hilariously nasty ``South Park'' tribute to fallen
stars _ or, at least, Kennys and Charlie Sheens _ near the top of
the show (and running the actual tribute that it parodied for the
last hour).
</P>
<P>
   !bbox!As usual, the funniest thing in the show were the fake
clips introducing the writing teams from the nominated variety
shows ``Late Night with Conan O'Brien'' (all victims from ``When
Animals Attack''), ``The Chris Rock Show'' (in a quixotic nod to
diversity, all sombrero-wearing African-Americans) and ``Late Show
with David Letterman'' (body bags dispatched by ``The Sopranos'').
</P>
<P>
   And what was director Louis J. Horvitz thinking, cutting away to
Calista Flockhart when Martin Short made a cosmetic surgery joke?

<P>
   East Timor does not amount to much: it is a tiny territory of
some 800,000 people coveted by Indonesia, a country of 200 million.
That is why the rest of the world has never been much bothered by
what happened there.
</P>
<P>
   But even tiny places can become significant. If the world fails
the East Timorese again, the consequences will be felt far beyond
the fringes of Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The body most immediately concerned is the United Nations. It
could hardly have prevented Indonesia from invading East Timor in
1975, after Portugal, the colonial power, had bolted _ though
America, which knew the invasion was coming and did nothing to stop
it, is far less blameless.
</P>
<P>
   Nor could the U.N. have stopped Indonesia from then annexing the
territory and embarking on a campaign of repression that was to
claim, directly or indirectly, some 200,000 lives.
</P>
<P>
   To its credit, moreover, the U.N. never recognized Indonesian
rule and when, last January, President B.J. Habibie surprisingly
offered the East Timorese a referendum, the U.N. organized it with
admirable efficiency: 98.6 percent of the eligible voters cast
their ballots on Aug. 30, and 78.5 percent of them opted for
independence.
</P>
<P>
   But now the territory is engulfed by violence, most of it
carried out by militias determined to frustrate the voters' clear
desire.
</P>
<P>
   Foremost responsibility for this, as for East Timor's earlier
suffering, is Indonesia's. But the U.N., having agreed to hold the
vote, and on Habibie's timetable, is now so involved that it too
will be guilty of a most terrible breach of trust if the East
Timorese are denied their independence, or gain it only after
another bloodbath.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, however, the U.N. is not an autonomous
organization whose boss has at his beck and call the troops needed
to impose law and order in unruly parts of the world. It is the
servant of its members, especially the five countries with
permanent seats on the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   Two of these, China and Russia, generally stand up for oppressed
peoples only when it suits their ideological or other interests.
But the three others, America, Britain and France, nowadays
proclaim nobler principles and, over Kosovo at least, have been
prepared to rain down bombs and rockets for them.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of persecution, the East Timorese have surely suffered
more than the Kosovars, and arguably the U.N.'s obligation to them
is more explicit.
</P>
<P>
   So where are the West's principles now? On hold, is the answer.
</P>
<P>
   Some countries, such as Australia and New Zealand, are ready to
provide peacekeepers. Australia well might since it has a
particularly guilty conscience about the East Timorese: though they
fought in the Second World War to help prevent a Japanese invasion
of Australia, the Australians _ ever nervous of their big neighbor
_ shamefully broke western ranks to recognize Indonesia's rule of
the annexed territory.
</P>
<P>
   But even Australia will not send in its forces without
permission from the Indonesian government. That is what must now be
extracted.
</P>
<P>
   No one wants to take on the Indonesian army, which is widely
accused of orchestrating the militias. And no one wants to
destabilize the world's fourth-biggest country, especially as it is
struggling to restore its economy and establish democracy.
</P>
<P>
   On the contrary, outsiders are anxious to help. But they should
do so only if the Indonesian government is sincere in what it says
it is doing _ and, to judge by its actions this week, it is not.
</P>
<P>
   Habibie may well have miscalculated in allowing the referendum:
he may have reckoned that the vote would go Indonesia's way.
Neither he nor anyone in the army should miscalculate again.
</P>
<P>
   They should be left in no doubt now that the world will not
allow Indonesia to hang on to East Timor, as it did in 1975. The
current mess is, after all, a direct consequence of that piece of
misguided realpolitik.
</P>
<P>
   Conceivably, diplomatic pressure alone could still work. It will
have a better chance of doing so if it does not all come from the
West.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia's Asian neighbors have a powerful interest in regional
peace. Some of them also say they resent the West's predominance on
the world stage. Why then don't they help to bring a little order
to their own neck of the woods by leaning on the powers-that-be in
Indonesia?
</P>
<P>
   The West, however, must also weigh in, making it plain that,
regardless of Indonesia's parlous economy, it will not lend money
to a country in which militias, with the connivance of the army,
make a bloodstained mockery of elections.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomacy, however, may not be enough. In that case, the U.N. _
meaning the Security Council _ will have to threaten, and be ready
to use, force, even without Indonesia's permission.
</P>
<P>
   If it does not, it is hard to see it being taken seriously in
such circumstances again. Rather it will be treated as an outfit
that merely organizes votes and then scuttles, leaving the local
thugs to seize control (as in Cambodia).
</P>
<P>
   That would hearten despots the world over, and dash the hopes of
millions in countries where the big powers have no direct interest.
Yet the big powers too would suffer.
</P>
<P>
   China, Russia and the West all stand to gain from an orderly
world. If the U.N. collapses in disrepute like the League of
Nations, the prospects of finding international solutions for
international problems _ such as the spread of weapons of mass
destruction _ will simply vanish.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps then those western countries that could not tolerate
mass murder in Kosovo will wonder why they could so readily
tolerate it in ``insignificant'' East Timor. &QL;

<P>
   Whatever happened to the Iraqi opposition? Last year, the
American Congress passed a law granting $97 million-worth of
military equipment to groups trying to topple Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   The government duly named seven factions worthy of such
largesse, and even persuaded them to coalesce into a newly
revitalized umbrella group, the Iraqi National Congress (INC).
</P>
<P>
   In February, the INC announced that its parliament-in-exile
would meet in April for the first time in seven years.
Inexplicably, the date slipped to July. July came and went without
a peep from the INC, not even a new date for a meeting.
</P>
<P>
   More embarrassing still, a scheme to hold the session in the
autonomous Kurdish areas of northern Iraq was abandoned when
America said it could not guarantee the safety of the participants.
</P>
<P>
   Not a penny of the $97 million has yet reached the opposition _
and when it does, America says, it will come in the form of office
supplies, not the arms that were promised.
</P>
<P>
   Some defiant INC members insist the meeting should nonetheless
go ahead in Kurdistan. But the local Kurdish authorities are
lukewarm. Even if the session is eventually held, events so far
show that America is not serious about helping the Iraqi
opposition. That, at least, is what INC figures say.
</P>
<P>
   n theory, of course, America would be delighted for the INC to
have a go at Hussein. But in practice the administration does not
think the group up to the task.
</P>
<P>
   A meeting in northern Iraq, or an attack launched from there,
might, the Americans fear, draw them into an ill-conceived and
embarrassing military adventure.
</P>
<P>
   The memory of 1996, when Hussein's troops overran the Kurdish
capital, Arbil, and wiped out both INC and CIA staff there, lingers
on. But whereas the American government has doubts about bold
initiatives, Congress chafes at inaction.
</P>
<P>
   Several Democrats have complained about the effects of nine
years of United Nations sanctions on Iraq and, in defiance of the
State Department, have sent representatives to Baghdad to
investigate. Others are concerned too.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials are frustrated because humanitarian aid is
hampered by bureaucratic delays by both America and Iraq. The pope
has expressed concern and promised a high-profile visit to Iraq
later this year.
</P>
<P>
   There are also those, including many in Congress, who want to
get tough with Hussein. The question is how. One idea is to start a
war-crimes investigation.
</P>
<P>
   But even as Austrian authorities were arresting a Serb suspect
last month, they were also playing host to Hussein's deputy, Izzat
Ibrahim al-Douri, before letting him go home safely to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   And would more military action be effective? America has
launched almost as many air raids against Iraq this year as were
launched against Serbia by NATO. &QL;

Kosovo were recently fished out of the turquoise waters off the
coast of Montenegro. Perhaps more than 100 had drowned when a boat
smuggling them to Italy _ for about $1,100 a head _ sank in a
summer storm.
</P>
<P>
   Though most were illiterate, they had hoped against the odds to
make a new life. There was certainly no going back. The Kosovo
Liberation Army, once NATO's bombs had made it top dog, ensured
that.
</P>
<P>
   Accusing Gypsies of collaborating with the Serbs (quite a lot
did), it had at least winked at a campaign of murder, torture,
beating and the burning of Gypsy neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Kosovo's ethnic Albanians seem delighted that most of
the province's Gypsies, maybe as many as 80,000 of them, have fled.
</P>
<P>
   But the stinking corpses lashed to the sun-soaked deck of a
coast guard boat are but the latest incident in a sorry saga of
persecution.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 6 million or so Gypsies (or Roma) in Europe, nearly
three-quarters live in the continent's center and east. Despite _
and partly because of _ the paternalistic efforts of governments,
most of them live in poverty-stricken dependence on welfare or
petty crime.
</P>
<P>
   A 19th-century French observer's description of them as
``Europe's negroes'' still holds. Gypsies were often enslaved and
lynched with impunity. A disproportionate number still end up in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   Many Gypsy children are virtually bereft of parents: in
Romania's wretched orphanages, three-quarters of the inhabitants
are Gypsies.
</P>
<P>
   Just to finish school is a feat. Like American blacks, Europe's
Gypsies often suffer instant discrimination based on the color of
their skin. They frequently complain of police harassment.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in many ways American blacks are far better off. They
have a large middle class, a measure of cultural unity and
self-awareness, a strong and sophisticated voice in politics, and
numerous role models of excellence.
</P>
<P>
   Gypsies have none of that. They remain much as they have always
been: Europe's phantom nation.
</P>
<P>
   Lobby groups fighting for the Gypsies say that education is the
key. Too often, Gypsy children are automatically put into
``remedial'' classes where they sink. Campaigners now demand
literacy classes for adults. They also want Gypsy history to be
taught to all children in countries with large Gypsy minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Public statements like those of Slovakia's former populist prime
minister, Vladimir Meciar, who described Gypsies as ``mental
retards,'' would not then go unchallenged.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, more Gypsies now want gadje (as they call other
people) to acknowledge centuries of racism and slavery (Gypsies
were still being bought and sold in the Balkans in the 1860s) that
culminated in the Holocaust, which Gypsies call Porrajmos, meaning
``the devouring.''
</P>
<P>
   Some historians now reckon that as many as 1 million may then
have been swallowed up, along with the Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Recent research, some of it by Gypsy scholars, is now pointing
up previously unnoticed horror-details: how, for instance, Josef
Mengele, the Nazi doctor who experimented on concentration-camp
victims, liked to put out Gypsy children's eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Most Gypsies, however, never got as far as the camps: local
police, sparing the Nazis the trouble of transport and gas, shot
them.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech accepting the Nobel peace prize in 1986, Elie
Wiesel, the Jewish campaigner for Holocaust victims, asked the
Gypsies' forgiveness for ``not listening to your story.'' No Gypsy
was asked to testify at the Nuremberg war-crimes trials.
</P>
<P>
   Western governments made scant effort to help Gypsy survivors of
the Holocaust. Early Holocaust museums virtually ignored their
plight. Wiesel, among others, has helped change that.
</P>
<P>
   More Gypsies are beginning to lay claim to their own history,
holding a string of memorial services across Europe and North
America in August to commemorate the month when several thousand of
them had been sent to their deaths at Auschwitz.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, says a leading Gypsy campaigner, his people
scarcely spoke of the Holocaust at all. ``Jews said, Never forget.
We said, Never remember.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, belatedly but urgently, Gypsy groups are seeking collective
compensation for the Holocaust. It will be hard. Gypsies, unlike
many Jewish families, much of whose property and bank accounts
should be traceable, tend to lack documentation for what few assets
they had. Even where it exists, they invariably lack the political
and financial clout to press their claims.
</P>
<P>
   Still, eagerness to join the European Union has made several
Central European countries much readier to listen to Gypsy
grievances. Local councils have begun to appoint Gypsy liaison
officers.
</P>
<P>
   For every company that discriminates against Gypsies, others are
trying out job preferment. One big Czech shop that has hired Gypsy
security guards has found that theft has dropped sharply. And
charities have sprung up in Hungary, the Czech Republic and
Slovakia to help Gypsies with housing loans, literacy classes and
summer camps for children.
</P>
<P>
   A Palestinian writer, Edward Said, once said that Gypsies were
the only group about which anything could be said ``without
challenge or demurral.'' No more. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   In America's presidential system, calls for the resignation of
top politicians are rare. Even during that most shameful of
episodes, the Lewinsky affair, comparatively few politicians echoed
The Economist's cry that Bill Clinton should go.
</P>
<P>
   So when members of Congress demand the resignation of the
attorney-general, Janet Reno, three times on three different
charges in two years _ most recently the new revelations about the
siege at Waco, Texas, in 1993 _ it is clear that something is
rotten in the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   Is it just Reno herself? Conservatives would say so. The longest
serving attorney-general since the days of John Quincy Adams, she
has had more than her fair share of misjudgments.
</P>
<P>
   She came to Washington in 1993 as a little-known state attorney
from Florida, with a reputation for running an enlightened and
effective anti-drug policy but no political backing in Congress or
even in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   She won a good deal of public credit for her willingness, in
April 1993, to be held accountable for the disastrous operation at
Waco.
</P>
<P>
   Much of this has disappeared with her claims, in the past few
weeks, that she knew neither exactly what the FBI was doing at Waco
nor how flagrantly it lied about it afterwards.
</P>
<P>
   On other matters, the accusations against her are less
clear-cut. She was asked by the FBI to authorize a wire tap on Wen
Ho Lee, a scientist at the center of Chinese spying allegations.
She refused.
</P>
<P>
   She refused again when Republicans asked her to appoint an
independent counsel to investigate allegations of campaign-finance
abuses by both President Bill Clinton and Vice-President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   On both occasions, her actions, though controversial, were
legally defensible. She demanded more prima facie evidence of
wrongdoing than her critics thought necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Such conflicts suggest there is more to Ms. Reno's troubles than
personal error. In both cases, her legal judgment collided with
political opinion and failed to satisfy it.
</P>
<P>
   That tension between the law and politics is intrinsic to her
job. But recently public and congressional demands upon her have
risen so much that it is becoming harder and harder for Ms. Reno _
or anyone else _ to satisfy both parts of the attorney-general's
brief.
</P>
<P>
   The 1789 Judiciary Act requires the president to appoint a
person ``learned in the law'' to advise him on legal matters. Like
any lawyer, therefore, the attorney-general must serve two masters
_ the president and the law.
</P>
<P>
   When the two come into conflict, the only way to resolve it is
for the attorney-general to leave office and trust to the public to
force the president to obey the law.
</P>
<P>
   That is exactly what happened in the ``Saturday night massacre''
of 1973, when Richard Nixon kept on firing attorneys-general until
he found one willing to get rid of the Justice Department
prosecutor who was investigating the Watergate affair.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Reno, in other words, is not the first to run into this
dilemma. She is unusual in the number and complexity of the
conflicts that beset her. But there is an institutional as well as
a personal explanation for that.
</P>
<P>
   For many years, the tension inherent in her post was muted
because few people thought it was the main job of the
attorney-general to investigate the government. John F. Kennedy
even appointed his brother as attorney-general.
</P>
<P>
   Watergate changed both the attorney-general's job and the way it
was perceived by the public _ in diametrically opposing ways.
</P>
<P>
   The scandal led Congress to pass the independent counsel law.
This said that, when any of 49 top officials was alleged to have
committed a crime, the attorney-general could name an independent
counsel to investigate.
</P>
<P>
   In practice, this meant setting up miniature departments of
justice, independent of the attorney-general, whenever there was a
problem. The law lapsed in July _ but not before it had done much
to erode the attorney-general's power and accountability.
</P>
<P>
   Watergate also led to the establishment of inspectors-general in
federal agencies to audit and investigate them. The inspectors
report to Congress, which means that they too serve two masters
while simultaneously competing with the attorney-general.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, at the same time, Watergate gave the public a sense that
the attorney-general ought to have more political independence.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Reno herself is a perfect expression of that expectation.
She has been almost ostentatiously independent of the president,
but her greater independence is a matter of public attitude only.
There is no constitutional or legal mandate for it.
</P>
<P>
   The weaknesses of this arrangement _ the attorney-general is
expected to do more but has fewer powers _ have been ruthlessly
exposed by the so-called ``criminalization of politics.''
</P>
<P>
   This does not refer to any increase in the tendency of criminals
to become politicians, or vice versa. It refers to the recent
practice of using allegations of wrongdoing as weapons in what are
political, not legal, battles.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Henry Cisneros pleaded guilty to charges of not
telling the FBI how much he was paying his admitted mistress before
he became Clinton's first housing secretary.
</P>
<P>
   No one has pretended that his affair had any relevance to his
ability to do his job. There have been dozens of other such
investigations, most notably Kenneth Starr's. Few have discovered
irrefutable cases of corruption or illegality.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Reno is the central figure in this pursuit of politics by
other means. Her department must investigate the allegations or
recommend a special prosecutor (it seems about to choose a
respected former Republican senator, John Danforth, to look into
Waco).
</P>
<P>
   Her personal integrity has made her all the more willing to
appoint special prosecutors (when she was a lawyer in Miami, she
called in a special prosecutor to investigate drunk-driving charges
against her own mother). But because the arguments are at root
political ones, legal processes can never resolve them fully.
</P>
<P>
   This is a far cry from the usual charge against Ms. Reno: that
she has abused her office to protect the president. Of that, she is
almost certainly innocent.
</P>
<P>
   She may have been guilty of bad management in the Waco
operation: Danforth's investigation should settle that. But what is
certain is that she has been unable to stop something much more
corrosive: the use of her office by others to fight their political
battles. &QL;

justice, independent of the attorney-general, whenever there was a
problem. The law lapsed in July _ but not before it had done much
to erode the attorney-general's power and accountability.
</P>
<P>
   Watergate also led to the establishment of inspectors-general in
federal agencies to audit and investigate them. The inspectors
report to Congress, which means that they too serve two masters
while simultaneously competing with the attorney-general.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, at the same time, Watergate gave the public a sense that
the attorney-general ought to have more political independence.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Reno herself is a perfect expression of that expectation.
She has been almost ostentatiously independent of the president,
but her greater independence is a matter of public attitude only.
There is no constitutional or legal mandate for it.
</P>
<P>
   The weaknesses of this arrangement _ the attorney-general is
expected to do more but has fewer powers _ have been ruthlessly
exposed by the so-called ``criminalization of politics.''
</P>
<P>
   This does not refer to any increase in the tendency of criminals
to become politicians, or vice versa. It refers to the recent
practice of using allegations of wrongdoing as weapons in what are
political, not legal, battles.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Henry Cisneros pleaded guilty to charges of not
telling the FBI how much he was paying his admitted mistress before
he became Clinton's first housing secretary.
</P>
<P>
   No one has pretended that his affair had any relevance to his
ability to do his job. There have been dozens of other such
investigations, most notably Kenneth Starr's. Few have discovered
irrefutable cases of corruption or illegality.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Reno is the central figure in this pursuit of politics by
other means. Her department must investigate the allegations or
recommend a special prosecutor (it seems about to choose a
respected former Republican senator, John Danforth, to look into
Waco).
</P>
<P>
   Her personal integrity has made her all the more willing to
appoint special prosecutors (when she was a lawyer in Miami, she
called in a special prosecutor to investigate drunk-driving charges
against her own mother). But because the arguments are at root
political ones, legal processes can never resolve them fully.
</P>
<P>
   This is a far cry from the usual charge against Ms. Reno: that
she has abused her office to protect the president. Of that, she is
almost certainly innocent.
</P>
<P>
   She may have been guilty of bad management in the Waco
operation: Danforth's investigation should settle that. But what is
certain is that she has been unable to stop something much more
corrosive: the use of her office by others to fight their political
battles. &QL;

   SALT LAKE CITY _ Tornadoes are almost unheard of in Salt Lake
City, but in August one struck right in the middle of the Outdoor
Retailers Summer Market.
</P>
<P>
   It was the talk of the show _ until, that is, the sellers of
camping gear and climbing boots began to consider their other
problems. Not all of these are immediately apparent.
</P>
<P>
   Demand for goods for hiking, camping, mountaineering and the
like remains strong, with sales worth about $5.5 billion a year.
The green inclinations of baby-boomers, their growing spending
power and their yen to turn vacations into something between a
forced march and a spiritual retreat, have been the making of an
industry that barely existed 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Backpacks at $400, hiking boots at $250, seaworthy kayaks at
$2,000, are all snapped up.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, says Lee Fromson, a vice-president with Cascade
Designs in Seattle which specializes in outside sleeping equipment,
anyone getting into this sector could expect their business to grow
by 20 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   But times are changing. For many outdoor-gear sellers, sales are
flat _ or worse.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, baby-boomers are getting older. They are no longer
so eager to tote a 50-pound pack for a week in the Tetons, nor
hoist themselves up icy Mount Rainier in Microsoft's backyard (Al
Gore's recent ascent of that peak notwithstanding).
</P>
<P>
   Many sellers of the ponderous recreational vehicles seen
lumbering down the interstates during the summer now report that
their fastest-growing market consists of people between 35 and 50
who have finally hung up their boots.
</P>
<P>
   The makers of outdoor equipment are aging, too, and find it hard
to fathom what younger people want.
</P>
<P>
   There are other challenges. At the Salt Lake City show, there
was hardly a black or brown face in sight: outdoor sport remains a
white enclave, meaning that makers of outdoor equipment are simply
ignored by a huge and growing portion of the population.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is proving a formidable competitor, not only
because most outdoor-gear makers run small businesses that lack the
know-how or financing to launch websites, but because surfing the
Net takes up leisure time that used to be spent hiking or biking.
</P>
<P>
   Even the strong economy works against the outdoors industry,
which has found that people who hike in Montana in hard times would
rather lounge in Italy once they have money.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some in the industry are optimistic. Certain activities,
notably kayaking and rock climbing, are proving popular with young
enthusiasts and are showing strong sales growth.
</P>
<P>
   Several large clothing and investment companies are snapping up
distressed outdoor-gear makers with strong brand names and applying
up-to-date stock-keeping, manufacturing and marketing techniques.
</P>
<P>
   And there is hope that today's teenagers, many of whom are
fanatically green, will adopt the hobbies that their parents once
embraced. Until then, equipment makers can only pray that their
latest ultra-light tent or load-lightening pack will put some
spring into the steps of grey-haired hikers _ and dollars into
tills. &QL;

<P>
   TUNICA, MISS. _ What a shame Elvis did not live to see it.
Thirty miles from Graceland a new Las Vegas has sprouted in the
Delta, and lights blaze along the Mississippi River.
</P>
<P>
   Times have certainly changed. In 1990, Tunica County was
officially listed by the Census Bureau as the poorest county in the
United States, a place famous mostly for open-ditch sewers and
clapped-out cars rusting in cotton fields.
</P>
<P>
   Now thousands of visitors descend every day, and think it
heaven. Last year, Tunica's casinos grossed a record $2 billion in
gaming revenues. Taxes on that revenue generated more than $126
million for the county between December 1992 and the end of 1998,
and sales taxes rose by $213.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   The state of Mississippi, which takes 8 percent of the casinos'
gross revenues, received more than $250 million in taxes.
Unemployment is almost nonexistent in Tunica, and income per head
has tripled.
</P>
<P>
   Once, the key to prosperity was to leave the South for the
north. Now the flow has reversed. Casino workers from Chicago,
Atlantic City and even abroad descend on the Delta to deal cards
and serve drinks in gambling dens built to resemble Irish castles
or Southern antebellum mansions.
</P>
<P>
   Tunica is now the fifth most profitable gambling area in the
country, outranked only by the Las Vegas Strip, Atlantic City, the
Foxwoods complex in Connecticut and a clutch of casinos close to
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Mississippi legalized casino gambling in 1992. As in several
other states, the legislation required the casinos to float on
water.
</P>
<P>
   But whereas the other states allowed gambling only on
riverboats, Mississippi added an ingenious loophole that let
gambling halls be constructed on barges that float in moats. This
means that casinos can spring up further away from rivers, and with
giant fountains playing on every side.
</P>
<P>
   When the casinos first opened, visitors had a choice of 20
hotels in all of Tunica County. Today there are more than 6,000
hotel rooms, and on most nights most of them are filled. The
31-story Gold Strike Casino Hotel is the tallest building in the
state.
</P>
<P>
   Although most visitors still arrive by bus, the tiny airport is
being upgraded with a $32 million extension to the runway.
</P>
<P>
   Casinos in Tunica, as in most places, are keen to lure families
to stay an extra day and spend their winnings at golf courses,
amusement parks and theatres. The next wave of development is
therefore in this direction.
</P>
<P>
   The newly opened Isle of Capri casino plans to build two Wayne
Newton theatres, where the ex-lounge lizard and Las Vegas superstar
will perform several nights each year.
</P>
<P>
   And it is not just classic Vegas names that jet into Tunica now.
Duran Duran (to be slightly more up-to-date) recently played to a
sellout crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Only the neighbors are sulking. Last year, fewer tourists than
usual went to Beale Street in Memphis, Tenn., one of the
birthplaces of the blues, and this was widely blamed on the fact
that nearby Tunica is awash in cheap liquor and discounted motel
rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Memphis's Hard Rock Cafe, which opened only a year ago, no
longer even offers live music, citing tough competition from Tunica
to lure popular bands.
</P>
<P>
   And Tunica is only just starting to dream about the extravagant
things it can do. This summer, the city began constructing an $18.5
million exhibition center, covering 132,000 square feet (12,260
square meters), for trade shows, rodeos, car shows, concerts,
banquets, tractor-pulls and other attractions.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, when Mississippi was fighting the demonic aspects
of high-stakes gambling in its state legislature, no one could have
foreseen the impact the industry would have on the poorest part of
the state.
</P>
<P>
   Now, seven years later, there are few doubters left. Like it or
not, Tunica was sick of being poor. With wise investment, it hopes
it will never go hungry again. &QL;

   TUNICA, MISS. _ What a shame Elvis did not live to see it.
Thirty miles from Graceland a new Las Vegas has sprouted in the
Delta, and lights blaze along the Mississippi River.
</P>
<P>
   Times have certainly changed. In 1990, Tunica County was
officially listed by the Census Bureau as the poorest county in the
United States, a place famous mostly for open-ditch sewers and
clapped-out cars rusting in cotton fields.
</P>
<P>
   Now thousands of visitors descend every day, and think it
heaven. Last year, Tunica's casinos grossed a record $2 billion in
gaming revenues. Taxes on that revenue generated more than $126
million for the county between December 1992 and the end of 1998,
and sales taxes rose by $213.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   The state of Mississippi, which takes 8 percent of the casinos'
gross revenues, received more than $250 million in taxes.
Unemployment is almost nonexistent in Tunica, and income per head
has tripled.
</P>
<P>
   Once, the key to prosperity was to leave the South for the
north. Now the flow has reversed. Casino workers from Chicago,
Atlantic City and even abroad descend on the Delta to deal cards
and serve drinks in gambling dens built to resemble Irish castles
or Southern antebellum mansions.
</P>
<P>
   Tunica is now the fifth most profitable gambling area in the
country, outranked only by the Las Vegas Strip, Atlantic City, the
Foxwoods complex in Connecticut and a clutch of casinos close to
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Mississippi legalized casino gambling in 1992. As in several
other states, the legislation required the casinos to float on
water.
</P>
<P>
   But whereas the other states allowed gambling only on
riverboats, Mississippi added an ingenious loophole that let
gambling halls be constructed on barges that float in moats. This
means that casinos can spring up further away from rivers, and with
giant fountains playing on every side.
</P>
<P>
   When the casinos first opened, visitors had a choice of 20
hotels in all of Tunica County. Today there are more than 6,000
hotel rooms, and on most nights most of them are filled. The
31-story Gold Strike Casino Hotel is the tallest building in the
state.
</P>
<P>
   Although most visitors still arrive by bus, the tiny airport is
being upgraded with a $32 million extension to the runway.
</P>
<P>
   Casinos in Tunica, as in most places, are keen to lure families
to stay an extra day and spend their winnings at golf courses,
amusement parks and theatres. The next wave of development is
therefore in this direction.
</P>
<P>
   The newly opened Isle of Capri casino plans to build two Wayne
Newton theatres, where the ex-lounge lizard and Las Vegas superstar
will perform several nights each year.
</P>
<P>
   And it is not just classic Vegas names that jet into Tunica now.
Duran Duran (to be slightly more up-to-date) recently played to a
sellout crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Only the neighbors are sulking. Last year, fewer tourists than
usual went to Beale Street in Memphis, Tenn., one of the
birthplaces of the blues, and this was widely blamed on the fact
that nearby Tunica is awash in cheap liquor and discounted motel
rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Memphis's Hard Rock Cafe, which opened only a year ago, no
longer even offers live music, citing tough competition from Tunica
to lure popular bands.
</P>
<P>
   And Tunica is only just starting to dream about the extravagant
things it can do. This summer, the city began constructing an $18.5
million exhibition center, covering 132,000 square feet (12,260
square meters), for trade shows, rodeos, car shows, concerts,
banquets, tractor-pulls and other attractions.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, when Mississippi was fighting the demonic aspects
of high-stakes gambling in its state legislature, no one could have
foreseen the impact the industry would have on the poorest part of
the state.
</P>
<P>
   Now, seven years later, there are few doubters left. Like it or
not, Tunica was sick of being poor. With wise investment, it hopes
it will never go hungry again. &QL;

FAMILIAR FACES TAKE TOP ACTING AWARDS, BUT THERE'S A NEW KING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY VALERIE KUKLENSKI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The 51st annual Emmy Awards on Sunday night belong
to David E. Kelley _ the critics' favorite claimed top Drama Series
for ABC's ``The Practice'' and best Comedy Series for Fox's ``Ally
McBeal.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelley, the hands-on head writer and executive producer for both
shows, was stunned by the back-to-back honors, the ninth and 10th
Emmys of his career. It was the first time a producer has won both
categories the same year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you can see from the looks on our faces we're a little
surprised, but we'll take it,'' Kelley said, accepting the second
consecutive drama Emmy for ``The Practice.'' Then in a variation on
Camryn Manheim's speech last year, he added, ``This is for all the
underdogs,'' referring to beating out the favorite, HBO's ``The
Sopranos.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, seconds later, when ``Ally McBeal'' won, Kelley was back.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said backstage you gotta go back up, and I thought there
had been a mistake (and that) `The Sopranos' won best drama.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelley apparently was not alone in that perception.
</P>
<P>
   HBO, however, scored well overall, taking the most of any
network _ seven awards Sunday and 23 overall, including those from
earlier ceremonies. NBC won a total of 17, ABC 13, CBS 11, Fox 7,
A&AMP;E 5, PBS 4, WB 2, UPN 2 and Showtime 1.
</P>
<P>
   But the humor-tinged mob drama ``The Sopranos'' won only two of
Sunday's categories: lead actress in a drama series for Edie Falco
and writing for its ``College'' episode, by James Manos Jr. and
David Chase. It won two others in the pretelecast event.
</P>
<P>
   The series, which led with 16 nominations, was a critical hit
and a personal viewing favorite of many in the industry. In fact,
Falco drew one of the loudest ovations of the evening.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the 51st awards echoed past ceremonies. In
addition to ``The Practice,'' repeat winners included Helen Hunt of
``Mad About You,'' Dennis Franz of ``NYPD Blue,'' David Hyde Pierce
of ``Frasier,'' and John Lithgow and Kristen Johnston of ``3rd Rock
From the Sun.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Practice'' also took both supporting acting honors among
drama series.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Badalucco, who plays the insecure Jimmy, claimed the
supporting actor honor, topping co-star Steve Harris as well as
Benjamin Bratt and Steven Hill on ``Law &AMP; Order'' and Noah Wyle of
``ER.''
</P>
<P>
   Badalucco said later he has had very little experience accepting
such awards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a bowling trophy back in Brooklyn but that's it,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Holland Taylor's sex-starved judge character in ``The Practice''
took best supporting actress in a drama, beating out co-stars Lara
Flynn Boyle and Manheim as well as Kim Delaney of ``NYPD Blue'' and
Nancy Marchand of ``The Sopranos.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Overnight!'' the veteran actress said.
</P>
<P>
   Kristen Johnston picked up her second Emmy in her third
nomination for Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series, playing Sally
Solomon on ``3rd Rock From the Sun.''
</P>
<P>
   She choked up a bit on stage when thanking Lithgow for holding
everything together, explaining later that he was a unifying force
when the show struggled through NBC management changes and
time-period moves.
</P>
<P>
   David Hyde Pierce collected his third statuette as the fussy
Niles Crane on ``Frasier.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The greatest honor the academy has ever given me is to put me
in a category with John Mahoney,'' he said, referring to the
co-star who plays his father.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 Tony Awards brought special honors to the Miller family
as father Walter picked up the variety, comedy or music special
prize as its producer, following son Paul's win as best director in
the same category.
</P>
<P>
   (EDITORS, STORY CONTINUES ON SECOND TAKE)
</P>
<P>
   The pilot of comedy ``Sports Night'' won the directing award for
Thomas Schlamme.
</P>
<P>
   John Leguizamo won the first Emmy of his career for his comedy
special, ``John Leguizamo's Freak.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody can write a one-man show,'' he said. ``All you need is
one year, a paper and pen and a messed-up life.''
</P>
<P>
   HBO's ``The Chris Rock Show'' took outstanding writing for a
variety or comedy show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Conan (O'Brien) has the best show. I do 13, but he does a
hundred,'' Rock said. ``Conan, you should have got it, but I'm
going to take it.''
</P>
<P>
   The tearful ``NYPD Blue'' episode dealing with Bobby Simone's
death brought the drama series directing award for Paris Barclay,
his second in as many years.
</P>
<P>
   Barclay told reporters that directing the emotional episode was
a wrenching experience for everyone involved. He watched the scenes
from a distant monitor because he was sobbing.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Jimmy (Smits) laid down in that bed he was so
believable,'' he said. ``When you look at Kim Delaney, she wasn't
acting.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A Lesson Before Dying'' on HBO was awarded best writing of a
movie or miniseries for Ann Peacock.
</P>
<P>
   For the second year running ``The Late Show With David
Letterman'' on CBS took the prize for top variety, music or comedy
series, winning over its ratings nemesis, ``The Tonight Show With
Jay Leno.''
</P>
<P>
   Helen Mirren, playing the title role in ``The Passion of Ayn
Rand,'' won the Emmy for best actress in a movie or miniseries, her
second award.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels great, it feels shamefully wonderful,'' she said
backstage.
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;E broke into a realm long dominated by the broadcast networks
and pay cable, winning outstanding miniseries for ``Horatio
Hornblower.'' It topped ``Joan of Arc on CBS,'' ``The Temptations''
and ``The '60s'' on NBC and ``Great Expectations'' on PBS.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley Tucci was surprised to win best actor in a movie or
miniseries as the title character in HBO's ``Winchell.'' His rivals
in the category were Don Cheadle in ``A Lesson Before Dying,'' Ian
Holm in ``King Lear,'' ``Jack Lemmon in ``Inherit the Wind,'' and
Sam Shephard in ``Dash and Lilly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you very much _ you've made a huge mistake,'' Tucci
said.
</P>
<P>
   Hunt won her fourth consecutive Emmy, a record for a performer
in a leading role.
</P>
<P>
   With ``Mad About You'' now off the air,' Hunt paid tribute to
her co-star, Paul Reiser.
</P>
<P>
   ``How will I ever find someone to act with who I trust and love
so much,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Lithgow won his third award as Dr. Dick Solomon, his fourth Emmy
ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't know how I won this,'' Lithgow said. ``As far
as I can tell every actor in this town thinks what I do on `3rd
Rock' is disgraceful. You saw it tonight. `Good for yoooo,''' he
said in his over-the-top style.
</P>
<P>
   Franz was a surprise winner in the drama series best actor
category. It was his fourth win as Andy Sipowicz, and he was
surprised to have beat co-star Smits, whose death scenes dragged
out over several episodes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was feeling pretty comfortable down there because I was sure
I wasn't going to have to get up and say anything. I was sure Jimmy
was,'' he said.

MORE `CROCHETY' ELDERS THAN EVER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MAUREEN WEST  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   One woman called 911 and demanded that someone come make her
coffee when her family didn't show up fast enough.
</P>
<P>
   Others call their adult children 40 or 50 times a day, asking
for everything from a back rub to help changing a light bulb.
</P>
<P>
   In nursing homes, they hit the call button every five minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Call them difficult, crotchety or just plain cranky _ they are
the highly vocal minority of elderly people formally described as
``high maintenance.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, they rode the porch rocker and yelled at passing
kids, or tormented long-suffering daughters-in-law in the privacy
of the family home.
</P>
<P>
   Today, social-service workers say, difficult older people are
growing in number, living longer and are increasingly separated
from their families.
</P>
<P>
   The result: They now rely on public caregivers, who seem no more
capable of pleasing them than were their daughters-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a bigger population of older people, including older
people with long-term disabilities, those who have had
mood-altering strokes and serious personality disorders that
intensify as they grow older,'' said Dr. Pam Willson, a Phoenix
area neuropsychologist.
</P>
<P>
   She and her husband, geropsychologist Gary Martin, say most of
their elderly patients are well-adjusted and easy to work with. A
quarter or a third of them, however, are ``difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Willson and Martin say they may account for less than 1 percent
of elders. Other caregivers say there are more, though their
``degree of difficulty'' varies.
</P>
<P>
   Gloria Davenport of Orange County, Calif., has even published a
new book on them. In`` Working with Toxic Older Adults,'' Davenport
estimates that 3 percent to 5 percent of those in their 80s or
older may be ``toxic'' _ not only to themselves but also to those
who try to help.
</P>
<P>
   These are not people who can be helped by medications, she said.
Some may have always had character disorders, but they were fine
when they lived on their own.
</P>
<P>
   Now they need help, and no one can please them.
</P>
<P>
   Learning to deal with overly demanding elders is uncharted
territory for some in the social services profession, Davenport
said. However, with the aging of 76 million baby boomers _ already
with a reputation for being somewhat demanding _ the territory is
likely to become well-traveled.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Lacey of the Maricopa County Area Agency on Aging said
extremely difficult elders may only make up 5 percent of the agency
ombudsmen's clientele _ but could easily take up 20 percent of
their time.
</P>
<P>
   The most irascible of this group call firefighters, police or
other community agencies every day, Dawn Savattone of the county
aging agency said. They are well known in emergency rooms and on
the ``do not service'' lists of home health care agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``If all the social workers in the city got together and we
started comparing names, I guarantee you that we would all know
them,'' Savattone said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They burn out every social service agency in town,'' said Bob
Peck, program manager for Adult Protective Services. Of the 300
calls APS gets each month, only about 10 fall into this category,
Peck said.
</P>
<P>
   Willson said, ``I don't think that there has been any organized
recognition of these folks and their problems. They are growing
enough in numbers that we have to deal with them in different
ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Often, ``high maintenance'' elders see the friction as someone
else's fault. They commonly register four or five complaints at a
time, and often threaten to sue.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you first call on them, you are a saint,'' Savattone
said. ``But eventually you fall off the pedestal and become another
of the enemy.''
</P>
<P>
   Some difficult elders say all they want is to be left alone in
their own home, Savattone said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But as soon as all the arrangements are made, they sabotage
them. They may fire home health aides, cancel meal deliveries and
not take their medications,'' she said. ``So they end up exactly
where they were _ surrounded by people trying to meet their needs.
I think they self-sabotage things because being left alone is their
worst nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   Most social service workers also caution that crankiness is not
an automatic part of old age.
</P>
<P>
   ``People of any age who are forced by circumstances to become
more dependent on others or on `the system,' can feel frustrated or
frightened,'' Willson said. ``If their coping ability was poor
beforehand, you can see real problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Davenport makes a clear distinction between ``toxic elders'' and
older people who simply need a lot of care. She said people serving
the former feel emotionally drained after being around them. Some
family members are driven to depression and sometimes nearly to
suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Davenport said her research found that many of the most
difficult people had been teachers, preachers, psychologists,
business owners, executives or others who had held positions of
power and control.
</P>
<P>
   When that erodes with age, she said, they may turn up the volume
of their demands, ``fearfully lashing out like children to maintain
control.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not all complaints are without merit, caregivers
quickly note. There is much to complain about as social service
budgets continue to shrink in Arizona. Sometimes, all a person can
do is fight for the services they need, and sometimes it works.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, however, the demands become counterproductive,
leading to abandonment or shuffling by the social-service
community.
</P>
<P>
   Catherine McCormick, 75, is developing a reputation that would
make her difficult to place in a nursing home - which is fine with
her.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Difficult and demanding' _ those are words I hear over and
over again,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She believes she gets a bad rap. She says that paid caregivers
sent to her have already been told that she is demanding, so that's
what they see.
</P>
<P>
   McCormick and another senior, James Berryman, were good-natured
enough to be interviewed and photographed for this article to
defend older people they say are unfairly called ``difficult and
demanding.'' According to Berryman, they are simply trying to
better their lives and those of others.
</P>
<P>
   By her own estimate, McCormick has had more than 300 caregivers
in her 27 years as a disabled arthritic. She has been fighting
Maricopa County Managed Care to stay in her home since 1994. Being
difficult _ if it is a strategy _ is so far working to keep her on
her own.
</P>
<P>
   She vows to die in her own home, with hospice at her bedside
when she is ready.
</P>
<P>
   Still, McCormick said she really doesn't understand all the
fuss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very polite,'' she said, ``and I expect the people who
are paid to take care of me to do their jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   A former counselor for the blind, McCormick said the underlying
problem is that there are no comprehensive care programs for
disabled elderly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who should be my advocates are my adversaries,''
she said. ``When you are helpless, they move in on you like a pack
of dogs.''
</P>
<P>
   Medical advances and the availability of home services have made
it possible for people like McCormick to live at home, despite
severe problems like diabetes, emphysema or coronary disease,
according to Willson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before, they may not have survived some strokes. Now they
survive, but may not be the same person,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Willson said she recently told one daughter that she would
probably never make her mother happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can make your mom relatively comfortable, that's the
best you can do,'' Willson recalls telling her.
</P>
<P>
   James Berryman is not too comfortable, even though he's bounced
around to dozens of nursing homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm known everywhere,'' said Berryman, 61, who says he has
been in nearly every nursing home in Phoenix during the past 27
years, following a construction accident in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   He has filed complaints about nursing home care to the
Department of Health Services, the Attorney General's Office and
the Maricopa County Ombudsmen.
</P>
<P>
   He sees himself as a nursing home whistle-blower, and figures
his reputation among nursing home administrators is: `` `He will
call the state on you in a minute.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Once, he said, he was bounced from a nursing home for speaking
ill of an administrator, not knowing she was within hearing
distance. Another time he got caught at a Christian nursing home
with a wine cooler in his pillowcase.
</P>
<P>
   Some difficult seniors call fire stations. Each Phoenix fire
station reports about two regular callers, often elderly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it overburdening the system? Not right now,'' Division
Chief Bob Khan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some are just looking for company _ they are so glad to see
you,'' Khan said. ``Others might call just because they are having
a bad day. When you got there, however, they might tell you that
it's none of your business.''
</P>
<P>
   One former regular _ a Romeo of the Westward Ho _ would have
asthma attacks in front of his paramours. Then, when he was asked
if he needed help, he would say ``she will take care of me.''
</P>
<P>
   About 20 to 25 percent of the 20 calls the Fire Department makes
each month to Westward Ho in downtown Phoenix are from people who
are lonely or aren't able to articulate exactly what they need.
</P>
<P>
   Khan calls them ``social calls.'' The same percentage would hold
true of other visits to seniors' homes or complexes, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may never be able to `fix it.''' he said. ``But we need to
adapt to make changes in the system so they have someone to call
besides 911.'' &QL;

LIGHT-RAIL LEADS RAPID TRANSIT ALTERNATIVES IN PHOENIX AREA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY JO PITZL  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ While backers ready more details for a Phoenix-area
light-rail train, other folks are leaning hard on the brake,
arguing for alternative forms of rapid transit.
</P>
<P>
   To them, monorails, or Jetson-like travel pods suspended from a
guide-rail, or even buses that run on rubber tires but operate like
a train, are better than launching an electric train on a 17-mile
track from central Phoenix to downtown Mesa.
</P>
<P>
   To these dreamers, the rail plan is nothing but an ``electric
street car,'' a 19th century rail holdover, a rapid-transit plan
that will not be rapid and won't attract riders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're forging ahead to board the trolley car, which is a
technology we gave up in the 1940s,'' scoffed James Ellmore, a
proponent of building an elevated rail network that would rise over
the Phoenix area's major thoroughfares.
</P>
<P>
   But local city planners say they looked at everything from
monorails to subways and concluded that an electric train, running
at street level, is the best way to start building rapid-transit in
the Valley of the Sun, as the Phoenix is known. They hope a train
could be running by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   The decision boiled down to practicality: It costs less, and is
less controversial, to build a light-rail line at street level than
it is to put the system up in the air or tunnel it underground,
planners say.
</P>
<P>
   Elevated systems, for all the promise they hold of literally
gliding above traffic congestion, drive straight into a brick wall
of public opposition, said Jyme Sue Olson, media manager for Valley
Connections.
</P>
<P>
   The group is sponsored by Mesa, Phoenix, Tempe, the Maricopa
Association of Governments and the Regional Public Transportation
Authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``The aesthetic values, the loss of views of our mountains, the
privacy of citizens _ it's the most contentious part of the
light-rail effort,'' she said of elevated train systems.
</P>
<P>
   The ValTrans rail project failed at the ballot box a decade ago,
in part, because residents near the planned rail lines blanched at
the idea of trains full of passengers looming over their back
yards, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Other ideas are so futuristic that they don't operate anywhere,
except on the Web pages of their backers.
</P>
<P>
   The SkyTran proposal, for example, envisions two-person pods
suspended from an elevated guide-rail, or perhaps gliding along a
ground-level rail.
</P>
<P>
   The driverless cars would be available anytime, all the time, to
zip above town.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody's ever done it,'' said Steve Beard, deputy project
director for the light-rail effort.
</P>
<P>
   And nobody knows what it would cost.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the ground-level train system likely will cost up
to $40 million a mile, and would produce a rail system with a
40-year lifespan, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Since light-rail operates in a growing number of cities, from
San Diego to St. Louis, they have track records that can be studied
and adapted to the Phoenix metro area, planners say.
</P>
<P>
   As an alternative to light-rail, Maricopa County Supervisor Don
Stapley and a handful of adherents are pushing a rapid-bus network.
Their idea is to copy a system that has brought international
acclaim to the Brazilian city of Curitiba, a major urban center of
more than 1.4 million people southwest of Rio de Janeiro.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm calling this a precursor to the light-rail,'' said
Stapley, who as a member of the Regional Public Transportation
Authority voted in the past to proceed with rail planning to serve
the Valley's nearly 2.8 million residents.
</P>
<P>
   Stapley is trying to sell local officials _ specifically Tempe,
which has a transit tax, and Phoenix, which will hold a transit
election next spring _ on the merits of the bus system as a
cost-effective transition to rail.
</P>
<P>
   Beard said the rapid-bus idea could work, especially along
Phoenix area freeways, which have high-occupancy-vehicle lanes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't build rail everywhere,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the decision to run rail on the ground was made by local
planners early last year. The planning process is deep into such
details as where exactly the rail should run, how it might cross
Tempe's Town Lake, and how far apart stations should be.
</P>
<P>
   A series of open houses, starting Tuesday and running through
the end of September, will seek the public's ideas on those plans.
</P>
<P>
   Planners in early 1998 also decided that the best place to
launch a rail line would be from central Phoenix to central Mesa.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning at Central Avenue and Indian School Road, the 17-mile
rail would run through Phoenix's midcity and downtown business
districts, picking up at other people-intensive places such as the
Deck Park, Phoenix Public Library and the sports venues downtown.
The line would continue east along Washington Street, skirt past
the north side of Sky Harbor International Airport, sweep into
downtown Tempe past the Town Lake and Sun Devil Stadium, and end at
Dobson Road and Main Street in Mesa.
</P>
<P>
   Planners decided against running directly into the airport
because of the costs and logistics involved.
</P>
<P>
   But every time light-rail plans are aired, alternatives pop up.
</P>
<P>
   Ellmore, the founding dean of ASU's College of Architecture, has
shown his meticulously sketched plans for a 36-mile aerial rail
system to movers and shakers Valleywide ever since rail talk
renewed in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The reaction?
</P>
<P>
   ``Practically none,'' Ellmore said.
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledges that it's more expensive to build an elevated
system. But that's only looking at half of the equation.
</P>
<P>
   Planners need to balance the greater costs against the benefits,
such as development rights for the space above and along the
elevated rail lines, Ellmore said. In his view, elevated rail would
open a treasure trove of high-rise offices, condominiums and lofts
along the elevated rail network.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bowling, a Phoenix resident who follows transit issues,
hopes to persuade Phoenix officials that their transit election
next spring should steer away from light rail and buses, which he
considers a passe system. Instead, he'd like to see the city invest
some money in the brave new world of personal rapid-transit.
</P>
<P>
   Although there is no such system operating, Bowling said the
technology needed to make it happen exists and simply needs to be
pulled into a functioning package.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, it makes it a hard sell,'' Bowling said of the lack of
precedent. But he thinks it's a better buy _ although there are no
cost estimates. The ground-level light-rail train, he believes, is
doomed to failure because of its cost relative to the number of
people who would use it.
</P>
<P>
   But Valley Connection's Beard said that just because individual
rail-car technology exists doesn't mean the Phoenix metro area
should be its testing ground, nor the public purse its bankroll.
</P>
<P>
   ``Public agencies have a lot of responsibility to put something
out there that is safe,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Personal-rapid transit _ as well as some of the other ideas _
could have potential applications down the road, he said. For
example, airports could use the automated people-mover concept of
personal rapid-transit to shuttle people between terminals and
parking lots or transit stops.
</P>
<P>
   And elevated rail is not impossible, especially in cases where a
rail line would be needed to cross over congested intersections, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not 110 percent set that every inch of this will be at
grade,'' Beard said.
</P>
<P>
   The debate over which form of transit the Phoenix area should
adopt could shift again, and soon, as Phoenix gears up for a
transit election in the spring. A date has not been picked, but the
election likely would be in March or May.
</P>
<P>
   Without Phoenix's financial support, light-rail cannot be built,
Beard said.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix Councilwoman Peggy Bilsten said the city likely will
rely on the light-rail plan as the ``backbone'' of a Phoenix
public-transit system.
</P>
<P>
   As for the other ideas, Bilsten said, her mind is open.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're able to have a good, intelligent discussion,
hopefully they'll see we've got to start somewhere,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   If people approach transit with an attitude that it's their
idea, or nothing, ``We won't get anywhere,'' Bilsten said. &QL;

TRICKERY LEAVES HAWKS TRAPPED IN LIONS' DEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ For the record, let it be noted that the Mike Holmgren
era opened at the Kingdome Sunday with a bit of trickery.
</P>
<P>
   The first play from the Seahawks coach (among other titles)
called upon veteran running back Ricky Watters to take the handoff
from young quarterback Jon Kitna, then relay the ball back to Kitna
who, apparently, was supposed to heave da bomb downfield, maybe
even looking for a first-strike touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, friends, the old flea flicker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, considering what that play could have been, it could have
been a great start,'' Watters said, giving a revisionist look at
the Hawks' 28-20 opening-day defeat to the Lions.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he hits the bomb and scores, well, that's a whole other
story.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the attempt at da bomb was a bomb _ a stink bomb.
</P>
<P>
   Kitna was sacked, dropped for a bruising 8 yards as the Seahawks
failed to block the Lions' rush on the designer play.
</P>
<P>
   And just like that, Kitna, Watters, Holmgren and the Hawks were
in a deep hole against Detroit from which the Hawks would never
emerge.
</P>
<P>
   As for symbolism, you can understand that none of the culprits
in the botched play saw it as an omen. But that doesn't mean the
ol' flea flicker call did not dare Holmgren's fledgling Hawks to be
a little more sophisticated and a little more lucky than one could
reasonably expect _ at least at this early stage of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the learning curve and the execution curve are going to
be greater than predicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like when you run a reverse or any other special, goofy
play, it is either real good or real bad. There is no middle
ground,'' Holmgren said after his team's dismal debut.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, we had a chance, we just didn't block it right. It
was one of those frustrating things. We have some young guys
playing and they didn't do that right.''
</P>
<P>
   As opening-day disasters go, Holmgren can at least rest easy
knowing that Dennis Erickson's 1997 inaugural meltdown against the
Jets should stand as a testament to mind-bending lack of execution
and boneheadedness.
</P>
<P>
   However, this was the debut of the vaunted West Coast offense.
And the things that the Hawks did not do right were scattered all
over the field, starting with special teams breakdowns and a
defensive snafu that allowed the Barry Sanders-less Lions to run
like the bulls at Pamplona.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit collected 167 yards on the ground on 36 attempts for an
average of 4.6 yards per carry, while the Hawks managed a mere 31
yards on 16 carries _ Watters accounting for 13 carries and 21
yards.
</P>
<P>
   If that is the result of the Seahawks not paying Joey Galloway
monster cash to help open up the offense, Game 1 of the season
demonstrated how much extra pressure Kitna and Watters will have to
assume in the weeks to come.
</P>
<P>
   Watters, whose troubles in finding or making holes Sunday were
second only to his inability to swing outside, was the first to
draw boos from the 66,238 with just three minutes gone in the
second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Down 10-0 and the Hawks on their own 20-yard line, Watters took
the handoff on second-and-3 and was immediately cut down for no
gain, which was pretty much how it went all afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Holmgren said he expects the running game will
improve.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once we lost (receiver Charles) Jordan, they crowded us pretty
good,'' Holmgren said, adding, ``That's what I would do, since we
were pretty thin at those positions.''
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren was unwilling to single out Kitna, even when it was
clear that Holmgren was frustrated by some of what the young QB was
doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm going to help him, the best thing I can do is go
through the growing pains together,'' Holmgren said. ``It would be
counterproductive for me to ... say something that might be
emotional. I'd much rather see the film first.''
</P>
<P>
   While Kitna suffered under the heavy attack from the Lions'
defense, he said he felt fine during the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like I saw the field pretty well. Better than I
expected, actually. I didn't feel a lot of pressure, although once
we dug ourselves a hole, it was a little hard to get out,'' Kitna
said.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of the heavy Detroit rush, however, Kitna held the
ball several times when he should have tossed it away, which is why
he was knocked for six sacks.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Holmgren refused to let his emotions undermine the
long-term process he knows he must undergo with this quarterback,
this offense and this Seahawks team.
</P>
<P>
   ``The coaches were pretty good out there,'' Kitna said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told us not to press and if you look at everything we
did, it all came within the system. We didn't play well in the
first half, but we pulled it together in the second half because we
believe in what they're telling us,'' Kitna said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Coach was very supportive. ... Coach remained very
calm on the sideline, though I'm sure he was frustrated.''
</P>
<P>
   Results are going to matter very soon to Holmgren, not to
mention to the fans and to the Seahawks' spend-to-win owner. But
even in the face of a somewhat embarrassing beginning, Holmgren did
his best to keep his two main offensive cogs from slipping into a
tailspin _ a destination they seemed headed from the opening play
of the brand-new era.

TESTS SHOW BROWN SUFFERS NO SERIOUS INJURY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The Seahawks already were losing the game when it
suddenly appeared they had lost even more. Much more.
</P>
<P>
   All-Pro linebacker Chad Brown lay motionless on the Kingdome
turf for several minutes near the end of the first half in Sunday's
28-20 season-opening loss to the Detroit Lions.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, as is customary for a player who made 150 tackles last
season, had stuck his head into a play while trying to make a play.
Only this time, Brown didn't get up.
</P>
<P>
   He was strapped to a stretcher and taken from the field by
ambulance to Harborview Medical Center for tests that showed he has
suffered no neurological damage. His condition will be re-evaluated
today.
</P>
<P>
   But the loss of Brown, and just the thought that he could have
been lost for more than just a game or two, was an extra dose of
downer on an already bummer of a day. Brown, remember, was involved
in a helmet-to-helmet collision with linebacker Winston Moss two
years ago. Moss fractured two vertebra in his neck, ending his
career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chad's injury definitely gives you a bad feeling for him, his
family and friends,'' defensive tackle Sam Adams said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he was down on the field, that was the worst feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Seeing Brown's body being loaded into the ambulance wasn't
exactly uplifting either.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chad's the leader of this team,'' said linebacker James Logan,
who replaced Brown in the lineup for the second half. ``You just
have to step up and play a little harder when something like that
happens. But it's not an easy thing to do.''

HOLMGREN ERA OPENS WITH THUD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Excuse the misprint. That's the Mike Holmgren error,
not the Mike Holmgren era.
</P>
<P>
   In their first regular-season game under their new coach, and
amid all the expectations Holmgren's January hiring spawned, the
new-look Seahawks too closely resembled the same old Seahawks in
dropping a 28-20 decision to the Detroit Lions at the Kingdome
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The toughest part is doing the things that got us beat in the
past,'' guard Pete Kendall said after yet another embarrassing
season-opening loss under yet another new coach.
</P>
<P>
   Things like:
</P>
<P>
   -- Wide receiver Sean Dawkins' fumble ending the Seahawks'
opening possession and setting up the first of two field goals by
Lions kicker Jason Hanson;
</P>
<P>
   -- Center Chris Gray's high snap leading to a missed 32-yard
field goal by Todd Peterson that would have tied the game near the
end of the first quarter, and instead set up a 16-yard touchdown
pass from Lions quarterback Charlie Batch to wide receiver Germane
Crowell on the first play of the second quarter to give Detroit a
10-0 lead;
</P>
<P>
   -- Rookie Charlie Rogers muffing a punt return that was
recovered by the Lions Brock Olivo at the Seahawks' 5-yard line to
set up Batch's 5-yard TD pass to tight end David Sloan;
</P>
<P>
   -- Long-snapper Deems May taking his job description a little
too literally as he sailed a snap over the head of punter Jeff
Feagles and out of the end zone for a second-quarter safety that
pushed the Lions lead to 18-0.
</P>
<P>
   Three special-teams gaffs that led to 12 Lions' points in an
eight-point loss. Shades of 1997, when mistakes by the special
teams cost the Seahawks at least four games and any chance they had
of making the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   A lackluster effort by the offense, which included only 31
rushing yards and six sacks of a constantly pressured Jon Kitna.
Shades of 1998, when an inconsistent offense cost the Seahawks at
least five games and any chance of making the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   A couldn't-stop-them-when-they-really-needed-to effort by the
defense, which allowed 369 yards to a Lions offense that was
without Barry Sanders and three of its starting linemen and then
lost Pro Bowl wide receiver Herman Moore to a sprained knee in the
first quarter. Shades of, well, pale shades of gray to match the
Kingdome roof.
</P>
<P>
   And, adding Seahawks injury to insult, All-Pro linebacker Chad
Brown was taken from the field in an ambulance late in the first
half after jamming his neck; cornerback Fred Thomas is probably
lost for the season after fracturing his right leg; tackle Todd
Weiner could miss up to a month after spraining his right ankle;
and wide receiver Charles Jordan could be sidelined just as long
after pulling his left hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   One of the only good pieces of news on this day was that tests
performed at Harborview Medical Center detected no neurological
damage for Brown, who was released from the hospital Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The prognosis isn't nearly as good for the rest of the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Detroit played well, and this isn't me on my soap box trying
to take anything away from them,'' Kendall said. ``But you can look
at what we gave away, you can look at stupid things we continue to
do, and say maybe this could have been different.''
</P>
<P>
   This was supposed to be different. These weren't Dennis
Erickson's Seahawks. Or Tom Flores' Seahawks. But the outcome was
the same _ another disheartening opening-day loss, where the
Seahawks made an inferior team look better than they really are by
looking ill-prepared and being outplayed in every phase of the
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised that Coach didn't rip us,'' cornerback Shawn
Springs said. ``Actually, he was very positive and told us we just
have to continue to work. We're all professionals and we know what
we have to do to correct those mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   And everyone made them. There were missed blocks on offense, at
least one missed tackle by every member of the defense and, of
course, the costly special-teams plays that were anything but
special.
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren appeared as if he was nearing a meltdown several times
during the game, but he was uncharacteristically subdued afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``We dug a pretty good hole for ourselves in the first half,''
Holmgren said. ``We tried to climb out in the second half. I was
pleased with the effort in the second half. They did not fold up
their tents. It would have been easy to do, as poorly as we played
in the first half. Everything that could go wrong seemed to go
wrong. We were just not very good.''
</P>
<P>
   Even when they were, it wasn't enough.
</P>
<P>
   Like in the second half. Kitna found Dawkins twice with
touchdown passes to cut the Lions' lead to 25-20. One more
defensive stop, and the offense would have had one last chance to
pull a rabbit out of their skunk-filled helmets.
</P>
<P>
   Five times in the second half the Lions had the ball. Five times
the Seahawks forced punts.
</P>
<P>
   But when the Seahawks most needed their defense, what they got
was Batch passing to Crowell for 15 yards; Ron Rivers running for
12 and 9 yards; and Batch and Rivers hooking up on a 19-yard pass
play that pushed Hanson into range for a 49-yard field goal with
2:10 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very disappointing,'' defensive tackle Sam Adams said.
``It was a situation where they wanted it. They won the battle. We
didn't have a very good showing. We were good at times. But we
weren't very good at other times.''

KOREAN MAN IN TACOMA SUING JAPANESE COMPANIES FOR FORCED LABOR
DURING WWII 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BRUCE RAMSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jae Sik Choe remembers the Japanese Imperial army soldiers who
came to his Korean village in 1943. Korea was a Japanese colony
then, and Japan was at war and needed young men such as Choe for
their factories and construction sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Japanese told me that I would make good money and that I
would be treated well by working in Japan,'' he said. But at the
Yawata steel mill, Choe said, he worked sunup to sundown, six days
a week, performing tasks such as lifting steel onto trucks. Most of
his pay was withheld as ``patriotic deposits'' and never returned.
</P>
<P>
   The 20-year-old was not allowed to quit, and his net pay was
``about three yen per month,'' which he said amounted to being a
slave.
</P>
<P>
   Now 76, Choe who emigrated to Tacoma, Wash., in the 1980s with
his wife, last week filed a first-of-its-kind lawsuit in federal
court there: a class action on behalf of all Koreans living in the
United States who were subjected to forced labor in Japan. It asks
for unspecified damages and ``a declaration that Defendants are war
criminals who should be barred from doing business in the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   His affidavit says he tried to run away, ``but because I had no
money to return to Korea, I surrendered myself.'' Later, he was
allowed to attend his mother's funeral, but was forced to return to
Japan. When he left at the war's end, a time when food was short
even for the Japanese, he said through a translator that he was
``skin and bones.''
</P>
<P>
   Choe's lawsuit names Nippon Steel Inc., which it says is the
successor of the company that owned the Yawata mill.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese attorney Etsuro Totsuka, who is researching
human-rights issues at the University of Washington in Seattle,
helped on the lawsuit. He said that from Choe's description of a
tunnel he helped dig at Mizushima, Japan,it was at an aircraft
plant of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries.
</P>
<P>
   Choe is suing Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, too: a first on this
issue, Totsuka said. Nippon Steel was sued in Japan, and in 1997
became the first Japanese company to pay a forced-labor claim _ a
settlement to 11 Korean families of about $15,000 each.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. attorney for Nippon Steel, Bob Sacks of Sullivan &AMP;
Cromell in Los Angeles, said he has not been served with the
complaint, and could not comment. Mitsubishi's Heavy Industries'
New York office did not return a phone call.
</P>
<P>
   Choe did not sue the Japanese government, though his complaint
states, ``it is obvious that the Japanese government is largely
responsible.'' Japan settled all war-era claims against it by South
Korea with a payment in 1965 of $500 million. The money went to the
South Korean government. Japan has also settled all war claims by
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, Japan allowed foreign individuals to sue Japanese
employers for wartime deeds. ``Given the separation of powers,''
reads a statement issued by the Japanese consulate here, ``the
judgment must be passed by these courts, and the Government of
Japan intends to await their decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Choe's lawsuit was filed by Lakewood, Wash., attorney Eddie
Yoon, who emigrated from South Korea in the ninth grade, attended
the University of Washington Law School and became the first
Korean-American attorney in Washington state. Yoon is suing under
the Alien Tort Claims Act, a law signed by George Washington.
</P>
<P>
   That law was nearly forgotten before it was used against former
Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos. Yoon also wielded it against
former South Korean presidents Chun Doo Hwan and Roh Tae Woo for
allegedly torturing a plaintiff during anti-government
demonstrations in Kwangju in 1979. Though his case went to the U.S.
Supreme Court, he lost. The high court ruled last year that the
United States had no jurisdication because Chun and Roh didn't live
here or have known assets here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mitsubishi Heavy and Nippon Steel have offices in New York, so
there's no problem about jurisdiction,'' Yoon said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the case Yoon filed last week, California passed
a law this summer that allows forced-labor claims against foreign
nations. The law was sponsored by California state Democratic Rep.
Tom Hayden. According to the Center for Internee Rights, three
claims have been filed under Hayden's law, all by former American
prisoners of war.
</P>
<P>
   However, Yoon says Hayden's law, which embroils a state in
foreign affairs, might not be constitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Yoon says Choe's lawsuit based on the 200-year-old Alien Tort
Claims Act is on more solid legal ground. His effort now is to add
both claimants and defendants.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were about a thousand Japanese corporations that
benefited from forced slave laborers,'' the lawsuit states, ``and
their names will be added at a later date.'' But identifying
companies then and their connections to companies today are
difficult tasks.
</P>
<P>
   Word about the lawsuit has prompted several members of the
Tacoma Korean Seniors League to come forward. Last week, Yoon
interviewed Yong Hwan Kim. Kim, 76, may not be able to join the
lawsuit, because his employer was the Japanese navy and the
government had settled all claims earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Kim said that in 1942 he also was promised good pay during his
two-year contract in Japan, and got it _ the equivalent in today's
money of $1,500 to $2,000 per month _ plus a raise after six
months. But he said he was punished for violating the rules, and
was beaten so badly with a knotted rope that he couldn't bathe for
a week. He said his cheek was burned with a hot iron.
</P>
<P>
   Kim said American POWs were stationed near where he worked, and
that he can remember visiting the camp on his Sundays off to see
what Americans looked like. He recalls handing a cigarette through
the barbed wire, and seeing the Americans pass it from man to man.
They had been working with concrete, he said, and looked to be in a
condition ``worse than the Koreans.''
</P>
<P>
   Kim said the Japanese extended his contract without his consent,
but allowed him to leave in March 1945. He returned home with 400
yen in his pocket, a respectable amount. Years later, his daughter
married an American, and in 1987 Kim and his wife came to America.

YOUNG STARS PLAY COYOTES TO STANDOFF
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAULA CABALLERO 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Phoenix Coyotes forward Jeremy Roenick was without his
mortal enemy last night. The Stars played not only without
defenseman Derian Hatcher, whose hit broke Roenick's jaw last
season, but also without Mike Modano, Brett Hull and Joe
Nieuwendyk.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes took the opposite approach, using a lineup complete
with players such as Roenick, Keith Tkachuk, Teppo Numminen and
Keith Carney.
</P>
<P>
   For a mismatch, the no-namers held their own in this 2-2 tie.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great test for us,'' Stars forward Blake Sloan said.
``I think it's a great compliment to our team that we can go out
there without a bunch of our quote-unquote NHL guys and really
battle hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Stars coach Ken Hitchcock seemed genuinely pleased with his
young squad's performance, pointing specifically to the play of
winger Keith Aldridge, who had a goal and an assist, and both
goalies, Marty Turco and Manny Fernandez.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock also noted that the play of center Derek Plante
continued to be strong and that defenseman Warren Luhning ``got
better and better as the game went on.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was a very competitive game,'' Hitchcock said.
``This was really good because we played against a lot of good
players and the game was a real good evaluation of a lot of our
young guys.''
</P>
<P>
   A five-minute overtime period, using the new four-on-four format
as an experiment, was played before regulation. Neither team
scored, however.
</P>
<P>
   The contest was not completely without ugliness, as during the
last 36 seconds of regulation an otherwise quiet Roenick got into
it with Sloan, and that started a short brawl in the corner. After
that fracas was cleared, Tkachuk went off on Luhning, dropping his
gloves at the drop of the puck.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams contend the scraps were simply the result of hard
play, not leftover bad blood. Tkachuk said he reacted because of a
hit Luhning put on Phoenix defenseman Numminen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a preseason game, and I don't want to see Teppo get hurt.
I'm sure it was a good, clean hit,'' Tkachuk said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to send a message, I'm working on my game. ...
We'll worry about the Dallas Stars when we see them in the first
game of the regular season. You can't say anything bad about the
Dallas Stars. They're Stanley Cup champions.''
</P>
<P>
   Stars defenseman John Erskine and Coyotes winger Kevin Saywer
engaged in a fight in the first period, but that, too, was written
off to the heat of the moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids were fighting for jobs,'' said Stars winger Mike Keane,
who had a goal and an assist. ``That's part of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Turco played the first two periods of regulation, turning back
21 of 23 shots in a steady performance amid the discombobulation
created by the green group in front of him, anchored by veterans
Darryl Sydor, Keane and Brian Skrudland.
</P>
<P>
   Turco turned back at least four point-blank shots, including one
in the second period from Tkachuck, who stood on the left doorstep
with a rebound on his stick. Turco managed to make the save while
sprawled on his side. Fernandez made eight saves in the third
period.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had some hang-in-there performances,'' Hitchcock said.

</P>
<P>
   U.S.-WORLDPOWER-REVIEW (Auckland, New Zealand) _ As the U.S.
helped bring one more Mideast peace agreement to fruition, a crisis
broke out at the other end of the world. Again, Washington was
called on to find a solution. But this time, in East Timor, the
ability of the U.S. to make the problem go way by simply swaggering
in proved not so easy. The world has recently come to think of the
U.S. as the one power with enough influence to make just about
anybody sit up and listen. But just what does this singular U.S.
power consist of, and how and where can the U.S. use it? By Jane
Perlez. (`i' category)
</P>
<P>
   BIG-MERGERS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Mega-mergers, such as CBS-Viacom,
seem to pass the logic of a high-school economics course. They are
intended to efficiently expand a network for the distribution of
goods or services or consolidate overlapping distribution networks.
Yet many such deals are also based largely on ego, hubris and
management fads. Many fail, as post-merger returns for shareholders
often trail market averages. Putting together two large
organizations is a difficult management challenge, even when the
two are a good fit strategically. By Steve Lohr. (`a' category).
WITH GRAPHIC.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moved in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   CLEMENCY-REVIEW (Washington) _ President Clinton's controversial
offer of conditional clemency for Puerto Rican militants was far
from a routine action for him. He has granted fewer clemency
petitions than either of his Republican predecessors, Presidents
George Bush and Ronald Reagan. In fact, the number of presidential
clemencies has steadily declined since the mid 1970s, as the
intensity of partisan political debate over fighting crime has
heated up. By David Johnston. WITH PHOTO.
</P>
<P>
   WILDERNESS-REVIEW (Seattle) _ Roughly 4 percent, or 103 million
acres, of the U.S. is designated as protected wilderness. And this
month, the 35th anniversary of the law that allowed Congress to set
aside public land as forever wild, supporters of more wilderness
say at least another 100 million acres could be added to the
system. But at century's end, the definition of what qualifies as
true wilderness in a country of 260 million people has never been
more elusive. And the purpose of setting aside land in its native
state has never been more contentious. By Timothy Egan. WITH PHOTO.
</P>
<P>
   TWENTYFOUR-SEVEN-REVIEW (Undated) _ To trend watchers, the
expression `24/7' has worked its way into the English language as
an abbreviation for a clock-defying world where financial markets
run continually and news channels promise never-ending headlines
(along with weather and traffic reports). But how did the phrase
originate? By James Barron.
</P>
<P>
   DROUGHT-BENEFITS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Farmers, home gardeners and
many others cursed the severe drought that hit the Northeast this
summer. But others managed to make hay while the sun shone. Among
them are wine-makers, well-diggers, building contractors, seashore
landlords, apple, peach and blueberry growers, wild-turkey lovers,
and cops looking for marijuana crops. By Joe Sharkey.
</P>
<P>
   SLEEP-TIPS-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ The publishing world has been
producing so many books on sleep and sleep disorders that the
nation now has a viable alternative to counting sheep. Many are
repetitive, recommending familiar habits of healthful living. But
even so, the books may not leave your eyelids droopy _ for a close
perusal yields passages that surprise, startle, mystify or amuse. A
sampling.
</P>
<P>
   GUN-OWNERS-REVIEW (Undated) _ A photo essay about gun owners
yields a range of reasons for owning guns: sport, hunting,
collecting, self-protection (against rattlesnakes as well as human
intruders), sentimental reasons and investment. WITH PHOTOS.
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moved in the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   PERU-FUJIMORI-REVIEW (Lima) _ President Alberto Fujimori's
tenure has been marked by extraordinary up-and-down swings in his
popularity. But every time he mocks human rights and is branded a
tyrant by foreign democrats, his popularity with Peru's voters
rises again. When Peru led South America in abandoning military
rule and embracing civil liberties and democracy two decades ago,
it quickly found itself on the verge of collapse in the face of
terrorist violence. Fujimori responded with a distinctive formula:
an electoral democracy that survives primarily by setting ever
stricter limits on civil liberties. By Clifford Krauss.
</P>
<P>
   GERMANY-HOLOCAUST-REVIEW (Buchenwald) _ The `Americanization' of
German memory puts a fixation on the Holocaust that some Germans
say excludes a rich cultural and political history and
oversimplifies the 12 years of Nazism. Another historical
distortion will take root if Nazi crimes become exclusively
synonymous in popular consciousness with the murder of 6 million
Jews, if all the camps are seen only as death factories for Jews
and if there is no place in that consciousness for the millions of
non-Jewish victims. By Roger Cohen. WITH PHOTO.

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; THE PROFESSOR AND THE MADMAN: A Tale of Murder, Insanity, and
the Making of the Oxford English Dictionary &LR;  By Simon Winchester.
Harper Perennial, $13. In 1896 the editor of the Oxford English
Dictionary tracked down and befriended one of his most prolific and
dependable contributors, an American Civil War veteran who was
incarcerated at an asylum for the criminally insane. Last year the
reviewer David Walton called this an ``elegant and scrupulous
retelling'' of ``one of the strangest modern literary stories.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BIRDS OF AMERICA &LR;  By Lorrie Moore. Picador USA, $14. These
stories feature articulate, romantically frustrated characters,
usually women, whose predicaments allow the reader to infer a
lifetime from a moment of crisis. Some of the tales in this
collection, which was selected as one of the best books of 1998 by
the editors of The New York Times Book Review, concern adults or
children with cancer, yet somehow they manage to find humor even as
they sharply probe issues of mortality. ``Fluid, cracked, mordant,
colloquial, Moore's sentences hold, even startle, us as they glide
beneath the radar of ideological theories of behavior to evoke the
messy, god-awful behavior itself,'' James McManus wrote.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE COLLECTED TALES OF NIKOLAI GOGOL &LR;  Translated by Richard
Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky. Vintage Classics, $15. These 13
stories by the Russian fantasist include early tales of Cossacks
and devils set in his native Ukraine, and later classics like ``The
Nose'' and ``The Overcoat,'' written after he became famous in his
early 20s. Last year one critic called this ``a superb new
translation.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TOMCAT IN LOVE &LR;  By Tim O'Brien. Broadway, $13. This novel's
narrator is a snide linguistics professor (and Vietnam veteran) who
is obsessed with his ex-wife and driven by a need to seduce every
woman he meets. ``Like all comic novels, `Tomcat in Love' is a
complex affair that invites a complex response and offers a complex
reward,'' Jane Smiley wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MINOR CHARACTERS: A Young Woman's Coming-of-Age in the Beat
Orbit of Jack Kerouac &LR;  By Joyce Johnson. Penguin, $13.95. The
former girlfriend and caretaker of the guiding spirit of the Beats
describes her growing up bright and sensitive in the 1950s
counterculture and her years with Kerouac's subterranean boys'
club. In 1983 the reviewer Helen Chasin said her stories are ``not
only interesting and vivid but in several respects have more
dimension than the adventure tales and clubhouse philosophizing
that captured America's imagination in the late '50s.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SORT OF RICH &LR;  By James Wilcox. Back Bay/Little, Brown, $12.95.
In this comic novel, a New Yorker settles down with her wealthy new
husband in tranquil Tula Springs, La., where her hopes for a
simpler life are dashed by the exotic household help, including a
mysterious hippieish handyman and his arthritic stepniece. ``Wilcox
is both a fine storyteller and a skilled novelist,'' Jill McCorkle
wrote in 1989.

<P>
   The same publisher has also reissued  &UR; POLITE SEX &LR;  ($13),
Wilcox's novel about the shifting fortunes of two lifelong friends,
an idealistic actress and an aspiring model, who flee Tula Springs
for the bright lights of New York. In 1991, Elinor Lipman admired
the author's ``sly social satire.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NOT ENTITLED: A Memoir &LR;  By Frank Kermode. Farrar, Straus &AMP;
Giroux, $13. With tact and restraint, the renowned literary critic
recalls his childhood on the Isle of Man, his six-year stint in the
Royal Navy during World War II and his long career in academia and
letters. The result is ``a triumph of tone,'' David Bromwich wrote
in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; AN EMPIRE WILDERNESS: Travels Into America's Future &LR;  By Robert
D. Kaplan. Vintage Departures, $14. A journalist combs the West and
foresees a nation of privately guarded housing developments,
corporate fortresses, homogenous suburban pods and
automobile-dominated cities. Believe it or not, he finds it all
``not so bleak.'' In 1998 the reviewer Thurston Clarke said, ``His
theories are brave and provocative, and I cannot imagine anyone
will concoct a more convincing scenario for the American future.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE UNDERCLASS &LR; , by Ken Auletta (Overlook, $16.95), is a
revised and updated edition of the author's 1982 journalistic study
of the chronically poor welfare recipients, criminals and drifters
whose problems defy simple solutions _ conservative, liberal or
otherwise. This is an ``important and impressive'' book, Charles
Peters wrote.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THIS IS MY DAUGHTER &LR;  By Roxana Robinson. Scribner, $13. This
novel is about innocence lost _ that of two children of divorce,
and that of their parents, who are stricken by rage, guilt and
shame. In 1998 the reviewer Diana Postlethwaite noted that while
the author's fiction is often called Cheeveresque, this time she
``made me think of an earlier literary forebear, Henry James.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TRUTH: Four Stories I Am Finally Old Enough to Tell &LR;  By Ellen
Douglas. Plume, $12.95. In her first nonfiction book, the Southern
novelist meditates on events that fueled her fiction, including a
lifelong illicit romance, her grandfather's suicide and the
execution of some local slaves. The result is a ``curious, lovely
book,'' Laura Jamison wrote earlier this year.

24/7: REDEFINING A LIFE OF NONSTOP POSSIBILITIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)  
 (bl)  
 By JAMES BARRON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It looks like a top-heavy fraction whose value is a bit larger
than Pi. But to trend watchers, the expression ``24/7'' has worked
its way into the language as an abbreviation for a clock-defying
world where financial markets run continually and news channels
promise never-ending headlines (along with weather and traffic
reports).
</P>
<P>
   Log on to Slate, Microsoft's online magazine, and you'll find a
section called ``24/seven'' that contains columns and e-mails to
the editor. Redbook magazine had ``24/7'' for quick recipes and
life-style tips. United Airlines has used it in an advertisement.
</P>
<P>
   Figuring out how 24/7 became popular, though, is almost a 24/7
proposition in itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure how it got into the vernacular,'' said Kurt
Jenkins, a graphic designer who uses the Web address www.24-7.com.
``It's a younger people's saying.'' (This from someone who is all
of 29.)
</P>
<P>
   Chris Wilson, the entrepreneur who owns Jenkins' address and
about 200 others containing alphanumeric variations on 24-7, agreed
that it probably originated with people under 30. ``It began as a
kind of a Generation X term to describe the Internet,'' he said.
``We figured that a lot of older people had tried to capture this
catch phrase with symbols and logos, but they missed it.''
</P>
<P>
   In a world where speed counts, syllables are precious. ``It's
just too long to say `24 hours, 7 days a week,' so it was
abbreviated,'' said Andrew Nelson of Britannica.com, the online arm
of the venerable Encyclopaedia Britannica. ``In the Web world, 24/7
is the shorthand for saying `We're live all the time.'''
</P>
<P>
   Is it written 24/7 (with the numbers separated by a slash)? Or
simply the consecutive digits 2, 4 and 7? `` 24/7 is the way it
should be written,'' Wilson said, ``but on the Internet the only
punctuation is a dash. I think a lot of people rushed to capture it
and they missed the boat.'' The dash is crucial, he said. ``You
look at 247 and think, `What's that?'' A 7-Eleven doesn't say
`711.'''
</P>
<P>
   Dictionaries have yet to take note of 24/7. Not even Microsoft's
new Encarta, which has entries for ``twenty questions'' and
``twenty-twenty,'' defines it.
</P>
<P>
   Neither does the monumental Random House Historical Dictionary
of American Slang; its third volume, covering entries from P to Z,

24/7: REDEFINING A LIFE OF NONSTOP POSSIBILITIES 
</HEADLINE>

   It looks like a top-heavy fraction whose value is a bit larger
than Pi. But to trend watchers, the expression ``24/7'' has worked
its way into the language as an abbreviation for a clock-defying
world where financial markets run continually and news channels
promise never-ending headlines (along with weather and traffic
reports).
</P>
<P>
   Log on to Slate, Microsoft's online magazine, and you'll find a
section called ``24/seven'' that contains columns and e-mails to
the editor. Redbook magazine had ``24/7'' for quick recipes and
life-style tips. United Airlines has used it in an advertisement.
</P>
<P>
   Figuring out how 24/7 became popular, though, is almost a 24/7
proposition in itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure how it got into the vernacular,'' said Kurt
Jenkins, a graphic designer who uses the Web address www.24-7.com.
``It's a younger people's saying.'' (This from someone who is all
of 29.)
</P>
<P>
   Chris Wilson, the entrepreneur who owns Jenkins' address and
about 200 others containing alphanumeric variations on 24-7, agreed
that it probably originated with people under 30. ``It began as a
kind of a Generation X term to describe the Internet,'' he said.
``We figured that a lot of older people had tried to capture this
catch phrase with symbols and logos, but they missed it.''
</P>
<P>
   In a world where speed counts, syllables are precious. ``It's
just too long to say `24 hours, 7 days a week,' so it was
abbreviated,'' said Andrew Nelson of Britannica.com, the online arm
of the venerable Encyclopaedia Britannica. ``In the Web world, 24/7
is the shorthand for saying `We're live all the time.'''
</P>
<P>
   Is it written 24/7 (with the numbers separated by a slash)? Or
simply the consecutive digits 2, 4 and 7? `` 24/7 is the way it
should be written,'' Wilson said, ``but on the Internet the only
punctuation is a dash. I think a lot of people rushed to capture it
and they missed the boat.'' The dash is crucial, he said. ``You
look at 247 and think, `What's that?'' A 7-Eleven doesn't say
`711.'''
</P>
<P>
   Dictionaries have yet to take note of 24/7. Not even Microsoft's
new Encarta, which has entries for ``twenty questions'' and
``twenty-twenty,'' defines it.
</P>
<P>
   Neither does the monumental Random House Historical Dictionary
of American Slang; its third volume, covering entries from P to Z,
has yet to be completed. The project editor, Jesse Sheidlower, said
recently that he had not reached the T's, but 24/7 was certain to
be included. ``The definition will probably be something very
simple like `constantly,''' he said. ``It doesn't mean 24 hours a
day, seven days a week. It refers to things that can't literally be
24 hours a day, seven days a week. We have an example like running
the vacuum cleaner 24/7 for two days in a row.'' Not possible, he
said. ``If you had an example like `He was happy 24/7' or `He was
stoned 24/7,' you'll never know if that's absolutely literal. It

<P>
   AUCKLAND, New Zealand _ On the very day that the United States
helped bring one more Middle East peace agreement to fruition and
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright witnessed its signing, a
crisis broke out at the other end of the world. Again, Washington
was called on to find a solution. But this time, in East Timor, the
United States found it not so easy to make the problem go way by
simply swaggering in at the opportune moment and brandishing its
influence.
</P>
<P>
   The contrast is stunning, if only because the world has long
thought of the Middle East, not some tiny corner of Indonesia, as
the toughest nut to crack among all the world's many intractable
disputes, and because the world has recently come to think of the
United States as the one power with enough influence to make just
about anybody sit up and listen _ the ``indispensable nation,'' in
one of Albright's favorite phrases.
</P>
<P>
   But just what does this singular U.S. power consist of, and how
and where can the United States use it? More important, are there
still moments, as with the Indonesians last week, when Americans
might be tempted to just throw up their hands and say it is beyond
their power to do anything?
</P>
<P>
   The question is hardly academic. Right now, Washington is trying
to help end a war in East Africa between Ethiopians and Eritreans.
In North Asia, it wants to stop the North Koreans from test firing
a ballistic missile, a threat that worries South Korea and Japan.
And in South Asia, the Clinton administration is unofficially
adjudicating the dispute in Kashmir between India and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   The impulse for Americans to get involved in East Timor was
sudden and sharp, after murderous militias rampaged through the
Portuguese-speaking territory last week in an effort to overturn
the results of a referendum in which the population voted
overwhelmingly for independence. At least at first, Indonesia
flatly rejected U.N. efforts to send in a peacekeeping force,
leading U.S. officials to step in and try to persuade them to
either restore order quickly or let outsiders do so.
</P>
<P>
   In the initial moments of frustration with Indonesia, it might
have been tempting to think of the way American clout had just
played so important a role in the Middle East. But in fact, the
decision to get peace talks back on track with a revamped
land-for-security deal between the Palestinians and Israelis hardly
represented a precedent for success in Indonesia. Instead, it was
an unusually easy opportunity to make America seem irresistible.
</P>
<P>
   First, the immediate question to be mediated in the Middle East
wasn't really so tough. There was a quibble here over the release
of prisoners, a quibble there over the right to launch unilateral
actions. And a larger question underneath hinted at inevitable
American success. Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak had wanted as
little U.S. input as possible, preferring to bargain on his own
with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. But Arafat waited for the
comfort of a U.S. presence not just at the signing, but in the
deal-making itself.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it was the presence of Albright that gave the
Palestinian the confidence to sign up. For Arafat, this made
Washington a court of last appeal. Now, he can reason, if something
goes wrong with the implementation of the deal he can turn to the
Clinton administration for help.
</P>
<P>
   But a lot of history has gone into that understanding _ nearly
three decades of a tenacious, expensive and often frustrating U.S.
commitment to help the Middle East find a lasting peace. The
question in other parts of the globe now is whether the United
States can similarly play the role of ``indispensable nation'' in
helping resolve situations like the one in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   By some measures, Washington does seem to have a long history of
involvement, and hence considerable leverage, with Indonesia _
certainly a lot more than can be claimed by neighboring Australia,
one of Washington's staunchest and now most nervous allies.
Australia, whose northernmost port of Darwin is only about 400
miles from East Timor, clamored all week for U.S. help in calming
the violence and for U.S. logistical support in mounting a
peacekeeping mission to be sponsored by the United Nations. Very
quickly, senior U.S. military officers were in contact with Gen.
Wiranto, the head of the Indonesian army, telling him to curb the
militias or face consequences.
</P>
<P>
   But as Wiranto listened by telephone to Gen. Henry Shelton, the
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Indonesian knew he had a
very good hand to play as well. All of Washington's history of
backing the Indonesian military during the Cold War in fact brings
it little leverage these days; in recent years, almost all military
assistance has been cut by Congress because of the Indonesian
army's abuse of human rights. And as Wiranto listened, he knew
something even more important: that the United States is not about
to totally abandon Indonesia, the world's fourth most populous
nation and the master of sea lanes through which U.S. naval vessels
and oil carriers pass.
</P>
<P>
   In short, Indonesia is a strategically important country for the
United States in Asia, one that serves as a counterbalance to China
as well as Japan. (The Israelis have known something similar over
the years, of course, but their calculations have been different:
While no U.S. president could abandon Israel, the United States
also wasn't about to abandon its Arab allies who gave America
access to oil. Hence the pressure for all sides to seek peace.)
</P>
<P>
   Last week, before Clinton left Washington to attend the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in New Zealand, where East
Timor's plight is sure to dominate the discussions, he suggested he
might push for the International Monetary Fund to curb economic
assistance to Indonesia. But on hearing this, Wiranto may well have
calculated that this was not a serious threat either. The end of
financial aid to Indonesia, where the economy is in perilous shape,
would produce the very troubles that the United States would like
to avoid.

   ``The United States would hate to carry out that threat because
you would create chaos,'' said Walter Russell Mead, a senior fellow
at the Council on Foreign Relations, who is writing a book on the
history of American diplomacy. ``The last thing we want to be
forced to do is shoot the Indonesians in the head. To block all aid
would hurt United States interests as much as Indonesia's.''
</P>
<P>
   While Washington was displeased last week with the Indonesian
army's refusal to put out the fire in East Timor, the
administration also had reason to fear putting too much pressure on
the Indonesian military. With the decline of the major political
party, Golkar, and with democratic reforms in their infancy, the
United States still sees the army as the only national institution
capable of holding together an archipelago nation strewn across
thousands of miles.
</P>
<P>
   Mead also argues that Washington is hampered in the new crisis
by a lack of past identification with East Timor. In the Middle
East, for example, administration negotiators, who have been
dealing intensely with Arafat for nearly a decade, can tell him:
``Don't declare statehood, don't mess it up, you can't do that,''
Mead said. And then the administration can _ as Clinton did last
April _ promise to hold a summit meeting, always an attractive
offer for Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, the lure of the United States as a broker is the
lure of the United States as a dispenser of economic assistance. In
the Middle East 20 years ago, Egyptian President Anwar Sadat did
not make peace with Israel primarily out of a desire for peace
itself, said Itamar Rabinovitch, a former Israeli ambassador to the
United States who has just written a history of Middle East
negotiations, ``Waging Peace'' (Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux). ``He
wanted to disengage from the Soviet Union and have ties with the
United States,'' Rabinovitch said. Sadat's reward for settling with
Israel at Camp David consisted of huge infusions of annual aid to
Egypt in subsequent years.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Rabinovitch argues, the priority today for Syrian
President Hafez Assad is not so much to make peace with Israel as
to make peace with Washington and then hopefully reap economic
assistance. Thus, Assad is insisting on an American broker as he
contemplates whether to get serious and start negotiations with
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   In Korea too, money plays a big role; it is why North Korea
accepts the United States as a mediator between it and the South.
In essence, Washington has been bribing crop-starved North Korea
with food aid to try to keep it from firing a missile. And for some
smaller countries, good behavior in American eyes can result in
largesse from the international financial institutions. With U.S.
involvement as mediator in the Ethiopian-Eritrean conflict, it is
almost certain that financial support would follow peace.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, then, it is the use of U.S. economic power as a club
or carrot that may prove the most promising way to persuade the
Indonesians to let the world help stem the violence in East Timor.
Indonesia is, after all, only now emerging from the economic crisis
that shook all of Asia just two years ago, and that brought about
the collapse of Indonesia's last government, under Suharto.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is as though an industry of peace is our greatest export,''
said Mead.

   Sleep, while never exactly out of style, seems really in vogue
now. The Wall Street Journal this year proclaimed it ``the new
status symbol.'' Business superstars like Jeff Bezos of Amazon.com

getting eight hours of luxuriant nod regularly, to the doubtless
envy of America's legions of sleep-deprived stiffs.

   The publishing world has been busy sawing wood itself, producing
so many books on sleep and sleep disorders that the nation now has
a viable alternative to counting sheep. According to R.R. Bowker's
``Books in Print,'' scores of new titles on sleep have been churned
out annually in the late 1990s and there are now hundreds
available.
</P>
<P>
   Many are redundant, recommending familiar habits of healthful
living as keys to sound slumber. (Eat right, exercise, go easy on
the booze and caffeine, etc.) But even so, the books may not leave
your eyelids drooping _ for a close perusal yields passages that
surprise, startle, mystify or amuse. Here is a sampling.

   Sleep Book No. 1: ``The Snoring Cure: Simple Steps to Getting a
Good Night's Sleep,'' by Dr. Laurence A. Smolley and Debra Fulghum
Bruce (W.W. Norton, 1999).
</P>
<P>
   Quote: Through the years, bed partners have taken it upon
themselves to solve the snoring problem, using such obscure
remedies as stuffing a cloth in the snorer's mouth. Snorers have
claimed fractured ribs from getting hard pokes during the night by
a bed partner in an attempt to jolt the snorer and quiet the noise.
In an extreme case of listener annoyance, the gunslinger John
Wesley Hardin is remarked to have fatally shot a loud snorer in the
next room.

   Worry-Stopper No. 1: The Worry Tree

<P>
   Choose a tree in your yard or near your home that you see each
day as you come home from work. Designate it as your ``worry
tree.'' ... Leave all your worries on the tree as you enter your
home.
</P>
<P>
   If no tree is handy, visualize yourself pinning each of your
worries on a real or imagined clothes line. Or visualize yourself
burying each of your worries in a hole in the ground and covering
it with soil. Or ``see'' yourself placing all your worries in an
incinerator and burning them. Another variation is to place all
your worries in an imaginary garbage can. ...

a Quiet Night's Sleep,'' by Dr. Jeffrey N. Hausfeld (Three Rivers

</P>
<P>
   Quote: An elderly couple made separate appointments to see me
and were placed in two adjacent examining rooms. When I first went
in to see the gentleman, his major complaint was a stuffy nose.
Upon examination, he had significant obstruction to his nasal
airflow, a very bulky uvula, enlarged tonsils and a short, heavy
neck. Suspecting that he might have a problem with snoring, I asked
him, ``How badly do you snore at night?'' His answer surprised me.
He said that he used to snore very loudly, but in recent years his
wife had not complained. It turned out that when I went to the
adjacent examining room to speak to his wife, she was there to
consult me about her progressive hearing loss.

<P>
   Quote, on napping in the cockpit: Although pilot naps, intended
or otherwise, already occur on American flights ... it has proven
politically impossible to pass regulations allowing them; there is
still the unfortunate perception that permitting pilots to sleep in
the cockpit is dangerous _ even with a fully awake co-pilot _
despite studies that show planned napping to be safer than not
napping. This is one of the most preposterous and illogical policy
decisions of all time.

   Sleep Book No. 6: ``No More Sleepless Nights: A Proven Program
to Conquer Insomnia,'' by Peter Hauri, Ph.D., and Shirley Linde,
Ph.D. (Wiley, 1996).
</P>
<P>
   Quote: Some patients get up in the middle of the night and eat,
without ever becoming fully conscious. In a behavioral state that
resembles sleepwalking, they may wander into the kitchen while
unconscious and eat. Sweets and pasta are usually preferred, but
some patients eat inappropriate foods such as raw, frozen or
spoiled food in odd mixtures of butter, fruit and leftovers
prepared in a blender. ...

stomachs, skip breakfast, but still gain weight.

Cure From Awake to Zzzz,'' by John Wiedman (Towering Pines Press,
1999).
</P>
<P>
   Quote, the author on his credentials: Let me introduce myself.
My name is John Wiedman. I am a mortgage broker with a degree in
finance from the University of Memphis. ... I do not have a Ph.D.
specializing in clinical psychology from some big name university.
I have not been in charge of a center for sleep disturbances for
the last 15 years. I am, however, a professional insomniac (or at
least I was until recently). ... I can help you rid yourself of
insomnia. And although I am not much of a writer, I will try to
present this information as effectively as possible. ...

<P>
   Tell your doctor you are going to read this book. If he is
skeptical about any of its contents, have him read the book. It is
not very long. I would appreciate it if you have him buy his own
copy. I need all the sales I can get.

   Quote: An Orthodox Jew and father of five came in with his

``She used to be an A student and now her grades are poor. She has
headaches and she's always tired.'' Blood tests revealed nothing
special. ... I was stumped. Then, during one visit, he offhandedly
mentioned that his whole family seemed to have a virus. ``Everybody
in my family is sick. We all feel cranky. The only one who feels
good is my son who is off at Yeshiva.''

<P>
   It turned out that that there had been a fire in the home, and

water. Soon after, the wall became discolored _ and they began to
get tired and feel sick. This prompted me to think of molds. ...

   The Canals That Wouldn't Wash
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it was a yearning for a deeper sense of history that
made city officials and developers in Scottsdale, Ariz., push so
hard for a grand redevelopment project called ``The Canals of
Scottsdale.'' They envisioned a sort of Venice of the desert, with
little barges to transport countless new tourists to shops and
restaurants along the banks.
</P>
<P>
   For precedent, Europhiles needed only look about 150 miles north
to Lake Havasu City, where the London Bridge was hauled, brick by
brick, and reconstructed in a fake English village 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But to just about everyone's surprise, the voters of Scottsdale
rose up on election day to soundly reject the canal project, 54
percent to 46 percent. It would have cost $653 million, including
$200 million in public funding, and would have wiped out about 40
small businesses and shops in the downtown area that sell Western
and Mexican-style wares.
</P>
<P>
   The voters' revolt seemed to catch the power elite of
Scottsdale, including the mayor, Sam Camapana, by surprise.
Backers, including a California developer, had spent $838,000 in
recent weeks in a campaign that featured glossy brochures and
expensively produced television commercials. The opponents, who
called themselves ``Save Old Scottsdale,'' raised about $12,000,
much of it collected in jars at local stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are saying, `Enough already,''' Lois Fitch, a retired
teacher, told the local newspaper, The Arizona Republic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have any paid volunteers,'' she said. ``We simply
had hard-core volunteers who said, `We're taking our city back.'''

   Revolution No. 9? Not So Fast.
</P>
<P>
   Despite warnings of a Y2K-style meltdown and prophecies about a
possible guest appearance by Satan, the date 9-9-99 _ the dreaded
nines _ came and went without any apocalyptic incidents.
</P>
<P>
   There were few reports of mayhem among an older generation of
computers that were expected to confuse the string of nines as a
cue to shut down. Those keeping an eye on the world's Year 2000
readiness saw the scarcity of glitches as a divine omen for Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Pessimistic astrologers looked at all those nines, turned them
on their head, and said they would be irresistibly alluring to the
devil. But if the stock market was any indication (the Dow rose 43
points that day), Lucifer didn't take the bait. On the contrary,
most people saw the nines not as jinxed sixes but as lucky sevens,
and lotteries across the country reported a run on the sequence.
</P>
<P>
   Although the West is largely ambivalent about the number, Asia
is far more passionate about its nines. The Japanese keep it out of
their hospitals _ the word nine is a homonym for the word pain _
while in China, it is the supreme number, a metaphor for the
emperor and a building block of traditional Chinese architecture.
</P>
<P>
   Adherents of Mary Katherine Kracht, a San Diego numerologist who
conducts seances on the World Wide Web, know that nine is the
finest of figures, a turning point and a prompt for new
opportunities. ``Anyone who sees sixes in nines is living in
fear,'' she said. ``Truth is, with nine you just can't go wrong.''

   Israeli Court Limits Use Of Force in Interrogations
</P>
<P>
   It was an issue that Israeli justices were loathe to touch. For
years, international human rights groups had condemned Israel for
allowing its security police to use physically coercive methods to
interrogate Palestinian detainees. But the Israeli government had
claimed it could not shackle its agents, not if their techniques
helped extract information to prevent terrorist attacks.
</P>
<P>
   After years of delay the Israeli Supreme Court unexpectedly
outlawed the use of forceful interrogation methods by the Shin Bet
security service, setting off a raging debate within Israel.

   Danforth to Examine Waco
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Attorney General Janet Reno named John
Danforth, a former Republican senator from Missouri, to lead an
independent reexamination of the FBI's tear-gas assault in 1993 on
the Branch Davidian compound near Waco, Texas. Danforth was granted
full investigative and prosecutorial powers to charge federal
agents with crimes if he finds the law was broken. In part, the
choice reflected an effort by Reno to quiet her Republican critics
in Congress. But the outcry grew louder, with Senate Majority
Leader Trent Lott telling reporters, ``I am beginning to think that
she should resign.''

   Clinton Testifies Again

<P>
   President Clinton was back before an independent counsel, giving
testimony under oath in the investigation of Labor Secretary Alexis
Herman. Lawyers said that the little-noticed inquiry into
accusations of influence peddling and campaign finance violations
by Ms. Herman appeared to be winding down. One of the president's
lawyers said Clinton was only a witness in the case, not a criminal
target.

   Detroit Teachers End Strike
</P>
<P>
   It was back to school for teachers in Detroit after a strike
that lengthened summer vacation by more than a week for the city's
180,000 public school students and gave their parents child-care
headaches. The teachers voted to return to classrooms after their
union, the Detroit Federation of Teachers, reached a tentative
three-year contract agreement with the Detroit School Board that
gave them raises and promised smaller class sizes next year.

   Gore Unveils Health Plan
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore became the first of the current crop of
presidential contenders to lay out a detailed plan for health
policy. He promised to guarantee access to affordable health
insurance for all children by 2005, through a number of steps,
including expansion of the 1997 Children's Health Insurance
Program.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's plan was modest compared with President Clinton's
ill-fated 1993 proposal for universal coverage. Health policy
experts said the cost of Gore's plan would probably exceed $5
billion a year.

   Israeli Court Limits Use Of Force in Interrogations
</P>
<P>
   It was an issue that Israeli justices were loathe to touch. For
years, international human rights groups had condemned Israel for
allowing its security police to use physically coercive methods to
interrogate Palestinian detainees. But the Israeli government had
claimed it could not shackle its agents, not if their techniques
helped extract information to prevent terrorist attacks.
</P>
<P>
   After years of delay the Israeli Supreme Court unexpectedly
outlawed the use of forceful interrogation methods by the Shin Bet
security service, setting off a raging debate within Israel.

   Danforth to Examine Waco

   Attorney General Attorney General Janet Reno named John
Danforth, a former Republican senator from Missouri, to lead an
independent reexamination of the FBI's tear-gas assault in 1993 on
the Branch Davidian compound near Waco, Texas. Danforth was granted
full investigative and prosecutorial powers to charge federal
agents with crimes if he finds the law was broken. In part, the
choice reflected an effort by Reno to quiet her Republican critics
in Congress. But the outcry grew louder, with Senate Majority
Leader Trent Lott telling reporters, ``I am beginning to think that
she should resign.''

PARADOX OF THE INTERNET ERA: BEHEMOTHS IN A JACK-BE-NIMBLE
ECONOMY

<P>
   In the modern Internet economy, the race of capitalism belongs
to the fleet and nimble. The preferred organizational model, it
seems, is the Silicon Valley start-up _ informal, entrepreneurial
and youthful. ``Three people, under 25, with a hot idea _ those are
the companies we're backing,'' explained Ron Conway, who heads a
start-up investment fund in Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Yet across much of Corporate America, the ethos of ``bigger is
better'' is flourishing _ and last week's announcement that Viacom
Inc. agreed to buy CBS Corp. for $37.3 billion is merely further
confirmation of the recent trend.
</P>
<P>
   The five biggest merger deals ever came last year, when the
total value of corporate acquisition activity reached a record $1.6
trillion, equal to 19 percent of the annual output of the economy.
So far this year, reports Thomson Financial Securities Data, a
research firm, the mergers total $1.06 trillion, only slightly
behind the 1998 pace. Business deals on this scale have not
occurred since the turn-of-the-century days of J.P. Morgan and John
D. Rockefeller.
</P>
<P>
   The forces behind many of the big deals are rapid technological
change, deregulation and freer trade, which make it more efficient
to market products and manage operations globally. The booming
stock markets have fueled the merger binge because most of the
corporate purchases are made with shares instead of cash.
</P>
<P>
   Such mergers seem to pass the logic of a high-school economics
course. They are intended to expand a network for the distribution
of goods or services or consolidate overlapping networks. The goal
is to more efficiently use a high-fixed-cost network _ whether that
network distributes phone calls, banking services or gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the logic behind many deals is tricky to explain _ and ego,
hubris and management fads are often part of the motivation. Over
the years, research on mergers has found that many fail, as
post-deal returns for shareholders often trail the market averages.
Putting together two large organizations is a difficult management
challenge, business analysts say, even when the two companies are a
good fit strategically.
</P>
<P>
   ``The companies are so large in most of these deals that they
already have all the sins of bureaucracy,'' observed Rosabeth Moss
Kanter, a professor at the Harvard business school. ``Some of the
merger activity we're seeing is defensive strategy in times of
rapid technological change and uncertainty. It's an attitude that
we'll link up with another company before someone else does.''
</P>
<P>
   Merger deals are always oversold when they are announced. A
helping of hyperbole is expected, but certain arguments are
particularly suspect, business experts warn. Deals are often
presented as a ``merger of equals,'' an ego-stroking euphemism
intended for the ears of the chief executive and staff of the
acquired company. ``The merger of equals is a myth,'' Ms. Kanter
said. ``Show me one.''
</P>
<P>
   Another suspect assertion is that a big merger will result in
the new economic math of synergy _ a term that first gained
currency during the wave of conglomerate mergers in the 1960s, a
business fad that in hindsight appears to have been folly. But
today's executives still sometimes play the synergy card when
justifying a deal, saying that ``one plus one will equal three'' or
``two plus two will equal five.''
</P>
<P>
   The hoped-for synergy rarely materializes. ``Most of the time,
it's two plus two equals three,'' said Michael Cusumano, a
professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Sloan
School of Management.
</P>
<P>
   The modern synergy strategy usually involves putting together
two companies in related fields, and then trying to cross-promote
the offerings of each. An example is Travelers Group's purchase
last year of Citicorp for nearly $73 billion, assembling a
financial services empire that includes insurance, commercial
banking, investment banking and a stock broker.
</P>
<P>
   The ``financial supermarket'' is a catchy phrase, but it is not
yet proved to be a winning business strategy, industry analysts
say. A notable failure is Sears, Roebuck's venture into financial
services, which it abandoned in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The big media mergers are partly inspired by visions of the
payoff from combining related businesses. Michael Eisner talked a
lot about synergy when Walt Disney Co. acquired Capital Cities/ABC
in 1995. And the Viacom's planned purchase of CBS is similar. Both
deals link entertainment studios with television networks for
distributing that programming to the households of viewers. Yet the
Disney-Capital Cities/ABC merger has proved to be a disappointment
so far, most industry analysts agree, and the Viacom-CBS merger
faces some of the same challenges.

</P>
<P>
   The business strategy, it seems, runs counter to some basic
free-market principles. Isn't the producer of entertainment
programming better off having several networks bid for his
programs? And isn't a television network better off being able to
choose among competing suppliers of programs?
</P>
<P>
   Is becoming a much bigger corporation a stimulus to creativity _
vital to the entertainment business _ or a hindrance to it?
</P>
<P>
   ``The challenge for the big combined media companies like
Disney, Time Warner and now Viacom is how to make these very large
corporations with complex sets of relationships work in ways that
pay off,'' said David Nadler, chairman of Delta Consulting Group
Inc., a management consulting firm. ``Just owning a bundle of
different properties doesn't mean you get the profit-making
synergies that executives talk about when they announce these
mergers.''
</P>
<P>
   Big companies, to be sure, can succeed in being creative, even
entrepreneurial, if organized and managed properly. Microsoft
Corp., for example, has become a huge company, but it keeps its
software programmers working in modular teams of three to eight
people.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the leading big-company success story, though, is the
revival of IBM under chairman and chief executive Louis Gerstner.
When he took over the stumbling computer maker in 1993, Gerstner
was widely expected to turn the bigger-is-better rationale on its
head, breaking up IBM into a group of smaller companies, which, it
was assumed, could better keep pace in fast-changing technology
markets.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Gerstner kept the company together. He decided that
IBM's huge investment in research and development was an underused
asset that could be spread profitably across the company's many
computer divisions. And he streamlined management, slashed
bureaucracy and built up IBM's faster-growing services and software
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The results have been impressive, as profits and IBM's stock
price have rebounded. The laudatory reviews extend well beyond Wall
Street. The Washington Monthly recently published an article,
``What Lou Gerstner Could Teach Bill Clinton: Lessons for
government from IBM's Dramatic Turnaround.''
</P>
<P>
   Even those Silicon Valley start-ups, of course, are eager to get
bigger, and the hopes of many involve mergers. Microsoft and
America Online, for example, are frequent buyers of other
companies. But with the exception of America Online's
multibillion-dollar purchase of Netscape last year, most of the
Microsoft and AOL deals are smaller purchases, up to a few hundred
million dollars, of promising start-ups that have begun to take
off.
</P>
<P>
   The new economy may favor the nimble, but a paradox is clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dream of those three-person Internet start-ups is to grow
to a 100-person company and get bought out,'' observed Eric
Greenberg, director of management studies at the American
Management Association.

   Instead, Gerstner kept the company together. He decided that
IBM's huge investment in research and development was an underused
asset that could be spread profitably across the company's many
computer divisions. And he streamlined management, slashed
bureaucracy and built up IBM's faster-growing services and software
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The results have been impressive, as profits and IBM's stock
price have rebounded. The laudatory reviews extend well beyond Wall
Street. The Washington Monthly recently published an article,
``What Lou Gerstner Could Teach Bill Clinton: Lessons for
government from IBM's Dramatic Turnaround.''

   Even those Silicon Valley start-ups, of course, are eager to get
bigger, and the hopes of many involve mergers. Microsoft and
America Online, for example, are frequent buyers of other
companies. But with the exception of America Online's
multibillion-dollar purchase of Netscape last year, most of the
Microsoft and AOL deals are smaller purchases, up to a few hundred
million dollars, of promising start-ups that have begun to take
off.
</P>
<P>
   The new economy may favor the nimble, but a paradox is clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dream of those three-person Internet start-ups is to grow
to a 100-person company and get bought out,'' observed Eric
Greenberg, director of management studies at the American
Management Association.

   WASHINGTON _ The presidential power to issue pardons and
reprieves represents the ultimate constitutional act of forgiveness
_ unreviewable and absolute. But as the outcry over President
Clinton's offer of clemency to 16 Puerto Rican nationalists
demonstrates, it is not immune from second-guessing.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 16 were members of the FALN, the Spanish acronym for
the Armed Forces of National Liberation, a militant independence
group believed to be responsible for scores of bombings in the
1970s and 1980s in which six people were killed and many others
wounded. Their original sentences ranged from 35 to 90 years in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Clinton's decision came under heavy political attack
from Republicans and Democrats alike. The House of Representatives
voted 311-41 to condemn the leniency offer, with 93 Democrats
crossing party lines to endorse the Republican-sponsored measure.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton denied that his decision had been influenced by the
political ambitions of the first lady, Hillary Rodham Clinton, who
is weighing a bid for a U.S. Senate seat from New York. Mrs.
Clinton had sided with her husband's opponents to urge him to
rescind the sweeping offer of leniency, saying that after three
weeks they had had enough time to meet the conditions that they
renounce violence and abide by parole restrictions. Clinton, saying
he acted independently, set a deadline, and by the weekend 14 of
the nationalists had accepted the offer.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the Clintons viewed the entire episode as an effort
to maneuver votes in Mrs. Clinton's behalf among New York's 1.3
million residents of Puerto Rican descent.
</P>
<P>
   In a news conference, Clinton suggested that his grant of
leniency should be viewed as a routine matter, one he never
discussed with his wife.
</P>
<P>
   But the offer appears to be far from routine for Clinton. He has
granted fewer clemency petitions _ including commutations of prison
sentences or pardons for past crimes _ than either of his
Republican predecessors, Presidents George Bush and Ronald Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   The number of presidential clemencies has steadily declined
since World War II, particularly since the Ford administration as
the intensity of partisan political debate over fighting crime has
heated up. ``Mr. Clinton's record in clemency matters reflects a
trend that began during Ronald Reagan's presidency,'' said Margaret
Love, the pardon attorney at the Justice Department from 1990 to
1997. ``It had been very much an operational part of the criminal
justice system. Now clemency has been taken hostage in the war on
crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemency grants plummeted further during Reagan's first term,
when a change in Justice Department procedures effectively placed
control of pardons and commutations in the hands of prosecutors,
including Rudolph Giuliani, who was then an associate attorney
general. As mayor of New York City, where many of the attacks took
place, and as a likely opponent of Mrs. Clinton in the Senate race,
Giuliani has criticized the president's Clinton's offer to the
imprisoned Puerto Ricans.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Love said that during the Clinton administration, the White
House has relied less on the Justice Department's recommendations
in clemency cases and more on its own judgment of a case's merits.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, there is little incentive to grant clemency. ``As
a general rule, there's nothing in it for a president or an
attorney general to do anything for anybody,'' said John Stanish,
who was a pardon attorney under President Jimmy Carter. ``They can
only be humiliated or embarrassed.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's offer of clemency to the imprisoned Puerto Ricans on
the condition that they renounce violence was unusual but not
unprecedented. Conditional clemency is rare, though not unheard of.
When Carter commuted the bank robbery sentence of Patricia Hearst
in 1979, she was required to agree not to take part in militant
politics. When President Richard M. Nixon commuted Jimmy Hoffa's
racketeering sentence in 1971, the labor leader had to agree to
refrain from union activities.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's offer represents the first time a president has
granted conditional clemency to prisoners convicted of crimes
related to terrorism, though none of those offered clemency were
directly responsible for deaths or injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Clemency applications have piled up during the Clinton
administration. While Justice Department records of the 3,042
clemency petitions filed during Clinton's presidency do not
distinguish between serious and frivolous or repetitive requests,
they show that Clinton has reduced the sentences of only three
people.
</P>
<P>
   Two of these people, Jackie Trautman of Ohio and Johnny Palacios
of Florida, were convicted of drug offenses. A third man, Ernest
Krikiva of Nebraska, , was a hog farmer who had been convicted of
perjury in a bankruptcy proceeding and had won the support of
family farm groups.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department figures show that, as of April, 884 people
had filed petitions for commutations that were pending, waiting to
be acted on by the Justice Department and the White House. It
remains unclear how the cases of the 16 Puerto Rican militants were
culled from these requests _ although their supporters, including
Carter and retired South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu had been
advocating their release for years.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton explained his decision by saying the sentences were much
longer than those they would have received under the more recently
enacted federal sentencing guidelines for crimes committed after
1987. Most of the imprisoned nationalists were convicted of
offenses like interstate transportation of firearms or armed
robbery and were not accused of explicit terrorist acts, even
though law enforcement officials have said their crimes were meant
to support the violent activities of a militant group.

SEARCHING FOR EDEN: THE DEFINITION OF WILDERNESS IS INCREASINGLY

<P>
   SEATTLE _ From the sandpiper-congested shores of the Copper
River Delta in Alaska to the hardwood forests of New England,
volunteers have been out with maps and magnifying glasses this
summer, trying to find scraps of the American Eden.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly 4 percent, or 103 million acres, of the nation is
designated as protected wilderness. And this month, the 35th
anniversary of the law that allowed Congress to set aside public
land as forever wild, supporters of more wilderness say at least
another 100 million acres could be added to the system.
</P>
<P>
   But at century's end, the definition of what qualifies as true
wilderness in a country of 260 million people has never been more
elusive. And the purpose of setting aside land in its native state
has never been more contentious. American wilderness has long been
held up as a high esthetic, something that has a right to exist for
its own sake, even if nobody ever visits it. But increasingly,
there is a clamoring for open land as a playground for thrill
seekers propelled by ever-more-sophisticated toys.
</P>
<P>
   By law, wilderness is defined as ``an area where the earth and
its community life are untrammeled by man, where man himself is a
visitor who does not remain.'' The intent of the 1964 Wilderness
Act was to rope off a few areas from ``expanding settlement and
growing mechanization.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, the biggest wilderness fight in the country is
centered in the slickrock canyons, leathered mesas and expanse of
rust-colored emptiness in central and southern Utah. It is a place
where a shout is never returned, even by echo, on most days. But it
is also part of what was perhaps the most densely populated area in
the America West _ the Anasazi Indian country of 1,000 years ago,
when perhaps as many 250,000 people lived in the broad area known
as the Colorado Plateau.
</P>
<P>
   The Anasazi, who sealed up their cliff homes and fled for
reasons that remain unclear, left behind thousands of petroglyphs
and pictographs _ the rock art of the Southwest. Wilderness
advocates say the area has returned to a sufficiently wild state,
and thus qualifies for protected status because it now meets the
standard of the law that protects land where ``the imprint of man's
work is substantially unnoticeable.''
</P>
<P>
   That standard has prompted opponents of protecting wilderness to
rush to scar land so that it will not fit the definition.
</P>
<P>
   In Utah, people have been racing through the red rock country in
off-road vehicles, trying to imprint the ground with visible
tracks, which are then photographed and brought to Congressional
hearings. In Alaska, a rush is on by timber interests to build a
primitive road through the biggest wetland in North America _ the
Copper River Delta _ in part so it can then be considered
ineligible for future wilderness protection.
</P>
<P>
   Conservationists have been just as busy, mapping and
photographing areas the size of tiny Eastern states that the
government has overlooked when it seeks out raw nature. In Utah,
they say they have found 8.8 million acres that could qualify as
wilderness.
</P>
<P>
   Implicit in this debate is the concept that wilderness and
humans should have nothing to do with each other _ that people have
no place in wild country, except as occasional visitors. Some
conservationists now say it may be time to allow a greater human
presence in the wild, which could actually open up more land for
protection.
</P>
<P>
   This idea of letting people have extended stays or even live in
the wilderness will soon be tested in Death Valley National Park,
where a deal is close to approval that would allow the 300-member
Timbisha Shoshone tribe to resume what are classified as
traditional activities over 300,000 acres of wild land. The tribe
has lived in the desert for centuries.
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of the deal, which must be approved by Interior
Secretary Bruce Babbitt, the Indians would be allowed some hunting,
gathering and cultural activities _ but only the old-fashioned way.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some inherent conflicts,'' said William Meadows,
president of the Wilderness Society, which supports the tribe's
efforts. ``But we have to be careful not to read more into what
qualifies as traditional use of the land. I don't think using off
road vehicles to hunt would be appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wilderness Act was created before Jet Skis, paragliding,
helicopter skiing and other outdoor thrill sports became so
popular. The law generally prohibits temporary roads or any motor
vehicle use. There are exceptions _ an airstrip in the Frank Church
River of No Return Wilderness in Idaho and roads to old mining
claims in Colorado among them.
</P>
<P>
   But the participants of the new outdoor sports are knocking on
the door of wilderness, asking to be let in. Aldo Leopold, the most
influential early proponent of wilderness, traversed the Gila
National Forest in New Mexico on horseback. In is unlikely he
envisioned a day when people would want to glide over the same area
with nylon wings.
</P>
<P>
   In some places, like Washington's Sawtooth Range in the North
Cascades, the divisions are jarring. A sign on weather-bent trees
delineates wild land from the non-wild. On one side, the serrated
sound of all-terrain vehicles rises up to what is supposed to be an
area untrammeled by man.
</P>
<P>
   In an age when the latest numbers from the Dow Jones industrial
average are flashed into once-private corners, wilderness is
trumpeted as the last hideout from the storm of modern times. Huck
Finn, Walt Whitman and Crazy Horse were evoked when the act was
signed in 1964; wilderness was said to simply be part of the
American DNA.
</P>
<P>
   And later, writer Wallace Stegner memorably labeled wilderness
``the geography of hope'' and argued that it should never have to
prove its utility to humans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We simply need that wild country available to us,'' Stegner
wrote, ``even if we never do more than drive to its edge and look
in.'' The question now is whether the road to the edge belongs in
the American idea of wilderness.

FOR SOME, A SILVER LINING IN THE DROUGHT

<P>
   With good reason, farmers, home gardeners and many others cursed
the severe drought that hit the Northeast this summer.
</P>
<P>
   But some others managed to make hay while the sun shone. Among
them are wine-makers, well-diggers, building contractors, seashore
landlords, apple, peach and blueberry growers, wild-turkey lovers,
cops looking for illicit marijuana crops and good neighbors like
Frank Rudisill of Absecon, N.J., who found an ecologically
acceptable way to paint his brown lawn green.
</P>
<P>
   First, let us hear from Rudisill, a financial planner and avid
gardener, who took ``the logical approach'' and asked for
professional advice after New Jersey announced criminal penalties
for watering a lawn. He found a spray called Lesco Green, which is
used at dozens of sports stadiums to tone up grass for the color
television cameras. Voila, Rudisill found. Instant emerald lawn!
</P>
<P>
   Initially, there was some muttering among neighbors, who
suspected he'd been secretly sneaking out at night with the garden
hose. ``I got a nasty letter put in my mailbox that basically
accused me of being a drought criminal,'' Rudisill said.
</P>
<P>
   But once the truth became known, jealousies disappeared. ``Some
neighbors of mine have a really nice yard, and about six months ago
friends of theirs asked if they could have their wedding in their
yard,'' he said. ``Then, bang, along comes the drought. So I told
them I'd paint their lawn for them this weekend. You use this stuff
and it's like playing God. Let there be green!''
</P>
<P>
   The artificial lawn-coloring industry aside, other industries
have weathered the drought well. From Massachusetts to Maryland,
well-diggers have been flooded with calls. Companies that deliver
jugs of water for coolers or tankers of water for well and cistern
replenishment are drowning in orders. Balmy coastal tourist towns
said they had one of their best summers in years, and seashore
rental agencies were swamped in June and July by people who hadn't
booked accommodations earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Building contractors, blessed with so many rain-free summer
days, couldn't hire enough workers to keep up with their orders and
projects. While lawnmower repairs were off sharply, businesses that
specialize in repairing boat hulls and propellers sailed on
prosperously as boats ran aground or hit rocks on lakes where water
levels had dropped sharply. And pest exterminators made a killing,
as more ants and other parched insects found their way indoors to
look for water.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, wine growers in the Northeast, now about to harvest
their grapes, say that 1999 will be a banner year _ assuming you
like Northeastern wines. The grapes do well in dry, hot weather
(for one thing, because less rain means fewer weeds and funguses)
and the result is smaller, juicier grapes with higher sugar
content.
</P>
<P>
   Much the same holds true for apples. Shelley Page, a spokeswoman
for the New York State Apple Association, said the bushel total for
this year's crop (New York is second to Washington in total apple
production) will be about 30 percent larger than normal, with
crisper and sweeter apples to boot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Starting back in May, with those warm sunny days, we had
perfect conditions for blossoming and pollination,'' she said. ``If
it's rainy and windy, the bees stay home, and icky weather wrecks
the blossoms. The bees were incredibly happy and industrious this
spring.'' With the hot, dry summer, she said, ``there's a great
crop on the trees.''
</P>
<P>
   Other crops that did well this summer, for similar reasons, were
peaches and blueberries. (Blueberries are an early crop, harvested
in June mostly, and so were not as affected by the drought.)
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, there was good and bad news for another crop:
marijuana. The hot and dry conditions were conducive to robust
growth of marijuana plants, hardy weeds with shallow roots that can
sop up even small amounts of moisture. On the other hand, police
and federal drug-enforcement agents who use airplanes to look for
marijuana crops in isolated areas had an easier job of it this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``A green field of pot stands out from the air when everything
else is brown,'' one surveillance officer said. The state police in
rural Maryland and Virginia reported that they were spotting and
seizing more crops this summer. In other major pot-growing states
like New York and Pennsylvania, most cultivation occurs in northern
areas that weren't hard-hit by the drought. ``A lot of yield is in
those places, where everything is still fairly green from the
air,'' said Lt. Col. Chris Cleaver of the Pennsylvania National
Guard, which conducts aerial surveillance.
</P>
<P>
   As the season changes from summer to fall _ autumn's official
first day is Sept. 23 _ the evidence of the drought will likely
linger. Most noticeable, probably, will be a spotty and early fall
foliage season. A spokeswoman for Connecticut's tourist agency
said: ``A lot of the foliage is already starting to turn. It's a
week to 10 days early.'' And hikers all over the Northeast are
being pleasantly surprised to see bursts of wild turkeys in places
they never saw them before. Brad Gunn, a biologist with the
National Wild Turkey Federation, said turkeys _ who are
``opportunists'' as feeders, and whose population is growing
robustly anyway _ are making do in parched, scrubby areas abandoned
by other birds.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of seasonal things, the pumpkin crop is a bust this
year, as evidenced by the gnarled, scraggly offerings just now
turning up in shops and outdoor stands.
</P>
<P>
   And Christmas trees growing in drought-hit areas are not doing
well, farmers say. But not to worry, even if the drought continues
all fall, said Gary Richards of Lasco Inc. in Rocky River, Ohio,
the company that makes Rudisill's grass paint.
</P>
<P>
   ``The product also works beautifully on Christmas trees,'' he
said.

<P>
   BUCHENWALD, Germany _ The Buchenwald concentration camp, where
the Nazis killed more than 65,000 people, later became one of the
holy shrines of the East German communist state. The camp was a
statutory rite of passage for generations of schoolchildren, who
learned here how the reactionary Hitler regime slaughtered
socialists and communists.
</P>
<P>
   This version of history was not without its kernel of truth:
From its establishment in 1937, Buchenwald served to incarcerate
leftists, including the communist leader Ernst Thalmann, who died
here in 1944 and became an East German icon, immortalized as ``a
great son of the German people murdered by fascism.''
</P>
<P>
   But the portrayal of the Nazi regime as the ultimate and most
brutal stage of bourgeois capitalism, and the shaping of the
Buchenwald memorial to that end, amounted to a distortion of
history. The fate of the Jews was omitted, as was Hitler's wide
appeal to the German working class.
</P>
<P>
   Since the collapse of the East German state a decade ago,
Volkhard Knigge, the western German historian who became the
director of the memorial, has been working to create a more
balanced picture of what happened at Buchenwald. But here, as
elsewhere in Germany, history remains a charged issue. The squaring
of eastern and western memory is elusive even as Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder tries to make the recent move of the government back to
Berlin a symbol of reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem exists here, one sometimes referred to as the
``Americanization'' of German memory, a fixation on the Holocaust
that some Germans say excludes an abundantly rich cultural and
political history and oversimplifies the 12 years of Nazism.
Germans are grateful to Americans for productions like the 1970s
``Holocaust'' television series and the Steven Spielberg movie
``Schindler's List,'' which have helped them feel the Holocaust in
a uniquely immediate way. But a certain exasperation has become
apparent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now have many visitors to Buchenwald from the United
States, and they are disappointed that there are no gas chambers,''
Knigge said. ``Before, people did not want to the see the truth.
Now they want to see what they expect to see, and we have to
disappoint them and show how rich and complicated history is.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchenwald, like Dachau and other concentration camps on German
soil, was never an annihilation camp for the Jews. In this it
differed from the Auschwitz-Birkenau complex built in Poland, one
of the sites where millions were systematically exterminated.
Though many Jews died at Buchenwald, particularly in 1945 after
being forced to march from other camps farther east, its primary
purpose was the imprisonment and torture of anyone opposed to the
regime.
</P>
<P>
   Does the distinction matter? All the Nazi camps were barbarous,
and a Jew shot or worked to death in Buchenwald was just as dead as
one gassed at Birkenau. Moreover, the enormity of the Holocaust is
such that its dominant place in the history of Nazism is right and
inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   But another historical distortion would take root if Nazi crimes
were to become synonymous in the popular American consciousness
with only the murder of six million Jews, if all the camps were
seen only as death factories for Jews and if there were no place in
that consciousness for the millions of non-Jewish victims.
Expecting gas chambers at Buchenwald is in many ways to be as
misinformed as expecting only tributes to anti-fascist fighters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The current instrumentalization and trivialization of the
Holocaust in the United States are a terrible mistake,'' said
historian Fritz Stern. ``Details do matter. The concentration camps
were publicly established in 1933, and they were for all political
enemies of Hitler. The gas chambers came later and were a universe
apart. They were connected, yes, but distinct.''
</P>
<P>
   At a time of increasingly difficult negotiations between the
United States and Germany over compensation for Nazi-era slave
laborers and forced laborers, such issues of historical accuracy
have acquired much more than academic importance. At stake are
billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The talks involve the Jews who worked as slave laborers in the
camps, and many non-Jews who were brought to Germany to work in
factories. ``The Nazi genocide system was complicated,'' said
German historian Hans Mommsen. ``To conflate the concentration
camps and the annihilation camps, as Americans tend to do, or to
fail to distinguish between Jewish slave labor and non-Jewish
forced labor, is unhelpful.''
</P>
<P>
   For Schroeder, now trying to project a forward-looking image,
this rearing-up of a disputed history is unwelcome. The radically
different history taught in the two Germanys over more than 40
years complicates unification. Eastern Germans tend to be more
nationalistic; they were raised not to assume guilt for the
Holocaust, but to see themselves as ``anti-fascists.''
</P>
<P>
   The different mentalities are evident at Buchenwald. Disputes
flare as eastern Germans note that when the memorial went up in
1958, western Germans were doing their best to forget the Nazi
camps. The long-suppressed fact that Buchenwald was used from 1945
to 1952 as a Soviet internment camp (commemorated in a small museum
at the site) is also controversial, with some right-wing western
Germans trying to use this as evidence that Stalin was worse than
Hitler.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the question of a Jewish-American ``takeover''
of the narrative of German history is highly sensitive for the
government at a time when a vast _ and still disputed _ new
memorial to the Holocaust designed by an American is to be built in
Berlin, and when the forced-labor negotiations are at a decisive
stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We might do more to consider the German view,'' said Peter
Novick, the author of ``The Holocaust in American Life'' (Houghton
Mifflin, 1999). ``What would we think if the Germans said the
Holocaust is a terrible thing, but chose to build a museum in
Berlin commemorating the American oppression of blacks? It would be
grotesque. The problem is that an American encounter with slavery
in a museum would make costly demands on our emotions, while the
Holocaust is in danger of becoming an evasive route to
bumper-sticker moral lessons.''

to federal estimates, a total that gives the nation one of the
highest per-capita rates of gun ownership in the world. For
gun-rights proponents, the large numbers of guns are a reflection
of a fundamental freedom and a sign of national strength.
</P>
<P>
   Gun-control advocates view the statistic as a cause for national
shame, the easy availability a factor in the 750,000 deaths by
firearms since 1960 and in violent episodes like the killings
earlier this year at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., and
a Jewish community center in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The debate over gun rights continues in Congress, in statehouses
and in the federal courts, where a Texas case may well wind its way
to the Supreme Court as a landmark test of whether the Second
Amendment to the Constitution specifically gives individuals, and
not just state militias, the right to bear arms.
</P>
<P>
   But the fight over the guns, the numbers and the laws often
overlooks some surprisingly basic questions: Who owns all these
guns, and why?
</P>
<P>
   Some criminals, of course, steal guns or buy them illegally with
the intent to intimidate or to kill.
</P>
<P>
   This gallery of portraits, assembled by Sarah Weissman, picture
editor of the New York Times Week in Review, reflects gun owners
(all those pictured say their guns are legal) who offer a range of
other reasons for owning a weapon: for sport, for hunting, for
collecting, for self-protection (against rattlesnakes as well as
human intruders), for sentimental reasons and as a financial
investment.
</P>
<P>
   And one man, asked to complete the sentence that begins, ``I own
guns because ...'' answered, simply: ``I can.''

HUMAN RIGHTS IN PERU: SAVING DEMOCRACY BY THROWING AWAY LIBERTY

<P>
   LIMA, Peru _ Peru is a country of strange, even frightening
wonders.
</P>
<P>
   Earthquakes and floods come in biblical sizes. One guerrilla
group announced an insurrection some years ago by hanging dogs from
lamp posts, another by stealing the sword of a swashbuckling
19th-century liberator from a museum. The last time the army took
power, it stole from the rich and gave to the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Peru's president, Alberto Fujimori. His tenure has
been marked by extraordinary swings in his popularity. But every
time he mocks human rights and foreign democrats call him a tyrant,
his standing with the voters goes up again.
</P>
<P>
   People outside Peru find this hard to understand, even
infuriating; they associate civilian rule with rising respect for
rights and liberties _ the pattern in Argentina, Chile, Brazil and
Central America.
</P>
<P>
   But not here. In fact, when Peru led South America in abandoning
military rule and embracing civil liberties and democracy two
decades ago, it quickly found itself near collapse in the face of
horrific terrorist violence. So Peru, under Fujimori, responded
with a distinctive formula: electoral democracy that survives
primarily by setting ever stricter limits on civil liberties.
</P>
<P>
   This may seem paradoxical and counterintuitive, but so is much
of Peru's recent political history.
</P>
<P>
   In most other Latin American countries, guerrillas rebelled
against right-wing military regimes and gave at least lip service
to human rights. Here, when the military ruled, it was a left-wing
military. The two main guerrilla groups waited for the army to
return to the barracks before they staged attacks _ against elected
civilian governments and the very principle of moderate peaceful
politics.
</P>
<P>
   Both rebel groups bombed public places and mocked the civilian
governments when they appointed liberal judges or circumscribed the
army's powers. For the Maoist Shining Path, revolution meant a
bloodletting complete with executions of officials and soccer games
played with human skulls.
</P>
<P>
   But in the last few years, the two groups have collapsed under
the weight of their own excesses and popular revulsion. And
Fujimori can take credit for defeating them, a claim that most
Peruvians accept. The conventional wisdom here is that he was
saving the country when he dissolved Congress and the Supreme Court
in 1992, held show trials and otherwise upended the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somewhere deep down in the consciousness of many Peruvians
there is the feeling that human rights have helped the terrorists,
and not the victims of the terrorists,'' said Francisco Diaz
Canseco Tavara, a former congressman and a human rights advocate.
``People tell me all the time that human rights are for
terrorists.''
</P>
<P>
   If there is a general lesson in this, it may be that even after
a Latin American country shucks off military rule, the civilian
government is going to have to maintain order; if it fails, the
voters could be tempted to follow the man on a horse (even if he is
a civilian).
</P>
<P>
   Venezuela, in fact, is beginning to look like another case in
point. Sick of the corruption and failed policies of two centrist
parties that alternated in power for 40 years, Venezuelans this
year elected Hugo Chavez, a former coup leader, as president.
</P>
<P>
   In Peru over the last two months, Fujimori has surged in opinion
polls and is beginning to break away from the two opposition
candidates most likely to run against him. For the first time in
two years, he is considered the favorite in next year's election,
even though Peru is deep in recession and the constitution still
formally prohibits him from running for a third term.
</P>
<P>
   The stage was set for this latest comeback in 1997, when he
fired three judges who had upheld a constitutional prohibition of
his expected run. State Department officials, human rights
activists and the Peruvian press protested, but local polls showed
that Peruvians, especially the poor who had been most afflicted by
terrorist violence, were not particularly upset at the decision.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly negative reviews from abroad came last July when
Fujimori withdrew Peru from the jurisdiction of the Inter-American
Human Rights Court after it ruled that four Chileans convicted as
terrorists in Peru had not received a fair trial.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori's approval rating, which had been as low as 33 percent
back in December, rose from 46 percent to 50 percent _ a boost that
was also attributed to the arrest in July of the top remaining
leader of the Shining Path guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   The pattern of Fujimori rising in the polls every time he abuses
civil liberties goes back to April 1992, when he suspended
democratic institutions and ordered mass arrests of union and
opposition leaders. He was called a tyrant throughout the
hemisphere, Washington cut some aid, and the Organization of
American States approved sanctions. But Peruvians were overjoyed,
and Fujimori's approval rating in a leading Peruvian poll soared
from 53 percent to 81 percent that year. Five months later, the top
Shining Path leaders were arrested, and this served to legitimize
the removal of civil liberties in the eyes of the citizenry.
</P>
<P>
   ``When President Fujimori attacks judges, Peruvians like it,''
said Alfredo Torres Guzman, Peru's leading pollster. ``That's
because in the past judges released so many terrorists for lack of
evidence. Our focus groups show that poor people don't distinguish
between authoritarianism and authority _ and without authority, in
the Peruvian mind, there is chaos.''
</P>
<P>
   The next time Fujimori enjoyed a surge in the polls _ from an
approval rating of 52 percent to 67 percent _ was in April 1997,
when he ordered commandos to storm the Japanese ambassador's
residence and liberate 71 hostages held by Tupac Amaru rebels. When
all 14 rebels were killed on the spot _ some, it is almost certain,
having been executed after they surrendered _ Fujimori was again
criticized abroad. But to the majority of Peruvians, it seems, the
rebels got what they deserved.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Southern Baptists on the offensive
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Religion thrives in this country as in few others in part
because the Constitution shields public policy from sectarian power
struggles and in part because, learning from that experience, most
religions understand the value to themselves of respecting other
faiths.
</P>
<P>
   But we've been hearing lately just what a tin ear some
over-eager religionists have for the harmonies that are necessary
to keep this religiously diverse nation humming.
</P>
<P>
   Especially egregious is the declaration of a proselytizing war
by Southern Baptists on Jews during this season of the Jewish high
holy days. Some 40,000 churches have received guidebooks with
prayers and how-to tips for Jewish conversion.
</P>
<P>
   It has proved difficult over the years to explain to Southern
Baptist institutions _ though happily not to all Southern Baptists
_ just how offensive such aggressions are.
</P>
<P>
   Many faiths have evangelical missions. Most perform those
discreetly and with sensitivity to other faiths.
</P>
<P>
   The Southern Baptists, however, have pulled this stunt before,
and mean to pull it again. They issued similar guides for
converting Muslims during Islam's holy Ramadan season two years ago
and plan guides for Buddhist conversion and for Hindu conversion
during the Divali festival.
</P>
<P>
   The targeting of Jews raises unique anxieties. Jews have paid
over the centuries in millions of lives for an anti-Semitism born
of such Christian intolerance of their faith.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, some Texas high schools are defying a self-evident
federal court ruling that, no, of course they may not lead pre-game
crowds in prayers to Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   These faux pas come on the heels of the decision by the Kansas
board of education to drop the study of evolution from state
education standards, first fruit of a successful election campaign
by religious conservatives last year to take control of the board.
</P>
<P>
   The majoritarian misuse of power in Kansas was intimidating
beyond the state. It figured George W. Bush would like it, and he
does. ``Creationism'' is nearly a Republican cause. Ronald Reagan
spoke well of it, and Bush's fellow Texan, House GOP whip Tom
DeLay, blamed the Columbine high school massacre in part on the
teaching of evolution.
</P>
<P>
   But even Democratic Vice President Al Gore was cowed by the
Kansas vote, saying local schools should be able to opt for
creationism. In one craven dive, Gore forfeited the credentials he
had spent a career acquiring as a rare politician who understands
science.
</P>
<P>
   And given their impatience with other religions, you have to
wonder just how the Southern Baptists would use their numbers as
the largest Protestant denomination if the church-state wraps were
off. Baptists historically were fierce advocates of separation, but
the Southern Baptist Convention has instead been battering it in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Not only must the political wall of church-state separation be
constantly patrolled. The etiquette of mutual accommodation that
flows from it has to be constantly relearned. Call it choir
practice.

   1. ALMODOVAR AND HIS WOMEN When Pedro Almodovar learned that the
Hollywood Madam, Heidi Fleiss, once employed a prostitute who went
by the name of Norma Jean Almodovar, he was amused. (And before
that, the woman worked for the police.) Only in Almodovar's
strangely ordered universe would a cop-turned-whore seem honest.
Nearly all of Almodovar's films since his 1980 feature debut are
populated with transsexuals, porn stars, drag queens,
sadomasochists and drug addicts. It's the unconventional subject
matter - freaky characters, sex, drugs - that has helped ensure the
success of his movies in the United States. By Jonathan Van Meter.
From The New York Times Magazine. 1,800 words.
_____________________________________________________________ 2.
WHAT'S DOING IN HONOLULU While autumn is the low season for travel
to Honolulu - the wallflower period of the year - savvy travelers
await the benefits lurking in the aftermath of the frenzied summer.
This is also the time when the Aloha Festivals sweep the islands
with more than 300 events, from parades to a Royal Ball. By Jocelyn
Fujii. From The New York Times Way To Go! 1,800 words + photos +
map. _____________________________________________________________
3. HAIR AND NAIL SALONS MAY SPREAD DEADLY VIRUSES Nail and hair
salons may be a source of blood-borne as well as other infectious
diseases. There is good evidence that standard disinfection isn't
doing the trick and razors, nail files, scissors, tatoo needles and
body piercing instruments are risk factors for transmitting
hepatitis B and C and HIV. By Charles Downey. 1,150 words.
_____________________________________________________________ 4.
PORTRAIT OF GOETHE On the 250th anniversary of Goethe's birth, does
this legendary literary figure have anything to offer us? An
indulgent attitude to past errors, a sane optimism and an
un-Teutonic worldliness. By John Armstrong. From Prospect Magazine.
(N/A U.K.) 4,000 words.
_____________________________________________________________ 5.
HEMINGWAY'S BRIDGE On Ernest Hemingway's centenary, Richard Barry
goes in search of the bridge in Spain that Robert Jordan blew up in
``For Whom the Bell Tolls.'' Was it fact or fiction? From Prospect
Magazine. (N/A U.K.) 1,500 words.

   6. FROM MEDICAL TRIBUNE NEWS SERVICE
</P>
<P>
   (a) DESIGNER DRUG : A designer drug that shuts down a gene
associated with cancer protection may make cancer treatment easier
to tolerate. 400 words.
</P>
<P>
   (b) CANCER RISKS : Different ways of portraying risks among
scientists, journalists and environmentalists lead to much of the
public confusion over their chances of developing cancer, according
to one expert. 400 words.
_____________________________________________________________ 7.
FROM NATURE NEWS SERVICE (N/A France and Spain. Embargo 19h00 BST,
Sept. 15)
</P>
<P>
   (a) INSIDE COCAINE ADDICTIONS Drug addicts trying hard to break
their addiction can take comfort from new lines of work showing
that it is not weakness of resolve that makes cracking the habit so
tough - it is their genes. By Henry Gee. 600 words.
</P>
<P>
   (b) HOW PRIONS GET PLEATED Creutzfeld-Jacob disease in humans
and BSE in cows occurs when a normal protein, 'prion protein,'
somehow folds abnormally - but what causes this prion pleating? By
Valerie Depraetere. 400 words.
_____________________________________________________________ 8.
FROM NEW SCIENTIST MAGAZINE (N/A Australia, New Zealand, Brazil)
</P>
<P>
   (a) The Bigger Picture : Flying could be child's play with a
head-up display that taps in pilots' peripheral vision. Its
inventors say that the display could do away with conventional
instrument panels altogether.
</P>
<P>
   (b) It's A Pig's Life : Pig-to-human transplants have the
potential to reverse the worldwide shortfall of 180,000 organs. But
even if the remaining scientific hurdles are cleared, patients may
face social exile as a precondition for treatment.
</P>
<P>
   (c) Pure And Clear : Genetically modified bacteria are the
latest weapon in the battle against mercury pollution. The bugs
soak up toxic metal from contaminated water and could also clean up
industrial waste. 500 words.

UNFORTUNATELY, 1993 CONCERNS WERE WELL-FOUNDED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PHIL RECORD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I wrote some words in a column on March 14, 1993, that have
proven to be quite prophetic.
</P>
<P>
   On that day, I ended my column with these words:
</P>
<P>
   ``But what continues to bother me the most is the absence of a
neutral party at the battle front. The media have been forced so
far to the rear that they can't actually serve as your eyes and
ears. You and I are simply being spoon-fed information by the
powers in charge. That should worry all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   I was commenting on the siege of the Branch Davidian compound
near Waco by federal law enforcement officers. I was the ombudsman
of the Fort Worth Star-Telegram at the time and devoted several
columns to the prolonged standoff between federal authorities and
members of a religious cult.
</P>
<P>
   I was not alone in my concern.
</P>
<P>
   A number of readers, many of whom said they were often critical
of the news media, also said they were concerned that federal
officers had, for all practical purposes, blinded and muzzled
journalists by keeping them so far away from the action that it was
impossible for them to observe what was happening.
</P>
<P>
   The reaction of one Arlington, Texas, man was pretty typical of
the response I received from readers:
</P>
<P>
   ``We have lost the only neutral eyes down there. If more shots
are fired, we probably won't know who really fired the first
shots.''
</P>
<P>
   It appears that our concerns were warranted. Had federal
authorities permitted a small pool of journalists to be on the
front line, perhaps we would not have had to wait six years to
learn that the FBI had used pyrotechnic tear-gas canisters to help
end the 51-day standoff. Through the years, federal authorities
repeatedly denied that such canisters had been used during the
siege.
</P>
<P>
   We also are only now learning that the Pentagon's elite Special
Operations Command also had sent observers to the siege. The
command oversees secretive military operations.
</P>
<P>
   Those readers who had wanted the government to place a pool of
journalists close to the action were emphatic in their belief that
the journalists should confine themselves to the role of observers
and not interfere with the sensitive negotiations with cult leader
David Koresh or hinder the operations of the federal officers.
</P>
<P>
   But reporters and photographers were never allowed near the
front during the prolonged siege that ended with a fire that
destroyed the compound and claimed about 80 lives.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of the lying by authorities _ and the destruction of
their credibility _ I am not convinced that their actions were
responsible for the deadly fire. That is not to say that there is
no undisclosed evidence that might change my mind.
</P>
<P>
   In one column, I also was critical of the news media for not
taking a stronger stand for the public's right to know. We
permitted ourselves to be pushed around by federal authorities with
only a slight whimper.
</P>
<P>
   I also voiced some concern about some of the behavior of the
news media during the standoff.
</P>
<P>
   Because of this, I asked Georgianna Vines, then president of the
Society of Professional Journalists, to appoint a task force to
look into accusations of misbehavior by journalists and how federal
authorities regulated the news media. I was named to the
nine-person task force, which was headed by Bob Steele, director of
the ethics program at the Poynter Institute in St. Petersburg, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   The task force spent months interviewing many people involved in
the standoff before releasing a printed report to the public on
Sept. 8, 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Task force members were critical of some of the behavior of
journalists. For example, the members:
</P>
<P>
   _ Criticized a Dallas radio talk show that, the task force
concluded, interfered with the delicate negotiations by sending
messages to Koresh via radio broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   _ Voiced concern about reporting of rumors and using nightscopes
and telescopic lenses in a way that could give away positions or
tactics of law enforcement officers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Asserted that too many news organizations ``over-covered this
story to the detriment of other stories in their own communities.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The task force also asserted that the FBI prevented
journalists from performing their duties adequately. The task force
stated in its report:
</P>
<P>
   ``The Federal Bureau of Investigation officials made the
decision to move the journalists away from the compound, saying it
was for the safety of the journalists, to get them further
out-of-range from weapons fire. While that concern for safety is
understandable, journalists have long chosen to accept physical
danger as part of their role in covering important stories, whether
it be war, civil unrest, terrorist actions or natural disasters.
...
</P>
<P>
   ``In the case of Waco, journalists were kept so far away from
the front lines that they were not able to properly scrutinize the
actions of the law enforcement agencies and negotiators as they
attempted to resolve the standoff. Nor were journalists always able
to obtain as meaningful information as they needed to accurately
update all aspects of an important, evolving story. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Accuracy and perspective were the casualties of the lack of
access to the front lines and the absence of a more meaningful and
consistent flow of official information.''
</P>
<P>
   Those words took on new meaning recently. And that is what I had
feared six years ago.

GOOD NEWS IS THAT DANFORTH IS IN CHARGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I first encountered John Danforth when he was attorney general
of Missouri and I was a reporter for the Belleville News-Democrat
in Illinois. He was impressive, even back then.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth exudes leadership and integrity in a way that few
politicians do. He was an outstanding U.S. senator. When he decided
not to seek a fourth term in 1994, the Senate lost one of its
finest members; the people of Missouri and America lost a great
advocate.
</P>
<P>
   So take this to the bank: Attorney General Janet Reno couldn't
have made a better choice when she asked Danforth to head up the
latest investigation of the 1993 Branch Davidian fiasco near Waco.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth will do whatever needs to be done to learn the truth.
He will be diligent and objective. He will not be intimidated by
the FBI, by Reno or by Reno's boss at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   And he will not be influenced by political considerations _ no
matter who might try to influence him. Danforth is a Republican,
but he is renowned for his independence.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth only knows one way to a do a job, and that's the right
way.
</P>
<P>
   That's the good news. The bad news is, there are people in this
country who will not be satisfied with Danforth's investigation
unless it confirms their belief that the government was responsible
for the deaths of David Koresh and 80 or so Davidians in that April
1993 fire at the cult's Texas headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   And here's a prediction: Danforth's investigation will produce
no evidence whatsoever to contradict the long-known truth of what
happened that day: Koresh was responsible for the deadly fire that
fulfilled his prophecy of a blazing apocalypse.
</P>
<P>
   Independent arson investigators determined years ago that the
fire was set inside the Davidian compound, and there is every
reason to believe that the fire was the culmination of a
murder/suicide plot concocted by Koresh and carried out on that
particular day because it was obvious to him that the FBI was on
the verge of taking him into custody.
</P>
<P>
   But the facts are of no interest to the pro-Koresh crowd, which
refuses to accept conclusive evidence that the Davidians had
stockpiled a dangerous and illegal arsenal inside their compound.
The Davidian sympathizers also refuse to believe that the so-called
religion that Koresh preached to his cult revolved around his vile
and illegal use of young girls to satisfy his sexual compulsions _
a fact that was uncovered not only in a Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco
and Firearms investigation but also in a series of investigative
reports published by the Waco Tribune-Herald.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a word to the wise for the Koresh aficionados who've been
firing off letters and e-mails detailing their anti-government
conspiracy theories and their hopelessly fictional depictions of
Koresh as an innocent victim of overzealous federal law
enforcement: Do yourself a favor and stop sending me this junk.
</P>
<P>
   I've heard and/or read it all before. Don't you have something
more useful to do with your time than mindlessly wallow in
nonsensical paranoia and conjure up idiotic justifications for the
psychotic behavior of a child molester/mass murderer?
</P>
<P>
   But back to the investigation. There's certainly nothing wrong
with trying to find out if FBI agents or other federal officials
withheld evidence such as that newly released videotape suggesting
that agents used potentially flammable tear-gas canisters several
hours before Koresh torched the Davidians' compound.
</P>
<P>
   If law enforcement officials covered up lawbreaking or other
inappropriate conduct by federal agents, the public has a right to
know about it _ and anyone involved should be held accountable.
</P>
<P>
   What we don't need is to rehash every detail of this sorry
episode with all the attending political exploitation, media
sensationalism and anti-government hysteria.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth has vowed to limit his investigation to the events of
April 19, 1993 _ the day of the fire _ and that's good. But
congressional investigators have made no such pledge _ and that's
bad.
</P>
<P>
   Here we go again.

   JOEMURRAY-COLUMN _ WASHINGTON _ I'm sitting in a bar after work,
chatting up some big-time Washington reporters I've just met. The

 &HT;    Don't dis dinking around
 &HT;    By Mark Lane
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ I want to speak of dinking around.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, dinking around the house.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to be confused with home decorating. It should not
be confused with home repair. But it does include elements of both.
</P>
<P>
   There are no magazines, no television shows or cable channels
dedicated to dinking around the house. I suspect this is merely a
failure of marketing. More people dink around their house than
restore it, remodel it, redecorate it or fix it up. This has to be
a vast unrecognized audience.
</P>
<P>
   But let us back up and define our terms.
</P>
<P>
   Dink. The word sounds like a straw dropping into an empty cola
can. Since at least the dawn of the century, it has been used to
denote things small, and maybe a little dumb and ineffectual.
</P>
<P>
   Take that verb and add ``around'' to it, a construction that
emphasizes lack of any particular direction, and the result is a
phrase for tending to the small stuff in small ways with an
indifferent level of accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   As in: ``How long are you going to sit there dinking around on
the computer? Isn't time to use it to write something? Like maybe a
column?'' Just an example.
</P>
<P>
   Dinking around on a computer is the No. 1 dinking around
activity of the 1990s. It allows us to dink around at speeds
previously unimaginable. Speeds that might seem too fast even to
allow for dinking.
</P>
<P>
   Carefully changing the wallpaper on Microsoft Windows or
customizing your color scheme (``I'll pick the Desert color group
with just a little light brightening of the active-window boxes'')
exemplifies the spirit of dinking around on the computer. Even if
you are doing it in half a blink of a beady eye at 400 megahertz.
</P>
<P>
   Dinking around the house is more relaxing than dinking around on
a computer. Dinking around the Internet can give you muscle strains
that not even dinking around the garden will cause.
</P>
<P>
   For years, I have attempted to dignify dinking around the house
with the phrase home improvement. Everyone saw through me. The
concepts are altogether different.
</P>
<P>
   Putting up drywall is home improvement. Filling nail holes with
toothpaste is dinking around the house.
</P>
<P>
   Replacing a water faucet is home improvement. Removing the dark
gooey stuff that forms around the faucet's base is dinking around
the house.
</P>
<P>
   Putting in a door is home improvement. Putting in a doorstop is
dinking around the house.
</P>
<P>
   Putting in ductwork is home improvement. Replacing an
air-conditioning filter clogged with animal fuzz is dinking around
the house.
</P>
<P>
   Painting the kitchen is home improvement. Getting the stray
pieces of masking tape off the bottom of the kitchen wall is
dinking around the house.
</P>
<P>
   You get the picture.
</P>
<P>
   Does this mean that we should be ashamed of dinking around?
</P>
<P>
   Absolutely not. These aren't activities you watch on ``This Old
House'' or read about in Martha Stewart Living, but dinking around
the house is necessary maintenance, needed detail work, the
finishing touches.
</P>
<P>
   In home improvement as in life, politics, philosophy and world
history, people who take on big projects are seldom much good at
finishing them and taking care of the details and damage.
</P>
<P>
   Every great project demands weeks of dinking around afterwards.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes dinking around the house actually gives you more of a
feeling of accomplishment than undertaking a serious project. You
get the joy of finishing without the grind of building. A big
project always looks worse halfway through. By contrast, dinking
around the house brings nothing but improvement. Small improvement,
yes, but perceptible improvement.
</P>
<P>
   It is no surprise that the society that invented motivational
speaking as a paid profession would use the phrase ``dinking
around'' as a term of disparagement and ridicule. This is so wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Someday this attitude will change. But that will happen only a
little bit at a time.
</P>
<P>
   Which is, of course, how dinking around works.

 &HT;    Consumer Q&AMP;A
 &HT;    By Jane Greig
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Q: I am a portrait artist. I am thinking about
drawing portraits ofcelebrities and selling them. Is it legal for
me to do this? Do I first need to seek the celebrity I wish to
draw? _ Robert Wuest
</P>
<P>
   A: If you sell these images you need the celebrity's permission.
The right of publicity is protected by most states, which means a
celebrity's persona is protected against unauthorized commercial
use _ the sale of Elvis' image on velvet paintings has been halted
for this reason. Want to put these drawings on the wall of your
living room wall? Fine. Consult with an experienced entertainment
attorney before beginning this venture.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My wife and I occasionally cook with Mexican vanilla we buy
across the border. At full strength it really livens up dishes.
Someone at work had told me there were scares about toxic
contaminants in it. We like using the stuff, and figure since we
don't use much at a time it's OK. I've seen Mexican vanilla flavor
at Amy's Ice Cream. Is there a source of food-grade Mexican vanilla
here in the United States, or at least a brand on the Mexican
shelves that is considered OK? _ Carl Ponder
</P>
<P>
   A: The Food and Drug Administration does not recommend buying
Mexican vanilla since it often contains coumarin, a blood thinner.
Coumarin has been prohibited in food in the United States since
1940. Read labels carefully. Amy's ``Mexican vanilla'' refers to a
strong vanilla taste obtained from Madagascar beans.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I work for the O. Henry Museum here in town and we are
looking for the address for Arthur Miller. _ Stephanie Seay
</P>
<P>
   A: Arthur Miller receives his mail in care of ICM, 40 W. 57th
St., New York, N.Y. 10019. Congratulations! This year the O. Henry
Museum becomes a national Literary Landmark, the first in Texas.
The North Carolina native (William Sydney Porter) contracted
tuberculosis at 19 and moved to Texas after training as a
pharmacist. The source of his pen name? French pharmacist Etienne
Ossian Henry might have provided it _ or was it the prison guard,
Oliver?
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've noticed the use of ``fishes'' more often recently,
especially on TV, radio and print. Has the plural of fish become
fishes? I've looked it up in a dictionary; it seems as if one uses
fishes when referring to two fish of the same species _ fish when
referring to all species collectively. I certainly don't remember
this ever being discussed in grade school, high school or college _
one fish is a fish, two fish are fish! _ Randy Hawkins
</P>
<P>
   A: Fishes is an acceptable, albeit second, choice for the plural
of fish. Often, but not always, it refers to several species of
fish. Guess the commonality can be traced to Three Dog Night's
lyric, ``Joy to the fishes in the deep blue sea.'' But Felicia
Steele at the University of Texas Writing Center says fishes has
been used as an accepted plural since the Renaissance. The most
common plural question the center receives? How to make a plural
noun possessive when it ends in an s. Example: a witness's dinner
(one witness, one dinner); witnesses' dinners (many witnesses, many
dinners). Q: The American-Statesman publishes a column by Michael
Gartner, editor of The Tribune in Iowa. Could you provide his
address so I may contact him with a question? _ Jim Rankin
</P>
<P>
   A: Choose your mail _ electronic or snail? Contact Gartner at
mgartner(at)amestrib.com or The Tribune, P.O. Box 380, Ames, Iowa
50010. Q: Where might I find a cooktop cover that covers all four
burners at once? I saw one in a catalog but cannot find one in any
stores. _ Teri and Steve D.
</P>
<P>
   A: Various sizes of insulated covers are available from the
Vermont Country Store, which is my pick for all life's basics. Call
(802) 362-8440 to order one of the four sizes (largest is 17'' by
20'' and runs $10.95 plus shipping). Notice this is not a toll-free
call _ guess that's one way this operation has stayed profitable
since 1946.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I suffer from total disinclination for criminal behavior and
don't foresee having to take a lie detector test in the normal
course of my life. But I am very keen to take one _ to satisfy my
curiosity, as a hopefully interesting experience. Where can I take
the test? How much would it cost? _ V.G.
</P>
<P>
   A: Just for fun?! The test can be administered by any licensed
examiner. The Polygraph Examiners Board can tell you whether an
examiner is licensed and if any grievances have been filed. Bob
Temple of Austin Security Agency says a test will take about an
hour and probably run you $250 _ a lot of money for an experience.
In most tests there should be only three to four significant
questions, with the remainder control questions. Temple's advice if
you are ever asked to take a polygraph in a serious matter? ``If
you are going to lie, don't take it; if you are going to tell the
truth, don't worry.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have lots of Beanie Babies my daughter doesn't want in her
room anymore. Can you tell me the best way to store them? I have
them in a snap-on plastic container. Does it need to be airtight _
like each one in a zipper plastic bag? _ Tish McCoy
</P>
<P>
   A: Hold on a minute, cowgirl. Beanie Babies are fabric, and the
best way to store any fabric is in acid-free tissue paper in an
acid-free box. Pick up both at the Container Store. Air needs to
circulate. In addition, Kim Blanchard of the Kerbey Lane Doll
Shoppe says Beanie Babies should be stored with the tag covered by
a protector to prevent mangling in storage. Always store heirloom
items in a climate-controlled area (not the attic in Texas). Heat
may cause plastic parts to melt. Plastic bags may trap moisture and
cause discoloration or fabric damage.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The Horns lost in their opener and I did, too. A bet that is.
Now I have to send steaks to North Carolina. What, if any,
restaurants in town ship their steaks? I know County Line ships
their barbecue, but I'm looking for steak. _ Ella Young
</P>
<P>
   A: Pay off the bet in style with certified Angus beef from Lone
Star Foods. The most popular selection for gifts is the variety
pack (two tenderloins, strip loins and rib eyes). Call (800)
880-3161 or visit www.lonestarfoods.com. Your North Carolina
friends will be impressed.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the geographical center of Texas? _ Steve N.
</P>
<P>
   A: A spot in McCulloch County, 15 miles northeast of Brady, the
county seat. The county was named for San Jacinto battle veteran
Gen. Ben McCulloch. Q: I have been using _ sparingly _ a can of
Glory Professional Strength rug cleaner made by S.C. Johnson. I
have not been able to find it in some years. I want to know if the
product is still being made and where I can get it. Also, I enjoy a
lotion put out by Lord and Mayfair that I have only found in hotels
when traveling. Where can I purchase it?
</P>
<P>
   _ S. Free
</P>
<P>
   A: Glory is no longer being made by S.C. Johnson; however, its
new product, Carpet Science, is. This is recommended as the
replacement to Glory. (You are not the first reader to sing its
praises.) Lord and Mayfair is made for the hotel trade. But you can
purchase their products from KMK Supply. Call (562) 531-2150 or
visit www.kmksupply.com. You will have to purchase an entire case.
But hey, Christmas is just around the corner!
</P>

<P>
   _ Need a breather from a constant stream of junk mail and
unsolicited telemarketing calls? Send me a stamped self-addressed
envelope for the address (Internet and otherwise) to get some
relief.
</P>
<P>
   _ Several readers chided me for not mentioning a poem discussing
the importance of the dash on a tombstone. The dash represents the
years between one's birth and death and how these days are whiled
away. ``For that dash represents all the time/ That she spent alive
on earth. And now only those who loved her/ Know what that little
line is worth.'' For a complete copy, send me a stamped
self-addressed envelope.

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: Talking politics with the
Washington elite
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ I'm sitting in a bar after work, chatting up some
big-time Washington reporters I've just met. They're drinking
Scotch, I'm drinking cola. How we split the bill is going to be
tricky.
</P>
<P>
   But it's a very nice bar. I particularly like the location _
part of a steakhouse. The bartender passes along a platter of
little sirloin sandwiches, about two-bite size. Nobody ever said
there's no free lunch, leastwise not in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The reporters are talking politics. I'm listening politics. The
conversation comes around to Bush. Of course, they think I ought to
know something they don't, being from Texas. They expect too much.
</P>
<P>
   I tell them what I always say about our president-in-waiting.
Semi-quoting Gertrude Stein, who was the Molly Ivins of her day and
then some:
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get there, there's not much there there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hmmm,'' I hear somebody say. I think I've made a point, then I
realize I've made a mistake. I misheard the remark:
</P>
<P>
   Not ``Hmmm'' but ``Mmmm'' _ that from a reporter in the process
of consuming another demi-sandwich. So much for meaty comments.
</P>
<P>
   Opinion farther down the bar puts Bush in the same catbird's
seat that Dukakis occupied in 1988, when Jesse Jackson was his only
serious competition for the Democratic nomination.
</P>
<P>
   An African-American couldn't win, conventional wisdom ordained,
not even a tall, handsome, well-spoken candidate like Jesse. The
party had nowhere else to go but Dukakis. As it turned out, a short
Greek-American couldn't win either.
</P>
<P>
   Lest we forget, that was the election in which an incumbent vice
president was victorious. On the other hand, it was a fellow named
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Whether George W.'s fortunes rise like his father's before him,
or fall like the erstwhile Democratic frontrunner of a dozen years
ago, remains to be revealed.
</P>
<P>
   But it's difficult at this point to envision Gore suddenly
triumphant at the finish line, stumbler that he is.
</P>
<P>
   I know little about Gore other than what I see on television,
but whenever he's appearing before the cameras, it seems as if the
man loses the power to speak in contractions, such is his stilted
syntax.
</P>
<P>
   I once shared a table with Bush at an Austin newspaper luncheon
where he was speaking. He's an easygoing guv, easy to like on a
one-on-one basis and impressive from the podium. What I've seen of
him at the national level _ again, only on TV _ I'm of the opinion
that he's ``y'alling'' it a bit much.
</P>
<P>
   That down-home style is better received back home than it is
across the country. Lyndon Johnson, who couldn't shake his Texas
twang, suffered accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it's not so much how they talk as what they say. One
of the reporters with whom I was sharing beverages complained that
none of the candidates could answer the hard questions.
</P>
<P>
   He gave abortion as an example. That's a hard one, all right.
I'm not so sure there is an answer.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I'm least satisfied with the candidate who says he's
against abortion, but he's also against banning abortion. Never
mind that's as close as I've come to having an opinion about
abortion myself.
</P>
<P>
   But maybe I expect too much from people who think they're
qualified to be president.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe too much, too, from people who are big-time reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Whoa! Did I say that? Surely not. Must have been the cola
talking.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Miami evicts the First Amendment
 &HT;    (For release Sept. 15, 1999.)
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ It was more than just an interesting question the woman
asked, it was profound and perplexing. She wanted to know why Miami
does not possess the First Amendment as does the rest of the
country.
</P>
<P>
   She was the promoter of a now-canceled Oct. 9 Miami appearance
of the renowned Cuban dance band Los Van Van, currently on tour
across the United States. The concert is not to be, shot down by
politicians and bellicose Cuban exiles.
</P>
<P>
   The exiles rightfully say they have a right to the First
Amendment, too, but the way they use that right denies the right to
others. Frankly, I thought this issue was decided years ago when
the Supreme Court ruled that Nazis had the right to parade through
Jewish-dominated Skokie, Ill., no matter how much the offended Jews
complained.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, in Miami, those decisions are adjudicated on
Spanish-language radio, at coffee counters, and at parochial
commission meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Clamorous Cuban exiles, in cahoots with their elected
compatriots, have done considerable damage to the community by
emulating a totalitarian state, accepting no dissent, shutting down
what they feel objectionable _ including events that are clearly
constitutional and, more recently, specifically allowable by the
U.S. government in its relationship with Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   In the Los Van Van situation, the city forced the city-owned
theater to withdraw its booking date.
</P>
<P>
   Some Cuban exiles like to boast that Miami was a sleepy little
town until they got here beginning in 1960 _ it was far more
advanced than they like to think _ but what has happened in the
last three decades is that Miami's politics has fallen under the
control of a cabal, elected and self-appointed.
</P>
<P>
   The latest fiasco is but another in a long series of events in
which exile behavior has stifled the rights of the overall
community. Non-Hispanics, reaching minority status, are left to
ponder how much more they can take before fleeing elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Just last month, Miami had to withdraw as a potential host for
the 2007 Pan American Games when the County Commission voted to
remove any aid to the games if Cuban athletes competed.
</P>
<P>
   There have been orchestras, singers, dancers and academicians
from Cuba traveling freely across the U.S. under the existing
U.S.-Cuba cultural exchange policy, but rarely in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   On those occasions when they did appear, bands of exiles also
would appear, spitting at and cursing the patrons as they entered
the theater.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Los Van Van, reportedly Cuba's top dance band,
the argument from the politicians and exiles is that Los Van Van
works for Fidel Castro and whatever money they earn, they earn for
Fidel _ and the exiles don't want their money going to Fidel.
</P>
<P>
   Which is a position as hypocritical as Hurricane Floyd is large.
While they may have prevented Los Van Van from wiring bucks to
Fidel, they do the same themselves.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, Cuban exiles have been returning to the island to
bring to relatives food, medicines and money. They don't even have
to go there to get money into relatives' hands in Cuba. By existing
U.S. law, they are permitted to send $300 via Western Union every
three months.
</P>
<P>
   A not-long-ago story referred to the fact that Cuban exiles,
principally from Miami, annually bring millions of dollars in cash,
goods and medicines to Cuba. While they may think the money is
going to the family, and stopping there, they are blind to reality.
Their families cannot eat the money; they buy things with it. As a
result, much of that money winds up in Fidel's hands.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Miami's reputation _ under constant assault regarding
crime, immigration woes and political corruption _ sinks lower and
lower as the exile community, now in political power at both the
city and county level, enforces its narrow version of the First
Amendment, despite the fact that when many of them were at their
naturalization ceremonies, they swore to uphold and defend the
Constitution of the United States.

 &HT;    Getting some ideas about fashion off my chest
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ Global warming is a serious problem. I know
full well that somewhere north of Lake Erie an icecap is melting
that will one day float my garage to Terre Haute. But it is not the
big news of the day.
</P>
<P>
   The communications breakdown between Hillary and Bill on the
clemency thing is dead serious because it's costing the lady votes
in her bid for a Senate seat, and if she loses the race that means
she and Bill are stuck with a big house in Westchester, a $1.35
million mortgage, and not a job between them. But that's not the
(SET ITAL)really(END ITAL) big news either.
</P>
<P>
   Even the graphic description of 16 different ways short people
can die from airbag impact (I'm five-three) that I heard on PBS
news on my drive home from the gym where I go daily to inflict pain
upon myself in an attempt to live a longer and healthier life, was
not front page stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Like it or not, the headliner this week is the debate over where
or not television personality Kathie Lee Gifford is guilty of
showing up for work without a bra.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, the network denies receiving viewer complaints that
their lady of the morning is going on camera sans restraint.
</P>
<P>
   Regis Philbin, Kathie Lee's co-host, will neither confirm nor
deny the naughty rumor, but is not above a double entendre or two.
``We've been together for 15 years,'' the gentleman quips, ``and
she likes to stay, pardon the expression, abreast of the fashion
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Honestly, I don't get the brouhaha over a bosom, but I must
admit it is not without historical precedent. Throughout the
centuries, women's chests have been points of contention to be
alternately flaunted then flattened, usually by fashion, but
occasionally by self-appointed guardians of society's morals.
</P>
<P>
   In the fifth century B.C., Greek women were encouraged to keep
their bosom in check by tying a wide rag around it to be sure
nothing was going to break loose and jiggle. Historians blame this
on the Greeks' passion for beauty and harmony. Bouncing bosoms
disturbed the delicate balance.
</P>
<P>
   In the early days of the Roman Empire, bosoms were bound in an
attempt to slow their growth, but if that didn't work, the
offending objects were squashed into leather bras called
mamillares. Less well-endowed ladies could get away with wearing a
thing called a strophium _ a scarflike cloth tied around the chest
that also came in handy for hanging oneself in a jail cell should
she be caught plotting to overthrow Nero.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, women's chests have been either ignored or adored,
according to who was running the show. In the early Middle Ages,
Christian women gave up binding and went braless for several
hundred years, but by the 12th century, things had gotten so out of
hand that German ladies were told to cover 'em up, tie 'em down,
and STOP hanging bells from them.
</P>
<P>
   In the 13th century, The Church ignored lowering necklines but
railed vehemently against women whose dresses allowed a glimpse of
their feet. The ladies countered, and the longer the train on their
gowns, the deeper the neckline plunged.
</P>
<P>
   By the 18th century, women were being tugged, laced, tied, and
strapped into contraptions that made the Iron Maiden look like
weekend wear. Whalebone corsets were in such demand that the Dutch
fishermen could hardly ever get home from the North Sea. As a
result, ribcages were crushed, ribs broken, and women were dying _
all in the name of fashion.
</P>
<P>
   But somewhere in the late 1700s, the daring Mme. Tallien, queen
of Paris chic, showed up at a ball wearing a sleeveless silk tunic,
sandals, and NO underwear. The town reeled but the revolution did
not begin.
</P>
<P>
   Since it has long been my theory that wars are caused by folks
suffering from
</P>
<P>
   flatulence brought on by their underwear, I suggest we cut
Kathie Lee a little
</P>
<P>
   slack. Maybe she's on a peace mission.

 &HT;    Buildings go up at Baylor as generation's labors bear generous
fruit
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Either it's the best of times to be a college
fund-raiser, or like a marathon dancer you just want someone to put
you out of your weary misery.
</P>
<P>
   OK, it's the best of times. Just ask Baylor University.
</P>
<P>
   And it's a pretty good time to be renting out cranes. Not to
besmirch any reputation, but with all those heavy lifters rocking
and reeling this year, Baylor is one swinging place.
</P>
<P>
   Almost $80 million in construction has been going on _ 10
projects, including the most pricey Baylor capital project ever, a
$21 million Student Life Center opening Sept. 25.
</P>
<P>
   The center will feature an indoor pool with water slide, ``lazy
river'' and spa, four basketball courts, racquetball and squash,
sand volleyball and a 52-feet-high indoor climbing rock that looks
like a life-form cloned by Steven Spielberg.
</P>
<P>
   A 1,000-car parking garage is going up. A new baseball-softball
complex is wrapping up. Plans are to break ground next year on a
new home on University Parks Drive jointly for the Strecker Museum
and Ollie Mae Moen Discovery Center. The Hankamer School of
Business and two dormitory dining halls have gotten makeovers.
</P>
<P>
   Groundbreaking is on the horizon for the four-year-old Truett
Theological Seminary, now housed at First Baptist Church.
</P>
<P>
   Also coming up: a new law school and a new science building, the
latter a project to compare in scope and cost to the Student Life
Center.
</P>
<P>
   That's not all. Locals are accustomed to calling Waco a
one-skyscraper town. Well, look at what's gone up at Floyd Casey
Stadium. With new luxury boxes and a new press box rising over the
west stands, pair this high-rise with the 22-story ALICO building
to the east and say, ``Look, twin towers.''
</P>
<P>
   To further astound: All this is being built without debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baylor has for decades had a policy and a practice that it did
not build buildings for which it did not have cash in hand or
pledges to be paid,'' said Jonathan Lindsay, director of donor and
information services for Baylor's Office of University Development.
</P>
<P>
   That's no debt, fiscally. But institutionally Lindsey
acknowledges a heavy debt _ to a World War II generation that's now
coming through for Baylor like tanks in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   These are entrepreneurs and professionals who started with
little and made more than they ever imagined, building on a higher
education. Now they give back.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go back and research,'' said Lindsey, ``you can find
tales from the '40s and '50s like, `I came to Baylor with a
cardboard suitcase and all my clothes in it, and Baylor took me in
and loved me and taught me, and now I feel a responsibility to
return to that institution a portion of that which I have been able
to earn because of what that institution did for me.'''
</P>
<P>
   Thus far the baby boom generation, said Lindsey, is harder to
crack as a donor class, possessing a more consumerist attitude: I
paid for my education; call back when I'm old.
</P>
<P>
   But Baylor has to give credit to at least two boomer alums,
Harold Nix and John Eddie Williams, who along with elder litigator
Walter Umphreys, rode home from the Tobacco Wars with much loot in
their saddle bags. They combined to donate $20 million to plans for
the new law school from Texas' $3 billion settlement against Cancer
Inc.
</P>
<P>
   In almost every case a major donor has served as the pulley
needed to raise the new roofs at Baylor. But giving has been
broad-based. Up to 2,200 donors gave toward the Student Life
Center.
</P>
<P>
   Many things, besides charity itself, have contributed to the
giving boom. A bull stock market has contributed immensely, with
universities across the country getting gifts in highly productive
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   A key tax law change earlier this decade made a big difference.
It allowed appreciated stock donated to charities to not count as a
capital gain (added tax liability) for the giver, while the
receiving institution got the stock's real value.
</P>
<P>
   But tax advantages aren't the story, said Paul Marx, who
monitors these things as Baylor's director of taxes and compliance
accounting.
</P>
<P>
   The real difference, he said, has been salesmanship and the fact
that when Herbert Reynolds was succeeded by Robert Sloan as
president in 1995 Baylor didn't lose a president, it gained a
chancellor and a fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real difference has been Sloan and Reynolds (as
chancellor) both out there working hard raising funds.'' He also
cited the role of Vice President for Development Richard Scott.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had one heavy hitter before in Dr. Reynolds. Now we have
three,'' said Marx.
</P>
<P>
   And though the green-bloods grow weepy with pride at the sight
of the gold-helmeted throng that goes to battle on Saturdays in the
fall, another team, 20 full-time development officers, plus a
separate contingent in the athletic department, sweats buckets
behind the scenes year-round _ working seven days in the week in
the fall _ helping raise all this money.
</P>
<P>
   Stand up. Bear claws all around. $80 million cash _ now, that's
a Baylor line to which anyone can sing.

 &HT;    Sites help to find the right college
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ September has become the real start of the new year
for many of us. After years of going to school, September becomes a
natural beginning. If you or someone you know plans to start to
college in a year, this is the right time to begin planning _ both
for selecting the college and for preparing for the financial
burden college can bring.
</P>
<P>
   While the Web does not offer a replacement for campus visits and
sessions with your banker, it can be a valuable tool.
</P>
<P>
   Today, we'll take a look at some of the sites that offer real
help. The first is All About College at www.allaboutcollege.com/.
It makes a good starting spot because it offers a real variety of
information _ links and advice about financial aid, fraternities,
study abroad, student jobs and even some help on where to go for
spring break.
</P>
<P>
   The real meat here is in the section about individual colleges.
At this site, you'll find links to almost every public and private
college. The links _ arranged by state _ take you directly to the
school's Web page and to e-mail addresses for more information.
Don't expect a critical review of the college here. We'll find
those elsewhere. What you get is at least as valuable, a direct
connection to the colleges of interest and a fast way to find
almost any college on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   The next site is a real knockout punch. It's the U.S. News &AMP;
World Report college site at
www.usnews.com/usnews/edu/college/cohome.htm. There are so many
features here that we'll just look at the unique ones. You probably
already realize that U.S. News is known for its reviews of colleges
in the print edition. That means this site draws from a solid
database of information.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best features is the ability to do a side-by-side
comparison of two or three colleges. You simply type in the names
of the colleges that interest you and, at the click of a mouse, get
a very detailed comparison. And, because part of the information
you enter is your ZIP code, you'll also find out how long the
commute home would be for the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   Other features also take advantage of the magazine's store of
knowledge. You can use a pull-down menu to get a list of what the
magazine considers to be the best colleges or the colleges that
offer the most diversity or the ones that have the most
international students. You also can use a separate pull-down menu
to find out about topics such as considerations faced by older
students, what to look for when you make a campus visit and
information about distance learning.
</P>
<P>
   Spend some time on this page, because this is just a surface
scan of the features offered. Most parents and potential students
probably could make a decent informed decision solely based on what
is offered here.
</P>
<P>
   Our next stop is called Peterson's The College Channel at
www.petersons.com/ugrad/. The quality here also is top-notch, with
enough unique information _ including about financial aid and
preparing for college entrance tests _ to make this a worthwhile
addition to our college tour.
</P>
<P>
   Because higher education doesn't always mean a conventional
four-year program, there are links to information about such places
as culinary arts schools, nursing programs and schools that
specialize in training for the performing arts.
</P>
<P>
   One avenue of financial aid for students is the monetary
assistance offered by some ROTC programs. You'll find a link that
will help you learn if that's a viable option.

 &HT;    Graphics world gets new tool
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ They came expecting a new enhanced iMac, but what the
audience of publishers and graphic designers got instead was the
surprise announcement of a new computer built for them.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Steve Jobs, the mercurial interim chief executive of Apple,
had done it again. He used the recent Seybold trade show in San
Francisco to unveil a new development in his company's technology:
a new microprocessor chip called the G4.
</P>
<P>
   The chip offers computing speeds up to 500 megahertz. Jobs calls
this microprocessor the ``first supercomputer on a chip.''
</P>
<P>
   The speed of a chip in megahertz is not the total measure of how
fast the chip performs. The technical performance specifications of
this chip are nearly three times faster than those of the Pentium
III microprocessors.
</P>
<P>
   The G4 is so fast, in part, because it includes something called
the ``velocity engine.'' It can perform multiple operations and is
especially good at handling streaming media such as video and
sound.
</P>
<P>
   Such an improvement is especially important to graphic
designers, who increasingly find themselves working with multimedia
projects like Web pages.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Apple's new G4 Power Macs are designed for this
crowd.
</P>
<P>
   To further enhance the appeal of the G4 to designers, Apple also
released at Seybold a new 22-inch, flat screen monitor. Some of
those who have used this monitor, called Apple Cinema Display, have
called its sharpness ``stunning.''
</P>
<P>
   The G4 will be available in two versions. Keeping them straight
can be a little confusing, given that they both carry the same
moniker, but here goes.
</P>
<P>
   The first of the two G4s is essentially a souped-up version of
Apple's current blue-and-white desktop machine, the G3. What's new
is the G4 microprocessor.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the speed of the G4 will be 400 mhz, with more
powerful versions arriving in October. It will sell for $1,600, the
same price as the top of the line G3.
</P>
<P>
   The second version of the G4, dubbed Sawtooth, will include a
redesign of the motherboard, which is the central nervous system of
any computer.
</P>
<P>
   The redesign will add several improvements, including faster
hard drives, ports and wireless networking technology.
</P>
<P>
   The Sawtooth model, however, is not expected to ship until
November. It will sell between $2,400 and $6,500, depending on the
speed of the microprocessor.
</P>
<P>
   While the G4s are more powerful than what most consumers need,
the model is important to Apple, anchoring the support of the
design and publishing industry, which long has been the company's
biggest supporter.

 &HT;    Even on Web, all eggs don't hatch
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ So, who wants to be a millionaire?
</P>
<P>
   You do, and you're pretty sure you don't have to spend 30
minutes sitting across from Regis Philbin on that TV game show to
be a millionaire. No, not you. You've got a better way.
</P>
<P>
   You have an idea for a Web site.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just any Web site. You're thinking about an e-commerce,
interactive, user friendly, full-service-technology solution,
filled with every whiz-bang gizmo and gadget all the big guys have.
It's a winner. You know it is. All you have to do is find somebody
to give you a few bucks to get this revolutionary site up and
running.
</P>
<P>
   Now, plenty of firms are willing to give money to fledgling
Internet companies, but they tend to want to see things like
business plans, profit-and-loss statements and all kinds of other
paperwork before they will throw millions of dollars at you. Sure,
it's unfair, but that's how it is.
</P>
<P>
   Several weeks ago, Jeff Levy, one of the founders of Relevant
Knowledge, came along with an idea for a new Internet incubator
called eHatchery. The Atlanta-based company will work with Internet
start-ups to help them not only get their ventures off the ground
but also give them the day-to-day business savvy to run a company.
</P>
<P>
   His idea is very simple. Levy, founder of the Web measurement
firm Relevant Knowledge, which later merged with Media Metrix,
knows that even the best ideas have to be honed before you can ask
anyone, even your grandmother, for money.
</P>
<P>
   eHatchery's plan is to give entrepreneurs a grounding in
business practices and how the Internet industry works so ideas can
become companies that won't be laughed out onto the street when
they go looking for serious money.
</P>
<P>
   Although eHatchery makes it very clear on its Web page
(www.ehatchery.com) that the company is serious business, somehow a
``come one, come all'' feeling seems to have gripped everyone from
legitimate Web developers to the people who actually watch those
``Make tons of money on the Internet by selling the products we
tell you to sell'' infomercials.
</P>
<P>
   Calls and inquiries to eHatchery were pouring in, according to
one eHatchery staffer, and here at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, callers wanted to know how to contact Levy.
When they were told that the best way was via the company's Web
site, some people actually seemed surprised this was the Internet
incubator's preferred method of communication.
</P>
<P>
   Some callers to the newspaper were looking for a fax number to
send ideas to the company, but the rules for idea submission are
laid out on the Web site, and if you want to start a Web company,
filling out a form on the Web is a pretty good place to start.
</P>
<P>
   It would be wrong to think the only people who are calling
eHatchery or any other incubator or venture capital firm are people
with get-rich-quick schemes. Quite a few people out there are
working on what could be the next Yahoo!, WebMD or Relevant
Knowledge just waiting to be discovered. Once they have the tools
to do business and form partnerships, they could actually make it
big.
</P>
<P>
   The surprising response to eHatchery's debut says a lot of
things about how people still think about the Internet. Many people
still see it as the Wild West where anybody can ride into Dodge
City and become Marshal Dillon.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the millions of articles devoted to technology and the
Internet and all the people moaning about how commercial the Web
has become, some people still think a Web site is a ticket to
financial freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Don't believe it for a minute. Even Yahoo! has trouble turning a
profit, and Internet service provider MindSpring has decided to
forgo making a profit in favor of expanding the company. Take a
look at the registration statement for Salon's initial public stock
offering. They say, for everyone to see, that they might never make
any money on the Web. Ever. And this is one of the Web's most
popular sites.
</P>
<P>
   EHatchery already has a few companies under its wing and
probably will sign on quite a few more. Many of them probably have
great ideas that one day will become household names to both
consumers and stockholders. But a pile of money and a vague idea is
not enough to make anyone an online millionaire.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes even a good idea and a pile of money aren't enough.

 &HT;    Online `friends' may not be what they appear
 &HT;    By Anne Y. Meyers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Lindsay Taylor, a teen-ager from Dallas, logs onto
America Online about five hours each week. She visits with her
friends and knows how to avoid strangers.
</P>
<P>
   On one particular night, Lindsay goes online about 9 p.m. She's
receives three instant messages. Since she knows the senders, she
replies back. But it's not long before someone in New York is
asking what she looks like. ``Ughh,'' she says. ``It makes me mad.
I don't want to spend my time talking to him. I either ignore them
or put a rude message back to them.''
</P>
<P>
   But not all possible online threats may be so obvious _ online
strangers may seem like ``friends.'' More than 5 million kids under
age 12 surfed the Net in the United States in 1998, and many are
sharing information that seems safe. However, even the simplest
facts about your interests, family or community can be too much to
tell a stranger.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is not like a video game or a TV show,'' says Kim
McCreery, spokeswoman for America Online. ``You are dealing with
real people out there. There are good people and there are bad
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Do not be afraid to venture online. But be leery of strangers
just as you would in a ballpark or mall. Here are some simple tips
to help keep you safe online:
</P>
<P>
   Protect your privacy. Do not give your name, address, school
name, phone number, church name, sports team, arts class or any
other specific details that would allow someone to find you.
</P>
<P>
   Do not accept e-mail attachments from strangers. Viruses that
can damage your computer can be sent via e-mail. Delete e-mail from
an unfamiliar address without even opening it.
</P>
<P>
   Never accept photographs from online ``friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Tell adults if someone makes you uncomfortable online. With some
Internet providers, you can forward inappropriate messages to their
security departments.
</P>
<P>
   You must never give your password online, even if a person says
they work for your Internet service provider.
</P>
<P>
   Do not meet an online friend in person without your parents'
permission.
</P>
<P>
   Remember that the person you are talking to may not be who they
say they are. Have fun on the Web, but beware of wolves in sheep's
clothing.

 &HT;    East Timor wants freedom
 &HT;    By Staff Reports
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's a place most of us have never heard of, but its
story sounds all too familiar: In the region of East Timor, the
people want to break away from the Asian nation of Indonesia, and
now armed groups of Indonesian thugs are attacking the Timorese.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Indonesia announced it would allow an international
peacekeeping force to restore order to the devastated territory of
East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   However, it was unclear what type of force would be sent to the
territory, and how soon it would arrive.
</P>
<P>
   Until now Jakarta had refused to permit outside forces into the
former Portuguese colony, insisting as late as Saturday night that
it could quell the violence itself. However, that stance crumpled
under pressure from governments around the world upset about the
slaughter sweeping East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   Ads target cheaters
</P>
<P>
   A TV ad campaign was launched last week to try to get kids to
quit cheating on schoolwork.
</P>
<P>
   The first two commercials in the campaign have a sports theme.
``Do the work, take the test, listen to the ref in your head,''
they say. ``Cheating is a personal foul.''
</P>
<P>
   The ads are aimed at students 10 to 14 years old. Studies have
shown that more students than ever are cheating.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some are doing it because it's easy. Some are doing it because
they just don't want to be left out,'' said Donald McCabe, founder
of the Center for Academic Integrity.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton authorizes gun buyback
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton is making $15 million available to local
police departments to buy guns that might otherwise be used in
crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been reminded in recent months, from Los Angeles to
Littleton to Atlanta, gun violence is still too much a part of
America's life,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   If the police pay $50 apiece to buy the guns, they would be able
to collect 300,000 weapons with the money.
</P>
<P>
   The president also announced grants to allow cities to hire
about 1,600 more police officers, including 750 to monitor hallways
and classrooms in public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Noggin knocks can hurt memory
</P>
<P>
   Playing football and soccer could be bad for your brain.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists found that young athletes suffer thousands of brain
injuries, called ``concussions,'' every year. Concussions,
particularly for people who have more than one, can cause long-term
brain impairments.
</P>
<P>
   Football is a leading cause. But scientists also reported that
soccer players scored lower on tests of memory than other athletes
did.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the problem may be ``heading'' the ball, but
experts believe a more likely explanation is frequent collisions
between players and players' heads hitting the ground or a
goalpost.
</P>
<P>
   So be careful out there!

 &HT;    New biz magazine looks at entrepreneurs
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Atlanta has a new local business magazine, and it's
called Catalyst. The magazine's debut issue features a lead article
about five young entrepreneurs the writer says are shaping ``a new
Atlanta.'' The five are Andrea Arena, founder and president of 2
Places at 1 Time; Jeff Levy, founder of eHatchery; Alan Daniels,
chairman of RealEstate.com; Alexis Abramson, founder of Mature
Mart; and Tom Noonan, president of Internet Security Systems.
</P>
<P>
   Catalyst also features an article that asks whether Atlanta is
the Silicon Valley of the South. Not quite, the article concludes,
arguing that the city still lacks the name-brand companies, capital
and talent to claim the mantle.
</P>
<P>
   If you're stuck in a Nintendo game, unable to move to the next
level, you might want to check out the September issue of Nintendo
Power. This magazine, as you may guess from the name, features
nothing but stories about how to win games on Game Boy, Super
Nintendo and Nintendo 64. The current issue features tips on how to
play Gauntlet Legends, Gex 3, Re-Volt and Shadow Man. You'll also
find tips on color Game Boy titles such as Tarzan, Looney Tunes and
Deja Vu.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Both Intuit and Microsoft, the leading makers of personal
finance software, have announced new versions of their programs.
Microsoft's Money 2000 now offers a guided interview that helps you
set up the program and organize your finances. Lots of new ``what
if'' calculators also let you figure out things such as how much
you need to save to finance a child's college education. Money is
available only for Windows-based computers.
</P>
<P>
   Intuit's Quicken 2000 has similar features. In addition, it has
added an insight tool that lets you see in place, at one time, a
complete picture of your personal finances. Quicken is available
for both Macs and PCs.

<P>
   IN PRINT
</P>
<P>
   Now that school is back in session, it's time to consider
something artful. There's a new artsy magazine called Terrain. It's

 &HT;    Mad air travelers get ticking
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When it comes to air travel, there is a lot to be
ticked about: runway delays, coach seating that feels more like
steerage and, perhaps especially, the use of the word ``deplane.''
</P>
<P>
   Now there is a site, www.ticked.com, to serve as your caustic
mouthpiece. The site is a collection of consumer-friendly,
anti-corporate rants about anything and everything annoying about
travel. It's Ralph Nader and Dennis Miller with a little Don
Rickles tossed in to put an edge on things.
</P>
<P>
   A recent ChrisCrossings column answered a question from a reader
who wondered when airlines were going to quit squeezing more seats
into the business and first-class areas and cramping the folks in
coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I agree the economy-class passengers are flying like sardines.
I base that conclusion on the ever-shrinking distance between seats
... (which) has shrunk from about 33 inches to about 30 inches. But
there are other passenger comfort issues, such as reduced seat
width, overall quality and diminished air supply that all make for
a claustrophobic traveling experience. But passengers aren't
behaving very well either. A well-publicized string of ``air rage''
incidents has plagued the airline business for the last few years.
Reversing the air rage problem is easy: Just release passengers
from the vise grip that is economy class.''
</P>
<P>
   The site is free. It was created by Christopher Elliott, an
Annapolis, Md.-based free-lance travel writer who writes a column
called the Crabby Traveler for ABCNews.com.
</P>
<P>
   Site helps you become your dog's best friend
</P>
<P>
   Chances are you know someone who keeps a dog chained in the back
yard and rarely walks it. It's enough to make you wonder why the
dog was gotten in the first place, as a companion or a furrier,
more politically correct lawn jockey?
</P>
<P>
   A thoughtful Web site, www.howtoloveyourdog.com, tries to remove
some of the mystery from dog ownership and prevent decent people
from becoming bad owners.
</P>
<P>
   The site is aimed at children, trying to catch potential dog
owners before bad habits form.
</P>
<P>
   It was created by Janet Wall, a former San Diego elementary
schoolteacher. Wall decided to take lesson plans she designed to
teach students kindness, commitment and responsibility and apply
them to dog-raising.
</P>
<P>
   The advice is designed to cover a dog's life, from ``A New Dog''
through ``Losing Dogs,'' with ``What They Cost,'' ``What They
Need'' and ``Where They Come From,'' in between.
</P>
<P>
   Clicking on ``A New Dog'' gives you an idea of the thoroughness
of the site.
</P>
<P>
   She points out several of the downsides of dog ownership,
mentioning that dogs can: get big, bark a lot, chew furniture, shed
and get sick on the rug.
</P>
<P>
   Wall also lists several questions that anyone considering dog
ownership should ask, including:
</P>
<P>
   Am I responsible?
</P>
<P>
   Am I kind and gentle?
</P>
<P>
   Do I have the extra time to spend with a dog?
</P>
<P>
   Do I want to spend 10 to 15 years with a dog?
</P>
<P>
   Does everyone in your house want one?

   Whitney to show art of 20th century America
</P>
<P>
   Later this month, Intel and New York's Whitney Museum of
American Art are launching the second half of an online version of
a museum tour.
</P>
<P>
   The site, www.artmuseum.net, features paintings from the
Whitney's The American Century: Art &AMP; Culture 1900-2000 exhibit.
The online tour will feature works from 1950 to the present.
</P>
<P>
   The first part opened in April and it featured more than 100
objects on display at the Whitney. The part starting Sept. 26
features another 100 works and includes archival documents, images
and historical information about the era. The combined exhibit will
be online for three years.

 &HT;    Mavis Beacon's bottom line: Still a good typing program
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Those of you who have been involved with computers for
15 years or so will be glad to know that Mavis Beacon still Teaches
Typing.
</P>
<P>
   Mavis looks as good as ever. Actually, she doesn't look like the
Mavis I remember from previous editions, but after all, this is
Version 10. How many Version 10s have you see lately? Not even
MS-DOS made it to Version 10.
</P>
<P>
   Broderbund's Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing is by far the
longest-lived program I know. The copyright goes back to 1987, but
somehow it seems older to me.
</P>
<P>
   As far as I can tell, nothing has changed, basically. After all,
typing is typing is typing, and this is amply illustrated by the
fact that Mavis' versions 5, 8 and 9 still are available. The
keyboard still is the same, unless you use one of those Microsoft
keyboards, and Mavis makes allowances for that.
</P>
<P>
   It also asks the student at the outset what sort of skills are
required _ ordinary typing or 10-key typing, in which one hand is
used to enter numerals only.
</P>
<P>
   After deciding how good you want to be, i.e., how much better
than the basic 40 words per minute, you enter Mavis' classroom and
take a test.
</P>
<P>
   I suppose it makes a certain amount of cold, cruel sense to
force the student to type nonsense words; this presumably puts
everyone on a level field. Typing complete sentences might allow
some students to go faster than others, although this isn't a
competition. I suppose I'm just whining because Mavis cut me off
after the first of a dozen or so lines and said she had seen enough
to know how to tailor a program for me.
</P>
<P>
   Evidently I went to the bottom of the class, because we began
with our little hands on the home row, typing words like fasd, dsf
or safd. Mavis was most encouraging; I had the feeling that in
another 10 minutes of this, had I retained my sanity, her manicured
hand, short fingernails and all, would have emerged from the
monitor to offer me a piece of candy.
</P>
<P>
   So you can see that learning to type hasn't changed a whole lot
in 40 years or so, which is why I never learned. I taught myself
(the Warner method) and I can fairly fly with a good keyboard and
the wind in the right direction. Uncharitable editors would tell
you that I average five typos to the sentence, but in my view
that's what editors are there for _ and it would be churlish to
deprive them of work.
</P>
<P>
   Mavis Beacon has a lot more than basic drudgery up her sleeve,
at least on the DeLuxe version. At the media center, you can go to
a practice center and type actual sentences (some of which might
even have some meaning to you). There are a number of subjects from
which to choose, from astronomy to poetry.
</P>
<P>
   You also can get the latest views on ergonomics for typists. You
can take a test to judge the ergonomics of your own setup. I shut
off the video before it was finished discussing my desk, chair and
so forth, but the general opinion seemed to be that only the
Hunchback of Notre Dame could long survive it.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, a whole bunch of typing games test speed, accuracy
and, in some instances, patience. By and large they are good fun,
and anyone using this program to learn typing will find them a
welcome break.
</P>
<P>
   Mavis is a strict taskmaster. You cannot swap in and out of the
program, and the task bar is unavailable.
</P>
<P>
   I would assume that Mavis Beacon has the software typing
tutorial market pretty much to itself by now. Certainly a lot of
typing programs have come and gone over the years, some of them
rather bizarre.
</P>
<P>
   Mavis V10 Deluxe lists for $50 and includes a soft rubber ball
for strengthening your hands (one at a time) and a rather strange
mouse pad with a big padded speed bump at one end. You should have
no trouble finding Mavis in stores, but in case you want to check
out the older versions, go to www.mavisbeacon.com _ it even has an
essay on the history of typing.
</P>
<P>
   I could not, however, find the answer to the biggest question of
all _ is Mavis Beacon merely the Betty Crocker of the keyboard, or
was she a real typing teacher?

 &HT;    When cell phone rings, turn off beeper and smell the cherries
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ To my grandfather, the height of technology amounted
to an old GE television that only displayed colors in pastel _
everyone from Lawrence Welk's piano lady to Fran Tarkenton
scrambling for a few extra yards was one pastel shade or another.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't have a computer or a fax machine or an e-mail account.
The closest thing to a wireless phone came about the time my
grandmother tripped and ripped the cord to the black rotary dial
phone loose from the wall.
</P>
<P>
   A chat group for him was a Sunday on the front porch with my
grandmother. They'd sit in identical cane-bottom rocking chairs and
talk. They didn't need nicknames, and there was no need to check
the connection; it was always good.
</P>
<P>
   Something else he had, compared with me, was time. There was
time to sit on the porch, time to lie back in his hammock and watch
the way the birds got drunk on the fermented berries from his wild
cherry tree.
</P>
<P>
   As I grow older, I grow more nostalgic for the days when life
didn't need modems or cell phones. It was a life pretty much
without words composed of initials. There were no ISPs, no OS to
choose, no IP addresses _ just the sort of life that seems so odd
when we visit it on a black and white movie.
</P>
<P>
   I know that, by saying all this, I risk this reaction: Hey!
You're supposed to be an advocate of technology, not some grouch
who thinks anything that plugs in and beeps is a tool of the devil.
</P>
<P>
   That's the point. I don't think that technology is bad. I have
the usual assortment of cell phones, Internet providers, computer
games, cable modems and even a dusty old ham radio station. I know
to grab a soldering iron by the cool end, and I can recite Ohm's
Law and tell you the difference between a PNP and NPN transistor.
Ask my friends. I'm in love with technology. But it's not blind
love.
</P>
<P>
   My problem with technology isn't the gadgets. There are times
when the cell phone has saved me great misery; the computer keeps
me in touch with friends all over the world; and even the computer
games can be great ways to spend a Sunday _ a lot less mindless
than watching TV.
</P>
<P>
   My problems are aimed at two groups:
</P>
<P>
   _ The people who create technology. What a wonderful tool it
truly is. And what a terrific failure it has been in some key
areas. The model for new technology ought to be the telephone. It
comes without a user's manual; it works most of the time; and no
real upkeep or knowledge is required from the user. Most of the
technology these days comes with a thick manual written in a
language only vaguely reminiscent of English.
</P>
<P>
   _ The users of technology, a group that includes most of us. I
think that, instead of using technology as a tool to solve real
problems, most of us have given over too much of our lives to
living better electronically. We spend too much time online, too
little time in the real world. Our gadgets have become chains. If
you think I'm wrong, pay attention to the people around you who
carry cellular phones to the golf course or Disney World, afraid
they'll miss a call. All this instant communication by cell phone
and e-mail overloads us, I think, creating a world where the
messages come at the speed of light, and every problem has to be
solved instantly.
</P>
<P>
   Most of us can't do much about the
too-complicated-for-ordinary-humans gadgets and computer programs.
We keep buying them and _ as long as we do _ there's no real
motivation for the manufacturers to change.
</P>
<P>
   We can chip away at the other problem: being too dependent on
technology to solve life's problems. We occasionally can run a
systems check to see if our lives have become too plugged in. If we
have, there's always a fine low-tech solution that's still around.
Look for two sturdy rocking chairs and try a leisurely low-speed
connection to life.

 &HT;    Sites help to find the right college
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ September has become the real start of the new year
for many of us. After years of going to school, September becomes a
natural beginning. If you or someone you know plans to start to
college in a year, this is the right time to begin planning _ both
for selecting the college and for preparing for the financial
burden college can bring.
</P>
<P>
   While the Web does not offer a replacement for campus visits and
sessions with your banker, it can be a valuable tool.
</P>
<P>
   Today, we'll take a look at some of the sites that offer real
help. The first is All About College at www.allaboutcollege.com/.
It makes a good starting spot because it offers a real variety of
information _ links and advice about financial aid, fraternities,
study abroad, student jobs and even some help on where to go for
spring break.
</P>
<P>
   The real meat here is in the section about individual colleges.
At this site, you'll find links to almost every public and private
college. The links _ arranged by state _ take you directly to the
school's Web page and to e-mail addresses for more information.
Don't expect a critical review of the college here. We'll find
those elsewhere. What you get is at least as valuable, a direct
connection to the colleges of interest and a fast way to find
almost any college on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   The next site is a real knockout punch. It's the U.S. News &AMP;
World Report college site at
www.usnews.com/usnews/edu/college/cohome.htm. There are so many
features here that we'll just look at the unique ones. You probably
already realize that U.S. News is known for its reviews of colleges
in the print edition. That means this site draws from a solid
database of information.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best features is the ability to do a side-by-side
comparison of two or three colleges. You simply type in the names
of the colleges that interest you and, at the click of a mouse, get
a very detailed comparison. And, because part of the information
you enter is your ZIP code, you'll also find out how long the
commute home would be for the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   Other features also take advantage of the magazine's store of
knowledge. You can use a pull-down menu to get a list of what the
magazine considers to be the best colleges or the colleges that
offer the most diversity or the ones that have the most
international students. You also can use a separate pull-down menu
to find out about topics such as considerations faced by older
students, what to look for when you make a campus visit and
information about distance learning.
</P>
<P>
   Spend some time on this page, because this is just a surface
scan of the features offered. Most parents and potential students
probably could make a decent informed decision solely based on what
is offered here.
</P>
<P>
   Our next stop is called Peterson's The College Channel at
www.petersons.com/ugrad/. The quality here also is top-notch, with
enough unique information _ including about financial aid and
preparing for college entrance tests _ to make this a worthwhile
addition to our college tour.
</P>
<P>
   Because higher education doesn't always mean a conventional
four-year program, there are links to information about such places
as culinary arts schools, nursing programs and schools that
specialize in training for the performing arts.
</P>
<P>
   One avenue of financial aid for students is the monetary
assistance offered by some ROTC programs. You'll find a link that
will help you learn if that's a viable option.

 &HT;    Graphics world gets new tool
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ They came expecting a new enhanced iMac, but what the
audience of publishers and graphic designers got instead was the
surprise announcement of a new computer built for them.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Steve Jobs, the mercurial interim chief executive of Apple,
had done it again. He used the recent Seybold trade show in San
Francisco to unveil a new development in his company's technology:
a new microprocessor chip called the G4.
</P>
<P>
   The chip offers computing speeds up to 500 megahertz. Jobs calls
this microprocessor the ``first supercomputer on a chip.''
</P>
<P>
   The speed of a chip in megahertz is not the total measure of how
fast the chip performs. The technical performance specifications of
this chip are nearly three times faster than those of the Pentium
III microprocessors.
</P>
<P>
   The G4 is so fast, in part, because it includes something called
the ``velocity engine.'' It can perform multiple operations and is
especially good at handling streaming media such as video and
sound.
</P>
<P>
   Such an improvement is especially important to graphic
designers, who increasingly find themselves working with multimedia
projects like Web pages.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Apple's new G4 Power Macs are designed for this
crowd.
</P>
<P>
   To further enhance the appeal of the G4 to designers, Apple also
released at Seybold a new 22-inch, flat screen monitor. Some of
those who have used this monitor, called Apple Cinema Display, have
called its sharpness ``stunning.''
</P>
<P>
   The G4 will be available in two versions. Keeping them straight
can be a little confusing, given that they both carry the same
moniker, but here goes.
</P>
<P>
   The first of the two G4s is essentially a souped-up version of
Apple's current blue-and-white desktop machine, the G3. What's new
is the G4 microprocessor.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the speed of the G4 will be 400 mhz, with more
powerful versions arriving in October. It will sell for $1,600, the
same price as the top of the line G3.
</P>
<P>
   The second version of the G4, dubbed Sawtooth, will include a
redesign of the motherboard, which is the central nervous system of
any computer.
</P>
<P>
   The redesign will add several improvements, including faster
hard drives, ports and wireless networking technology.
</P>
<P>
   The Sawtooth model, however, is not expected to ship until
November. It will sell between $2,400 and $6,500, depending on the
speed of the microprocessor.
</P>
<P>
   While the G4s are more powerful than what most consumers need,
the model is important to Apple, anchoring the support of the
design and publishing industry, which long has been the company's
biggest supporter.

 &HT;    Even on Web, all eggs don't hatch
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ So, who wants to be a millionaire?
</P>
<P>
   You do, and you're pretty sure you don't have to spend 30
minutes sitting across from Regis Philbin on that TV game show to
be a millionaire. No, not you. You've got a better way.
</P>
<P>
   You have an idea for a Web site.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just any Web site. You're thinking about an e-commerce,
interactive, user friendly, full-service-technology solution,
filled with every whiz-bang gizmo and gadget all the big guys have.
It's a winner. You know it is. All you have to do is find somebody
to give you a few bucks to get this revolutionary site up and
running.
</P>
<P>
   Now, plenty of firms are willing to give money to fledgling
Internet companies, but they tend to want to see things like
business plans, profit-and-loss statements and all kinds of other
paperwork before they will throw millions of dollars at you. Sure,
it's unfair, but that's how it is.
</P>
<P>
   Several weeks ago, Jeff Levy, one of the founders of Relevant
Knowledge, came along with an idea for a new Internet incubator
called eHatchery. The Atlanta-based company will work with Internet
start-ups to help them not only get their ventures off the ground
but also give them the day-to-day business savvy to run a company.
</P>
<P>
   His idea is very simple. Levy, founder of the Web measurement
firm Relevant Knowledge, which later merged with Media Metrix,
knows that even the best ideas have to be honed before you can ask
anyone, even your grandmother, for money.
</P>
<P>
   eHatchery's plan is to give entrepreneurs a grounding in
business practices and how the Internet industry works so ideas can
become companies that won't be laughed out onto the street when
they go looking for serious money.
</P>
<P>
   Although eHatchery makes it very clear on its Web page
(www.ehatchery.com) that the company is serious business, somehow a
``come one, come all'' feeling seems to have gripped everyone from
legitimate Web developers to the people who actually watch those
``Make tons of money on the Internet by selling the products we
tell you to sell'' infomercials.
</P>
<P>
   Calls and inquiries to eHatchery were pouring in, according to
one eHatchery staffer, and here at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, callers wanted to know how to contact Levy.
When they were told that the best way was via the company's Web
site, some people actually seemed surprised this was the Internet
incubator's preferred method of communication.
</P>
<P>
   Some callers to the newspaper were looking for a fax number to
send ideas to the company, but the rules for idea submission are
laid out on the Web site, and if you want to start a Web company,
filling out a form on the Web is a pretty good place to start.
</P>
<P>
   It would be wrong to think the only people who are calling
eHatchery or any other incubator or venture capital firm are people
with get-rich-quick schemes. Quite a few people out there are
working on what could be the next Yahoo!, WebMD or Relevant
Knowledge just waiting to be discovered. Once they have the tools
to do business and form partnerships, they could actually make it
big.
</P>
<P>
   The surprising response to eHatchery's debut says a lot of
things about how people still think about the Internet. Many people
still see it as the Wild West where anybody can ride into Dodge
City and become Marshal Dillon.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the millions of articles devoted to technology and the
Internet and all the people moaning about how commercial the Web
has become, some people still think a Web site is a ticket to
financial freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Don't believe it for a minute. Even Yahoo! has trouble turning a
profit, and Internet service provider MindSpring has decided to
forgo making a profit in favor of expanding the company. Take a
look at the registration statement for Salon's initial public stock
offering. They say, for everyone to see, that they might never make
any money on the Web. Ever. And this is one of the Web's most
popular sites.
</P>
<P>
   EHatchery already has a few companies under its wing and
probably will sign on quite a few more. Many of them probably have
great ideas that one day will become household names to both
consumers and stockholders. But a pile of money and a vague idea is
not enough to make anyone an online millionaire.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes even a good idea and a pile of money aren't enough.

 &HT;    New biz magazine looks at entrepreneurs
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Atlanta has a new local business magazine, and it's
called Catalyst. The magazine's debut issue features a lead article
about five young entrepreneurs the writer says are shaping ``a new
Atlanta.'' The five are Andrea Arena, founder and president of 2
Places at 1 Time; Jeff Levy, founder of eHatchery; Alan Daniels,
chairman of RealEstate.com; Alexis Abramson, founder of Mature
Mart; and Tom Noonan, president of Internet Security Systems.
</P>
<P>
   Catalyst also features an article that asks whether Atlanta is
the Silicon Valley of the South. Not quite, the article concludes,
arguing that the city still lacks the name-brand companies, capital
and talent to claim the mantle.

 &HT;    Mad air travelers get ticking
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When it comes to air travel, there is a lot to be
ticked about: runway delays, coach seating that feels more like
steerage and, perhaps especially, the use of the word ``deplane.''
</P>
<P>
   Now there is a site, www.ticked.com, to serve as your caustic
mouthpiece. The site is a collection of consumer-friendly,
anti-corporate rants about anything and everything annoying about
travel. It's Ralph Nader and Dennis Miller with a little Don
Rickles tossed in to put an edge on things.
</P>
<P>
   A recent ChrisCrossings column answered a question from a reader
who wondered when airlines were going to quit squeezing more seats
into the business and first-class areas and cramping the folks in
coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I agree the economy-class passengers are flying like sardines.
I base that conclusion on the ever-shrinking distance between seats
... (which) has shrunk from about 33 inches to about 30 inches. But
there are other passenger comfort issues, such as reduced seat
width, overall quality and diminished air supply that all make for
a claustrophobic traveling experience. But passengers aren't
behaving very well either. A well-publicized string of ``air rage''
incidents has plagued the airline business for the last few years.
Reversing the air rage problem is easy: Just release passengers
from the vise grip that is economy class.''
</P>
<P>
   The site is free. It was created by Christopher Elliott, an
Annapolis, Md.-based free-lance travel writer who writes a column
called the Crabby Traveler for ABCNews.com.
</P>
<P>
   Site helps you become your dog's best friend
</P>
<P>
   Chances are you know someone who keeps a dog chained in the back
yard and rarely walks it. It's enough to make you wonder why the
dog was gotten in the first place, as a companion or a furrier,
more politically correct lawn jockey?
</P>
<P>
   A thoughtful Web site, www.howtoloveyourdog.com, tries to remove
some of the mystery from dog ownership and prevent decent people
from becoming bad owners.
</P>
<P>
   The site is aimed at children, trying to catch potential dog
owners before bad habits form.
</P>
<P>
   It was created by Janet Wall, a former San Diego elementary
schoolteacher. Wall decided to take lesson plans she designed to
teach students kindness, commitment and responsibility and apply
them to dog-raising.
</P>
<P>
   The advice is designed to cover a dog's life, from ``A New Dog''
through ``Losing Dogs,'' with ``What They Cost,'' ``What They
Need'' and ``Where They Come From,'' in between.
</P>
<P>
   Clicking on ``A New Dog'' gives you an idea of the thoroughness
of the site.
</P>
<P>
   She points out several of the downsides of dog ownership,
mentioning that dogs can: get big, bark a lot, chew furniture, shed
and get sick on the rug.
</P>
<P>
   Wall also lists several questions that anyone considering dog
ownership should ask, including:
</P>
<P>
   Am I responsible?
</P>
<P>
   Am I kind and gentle?
</P>
<P>
   Do I have the extra time to spend with a dog?
</P>
<P>
   Do I want to spend 10 to 15 years with a dog?
</P>
<P>
   Does everyone in your house want one?

   Whitney to show art of 20th century America
</P>
<P>
   Later this month, Intel and New York's Whitney Museum of
American Art are launching the second half of an online version of
a museum tour.
</P>
<P>
   The site, www.artmuseum.net, features paintings from the
Whitney's The American Century: Art &AMP; Culture 1900-2000 exhibit.
The online tour will feature works from 1950 to the present.
</P>
<P>
   The first part opened in April and it featured more than 100
objects on display at the Whitney. The part starting Sept. 26
features another 100 works and includes archival documents, images
and historical information about the era. The combined exhibit will
be online for three years.

 &HT;    Mavis Beacon's bottom line: Still a good typing program
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Those of you who have been involved with computers for
15 years or so will be glad to know that Mavis Beacon still Teaches
Typing.
</P>
<P>
   Mavis looks as good as ever. Actually, she doesn't look like the
Mavis I remember from previous editions, but after all, this is
Version 10. How many Version 10s have you see lately? Not even
MS-DOS made it to Version 10.
</P>
<P>
   Broderbund's Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing is by far the
longest-lived program I know. The copyright goes back to 1987, but
somehow it seems older to me.
</P>
<P>
   As far as I can tell, nothing has changed, basically. After all,
typing is typing is typing, and this is amply illustrated by the
fact that Mavis' versions 5, 8 and 9 still are available. The
keyboard still is the same, unless you use one of those Microsoft
keyboards, and Mavis makes allowances for that.
</P>
<P>
   It also asks the student at the outset what sort of skills are
required _ ordinary typing or 10-key typing, in which one hand is
used to enter numerals only.
</P>
<P>
   After deciding how good you want to be, i.e., how much better
than the basic 40 words per minute, you enter Mavis' classroom and
take a test.
</P>
<P>
   I suppose it makes a certain amount of cold, cruel sense to
force the student to type nonsense words; this presumably puts
everyone on a level field. Typing complete sentences might allow
some students to go faster than others, although this isn't a
competition. I suppose I'm just whining because Mavis cut me off
after the first of a dozen or so lines and said she had seen enough
to know how to tailor a program for me.
</P>
<P>
   Evidently I went to the bottom of the class, because we began
with our little hands on the home row, typing words like fasd, dsf
or safd. Mavis was most encouraging; I had the feeling that in
another 10 minutes of this, had I retained my sanity, her manicured
hand, short fingernails and all, would have emerged from the
monitor to offer me a piece of candy.
</P>
<P>
   So you can see that learning to type hasn't changed a whole lot
in 40 years or so, which is why I never learned. I taught myself
(the Warner method) and I can fairly fly with a good keyboard and
the wind in the right direction. Uncharitable editors would tell
you that I average five typos to the sentence, but in my view
that's what editors are there for _ and it would be churlish to
deprive them of work.
</P>
<P>
   Mavis Beacon has a lot more than basic drudgery up her sleeve,
at least on the DeLuxe version. At the media center, you can go to
a practice center and type actual sentences (some of which might
even have some meaning to you). There are a number of subjects from
which to choose, from astronomy to poetry.
</P>
<P>
   You also can get the latest views on ergonomics for typists. You
can take a test to judge the ergonomics of your own setup. I shut
off the video before it was finished discussing my desk, chair and
so forth, but the general opinion seemed to be that only the
Hunchback of Notre Dame could long survive it.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, a whole bunch of typing games test speed, accuracy
and, in some instances, patience. By and large they are good fun,
and anyone using this program to learn typing will find them a
welcome break.
</P>
<P>
   Mavis is a strict taskmaster. You cannot swap in and out of the
program, and the task bar is unavailable.
</P>
<P>
   I would assume that Mavis Beacon has the software typing
tutorial market pretty much to itself by now. Certainly a lot of
typing programs have come and gone over the years, some of them
rather bizarre.
</P>
<P>
   Mavis V10 Deluxe lists for $50 and includes a soft rubber ball
for strengthening your hands (one at a time) and a rather strange
mouse pad with a big padded speed bump at one end. You should have
no trouble finding Mavis in stores, but in case you want to check
out the older versions, go to www.mavisbeacon.com _ it even has an
essay on the history of typing.
</P>
<P>
   I could not, however, find the answer to the biggest question of
all _ is Mavis Beacon merely the Betty Crocker of the keyboard, or
was she a real typing teacher?

 &HT;    When cell phone rings, turn off beeper and smell the cherries
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ To my grandfather, the height of technology amounted
to an old GE television that only displayed colors in pastel _
everyone from Lawrence Welk's piano lady to Fran Tarkenton
scrambling for a few extra yards was one pastel shade or another.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't have a computer or a fax machine or an e-mail account.
The closest thing to a wireless phone came about the time my
grandmother tripped and ripped the cord to the black rotary dial
phone loose from the wall.
</P>
<P>
   A chat group for him was a Sunday on the front porch with my
grandmother. They'd sit in identical cane-bottom rocking chairs and
talk. They didn't need nicknames, and there was no need to check
the connection; it was always good.
</P>
<P>
   Something else he had, compared with me, was time. There was
time to sit on the porch, time to lie back in his hammock and watch
the way the birds got drunk on the fermented berries from his wild
cherry tree.
</P>
<P>
   As I grow older, I grow more nostalgic for the days when life
didn't need modems or cell phones. It was a life pretty much
without words composed of initials. There were no ISPs, no OS to
choose, no IP addresses _ just the sort of life that seems so odd
when we visit it on a black and white movie.
</P>
<P>
   I know that, by saying all this, I risk this reaction: Hey!
You're supposed to be an advocate of technology, not some grouch
who thinks anything that plugs in and beeps is a tool of the devil.
</P>
<P>
   That's the point. I don't think that technology is bad. I have
the usual assortment of cell phones, Internet providers, computer
games, cable modems and even a dusty old ham radio station. I know
to grab a soldering iron by the cool end, and I can recite Ohm's
Law and tell you the difference between a PNP and NPN transistor.
Ask my friends. I'm in love with technology. But it's not blind
love.
</P>
<P>
   My problem with technology isn't the gadgets. There are times
when the cell phone has saved me great misery; the computer keeps
me in touch with friends all over the world; and even the computer
games can be great ways to spend a Sunday _ a lot less mindless
than watching TV.
</P>
<P>
   My problems are aimed at two groups:
</P>
<P>
   _ The people who create technology. What a wonderful tool it
truly is. And what a terrific failure it has been in some key
areas. The model for new technology ought to be the telephone. It
comes without a user's manual; it works most of the time; and no
real upkeep or knowledge is required from the user. Most of the
technology these days comes with a thick manual written in a
language only vaguely reminiscent of English.
</P>
<P>
   _ The users of technology, a group that includes most of us. I
think that, instead of using technology as a tool to solve real
problems, most of us have given over too much of our lives to
living better electronically. We spend too much time online, too
little time in the real world. Our gadgets have become chains. If
you think I'm wrong, pay attention to the people around you who
carry cellular phones to the golf course or Disney World, afraid
they'll miss a call. All this instant communication by cell phone
and e-mail overloads us, I think, creating a world where the
messages come at the speed of light, and every problem has to be
solved instantly.
</P>
<P>
   Most of us can't do much about the
too-complicated-for-ordinary-humans gadgets and computer programs.
We keep buying them and _ as long as we do _ there's no real
motivation for the manufacturers to change.
</P>
<P>
   We can chip away at the other problem: being too dependent on
technology to solve life's problems. We occasionally can run a
systems check to see if our lives have become too plugged in. If we
have, there's always a fine low-tech solution that's still around.
Look for two sturdy rocking chairs and try a leisurely low-speed
connection to life.

 &HT;    After 20 years, still waiting for better TVBy Diane Holloway
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service AUSTIN, Texas _ The first time I covered
<TEXT>
the fall TV season, there were 21 new series on three networks.
Some shows were good, some were awful. Only two lasted the entire
season. One was put out of its misery after three weeks.
<P>
   That was in 1979, way back when cable wasn't a factor and Fox,
WB and UPN didn't exist. This is my 20th anniversary as a TV
critic, the 20th time I've previewed the new fall TV shows. Every
year I get excited; most years, my hopes are dashed.
</P>
<P>
   In the next few weeks, we'll see 38 new series on six broadcast
networks _ and a few more on the various cable networks. That's in
addition to the growing number of syndicated series. And some are
good, some are awful and many are destined to fail.
</P>
<P>
   Are we couch potatoes better off now than we were then? We
certainly have more choices, but do we want any of those choices?
</P>
<P>
   Sitcoms are cruder and dramas are racier now. That's the most
noticeable change in our ``progress'' over the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
   A sitcom like Fox's new ``Action,'' riddled with bleeped out
F-words, wouldn't have gotten past the idea stage, let alone on the
air 20 years ago. The top-rated sitcom in 1979 was ``Three's
Company,'' which seems innocent now but was blasted for its double
entendres. Other popular comedies were ``MASH,'' ``Alice'' and the
``Alice'' spinoff ``Flo.'' Not exactly ``South Park.''
</P>
<P>
   The red-hot drama was ``Dallas,'' featuring the deliciously evil
J.R. Ewing. But he seems tame now. Why were we so shocked when J.R.
cheated on Sue Ellen, swindled Bobby and duped Miss Ellie? That was
before ``Melrose Place,'' ``Dawson's Creek'' and this season's
ultra-tawdry teen sex show, ``Manchester Prep.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, yeah. Times have changed. The most popular network dramas
are the hard-charging, adult series like ``ER,'' ``NYPD Blue'' and
``Law &AMP; Order.'' Writers strive for reality, but apparently reality
bites: Language is saltier and violence is grislier. People aren't
just shot and stabbed _ they're shot in the face and disemboweled.
</P>
<P>
   Besides ``Dallas,'' the popular dramas in '79 were ``The Dukes
of Hazzard,'' ``Eight Is Enough'' and ``Little House on the
Prairie.'' All would be TV-G.
</P>
<P>
   Of the series that debuted in the fall of '79, one was superb.
Not surprisingly, it was canceled within a month. ``The
Associates'' was a comedy about a snobby law firm headed by Wilfred
Hyde-White. Co-stars were Martin Short, Alley Mills and Joe
Regalbuto. B.B. King sang the theme song. It was first-rate all the
way, but ABC pulled the plug.
</P>
<P>
   That's a familiar problem, a thread that unites decades of
network programming. I still remember (and sometimes even mourn)
several fine shows that were killed before viewers found them _
``Palmerstown U.S.A.,'' ``Frank's Place,'' ``I'll Fly Away,'' ``The
Famous Teddy Z,'' ``Call to Glory,'' to name just a few.
</P>
<P>
   Another change in the past 20 years is the onslaught of
newsmagazines. This fall there are a dozen hours devoted to
newsmagazines. In '79, ``60 Minutes'' and ``20/20'' each had a
single episode a week. ``Dateline NBC,'' which now gobbles up five
hours of prime time, didn't exist until 1992. ``Primetime Sunday,''
the first of NBC's many failed attempts before ``Dateline,''
debuted in '79 with Tom Snyder as host.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the stars of this fall's new series are newcomers. Most
of the stars of '79's new series were well-known, including Eileen
Brennan, Brian Dennehy, Louis Gossett Jr., Jack Elam, Shirley
Jones, Joe Don Baker, James Earl Jones, Jim Belushi, Michael Keaton
and Robert Conrad. TV executives now prefer to hire cheap unknowns
and make them stars.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a trivia tidbit: Dixie Carter played an angel in '79's
new sitcom ``Out of the Blue''; this fall she co-stars in a new
drama, ``Family Law.'' In between, she had the long-running hit
``Designing Women.'' Talk about staying power. Another TV star with
``legs,'' as they say, is Doris Roberts of ``Everybody Loves
Raymond.'' In '79, she co-starred in the new sitcom ``Angie.''
</P>
<P>
   We won't know for a few weeks what this year's big disasters
are, but the fall of '79 produced a trio of notable flops. ``The
Ropers,'' a lackluster spinoff of ``Three's Company,'' was the
first to croak. McLean Stevenson left ``MASH'' to star in ``Hello,
Larry,'' which barely lasted until Christmas. And the wildly
successful ``Columbo'' spawned ``Kate Loves a Mystery,'' starring
Kate Mulgrew as the detective's wife. The spinoff collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   By my calculation, I've seen at least 500 fall previews over the
years. That excludes midseason series, movies and miniseries. You'd
think I'd be visually impaired and crazy by now. I still have my
eyesight, but my sanity, well, that's questionable.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, television has changed a lot. We're up to our
ears in cable channels and on the cusp of the digital revolution,
facing an even bigger explosion of choices. But with the exception
of a few bad words and more gruesome violence, the programs that
spill out of the box haven't changed that much. Maybe they will in
the next millennium.
</P>
<P>
   TUNE IN: Rerun season is almost over! Fox's amusingly gritty new
family drama ``Get Real'' airs its pilot again tonight at 7 and
then moves to its regular slot Wednesday at 8. Debrah Farantino and
Jon Tenney star as an estranged duo with a trio of teens ... Beau
Bridges plays the colorful circus entrepreneur in the conclusion of
A&AMP;E's two-part ``P.T. Barnum,'' tonight at 7 ... ``Journey to the
Center of the Earth,'' a two-parter based on the Jules Verne novel
and starring Treat Williams, airs Tuesday and Wednesday at 7 p.m.
on USA ... Fox's foul language-bleeped sitcom ``Action,'' starring
Jay Mohr as a slimy Hollywood producer, debuts Thursday at 8 p.m.
... And ``A Slight Case of Murder,'' a truly wonderful comedy-drama
starring William H. Macy, debuts Sunday at 7 p.m. on TNT.
</P>
<P>
   TUNE OUT: Just when you thought it was safe to watch TV again
... NBC's ``World's Most Amazing Videos,'' Wednesday at 8, shows a
bull kicking a man into the air and a racehorse instigating a
multihorse pile-up on the track ... You'll want to be sure to miss
the second season premiere of Fox's ``World's Wildest Police
Videos,'' Thursday at 7 p.m. ... And Pamela Anderson Lee's fabulous
feature ``Barb Wire'' airs at 8 p.m. on the Sci-Fi Channel.

PUFF DADDY GOES POOF
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He compared himself with Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   He said he would last forever.
</P>
<P>
   He hinted that some day he might run for president.
</P>
<P>
   And he called himself the black Sinatra.
</P>
<P>
   But after just three weeks into his campaign to recapture the
charts, about all Sean ``Puffy'' Combs is looking for is to sell
some CDs. Quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forever,'' the second CD by the New York
rapper/producer/fashion plate/entrepreneur/multimillionaire, is not
doing nearly as well as was predicted, or hyped.
</P>
<P>
   Released Aug. 17, it sold 205,000 copies its first week,
according to SoundScan. By the second week, sales were nearly half
that, 119,000 copies.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of more than 200,000 copies are certainly respectable, but
this is an era when superstars from Ricky Martin to Garth Brooks to
the Backstreet Boys have sold more than 500,000 copies their first
week.
</P>
<P>
   Which is about 300,000 copies less than Puff's 1997 debut, ``No
Way Out,'' sold its first week.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more troubling, the CD debuted on the national R&AMP;B
charts at No. 87, a horrible showing in the very market he was
dominating the last time out.
</P>
<P>
   What happened? Well, the first problem is that ``Forever'' is
simply not nearly as good as ``No Way Out'': A collection of empty
boasts and threats, it finds Puffy lost amid a sea of guest artists
and railing on and on about unidentified foes who would unseat him
from his position of power.
</P>
<P>
   It's the sort of CD that practically begs usage of the word
``disaster,'' and predictably enough it has received negative
reviews from numerous major publications, ranging from ``The
Philadelphia Inquirer'' to ``People.''
</P>
<P>
   But does the hip-hop nation really care about what Tom Moon or I
have to say about Puffy? Probably not.
</P>
<P>
   Truth is, ``Forever'' isn't doing especially well partially
because of the transitory, here-today-gone-today nature of pop
music, and partially because the first single, ``P.E. 2000,''
didn't light anybody's fire.
</P>
<P>
   But a big part of Puffy's sales woes of late are because he's
simply an easy guy to dislike. He faces the world with a grim,
unsmiling face, his eyes usually hidden behind shades. Many rappers
have acknowledged a stylistic debt to the Italian gangsters of film
and TV (that's where the very term comes from, after all) and Puff
has always seemed cold, remote, unfriendly, with a musical
personality that's one part braggart and one part whiner. It's hard
to decide which is more ridiculous: Comparing himself with Jesus or
with Sinatra, but both speak volumes about his seemingly complete
lack of taste or humility.
</P>
<P>
   And, really, who needs to listen to that? To a very rich man who
just cannot turn loose of playing the
gangster/outlaw/put-upon-homeboy card, even though he's obviously
living in a completely different world?
</P>
<P>
   Some will, of course: ``Forever'' will no doubt sell more than 1
million copies, maybe more. And it's certainly possible that the
just-released second single, ``Satisfy You'' (a duet with R.
Kelly), could boost sales significantly; it is one of the CD's
bright spots, and Kelly is still hot as a pistol.
</P>
<P>
   But it appears that a whole lot of people have sized up the
Puff, seen his act, grown tired of the constant boasts, heard what
he has to say (and tends to say over and over and over) and moved
on. It's hard to blame them.

THE `NINTH' WONDER OF THE MUSIC WORLD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WAYNE LEE GAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One spring day in Vienna in 1824, music changed forever.
</P>
<P>
   Ludwig van Beethoven, cantankerous, deaf, depressed and less
than three years away from the grave, gave the world his Symphony
No. 9, a masterpiece encapsulating the most noble aspirations of
humanity, a work that defines _ better than science or theology can
_ the universe and our place in it.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone knows the story of its premiere: Beethoven, seated on
the stage and facing away from the audience to assist the conductor
(by the standards of the time, the piece was considered difficult
to the point of unperformability), was oblivious to the
overwhelming applause until a singer turned him around to face the
appreciative throng.
</P>
<P>
   Beethoven's Ninth has been at the top of the all-time hit parade
ever since, and for good reason. Few orchestras can allow more than
one or two seasons to pass without presenting it; the Dallas
Symphony will perform it as the opening item on its 1999-2000
classical subscription series Thursday through Sept. 19 at the
Morton H. Meyerson Symphony Center. The Fort Worth Symphony and
conductor John Giordano will showcase its most famous and beloved
section, the fourth movement, at the climax of its New Year's Eve
concert at Bass Performance Hall. It's hard to imagine a better way
to spend the final moments of the millennium than hearing one of
Western civilization's greatest achievements performed in North
America's most beautiful concert hall.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons for the popularity of the piece are manifold.
Historically, it was the first choral symphony; before then, a
symphony was limited to instrumental work. Mendelssohn, Mahler,
Berlioz, Vaughan Williams, Holst, Shostakovich and countless lesser
figures have since followed Beethoven's example by including chorus
in a work officially designated as a ``symphony''; none has
approached Beethoven's Ninth in popularity and audience acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   Even composers who never wrote a ``choral'' symphony were deeply
influenced by its structure and its broadening of music's subject
matter. Handel, Haydn and J.S. Bach had made obvious motions toward
a transcendent, universal vision in their oratorios, but never with
the boldness of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. After Beethoven's
Ninth, composers were liberated to expand form and subject matter
as never before.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not its place in the history books that makes audiences
clamor for Beethoven's Ninth again and again.
</P>
<P>
   First, it's the simple but superb material: infectious, hummable
melodies that flow one from another, arranged in a recognizable,
analyzable, solidly logical musical architecture.
</P>
<P>
   This material, however, is loaded with surprises and
originality. For instance, the electric liveliness of the opening
passages, the audacious timpani solos in the vivace second movement
_ and the reiteration of material from previous movements at the
beginning of the Finale, a structural innovation that echoed
throughout the 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   And oh, that choral finale, popularly known as the ``Ode to
Joy,'' after the poem by Friedrich von Schiller from whence it
draws its text. An opening pronouncement calls for a higher level
of music-making _ ``O friends, not these tones! Let us raise our
voices together in more pleasant and cheerful tones!''
</P>
<P>
   Humor, joy, a Turkish march and what Vaughan Williams once
described as the song of a tipsy Welsh soldier follow _ in music
that suggests all humankind, accompanied by the spinning of the
stars, raising a collective voice in praise of a benevolent
creator. There's no plot, but there's indescribable drama.
</P>
<P>
   The reputation for unperformability _ not so much of the
orchestral parts, but of the vocal writing _ lingered for over a
century. It has been speculated that Beethoven, already deaf, was
out of touch with the practical difficulties singers face. The
sopranos _ the soloist and those in the chorus _ get a particularly
difficult assignment in an uncomfortable range. But our modern
symphonic choirs and well-trained oratorio singers have, in my
experience, pretty well learned to overcome the technical hurdles
Beethoven gave them.
</P>
<P>
   And, when modern Euro-American civilization with all its horrors
and errors is judged by posterity, some accomplishments will help
to redeem us. Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, the creation of an ugly,
bad-tempered, barely functional fellow, will be recognized as one
of these enduring achievements.

MILITARY'S ROLE AT SIEGE NEAR WACO TO BE FOCUS OF INQUIRY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER AUTREY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The images of Bradley fighting vehicles punching holes in the
wooden compound of the Branch Davidian sect and of helicopters
hovering overhead as the structure burned have become etched in
America's collective psyche.
</P>
<P>
   The extent and legality of the military involvement in the
51-day siege at the Mount Carmel compound near Waco six years ago
is expected to be a focus of upcoming investigations into the fiery
end of the siege on April 19, 1993. The bodies of sect leader David
Koresh and about 80 of his followers were recovered in the fire's
remains.
</P>
<P>
   Among questions surrounding the operation is how military
personnel, equipment and munitions were used and whether the
government had a role in setting the blaze that consumed the
compound. At the heart of the questions about military involvement
is the Posse Comitatus Act, which prohibits the armed forces from
participating in civilian law enforcement operations.
</P>
<P>
   Some issues expected to be examined are:
</P>
<P>
   _ The involvement of the Delta Force, an elite, top-secret Army
unit established to combat terrorism. Some former government
officials say the Delta Force had a greater role in the operation
than the FBI acknowledges and, as a result, violated the Posse
Comitatus Act.
</P>
<P>
   In a sworn affidavit, a former sergeant first class in Army
Special Forces said a noncommissioned officer told him that the
Delta Force's ``B'' Squadron had been ordered to ``take down'' the
Branch Davidians at Mount Carmel.
</P>
<P>
   _ Whether federal officials used a 1990 change in the Posse
Comitatus Act _ allowing the use of the military in anti-drug
operations _ to assist the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms
and the FBI in the Waco siege and assault.
</P>
<P>
   When the ATF asked the military for help in staging its initial
raid of the compound on Feb. 28, 1993, military officers said the
ATF would have to reimburse the Army for any assistance because
there was ``no known drug nexus,'' according to Lt. Col. Lon
Walker, an Army liaison to the ATF.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a month later, the ATF added ``drug activity'' to the
matters it was investigating in regard to the Branch Davidians, a
move that a congressional report called ``deliberately
misleading.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Possible violations of Texas and Alabama state laws
prohibiting the use of National Guard personnel and equipment
against the Branch Davidians.
</P>
<P>
   Texas law prohibits the use of the Texas National Guard in
civilian law enforcement unless there is a clear drug connection.
Alabama law says its National Guard force has no authority outside
state boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   National Guard personnel and equipment from both states were
used at Mount Carmel. A congressional report has determined that
those actions were taken without proper authority.
</P>
<P>
   DELTA FORCE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Recent revelations indicate that the Delta Force had a greater
presence and a more active role in the final assault on the Branch
Davidians than FBI officials have acknowledged. According to at
least one account, the Delta Force was there not to advise, but to
kill.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Barry, a retired Special Forces sergeant who sometimes
trained members of the Delta Force, gave a sworn affidavit to
plaintiffs' attorneys in a civil suit brought by families of dead
Branch Davidians. The case is scheduled to go to trial in Waco on
Oct. 18.
</P>
<P>
   In the affidavit, Barry quoted a friend in the Delta Force as
saying the unit set up a tactical operations center during the
siege that was staffed by 10 to 20 soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Barry said another friend in the Delta Force told him that the
unit's ``B'' Squadron had been ordered to ``take down'' Branch
Davidians. Barry said he understood from his experience in the
Special Forces that ``take down'' meant to kill people identified
as terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   Barry isn't alone in these allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Former CIA officer Gene Cullen has said in several recent
interviews that he learned through casual conversations with Delta
Force members that 10 of the unit's commandos were present during
the April 19, 1993, assault and may have participated.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, James B. Francis, commissioner of the Texas
Department of Public Safety, said ``it is clear'' that members of
the Delta Force were on the scene. Initial reports indicated that
three members were present, but Francis said he is now being told
that as many as 10 were there.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is some evidence that might indicate that they were more
than observers,'' Francis said. ``It is fuzzy as to what their role
was.''
</P>
<P>
   Francis said law enforcement officials and civilians have
provided first- and second-hand reports on Delta Force activities.
He declined to elaborate further.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence gathered after the Mount Carmel fire was in the hands
of Texas law enforcement officials until U.S. District Judge Walter
Smith Jr. ordered all evidence surrendered to the federal clerk in
Waco.

<P>
   The congressional report states that the Feb. 28 raid should
have been conducted differently if there was a real concern about
the prospect of a clandestine methamphetamine lab on the premises.
Because such labs usually contain explosive and toxic chemicals,
standard procedure calls for the arrest of lab operators away from
their laboratories. Koresh was regularly seen in Waco and could
easily have been apprehended, officials have said.
</P>
<P>
   ``All those justifying stories have kind of gone up in smoke:
drug use, machine guns, child abuse,'' said Daniel Polsby, a
professor at George Mason University's law school who specializes
in constitutional law.
</P>
<P>
   The congressional committees eventually determined that the
``ATF misled the Defense Department as to the existence of a drug
nexus in order to obtain non-reimbursable support.''
</P>
<P>
   Darley, the Pentagon spokesman, said he wouldn't comment on any
conclusions reached by Congress. But he said the Pentagon concurs
with an Aug. 26 General Accounting Office report, which determined
that the approval of military counterdrug support was reasonable
and authorized.
</P>
<P>
   NATIONAL GUARD INVOLVEMENT &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The use of Texas and Alabama National Guard units at Mount
Carmel may have violated laws in both states and perhaps the U.S.
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Convincing state officials that drugs were involved in the
Branch Davidian investigation was crucial to involvement of the
Texas National Guard.
</P>
<P>
   The Posse Comitatus Act does not prohibit use of state National
Guard personnel for local law enforcement, but Texas law does.
State law allows the use of its National Guard helicopters for law
enforcement only if there is evidence of drug violations.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 11, 1992, ATF Special Agent Jose Viegra met with
representatives of Gov. Ann Richards' office to discuss the role of
the military in any potential ATF action against the Branch
Davidians, Treasury Department documents show.
</P>
<P>
   Viegra was told he could not make use of Operation Alliance,
which serves as a clearinghouse for several agencies involved in
drug investigations along the Southwest border, unless there was a
drug component.
</P>
<P>
   Three days later, according to a Treasury Department memorandum,
Operation Alliance officials received a facsimile from the ATF
requesting assistance from the Texas Counterdrug Program, which
included the National Guard.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Col. William Pettit, Texas National Guard coordinator of the
Texas Counterdrug Task Force, signed off on the request. The ATF
fax made no reference to suspected drug violations in the compound,
casting Pettit's approval in doubt, according to the congressional
report.
</P>
<P>
   After the Feb. 28 raid, ATF Deputy Director Daniel Hartnett
wrote Gov. Richards a letter on March 27, 1993, denying allegations
that Mount Carmel did not have the necessary drug activity to
justify the Texas National Guard's involvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please let me assure you that nothing could be further from
the truth,'' Hartnett wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Hartnett wrote that 11 sect members ``have some prior drug
involvement, some with arrests for possession and trafficking.''
However, when ATF agents were interviewed by Treasury Department
officials in a post-siege review, they said that only one Branch
Davidian had a drug conviction, the congressional report said.
</P>
<P>
   The use of the Texas National Guard isn't the only questionable
Guard involvement.
</P>
<P>
   The ATF also used the Alabama National Guard for aerial
photography on Jan. 14, 1993. That task was authorized by a
``memorandum of agreement'' between the adjutants general of the
Texas National Guard and the Alabama National Guard.
</P>
<P>
   According to Texas law, the National Guard from another state
cannot be used without approval of the Texas governor. Alabama
state law says that its National Guard has no authority to conduct
operations outside the state.
</P>
<P>
   National Guard personnel said in a post-raid Guard investigation
that Gov. Richards did not approve the use of the Alabama National
Guard. Military documents released to Congress during its 1995
hearings indicated that Richards was unaware of the extent of the
Texas National Guard's involvement until after the Feb. 28 raid,
the congressional report said. Neither Richards nor members of her
staff at the time could be reached to comment last week.
</P>
<P>
   Use of the Alabama National Guard may also have violated the
U.S. Constitution, the congressional report said, although that
issue was outside the scope of the congressional investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The Constitution specifically prohibits states from entering
into treaties without congressional consent. The National Guard
Bureau takes the position that use of the National Guard for law
enforcement purposes across state lines is therefore strictly
prohibited.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thus, it appears that the Alabama National Guard entered and
conducted military operations in Texas without the proper authority
to do so,'' the congressional report said.

<P>
   Government attorneys have indicated in some court documents that
as many as 10 ``classified'' military personnel were present, said
Houston attorney Mike Caddell, who filed the wrongful death lawsuit
on behalf of about 100 people, mostly relatives of dead Branch
Davidians.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been told that there were 10 military personnel, but
they won't tell us who they were,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Caddell said government attorneys were asked to answer questions
in connection with the lawsuit. One of the questions asked for a
list of all military personnel who were at Mount Carmel.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials listed Army medical personnel, the Texas
National Guard and 10 others whose identity they said is classified
information, Caddell said.
</P>
<P>
   Army Col. Bill Darley, a Defense Department spokesman, said the
Pentagon has stated that it had only three Special Operations
personnel at Mount Carmel and he has seen nothing to refute that
statement. Two soldiers were present during most of the siege to
maintain high-tech equipment, he said. Another was there when the
compound burned, but only as an observer, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a presence there for support only,'' Darley said. ``All
other allegations appear to us to be unfounded and without basis in
fact.''
</P>
<P>
   That distinction is crucial, according to federal law.
</P>
<P>
   If what Barry and Cullen say is true, military personnel may
have violated the Posse Comitatus Act, which forbids use of
military personnel in civilian law enforcement except in special
cases approved by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The prohibition applies only to direct participation by soldiers
in an arrest, search or seizure. Soldiers may train civilian law
enforcement agents or provide military vehicles and munitions.
</P>
<P>
   A congressional report determined that all members of the
military were present only as observers and that no violation of
the act had occurred. The report, ``Investigation into the
Activities of Federal Law Enforcement Agencies Toward the Branch
Davidians,'' was issued in August 1996 by the House Government
Reform and Oversight Committee and the House Judiciary Committee
after their 1995 hearings.
</P>
<P>
   Darley said Pentagon policy prevented him from discussing
further any of its ``special missions units'' such as Delta Force.
</P>
<P>
   DRUG RUSE?
</P>
<P>
   Some evidence suggests that the ATF created a ruse about the
possibility of illegal drug manufacturing at Mount Carmel to obtain
free military assistance for its Feb. 28, 1993, raid, which left
four ATF agents dead and more than 20 wounded.
</P>
<P>
   As early as November 1992, ATF agents were discussing the need
for military support with Walker, the agency's Defense Department
liaison, according to Treasury Department documents. The ATF is
part of the Treasury Department.
</P>
<P>
   But there was a problem.
</P>
<P>
   In a meeting with the ATF on Dec. 4, 1992, Walker informed the
agency that it would have to pay the military for the use of its
equipment because the military could waive the charges only in
anti-drug operations.
</P>
<P>
   At the meeting, Walker jotted a handwritten note that said:
``There was no known drug nexus,'' according to the Treasury
Department documents.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would have been considerable. The military assistance
at Waco cost about $1 million, according to a General Accounting
Office report released Aug. 26. About 90 percent of the cost was
incurred by the Texas National Guard and U.S. Army, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
   That military personnel can play a greater role assisting
civilian law enforcement in drug investigations is a significant
exception to the Posse Comitatus Act, passed as part of the 1990
Department of Defense Authorization Act to help fight illegal drug
importation.
</P>
<P>
   Before the end of December 1992, the ATF was investigating
``suspicion of drug activity'' at the Branch Davidian compound,
according to the Treasury Department report.
</P>
<P>
   That addition to the points of investigation apparently was
based on a Dec. 16, 1992, facsimile from Marc Breault in Australia,
who suggested that a methamphetamine lab had once been seen on
Branch Davidian premises. Congressional investigators later
determined that Breault was a former Branch Davidian who had left
the sect on bad terms.
</P>
<P>
   Former Branch Davidians said Koresh had discovered the lab when
he arrived at Mount Carmel and had telephoned the McLennan County
Sheriff's Department to report it and to ask that deputies
confiscate it, but no one ever came, the congressional report said.
The building Breault said the lab was in burned down three years
before the ATF raid, the report also said.
</P>
<P>
   David Kopel, a former Colorado assistant attorney general and
now a researcher for the Independence Institute, a conservative
think tank in Colorado, said he was not surprised by the ATF's
decision to add ``drug activity'' component to the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the military wants is the word `drugs,''' Kopel said.
``Nobody cares if it's true.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the initial application for a warrant to search the
compound included nothing about suspected drug violations. After
agents failed to serve the warrant on Feb. 28, 1993, the day of the
aborted first assault, they applied for another warrant and
expanded its scope. That warrant also made no mention of drugs.

ONE-WOMAN PLAY TAKES THE MOLL OUT OF BONNIE PARKER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PERRY STEWART 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The image of Bonnie Parker as a coarse, cigar-smoking,
pistol-brandishing outlaw is one that writer/actress Dixie Lee
Sedgwick has been disputing loudly these several months on stages
in Tarrant and Dallas counties.
</P>
<P>
   Sedgwick _ who wrote and performs the play ``Inside Bonnie
Parker'' _ made a rigorous study of the short life and violent
death of Parker, who died at age 23 in a rain of bullets on May 23,
1934, when police ambushed the car in which she and bank robber
Clyde Barrow were riding in rural Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   An eye-opener _ indeed, an epiphany of sorts _ was ``The
Fugitives,'' by Emma Parker (Bonnie's mother) and Nell Barrow Cowan
(Clyde's oldest sister). This book drew heavily on Bonnie's diaries
and was a great help to building a character for a play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mrs. Parker wrote about Bonnie when she was little, when she
was growing up,'' Sedgwick said. ``She was a normal girl. She was
... like me, and most of the girls I knew. She was high-strung,
very bright, much more intelligent than I am _ I'm sure of that
because of her writing. Maybe emotionally her decisions, as far as
her love life goes, weren't so wise. But look at how many women
make those same choices, even today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I related to her, I saw her as a human being, a real person,
not that cigar-smoking gun moll that the media made her out to be.
Those pictures of her with guns and cigars were posed gag shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the authorities wanted to play that image up for all it
was worth, because they didn't want people helping them. They
didn't want the small-town folk to help Bonnie and Clyde evade the
officers. The newspapers were glad to help promote this image
because it gave them colorful stories and big headlines.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's really no evidence that Bonnie ever fired a gun. Her
crime was staying with Clyde. I don't mean to portray her as a
sweet innocent who didn't know what she was doing. She knew. But
it's important to look at this in the context of things happening
to young people today _ how a teen-ager can go wrong, and what the
consequences are.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the revelations in Sedgwick's play are that Bonnie was a
bride at 16 (to the mostly absent Mr. Thornton) and was disabled
for the last year of her life.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was badly burned in a car crash, and her leg never healed
right,'' Sedgwick said. ``Clyde frequently carried Bonnie on his
shoulder the last year because it was so painful for her to walk.
If you notice the pictures in books, she's usually standing up
against a car and has one foot on the bumper. That's because she
couldn't straighten her leg.''
</P>
<P>
   How Dixie Sedgwick met Bonnie Parker is a tribute to
happenstance. Sedgwick studied at the American Academy of Dramatic
Arts and had acted and written screenplays in her native Seattle.
She was new to Texas when she met producer/director Joe Black, then
assistant director of the Dallas/Fort Worth Regional Film
Commission, at a meeting of Women in Film about two years ago in
Dallas. Black had just finished doing extensive research on Barrow
and Parker, in response to a request from England's BBC.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were putting together a documentary, as someone does
every year, and wanted to film the actual locations of the banks
and stores that Bonnie and Clyde robbed,'' Black recalled. ``So I
read all the books. Dixie had just blown into town and wanted more
work. She struck me as being a lot like Bonnie, both in size and
vivaciousness. I suggested she develop a one-woman show about
Bonnie.''
</P>
<P>
   Sedgwick threw her 101 pounds into the enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't sure what was redeeming about Bonnie Parker,'' she
said prior to a rehearsal for the current run of ``Inside Bonnie
Parker'' at Fort Worth's Circle Theatre.
</P>
<P>
   ``I only knew what I saw in the film with Warren Beatty and Faye
Dunaway. I went to the Dallas Public Library archives. I was down
there a lot. I spoke with some historians. I read books like ``The
Fugitives,'' and ``Running With Bonnie and Clyde,'' by John Neal
Phillips. And I spoke with Marie Barrow, Clyde's sister. She passed
away last February. It was really helpful to speak with her. Marie
felt that the characterization was right on. She was quite
straightforward. She told me: `Clyde's eyes weren't blue, they were
brown.' And she said, `Bonnie was not that whiny.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I did sound a little that way when we first started. So we've
grown. Every time we do it, it gets better and better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I met this whole group of people through Marie. I met Ken M.
Holmes Jr., the guy who owns the old Ford car they used in the
movie. And I met Boots Hinton, whose father was one of the men who
gunned down Bonnie and Clyde.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, that's correct. Ambusher descendants and Barrow and Parker
descendants now hang together.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a re-enactment of the ambush every year around May
23 in Louisiana, near where it happened,'' Sedgwick said. ``They
use Ken's movie car, and then they have a dinner. All the
historians come. People come from all over.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Black, who can be said to have ``introduced'' Dixie and
Bonnie, is the director of ``Inside Bonnie Parker'' (formerly
titled ``Little Blue-Eyed Girl'' after Clyde's pet name for
Bonnie). And he is producing it through his Lone Star Studios.
Black also has had a lot to do with shaping the piece.
</P>
<P>
   ``The show is still a baby,'' he said. ``It's going to grow. We
workshopped it in Mansfield and Dallas and made changes after that.
During this run at Circle, we've added some humor. Bonnie was
witty. We put in some true anecdotes to show this.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Black nor Sedgwick is ambivalent about their hopes for
the play's future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to tour,'' Sedgwick said. ``In fact, we're talking to
theaters all over the place. Eventually, we want to end up in New
York or LA or both. We're signed with Plano Rep for their season
next year. Also, we're working on producing a docu-drama screen
version.''
</P>
<P>
   Black's ``Bonnie'' wish list includes all of the above, plus a
Southern regional presence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to take this play to Sulphur Springs and Waco and
Little Rock _ to the places where Bonnie and Clyde hung out and hid
out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And, Black said, there are nibbles from the other end of the
continent.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is some Montreal interest,'' he said. ``One of the
`Star-Telegram' articles about the show was on the Internet, and
``TheatreScope'' magazine wound up writing about the play.''

AGENT TOLD OF HEARING FBI SHOTS AT WACO SIEGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GABRIELLE CRIST 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Among the evidence that may get a second look amid the latest
uproar over the FBI's conduct at Mount Carmel is a two-page
document detailing an FBI sniper's suggestion that an agent fired
at Branch Davidians.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials deny that agents fired shots on April 19,
1993, the final day of the 51-day standoff, which ended when the
Davidians' compound burst into flames. Leader David Koresh and
about 80 of his followers were later found dead inside, some with
burns and others with gunshot wounds.
</P>
<P>
   But FBI agent Charles Riley said in June 1993 that he heard
shots fired from a sniper post occupied by agent Lon Horiuchi,
according to court documents filed in Waco as part of a wrongful
death suit scheduled to go to trial next month. The suit was filed
by Branch Davidians and their relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Riley's statement is among 25 volumes of motions, rulings and
exhibit lists filed in the multimillion-dollar lawsuit. An attorney
for the 100 or so plaintiffs said he is convinced that gunfire was
exchanged on the final day.
</P>
<P>
   James B. Francis, commissioner of the Texas Department of Public
Safety, said there is some indication that ``gunfire took place
there by government police officers.'' Francis would not say when
he believes those shots were fired and declined to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a subject matter that needs to be investigated,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Horiuchi could not be reached to comment for this report. He
told investigators in April 1993 that ``none of the snipers under
his control at Sierra-1 (a sniper post) fired any rounds from their
weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   Government officials have said that Riley retracted his initial
statement, according to Houston attorney Michael Caddell, who
represents the Branch Davidians in the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   FBI officials in Washington declined to confirm that Riley
issued a retraction and would not comment because of an independent
investigation launched last week.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno ordered the investigation after FBI
officials acknowledged using as many as three pyrotechnic tear gas
grenades on the last day of the standoff. The admission is an
about-face from the adamant denials issued by the government for
the past six years.
</P>
<P>
   Former GOP Sen. John Danforth, who is heading the investigation,
said it will focus on whether there was a cover-up, how the fire
started and whether government officials fired shots.
</P>
<P>
   Agents were authorized to use deadly force on April 19,
according to a 1993 internal FBI document detailing an
investigative interview with agent Richard Rogers, an FBI
supervisor.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers told investigators that members of the Hostage Rescue
Team were told to provide cover for the armored vehicles that were
launching tear gas into the compound.
</P>
<P>
   As the vehicles punched holes in the walls, FBI officials
announced over loudspeakers that they were delivering tear gas.
They told the Branch Davidians not to shoot and warned that FBI
agents would return fire.
</P>
<P>
   Although several FBI agents saw and heard Davidians firing at
the vehicles and toward the sniper positions, agents did not fire
``a single shot,'' Rogers said, because they ``did not acquire
clear and identifiable targets.''
</P>
<P>
   But two experts in thermal imaging will contend at the trial
that images on an infrared video show shots being fired toward the
compound.
</P>
<P>
   Their opinions, coupled with Riley's initial statement,
``provide at least some evidence'' to support the plaintiffs'
claims that Davidians were afraid they would be shot if they tried
to escape from the burning compound, U.S. District Judge Walter
Smith Jr. said in a July ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Because of that evidence, Smith said in his ruling, Horiuchi
should be named as an individual defendant in the lawsuit. Smith
dismissed all other individual defendants, including numerous
officials of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms
and the FBI. Horiuchi and the United States are the sole
defendants.
</P>
<P>
   A jury will decide whether Horiuchi fired at Davidians without
provocation. Smith will then decide the other issues in the case:
whether the ATF used excessive force during an aborted Feb. 28,
1993, raid and whether the FBI started the fire and is negligent
for not extinguishing it.
</P>
<P>
   Caddell said he is convinced that at least some of the FBI
agents fired at the Branch Davidians, perhaps justifiably. Riley's
``unpressured recollection is a lot more believable than any of the
recanting'' he did five years later, he said.
</P>
<P>
   A few of the Branch Davidians probably did shoot at FBI agents
and FBI agents probably fired back, Caddell contends.
</P>
<P>
   Caddell said investigators failed to collect and test all the
weapons used during the siege to determine whether FBI officials
fired.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole thing has been an exercise in, `Don't ask, don't
tell,' '' he said.

`MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL' GETS CROWDED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Is three really a crowd?
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't for Jack Ritter, Joyce DeWitt and Suzanne Somers in
``Three's Company.'' In 28 of the 29 years, ABC's ``Monday Night
Football'' booth has been the same way.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, it's too crowded.
</P>
<P>
   After a dozen years on ``MNF,'' Dan Dierdorf did not have his
contract renewed after last season. Rather than replace him, ABC
chose to let Al Michaels and Boomer Esiason become a two-man crew.
That happened only one other time in ``MNF'' annals, when Michaels
and Frank Gifford hooked up in 1986, and that combination caused
the hiring of Dierdorf the following year.
</P>
<P>
   All we have heard is how great a two-man booth is.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you take the two personalities as they are,'' producer
Ken Wolfe said in a recent interview, ``we think this is a
wonderful opportunity that opens up the show; lets it breathe a
little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   We weren't aware of any suffocating, but ABC has been led to
believe that.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the network was bothered by reports that Dierdorf and
Esiason were fighting for air time off camera. I have been in the
company of both over the past year, and either they're seeking
Oscar nominations or they genuinely do like each other.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently the joshing that could be seen off camera didn't
translate well on the air.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Esiason and Dierdorf both seem overjoyed about the
chance to be the lone analysts on a telecast.
</P>
<P>
   ``A two-man booth is much easier for me,'' Esiason said. ``It
allows me to analyze the game and give the fan an opportunity to
find out what these players are thinking about and how they're
feeling. ... There's room for humor. There should be some fun in
there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A three-man booth probably has a redeeming quality if you're
talking about a 35-10 ballgame,'' Dierdorf said. ``When you're an
analyst in a three-man booth, you only have a job. You learn early
on that a lot of the things you'd like to say never make air.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, is a two-man booth better for the viewer? On Sundays, it
probably is. Dierdorf will work CBS games this year with Verne
Lundquist and have the freedom to be much more strategy-oriented,
as the weekend afternoon audience is much more of a hard-core
football fan.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night, the demographics are more skewed toward women
and more casual fans. There were times where I had trouble
differentiating Esiason's voice from Dierdorf's, but the exchanges
between them could be entertaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can have a lot of lively commentary if each approaches a
situation from a different angle,'' Michaels said. ``On the other
hand, if there's a redunancy, that's a negative in a three-man
situation. In a two-man booth, we have the opportunity to begin a
story, to weave it without having an obstacle placed in our way.''
</P>
<P>
   So everyone's on board for a two-man booth. For now. We'll see
what they're saying at this time next year.

REBEL LEADER SEEN AS `MANDELA' OF EAST TIMOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By INDIRA A.R. LAKSHMANAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA _ When the rebel leader Xanana Gusmao saw a television
news report Thursday that his 82-year father had been reported as
one of the hundreds slaughtered in a savage revenge campaign on
East Timor, aides tried frantically to reassure him.
</P>
<P>
   The report was not confirmed, they reminded Gusmao, the man
likely to become the first president of an independent East Timor _
if one emerges from the ashes of the orgy of violence last week.
</P>
<P>
   Gusmao sat rod-straight in his chair, silent at first.
</P>
<P>
   Freed from house arrest two days earlier, and depressed by
accounts of the massacre of priests, nuns and other civilians in
his homeland, he had just pleaded in vain with a United Nations
delegation to send troops to stop the rampage by militias and
elements of the Indonesian military.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't worry about me,'' he told them. ``I am used to crying
for my family. My family is my people, and I cry for all of them.
Let's focus on who's alive and on getting them food and
medication.''
</P>
<P>
   It was vintage Gusmao, said Ana Gomes, Portugal's diplomatic
representative to Jakarta, who was in the room at the time, and who
recalled the exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Although Gusmao remains untested as a political leader, Gomes
and others who know him say he is determined to put the big picture
ahead of narrow interests, to place his people's struggle for a
free homeland over his own suffering, to insist on reconciliation
rather than revenge. These qualities have led people to call him
``the Nelson Mandela of East Timor,'' a description that aides say
embarrasses him.
</P>
<P>
   He has arguably gone a step further toward forgiveness than
Mandela did in South Africa; Gusmao has pledged amnesty for all
political crimes committed in the 24 years since troops from
Jakarta invaded the former Portuguese colony, and he has rejected
calls for a truth commission, saying it would be ``too divisive.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a pledge that is likely to be sorely tested after the
carnage in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   The charismatic, grey-bearded Gusmao, whose image seemed
ubiquitious on posters and T-shirts in his poor, agrarian homeland
in the run-up to the Aug. 30 referendum on independence, is
idolized by East Timorese who want self-rule. He is described, even
by loyalists to Indonesia and the regime in Jakarta he fought
against, as the one person who might unite disparate interests and
heal wounds in a new Timorese nation.
</P>
<P>
   It is strikingly difficult to get anyone to say anything
critical about Gusmao. Even his avowed enemies seem to respect him.
On the day of the United Nations-sponsored ballot, Indonesia's
president, its foreign minister, and the head of a pro-Jakarta
militia all made strong statements calling Gusmao a peacemaker and
the future of East Timor, be it independent or a province of
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   But some wonder how much reconciliation anyone can promote in
the aftermath of last week's terror. Whether he remains forgiving
will do much to shape East Timor's future.
</P>
<P>
   He has ordered the guerrilla forces he headed for 20 years not
to respond to provocations by militias and soldiers. He is lobbying
the international community, militias, and the Indonesian military
chief, General Wiranto, to halt the violence, to invite foreign
peacekeepers, and to withdraw the army.
</P>
<P>
   But for the 53-year-old Gusmao, like most East Timorese who
regard to him as their leader, last week was an extraordinary
emotional roller coaster, one that will inevitably leave a mark. He
rejoiced over the landslide referendum victory for independence,
and then he watched as East Timor's capital was torched and as tens
of thousands of its residents were forced out at gunpoint. He
celebrated his release from a 20-year prison term, then mourned the
reported, but still unconfirmed, murder of his father. He begged
for international help to stop the killing, and was turned down.
</P>
<P>
   Born Jose Alexandre Gusmao, one of seven children of a
schoolteacher father, he attended Catholic school and a Jesuit
seminary, where he learned Latin and the classics. By the age of
30, he had worked as a chartered surveyor, a teacher and a local
journalist, and was awarded the Timor Poetry Prize.
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, the year Portugal decided to cast off its East Timor
colony, Gusmao joined the independence movement. When Indonesia
invaded in 1975, he fled to the mountains. In 1978 and 1979, after
Indonesian soldiers hunted down and killed most of the resistance
leaders, Gusmao emerged as commander of the decimated guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   One East Timor human rights campaigner, Florentino Sarmento, has
accused both Indonesia and the guerillas of committing atrocities
against alleged traitors and collaborators during the war years,
but Gusmao has never been directly linked to the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Gusmao was captured, charged with subversion and
sentenced to life in prison after a summary trial in Jakarta. He
infuriated his followers at first when he appeared on television
after his arrest, and he pledged allegiance to Jakarta. Many
thought he had been tortured and broken, but it turned out to be a
ruse. Gusmao appeared to cooperate with the authorities until he
could make his defense at his public trial.
</P>
<P>
   Until seven months ago, he was held in Cipinang Prison in
Jakarta, then was moved to house arrest after President B.J.
Habibie offered East Timor a choice of autonomy or separation.
</P>
<P>
   In prison, Gusmao, a native Portuguese speaker, studied English,
Indonesian and law; started a trend of prisoners attending lectures
by professors; cultivated bonsai trees, and returned to painting
and poetry. He coached the Cipinang soccer team, cooked Timorese
dishes for fellow prisoners, and was, by all accounts, loved by
other inmates, most of them Indonesian.
</P>
<P>
   A political prisoner worked as his secretary, and an Indonesian
petty thief served as a sort of valet. When both were granted their
freedom, they chose instead to move in with Gusmao and continue
serving him under house arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Gusmao even won over his captors. Guards who had held him under
house arrest, initially wary, befriended him and started making
T-shirts with his photo and the East Timor flag and selling them to
journalists. When Gusmao's sentence was commuted last week, the
prison governor embraced him in a tearful farewell.
</P>
<P>
   Friends say he listens well and admits shortcomings and
ignorance. Diplomats say he is a patient thinker who understands
his enemies. Aides say he rose to leadership without tramping on
others. He refused the Indonesian government's offer of freedom in
exile, remaining in East Timor to fight. His wife and two children,
a son and daughter now in their 20s, fled to Australia in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   What Gusmao lacks is a track record as a political leader. His
career has been as a rebel chief, and some wonder how he can
translate that into running a country or balancing a budget.
</P>
<P>
   When he reorganized the resistance in the 1980s, some people who
were sidelined accused him of being a ``powermonger and dictator.''
But the criticisms faded over time, and today it is hard to find
anyone who is critical.
</P>
<P>
   Some guerrillas have complained that Gusmao has been out of the
hills too long, living comfortably on three meals a day in prison,
and has forgotten what it is like to be a rebel fighter. This year,
he frustrated some of his troops by insisting they stick to a
ceasefire despite attacks on civilians by pro-Jakarta militias;
likewise, he insisted this week that they not engage in battles
with rampaging anti-independence forces.
</P>
<P>
   Some have argued that Gusmao is too ready to turn the other
cheek. But as evidence mounted last week of a military-sponsored
scorched-earth campaign in East Timor, the resistance closed ranks
behind Gusmao and his calls for restraint.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Ramos-Horta, the leader of East Timor resistance in exile
and co-winner of the 1996 Nobel Peace Prize, said Gusmao ``dwarfs
political leaders in the region for his charisma, brilliance,
humility. He's a poet and a painter, but at the same time, he can
be extremely determined and tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Today Gusmao wears a jacket and tie rather than guerrilla
fatigues, and aides say he is more interested in fostering
reconciliation than becoming president.
</P>
<P>
   But Gomes said he has no choice. ``He's the natural leader of
his people. He's not keen on titles,'' she acknowledged. ``But he
will not shun his responsibility to lead his people into peace.''

SHUNNING THE `PEELERS': AN ULSTER PLAN DISMISSED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST _ At 17, John O'Reilly is smart enough to be anything he
wants. He thinks he wants to be an accountant. He knows he does not
want to be a police officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing in the world that could make me want to become
a peeler,'' O'Reilly said, using the local slang for the police.
Last Thursday, when a government commission released its blueprint
for making the overwhelmingly Protestant police in Northern Ireland
more acceptable to Catholic nationalists, the commission chairman,
Chris Patten, cited the Markets section of Belfast, where O'Reilly
lives, as a place where foot patrols were beginning to replace the
anonymous, intimidating patrols in armored cars that police have
used for the last 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Roman Catholics make up 43 percent of the population of Northern
Ireland, but only 8 percent of the police, the Royal Ulster
Constabulary. By removing oaths and symbols that Catholic
nationalists find offensive, and by using an accelerated hiring
process, Patten says, the number of Catholics on the force can be
quadrupled in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Patten acknowledged in an interview that if Northern Ireland is
to achieve long-term stability, not only will police need
acceptance in places like the Markets, but also young people like
O'Reilly will have to join the force.
</P>
<P>
   But walking around the Markets, a republican housing project
where 85 percent of the 600 heads of household are out of work,
there is a lack of enthusiasm about the prospect of police change _
or of local residents changing the police. Not only is there is
deep-seated mistrust of the police, but many seem comfortable with
the vigilante justice that republican paramilitary groups dole out
to the neighborhood's chronic troublemakers.
</P>
<P>
   Viewed from the narrow streets of the Markets, the goal of
transforming the police as a way of transforming Northern Ireland's
divisions seems especially daunting.
</P>
<P>
   Long a hotbed of republican paramilitary activity, the Markets
section has been a dangerous place for police officers. Several
have been shot dead here.
</P>
<P>
   Eight years ago, a nine-man police team began patrolling the
neighborhood on foot. Last year, the team commander, Sergeant Steve
Jones, was named the community police officer of the year for the
United Kingdom. But many people here say they have never heard of
Jones, and some who have accuse him and the police of using them as
props in a public relations exercise. Kathleen Sturgeon, leader of
the local youth club, said she has never met Jones.
</P>
<P>
   There are some people in the Markets who would never give the
police any credit even when it was deserved. But many others speak
of being treated with contempt by the police. They talk of
spotlights being flashed on their windows in the middle of the
night, of enduring humiliating epithets and insults. Mostly, they
complain that police officers who engage in such behavior are not
disciplined. And they say changing the name of the police force and
opening it up to more Catholics changes none of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you say you're from the Markets, people treat you like
you're scum,'' said Agnes O'Reilly, John's mother, sitting on the
couch of the family's small brickfront house. ``I would never have
anything to do with the peelers.''
</P>
<P>
   It is virtually impossible to find anyone in the Markets whose
home has not been raided and searched by the police. Virtually
everyone has a story of police harassment or humiliation. And
virtually no one knows a police officer on a first-name basis.
</P>
<P>
   Sturgeon said the absence of role models, and the lack of
interaction with police officers, makes the idea of young people
joining the police fanciful. ``The young people here wouldn't think
about becoming police officers,'' she said. ``To my knowledge, no
one from the Markets has ever become a police officer.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Montgomery, a youth worker, disputed the rosy picture
Patten painted of community policing taking hold here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody talks to the RUC here,'' he said. ``People here go to
the paramilitaries.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice is often rough on the streets of places like the
Markets. A few years ago, Montgomery was unable to intervene when
the IRA kneecapped a boyhood friend, Sean McNally, for ignoring
warnings to curb his penchant for stealing things and raising hell.
The shooting went wrong and McNally lost the lower part of his leg.
He now limps around on crutches, a symbol of the ongoing struggle
for control of the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery acknowledges the need for a regular police force. But
he cannot bring himself to support the new one called for in
Patten's report, nor encourage young people to join it. ``I would
lose all my street credibility if I advised young people here to
join the police,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nor can young people like John O'Reilly imagine joining a newly
named, reformed police force, even if republican leaders like Sinn
Fein President Gerry Adams decide to urge them to.
</P>
<P>
   O'Reilly's grievances with the police date back to the womb. His
father, a member of an IRA splinter group, was being held for
questioning by police when John was born. Trying to squeeze out a
confession, the police told his father that John had been born with
brain damage. His father didn't crack, and three days later was
released to find that his newborn son was fine.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, O'Reilly's father was killed, not by the police but
in one of the internecine feuds that decimated the Irish National
Liberation Army. His death at the hands of erstwhile comrades
illustrates one of the contradictions here _ while republicans
sometimes are brutalized by their own, there is no support for a
new police force to quell such activity.
</P>
<P>
   In the Markets, many young people have had scrapes with the law.
Patten's report urges that authorities overlook ``relatively minor
offenses'' committed by young people so they can be considered for
police service.
</P>
<P>
   But the other day, there were no takers.
</P>
<P>
   Sean McNally, 24, who shares the name but so far not the fate of
the Sean McNally who had his leg blown off, figures that he has
been arrested 20 times for minor offenses and beat up by the police
on a dozen occasions. ``I'm no angel,'' he acknowledged, but said
the police have beaten and framed him with impunity.
</P>
<P>
   He also voiced a fear that Catholics from affluent neighborhoods
will join the police to the exclusion of people from places like
the Markets.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery echoed that fear.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need people from areas like here, not the Malone Road,''
he said, referring to a wealthy section of Belfast. ``Patten made a
few cosmetic changes so that middle-class Catholics can join the
police. But it's not them who'll get it in the neck. It's us.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ While both Bill Bradley and Al Gore are charter
members of the centrist New Democrats, they have reached that
status by different paths. Following is a summary of their
differing positions on several key issues while both served in
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ABORTION: During his years in the House, Gore opposed federal
payment for poor women's abortions. He changed that stance when he
got to the Senate, joining Bradley in support of federal financing.
</P>
<P>
   BUDGET CUTS: Bradley voted for the Reagan administration's 1981
budget cuts, but not its tax cuts. Gore opposed both.
</P>
<P>
   CENTRAL AMERICA: Bradley gave qualified support to the Contra
war in Nicaragua in 1986, which Gore consistently opposed.
</P>
<P>
   DEATH PENALTY: Bradley voted for the death penalty for drug
lords who murdered or ordered killings, Gore did not.
</P>
<P>
   DEFICITS: When the budget deficit emerged as an issue, Gore
voted for two devices _ the balanced budget amendment in 1986 and,
before that, the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings law in 1985 _ designed to
stem the tide of red ink. Bradley, however, voted against both
measures, which he said were gimmickry.
</P>
<P>
   ETHANOL: Bradley's affection for ethanol price supports, an
issue important to the first-caucus state of Iowa, emerged since he
became a presidential candidate. In 1994 Bradley cosponsored an
amendment that would have ended federal quotas promoting the use of
ethanol, a corn-based fuel. Gore, presiding over the Senate as vice
president, cast the tie-breaking vote that defeated the amendment.
</P>
<P>
   FARM SUBSIDIES AND TOBACCO: Gore has been far more supportive
than Bradley of federal farm programs and subsidies. Gore and the
Clinton administration in recent years have attacked tobacco
interests. But Gore voted in 1985 to subsidize the tobacco
industry. Bradley opposed the measure.
</P>
<P>
   FEDERAL RESERVE: Bradley was one of just two senators to vote
against President Reagan's appointment of Federal Reserve Board
chairman Alan Greenspan in 1987. He supported President Clinton's
decision to reappoint Greenspan.
</P>
<P>
   FREE TRADE: Though Gore was a hero of the administration's
battle to pass the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1993 _
debating Ross Perot on behalf of free trade on Larry King's
television show _ it was Bradley who opposed a protectionist
textile bill in 1988, and Gore who voted for it.
</P>
<P>
   PERSIAN GULF WAR: Gore voted to go to war against Iraq; Bradley
did not.
</P>
<P>
   SCHOOL VOUCHERS: Bradley voted in 1992 to give low-income
parents money to enroll their children at private or parochial
schools, a measure Gore opposed.
</P>
<P>
   SUPREME COURT: Gore backed the nomination of David Souter to the
Supreme Court, but Bradley was one of nine senators who did not.
Both Gore and Bradley opposed the nomination of Robert Bork.
</P>
<P>
   WELFARE REFORM: In 1988, Gore voted to require welfare
recipients to work a minimum of 16 hours a week; Bradley opposed
the amendment.

BRADLEY AND GORE: MIRROR IMAGES? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On the day last week that Bill Bradley made his
presidential campaign official, he pointedly noted that he would be
a different kind of president from Al Gore. ``I think,'' he said,
``that flows from our life experience.''
</P>
<P>
   But voters eyeing the two men may need more persuading.
</P>
<P>
   As the electorate slowly starts to focus on the coming election
year, Democrats will search in vain for clear-cut ideological
differences between the two men vying for their party's
presidential nomination. Bradley Democrats find it difficult to
tell pollsters why they favor him over Gore, other than because
they have a vague desire for change. Looking at their records, it's
hard to call one more conservative _ or more liberal _ than the
other.
</P>
<P>
   And ideology is not all they have in common. Their personal
histories have more than a few parallels. When Gore and Bradley
arrived in Congress in the late 1970s, both were young, independent
Ivy League graduates with a sheen of celebrity and the tang of
ambition. Even then, many on Capitol Hill predicted each would run
for president one day.
</P>
<P>
   They both became charter members of the centrist camp called
``New Democrats.'' Once a modest faction, the New Democrats now
dominate the party.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all their similarities, Gore and Bradley have had
revealing differences over the years. For two men marching in the
same direction, they sometimes took different roads in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The Reagan Revolution of the 1980s _ with its debates over taxes
and spending, nuclear arms, social issues, and US intervention in
Central America _ was a particularly revealing test for Gore and
Bradley, with a range of symbolic, politically charged votes. The
impressions of their former colleagues, and an examination of the
leadership roles taken by them in the crucible of Congress, may
also give voters a basis on which to choose between them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The standard assumption _ that they are nearly identical
_misses the detail,'' said Eric Howser, Bradley's press secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, the son of a US senator from Tennessee, graduated from
Harvard College, served in Vietnam, and arrived in the House of
Representatives in 1977 before winning election to the Senate in
1985. Bradley, a banker's son from Missouri, was a star basketball
player at Princeton University, a Rhodes scholar, and a workhorse
forward for the National Basketball Association champion New York
Knicks before his election to the Senate in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Gore made his mark in Congress immediately by using his family
name, intelligence, and familiarity with the media (he wrote his
undergraduate thesis on the impact of television on the presidency
and had worked as a newspaper reporter) to escape the anonymity of
the House. Bradley was just as driven, but in a different way. In
the clubby Senate, Bradley impressed his colleagues with his
patience and hard work, and the modest way he dealt with celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   He made friends on both sides of the political divide. ``Bill
would make a tremendous president,'' says Alan Simpson, the
Republican former senator from Wyoming, who quickly notes that he
is officially backing fellow Republican George W. Bush. Still,
Bradley remains a ``very close friend,'' says Simpson, who is now
director of the Institute of Politics at Harvard University's John
F. Kennedy School of Government.
</P>
<P>
   Like Bill Clinton, Gary Hart, Paul Tsongas, and other young
Democrats, Gore and Bradley were spurred by political necessity in
the 1980s to search for a ``third way'' that departed from the
liberalism of the New Deal and Great Society without abandoning the
party's traditional commitment to life's underdogs.
</P>
<P>
   As New Democrats in Congress, Gore and Bradley recognized the
importance of private-sector economic growth, individual
responsibility, work over welfare, an end to the neo-isolationism
of the post-Vietnam era, and the need for a streamlined government.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing about them is that on the big issues
that faced the Democratic Party _ the big paradigm shifts _ they
have both been on the right side,'' said Al From, the president of
the Democratic Leadership Council, the leading New Democrat
organization.
</P>
<P>
   Though they qualify as pioneers, neither Gore nor Bradley was a
flamboyant maverick during his years in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were progressive thinkers on many issues but, as opposed
to me, they were more cautious,'' said Hart, the former US senator
from Colorado. ``They played the game more _ in terms of style _
and were more constituency- and interest-oriented. I made a point
of bucking the interest groups. They were more reluctant.''
</P>
<P>
   The New Democrats' sense of urgency was fueled by the tax revolt
of 1978 and Ronald Reagan's landslide elections in 1980 and 1984.
In 1981, Gore and Bradley were confronted by Reagan's then-popular
plans to cut the federal budget and dramatically slash taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Gore followed House Speaker Thomas P. ``Tip'' O'Neill's liberal
lead and voted against all of Reagan's important tax and budget
cuts in 1981. Bradley, however, took a more moderate stand shared
by only one other Democrat in the Senate. Alarmed at the prospect
of a multibillion-dollar budget deficit, Bradley voted for the
Reagan budget cuts but against the Reagan tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Stylistically, Gore and Bradley impressed their colleagues in
Congress with an ability to select a complex, difficult issue and
then diligently master it.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's signature effort was in the Cold War debate over
strategic nuclear weapons. During the Reagan years, Gore and a
group of like-minded centrists struck a successful deal with the
White House to deploy a limited number of the ``MX''
multiple-warhead missiles the administration wanted in return for
research and development of a less-destabilizing single-warhead
missile. Bradley and many liberal Democrats did not support the
compromise. Gore also supported further production of the B-2
bomber, which Bradley opposed.
</P>
<P>
   In Bradley's case, the signature issue was tax reform. He
patiently nurtured the legislation for years, working the back
rooms and honing details, before it passed and became law in 1986:
plugging loopholes and cutting tax rates for all economic classes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a Gore man. . . . I've known him for a long time,'' said
David Pryor of Arkansas, a former Senate Democratic colleague and
supporter of the vice president's candidacy who believes the two
rivals share important qualities. ``I have real respect, as should
the vice president, for Bill Bradley's intellect and focus. Bradley
is the kind of campaigner that you may not know what he is doing
every day, but you better be sure he is doing something. He's out
there practicing, every day, on that court. Taking that one shot,
over and over and over again, until he has it down.''
</P>
<P>
   Each candidate has a notable flip-flop on his congressional
record. Bradley made a celebrated shift from opposing, to
endorsing, the Reagan administration's support of the Nicaraguan
Contra army in 1986. Bradley rejoined the ranks of Contra foes
after disclosures of the Iran-Contra affair the following year.
</P>
<P>
   Gore never wavered in his opposition to the Contras, but changed
his position on abortion. Early in the Reagan era, the Tennessee
congressman opposed Medicaid coverage of abortions for poor women.
After moving to the Senate, and preparing for the presidential race
in 1988, Gore abandoned his previous position and began to vote for
government payment for certain abortions. Bradley has been a steady
backer of abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps no issue illustrates the fluidity of the New Democrat
creed as does the debate over Reagan's so-called ``Star Wars''
strategic defense plan, during which the two senators switched
their positions. Gore began as an opponent of the program, and
Bradley a supporter. By the end of the Reagan era, Gore was leading
centrist efforts to preserve the program, and Bradley had joined
the liberal critics who wanted to cut it back.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the many overlaps in Bradley and Gore's common political
ancestry cast the Democratic primary as a contest of tactics,
style, and nuance _ and thus a problem is posed for both
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has had difficulty finding philosophical differences
with which to rally liberal activists, union members, and other
primary voters. Both he and Gore favor free trade and embrace
standard Democratic dogma on matters such as the environment,
abortion rights, and civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president, on the other hand, could be hurt if
Democratic voters, wearied by the Clinton administration's scandals
and perceiving no great ideological distinction between the
candidates, simply opt for a fresher face. Bradley isn't burdened
with the administration's ``baggage'' and has more ``spontaneity,''
said former US Representative Michael Harrington of Salem, a
Bradley supporter.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, both are considered a credit to their party,
partners in Democrats' struggle to find a new model.
</P>
<P>
   ``They may not have always been sponsors of the same bill,''
From said, but both Gore and Bradley played important roles
``moving the party in a new direction.''

HISPANIC VOTE GAINS INFLUENCE FOR 2000 VOTE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ What may be the most politically crucial message of
presidential and congressional candidates in the 2000 campaigns
won't run on the major networks, and won't be in English.
</P>
<P>
   With a fast-growing, strategically placed Latino vote up for
grabs, the hot medium is Univision, a Spanish-language cable TV
station that has seen political advertising grow exponentially in
the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   Latinos are expected to be the biggest minority group in America
by 2010. And while Hispanics currently make up only 5 percent of
the national vote, they are a critical swing vote in some key
places.
</P>
<P>
   Four states with large Latino populations, California, New York,
Florida, and Texas, could decide the 2000 presidential race, and a
couple of dozen congressional districts could determine which party
controls the House of Representatives. And neither the Democrats
nor the Republicans have a lock on the Latino vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``In every election from now into the future, Latinos will have
a decisive say, because of the concentration of Latinos in
important states,'' said Henry Cisneros, president of Univision and
a former secretary of housing and urban development.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates are taking note of the numerical power of Latino
voters, now 30 million and growing. Presidential contenders are
announcing their candidacies in Spanish as well as English. They
have hired Latinos on their campaign staffs, and are buying time on
Spanish-language television to get their messages across.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore is to give the keynote address at a
Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute dinner on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Before 1998, Univision never sold more than $500,000 in campaign
ads nationwide. Last year, political advertising sales catapulted
to $8 million, and the revenues are expected to more than double
during the 2000 campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton was rattled into recognizing the
political impact of the Hispanic community in New York last week.
Her repudiation of 16 members of a Puerto Rican nationalist group
so infuriated Puerto Rican political leaders that her support among
these influential people has been threatened.
</P>
<P>
   Latinos do not yet have the national organization and the
campaign-finance clout of some other constituencies. But their
growing influence is already formidable.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the big four states, Latinos are a significant
part of the vote in New Jersey, Michigan, Illinois, and
Connecticut, and are growing in numbers in Colorado, Arizona,
Nevada, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, and North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts and party officials say there are as many as
25 to 30 House seats where the Latino vote could swing the
election. In 13 of those districts, the 1998 winner was elected
with less than 52 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Mobilizing the Latino vote is the Democrats' best chance of
taking back control of the House, something they could do just by
taking five districts away from the Republicans, said John Del
Cacato, spokesman for the Democratic Congressional Campaign
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The rewards are also great for the presidential candidates, but
wooing the Latino vote is fraught with complications. The concerns
of Mexican-Americans in Texas or California differ greatly from
those of Puerto Ricans in New York, or Cubans in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Voting patterns are unpredictable even within ethnic groups.
Cubans, who generally oppose Fidel Castro, tend to be more
Republican, but strongly anti-Castro Democrats have done well among
Cuban-American voters in Florida and New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Latinos tend to be more conservative than African-Americans, and
are not a shoo-in vote for Democratic candidates, especially in
states like Texas, where Governor George W. Bush enjoys good
relations with Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Traditionally, we've been aligned with Democrats. Now, we're
up for grabs,'' said Ingrid Duran, executive director of the
Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, with strong support among Latinos in Texas, not to mention
having a brother who is governor of Florida and a sister-in-law who
is Mexican-American, has a clear edge in Texas and a strong start
in Florida, analysts in both parties say. Democrats have a strong
base in New York, where two-thirds of Latino voters voted for the
Democratic candidate in the last New York City mayoral election.
</P>
<P>
   Bush ``has a record now. He's made some high-profile
appointments. He's helped some Latinos get elected, and they can be
his ambassadors to other states,'' said Robert Jara, an analyst
with the Houston-based Campaign Strategies, which assists mainly
Democratic candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats and Republicans alike say Bush has a bond with
Hispanics that is natural and genuine, transcending the
politician-constituency relationship, much like the relationship
President Clinton has had with African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Whether that relationship can translate elsewhere, however, is
an open question, especially in California, where lingering anger
over what Hispanics perceived as anti-immigrant Republican policies
is still evident.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's biggest problem in California may be the ghost of former
Republican governor Pete Wilson, whose backing of Proposition 187,
which curtailed government services for immigrants, infuriated
Latinos and galvanized many to register and vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush is going to have a real problem in California, even
though he has opposed Proposition 187,'' said Leo Briones, a
Democratic pollster in California.
</P>
<P>
   The successful candidates, Hispanic leaders say, will do more
than utter a few words of Spanish. ``Clearly, they have to be more
sophisticated in their approach,'' said Joe Garcia, the Independent
chairman of the Florida Public Service Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``Latinos are much more savvy today than they were 10 to 15
years ago,'' Garcia said, ``because they've realized how much power
they have.''

   FIELD _ In the movie ``Field of Dreams'' the ghost of Shoeless
Joe Jackson emerges from a stand of corn and asks: ``Is this
Heaven?'' No such luck, Costner responds. But in the end the film
implies that the hereafter would have a hard time beating foul
lines stretching into a Midwestern cornfield. Fans charmed by the
movie's romance with baseball and farm life have come here ever
since, chasing ground balls and nostalgia on base paths. But this
piece of Iowa is Heaven no more. The field's caretakers _ Becky and
Don Lansing own the most of the infield and right field, Rita and
Al Ameskamp hold deed to left and center fields _ can't seem to get
along. In a conflict perhaps as American as the game the field
celebrates, the Lansings and Ameskamps peddle souvenirs out of
competing shacks and regularly settle scores at county zoning panel
meetings. ``It's a shame,'' said Don Lansing. ``It takes away from
the field and the fun for the fans.'' Scott Canon. 32. Photos.

   LEAD: Lead poisoning of children always has been a problem in
Kansas City, but it's only been in the past couple of years that
health authorities have taken a really aggressive approach to
prevention. Armed with federal grant money, new equipment and
tougher laws, hundreds more children now are being tested, and
dozens of homes are being cleaned of lead. Health authorities have
had to work at changing attitudes of doctors, who didn't think lead
was still a problem. And they have had to seek out and train
contractors to do the remediation work. In some Kansas City zip
codes, as many as 26 percent of kids tested have high blood lead
levels, which can reduce IQ and cause learning disabilities, high
blood pressure and kidney damage. Graphics, photos. Alan Bavley.

TRY TIME-IN WHEN TIME-OUT DOESN'T WORK
</HEADLINE>
  (Includes color drawing of a child having a tantrum) 
 By SUZANNE BOYNTON 
 c.1999 NYT Regional Newspapers 
 World rights 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The next time Joshua leaves his action figures all over the den
or Jennifer has a tantrum at the grocery store, don't put the child
in time-out.
</P>
<P>
   Use a time-in.
</P>
<P>
   Coined by parent educator Jean Illsley Clarke, the twist of
phrase represents a spin on the parent's role, as well.
</P>
<P>
   Time-in, she says, isn't meant to be a panacea. It's offered as
a tool for parents to use in redirecting their children's
misbehavior and their own responses.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the first book I've ever written because I was mad,''
said Clarke in a telephone interview from her Minneapolis home. ''I
got so angry at the way people were abusing time-out, I had to do
something.''
</P>
<P>
   Her book, ''Time-In, When Time-Out Doesn't Work,''(Parenting
Press Inc., Seattle, $10) is trim enough to read between a
toddler's tantrums.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with time-out, Clarke said, is that it has been
overused and misused.
</P>
<P>
   Never intended to be a punishment, she said, time-out is a
strategy for giving a child time and space to calm down and think
about what he needs to do or how he can participate in the teaching
that is to follow.
</P>
<P>
   Parents who wanted to stop tantrums and misbehavior without
spanking or screaming became enthusiastic converts to the time-out
method.
</P>
<P>
   But, said Clarke, if a parent finds himself using ''time-outs''
several times a day without noticeable effect, he's probably ready
for time-in.
</P>
<P>
   Time-in shows adults how to engage the child and find out why
she's misbehaving.
</P>
<P>
   The guide is divided into four alliterative sections: Ask, Act,
Attend and Amend. The method is aimed at children ages 1 to 12,
although children under 3 can't be expected to fully respond to
questions (Ask), or to benefit from making amends, Clarke said,
since empathy doesn't appear much before that age.
</P>
<P>
   Time-in isn't just a response to inappropriate behavior. It can
also be used to reinforce positive behavior. And the four stages
can be used in any order the situation requires.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a brief overview of the stages, with examples and tips
for parents:
 &UR; ASK &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When you see inappropriate behavior, ask yourself what lesson
the child needs to learn. If you can ask a question that will teach
the child the lesson, ask it.
</P>
<P>
   Ask only questions the child can answer, and only as many as
needed. Don't ask questions you obviously know the answer to, such
as, ''Who tracked in the mud?'' The child will suspect a trick. And
don't turn an order into a question by ending it with ''OK?''
unless you're really offering the child the option of not picking
up her toys.
</P>
<P>
   Example: Anna, 7, left her coat on the floor for the umpteenth
time. Mother sat down, calmed herself, and in a clear, firm,
pleasant voice, asked, ''Anna, do you know where Daddy's coat
belongs? ... Right, in the closet. Where does Luke's coat belong?
... Right, on the peg.'' Mom grinned and asked, ''Can you guess
what question I'm going to ask next?'' Anna grinned back and hung
up her coat. Mom gave her a big hug. The discipline lesson: Hang up
your coat.
 &UR; ACT &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When a child is headed for or threatening physical danger, act
first, then talk. Sometimes the action needs to be placing the
child in time-out before you can teach the needed lesson with
asking, attending or amending. Act when asking hasn't worked.
Action can prevent an outbreak of misbehavior. Sometimes an action
just seems like the right thing to do, such as modeling appropriate
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Example: Dad noticed that the 9- to 12-year-olds playing
basketball were not challenging a player who was cheating. Suddenly
Dad was part of the game, dribbling, shooting baskets and passing.
Just as suddenly he stood still, held the ball to his chest, and
said, ''In this yard everyone plays by the rules.'' He tossed the
ball to the one who had been cheating, grinned, and left. Dad
directed attention to the cheating without a lecture or shaming.
Discipline lesson: Play by the rules.
 &UR; ATTEND &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This word has so many meanings that it may be the most versatile
of time-in's tools.
</P>
<P>
   It means both ''paying attention to the immediate situation and,
in the larger picture, of teaching children about values and
responsibility,'' Clarke said.
</P>
<P>
   It also means physically attending to injured children and
broken objects. Sometimes, Clarke said, you must attend to the
environment to help avoid further problems.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, attending is the only way a parent can decide whether
the next step is to ask, act, or amend.
</P>
<P>
   Examples: Mom and her friend were chatting. When toddler
Kendall's Cheerios were gone, she used a demanding grunt to get
Mom's attention. Mom said, ''Your Cheerios are gone. I'll get you
some more, OK?'' and went to the kitchen. Kendall screamed. Mom
attended to her own behavior. She replaced ''OK?'' at the end of
her statement with ''Wait.'' Eventually Kendall learned to wait.
Discipline lesson for children: Delayed gratification. Discipline
lesson for adults: Tell young children what they need to do instead
of asking their permission.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed to Dad that his children, 6, 9 and 10, were breaking
the rules more often. He called them together and asked them what
was going on. They replied that there were too many rules to
remember, the rules changed too often, and that he didn't follow
them either.
</P>
<P>
   Together they chose the six most important rules and made a
poster of them and a wallet-sized copy for Dad. Discipline lesson
for parents: Rules must be reasonable, known, understood, and
applicable to all in the family.
 &UR; AMENDS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This part of the strategy will delight parents who have wondered
how to make lessons really sink in and rebuild connections between
children without shaming a child who has injured or offended
another.
</P>
<P>
   Making amends, says Clarke, actually builds self-esteem and
social and problem-solving skills while working to right the wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Clarke cautioned, however, that you can't make amends for
everything; save it for serious misbehaviors. ''What you invite a
child to make amends for depends on what you decide is important
and then only if you have the time, energy and patience to carry
through.''
</P>
<P>
   Amends should:
</P>
<P>
   Represent an effort on the part of the culprit.
</P>
<P>
   Help her become a better person. For example, breaking one of
her own toys is not an appropriate amendment for breaking one of
another child's.
</P>
<P>
   Support family values.
</P>
<P>
   Be related to the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Be acceptable to the victim.
</P>
<P>
   The most important use of amends, Clarke said, is to make amends
to your own child when you have wronged her.
</P>
<P>
   ''That the child learns the steps of amends may not be as
important as the family habit _ the concept that I live in a family
where, if people do something wrong, they attempt to make it right.
If kids get that concept, then as their cognition develops, they
will be much more adept at figuring out options of what to do,''
she says.

POISON PROOF YOUR HOME

<P>
   Bicycle helmets and car seats keep kids safe while they're on
the go, but safety at home is often taken for granted. Medicines,
cosmetics, cleaning products, and lead are common household dangers
for children.
</P>
<P>
   The National Safety Council states that worldwide, 55 to 75
percent of accidental poisonings occur in children under 6 years of
age. Since 1990, U.S. Poison Control Centers have responded to
approximately 1 million poisoning calls involving children under 5
years old. Most of these poisonings occur in the kitchen or
bathroom while a parent is in the room.
</P>
<P>
   Christine Niezabitowska, poison educator at the University of
California Davis Poison Control Center, says that household
cleansers like bleach and pine oil are the most common culprits.
''About 400 to 800 children per year drink pine oil cleaner because
it looks like apple juice,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Niezabitowska adds that it shocks parents to realize that strong
smells and bad tastes don't discourage children from ingesting
chemicals. ''Children have a big association with color and
familiar foods and beverage containers. Pills look like M&AMP;M's and
bleach bottles are shaped like milk bottles.'' Niezabitowska
advises parents to never put toxic substances into recognizable
beverage containers. Always keep them in a locked cabinet and out
of reach.
</P>
<P>
   Poison centers nationwide can help callers safely manage more
than 70 percent of all poisonings at home. The Maryland Poison
Center received 54,1444 calls in 1995, and 25,189 of those cases
were treated at home.
</P>
<P>
   The U.C. California Davis Poison Control Center claims that they
help callers handle 80 percent of their emergencies at home.
</P>
<P>
   ''Always get proper instruction before treating an emergency,''
Niezabitowska advises. ''Throwing up is not always the best thing
to do. Sometimes it is the worst thing to do.'' She warns
caregivers never to give Serum of Ipecac to an unconscious child
because the child could aspirate the vomit.'' She also advises
against using folk remedies.
</P>
<P>
   To thoroughly poison proof your home, make sure all household
chemicals and medicines are in their original containers. Store
them away from food and beverages, and out of reach, in locked
cabinets. Chemicals in the garage need to be locked out of reach as
well. Keep Serum of Ipecac on hand. It can be purchased at the
pharmacy without a prescription.
</P>
<P>
   Most states have toll free poison control numbers. Find them on
the front page of the local phone book or from your local
pediatrician. The number should be put by the phone for
baby-sitters and grandparents to easily access.
</P>
<P>
   Parents need to help grandparents enforce childproofing when the
grandkids come to visit. Grandparents need to keep their
medications in child resistant bottles whenever possible. Encourage
them to put them out of reach, not on the nightstand or on the
bathroom sink.
</P>
<P>
   If grandparents are giving medications to kids, make sure they
have enough light to read the label correctly. Rewriting the
instructions clearly on a 3x5 card may be helpful for them.
</P>
<P>
   Mosquito repellents are considered an insecticide and can be
toxic to children because they are absorbed through the skin. To
find out the safest amount to apply call the poison center, or
physician, and give them the size and weight of your child.
</P>
<P>
   Lead is an invisible poison. It is a metal found in housepaint
used before 1978, hobby materials like solder, and fish weights. It
can also leach into the household water supply through lead pipes.
</P>
<P>
   Lead can travel home on work clothes, in the form of dust, of
those who work in battery and radiator manufacturing shops. It
settles in the soil from chipped house paints, leaded gasoline, and
around industrial areas that use lead.
</P>
<P>
   Keep toddlers away from paint sources like windowsills and
furniture. Check pottery for leaded glazes. Have children wash
their hands after playing in the soil and have parents remove work
clothes before entering the house if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Evaluate your child's risk for lead poisoning by checking if
your house was built before 1978, or if you live in an industrial
community. Pediatrician Mark Miller suggests getting your child
tested if you are in a high risk category. Often there are no
symptoms of lead poisoning. Contact your doctor or local health
department to request lead testing. Testing is done by a simple
blood test.
</P>
<P>
   Before removing any leaded paint it is necessary to contact a
professional in lead removal. Like asbestos any dust or fumes that
escape can cause bigger problems.
</P>
<P>
   HUD, Housing and Urban Development sponsors a directory of
qualified lead inspectors, risk assessors and lead abatements
contractors. The National Lead Information Center, 800-424-5323,
has information about lead and lead poisoning. Both of these groups
can be helpful along with lead abatement consultants and
contractors that can be found in the local phone book.
</P>
<P>
   Poison proof your home and rest easy that your child's
environment will be safe and poison free.

FATHER'S ALZHEIMER'S WAS HER ULTIMATE TEST 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS FARRAGHER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EXETER, N.H. _ He could still read a book, take a walk, and hit
a golf ball long and straight. But the essence of Bob Shaw _ doting
father, legal powerhouse, small-town oracle _ was fading away.
</P>
<P>
   And as he lay awake at night, when his frightening fog would
briefly lift, he knew it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am actually facing facts that only I am completely aware
of,'' Shaw wrote to his three daughters in fall 1992, before his
suspected Alzheimer's disease worsened. ``To put you on notice
before I make a damn fool of myself, I want to retire before the
problem becomes so serious that I won't have the ability or the
sense to recognize it.''
</P>
<P>
   He forgot names. He got lost on his way to the store. Familiar
faces suddenly grew foreign. This summer, having already given up
his law practice, Shaw saw his zealously guarded independence give
way to around-the-clock care.
</P>
<P>
   As his daughters met in emergency council about how to care for
the man who had selflessly cared for them, he issued a final,
non-debatable edict: I must not, he told his family, become a
burden to you.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd go in there in the middle of the night. And he'd be awake
and more lucid than he had been all day, and he was really
concerned because he said he didn't want to be this burden on us,''
said Peg Shaw, his oldest daughter. ``We were all very concerned
about his well-being, because we all love him so much. He did so
much for us. He was with us for every single moment of every day
when we were growing up. How could we not be there for him?''
</P>
<P>
   But Bob Shaw, 84, who had worked hard to build a respected law
office here, had grown accustomed to having his way _ and he
perhaps received it one last time from the muzzle of a gun held by
one of his children.
</P>
<P>
   Beth Katz, 54, who shared his independent streak and his
appreciation for the unconventional, revered her father, by all
accounts. Eleven days ago, after a buoyant evening of home-cooked
food and hearty laughter at Peg Shaw's home in Washington, D.C.,
Beth Katz pushed herself away from her sister's dinner table. She
walked her father down two flights of stairs and took him for an
evening ride in her 1997 Ford Taurus station wagon.
</P>
<P>
   They never came back.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Katz drove to the nearby Washington Hilton Hotel,
where John Hinckley shot President Reagan in 1981, parked the car
out front, walked around, and got into the back seat. She fired two
shots into the back of her father's head and then turned the
.38-caliber handgun on herself, police said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what made it so painful for Bob is that he was aware
that Bob Shaw was slipping through his fingers,'' said Stephen
Woods, Shaw's former law partner here. ``I can well imagine Bob
demanding that he never be a burden on anyone. And Bob was a very,
very forceful individual.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The youngest of five children of Eastern European immigrants,
Bob Shaw was born Aug. 26, 1915, and grew up in what were then the
Jewish neighborhoods of Boston. His name then was Bob Schneiderman,
years before bigotry and business reasons persuaded him to change
his last name.
</P>
<P>
   He attended Roxbury Memorial High School and chummed with
neighborhood pals Maurice Searle, who later became his business
partner, and Theodore H. White, the historian and journalist who
would win a Pulitzer Prize for the first in his series of books on
``The Making of the President.''
</P>
<P>
   In those Depression years, Schneiderman combined work and
school. He studied law at night at Suffolk Law School and worked
for a furrier during the day. In the summers, he, Searle, and White
opened a bicycle rental and bath house business in York Beach,
Maine.
</P>
<P>
   When White left to begin his journalistic career in China,
Schneiderman and Searle began an adventure of their own: They
purchased a dance hall next to a golf course in Newmarket, N.H.,
where their first chore was to repair the roof blown off by the
Hurricane of '38, one of the century's most violent storms.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a lot of people from the Portsmouth Navy Yard,'' Searle
recalled. ``We'd have private parties for submarine crews and serve
them sandwiches and soft drinks. The good ol' days.''
</P>
<P>
   The 2,800-square-foot dance floor, built of rock maple resting
on a bed of springs, fairly rocked as Tommy Dorsey, Glenn Miller,
and the Fenton Brothers put their bands through their paces.
</P>
<P>
   After a stateside stint in the Army, Schneiderman's fledgling
law practice began to demand more of his time. When his application
for membership in a local Chamber of Commerce was rejected because
of his Jewish name, Scheiderman withdrew his application, but he
changed his name to Shaw.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was like a hit in the head for him,'' Searle said. ``He
thought it would be easier on his children.''
</P>
<P>
   As his courtroom triumphs grew, so did his family. Shaw and his
first wife, Selma, raised their children first in a two-family
house across the ballroom parking lot and later at their house in
Exeter, where he quickly became a presence in local politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``At Town Meeting, he defeated so many budget items over the
years that he didn't believe in, they finally put him on the budget
committee,'' Peg Shaw said. ``He was very persuasive.''
</P>
<P>
   He read Supreme Court decisions late into the night and reserved
Sunday morning for father-daughter civic tutorials at which he read
aloud to his girls from the Week in Review section of the New York
Times.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of lawyers were afraid of him because of his
brilliance,'' said David C. Engel, a local lawyer and Shaw's
occasional courtroom opponent. ``He was one of those lawyers who
was very clever in bringing out facts that no one had thought of
and often turning losers into winners.''
</P>
<P>
   The rough edges he sometimes displayed at work, where he
specialized in personal injury law, were softened at home, where
Selma and his daughters endured his temper tantrums and made him
smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``He pretended to be mean _ like a bear _ but he wasn't,'' said
Mildred Wool, a longtime friend. ``He loved his daughters, and Beth
was really his favorite. She was his baby. I can remember him
helping her with her math. He used to teasingly call her his little
knucklehead.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If Bob Shaw betrayed a special affection for his youngest
daughter, the feeling was mutual. By all accounts, Beth Lois Katz
idolized her father.
</P>
<P>
   Like him, she tried to champion the causes of the dispossessed.
What he sought to accomplish in the courtroom, Katz did in the
streets, volunteering with peace groups, protesting the US bombing
in Yugoslavia, and marching in gay rights parades.

   ``She believed that her father represented those who needed to
be represented and fought for the common man and the underdog, so
that would be her cause, too,'' said Liz Signell, a neighbor and
longtime friend.
</P>
<P>
   Divorced a decade ago, Katz lived three blocks from Michigan
State University in East Lansing, where her former husband is an
associate professor. With her two children grown, she took in
graduate school boarders to supplement her income.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was willing to give to other people in a capacity that
most people don't allow themselves to,'' said Jamie Boyce, a former
student who lived with Katz. ``She was very passionate, with a
great sense of humor and a great love of life.''
</P>
<P>
   Katz also struggled with her self-esteem, said friends and
relatives. If her father had been just teasing when he called her a
``knucklehead,'' the appellation nevertheless may have cut too
deeply.
</P>
<P>
   ``She could be really down on herself,'' said Judith Katz, her
oldest child and a student and artist in Chicago. ``She would
criticize herself really meanly sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   A former high school French teacher, Beth Katz conducted teacher
workshops to promote writing in every subject, including math and
science. For 20 years, she was the one-woman star of the Red Rug
Puppet Theater, delighting children with characters like Frilly
Frog, who danced across the stage she wore on her shoulders during
shows in 18 states, Puerto Rico, and Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was like a huge burst of energy in any room,'' Judith Katz
said.
</P>
<P>
   Judy Hood, a friend of Beth Katz's for years until their
friendship fractured after a fight earlier this year, said Katz was
torn by conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   ``When she was performing or presenting, she was euphoric,''
Hood said. ``But at home she was often depressed. . . . She
preached nonviolence but kept a gun in the house for years.''
</P>
<P>
   Signell said she spoke with Katz about her father's declining
health in June, after the family took preliminary steps toward _
but made no decision about _ placing him in a nursing home.
</P>
<P>
   ``When she came back from that visit, she said, `I'm not going
to have my father in a lockup. My father is not going to be in a
lockup,' '' Signell recalled. ``She couldn't stand the idea of her
father being in a place like that. She was very, very opposed to
that idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Judith Katz said her mother bought a handgun in 1997, a purchase
she told no one about. She attended classes sponsored by the
National Rifle Association and honed her shooting skills on a
firing range, her daughter said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was very determined,'' Judith Katz said. ``When she put
her mind to something, that was that. She had a very strong will.''
</P>

<P>
   Four million Americans are severely afflicted with Alzheimer's
disease, which has no known cause or cure. Millions more are
affected by milder forms of dementia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a disease where you gradually lose all the parts of your
mind and personality that really made you a person in the family,''
said Marcelle Morrison-Bogorad, associate director of the
Neuroscience and Neuropsychology of Aging Program at the National
Institute on Aging. ``The family is disrupted because this family
member is there physically but not there mentally. Relationships
are gradually torn apart.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Shaw's family was determined that would not happen to them.
They had seen their father's increasing frustration _ sometimes his
fury _ as he struggled against the disease that was robbing him of
his sense of identity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a has-been,'' he told his daughters.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw had spent two months earlier this year with a daughter in
Central Massachusetts, who has asked that her name be withheld. But
no longer able to drive, Shaw found that life in rural
Massachusetts only fed his growing sense of isolation.
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago, he moved in with his daughter Peg, a former
newspaper reporter who is now a lawyer practicing in Washington.
She hired a caregiver and was willing to host her father as long as
it was practical.
</P>
<P>
   He visited the White House, rode the Metro trains, went to the
zoo, and delighted in his ability to still enjoy a lifelong
passion, hitting golf balls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really into taking care of him and doing it right and
doing it well,'' Peg Shaw said. ``I know that he was going
downhill. But I was not into being hopeless or institutionalizing
him. Beth's perception was so different from mine, apparently.''
</P>
<P>
   As Peg Shaw kept watch, Shaw's other two daughters maintained
constant contact by telephone. ``We were having `grampy'
conversations for the last six months,'' Peg Shaw said. ``The phone
bills have been kind of horrendous.''
</P>
<P>
   His oldest daughter recalled a heart-breaking conversation her
father had with a visiting social worker one evening in late July.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was so clear and graphic about what was happening to him
and how terrible it was to him that he was losing a little piece
here and a little piece there,'' she said. ``If you don't have your
memory, it impacts on your intellect. . . . So, obviously, it
concerned him. And it might have been that he had a conversation
with Beth about that in the last couple of days.''
</P>
<P>
   In the final days of his life, Bob Shaw, who had doted on his
daughters, had that attention repaid. Beth was visiting Peg's
Dupont Circle apartment. There were family meals and funny stories.
</P>
<P>
   On the day before he was killed, Shaw went for a walk, hit some
golf balls, and read aloud from William Manchester's ``The Glory
and the Dream.'' Peg Shaw's husband, Gary Sikora, prepared a lovely
dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``We laughed. We joked. It was a beautiful evening,'' Peg Shaw
said. ``Then Beth took him out for a ride, and neither of them came
back.''
</P>
<P>
   Just before 9 p.m. on Sept. 1, police were called to the
Washington Hilton Hotel. Bob Shaw's body was slumped in the front
passenger seat. His daughter, dead from a single gunshot to the
head, was found in the seat behind him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hell,'' said Judith Katz, Beth's daughter. ``He was
suffering tremendously, and my mother was suffering with him.''
</P>
<P>
   In the days since the murder-suicide, Peg Shaw said, she has
realized that she had never detected the depression that must have
racked her youngest sister. But the lifelong link between a father
and his devoted youngest child was unmistakeable, she said.
</P>
<P>
   It is impossible to know whether Beth Katz acted out of
compassion or to fulfill her father's final request.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beth would never have hurt my father,'' Shaw said. ``She must
have perceived this as the ultimate act of love and generosity. She
adored him. She loved him. All her life, he was so important to
her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess she thought I was a cock-eyed optimist and in deep
denial about how miserable our father was. It's clear that she must
have thought that this was the best thing for him.''

   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHELLEY MURPHY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Loyalty meant everything to Johnny Martorano. He would
do anything for his friends in the notorious Winter Hill Gang _
even kill, which by his own admission he did many times.
</P>
<P>
   The confessed hit man now says he murdered 20 people between
1965 and 1982, three of them, he says, with the help of fugitive
South Boston crime boss James J. ``Whitey'' Bulger, another
half-dozen with the help of Bulger's sidekick, Stephen ``The
Rifleman'' Flemmi.
</P>
<P>
   But that loyalty was strained and eventually shattered last year
when he learned his onetime partners in crime were longtime FBI
informants who fed agents information on foes as well as friends _
including him.
</P>
<P>
   It was that bold affront to Martorano's underworld sense of
justice, that turned him from ruthless street soldier to government
witness, those close to him say.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly not an attempt on John's part to cleanse his
soul. He's not saying he's sorry,'' said a longtime Martorano
associate, who asked that his name not be used. ``I think the
motivation is an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.''
</P>
<P>
   Martorano's friends say he was irate when he learned that
federal prosecutors purposely exempted Bulger and Flemmi from a
1979 indictment charging him and 20 others with fixing horse races
_ a charge that sent Martorano on the run for 16 years.
</P>
<P>
   He also learned that, while he was hiding out in Florida, Flemmi
told the FBI he was in the Miami area.
</P>
<P>
   While the magnitude of Martorano's brutality has stunned the
public _ his victims include a prominent businessman and two
Roxbury teenagers shot for being in the wrong place at the wrong
time _ his friends are not so shocked, recalling his coming of age
in the shoot-em-up world of 1960s gang wars, in which more than 50
people died.
</P>
<P>
   Born Dec. 13, 1940, John Vincent Martorano was the first child
of a father who immigrated from Sicily and a mother of Irish and
English descent who grew up in Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   Angelo and Elizabeth Martorano raised John and his younger
brother, James, in suburban Milton, where both boys excelled in
school and in sports.
</P>
<P>
   A classmate who attended St. Agatha's grammar school with John
Martorano said he was extremely bright, with a world of potential.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you sat next to him in school and the nun handed him a
test with 10 or 20 problems, if it was a 45-minute test he'd have
it done in 10 minutes,'' said a former classmate.
</P>
<P>
   Although Martorano was as tough as he was smart, friends say he
was never a bully.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stevie (Flemmi) would be hitting the desk with a hatchet to
make you faint. . . . But that wasn't John's style,'' said one
associate.
</P>
<P>
   Martorano graduated from Milton High in 1959, co-captaining the
football team with his brother.
</P>
<P>
   Boston later proved to be a major lure for Martorano. He spent a
lot of time at Luigi's, a restaurant his parents owned on the edge
of the Combat Zone. It was there and at another family
establishment in the South End, friends say, that he was introduced
to some of the gangsters who became his friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``You go into a bar and there's a guy with a roll of C-notes
($100 bills), you follow the money,'' said a longtime Martorano
friend. ``When you're a kid you see the guys who are making money:
the bookmakers and the lenders.''
</P>
<P>
   As Martorano was drawn to the flashy guys in the bar, women were
drawn to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always knew him as a fun-loving, really good guy,'' said the
wife of an associate. ``He was like a Barry White. He was always
surrounded by women. I never saw the bad side of him.''
</P>
<P>
   The Martorano brothers met Flemmi in the early 1960s at the
nightclub owned by their father. They met Bulger around 1971.
</P>
<P>
   Martorano has admitted that he killed for the first time on Nov.
15, 1965, when he was 24. The victim, Robert Palladino, 32, of
Winchester, had testified before a Suffolk grand jury that indicted
Martorano's brother, Jimmy, for being an accessory after a young
waitress was murdered and her body stashed in the loft of a
restaurant owned by the Martorano family.
</P>
<P>
   The following year, Martorano admits, he killed another man
expected to be a witness in the same case, John Jackson of the Back
Bay. Federal documents unsealed this week reveal that Martorano has
admitted killing six other people in the 1960s, including the two
Roxbury teenagers.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the 1970s, the Martorano brothers, Bulger, and Flemmi
were part of the Winter Hill Gang, led by Howie Winter. In that
decade, Martorano says, he killed 10 people on behalf of the gang.
</P>
<P>
   When the 1979 race-fixing indictment was returned, Martorano
fled. He remained a fugitive until January 1995, when he was
arrested in Boca Raton, Fla., where he was living with a common-law
wife and their 8-year-old son. He has four other children by three
other women, including an ex-wife.
</P>
<P>
   After his capture, he faced new charges of money laundering and
extortion. But until this week he was never charged with murder.
</P>
<P>
   If a judge approves the deal, Martorano will be sentenced to 12
1/2 to 15 years on federal racketeering and murder charges, in
exchange for providing evidence against Bulger, Flemmi, and others.
Since he has already been in prison for more than four years
awaiting trial in another case, he could be free in eight years.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Martorano's friends insist that the man who killed 20
people will pose no danger to society when he is released.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't consider John an evil person,'' said an associate,
noting that most of his victims ran in the same circles as
Martorano or crossed people who did.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just his lifestyle,'' the associate said. ``It's their
own little society. They break the rules and they know when they
break the rules what is going to happen.''

COLLEGE STUDENTS SAY THEY'LL TAKE MANHATTAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KATE ZERNIKE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The ubiquitous U-Hauls compete with out-of-state
station wagons for double parking spots along the streets. On the
sidewalks, students push industrial-size laundry carts piled high
with posters, pillows, and plants. Stereos and computers sit
curiously unattended, waiting for someone to carry them into the
dorms.
</P>
<P>
   It could be Kenmore Square, the Fenway, Cambridge, anywhere in
back-to-school Boston, except that it's Morningside Heights, New
York, and this picture isn't such an anomaly here anymore.
</P>
<P>
   In its long-running regional inferiority complex with its more
cosmopolitan neighbor to the south, Boston has comforted itself
that it will always be the hub of higher education, home of the
nation's oldest and most renowned university and scores of others,
a mecca to scholars and students worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Start spreading the news: The place where they put tomatoes in
the chowder is threatening to eclipse Boston again.
</P>
<P>
   Lured by internship opportunities they hope to turn into
lucrative careers, a dramatic decline in the crime rate, and of
course, the heady challenge to ``make it there,'' college students
from across the country and around the world have flooded New York
schools with a record number of applications over the past five
years, prompting the Chronicle of Higher Education to declare it a
``Hot College Town.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We like to think Barnard is attractive in its own right, but
we recognize that surely the city is a huge part of it,'' says
Judith Shapiro, president of the women's college.
</P>
<P>
   This year for the first time, New York University overtook
Boston University in attracting the nation's largest number of
international students. Applications at New York's most prominent
colleges have doubled, some almost tripled, since 1991, dwarfing
increases of about 15 percent at Boston's better-known schools, and
even a decline one year at Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   Higher education is also an important part of the city's
economy. A study earlier this year that for the first time ranked
the nation's metropolitan areas on a range of higher education
indicators found New York City highest in nearly all. Colleges and
universities here, the study found, receive more federal funds,
spend more research money, enroll more students, and employ more
staff than those in any other city. The Boston area ranked about
fifth in most categories.
</P>
<P>
   Boston does rank highest in number of students when adjusted for
population; that is, if it feels as if there are more students,
it's because there are fewer people overall. Still, New York comes
in a surprisingly close second: There are 43 students to every
1,000 residents of Greater Boston, 40 students for every 1,000
residents of New York City.
</P>
<P>
   The fortunes of New York colleges began to rise as the city's
crime rate, which peaked with 2,245 murders in 1990, dropped
sharply in the mid-1990s. A notable milestone came in 1993, when
George Rupp arrived as president of Columbia University and began
referring to the school again by its full name, Columbia University
in the City of New York, in speeches and promotional materials.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an extremely conscious effort,'' said Chris Colombo,
Columbia's dean of student affairs. ``In the public eye, when we
had stories about people running through Central Park being mugged,
this was not the place you wanted to visit, much less go to school.
That's changed a great deal, and we've taken a role in running with
that.''
</P>
<P>
   By last year, New York was so plausible a college town that the
WB television network set its drama of college life, ``Felicity,''
at a fictional university here.
</P>
<P>
   The popularity of New York schools also reflects students'
changing interests, noted by college presidents here and across the
country. Students are interested less in what they learn in the
classroom, and more in getting experience and connections to the
best jobs. In its sheer size and range of industries, New York
offers a larger wealth of internships, and the city's colleges have
highlighted that more over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a day and an age when people are thinking more about their
careers, there's much less of people going to college to find
themselves, or looking at it as some kind of club atmosphere,''
said John Beckman, director of public affairs at NYU. ``New York is
a fantastic place to be if that's uppermost in students' and
families' minds.''
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, Boston may be the victim of its own success.
</P>
<P>
   Sara Jasnow, 18, a Barnard freshman from Smithtown on Long
Island, said she considered going to schools in the Boston area,
especially Tufts, until she talked to a cousin who had done so.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boston is, like, a major college area, so when you get out,
it's going to be much more difficult to get positions,'' she said.
``You're going to be just like everybody else looking for a job.
There's more opportunity to go around in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Higher education institutions _ 95 in the five boroughs,
according to the Association for a Better New York, about the same
number as within the I-495 beltway around Boston _ have also put
new emphasis on the city's glamour and diversity of culture. In
recent years, more have developed internships with a range of
companies, and created programs to give students free admission to
museums and concerts across the city. At Columbia, Neil Simon, then
Carly Simon, visited for intimate chats in the dorms. Sylvia, of
Harlem soul food fame, even came to cook a meal.
</P>
<P>
   The school's promotional video divides its footage equally
between Columbia's famed core curriculum and the virtues of New
York. After showing off Tom's Restaurant, the Morningside Heights
facade made famous by ``Seinfeld,'' a group of students boards a
notably graffiti-free subway car to tour the city, showing off
Lincoln Center on the way. In a new PG-rated Times Square, one
student reminisces about an all-night bike ride through the city in
a history of New York class. Another points out the Virgin
Megastore, recommending it for 2 a.m. CD cravings. (What she
doesn't add, but might, is: Try satisfying that in Boston.)
</P>
<P>
   As much as the city is cleaner and more vibrant, the campuses,
too, reflect their new popularity. Around West 116th Street, where
students not so long ago stayed pretty much within Columbia's high
walls, Broadway has become a boulevard of upscale bakeries, bars
and shops. With more students coming from out of town _ about 80
percent at NYU, up from about 50 percent a decade ago, and over 90
percent at Barnard, up from 60 percent _ almost every campus is
building at least one tall, sleek new dorm. St. John's, in Queens,
opened its first dorms this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being from Maine, I was a little freaked out,'' admits
Katherine McKenney, a Barnard sophomore from a town she describes
as one stoplight, one mailbox. ``But I feel safe here. And there's
tons and tons of opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``On paper, it didn't look like the right match at all,'' adds
her mother, Susan, helping to unload the family's Volvo. ``It
didn't seem friendly and nurturing; we never gave it a thought.
Then we came to visit her friend here, and when I saw how happy she
was, I knew Katherine would be happy here, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, some people still worry about security.
</P>
<P>
   Barnard sophomore Audrey Stegmeyer's mother, nearby in New
Jersey, insists her daughter carry a cellular phone when she leaves
the school's grounds. Barnard orientation includes _ in addition to
a trip to a drag queen dance club _ a mandatory seminar dubbed
``Learn to be a New Yorker in 45 Minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   But for the most part, the 500 or so freshmen in the crowd don't
seem too concerned. One rearranges pages in her Filofax, others
check out the gleaming new gymnasium around them. Developing
attitude, apparently, is just another part of the New York
experience.
</P>
<P>
   As Jane Finnegan, the school's chief of security, tells the
crowd, ``It's perfectly OK to be rude. If you're a healthy New York
woman, you can be rude, you can be a little suspicious. When you go
home, you can tell people you've become a New Yorker. And that's
OK.''

GETTING REAL ABOUT GROWTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I am 30 and earn $115,000 a year. My wife is 27 and is now a
stay-at-home mother. I'm sorry to say I just started investing two
years ago and most of my friends have a huge jump on me, so I feel
I have some catching up to do. We have set a goal of retirement at
age 50 with retirement assets of $2 million, well aware that
inflation over the next 20 years will dictate a need of $200,000 of
income to maintain our current lifestyle. We currently are saving
$1,267 a month for retirement, all invested in equities. We each
have Roth IRAs with Vanguard, invested in its Index Growth, US
Growth, and Health Care funds. With next year's contributions, I
plan to add Vanguard's European Index, and eventually to balance
the four funds evenly. I have just started with my company's 401(k)
plan and have $2,500 in Maxim Index Growth, American Century
Twentieth Century Ultra, AIM Weingarten, and AIM Charter.
Allocations are 30 percent each to Maxim and Charter and 20 percent
each to Weingarten and Charter. I plan on contributing the $10,000
annual maximum. Finally, I have just started building a taxable
account in Janus 20, with an $800 current balance and contributions
of $100 a month. If we maintain a 15 percent annual return (which
may not be realistic and sustainable) will we attain our goal in 20
years? If not, what rate of return must I achieve? What if I waited
until I was 55 or 60 to retire?
</P>
<P>
   B.B., Easton, Pa. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Your parenthesis says it all: Your growth projection is
neither realistic nor sustainable.
</P>
<P>
   But even if you were to make such a return, you would fall a bit
short by age 50, amassing only $1,890,732. At a more realistic
annual growth projection of 10 percent average returns, you would
accumulate $1,003,651, only a little more than half your target
figure.
</P>
<P>
   (And your assumption that you would need $200,000 income to
maintain your current lifestyle is very close _ it would require
$198,987 in 20 years to buy what $100,000 buys today, presuming a
3.5 percent inflation rate.)
</P>
<P>
   To reach the $2 million level by age 50 with the more realistic
assumption of 10 percent average portfolio growth, you would have
to save more than double your current savings level _ going to
$2,653 a month. If you continued at your current level, you would
accumulate $1,713,581 at age 55 and $2,856,655 by age 60, using the
10 prcent growth assumption.
</P>
<P>
   (To answer your other question, you would need a 15.44 percent
average annual return to build a $2 million portfolio over 20 years
with your current savings level, but, as I indicated, that's just a
dream.)
</P>
<P>
   To be even gloomier, I question if a $2 million nest egg is
enough to guarantee a comfortable retirement at your current
lifestyle beginning at age 50.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you were to gamble that you could keep your money in
stocks that would deliver a 10 percent annual return over the long
haul, you would be withdrawing all of that return to provide your
income stream.
</P>
<P>
   That would leave nothing invested to protect against the
inevitable inflation of your later retirement years _ a factor that
assumes increasing importance the earlier you retire.
</P>
<P>
   So unless you dramatically increase your level of savings, it
would be more realistic to think of retirement around age 60 rather
than at 50.
</P>
<P>
   To quickly answer a few additional questions you asked but which
I edited from your letter:
</P>
<P>
   Yes, there is a way to withdraw funds from your tax-deferred
accounts before age 59 1/2 without penalty, but nowhere near at the
level you proposed.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, I think your diversification and choice of funds is fine,
and yes, I also like your idea of adding mid-cap and small-cap
funds. Finally, yes, Vanguard offers a fairly new fund called
Mid-Cap Index, which has thus far delivered a solid performance.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My husband and I are in our mid-to-early 70s and are in the
28 percent tax bracket. My taxable savings are invested in mutual
funds, with $10,000 in Vanguard Index 500 and $34,000 in Templeton
Growth fund (which I plan to move into a no-load fund), plus an
additional $25,000 in a savings account, to be added to these
accounts. In my IRA I have approximately $115,000, with 12 percent
of it in stock of America Online, 19 percent in Cisco Systems, 19
percent in EMC Corp., 22 percent in IBM Corp., 17 percent in
Wal-Mart, and the rest in government securities and waiting to be
otherwise invested. With all the above, I am hoping for a five- to
10-year investment time frame. I hope not to take out any funds
except the mandatory withdrawals, which along with my Social
Security benefits I plan to use for travel. What do you recommend?
</P>
<P>
   G.R., San Diego &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. There's an old Wall Street saying that bulls can make money
and bears can make money, but piggies always lose.
</P>
<P>
   I checked the paper for quotes on your five individual stocks,
looking at the statistics as of the closing on Sept. 7. Three were
at prices that were about three times or more of their 52-week
lows; another was at more than double its low; and the most modest
spread (Wal-Mart) showed a 77 percent advance from the low.
</P>
<P>
   At the other end of the scale, one issue, Cisco Systems, was at
its 52-week high, two others were within 10 percent of their
52-week highs, and one was within 20 percent. Only one issue was
far from its high _ AOL, where the price represented only 53
percent of its 52-week high, but which also was 452 percent of its
low price.
</P>
<P>
   Briefly, I would sell all or most of these positions. I realize
you are in a position to take a long-term view of these holdings,
but the idea of having more than 56 percent of your savings in five
individual stocks strikes me as too risky _ not too risky for a
person in their 70s, but too risky for anybody.
</P>
<P>
   Since the individual stock holdings are in your IRA, there would
be no tax consequence of the sales, provided you left the proceeds
in the IRA.
</P>
<P>
   If you wanted to keep all of the money in stocks, I would
reinvest this money in a portfolio of Vanguard Index funds _
perhaps 40 percent in Vanguard Index Value, 20 percent in its Index
Growth, and 20 percent each in its Mid-Cap and Small-Cap Index
funds.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Templeton Growth holding, I'm not sure why you want
to sell: It has a very solid record. You cite a preference for
no-load funds, but since you already hold this position, you either
have already paid the load or will probably pay a load when you
sell, so there's nothing to be gained by leaving.
</P>
<P>
   You might, indeed, favor a no-load fund when it comes to
investing the money that's now in savings. But if I were in your
shoes, I would maintain at least your current level, a little less
than 20 percent of the total portfolio, on the fixed-income side.
For this I would favor a mutual fund money market or bond fund
rather than a traditional savings account.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I would like to establish a fund for my new grandson that I
hope will amount to $100,000 in 15 to 18 years. I have about
$25,000 set aside for this. Can you suggest where I might place
this money to achieve this objective?
</P>
<P>
   L.A., Newton, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I'll give you two suggestions, both fairly cautious, but one
more conservative than the other.
</P>
<P>
   To achieve a $100,000 accumulation from the investment of
$25,000 over 15 years, you would need to achieve 9.68 percent
average annual returns; to do the job over 18 years would require
8.01 percent average returns.
</P>
<P>
   It strikes me as likely that you could meet the goal with the
more cautious investment _ in a balanced mutual find, which divides
its portfolio between stocks and bonds, typically with about
three-fifths of the money in stocks and the rest in bonds or cash.
Solid examples here would be Fidelity Puritan and Vanguard Balanced
Index Funds.
</P>
<P>
   To be a little more aggressive, and accordingly to assume more
risk, you could go with a value-oriented large-capitalization stock
fund. Solid examples here might be Fidelity Equity-Income II or
Vanguard Index Value funds.

dysfunctional-family stuff is lifted beyond the ordinary by the

over-aggressive direction prevents this one from unnerving us with

PERABO'S DEBUT OFFERS SHORT STORIES OF SUBSTANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALISON ARNETT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
WHO I WAS SUPPOSED TO BE 
By Susan Perabo 
Simon &AMP; Schuster, 191 pp., $20 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Short stories are often viewed as beginner's exercises for a
novelist, the way a novice tunes up for the sustained effort of a
full work of fiction. And in their modern incarnation, many a short
story seems a quickly sketched scene, a mere suggestion of a plot
and characters _ much attitude and little substance.
</P>
<P>
   That's not at all the case with the stories of Susan Perabo, who
in her first published collection neatly sidesteps those problems
by concentrating a precise and lucid focus on her characters. As a
result, in stories as short as 6 or 14 pages, people _ some of them
odd, some as ordinary as your next-door neighbor _ gain an
unexpected vitality.
</P>
<P>
   Perabo, who teaches writing at Dickinson University in
Pennsylvania, does have an eye for the quirky that's reminiscent of
Eudora Welty. Like Welty, the 29-year-old Perabo transcends her age
and gender, as when she illuminates a 12-year-old boy who
unexpectedly bonds with a father he feels is nerdy, or an aging
film star whose father's kleptomania shakes his world, or two
losers who find it impossible to sell one of Princess Diana's
ballgowns to make the killing they desperately need.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was twelve the summer I watched four men beat up my father
on a softball field at his company picnic,'' begins the title
story. Eddie succinctly describes his bookkeeper father, who was
pummeled by truck drivers he'd turned in for cheating, by
describing his mother. ``Like my father, my mother was little too,
but was that tough, compact kind of little that my father had never
been able to achieve.'' His mother's disdain for his father's
weaknesses puts the boy in the middle, eager to escape from the
sadness and defeat that surround his home. But as things get worse
and his father is let go from his job, the two meet at the bathroom
mirror in the quintessential adolescents' fantasy. ``My father came
back into the bathroom with the rest of the pack of cigarettes and
his prescription sunglasses. He picked up mine off the sink and fit
them onto my head. . . . He lit a cigarette and handed it to me,
then lit one for himself. ``. . . I giggled, trying to be the guy
(in the mirror) but being myself because I was embarrassed.
</P>
<P>
   ``. . . He looked as mean as any guy I'd ever seen. . . .
Through the fog we scrutinized the guys in the mirror.''
</P>
<P>
   A longer story tells of another parent-child relationship, this
one as quirky and as neatly role-reversed. A woman, defeatedly
going through a second divorce, is summoned back to the little
hometown she hated. ``And so I returned to my childhood home of
Carlisle, Illionis, population thirty-five hundred morons.'' A nosy
neighbor has called to tell Kathy that her recently widowed mother
is squandering all she owns on lottery tickets. Which Mother, a
retired schoolteacher, unrepentantly is doing. As the story plays
out, Kathy persuades her mother to go to Gamblers Anonymous
meetings, where mother corrects the participants' grammar. And
Kathy meets Andy, who bets on horses and subtly, but determinedly,
courts her.
</P>
<P>
   Though Kathy had come to save her mother from herself, she finds
her mother chiding her instead, finally telling her to leave. The
ending is as gently drawn as the rest of the story, so that the
town takes on almost as much personality as the characters. But
Kathy seems to have listened to her mother's plea: ``Honey, don't
you ever just want to hope for something?'' There's a whiff of
winning at the end, even for a small-town gambler.
</P>
<P>
   Not all the stories or their characters are so endearing. A few
of the stories stretch on too long, losing the thread of interest
in the character even as the plot unfolds. A man who's been pushed
out of his ex-wife's life tries to win her back by faking amnesia;
by the end of it, he's too unlikable to care about. A story about
two children who shove a bully off a cliff is uncharacteristically
histrionic; in this day of horror-movie cliche, I kept waiting for
the bloody conclusion. And the one about Batman's butler was just a
little too weird.
</P>
<P>
   But in ``Explaining Death to the Dog,'' a woman tries to
convince her dog that her baby isn't coming back, and Perabo
encapsulates grief in the most visceral way in six short pages.
</P>
<P>
   Perabo, who has the distinction of being the first woman to have
played NCAA baseball (and therefore is represented in the Baseball
Hall of Fame), for a few brief moments makes us identify with
unusual and sometimes difficult people. It's a lovely gift.

WHY DOES IT TAKE SO LONG TO FEEL A STUBBED TOE? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ROPEIK  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. Why is it that when I stub my toe it takes a few seconds for
the pain message to reach my brain, whereas when I hurt any other
part, the pain is relatively instantaneous?
</P>
<P>
   P.T., Arlington, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. You have three different kinds of nerve fibers running from
your touch and pain receptors to your brain. They carry their
traffic, the nerve impulses, at dramatically different speeds.
Think of the slow one as downtown traffic at rush hour, the middle
one as highway traffic, and the fast one as the Indianapolis 500.
</P>
<P>
   Touch and pain signals travel on separate nerve ``highways.''
And in the race to the brain, touch wins. The fastest of the three
types of nerves, the A beta fibers, transmit a signal at roughly
100 feet per second. They run out of the various receptors we have
that sense touch. The main ones just under the skin in our hands
and feet are called Meissner corpuscles. Merkel's disks are most
common in our lips and genital skin. Other touch receptors deeper
down in our skin and in our internal organs are called Pacinian
corpuscles and Ruffini's corpuscles. They all trigger messages
carried by those speedy A beta nerves.
</P>
<P>
   The next fastest fiber is the A delta nerve, which transmits
signals at 9 feet per second. A deltafibers extend out from
nociceptors, pain sensing nerve endings in the skin. Some
nociceptors detect only mechanical stimuli, like the poke of a pin.
Others sense mechanical and thermal input like hot or cold. Others
sense those two, plus chemical stimuli, like capsacin, the fiery
ingredient in hot sauce.
</P>
<P>
   A delta fibers are responsible for what is called
</P>
<P>
   first pain, the sharp, localized, immediate pain you get from a
burn or cut.
</P>
<P>
   The slowest nerve fibers are the C fibers. They transmit
messages at the relatively sluggish speeds of between one-half and
one-and-a-half feet per second. They are also triggered by
nociceptors. C fibers create what is called second pain, the
duller, longer-lasting, less-localized ache of a stubbed toe.
</P>
<P>
   How do these fibers transmit information at different speeds?
The A betas and A deltas are wrapped in myelin, a fatty substance
that acts like an insulator. The insulation let the signal travel
faster. And there are gaps in the myelin coating, called Nodes of
Ranvier which make the signal do a kind of jump to get from one
side to the other, which accelerates it. Because the C fibers
aren't wrapped by insulating myelin, and no Nodes of Ranvier, they
send their signals along more slowly.
</P>
<P>
   So here's what happens when someone six feet tall stubs their
toe. In less than one tenth of a second, the A beta fibers tell you
you've just touched something. In two-thirds of a second the A
delta fibers deliver the first news of the pain. Then along comes
the dull throbbing message from those sluggish C fibers over the
next four to nine seconds telling you to wear shoes next time.

`ANYTHING GOES' FOR WOMEN'S FASHION IN THE NEW MILLENNIUM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUZANNE C. RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The fashion industry is gathering here this week to
observe a watershed moment: the unveiling of the first women's
collections of the new millennium. Foreshadowing lifestyles and
attitudes of the next century, the spring 2000 designs are expected
to emphasize individuality.
</P>
<P>
   There will be no rules, no ``must-wear'' color, no prescribed
hemline. Skirts? Think ankle-length, knee-length, or shorter. Shoes
will be square-toed or oblique, whether high-heeled or flat. The
slogan for 2000, it seems, will be ``anything goes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Fashion now is about taking what is out there and making it
your own,'' said Be Bilzerian, women's buyer at Alan Bilzerian.
``No longer is it true, `If you don't have this outfit, you're out'
or `I only wear this length skirt.' The mentality is changing. It's
a natural progression in the story of fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   It's certainly a far cry from the 1990s, which treated fashion
as a groupthink experience. To be counted among the stylish, you
had to wear items like black pantsuits, cardigan sweaters, and
sheath dresses. The Gap, for one, has a new ad campaign that may
best sum up the decade's conformity. Its billboards _ targeted to
men, women, and children _ read: ``Everybody in vests.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts say the independence movement, which started this fall
with the hippie-chic trend, is emerging for a variety of reasons.
For one thing, the casualization of the workplace has allowed women
to feel comfortable breaking traditional rules of dress. And
greater sartorial freedoms have come as more women have risen
through corporate ranks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole '90s was about getting away from the power '80s,''
said Mary Lou Andre, president of the wardrobe management company
Organization by Design. ``Women made great strides and were not
afraid to express themselves (in more feminine clothing).''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, perhaps more than ever, consumers of all
backgrounds are better educated about fashion now that there are
fashion TV programs like E! Fashion, Internet sites operated by
designers like Helmut Lang, dozens of monthly magazines like Vogue
and Elle, and multimillion-dollar ad campaigns by designers like
Calvin Klein. With such exposure comes a confidence to take risks
and make personal style choices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fashion is a lot more in your face,'' said designer Sigrid
Olsen, 84.5 percent of whose company is owned by Liz Claiborne Inc.
``It's not just a territory that belongs to people in the fashion
industry and people under 21. This is a monumental change. Women of
all ages and sizes now feel there is something out there for them
that's fashionable.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, economics and the natural cycle of fashion play a
part in the trend too. The fate of designers like Isaac Mizrahi (a
popular New Yorker who went out of business last year) and Todd
Oldham (who shut down his primary couture collection last year)
taught the industry that women want wearable clothing and they want
variety. ``We all have a closet full of black clothes,'' said
Patricia Warner, a costume historian and associate professor in the
consumer studies department at the University of Massachusetts at
Amherst.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people are very, very bored with the same things
everywhere. How many black slip dresses can you see from how many
designers?'' said Warner.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of moving to a ``new black,'' many designers say they
plan to be more creative in 2000, using colors from the entire
spectrum of the rainbow, as well as floral prints and other print
designs. ``I like to think that designers are getting away from the
kooky and doing just beautiful, beautiful clothing,'' said South
End designer Denise Hajjar, who sells to local TV personalities Liz
Walker, Liz Brunner, and Hank Phillippi Ryan.
</P>
<P>
   Innovation at the start of the new century may not be in
silhouettes, she said, but in interesting fabric choices. ``You're
going to see fabrics used all year 'round now,'' said Hajjar.
``You'll see leather in spring, in ice tones and pale colors,
combined with chiffon or a tissue-weight wool. You'll see more
prints. People are starting to like prints again.''
</P>
<P>
   New York designer Donna Morgan plans to encourage customers to
``play with her clothes,'' mixing and matching the unexpected.
Customers ``can wear a beaded shell with jeans or a wonderful
evening skirt with a T-shirt on top,'' said Morgan, whose clothes
are sold in stores like Filene's and Lord &AMP; Taylor. ``There needs
to be an attitude change in the customer that she has the
confidence to do it. You probably need to make (fewer) purchases
when you learn to work with your wardrobe.''
</P>
<P>
   William Calvert, one of more than 70 American designers to show
his spring collection during New York fashion week, featured gowns,
suits, and skirts in his show Sunday, with elements such as
iridescent fabrics, satins, and pearl accessories.
</P>
<P>
   His hope? To encourage people to dress up a little more _ and on
their own terms _ in the new century. ``I think that since people
are face-to-face so much less now _ you don't see a bank teller,
the only people you see are the people who cut your hair _ when
people do meet up together, there should be more ceremony put into
it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the race to get ahead, people forgot that they need to . .
. look good for each other. I would like to see more effort. It's
not always the end result that counts.''
</P>
<P>
   Shari Thurer, a psychologist at Boston University, said the move
away from fashion uniformity and rules reflects a postmodern
sensibility that has been reflected in film, art, music, and
architecture. ``One of the ideas of postmodernism is that it plays
with the rules and makes them visible.
</P>
<P>
   ``In `Pulp Fiction,' (director) Quentin Tarantino plays with
expectations that these criminals are going to act criminal.
Instead he has them arguing over the price of hamburgers.'' In
music, she added, rappers are taking songs from various eras, such
as the '70s, and inserting their own voices on the tracks.
</P>
<P>
   And in fashion, designers are deliberately exposing the seams of
clothing, rather than hiding them. ``That which was hidden and
subtle becomes exposed and privileged,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Postmodernism is inherently cynical and ironic. It questions
all the norms because many of the norms are false. Suddenly, you
can wear something this way or that way. The genders are no longer
distinct. Women's clothing will incorporate qualities that were
once men's, like a fly on boxer shorts or women in military gear. .
. . Olive drab used to signify war and men. Now it signifies Chanel
and upscale. It's all playing with metaphors. I like this better
than minimalism. It makes fashion a lot more interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of what looks consumers come to embrace, spring will
almost certainly spell individualism. Said Olsen, ``There's going
to be a lot more choices out there for women.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to be eclectic, you can be. If you want to be more
modern and updated, you can be. (The point) is to feel that you're
making some statement of individuality. Yes, choices have always
been there, but they were not always fashionable.''

SHADOW OF THE CLINTONS IS A COLD, DARK PLACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT A. JORDAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   While Texas Gov. George W. Bush appears to have a relatively
easy ride at this early stage in the Republican presidential
nomination process, Vice President Al Gore is finding it tougher
going on the Democratic side of the race.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's campaign is being eclipsed not only by the unexpected
strong showing of Democratic rival Bill Bradley, but also by the
high-profile media presence of two of his stalwart supporters,
President Bill Clinton and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Even when on vacation or house hunting, the Clintons seem to be
capturing more media space than Gore. So, too, Clinton's battles
with Republicans over his promised veto of the GOP's major tax cut
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   And Clinton's controversial agreement to grant clemency to
jailed Puerto Rican nationalists (also called terrorists) has also
held the media spotlight, although not always flattering, on the
president and the First Lady.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary's apparent flip-flop on the clemency issue _ first she
supported it, but when that angered the powerful voters in upper
state New York, she said it should be rescinded _ made both upper
New York voters and Puerto Rican voters in New York upset with her.
The GOP is also saying that Clinton's offer of clemency was
politically motivated to help gain the Puerto Rican vote in New
York for his wife.
</P>
<P>
   While such controversies continue to rub off on Gore _ forever
linked to Clinton as his vice president _ Bush's campaign is
rolling along, despite a few bumps in the road over how he handled
questions of past drug use.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons' high media profile is not, of course, the only
source of all of Gore's campaign problems. As he demonstrated
during his recent visit to Boston, he can create his own problems
without anyone's help.
</P>
<P>
   At the Boston visit, he announced $5 million in emergency aid
for New England fishermen, suggesting the help was primarily of his
own doing. However, the all-Democratic Massachusetts congressional
delegation found out that Gore was talking about a grant that was
not only more than a year old, but was the result of a lot of hard
work by members of the delegation. Gore later called US Sen. John
Kerry to apologize, but he will have to do more to earn the strong,
active support he will need to win big in the Bay State.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's major dilemma is how to separate himself from the
negatives of the Clinton administration without disconnecting
himself from the administration's economic success story.
</P>
<P>
   As popular as Clinton is with the electorate, there are signs in
various polls that voters would like to see his administration come
to an end. Bush's current lead in the polls over Gore may reflect
voters' view that a Gore presidency would be an extension of the
Clinton administration, not a new Gore era. If that perception
continues to next November, Gore could be in serious trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's clean image does not appear to help him in his battle
with Bradley, who also has a clean image, or against Bush, who is
slightly tainted with the alleged drug use issue in his earlier
days. Bush's decision to go no further than his statement that he
has not been involved in drugs for 25 years may even be helping him
with voters, who like the way he has challenged the media on the
topic.
</P>
<P>
   Strangely, Bush's ability to connect at this early stage with so
many voters makes him more like Clinton who, with his flaws, still
kept his strong appeal among a wide range of voters. And like
Clinton, Bush can be forgiven for any early drug use as the voters
forgave Clinton for his past misdeeds.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is still likely to be the Democratic nominee for president.
Bradley will gain more support as the campaign rolls along, but
most of the delegates at the Democratic convention are expected to
support Gore over Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   And Gore, with all his stiffness and his current inability to
articulate a clear message, will have the strong backing of
organized labor. Gore will also need the help of key people such as
the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson, who can help him gain a strong black
vote and Hillary Clinton, who can help him gain support among women
in New York and across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps sparring with Bradley may help get Gore in shape _ make
him less stiff, quicker on his feet _ for the big fight with Bush
next year.
</P>
<P>
   And it may be just what Gore needs to fight his way out of
Clinton's shadow. In the end, however, his biggest challenge will
be to win the support of the electorate. If he is to have any
chance of doing so, he had best start loosening up.

NETWORKS VIE TO GET MORE YARDAGE OUT OF PRO FOOTBALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PETE DOUGHERTY  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stretching is an important preliminary to any sporting routine.
Now, television is giving fans three hours of warm-up exercises for
what can be a 10-hour day of viewing NFL games.
</P>
<P>
   From 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. (the time when most Sunday games kick
off), five national networks will produce NFL pregame shows. Fox
Sports Net joins the congestion this season with the ``NFL This
Morning.'' CBS, whose ``NFL Today'' trailed Fox's ``NFL Sunday'' by
37 percent in the ratings last season, overhauled its lineup. CNN,
which airs ``NFL Preview'' uncontested in the 10-11 a.m. slot, and
ESPN, whose ``NFL Countdown'' is the only two-hour presentation in
the bunch, have tweaked their shows.
</P>
<P>
   It is all part of a frenzy spurred in part by NFL fans _ many of
whom are mindful of their fantasy-league players _ and their thirst
for information.
</P>
<P>
   A viewer trying to catch all of this could be weary before the
games even begin. ``People watch them, which is why they produce
them,'' CBS Sports president Sean McManus said. ``If they weren't
being watched, if the advertising revenue wasn't significant, they
wouldn't be produced.''
</P>
<P>
   So how much is too much? ESPN asked that question 20 years ago
when it created the first all-sports network, and it still hasn't
found the answer. The NFL keeps expanding its menu to see how much
its viewers can take.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the day of the game, I don't know that there is a
saturation point,'' said Chris Myers, who will anchor Fox Sports
Net's new show. ``The true football fan, that's why they go
tailgate a couple of hours before the game. They just want to be
around football and talking about it. On Sunday morning, when
people wake up, that's what they want. I think there will be a
24-hour NFL channel in our future somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   The infusion of pregame programming invites problems into the
mix. Each show wants to be different, but how many directions can
they all go? Fox emphasizes entertainment. ESPN specializes in news
and information. CBS, which replaced three rookie studio analysts
with TV-savvy veterans, is looking for a mix. CNN, which had the
lowest-rated of the four shows last year, and Fox Sports Net are
hoping not to get lost in the masses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gets back to the old CBS `NFL Today,''' said Fox executive
producer Ed Goren, who produced that CBS show before moving to his
Fox in 1994. ``We said if we only had a hour show, wouldn't life be
wonderful from a producer's point of view. Then we started an hour
show here five years ago, and there isn't a week that goes by where
we're not saying wouldn't it be great to have an hour and a half.''
</P>
<P>
   Affiliate problems prevented Fox from expanding ``NFL Sunday,''
so the network's cable arm became the newest player in the game.
``We feel like we can do the best show out there,'' Fox Sports Net
executive producer Arthur Smith said. ``That was our motivation for
doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   ESPN became the first to go with an hour show back in 1986, when
CBS and NBC, which no longer is involved in the NFL, had half-hour
pregames. When the over-the-air networks went to an hour, ESPN
expanded to 75 minutes, then to 90, and last year to its current
two hours.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas it once had the 11 a.m.-noon hour to itself, ESPN now
competes with Fox Sports Net's show. ESPN, which added Stuart Scott
and Suzy Kolber to its cauldron of on-air personnel this year, has
always had the problem of trying to hold its early viewers once the
CBS and Fox shows come on the air at noon. Should the network run
its best stuff in the first hour or save it for a better
competitive posture against the two big networks?
</P>
<P>
   ``In a different week you'll juggle differently,'' said Bob
Rauscher, senior coordinating producer for ESPN. ``It could be a
little different this year with Fox Sports Net having a show.
You'll have to be a little more aware of the competition than you
were before.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't just start off and say we'll put our (weaker) stuff
in the first hour and we'll save all the good stuff. People might
just say this show's not that good. On the other hand, you can't
use all your stuff early, because then the other shows come on and
they might have a better presentation. It's a fine balance. You
hope to get good material overall.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not always possible in the current environment. Imagine a
week in which four networks arrive at, for instance, Miami Dolphins
practice, looking to do a feature on Dan Marino. If you've seen one
version, is it as good as seeing them all?
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to show these players in a personal light,'' said Bill
Galvin, executive producer for CNN, which added former University
of Nebraska linebacker Trev Alberts to its team. ``We try to show
them away from the field, without the helmets, without the pads.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You hope that your relationship makes it a personable
interview in that case,'' said Craig James, a CBS studio analyst
and former NFL running back. ``If I'm doing it or (Fox's) James
Brown is doing it or one of the ESPN guys is doing it, they're
going to answer us all nicely. What I'm going to do is then talk to
a lot of players and maybe get support for what I'm doing. You've
got to work that little bit more because it's very competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   The competition will be as intense as ever. Each network has its
``information men,'' reporters who are responsible for breaking
stories before they become public. ``It has become pretty much a
ruthless, cut-throat, dog-eat-dog business,'' said Peter King, an
``NFL Preview'' reporter. ``The hardest thing is to find something
out at Friday at 4 o'clock and have nobody find out by Sunday
morning at 10. It's virtually impossible anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, the competition is stronger than it's ever been, and
all of us who are in the information business right now look at it
and say that if we don't bring our `A' games to the table every
week, we're going to get slaughtered.''

POLLUTION IS DOWN, SO SHOULD LAWS GO? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT ALLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's the kind of news story that gives corporate executives
nightmares: the government release of a ``worst polluters'' list.
Being on ``the list'' means protesters at the gate, more regulators
prowling around, and the simple embarrassment of explaining to
friends and family.
</P>
<P>
   Monsanto President Richard Mahoney got his nightmare in 1989,
the first year the federal government required major companies to
tally up how much pollution they were creating and make the figures
available to the public. To his chagrin, the chemical giant was
ranked one of the worst air polluters in the country, prompting
Mahoney to angrily order a 90 percent emissions cut even before the
bad news hit the press.
</P>
<P>
   But times have changed since public humiliation first became a
tool to clean up the environment. From 1990 to 1997, Massachusetts
manufacturers reduced toxic releases to the land, air and water by
80 percent, part of a national trend as manufacturers become
increasingly sophisticated and proactive in their approach to
pollution control.
</P>
<P>
   Now, corporations say they deserve a break from some of the
toxic chemical reports that are so often used against them. Earlier
this year, they helped fight off a federal proposal to describe
potential worst case disasters at their plants on the Internet,
while, in Massachusetts, they are fighting to weaken or repeal the
nation's strictest chemical reporting law.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obvious that industry has demonstrated a tendency toward
enlightened environmentalism over the past 15 years . . . We
deserve a chance,'' said Ed Jamro of Solutia Inc. in Springfield,
formerly part of Monsanto, at a recent hearing in Boston on changes
to the state's Toxics Use Reduction Act.
</P>
<P>
   Jamro argued that the law straitjackets companies by forcing
them to report toxic chemicals they use and their plans to reduce
them. He and other chemical industry officials said they could do
more to help the environment if the law were scrapped and replaced
by a voluntary initiative aimed at environmental issues such as
water and energy conservation.
</P>
<P>
   Even the environmentalists who pushed for the chemical reporting
laws in the first place agree that companies such as Solutia are
much better environmental citizens than they were 15 years ago. But
they say that only proves the basic soundness of the existing laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some people who say, `Gee, corporate America is
wonderful, so why don't we just get rid of all these laws?' It's
like people saying the crime rate is down, so let's lay off some
cops,'' said James R. Gomes, president of the Environmental League
of Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Gomes said Massachusetts ought to reward companies with
the best environmental records by reducing their chemical reporting
requirements or cutting state fees. In exchange, the firms would
have to prove that they really were turning their attention to
other environmental problems.
</P>
<P>
   The debate over how much companies should tell the public occurs
amid a general trend toward more and wider disclosures about
hazardous chemicals. Since 1995, the Environmental Protection
Agency has doubled the number of chemicals whose release must be
reported in its Toxics Release Inventory, and required more
industries to join the program.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the EPA is considering following the Massachusetts
law by requiring firms to report not only pollution levels, but
also the chemicals they use as ingredients in their products.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the rise of the Internet has made these disclosures
more powerful, bringing detailed, easily analyzed information about
manufacturing plants into homes and offices around the world. The
Environmental Defense Fund has even created an Internet
``Scorecard'' (www.scorecard.org) where visitors punch in their zip
code to get detailed reports on every nearby toxic chemical source.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Chemical Manufacturers Association, trade group
for the industry most affected by all this reporting, say they
accept the public's right to know about potential health and safety
hazards. They have even set up their own Internet page
(www.chemicalguide.com) to provide both economic and health and
safety information about chemical companies.
</P>
<P>
   However, they argue that some information governments want is
either misleading or potentially dangerous. For instance, national
security agencies and members of Congress joined manufacturers in
opposing an EPA plan this year to post on the Internet descriptions
of ``worst case'' accidents at 36,000 facilities, and how the
owners would respond to them.
</P>
<P>
   Terrorists ``from Boston to Baghdad, from Los Angeles to Libya''
could learn how to kill the most people from the risk management
plans, complained US Rep. Tom Bliley, a Virginia Republican.
Congress passed a law in July blocking the Internet posting of the
risk management plans for at least a year.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists counter that the chemical industry is using
fear of terrorism to mask a broader agenda to limit access to
information about their operations. Only four years ago, activists
point out, chemical companies tried to greatly reduce the amount of
pollution information they must file with the EPA.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ninety percent of the people in the chemical industry's own
poll thought they should have a right to know about chemicals used
in their community,'' said Paul Orum, coordinator of the Working
Group on Community Right to Know.
</P>
<P>
   ``For that reason, the chemical industry has used secondary
issues such as the threat of terrorism'' to limit the information
flow, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Massachusetts' Toxic Use Reduction Act, chemical
industry officials say the release of information about chemicals
used in products gives people the idea that chemical use itself is
bad, rather than focusing on the actual exposure to people and
wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Solutia's Springfield plant was held up as the
second largest toxic chemical user in Massachusetts in literature
passed out by environmentalists at last week's hearing in Boston.
But there was no mention that the plant has dropped from first to
sixth in toxic releases to the environment, which industry
officials say is more meaningful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certain interest groups have focused on chemicals, and they
have decided that they are going to paint them as the evil of
society. That is absolutely false,'' said Michael DeVito of the
Massachusetts Chemical Technology Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Burns of the Massachusetts Public Interest Research Group,
which collected 11,000 signatures this year in defense of the state
reporting law, denies his group is anti-chemical. However, he said
the public needs to know the amount of toxic chemicals used at
manufacturers to understand the accident risk as well as the amount
of toxic material in the final products.
</P>
<P>
   And Burns dismissed industry grumbling about the law, saying
``they don't like anything that gives the public a potential
hammer'' over them.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Massachusetts law also faces criticism from some
academics who fear that if the EPA follows the Massachusetts
example in requiring companies to disclose chemical ingredients,
American companies will become more vulnerable to spying.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I know what chemicals you are using, I can figure out what
you're making and how much you're making,'' said William H. Lash, a
law professor at George Mason University in Virginia and an
authority on public disclosure issues.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, The Massachusetts law allows companies to withhold
trade secrets from the public _ and less than 2 percent of
manufacturers have even asked. But Lash said that only shows that
industry doesn't fully appreciate the risk. ``One thing about
espionage, unless you catch them,'' it's hard to tell when spying
has even happened, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, regulators, academics and environmentalists
alike say that the Toxic Use Reduction Act has been too successful
to toss out now. A study by University of Massachusetts at Lowell
officials found that the 1989 law's combination of education and
embarrassment helped industry cut toxic chemical waste by about 30
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that after ten years of proven success, the toxic
use reduction program should be emulated, not eliminated,'' wrote
Environmental Affairs Secretary Bob Durand to the legislature's
Joint Committee on Natural Resources and Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Durand's office is expected to produce a bill that
will streamline the reporting and planning requirements, especially
for companies with good records, but also put more focus on the
most dangerous chemicals as well as non-chemical issues such as
over all waste reduction.
</P>
<P>
   The message, say observers, is that industry deserves some
credit for improved environmental performance, but not all the
credit. Said Gomes of the Environmental League, ``It didn't happen
out of the goodness of the heart of corporate America but because
we put in place some significant laws and some significant
penalties.''

THE EDUCATION OF HENRY SMART 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GAIL CALDWELL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
A STAR CALLED HENRY 
Volume One of ``The Last Roundup'' 
By Roddy Doyle. Viking. 
342 pp. $24.95. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With his great dark wit sweeping the streets of Dublin for its
hard-earned truths, Roddy Doyle is renowned for his comic gifts _
he's emerged in recent years as one of the eminent straight men of
Ireland's literary renaissance. But Doyle is funny the way the
finest humorists dare to be, using comedy to make bearable the
grimmest of human realities. His laughs aren't satire and they're
never cheap; they're more like a howitzer aimed at the usual
suspects of poverty, greed, despair. If the unfortunate title of
``Paddy Clark Ha Ha Ha'' (which won the Booker Prize in 1993)
suggested something uproarious within, the name was only a wiseacre
front for a wrenching story _ a boy's life told in a gunmetal-tough
voice, his sense of humor the elixir vitae that keeps him alive.
</P>
<P>
   Doyle's fiction has gotten progressively bleaker with each work;
his most recent, ``The Woman Who Walked into Doors,'' delivered a
triumphant but agonizing soliloquy from a narrator whose husband
beat her nearly to death. Now comes the first volume of a projected
trilogy spanning the 20th century, with yet another splendidly
conceived voice in charge of the tale. Henry Smart is not just a
big, handsome lug who takes liberties with half the women he meets;
he's also cheeky enough to tell this story any damn way he pleases.
``I don't know any of this,'' he concedes in the middle of a
rhapsodic passage about his mother, and you realize his words are
an homage to the metaphoric reach of the imagination _ that the
story he's about to tell is either true or ought to be, whether or
not he was there to witness it. Our acceptance of Henry's deeply
interior voice is the narrative feat of ``A Star Called Henry,''
for the Dublin he delivers _ an underground world of sewer rats,
love stories, and political drama _ is a close-focus place so real
and seductive that only a fool or a genius could have invented it.
</P>
<P>
   Henry, of course, is a bit of both: a big, strapping boy born in
1901 to his birthright of the Dublin slums, his father a hit man
with a wooden leg, his mother a wreck of a woman who loses another
piece of her mind with each infant she buries. The children die
from consumption and cold and the crime of being hungry, and when
they die, she gives their name to the next baby born. She consoles
herself by believing that her dead ones turn into stars. ``God took
them all,'' remembers Henry. ``He needed them all up there to light
the night. He left her plenty, though. The ugly ones, the noisy
ones, the ones He didn't want _ the ones that would never stay
fed.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time he's 5, Henry has taken his little brother Victor
and headed for life on the streets, where they can find more to
eat. The first third of ``A Star Called Henry'' is devoted to this
childhood, if you can call it that, and it's ferociously powerful;
Doyle captures the desperation of the slums with the intimate
authenticity of a poet, not an anthropologist. A quick, robust boy
who stands out sheerly because of his health, Henry knocks on the
door of a schoolroom after a few years, telling the woman who
answers that he's come for his education. Miss O'Shea will take in
Henry and Victor until the nuns get wind of her subterfuge, but not
before she has taught Henry to read. It won't be the last time a
woman instructs him in the finer things of life, and Miss O'Shea
will always be his unforgettable first.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Star Called Henry'' is broken into discrete sections that
trace Henry's young life through Ireland's own tumultuous history;
poised at adolescence, he stands 6-foot-2 and is carrying a rifle
for Michael Collins. It's the morning of the Easter Uprising in
1916, and Henry has found a place in the republican army _ he's got
someone worth believing in, and a good fight to avenge the death of
Victor, who died in his arms from tuberculosis. From his father,
Henry has learned the cruel necessities of violence; from Collins
and the other heroes of the republic, he's learned about a
brotherhood that has a higher order in mind. And from a poor beauty
named Piano Annie, who shows him every kind of comfort, Henry gets
a political lesson that will come back to haunt him: that ``the
times never get better for the likes of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Given his physical mass and his do-or-die intelligence, Henry
finds work easily enough on the docks; the hiring stevedore's palm
is also greased by the likes of Piano Annie. Such connections are
all over the place in Henry's universe: favors and friendships and
sidelong winks, whether they show up as a job or a roll in the hay
or a casual murder on the banks of the River Liffey. This is
Doyle's Dublin _ he has read buckets of Irish history to get it
right, and used his imagination to give it life _ and the geography
of ``A Star Called Henry'' pulses with the same energy as its
unruly protagonist.
</P>
<P>
   Less convincing is the political atmosphere of the novel _ not
because it isn't authentic, but because it often pales in
comparison with Henry himself. This is a difficult area for anyone
but the most Tolstoian of novelists, for social structures and
ideological factions rarely lend themselves to the introspective
particularity of the creative mind. Doyle's brilliant abilities
with laconic dialogue and narrative voice are wasted when he
overloads his story with historic detail; it sings a far better
song through its individual tones _ through the wisdom of Piano
Annie, say, or the woman who will eventually be known as ``Our Lady
of the Machine Gun.'' The bloody history of Ireland has happened
one body at a time, and that is the story that Doyle tells best.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the danger that surrounds him and his own recklessly
wild ride, we know from Doyle's well-placed hints that Henry will
long outlast the thugs in pursuit of him, whether Britain's hired
killers or the republic's opportunistic turncoats. Besides, even
the Black and Tans are no match for a kid who carries around his
dead father's wooden leg to protect him, who knows how to disappear
in the watery underground tombs of Dublin's rivers. Henry may have
become, for a while, the very worst of his father, but he's also
managed to hang on to that vision of the stars _ his ma's painful
reach toward the only light in the sky, even while the earth wept
at her feet.

THE A-LIST AVOIDS TYPECASTING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The faces are the same. But the roles are a little different
this season. Not for years, in fact, has Hollywood's A-list made
such a collective effort to break away from typecasting as in
movies opening between now and Christmas. How will they get away
from playing the usual suspects? Try Kevin Spacey unraveling in a
suburb with a Stepford Wife played by Annette Bening in ``American
Beauty.'' How about Matt Damon as a bad guy in ``The Talented Mr.
Ripley''? Jodie Foster wising up royalty in Siam sans Rodgers and
Hammerstein in ``Anna and the King''? Robert De Niro stepping
outside gangland to play a security guard guided by a gay neighbor
through the aftermath of a stroke in ``Flawless''? Angelina Jolie
as a cop in ``The Bone Collector''? Tom Hanks as a prison guard in
``The Green Mile''? And Johnny Depp trying to keep his head on
straight in ``Sleepy Hollow''?
</P>
<P>
   One thing has stayed the same. Of the more than 150 movies
jostling one another, a lot of the high-visibility entries come
from novels. Memoirs, too. ``Angela's Ashes,'' Frank O'Connor's
wrenching recollection of growing up poor, is due with Emily Watson
and Robert Carlyle as the
</P>
<P>
   struggling Irish family's mother and father, respectively; she
hammered into depression by his drinking. ``Girl, Interrupted,''
Susanna Kaysen's story of her institutionalization, is due with
Winona Ryder and Jolie. The latter will be very much in evidence
this fall as she plays a cop who is the eyes and ears of Denzel
Washington's paralyzed forensics expert tracking a grisly serial
killer in ``The Bone Collector.''
</P>
<P>
   It'll be a double-header for Washington, too. He'll also star in
``Hurricane,'' about middleweight boxing champ Rubin ``Hurricane''
Carter, fighting to clear himself from a triple murder charge. Brad
Pitt and Edward Norton will put the gloves on in ``The Fight
Club,'' a bashfest directed by ``Seven'' helmer David Fincher. Not
that all the sparring will take place in the ring. Susan Sarandon
and Natalie Portman will slug it out, mother-daughter-wise, in the
film of Mona Simpson's novel ``Anywhere But Here.'' The trouble
faced by Michelle Pfeiffer and Bruce Willis in ``The Story of Us''
is that they no longer get a kick out of each other. The romantic
twist in ``Random Hearts'': Harrison Ford and Kristin Scott Thomas
play characters whose respective deceased spouses were having an
affair. The interplay is more complicated in ``Hanging Up,'' Nora
Ephron's new movie, based on her sister Delia's partly
autobiographical novel about sisters _ Diane Keaton, Meg Ryan, Lisa
Kudrow _ reprioritizing when their father (Walter Matthau) is ill.
</P>
<P>
   Other high-profile items from the realm of fiction include
``Snow Falling on Cedars,'' starring Ethan Hawke in a series of
interlocking mysteries involving an American man and a Japanese
woman. John Irving wrote his own screenplay for ``The Cider House
Rules,'' starring Tobey Maguire in a rites-of-passage odyssey.
Kevin Costner is on the mound in Mark Shaara's ``For Love of the
Game,'' about a flawed Detroit Tigers pitching ace working on a
perfect game against the Yankees. Leonardo Di Caprio discovers a
few cracks in a seeming paradise in ``The Beach,'' filmed in
Thailand and based on the novel of the same name by Alex Garland.
Julianne Moore and Ralph Fiennes plunge into Graham Greene's
semiautobiographical novel ``The End of the Affair.'' And you do
remember that ``Sleepy Hollow,'' in which Tim Burton will send the
Headless Horseman after Depp, is based on a novel by that old hit
maker, Washington Irving.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Darabont, who masterminded ``The Shawshank Redemption,''
went behind bars again for another Stephen King novel, ``The Green
Mile,'' starring Hanks as a Death Row guard in a Depression-era
Southern prison. Martin Scorsese will crank it up with Nicolas Cage
in ``Bringing Out the Dead,'' about New York paramedics fighting to
keep the death rate down during an intense weekend. Al Pacino and
Russell Crowe fight big tobacco in ``The Insider,'' based on fired
cigarette company executive and whistle-blower Jeffrey Wigand's
story. Keeping Damon's charming sociopath company in ``The Talented
Mr. Ripley'' will be Gwyneth Paltrow, Jude Law, and Cate Blanchett.
Perennial fave ``Stuart Little'' will return in a live-action
version starring Geena Davis and a computer graphics imaging
title-roleist.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of Damon, he and longtime pal Ben Affleck will finally
turn up in ``Dogma,'' Kevin Smith's contemporary retelling of
Christ's appearance on earth. Affleck, meanwhile, will headline one
of the season's high-impact action entries, ``Reindeer Games,''
playing a hard-luck ex-con roped in to a casino heist. ``Three
Kings,'' starring the larcenous trio of George Clooney, Mark
Wahlberg, and Ice Cube, could have been called Operation Desert
Heist, concerning, as it does, a theft of gold bullion at the end
of the Gulf War. Pierce Brosnan will reprise James Bond in ``The
World Is Not Enough,'' protecting a murdered oil biggie's daughter
from mad bomber Robert Carlyle. In ``End of Days,'' Arnold
Schwarzenegger is back, taking on the devil, no less, a role
assigned to Gabriel Byrne. And no list of guy flicks could fail to
include Oliver Stone's football saga, ``Any Given Sunday,'' in
which Cameron Diaz, Jamie Foxx, Dennis Quaid, and Al Pacino compete
to call the signals.
</P>
<P>
   There'll also be a double dose of Robin Williams, first in
``Jakob the Liar,'' playing a beleaguered Jew keeping spirits up in
the ghetto, then in ``Bicentennial Man,'' as a robot who turns
human and falls in love. Billy Bob Thornton returns to his native
Arkansas for ``Daddy and Them,'' his directorial follow-up to
``Sling Blade.'' Laura Dern, Thornton's real-life significant other
and costar in the film, describes it as white trash comedy.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``Boogie Nights'' filmmaker Paul Thomas Anderson's follow-up
focusing on San Fernando Valley types, ``Magnolia,'' generated buzz
enough for Tom Cruise to phone and offer an uncredited cameo. (The
offer was accepted.) The biopic-deprived will note that Jim Carrey
will check in as comic Andy Kaufman in ``Man on the Moon,'' and
Milla Jovovich will be the latest actress to play the sainted
``Joan of Arc.'' And, oh yes. Look for ``Toy Story 2'' and ``Scream
3.'' But who's counting?

MEATY ROLES DON'T GO TO WOMEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I love the reviews Alec Baldwin has been getting for his role in
``Outside Providence.'' Who cares if he's ``a little chunky in the
midsection,'' or if he ``bears more than passing resemblance to the
Michelin man''?
</P>
<P>
   Nobody cares, because when Baldwin packs on the pounds and plays
against his usual leading man type he's a brilliant actor turning
in what one critic described as ``an Academy Award-worthy
appearance . . . stripped down to his boxer shorts, and sporting a
patch of graying stubble, a beer belly and a permanent sneer of
boozy contempt on his jowly face.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course even with a beer belly and stubbly jowls Alec Baldwin
still looks pretty good. But that's beside the point, which is that
when a male movie star gains weight it's a career-extending move.
But when a female movie star gains weight it's a career-ending
mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Can you imagine Baldwin's wife, Kim Basinger, gaining 100 pounds
for ``The Kate Smith Story''? Can you even imagine her on screen
looking ``a little chunky in the midsection''? I don't think so.
</P>
<P>
   Pregnancy is the only circumstance in which a female star is
permitted to put on pounds, and she can't put on too many. If she
knows what's good for her she'd better be back in trim 20 minutes
after she delivers or she can kiss her career goodbye.
</P>
<P>
   Robert De Niro was a genius when he porked up to play
out-of-shape boxer Jake LaMotta in ``Raging Bull.'' Isn't it
amazing how far he's willing to go to for a role?
</P>
<P>
   Erstwhile pretty boy John Travolta resurrected his career when
he cultivated a double chin and starred in ``Pulp Fiction.'' Who
knew he was a brilliant character actor?
</P>
<P>
   Even Sylvester Stallone's career was enhanced by the fat factor.
He let himself go for ``Cop Land'' and proved he's not just a human
action-figure.
</P>
<P>
   I'm trying to think of a female movie star who enhanced her
career by gaining weight. Are there any? When female stars expand,
their careers contract. They disappear. They go into hiding so they
won't end up with their photo in The National Enquirer with a
caption in which the word ``former'' figures prominently.
</P>
<P>
   We look to Hollywood for something to divert us from our own
lives and what do we see? Often we see older actors, some of them
``chunky in the middle,'' paired with much, much younger actresses
who look as though they might vanish if they turned sideways. Whose
fantasy is this?
</P>
<P>
   In Hollywood men can go on indefinitely. A woman's career is
over when she's 30. Or it's over when she looks 30, which may not
be until she's 40-ish. If she looks over 30 and overweight, she
might as well hit the dinner theater circuit. And they may not want
her there, either.
</P>
<P>
   The double standard about weight isn't confined to the
entertainment business. I remember an Esquire magazine article that
explained what separates someone who is fat from someone who is
``attractively corpulent.'' It boiled down to this: women are fat;
men are attractively corpulent. Some men, at least, are
attractively corpulent. Others are merely fat, because fat isn't
just a sex issue, but a class issue too, for men anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Fat women, no matter how successful they may be, are fat. Men
who are powerful, wealthy, brilliant, or famous can be attractively
corpulent. Thus the character Baldwin plays in ``Outside
Providence'' is fat, but Baldwin the movie star is attractively
corpulent. Actually, he may be just attractive. I read that he's
been dieting.

   Stretching is an important preliminary to any sporting routine.
Now, television is giving fans three hours of warm-up exercises for
what can be a 10-hour day of viewing NFL games.
</P>
<P>
   From 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. (the time when most Sunday games kick
off), five national networks will produce NFL pregame shows. Fox
Sports Net joins the congestion this season with the ``NFL This
Morning.'' CBS, whose ``NFL Today'' trailed Fox's ``NFL Sunday'' by
37 percent in the ratings last season, overhauled its lineup. CNN,
which airs ``NFL Preview'' uncontested in the 10-11 a.m. slot, and
ESPN, whose ``NFL Countdown'' is the only two-hour presentation in
the bunch, have tweaked their shows.

   That competition explains part of CBS' thinking in revamping its
``NFL Today'' team. Back in the NFL business last year after a
four-year absence, CBS placed veteran host Jim Nantz in the studio
with George Seifert, Brent Jones and Marcus Allen. All were light
on TV experience. Seifert left before the season ended and now
coaches the Carolina Panthers. Jones was moved to game analysis.
Allen remains in the studio but now will be joined by James,
veteran analyst Randy Cross and former Fox game analyst and NFL
coach Jerry Glanville.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't create chemistry,'' Cross said. ``There's absolutely
no way. You want this sizzling, popping, wonderful, sparkling
little thing, but you can't create it. You just put it together and
hope it works that way.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very uncomfortable comparing last year to this year,''
Nantz said. ``I'm back. I feel very loyal to the people I've worked
with. Our team last year was put in a tough situation. First year
back into pro football. First year as a television broadcaster. I
know the show really improved as the season went on.''

   Fox had the most-watched pregame show last year, generating an
average Nielsen rating of 3.7 (one rating point represents
approximately 9.42 million U.S. homes). CBS finished at 2.7, while
ESPN had a 2.2 cable rating and CNN 0.6. The network that covers
the NFC, which has teams in eight of the top 10 TV markets, has
virtually always had better pregame ratings than the AFC
rights-holders. Fans who follow a particular team generally watch
that network's pregame show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people think since the game's on that network, they will
do more on my game,'' said ESPN's Rauscher. ``Other people think,
`I don't want to miss anything,' so they put on that station when
they first get up and just leave it on so they won't miss
kickoff.''
</P>
<P>
   CBS enjoyed that ratings edge before 1994 _ when Fox took away
the NFC package _ and now fights an uphill climb as the AFC
network. ``Ratings-wise, there is an advantage to having the NFC
markets,'' said Eric Mann, coordinating producer for the CBS show.
``In the production of the show, hopefully you're on an even
keel.''
</P>
<P>
   Cross, a three-time All-Pro in a 13-year career with the San
Francisco 49ers, said the pregame shows have a built-in audience:
current players. ``I know players watch them,'' Cross said. ``There
are a lot of people who want to know either what's going to happen
or why it's going to happen. The only real resource you have is the
pregame look. I played on the West Coast, so at 9 o'clock the
pregame shows were on.''
</P>
<P>
   Former players say they work hard to make sure they're as
prepared for a Sunday in the broadcast booth as they were on the
field. The quest for credibility drives many of these pregame
performers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys like Chris Mortensen,'' James said, referring to an ESPN
reporter who did not play in the NFL, ``I know when Chris says
something, he's not just pulling it out. I know Mort's out there
doing his homework. That's why it's so important for me to work
hard. I don't want anybody to say, `This guy's out there throwing
mud against the wall.' I've worked hard to get to the position I'm
at. I want to keep it, so I've got to double up my efforts more.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things I missed about coaching was the
competition,'' said retired Buffalo Bills coach Marv Levy, who will
be part of the Fox Sports Net show. ``If there are a lot of shows
out there, it's good for the game, just as a lot of teams are good
for the game. I'm going to welcome the competition. I hope our show
is something people say is something special, just like they say
the Denver Broncos are something special.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- The working-mother decor in Dr. JoAnn Manson's office
_ brightly-colored crayon drawings of dinosaurs and solar systems _
gives little hint to the volume, or the magnitude, of the work that
comes out of it.
</P>
<P>
   A big chunk of the health advice Americans now follow to lower
their risk of heart disease _ from taking antioxidant vitamins or
postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy, to an aspirin a day, to
the much lauded brisk walk _ come from studies that Manson has
either headed or collaborated on.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Manson, 46, was named chief of preventive medicine at
Brigham and Women's Hospital. The appointment ended months of
speculation about who would fill the position left by Dr. Charles
Hennekens, who severed both his Brigham and Harvard ties when he
resigned from the institutions last March amid allegations he
sexually harassed co-workers.
</P>
<P>
   In July, Manson was promoted to full professor at Harvard
Medical School, where only 9 percent of professorships are held by
women.
</P>
<P>
   Manson, who heads seven grants totaling more than $20 million,
is best known for her work on the Women's Health Initiative and the
Nurses' Health Study, which has established, among other things,
that fiber prevents heart attacks in women, and that adult-onset
diabetes can be largely prevented through weight control, diet and
exercise.
</P>
<P>
   The Nurses' study and the others are among the largest
``observational'' investigations in the world. Data from these
studies are culled from detailed questionnaires filled out by tens
of thousands of volunteers over many years and sometimes decades.
</P>
<P>
   Although Manson spends a good part of her life poring through
data, to her patients, she does not resemble the methodical
scientist that she is.
</P>
<P>
   Anna Andrews, 74, of Peabody, says that when Manson walks into
the office, she immediately becomes a friend. ``I have a white coat
syndrome. My heart beats harder just at the sight of it, but the
first thing she does is give you a big smile, and says `let's
talk,''' said Andrews, who diligently clips out every newspaper
article that mentions Manson's name and keeps them in a manila
folder. ``She's never rushed me.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, in the last few weeks, Manson, a board-certified
internist and endocrinologist with a 400-patient medical practice,
has managed to add even more papers to the 300 or so she's
published, including the August 26 report from the Nurses' Health
Study in the New England Journal of Medicine that brisk walking, at
least three hours per week, is as effective as vigorous exercise in
reducing the risk of heart attacks in women.
</P>
<P>
   Manson is convinced that low-tech approaches to disease
prevention, such as exercise, have as much to offer as high-tech
innovations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Heredity is not destiny when it comes to risk for most chronic
diseases. The role that lifestyle factors play in heart disease,
stroke, diabetes and many forms of cancer is truly astounding,''
says Manson, who spends a large percentage of her time treating
people with diabetes, a disease that has interested her since her
cousin developed it at 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite all the major technological advances in medicine,
there is probably nothing you can do that will improve your health
more than being physically active,'' says Manson. Ever the
public-health missionary, Manson would like to see her example made
easier to follow in the community. ``People are more likely to bike
or walk if they have convenient paths. We need more parks with good
lighting and police protection, where it's just safe to be walking
around,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Manson is also a firm believer in following one's own advice:
she and her husband make sure that they and their two children
spend at least an hour each Saturday and Sunday hiking or biking.
</P>
<P>
   Physicians should also be more proactive in advocating
life-style practices that have been very clearly linked to reducing
disease-risk, says Manson, who believes the key to getting patients
off the couch is to recommend something they like to do. .
</P>
<P>
   And, she's as ready to take up the prescription pad to outline
an exercise regimen as to specify a medication. A few weeks ago,
she penned a prescription for Virginia McElroy, 74, of Georgetown
that read: ``Gradually increase walking. Begin 5 minutes per day
for 3-4 days. Then 10 minutes a day for 3-4 days, and then 15
minutes a day. Gradually increase to 15 minutes two times a day, as
tolerated.''
</P>
<P>
   McElroy, who has seen Manson every three months for at least 13
years, keeps the prescription on a table next to her ``TV chair,''
a swivel rocker, and has been spending less time in the rocker as a
result.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it wasn't written down, it would go out of my mind _
fast,'' said McElroy, who now takes daily walks around her
neighborhood as prescribed.
</P>
<P>
   Manson says that she has been better able to empathize with her
patients since she endured a few medical crises of her own. Five
years ago, she was diagnosed with melanoma and was successfully
treated. She also had gestational diabetes requiring insulin
injections and three hospitalizations for kidney stones.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard epidemiologist Julie Buring, who is the principal
investigator of the Women's Health Study and a long-time colleague
of Manson's, says the bouts with illness underscore how exceptional
Manson is. ``She's been going the same speed she always has, even
while battling health problems,'' Buring says.
</P>
<P>
   Manson, who grew up in northern Ohio, says she knew early on
that she wanted to go into medicine. Already influenced by her
mother, a medical social worker, and father, a NASA engineer, she
was encouraged by her high school chemistry teacher to pursue her
interest in science. Yet her classmates, she says, thought of her
more as an artsy type, since she painted, sculpted and played the
harp.
</P>
<P>
   She went on to do pre-med at Harvard, where she was a dance and
theater reviewer for the Harvard Independent, and where she met her
husband Christopher Ames, now a lawyer. The artwork that decorates
her office walls were done by their children, Jenn, 12, and
Jeffrey, 10.
</P>
<P>
   Friends have learned that if they want to invite the couple
over, Manson probably won't be calling a babysitter. ``They are
really magical children. It is absolutely our top priority in life
to be with the kids,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from Case Western Reserve University School of
Medicine in Cleveland, Manson chose endocrinology, the study of
hormones, as her internal medicine subspecialty and returned to
Boston for her internship and residency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Endocrinology interfaces with almost every other medical
discipline and health condition...which is intellectually
stimulating,'' Manson explains. The field is also rewarding from a
clinical standpoint, she says, because it can enable doctors to
treat and reverse health problems rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1979, Manson's focus began to shift from clinical
practice to women's health and preventive medicine. During Manson's
first week of internship that year, her mother was diagnosed with
ovarian cancer and died several months later. After her residency,
Manson enrolled in an epidemiology and biostatistics program at the
Harvard School of Public Health, receiving a doctorate in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Manson is known nationally for her work in the prevention
of cardiovascular disease and diabetes. ``She has done a very
impressive amount of work in a short period of time,'' said Ross
Prentice, senior vice president of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer
Research Center in Seattle, which is the coordinating center for
the Women's Health Initiative, the largest women's health study to
date. Manson heads up the study's Brigham site.
</P>
<P>
   Younger colleagues describe Manson as a strong role model and
nurturer of their careers. Janet Rich-Edwards, an instructor at
Harvard Medical School's department of ambulatory care and
prevention, points to Manson's ability to work with a multitude of
different _ and often difficult _ personalities.
</P>
<P>
   Like Rich-Edwards, Dr. Simin Liu describes Manson as one of the
senior faculty who treats junior colleagues with respect. Liu says
that Manson was always one of the first to get back to him with
comments on his dissertation, which, he adds, ``is unusual for
someone with her seniority.''

WHO'S AFRAID OF THE BAPTISTS? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If any Baptists are praying for me this week, I should like to
express my heartfelt thanks.
</P>
<P>
   On the Jewish calendar, these are the Days of Awe, the most
solemn 10 days of the Jewish year. They began last Friday night
with Rosh Hashana, the Jewish New Year, and they will end next
Monday with Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement. So strong is the pull
of these Days of Awe and their intense focus on repentance and
forgiveness, that they draw even lapsed or secular Jews to the
synagogue.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a few days before Rosh Hashana, the International
Mission Board of the Southern Baptists issued a prayer guide urging
church members to pray for the conversion of the Jews. ``Pray for
the Messiah to reveal Himself in miraculous ways to the `lost sheep
of the house of Israel,' '' it urges. ``Pray each day for Jewish
individuals you know by name. . . . Build authentic friendships
with Jewish people. Love them as you would an unsaved relative.''
</P>
<P>
   There is not a harsh or bigoted word anywhere in the booklet. It
contains reflections on Jewish customs during the Days of Awe, and
suggests specific points on which Baptists can focus while praying.
(``Pray that Jews will rediscover the uniqueness of who they are in
history.'' ``Pray that Jewish people would be free of the strong
influence of materialism in the lands where they live.'') And it
calls attention to the condition of Jews around the world. (``As
Jewish families in Argentina suffer economic crises, pray that
Christians will respond in ways that do not provoke shame.'' ``Pray
that God will protect the rights of Jews in the Ukraine and
Belarus.'')
</P>
<P>
   Southern Baptist interest in converting Jews is not a new
phenomenon. In 1996, the denomination's annual convention adopted a
resolution to ``direct our energies and resources toward the
proclamation of the Gospel to the Jews.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a widely held article of Christian faith that no one can
be spiritually saved except through Jesus, and that Christians are
bound to spread this good news (``gospel'') to those who haven't
accepted it. Judaism teaches differently. No intermediary can
deliver God's grace and forgiveness, Jews believe; one must earn
His favor directly, through prayer, repentance, and charity.
Observant Jews daily recite the 145th Psalm, which offers the
assurance that ``the Lord is near to all who call on Him, to all
who call on Him with sincerity.''
</P>
<P>
   As a Jew, I cannot share the Baptists' belief in Jesus. But I
can certainly acknowledge that by their lights they are offering
the Jewish people something incalculably precious: eternal
salvation. My religion does not require me to go out and
proselytize (indeed it discourages it). But I have no trouble
respecting the dedication of a Southern Baptist whose religion does
require it of him.
</P>
<P>
   To listen to some prominent Jews, however, you'd think the
Baptists were calling for a pogrom.
</P>
<P>
   ``We find this offensive,'' snaps Mark Briskman of the
Anti-Defamation League. ``It shows an element of arrogance because
they are specifically targeting Jews during this holy season.''
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Eric Yoffie of the Union of American Hebrew Congregations,
an organ of Reform (nontraditional) Judaism, accuses Southern
Baptists of ``an absence of awareness that these sorts of
statements throughout history are associated with coercion, hatred,
and violence.'' Three years ago, after the Southern Baptists
adopted their resolution on conversion, Rabbi Leon Klenicki of the
ADL was even more explicit: ``Especially after the Holocaust,
Christians have no right to talk about a mission to the Jews.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubbish. Worse than rubbish. The 250 years that Jews have lived
amid American Christians have been an era of peace and prosperity
virtually without parallel in Jewish history. To link the Southern
Baptists to European anti-Semitism _ never mind to Hitler _ is
utterly indecent.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible, of course, that some evangelicals will succeed
in luring Jews to Christianity. Some already have; so-called
``messianic Jews'' are converts who were attracted by the promise
that accepting Jesus would make them ``more fulfilled'' Jews.
Judaism doesn't work that way, but successful Christian
missionaries tend to focus their efforts on Jews who never learned
very much about how Judaism does work. That is scandalous _ no, not
the conversion, but the ignorance that made the conversion
possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would that Jewish leaders worried as much about the souls of
confused young Jews as much as the evangelicals do,'' says Binyamin
Jolkovsky, whose lively Internet magazine, JewishWorldReview.com,
actively reaches out to Christians. ``If every Jewish child had a
solid Jewish education, nobody would be worrying about the Southern
Baptists.''
</P>
<P>
   No Christians will offend me by praying that I find my way to
their Lord during the Days of Awe. It may surprise them to learn
that I _ and countless other Jews _ annually return the favor. The
traditional Rosh Hashana liturgy several times implores, ``Our God
and the God of our fathers, rule the whole world in Your glory . .
. and let everyone who breathes proclaim: `The Lord, God of Israel,
is king, and His majesty reigns over everything.' ''
</P>
<P>
   So let us all pray for each other's spiritual enlightenment. And
may each of us, and all who seek the well-being of others, be
inscribed in the Book of Life for the year ahead.
</P>

NETWORKS VIE TO GET MORE YARDAGE OUT OF PRO FOOTBALL 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Stretching is an important preliminary to any sporting routine.
Now, television is giving fans three hours of warm-up exercises for
what can be a 10-hour day of viewing NFL games.
</P>
<P>
   From 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. (the time when most Sunday games kick
off), five national networks will produce NFL pregame shows. Fox
Sports Net joins the congestion this season with the ``NFL This
Morning.'' CBS, whose ``NFL Today'' trailed Fox's ``NFL Sunday'' by
37 percent in the ratings last season, overhauled its lineup. CNN,
which airs ``NFL Preview'' uncontested in the 10-11 a.m. slot, and
ESPN, whose ``NFL Countdown'' is the only two-hour presentation in
the bunch, have tweaked their shows.
</P>
<P>
   It is all part of a frenzy spurred in part by NFL fans _ many of
whom are mindful of their fantasy-league players _ and their thirst
for information.
</P>
<P>
   A viewer trying to catch all of this could be weary before the
games even begin. ``People watch them, which is why they produce
them,'' CBS Sports president Sean McManus said. ``If they weren't
being watched, if the advertising revenue wasn't significant, they
wouldn't be produced.''
</P>
<P>
   So how much is too much? ESPN asked that question 20 years ago
when it created the first all-sports network, and it still hasn't
found the answer. The NFL keeps expanding its menu to see how much
its viewers can take.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the day of the game, I don't know that there is a
saturation point,'' said Chris Myers, who will anchor Fox Sports
Net's new show. ``The true football fan, that's why they go
tailgate a couple of hours before the game. They just want to be
around football and talking about it. On Sunday morning, when
people wake up, that's what they want. I think there will be a
24-hour NFL channel in our future somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   The infusion of pregame programming invites problems into the
mix. Each show wants to be different, but how many directions can
they all go? Fox emphasizes entertainment. ESPN specializes in news
and information. CBS, which replaced three rookie studio analysts
with TV-savvy veterans, is looking for a mix. CNN, which had the
lowest-rated of the four shows last year, and Fox Sports Net are
hoping not to get lost in the masses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gets back to the old CBS `NFL Today,''' said Fox executive
producer Ed Goren, who produced that CBS show before moving to his
Fox in 1994. ``We said if we only had a hour show, wouldn't life be
wonderful from a producer's point of view. Then we started an hour
show here five years ago, and there isn't a week that goes by where
we're not saying wouldn't it be great to have an hour and a half.''
</P>
<P>
   Affiliate problems prevented Fox from expanding ``NFL Sunday,''
so the network's cable arm became the newest player in the game.
``We feel like we can do the best show out there,'' Fox Sports Net
executive producer Arthur Smith said. ``That was our motivation for
doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   ESPN became the first to go with an hour show back in 1986, when
CBS and NBC, which no longer is involved in the NFL, had half-hour
pregames. When the over-the-air networks went to an hour, ESPN
expanded to 75 minutes, then to 90, and last year to its current
two hours.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas it once had the 11 a.m.-noon hour to itself, ESPN now
competes with Fox Sports Net's show. ESPN, which added Stuart Scott
and Suzy Kolber to its cauldron of on-air personnel this year, has
always had the problem of trying to hold its early viewers once the
CBS and Fox shows come on the air at noon. Should the network run
its best stuff in the first hour or save it for a better
competitive posture against the two big networks?
</P>
<P>
   ``In a different week you'll juggle differently,'' said Bob
Rauscher, senior coordinating producer for ESPN. ``It could be a
little different this year with Fox Sports Net having a show.
You'll have to be a little more aware of the competition than you
were before.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't just start off and say we'll put our (weaker) stuff
in the first hour and we'll save all the good stuff. People might
just say this show's not that good. On the other hand, you can't
use all your stuff early, because then the other shows come on and
they might have a better presentation. It's a fine balance. You
hope to get good material overall.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not always possible in the current environment. Imagine a
week in which four networks arrive at, for instance, Miami Dolphins
practice, looking to do a feature on Dan Marino. If you've seen one
version, is it as good as seeing them all?
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to show these players in a personal light,'' said Bill
Galvin, executive producer for CNN, which added former University
of Nebraska linebacker Trev Alberts to its team. ``We try to show
them away from the field, without the helmets, without the pads.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You hope that your relationship makes it a personable
interview in that case,'' said Craig James, a CBS studio analyst
and former NFL running back. ``If I'm doing it or (Fox's) James
Brown is doing it or one of the ESPN guys is doing it, they're
going to answer us all nicely. What I'm going to do is then talk to
a lot of players and maybe get support for what I'm doing. You've
got to work that little bit more because it's very competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   The competition will be as intense as ever. Each network has its
``information men,'' reporters who are responsible for breaking
stories before they become public. ``It has become pretty much a
ruthless, cut-throat, dog-eat-dog business,'' said Peter King, an
``NFL Preview'' reporter. ``The hardest thing is to find something
out at Friday at 4 o'clock and have nobody find out by Sunday
morning at 10. It's virtually impossible anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, the competition is stronger than it's ever been, and
all of us who are in the information business right now look at it
and say that if we don't bring our `A' games to the table every
week, we're going to get slaughtered.''

REP. KING'S CAUTIONARY TALE ABOUT IRELAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Maine man went back into action last week in an effort to
revive the dangerously frayed peace process in Northern Ireland.
Former Senator George Mitchell, whose good will and common sense
was the foundation for last year's Good Friday agreement, is now
laboring to jump-start the agreement's implementation.
</P>
<P>
   But as Mitchell began a private exercise in crisis diplomacy,
Boston College was playing host to another figure of serious repute
in Ireland whose latest contribution to the situation has been the
publication of a novel.
</P>
<P>
   Peter King, a conservative Republican congressman from Long
Island, is as major a player in Irish affairs as you can find on
Capitol Hill. And he has been a voice for justice and not merely
nonviolence as a route out of The Troubles. This latest
manifestation of his passion has oddly impeccable timing.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell is the perfect American manifestation of the insistence
that reason must find the way to begin implementing a power-sharing
government in the North that is free of direct rule from London.
But King is the perfect American manifestation of the reason people
of all backgrounds should care about this mess. He reminds us why
it is a mess _ because of injustice.
</P>
<P>
   King wrote ``Terrible Beauty'' (the title is a Yeats line from
``Easter, 1916'') in draft form several years ago, when nearly all
the news was bad, but when its portrayal of the injustice and
oppression suffered by the Catholic minority in the North would
have inevitably been seen as partisan.
</P>
<P>
   Coming out now, the novel is meant to serve an instructive
purpose, as a cautionary tale of what going backwards would mean.
``There's a danger of a return to violence and suffering that is
always just beneath the surface,'' King said. ``It wouldn't take
that much to set it off, despite the fact most people want peace to
work. We need to understand how dangerous these forces are and how
easily they can spiral out of control again.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Terrible Beauty'' is no congressional drivel-novel. It has
awkward moments when you can sense the hand of someone who has read
an appropriations bill, but for the nonexpert reader, it is a
riveting portrait of Belfast life in the early 1980s _ hunger
strikes, internment without trial, Margaret Thatcher at her worst,
trials that mock Anglo-American principles, hideous violence among
paramilitary organizations that catch civilians in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   His heroine, Bernadette Hanlon, is a housewife who labors to
stay away from the tension and violence for the sake of her kids'
future, but who is drawn relentlessly into it by the injustice at
its core. She has already lost a brother who is blown up by the
bomb he was making for the Irish Republican Army. But her attempt
at life begins to unravel when her husband, Dermot, is rounded up
for IRA activities and than faces trumped-up charges of murder. It
is a story right out of the dirty pages of all-to-recent history.
</P>
<P>
   Here she is describing the ``justice'' system her husband faces:
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, for one thing, he's not allowed to have a jury. He'll be
tried before a judge who in most cases is either a former unionist
politician or a British army officer . . . In my husband's case,
the only evidence against him will be the statement of an admitted
perjurer and criminal. There's no corroboration whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what it was like. King was a regular visitor to the North
during the 1980s _ at the time of the hunger strikes by IRA
convicts, when he served on an international panel examining the
use of plastic bullets for ``crowd control'' by the police and
British forces. One of the novel's gut-wrneching scenes is of the
casual shooting of the daugher of Bernadette's neighbor, her head
shattered by one of those humane-sounding bullets.
</P>
<P>
   King's novel foreshadows the more arid report last week by a
British commission that the Royal Ulster Constabulary be stripped
of its unionist name and colors, reconstituted with a far more
Catholic presence than its currently 92 percent Protestant makeup,
and supervised by a panel from the new government of the North,
which by the numbers would include people from Sinn Fein, the
political wing of the IRA.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, the leader of the Ulster Unionists, David Trimble,
complained, but his complaint once again is over having to actually
go through with power-sharing, which means ending the overt
discrimination that led to The Troubles in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Compromises and good-faith gestures on all sides are required
now, and Mitchell's job is to help all the parties step up. But
that cannot obscure the fact that an evil system must be
dismantled.
</P>
<P>
   King is the son of a New York cop, whose grandparents came here
from Galway and Limerick early this century. A product of the
Sunnyside section of Queens, he followed so many out of the city,
onto Long Island and into the Republican Party. He's also the other
kind of Republican, a passionate believer in a united Ireland, but
one who has used his influence to shove other believers toward
peace, power-sharing, and faith in the ballot box.
</P>
<P>
   His novel has a bittersweet ending _ a legal vindication and two
more hideous murders. It doesn't have to be that way again, but
``Terrible Beauty'' is a study in how easily it can happen.

   That competition explains part of CBS' thinking in revamping its
``NFL Today'' team. Back in the NFL business last year after a
four-year absence, CBS placed veteran host Jim Nantz in the studio
with George Seifert, Brent Jones and Marcus Allen. All were light
on TV experience. Seifert left before the season ended and now
coaches the Carolina Panthers. Jones was moved to game analysis.
Allen remains in the studio but now will be joined by James,
veteran analyst Randy Cross and former Fox game analyst and NFL
coach Jerry Glanville.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't create chemistry,'' Cross said. ``There's absolutely
no way. You want this sizzling, popping, wonderful, sparkling
little thing, but you can't create it. You just put it together and
hope it works that way.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very uncomfortable comparing last year to this year,''
Nantz said. ``I'm back. I feel very loyal to the people I've worked
with. Our team last year was put in a tough situation. First year
back into pro football. First year as a television broadcaster. I
know the show really improved as the season went on.''
</P>

<P>
   Fox had the most-watched pregame show last year, generating an
average Nielsen rating of 3.7 (one rating point represents
approximately 9.42 million U.S. homes). CBS finished at 2.7, while
ESPN had a 2.2 cable rating and CNN 0.6. The network that covers
the NFC, which has teams in eight of the top 10 TV markets, has
virtually always had better pregame ratings than the AFC
rights-holders. Fans who follow a particular team generally watch
that network's pregame show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people think since the game's on that network, they will
do more on my game,'' said ESPN's Rauscher. ``Other people think,
`I don't want to miss anything,' so they put on that station when
they first get up and just leave it on so they won't miss
kickoff.''
</P>
<P>
   CBS enjoyed that ratings edge before 1994 _ when Fox took away
the NFC package _ and now fights an uphill climb as the AFC
network. ``Ratings-wise, there is an advantage to having the NFC
markets,'' said Eric Mann, coordinating producer for the CBS show.
``In the production of the show, hopefully you're on an even
keel.''
</P>
<P>
   Cross, a three-time All-Pro in a 13-year career with the San
Francisco 49ers, said the pregame shows have a built-in audience:
current players. ``I know players watch them,'' Cross said. ``There
are a lot of people who want to know either what's going to happen
or why it's going to happen. The only real resource you have is the
pregame look. I played on the West Coast, so at 9 o'clock the
pregame shows were on.''
</P>
<P>
   Former players say they work hard to make sure they're as
prepared for a Sunday in the broadcast booth as they were on the
field. The quest for credibility drives many of these pregame
performers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys like Chris Mortensen,'' James said, referring to an ESPN
reporter who did not play in the NFL, ``I know when Chris says
something, he's not just pulling it out. I know Mort's out there
doing his homework. That's why it's so important for me to work
hard. I don't want anybody to say, `This guy's out there throwing
mud against the wall.' I've worked hard to get to the position I'm
at. I want to keep it, so I've got to double up my efforts more.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things I missed about coaching was the
competition,'' said retired Buffalo Bills coach Marv Levy, who will
be part of the Fox Sports Net show. ``If there are a lot of shows
out there, it's good for the game, just as a lot of teams are good
for the game. I'm going to welcome the competition. I hope our show
is something people say is something special, just like they say
the Denver Broncos are something special.''

   MEANS-COLUMN (Washington) _ Among the 23,000 fans watching the
U.S. Open championship between Andre Agassi and Todd Martin Sunday
was Walter Cronkite, wearing a jacket and tie. He was the only one
spotted in the crowd attired so spiffily. Cronkite, bless his
heart, is a generational throwback. Dress codes are vanishing, even
here at the Washington Opera. The new sloppiness, one of the few
things we can't blame on President Clinton, is here to stay. By

HOMELESS PEOPLE ARE HUMAN, TOO 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The thing about Paul Boden and the Coalition on
Homelessness that makes them super attractive to some of us is the
same thing that makes a lot of other San Franciscans wish the
coalition would get the hell out of town:
</P>
<P>
   They are brutally honest, and they insist that homeless people
be treated as if they are 100 percent human and deserving of
genuine _ not virtual _ dignity.
</P>
<P>
   They also refuse to do the humble Uriah Heep bit because
somebody deigns to write a check or volunteer an hour's time for
the poor and downtrodden. They appreciate it, of course. But they
see help and charity as simply the decent thing to do for a just
society.
</P>
<P>
   Take the organization's fund-raiser on Wednesday at the Somarts
Gallery: a live and silent auction of dozens of stunning works
donated by some of the Bay Area's most talented artists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if we don't make money, it's going to be a positive
experience for all of us,'' Boden said. ``Last year, we netted
about $25,000 on the Willie (Brown) Roast. That money might be what
you want as a non-profit, but it was a hell of a price to pay. We
lost control of our message. The event just wasn't us. It was the
kind of event that _ if somebody else did it _ we'd probably
protest.''
</P>
<P>
   The Willie Roast _ a $150-a-ticket lambasting of the mayor at a
tony downtown hotel _ commemorated the coalition's 10th year of
existence. The art auction _ $15 a pop _ is in honor of the 10th
anniversary of the coalition's official newspaper, the Street
Sheet.
</P>
<P>
   Angry, irreverent and provocative, the newspaper is sold for $1
by poor women and men as an alternative to flat-out panhandling.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to volunteers, contributors and donors, the sellers get
to keep every cent of every buck.
</P>
<P>
   Several donated pieces came from artists like Art Hazelwood and
Roberta Loach, whose work has appeared over the years in the Street
Sheet. Others, such as Debra Koval's vibrant abstract ``Dream
Home'' (evocative of Miro and Kandinsky), are some artists' answer
to a cause they believe to be righteous.
</P>
<P>
   ``I work full-time and I'm a single parent,'' Koval said. ``This
is my way of volunteering.''
</P>
<P>
   The scope and quality of the 135 art works that will be
auctioned off is impressive enough to anchor any fund-raiser, be it
the symphony's or the coalition's. Landscapes, portraits, still
lifes, abstracts, folk art and primitives offer something for every
taste.
</P>
<P>
   Cityphiles with a hankering for new perspectives on our gorgeous
old town should be especially tempted to bid. Craig Nelson's tiny,
traditional oils, like ``Palace Pond,'' are exquisite.
</P>
<P>
   Christine Hanlon's haunting pastels, like ``Where Do You
Live?'', are quiet knock-outs.
</P>
<P>
   Like many of the contributing artists, Hanlon is an instructor
at the California Academy of Arts. Unlike many, she was once
homeless herself _ when she was in graduate school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, she was vehicularly housed,'' said the auction's
planner/coordinator, Kathleen Gray. ``She lived in her car.
Homelessness can happen to anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   That set of facts _ Hanlon was homeless, now she's not, and
she's been a creative force wherever she has lived _ basically sums
up Paul Boden's attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``The homeless are always being lumped into one big mass. Their
homelessness is used to define their entire life, their
individuality is ignored,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen through the Street Sheet what happens when people
can create their own vehicle for expression and put it out there
and see if it resonates with others. The Street Sheet has shown us
we resonate, that we're not alone. It wouldn't be here 10 years
later if people weren't reading it.''
</P>
<P>
   Although it works for many charitable organizations, the idea of
peddling pity is anathema to the Coalition members.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a difference between being written about as a
homeless person and writing your own stuff,'' Boden said. ``To have
a thought or an experience, to put it out there, whether it's an
editorial, a poem or art, and see the ripple effect of it, to
communicate directly with the community _ THAT'S power. That's what
this auction and the Coalition are about.''

research, as when Albert Einstein and the German mathematician
David Hilbert raced each other for the first correct formulation of

LIKE, YOU KNOW, LEARN TO TALK, PUH-LEEZ 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RAYNE WOLFE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ My boss (I call him ``Sir'') and I are being
driven mad by the way women talk. Especially the young ones with
``like'' and ``you know'' and ``you know, like.''
</P>
<P>
   They give him fits. Hearing one too many ``so I said, and he
said,'' accompanied by cries of ``oh, puh-leeez'' have made him
move to another table in restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps even more annoying to Sir than the speech patterns of
young women are those of more mature one who, like Catskills
comedians, pepper their monologues with ``yaddah, yaddah, yaddah,''
``Hel-lo?'' or, ``Get a clue, OK?''
</P>
<P>
   Sir and I agree that these speech patterns are learned _ but
from whom? There was a time when we could confidently blame the
Valley Girl phenomenon, but that impact has faded. Are movies and
television the source, offering up chatterboxes as models?
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to point a finger at anyone. Certainly, no one is
blaming Meryl Streep, who always speaks like a sip of amber
whiskey. Even the omnipresent Oprah, who has never shied away from
mugging at the camera, speaks in a dignified manner.
</P>
<P>
   Sir adds, ``If you could explain to me why it's the women and
not the men who insist on this childish nattering, you would, like,
totally make my day.''
</P>
<P>
   Unable to focus our ire properly, Sir and I have a running joke
about how modern women should study old movies to learn how to
speak well. Conversely, we wonder which movie stars' careers would
have been smashed had they delivered their lines like Starbucks'
clerks.
</P>
<P>
   So tell us. Why would any woman choose to speak like Cyndi
Lauper if she'd ever heard Lauren Bacall? Can you imagine the young
Bacall saying to Humphrey Bogart: ``Hey, Pal! You know, like uh,
how to like whistle, doncha? Hel-lo-oh? You go like this. Like,
just pucker your lips and _ blow! Duh!''
</P>
<P>
   Had Bacall spoken like most of the female marketing executives
we know, Bogart would have borrowed a good book from the captain's
library and curled up with it for the duration of the voyage. Fur
sure, mon. When Bette Davis delivered her famous line, ``Buckle up.
It's going to be a bumpy ride,'' in ``All about Eve,'' the audience
tittered in anticipation. She was a woman to be reckoned with.
</P>
<P>
   But would she have made the same impact had she said, ``You
know, I'm like feeling, like really awesome, hella bad vibes
tonight. Like, beam me up, Scotty!''?
</P>
<P>
   Or remember in ``Rear Window'' when Grace Kelly explained softly
that she brought the nicest little Mark Cross case that held all
she needed for a sleepover? James Stewart nearly forgot he was in a
wheelchair with a broken leg. But had Kelly squeaked, ``OhmyGod,
look at this, like, totally cute bag I got today!'' he might have
chosen instead to hook up with Thelma Ritter, the visiting nurse
who gave him his sponge baths.
</P>
<P>
   Sir and I agree that women who speak in this petulant teen-speak
should not expect to be taken seriously _ by anyone. So you tell
us. Given the choice of sounding like Fran Dresher playing a
gangster's moll or Audrey Hepburn as Holly Golightly, why are so
many American women turning their backs on the guaranteed allure,
not to mention the benefits, of mellifluous speech? You got me,
man. It's like, totally weird, you know?

   SCI-SCIENTIST-FEUDS (Undated) _ Though the casual reader would
never know it from the textbooks, beneath the flapping banners of
feuding scientific ideas, as often as not there are feuding
scientists. Some skirmishes do little more than quicken the pace of
research, as when Albert Einstein and the German mathematician
David Hilbert raced each other for the first correct formulation of
the equations of general relativity in 1915. Other spats have the

WATER TABLE MAY SOLVE A PROBLEM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating for all needing)  
 (For release Sunday, September 12, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. My house is 20 years old with original Masonite (hardboard)
siding. The two bottom strips of hardboard are rotting. A
contractor suggested putting up primed siding or vinyl, first
removing all the hardboard. Is removing the old hardboard
necessary?
</P>
<P>
   H.M., Marlborough, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Your contractor thinks so, and so does the handyman, if you
are going to put on any new siding. And, cedar, white or red,
clapboards or shingles, is better than vinyl, which in this
handyman's opinion is no better than the hardboard. The reason all
hardboard should come off is that it may decay under any new
siding; hardboard is notorious for decaying when it gets wet; that
is why it is so heavily painted. Also, new siding will lie smoothly
and evenly on the sheathing if the hardboard is removed.
</P>
<P>
   Here's another idea: If the hardboard is intact above the two
boards that are decaying, you can try this and save a bundle of
money: Take off the two decaying hardboard boards, and install a 1
x 10 or 1 x 12 pressure-treated board (whatever size will cover the
area of the two bottom boards that were removed). Put flashing
between the new board and the hardboard above. You are creating a
water table, which is the New England term for such a board. Let
that board weather or paint or stain it the same color as the trim
or hardboard.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have weeds growing in the cracks of a very long hardtop
driveway. You have mentioned using vinegar to keep them away. I
don't think vineger will kill the weeds or the seeds that they are
storing. Would a torch work?
</P>
<P>
   MARGO LONG, Reading, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. A torch (like an acetylene torch or similar fire-spewing
tool) will work, but could melt the hardtop. Better I think is a
hot-air gun. It too could melt the asphalt but any weed, and seeds,
should be dead by the time the gun threatens to melt the asphalt.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I just put up a new deck with a mahogany railing. I would
like it to weather. What can I do to make it weather nicely and
stand up to the weather?
</P>
<P>
   HOWARD LEVY, Swampscott, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Let's start with the mahogany railing. And this goes for the
floorboards, too, if they are mahogany. Mahogany is naturally decay
resistant and will weather to an attractive, even, silver color.
But, according to recent studies, it should not be left to weather
without some protection because ultraviolet rays break down lignin
in the wood, the ``glue'' that holds the wood together. When lignin
breaks down, the wood deteriorates.
</P>
<P>
   So, treat the wood with a clear sealer to prevent this. This
sealer should be renewed once every year or so; there is nothing
maintenance-free about a wood deck.
</P>
<P>
   This is particularly important on horizontal surfaces such as
floorboards and railings. Vertical surfaces are less likely to
deteriorate, but it is a good idea to seal these as well.
</P>
<P>
   This all applies to any other wood: pressure-treated, cedar,
Douglas fir, and all pines.
</P>
<P>
   The alternative to sealing and allowing the wood to weather is
to apply one coat of a semitransparent stain. You will get a color,
and the wood will not weather, but such stains last longer than
sealers; three or more years is typical for some semitransparent
stains; at that time, apply another single coat.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I want my brand new mahogany deck to keep its mahogany color.
I applied CWF (Clear Wood Finish) which is designed to keep wood
new-looking, but it didn't do very well. What can I use?
</P>
<P>
   KEITH FLAHERTY, Wilmington, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Nothing, other than trying other brands of a CWF-type finish.
Keeping wood new-looking outdoors goes against the natural tendency
of wood to weather; but people want such a new look, and
manufacturers are eager to accommodate their desires _ for money.
If you are unsatisfied with the CWF (or the even better CWF-UV,
which resists ultraviolet rays), go to a semitransparent stain.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. What are the pros and cons on garage doors: wood or metal?
The bottom panel of my custom-made door has rotted out and a
custom-made replacement costs $290. I can get a metal door for $550
to $750. Is it worth getting a new metal door?
</P>
<P>
   BARRY STEARNS, Waltham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, how long did the bottom panel last: 20 years? 10? The
point I'm getting at is that for $290 you will be set for another
10 to 20 years, or as long as the old panel lasted.
</P>
<P>
   That said, the steel doors are good, well painted, and light in
weight, and the price is right for a custom unit. They will dent,
and must be kept painted to prevent them from rusting; removing
rust and repainitng is a pain. Now you can make your choice. I
personally would opt for the replacement panel.
</P>
<P>
   Some garage doors are insulated. That is not a good argument for
buying such a door. Garage doors need no insulation because garages
are unheated; the insulation will do no good at all.

MUSTY CLOSET NEEDS VENTILATION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating for all needing)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER C. HOTTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. One of the upstairs closets in my Cape Cod-style house smells
funny, sort of dampish and musty. And a white shirt hanging in the
closet developed brown spots where it was closest to the wall. How
can I get rid of the smell, and the brown spots on the shirt, and
prevent them both from returning?
</P>
<P>
   CHRIS EVANS, Franklin, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Ah yes, moisture and mold rear their ugly heads again. Your
closet smells funny because it is closed. Water vapor builds up in
it; that causes the musty smell. When it condenses on a cool
surface, that causes mold to grow. The brown stain on the shirt is
probably rust, caused by a wet steel hanger.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, keep the closet door open, or install a louvered
door so that air can circulate and prevent the buildup of water
vapor. That should take care of a lot of the problems. Also, hang a
100-watt light bulb in the closet; this will provide enough warmth
to help dissipate the water vapor and prevent condensation. Keep
the light on, of course.
</P>
<P>
   If you see black smears in the closet, or little black dots, you
know you have mildew, and should wash it with a solution of 1 part
bleach and 3 parts water. This mildew treatment may be old hat to
the handyman, but many people are discovering it for the first
time, so it's always worth repeating. Also not old hat is this
necessary warning: wear skin and eye protection when working with
bleach.
</P>
<P>
   For the brown spots on the shirt, try treating them with Whink,
a rust remover sold in supermarkets. Avoid hanging a shirt on a
metal hanger, and keep it and other clothes a little farther away
from that cool wall. I know that might not be easy or even
possible, but clothes should be kept away from cool walls.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. The wallpaper in one room of my house was badly stained by
leaks from an ice dam. The paper is fairly old, and I don't think
it is vinyl-coated, but that stain really shows. How can I clean
it?
</P>
<P>
   TOM SANTORO, Malden, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Nothing that I know of will clean it, because water stains
are indelible. I don't think you can even disguise it, although you
can try erasing it with a gum eraser. If you have any spare paper
tucked away, you could use it as a patch or replace the entire
strip. This is your best chance for a match, because the spare
paper is just as old as that on the wall. It might be lighter,
however, because it has been rolled up all these years. Patching
with new paper, even if you can find the same pattern, is unlikely
to work because the old will be much darker than the new.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to this brilliant idea, if all else fails:
Repaper the entire wall with new paper of a similar pattern, or a
plain pattern. It might sound kind of funny to do one wall, but
what the heck, you solved the problem inexpensively, and such a
situation can be lived with until you are ready to redo the entire
room.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q Should I seal my new driveway after one year? It will cost
$800 to seal because it is so large (it cost $3,200 to install).
</P>
<P>
   A.R., Foxborough, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Save yourself $800, because it is not necessary to seal a
driveway, new or old. It is mostly for appearance's sake. That is
not just the handyman's opinion either, because one caller who
asked about it told the handyman that her driveway contractor said,
``Forget about it. It is only cosmetic.''

BAKING BREAD IS A CHORE NO MORE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By FRANCES INGRAHAM HEINS  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ In our fast-paced world, even bread has to keep
up with the times. Bread making by hand used to take hours, between
waiting for the yeast to rise and the kneading process.
</P>
<P>
   Automatic bread makers are improving, after being around for a
number of years. More than 20 million U.S. households have one,
according to Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers in
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Bread makers can be found in almost any appliance store and
catalog, but take your time and shop around, noting various
features so that you buy a model that meets your baking
requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Bread machines cost from $70 to more than $200. Models start
with very basic functions (making a single loaf of white bread) and
add more sophisticated features such as cycles for bagels, pizza
dough, batter breads and cake and jam bread. Delayed timers let you
set the bread to be ready when you want it. Some models can produce
a 2-pound loaf in less than an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Most make a 1-, 1 1/2- or 2-pound loaf in the nonstick pan.
Because consumers were not as happy with square loaves, many
machines now come with a horizontal style baking pan.
</P>
<P>
   With some bread machines, you can set the shape of the loaf and
color of the crust, from light to medium or dark. Most models have
a viewing window so you can watch the bread taking shape. The
display timer will tell you how much time is left until the dough
becomes bread.
</P>
<P>
   Other features include a power failure backup, fruit and nut
add-in beeper, whole wheat bread or multigrain cycles,
13-to-24-hour delay bake timer and cycle combinations.
</P>
<P>
   You get the flavorful aroma and fresh taste without the messy
cleanup.

traffic tie-ups, power outages and mass confusion stemming from the
date-related computer problem.
</P>
<P>
   But increasingly, experts believe the alarms have spurred enough
action to prevent significant equipment failures in this country.
The progress is ``far more than I would have predicted,'' said Sen.
Bob Bennett, R-Utah, chairman of the Senate Special Committee on
the Year 2000 Technology Problem.
</P>
<P>
   So while there are doom-sayers warning of apocalyptic failures
of power, transportation and military systems _ and many offering
to sell expensive forms of protection _ most experts advise
families simply to make the same preparations they would for a
severe winter storm.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the people most familiar with the bug, including Bennett,
won't declare the coast clear. Many small and medium-sized
businesses, as well as state and local governments, have much more
work to do. And in many countries, especially in Latin America,
Asia, Eastern Europe and Africa, both businesses and governments
remain far behind in preparing for Y2K.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am optimistic, but at the same time, I am absolutely certain
there will be Y2K incidents,'' Bennett said.
</P>
<P>
   The question no one can answer is whether the expected computer
malfunctions involving smaller companies and overseas suppliers
will be great enough to disrupt the supply chains that keep the
U.S. economy humming.
</P>
<P>
   Optimists say our economy is so strong that Y2K troubles won't
have a measurable impact. If one supplier shuts down because of
computer problems, another company with better equipment will
quickly take its place, they argue. Indeed, the economy will get a
boost as Y2K weeds out technologically trailing companies.
</P>
<P>
   But pessimists fear that Y2K could cause a cascade of small
failures that will build into big collapses of computer-controlled
systems and global supply chains, triggering a worldwide recession.
</P>
<P>
   What remains disconcerting so late into 1999 is that no one can
predict with total confidence what will happen just 103 days from
now.
</P>
<P>
   The roots of this problem can be traced back to the 1960s, when
mainframe computers began entering our workplaces. Early
programmers decided to use two digits to denote a year. For
example, 65 would represent 1965.
</P>
<P>
   The dating system continued through the 1970s and 1980s, both in
software and the embedded chips that controlled computers and
automated equipment.
</P>
<P>
   As long as computers were working with dates in the 1900s, the
digits created no problems. But many of these older programs have
no way of recognizing dates in 2000 and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   This might seem an almost trivial problem, but the complications
can be enormous.
</P>
<P>
   A bank's computer software might think a customer had been
saving money since 1900 and was owed a century's worth of interest
payments. An automated elevator's embedded chips might think it has
not been inspected since 1900 and shut itself down.
</P>
<P>
   Fixing Y2K problems already has cost the federal government more
than $8 billion, according to the U.S. General Accounting Office.
Industry is spending tens of billions more.
</P>
<P>
   If Jan. 1 passes quietly, it will not be proof that Y2K was all
hype or hoax, but rather that businesses ``recognized the problem
and addressed it with the right resources,'' said Tom Orlowski,
vice president of the National Association of Manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these expensive efforts, experts are reluctant to
declare victory over the Y2K bug. That's because many computers and
chips are physically inaccessible, making it impossible to test
them. The chips in satellites in outer spaces or in drilling
equipment beneath the ocean's surface can't be guaranteed to work
properly on 1-1-00.
</P>
<P>
   Also, so much effort has gone into fixing the most crucial
computers that smaller problems may have been ignored. A good
example of that turned up recently when the Social Security
Administration mailed letters to more than 32,000 people announcing
that certain benefits would end on Jan. 1, 1900.
</P>
<P>
   The agency, which had been bragging for months about its success
in fixing the ``mission-critical'' systems responsible for cutting
checks, admitted it had not repaired the machine that printed the
letters.
</P>
<P>
   Both optimists and pessimists point to the Social Security
incident to support their arguments.
</P>
<P>
   Optimists admit that odd problems will occur, but nothing that
would necessitate hoarding food or pulling all your money out of
the bank.
</P>
<P>
   But pessimists say the letter shows the bug is so pervasive that
even the powerful federal government cannot stop it. On Jan. 1,
they warn, so many computer errors will occur at once that chaos
could break out.
</P>
<P>
   The worst-case scenarios go something like this: Shortly after
midnight Jan. 1, Y2K bugs will cause the power to go out in a
number of cities. Many telecommunications systems will falter
because the chips embedded in satellites and other kinds of
equipment will fail. In a few cities, explosions will light up the
skies over chemical plants. In poorer countries, nuclear power
plants will begin spewing dangerous materials into the environment
and millions of people will start freezing to death in cold places
like Russia and North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   News stories about the explosions and power outages will cause
people everywhere to panic, triggering bank runs, food shortages
and looting. Y2K problems in other countries will be so severe that
U.S. manufacturers will be unable to get parts, causing massive
layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, that scenario seemed to have more credibility. But
today, mainstream thinking is much less grim. Most information
technology officials say the problems that will occur in this
country will take no more than 72 hours to fix.
</P>
<P>
   A three- to four-day estimate for disruptions has become the
norm among leading experts on Y2K. Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn.,
vice-chairman of the Y2K committee, is urging Americans to have 72
hours worth of food, water, medicine and warm clothing ready, just
in case problems strike in their areas.
</P>
<P>
   But he hastens to point out that stockpiling food or cash for a
long haul would be more dangerous than doing nothing, because it
could cause bank runs or stampedes to stores.

 &HT;    TIME TO GET READY FOR POSSIBLE Y2K DISRUPTIONS
 &HT;    With Y2K. Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories
for release Sunday, Sept. 19.
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Don't panic, but get prepared.
</P>
<P>
   While the nation's basic infrastructure will function after Jan.
1, authorities say the Y2K computer is sure to cause some problems.
The power could go out in one community, while the water system
falters in another and traffic lights could malfunction in still
another.
</P>
<P>
   Because no one can say with certainty which systems might fail,
``the basic message we are giving people is ...be prepared for an
emergency,'' said Red Cross spokeswoman Leslie Credit.
</P>
<P>
   She stressed that the Red Cross always gives out that message,
so people should not be panicked by the arrival of the year 2000,
when some older computers might malfunction by reading the date as
1900.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know what kind of disaster could happen,'' Credit
said. ``A big storm could hit at any time, or a chemical truck
could be driving through your area and turn over. We see Y2K as a
great opportunity to teach people about everyday preparedness.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Cross and government agencies responsible for public
safety are fairly consistent in their advice about Y2K
preparations. For example, all urge consumers to assess the
particular needs of their households. A North Dakota farm family
with infant twins will have very different needs from a retired
couple living in a South Florida high-rise.
</P>
<P>
   Start your preparations by figuring out who is going to be in
your household between Dec. 31 and mid-January, and what each
person's special needs will be. Then lay out a strategy for making
sure everyone can stay hydrated, healthy and warm for up to two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   These are among the recommendations being made by mainstream
agencies:
</P>
<P>
   WATER
</P>
<P>
   THE POTENTIAL PROBLEM: Local providers typically keep water
flowing by using pumps and valves controlled by microprocessors and
chips. Computers also regulate various aspects of water treatment,
such as the addition of chlorine. In addition, Y2K-related power
outages could cause a loss of heat that would allow pipes to freeze
and burst.
</P>
<P>
   THE SOLUTION: Store water for each member of the household,
based on an estimate of one gallon per person per day. Storing
water costs very little and is easy to do. Drinking water can be
drawn from the tap and stored in thoroughly cleaned plastic jugs
with tight lids. Don't use rust-prone metal containers or heavy,
breakable glass jugs. Don't fill the jugs to the limit in case the
water freezes and expands.
</P>
<P>
   Save water for bathing and flushing toilets in a large, clean
container such as a new garbage can or a water bed.
</P>
<P>
   Five-gallon containers are convenient and stackable, but don't
forget that water is heavy _ eight pounds a gallon. Filled
containers must be stored on very sturdy shelves or on the floor.
Water should not be stored where the temperature reaches above 100
degrees or below 32 degrees. Keep water containers out of direct
sunlight and away from chemicals, paints and fertilizers.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT YOU SHOULD BE DOING NOW: Start saving cleaned 2-liter drink
containers and their lids. Find and clean containers that can be
used for storing washing water. Figure out where to safely store
your water and plan on filling the containers in November. Learn
where your house's main water shutoff valve is located and how to
operate it in the event of burst pipes.
</P>
<P>
   FOOD
</P>
<P>
   THE POTENTIAL PROBLEM: Buying food at the grocery store may be
difficult in the first few days of January because of power
outages, traffic-light failures, or public transportation delays.
Also, you might need more food than usual in your home because of
delayed school or workplace openings.
</P>
<P>
   THE SOLUTION: Store food for each member of the household, and
be sure to figure out whether you will have any special needs. For
example, will you need baby food for a visiting grandchild? Pet
food? Do you have children with peanut allergies?
</P>
<P>
   Your best choices will be canned and non-perishable foods that
are tasty and don't require refrigeration (in case of a power
outage) or cooking (in case the natural gas fails). So buy canned
tuna, fruits, long-lasting fresh vegetables such as carrots and
cauliflower, canned hams, peanut butter, crackers, fruit bars,
trail mix, cereals, powdered milk, granola bars, cookies, canned
beans and other vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   It may be prudent to store an additional two weeks of
``emergency'' foods in case grocery prices shoot up in January
because of supply disruptions. For example, Y2K problems in Latin
America and the Caribbean could interrupt supplies of fruits and
vegetables, making them much more expensive. For your reserves,
have some dried fruits, as well as freeze-dried or dehydrated
products with very long shelf lives. Any products that you don't
use for Y2K will be on hand for future emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT YOU SHOULD BE DOING NOW: Create a clean, safe storage area
in your home and start putting canned and packaged foods there.
Mark the purchase date on the products so that you remember to eat
your oldest foods first (most foods off of the grocery store
shelves are good for six to 24 months).
</P>
<P>
   Don't wait until December to start shopping. Prices may be
higher then because of Y2K stockpiling, as well holiday demand. A
few purchases each week over the next two months will be cheaper
and will let you avoid last-minute ``runs'' on grocery stores.
</P>
<P>
   WARMTH
</P>
<P>
   THE POTENTIAL PROBLEM: Unfortunately, Y2K problems will be
hitting at the coldest time of the year. That means homes could get
very cold very fast in case of a loss of electrical power or
interruptions in the delivery of gas, coal or oil. A lack of heat
could be the most dangerous aspect of Y2K.
</P>
<P>
   THE SOLUTION: Every household should have a source of heat that
does not rely on electricity or the delivery of fuel after
mid-December. Remember that in an emergency, you don't need to heat
the entire house, just an area big enough to keep household
members' teeth from chattering.
</P>
<P>
   For homes with working fireplaces, the solution may seem simple:
buy a cord of wood. But in many modern homes, fireplaces are
primarily decorative and allow most of the heat to go up the
chimney. Fireplaces with heat reflectors and energy-efficient
inserts keep rooms warmer. A wood stove, which puts out far more
heat, can be installed by a professional.
</P>
<P>
   But many people don't have a fireplace and don't want a wood
stove. For such households, a kerosene space heater can be used.
But remember, a kerosene heater cannot be operated in a small room
without ventilation. Heater manufacturers recommend opening a door
to an adjoining room or leaving an outside window slightly open.
</P>
<P>
   For cooking, you can stock up on cans of Sterno, which contain
jelled ethanol. A can will provide enough heat to warm a pan of
soup or make a cup of tea. An outdoor propane or charcoal grill can
work well for cooking _ as long as you keep it outside. A grill
used indoors can emit deadly fumes.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT YOU SHOULD BE DOING NOW: If you have a fireplace, look into
purchasing a heat reflector or insert. Purchase a good-sized stack
of hardwood and find a dry place to store it. Get a non-electric
space heater if you need one and buy the fuel for it now. Learn how
to operate your heating source safely. Go to a camping goods store
and buy Sterno cans. Make sure the propane tank on your outdoor
grill is full.
</P>
<P>
   Also, have several fire extinguishers in the house, as well as
battery-operated smoke detectors and carbon-monoxide detectors.
</P>
<P>
   Check your supplies of warm clothes and bedding. Make sure
you'll have enough sleeping bags, hats, quilts, and gloves for
everyone in the household.
</P>
<P>
   LIGHT
</P>
<P>
   THE POTENTIAL PROBLEM: Y2K problems could knock out electrical
power during the darkest time of the year.
</P>
<P>
   THE SOLUTION: Flashlights are by far the safest way to light the
night, especially in homes with children. Candles generally are not
a good idea because they have open flames and generate relatively
little light. Also, most candles are intended for decoration and
burn out quickly. Kerosene lanterns can be a little smelly, but
generate steady light.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT YOU SHOULD BE DOING NOW: Be sure you have plenty of
flashlights and fresh batteries. Each time you go to the grocery
store, pick up a few batteries so that you don't get hit with a big
cost in December.
</P>
<P>
   MEDICAL NEEDS
</P>
<P>
   THE POTENTIAL PROBLEM: Because of traffic problems created by
Y2K, it may be difficult to get to the doctor or pick up a
prescription in early January.
</P>
<P>
   THE SOLUTION: People who need medications should get
prescriptions filled before mid-December. Schedule any elective
surgery before early December.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT YOU SHOULD BE DOING NOW: Schedule doctor appointments now
so that you can be sure your prescriptions are up to date. Think
about all of your health and body needs. For example, do you need
contact lens solution, tampons or vitamins? Be sure to have an
emergency medical kit with supplies such as bandages, antibiotic
ointments, hydrogen peroxide, a thermometer and aspirin.
</P>
<P>
   FINANCIAL INFORMATION
</P>
<P>
   THE POTENTIAL PROBLEM: Although banks and other financial
institutions appear to be among the most Y2K-ready businesses in
the country, there is a potential for records to get mixed up.
</P>
<P>
   THE SOLUTION: Keep copies of your important financial records in
a dry, fireproof place. Your records should include insurance
policies, mortgage information, reports on Social Securities
earnings, investment records, employer 401(k) plans and all banking
records. Get a copy of your credit report. Keep records of all of
your ATM activities in December and January.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT YOU SHOULD BE DOING NOW: Start organizing your paperwork
immediately. Submit a request for your earnings and benefits from
the Social Security Administration by calling 1-800-772-1213 or
going to the SSA Internet site (http://www.socialsecurity.gov).

 &HT;    WHAT NOT TO DO WHEN THE MILLENNIUM NEARS
 &HT;    With Y2K. Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories
for release Sunday, Sept. 19.
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many Americans are checking off lists of things to do as they
prepare for possible Y2K problems. But a list of what not to do on
Jan. 1. is just as important.
</P>
<P>
   _ DON'T pick up the phone at 12:01 a.m. to wish loved ones a
happy new year. Phone companies say there's a limit to how many
receivers can get a dial tone at one time, regardless of
Y2K-related problems.
</P>
<P>
   _ DON'T run into the yard at 11:59 p.m. Dec. 31 to welcome 2000
by firing a gun. Every bullet that goes up must come down _
possibly into the skull of your neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   _ DON'T stockpile gasoline. Fill your car's gas tank several
days before the year's end _ period. Keeping big containers full of
gasoline in the garage is an invitation to disaster.
</P>
<P>
   _ DON'T wait until 8 p.m. on Dec. 31 to go to an automated
teller machine for cash. If everyone waits until the final hours of
1999 to stock up on cash for the long weekend, the machines will
run dry and stir fears of bank failures. And don't keep large
amounts of cash in your home, vulnerable to thieves.
</P>
<P>
   _ DON'T invite hordes over for a New Year's Eve dinner and then
wait until 3 p.m. on Dec. 31 to buy your food and beverages. If
huge crowds pack into grocery stores on the last day of the year,
tempers could flare in long checkout lines and contribute to a
panicky feeling that night.
</P>
<P>
   _ DON'T make elaborate travel plans for the first few days of
January. Though airlines promise to be safe, no one can guarantee
that airport computers won't mix up reservations or that traffic
lights surrounding airports won't malfunction.
</P>
<P>
   _ DON'T fall for Y2K scams. Con artists are using Y2K to cheat
people out of their money. For example, some crooks pretend to be
bank officials calling people for personal financial information
``to conduct Y2K tests.'' Other shady organizations are touting
overpriced goods and services that are ``Y2K guaranteed.''

 &HT;    SOME DOOM-SAYERS SEE Y2K AS AN OPPORTUNITY
 &HT;    With Y2K. Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories
for release Sunday, Sept. 19.
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The threat of Y2K-related computer failures Jan. 1
is causing some Americans to prepare for an event so catastrophic
that society will break down and guns will be needed to protect the
money stuffed into the mattresses.
</P>
<P>
   But many of the alarmists insisting Y2K will trigger the
collapse of banks are working overtime to load up their own bank
accounts this fall. Profiteers are using Y2K pitches to peddle
``survivalist'' products such as guns, gold coins, dehydrated foods
and portable generators.
</P>
<P>
   Not every Y2K doomsayer is motivated by profit. Some sincerely
believe our technologically advanced society is in grave danger
from Y2K and that we should be preparing to live a much simpler way
of life. Still others are hawking Y2K hysteria to advance
ideological causes or fanatical religious beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some of the groups making the most out of the approach
of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   PROFITEERS: These entrepreneurs are selling ordinary products,
but marketing them as something special for Y2K.
</P>
<P>
   In August, Gun World magazine warned that ``every family''
should prepare for Jan. 1 by owning ``at least two rifles.'' The
same month, the American Guardian, a journal of the National Rifle
Association, urged people to stock up on enough ammo to blast away
during ``a few weeks of severe social unrest.'' And Interstate Arms
Corp. of Billerica, Mass., is promoting the ``Y2K Limited Edition
Carbine'' with 30-round magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Makers of gold medallions also are aggressive in exploiting Y2K
anxieties, telling consumers that gold will be the only
``currency'' with value after Jan. 1. Although gold prices have
been languishing at depressed levels, one company has been selling
gold at prices far above market value after stamping pieces of the
metal with images of religious figures.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies are marking up the prices on simple products,
such as flashlights and freeze-dried foods, and marketing them as
``Y2K-guaranteed.'' Some con artists are using Y2K as a way to
trick gullible bank customers into disclosing personal financial
information, such as passwords for ATMs, to help with computer
``testing.''
</P>
<P>
   ARMAGEDDON BELIEVERS: Some fundamentalist Christians are
convinced that Y2K problems will trigger the rise of the Antichrist
and hasten the second coming of Christ. These groups encourage
adherents to stockpile food and water and develop survival skills
to prepare for this extremely turbulent time.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the author of the book ``God's Free Harvest'' urges
Christians to prepare for Y2K by learning to live on acorns and
weeds. His book teaches readers how to ``use cattails for an
outdoor meal'' and ``make coffee from dandelion roots.''
</P>
<P>
   FORMER ``HIPPIES'': Some baby boomers who in their younger days
seriously questioned this country's economic system are now using
Y2K as a means to promote simplicity. Rather than stress the
survivalist approach of stocking up on guns and moving into
bunkers, these groups focus on building a sense of community,
urging people to grow vegetables in neighborhood gardens, can
foods, harness solar power and share other resources.
</P>
<P>
   HATE GROUPS: Some extremist groups believe Y2K could create the
social chaos needed to trigger a ``race war'' that will allow white
Christians to kill Jews, blacks and other minorities. They urge
adherents to use Y2K-related power outages and any subsequent store
lootings as excuses to start shooting.
</P>
<P>
   SURVIVALISTS: Some people taking extreme steps to prepare for
Y2K, such as moving to remote farms with no electrical power, are
not racists, hippies or religious fanatics. They are simply
convinced that Y2K will trigger a cascade of equipment failures
that will cause power plants to crash, water spigots to run dry and
planes to fall from the sky.

 &HT;    'PRUDENCE, NOT PANIC' IS WATCHWORD FOR Y2K PREPARATIONS
 &HT;    With Y2K. Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories
for release Sunday, Sept. 19.
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With little more than 100 days left until the Jan.
1 deadline when computers might malfunction because of the
so-called Y2K bug, experts say individuals must join in the battle.
</P>
<P>
   All Americans can make responsible contingency plans to cope
with difficulties that might arise in early January, according to
Rep. Stephen Horn, R-Calif., chairman of the House Government
Reform subcommittee, which monitors Y2K efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prudence, not panic'' is his motto.
</P>
<P>
   Like most other Y2K experts, Horn says each household should
prepare for possible disruptions in the delivery of electricity,
water, phone service or heat. While utilities and other companies
have made enormous progress in reprogramming computers and chips
embedded in equipment, no one can guarantee there won't be
scattered service breakdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Mainstream experts say Y2K tests show that significant problems
almost certainly can be fixed within 72 hours, so there is no need
for hoarding of water, food or cash. Even worst-case scenarios call
for only two weeks of disruptions.
</P>
<P>
   But while problems are not likely to be long in duration, even
one night without electricity in January can be dangerous unless
contingency plans are in place.
</P>
<P>
   By setting aside some water, fresh batteries, warm blankets and
nutritious foods that need no significant preparation, families can
protect themselves, according to the American Red Cross and other
relief organizations.
</P>
<P>
   And if Jan. 1 does pass quietly, as it will for the great
majority of Americans, then no harm will have been done. Households
with emergency supplies will be better prepared for the next
problem.

 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Paul Reveres of the Information Age will learn
in little more than 100 days whether their shouts have roused the
public from complacency about the Y2K computer bug.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 1, Americans who go on their own midnight rides may see
traffic tie-ups, power outages and mass confusion stemming from the
date-related computer problem.
</P>
<P>
   But increasingly, experts believe the alarms have spurred enough
action to prevent significant equipment failures in this country.
The progress is ``far more than I would have predicted,'' said Sen.
Bob Bennett, R-Utah, chairman of the Senate Special Committee on
the Year 2000 Technology Problem.
</P>
<P>
   So while there are doom-sayers warning of apocalyptic failures
of power, transportation and military systems _ and many offering
to sell expensive forms of protection _ most experts advise
families simply to make the same preparations they would for a
severe winter storm.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the people most familiar with the bug, including Bennett,
won't declare the coast clear. Many small and medium-sized
businesses, as well as state and local governments, have much more
work to do. And in many countries, especially in Latin America,
Asia, Eastern Europe and Africa, both businesses and governments
remain far behind in preparing for Y2K.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am optimistic, but at the same time, I am absolutely certain
there will be Y2K incidents,'' Bennett said.
</P>
<P>
   The question no one can answer is whether the expected computer
malfunctions involving smaller companies and overseas suppliers
will be great enough to disrupt the supply chains that keep the
U.S. economy humming.
</P>
<P>
   Optimists say our economy is so strong that Y2K troubles won't
have a measurable impact. If one supplier shuts down because of
computer problems, another company with better equipment will
quickly take its place, they argue. Indeed, the economy will get a
boost as Y2K weeds out technologically trailing companies.
</P>
<P>
   But pessimists fear that Y2K could cause a cascade of small
failures that will build into big collapses of computer-controlled
systems and global supply chains, triggering a worldwide recession.
</P>
<P>
   What remains disconcerting so late into 1999 is that no one can
predict with total confidence what will happen just 103 days from
now.
</P>
<P>
   The roots of this problem can be traced back to the 1960s, when
mainframe computers began entering our workplaces. Early
programmers decided to use two digits to denote a year. For
example, 65 would represent 1965.
</P>
<P>
   The dating system continued through the 1970s and 1980s, both in
software and the embedded chips that controlled computers and
automated equipment.
</P>
<P>
   As long as computers were working with dates in the 1900s, the
digits created no problems. But many of these older programs have
no way of recognizing dates in 2000 and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   This might seem an almost trivial problem, but the complications
can be enormous.
</P>
<P>
   A bank's computer software might think a customer had been
saving money since 1900 and was owed a century's worth of interest
payments. An automated elevator's embedded chips might think it has
not been inspected since 1900 and shut itself down.
</P>
<P>
   Fixing Y2K problems already has cost the federal government more
than $8 billion, according to the U.S. General Accounting Office.
Industry is spending tens of billions more.
</P>
<P>
   If Jan. 1 passes quietly, it will not be proof that Y2K was all
hype or hoax, but rather that businesses ``recognized the problem
and addressed it with the right resources,'' said Tom Orlowski,
vice president of the National Association of Manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these expensive efforts, experts are reluctant to
declare victory over the Y2K bug. That's because many computers and
chips are physically inaccessible, making it impossible to test
them. The chips in satellites in outer spaces or in drilling
equipment beneath the ocean's surface can't be guaranteed to work
properly on 1-1-00.
</P>
<P>
   Also, so much effort has gone into fixing the most crucial
computers that smaller problems may have been ignored. A good
example of that turned up recently when the Social Security
Administration mailed letters to more than 32,000 people announcing
that certain benefits would end on Jan. 1, 1900.
</P>
<P>
   The agency, which had been bragging for months about its success
in fixing the ``mission-critical'' systems responsible for cutting
checks, admitted it had not repaired the machine that printed the
letters.
</P>
<P>
   Both optimists and pessimists point to the Social Security
incident to support their arguments.
</P>
<P>
   Optimists admit that odd problems will occur, but nothing that
would necessitate hoarding food or pulling all your money out of
the bank.
</P>
<P>
   But pessimists say the letter shows the bug is so pervasive that
even the powerful federal government cannot stop it. On Jan. 1,
they warn, so many computer errors will occur at once that chaos
could break out.
</P>
<P>
   The worst-case scenarios go something like this: Shortly after
midnight Jan. 1, Y2K bugs will cause the power to go out in a
number of cities. Many telecommunications systems will falter
because the chips embedded in satellites and other kinds of
equipment will fail. In a few cities, explosions will light up the
skies over chemical plants. In poorer countries, nuclear power
plants will begin spewing dangerous materials into the environment
and millions of people will start freezing to death in cold places
like Russia and North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   News stories about the explosions and power outages will cause
people everywhere to panic, triggering bank runs, food shortages
and looting. Y2K problems in other countries will be so severe that
U.S. manufacturers will be unable to get parts, causing massive
layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, that scenario seemed to have more credibility. But
today, mainstream thinking is much less grim. Most information
technology officials say the problems that will occur in this
country will take no more than 72 hours to fix.
</P>
<P>
   A three- to four-day estimate for disruptions has become the
norm among leading experts on Y2K. Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn.,
vice-chairman of the Y2K committee, is urging Americans to have 72
hours worth of food, water, medicine and warm clothing ready, just
in case problems strike in their areas.
</P>
<P>
   But he hastens to point out that stockpiling food or cash for a
long haul would be more dangerous than doing nothing, because it
could cause bank runs or stampedes to stores.

 &HT;    TIME TO GET READY FOR POSSIBLE Y2K DISRUPTIONS
 &HT;    With Y2K. Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories
for release Sunday, Sept. 19.
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Don't panic, but get prepared.
</P>
<P>
   While the nation's basic infrastructure will function after Jan.
1, authorities say the Y2K computer is sure to cause some problems.
The power could go out in one community, while the water system
falters in another and traffic lights could malfunction in still
another.
</P>
<P>
   Because no one can say with certainty which systems might fail,
``the basic message we are giving people is ...be prepared for an
emergency,'' said Red Cross spokeswoman Leslie Credit.
</P>
<P>
   She stressed that the Red Cross always gives out that message,
so people should not be panicked by the arrival of the year 2000,
when some older computers might malfunction by reading the date as
1900.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know what kind of disaster could happen,'' Credit
said. ``A big storm could hit at any time, or a chemical truck
could be driving through your area and turn over. We see Y2K as a
great opportunity to teach people about everyday preparedness.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Cross and government agencies responsible for public
safety are fairly consistent in their advice about Y2K
preparations. For example, all urge consumers to assess the
particular needs of their households. A North Dakota farm family
with infant twins will have very different needs from a retired
couple living in a South Florida high-rise.
</P>
<P>
   Start your preparations by figuring out who is going to be in
your household between Dec. 31 and mid-January, and what each
person's special needs will be. Then lay out a strategy for making
sure everyone can stay hydrated, healthy and warm for up to two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   These are among the recommendations being made by mainstream
agencies:
</P>
<P>
   WATER
</P>
<P>
   THE POTENTIAL PROBLEM: Local providers typically keep water
flowing by using pumps and valves controlled by microprocessors and
chips. Computers also regulate various aspects of water treatment,
such as the addition of chlorine. In addition, Y2K-related power
outages could cause a loss of heat that would allow pipes to freeze
and burst.
</P>
<P>
   THE SOLUTION: Store water for each member of the household,
based on an estimate of one gallon per person per day. Storing
water costs very little and is easy to do. Drinking water can be
drawn from the tap and stored in thoroughly cleaned plastic jugs
with tight lids. Don't use rust-prone metal containers or heavy,
breakable glass jugs. Don't fill the jugs to the limit in case the
water freezes and expands.
</P>
<P>
   Save water for bathing and flushing toilets in a large, clean
container such as a new garbage can or a water bed.
</P>
<P>
   Five-gallon containers are convenient and stackable, but don't
forget that water is heavy _ eight pounds a gallon. Filled
containers must be stored on very sturdy shelves or on the floor.
Water should not be stored where the temperature reaches above 100
degrees or below 32 degrees. Keep water containers out of direct
sunlight and away from chemicals, paints and fertilizers.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT YOU SHOULD BE DOING NOW: Start saving cleaned 2-liter drink
containers and their lids. Find and clean containers that can be
used for storing washing water. Figure out where to safely store
your water and plan on filling the containers in November. Learn
where your house's main water shutoff valve is located and how to
operate it in the event of burst pipes.
</P>
<P>
   FOOD
</P>
<P>
   THE POTENTIAL PROBLEM: Buying food at the grocery store may be
difficult in the first few days of January because of power
outages, traffic-light failures, or public transportation delays.
Also, you might need more food than usual in your home because of
delayed school or workplace openings.
</P>
<P>
   THE SOLUTION: Store food for each member of the household, and
be sure to figure out whether you will have any special needs. For
example, will you need baby food for a visiting grandchild? Pet
food? Do you have children with peanut allergies?
</P>
<P>
   Your best choices will be canned and non-perishable foods that
are tasty and don't require refrigeration (in case of a power
outage) or cooking (in case the natural gas fails). So buy canned
tuna, fruits, long-lasting fresh vegetables such as carrots and
cauliflower, canned hams, peanut butter, crackers, fruit bars,
trail mix, cereals, powdered milk, granola bars, cookies, canned
beans and other vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   It may be prudent to store an additional two weeks of
``emergency'' foods in case grocery prices shoot up in January
because of supply disruptions. For example, Y2K problems in Latin
America and the Caribbean could interrupt supplies of fruits and
vegetables, making them much more expensive. For your reserves,
have some dried fruits, as well as freeze-dried or dehydrated
products with very long shelf lives. Any products that you don't
use for Y2K will be on hand for future emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT YOU SHOULD BE DOING NOW: Create a clean, safe storage area
in your home and start putting canned and packaged foods there.
Mark the purchase date on the products so that you remember to eat
your oldest foods first (most foods off of the grocery store
shelves are good for six to 24 months).
</P>
<P>
   Don't wait until December to start shopping. Prices may be
higher then because of Y2K stockpiling, as well holiday demand. A
few purchases each week over the next two months will be cheaper
and will let you avoid last-minute ``runs'' on grocery stores.
</P>
<P>
   WARMTH
</P>
<P>
   THE POTENTIAL PROBLEM: Unfortunately, Y2K problems will be
hitting at the coldest time of the year. That means homes could get
very cold very fast in case of a loss of electrical power or
interruptions in the delivery of gas, coal or oil. A lack of heat
could be the most dangerous aspect of Y2K.
</P>
<P>
   THE SOLUTION: Every household should have a source of heat that
does not rely on electricity or the delivery of fuel after
mid-December. Remember that in an emergency, you don't need to heat
the entire house, just an area big enough to keep household
members' teeth from chattering.
</P>
<P>
   For homes with working fireplaces, the solution may seem simple:
buy a cord of wood. But in many modern homes, fireplaces are
primarily decorative and allow most of the heat to go up the
chimney. Fireplaces with heat reflectors and energy-efficient
inserts keep rooms warmer. A wood stove, which puts out far more
heat, can be installed by a professional.
</P>
<P>
   But many people don't have a fireplace and don't want a wood
stove. For such households, a kerosene space heater can be used.
But remember, a kerosene heater cannot be operated in a small room
without ventilation. Heater manufacturers recommend opening a door
to an adjoining room or leaving an outside window slightly open.
</P>
<P>
   For cooking, you can stock up on cans of Sterno, which contain
jelled ethanol. A can will provide enough heat to warm a pan of
soup or make a cup of tea. An outdoor propane or charcoal grill can
work well for cooking _ as long as you keep it outside. A grill
used indoors can emit deadly fumes.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT YOU SHOULD BE DOING NOW: If you have a fireplace, look into
purchasing a heat reflector or insert. Purchase a good-sized stack
of hardwood and find a dry place to store it. Get a non-electric
space heater if you need one and buy the fuel for it now. Learn how
to operate your heating source safely. Go to a camping goods store
and buy Sterno cans. Make sure the propane tank on your outdoor
grill is full.
</P>
<P>
   Also, have several fire extinguishers in the house, as well as
battery-operated smoke detectors and carbon-monoxide detectors.
</P>
<P>
   Check your supplies of warm clothes and bedding. Make sure
you'll have enough sleeping bags, hats, quilts, and gloves for
everyone in the household.
</P>
<P>
   LIGHT
</P>
<P>
   THE POTENTIAL PROBLEM: Y2K problems could knock out electrical
power during the darkest time of the year.
</P>
<P>
   THE SOLUTION: Flashlights are by far the safest way to light the
night, especially in homes with children. Candles generally are not
a good idea because they have open flames and generate relatively
little light. Also, most candles are intended for decoration and
burn out quickly. Kerosene lanterns can be a little smelly, but
generate steady light.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT YOU SHOULD BE DOING NOW: Be sure you have plenty of
flashlights and fresh batteries. Each time you go to the grocery
store, pick up a few batteries so that you don't get hit with a big
cost in December.
</P>
<P>
   MEDICAL NEEDS
</P>
<P>
   THE POTENTIAL PROBLEM: Because of traffic problems created by
Y2K, it may be difficult to get to the doctor or pick up a
prescription in early January.
</P>
<P>
   THE SOLUTION: People who need medications should get
prescriptions filled before mid-December. Schedule any elective
surgery before early December.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT YOU SHOULD BE DOING NOW: Schedule doctor appointments now
so that you can be sure your prescriptions are up to date. Think
about all of your health and body needs. For example, do you need
contact lens solution, tampons or vitamins? Be sure to have an
emergency medical kit with supplies such as bandages, antibiotic
ointments, hydrogen peroxide, a thermometer and aspirin.
</P>
<P>
   FINANCIAL INFORMATION
</P>
<P>
   THE POTENTIAL PROBLEM: Although banks and other financial
institutions appear to be among the most Y2K-ready businesses in
the country, there is a potential for records to get mixed up.
</P>
<P>
   THE SOLUTION: Keep copies of your important financial records in
a dry, fireproof place. Your records should include insurance
policies, mortgage information, reports on Social Securities
earnings, investment records, employer 401(k) plans and all banking
records. Get a copy of your credit report. Keep records of all of
your ATM activities in December and January.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT YOU SHOULD BE DOING NOW: Start organizing your paperwork
immediately. Submit a request for your earnings and benefits from
the Social Security Administration by calling 1-800-772-1213 or
going to the SSA Internet site (http://www.socialsecurity.gov).

 &HT;    WHAT NOT TO DO WHEN THE MILLENNIUM NEARS
 &HT;    With Y2K. Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories
for release Sunday, Sept. 19.
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX

<TEXT>
<P>
   Many Americans are checking off lists of things to do as they
prepare for possible Y2K problems. But a list of what not to do on
Jan. 1. is just as important.
</P>
<P>
   _ DON'T pick up the phone at 12:01 a.m. to wish loved ones a
happy new year. Phone companies say there's a limit to how many
receivers can get a dial tone at one time, regardless of
Y2K-related problems.
</P>
<P>
   _ DON'T run into the yard at 11:59 p.m. Dec. 31 to welcome 2000
by firing a gun. Every bullet that goes up must come down _
possibly into the skull of your neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   _ DON'T stockpile gasoline. Fill your car's gas tank several
days before the year's end _ period. Keeping big containers full of
gasoline in the garage is an invitation to disaster.
</P>
<P>
   _ DON'T wait until 8 p.m. on Dec. 31 to go to an automated
teller machine for cash. If everyone waits until the final hours of
1999 to stock up on cash for the long weekend, the machines will
run dry and stir fears of bank failures. And don't keep large
amounts of cash in your home, vulnerable to thieves.
</P>
<P>
   _ DON'T invite hordes over for a New Year's Eve dinner and then
wait until 3 p.m. on Dec. 31 to buy your food and beverages. If
huge crowds pack into grocery stores on the last day of the year,
tempers could flare in long checkout lines and contribute to a
panicky feeling that night.
</P>
<P>
   _ DON'T make elaborate travel plans for the first few days of
January. Though airlines promise to be safe, no one can guarantee
that airport computers won't mix up reservations or that traffic
lights surrounding airports won't malfunction.
</P>
<P>
   _ DON'T fall for Y2K scams. Con artists are using Y2K to cheat
people out of their money. For example, some crooks pretend to be
bank officials calling people for personal financial information
``to conduct Y2K tests.'' Other shady organizations are touting
overpriced goods and services that are ``Y2K guaranteed.''

   WASHINGTON _ The threat of Y2K-related computer failures Jan. 1
is causing some Americans to prepare for an event so catastrophic
that society will break down and guns will be needed to protect the
money stuffed into the mattresses.
</P>
<P>
   But many of the alarmists insisting Y2K will trigger the
collapse of banks are working overtime to load up their own bank
accounts this fall. Profiteers are using Y2K pitches to peddle
``survivalist'' products such as guns, gold coins, dehydrated foods
and portable generators.
</P>
<P>
   Not every Y2K doomsayer is motivated by profit. Some sincerely
believe our technologically advanced society is in grave danger
from Y2K and that we should be preparing to live a much simpler way
of life. Still others are hawking Y2K hysteria to advance
ideological causes or fanatical religious beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some of the groups making the most out of the approach
of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   PROFITEERS: These entrepreneurs are selling ordinary products,
but marketing them as something special for Y2K.
</P>
<P>
   In August, Gun World magazine warned that ``every family''
should prepare for Jan. 1 by owning ``at least two rifles.'' The
same month, the American Guardian, a journal of the National Rifle
Association, urged people to stock up on enough ammo to blast away
during ``a few weeks of severe social unrest.'' And Interstate Arms
Corp. of Billerica, Mass., is promoting the ``Y2K Limited Edition
Carbine'' with 30-round magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Makers of gold medallions also are aggressive in exploiting Y2K
anxieties, telling consumers that gold will be the only
``currency'' with value after Jan. 1. Although gold prices have
been languishing at depressed levels, one company has been selling
gold at prices far above market value after stamping pieces of the
metal with images of religious figures.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies are marking up the prices on simple products,
such as flashlights and freeze-dried foods, and marketing them as
``Y2K-guaranteed.'' Some con artists are using Y2K as a way to
trick gullible bank customers into disclosing personal financial
information, such as passwords for ATMs, to help with computer
``testing.''
</P>
<P>
   ARMAGEDDON BELIEVERS: Some fundamentalist Christians are
convinced that Y2K problems will trigger the rise of the Antichrist
and hasten the second coming of Christ. These groups encourage
adherents to stockpile food and water and develop survival skills
to prepare for this extremely turbulent time.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the author of the book ``God's Free Harvest'' urges
Christians to prepare for Y2K by learning to live on acorns and
weeds. His book teaches readers how to ``use cattails for an
outdoor meal'' and ``make coffee from dandelion roots.''
</P>
<P>
   FORMER ``HIPPIES'': Some baby boomers who in their younger days
seriously questioned this country's economic system are now using
Y2K as a means to promote simplicity. Rather than stress the
survivalist approach of stocking up on guns and moving into
bunkers, these groups focus on building a sense of community,
urging people to grow vegetables in neighborhood gardens, can
foods, harness solar power and share other resources.
</P>
<P>
   HATE GROUPS: Some extremist groups believe Y2K could create the
social chaos needed to trigger a ``race war'' that will allow white
Christians to kill Jews, blacks and other minorities. They urge
adherents to use Y2K-related power outages and any subsequent store
lootings as excuses to start shooting.
</P>
<P>
   SURVIVALISTS: Some people taking extreme steps to prepare for
Y2K, such as moving to remote farms with no electrical power, are
not racists, hippies or religious fanatics. They are simply
convinced that Y2K will trigger a cascade of equipment failures
that will cause power plants to crash, water spigots to run dry and
planes to fall from the sky.

 &HT;    'PRUDENCE, NOT PANIC' IS WATCHWORD FOR Y2K PREPARATIONS
 &HT;    With Y2K. Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories
for release Sunday, Sept. 19.
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX

   WASHINGTON _ With little more than 100 days left until the Jan.
1 deadline when computers might malfunction because of the
so-called Y2K bug, experts say individuals must join in the battle.
</P>
<P>
   All Americans can make responsible contingency plans to cope
with difficulties that might arise in early January, according to
Rep. Stephen Horn, R-Calif., chairman of the House Government
Reform subcommittee, which monitors Y2K efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prudence, not panic'' is his motto.
</P>
<P>
   Like most other Y2K experts, Horn says each household should
prepare for possible disruptions in the delivery of electricity,
water, phone service or heat. While utilities and other companies
have made enormous progress in reprogramming computers and chips
embedded in equipment, no one can guarantee there won't be
scattered service breakdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Mainstream experts say Y2K tests show that significant problems
almost certainly can be fixed within 72 hours, so there is no need
for hoarding of water, food or cash. Even worst-case scenarios call
for only two weeks of disruptions.
</P>
<P>
   But while problems are not likely to be long in duration, even
one night without electricity in January can be dangerous unless
contingency plans are in place.
</P>
<P>
   By setting aside some water, fresh batteries, warm blankets and
nutritious foods that need no significant preparation, families can
protect themselves, according to the American Red Cross and other
relief organizations.
</P>
<P>
   And if Jan. 1 does pass quietly, as it will for the great
majority of Americans, then no harm will have been done. Households
with emergency supplies will be better prepared for the next
problem.

MARTIN LAWRENCE: OUT OF A COMA ... AND INTO A THEATER NEAR YOU 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
By BOB STRAUSS 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If you're Martin Lawrence these days, you've got
to be wondering if it's all worth it.
</P>
<P>
   His career long dogged by controversy and contention, the
hyperactive funnyman has recently emerged from an extended downward
spiral. Following a series of highly publicized personal
malfunctions, Lawrence, 34, did some serious self-assessment,
re-established his mental/spiritual equilibrium and got his
professional life back on track.
</P>
<P>
   Having executed a challenging performance in the spring film
release ``Life'' and earning high preview audience marks for the
action comedy ``Blue Streak,'' which opens Friday, Lawrence was in
understandably positive spirits during an Aug. 8 interview.
</P>
<P>
   Little did he know that, two weeks later, he'd be in a
heatstroke-induced coma after jogging in heavy clothes on a
sweltering Westlake Village morning. He was trying to get in shape
for an upcoming movie job _ another comedy, ``Big Momma's House,''
in which he's still scheduled to play a cop who goes undercover as
a grandmother _ doing the conscientious, professional thing.
Lawrence was finally released from the hospital Thursday, 2{ weeks
after his collapse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to keep myself well-conditioned and focused for the
movies,'' Lawrence had said earlier last month, naturally not
expecting those words would take on an ironic ring. But when asked
if fame was a good thing, he also revealed why he might eventually
push himself too hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not all the time, it can be a pain,'' Lawrence answered. ``It
cuts your privacy sometimes, you can't always go where you want.
There's just a lot that comes with it, always being questioned
about your weight, or whatever it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence certainly was in top physical shape for ``Blue
Streak,'' in which he plays a jewel thief masquerading as a police
detective and almost every scene requires him to act out some
demanding bit of body or behavioral humor. The film's makers, in
fact, weren't worried about Lawrence's capacity to perform; they'd
seen his astoundingly energetic work in such feature films as ``Bad
Boys'' and ``Nothing to Lose,'' in his lightning-paced comedy
concert film ``You So Crazy'' and on five seasons of ``Martin,''
the raucous Fox sitcom he created and headlined.
</P>
<P>
   No, they didn't care about the not-even-chubby star's weight.
And if there were concerns from the ``whatever it is'' category,
they were quickly dispelled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Martin was all about the job _ he was ready. He was physically
in great shape; I would sign up for another film with him in a
second,'' said ``Blue Streak'' director Les Mayfield, adding that
Lawrence's winning screen personality went a long way toward making
the movie's criminal protagonist palatable. ``He brings to this
film an inherent level of charm; he has a smile that's so
disarming, it lets him get away with anything.''
</P>
<P>
   That hasn't always been the case when the cameras aren't
running. Sure, Lawrence's irrepressible impishness has served him
well since childhood. He'd use it to cheer up his two-job-working
mom (who supported her six children after her military-man husband
walked out). He got one teacher to actually give him the last five
minutes of class to test out his comedy routines (though she
threatened detention if he wasn't funny). He worked his way out of
a Maryland housing project on dirty jokes and that smile, rising
through the D.C.-area club circuit to a key appearance on ``Star
Search'' to a star-making hosting gig on ``Russell Simmons' Def
Comedy Jam.''
</P>
<P>
   But once Mr. You So Crazy actually went kind of nuts, the only
solution was to go more than grin deep.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no choice, at this point, but to keep my head up and to
keep my focus on what I do,'' said Lawrence, who in the mid-'90s
saw a short marriage fail, was arrested several times (including a
1996 incident that involved running across Ventura Boulevard
screaming at passing motorists), and was accused of sexual
harassment by ``Martin'' co-star Tisha Campbell. ``I've spent the
last two years just getting myself back together, my life in order
and learning to understand that you can have trying times like that
in your life, but that doesn't mean that you can't pick yourself
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence credited his new-found stability to the usual good
influences. But he acknowledged that, when it came down to it, only
he could be responsible for changing himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``My will, my strength, my wanting to grow, my faith in God and
truly believing in it'' are what he says helped him straighten out.
``Sometimes you get so jaded and cloudy, there's no room for those
things. But through God's grace, I was able to find that again, and
I could hear my family talking to me and my friends trying to
uplift me, even when they were just saying that I didn't want to
get up.''
</P>
<P>
   There were other things worth living life right for, high among
them Jasmin, the 3-year-old daughter he tries not to spoil.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has a lot of things, so she let's me know what she wants,
but I try to pace it,'' he says of the girl who's being raised in
drastically different circumstances than he was. ``It's most
definitely different, but I look at it as truly a blessing. I know
that. So that's what allows me to work as hard as I do. It's all to
make a better way for her. I thank God for helping me to be in a
position to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Lawrence harbored no delusions that life could
suddenly be perfect. He's still wary of commitment after the
disastrous marriage to Jasmin's mother, former Miss Virginia
Patricia Southall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a special friend, but I'm just living right now,'' he
said, cryptically yet revealingly. ``There's no date things going
on. I won't be seeing no altars or no wedding cake _ none of
that.''
</P>
<P>
   And even though things were looking good on the career front,
Lawrence noted that several television projects he wanted to
produce were going nowhere _ an outgrowth, he reckoned, of the
networks' widely criticized turn away from ethnically diverse
programming.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a problem, period,'' he said. ``There's no
opportunity to show the diverse talent out here, amongst people,
when you just deal with white shows. That's not the norm out here,
or what America has been heading for for a long time. There should
be more minorities of whatever color; that's why we have so many
different channels, so you should be able to put on whatever you
want.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, not just any old program of color.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have to be good shows,'' he cautioned. ``If they're
comedies, they have to be funny _ I ain't talking about just
putting some bull on. I'm talking about stuff that makes sense, but
you've got to give them that opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Lawrence's own sitcom was often praised as a generally
positive look at young urban professionals, its raw (for the
mid-'90s, anyway) humor brought criticism from some segments of the
African-American community, most notably Bill Cosby.
</P>
<P>
   But despite maintaining a bad-boy attitude when the subject of
media censorship came up _ ``You see more violence in a supermarket
(than in films), depending on which supermarket you're in'' was one
dubious stance _ Lawrence wanted to make sure that playing a
crook-turned-cop in ``Blue Streak'' did not send the wrong message.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not cool to be a criminal, period,'' he said. ``I think
this guy is a likable, good-natured person who just happened to
choose the wrong line of work. I think, when they see the movie,
people are gonna be going, `Why do you think you have to be a thief
when you seem like such a nice guy?'''
</P>
<P>
   Like everything about his life in show business, concern about
the image he projects is one more pressure Martin Lawrence is
constantly forced to deal with. He was asked if he ever considered
giving up the struggle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably did at some point,'' he figured, ``when contracts
don't go right and movies are not coming in where you want, or
television series are not coming in where you want. I think every
entertainer in this business goes through that. It's just a matter
of your patience and your understanding of how to maximize your
time off, when you are away from things. It's constantly learning
how to grow; that's what's going to better you and strengthen you
in this business.''
</P>
<P>
   And even after his most recent setback, it's hard to imagine
that Lawrence would give up that growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I think you always have pressures,'' he says. ``This is
just such a big industry, a major industry, and it's been going on
since the end of time. So yeah, it puts pressure on you. But that's
part of growing, is learning how to deal with those pressures,
having the right outlets and all that.'' &QL;

CALIFORNIA ANGLERS FACE NEW RESTRICTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TOM STIENSTRA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ What if you went to a doctor about a headache,
and to your surprise, the doctor ordered more studies. Then, the
next day, you woke up and found that your right arm had been
amputated?
</P>
<P>
   Makes no sense, right?
</P>
<P>
   That is exactly what the fish doctor is proposing in California.
</P>
<P>
   While rockfish and lingcod populations are under siege from
overfishing by commercial netters and longliners, the state
Department of Fish and Game is proposing that the sport limit be
dropped from 15 to 10, and the limit perhaps to zero for lingcod
and bocaccio.
</P>
<P>
   According to one insider with the DFG, the proposal may be
changed in the next month to reduce the rockfish limit for sport
anglers to as low as four.
</P>
<P>
   It's like cutting off your arm because you have a headache.
</P>
<P>
   The headache is the overfishing by the commercial fleet,
comprised of longliners that use fishing lines miles long with
5,000 to 6,000 hooks, and drag boats that tow giant nets like
vacuum cleaners through the fishing grounds. They not only dominate
the coastal fishery, but with their sole mission to turn fish into
cash, are out to kill every fish they can get their mitts on.
</P>
<P>
   The right arm is the sport fishing public, whose desire is to
maintain abundant, healthy fisheries, and who pay for resource
management through license and tag fees, as well as special taxes
on equipment. They wish never to harm a fishery, but like a
comfortable bank account, to take only the interest and never cut
into the capital.
</P>
<P>
   But the draggers and longliners are breaking the bank.
</P>
<P>
   According to one report, 87 percent of the coastal rockfish
catch is taken commercially, 13 percent by sport anglers.
</P>
<P>
   According to another, a single commercial boat with a drag net
catches more bocaccio than the entire sport fleet in California.
</P>
<P>
   In another, longliners hook and kill unbelievable thousands of
juvenile fish, that is, fish that never have a chance to spawn.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the science is not available to document the status of
rockfish on the California coast. According to the Monterey office
of the DFG, of 50 rockfish species in the ocean, 43 are listed as
``status unknown,'' which means that not a single federal or state
scientist has a clue what's going on out there. The first rule of
wildlife management is to have a species census, from which you can
track population gains and declines, and identify limiting factors.
</P>
<P>
   So where is this proposal coming from? It's coming from Oregon.
The Pacific Fisheries Management Council is using data from Oregon
for lingcod and bocaccio as a model for rockfish on the California
coast. From that model, they have determined the rockfish limits
for sport anglers need to be drastically cut in California.
</P>
<P>
   That's how the fish doctor has done it. Can you imagine any
other doctor working like this?
</P>
<P>
   As word has circulated about this proposal, the DFG has just
started getting hammered for it. So much so that a special meeting
has just been scheduled by the Fish and Game Commission for Oct. 20
in Sacramento, to allow public comment and review of the entire
proposal. In addition, by then the latest data from Oregon is
supposed to be available. Like, wow.
</P>
<P>
   To provide your comment to the Fish and Game Commission, send an
e-mail to rtreanor(at)dfg.ca.gov or write to the Fish &AMP; Game
Commission, Room 1320, 1416 Ninth Street, Sacramento, CA 95814.

 By WILLIAM K. STEVENS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   On a plate, where most people encounter them, all Atlantic
salmon are pretty much alike: orange-pink fillets or steaks that
melt in the mouth when baked, broiled, grilled or poached, or when
smoked and combined with an onion slice and cream cheese on a
bagel.
</P>
<P>
   But alive, in their North Atlantic habitat, salmon today come in
two basic varieties, farm-bred and wild. The wild fish are sleek,
silvery torpedoes that range from one side of the ocean to the
other and whose beauty, heart and acrobatic grace have earned them
a reputation as the aristocrat of aristocrats among game fish. The
farm fish spend cramped lives in ocean pens just off the shorelines
of North America, Europe and Chile. Comparatively short and fat,
often with fins frayed or eroded as a result of close confinement,
they are a marine equivalent of domesticated cattle.
</P>
<P>
   The odds are overwhelming that what a diner encounters is a farm
fish, and that fact reflects a striking reversal: wild salmon, once
abundant, are now outnumbered by their domesticated cousins at
least 50 to 1, and probably more.
</P>
<P>
   According to recent estimates, the wild salmon population is in
what appears to be an accelerating downward spiral; the number that
are returning to spawn in their native streams has plummeted to
what some scientists say is an all-time low. ``Something terrible
is happening in the ocean,'' said Bill Taylor, the president of the
Atlantic Salmon Federation.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly worrisome is a plunge in key brood stocks. These
are the older, bigger, egg-rich fish on which the now-cloudy future
of the species in the wild mostly depends. Historically, it is
estimated, there were 2.5 million to 5 million of these brood
salmon migrating between ocean feeding grounds and North American
spawning rivers. By the mid-1970s, that figure had shrunk to
800,000; by 1991, to about 300,000; by 1996, to a little more than
125,000, and last year to about 80,000.
</P>
<P>
   What is going on is far bigger than the familiar near-demise of
wild Atlantic salmon in the northeastern United States. Fewer than
300 of these prized fish return each year to the nine New England
spawning streams that still attract them, all in Maine, and
conservationists have recently sued to bring them under the
protection of the Endangered Species Act. But now the decline also
appears to have accelerated throughout the North Atlantic basin at
large. Some experts, like Dr. Carl Safina, a marine biologist with
the National Audubon Society, say that ``tailspin'' is not too
strong a description of the situation.
</P>
<P>
   Just three years ago, for instance, more than 200,000 salmon of
varying ages returned to spawn in the Miramichi River of New
Brunswick, a world-famous sport fishing stream that has been North
America's biggest single salmon producer. From 1992 through 1996,
the Miramichi averaged about 112,000 returns a year. Then, in 1997
and 1998, the number dropped to a little more than 40,000. The
count for 1999 is not yet in, since much of the spawning run takes
place in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   While some experts suspect there might be a relationship between
the rise of farmed salmon and the decline of wild ones, others
doubt that this is driving the decline in the wild. And in fact,
the general feeling among scientists is that the cause or causes of
the wild salmon crash are unknown; it is as if they are
disappearing into some ecological black hole.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, scientists say, is not that too few salmon are
being hatched in the wild. While many spawning rivers have been
ruined by pollution, dams and silty runoff from farms and cut-over
forests, experts say that there is still enough freshwater habitat
on both sides of the Atlantic to produce reasonable numbers of
young fish. But it appears that once in the ocean, proportionately
fewer of these salmon are surviving to return to their natal rivers
when it is their turn to reproduce.
</P>
<P>
   Commercial fishing that began in the 1960s has commonly been
blamed for the longer-term decline. But fishing off North America
and Greenland, in the area where salmon of North American origin
congregate at sea, has been halted by international agreement, and
yet North American salmon are still disappearing. On the Miramichi,
only about 1 percent of the young, first-year fish that go to sea
return to spawn, according to the Atlantic Salmon Federation, an
international nonprofit conservation group based in St. Andrews,
New Brunswick. Ten to 15 years ago, 6 percent to 12 percent
returned _ at a time when large-scale commercial fisheries were
taking wild salmon wholesale.
</P>
<P>
   Many things, including natural factors, could bring on a
population crash by breaking the salmon's classic life-cycle chain.
Among possible causes being investigated are a changing climate
that alters water temperature; competition, genetic weakening and
disease transmission from escaped farm fish, and increased killing
of salmon by seals and other predators.
</P>
<P>
   But ``we don't actually have an answer to what the problem is,''
said Dr. Malcolm Windsor, the executive secretary of the North
Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organization, established in 1984 to
execute a conservation treaty signed by the region's countries. The
organization is based in Edinburgh, Scotland.

GOLF WEB SITE RAISES CREDIBILITY ISSUES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SUSAN FORNOFF  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ If your favorite local newspaper suddenly
partnered up with your favorite local sports team, you'd have a few
things to worry about.
</P>
<P>
   Like, ``Where will I be able to read about the other local
sports teams? Won't they play second fiddle?'' And, ``What's going
to happen to my newspaper's objectivity? Will the writers still be
critical when it's called for?''
</P>
<P>
   That's the new predicament at GolfWeb, which has been leading
the Internet in golf coverage but has now formed an alliance with
PGATour.com, the PGA Tour's own site. GolfWeb's green theme has
given way to a cluttered new blue look as executives _ and users _
struggle with the new concept.
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether GolfWeb would still be able to produce its
usual honest and sometimes biting commentary, executive editor Stu
Schneider said, ``Um. Well. No. But ...''
</P>
<P>
   And when asked which organization would have the last word on
content, PGATour.com managing editor Helen Ross said, ``I would say
we do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still using the same columnists,'' said Ross, who had a
20-year career in newspapers. ``And we're trying to take the best
parts of both Web sites and combine them. Yes, we're going to have
some input, but we've talked about a lot of ways to address issues,
such as point-counterpoint, pro-con formats.''
</P>
<P>
   Schneider said the reason for the alliance is simple and mutual:
``More reach.''
</P>
<P>
   GolfWeb is part of Sportsline USA, which has been battling ESPN
for the Internet sports traffic. July marked the first time
Sportsline USA moved ahead of ESPN in the Media Metrix traffic and
reach report, ranking 35th among all Web sites (just between Ask
Jeeves and Preview Travel).
</P>
<P>
   Further research showed that people go to GolfWeb for scores,
shopping, the course guide and the classified advertising, while
people visit PGATour.com primarily for its real-time tournament
scoring.
</P>
<P>
   So the new alliance will offer week-round content for
PGATour.com users.
</P>
<P>
   The odd man out in this venture is female: The LPGA Tour
received prominent coverage on GolfWeb, which did not automatically
assign second-class citizenship to the women.
</P>
<P>
   Placement was a matter of the news of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the PGA Tour and its partners, the Senior Tour and Nike
Tour, have clear first billing over the LPGA Tour, which hasn't yet
snuggled into these sheets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still running stories on the LPGA and we're still going
to have people at LPGA events,'' Ross said. ``It's differently
placed, but the information is still there. We want to be one-stop
shopping for golf.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether the site can be one-stop shopping for golf news, though,
remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is all so new, it's still hard to say how it's going to
work,'' Schneider said. ``But the tour has said it's not going to
stand in the way if we report the facts.''

<P>
   The Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar, appeared in the seas tens of
millions of years ago, and for about the last 10,000 years, since
the end of the last ice age, their range has spanned the North
Atlantic. Young, six-inch-long first-year salmon, called by the old
Anglo-Saxon name of smolts, migrate to two main oceanic feeding
areas from their home streams in New England, eastern Canada and
Iceland, and from rivers distributed along Europe's coast from
Russia's Kola Peninsula through Scandinavia, and the British Isles
to Spain. Those from North America head for an open-ocean region
between southwestern Greenland and northern Canada. European fish
make for waters around the Faroe Islands, north of Scotland
(although many also swim all the way across the ocean to
Greenland.)
</P>
<P>
   In their feeding grounds, they fatten up on prey like sand eels
and capelin, small smelt-like fish. After a year of this, many
return to the rivers of their birth to spawn. These first-year
returners, called grilse, typically weigh about five pounds. They
are predominantly male, and the females produce relatively few
eggs. Other fish avoid spawning as grilse, instead staying on the
feeding grounds for two or three years and earning the full
designation of salmon. These grow to 10 pounds to 20 pounds or more
and include many more females, each of which carries many more eggs
than grilse do. They are the precious brood stock.
</P>
<P>
   According to surveys taken by temporarily trapping fish as they
ascend the rivers, fisheries scientists have been able to calculate
present-day populations of breeders. The Miramichi is an important
barometer. From 1991 through 1996, according to the salmon
federation, an average of more than 31,000 brood fish ascended the
river each year. That number dropped to 18,442 in 1997 and to a
mere 9,500 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Biologists estimate that the total population of salmon of North
American origin has dropped to fewer than 500,000 from about 1.5
million over the last 30 years. Based on sparser and therefore more
uncertain data, salmon of European origin are estimated to have
decreased to about 3.5 million from about 6 million over the same
period. Estimates vary widely; these are in the mid-range. But it
seems clear, Taylor said, that apart from exceptions like the Kola
Peninsula and Iceland, ``there is not very much good news.''
</P>
<P>
   While the number of salmon returning to spawn in their native
rivers is the lowest on record, Dr. Windsor said, it is not clear
whether it is the lowest ever; records have been kept only since
1960. ``But,'' he said, ``one has the feeling that things are not
good for the salmon.''
</P>
<P>
   Fish populations, like those of almost all creatures, fluctuate
naturally, but scientists say that several new factors might be
having an impact on wild salmon. One, conservationists say, might
be the impact of farm fish on wild ones. While no one has any solid
numbers, estimates of the number of farmed Atlantic salmon off
Europe, eastern Canada, Maine, the Pacific coast of North America
and Chile run from 100 million to 200 million each year.
</P>
<P>
   The potential threat to wild salmon posed by farmed ones is said
to be threefold. First, it is argued, the farm fish are bred for
selected characteristics like growth rate and tameness, and this
could make them less genetically diverse and so less suited for
survival in the wild. The concern is that when they escape and
breed with wild fish, they may reduce the ability of the offspring
to survive.
</P>
<P>
   Surveys on the Magaguadavic River in southern New Brunswick have
found that fish escaped from offshore farm pens outnumbered wild
ones by up to eight to one, and Windsor said large numbers had
escaped in Europe. Experts say they have no difficulty
distinguishing the two varieties. The farm fish ``looks like a
football as opposed to a sleek, well-tuned muscular fish,'' Taylor
said.
</P>
<P>
   Second, farm fish may compete with wild ones for habitat and
food. Third, diseases and parasites are said to flourish in salmon
farm pens, and these may be transmitted to wild fish. Two parasites
in particular, tiny brown sea lice and a microscopic organism
called Gyrodactylus salaris, literally cover salmon and kill them
by eating their flesh. Norway has had to poison all life in some of
its salmon rivers to get rid of sea lice.
</P>
<P>
   In North America, aquaculture interests say that while some farm
fish may escape their pens, there is no evidence of any effect on
wild salmon. ``There's no proven impact,'' said Dr. Brian Glebe, a
salmon breeder for the aquaculture industry based in St. Andrews,
whose enterprise is overseen jointly by conservationists,
aquaculturists and the government. Moreover, he said, there are no
pens anywhere near many important salmon rivers like the Miramichi.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor of the salmon federation insisted, ``We're not
anti-aquaculture.'' But, he said, the farm fish needed to be better
contained. He also said they could be neutered so they did not pass
on their genes to wild fish, noting, ``The technology exists.''
Salmon farming might also be relocated to land-based sites, Windsor
said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the concern over aquaculture, some experts believe that
climatic change may be a better candidate as the primary driver of
the decline in wild salmon. Over the period of the decline, the
North Atlantic has been dominated by a natural climatic regime in
which sea-surface temperatures have been unusually warm. The North
Atlantic seas alternate over decades between generally cooler and
warmer states. In the warmer phase, Windsor said, colder water from
melting ice in Greenland may cause the temperature in the oceanic
salmon feeding grounds to drop below levels that salmon can
tolerate.
</P>
<P>
   Some scientists believe that a general warming of the atmosphere
may have brought about changes in atmospheric circulation that make
the warmer phase of the North Atlantic temperature oscillation
appear more frequently, but this has not been established.
</P>
<P>
   Another possibility is that salmon predators like seabirds and
seals have increased. Gray seals in the salmon region are indeed
increasing by about 8 percent a year, Windsor said. Why? ``Brigitte
Bardot,'' he answered. Miss Bardot, a former actress from France,
is a leading animal-rights advocate who has strongly opposed the
hunting of seals.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to solve the salmon mystery, scientists have begun
attaching tiny radio transmitters to smolts migrating out of their
birth rivers. By tracking them, they hope to learn their fate.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Windsor said, that fate may well turn out to have
been shaped in one way or another by human activity. With salmon
and people, he said, ``my guess is that the two of us don't go
together awfully well.''

MARTIN LAWRENCE: OUT OF A COMA ... AND INTO A THEATER NEAR YOU  
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
By BOB STRAUSS 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If you're Martin Lawrence these days, you've got
to be wondering if it's all worth it.
</P>
<P>
   His career long dogged by controversy and contention, the
hyperactive funnyman has recently emerged from an extended downward
spiral. Following a series of highly publicized personal
malfunctions, Lawrence, 34, did some serious self-assessment,
re-established his mental/spiritual equilibrium and got his
professional life back on track.
</P>
<P>
   Having executed a challenging performance in the spring film
release ``Life'' and earning high preview audience marks for the
action comedy ``Blue Streak,'' which opens Friday, Lawrence was in
understandably positive spirits during an Aug. 8 interview.
</P>
<P>
   Little did he know that, two weeks later, he'd be in a
heatstroke-induced coma after jogging in heavy clothes on a
sweltering Westlake Village morning. He was trying to get in shape
for an upcoming movie job _ another comedy, ``Big Momma's House,''
in which he's still scheduled to play a cop who goes undercover as
a grandmother _ doing the conscientious, professional thing.
Lawrence was finally released from the hospital Thursday, 2{ weeks
after his collapse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to keep myself well-conditioned and focused for the
movies,'' Lawrence had said earlier last month, naturally not
expecting those words would take on an ironic ring. But when asked
if fame was a good thing, he also revealed why he might eventually
push himself too hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not all the time, it can be a pain,'' Lawrence answered. ``It
cuts your privacy sometimes, you can't always go where you want.
There's just a lot that comes with it, always being questioned
about your weight, or whatever it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence certainly was in top physical shape for ``Blue
Streak,'' in which he plays a jewel thief masquerading as a police
detective and almost every scene requires him to act out some
demanding bit of body or behavioral humor. The film's makers, in
fact, weren't worried about Lawrence's capacity to perform; they'd
seen his astoundingly energetic work in such feature films as ``Bad
Boys'' and ``Nothing to Lose,'' in his lightning-paced comedy
concert film ``You So Crazy'' and on five seasons of ``Martin,''
the raucous Fox sitcom he created and headlined.
</P>
<P>
   No, they didn't care about the not-even-chubby star's weight.
And if there were concerns from the ``whatever it is'' category,
they were quickly dispelled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Martin was all about the job _ he was ready. He was physically
in great shape; I would sign up for another film with him in a
second,'' said ``Blue Streak'' director Les Mayfield, adding that
Lawrence's winning screen personality went a long way toward making
the movie's criminal protagonist palatable. ``He brings to this
film an inherent level of charm; he has a smile that's so
disarming, it lets him get away with anything.''
</P>
<P>
   That hasn't always been the case when the cameras aren't
running. Sure, Lawrence's irrepressible impishness has served him
well since childhood. He'd use it to cheer up his two-job-working
mom (who supported her six children after her military-man husband
walked out). He got one teacher to actually give him the last five
minutes of class to test out his comedy routines (though she
threatened detention if he wasn't funny). He worked his way out of
a Maryland housing project on dirty jokes and that smile, rising
through the D.C.-area club circuit to a key appearance on ``Star
Search'' to a star-making hosting gig on ``Russell Simmons' Def
Comedy Jam.''
</P>
<P>
   But once Mr. You So Crazy actually went kind of nuts, the only
solution was to go more than grin deep.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no choice, at this point, but to keep my head up and to
keep my focus on what I do,'' said Lawrence, who in the mid-'90s
saw a short marriage fail, was arrested several times (including a
1996 incident that involved running across Ventura Boulevard
screaming at passing motorists), and was accused of sexual
harassment by ``Martin'' co-star Tisha Campbell. ``I've spent the
last two years just getting myself back together, my life in order
and learning to understand that you can have trying times like that
in your life, but that doesn't mean that you can't pick yourself
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence credited his new-found stability to the usual good
influences. But he acknowledged that, when it came down to it, only
he could be responsible for changing himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``My will, my strength, my wanting to grow, my faith in God and
truly believing in it'' are what he says helped him straighten out.
``Sometimes you get so jaded and cloudy, there's no room for those
things. But through God's grace, I was able to find that again, and
I could hear my family talking to me and my friends trying to
uplift me, even when they were just saying that I didn't want to
get up.''
</P>
<P>
   There were other things worth living life right for, high among
them Jasmin, the 3-year-old daughter he tries not to spoil.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has a lot of things, so she let's me know what she wants,
but I try to pace it,'' he says of the girl who's being raised in
drastically different circumstances than he was. ``It's most
definitely different, but I look at it as truly a blessing. I know
that. So that's what allows me to work as hard as I do. It's all to
make a better way for her. I thank God for helping me to be in a
position to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Lawrence harbored no delusions that life could
suddenly be perfect. He's still wary of commitment after the
disastrous marriage to Jasmin's mother, former Miss Virginia
Patricia Southall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a special friend, but I'm just living right now,'' he
said, cryptically yet revealingly. ``There's no date things going
on. I won't be seeing no altars or no wedding cake _ none of
that.''
</P>
<P>
   And even though things were looking good on the career front,
Lawrence noted that several television projects he wanted to
produce were going nowhere _ an outgrowth, he reckoned, of the
networks' widely criticized turn away from ethnically diverse
programming.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a problem, period,'' he said. ``There's no
opportunity to show the diverse talent out here, amongst people,
when you just deal with white shows. That's not the norm out here,
or what America has been heading for for a long time. There should
be more minorities of whatever color; that's why we have so many
different channels, so you should be able to put on whatever you
want.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, not just any old program of color.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have to be good shows,'' he cautioned. ``If they're
comedies, they have to be funny _ I ain't talking about just
putting some bull on. I'm talking about stuff that makes sense, but
you've got to give them that opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Lawrence's own sitcom was often praised as a generally
positive look at young urban professionals, its raw (for the
mid-'90s, anyway) humor brought criticism from some segments of the
African-American community, most notably Bill Cosby.
</P>
<P>
   But despite maintaining a bad-boy attitude when the subject of
media censorship came up _ ``You see more violence in a supermarket
(than in films), depending on which supermarket you're in'' was one
dubious stance _ Lawrence wanted to make sure that playing a
crook-turned-cop in ``Blue Streak'' did not send the wrong message.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not cool to be a criminal, period,'' he said. ``I think
this guy is a likable, good-natured person who just happened to
choose the wrong line of work. I think, when they see the movie,
people are gonna be going, `Why do you think you have to be a thief
when you seem like such a nice guy?'''
</P>
<P>
   Like everything about his life in show business, concern about
the image he projects is one more pressure Martin Lawrence is
constantly forced to deal with. He was asked if he ever considered
giving up the struggle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably did at some point,'' he figured, ``when contracts
don't go right and movies are not coming in where you want, or
television series are not coming in where you want. I think every
entertainer in this business goes through that. It's just a matter
of your patience and your understanding of how to maximize your
time off, when you are away from things. It's constantly learning
how to grow; that's what's going to better you and strengthen you
in this business.''
</P>
<P>
   And even after his most recent setback, it's hard to imagine
that Lawrence would give up that growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I think you always have pressures,'' he says. ``This is
just such a big industry, a major industry, and it's been going on
since the end of time. So yeah, it puts pressure on you. But that's
part of growing, is learning how to deal with those pressures,
having the right outlets and all that.'' &QL;

SICKLE CELL GROUP URGES AGGRESSIVE PAIN CONTROL 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
 (af)  
 By WARREN E. LEARY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ Patients with the agonizing and intractable pain of
sickle cell disease should get better, more consistent relief
because of new treatment guidelines that call for comprehensive
management of the pain, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   The guidelines, intended for doctors, nurses and other health
professionals who treat sickle cell disease, call for aggressive
use of drugs along with behavioral, psychological and physical
therapies to relieve patients' suffering.
</P>
<P>
   The recommendations, issued here Friday at the annual meeting of
the Sickle Cell Disease Association of America, reflect growing
attention to the importance of relieving pain, not just in sickle
cell disease but throughout medicine. Drafted by an expert panel
sponsored by the American Pain Society, a national organization of
medical specialists, the guidelines are the first in a series of
research-based recommendations for treating pain in several
diseases, including arthritis and cancer.
</P>
<P>
   But pain is different in sickle cell patients, because it can
start when they are a few months old and persist, off and on, for
life. ``A lifetime of unpredictable, recurrent, intense, and
frequently persistent pain experiences and the accompanying
recurring and necessary use of opioids make pain related to sickle
cell disease unique among pain syndromes,'' the guidelines say.
Opioid means narcotic.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Lennette J. Benjamin, clinical director of the Comprehensive
Sickle Cell Center at Montefiore Medical Center in Bronx, N.Y., and
a member of the drafting panel, said, ``This is the first national
guideline to treat acute and chronic sickle cell pain, and we will
push to have it adopted by everyone treating sickle cell
patients.''
</P>
<P>
   Pain is the primary reason sickle cell patients seek hospital
care, Dr. Benjamin said, adding that these patients traditionally
are not given enough medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see patients every day who have suffered a lifetime of
needless pain simply because their doctors and others treating them
don't understand or practice the principles of good pain
management,'' she said. ``Unrelieved pain leads to longer
hospitalizations, greater suffering and complications and more
deaths.''
</P>
<P>
   Sickle cell disease encompasses a group of inherited blood
disorders that afflict primarily people with ancestors from Africa,
the Mediterranean and India. In this country, an estimated 80,000
people, mainly from African-American, Caribbean and
African-Hispanic backgrounds, have the disease, and about 8 percent
of blacks carry a genetic tendency for it.
</P>
<P>
   With the disease, the body produces abnormal forms of
hemoglobin, the oxygen-carrying protein of red blood cells.
Sometimes this hemoglobin forms rigid crystalline structures that
cause the normally pliable blood cells to stiffen and contort into
jagged, sickle shapes.
</P>
<P>
   These cells then block small blood vessels and cause vascular
inflammation that inhibits blood flow to organs, resulting in cell
death or damage.
</P>
<P>
   These episodes can result in bouts of acute pain, called crises,
that often affect the chest, back, abdomen, joints and extremities,
and are described by patients as being worse than the anguish of
cancer or childbirth. In addition to crises that can last hours or
days, some patients suffer with chronic, but less severe pain that
can last months or longer because of bone or organ damage.
</P>
<P>
   The pain society's panel, which included experts in sickle cell
disease, pain, medicine, nursing and psychology as well as a
patient representative, took two years to draft the guidelines,
consulting experts and examining published studies on sickle pain.

<P>
   A draft report underwent peer review by 61 experts, and a
revision was evaluated at 10 hospitals or medical practices that
did not have sickle cell programs to see if the recommendations
were clear, useful and practical, even to nonexperts.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say there are a number of barriers to effective
treatment of sickle cell pain: inadequate knowledge of the
condition and of pain management in general; the variability and
unpredictability of episodes of the disease; skepticism among some
doctors that patients are as miserable as they say they are, and an
unfounded fear that pain medication will lead to addiction.
</P>
<P>
   The panel said that pain assessment was a key part of treatment
and that health workers should rely on patients' reports of
discomfort as the primary source of this evaluation.
</P>
<P>
   The recommendations also call for aggressive use of painkilling
drugs for acute and chronic episodes, starting with aspirin or
acetaminophen and moving to opioid medicine if needed. The
guidelines include a detailed regimen of doses for many
painkillers, and they call for detailed monitoring of any adverse
side effects.
</P>
<P>
   They also include step-by-step procedures for looking for
underlying causes of pain and moving patients through varying
options for treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Among those options are behavioral approaches, including
relaxation therapy, meditation and biofeedback exercises;
psychological methods like counseling, support groups and hypnosis,
and physical treatments, including massage, acupuncture, heat and
administering intravenous fluids to improve blood flow.
</P>
<P>
   The American Pain Society said it planned to distribute copies
of the guidelines to its 5,000 members and provide them to sickle
cell treatment centers nationwide. Others may order copies for $15,
not including shipping, by calling (847) 375-4715 or through the
organization's Web site (www.ampainsoc.org/).

STEAMING KETTLES  
 DRAGONFLY FLIGHTS

   Q. &UR; Why do I see more steam when I take the teakettle off the
flame? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A. The ``steam'' you see is what steam engine enthusiasts call
wet steam, because it contains unevaporated water as a mist within
the actual water vapor, which is a colorless, odorless gas. Dry
steam does not contain any unevaporated water.
</P>
<P>
   Steam vapor forms at temperatures above the boiling point,
normally 212 degrees Fahrenheit. Visible steam is either water that
is not yet hot enough to form this vapor or, in the case of your
kettle, water that has cooled slightly into water droplets.
</P>
<P>
   When a whistling teakettle is taken off the heat, the whistle
gets weaker, because the pressure of the water vapor drops as the
heat drops, although the visible water droplets momentarily
increase.
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have seen dragonflies that appear to be dipping their
abdomens, not their mouth parts, into the water. What are they
doing?
</P>
<P>
   A. You may have observed female dragonflies depositing their
fertilized eggs into the water, where they will hatch into larvae.
The eggs are sometimes inserted into underwater plant stems and
sometimes smeared onto the surface of the water.
</P>
<P>
   More than 300 eggs may be laid at one time. Sometimes several
hundred females lay their eggs in the same spot, producing large
egg masses up to two feet across.

   As the fall soccer season begins, legions of schoolchildren are
taking to the fields with images of the United States women's
team's stunning World Cup victory still fresh in their minds. But
many doctors have other matters on their minds: how to make soccer
safer for children in light of recent reports linking it to
repeated concussions and diminished mental functioning.
</P>
<P>
   A central question surrounds the practice of heading _ hitting
the ball with the head. In a two-year study of 60 soccer players
ages 11 to 14 in Ann Arbor, Mich., Dr. David Janda, an orthopedic
surgeon, found that nearly half had symptoms of concussion _
blurred or double vision, headaches, nausea and ringing in the
ears. The symptoms were most common in the children who headed the
ball most often, Janda said.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the second year, the children with repeated
symptoms did slightly worse than a control group of children on
neurological tests of memory and information processing, said
Janda, who has submitted his study for publication.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we think happens is that kids first start to experience
concussive symptoms, and then as the amount of heading goes up
their information processing and memory diminish,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Janda's conclusion is similar to that of a report in the current
issue of The Journal of the American Medical Association, in which
researchers in the Netherlands compared the brain functions of 33
adult amateur soccer players with 27 other athletes, like runners
and swimmers. Thirteen of the 33 soccer players had an impaired
performance on tasks requiring planning, and nine had memory
impairments, rates three times those of the other athletes. The
more concussions a player had suffered, the lower the score on the
neurological tests.
</P>
<P>
   While experts agree that repeated concussions can cause
permanent brain damage and even death, they disagree over the role
of heading. In a second study in The Journal of the American
Medical Association, Dr. John W. Powell, an assistant professor of
kinesiology at Michigan State University, found that most of the
concussions of high school soccer players occurred when players
collided or fell while trying to head a ball. Powell said more
research was needed to determine whether heading itself was
dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   There is also disagreement over when heading should be taught.
Doug Semark, executive director of the American Youth Soccer
Organization, recommends that coaches not teach heading to players
younger than 12 because their necks may not be strong enough to
remain steady during a blow to the head and protect the brain from
movement and injury.
</P>
<P>
   But Semark says many coaches disregard such recommendations. ``I
have witnessed on more occasions than I could count well-meaning
soccer coaches extolling heading as one of the great things you can
do even with 5- to 7-year-olds,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Semark also said his organization, which oversees about 20
percent to 25 percent of the country's youth soccer leagues, had
been under pressure from parents to teach heading to younger
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``We frequently hear complaints from parents that coaches aren't
teaching heading and therefore their kids are being denied the full
benefit of participation in soccer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Heading aside, there are things parents, coaches and trainers
can do to protect young athletes from head injuries and
neurological damage.
</P>
<P>
   Guidelines issued last May by the Federal Consumer Product
Safety Commission say soccer goals should be securely anchored so
they do not tip over. The commission found that 23 deaths and 38
serious injuries have occurred since 1979 from soccer goals falling
on children.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the American Academy of Neurology recommends that
any player who suffers a blow to the head be evaluated immediately
for possible concussion. Players with mild symptoms, like confusion
but no loss of consciousness, may return to the game if symptoms go
away within 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, they should not play or practice until they are free
of symptoms for one week, since the greatest risk of brain injury
comes from getting a second concussion before the first one has
healed.  &QL;

2 RECENT EARTHQUAKES UNRELATED

<TEXT>
<P>
   For anyone who believes that airplane crashes and other
disasters come in bunches, the earthquake that struck Athens on
Tuesday, just three weeks after a major tremor about 400 miles away
in Turkey, provided plenty of grist for debate.
</P>
<P>
   But seismologists say there is no connection between the Athens
quake, which measured 5.9 on the Richter scale and killed at least
83 people, and the one in Turkey, which was centered near the city
of Izmit, measured 7.4 and killed more than 15,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no reason to think that the stress put on the end of
the fault in Turkey would be felt in Greece,'' said Dr. Tom Holzer,
an engineering geologist at the United States Geological Survey in
Menlo Park, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The two quakes occurred on faults of different types. The North
Anatolian fault responsible for the Turkish quake is of the
strike-slip type, in which the earth moves laterally. The Greek
tremor occurred on what geologists call a normal fault, where the
movement is primarily vertical.
</P>
<P>
   Holzer noted that the Turkish quake was 175 times as powerful as
the Greek one, and that there was really no comparison between the
two. ``It's like fog and hail,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There is also no reason to believe that earthquakes are
occurring unusually often. The Greek tremor was classified as a
moderate quake, and about 1,200 of them occur annually worldwide.
Through August of this year, fewer than 600 such quakes had been
recorded.  &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ In an effort to replenish the thinning ranks of the
armed forces, the Pentagon and Congress are looking at everything
from slick advertising to improved pay and benefits to a revival of
the draft. Not since 1973, when President Richard Nixon ended the
draft amid national disillusionment with the Vietnam War, has a
young American been conscripted into the armed forces. So lawmakers
and Pentagon recruiting experts are hoping that efforts to bolster
incentives, improve pay and do more to market the services will
keep some members of Congress who advocate a resurrection of the
draft from opening up what is sure to be an explosive political
issue. By MICHAEL D. TOWLE. Story will move in ``w'' Washington

PENTAGON SEEKING WAYS TO INCREASE ENLISTMENTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL D. TOWLE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In an effort to replenish the thinning ranks of the
armed forces, the Pentagon and Congress are looking at everything
from slick advertising to improved pay and benefits to a revival of
the draft.
</P>
<P>
   Not since 1973, when President Richard Nixon ended the draft
amid national disillusionment with the Vietnam War, has a young
American been conscripted into the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   So lawmakers and Pentagon recruiting experts are hoping that
efforts to bolster incentives, improve pay and do more to market
the services will keep some members of Congress who advocate a
resurrection of the draft from opening up what is sure to be an
explosive political issue.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the problem is the military's increasing
difficulty in filling its ranks with qualified personnel.
</P>
<P>
   The Army expects to miss its recruiting goals this year by 7,000
and the Air Force by 2,500. The Navy expects to meet this year's
goal, but only after lowering educational requirements. Only the
Marine Corps consistently meets its recruiting goals, having hit
its target number for the last 50 months.
</P>
<P>
   The Marines don't use promises of big bonuses, guarantees of
college tuition or even training opportunities in their advertising
campaigns. Instead, they have focused for years on the challenge of
becoming a Marine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their message has been consistent over the years; it's all
about a personal transformation,'' said Rob Cherof, who manages the
Marines account at the J. Walter Thompson advertising agency in
Atlanta. ``It's about somebody becoming better, meeting challenges
and growing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Marines, he said, are constantly trying to understand the
likes and dislikes of young Americans and finding ways to get their
attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Marines will sell themselves,'' he said. ``You just have
to get a kid to listen.''
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force, which lately has been more successful in
vanquishing Yugoslav air power than in meeting recruiting targets,
has taken a tip from the Marines and started a new sort of air war.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in years, the Air Force is buying TV spots in
an effort to attract recruits. One difference between its campaign
and those of the other services: The Air Force uses its own
personnel instead of actors.
</P>
<P>
   The total cost of the effort, to run for 18 months, will be $54
million.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Talbert, director of Air Force advertising, said the
military is finding it increasingly difficult to capture the
attention of young people. Fewer members of the recruit pool have
parents with military experience and many potential recruits have
very clear career goals, Talbert said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The young people today are very proud of who they are and what
they are,'' Talbert said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know that they bring something to the table, also. They
know they bring value and worth to the military and they want to
know what the military is going to do with that and how they are
going to be treated. We have to craft our messages around that
attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   But Pentagon studies show that military recruiters face an
uphill battle in persuading young people to sign up:
</P>
<P>
   _ The proportion of 16- to 21-year-old men and women who enlist
in the military has dropped from 34 percent in 1991 to 27 percent
today.
</P>
<P>
   _ Unemployment rates are the lowest since implementation of the
all-volunteer force 26 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   _ More young people are going to college than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Clinton administration has dispatched U.S. troops on more
overseas deployments than any other administration since the end of
World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``The all-volunteer force is a strong force, but it is also a
fragile force,'' said Rep. Tom Udall, D-N.M. ``It relies on
recruiting and retaining quality people. Our armed forces have been
reduced to the point where the military struggles to meet all the
commitments we place on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Steve Buyer, R-Ind., chairman of the military personnel
subcommittee, has said he believes that Congress should at least
examine a revival of the draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, American service personnel are deployed in numerous
contingency operations around the globe,'' Buyer said. ``This is
truly alarming, given the future uncertainty of military manpower
as a result of the service's recruiting and retention problems.''
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone in Congress is convinced that the draft is the
answer to the Pentagon's recruiting woes. In fact, a bill aimed at
abolishing the Selective Service System recently passed in the
House, although it is expected to die in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Some lawmakers and Pentagon brass believe that recruitment
problems can be eased by spending more money on recruits and
improving the quality of life for active military personnel.
</P>
<P>
   Among the proposals being considered by Congress: increasing
pay, giving bigger bonuses to recruits, and spending more on
college tuition.
</P>
<P>
   The military spending plan for fiscal 2000, now before Congress,
contains an entire section on ways to attract the nearly 200,000
young people the Pentagon needs to fill vacancies left by retiring
personnel.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would increase the Pentagon's advertising budget by
$53.1 million, add $17.5 million to equip recruiters better, and
provide an additional $22 million for recruiting bonuses. The bill
would also raise pay across the board by 4.8 percent and establish
a Thrift Savings Plan similar to a 401(k) retirement savings
account.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Mac Thornberry, R-Texas, a member of the military
personnel subcommittee, said, ``Money alone will not fix the
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Thornberry, who opposes reviving the draft, said the Pentagon
must improve the quality of life for members of the military and
the administration must re-examine how it uses the military.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to look at the number of things we are asking people
in the military to do and how much time they have to be away from
their families and how hard they have to work,'' Thornberry said.
``They are being stretched too thin.''
</P>
<P>
   Some military experts believe that, if the all-volunteer force
is to survive, the Pentagon must reconsider its structure from the
ground up.
</P>
<P>
   ``The military is fighting a double uphill battle,'' said David
Segal, a military sociologist at the University of Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   Segal advocates the use of more civilians in jobs normally held
by military personnel. For example, he would have the Air Force
hire civilians for aircraft maintenance, allowing more of its
military personnel to be used for tasks directly connected to
fighting wars. Fewer recruits would thus be needed, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Segal also said the Pentagon and American universities should
collaborate in training students to serve in military jobs, many of
which now require a high level of technical skill.
</P>
<P>
   Some at the Pentagon and in Congress believe that such an
approach might work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ought to look at a variety of things and examine whether it
is essential to have military personnel perform a particular
function,'' Thornberry said. ``I have no doubt that there are a lot
of things we ask military members to do now that could be done by
private contractors and probably could be done cheaper.''
</P>
<P>
   But some military experts do not believe there is a connection
between improving the military's quality of life and recruiting
results.
</P>
<P>
   Retired Army Maj. Gen. William Nash, who led U.S. peacekeeping
troops in Bosnia in 1995, said: ``You can throw a lot of money at
it, but the most important thing they need to throw is prestige.
You have to make it a prestigious, honorable, respectful pursuit.''

   CHICAGO _ The crabbed handwriting emerges from the fax machine
like a communication from another time, a dispatch from a great
battle that has passed into history. Yet Sir Fred Hoyle, the
British cosmologist who, five decades ago, derisively coined the
term ``Big Bang'' for a cosmic theory with which he did not and
does not agree, makes plain in his faxed letter that for him, the
battle lives on. And it is not just a fight against a theory.
</P>
<P>
   With seemingly equal tenacity, that fight is directed at the
late Sir Martin Ryle, a British radio astronomer and Nobel laureate
who espoused the Big Bang theory. Observations that Ryle used in
the 1950s to attack Hoyle's alternative theory turned out to be
flawed, notes the letter, which then thunders that the Big Bang is
``a huge facade based on no real evidence at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Is it a personal feud or just a rousing scientific debate? The
two themes may be inextricable: All aspects of the clash stirred up
interest in the relevant science, spurring decades of fresh
observations that seemed to settle the issue in favor of what is
now officially called the Big Bang, a theory that assumes the
universe began in a colossal explosion.
</P>
<P>
   Though you would never know it from the textbooks, beneath the
flapping banners of feuding scientific ideas, as often as not there
are feuding scientists.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd think that scientists would have a degree of saintliness
that would be almost unbearable,'' said Dr. Leon Lederman, a Nobel
Prize-winning physicist at the Fermi National Accelerator
Laboratory. ``It doesn't work that way. The competition goes on at
all levels _ the international, the national, the institutional,
and finally the guy across the hall.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the unhappy families of Tolstoy's ``Anna Karenina,'' which
were all unhappy in different ways, no two scientific rivalries
have precisely the same causes and consequences. Some skirmishes do
little more than quicken the pace of research, as when Albert
Einstein and David Hilbert, the German mathematician, raced each
other for the first correct formulation of the equations of general
relativity in 1915.
</P>
<P>
   Other spats have the effect of both drawing attention to an
important research question while souring many scientists on ever
working in the field. The classic case involved Dr. Allan Sandage
of the Carnegie Observatories in Pasadena, Calif., and the late Dr.
Gerard de Vaucouleurs; the pair feuded with ceaseless rancor in the
1970s and '80s over the rate at which the universe is expanding,
called the Hubble constant. The consequences of that battle are
still ricocheting through the world of scientific research today.
</P>
<P>
   Still other feuds appear to be entirely destructive, with little
redeeming value for scientific research _ like the bitter personal
and professional split between Drs. Tsung Dao Lee and Chen Ning
Yang, who won the Nobel Prize for collaborative work in 1957.
</P>
<P>
   Many scientific feuds have certain human elements in common,
said Dr. Virginia Trimble, an astrophysicist at the University of
California, Irvine, who used the Hoyle-Ryle case as an
illustration. ``I knew them both. Neither person was overwhelmingly
easy to get along with,'' she said, choosing her words carefully.
</P>
<P>
   ``And indeed, nobody who does something earth-shaking is likely
to be,'' said Dr. Trimble. ``You only achieve things like that by
being more single-minded than your friends and relations are likely
to regard as totally reasonable.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the scientific penchant for feuding is offset by
mutually supportive alliances that are not quite as noisy, said Dr.
Karen Johnson, a historian of science at St. Lawrence University,
who has studied the fruitful intellectual exchange between the
physics Nobelist Maria Goeppert Mayer and her husband, Joseph E.
Mayer, a chemist. But even that sort of interaction is seldom
explored in official accounts, said Dr. Johnson, perhaps because
``it doesn't fit the nice, neat, one-great-person idea of
history.''
</P>
<P>
   No one is sure whether the large teams characteristic of
end-of-millennium research have fostered more alliances of all
types, or created even more friction. But some scientists have a
hunch.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is more agony, perhaps, in modern times,'' said Dr.
Gerard 't Hooft, a particle theorist at Utrecht University in the
Netherlands, who is considered a Nobel Prize candidate for
discoveries he made with Dr. Martinus Veltman, another Dutch
scientist. Following a dispute over credit for the work, the two
scientists have ``floated apart,'' in 't Hooft's words.
</P>
<P>
   There was already plenty of agony to go around during the
scientific revolutions of Elizabethan times. Early feuds involved
everything from courtly status and sheer snobbery to overheated
competition and charges of plagiarism.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In 1588, for instance, the Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe
proposed a radical theory of the heavens in which the sun orbited
an immovable Earth while all the other planets whirled about the
sun. A few months later, a mathematician named Ursus, who had risen
from extremely humble beginnings to prominence in the court of
Rudolf II in Prague, published a book with a similar theory under
his own name.
</P>
<P>
   Tycho branded Ursus a thief and a vituperative exchange ensued,
followed by a lawsuit. Even though the controversy got other
astronomers interested in the problem, far more than just science
was in play, said Dr. Owen Gingerich, a historian at the
Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tycho was of noble birth,'' said Gingerich, ``and he felt that
it was improper for a sometime swineherd to have his own
cosmological system.''
</P>
<P>
   A frequent brawler of the time was Galileo Galilei, who
developed the telescope and first turned it to the heavens, said
Dr. Noel Swerdlow of the University of Chicago. ``Galileo despised
Tycho Brahe,'' Swerdlow said, probably because Tycho was the most
effective opponent of the view that all the planets including Earth
went around the sun, as Galileo correctly believed.
</P>
<P>
   One of the angriest of all feuds pitted Sir Isaac Newton against
Robert Hooke, a brilliant scientist seven years his senior. Decades
of antipathy began when Newton and Hooke disagreed about the nature
of color. Eventually an aging, infirm Hooke accused the
hypersensitive genius of pilfering from him Newton's most famous
ideas on the theory of gravity. ``That fight was just nasty,'' said
Dr. Alan E. Shapiro, director of the program in history of science
and technology at the University of Minnesota. ``That had no happy
resolution,'' he said.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   The most prominent and public English scientific feud in modern
times has been the Hoyle-Ryle split. The scientific debate revolved
around observations of faint and presumably distant radio sources
in the sky. More of the faint sources were to be expected in a Big
Bang universe than in the one favored by Hoyle _ a ``steady state''
cosmos with no definite beginning or end.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Ryle eventually declared that he had demolished the steady-state
theory by discovering vast numbers of the faint sources. After one
particularly high-profile announcement in early 1961, the story ran
in the London papers, and ``for the next week, my children were
ragged about it at school,'' Hoyle wrote in ``Home is Where the
Wind Blows: Chapters from a Cosmologist's Life'' (University
Science Books, 1994).
</P>
<P>
   To make matters worse, Ryle's early analysis turned out to have
mistakes, and the claimed numbers fell sharply. The standoff
captured the attention of a host of other astronomers, who turned
up many apparent inconsistencies between their observations and the
predictions of steady-state theory. But Hoyle, who defends a
modified version of the theory in a new book titled ``A Different
Approach to Cosmology: From a Static Universe Through the Big Bang
Towards Reality,'' to be published by Cambridge University Press
later this year, still believes the consensus on the Big Bang was
rash.
</P>
<P>
   ``The really interesting question is why the world was so ready
to believe in this story,'' Hoyle wrote in his faxed letter.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The fight between Sandage and de Vaucouleurs involved the rate
at which the cosmos is flying apart as a consequence of the Big
Bang explosion. Their answers persistently differed by a factor of
two, with Sandage getting the lower value. Sandage eventually
became so upset by the dispute that he stopped attending most
scientific meetings.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. John Huchra of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for
Astrophysics remembers that one verbal exchange between them, at a
conference in Paris in 1976, helped spark his own interest in the
field. ``They got up, and they were duking it out in front of the
audience,'' Huchra said.
</P>
<P>
   Huchra was later among the founders of a Hubble Space Telescope
team, called the Key Project, that recently announced what some
regard as the most reliable measurement yet of the expansion rate.
But the number falls about midway between the original poles of the
dispute and is still too high for Sandage.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's still a controversy, and this isn't going to settle
it,'' he told Science magazine when the results appeared.
</P>
<P>
   That uncompromising approach puts off some researchers, but Dr.
Wendy Freedman, a leader of the Key Project at the Carnegie
Observatories in Pasadena, said that such conflicts are inevitable
in cutting-edge science. ``I don't take it personally,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A somewhat less positive view was offered by another member of
the Key Project, Dr. Barry Madore of the California Institute of
Technology, who is married to Dr. Freedman. The original feud,
Madore said, ``was a battle not so much of the titans as of the
grumpy old men.''
</P>
<P>
   Few scientific benefits have flowed from the blow-up between
Lee, of Columbia University, and Yang, of the State University of
New York, Stony Brook, who have scarcely spoken to each other for
more than 35 years. They have published conflicting accounts of
their collaboration, each claiming the lion's share of credit for
the idea, called parity violation, that won them a Nobel Prize in
1957. Parity is a kind of right-left symmetry that physicists had
thought was a property of every subatomic interaction. The pair
quarreled about the ordering of their names on joint papers and in
a lengthy profile of the duo that appeared in The New Yorker in
1962. Prophetically, the article was titled ``A question of
parity.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, scientists do get along. Even then, however, the
story is seldom free of strife.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the century's more embarrassing episodes of gender
discrimination, the University of Chicago refused to pay a salary
to Maria Goeppert Mayer, a German-born and educated professor at
the university. It was a situation she had faced repeatedly, and
``there were periods in the 1930s when she would have given up,''
said Dr. Johnson of St. Lawrence University. But her husband, the
American chemist Joseph E. Mayer, would not hear of it. ``Joe was
the one who was really adamant,'' Dr. Johnson said. ``He wanted her
to stay in science,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In an essay titled ``Science at the Breakfast Table,'' published
earlier this year in the journal Physics in Perspective, Dr.
Johnson also traced how Mayer gradually absorbed some of his wife's
mathematical wizardry, while she picked up some of his skill in
interpreting experimental data. Both used those breakfast lessons
in their most noted work _ including the discovery of the shell
structure of atomic nuclei that won Maria Goeppert Mayer a Nobel
Prize in 1963.
</P>
<P>
   Science has had more than its share of collaborations _ they are
just quieter than the feuds, said Dr. James Hartle of the
University of California, Santa Barbara, who has worked on
cosmological problems with Dr. Stephen Hawking, the Cambridge
University physicist, since the 1970s. Generally, ``it's the
science that drives it,'' while friendship naturally follows,
Hartle said.
</P>
<P>
   In this collaborative, combative age, there are even scientists
who still prefer to work alone, said Dr. Vera Rubin, the astronomer
at the Carnegie Institution of Washington who discovered that
galaxies are filled with a mysterious sort of dark matter. Dr.
Rubin, who has a particular aversion to being rushed by
competition, said that she had carefully chosen to observe aspects
of the sky that no one else was interested in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally,'' Dr. Rubin said, ``I have spent my life looking
for problems that I could do and nobody would bother me while I was
doing them.''  &QL;

 &HT;    FEMA: HURRICANE DISASTER AID ALREADY IN PLACE
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON - Wherever Hurricane Floyd hits, the federal agency
responsible for emergencies says it won't be as tardy as it was
after Hurricane Andrew, seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of things going on that were not going on six
years ago,'' said Lacy Suiter, Federal Emergency Management
Agency's executive associate director.
</P>
<P>
   When Andrew slammed into Florida just south of Miami in August
1992, the tardy and disjointed federal response sparked cries of
anger from state and local authorities and prompted then-President
Bush to name his transportation secretary to coordinate the federal
effect.
</P>
<P>
   FEMA officials Monday said the agency has changed dramatically
since then. They said they were ready to roll and could have
supplies into an affected area within hours after the Floyd's
passage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The federal government is being not just reactive to events
and the requests of the governors, but we're being pro-active,''
Suiter said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not waiting until the hurricane comes ashore to buy the
ice and buy the water and get the generators ready and get the
other things ready to move out to the area. We're doing it now in
anticipation of what the requirements might be,'' Suiter said.
``We've been through this enough to know what to anticipate and
what to plan for.''
</P>
<P>
   FEMA emergency response centers have been activated in Atlanta,
Ga., and Washington, D.C., and it has representatives at state
emergency centers from Florida to North Carolina. A hurricane
liaison team of federal emergency officials is also stationed at
the National Hurricane Center in Miami to monitor the latest
forecasts of the storm's path and intensity.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, FEMA has positioned ice, water, plastic sheeting,
cots, tents, and emergency food and medial supplies in Atlanta
where they can be delivered within hours wherever Floyd hits land,
said Bruce Baughman, FEMA director of response.
</P>
<P>
   There are more than 30,000 rolls of plastic sheeting -- enough
to cover 25,000 roofless houses -- and some 100 tons of ice, he
said. The supplies are being kept in Atlanta, rather than closer to
where the hurricane might hit, in order to protect them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Depending on the track (taken by the storm) you don't want to
get it too far forward because the supplies themselves may become a
victim,'' Baughman said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the supplies on hand, FEMA has contracted with
suppliers to provide additional support such as debris removal,
roofing repairs and bulk water if needed, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the federal government is urging individuals to
prepare by making their property as hurricane-proof as possible
such as removing lawn furniture and listening to local government
warnings. Residents also are urged to check the FEMA website for
other tips at www.fema.gov.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a serious storm,'' Suiter said. ``It may be the worst
storm that we have had in many, many years.''

THE DANCE OF THE PEAFOWL  
 WHICH WAY TO THE LAUNDRY?  
 WHEN FORESTS ARE CUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
 (af)  
 By HENRY FOUNTAIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mating, animal behaviorists are fond of saying, is a dance. For
some species, it's the hustle; for others, the shake or the shimmy.
For peafowl, the dance is of the ballroom variety, ladies' choice.
The males gather in a group, known as a lek, and the females size
them up as potential partners.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike the scenario at the local Arthur Murray, where the
instructor insures that everyone gets a chance to fox-trot, only a
few very attractive males get mates (and lots of them). Many
peacocks are called to the floor, it seems, but few are chosen.
</P>
<P>
   Why would a less attractive peacock keep participating in this
ritual? Researchers in England studying 200 peafowl in a park near
London think they have some answers.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers, writing in the journal Nature, discovered
through DNA that peacocks tend to be more closely related within
one lek than among different leks. They even found that siblings
separated before birth managed to link up with their kin for mating
displays.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers suggest that lekking may have an evolutionary
basis. By displaying themselves in a group, peacocks increase the
number of peahens that show up. So by teaming up with more
attractive relatives, a plain peacock may not get a mate but at
least will help insure that its kin do and thus pass on the family
genes. Or the evolution of lekking could be driven by the peahens,
who may prefer to choose mates from among peacocks with similar
traits.

   The endoplasmic reticulum is the laundry room of the cell. It is
there that newly manufactured proteins are folded. The long,
unwieldy molecules are twisted and turned into their final,
functional shapes.
</P>
<P>
   And just as some people like their shirts folded just so,
exactly how a protein is folded can be critical for a cell. A
misshaped protein can cause damage or disease.
</P>
<P>
   That is what happens with mad cow disease (formally known as
bovine spongiform encephalopathy) and a related human illness,
Creutzfeld-Jacob disease. A protein, known as prion protein, folds
abnormally and causes degeneration in the brain (resulting in the
progressive loss of mental functioning that is characteristic of
these diseases).
</P>
<P>
   Now, scientists at the University of Chicago have discovered the
reason prion protein misfolds: The protein never makes it to the
endoplasmic reticulum.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, prion protein has a particular structure, or label,
that is recognized by other proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum.
But for some reason this locating system does not work, and the
proteins are misdirected. The protein then does not fold properly
and cannot carry out its usual tasks.
</P>
<P>
   The next step for the scientists, who described their work in
the October issue of Nature Cell Biology, is to figure out why the
proteins are being misdirected.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate effects of the steady deforestation that is
occurring in the Amazon and elsewhere have been well documented.
But deforestation is not always an all-or-nothing thing: when land
is cleared for timber, grazing, agriculture or settlement, some
patches of mature forest are often spared.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a study by a Georgetown University scientist shows that
deforestation has a long-term effect on the trees left behind,
limiting seed dispersal and making the remaining forests more
genetically uniform.
</P>
<P>
   The scientist studied genetic variation in a type of Brazil nut
tree in a forest near Manaus, Brazil, that was partially cleared in
the early 1980s. Maternal genes, which are carried only in seeds,
were studied; paternal genes are carried in pollen, and other
studies have shown that pollen is dispersed over long distances in
such circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   The study, reported in Nature, showed that forest fragments as
large as about 25 acres had a single maternal lineage. The
deforested zones effectively prevent the influx of other seeds that
might diversify the genetic makeup of the remaining forested
areas. &QL;

   When Dr. Ronald Epstein counseled a patient who was considering
genetic screening for breast cancer, he confronted questions his
medical knowledge had not equipped him to address. What difference
would knowing the results make? How much was the patient guided by
fear and depression? What approach would be most helpful?
</P>
<P>
   What helped him, he wrote in the Sept. 1 issue of The Journal of
the American Medical Association, was what he called ``mindful
practice.'' In the article, he urged fellow doctors to make
``attending to the ordinary, the obvious and the present'' part of
their practice.
</P>
<P>
   Too often, he wrote, doctors focus on technical aspects of
medical care at the expense of reflection, self-awareness and
sensitivity to patients' feelings and values. Just as a musician
plays and listens at the same time, a physician must incorporate a
whole range of technical abilities with an awareness of the patient
as a person, wrote Epstein, who plays the harpsichord.
</P>
<P>
   He cited one striking instance: a trainee, ``mistaking the chart
for the patient,'' reported a patient's having a history of ``BKA''
(below-the-knee amputation), never noticing that the patient still
had both feet.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   CAUSE AND EFFECT: SINUSITIS ATTACKS PINNED ON FUNGUS
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at the Mayo Clinic who were looking for the most
common cause of chronic sinus infections say they have found what
they were seeking _ and it was not the culprit most doctors had
expected.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, doctors thought the disease was usually a
bacterial infection, with perhaps 6 percent of cases caused by a
reaction to fungus. But after a two-year study of 210 chronic
sinusitis patients, the researchers found that more than 90 percent
of the cases arose from an immune-system response to a common
fungus.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers, who published their findings this month in the
Mayo Clinic Proceedings, a peer-review journal, said the discovery
was an important step to finding a more effective treatment. Dr.
David Sherris, a co-author of the study with Dr. Eugene Kern and
Dr. Jens Ponikau, said they were investigating treatments that
would both keep fungus levels low and counter the immune-system's
response to the fungus. He estimated that ``a potential treatment
will probably be available within two to four years.''
</P>
<P>
   Chronic sinusitis, an inflammation of the membranes of the nose
and sinus cavities that lasts three months or longer, affects 37
million Americans, the clinic says. Symptoms range from a
long-running cold to total nasal obstruction. It is different from
acute sinusitis, which lasts a month or less and is typically
caused by bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   Sherris said the discovery was made possible by improved
techniques for testing for fungus in samples of mucus. The types of
fungus that was detected by the researchers ``is ubiquitous,'' he
said. While only some people react badly to the fungus, he said,
``It is in everybody's nose.''

   SIDE EFFECTS: INDOOR SHOOTERS, LOOK OUT FOR THE LEAD
</P>
<P>
   Annie Oakley did most of her dead-eye shooting in the healthy
outdoors. But teen-agers and others who want to emulate her need to
be concerned about the hazards of lead exposure at indoor firing
ranges.
</P>
<P>
   In the Sept. 9 issue of The New England Journal of Medicine, Dr.
Michael Shannon, director of the Pediatric Environmental Health
Center at Children's Hospital in Boston, reported the cases of four
girls, ages 14 to 16, who had significant lead poisoning. The
condition can damage the kidneys, bone marrow and nervous system
and can harm a fetus during pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   None showed symptoms, but went for testing because they had been
warned about the possible danger at firing ranges.
</P>
<P>
   The girls competed at the same indoor range, and the exposure
occurred even though they followed the range's precautions,
including washing their hands and changing clothes after practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``An indoor firing range is an enclosed, tight, poorly
ventilated room that is blanketed with lead powder,'' Shannon wrote
in an e-mail interview. ``Those inside are not only inhaling it,
absorbing lead through their lungs, but also getting it on their
clothes, hair and fingers,'' which they might put in their mouths.
Lead is not absorbed through the skin, he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Shannon said he was concerned about a possible increase in the
number of female rifle team members as a result of the growth of
women's athletics.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the National Collegiate Athletic Association
said that in the 1997-98 season, there were 11 intercollegiate
women's rifle teams with 50 athletes, and another 339 shooters on
40 mixed and men's teams.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   SYMPTOMS LEG PAINS, BAD VEINS AND FREE SCREENINGS
</P>
<P>
   People in their 50s and older who feel cramping or pain in their
legs while walking may dismiss the symptoms as inevitable signs of
aging.
</P>
<P>
   But in fact, they are the common signs of peripheral vascular
disease, which is caused by blockages in leg arteries that in turn
increase the risk of heart disease and lead to 100,000 leg
amputations each year in the United States, according to the
Society of Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology, a medical
organization.
</P>
<P>
   Research by the radiology group estimates that the condition is
undiagnosed in about a quarter of the eight million Americans who
have it.
</P>
<P>
   To increase diagnosis and lower the risk of complications, the
group has organized a national campaign, Legs for Life, in which
more than 500 hospitals and other health care centers around the
country are offering free screenings for peripheral vascular
disease this week. Screening sites are listed on the Webat
www.legsforlife.org.
</P>
<P>
   The screening begins with a questionnaire that assesses a
person's risk for the vascular disease. Risk factors include
smoking, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, being over 50 and a
history of heart disease or diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   Next, the person has an ankle-brachial index, a painless
10-minute exam that uses ultrasound to measure the ratio of blood
pressure in an ankle and an arm. Lower blood pressure in the ankle
is considered a sign of a blockage in a leg artery.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Lynn Smaha, president of the American Heart Association,
says that the vascular condition can often be controlled with
changes like quitting smoking, and modifying diet to lower blood
pressure and cholesterol, the same measures that also help protect
against heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   Standard medical treatments for peripheral vascular disease
include cholesterol or blood pressure medicine or, as a last
resort, surgery to unblock the arteries.

HOW MUSCLES CAN GO WEAK WITH LAUGHTER  
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   If you ever think you're about to fall down laughing _ say, when
you hear that old knee-slapper about the Belgians and their
extra-long moving vans _ scientists may now be able to tell you
why.
</P>
<P>
   Laughter, it turns out, seems to trigger a reflex that can bring
many of the muscles of the body to the point of collapse. The
phenomenon can actually be measured by sending electric signals
through the muscles and gauging their response.
</P>
<P>
   This information comes courtesy of researchers in the
Netherlands, and is reported in the current issue of The Lancet,
the British medical journal.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, the researchers posit that the behavior of
the muscles during laughter probably explains why phrases like
``weak with laughter'' pop up in many different languages.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just a metaphor,'' said Dr. Gert van Dijk, who helped
conduct the study at the Leiden University Medical Center. ``In
fact, it's not a metaphor at all. It's an observation.''
</P>
<P>
   The observation of how muscles react during laughter was a
serendipitous discovery made in the course of a more serious
project.
</P>
<P>
   Van Dijk and his colleagues were exploring a debilitating
medical condition known as cataplexy, in which people collapse and
sometimes injure themselves in moments of emotion, especially
laughter. Cataplexy often strikes people with narcolepsy _ an
estimated 125,000 in the United States _ in which the sufferer has
great difficulty remaining awake during the day.
</P>
<P>
   For comparison purposes, the researchers set up a small control
group of volunteers to see how the muscles of normal patients are
affected by emotions like laughter. They attached electrodes to the
volunteers' legs to measure what is known as the H-reflex, a
neurological pathway that causes muscle contractions, and then
showed them a variety of slides meant to elicit different
reactions.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists expected to see little change in the muscle tone
of the control group. But the volunteers were fellow researchers
and medical students. Far from being tense (a normal reaction among
volunteers), the subjects were jovial, bantering with the
researchers.
</P>
<P>
   Then someone noticed the muscle changes being recorded by the
equipment. ``The H-reflex virtually disappeared in all four people
when they laughed out loud,'' the Lancet article said.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers then set out to repeat the findings using a new
group of subjects whom they intentionally tried to make laugh.
</P>
<P>
   That job fell to Sebastiaan Overeem, a medical student known for
his sense of humor. And Overeem, 22, did not fail, even if, in the
name of research, he had to have some fun at the expense of his
neighbors to the south. ``Belgian jokes really work in Holland,''
he observed.
</P>
<P>
   (For the record: Why do Belgians use such long moving trucks?
subjects were asked. To take along their garden hoses.)
</P>
<P>
   In each case, when the subject laughed, his H-reflex almost
disappeared, researchers found. Of course, sometimes it took more
than a dusty old Belgian chestnut.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I had a few Viagra jokes,'' Overeem admitted.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The caretaker of the nation's largest colony of research
chimpanzees has agreed to give away almost half of them in an
unusual negotiation with the U.S. Department of Agriculture, one of
the federal agencies that monitors the safety and welfare of
research animals.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement, announced on Sept. 1, stemmed from charges that
Frederick Coulston, operator of the Frederick Coulston Foundation,
violated animal welfare regulations when five chimps died in his
care. The settlement ordered the foundation to turn over 300 of its
650 chimps to other centers by January 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an unprecedented consent agreement, and a big win for
these magnificent animals,'' said Michael Dunn, an under secretary
of agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   The department does not normally enter into settlements of this
kind unless it believes the animals are in danger.
</P>
<P>
   The action is the latest in a series of charges leveled at the
foundation in Alamogordo, N.M. Since 1996, the department has
investigated and brought charges in the deaths of at least nine
chimps at Coulston's center, and has levied fines for violations
ranging from keeping the animals in cages too small _ no bigger
than a public bathroom stall _ to inadequate veterinary care.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, Coulston has denied any wrongdoing, even as he
has paid the fines. The accusations have come not only from the
Department of Agriculture but also from animal-protection advocates
and biomedical researchers, who say that Coulston is a throwback to
the days when research animals were treated with callous
indifference.
</P>
<P>
   Coulston has called chimpanzees ``vicious, aggressive animals''
and has suggested that ``you can raise them like you do cattle,''
and that they could be used as blood donors for humans.
</P>
<P>
   But chimps are disconcertingly similar to people in many of
their habits and needs, a fact that has helped place them at the
center of increasingly explosive political and ethical controversy
over what to do with the nation's 1,800 research chimpanzees.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in the 1980s, the National Institutes of Health and
other federal agencies began a breeding program aimed at insuring
that enough chimpanzees would be available for biomedical research,
especially for AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   The program led to a chimp baby boom at a time when many
researchers were concluding that the animals were not good models
for AIDS research.
</P>
<P>
   Now, most of those chimps are no longer needed for federally
financed experiments and money for their long-term care has dried
up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could always find people who wanted to infect chimps,''
said Preston Marx, senior scientist at the Aaron Diamond AIDS
Research Center in New York and professor of tropical medicine at
Tulane University Medical Center, who ran a chimpanzee colony in
the early 1990s. ``But not people to take care of them for 45
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Many researchers, including a panel formed in 1994 by the
National Research Council, believe the National Institutes of
Health should take responsibility for the chimps and retire most of
them to sanctuaries.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Thomas Wolfle, a former director of the National Research
Council's Institute for Laboratory Animal Research and member of
the task force, said the National Institutes of Health was
``morally responsible'' for the welfare of the animals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they should just bite the bullet and assume lifetime
care for animals they bred and move some out of active research,''
Wolfle said.
</P>
<P>
   The agency has shown little interest in the idea. But just how
many chimps the agency should support and whether any of them
should be retired from research are matters of dispute. Providing
for retirement of animals, said Dr. John Strandberg, directive of
comparative medicine at the National Center for Research Resources,
is ``not in the plans for the moment.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Coulston and his colony of chimps, one of five federally
financed chimp centers in the United States, has served as a
lightning rod for the debate over what to do about surplus chimps.
In 1993 he took over a large colony of primates, including several
hundred chimps, from New Mexico State University.
</P>
<P>
   Within weeks, three chimpanzees were found dead, after a heater
in their room sent the temperature soaring overnight to 140 degrees
Fahrenheit. Coulston was charged with violating the Animal Welfare
Act, the law that governs the treatment of research animals, in
connection with the overheating incident and other problems at the
site.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1997, Echo, a 2-year-old female chimp, died after being
operated on by two inexperienced veterinarians. In early 1998, a
chimp named Holly died from preventable side effects of a drug that
was being tested at the foundation. Two more chimps died from the
same cause in June 1998. The most recent death, during a spinal
experiment, occurred in May. The Agriculture Department, partly as
a result of investigations by an animal protection advocacy group,
In Defense of Animals, filed charges in 1997 and then again this
year. Coulston agreed to pay fines but did not admit any
wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his troubles, Coulston had more than doubled the number
of chimps in his care in the past decade, including more than 100
chimpanzees from New York University, which gave him the animals
amid a swirl of controversy in 1997, along with more than
$1,750,000 for their care. Last year the Air Force sent him 111 of
its chimpanzees, many of them descendants of the ``space chimps''
used in the 1960s to test the safety of space exploration.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Department of Agriculture, part of the problem
at the Coulston Foundation stems from inadequate veterinary care.
Fourteen veterinarians have left the foundation since 1994, a high
turnover rate. In the last two years, most of the foundation's
veterinarians have had only minimal experience with chimps,
according to In Defense of Animals.
</P>
<P>
   Don McKinney, communications director of the foundation, said,
``They have to get their experience somewhere.'' He added, ``The
reality is, there are not very many primate vets running around.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the findings by the Agriculture Department, the National
Institutes of Health has continued to support the Coulston
Foundation with approximately $10 million in contracts over the
last six years. Late last year, Rep. Carolyn B. Maloney, D-N.Y.,
began questioning the agency about its support of the foundation.
</P>
<P>
   But Wolfle and others say that without federal money, Coulston
would be unable to care for the chimpanzees.
</P>
<P>
   Coulston's troubles highlight the financial straits that many
primate colonies find themselves in: less and less money to care
for their chimps.
</P>
<P>
   The animals have been supported by a combination of federal
money and private contracts from drug and medical device companies,
which pay primate centers to conduct research and to test drugs and
devices.
</P>
<P>
   Several federal agencies, but mostly the National Institutes of
Health, have paid to breed more chimps and to infect many animals
with HIV, the AIDS virus, and hepatitis. Now with the move away
from using chimpanzees in AIDS research, many centers are
scrambling to find the minimum $15 a day that it costs to keep each
primate.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, agricultural officials said worries about Coulston's
finances prompted the agency to include a provision in their recent
agreement allowing auditors access to his financial records.
</P>
<P>
   In Defense of Animals said the foundation had lost 30 percent of
its revenue between July 1997 and June 1998. McKinney of the
foundation declined to respond.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement between the foundation and the Agriculture
Department also stipulates that a full-time consultant be brought
in to act as a go-between, at government expense, and insure that
the foundation complies with the agreements.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a last ditch effort to get him to clean up his act,''
Wolfle said.
</P>
<P>
   The fate of the 1,200 research chimps in other primate centers
is equally murky.
</P>
<P>
   In its 1997 report, the National Research Council urged the
health institutes to set aside $7 million to $10 million for the
care of 1,000 chimpanzees, about 600 of which the panel estimated
would be needed for research. Part of that money would go toward
placing the other 400 chimpanzees into sanctuaries. The panel also
warned the institutes to move quickly to avoid the possibility that
centers would have to start killing chimps because they could no
longer care for them.
</P>
<P>
   In response, the national institutes have started a Chimpanzee
Management Plan, which by next summer will reduce the number of
primate centers it supports to two from five.
</P>
<P>
   The management plan has set aside $4.2 million, enough to care
for only 600 animals, most of which will continue to serve in
research. That could leave many of the remaining chimps in the
lurch. No one knows if there is enough private research money to
support those chimps. And while animal welfare groups would like to
see them put into sanctuaries, they do not have the money to do it.

   COOKE CITY, Mont. _ A helicopter clatters loudly over the
northeast corner of Yellowstone National Park, flying low and slow
to snap images of the patchwork of creeks, meadows, pine and fir.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of an ordinary camera, the helicopter carries a
device that uses detectors precisely made of crystal and kept by
liquid nitrogen at minus 273 degrees Fahrenheit. Called a
hyperspectral camera or a hyperspectral imaging spectrometer, it is
one of a new generation of sensing instruments that experts predict
will transform many areas, including ecosystem management,
agriculture, diamond and gold mining, hazardous waste cleanup and
even wild-land firefighting.
</P>
<P>
   The $3 million camera, based on NASA technology, records far
more than can be seen by the human eye or by the Landsat satellite,
the state-of-the-art remote sensing technology. The human eye sees
three bands in the visible spectrum _ red, green and blue _ while
Landsat, called a multispectral instrument, records six bands of
light. The hyperspectral instrument used in Yellowstone records 128
bands, in information blocks, or pixels, one meter square. NASA
also has a hyperspectral imager that records 224 bands, the
Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging System, but because it is usually
flown from an ER-2 spy plane at about 70,000 feet, its pixels are
closer to 17 meters and contain fewer details, but still far more
than current remote sensing technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a revolution,'' said Robert O. Green, the experiment
scientist and project manager for hyperspectral imaging at NASA's
Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., of the new
technology. ``It can't really be called remote sensing anymore;
it's remote measurement.''
</P>
<P>
   Spectroscopy, which measures the visible or invisible spectrum
from any source, is nothing new; chemists, astronomers and other
scientists have used it for decades. But only recently have
scientists gained the technology to record the data accurately from
the air and the computer power to analyze it.
</P>
<P>
   The detector is a sophisticated prism that picks up the light
reflected off the molecules of the target and breaks it into 128 or
224 wavelengths. The number of photons in the light reflected back
is counted for each spectra, and the values are plotted to create a
distinctive spectral fingerprint for everything the camera sees,
including vegetation, minerals, gases and liquids. The imaging not
only picks up the difference between a pine tree and a fir tree but
the difference between a healthy pine and one stressed by drought
or incipient disease, even if it is invisible to the naked eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot more going on out there on the land than we can
see with other systems,'' said Joe Boardman of Analytical Imaging
and Geophysics, a private hyperspectral imaging firm in Boulder,
Colo., as he stood in a meadow waiting for the helicopter to land.
``There are dozens of kinds of willows, different depths of the
creek, the change of substrate in the creek from gravel to sand.
Hyperspectral imaging can see these things. It's really high
fidelity.''
</P>
<P>
   The hyperspectral image in the visible spectrum of red, green
and blue will look no more detailed than a satellite photo. But
even at a point where the visible image is a blur, the spectral
fingerprint remains readable. Zooming in to one meter along a sandy
stretch of river in Yellowstone, for example, a biologist is not
able to look at the photo and identify the log that is there.
Instead the computer takes the unique pattern of light reflected
off the log and quickly matches it against a library of
fingerprints that has been collected by researchers. Almost
instantly the computer identifies it as a log.
</P>
<P>
   The computer allows the data to take any number of forms. A few
keystrokes can instantly turn all of the vegetation with the same
spectral fingerprint in a photograph _ all of the logs, for example
_ the same color, telling the researcher how much downed timber
there is after a storm. A farmer can see which parts of his corn
fields have not had enough fertilizer _ those sections are turned
orange by the computer _ and can apply the chemical there and only
there.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike radar, hyperspectral technology cannot penetrate below
ground, or through vegetation or buildings. But it can be combined
with radar to make it even more potent. The challenge, researchers
say, is how to manage and process the vast amounts of data.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The technology was developed starting in the late 1970s by two
researchers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California,
Gregg Vane and Alex Goetz. The space agency has put hyperspectral
imaging equipment on two satellites, one in orbit around Jupiter
and one on the Cassini satellite, now making its way to Saturn.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1990s, powerful computers _ it takes terabytes, the
next step up from gigabytes, to run the software _ enabled the
technology to be brought out of the lab. A few private companies
built their own hyperspectral cameras. And in the last two years,
as NASA made the technology available, researchers and
entrepreneurs like Boardman have written algorithms to use the
technology for commercial and research projects. Last year NASA's
Stennis Space Center awarded 10 two-year grants to test the real
world effectiveness of the technology, including one to Yellowstone
Ecosystem Studies, a nonprofit institute in Bozeman, Mont.
</P>
<P>
   The grant enabled the institute to pay the $25,000-a-day rental
fee for the hyperspectral equipment owned by Earth Search Sciences
Inc. of McCall, Idaho.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   The results of the imaging in Yellowstone, though preliminary,
illustrate the change in store for biologists. As researchers match
the airborne imagery with hyperspectral imaging taken from the
ground, a process known as ground truthing, it is apparent that the
detail is accurate enough to replace much of the information now
gathered by hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's orders of magnitude faster than having biologists out on
the landscape collecting information,'' said Dr. Robert Crabtree,
science director of the Yellowstone Ecosystem Studies. ``As we
start thinking about managing entire ecosystems, we have a scale of
technology that fits the scale of an ecosystem.''
</P>
<P>
   With vegetation mapping, for example, field researchers can only
sample small areas by hand and then make informed extrapolation on
what the rest of a large area is like. Now the whole of Yellowstone
Park will be known in great and accurate detail from the sky.
Researchers can instantly learn if there is an important stand of
white bark pine outside the park, which is critical to the
protected grizzly bear, and whether that stand is stressed,
diseased or healthy. Scientists predict that many field researchers
will spend far less time on the ground and more time crunching data
on a computer.
</P>
<P>
   Several federal agencies are using the technology to find
noxious weeds on federal land. In the Santa Monica Mountains,
hyperspectral mapping is expected to change firefighting by
creating a map of the vegetation that fuels fires.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The commercial impact could be enormous, particularly in the
field of mineral exploration. While gold occurs in amounts too
small to see with the technology, more common minerals like
kaolinite and arsenic that are products of the same geologic
processes that produce gold are clearly visible if the ground is
relatively bare, as is the case in much of the American West or
Australian desert. The diamond industry could also be transformed:
Suddenly, kimberlite pipes, the volcanic formations that brought
diamonds to the surface in another geologic epoch, are easy to
identify from the air.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental enforcement has already benefited from the
technology. In 1995 NASA flew Aviris over Leadville, Colo., a
booming mining town in the 19th century that is now a
16-square-mile Superfund clean-up site. There are some 1,200 mining
waste piles in the area, and the Environmental Protection Agency
was looking at years of research to test each pile and figure out
which ones were leaching high amounts of arsenic, cadmium and lead.
The NASA imager was able to collect the data in 45 seconds,
although it took another 10 months to crunch the numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fantastic _ it told us exactly which piles we should
spend our time on,'' said J. Sam Vance, remedial project manager at
the Superfund site, and now on loan to the U.S. Geological Survey
in Denver as part of a 10-person team to figure out new
applications for the technology. Vance estimated the imaging saved
the EPA more than $2 million at Leadville.
</P>
<P>
   With the technology, Vance foresees an era in which polluting
corporations can no longer hide behind a lack of knowledge. The
camera can zoom over oil refineries and tell exactly where gasoline
is leaking.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   A steel plant smokestack can be imaged to see exactly what gases
are being emitted and whether they meet air quality standards. A
colleague of Vance, Gregg Swayze, spectropocist at the Geological
Survey, was looking at data from a flyover of Turquoise Lake in
Colorado and saw a huge algae bloom in the lake. Federal officials
went to investigate and found that an underwater pipe from the
bathhouse was leaking, increasing the nutrient load and the growth
of algae.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Research on global warming, too, may benefit. White bark pine,
found in Yellowstone, is sensitive to warming. The imaging might
provide an early warning indicator for warming by showing a change
in distribution and stress level.
</P>
<P>
   It is tough to hide things from this type of camera. At the
moment, no hyperspectral imagers are routinely scanning the earth,
but early next year NASA will send up a hyperspectral instrument on
a satellite for that purpose, and the Australians plan to launch a
satellite in 2001 with even more sophisticated technology that will
record data from 70 percent of the Earth's surface.
</P>
<P>
   The equipment will render virtually useless camouflage that is
not natural and growing. Green plastic has different reflectant
properties than natural vegetation out beyond the visible spectrum,
and branches that have been cut and laid over a tank have a
different fingerprint than growing vegetation. It could be used to
find land mines. And there is obvious application for the Drug
Enforcement Administration, seeking to detect marijuana and coca
plants. In fact, researchers say, the technology is so powerful
that it probably would have been classified had it come out of
military research.
</P>
<P>
   ``NASA got ahead of intelligence,'' said Green of the Jet
Propulsion Laboratory. ``They've gone a long way and it would be
hard to classify it now.''

NEW FOCUS ON RISKS OF LASER EYE SURGERY
</HEADLINE>
 
 (ATTN: Calif., Va.)  (nk) 
 By JANE E. BRODY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Mark Shulman, first fitted for glasses at age 5, was never
happy about his dependence on them. They would fog up in winter or
get clouded with sweat in summer when he pursued the outdoor
activities he loved. To see clearly when he did his daily swim, he
needed prescription goggles. Contact lenses didn't work for him. So
at age 61 he invested about $5,000 in laser surgery to correct his
myopia and astigmatisms by reshaping his corneas and to enable him
to do everything but read without glasses.
</P>
<P>
   Shulman, a retired professor of meteorology living in Woodstock,
N.Y., couldn't be more delighted. His distance vision is now better
than 20/20. He sees well at night and can drive without glasses
despite a slight loss of depth perception.
</P>
<P>
   Reports in the medical literature say that , as many as 98
percent of patients have results as good or nearly as good as
Shulman's. Dr. David Wallace, of Santa Monica, Calif., says,
``People's response to the procedure is an overjoyed, almost
child-like rediscovery of their capacity to participate fully in
life's activities without the restrictions of optical devices. It
doesn't just change eyesight; it literally changes lives.''
</P>
<P>
   But growing numbers of patients are warning others to weigh the
risks very carefully before proceeding. Many say they were not
sufficiently warned about what could go wrong and that mishaps,
when they occur, may not be correctable by wearing glasses or
contacts.
</P>
<P>
   Some complain of seeing halos around lights, or of starbursts,
clouding, dry eyes or impairment of night vision, though these
conditions may be temporary. A common complaint among those less
than pleased with the results of surgery is the feeling that they
were pressured to undergo the procedure by professionals and
receptionists who did not take their concerns seriously and whose
opinions were clouded by the profit motive.
</P>
<P>
   To counter these shortcomings and stimulate research to correct
visual problems that surgery can sometimes cause, a grass-roots
group in New York called Surgical Eyes has been formed and a Web
site established, www.surgicaleyes.org, where people with
unsuccessful surgery can post their problems.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Mitch Ferro, 31, of Virginia wrote that he was
never told that having large pupils or a high degree of astigmatism
put him at high risk for complications. He ended up with a
significant overcorrection of his nearsightedness and vision that
is distorted by halos and starbursts in dim light and at night, an
irregular astigmatism and floaters in one eye and dryness in both.
His work and quality of life have suffered, he said. ``I would pay
any amount of money to get my pre-surgical corneas back.''
</P>
<P>
   What's Involved
</P>
<P>
   Laser vision correction is a major growth industry, with the
number of patients nearly doubling annually. Close to one million
people in this country will undergo the surgery this year. It can
now be used to correct nearsightedness (myopia), astigmatism and
farsightedness (hyperopia).
</P>
<P>
   Laser surgery is considered a significant improvement over the
original technique that involved making eight surgical slits in the
cornea to change its shape. The laser method starts by either
abrading the outer layer of the cornea (a technique called PRK, for
photorefractive keratectomy) or slitting the cornea at one edge and
lifting up a flap (a technique called Lasik, for laser in-situ
keratomileusis), then using a computer-guided cool beam of an
excimer laser to precisely sculpt the surface of the cornea
according to the correction needed to produce 20/40 visual acuity
or better. After the surgery the outer layer of the cornea grows
back in about a week (in PRK) or the flap reattaches itself in a
few minutes (in Lasik).
</P>
<P>
   The entire operation, which is usually done on one eye at a time
(the second eye is done a week or two later as a precaution against
infection), is done on an outpatient basis using a local
anesthetic. It takes only about 15 minutes. There are no sutures or
patches, but PRK patients must wear a bandage lens until the
corneal surface reforms. Lasik, the latest twist on corneal
reshaping, is said to be painless, with only mild stinging and
scratchiness for a few hours after the anesthetic wears off.
However, patients are cautioned to protect the operated eye and to
use antibiotic and anti-inflammatory drops for about a week. Full
vision improvement and stabilization takes several weeks to months.
In some cases, a second operation is needed to improve the
correction.
</P>
<P>
   Laser surgery is clearly not for everyone. The greater the
degree of correction needed (in other words, the more severe the
myopia or hyperopia), the more likely there will be complications.
People with large pupils and extreme astigmatisms, like Ferro, are
also more likely to have postsurgical problems. Also,
ophthalmological surgeons will not operate on eyes that are not
healthy to start with or on people with certain health problems,
including autoimmune diseases, unstable diabetes, uncontrolled
vascular disease, chronic herpes infections, connective tissue
disorders or a tendency to scar excessively. Patients should be at
least 21 years old, have stable vision and a strong desire to be
free of glasses or contact lenses.
</P>
<P>
   There is also the money factor. Because nearly all insurers
consider the surgery a cosmetic procedure, most patients must pay
for it entirely on their own _ to the tune of about $2,200 an eye.
Numerous follow-up exams are required at specific intervals, most
of them performed by the referring eye specialist. Sometimes they
are included in the cost of surgery, but otherwise they can add
significantly to the cost.
</P>
<P>
   Patients must realize that the surgery, even when it results in
20/20 distance vision, does not mean they will be free of
corrective lenses forever. Laser surgery cannot correct presbyopia,
the loss of clear close-up vision that occurs in everyone after age
40. Presbyopia results from an inflexibility of the lens of the
eye, not a misshapen cornea. In fact, most people who are myopic
and undergo laser surgery will eventually have to use reading
glasses that they might have avoided had they stayed myopic.
</P>
<P>
   Careful preoperative homework and consultation is important for
everyone considering laser eye surgery to correct visual acuity.
Shulman said he attended a seminar where he was well briefed on
what was involved and the risks, including statistics on how often
complications occurred. No pressure was put on patients to go ahead
with the procedure if they were fearful or did not feel they were
good candidates, he said. He also had confidence in the surgeon,
who had done nearly 1,000 eyes before operating on his. If you are
considering the surgery, be sure you will not be a guinea pig for a
surgeon who has done only a few procedures before yours.
</P>
<P>
   Also, if the surgeon you consult doubts your eligibility for the
procedure, don't push to have it done anyway or go shopping until
you find a doctor who is willing to operate. The effects of laser
surgery are permanent, and if things go wrong, you could end up
with uncorrectable vision problems far worse than those you started
with.

 &HT;    FARMERS CALL FOR REPEAL OF 1996 FARM LAW
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ David Senter smiled sadly at his year-old grandson,
Mason, who was wearing bib overalls and sitting on a toy John Deere
tractor on the sunny grounds of the U.S. Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish my grandsons would have had a chance to farm,'' allowed
Senter, a former Texas farmer lamenting how his family had been
forced to sell its spread near Fort Worth where his forebears had
raised cotton and cattle for a century.
</P>
<P>
   In a ritual nearly as regular as plantings and harvests,
hundreds of family farmers from across the heartland assembled in
the nation's capital on Monday to protest federal agricultural
policy.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the farmers' ire is directed at the 1996 farm law,
dubbed Freedom to Farm by its supporters. The law eliminated many
government controls on what crops farmers could grow and how many
acres they could plant, but it also eliminated many price supports
that had helped farmers survive bad times since the Great
Depression.
</P>
<P>
   Prices that farmers receive for corn, wheat, pork and other
commodities have fallen dramatically since the ``Freedom to Farm''
legislation was passed, and the disgruntled farmers want a return
to the so-called safety net of federal price supports.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to love farming better than I love to eat,'' said
Charles Harris, who grows corn, cotton and peanuts near Albany, Ga.
``But now it takes more to plant than you can get out.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris figures it costs him $3 a bushel to grow corn, but he can
only get $1.85 a bushel at market.
</P>
<P>
   ``But those people sitting in there, they don't care,'' he said,
gesturing toward the Capitol. ``How do they expect a man to live
with prices this low?''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the protesters had attended the 14th annual FarmAid
Concert on Sunday, where Willie Nelson, Neil Young, John Mellencamp
and other singers performed at a benefit concert in a Virginia
suburb.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though we've been going at this for 15 years, this is
just the beginning,'' Young promised the farmers at the Capitol
Hill rally. He called for a return to ``parity'' _ a long-abandoned
agricultural policy that guaranteed farmers a minimum price for
their crops based on the cost of production.
</P>
<P>
   ``If 'Freedom to Farm' doesn't go, the family farmers will,''
said Bill Christianson, a Missouri corn grower. ``You can't have
both.''
</P>
<P>
   The farmers blamed many of the problems in rural America on
corporate agricultural giants like Archer Daniels Midland,
Smithfield, Conagra, Tysons, and Cargill Inc. and Continental Grain
Co., which have announced plans to merge.
</P>
<P>
   These few, powerful ``multinational cartels'' are manipulating
the agricultural economy and squeezing out small family farmers,
the demonstrators charged.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is that an unregulated free market does not work for
_ nor does it exist _ in agriculture,'' said Keith Dittrich, a
Nebraska farmer and president of the American Corn Growers
Association. ``Our family farm system is about to be sacrificed,
and the only beneficiaries are the greedy multinational
corporations.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate approved $7.4 billion in emergency farm aid last
month to compensate growers for a second year of low commodity
prices, and the House Agriculture Committee will hold a hearing
Tuesday on the ``farm financial crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   But the trend toward bigger and fewer farms has continued for
over a century. Charles Harris can't afford to have any of his five
sons follow him onto this Georgia farm. Many families, like the
Senters, have already left their rural roots.
</P>
<P>
   ``I miss farming,'' admitted David Senter, who now lives in
Maryland and works as an organizer for FarmAid and other
agricultural causes. ``I was a fourth-generation farmer.''
</P>
<P>
   But the land he had expected to farm had to be sold to fund the
retirement of his parents. His daughter, Pattie, said he wishes
young Mason could grow up in a rural area like she did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liked living on the land better than in this big ol' rat
race,'' she said.

 &HT;    FEMA: HURRICANE DISASTER AID ALREADY IN PLACE
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON - Wherever Hurricane Floyd hits, the federal agency
responsible for emergencies says it won't be as tardy as it was
after Hurricane Andrew, seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of things going on that were not going on six
years ago,'' said Lacy Suiter, Federal Emergency Management
Agency's executive associate director.
</P>
<P>
   When Andrew slammed into Florida just south of Miami in August
1992, the tardy and disjointed federal response sparked cries of
anger from state and local authorities and prompted then-President
Bush to name his transportation secretary to coordinate the federal
effect.
</P>
<P>
   FEMA officials Monday said the agency has changed dramatically
since then. They said they were ready to roll and could have
supplies into an affected area within hours after the Floyd's
passage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The federal government is being not just reactive to events
and the requests of the governors, but we're being pro-active,''
Suiter said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not waiting until the hurricane comes ashore to buy the
ice and buy the water and get the generators ready and get the
other things ready to move out to the area. We're doing it now in
anticipation of what the requirements might be,'' Suiter said.
``We've been through this enough to know what to anticipate and
what to plan for.''
</P>
<P>
   FEMA emergency response centers have been activated in Atlanta,
Ga., and Washington, D.C., and it has representatives at state
emergency centers from Florida to North Carolina. A hurricane
liaison team of federal emergency officials is also stationed at
the National Hurricane Center in Miami to monitor the latest
forecasts of the storm's path and intensity.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, FEMA has positioned ice, water, plastic sheeting,
cots, tents, and emergency food and medial supplies in Atlanta
where they can be delivered within hours wherever Floyd hits land,
said Bruce Baughman, FEMA director of response.
</P>
<P>
   There are more than 30,000 rolls of plastic sheeting -- enough
to cover 25,000 roofless houses -- and some 100 tons of ice, he
said. The supplies are being kept in Atlanta, rather than closer to
where the hurricane might hit, in order to protect them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Depending on the track (taken by the storm) you don't want to
get it too far forward because the supplies themselves may become a
victim,'' Baughman said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the supplies on hand, FEMA has contracted with
suppliers to provide additional support such as debris removal,
roofing repairs and bulk water if needed, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the federal government is urging individuals to
prepare by making their property as hurricane-proof as possible
such as removing lawn furniture and listening to local government
warnings. Residents also are urged to check the FEMA website for
other tips at www.fema.gov.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a serious storm,'' Suiter said. ``It may be the worst
storm that we have had in many, many years.''

 &HT;    TERROR STRIKES MOSCOW AS BLAST LEVELS SECOND APARTMENT BLOCK
 &HT;    725&AMP;ADD
 &HT;    By CHARLES W. HOLMES 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Conceding that ``terrorism has declared war on us,''
President Boris Yeltsin on Monday ordered increased security across
Russia after an early-morning explosion leveled an eight-story
apartment building in Moscow, the second such devastating attack
here in the capital in five days.
</P>
<P>
   At least 70 people were killed, including six children, and
dozens were missing after a pre-dawn explosion flattened the
building in southern Moscow. Authorities said the blast was the
result of a bomb apparently planted on the first floor. A similar
explosion last Thursday ripped apart an apartment block on the
southeastern outskirts of the city, claiming 93 lives.
</P>
<P>
   While there were no plausible claims of responsibility for
either explosion, Russian authorities suspect the bombings are the
work of terrorists aligned with Muslim insurgents from the
breakaway republic of Chechnya. Federal troops have been engaged in
fierce battles against the guerrillas since last month, seeking to
drive them from the southern Russian republic of Dagestan.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever the culprits are, their campaign of terror was working.
</P>
<P>
   Nervous authorities strengthened controls at airports, oil
depots and nuclear power plants amid a widespread heightening of
security. Police street patrols and roadblocks were stepped up here
and other major cities.
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow _ a city of 10 million people, the vast majority of
them apartment dwellers _ residents were scared.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why is this happening? Who in Moscow will sleep soundly
tonight knowing such a thing could happen?'' said Vladimir
Alexandrov, 46, a store clerk who lives near the destroyed
building.
</P>
<P>
   In all, a string of four recent bombings have left more than 200
people dead. Apart from the apartment building explosions in
Moscow, a Russian military residence compound in Dagestan was
destroyed by a car bomb on Sept. 4, killing 64. In Moscow on Aug.
31, a bomb ripped through a crowded shopping mall near the Kremlin,
killing one and wounding dozens.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators have not concluded who was behind the Moscow
bombings, though they are searching for a man named Mukhit Laipanov
who allegedly had rented office space at both apartment buildings
destroyed by explosions.
</P>
<P>
   Theories have focused on Islamic militants seeking to bring the
war in the southern province of Dagestan to the Russian capital.
</P>
<P>
   But some politicians also have expressed concerns that the
bombings could be the work of ruthless political forces in Russia
out to disrupt national parliamentary elections scheduled for
December and the presidential election to chose Yeltsin' successor
set for next summer.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking on national television, Yeltsin appealed to Russians to
remain ``vigilant and calm'' as he promised a prompt and tough
response by the federal authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Extra police details were ordered to search the basements and
vacant apartments of buildings in the capital. Additional
roadblocks were set up to search vehicles and check identity
papers, particularly of those from the southern border region.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main aim of the bandits is to intimidate the people, to
sow panic and fear. I am sure they will not live to see that,''
Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has pledged to help Russia battle terrorism.
Defense Secretary William Cohen was visiting Moscow on Monday and
offered Russian officials ``to share whatever information we can to
share whatever abilities we have to wage an effective fight against
terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   Russian authorities believe Osama bin Laden _ accused of
masterminding the twin bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania last year _ is helping to bankroll the Muslim insurgents
in Dagestan. The guerrillas want independence for Dagestan, where
they intend to establish an Islamic state. Russia fought _ and lost
_ a similar bloody war in Chechnya from 1994 to 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin vowed ``tough, swift and decisive'' action in
investigating the explosions and protecting Russia's people. He
stopped short of declaring a national emergency, which would give
the Kremlin the sanction to impose martial law. Some of Yeltsin's
political rivals have feared he would use the authority of
emergency rule as a pretext to extend his final term in office,
which expires next summer.
</P>
<P>
   Monday had been declared a day of national mourning for the
victims of the Sept. 9 apartment blast and the Sept. 4 bombing of a
Russian military housing complex in Dagestan.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Muscovites awoke to a grim scene on their television screens as
emergency workers once again clawed their way through rubble and
twisted wreckage in a search for survivors. The brick building
destroyed Monday, on a busy highway in Moscow's southern fringes,
had 142 residents and about 30 had not been home at the time of the
blast, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   More than 300 workers searched the debris and one man was pulled
out alive and relatively unharmed. But the routine was more
gruesome as the workers slowly uncovered dead body after dead body
throughout the day and into the night.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anyone is left alive it would be an absolute miracle,''
said Vladimir Legofhin, a federal emergency services official.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, representing Russia at the
Asian-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in New Zealand, cut short
his trip to return to Moscow to deal with the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is difficult to refer to these people as humans,'' he said
of those responsible for the bombings. ``One can't even describe
them as animals. But if they are animals, then they are rabid
ones.''
</P>
<P>
   A Russian newspaper in an article in Monday's editions claimed
the Chechen guerrillas fighting Russian forces in Dagestan were
behind the bombings. The article in Novaya Gazeta had no sources,
but said the Chechen warlords had recruited about 30 ethnic Slavs _
some of them former Russian soldiers _ to carry out the bombing
campaign because they would not be conspicuous in Moscow or other
Russian cities, as would Muslims from the Caucasus region.
</P>
<P>
   But officials in Chechnya and a Muslim rebel leader in
neighboring Dagestan on Monday denied any involvement in the two
apartment-building explosions in Moscow.

VERDICT STILL NOT IN ON DYSLEXIA THERAPY
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: N.C., Va., Calif., Md., Va., Texas, Ill.)  (The Science Times) 
(ms) 
 By SANDRA BLAKESLEE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Four years ago, two scientists announced they had found a way to
repair a fundamental defect in the brains of children and adults
who fail to learn to read. They published articles in leading
scientific journals, raised venture capital and formed a company to
make their technique available to children, parents, teachers and
schools across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Billed as an entirely new way to treat dyslexia, the technique
uses repeated and fast-paced computer-generated exercises meant to
make nerve cells work faster. After several weeks, circuits in the
brain are reorganized in ways that are supposed to make it easier
to learn to read.
</P>
<P>
   Neuroscientists have long promised cures for brain and spinal
disorders that afflict millions of people: stroke, spinal cord
damage, Alzheimer's disease. If it works, its promoters say, the
new dyslexia therapy will be one of the first to make good on that
promise.
</P>
<P>
   So does it work? Today, nearly 20,000 children and several
hundred adults have gone through the intensive therapy, called Fast
ForWord, and one would think a verdict would be available.
</P>
<P>
   But the therapy has yet to be evaluated by independent
scientists. Virtually all the research on how well it works has
been carried out by Scientific Learning Inc. of Berkeley, Calif.,
the company that the two scientists founded to market it.
</P>
<P>
   Independent evaluations of several intervention programs,
including Fast ForWord, are now under way, but most results are
several years off. Dr. Reid Lyon, who is in charge of studies
sponsored by the National Institute of Child Health and Human
Development in Bethesda, Md., says this is a common pattern with
highly trumpeted educational innovations: Every technique being
marketed to schools and parents is said to be highly effective
mainly by people who stand to make money on it, and independent
assessments can lag years behind.
</P>
<P>
   And this is only part of the problem for the program's
proponents. Within the world of neuroscience, there is a fierce
debate over the nature of how language is encoded in the brain, how
it develops and what accounts for the fact the one in four children
has problems learning to read. Given this lack of consensus, many
educators and parents shy away from new therapies that are caught
up in bitter infighting among scientists.
</P>
<P>
   Scientific Learning, the company that pioneered the new
technique, is struggling to win acceptance in a very competitive
market. It offered stock for public sale in July after losing $10.7
million on sales of $5.1 million in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The central idea behind the new therapy stems from a
collaboration between Scientific Learning's two principal founders,
scientists who pioneered research in previously unrelated fields.
</P>
<P>
   One, Dr. Paula Tallal, a neuroscientist at the Newark, N.J.,
campus of Rutgers University, is an expert in phonological
processing _ how the sounds of language are encoded into the brain.
The other, Dr. Mike Merzenich, a neuroscientist at the University
of California Medical School at San Francisco, is a leading
authority on brain plasticity, the ease with which the brain can
reorganize and shape its circuits in response to learning.
</P>
<P>
   English has 26 letters and 44 sounds, or phonemes. All words are
made up of phonemes like ba and da or mu and nu. To learn to read,
a child must be able to sound out phonemes and build them into
words.
</P>
<P>
   But here's the rub. The brains of some children, right from
birth, cannot clearly hear phonemes that make rapid sound shifts.
For example, the sound ``ba'' starts with a ``b'' made by pressing
the lips together, and flows into ``aaaah'' made further back in
the mouth.
</P>
<P>
   The time between the ``b'' and ``aaaah'' is just 40 milliseconds
(a millisecond is one-thousandth of a second), but most babies can
hear it just fine, Tallal said. Some, however, need five times that
long _ 200 milliseconds or more _ to really hear such sounds. Other
phonemes, like mu, make slow sound shifts and do not create a
problem.
</P>
<P>
   Even the rapid phonemes do not prevent the babies with
impairments from learning to speak and understand; they compensate
by watching lips, learning words in context and other techniques
invented on the fly. Most do fine, until it is time to read.
</P>
<P>
   Here is where Merzenich's work in brain plasticity comes in.
Babies' brains are highly plastic, he says. But once a brain
circuit is laid down, subsequent repetitions tend to reinforce it.
</P>
<P>
   In hearing about Tallal's work, Merzenich realized that many
children who cannot learn to read have inscribed brain circuits
that are constantly compensating for what they cannot hear clearly.
They get ``good'' at being ``bad'' at language. Such children will
not be able to sound out words until they learn to distinguish
``ba'' from ``da'' and all other phonemes.
</P>
<P>
   Thus came the patented invention of processed speech, a key
innovation at Scientific Learning. (It holds the patent jointly
with Rutgers and the San Francisco medical school.)
</P>
<P>
   The human voice cannot stretch the time between ``b'' and
``aaaah'' so that children with timing problems can hear it. But a
computer can.
</P>
<P>
   By stretching fast phonemes so that children can hear the
difference between ``ba'' and ``da'' for the first time, the
scientists laid the basis for changing their brains.
</P>
<P>
   In colorful computer games and exercises with hundreds of
variables and tens of thousands of repetitions, children gradually
force their brains to hear these blurry phonemes faster and faster.
In the training, children sit at a computer for 100 minutes a day,
five days a week, for six to eight weeks. Scientific Learning
charges a fee of $850 per child; schools or parents must also hire
a professional to administer the program.
</P>
<P>
   Good attendance is mandatory. At the end of each day, the
computer evaluates each child's progress and establishes the next
day's lesson plans based on progress made the day before.
</P>
<P>
   The games work on more than timing, said Dr. Steve Miller, a
neuroscientist who also helped found the company. They are designed
to help children remember what they hear, to be aware that sounds
are parts of words, to follow commands, pay attention and express
ideas in a story line.
</P>
<P>
   Tallal compared the approach to ``full-body aerobics versus
training one muscle group at a time.'' But she added, ``It's not a
cure for dyslexia.'' The training repairs a brain defect by
altering brain organization, she said; this does not translate into
an immediate ability to read, but it lays the foundation for
learning how to read.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   This is a claim under close scrutiny by scientists outside the
company. For example, Dr. Guinevere Eden, a neuroscientist at
Georgetown University in Washington, and colleagues at George Mason
University in Fairfax, Va., are imaging the brains of children
before and after Fast ForWord training. The study has not been
published, but Eden said she could discuss general findings.
</P>
<P>
   The children's brains do get faster at the types of exercises
given by the computer, she said. But there is no evidence yet that
this translates into an enhanced ability to learn to read. ``This
is what parents want to know,'' Eden said, ``and we don't have the
answer.''
</P>
<P>
   Many conventional reading intervention programs are extremely
good and can produce excellent results, said Lyon, of the National
Institute of Child Health. They tend to work with children in
one-on-one settings and use a variety of approaches to stimulate
the brain and the senses of sight, hearing and touch.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, he said, Fast ForWord is an entirely novel
approach. And many speech pathologists, teachers, educators and
children give it glowing reviews. ``My kids have been through many
intervention programs but none gave them as many gains as Fast
ForWord,'' said Donise Pearson, president-elect of the Texas
chapter of the Speech and Hearing Association, an organization of
professional speech therapists. ``Parents report almost
unbelievable changes in their children's behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Rita Gardner, principal of Shields Elementary School in Chicago,
said: ``I'm a real believer. Many kids are in la-la land. You talk
to them and they don't follow what you say. You give them lots of
interventions and there are still holes in their learning. With
Fast ForWord, it's like a light went on.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite such comments, the new therapy has not been endorsed by
many speech and language researchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The training may have effects on some children, but not for
the reasons they suppose,'' said Dr. Michael Studdert-Kennedy, past
president of the Haskins Laboratories, a center for the study of
speech and language at Yale University.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's absolutely no evidence that there's a timing
disorder'' in the brains of children who are slow to read, he said,
adding that the failure to read is related to defects in parts of
the brain that are specialized for language and have little to do
with awareness of sound.
</P>
<P>
   As for Merzenich's claim that the Fast ForWord technique is
rapidly reshaping the plasticity of the brain, ``that's an absurd
stunt'' that will not help anyone learn to read, Studdert-Kennedy
said, adding: ``Obviously, there are changes in the brain after
intense training. Everything you do changes the brain.''
</P>
<P>
   Parents and teachers looking for dispassionate advice on whom to
believe can turn to a nonprofit group, All Kinds of Minds, based in
Chapel Hill, N.C., founded by a pediatrician at the University of
North Carolina, Dr. Mel Levine. The organization disseminates
scientific knowledge about learning disorders.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will never be one intervention for all kids,'' Levine
said. ``In medicine, we've never found one antibiotic that works
for all infections. Researchers need to be aware of which subgroups
of children they can help. The physician in me knows that things
can break in many places.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe Fast ForWord found one such place,'' he added. ``That
alone is important.''

ADS RAISE QUESTIONS ABOUT MILK AND BONES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Wis., N.Y., Mass., S.D.)   (The Science Times)  
 (af)  
 By MARY MURRAY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was nowhere near as splashy or ubiquitous as the ``Got
Milk?'' advertising campaign, with all those celebrities and their
milk mustaches. But the advertisements that greeted riders of the
Washington Metro and newspaper readers in Wisconsin and upstate New
York last spring were arresting: They showed a picture of a woman
being fitted with a full-arm cast beside the headline ``Milk Does
Not Protect Against Bone Breaks.''
</P>
<P>
   That is hardly conventional wisdom. Milk may not agree with you
(if you are lactose intolerant), or may make you gain weight (if
you have not switched to skim). But doesn't it at least help build
strong bones and prevent osteoporosis, the deterioration of bone
tissue that comes with advancing age?
</P>
<P>
   Most American doctors and scientists say it does _ along with
the United States Department of Agriculture and the dairy industry,
which are trying to encourage Americans to return to the dairy
case.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the mustache advertisements, milk consumption has
dropped 25 percent per capita since 1970. Public health officials
say this is an important reason only 1 in 3 Americans _ and only 1
in 10 women _ gets the recommended daily intake of calcium, a
critical element in maintaining bone mass.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent years, a vigorous campaign by some vegetarian and
animal protection groups, along with new research suggesting that
even a lifetime of milk drinking may not be sufficient to guard
against bone disease, has put milk's advocates on the defensive and
left consumers wondering who is right.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at the research,'' said T. Colin Campbell, a
nutritional biochemist at Cornell University who is on the board of
the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, the organization
responsible for the antimilk advertisements, ``you have to start
wondering what it is about this food. Is it really as good as we've
been told?''
</P>
<P>
   Both sides agree that people need calcium, not only for building
bones but also for managing such day-to-day cellular activities as
contracting muscles, maintaining the nervous system and absorbing
vitamin B12. They also agree that milk packs a fairly high dose of
calcium: 300 milligrams in an eight-ounce glass.
</P>
<P>
   But they emphatically disagree when it comes to osteoporosis, a
disease that leads to a million and a half bone fractures a year,
at a cost of $14 billion in health care and lost wages. The most
contentious issue is to what degree the calcium in milk can fortify
bones and, as a result, prevent fractures in the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of milk say that because people can also get calcium
from many other foods, including tofu, turnip greens, black-eyed
peas and bok choy, it makes no sense to focus on milk.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is complicated by the fact, also accepted by both
sides, that calcium is not the only factor in osteoporosis. Other
nutrients, including vitamin D, magnesium, phosphorus and zinc,
help build bones. Smoking and immoderate alcohol consumption can
weaken bones.
</P>
<P>
   Genetic predisposition plays a key role in osteoporosis. And
scientists are increasingly coming to appreciate the importance of
exercise in making a sturdy skeleton.
</P>
<P>
   So what exactly does milk do? Diane Feskanich, a nutritional
epidemiologist, addressed this question as part of her work on
Harvard's large and continuing Nurses' Health Study. She observed
about 78,000 nurses over 12 years, asking them about their lifelong
milk consumption, monitoring their diets and keeping track of their
bone fractures. Contrary to expectations, she found that the women
who drank two or more glasses of milk a day had a ``modest but
significantly increased risk'' of hip and forearm fracture compared
with those who drank less milk.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is exactly the opposite of what the dairy industry would
suggest,'' said Dr. Neal Barnard, founder of the Physicians
Committee for Responsible Medicine. ``I can't imagine anyone
actually dissing this study. The difference in fracture rates was
statistically significant.''
</P>
<P>
   Milk defenders argue that Dr. Feskanich's study was only one
study, and that it was inconclusive because the researchers did not
actually control the subjects' calcium intake but merely asked them
about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``That type of study is very valuable for making hypotheses, but
it doesn't establish cause and effect,'' said Bess Dawson-Hughes,
director of the Calcium and Bone Metabolism Laboratory at Tufts
University in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Feskanich, who avoids taking sides in the milk debate,
agrees that her study did not show that calcium consumption causes
osteoporosis, but it did at least raise the question of whether
consuming a lot of the mineral can prevent fractures.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be that the benefits that have been seen for calcium,
which are strong, might not be of enough magnitude to prevent hip
fractures,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   More useful, say milk advocates, are the dozens of random
controlled trials in which one group of test subjects is given
calcium supplements and the other group is given placebos. Then,
after a year or two, their bone density is measured, or their
fractures are counted.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Dawson-Hughes says dozens of such studies, some of which she
has conducted, provide conclusive evidence that calcium can help
prevent bone loss and fractures. Her colleague Dr. Robert P. Heaney
cited a study of 1,800 elderly French women, which found that those
who took calcium supplements had 30-percent fewer hip fractures
than those who did not take the supplements.
</P>
<P>
   It was such evidence that two years ago led Drs. Heaney and
Dawson-Hughes and their fellow members of the National Academy of
Sciences calcium committee to raise the recommended dietary intake
of calcium by 50 percent for older Americans. The official
recommendation now stands at 1,200 milligrams a day (the amount in
four glasses of milk) for men and women age 51 and older, 1,000
milligrams a day for adults 19 through 50, and 1,300 milligrams a
day for children 9 through 18.
</P>
<P>
   It is in childhood that bones grow most, in length and in mass.
When children consume calcium, they absorb 75 percent of it into
their bones. By the time they reach their 20s, the absorption drops
to 30 percent to 50 percent. At this point, the calcium is used not
to build but to maintain bone density, to replace the calcium that
is lost as the bones constantly rebuild themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you reach adulthood, what you're trying to do with
calcium is minimize the rate of loss,'' Dr. Dawson-Hughes said. For
women, menopause marks the beginning of relatively rapid bone
deterioration, as much as 3 percent a year, caused by a drop in
estrogen, which helps maintain bone mass. Eighty percent of the 10
million Americans with osteoporosis are women.
</P>
<P>
   ``Calcium isn't the only thing that's needed,'' Dr.
Dawson-Hughes said, ``but you're going to lose without it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Campbell, the nutritional biochemist at Cornell, points out
that in other countries, including China, where he has done
research, women consume significantly less calcium than American
women yet suffer fewer fractures late in life. If calcium is so
important, he asked, how can that be? ``If you look at intakes of
calcium around the world, you find the higher the intakes, the
higher the osteoporosis rates,'' he said. ``Dairy won't protect
against osteoporosis.''
</P>
<P>
   He and other antidairy scientists suggest that high calcium
intake may actually cause osteoporosis, by conditioning bones to
become too efficient at unloading the mineral.
</P>
<P>
   But advocates of milk argue that comparisons to other countries
prove nothing about calcium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Asian women, until very recently, have been disproportionately
rural,'' said Eileen T. Kennedy, a deputy under secretary of
Agriculture who has studied nutrition in Asia. ``They're more
physically active, they have long workdays, they have more
vegetables in their diet, and there's no smoking and no alcohol. To
say they have less osteoporosis because they don't drink milk is
simplistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Both sides agree that calcium intake is not the only factor in
bone health. Exercise is also important in the prevention of
fractures. Elderly people who exercise build muscle strength, which
leads to greater coordination, fewer falls and, as a result, fewer
broken bones.
</P>
<P>
   Regular exercise also works with calcium to strengthen bone
tissue. Bonny L. Specker, a professor of nutrition at South Dakota
State University in Brookings, analyzed 17 studies of physical
activity and bone density and found that exercise did not
contribute to bone density unless people also consumed at least
1,100 milligrams of calcium a day.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, people who consumed large amounts of calcium but
were sedentary did not build bone. ``Calcium isn't going to do any
good if you're lying on the couch doing nothing,'' Dr. Specker
said. ``And exercise doesn't help you if you have inadequate
calcium. They both work together.''
</P>
<P>
   How much exercise does it take to build strong bones? Most
experts suggest following the Surgeon General's guidelines: half an
hour of exercise a day, five days a week. But the exercise must be
``weight bearing,'' in which the body is not supported against
gravity; swimming and cycling are less effective than walking,
jogging, lifting weights or jumping rope.
</P>
<P>
   When you're finished, go ahead and have a glass of ... something
cold to drink. &QL;

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Heavy showers and gusty winds will begin to affect the Southeast
Coast Tuesday as Hurricane Floyd brings damaging winds and heavy
rain to the Bahamas. High clouds will become more abundant during
the morning from southeastern Virginia to the east coast of Florida
as Floyd approaches. In addition, the strong winds of the hurricane
will create very large swells, leading to increased beach erosion
to the Southeast Coast. Indeed, portions of the Outer Banks of
North Carolina that were recently ravaged for an extended period by
Hurricane Dennis will once again be pounded by heavy surf from
Hurricane Floyd.
</P>
<P>
   Father north, a weakening cold front will cross the Northeastern
states. A narrow band of clouds and some scattered showers will
accompany the front in the northern Appalachians. Following another
cool start, much of New England will have readings near normal
under ample sun. To the south, sunshine will abound from the Ohio
Valley to the Tennessee Valley as high pressure builds into the
region. Meanwhile, a jet stream disturbance will continue to slowly
trek north of the Great Lakes, bringing unseasonably cool air and
scattered showers to the northern Plains and western Lakes.
</P>
<P>
   In the West, a weak disturbance passing through the southern
Rockies will trigger a few showers and an occasional rumble of
thunder in the deserts of Nevada and Utah. Meanwhile, winds blowing
up the sloping terrain east of the Rockies will lead to showers and
clouds in north Texas. Offshore breezes in the Northwest will
weaken, allowing a few clouds to return to the coast.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: On the Cusp
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Hurricane Floyd was on the cusp of entering the
fiercest class of the most powerful storm on earth. Hurricanes are
categorized according to the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale which
is based primarily on the highest winds near the storm's center.
Sunday, with sustained winds of 155 mph, Hurricane Floyd was at the
top of Category Four. Category Five storms have winds over 155 mph
Only two Category Five hurricanes have reached the U.S. coast this
century, the Labor Day storm of 1935 in the Florida Keys and
Hurricane Camille on the Mississippi coast in 1969.

' TIS: FOR AN OUTSIDER, IT'S MOSTLY SOUR GRAPES IN THE LAND OF

<P>
   In Frank McCourt's luminous 1996 memoir, ``Angela's Ashes,'' the
dream of America beckoned like a bright fairy-tale promise to the
author sunk in a miserable childhood in Limerick, Ireland.
Listening to Billie Holiday on the radio, the young McCourt would
think: ``Oh, Billie, Billie, I want to be in America with you and
all that music, where no one has bad teeth, people leave food on
their plates, every family has a lavatory, and everyone lives
happily ever after.''
</P>
<P>
   In `` 'Tis,'' the eagerly awaited sequel to ``Angela's Ashes,''
that dream seems to have come true _ at least, the 19-year-old
McCourt has made it to New York and launched himself on a new life
that will eventually see him becoming a writer and a public high
school teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Despite such developments, `` 'Tis'' is a considerably angrier
book than ``Angela's Ashes.'' Whereas that ``epic of woe'' was
remarkable for its lack of bitterness and self-pity, `` 'Tis'' is
largely animated by the feelings of resentment and envy that the
young McCourt experienced in trying to overcome his family's legacy
of poverty and deprivation. Given the difficulties he faced, it's
hard to begrudge him such emotions; it's just that this sour tone
of complaint does not make for particularly engaging or sympathetic
reading.
</P>
<P>
   McCourt recounts how he frequently walked about New York with
what his mother would have called ``the gloomy puss,'' grappling
with his ``daily deadly sin, Envy.'' Working as a janitor in the
Biltmore Hotel, he resents the privileged young people he sees
there, wishing he could break his ``dustpan and broom over their
heads till blood spurted and they begged me to stop.'' And
listening to Columbia students talk about existentialism, he wishes
his parents ``had lived respectable lives and sent me to college so
that I could spend my time in bars and cafeterias telling everyone
how I admired Camus for his daily invitation to suicide and
Hemingway for risking the bull's horn in the side.''
</P>
<P>
   He resents the grandmother of his girlfriend, Mike Small, for
having ``plenty of food and drink and clothes and furniture and hot
and cold running water and no shortage of money''; and when he
becomes an English teacher at Stuyvesant High School, he resents
his students, ``the privileged, the chosen, the pampered,'' for
being able to go to school, ``get into a money-making racket'' and
grow into their ``fat 40s.''
</P>
<P>
   When he marries Mike, he complains that he didn't know how to be
``a certified member of the middle class'' _ he didn't know ``how
to dress, how to chatter of the stock market at parties, how to
play squash or golf'' _ and when that marriage collapses, he
complains that ``slum-reared Irish Catholics have nothing in common
with nice girls from New England who had little curtains at their
bedroom windows.'' Never mind that he turned his wedding day into
an alcohol-fueled debacle, or frequently stayed out drinking with
friends instead of coming home to dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly McCourt's feelings of class rage stem not only from
his harrowing childhood, described so indelibly in ``Angela's
Ashes'' (three siblings who died in infancy, a father who drank
away the family's food money, a mother reduced to begging), but
also from the daunting hardships he faced in New York: having to
work several jobs (at warehouses and on the docks) to make ends
meet, having to live in cramped boarding houses where as many as 12
men shared two towels, having to use an extension cord to borrow
electricity from a neighbor to stay warm in the winter.
</P>
<P>
   Although such descriptions are enlivened by McCourt's resilient
sense of humor, they do not possess the lyricism or searing
intimacy that fueled his childhood reminiscences in ``Angela's
Ashes.'' For that matter, the narrative of this volume is largely
reactive: Instead of the formative dramas that shaped the young
McCourt's life, instead of his conjuring of the remote world of
small-town Ireland, we are simply given his responses to a familiar
New York. We repeatedly hear about the embarrassment he feels over
his bad eyes and pronounced accent, the shame he feels over his
ignorance of American social mores, and the sense of alienation he
experiences as an immigrant and perpetual outsider.
</P>
<P>
   As for the supporting cast of `` 'Tis,'' it's made up mainly of
friends and eccentrics encountered during McCourt's peregrinations
around New York. There's Andy Peters, a fellow NYU student who
works part time at Manufacturers Trust Co. and who changes a few
loan applications every night ``to prove how stupid a bank can
be.'' There's Bill Galetly, a friend who uses McCourt's apartment
as a crash pad, babbling endlessly into the night about Plato and
St. John and his own desire to lose weight and get down to a
hundred pounds. And there's Harry Ball, an 85-year-old neighbor who
spends many of his days sitting in an aluminum beach chair near his
car, scouting possible parking spots for the following day.
</P>
<P>
   Though these cameo sketches attest to McCourt's instinctive
storytelling gifts, they cannot compete with the wonderfully
nuanced portraits he drew of his parents in ``Angela's Ashes.'' In
`` 'Tis,'' McCourt's Mam and Dad appear only intermittently, and
they seem to spark in him an ambivalent mixture of rage and
irritation and dismay. By the end of the book, both of them are
dead, and McCourt and his brothers, Malachy, Michael and Alphie,
are all embarked on lives of their own in the United States.
McCourt has begun to enjoy his work as a teacher, and he has begun
to dream about becoming a writer _ like the well-known poets and
novelists whose book jackets he sees on the walls of the Lion's
Head bar in Greenwich Village.
</P>
<P>
   He would achieve that dream at the age of 66 with ``Angela's
Ashes,'' a book that would win the Pulitzer Prize and become a No.
1 best seller.
</P>
<P>
   As his mother, Angela, might say: ``That's your dream out now.''

   WALDOBORO, Maine _ Still lifes of dead fish adorn the walls. A
stern bronze bust of the abolitionist and suffragist leader Parker
Pillsbury is draped with a vintage 1940s necktie patterned in
warplanes. Over the staircase hangs an ancient political artifact,
``The Official Ronald Reagan Doormat.''
</P>
<P>
   Tradition treads lightly here at the eclectic, contemporary home
of The Maine Antique Digest, widely called ``M.A.D.'' (not to be
confused with the satirical magazine Mad). A family-run newspaper
with two staff reporters and an army of freelancers and tipsters,
this independent, influential and successful monthly manages the
trick of policing as well as serving the nation's unruly
multibillion-dollar annual trade in antiques and collectibles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people we've done tough stories on advertise and are
friendly with us,'' said the publication's patriarch and publisher,
Samuel Pennington, 70, a scrappy and folksy editor in khakis and
sneakers who straddles cyberspace and newsprint to cover the
industry and search out scandal. Of course, not everyone is always
charmed with the results.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, after a federal mail fraud investigation and
guilty plea in a case exposed by The Maine Antique Digest, Charles
G. Moore, a New York auctioneer, was sentenced to two years in
prison and ordered to pay $584,000 in restitution for defrauding
people who had consigned him antiques and artworks for sale.
</P>
<P>
   But the paper sometimes stumbles. July's issue had just gone out
with a long article by a prominent dealer in Civil War artifacts,
Russ Pritchard III, when a civil jury in federal court leveled an
$800,000 judgment against him in the purchase and lucrative resale
of items from George E. Pickett V, a descendant of the Confederate
general who led a disastrous charge at the Battle of Gettysburg.
``Timing is everything,'' the paper editorialized red-facedly,
noting at the same time that lawsuits were a fact of life in the
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got a couple of snide letters,'' acknowledged Pennington.
``The snider the letter, the further up we print it.''
</P>
<P>
   But the paper is also busily serving an industry aboom with new
electronic salesrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Dealers and collectors need only log on to the paper's Web page
(www.maineantiquedigest.com), for example, to register and call up
images of 13,000 objects and their prices, an explosion of data
generally welcomed in the trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet and electronic media have come into this
business, I could not believe how fast,'' said Pennington, tilting
back in a swivel chair in an office cluttered with publications,
old airplane models, sculptures and what he calls his ``dead-fish
paintings,'' his meager concession to collecting. Dealers, he said,
no longer have to sit in their shops waiting for customers to walk
through the door. In the process, The Digest has already lost some
advertising to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   But far from fighting the trend, the 26-year-old paper,
published in this quiet mid-coast community of 4,500 west of
Rockland, has joined it, with its Web site and Internet ad sales
and with the purchase of a 10 percent share in Ehammer, an online
auction service.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the heart of the operation remains the newspaper, a
no-frills product in black and white that is hardly likely to win
awards for design, not that Pennington cares about that. A lesson
he learned early in the publishing business, he said, was: ``Never
give them more than they'll pay for.''

</P>
<P>
   Priced at $3.75, the paper, which has been as big as 408 pages
in nine sections, bulges with ads, photos, show and auction news
and scattered investigative articles. The October issue, about to
be mailed out, contains an advisory about pseudo-antique iron
snakes.
</P>
<P>
   Hard reporting has helped make The Digest a mainstay of the
antiques field, with wide reach. Circulation is at a high of
33,000, almost all by subscription. ``It's an essential tool in the
field of Americana because of its access to the marketplace,'' said
Gerard C. Wertkin, director of the Museum of American Folk Art in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988 Pennington served as guest curator of an exhibition of
folk art fakes and forgeries, presented by the folk art museum at
Hirschl &AMP; Adler Folk, a gallery on Madison Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Sanford Smith, a producer and manager of art and antiques shows,
including the Fall Antiques Show at the Seventh Regiment Armory in
New York, said The Maine Antique Digest was ``the only paper in the
American art field that actually does investigative reporting.''
</P>
<P>
   There are many other antiques newspapers, magazines and
newsletters, including another family enterprise, The Antiques and
the Arts Weekly of the Bee Publishing Company in Newtown, Conn.,
which happily leaves the feather ruffling to The Digest.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as digging into personalities, we leave that up to
Sam,'' said R. Scudder Smith, the weekly's publisher and editor,
who was the first to accept ads for Pennington's upstart
publication. ``Our policy is if it's between two people, it's not
public business. Let them work it out themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Smith said, ``I think Sam's on the right track.''
</P>
<P>
   To Pennington and his family _ his wife, Sally, is on the
masthead, along with three of their five grown children _ there is
nothing anomalous about applying high technology to the antiques
trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole antiques business is a matter of transportation,''
he said, ``getting something from where it isn't valuable to where
it is.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an imperfect market,'' he said. ``The stock market is
perfect. One share is the same as another.'' But with no such
standardization in the antiques market, ``information is the key
factor,'' Pennington said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a dealer myself,'' he said, ``I found it easier to sell to
someone in the know than someone who didn't know.''
</P>
<P>
   As a child in Baltimore, Pennington grew up with antiques in a
Victorian house left to his great-aunt and grandmother. ``They were
Tilghmans,'' he said. ``Lots of lineage, no money.''
</P>
<P>
   His father was a car salesman, his mother a teacher. The
furniture in the house was so old, he recalled, that once a year a
cabinetmaker came in with his gluepot to make repairs. Then during
the Depression the family lost it all.
</P>
<P>
   He rediscovered antiques when he was stationed in Bangor, Maine,
as a navigator in the Air Force. In 1959 he and his wife bought a
1775 house in Waldoboro and began raising a family. Later they
opened an antiques shop. ``There's no real entry barrier,'' he
said. ``You can open a business with one object.''
</P>
<P>
   During the Vietnam War he served on Guam and in Thailand, making
B-52 bombing runs over the Ho Chi Minh Trail, an effort he now
derides as futile, ``really dumb.'' He retired from the Air Force
in 1973 and the family moved into the house in Waldoboro while he
sought financing for his antiques publication and opened a
furniture-restoring business. ``It's amazing what you can teach
yourself,'' Pennington said.
</P>
<P>
   He started The Maine Antiques Digest just as offset printing was
revolutionizing publishing. By a stroke of luck, he said, the debut
issue of 28 pages contained a last-minute article by a noted Maine
antiques dealer, Chris Huntington, that drew widespread attention
for its inside information and candor.
</P>
<P>
   The logo consisted of a rooster weather vane that provided the
``i'' in Antique, and the word was not given an ``s'' but kept
singular so that it would fit more neatly above ``Digest.'' ``I got
a complaint from a teacher that it was grammatically incorrect,''
Pennington recalled. ``But I said it was a beautiful logo, and it
fits.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple lived on Pennington's $12,000-a-year Air Force
pension, and the ads covered his business expenses. ``It took three
years to make money, but at least it didn't cost us anything,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The couple divided responsibilities. ``I did the business
letters, he went on the road,'' Mrs. Pennington recalled in her own
office, which is decorated with women's rights memorabilia. ``We
made it clear neither one would be boss over the other.''
</P>
<P>
   With a typewriter and three cameras and a load of floodlights
and backdrops, Pennington drove to dealers from Vermont to
Connecticut, photographing their stock free for ads in the first
issue. A full-page ad cost $100 at the beginning. (It is now $750.)
</P>
<P>
   He also wrote the news articles, sometimes adopting a pseudonym
so the paper would not look like the one-man show it was. One name
he chose was Lance Poulet, for chicken on a stick: his weather
vane. But he said he always kept a strict division between the ads
and editorial copy.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to keep them separate,'' he said. ``Otherwise you get
no respect.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1975 he hired his first reporter, Lita Solis-Cohen of
Philadelphia, a writer on antiques for The Philadelphia Inquirer
and other publications who was to burn out four computers in a
torrent of reporting. She soon began breaking exclusives. ``People
call and tell us things, and we pinch ourselves,'' she said. ``Why
are they telling us this? Because we do it fairly.''
</P>
<P>
   Her greatest scoop came in 1985, when a collector tipped her off
that he had been offered the Holy Grail of American collecting: a
copy of ``Oath of a Free Man,'' a broadside printed by the
Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1639 that was known only by references
in other documents; no copy had ever been found. It turned out to
be a forgery, but it put Ms. Solis-Cohen and The Digest's other
staff reporter, David Hewitt, on the trail of the nation's most
notorious forger, Mark Hofmann, who had also fabricated
embarrassing Mormon Church documents and killed two people with
bombs before the schemes unraveled and he was sent to prison for
life.
</P>
<P>
   Pennington, meanwhile, was dazzled enough by his success to
attempt a local weekly general-interest newspaper. But his appetite
for dogged reporting provoked a backlash when he insisted on
delving into the suicide of a local police officer who, in a
strange twist, had caught his wife with an older man.
</P>
<P>
   Pennington also ran into opposition closer to home, from his
wife, when he wanted to photograph a woman who collapsed and died
at a town hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I say she gave up her right to privacy when she died at a
public meeting,'' he said. Mrs. Pennington threatened to sue her
husband and went so far as to consult a lawyer. ``So I backed
down,'' Pennington said.
</P>
<P>
   The weekly lost $90,000 over three years before he shut it down
in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985 Pennington moved The Maine Antique Digest out of leased
quarters and into a new, high-ceilinged 6,200-square-foot building
he built on Main Street. Soon afterward he sold his 1775 house and
built a new one, along the lines of The Digest's building. ``Old
buildings are for young people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 he ran for the school board, which covers five towns in
two counties, and won a three-year term. ``He's become an important
citizen,'' said a neighbor, the art critic Hilton Kramer, who lives
part of the year in Waldoboro.
</P>
<P>
   In a concession to mortality, five years ago Pennington hired
his son, Sam, a college drama graduate called by his middle name,
Clayton, to avoid confusion in the office, and handed him the
editing reins this year. A daughter, Kate, is managing editor, and
another daughter, Sarah McCleary, is business manager. Two other
daughters do not work at the paper but are also shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife and I each own _ what do we own?'' Pennington shouted
to his wife in the next room.
</P>
<P>
   ``We each own 35 percent,'' she replied. ``The five kids each
own 6 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But that's not voting stock,'' Pennington said.

SENDING UP TALKS SHOWS (SORT OF)

 By CARYN JAMES   
<TEXT>
<P>
   At its hilarious best, which it often was during the first 40
minutes of its premiere Monday, Martin Short's new comedy-talk show
is like a fresh edition of ``Saturday Night Live'' with interviews.
Always funniest when he is mocking types, especially show-business
types, Short turned up as half a dozen characters in the filmed
sketches that are the most engaging part of the show.
</P>
<P>
   He played Martina Navratilova as a secret agent, swinging her
tennis racket and stomping on a villain with her enormous feet, in
a failed television pilot called ``La Femme Martina.'' For a spoof
of tabloid television called ``Prime Time Edition Tonight,'' he did
a wickedly funny impression of Janeane Garofalo campaigning to save
a serial killer. And he was engagingly sly as himself, wading into
the audience singing ``Too Marvelous for Words'' and pulling off a
supposed audience member's toupee.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its promise, though, there is a big question the show
has yet to figure out: How do you mock show biz and remain a
mainstream part of it? The more straightforward Monday's show
became, which it did with a nose dive in the last 20 minutes, the
flatter it seemed. The future of ``The Martin Short Show''
(syndicated nationally) will depend on how cleverly he can satirize
talk shows even while he is doing one.
</P>
<P>
   With a cast of little-known comic performers, the show promises
plenty of sketches. The glimpses of failed television pilots were
among the best moments. There was ``Mike Angelo, Police Sculptor,''
about a temperamental artist who chisels likenesses of suspects out
of marble, and ``The Falsettos,'' about mobsters with high-pitched
voices.
</P>
<P>
   With his first guest, Billy Crystal, Short showed too many clips
from their ``Saturday Night Live'' days. They redeemed themselves
by breaking into a brief version of ``Kate and Ali,'' a goof on the
old ``Kate and Ally'' show, with Kate Hepburn and Muhammad Ali as
roommates. It was almost a throwaway, but any time Short does his
priceless Hepburn impression and Crystal his Ali it's a treat.
</P>
<P>
   When Short veered away from comedy, though, it became apparent
the talk-show mold wasn't being shattered after all. The last
segments were so conventional, anyone could have been sitting in
the host's chair, on the bland living-room set. The model and
actress Rebecca Romijn-Stamos brought a clip of her appearance on
``Just Shoot Me.'' Clips are not a good sign for the future. When
the author of a book about survival techniques demonstrated how to
cook a chicken in a backpack with hot rocks, Short tried futilely
to wring some laughter out of it.
</P>
<P>
   The television landscape is cluttered with the bodies of recent
talk shows that are dead (``The Howie Mandel Show'') or dying
(``Roseanne''). What ``The Martin Short Show'' has in its favor is
its star's great satiric imagination and some inventive friends.
Tuesday's scheduled guest is Steve Martin, who uses a talk show as
an excuse for sketch comedy better than anyone. (His routines with
David Letterman are classics.) If viewers are lucky, Short will
come up with a long list of guests willing to play along with him
rather than slog through the usual talk-show babble.  &QL;

 &HT;    CIVIL RIGHTS GROUP SAYS CLINTON LOST HIS NERVE ON SCHOOL REFORM
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox Newspapers
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON The Clinton administration's ``massive failure of
will and nerve'' lets many states illegally use lower academic
standards for poor inner-city children than for middle-class
suburban children, charges a report issued Monday by the private
Citizens' Commission on Civil Rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is sheer nonsense,'' responded David Frank, director of
public affairs for the Department of Education.
</P>
<P>
   Such a policy could leave poor children, many of them from
racial and ethnic minorities, under-educated at a time when most
decent jobs require advanced skills in reading and math.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (Elementary and Secondary Education) Act was passed in
October 1994 and the Republicans won control of Congress in
November 1994,'' said William L. Taylor, vice chair of the
30-year-old watchdog group. ``From then on, major elements of the
act were ignored by the department.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he suspected that the Democratic administration eased up
on regulation of the states in order to have as many allies as
possible in its epic battle during 1995 and 1996 with the House GOP
majority, which was trying to abolish the Department of Education,
end federal regulation of public schools and slash federal
education spending by as much as 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The commission concluded: ``The bad news is that the Clinton
administration, once a prime advocate of standards-based reform,
has since had a massive failure of will and nerve.''
</P>
<P>
   ``On the contrary,'' replied Frank, `` There's been a sea
change, and 48 states already have statewide assessments in
place,'' although federal law doesn't require that until 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging that state standards ``are to some extent
uneven,'' he said the administration has ``urged rigorous state
standards,'' and has asked Congress to require that school
districts spread their resources, including assignments for the
best-qualified teachers, more evenly between schools in affluent
and poor neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   But the 169-page report stated: ``In the administration's
readiness to countenance differing standards and expectations for
children one set for children in more affluent suburbs and another
for poor children in inner cities there are disturbing echoes of
the old racially dual systems of education that the Supreme Court
(outlawed) in Brown v. Board of Education, and of the two-tiered
system of advanced versus basic education that the 1994 Title I
reforms were designed to eliminate.''
</P>
<P>
   Title I is the section of the 1994 act through which the federal
government splits more than $8 billion a year among the 50 states
for use in bolstering academic performance in schools with many
poor children.
</P>
<P>
   The act requires that a state accepting Title I funds create a
single set of high standards for all its students and public
schools, and require them to make progress toward those standards.
</P>
<P>
   States like California, Colorado, Maine and Missouri allowed
districts to pick their own ways of assessing academic performance,
which often meant that wealthy districts had higher standards than
poor districts, the commission said. Some others adopted vague
standards, or tests that were not aligned with what was being
taught in their schools.

 &HT;    3 questions with ... Richard Chamberlain
 &HT;    By Kathy Janich
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When you hear the voice, the characters come flashing
back. Young Dr. Kildare. The tormented Father Ralph de Bricassart.
The manly John Blackthorne.
</P>
<P>
   The voice is the same, but the actor, Richard Chamberlain, is no
longer a boyish intern at Blair General taking sage advice from his
mentor, Dr. Gillespie.
</P>
<P>
   Nope. Chamberlain has swashbuckled his way through a mini-series
or two since then (``The Thorn Birds,'' ``Shogun,''
``Centennial''), done time on the London stage and traveled to
``Chaillot'' with madwoman Katharine Hepburn.
</P>
<P>
   And although he sings onstage, he's more music lover than
practitioner _ the music of jazz pianist Marian McPartland shares
his CD player with Ella Fitzgerald, Tony Bennett and Sarah Vaughan.
</P>
<P>
   At 64, the Hawaii resident has a decade or two on those who've
preceded him as Captain von Trapp (Broadway original Theodore Bikel
was 35; the movie's Christopher Plummer was 38), but he still
relishes the challenge of live theater.
</P>
<P>
   He laughed easily one recent afternoon as he answered a few
questions about life in the Alps:
</P>
<P>
   Q: Doing eight shows a week can be grueling, especially on the
road. How do you cope?
</P>
<P>
   A: Nobody's supposed to know it's hard work. It's supposed to
look like fun. And it is fun, but it's also hard work. It's a
rather monastic life. It's about maintenance. Sleeping. Eating the
right thing. Vocalizing. There's little time to have fun.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You called ``My Fair Lady,'' which you did in Atlanta in
1993, a classic of musical theater. Where does ``The Sound of
Music'' rank?
</P>
<P>
   A: Obviously, it's also a classic. It's easy to underestimate
``The Sound of Music.'' In fact, it's got a lot of guts. It's a
very moving show. The audiences are invariably moved by it on a
number of occasions. The book isn't in the same class as (George
Bernard) Shaw, but it's lovely.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's your favorite moment?
</P>
<P>
   A: I love the scene when (the Captain) confesses to Maria that
he's in love with her. And she to him. And I like that song
(``Something Good,'' added from the movie) very much. I also like
singing ``Edelweiss.'' It's a little scary, but I like that moment.
Singing is still kind of foreign. I'm doing all right, I think, but
there is a certain suspense about it. Will I or won't I make it
through the song?
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sound of Music''
</P>
<P>
   Through Sunday. 8 tonight-Friday;
</P>
<P>
   2 and 8 p.m. Saturday-Sunday. With Richard Chamberlain, Meg
Tolin and Jeanne Lehman. $15-$43. Theater of the Stars, Fox
Theatre, 660 Peachtree St. N.E. 404-817-8700.

 &HT;    Talk tones down a bit from debut
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is not likely to be as much talk about the second issue of
Talk ($3.50) as there was about the debut of Tina Brown's magazine.
This time there are no revelations by Hillary Rodham Clinton about
her husband's sexual escapades, just a mix of celebrity profiles,
political articles and New York gossip. Never one to hide her light
under a bushel, Brown devotes eight pages of celebrity-studded
photos to Talk's debut party at the Statue of Liberty.
</P>
<P>
   In the cover story on Elizabeth Taylor, author Paul Theroux
takes a helicopter ride with the actress over Michael Jackson's
Neverland ranch and Theroux offers his opinion about what makes the
film star tick. It's all about having more, Theroux says, and adds
that if Taylor had her way, she would supersize her life the way
she does McDonald's fries.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in the magazine, James Surowiecki goes to the mat with
World Wrestling Federation promoter Vince McMahon, who has
transformed professional wrestling from a somewhat seedy enterprise
to an $850 million company. Despite his success, McMahon still
carries a grudge against Ted Turner after a deal with Georgia
Championship Wrestling and TBS went sour in the mid-'80s. ``I don't
like the way he treats people,'' McMahon says. ``I don't like him
as a human being.'' Turner had no comment.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  More on Ted: Speaking of Turner, the media mogul has dropped
out of the Top 10 list of Vanity Fair's ($3.95) New Establishment.
Ranked fifth last year, Turner is now No. 16. Bill Gates holds onto
his No. 1 spot, while Turner's rival Rupert Murdoch is No. 2.
Rounding out the Top 5 are Viacom Chairman Sumner Redstone, Time
Warner Chairman Gerald Levin and AT&AMP;T Chairman C. Michael
Armstrong. Four women made the list _ eBay CEO Margaret Whitman
(31), Oprah Winfrey (33), Paramount Chairman Sherry Lansing (38)
and Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina (46).
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Changing styles: With the opening of the New York fashion
shows this week, The New Yorker ($3) devotes its cover and a
sizable chunk of this issue to clothing trends. Photographer Herb
Ritts has a 10-page portfolio of the new styles _ outfits that
include everything from turkey leather capelets to hats that look
like sparrow nests. Everyone acknowledges that designers leave
their mark on fashion, but CNN's Elsa Klensch has left her mark on
designers. Now, with more coverage on television, New Yorker writer
Rebecca Mead says ``designers are aware that they now need to
produce not just great clothes, but great video.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  George continues: Eighty percent of the last issue of George
($2.95) that was edited by John F. Kennedy Jr. is a typical blend
of celebrity and politics. The cover story is on actor Rob Lowe.
Until now, Lowe jokes, his most memorable role was in a videotaped
three-way sexual encounter in an Atlanta hotel room during the 1988
Democratic National Convention. How newsworthy was it? ``Tiananmen
Square was the second item on the news,'' he says. Also in George,
CNN reporter Christiane Amanpour and soccer's Mia Hamm make the
list of the 20 ``most fascinating'' women in politics.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Quick reads: Time ($3.50) explores the growing phenomenon of
J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter books and reveals that there will be
deaths in the next four novels. The only way to show how evil it is
to take a life ``is to kill someone the reader cares about,''
Rowling says.... In a special commemorative issue, Vibe ($2.99)
remembers fallen hip-hop legends Tupac Shakur and Christopher ``The
Notorious B.I.G.'' Wallace. Family and friends recall the slain
stars frankly and fondly.... The Web continues to weave its
influence over our lives. Newsweek ($3.50) reports on how the
Internet is changing the way we shop, seek medical care and have
sex. More than half of the requests on search engines are
``adult-oriented.''

 LEONARDO'S HUGE HORSE COMES TO LIFE, 500 YEARS LATER 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ELISABETTA POVOLEDO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILAN, Italy _ Five hundred years to the day that French
soldiers destroyed a work in progress by Leonardo da Vinci of what
would have been the largest equestrian statue in existence, a
24-foot-high, 15-ton silicon bronze sculpture of the stallion was
unveiled Friday in a garden that forms part of the city's horse
racing track.
</P>
<P>
   American art lovers had mostly donated the money for the work,
and the installation ceremony Friday was attended by some 700
Americans who had come from throughout the United States (many
visiting Italy for the first time) to be present at the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Most were donors and sponsors who, a few dollars at a time, had
managed to raise the $6.5 million needed to cast the statue in the
Tallix Foundry in Beacon, N.Y., and bring it here.
</P>
<P>
   As blue and white balloons floated away to lift a billowy white
cloth, uncovering the enormous bronze piece, many in the crowd
dabbed at their eyes and snapped dozens upon dozens of photographs.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans had come because of the vision of one man, Charles
C. Dent, a rtired airline pilot, amateur sculptor and art collector
from Allentown, Pa., who had read about Leonardo's project in a
1977 National Geographic article and decided to build a horse based
on Leonardo's ideas and offer it as a gift to Milan. After the
death of Dent in 1994, Leonardo da Vinci's Horse Inc., a nonprofit
organization he had created in 1982, took over the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the years this project was probably carried on faith more
than anything else,'' said Sam Saxton, one of the original
supporters, who came to Milan with a group from Allentown. ``Just
being here is an overwhelming event, the fact that it really is
happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Cobb, a visitor from Georgia, was thrilled to ``see
history in the making and be part of it,'' he said, adding that
``unfortunately, a lot of dreams are never realized, so it is
important to be present when dreams do come true.''
</P>
<P>
   In explaining the gesture of the gift, Roger Enloe, president of
the Leonardo da Vinci's Horse organization, told the few Italians
present at the ceremony: ``We respect your history; we have
admiration for your artists; we are devoted to the work you did in
the Renaissance, which left us with a great egacy.''
</P>
<P>
   And people were lured by Leonardo. Michael J. Gelb, author of
the book ``How to Think Like Leonardo da Vinci'' (Delacorte), which
he dedicated to Dent, believes that the myth of Leonardo continues
to attract people because the Renaissance master ``is a global
symbol for human potential'' and that ``he represents our
aspirations to create.'' Gelb, in Milan to promote the Italian
translation of his book, saw the horse as a sort of ``Statue of
Liberty for creativity.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Though both Leonardo and Dent died before they could see their
projects to completion, their presence was very much felt
throughout the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Nina Akamu, the American sculptor who was commissioned to
recreate the horse after Dent's death, paid homage to him and to
Leonardo by inscribing their names in the pupils of the horse's
eyes.
</P>
<P>
   The completed statue is apparently not quite what Leonardo had
envisioned. For instance, it is missing its rider, the Milanese
duke Francesco Sforza, to whom it was dedicated. There are no known
models or sketches of the final work, and scholars today are still
unsure what the completed monument would have looked like and just
what was destroyed in September 1499 by the French, who used it for
crossbow practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know for sure whether the model had the rider or not,
but the final version would certainly have included Francesco
Sforza,'' said Pietro Marani, a Milanese cultural official and a
Leonardo specialist, speaking of the destroyed work. ``I understand
that for practical purposes they have limited the sculpture to the
horse, but this thing gives a pale idea of what the monument would
have looked like.''
</P>
<P>
   The Leonardo da Vinci's Horse organization says it had never
meant to recreate Leonardo's horse or his monument but rather give
an interpretation of it.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Akamu based her own sculpture on a detailed study of
Leonardo's drawings and the works of his predecessors. She said the
statue was not a copy of Leonardo's but a tribute to him.
</P>
<P>
   The few Italians at the unveiling appeared to be enthusiastic
about the statue, but national newspapers virtually ignored the
event.
</P>
<P>
   Then there were those who felt uneasy about what some perceived
as the ``Americanization of the Renaissance.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all a little curious, the fact that this comes from the
States,'' said a press officer for the ministry of culture, ``but
Italy is different from the United States _ we'll always have the
originals.''

ANALYSIS: THE EMMYS, STILL FAVORING MORE OF THE SAME 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By BERNARD WEINRAUB   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Picture this: Academy Awards are presented three or
four years in a row to Steven Spielberg, Tom Hanks and Jodie
Foster. The outcry would be deafening among rival actors and
directors, as well as critics and studio executives.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the 51st annual Emmy awards for television, given by voters
of the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences, were notable not
only for their repetition but for an obvious reluctance to break
new ground and recognize ``The Sopranos,'' the lavishly praised HBO
series about a Mafia family with middle-class values in suburban
New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Although ``The Sopranos'' has been the most widely discussed
television series of the year and was expected to gather numerous
prizes, the show created by David Chase won only two awards Sunday
night. One went to Edie Falco, who played the Mafia wife. The other
went to Chase, along with James Manos Jr., for writing in a drama
series.
</P>
<P>
   By mostly bypassing ``The Sopranos'' and rewarding so many
familiar faces that had been repeatedly honored, the Emmy voters
seemed to be expressing resentment toward HBO for its
envelope-pushing treatment of language and sex, and for its having
become the darling of critics.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond this, the awards plainly reflected the paucity of
creative vision on television. Quite simply, except for the
constantly honored king makers like David E. Kelley and Steven
Bochco, the Emmy voters have few places to go.
</P>
<P>
   This year it was Kelley's turn. He became the first producer in
Emmy history to take home awards for both a drama and a comedy. The
drama, ``The Practice,'' about a struggling Boston law firm, beat
``The Sopranos'' in the category of best drama series. Kelley's
show also won the drama Emmy last year. A second Kelley show,
``Ally McBeal,'' won the top comedy prize.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm genuinely surprised for both,'' Kelley said. Kelley, who
writes as well as produces, said he had been convinced that ``The
Sopranos'' would take the drama prize. ``There was so much heat
surrounding that show, and it's so different,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Thomas O'Neil, author of the book ``The Emmys,'' said that
Kelley was the favorite son of the Emmys because of his sensibility
and that Chase was not the favorite son, for the same reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kelley wins virtually every time because he can put together
an uncanny combination of brilliant writing, quirky plots that are
suspenseful and amusing, and very appealing characters,'' O'Neil
said. ``Kelley is especially deft at writing effective sentiment.
Contrast that with `The Sopranos,' where the characters are
unsympathetic. The show's cynicism hurt David Chase. The show just
didn't have those classic elements that Emmy voters like, which is
sentiment and sympathetic characters.''
</P>
<P>
   HBO executives would argue that Tony Soprano and his family are
as strangely sympathetic and dramatically compelling as, say, the
Corleones in ``The Godfather.''
</P>
<P>
   Overlooked in the Emmys ceremony as an obviously unhappy James
Gandolfini, who plays Tony Soprano. Gandolfini lost to Dennis Franz
of ``N.Y.P.D. Blue.'' Nancy Marchand, who plays Tony's mother,
Livia Soprano, was defeated by Holland Taylor of ``The Practice''
for best supporting actress in a drama.
</P>
<P>
   What was unusual, even strange, about the Emmys was how the
academy honored previous winners and longstanding shows and seemed
to avoid at all costs the adventurous and risky.
</P>
<P>
   As one top television executive pointed out, the academy gave an
Emmy for best variety show to, of all things, the 1998 Tony awards
show on CBS, a thoroughly conventional and often tedious
production. In giving the award, the academy passed over three
provocative HBO specials: one starring George Carlin; another, John
Leguizamo; and the third, Jerry Seinfeld.
</P>
<P>
   Just as puzzling was the academy's selection of Helen Hunt for
the fourth year in a row as best actress in a comedy series, even
though her show last season, ``Mad About You,'' had hit near bottom
in the ratings. Franz's Emmy for ABC's ``N.Y.P.D. Blue'' was his
fourth. David Hyde Pierce of NBC's ``Frasier'' won his third Emmy,
as did John Lithgow of NBC's ``Third Rock From the Sun.'' Franz
seemed genuinely surprised, and so did Ms. Hunt and Lithgow.
</P>
<P>
   Lithgow candily acknowledged the situation Sunday night. ``It's
hard for dazzling new shows to score at the Emmys,'' he said. ``I
guess the big example this year is `The Sopranos,' which I consider
to be as good as television can get. It did get one wonderful
award, I guess a few. I guess the big ones eluded it for now. We
feel like veterans. The old guard never seems to like new kids on
the block.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   One element that displeased supporters of ``The Sopranos'' is
the way the winners are picked. Unlike the Academy Awards or the
Grammys, for which members of their respective academies select the
winners en masse, the Emmy system is quirky.
</P>
<P>
   The 9,500 members of the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences
pick the nominees in 77 categories. After that each winner is
selected by panels of volunteers ranging from seven to 70 people
who watch tapes of nominated shows in a Beverly Hills hotel suite
and then vote. The volunteers are academy members.
</P>
<P>
   The positive _ or some would say negative _ side of the
selection process is that the panels seem impervious to buzz and
media hype and the kind of momentum that leads to Oscar sweeps for
films like ``Titanic'' or ``Forrest Gump.'' Another side of the
equation, though, is that the panels, as industry volunteers, are
often unemployed or retired and may have an ax to grind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Panels tend to have more women than men and they often have
problems with unsympathetic and unsentimental characters,'' said
O'Neil, the Emmy specialist. ``The David Kelley wins last night
were in line with all of the Emmy biases.''
</P>
<P>
   HBO tried to put a positive face on the Emmy awards and ``The
Sopranos.'' The cast flew back to New Jersey on Monday to resume
filming episodes for the new season, starting in January. Jeff
Bewkes, chairman and chief executive of HBO, sat quietly eating
breakfast Monday morning in the dining room of the Peninsula Hotel
in Beverly Hills. He shrugged off any disappointment. ``I think
James Gandolfini is the best dramatic actor on television this
year,'' he said. ``He'll be back again next year. I guess it takes
time to know Tony Soprano.''

THE A-LIST AVOIDS TYPECASTING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Corrects author of ``Angela's Ashes in second graf to Frank
McCourt.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The faces are the same. But the roles are a little different
this season. Not for years, in fact, has Hollywood's A-list made
such a collective effort to break away from typecasting as in
movies opening between now and Christmas. How will they get away
from playing the usual suspects? Try Kevin Spacey unraveling in a
suburb with a Stepford Wife played by Annette Bening in ``American
Beauty.'' How about Matt Damon as a bad guy in ``The Talented Mr.
Ripley''? Jodie Foster wising up royalty in Siam sans Rodgers and
Hammerstein in ``Anna and the King''? Robert De Niro stepping
outside gangland to play a security guard guided by a gay neighbor
through the aftermath of a stroke in ``Flawless''? Angelina Jolie
as a cop in ``The Bone Collector''? Tom Hanks as a prison guard in
``The Green Mile''? And Johnny Depp trying to keep his head on
straight in ``Sleepy Hollow''?
</P>
<P>
   One thing has stayed the same. Of the more than 150 movies
jostling one another, a lot of the high-visibility entries come
from novels. Memoirs, too. ``Angela's Ashes,'' Frank McCourt's
wrenching recollection of growing up poor, is due with Emily Watson
and Robert Carlyle as the struggling Irish family's mother and
father, respectively; she hammered into depression by his drinking.
``Girl, Interrupted,'' Susanna Kaysen's story of her
institutionalization, is due with Winona Ryder and Jolie. The
latter will be very much in evidence this fall as she plays a cop
who is the eyes and ears of Denzel Washington's paralyzed forensics
expert tracking a grisly serial killer in ``The Bone Collector.''
</P>
<P>
   It'll be a double-header for Washington, too. He'll also star in
``Hurricane,'' about middleweight boxing champ Rubin ``Hurricane''
Carter, fighting to clear himself from a triple murder charge. Brad
Pitt and Edward Norton will put the gloves on in ``The Fight
Club,'' a bashfest directed by ``Seven'' helmer David Fincher. Not
that all the sparring will take place in the ring. Susan Sarandon
and Natalie Portman will slug it out, mother-daughter-wise, in the
film of Mona Simpson's novel ``Anywhere But Here.'' The trouble
faced by Michelle Pfeiffer and Bruce Willis in ``The Story of Us''
is that they no longer get a kick out of each other. The romantic
twist in ``Random Hearts'': Harrison Ford and Kristin Scott Thomas
play characters whose respective deceased spouses were having an
affair. The interplay is more complicated in ``Hanging Up,'' Nora
Ephron's new movie, based on her sister Delia's partly
autobiographical novel about sisters _ Diane Keaton, Meg Ryan, Lisa
Kudrow _ reprioritizing when their father (Walter Matthau) is ill.
</P>
<P>
   Other high-profile items from the realm of fiction include
``Snow Falling on Cedars,'' starring Ethan Hawke in a series of
interlocking mysteries involving an American man and a Japanese
woman. John Irving wrote his own screenplay for ``The Cider House
Rules,'' starring Tobey Maguire in a rites-of-passage odyssey.
Kevin Costner is on the mound in Mark Shaara's ``For Love of the
Game,'' about a flawed Detroit Tigers pitching ace working on a
perfect game against the Yankees. Leonardo Di Caprio discovers a
few cracks in a seeming paradise in ``The Beach,'' filmed in
Thailand and based on the novel of the same name by Alex Garland.
Julianne Moore and Ralph Fiennes plunge into Graham Greene's
semiautobiographical novel ``The End of the Affair.'' And you do
remember that ``Sleepy Hollow,'' in which Tim Burton will send the
Headless Horseman after Depp, is based on a novel by that old hit
maker, Washington Irving.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Darabont, who masterminded ``The Shawshank Redemption,''
went behind bars again for another Stephen King novel, ``The Green
Mile,'' starring Hanks as a Death Row guard in a Depression-era
Southern prison. Martin Scorsese will crank it up with Nicolas Cage
in ``Bringing Out the Dead,'' about New York paramedics fighting to
keep the death rate down during an intense weekend. Al Pacino and
Russell Crowe fight big tobacco in ``The Insider,'' based on fired
cigarette company executive and whistle-blower Jeffrey Wigand's
story. Keeping Damon's charming sociopath company in ``The Talented
Mr. Ripley'' will be Gwyneth Paltrow, Jude Law, and Cate Blanchett.
Perennial fave ``Stuart Little'' will return in a live-action
version starring Geena Davis and a computer graphics imaging
title-roleist.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of Damon, he and longtime pal Ben Affleck will finally
turn up in ``Dogma,'' Kevin Smith's contemporary retelling of
Christ's appearance on earth. Affleck, meanwhile, will headline one
of the season's high-impact action entries, ``Reindeer Games,''
playing a hard-luck ex-con roped in to a casino heist. ``Three
Kings,'' starring the larcenous trio of George Clooney, Mark
Wahlberg, and Ice Cube, could have been called Operation Desert
Heist, concerning, as it does, a theft of gold bullion at the end
of the Gulf War. Pierce Brosnan will reprise James Bond in ``The
World Is Not Enough,'' protecting a murdered oil biggie's daughter
from mad bomber Robert Carlyle. In ``End of Days,'' Arnold
Schwarzenegger is back, taking on the devil, no less, a role
assigned to Gabriel Byrne. And no list of guy flicks could fail to
include Oliver Stone's football saga, ``Any Given Sunday,'' in
which Cameron Diaz, Jamie Foxx, Dennis Quaid, and Al Pacino compete
to call the signals.
</P>
<P>
   There'll also be a double dose of Robin Williams, first in
``Jakob the Liar,'' playing a beleaguered Jew keeping spirits up in
the ghetto, then in ``Bicentennial Man,'' as a robot who turns
human and falls in love. Billy Bob Thornton returns to his native
Arkansas for ``Daddy and Them,'' his directorial follow-up to
``Sling Blade.'' Laura Dern, Thornton's real-life significant other
and costar in the film, describes it as white trash comedy.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``Boogie Nights'' filmmaker Paul Thomas Anderson's follow-up
focusing on San Fernando Valley types, ``Magnolia,'' generated buzz
enough for Tom Cruise to phone and offer an uncredited cameo. (The
offer was accepted.) The biopic-deprived will note that Jim Carrey
will check in as comic Andy Kaufman in ``Man on the Moon,'' and
Milla Jovovich will be the latest actress to play the sainted
``Joan of Arc.'' And, oh yes. Look for ``Toy Story 2'' and ``Scream
3.'' But who's counting?

LAWMAKER URGES HISPANICS TO STAND AND BE COUNTED FOR CENSUS

   WASHINGTON _ Hispanics risk losing potential gains in Congress
and federal money distributed through population-based formulas if
the 2000 Census misses minorities in areas with large Latino
populations, a Texas congressman said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It goes from representation and redistricting to allocation of
federal funds,'' Rep. Charlie Gonzalez, D-San Antonio, told
Hispanic leaders attending a conference sponsored by the
Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute.
</P>
<P>
   The caucus seeks an accurate 2000 Census and the use of the
sampling to estimate the number of people missed by traditional
methods used by the U.S. Census Bureau: door-to-door canvassing and
mailed questionnaires. Historically, the Census has missed 2
percent of the population but more than 5 percent of Hispanics and
African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Hispanic leaders are calling on Congress to provide
full funding for the decennial head count.
</P>
<P>
   Census Bureau Director Kenneth Prewitt has estimated the 2000
count will cost roughly $6.8 billion, more than double the $2.6
billion in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Texas officials estimate that there was an undercount of roughly
500,000 people in 1990, costing the state $130 million over 10
years in federal funding for programs such as education, Head
Start, housing and medical benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The number of Hispanics has continued to grow over the past
decade. Arturo Vargas, executive director of the National
Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials, said
Hispanics could see increased representation in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the chance to pick up a couple more Latino seats,''
Vegas said.
</P>
<P>
   One of those seats could be in South Texas, where population
growth could mean another congressional seat once 2000 population
figures are adjusted for redistricting. Growing states, such as
Texas and California, would likely see more congressional
representation.
</P>
<P>
   Texas now has 30 House representatives and California has 52.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez said that in addition to congressional seats, Hispanics
are nationally poised to win more elections to state governments,
city halls and school boards coast to coast.
</P>
<P>
   To underscore the importance of an accurate census, various
Hispanic- and minority-rights groups have launched public relations
campaigns to inform minorities that they need to stand and be
counted.
</P>
<P>
   A number of cities and neighborhoods are developing their own
campaigns ``because the Latino community is so diverse,'' said
Marisa Demeo, a regional counsel for the Mexican American Legal
Defense and Educational Fund.
</P>
<P>
   To ensure that Hispanics are counted in the next census, the
organization has launched a national outreach effort called ``Make
Yourself Count!''

`THE SISSY DUCKLING': THE FABLE OF A DUCKLING WHO WENT HIS OWN
WAY 
</HEADLINE>
 (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review. Time, channel are for
New York area. Check local listings.) 
(ms)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Tuesday night Harvey Fierstein, the bard of ``Torch Song
Trilogy,'' delivers a fairy tale. That does not represent a
coming-out from the literary closet (he has never been one to
conceal his predilections), but it is a sort of cross-dressing. His
latest offering, a fable called ``The Sissy Duckling,'' is modeled
on Hans Christian Andersen's famous ``Ugly Duckling.''
</P>
<P>
   Elmer, the spunky hero of this animated fable, is by no means
ugly; he's cute and something of a smart aleck, but the other
ducklings pick on him because he's no good at baseball. Elmer
prefers to play with dolls. His father, the sort of duck dad who
hangs around watching sports on television, despairs of him: ``He's
no son of mine.'' The voice belongs to Ed Asner, that tough duck.
</P>
<P>
   Elmer laments that he wants to be like all the other ducklings,
but ``considering my options,'' baseball isn't in his future. His
supportive mother tells him not to worry about name-calling but to
follow his own heart.
</P>
<P>
   It will surprise few viewers of whatever age to learn that Elmer
turns out to be no sissy. Confronted by cold weather and duck
hunters, he comes through heroically. When a sacrifice is called
for, Elmer doesn't strike out.
</P>
<P>
   The narrator, Sharon Stone, keeps insisting that like all of us,
Elmer is ``different.'' That is, we are all unique, or as she says
at one point, ``most unique.'' You get it. Even daddy duck gets it
by the end of this short show.
</P>
<P>
   The bright animation includes a duck ballet; the songs, rendered
by Fierstein and Dionne Warwick, are determinedly edifying
(``Listen to Your Heart'' and ``There's No One Exactly Like Me'');
Elmer's dialogue is snappy.
</P>
<P>
   Homosexuality is never mentioned, and the only people who are
likely to be upset by this tribute to ducklings who march to their
own nonmacho drummers are the anti-gay, family-values quackers.
When Elmer sings, ``I play by my own set of rules,'' it is enough
to send William J. Bennett into a stew.

 c.1999 Special for The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here are Anne Stephenson's capsule reviews:
</P>
<P>
   ``THE COMPLETE STORIES OF EVELYN WAUGH'' &QL; 
(Little, Brown, $29.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``His style,'' said Edmund Wilson, ``has the desperate
jauntiness of an orchestra fiddling away for dear life on a sinking
ship.'' Evelyn Waugh was wicked and funny, and his fellow writers
were happy to apply the same tactics to him. Here are his works of
short fiction, 39 stories collected for the first time in hardcover
for American readers (the book was adapted from a scholarly edition
published last year in Great Britain). They include ``By Special
Request,'' in which Waugh suggests an alternative ending to his
novel, ``A Handful of Dust,'' and ``Charles Ryder's Schooldays,'' a
chapter in the life of the hero of ``Brideshead Revisited,''
published 16 years after Waugh's death. To coincide with this
volume, Back Bay Books has reissued ``Brideshead Revisited,''
``Decline and Fall,'' ``Vile Bodies,'' ``A Handful of Dust'' and
``Scoop'' in paperback. The books are like Waugh himself _
handsome, with viciously funny stories inside. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``A LITTLE MORE ABOUT ME'' &QL; 
By Pam Houston (Norton, $23.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Actually, this is a LOT more about her, and it is dumbfoundingly
interesting. Houston does nothing, really, except talk about
herself in these essays, yet unlike her filmed recitations for
television's ``Sunday Morning,'' these monologues pull you in, and
before you know it, you've stayed for the duration. Maybe it's the
swagger in what she has to say, the stockpile of experience, the
competence at things that are foreign to many women, and many men,
for that matter. If you've read her short-story collections
(``Cowboys Are My Weakness,'' ``Waltzing the Cat''), you know that
Houston is on intimate terms with adventure, with wilderness, with
danger, and with difficult men who thrive on all three. She has
been a hunting guide in the mountains of Alaska, and she has run so
many white-water rivers in so many countries that she can't
remember them all. She was addicted to risk for a long time, but
she's getting over it. She has a ranch now, and is learning to call
it her own. Finally, she has good friends and, it seems, a
boyfriend who goes against type. In one of these essays she takes
him winter camping and he admits that he has never slept on the
ground before. What's amazing is that she doesn't hold it against
him. Her essays are about mountains, rivers, horses, dogs, hunters
and _ we sure didn't see this one coming _ her lifelong obsession
with her weight. ``Even to this day,'' she writes, ``call me stupid
and I'll laugh in your face; call me a bad writer and I'll discuss
art with you all day long; but call me fat and you'll send me
sobbing to the bathroom, and I'll wear tent dresses for the next
six days.'' It might be the most ordinary thing we've ever heard
about Pam Houston. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``BEST SHOTS: THE GREATEST NFL PHOTOGRAPHY OF THE CENTURY'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
(DK, $30) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Take a look at Barry Sanders on Page 70,'' writes Joe Namath
in his foreword. ``Just look at his feet, his legs, his body
movement, his motion _ how his body weight is leaning so hard to
one side. Look at that right foot of his! And he's still going at
full speed, you know, he's not falling down. I mean, he's exploding
somewhere.'' It's true, you'll be impressed. Sanders, photographed
in 1995 by Allen Kee, is cutting so hard that his body is hanging
out over thin air and the twist of his pivot foot has distorted the
leather of his shoe _ AND HE'S NOT FALLING DOWN. Or look at Lynn
Swann on Page 84, making, in 1976, one of the most spectacular
catches in Super Bowl history. Or at Terry Glenn, turning to draw
in a Drew Bledsoe pass that has just emerged from a dense fog that
hides anything more than a few feet above the field. Or at
linebacker Chuck Bednarik celebrating over the prostrate form of
Frank Gifford, who looks like road kill in a helmet. There's lots
of drama here, but our favorite is a quiet photograph that puts the
others to shame. It shows, quite simply, Walter Payton running a
path created for him by his Chicago Bears teammates. It's an
understated moment that reveals football at its best _ the
precision teamwork, the finesse, the choreography of the game.
(That's the Giants' Mark Ingram on the book jacket, celebrating in
the end zone.) &QL; 
 &QL; 
``LISTEN TO THIS!'' &QL; 
By Alan Reder and John Baxter (Hyperion, $16.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Reder and Baxter spent four years interviewing popular musicians
about their favorite artists and recordings. The result is this
volume, which offers educated and honest opinions (Dave Matthews
says he listens to Keith Jarrett's album, ``The Koln Concert,''
because ``it calms me down, like watching windshield wipers'')
about today's music from some of the people who know it best. The
Beatles are mentioned more than any other group or artist. Other
favorites include James Brown, Joni Mitchell, Hank Williams, Muddy
Waters, the Rolling Stones, John Coltrane, Otis Redding, Elvis
Presley, Charlie Parker, B.B. King, Howlin' Wolf, Jimi Hendrix,
Aretha Franklin, Miles Davis, Lightnin' Hopkins, Ray Charles and
Bob Dylan. But not all of the names are famous, so it's possible to
discover new territory for your own listening pleasure. The authors
note, for example, that Dave Matthews, Ani DiFranco and Victoria
Williams all list among their favorites ``an obscure but very
special album'' by Mary Margaret O'Hara called ``Miss America.''
The book includes a master list of artists, and its index will
inspire you, too. Among the musicians polled are Pat Metheny,
Waylon Jennings, Joan Armatrading, Vassar Clements, Michael Doucet,
Pete Seeger, Sonny Rollins, Willie Nelson, Branford Marsalis, Bobby
McFerrin, Herbie Hancock and Dr. John. &QL;

CRITICS WARN OF BLURRED LINES BETWEEN SOLDIER AND COP 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By SEAN LOUGHLIN   NYT Regional Newspapers   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The renewed attention on Waco underscores what some
critics see as a troubling trend in U.S. law enforcement _ the
increased militarization of police departments.
</P>
<P>
   Encouraged by Congress and recent administrations, local law
enforcement agencies have turned to the military for equipment and
training, particularly when it comes to fighting drug crimes. Over
the past 20 years, lawmakers and presidents have chipped away at
the landmark Posse Comitatus Act, a post-Civil War law that banned
the military from enforcing civilian laws.
</P>
<P>
   Congress, in fact, is poised to pass a bill that would make it
even easier for local police departments to call on the military
for help.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a growing problem,'' said Gregory Nojeim, an attorney
with the American Civil Liberties Union's national office in
Washington. ``Increasing numbers of local law enforcement agencies
are forming SWAT teams and adopting SWAT team tactics that are
sometimes used when they're not necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, it is not uncommon for the Defense Department to share
its military equipment. In 1981, Congress passed the Military
Cooperation with Law Enforcement Officials Act, which authorized
the military to ``assist'' civilian police in enforcing drug laws.
President Bush later established six regional task forces within
the Department of Defense to work with police agencies to combat
drug activity.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1995 and 1997, the Pentagon distributed to police
departments approximately 1.2 million pieces of military hardware,
including 73 grenade launchers and 112 armored personnel carriers,
according to a report released by the Cato Institute, a libertarian
think tank. In 1994, the departments of Justice and Defense signed
a joint agreement to develop and share technology and equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials say the equipment sharing and training is
justified in light of the heavy firepower used by some modern
criminals. They also defend it as cost effective.
</P>
<P>
   Critics, however, say the line between soldier and police
officer is becoming dangerously blurred. An unusual coalition of
civil libertarians, gun-rights advocates and even some former
police officers are decrying the trend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's been incremental, but it's actually an incredible
fundamental change in American policing,'' said Joseph D. McNamara,
a retired New York City police officer who also served as chief in
departments in Kansas City, Mo., and San Jose, Calif. McNamara, now
a research fellow at the Hoover Institution in California, said the
development of specially trained tactical units has encouraged a
``kick butt'' attitude among some officers that runs counter to the
notion of settling conflicts peacefully.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sharing of training and technology is producing a shared
mind-set,'' said Diane Cecilia Weber, a graduate student in
criminal justice in Virginia who wrote ``Warrior Cops'' for the
Cato Institute. ``The problem is that the mind-set of the soldier
is simply not appropriate for the civilian police officer.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike soldiers, Weber said, police officers are trained to use
deadly force only as a last resort, and they must always be mindful
of the constitutional rights of all citizens. ``The police mind-set
is one of more restraint,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The military influence on police departments will likely be part
of new investigations into the disastrous 1993 raid on the Branch
Davidian compound near Waco, Texas. The military provided some
training and aid for agents with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms.
</P>
<P>
   But even as a new independent panel prepares to take a look at
the role of the military in the Waco raid, a defense authorization
bill would make it easier for local enforcement agencies to turn to
the military for help in certain situations.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which is working its way through Congress, includes a
little-noted provision that eases restrictions on police
departments calling in the military. Currently, the military can
only be called in under emergencies involving biological or
chemical weapons. Even in those operations, soldiers cannot be
involved in any arrests.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new language, which is included in the final version
of the defense bill now headed for passage in the House and Senate,
the emergency designation is no longer needed. And soldiers would
only be barred from direct involvement in arrests.
</P>
<P>
   In what would be another break with current policy, local law
enforcement agencies would not have to reimburse the military for
aid, a change that would likely encourage more joint operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think most lawmakers even know this is in the bill,''
said the ACLU's Nojeim, who is trying to get the new language
removed.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials acknowledge that they have turned to the
military for training and equipment, but they said it's an
exaggeration to suggest that police departments have adopted a
military mind-set.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is there ever a time in police operations in which military
type tactics can be appropriate? The answer to that is yes,'' said
Edward Flynn, the police chief for the 360-strong force in
Arlington, Va. ``Should police departments behave like military
units? The answer to that is no.''
</P>
<P>
   Flynn, who also serves on the board of directors for the Police
Executive Research Forum in Washington, said that on ``rare
occasions'' specially trained teams can use ``sophisticated
weapons'' to intimidate criminals and diffuse potentially violent
situations.
</P>
<P>
   But McNamara, the retired police chief, is wary of the
intermingling between the military and police departments because
it can create an ``elite'' force that is distant from the
community. ``These units have taken on a life of their own,'' he
said.

THE TRUTH ABOUT `JAKOB': ROBIN WILLIAMS FACES HIS MOST DANGEROUS
ROLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's StarBeat
entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not

 (Includes a color slide of Robin Williams with Bob Balaban and
Armin Mueller-Stahl in a scene from ``Jakob the Liar.'') 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Robin Williams can laugh about almost anything, but he wasn't
ready to joke about the Holocaust.
 &HT;    Most people never have this problem, but the Oscar-winning actor
couldn't avoid it during the weeks he spent in Poland filming
``Jakob the Liar,'' a drama/comedy that will open on Sept. 24. It
casts him as a pancake vendor who lifts the spirits of his fellow
Jews in a 1944 Polish ghetto with encouraging radio reports _
reports which happen to be lies.
 &HT;    When the subject is genocide, even Robin Williams is at a loss
for a joke.
 &HT;    ``For the first time in my life,'' he says, ``I was afraid of
the laughter.''
 &HT;    Finally a real-life Holocaust survivor working as an extra
offered him some crucial advice.
 &HT;    ``One day he told me not to be afraid of humor in the worst
possible situation,'' Williams says. ``He said that, in the death
camps, people actually did smile and laugh. It was the only way to
survive.'''
 &HT;    To do the role justice, Williams immersed himself in research
into the Nazi occupation. To his surprise, he found that there was
much about the period that he hadn't known.
 &HT;    ``I learned that these ghettos were different from the death
camps,'' he said. ``The Germans would literally jam as many people
as they could into a small area before sending them to the camps.''
 &HT;    The biggest surprise, however, was the deceptive normalcy of
life in the ghetto.
 &HT;    ``I couldn't believe that people in these ghettos would carry on
this illusion of a normal life,'' Williams marvels. ``People were
still going off to work during the day, and then at night they
would attend theater performances. They were still trying to
maintain a certain human dignity _ but yet always hovering over
them was the idea of liquidation.
 &HT;    ``At any moment, the Germans would walk in and kill an entire
neighborhood,'' he says soberly. ``Yet life went on. Children went
to school. Parents made their kids study the classics. The
rabbinical council was still pretending to run things like business
as usual.''
 &HT;    Williams lost 20 pounds for the role, he says over breakfast at
Los Angeles' Four Seasons hotel.
 &HT;    ``I had to lose the weight because I couldn't be like, `Ohhh,
I'm suffering. Pass the cookies,''' he says. ``I wanted to look a
little emaciated. But it was rough _ I would run around sneaking
cookies before I left for the shoot. My big excuse was, `Hey, I'm
not in Poland yet.'''
 &HT;    For a man best known for being funny, it's been an unusual
couple of years. Death and despair also have figured prominently in
his previous two movies _ ``What Dreams May Come'' (1998) and
``Patch Adams'' (1998).
 &HT;    Is this Robin Williams' blue period?
 &HT;    ``It's more the taupe and teal,'' the actor jokes.
 &HT;    And a bit of gold, too: The 46-year-old Williams won a Best
Supporting Actor Oscar two years ago for his role as a
compassionate psychologist in ``Good Will Hunting'' (1997).
 &HT;    ``It was a welcome relief,'' he says, puffing imaginary smoke in
the air, ``after all those years of going, `Daniel Day Lewis, I am
so happy for you!'''
 &HT;    These days, he adds, he counts his blessings regularly.
 &HT;    ``Sometimes I get up and figure I have it so good because in
another life, I was somebody named Sid,'' he says with a chuckle.
``That's it. I had a small clothing store. I was miserable. This
life is the universe's way of making it all up to me!''
 &HT;    Actually, Williams has had plenty of misery in his current life.
The proverbial poor little rich boy, Williams grew up in affluent
surroundings _ his father was an executive with Ford Motors _ but
spent his days lonely, an only child in a 40-room mansion.
 &HT;    ``My parents basically gave me the entire third floor and said,
`Have fun,''' he recalls. ``What I remember the most is that the
house had a huge stone wall outside of it. It was like the rest of
the world was outside that wall, but I was inside trapped and
alone.''
 &HT;    Short, fat and unusually hairy, Williams wasn't popular at
school.
 &HT;    ``I was tormented,'' he says simply. ``I remember being in the
sixth grade and being called `leprechaun' and `dwarf' on a daily
basis. I would go home crying and say, `But I'm not those things.'
The truth was, I was fat, hairy and pasty.''
 &HT;    At night, Williams found his only moments of happiness.
 &HT;    ``I would go into my mother's bedroom and do anything to make
her laugh _ jokes, stunts, pratfalls. And it worked. For those few
minutes when she was laughing, it was like everything was suddenly
right with the world.''
 &HT;    A career in comedy was a natural result, peaking when ``Mork and
Mindy'' made him a household name in the 1970s. Always ambitious to
extend beyond comedy _ at New York's Juilliard School he had
participated in improv-comedy workshops, but also taken serious
acting courses _ he turned his eyes toward film.
 &HT;    Though his early films mixed hits and flops _ ``Moscow on the
Hudson'' (1984) being one of the former, ``Popeye'' (1980) one of
the latter _ it was his personal life that suffered most.
Longstanding recreational drug use turned into a serious addiction
shortly after he hit Hollywood.
 &HT;    ``That was hell on earth,'' he says quietly. ``Everything seemed
like it was crashing in on me in those days.
 &HT;    ``It's so much pressure when you first arrive in Los Angeles,''
he explains. ``You watch the box-office numbers take a slide on one
film, and life seems like it's over. Waiters tell you, `Better luck
next time.'
 &HT;    ``My mind was constantly racing in those days. I couldn't do
enough. I knew I had to keep going, keep moving, never stop. I
thought it was all going to end.''
 &HT;    It almost did. It took the 1982 drug-overdose death of his
friend and fellow comic John Belushi _ and the roughly concurrent
birth of Williams' son, Zachary _ to turn things around. He quit
drugs cold turkey, and says he has been clean ever since.
 &HT;    It is probably no coincidence that his movie career began to
catch fire soon afterward. ``Good Morning Vietnam'' (1987) earned
him his first Oscar nomination, and ``Dead Poets Society'' (1989),
``The Fisher King'' (1991), the animated ``Aladdin'' (1992) and the
goofy comedy ``Mrs. Doubtfire'' (1993) established him as a major
star. The Oscar for ``Good Will Hunting'' was mere icing on the
cake.
 &HT;    When his name was announced, he recalls, he hardly knew what he
was doing.
 &HT;    ``A lot of things go through your mind,'' he says, laughing. ``I
grabbed Marsha, my mom, Ben (Affleck), Matt (Damon) and some
strange lady in the aisle who kept screaming, `Stop touching me. I
don't even know you!'
 &HT;    ``Meanwhile, I'm looking at her going, `I love you! I just love
you!'''
 &HT;    The congratulations poured in, and for a while he thought
everything had changed.
 &HT;    ``A month later,'' he says mock-sourly, ``people were back to
going, `Mork!'''
 &HT;    On the whole, though, he isn't complaining.
 &HT;    ``I feel lucky to have landed where I am right now,'' Williams
says. ``I can't think of one man who had it better than me.''
 &HT;    Well, maybe one.
 &HT;    ``I envy Einstein's life,'' Williams says. ``He was a great
scientist and an outrageous human being, which I think is the
perfect combination.''

 (Includes a color slide of Mandy Patinkin in a scene from ``Chicago
Hope.'') 
 By MICHAEL J. BANDLER  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    When Mandy Patinkin was a kid growing up in Chicago, he lived
for the day before every Jewish holiday when, with a running start,
he could zoom across his mother's freshly waxed floor, laying down
a brand new set of skid marks.
 &HT;    Four decades later, he's still gliding along, slipping as easily
from television to films to recording to the concert stage as he
ever did across that floor.
 &HT;    ``For whatever reasons, I've ended up trying different things _
and I like them all,'' he says. ``And they all feed each other.''
 &HT;    On Sept. 23 he will return to CBS' ``Chicago Hope,'' resuming
his role as the brilliant yet domineering cardiothoracic surgeon
Dr. Jeffrey Geiger, now chairman of the hospital board. On Oct. 1,
he'll surface on the big screen, surrounded by Muppets, in ``Elmo
in Grouchland.'' And early next year he'll return to the stage for
the first time in years for ``The Wild Party,'' a new Off-Broadway
musical.
 &HT;    In between, he's carving out time to record a new CD, to perform
his one-man concert act of Broadway and Yiddish music, and even to
help promote his mother's new cookbook.
 &HT;    ``It's sort of like having different children,'' he says. ``You
want to see them all, you want to spend as much time as you can
with each one, do things with them. But something's going to have
to give here and there.''
 &HT;    Back in the spring of 1995, what had to give was ``Chicago
Hope.'' Despite winning critical plaudits, an Emmy award and high
ratings as Geiger, Patinkin decided that it still wasn't worth
being away from his wife, actress/playwright Kathryn Grody, and
their sons Isaac and Gideon, then 13 and 9 respectively. So he
walked away.
 &HT;    End of story until last winter, when the show's creator, David
E. Kelley, told Patinkin that he was returning as the show's chief
script writer, bringing the show back to its medical roots, and
asked Patinkin to reprise his role in about half of the season's 22
episodes.
 &HT;    ``I told him I couldn't be there full time,'' Patinkin recalls.
``He said, `Don't worry, you won't have to.'
 &HT;    ``And I told him, `If you'll be there, I'll be there.'''
 &HT;    This year's Geiger isn't necessarily the same one fans knew
before, however. He's changed _ ``as much as any human changes in
four years,'' the actor says.
 &HT;    ``He's extremely well-meaning, extremely brilliant in the
operating room,'' Patinkin says. ``But he continues to be extremely
crippled in the arena of life. He now has a great teacher in his
6-year-old daughter, a wonderful reservoir in which he can place
his love and affection.
 &HT;    ``But I wouldn't say he's mellowed, or that he is going to be
nominated for any human-being award,'' he adds. ``He has a long way
to go before his name even gets on the ballot.''
 &HT;    His ``Chicago Hope'' schedule will allow him to spend time with
his family, as well as continuing his highly successful concert
tour. It's rare for a Broadway headliner _ winner of a Tony Award
for ``Evita'' (1979) and star of ``Sunday in the Park With George''
(1984) and ``The Secret Garden'' (1991) _ to tour concert halls,
but Patinkin sees himself as a singer first and foremost.
 &HT;    ``If you forced me to make a decision about only one thing to do
professionally, I would choose concertizing on the live stage,'' he
says. ``It's the most immediate form. The songs have a simplicity.
They were written by geniuses _ ironically, people who struggled so
much in their own lives, yet put down on paper such a wonderful,
idealistic view for themselves and the world, about how to have a
good life and make the world a better place.''
 &HT;    He is least comfortable, he adds, in front of a film or
television camera.
 &HT;    ``The crew doesn't take the place of an audience _ they're busy
doing their job, and if they're good, they stay nonjudgmental,'' he
explains. ``It's very disconcerting to me, after playing a
difficult scene, that you don't have the rest of a play to bring it
to fruition, to cleanse you, to make you understand. And you don't
have the audience to finish it off.
 &HT;    ``Also, in the film world you don't get a chance to do over what
a night's sleep would give you, with some reflection,'' Patinkin
adds. ``You've got to move on. I like moving on, but I also love
having another crack at looking at the same thoughts and ideas. The
theater and concert world allow me to do that.
 &HT;    ``But so does a television series _ where, if you're
collaborating with the writers, as I am, you can adjust the next
scene to continue the conversation.''
 &HT;    A different kind of conversation underlies his involvement with
the upcoming ``Grandma Doralee Patinkin's Holiday Cookbook'' (St.
Martin's Press, 1999), the second cookbook in as many years by his
mother, Doralee Patinkin Rubin.
 &HT;    ``We were always on the phone with her,''' the actor recalls.
```Do you put the turkey breast up or down?' _ `How do you make
potato pancakes?' I never remembered what she told us, and we
couldn't find the little index cards when we did write something
down.
 &HT;    ``We told her to write the recipes down for her grandchildren,
and she wrote a 300-page book!
 &HT;    ``It's given her a whole new lease on life,'' he adds, laughing.
``It makes me feel great to help her out, because it's something I
can give her. And she's given me my whole life.''
 &HT;    Family is central to Patinkin's view of himself _ how many
actors would really have given up a plum television role for family
considerations? _ and he admits that he and Grody have struggled to
find the right balance.
 &HT;    ``For years, I would talk to older people who traveled in their
business, and ask, `How do you do it? How did you work it out?'''
he recalls. ``I never got a good answer. Finally, I realized that
if all these wonderfully gifted, talented, wiser, older people
didn't have an answer, there is none! So I've stopped looking for
it.''
 &HT;    As the years have passed, he says, he's been astounded by the
growth of his sons _ Isaac is nearly college-age, and Patinkin
recently took time out from his imposing schedule to take him on a
tour of Oberlin College, an Ohio-based liberal-arts school with a
strong musical program.
 &HT;    ``Kathryn and I literally lose our breath,'' he says. ``The
boys' voices have changed. They're now men. I'm overwhelmed by
seeing things through their eyes _ I guess it's the whole aging
thing.
 &HT;    ``Just this morning,'' he recalls, ``I was working out, trying
to buff my butt to stay in shape so I can do what I do. My wife
came in with an old pair of bell-bottoms of mine, with 13 buttons
around the flap in front.
 &HT;    ``My son, with not an ounce of body fat, put them on,'' Patinkin
says, laughing. ``I said, `Are those mine? Did I fit into those
once?' My wife said, `Yes.'
 &HT;    ``So I turned the running machine up a little higher.''

AMY BRENNEMAN AND A MATTER OF JUDGMENT

entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not

 (Includes a color slide of Amy Brenneman in a scene from ``Judging
Amy.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Amy Brenneman likes to live dangerously.
 &HT;    She once called Robert De Niro a ``goober'' in an interview. And
she lived to tell about it.
 &HT;    ``It either didn't bother him or it really did, because he never
said anything to me about it,'' says Brenneman, who acted with De
Niro in ``Heat'' (1995), with a mischievous giggle. ``I called him
all sorts of things on the set, actually.''
 &HT;    As that anecdote suggests, the former ``NYPD Blue'' star tends
to speak her mind. So it almost feels like typecasting that her
latest project casts her as a tell-it-like-it-is judge.
 &HT;    And _ paging Dr. Katz _ Brenneman herself created her new
television series, ``Judging Amy,'' which debuts Sept. 21 on CBS.
 &HT;    ``I've always said whatever I want to say,'' the 34-year-old
Brenneman says by telephone from her trailer on the Los Angeles set
of ``Judging Amy.'' ``I've started to realize, though, that when
people are listening to you it's a whole different thing.
 &HT;    ``Some people listen to actors,'' she adds, ``but everybody has
to listen to a judge. You have to parcel out your comments a little
bit, be more careful and pretend to be a grown-up at times.''
 &HT;    Brenneman, she of the big eyes and cascading curls of hair, grew
up in Hartford, Ct., with a father who's a lawyer and a mother who
is _ believe it or not _ a juvenile-court judge.
 &HT;    As a kid, Brenneman often watched her mother work. But it wasn't
until three years ago, when the actress spent a few days in her
mother's courtroom, that ``Judging Amy'' sprang to mind.
 &HT;    She hooked up with writer/producer Barbara Hall and, much to
everyone's surprise, the show sped from notion to reality in record
time.
 &HT;    No one was more thrilled than Frederica Brenneman, Amy's mother.
 &HT;    ``I think I've trained my mom not to get her hopes up about
anything I do out here,'' Brenneman says. ``You don't get
everything you want, and when you get something it doesn't always
work out.
 &HT;    ``When I told her about `Judging Amy,' she thought it was a
wonderful idea,'' she adds. ``I said, `I don't know if I can sell
the idea,' and it sold. I said, `I don't know if it'll get picked
up,' and it got picked up.
 &HT;    ``She can't quite believe it's true, but she's happy that the
kinds of stories we're planning to tell, about the court system,
about being a judge, about families, will be told.''
 &HT;    Brenneman stars as Amy Gray, a single mother who relocates from
New York to Hartford, moves in with her often-imperious mother
(Tyne Daly) and offbeat brother (Dan Futterman), and lands a job as
a judge in a juvenile court.
 &HT;    And no, she insists that the show isn't as autobiographical as
it may sound.
 &HT;    ``It doesn't go excessively into Brenneman family secrets _
otherwise I wouldn't be welcome home for the holidays,'' says
Brenneman, whose parents are still married after 48 years and who
lives in Los Angeles with her husband, director Brad Silberling.
``It's really more about the people I met in my mother's court, the
probation officers, the social workers and the attorneys general. I
was just really touched by them.
 &HT;    ``I thought of that when we developed the show,'' she recalls,
``and also the fact that I am the daughter of a very powerful
woman. We've come far enough in Hollywood to have a strong female
lead, but how about two? What happens when there are two?
 &HT;    ``So we fictionalized the story, found Tyne Daly, who is
wonderful and definitely not a shrinking violet, and here we are.''
 &HT;    And where is here? What will audiences see on a weekly basis?
 &HT;    ``We have a tone on the show that I've never seen on television
before,'' Brenneman says. ``We've got a bunch of overly educated,
somewhat neurotic people trying to do their best, and trying to do
their best in a family setting and a professional setting.
 &HT;    ``About half the time, you'll see the work venue, with cases
that involve neglect, delinquency and families coming together and
apart,'' she adds. ``The other half of the show will be on the home
front, with me dealing with my mother, my daughter and my siblings.
 &HT;    ``There's a lot of verbal sparring between all of these people,
so there's a lot of drama and some very funny, very real moments.''
 &HT;    Unlike many of her peers, Brenneman draws no distinction between
acting venues, insisting that she goes ``where the good parts are,
be they on television, film or the stage.'' Her big-screen credits
include ``Bye Bye Love'' (1995), ``Casper'' (1995), ``Daylight''
(1996), ``Your Friends and Neighbors'' (1998) and ``The
Suburbans,'' an ensemble comedy due for release on Oct. 29.
 &HT;    ``It's a cool movie,'' Brenneman says enthusiastically of ``The
Suburbans.'' ``Jennifer Love Hewitt plays this very scary, young,
MTV-generation music exec whose bosses are Ben and Jerry Stiller.
 &HT;    ``She decides it would be kitschy to have this one-hit-wonder
band from the 1980s reconvene in the 1990s,'' Brenneman continues,
``and they do. I play the girlfriend of the main guy
(director/co-writer Donal Lardner Ward), and I've been with him
since the beginning.
 &HT;    ``I'm sort of the Yoko Ono character, because I'm very doubting
of the whole thing. I don't trust Jennifer Love Hewitt _ and with
good reason.''
 &HT;    She laughs.
 &HT;    ``I love the character,'' she says, ``and we had such a good
time making it. I ruined a lot of takes just laughing.''
 &HT;    The doubleheader of ``Judging Amy'' and ``The Suburbans'' might
very well put Brenneman back in the glare of the spotlight, just as
she was when ``NYPD Blue'' blasted out of the gate in 1993,
propelled in part by Brenneman's sexy, sizzling chemistry with
David Caruso.
 &HT;    If it happens again, great, the actress says _ she's ready for
it.
 &HT;    ``I was ready the first time, too, because I got a reflected
light of the hype,'' she says. ``It wasn't focused so much on me. I
was on this intensely popular show and I got a nice, big bump out
of it, but it never got to a scary point for me.
 &HT;    ``I've had a number of moments in my career where people said,
`This is going to change your life,' and nothing has ever really
changed my life,'' the actress adds. ``I don't know if that's
because I'm stubborn, ignoring it or just not that famous.
 &HT;    ``Lovely things have come out of my moments,'' she says. ``I've
gotten better and better work opportunities. I met my husband. I
can pay my bills.''
 &HT;    This time around, however, one thing is different: Brenneman is
throwing the party.
 &HT;    ``I feel like a parent now, whereas on `NYPD Blue' I was the
child,'' she says. ``I had a great time, but the dads ran the show,
and I trusted them and loved them.
 &HT;    ``On `Judging Amy' I'm one of the parents, and my perspective is
totally different.''
 &HT;    Brenneman stops to collect her thoughts.
 &HT;    ``I'm very happy, very pleased,'' she says. ``I have a lot of
friends whose fame has overtaken the joy. The pain-in-the-ass
factor becomes bigger than the joy factor.
 &HT;    ``I get to have a lot of fun and still be anonymous enough,''
the actress concludes. ``That may change. Right now, I get a little
bit of the glamour and get to do the work I like and want to do.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   All right, so you're about to launch the best television program
in decades. The setting, the characters, the plot lines are each
and every one a winner. You've got a great cast, and a major
network plans a huge publicity splash on your behalf. The Neilsen
families are practically lining up to hand you untold millions of
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   There's just one thing more, though. Before your characters
become household names, they need to have names _ and that's not as
easy as it sounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming up with names for your characters is more stressful
than you would think,'' says Joey Gutierrez, consulting producer
for ``The Drew Carey Show.'' ``It really is like naming a baby. The
name you choose is going to be around you for a long, long time, so
you have to do it right.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Brancato, creator and executive producer of the Sci-Fi
Channel's ``First Wave,'' agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to come up with the perfect name, one that won't
predispose audiences against the character you've just come up
with,'' Brancato says. ``For instance, you don't want a name that's
going to remind anyone of a serial killer.''
</P>
<P>
   Coming up with a name is generally the last thing writers do for
a character, but it is usually the first thing viewers are going to
learn about the person. So it's essential to make that first
impression count _ something that is not easy to do when even the
simplest name can be fraught with unintended meaning.
</P>
<P>
   ``You end up having these arguments like, `He can't be Jim
because that sounds too normal' and `Calling him Billy makes him
sound like too much of a kid,''' Gutierrez says. ``Then you'll come
up with a name like Carrie, and some people think it sounds nice
while others think it sounds slutty.''
</P>
<P>
   The easiest way to finesse the question, of course, is to use
the performer's name. Who's going to tell Lucille Ball that
``Lucy'' sounds too old-fashioned? And there's the added advantage
that it's less likely that an actor will blow a take by using the
wrong name _ addressing ``NYPD Blue's'' Det. Andy Sipowicz as
``Dennis,'' for example.
</P>
<P>
   Hence Jerry Seinfeld played a comic named Jerry Seinfeld. Drew
Carey became Drew Carey. Sammo Hung, star of ``Martial Law,'' is
called Sammo. Ray Romano goes by Ray in ``Everybody Loves
Raymond.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that strategy can backfire if the performer doesn't
actually wind up with the part. Kathy Kinney's character on ``Drew
Carey'' is called Mimi because her part was originally intended for
Mimi Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the more personal approach. Agent Fox Mulder, as
played by David Duchovny, inherited his last name _ it's the maiden
name of the mother of Chris Carter, creator and executive producer
of ``The X-Files.'' All those names of victims that used to fill
the big board on ``Homicide: Life on the Street'' were relatives
and acquaintances of the cast and crew _ at least until they ran
out and started picking randomly from the phone book.
</P>
<P>
   Homer was the name of the father and grandfather of Matt
Groening, creator of ``The Simpsons.'' His mother was named
Margaret, which can be shortened to Marge, and his sisters were
Maggie and Lisa. And this season Jamie Luner's new detective
character on ``Profiler'' is Rachel Burke, sharing the first name
of the daughter of executive producer Stephen Kronish and the last
name with one of his former writing partners.
</P>
<P>
   Not all ways of naming a character are so obvious. Carter may
have drawn on his family for Fox Mulder's last name, but his first
name comes from a boy Carter knew as a child, while Agent Scully is
named after sportscaster Vin Scully, longtime announcer for the Los
Angeles Dodgers _ and a longtime hero of Chris Carter.
</P>
<P>
   No, ``The Sopranos'' wasn't suggested by singers. Series creator
David Chase happened to recall hearing about a New Jersey clan of
that name when he was growing up, and on a whim used it for the
name of his series' mob family.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Rosenthal, executive producer of ``Everybody Loves
Raymond,'' had a favorite high-school teacher named Mr. Barone, so
that became the surname for Romano's family in the series. Romano's
boyhood dog, Nemo, inspired the name of the pizza joint where Ray
Barone likes to hang out.
</P>
<P>
   Ned Flanders, Homer Simpson's neighbor, and the town bully
Kearney take their surnames from streets in Portland, Or., where
Groening grew up. The title character in ``Felicity'' is named
after a girl the series' executive producer, J.J. Abrams, knew in
high school.
</P>
<P>
   The process isn't always personal. Sometimes inspiration comes
from whatever is handy. When Brancato needed a macho first name for
his ``First Wave'' hero, he found it in the sports pages _ in an
article about UCLA quarterback Cade McNown.
</P>
<P>
   Luanne Platter, the title character's daffy niece in ``King of
the Hill,'' shares both first and last names with a dinner special
at the Luby's restaurant chain in Austin, Texas, home town of the
show's executive producer, Mike Judge. The streetwise neighbor
Tarnell on ``The PJ's'' was named when a writer picked up an office
stapler and saw the name underneath.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Jacobs, creator of ``Boy Meets World,'' was inspired to
name the show's free-spirited character Topanga by the Los
Angeles-area exit sign for Topanga Canyon Blvd., which he regularly
drives by.
</P>
<P>
   But ultimately, no matter what the inspiration, the names must
accomplish at least one minimal goal: They must at least seem
logical if viewers are to accept the character as likable and
realistic.
</P>
<P>
   And if that's the case, then would somebody please explain Stone
Phillips and Willow Bay?
</P>

THE TRUTH ABOUT `JAKOB': ROBIN WILLIAMS FACES HIS MOST DANGEROUS
ROLE

 (Includes a color slide of Robin Williams with Bob Balaban and
Armin Mueller-Stahl in a scene from ``Jakob the Liar.'') 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Robin Williams can laugh about almost anything, but he wasn't
ready to joke about the Holocaust.
 &HT;    Most people never have this problem, but the Oscar-winning actor
couldn't avoid it during the weeks he spent in Poland filming
``Jakob the Liar,'' a drama/comedy that will open on Sept. 24. It
casts him as a pancake vendor who lifts the spirits of his fellow
Jews in a 1944 Polish ghetto with encouraging radio reports _
reports which happen to be lies.
 &HT;    When the subject is genocide, even Robin Williams is at a loss
for a joke.
 &HT;    ``For the first time in my life,'' he says, ``I was afraid of
the laughter.''
 &HT;    Finally a real-life Holocaust survivor working as an extra
offered him some crucial advice.
 &HT;    ``One day he told me not to be afraid of humor in the worst
possible situation,'' Williams says. ``He said that, in the death
camps, people actually did smile and laugh. It was the only way to
survive.'''
 &HT;    To do the role justice, Williams immersed himself in research
into the Nazi occupation. To his surprise, he found that there was
much about the period that he hadn't known.
 &HT;    ``I learned that these ghettos were different from the death
camps,'' he said. ``The Germans would literally jam as many people
as they could into a small area before sending them to the camps.''
 &HT;    The biggest surprise, however, was the deceptive normalcy of
life in the ghetto.
 &HT;    ``I couldn't believe that people in these ghettos would carry on
this illusion of a normal life,'' Williams marvels. ``People were
still going off to work during the day, and then at night they
would attend theater performances. They were still trying to
maintain a certain human dignity _ but yet always hovering over
them was the idea of liquidation.
 &HT;    ``At any moment, the Germans would walk in and kill an entire
neighborhood,'' he says soberly. ``Yet life went on. Children went
to school. Parents made their kids study the classics. The
rabbinical council was still pretending to run things like business
as usual.''
 &HT;    Williams lost 20 pounds for the role, he says over breakfast at
Los Angeles' Four Seasons hotel.
 &HT;    ``I had to lose the weight because I couldn't be like, `Ohhh,
I'm suffering. Pass the cookies,''' he says. ``I wanted to look a
little emaciated. But it was rough _ I would run around sneaking
cookies before I left for the shoot. My big excuse was, `Hey, I'm
not in Poland yet.'''
 &HT;    For a man best known for being funny, it's been an unusual
couple of years. Death and despair also have figured prominently in
his previous two movies _ ``What Dreams May Come'' (1998) and
``Patch Adams'' (1998).
 &HT;    Is this Robin Williams' blue period?
 &HT;    ``It's more the taupe and teal,'' the actor jokes.
 &HT;    And a bit of gold, too: The 46-year-old Williams won a Best
Supporting Actor Oscar two years ago for his role as a
compassionate psychologist in ``Good Will Hunting'' (1997).
 &HT;    ``It was a welcome relief,'' he says, puffing imaginary smoke in
the air, ``after all those years of going, `Daniel Day Lewis, I am
so happy for you!'''
 &HT;    These days, he adds, he counts his blessings regularly.
 &HT;    ``Sometimes I get up and figure I have it so good because in
another life, I was somebody named Sid,'' he says with a chuckle.
``That's it. I had a small clothing store. I was miserable. This
life is the universe's way of making it all up to me!''
 &HT;    Actually, Williams has had plenty of misery in his current life.
The proverbial poor little rich boy, Williams grew up in affluent
surroundings _ his father was an executive with Ford Motors _ but
spent his days lonely, an only child in a 40-room mansion.
 &HT;    ``My parents basically gave me the entire third floor and said,
`Have fun,''' he recalls. ``What I remember the most is that the
house had a huge stone wall outside of it. It was like the rest of
the world was outside that wall, but I was inside trapped and
alone.''
 &HT;    Short, fat and unusually hairy, Williams wasn't popular at
school.
 &HT;    ``I was tormented,'' he says simply. ``I remember being in the
sixth grade and being called `leprechaun' and `dwarf' on a daily
basis. I would go home crying and say, `But I'm not those things.'
The truth was, I was fat, hairy and pasty.''
 &HT;    At night, Williams found his only moments of happiness.
 &HT;    ``I would go into my mother's bedroom and do anything to make
her laugh _ jokes, stunts, pratfalls. And it worked. For those few
minutes when she was laughing, it was like everything was suddenly
right with the world.''
 &HT;    A career in comedy was a natural result, peaking when ``Mork and
Mindy'' made him a household name in the 1970s. Always ambitious to
extend beyond comedy _ at New York's Juilliard School he had
participated in improv-comedy workshops, but also taken serious
acting courses _ he turned his eyes toward film.
 &HT;    Though his early films mixed hits and flops _ ``Moscow on the
Hudson'' (1984) being one of the former, ``Popeye'' (1980) one of
the latter _ it was his personal life that suffered most.
Longstanding recreational drug use turned into a serious addiction
shortly after he hit Hollywood.
 &HT;    ``That was hell on earth,'' he says quietly. ``Everything seemed
like it was crashing in on me in those days.
 &HT;    ``It's so much pressure when you first arrive in Los Angeles,''
he explains. ``You watch the box-office numbers take a slide on one
film, and life seems like it's over. Waiters tell you, `Better luck
next time.'
 &HT;    ``My mind was constantly racing in those days. I couldn't do
enough. I knew I had to keep going, keep moving, never stop. I
thought it was all going to end.''
 &HT;    It almost did. It took the 1982 drug-overdose death of his
friend and fellow comic John Belushi _ and the roughly concurrent
birth of Williams' son, Zachary _ to turn things around. He quit
drugs cold turkey, and says he has been clean ever since.
 &HT;    It is probably no coincidence that his movie career began to
catch fire soon afterward. ``Good Morning Vietnam'' (1987) earned
him his first Oscar nomination, and ``Dead Poets Society'' (1989),
``The Fisher King'' (1991), the animated ``Aladdin'' (1992) and the
goofy comedy ``Mrs. Doubtfire'' (1993) established him as a major
star. The Oscar for ``Good Will Hunting'' was mere icing on the
cake.
 &HT;    When his name was announced, he recalls, he hardly knew what he
was doing.
 &HT;    ``A lot of things go through your mind,'' he says, laughing. ``I
grabbed Marsha, my mom, Ben (Affleck), Matt (Damon) and some
strange lady in the aisle who kept screaming, `Stop touching me. I
don't even know you!'
 &HT;    ``Meanwhile, I'm looking at her going, `I love you! I just love
you!'''
 &HT;    The congratulations poured in, and for a while he thought
everything had changed.
 &HT;    ``A month later,'' he says mock-sourly, ``people were back to
going, `Mork!'''
 &HT;    On the whole, though, he isn't complaining.
 &HT;    ``I feel lucky to have landed where I am right now,'' Williams
says. ``I can't think of one man who had it better than me.''
 &HT;    Well, maybe one.
 &HT;    ``I envy Einstein's life,'' Williams says. ``He was a great
scientist and an outrageous human being, which I think is the
perfect combination.''

 (Includes a color slide of Mandy Patinkin in a scene from ``Chicago
Hope.'') 
 By MICHAEL J. BANDLER  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    When Mandy Patinkin was a kid growing up in Chicago, he lived
for the day before every Jewish holiday when, with a running start,
he could zoom across his mother's freshly waxed floor, laying down
a brand new set of skid marks.
 &HT;    Four decades later, he's still gliding along, slipping as easily
from television to films to recording to the concert stage as he
ever did across that floor.
 &HT;    ``For whatever reasons, I've ended up trying different things _
and I like them all,'' he says. ``And they all feed each other.''
 &HT;    On Sept. 23 he will return to CBS' ``Chicago Hope,'' resuming
his role as the brilliant yet domineering cardiothoracic surgeon
Dr. Jeffrey Geiger, now chairman of the hospital board. On Oct. 1,
he'll surface on the big screen, surrounded by Muppets, in ``Elmo
in Grouchland.'' And early next year he'll return to the stage for
the first time in years for ``The Wild Party,'' a new Off-Broadway
musical.
 &HT;    In between, he's carving out time to record a new CD, to perform
his one-man concert act of Broadway and Yiddish music, and even to
help promote his mother's new cookbook.
 &HT;    ``It's sort of like having different children,'' he says. ``You
want to see them all, you want to spend as much time as you can
with each one, do things with them. But something's going to have
to give here and there.''
 &HT;    Back in the spring of 1995, what had to give was ``Chicago
Hope.'' Despite winning critical plaudits, an Emmy award and high
ratings as Geiger, Patinkin decided that it still wasn't worth
being away from his wife, actress/playwright Kathryn Grody, and
their sons Isaac and Gideon, then 13 and 9 respectively. So he
walked away.
 &HT;    End of story until last winter, when the show's creator, David
E. Kelley, told Patinkin that he was returning as the show's chief
script writer, bringing the show back to its medical roots, and
asked Patinkin to reprise his role in about half of the season's 22
episodes.
 &HT;    ``I told him I couldn't be there full time,'' Patinkin recalls.
``He said, `Don't worry, you won't have to.'
 &HT;    ``And I told him, `If you'll be there, I'll be there.'''
 &HT;    This year's Geiger isn't necessarily the same one fans knew
before, however. He's changed _ ``as much as any human changes in
four years,'' the actor says.
 &HT;    ``He's extremely well-meaning, extremely brilliant in the
operating room,'' Patinkin says. ``But he continues to be extremely
crippled in the arena of life. He now has a great teacher in his
6-year-old daughter, a wonderful reservoir in which he can place
his love and affection.
 &HT;    ``But I wouldn't say he's mellowed, or that he is going to be
nominated for any human-being award,'' he adds. ``He has a long way
to go before his name even gets on the ballot.''
 &HT;    His ``Chicago Hope'' schedule will allow him to spend time with
his family, as well as continuing his highly successful concert
tour. It's rare for a Broadway headliner _ winner of a Tony Award
for ``Evita'' (1979) and star of ``Sunday in the Park With George''
(1984) and ``The Secret Garden'' (1991) _ to tour concert halls,
but Patinkin sees himself as a singer first and foremost.
 &HT;    ``If you forced me to make a decision about only one thing to do
professionally, I would choose concertizing on the live stage,'' he
says. ``It's the most immediate form. The songs have a simplicity.
They were written by geniuses _ ironically, people who struggled so
much in their own lives, yet put down on paper such a wonderful,
idealistic view for themselves and the world, about how to have a
good life and make the world a better place.''
 &HT;    He is least comfortable, he adds, in front of a film or
television camera.
 &HT;    ``The crew doesn't take the place of an audience _ they're busy
doing their job, and if they're good, they stay nonjudgmental,'' he
explains. ``It's very disconcerting to me, after playing a
difficult scene, that you don't have the rest of a play to bring it
to fruition, to cleanse you, to make you understand. And you don't
have the audience to finish it off.
 &HT;    ``Also, in the film world you don't get a chance to do over what
a night's sleep would give you, with some reflection,'' Patinkin
adds. ``You've got to move on. I like moving on, but I also love
having another crack at looking at the same thoughts and ideas. The
theater and concert world allow me to do that.
 &HT;    ``But so does a television series _ where, if you're
collaborating with the writers, as I am, you can adjust the next
scene to continue the conversation.''
 &HT;    A different kind of conversation underlies his involvement with
the upcoming ``Grandma Doralee Patinkin's Holiday Cookbook'' (St.
Martin's Press, 1999), the second cookbook in as many years by his
mother, Doralee Patinkin Rubin.
 &HT;    ``We were always on the phone with her,''' the actor recalls.
```Do you put the turkey breast up or down?' _ `How do you make
potato pancakes?' I never remembered what she told us, and we
couldn't find the little index cards when we did write something
down.
 &HT;    ``We told her to write the recipes down for her grandchildren,
and she wrote a 300-page book!
 &HT;    ``It's given her a whole new lease on life,'' he adds, laughing.
``It makes me feel great to help her out, because it's something I
can give her. And she's given me my whole life.''
 &HT;    Family is central to Patinkin's view of himself _ how many
actors would really have given up a plum television role for family
considerations? _ and he admits that he and Grody have struggled to
find the right balance.
 &HT;    ``For years, I would talk to older people who traveled in their
business, and ask, `How do you do it? How did you work it out?'''
he recalls. ``I never got a good answer. Finally, I realized that
if all these wonderfully gifted, talented, wiser, older people
didn't have an answer, there is none! So I've stopped looking for
it.''
 &HT;    As the years have passed, he says, he's been astounded by the
growth of his sons _ Isaac is nearly college-age, and Patinkin
recently took time out from his imposing schedule to take him on a
tour of Oberlin College, an Ohio-based liberal-arts school with a
strong musical program.
 &HT;    ``Kathryn and I literally lose our breath,'' he says. ``The
boys' voices have changed. They're now men. I'm overwhelmed by
seeing things through their eyes _ I guess it's the whole aging
thing.
 &HT;    ``Just this morning,'' he recalls, ``I was working out, trying
to buff my butt to stay in shape so I can do what I do. My wife
came in with an old pair of bell-bottoms of mine, with 13 buttons
around the flap in front.
 &HT;    ``My son, with not an ounce of body fat, put them on,'' Patinkin
says, laughing. ``I said, `Are those mine? Did I fit into those
once?' My wife said, `Yes.'
 &HT;    ``So I turned the running machine up a little higher.''

AMY BRENNEMAN AND A MATTER OF JUDGMENT

 (Includes a color slide of Amy Brenneman in a scene from ``Judging
Amy.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Amy Brenneman likes to live dangerously.
 &HT;    She once called Robert De Niro a ``goober'' in an interview. And
she lived to tell about it.
 &HT;    ``It either didn't bother him or it really did, because he never
said anything to me about it,'' says Brenneman, who acted with De
Niro in ``Heat'' (1995), with a mischievous giggle. ``I called him
all sorts of things on the set, actually.''
 &HT;    As that anecdote suggests, the former ``NYPD Blue'' star tends
to speak her mind. So it almost feels like typecasting that her
latest project casts her as a tell-it-like-it-is judge.
 &HT;    And _ paging Dr. Katz _ Brenneman herself created her new
television series, ``Judging Amy,'' which debuts Sept. 21 on CBS.
 &HT;    ``I've always said whatever I want to say,'' the 34-year-old
Brenneman says by telephone from her trailer on the Los Angeles set
of ``Judging Amy.'' ``I've started to realize, though, that when
people are listening to you it's a whole different thing.
 &HT;    ``Some people listen to actors,'' she adds, ``but everybody has
to listen to a judge. You have to parcel out your comments a little
bit, be more careful and pretend to be a grown-up at times.''
 &HT;    Brenneman, she of the big eyes and cascading curls of hair, grew
up in Hartford, Ct., with a father who's a lawyer and a mother who
is _ believe it or not _ a juvenile-court judge.
 &HT;    As a kid, Brenneman often watched her mother work. But it wasn't
until three years ago, when the actress spent a few days in her
mother's courtroom, that ``Judging Amy'' sprang to mind.
 &HT;    She hooked up with writer/producer Barbara Hall and, much to
everyone's surprise, the show sped from notion to reality in record
time.
 &HT;    No one was more thrilled than Frederica Brenneman, Amy's mother.
 &HT;    ``I think I've trained my mom not to get her hopes up about
anything I do out here,'' Brenneman says. ``You don't get
everything you want, and when you get something it doesn't always
work out.
 &HT;    ``When I told her about `Judging Amy,' she thought it was a
wonderful idea,'' she adds. ``I said, `I don't know if I can sell
the idea,' and it sold. I said, `I don't know if it'll get picked
up,' and it got picked up.
 &HT;    ``She can't quite believe it's true, but she's happy that the
kinds of stories we're planning to tell, about the court system,
about being a judge, about families, will be told.''
 &HT;    Brenneman stars as Amy Gray, a single mother who relocates from
New York to Hartford, moves in with her often-imperious mother
(Tyne Daly) and offbeat brother (Dan Futterman), and lands a job as
a judge in a juvenile court.
 &HT;    And no, she insists that the show isn't as autobiographical as
it may sound.
 &HT;    ``It doesn't go excessively into Brenneman family secrets _
otherwise I wouldn't be welcome home for the holidays,'' says
Brenneman, whose parents are still married after 48 years and who
lives in Los Angeles with her husband, director Brad Silberling.
``It's really more about the people I met in my mother's court, the
probation officers, the social workers and the attorneys general. I
was just really touched by them.
 &HT;    ``I thought of that when we developed the show,'' she recalls,
``and also the fact that I am the daughter of a very powerful
woman. We've come far enough in Hollywood to have a strong female
lead, but how about two? What happens when there are two?
 &HT;    ``So we fictionalized the story, found Tyne Daly, who is
wonderful and definitely not a shrinking violet, and here we are.''
 &HT;    And where is here? What will audiences see on a weekly basis?
 &HT;    ``We have a tone on the show that I've never seen on television
before,'' Brenneman says. ``We've got a bunch of overly educated,
somewhat neurotic people trying to do their best, and trying to do
their best in a family setting and a professional setting.
 &HT;    ``About half the time, you'll see the work venue, with cases
that involve neglect, delinquency and families coming together and
apart,'' she adds. ``The other half of the show will be on the home
front, with me dealing with my mother, my daughter and my siblings.
 &HT;    ``There's a lot of verbal sparring between all of these people,
so there's a lot of drama and some very funny, very real moments.''
 &HT;    Unlike many of her peers, Brenneman draws no distinction between
acting venues, insisting that she goes ``where the good parts are,
be they on television, film or the stage.'' Her big-screen credits
include ``Bye Bye Love'' (1995), ``Casper'' (1995), ``Daylight''
(1996), ``Your Friends and Neighbors'' (1998) and ``The
Suburbans,'' an ensemble comedy due for release on Oct. 29.
 &HT;    ``It's a cool movie,'' Brenneman says enthusiastically of ``The
Suburbans.'' ``Jennifer Love Hewitt plays this very scary, young,
MTV-generation music exec whose bosses are Ben and Jerry Stiller.
 &HT;    ``She decides it would be kitschy to have this one-hit-wonder
band from the 1980s reconvene in the 1990s,'' Brenneman continues,
``and they do. I play the girlfriend of the main guy
(director/co-writer Donal Lardner Ward), and I've been with him
since the beginning.
 &HT;    ``I'm sort of the Yoko Ono character, because I'm very doubting
of the whole thing. I don't trust Jennifer Love Hewitt _ and with
good reason.''
 &HT;    She laughs.
 &HT;    ``I love the character,'' she says, ``and we had such a good
time making it. I ruined a lot of takes just laughing.''
 &HT;    The doubleheader of ``Judging Amy'' and ``The Suburbans'' might
very well put Brenneman back in the glare of the spotlight, just as
she was when ``NYPD Blue'' blasted out of the gate in 1993,
propelled in part by Brenneman's sexy, sizzling chemistry with
David Caruso.
 &HT;    If it happens again, great, the actress says _ she's ready for
it.
 &HT;    ``I was ready the first time, too, because I got a reflected
light of the hype,'' she says. ``It wasn't focused so much on me. I
was on this intensely popular show and I got a nice, big bump out
of it, but it never got to a scary point for me.
 &HT;    ``I've had a number of moments in my career where people said,
`This is going to change your life,' and nothing has ever really
changed my life,'' the actress adds. ``I don't know if that's
because I'm stubborn, ignoring it or just not that famous.
 &HT;    ``Lovely things have come out of my moments,'' she says. ``I've
gotten better and better work opportunities. I met my husband. I
can pay my bills.''
 &HT;    This time around, however, one thing is different: Brenneman is
throwing the party.
 &HT;    ``I feel like a parent now, whereas on `NYPD Blue' I was the
child,'' she says. ``I had a great time, but the dads ran the show,
and I trusted them and loved them.
 &HT;    ``On `Judging Amy' I'm one of the parents, and my perspective is
totally different.''
 &HT;    Brenneman stops to collect her thoughts.
 &HT;    ``I'm very happy, very pleased,'' she says. ``I have a lot of
friends whose fame has overtaken the joy. The pain-in-the-ass
factor becomes bigger than the joy factor.
 &HT;    ``I get to have a lot of fun and still be anonymous enough,''
the actress concludes. ``That may change. Right now, I get a little
bit of the glamour and get to do the work I like and want to do.''

 (Includes a color slide of David Duchovny with series creator Chris
Carter on the set of ``The X-Files.'') 
 By CRAIG TOMASHOFF  
 c.1999 The New York Times  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   All right, so you're about to launch the best television program
in decades. The setting, the characters, the plot lines are each
and every one a winner. You've got a great cast, and a major
network plans a huge publicity splash on your behalf. The Neilsen
families are practically lining up to hand you untold millions of
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   There's just one thing more, though. Before your characters
become household names, they need to have names _ and that's not as
easy as it sounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming up with names for your characters is more stressful
than you would think,'' says Joey Gutierrez, consulting producer
for ``The Drew Carey Show.'' ``It really is like naming a baby. The
name you choose is going to be around you for a long, long time, so
you have to do it right.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Brancato, creator and executive producer of the Sci-Fi
Channel's ``First Wave,'' agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to come up with the perfect name, one that won't
predispose audiences against the character you've just come up
with,'' Brancato says. ``For instance, you don't want a name that's
going to remind anyone of a serial killer.''
</P>
<P>
   Coming up with a name is generally the last thing writers do for
a character, but it is usually the first thing viewers are going to
learn about the person. So it's essential to make that first
impression count _ something that is not easy to do when even the
simplest name can be fraught with unintended meaning.
</P>
<P>
   ``You end up having these arguments like, `He can't be Jim
because that sounds too normal' and `Calling him Billy makes him
sound like too much of a kid,''' Gutierrez says. ``Then you'll come
up with a name like Carrie, and some people think it sounds nice
while others think it sounds slutty.''
</P>
<P>
   The easiest way to finesse the question, of course, is to use
the performer's name. Who's going to tell Lucille Ball that
``Lucy'' sounds too old-fashioned? And there's the added advantage
that it's less likely that an actor will blow a take by using the
wrong name _ addressing ``NYPD Blue's'' Det. Andy Sipowicz as
``Dennis,'' for example.
</P>
<P>
   Hence Jerry Seinfeld played a comic named Jerry Seinfeld. Drew
Carey became Drew Carey. Sammo Hung, star of ``Martial Law,'' is
called Sammo. Ray Romano goes by Ray in ``Everybody Loves
Raymond.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that strategy can backfire if the performer doesn't
actually wind up with the part. Kathy Kinney's character on ``Drew
Carey'' is called Mimi because her part was originally intended for
Mimi Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the more personal approach. Agent Fox Mulder, as
played by David Duchovny, inherited his last name _ it's the maiden
name of the mother of Chris Carter, creator and executive producer
of ``The X-Files.'' All those names of victims that used to fill
the big board on ``Homicide: Life on the Street'' were relatives
and acquaintances of the cast and crew _ at least until they ran
out and started picking randomly from the phone book.
</P>
<P>
   Homer was the name of the father and grandfather of Matt
Groening, creator of ``The Simpsons.'' His mother was named
Margaret, which can be shortened to Marge, and his sisters were
Maggie and Lisa. And this season Jamie Luner's new detective
character on ``Profiler'' is Rachel Burke, sharing the first name
of the daughter of executive producer Stephen Kronish and the last
name with one of his former writing partners.
</P>
<P>
   Not all ways of naming a character are so obvious. Carter may
have drawn on his family for Fox Mulder's last name, but his first
name comes from a boy Carter knew as a child, while Agent Scully is
named after sportscaster Vin Scully, longtime announcer for the Los
Angeles Dodgers _ and a longtime hero of Chris Carter.
</P>
<P>
   No, ``The Sopranos'' wasn't suggested by singers. Series creator
David Chase happened to recall hearing about a New Jersey clan of
that name when he was growing up, and on a whim used it for the
name of his series' mob family.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Rosenthal, executive producer of ``Everybody Loves
Raymond,'' had a favorite high-school teacher named Mr. Barone, so
that became the surname for Romano's family in the series. Romano's
boyhood dog, Nemo, inspired the name of the pizza joint where Ray
Barone likes to hang out.
</P>
<P>
   Ned Flanders, Homer Simpson's neighbor, and the town bully
Kearney take their surnames from streets in Portland, Or., where
Groening grew up. The title character in ``Felicity'' is named
after a girl the series' executive producer, J.J. Abrams, knew in
high school.
</P>
<P>
   The process isn't always personal. Sometimes inspiration comes
from whatever is handy. When Brancato needed a macho first name for
his ``First Wave'' hero, he found it in the sports pages _ in an
article about UCLA quarterback Cade McNown.
</P>
<P>
   Luanne Platter, the title character's daffy niece in ``King of
the Hill,'' shares both first and last names with a dinner special
at the Luby's restaurant chain in Austin, Texas, home town of the
show's executive producer, Mike Judge. The streetwise neighbor
Tarnell on ``The PJ's'' was named when a writer picked up an office
stapler and saw the name underneath.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Jacobs, creator of ``Boy Meets World,'' was inspired to
name the show's free-spirited character Topanga by the Los
Angeles-area exit sign for Topanga Canyon Blvd., which he regularly
drives by.
</P>
<P>
   But ultimately, no matter what the inspiration, the names must
accomplish at least one minimal goal: They must at least seem
logical if viewers are to accept the character as likable and
realistic.
</P>
<P>
   And if that's the case, then would somebody please explain Stone
Phillips and Willow Bay?
</P>

 &HT;    2000 ELECTIONS SEEN AS KEY FOR SHAPING HISPANIC CLOUT
 &HT;    400&AMP;add. Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Next year's presidential and congressional
elections are pivotal to the political development of America's
Hispanic population, Latino leaders and policy experts suggested
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This election is absolutely critical if we're going to have a
strong impact on the public policy decisions of the next century,''
Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard, D-Calif., said as the organization she
chairs, the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute (CHCI), began
developing legislation to present to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Although the gathering was ostensibly bipartisan, the keynote
speaker, Dolores C. Huerta, secretary-treasurer of the United Farm
Workers of America, urged Hispanics to join forces with organized
labor, civil rights groups and other pro-Democratic organizations
to achieve political success.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything we have to do we have to do in coalition with
others,'' she said as she turned her speech into an old-fashioned
labor rally of cheers for themselves and jeers for opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Noting the role of 500,000 ``new voters'' in defeating
anti-labor initiatives in California in the 1998 congressional
election, Huerta said, ``A coalition of labor and Latinos kicked
some butt. And if we did it over there, we can do it almost
anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   The theme of the policy summit, which has drawn hundreds of
influential Hispanic officials to Washington, is ``coalition
building.''
</P>
<P>
   It coincides with Vice President Al Gore's planned announcement
Tuesday of the endorsement of his presidential campaign by Latino
officials and activists from across the country.
</P>
<P>
   The first day of meetings focused largely on the same issues
Gore has been pushing in appearances before Hispanic audiences:
more spending on education, eliminating health disparities,
protecting Social Security and assuring an accurate count of
minorities in next year's census.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, in a scheduled address to the CHCI's ``gala'' Wednesday
night, is expected to echo the institute's demand for including
more Latinos at all levels of the entertainment industry.
</P>
<P>
   A two-week boycott of the four major television networks began
Sunday. The so-called ``brownout'' was organized by the National
Latino Media Council, a group formed this summer to protest the
shortage of Latino talent in new shows premiering this month on
ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Gore, the Democratic front-runner, and Gov. George W. Bush of
Texas, the overwhelming favorite to win the Republican nomination,
have been courting Hispanic voters with a vigor never before seen
among presidential candidates _ a measure of the growing political
importance of the population.
</P>
<P>
   In the 2000 presidential election, Hispanics are projected to
cast 5.5 million votes, according to a recent study by the Tomas
Rivera Policy Institute, a California-based Hispanic research
organization. In 1980, less than half that number voted in the
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   More important, the Hispanic votes are concentrated in
California, Florida, Illinois, New York and Texas, states with a
combined total of 166 electoral votes, more than half of the 270
needed to win the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   The 31 million Hispanics in the United States make up 11 percent
of the population. By 2005, they will outnumber non-Hispanic
blacks, becoming the nation's largest minority group. And by 2050,
one in four Americans is projected to be Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   With support for both parties fairly balanced nationwide, it is
possible ``for the Hispanic vote to become the balance of power for
the next decade,'' Republican political consultant V. Lance
Tarrance Jr. recently concluded.
</P>
<P>
   No modern Republican presidential candidate has ever received a
majority of the Hispanic vote. The previous high-water mark was the
40 percent Ronald Reagan got in 1984. In contrast, GOP nominee Bob
Dole got only 21 percent in 1996, largely due to what Hispanics
viewed as anti-immigrant legislation in Congress following the GOP
takeover in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   But Harry Pachon, director of the Tomas Rivera Policy Institute,
noted that ``the roots of partisanship are not deep'' among
Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   And Republicans touting Bush's campaign have repeatedly cited
the Texas governor's performance among Hispanics in his 1998
re-election bid _ 49 percent, according to television network exit
polls. Only his brother, Jeb Bush, did better among Hispanics,
winning 61 percent in his successful gubernatorial race in Florida
that same year.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Roybal-Allard noted that congressional Republicans
have largely abandoned their anti-immigrant rhetoric and are likely
to be much more open to the legislation the CHIC is expected to
propose in the coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is working hard for our votes now,'' she said.
``We're not an after-thought any more.''

   WACO-DOCUMENTS (Washington) _ Internal FBI documents disclosed
Monday by a Democratic lawmaker show that records about the use of
combustible tear gas canisters in Waco in 1993 have sat in the
Justice Department's files for years, and were even sent to
Congress no later than 1995. The documents are potentially pivotal
because they cast new light on when different parts of the
government had information about the use of flammable, military

SEATTLE COMPANIES LEAD WAY IN PROVIDING ASSISTED LIVING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ If the number of senior citizens in the United States
is growing _ and it is _ the companies providing those seniors a
place to live also should be growing.
</P>
<P>
   And they are, with three Seattle-area companies leading the way
in an important segment of the senior housing market: assisted
living.
</P>
<P>
   At a third of the cost of a nursing-home facility with the level
of independence that many senior citizens want, assisted living has
become a choice for seniors who need some help in day-to-day
activities. Staff is on-site 24 hours a day, and can offer special
services to those with diseases such as Alzheimer's, but they won't
administer or prescribe drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Emeritus Assisted Living of Seattle is the nation's
second-largest assisted-living company with interests in 145
communities. At the No. 12 spot is Leisure Care Inc. of Bellevue,
with 29 communities operating and 13 more under development.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Seattle-based Merrill Gardens, which has been
around only since 1993 and didn't even make the top-20 list at the
end of last year. But it now operates 56 communities with a total
of 5,043 units in 14 states, and made a major acquisition in August
by buying Texas-based TORCH Health Care.
</P>
<P>
   How did the Northwest get to be home for three leaders in the
retirement-housing industry? ``There are some good long-term
companies that set some precedents'' and acted as schools for
others, said Dan Madsen, president of Leisure Care, which was
founded in 1976. ``We're one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Those three are part of a broader industry trend. In the past
three years alone, 14 assisted-living facilities have gone public,
according to Andrew MacPherson, an analyst from Volpe Brown Whelan
in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``From that perspective, it's grown really rapidly,'' he said.
``The number of old people that will be in the country in the next
30 years is what the industry is designed to cater for.''
</P>
<P>
   Industry estimates show that demand for assisted-living
facilities will increase 150 percent by 2005, and that's before
baby boomers turn of age.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our market for senior housing is for those over 75,'' said
Bill Pettit, president of Merrill Gardens. ``They get to a point
where they are healthy but experiencing some difficulty in daily
living and could use a little help in dressing or bathing.''
</P>
<P>
   With the additional TORCH units in the South, the company will
have a greater presence in states where it expects that
75-and-older market to be largest, including Washington,
California, Arizona, Texas and Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Before the acquisition, the company expected revenue in the $60
million range. Now, the additional units will push the company into
the $80 million to $90 million range.
</P>
<P>
   Emeritus has been climbing the growth ladder, as well _ so
rapidly, in fact, that it has yet to generate a profit since its
founding in 1993. Last year, Emeritus reported a loss of $31
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be the second-largest, we've grown rapidly,'' said Kelly
Price, Emeritus' chief financial officer.
</P>
<P>
   So have a lot of companies, to the point that the market may be
a little flooded with assisted-living facilities until more baby
boomers reach prime age for retirement living.
</P>
<P>
   MacPherson said there has been a huge influx of capital into the
market, prompting a construction boom. Recently that capital flow
has dried up, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some companies have grown too quickly and have experienced
operational difficulties'' such as hiring and retaining staffers,
Madsen said. After failing to meet earnings expectations,
``companies have cut back on expansion and focused on operations.''
</P>
<P>
   The companies may be national, but the markets are strictly
local, added Andrew Heyward, who follows the assisted-living
industry for Ragen MacKenzie Inc. in Seattle. People like to retire
in the communities they've lived in, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are certainly some companies that are struggling to get
in balance,'' he said. ``They must reach an equilibrium before they
can meet profitability. ... It's a local business that is highly
variable from place to place.''
</P>
<P>
   Excess capacity also means consolidation, which in turn means
opportunity for some companies such as Leisure Care. ``We're
looking for opportunities to acquire small companies and one-off
projects, as well as develop ourselves,'' Madsen said, adding that
the company hopes to add six to eight new projects a year.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Gardens also expects to grow by acquisition and
development. It recently received a $15 million round of equity
funding, which will enable the company to continue its growth. Each
year, Merrill Gardens aims to add five more buildings, Pettit said.
</P>
<P>
   While they're waiting for baby boomers to age and fill up their
facilities, assisted-living companies face some more immediate
problems, such as explaining what they are to the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a bit of an identity crisis,'' Madsen said. ``There
are so many levels of assisted living, it's tough to say what it
is. We face the challenge of confusing the customer.''

 &HT;    Providing for needs while increasing purchasing power is key for
Primerica
 &HT;    By Robert Luke
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ John A. Addison Jr. may sound like a television
preacher.
</P>
<P>
   But the exhortations by the president and chief marketing
officer of Primerica Financial Services _ delivered weekly via
satellite from Duluth,, Ga., where the company is based, aren't a
gospel of salvation.
</P>
<P>
   They're meant to rally the company's zealous agents, most of
them part-timers, to sell more life insurance and other financial
products, to recognize top producers, and to recruit others into
the sales force.
</P>
<P>
   That sales force of 153,000, including many husband-wife teams,
is likely to grow next year as the Citigroup unit expands out of
North America for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Germany and Spain are the most likely beachheads. Japan, the
world's largest life insurance market, will come later. It's a more
difficult market to enter, from a regulatory standpoint.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would be very successful if we could have an international
operation equal to the size of the U.S. operation,'' observed D.
Richard Williams, chief financial officer. He estimated Primerica
could capture 10 percent of the German life insurance market in
five years.
</P>
<P>
   The move overseas comes at a time when the global life insurance
business has experienced its highest rate of growth in nine years,
according to a recent study by the economic and research arm of
Swiss Reinsurance Co.
</P>
<P>
   The study noted that some of the fastest growth rates have been
in western Europe and in emerging markets such as Latin America and
South and East Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Primerica already is one of the top-five life insurance
providers nationally, with more than $392 billion of term life
insurance in force. Its market share ranges from a low of 1.44
percent in New York to a high of 7.28 percent in Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of life insurance typically are driven by marketing. And
over the past five years, Primerica has been flexing its
considerable marketing muscle in a new direction charted by
Chairman and Chief Executive Joseph J. Plumeri, who recently
assumed responsibility for Citibank's branches in north America as
well.
</P>
<P>
   While Primerica's business still centers on term life insurance,
its agents now sell an array of financial products, chiefly those
of sister Citigroup companies. These include Smith Barney mutual
funds and CitiFinancial home-equity loans.
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup was formed last year with the merger of Citicorp and
Travelers Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've changed the positioning of the company,'' said Addison,
whose live TV broadcasts continue a tradition begun by founder
Arthur L. Williams, who no longer is involved in the company.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, a former football coach, founded the company in 1977
and and sold it in 1989. He exhorted people to ``buy term and
invest the difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Rivals howled when consumers heeded the pitch and began
replacing cash-value life insurance policies, which combine death
benefits with a low-yield investment fund, with cheaper term life
policies that only offer death benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you had said A.L. Williams (then), people would have said
insurance,'' Addison said. ``Our goal is to get you to think of
Primerica as helping you with your financial needs, of being your
'financial guy' instead of just your 'insurance guy.'''
</P>
<P>
   That shift may have been dictated to some degree by changes in
the market for financial products and services. Over the past two
decades, the number of middle-income Americans with life insurance
has declined, according to a study by Hartford-based Conning &AMP; Co.
In 1967, one household in eight bought insurance from an agent,
compared with one in 17 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   If they're not thinking about buying insurance, they're thinking
about debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you ask the average middle-income American, 'What is the
single thing you worry the most about financially?,' most of them
will say 'I'm overwhelmed in debt,''' Addison said. He noted that
Primerica is doing close to $200 million a month in
debt-consolidation loans.
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of Primerica's strategy is a ``financial needs
analysis'' performed for every client and prospect. It's the
recognition that before customers can make financial choices, they
must first be able to identify the problem areas.
</P>
<P>
   Products and services are then tailored to meet the client's
needs, with the hope they ultimately will enhance the customer's
purchasing power.
</P>
<P>
   That innovative approach, now emulated by other financial
services providers, has paid off. Primerica's mutual fund sales
jumped 90 percent over the last four years to $2.94 billion in 1998
from $1.55 billion in 1995. Loan originations more than doubled
over the past three years to $1.46 billion in 1998 from $726
million in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Primerica's agents now sell about half of all the home-equity
loans sold by CitiFinancial, and as much as 25 percent of the
variable annuities sold by Travelers Life &AMP; Annuity.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Primerica's profits _ which stumbled earlier
this decade before Plumeri's arrival _ have doubled in five years.
They're expected to reach $450 million to $460 million this year.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Financial Officer D. Richard Williams, who isn't related
to A.L. Williams, expects the trend to continue, noting Citigroup's
desire to see its units grow at a 15 percent annual compounded
rate.
</P>
<P>
   Key to the company's continued success is its sales force, which
include many of Primerica's own clients seeking to improve their
incomes. About 90 percent are part-time and pay their own business
expenses, including training and education costs.
</P>
<P>
   Agents get a commission not only on their own sales, but also on
the sales of people they recruit to sell, and so on, up to as many
as six levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us to succeed and help our clients, we've got to help our
people in our sales force achieve their dreams and succeed,'' said
Addison, 42, who has spent all but two years of his career at the
company.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been very interesting as I've grown in the company,''
said the Covington native. ``We're now a part of such a huge
company in the industry from this little fly-by-night outfit in
Atlanta.''

GOING PUBLIC GIVES TRANSSEXUAL SOME COMFORT IN BEIJING 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By SETH FAISON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ When she walks down a city street, Jin Xing
effortlessly draws attention with her noble bearing and her elegant
clothes. But there is something else about her, and many people
seem to sense it.
</P>
<P>
   Jin Xing is a transsexual.
</P>
<P>
   At 32, Jin Xing (pronounced gin SHING) already has an impressive
resume: a prize-winning dancer and choreographer, a former colonel
in the army, founder of China's first independent dance troupe,
owner of one of Beijing's hottest nightspots.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is Ms. Jin's leap across the gender barrier, from male to
female, that fascinates many people here. Ms. Jin is the first
transsexual in China to talk about it openly, and it is making her
a celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people pay more attention to my dance because of who I am,
that's fine,'' Ms. Jin said between sips of cappuccino at an
outdoor cafe near her home. ``If more people think about who they
really are, because of me, that's fine too.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jin evidently revels in the attention she is attracting,
voraciously soaking up publicity in any form. In addition to a
cascade of requests that she choreograph or direct stage
performances, spurred by her fame as well as her talent, she is
also accepting invitations to pose for magazine photographs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like being famous,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A growing number of people are undergoing sex change operations
in China, and several have thanked Ms. Jin for setting such a
public example, saying it gave them the courage to proceed.
</P>
<P>
   Although no precise statistics have been made public, sex change
operations have become numerous enough that Beijing Medical
University recently published guidelines for people requesting the
surgery, including a five-year waiting period, extensive
psychological counseling and a year of hormone treatment before the
operation. One doctor at the university has performed 26
operations.
</P>
<P>
   It may seem remarkable that a government as conservative as
China's allows sex change operations, though the medical
authorities recently disclosed that the first one was performed, in
secret, in 1983. No law ever expressly forbade or permitted such
operations.
</P>
<P>
   Yet what seems an even greater surprise is the ability of
someone like Ms. Jin to operate freely in Chinese society, a
distinct sign of how permissible unconventional lifestyles are
becoming here.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, China's control-obsessed government made sure that
all nonapproved ways of life were kept out of view, including
homosexuality and even premarital sex, reflecting the authorities'
distinctly puritan attitude.
</P>
<P>
   But deep social change in recent years, forced by economic
loosening, has meant that ordinary Chinese have gained more freedom
over private life and that transsexuals and the more eccentric
branches of youth culture like punk rockers can express themselves
without fear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel any discrimination,'' Ms. Jin said. ``Many people
do not understand, but no one is saying, `You can't do this.'''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Chinese society is highly homogeneous, and individual expression
is often snuffed out at an early age. Putting the group first and
the individual last is often portrayed by the authorities as a
lofty concern, though it also masks a deep intolerance that is
frequently manipulated by people in power.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, overcrowding and a lack of privacy also put a
premium on discretion. As long as no one feels threatened, Ms.
Jin's sex change is apparently regarded with fascination but also
with acquiescent respect.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   As a man, Jin Xing emerged as China's top dancer in 1987,
winning a national competition and then going to New York for four
years of study. Living in the Chelsea section of Manhattan, he
opened his eyes to American society, among other ways by spending a
night in jail when a rival Chinese dancer falsely accused him of
robbery to try to keep him out of a dance competition.
</P>
<P>
   Real artistic distinction came in 1996, a year after Ms. Jin's
sex change operation, when she established China's first
independent dance troupe and began performing a set of startlingly
original pieces that explored issues of love and identity, winning
accolades as China's leading modern choreographer.
</P>
<P>
   China's state-run media, reporting on her performances that
year, also wrote about her sex change, a sign of official approval.
</P>
<P>
   Like many transsexuals, Ms. Jin said she had known from
childhood that she had a gender conflict. Living in New York and in
Europe, where she spent three years, Ms. Jin became aware that a
sex change was a realistic possibility, though she said she had
thought about it abstractly long before.
</P>
<P>
   ``My whole being is female,'' she said. ``I always knew I should
be a girl.''
</P>
<P>
   Coming from a military family, Jin Xing joined a dance troupe
run by the army at age 9 in the northeastern city of Shenyang.
</P>
<P>
   Dance instructors remember a willful child, fiercely determined
and extraordinarily talented as a dancer. And crafty, too. One time
the young dance student went on a hunger strike for a week when the
army blocked a move to study with a more advanced dance troupe.
</P>
<P>
   ``They sent me in to talk to him, and I told him he was hurting
his body by not eating,'' recalled Zhang Aijuan, a dance teacher at
the military troupe. ``He looked at me with a long face and
whispered, `I'm not stupid, I'm sneaking chocolate.'''
</P>
<P>
   The military superiors eventually relented and allowed the
transfer.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jin credits her success, in part, to the discipline learned
in the army.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more you give, the more you get,'' she said. ``Success
takes three things: talent, hard work and opportunity. I am very
lucky to have had all three.''
</P>
<P>
   She did not discuss her decision to become a woman with her
parents until she was about to go ahead with the operation,
performed in a Beijing hospital in 1995. She was most terrified
about telling her father, a military intelligence officer and a
professionally conservative man.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he surprised her, congratulating her for being so brave. His
help was needed to get the sex designated on Ms. Jin's national
identity card switched from male to female, which she says has been
the most difficult bureaucratic obstacle she has faced. She felt no
need to change her name, which means ``gold star'' and unlike many
names in China is not gender specific.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jin said she had not undergone the psychological therapy now
required of sex change patients in China, and had refused to take
hormones for fear they would make her fat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a dancer,'' she said. ``My appearance is very important.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jin, whose broad shoulders and strong hands hint at a
masculine past, said she had become accustomed to standing out in a
crowd. Most days, she wears a qipao, a long body-hugging gown.
</P>
<P>
   ``People look very carefully at me,'' she said. ``I have it much
harder than ordinary women. They can dress sloppily, but I have to
be perfect every day. People are looking for my faults.''
</P>
<P>
   She also feels that she grew up in a discriminatory atmosphere
as a member of an ethnic minority, since her parents are ethnic
Koreans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chinese people can be very racist,'' she said. ``I felt a lot
of discrimination as a child. My teachers were always telling me:
`Don't let anyone know you are Korean. You will never get into
competition.'''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Finding the right mate is never easy, Ms. Jin also said,
pointing out that even the most open-minded Chinese men were often
intimidated by a strong woman.
</P>
<P>
   Although dance has been her life, Ms. Jin says she would like to
become an actress and perhaps a talk-show host. She was recently
cast as a Chinese dance instructor in a Hungarian-Chinese film, to
be shot next year. She also dreams of playing Jiang Qing, the
leftist leader and former actress who was Mao's last wife, and Sai
Jinghua, the widow of a leading diplomat during China's last
imperial dynasty, who became a successful spy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always wanted to play a spy from a young age,'' said Ms.
Jin. ``In all the old movies we watched as children, the
Nationalist spies were dashing and good-looking. I wanted to be
beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   After she won an award from the Culture Ministry last year, a
seal of official approval, many government-backed organizations
commissioned her to choreograph performances. She recently staged a
performance of monks from Shaolin Monastery who practice martial
arts and is currently working with a children's acrobatic troupe of
children at the military academy where she herself studied.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't dare approach me until they knew that the
government approved,'' she said. ``It has taken a lot of work, but
I am finally getting there.''

SHOULD THE TIE BIND?

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The great Walter Cronkite, bless his 82-year-old
heart, watched the U.S. Open championship match between Andre
Agassi and Todd Martin spiffily attired in jacket and tie.
</P>
<P>
   He was the only one visible on television in the packed crowd of
23,000 at the Flushing Meadows, N.Y., center court in such
dignified garb. It was a telling moment. And what it told is kinda
sad.
</P>
<P>
   Cronkite is a generational throwback to a more dignified era,
when well-bred men and women wouldn't dream of being seen at public
events in tee-shirts and sneakers. Nowadays, anything goes so long
as the person is half-way covered up with something.
</P>
<P>
   Dress codes are going the way of the dodo bird, vanishing even
in places like the Kennedy Center here, where fancy duds were once
part of the price of entry. I guess one still usually wears a
floor-length gown to White House state dinners, but female evening
pants have been spotted there, and the mandatory long white gloves
disappeared decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   My handsome grandson, a young computer deep-thinker who earns
more than I did until well into my middle-age, doesn't own a tie
and wears to the office the same tee-shirts branded with odd
messages on front and back that he wears to wash the car. The
shirts are clean. They just aren't alluring.
</P>
<P>
   He's in tune with his times. Some studies estimate that more
than half the nation's office workers dress just as casually.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, my handsome husband, who is of Cronkite's
generation, feels uncomfortable without a tie and jacket. In
practically every restaurant, he is the only man in the room so
illustriously attired. He does it anyway, a stubborn salute to an
older, more formal way of life.
</P>
<P>
   When the Washington Opera sent out notices that it was
abandoning all dress standards for attendance at its tony
performances, USA Today thought this shocking development so
culturally newsworthy it put the story on the cover of its Sept. 7
Life Section. But this is merely confirmation of a trend long in
the making.
</P>
<P>
   The Netherlands' Prince Claus was widely cheered last year when
he ripped off his tie in public and threw it at the feet of veddy
proper wife Queen Beatrix. Although he growled that it was a
``snake'' around his neck, it appeared to be but a temporary royal
rebellion. He has since been photographed with similar silk
reptiles around his throat.
</P>
<P>
   We love to blame all signs of cultural decline on President
Clinton, but this one is too great a stretch. Spending money to
meet rigidly defined clothing standards is simply not as important
to the Baby Boomers and their generational successors as other
lifestyle factors, such as swell cars, day care centers for the
kids, tickets for rock concerts, good wine in restaurants and
vacation travel abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The fashion industry, which hasn't had a good idea for two
decades, has only itself to blame here. The designers have sent too
many idiotic costumes down their runways, as even industry leaders
are beginning to admit. Ordinary women look stupid in mismatched
outfits with clashing patterns and colors meant to transform them
into gypsies, bohemians, druggies, waifs, tarts, sadomasochists and
street peddlers.
</P>
<P>
   The industry has put us in skirts so short they barely cover our
behinds and now wants us to wallow in skirts so long they trip our
feet going up stairs. After seasons of clunky platform shoes, now
they promote high, high heels so thin they are not useful for
walking but very handy for toppling.
</P>
<P>
   Exposing a navel by wearing too-short sweaters is the latest
sexy look for skinny young females. Ugh.( Equally ugh, the
counterpoint for young males is to wear pants that hang low enough
to show their underwear, although not quite low enough to expose
real flesh.)
</P>
<P>
   One mainstream fashion magazine had no less than two dozen
pictures of models whose navels were the focal point of the
pictures.
</P>
<P>
   Help! None of this works in an office, if a woman wants to be
taken seriously. By these standards, tee-shirts, slacks and
sneakers seem downright attractive. Not to say sensible.
</P>
<P>
   The 700-page September issue of Vogue calls the latest madness
sixties-boho style, by which the magazine means the ``nomadic
chic'' of big boots, taffeta, embroidered peasant tops, sequins and
everything in bad taste all thrown together at the same time on one
body. Vogue's rival Harper's Bazaar goes in for wearing big
blankets as clothes, calling the concept ``bed-head chic,'' and
confesses it can't find a name for the current trend in which
``everything goes together.'' Or, actually, doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   No mystery here why sensible people have opted out of the
fashion game. Fashion mavens writing about the fall designer shows
in New York this week are hesitating to push the line that this
expensive display matters much beyond its publicity shock value. It
is all too clear that this silliness does not sell clothes.
Eyeballing what everyone wears on the street is far easier and more
comforting.
</P>
<P>
   Men are more resistant to shifting clothing oddities than women,
but the genders are embracing the new casual look with equal
enthusiasm. Bustles for women and lace cuffs for men vanished a
century ago when their wearers decided they were more trouble than
they were worth.
</P>
<P>
   So it is today. We are stuck with jeans and tee-shirts, for
better or worse.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Lawrence M. Small, a banking executive who was
invited by the Smithsonian Institution to advise it on selecting a
new leader, was chosen Monday to lead it himself.
</P>
<P>
   Small, 58, will leave his post as president of Fannie Mae, the
government-chartered mortgage company, to take one of the nation's
leading cultural positions, that of secretary, or chief executive
officer, of the Smithsonian. He will take office in January,
succeeding I. Michael Heyman, who announced his retirement earlier
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about his plans for the Smithsonian, a collection of 16
museums and other entities, mostly in Washington, Small said,
``This institution already touches the lives of 30 million people a
year: visits, members, the Web site, courses, tours. And with 142
million items in the collection there is a vast potential for
developing partnerships throughout the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Such partnerships, which include sending parts of the
Smithsonian's collection to other museums, have already been
established, but Small said he would greatly expand the practice,
especially since only 2 percent of the collection can be on display
in Smithsonian museums at any time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would hope that you would see a lot of arrangements with
local institutions throughout the United States,'' Small said.
</P>
<P>
   As an example, he mentioned the Smithsonian's new American
Indian museum, for which construction is to start on the Mall this
month. Part of that collection will also be shown at the
Smithsonian's exhibition space in the Custom House in lower
Manhattan, but Small said that museums around the country would
welcome the chance to display some of the artifacts as well,
especially those in the West and the Southwest.
</P>
<P>
   Small began his career at Citibank in 1964 and by 1980 was
supervising corporate banking in the United States and Canada. When
it became apparent in 1991 that he was not going to get the
chairmanship of Citibank, he left to assume the No. 2 post as
president at Fannie Mae, the nation's largest investor in home
mortgages.
</P>
<P>
   When Heyman said he planned to retire as secretary of the
Smithsonian, Small was part of a panel of management specialists
who were called in to advise the committee on what to look for in a
successor.
</P>
<P>
   ``They called back and said they were interested in my
candidacy, and I said that I was also interested,'' Small said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Smithsonian, David Umansky, said Small's
salary was under negotiation. But it appears he will have to face a
big salary cut. It is unlikely that the Smithsonian will be able to
match Small's Fannie Mae compensation, which last year totaled more
than $4.25 million in salary and performance bonuses, according to
the annual statement that corporations must file with the
Securities and Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the Smithsonian regents' executive committee, Barber
Conable Jr., a former congressman from upstate New York and a
former president of the World Bank, said, ``It's hard to imagine a
better person to lead the Smithsonian into the next millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of his interest in the post, Small said, stemmed from his
background. Although he is in banking, he said, he has studied
music, art and anthropology. While he was a student at Brown
University, from which he graduated in 1963, a sympathetic
professor helped him to talk his way into Smith College's junior
year abroad in Spain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I studied flamenco guitar in Granada and Madrid,'' he said.
But after listening to the competition, he decided that he would
never fulfill his teen-age ambition to become the world's greatest
flamenco guitarist. He did, however, become fluent in Spanish, and
that led to overseas positions at Citibank.
</P>
<P>
   Small, who said he still practices his flamenco guitar every
day, and his wife, Sandra, met in Chile. She is a Spanish-English
interpreter at the U.S. District Court here. The couple have two
children, Martin, a law school student who also plays the guitar,
and Amy, a fine arts student.

FASHIONABLY ASKEW WILL BE LOOK FOR Y2-K

 By SUSAN PHINNEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Fashion shows here often range from unsettling to
downright screwy, with just enough beautiful and/or wearable
collections to keep audiences coming back.
</P>
<P>
   This week, as fashion designers unveil their spring 2000 designs
to fashion writers and retail store buyers, things are simply
askew.
</P>
<P>
   Finding a conventional hemline or straight seam is a challenge,
as is finding a garment made entirely of a single type of fabric in
a single color.
</P>
<P>
   There are so-called garments being shown that don't appear to
have been sewn at all. They resemble pieces of fabric tied, or
draped and tied around bodies.
</P>
<P>
   The pieces of clothing that are actually sewn are also usually
askew. Handkerchief hems _ where the hemline takes a dive at one
point or several _ abound. And it isn't only hems that are jagged.
Tank tops, shells, apron tops and bandeaus seem to be cropped at
odd angles.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Tomez, an Austrian who created a Latin-inspired
collection, showed a wrap skirt that was mini on one side, maxi on
the other. He even managed to make an asymmetrical shirt for men.
</P>
<P>
   Angular exploration continued at Mark Montano's show. Cotton
lace tops cut randomly across the bottoms, dropped lacy little
daisies over skirts with handkerchief hems. Montano also attached
odd pieces of fabric _ pleated red chiffon, for example _ to float
around shoulders or hips.
</P>
<P>
   Moet &AMP; Chandon, the champagne company, sponsored a show to
introduce young new designers _ talents who could never afford the
five or six figures (we're talking money, not models here) it takes
to stage a show.
</P>
<P>
   One of them, Alexandra Lind, tied blocks of fabric together in
ways that left pieces of skin exposed _ a skirt that left squares
of flesh over the hips bare, an evening ensemble that showed off
large triangles of skin front and back. Models move carefully in
these costumes.
</P>
<P>
   At a ``Salute to African American Designers,'' clothes from the
Epperson boutique in SoHo mixed assorted white fabrics into
wrapskirts and other items of clothing that literally swathed the
body. They looked like remnants assembled by a genius.
</P>
<P>
   Han Feng, a designer known for her evening apparel, showed what
appeared to be large tubes of smocked silk worn as skirts. It
appeared that the models stepped into the tube, then wrapped the
excess fabric across the front where it was secured by a hidden
snap or hook.
</P>
<P>
   The hemlines may be skewed, but there are messages here: Mix
fabrics. Never make a garment with just one piece of cloth. Use at
least two, preferably contrasting ones. Think texture. Mix colors.
Put a sheer over a solid, such as yellow tulle over red cotton. Use
a contrasting fabric for a fringe or ruffle.
</P>
<P>
   It's a trend that is joyous and interesting when it works. It
didn't fare particularly well at the Versus show _ a branch of the
Italy-based fashion empire of the late Gianni Versace. Gold tulle
ruffles across the backside of white pants fell into a category of
their own.
</P>
<P>
   With a room stuffed with celebrities, however, who cared about
the clothes? Madonna was trying to hide under a leopard-print
cowboy hat. Diminutive Sylvester Stallone had trouble standing out
in this crowd of fashion giants, and Lisa Marie Presley simply
looked very young and dazed.
</P>
<P>
   Natasha Richardson _ zipped into a tight red leather jacket (it
was 72 degrees outside) _ smiled and posed for the cameras.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Sarandon was front-row center at the Han Feng show dressed
in baggy black linens like most of the audience.

 &HT;    Worldspan names Blackney to top job
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Worldspan on Monday ended a six-month search for a new
chief executive, naming travel industry veteran Paul Blackney to
the post.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta-based travel reservations system, jointly owned by
Delta, Northwest and Trans World airlines, said Blackney's
appointment takes effect Oct. 11.
</P>
<P>
   He replaces Mike Buckman, who left Worldspan in March for an
Internet real estate venture in California. Since then, Worldspan
has been led by a pair of interim CEO's, general counsel Doug
Abramson and operations chief Sam Galeotos.
</P>
<P>
   Blackney was most recently senior vice president for publishing
and business services at the American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   But he's spent most of his career in the travel industry,
including executive stints at United Airlines and Apollo Travel
Services, partly owned by the Chicago-based carrier. Apollo has
since become part of Galileo International, a Worldspan rival.
</P>
<P>
   Abramson, in a prepared statement, said Blackney ``has been at
the forefront of significant developments in travel marketing
technology, from the creation of computer reservations systems to
leveraging the power of the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Worldspan provides reservations and booking software to travel
agencies, as well as computer support to airlines. It has 3,100
employees, including 1,800 in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, trade press reports had Worldspan on the verge of a
merger with Europe-based rival Amadeus, but the deal never
materialized.
</P>
<P>
   Abramson and Galeotos will resume their normal duties under
Blackney, a spokeswoman said.

were missing after the latest explosion. A blast last Thursday at
another apartment block killed 93. Authorities suspect that
bombings are the work of terrorists aligned with Muslim insurgents
fighting federal troops in the southern Russian republic of
Dagestan. The United States has pledged to help Russia battle
terrorism. Russian authorities believe Osama bin Laden _ accused of

 &HT;    Networld+Interop conference opens doorsBy Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Georgia World Congress Center is, once again, a
good place for connections.
</P>
<P>
   This week it is home to Networld+Interop, the world's largest
technical conference focused on the burgeoning networking
technology that links the communications systems that carry voice,
video and data.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, various crews were still constructing booths and
exhibits for the approximately 500 companies that will showcase
their products. Also on the bill are a host of educational and
training sessions, as well as some high-profile talks by industry
heavyweights.
</P>
<P>
   About 50,000 people are expected to attend _ more than half
coming from within 500 miles of downtown Atlanta, according to
Valerie Williamson, vice president and general manager of
Networld+Interop.
</P>
<P>
   Just who is coming?
</P>
<P>
   Most attendees are information technology professionals, she
said. For them, it does not seem esoteric to talk about virtual
private networks, digital subscriber lines, network intelligence,
remote access or extranets. It is likewise not alphabet soup to
speak of SQL, XML, SLA, IPSEC, ERP or NSP.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 50 percent of attendees work for corporations of more
than 1,000 employees, and the rest come from small- and
medium-sized businesses, Williamson said. ``That is why Atlanta is
so important. It's a high-tech hotbed of innovative companies using
technology to advance their own businesses overall. More and more,
technology is a strategic part of their operations.''
</P>
<P>
   Among general subjects for discussion this week are network
management, operating systems and security _ where Atlanta-based
Internet Security Systems joins Network Associations, Checkpoint
and others in offering solutions. Their booths are likely to be
crowded, Williamson said. ``When you are transferring your business
to an electronic business, you better make sure the first thing you
have is security.''
</P>
<P>
   The show floor will feature ``start-up city,'' a section of
about 50 new companies with cutting-edge technologies.
</P>
<P>
   As for training and tutorial sessions, the show features seven
different ``tracks'' focusing attention on different aspects of
networking. For instance, you could spend the week immersed in the
issue of transmitting voice using Internet protocol.
</P>
<P>
   One track is co-sponsored by the Metro Atlanta Chamber of
Commerce, said Jennifer McClure, spokeswoman for Ziff-Davis, which
owns the 10-year-old trade show.
</P>
<P>
   Although the show has been here annually for several years, this
is the first such arrangement with the chamber, she said. ``We feel
the Southeast is a growing technology hub and we want to forge
stronger relationships here.''
</P>
<P>
   Networld+Interop will be back in Atlanta next year, she said.
``We have no plans to leave the Georgia World Congress Center.''
</P>
<P>
   The show is the marriage of Interop and Networld, which came
together in 1995. The event is held twice a year in the United
States _ in Atlanta and Las Vegas _ as well as in Canada,
Australia, Singapore, Brazil and France.
</P>
<P>
   Keynoters today are Lucent Technologies Chief Executive Richard
McGinn and Intel Vice President Mark Christensen. On Wednesday,
Nortel Networks President Dave House speaks at 9 a.m., while at 5
p.m., the speaker is Network Associates Chairman and CEO William
Larson.
</P>
<P>
   For $50, a walk-in attendee can traipse through the exhibition
floor, listen to the keynote speakers and catch a few of the other
talks. To catch most of the more high-powered and technical
sessions, however, costs a bit more _ between $595 and $2,700.
</P>
<P>
   The conference runs through 5 p.m. Friday. The exhibition floor
opens today at 10 a.m.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ At least seven people died Monday and
hundreds were injured when a severe tremor shook Turkey in the same
region where more than 15,000 people were killed in a huge
earthquake less than a month ago. The tremor, which came in
mid-afternoon, was felt in Turkey's three biggest cities _
Istanbul, Ankara and Izmir _ which are separated by hundreds of
miles.
</P>
<P>
   An Istanbul observatory reported that the quake registered 5.8
on the Richter scale (last month's quake registered 7.4). It caused
dozens of buildings to collapse and sent thousands of people racing
from their homes. At least 239 were injured, many suffering broken
bones after jumping from their windows.
</P>
<P>
   ``These aftershocks have created panic,'' said President
Suleyman Demirel. ``I am worried that people who were already
nervous are now panicking.''
</P>
<P>
   Turkish television stations showed ambulances racing through the
streets of Izmit and Adapazari, towns near the reported epicenter
of the tremor. Other scenes showed people running through the
streets of Golcuk.
</P>
<P>
   Buildings were reported to have collapsed in all three cities,
which were devastated by the Aug. 17 quake. Hundreds of people
gathered in streets and in parks, unwilling to return to their
homes.
</P>
<P>
   Monday was the first day of the school year for most Turkish
children, and Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit ordered schools in the
affected areas closed until further notice. Some parents said they
would keep children at home indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   Ecevit also sent a team of government officials to survey the
damage by helicopter. Many Turks had criticized him for not
responding quickly when the big quake struck last month.
</P>
<P>
   Traders at the Istanbul stock exchange also felt the tremor.
Stock prices quickly began to fall, and after the index had dropped
more than 2 percent, trading was suspended.
</P>
<P>
   Domestic and international telephone service was disrupted in
much of the region, making an accurate assessment of damage
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Three of those killed Monday were driving a car through Golcuk
when a building fell onto their vehicle. Three others were crushed
by debris near Izmit, and a woman died of a heart attack as she
rushed from her home in Adapazari.
</P>
<P>
   The willingness of people to run and jump from buildings at the
first sign of a tremor reflected the new sense of vulnerability
that many Turks feel. There have been hundreds of aftershocks since
the Aug. 17 earthquake, and seismologists say some can be
classified as quakes in their own right.
</P>
<P>
   Seismologists have warned that aftershocks and tremors may shake
Turkey for months and possibly years. Most say there is little
chance of another major disaster anytime soon, but many Turks,
especially those in the devastated areas, have seen the damage a
quake can do and are evidently unwilling to take chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``These aftershocks may continue, and I hope they will not be as
violent as the one today,'' Ecevit said. ``We will have to learn to
live with them.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Thousands of people remain homeless after surviving the Aug. 17
quake, which shook the country's industrial heartland and has
riveted the attention of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   A new report by the country's largest business federation
describes that quake as ``the biggest one of the 20th century
affecting a large, populated industrialized area.'' It said the
economic cost may exceed $15 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The increased uncertainty will negatively affect all economic
activity in Turkey,'' the report said. ``The damage necessitates
the influx of vast sums of funds to restore normal life in the
region.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week a quake struck neighboring Greece, killing more than
100 people. These seismic movements have given Greeks and Turks a
sense of shared destiny that is having important political
implications as the countries' governments move closer together.
</P>
<P>
   Seismic movements in Turkey over recent weeks, and the
government's widely perceived failure to respond to them, continue
to shake the political landscape here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leaders of the state should come here and see what it's
like,'' one women in the zone that was shaken Monday told a
television interviewer. ``No one can live here any more.''

   PRIMERICA _ John A. Addison Jr. may sound like a television
preacher. But the exhortations by the president and chief marketing
officer of Primerica Financial Services _ delivered weekly via
satellite from Duluth, Ga., where the company is based, aren't a
gospel of salvation. They're meant to rally the company's zealous
agents, most of them part-timers, to sell more life insurance and
other financial products, to recognize top producers, and to
recruit others into the sales force. That sales force of 153,000,
including many husband-wife teams, is likely to grow next year as
the Citigroup unit expands out of North America for the first time.
Germany and Spain are the most likely beachheads. Japan, the
world's largest life insurance market, will come later. (Luke,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 40.

HEARST NAMES DEBRA SHRIVER AS VICE PRESIDENT FOR COMMUNICATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Debra Shriver, 42, former senior vice president of
marketing communications for Hearst Magazines, on Monday was
appointed vice president and chief communications officer for The
Hearst Corporation, the parent company.
</P>
<P>
   Frank A. Bennack, Jr., president and CEO of Hearst, who
announced the appointment, said the new post was part of the
company's plan to centralize communications within its New York
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Shriver's promotion gives her responsibility for coordinating
all external and internal communications, public relations, events
and corporate advertising activities for The Hearst Corporation.
</P>
<P>
   Shriver will report to Bennack, and will also continue to work
with Cathleen P. Black, president of Hearst Magazines, in
overseeing business communications and marketing efforts for the
company's magazines group, which is the world's largest publisher
of monthly magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Paul J. Luthringer, formerly executive director of marketing
communications for Hearst Magazines, has also been promoted to
executive director, corporate communications, and continues to
report to Shriver.
</P>
<P>
   Also reporting to Shriver are: Judith Bookbinder, executive
director of creative communications; and Denisha Altmann, director
of events marketing (both of whom worked for the Magazines unit,
and now assume those duties for both the Corporation and Hearst
Magazines). Patrick Phillips, manager, internal communications,
will also report to Shriver.
</P>
<P>
   Shriver joined Hearst in 1996, following two years as senior
vice president of communications for the NAA, the largest trade
group representing the $46 billion newspaper industry. Since that
time, Shriver, among other achievements, worked to launch a widely
heralded new advertising campaign for Hearst Magazines, entitled,
``We Read America,'' which features 17 of the magazine company's
editors.
</P>
<P>
   From 1989 to 1994, Shriver worked for MCI Communications
Corporation (now MCI WorldCom) as director of communications. She
created the first consumer public relations division for the
company and was responsible for all communications efforts for the
mass-market and consumer segments.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, she was director of public affairs for the Corcoran
Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C., where she was responsible for
media and public affairs for the oldest private art museum in the
United States. Before that, she was for six years a senior
associate with Ogilvy &AMP; Mather, Washington, D.C., where her clients
included AT&AMP;T, The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts
and the French Ministry of Tourism.
</P>
<P>
   Early in her career, Shriver was a newspaper reporter for
Gannett Company, Inc., and holds an M.A. in journalism, and a B.A.
in communications, both from the University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa.

MANAGER NEEDS TO IMPROVE HIS WORK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Ken Lloyd _ a specialist in organizational behavior _ is a
columnist for the Los Angeles Daily News. His column moves Mondays
in the ``f'' financial news file. Send your questions to P.O. Box
260057, Encino, Calif. 91426 or by electronic mail to

By KEN LLOYD  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Question: We are employed at a midsize retail
chain. We have a manager on site, and we are subjected to biweekly
reviews by an area manager. We are a high-performing team and we
always meet our goals. When the area manager visits, he sails in,
rarely says hello, reviews invoices and such, and focuses on
finding something wrong. The atmosphere is depressed and defensive
when he's around. What do you call this form of management and how
can we react in a more positive tone to his visits? K.C.
</P>
<P>
   A: This form of management is called mismanagement. It can
easily be found when an area manager rushes through a store, buries
himself in paperwork, eagerly looks for mistakes, and totally
ignores the staff. He may be an area manager, but his behaviors are
not near the area of management.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of your concerns about how to react in a more positive
tone to his visits, the real issue is for him to demonstrate a more
positive tone in these visits. You should discuss your concerns
with your manager, and perhaps he or she could review the situation
with the area manager.
</P>
<P>
   You can also ask your manager if you could meet with your area
manager yourselves. If he or she approves, the next time the area
manager sails into your store and ignores you, several of you
should say hello and tell him that you would like to meet with him.
In such a meeting, let him know how proud you are of your store,
and show him how the store and the numbers will look even better if
he were to provide more opportunities for two-way communication.
</P>
<P>
   Q: There is a support staff member who is supposed to provide me
with assistance as needed. She is very wealthy and is working to
alleviate her boredom. She is disliked by most of the staff. She is
uncooperative, discourteous, ignores me, shows anger toward me,
refuses assignments, and performs personal items at work. She has
been ``sat down'' with management, but to little avail. The general
manager values her because she collects rent from tenants with some
success. What can I do to better the situation? M.K.
</P>
<P>
   A: Although this person's behavior clearly registers in the
extreme range on the scale of outrageous antics, there are at least
two compelling reasons why she is not going to change or be
changed: the first is her personality, and the second is the
support she is receiving from the general manager.
</P>
<P>
   Management can go ahead and have ``sit-down'' sessions with her,
but it is apparent that there is not much going on beyond the
sitting. It is unfortunate that the general manager does not
realize that although this employee successfully collects rent,
this employee is also successfully collecting significant levels of
dissatisfaction, distress and resentment.
</P>
<P>
   For this situation to work, management should either remove her
support staff responsibilities and have her focus solely on the
collection of rents, or give her some real job counseling. Either
way, you should request a different support staff member,
preferably someone who is working for reasons other than the
alleviation of boredom.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We are in the process of hiring several new managers. One of
the people who is conducting interviews recently said at a meeting
that he can tell in a minute if a person has what it takes to be a
manager. Several of us told him about the problems and risks that
accompany his thinking and he agreed to keep an open mind. Is there
anything else we should be doing in this situation? M.V.
</P>
<P>
   A: With this type of ``one minute manager,'' the best step is to
take a few extra minutes not only to advise him of the problems and
risks of his approach, but also to give him some guidance regarding
the most effective steps in screening applicants.
</P>
<P>
   Individuals who conduct interviews for your organization should
be following the same interview track. This generally means that
they are asking preplanned job-related questions, competency
questions, and work-sample questions, as the interview moves
job-by-job through the applicant's career.
</P>
<P>
   It is also important for the interviewer to understand that his
view of an applicant can be contaminated by prejudices, biases,
previous experiences, and the like. When this interviewer makes a
snap decision about an applicant, he is likely to let his
expectations influence the way in which he interprets the
applicant's responses. This can easily lead to false positive or
false negative conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it is time for the company to consider some training for
those who are doing the screening. Snap decisions in hiring can
cause all sorts of problems, while a snappy educational program can
prevent them.

 &HT;    Chandler's injury makes him 'doubtful,' Reeves said
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Falcons quarterback Chris Chandler was in a better
mood Monday than he was last year after injuries, but his limp told
more of the story.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler strained his right hamstring on the Falcons'
next-to-last offensive play in Sunday's 17-14 loss to the Vikings
and had to be helped from the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``He probably would be doubtful right now'' for the next game,
coach Dan Reeves said. The Falcons play Monday night in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler first strained the muscle on the back of his right leg
Aug. 25, and although he practiced the next day, he missed a
preseason game Aug. 27 at Tennessee because of it.
</P>
<P>
   Team doctor Andrew Bishop doesn't suspect a tear, and the team
did not do an MRI.
</P>
<P>
   ``The extra days are really going to be beneficial,'' Chandler
said. ``Doc said, `We'll see what you can do Thursday morning, and
go from there.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Chandler, who completed 17 of 30 passes for 258 yards and a
touchdown Sunday, said he didn't hear the muscle pop, but he felt
it. ``It felt like a knife got stuck in there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons are 19-5 when Chandler starts and finishes games,
and 4-9 otherwise. On Sunday, though, the team only had one more
offensive play after his departure.
</P>
<P>
   One of the Falcons' two regular-season losses last year came
when Chandler missed a road game against the Jets with shoulder a
rib injuries. They lost 28-3 in a game that Tony Graziani started
and Steve DeBerg relieved.
</P>
<P>
   If Chandler can't play Monday, Graziani will start. The
third-year veteran lefthander has a career passer rating of 24.4 _
75 to 80 is considered good _ and his preseason rating was 53.9.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's better than going in the middle of the game,'' Graziani
said. ``I can get my mind ready early. I'm a lot more experienced
now. The last two games'' _ losses in 1997 and `98 _ ``I don't
think I was as ready as I could have been.''
</P>
<P>
   Chandler is not counting himself out.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, his injury was treated with ice, electrical stimulation,
``ultrasound and just about anything they could find,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Before Sunday's game, wide receiver Tim Dwight strained his
right hamstring, as the Falcons continued their preseason run of
pulled muscles and strained groins.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves said the problems do not result from over-training.
``It's not that,'' he said. ``I don't know what it is, because . .
. we've worked less because of the pulls and all. We've done less
conditioning. I think the heat (at training camp) had something to
do with it (as players dehydrated, and stressed their muscles).

U.N. SAYS INDONESIA HAS AGREED TO INQUIRY INTO EAST TIMOR
ATROCITIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By SETH MYDANS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ With reports of killings and forced
deportations continuing to emerge from East Timor on Monday,
President B.J. Habibie of Indonesia agreed to the creation of an
international commission to investigate possible atrocities there,
the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mary Robinson, said.
</P>
<P>
   After meeting with him Monday, Robinson said Habibie had
accepted her proposal for Indonesian and foreign officials to join
in ``a commission of inquiry, a commission of experts to look at
the evidence of human rights violations.''
</P>
<P>
   This concession to concerns about Indonesian abuses came the day
after Habibie bowed to international pressure and agreed to the
deployment of a U.N. peacekeeping force in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   A nationalist backlash has begun to grow here already, which
could complicate the deployment of the peacekeeping force and, if
it intensifies, weaken Habibie's hold on power.
</P>
<P>
   An inquiry into human rights abuses could lead to the creation
of a war crimes tribunal similar to those investigating abuses in
Rwanda and the Balkans, Robinson said. ``It may be, in due course,
the question of a tribunal,'' she said. ``I have heard many
accounts that name names.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan hinted at the
possibility of war crimes trials for East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   In a blow to Indonesia's national pride, East Timor, a former
Portuguese colony, chose overwhelmingly two weeks ago to become
independent of the nation that has occupied it since 1975 at the
cost of some 200,000 lives. The referendum was organized by the
United Nations, fueling conspiracy theories here about the
intention of foreigners to break Indonesia apart.
</P>
<P>
   Since the results of the vote were announced, irregular militias
backed by the military have reportedly killed hundreds or even
thousands of people and have caused as many as 300,000 people from
the territory of 800,000 people to flee their homes.
</P>
<P>
   No amount of foreign pressure seems to have slowed the rampage
of the militias, and with the killings reportedly continuing, and
with tens of thousands of refugees facing starvation in the barren
hills, where many are hiding, concerns grew here over possible
delays in deploying the force.
</P>
<P>
   In this interim period, aid workers and diplomats said, the
militias could carry out a final cleansing of their enemies and
huge numbers of people could begin to starve.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are hundreds of thousands of refugees in various parts
of East Timor clustered in mountains without adequate food or with
no food at all, living on roots, living on whatever they can
scavenge'' a U.N. spokesman, David Wimhurst, said in Darwin,
Australia.
</P>
<P>
   In the streets of East Timor's capital, Dili, witnesses said
scavengers were picking through the ruins of burned and vandalized
buildings in search of food, water and other supplies.
</P>
<P>
   In a message from a remote stronghold of guerrillas who support
independence, a senior commander, Tuar Matan Ruak, sent a message
pleading for aid for refugees who have gathered there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have milk for the children _ this is a serious
problem,'' he said. ``In the small villages, the fires are the same
as Dili or even worse _ total chaos. The population has no help, no
protection, no food, no water and no medical supplies.''
</P>
<P>
   In agreeing to the international force on Sunday, Habibie said:
``We cannot wait any longer. We have to stop the suffering and
mourning now.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense Minister John Moore of Australia, which is leading the
planned force, said it's members could begin arriving within three
to five days of approval in New York.
</P>
<P>
   But both Indonesian officials and street protesters here,
seeking a voice in this extraordinary compromise of national
sovereignty, have begun demanding that several key nations be
excluded because they are seen to have pushed Indonesia too hard on
the issue of East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The armed forces will simply not accept the involvement of
Australian forces because there have been clashes of opinion
between some groups in the two countries,'' said the military's
chief spokesman, Brig. Gen. Sudradjat, speaking on television.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Such opposition could seriously compromise plans for the
peacekeeping force, which is expected to consist largely of
Australian troops and which is already being put into place in
Darwin, Australia, just 250 miles from East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   Though Indonesia's compliant parliament formally endorsed the
deployment Monday, a number of its members spoke out against what
they called interference or bullying by foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   As demonstrators in Jakarta and the country's second city,
Surabaya, staged the latest in a series of protests against
Australia and the United States, a parliamentary defense commission
said it objected to including those nations as well as New Zealand
and Portugal, the former colonial power in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The presence of these countries could lead to new disorders
because it has been clear they are not neutral,'' said the
commission chairwoman, Aisyah Amini. ``We have to reject them.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The influential daily newspaper Kompas joined the nationalist
backlash. It noted Monday that some of these same Western
governments had supported Indonesia's invasion of East Timor in
1975, one year after it was set free by Portugal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The international reaction to East Timor's problems has
whipped away the mask of Western governments,'' it wrote.
``Previously they supported invasion; now they threaten us.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   One diplomat said he could sympathize with the sense of national
hurt. Indonesians have been far less well-informed than the outside
world, both now and over the years, about military abuses in East
Timor.
</P>
<P>
   Most here do not share the outside outrage over the violence and
many are bewildered at the intense pressure that has been put on
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a huge loss of face here,'' the diplomat said. ``It is
an extraordinary thing for any nation to accept.'' He noted that
previous U.N. peacekeeping forces had been deployed in countries
that had broken down completely, such as Lebanon, Somalia, Haiti,
Rwanda and Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't think of another real country that peacekeepers have
been sent to,'' he said. ``The world really leaned on this place.
There's got to be a backlash to that.''

 &HT;    Tennessee hopes to finally slay Swamp demonBy Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   KNOXVILLE, Tenn. _ During Tennessee's 13-0 run to the national
championship in 1998, the Volunteers exorcised a lot of demons. But
they still have to slay one more monster.
</P>
<P>
   With all Tennessee has accomplished in the 1990s _ a 90-19-2
record, three SEC championships, one national championship _ it has
not won at Florida's Ben Hill Griffin Stadium, better known as the
Swamp. Four times this decade, Tennessee has marched into
Gainesville, Fla. with a team ranked eighth or better. Four times
it has lost.
</P>
<P>
   The No. 2-ranked Volunteers get their final chance to win in the
Swamp in the '90s on Saturday. The game against No. 4 Florida will
go a long way, as always, toward determining who wins the SEC East
and plays for the conference title in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee, which has lost six consecutive games in Gainesville,
dating to 1971, had a breakthrough last year when it beat Florida
20-17 in overtime in Knoxville and ended the Gators' five-game
winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   But as quarterback Tee Martin said recently, ``It's not a real
rivalry until we win down there.''
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee coach Phillip Fulmer says he has had some talented
teams struggle in the Swamp, but he points out that the Vols have
not been alone. Since Steve Spurrier became coach 1990, the Gators
are 55-2 at home. They have a 29-game winning streak dating to
1994, when Auburn won 36-33. Florida's only other loss at home was
to Florida State's 1993 national championship team, 33-21.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Florida) is a difficult place to play, but no more difficult
than any of the other places we go,'' Fulmer said. ``Their stadium
is pretty much like ours when it's rocking. But the thing that
makes it tough is the caliber of players Florida puts on the
field.''
</P>
<P>
   If Tennessee's players feel any trepidation about Saturday, they
haven't shown it. The Volunteers were off last week after opening
the season with a 42-17 win over Wyoming. They say they have been
putting the time to good use.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really, it's been business as usual, but that's the way this
team is,'' said Martin, 14-0 as a starter. ``We know that the team
that plays the best is going to win. We know the crowd is going to
be loud, but after everything this team has gone through, we should
be able to handle things like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee sees itself as a veteran team with resolve steeled by
last season's championship run, which required several
come-from-behind victories. In previous years the coaches and
players would be visibly tight during Florida week.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, for example, Fulmer took his team to Florida a
day earlier than normal with the stated intent of getting it better
acclimated to the heat. In retrospect, some said, it was another
sign of how big the game was to the Vols and another source of
anxiety for the players. Tennessee fell behind 14-0 after Tony
George returned a Peyton Manning interception 89 yards for a
touchdown, never recovered and lost 33-20.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of those ideas that, if it had worked, it would
have been pretty smart,'' Fulmer said. ``But it didn't, so it
didn't look too smart.''
</P>
<P>
   But last year, things changed. Tennessee was a looser and more
confident team before the Florida game. And it showed on the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think beating Florida last year and the way we finished up
the season gave this team a certain amount of confidence,'' Fulmer
said. ``That's certainly what we try to build on. We got over one
hump last year, and now we're trying to get over another.
</P>
<P>
   ``Physically, (this team is) as good a team as we've ever taken
down there. When we're healthy, there are no apparent weaknesses.
Now, whether we're really that good remains to be seen.''

 By SOMINI SENGUPTA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ She spent her days at home with her newborn son,
knowing that every day she did not work was another day without
money to pay back her $20,000 smugglers' debt. She spent her nights
awake, hushing the baby so he would not disturb her husband or the
three other restaurant workers who shared their three-room
apartment. She named the boy Henry, and for four precious months
she nursed him, even after friends warned that she would soon have
to let him go.
</P>
<P>
   On the second Thursday in July, the woman, Xiu, finally did so.
Fastening a tiny gold bracelet around his wrist, she placed her son
in the arms of a friend of a friend, who, for $1,000, agreed to
take him to China.
</P>
<P>
   Xiu's mother is raising him there now, along with the
10-year-old daughter left behind last year when Xiu joined her
husband in New York. She plans to bring Henry back when he reaches
school age. But until then, she remains here, waiting to be a
mother to her child. For weeks after Henry was shipped off, she
thought she heard him cry at night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed like she just gave up the baby to a complete
stranger,'' said Sara Lee, a social worker at the St. Vincent's
Hospital Chinatown Clinic, interpreting for Xiu one recent morning.
``It's really killing her. She said no words can express her
sadness.''
</P>
<P>
   Xiu's story has become increasingly common among the city's
newest Chinese immigrants. Working long hours in garment factories
for paltry pay, lacking affordable child care and the safety net of
an extended family, growing numbers of Chinese immigrant women _ a
great many of whom, like Xiu, are here illegally _ are sending
their infants back to China, according to social workers and labor
organizers who work with them.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the mothers are married. Some of their pregnancies,
though not all, are planned. And many give birth knowing that soon
they too may end up sending their babies away.
</P>
<P>
   The children, U.S. citizens by birth, are usually raised by
grandparents, a practice that is customary in China, as it is in
many other parts of the world. The expectation, though hardly a
guarantee, is that the children will be summoned back when they are
old enough to begin school. It is a reunion that often comes at
considerable emotional cost to parents and children, in the opinion
of doctors and social workers.
</P>
<P>
   Their story is another example of the way families have been and
continue to be fractured by immigration. Men and women from all
over the world come to the United States, leaving children with
relatives back home until they gain a foothold in this country. And
some immigrant parents send their American children, particularly
teen-agers, to the old country, hoping to save them from troubled
city streets.
</P>
<P>
   Sending infants to the old country is not unique to the Chinese.
But social service agencies working in other immigrant communities
say that while it is not unheard of, the practice is still uncommon
and is usually limited to cases of extreme hardship. Among
Dominicans, for instance, it is generally young, single mothers who
send their children back, social workers say.
</P>
<P>
   For Chinese women, there is an additional cruel dilemma: Having
left China and its rigid one-child policy, they are finally able to
have larger families without fear of penalties or recrimination.
But as poor, illegal immigrants here, they say, they are hard
pressed to take care of their young.
</P>
<P>
   That more of these mothers are sending their babies back, people
who work with them say, reflects the tougher working and living
conditions facing Chinese immigrants today.
</P>
<P>
   With the threat of factories moving abroad and a steady supply
of cheap, illegal immigrant labor, mostly from Fujian province in
southern China, a new generation of garment sweatshops has
blossomed across the city in recent years, according to garment
workers' advocates and those who study Chinese immigration. As a
result, piece-rate wages have steadily fallen, and it is
increasingly common for garment shops to require employees to work
weekends.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people simply have no time for their children,'' said
Joanne Lum of the Chinese Staff and Workers Association, who works
with garment workers in Chinatown and the Sunset Park neighborhood
of Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Since her son was sent home, Xiu has returned to work. She sews
women's pants six days a week and sends home $200 each month. At
least every other week, she calls home. Every time, her daughter,
Kei Wan, asks her to return home.
</P>
<P>
   Kei Wan's chances of coming here any time soon are slim at best,
her mother said, since she would have to be smuggled in at great
expense.
</P>
<P>
   This was not the picture Xiu had in mind when her husband
summoned her here. They had been apart for eight years _ she
raising their little girl in a small town in southern China, he
working as a cook at a Chinese restaurant in Manhattan. When Xiu
finally arrived, she brought with her little more than nervous
dreams: to work hard, save money, raise a bigger, more prosperous
family than she could imagine back home.
</P>
<P>
   In a matter of months, Xiu became pregnant. And that is when she
learned of this unforeseen aspect of the immigrant trajectory.
``It's not easy,'' she said, fingering the pictures of her children
that she keeps in a plastic picture album, ``to be a mother here.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not illegal to send these American-born children to China.
They are U.S. citizens and can travel on U.S. passports; their
couriers are legal residents and so are allowed to travel back and
forth. But while social workers and others say the practice is well
known and widespread in New York's Chinese immigrant community,
that is not to say that the mothers are eager to discuss it.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, while workers at clinics across the city said they knew
of many cases, only a handful of mothers agreed to speak to a
reporter, and they would give only their first names. None agreed
to be photographed.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly most Chinese immigrants do not send their babies back.
They manage by staying home, imploring an elderly relative to
baby-sit or paying for child care. Day care costs at least $20 a
day in Chinatown these days _ a formidable amount for a garment
worker like Xiu, who, even in a good, six-day workweek, takes home
less than $300.
</P>
<P>
   How many women send their babies back is not known. At the
Chinatown Health Center, 10 percent to 20 percent of the babies
delivered last year were sent back, according to Celia Ng, the
nursing coordinator. And at the St. Vincent's Hospital Chinatown
clinic, according to Ms. Lee, one-third to one-half of the women
who seek prenatal care say they plan to send their children to
China.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A couple of years ago, Ms. Lee saw a flier in the clinic
bathroom: For a fee _ the going rate these days is $1,000, plus air
fare _ someone was offering to take babies back to China.
</P>
<P>
   Around that time, she began to notice an increase in the number
of women sending their babies to China. And she made it a part of
her practice to ask all her prenatal patients what they planned to
do after giving birth.
</P>
<P>
   Today, she tells each one how painful it can be for a mother to
send an infant back _ and for a father as well, though fathers are
more likely to have been separated from their children for many
years. She explains how difficult it can be when the child finally
comes back _ but as a stranger.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine being separated from my kids,'' confessed Ms.
Lee, whose own children are 1 and 3. ``But they have a problem, no
matter what.''
</P>
<P>
   Zhu, a single woman from Guangdong province, says that sending
her child home is the only way she can imagine surviving in this
country.
</P>
<P>
   Just before her first child, Thomas, was born last month, Zhu,
36, gave up her job as a home health aide in Brooklyn. Since then,
she has lived on her savings, but she fears they will soon be
exhausted. So when the Lunar New Year rolls around in February,
Zhu, unmarried and alone in New York, plans to take the child to
China, where her own mother will raise him for a few years, until
Zhu can afford to have him by her side once more.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily for Zhu, she has a green card. She can take Thomas back
herself. From time to time, she can even visit.
</P>
<P>
   That good fortune is beyond Xiu's reach. The other day, the two
mothers sat next to each other at the St. Vincent's Hospital
Chinatown clinic _ Xiu keeping her eyes on baby Thomas, sleeping
against his mother's belly, Zhu admiring the pictures of Xiu's
children.
</P>
<P>
   They were talking of the choices they had made, and Xiu was
wiping away irrepressible tears.
</P>
<P>
   How hard it was, she said, to walk into the clinic that morning
and see babies in their mothers' arms. How hard it was, she said,
when the woman who took Henry home called to say that he had cried
incessantly on the one-and-a-half-day journey. At least, she said,
she had nursed him for the first four months of his life. She would
feel so guilty otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Would it have been easier, she wondered aloud, if she had been
younger? From across the table came a quick reply from Angel, an
immigrant from Guangdong. Five years ago, when she was only 28, her
husband chose to send their daughter back home. It wasn't any
easier, she said.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Angel said, she felt she had no choice. She had a
good job at a photo shop in Chinatown, and her boss had agreed to
let her take a month off after the pregnancy. There was no one to
watch the baby all day, and not enough money for a baby sitter.
Barely 4 weeks old, the baby was sent away.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, when Angel managed to bring her back to New
York, the little girl seemed as miserable as her mother had been
when she sent her away. She sat on the sofa in the living room of
their apartment in Queens and cried quietly and without
explanation.
</P>
<P>
   A small, sprightly woman who looks half her age, Angel still
cries when she summons the memory. If nothing else, it has taught
her one lesson. She says she is not planning to have any more
children.

 &HT;    By Earnest Reese

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When Florida A&AMP;M and Tennessee State meet Saturday in
the 11th annual Atlanta Classic at the Georgia Dome, the longtime
rivals will be fighting for cloth as well as for the victory.
</P>
<P>
   The winner will take home a unique flag that captures the
essence of both schools _ thus, the theme of the game: ``The Fury
for the Flag.''
</P>
<P>
   TSU third-year coach L.C. Cole's team has taken two impressive
victories over SWAC teams as it comes to town for the classic,
sponsored by 100 Black Men of Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``Considering what FAMU has done to us the last few years, it
would really be great if we could take that flag back home and hang
it up somewhere,'' Cole said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rattlers have beaten the Tigers eight years in a row,
including five times in the Classic. A crowd of 51,742 watched FAMU
win 31-23 a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach (Billy) Joe has a great program,'' Cole said.
``Hopefully, we've closed the gap on them going into this game.''
</P>
<P>
   In its first two games of the season, TSU knocked off Alabama
State 41-8 and defeated highly regarded Jackson State 48-33.
</P>
<P>
   FAMU last weekend reached 1-1 after doing to Norfolk State what
No. 8 Miami did to the Rattlers the week before. Behind sophomore
quarterback Quinn Gray, who took a shot to the rib cage early in
the first quarter against Miami and sat out the rest of the 57-3
loss, the Rattlers waxed their MEAC rival 56-7.
</P>
<P>
   Gray threw for 381 yards and four touchdowns against Norfolk
State.
</P>
<P>
   His primary receiver has not been often double-teamed
All-American junior Jacquay Nunnally (12 catches, 106 yards) but
senior Cainon Lamb, who had five receptions for 111 yards and a
touchdown against Norfolk. Unlike 1998, when its offense produced
Division I-AA-leading averages of 521 yards and 45.7 points per
game, FAMU's success this year might lie with its defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our defense is much improved,'' Joe said, noting the size,
speed and strength of his players. ``We've also got more depth than
we've had before.''
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA CLASSIC
</P>
<P>
   _ Who: Florida A&AMP;M (1-1) vs. Tennessee State (2-0).
</P>
<P>
   _ When, where: 3:30 p.m. Saturday; Georgia Dome.
</P>
<P>
   _ Tickets: $20 and $25, available at Ticketmaster outlets and
Georgia Dome box office.

 &HT;    OFFICIALS SAY FLOYD MAY BE A 'WORST POSSIBLE CASE' HURRICANE
 &HT;    Eds: New first 5 grafs with material from afternoon meeting.
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ This could be the storm FEMA Director James Lee
Witt has been dreading since taking office six years ago: a
catastrophic hurricane that hugs the coastline from Florida to the
Carolinas, causing massive damage along a swath hundreds of miles
long.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've tried to prepare for the worst possible case, and this
is one of those cases,'' said Witt, head of the Federal Emergency
Management Agency after concluding a video conference with
emergency teams spread out across the country.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of an extremely powerful, coast-hugging hurricane
``was a scenario that ever since I've been here I've hoped I'd
never see,'' Witt said Monday, noting that the destruction could
cover ``not just one area, it's the whole coastline and the
pounding it's going to take.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Loomis, reporting to Witt from the Florida Division of
Emergency Management in a late afternoon video conference, said
``if this parallels us, it could act like a Weed-Eater for 25 miles
along the coast. Most of those counties don't have population
inland, they sit right on the coast, so it's going to be pretty
devastating as far as who is going to get hit.''
</P>
<P>
   FEMA officials say that regardless of where Hurricane Floyd
strikes, the federal response will be far different from the tardy
answer to Hurricane Andrew seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of things going on that were not going on six
years ago,'' said Lacy Suiter, Federal Emergency Management
Agency's executive associate director.
</P>
<P>
   When Andrew slammed into Florida just south of Miami in August
1992, the tardy and disjointed federal response sparked cries of
anger from state and local authorities and prompted then-President
Bush to name his transportation secretary to coordinate the federal
effect.
</P>
<P>
   FEMA officials Monday said the agency has changed dramatically
since then. They said they were ready to roll and could have
supplies into an affected area within hours after the Floyd's
passage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The federal government is being not just reactive to events
and the requests of the governors, but we're being pro-active,''
Suiter said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not waiting until the hurricane comes ashore to buy the
ice and buy the water and get the generators ready and get the
other things ready to move out to the area. We're doing it now in
anticipation of what the requirements might be,'' Suiter said.
``We've been through this enough to know what to anticipate and
what to plan for.''
</P>
<P>
   FEMA emergency response centers have been activated in Atlanta
and Washington, and it has representatives at state emergency
centers from Florida to North Carolina. A hurricane liaison team of
federal emergency officials is also stationed at the National
Hurricane Center in Miami to monitor the latest forecasts of the
storm's path and intensity.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, FEMA has positioned ice, water, plastic sheeting,
cots, tents, and emergency food and medial supplies in Atlanta
where they can be delivered within hours wherever Floyd hits land,
said Bruce Baughman, FEMA director of response.
</P>
<P>
   There are more than 30,000 rolls of plastic sheeting _ enough to
cover 25,000 roofless houses _ and some 100 tons of ice, he said.
The supplies are being kept in Atlanta, rather than closer to where
the hurricane might hit, in order to protect them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Depending on the track (taken by the storm) you don't want to
get it too far forward because the supplies themselves may become a
victim,'' Baughman said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the supplies on hand, FEMA has contracted with
suppliers to provide additional support such as debris removal,
roofing repairs and bulk water if needed, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the federal government is urging individuals to
prepare by making their property as hurricane-proof as possible _
such as removing lawn furniture _ and listening to local government
warnings. Residents also are urged to check the FEMA Internet site
for other tips at www.fema.gov.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a serious storm,'' Suiter said. ``It may be the worst
storm that we have had in many, many years.''

 &HT;    Quarterback questions put possible contenders in limbo
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Jets and Tampa Bay Bucaneers were considered
playoff contenders, but after Week 1 both teams already are
fighting for survival because of concerns at quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets, looking for their first trip to the Super Bowl since
1968, lost starter Vinny Testaverde for the rest of the season
after he ruptured an Achilles' tendon in their 30-28 loss to New
England.
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde, the AFC's leading passer last season who hadn't
missed a game since 1997, was injured in the second quarter.
Testaverde fell to the artificial turf after tailback Curtis Martin
fumbled and was injured with no one within five feet of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was never in pain until I reached the locker room,''
Testaverde said Monday after he underwent surgery. ``It was knowing
that my season was over, and it was just frustrating for me. I will
stay positive about it and continue to support my teammates and try
to fulfill our expectations and goals for this team.''
</P>
<P>
   Journeyman Rick Mirer, a No. 1 pick of the Seattle Seahawks in
1993, will take over at quarterback. tMirer joined the Jets only
three weeks ago in a trade with the Green Bay Packers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here, the quarterback doesn't need to make tons of decisions
at the line, just execute plays,'' Mirer said. ``I just need to get
up to speed.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Tampa Bay coach Tony Dungy isn't saying who will
start at quarterback in Sunday's contest at Philadelphia. Starter
Trent Dilfer looked like an amateur in throwing three interceptions
in the Bucs' 17-13 loss to the New York Giants. His backup, former
Georgia star Eric Zeier, also was ineffective, completing only 3 of
11 passes and throwing one interception.
</P>
<P>
   Rough start
</P>
<P>
   The expansion Cleveland Browns weren't expected to win many
games this season, but no one expected them to play that poorly in
their debut. The Browns had only two first downs and failed to
convert a third-down play in their 43-0 loss to Pittsburgh.
Cleveland, outgained 460-40, had just nine rushing yards, its
lowest output since a six-yard effort against the Giants in
November 1960.
</P>
<P>
   Rough start II
</P>
<P>
   Seattle, playing its first game under new coach Mike Holmgren,
was an eight-point favorite at home against Detroit, which lost
All-Pro tailback Barry Sanders to retirement and wideout Herman
Moore to a knee injury in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   But the Seahawks took a nose dive under Holmgren. Quarterback
Jon Kitna was sacked on the first play _ a failed flea flicker _
and former Georgia kicker Todd Peterson missed a 32-yard field-goal
attempt.
</P>
<P>
   The special teams also were abysmal, as former Georgia Tech star
Charlie Rogers fumbled a punt return at his own 5, which led to a
Detroit touchdown. Later, long-snapper Deems May sent a snap over
punter Jeff Feagles' head for a safety, giving Detroit an 18-0 lead
with nine minutes left in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Offensive tops
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis left tackle Orlando Pace held Ravens defensive end
Michael McCrary without a sack and only three tackles. McCrary,
coming off knee surgery, looked out of shape and winded. . . .
Dallas quarterback Troy Aikman threw for 362 yards and a
career-high five touchdowns. . . Indianapolis left tackle Tarik
Glenn held Buffalo end Bruce Smith to only three tackles. Colts
quarterback Peyton Manning, who threw for 284 yards and two
touchdowns, wasn't sacked in 33 pass attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive tops
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore linebacker Ray Lewis had 14 solo tackles and returned
an interception 60 yards. . . . Patriots defensive end Willie
McGinest took advantage of the Jets' inexperienced offensive
linemen for two sacks and a fumble recovery. . . . Giants free
safety Percy Ellsworth intercepted two of Dilfer's passes in the
fourth quarter. New York had four interceptions, including one by
rookie Andre Weathers, who returned it eight yards for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Truly special
</P>
<P>
   Speedy Jacksonville wide receiver Alvis Whitted beat San
Francisco's kick-return coverage and forced R.W. McQuarters to
fumble. Jaguars reserve cornerback Jason Craft scooped up the ball
and returned it 23 yards for a touchdown and a 17-3 lead in the
third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Introducing
</P>
<P>
   Jacksonville cornerback Fernando Bryant, a first-round draft
pick from Alabama, made his first start in the Jaguars' 41-3
blowout of the 49ers. Bryant was matched up against his boyhood
idol _ San Francisco wide receiver Jerry Rice. Bryant still has an
autographed picture of Rice, whom he held to two catches for 17
yards.
</P>
<P>
   Stat stuff
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in 39 games _ a drought that extended into
November 1996 _ Dallas scored a touchdown on its opening drive.
Cowboys tight end David LaFleur capped the nine-play, 80-yard drive
with a 15-yard scoring grab.
</P>
<P>
   Etc.
</P>
<P>
   Former Georgia All-America cornerback Champ Bailey gave up a
34-yard pass to Dallas wideout Michael Irvin on his first play, but
he held Irvin in check for most of two quarters. However, Bailey
missed the final three minutes of regulation and all of overtime
with cramps. . . . The Cowboys have 20 consecutive wins when Irvin
and running back Emmitt Smith each have 100-yard games. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Dallas owner Jerry Jones says that an NFL official told him the
length of defensive tackle Leon Lett's suspension will be announced
today. ``I haven't heard what the length will be,'' said Jones, who
declined further comment. In July, the NFL announced that Lett
would be suspended indefinitely for violating the league's
substance-abuse policy for the third time since 1995. Lett is
expected to receive a suspension of at least four games. . . .
</P>
<P>
   New Orleans defensive end Brady Smith, who replaced injured star
Joe Johnson, had 2 1/2 sacks against the Panthers. . . . The
Cowboys put former Alabama star Michael Myers on the inactive list
before Sunday's game, after he fell behind Nathan Davis and rookie
Brandon Noble at defensive tackle. . . . New Dallas left tackle
Flozell ``Hotel'' Adams gave up a sack to former Georgia Tech star
Marco Coleman on the first play but blocked well on running plays.
Coleman finished with six tackles. . . . The Packers have taken the
first steps in recovering 80 percent of a $3.5-million signing
bonus to retired wideout Robert Brooks, who played just one season
of a five-year deal he signed in February 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The last word
</P>
<P>
   ``To list all the little things that made (Cowboys wide
receiver) Raghib Ismail's 76-yard overtime touchdown possible would
require a sheet of paper longer than the distance between (Dallas
cornerback) Kevin Mathis and the receivers he can't cover.'' _
Dallas Morning News columnist Tim Cowlishaw on Ismail's
game-winning grab in overtime in the Cowboys' 41-35 victory at
Washington

WACO NEWS NO SURPRISE _ FBI LACKS RESTRAINT

Amendment commentary. His email address is

<P>
   Why should anyone be surprised at the inquiry into the Federal
Bureau of Investigation's role in the siege of the Branch Davidian
compound in Waco, Texas, in 1993?
</P>
<P>
   Why should anyone be surprised that the FBI and the Department
of Justice may have attempted to cover up the use of incendiary
tear gas projectiles that might have started the fire that killed
80 members of the Davidian group?
</P>
<P>
   This nation has paid a price every time Congress has granted the
FBI too much power and exercised too little oversight.
Accountability is the issue here. Congress must at least share the
blame for not reining in the enormous powers of the bureau.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI has a difficult job fighting organized crime, public
corruption and terrorism aimed at Americans. One of its tasks is to
protect us from the militant radicals among us who would kill for
some political ideal. For the most part, the FBI does its job well.
For the most part, it has resisted petty corruption. But as with
any law enforcement agency, it needs strict oversight. And it needs
to be held to the legal standards required by the Constitution and
the Bill of Rights.
</P>
<P>
   Where law enforcement confronts the suspect is where
constitutional protections of the individual come into play. And a
law enforcement agency subject to little oversight is likely to
overlook the niceties of constitutional law.
</P>
<P>
   We do no favors to any law enforcement agency by not holding it
accountable. Someday the facts will come out. But the damage will
have been done. And the agency responsible for acts of lawlessness
will lose its credibility and its effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement depends upon the cooperation of the citizenry.
When citizens are too scared to cooperate or too skeptical of a law
enforcement agency, then important information may be delayed or
even lost.
</P>
<P>
   On the other end of the spectrum, when a law enforcement agency
is on a loose tether, it may build a tradition of ignoring the
rights of suspects -- an underground, unspoken tradition that is
all too difficult to break, as a number of major urban centers,
like Chicago and New York City, have come to realize.
</P>
<P>
   This is a nation born of dissent. It is a part of our character.
Most of us cherish this aspect of liberty. There is little doubt,
when one looks at the history of our nation, or any nation, for
that matter, that dissent is a significant part of political
freedom.
</P>
<P>
   At key junctures, movements of political and social dissent have
changed the direction of our nation, made us open to greater
diversity and helped us include segments of our society that had
been ignored, excluded, or forced into ghettos.
</P>
<P>
   Those of us who saw or participated in the civil rights movement
of the 1950s and '60s know that it was essential in order to make
white Americans face their darker brothers and sisters. The
movement helped secure a semblance of equality for racial
minorities, though the battle is not over yet. Still, it was a step
forward.
</P>
<P>
   Convinced that communists had infiltrated the civil rights
movement, the FBI played a sinister role during those years,
tapping civil rights leaders' telephones, manufacturing phony
evidence against them and attempting to discredit the leaders of
that great movement. It was an out-of-control FBI run by a man who
had been in power too long, J. Edgar Hoover.
</P>
<P>
   Those of us who saw or joined the `free love/free drugs`
protesters of the 1960s understood the movement as a reaction
against the straightjacket militarism and anti-communist hysteria
that had gripped our nation in the '50s. We may not have welcomed
the extremes to which the dissenters took us, but we understood it.
The FBI was there, too, taking photographs, wiretapping phone lines
and interfering with the free speech rights of demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
   The political dissent of the 1970s against the Vietnam War,
whether we agreed with it or not, played an important role as a
check on our elected leaders and the nation's foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   The environmental movement that began with the celebration of
the first Earth Day, April 22, 1970, was also under surveillance
and infiltrated by the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Former Sen. Frank Church, D-Idaho, chaired a Senate committee to
probe FBI activities and found that in the mid-1970s, the FBI had
conducted a widespread campaign of monitoring and disrupting
political groups engaged in legal demonstrations and activities.
The target groups were as disparate as Vietnam protesters and the
women's liberation movement.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of our long and honorable tradition of political
dissent, the FBI conducted a massive campaign against these
dissenters: breaking into homes and offices; bugging them; placing
wiretaps on home and office phone lines; spreading misinformation
to discredit the groups; and FBI infiltrators attempted to provoke
protesters to commit illegal actions.
</P>
<P>
   The Church Committee published a six-volume report that
documented these despicable FBI's tactics. With all their
activities, the FBI produced very little evidence of criminal
conduct on the part of political protesters.
</P>
<P>
   Congress initiated a series of reforms after the Church
Committee report, but they didn't last. And congressional oversight
once again became blind.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the FBI continues to investigate Muslims, Arab-Americans,
Palestinians, environmental activists, those protesting America's
policies in South America and even members of Amnesty
International.
</P>
<P>
   The Antiterrorism Act of 1996 has made it possible for the FBI
to deport foreigners based upon secret evidence, that not even the
defendant's lawyer can see. The law has made it a criminal act to
support the humanitarian activities of selected foreign groups. And
the law has made it possible for the FBI to, once again,
investigate those who are exercising their First Amendment rights
of free speech, dissent and freedom of association.
</P>
<P>
   It would be wise for Congress to conduct an in-depth probe of
FBI activities after the independent review of the Waco disaster,
headed by former Republican Sen. John Danforth, is completed. The
FBI needs the restraint of careful oversight -- the nation needs
it.

<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Six years ago, GE Capital's Japanese presence consisted
chiefly of Taketo Yamakawa, a one-man show in a small office,
scrambling to come up with business opportunities in a stifled
economy.
</P>
<P>
   GE Capital, the biggest and most profitable unit of General
Electric, one of America's biggest and most profitable
corporations, had just bought a Japanese credit card company that
it saw as its gateway to Asia and had put Yamakawa in charge. ``I
was struggling, trying to identify businesses and companies that GE
could do,'' Yamakawa recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, GE Capital has done plenty. Barely in the time it
has taken for Asia to begin to recover from its economic collapse,
GE Capital has gone on an acquisition binge that has solidified its
position as a global financial powerhouse, left many of its
competitors in the dust and bestowed a much-needed vote of
corporate American confidence on the ailing but now improving
region.
</P>
<P>
   The last two years alone, it has made at least eight major
investments in four Asian countries, expanding its assets to about
$20 billion in the region. Acquisitions included two
consumer-credit businesses, a life insurance company and a $5
billion leasing company in Japan, a consumer-credit business and a
portfolio of car loans in Thailand and a life insurance unit in the
Philippines. It also has its sights on a stake in a South Korean
bank.
</P>
<P>
   Though its GE parent has operated in Japan for more than a
century, GE Capital traditionally had been weak in Asia, Japan
included. So, company executives began sniffing around the region
in the early 1990s with an eye to setting up corporate alliances or
building companies from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   Then the 1997 Asian financial meltdown and resulting recession
turned the area into a vast bargain basement. Here was GE Capital's
chance to buy up distressed companies and establish itself in the
one part of the world where it lacked a strong presence.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that financial turmoil has resulted in an
environment that facilitates deal creation,'' Denis J. Nayden,
president of GE Capital, said in a telephone interview from the
company's headquarters in Stamford, Conn. ``Yes, we have moved into
that opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, weaving those disparate businesses into the GE
corporate net has not been easy. Throughout Asia, and particularly
in Japan, culture clashes and resistance to foreign dominance have
historically curbed the market for acquisitions, and some companies
that have swooped in have crash-landed.
</P>
<P>
   But GE Capital has had a lot of practice in business
integration. Over the last 12 years, it has absorbed more than 300
companies, growing into the world's largest nonbank financial
institution, with $300 billion in assets. In the process, it has
mastered the art of identifying and acquiring underperforming
companies and using its management expertise to turn them into
moneymakers.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first plums that GE Capital plucked in Japan in the
wake of the economic crisis was the consumer-finance business of
the Lake Corp. Yamakawa, who today oversees GE Capital's
consumer-finance operations in Japan, had long been impressed by
Lake's lending business but believed its expansion into real estate
and stocks was a big mistake.
</P>
<P>
   As the company's financial problems worsened in late 1997,
Yamakawa pounced. Though GE Capital would not say what it paid, it
folded Lake's profitable operations _ its 2,800 people, its
computer network, its buildings and its customers _ into a new
company last year that it named the Lake Co., leaving the golf
courses and other sagging properties in the original one.
</P>
<P>
   Yamakawa then visited as many of Lake's 564 branches as he
could, often making the rounds on weekends. He centralized some of
the back-office operations and set up a call center, raising
productivity and cutting costs. Most important, he brought in
discipline _ in planning the business, budgeting for costs and
charting out both short- and long-term strategies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally a Japanese company does not have discipline,''
Yamakawa said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the new Lake wants to become Japan's most efficient, most
profitable consumer-finance company. Already, it is achieving
double-digit growth, using giveaway umbrellas or lottery tickets to
coax 1.5 million customers into transferring their accounts from
the old Lake.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Lake charges 27 percent on its unsecured consumer
loans, compared with Japanese bank-deposit rates of around
three-tenths of a percent, customers are flocking to its automated
loan machines. What drives them is the ease of the transactions: If
their applications are approved, the machines spew out the cash on
the spot. Indeed, borrowers often pick up the cash in the morning
and repay in the evening at another machine.

TOKYO: another machine.
<TEXT>
<P>
   While GE Capital has accumulated an estimated $5 billion in
assets elsewhere in Asia, Japan is the main arena of action. Its
assets here total around $15 billion, and it has set a target of
earning $500 million a year from its Japanese operations within two
years, up from last year, though the company refuses to disclose
figures. That growth would far outpace the time it took to reach a
similar figure in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Another Japanese prize for GE Capital was a joint venture last
year with Toho Mutual Life, an ailing insurer. Basically, GE
cherry-picked the best employees and most profitable operations and
put them into a new company called GE Edison. It then sent in an
advance team headed by one of its so-called integration
specialists, Masanori Miyajima, to coach Toho Mutual executives on
the ``GE way.''
</P>
<P>
   Miyajima introduced the GE practice of using graphs and charts
in presentations and explained the principles of Six Sigma, a
statistical-control management method that GE has embraced for
achieving high quality and minimal defects in its products.
</P>
<P>
   The integration team initiated studies of Edison's problems and
ways to improve operations. It also helped draw up 90-day, one-year
and 18-month plans for restructuring the business, setting the
stage for its review process. (Typically, if an acquisition falls
short of targets for an 18-month plan, GE concludes that something
serious is wrong and reassesses the acquisition.)
</P>
<P>
   By August, GE Capital was examining how to redesign the business
practices at Edison's headquarters and at all 56 of its branches.
The old system was unwieldy: A customer seeking a benefit payment
at a branch office would fill out a form, the office would enter
the claim in its computer and then send the form by mail to the
head office, which would retype it into its computer.
</P>
<P>
   Miyajima's group transferred the claims operation to a central
location in the city of Yokohama, outside Tokyo. Now, branch
offices relay all information to the new customer care center. As a
result, said Rone Baldwin, the former president of GE Japan who now
runs GE Edison, claims are paid more quickly, productivity has shot
up 30 percent and overhead has gone down.
</P>
<P>
   Miyajima also sought to instill the more informal GE culture at
a company that had long been obsessed with protocol. He instituted
casual-dress Fridays and instructed employees to dispense with
honorifics like ``director'' for their superiors and replace them
with the simple ``Mr.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Japanese seemed to adapt to the new openness, their
American managers said they had remained vigilant. ``I find that a
larger proportion of people tend to think in hierarchical kinds of
terms,'' Baldwin said. ``People are sometimes more reluctant to
speak up or be aggressive to senior people. I have to engage them
more. I always worry about what I'm not hearing than what I'm
hearing.''
</P>
<P>
   Baldwin is trying to change other Japanese habits as well, like
the practice of branch managers' greeting him at the train station
when he comes to town. He tells them he would rather they stay in
the office and work, and his campaign has apparently paid off. A
regional manager in Osaka drew cheers from the other participants
at a strategy meeting not long ago when he turned to him and said:
``Baldwin-san, please understand if I don't escort you back to the
train station. I'd rather use the time to work on my strategy
plan.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a small but significant triumph in GE Capital's effort to
instill a global GE culture wherever it goes. Daniel H. Mudd,
president of GE Capital Japan, says that driving home its core
concepts across its global empire is a key engine for the company's
growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some companies have a very strong financial system that
regulates and governs what they do, and some companies have a very
strong marketing orientation: Coca-Cola, American Express,'' Mudd
said. ``My own view is that the way GE uses its levers is with
culture, the business culture. It's not national culture. It's not
an American culture, not an Anglo-Saxon culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``The challenge is taking that set of values and keeping their
meaning the same, but adapting the interpretation to work in
different countries,'' he added. ``We want employees to intuitively
share and understand a set of values and that GE culture, whether
they're in Mexico, Japan, Spain or the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, of course, the GE way can seem downright bizarre to
the American company's new Japanese employees. A few months ago, GE
Capital held one of its signature let-your-hair-down workout
sessions at Japan Leasing, which it acquired late last year for $5
billion. These discussions, aimed at breaking apart a business and
drawing up new approaches that focus on the customer, have been a
successful tool for integrating Asian businesses into the company,
and in this case they led to fiery debate, with sheets of paper
covered with captions and colored ink pasted up around the room.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese rarely air their dirty laundry in public, so it was a
bit intimidating for Japan Leasing's managers to be summoned to an
open forum to discuss what was wrong and how to improve.
</P>
<P>
   ``The language of the workout is very new to Japan, and the
discussion style is also new to Japanese,'' said Kohei Tanaka,
president of the new Japan Leasing. ``When we gave notice to people
to please join the workout, people thought, `What the heck is this
thing?'''
</P>
<P>
   Now employees regularly try to break apart the business to find
new solutions, and these organized debating sessions are becoming a
way of life at Japan Leasing. That is a departure from the old
style.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Japan, we understand each others' intention, even without
saying anything,'' Tanaka said. ``All employees join the company at
the same time in April and midcareer employees are not common. It's
a homogeneous culture. The culture is to expect without saying
anything.''

AS IRAQIS STARVE, U.S. ASSERTS, THEIR LEADERS LIVE IN LUXURY
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The United States, which is seeking to force a new
weapons inspection program on Iraq, said Monday that it had new
evidence showing that President Saddam Hussein had spent money to
build a sprawling amusement park to entertain his political
followers instead of feeding hungry Iraqis.
</P>
<P>
   In a report intended to convince other governments to retain
tough economic sanctions on Iraq, the State Department said the
entertainment complex was detected in aerial photographs. The
declassified photographs also substantiated reports that Hussein
had recently bulldozed villages where anti-government protests had
taken place.
</P>
<P>
   The photographs, the report said, showed that the Iraqi
government had built a lakeside village resort near Baghdad _
including an amusement park, sports stadiums and special hospitals
_ for use by members of his political party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite its claims that the people of Iraq are dying due to a
lack of food and medicine, Saddam Hussein doesn't hesitate to spend
hundreds of millions of dollars for the entertainment of Baath
party officials and cadres,'' said James P. Rubin, the department's
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Department officials would not say if the photographs were taken
by satellite or by spy plane.
</P>
<P>
   The report was released two days before a meeting in London in
which the United States and Britain will try to persuade government
representatives from China, France and Russia to support a
resolution in the U.N. Security Council to renew international
weapons inspections on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution would create a new agency to replace the
so-called U.N. Special Commission, or Unscom, which conducted
weapons inspections until it was thrown out of Iraq last year,
prompting a fierce American-led bombing campaign. The Chinese,
French and Russians have resisted new sanctions on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Baghdad has insisted that economic sanctions imposed
on the country after the 1991 Persian Gulf war have resulted in
malnutrition and a shortage of basic medicines. The sanctions were
supposed to remain in place until Iraq proved that it had
dismantled its means to make chemical, biological and nuclear
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   But the State Department said that shortages of food and
medicine were the fault of the Iraqi government, which has
stockpiled food and medicine purchased under a U.N. oil-for-food
program instead of distributing it properly. And billions of
dollars made available to Iraq to buy food and medicine under the
program have gone unspent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government has failed to distribute about 50 percent of
the medicine, about 60 percent of the supplies for clean water and
agriculture and 40 percent for education,'' Rubin said. ``So what
we see here is a situation where Saddam Hussein is clearly not
allowing the food, medicine and water to be distributed that would
improve the lot of the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is that in Iraq, Saddam Hussein controls
everything,'' Rubin continued. ``He decides who gets what and he
has decided to deprive the Iraqi people of many basic requirements
while providing luxuries _ and their very own Ferris wheel _ to a
small clique of regime supporters.''

NEW LIFE FOR OLD MILES  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 19) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Conn.)   (af)  
 By BETSY WADE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kevin Feeney of New Canaan, Conn., is a frequent flier devotee.
Or more correctly, a frequent buyer obsessive. Feeney, who works in
financial data, says he buys almost nothing if he cannot get
frequent flier-buyer or guest points on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a requirement for the colleges my daughter is considering
that they allow payment with a Visa card,'' he said. ``Fortunately,
I guess, that seems to let out most of the Ivy League.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So there have been things for him to think about of late. Last
month, United, American and Delta eased up on rules governing the
expiration of accumulated miles. They will now maintain miles in an
account if they see virtually any evidence the participant is still
using the account. At Continental, Northwest and US Airways, miles
did not expire. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   American started the ball rolling the first week in August by
saying that miles would no longer expire for its members so long as
they earned or redeemed a mile every 36 months. But pre-1996 miles
that have expired remained gone. The airline explained its policies
at www.aaa.com. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   United, the giant among frequent-flier programs, came along Aug.
10 and went one step better. Many United participants saw miles go
up in smoke with the report that covered Jan. 1, 1999, when
accumulations from 1995 were wiped out. United said that even these
could be restored if participants took two steps. First, they need
to register at offers.mileageplus.com/mpw049h or by calling (800)
645-4502 and entering promotion code 49. The second step, after
registration, is to take two paid domestic round trips or one paid
international trip before Dec. 31. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As for the future, United said, no post-1995 miles will expire
provided the member registers activity on the account every 36
months: takes a United trip or redeems miles or earns miles through
United partners, and they include resorts, hotels, long-distance
telephone services, car rental companies and all the rest. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Delta, whose miles did not expire provided the member took a
Delta flight every 36 months, joined the parade Aug. 26, saying any
activity at all would preserve miles. ``Buy a house,'' said John
Kennedy, a spokesman. ``Use a co-branded credit card. Make a phone
call.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Asked why the airlines had changed their minds, Randy Petersen,
editor of Inside Flyer, said that more than half of the miles
earned today come from activities other than flying; frequent
buyer, he said, was probably a more accurate description than
frequent flier.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The airlines have to look at these miles as prepaid seats,''
he said. ``And also they have been feeling pressure from their
partners.'' In still another change, American Express announced in
July that Membership Rewards points could now be cashed for cash.
In this step, 20,000 points can be redeemed for $100 up to three
times a year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One peculiar annoyance has emerged, but it may not emerge a lot
further. Feeney, who's sharp-eyed on taxes, noted an extra federal
tax of 36 cents on the charge for a car he rented from Hertz in
Fort Myers, Fla., last year. He wrote to this department about it
in April 1998, saying that the blip represented a pass-along of the
7.5 percent federal tax on Hertz for buying frequent flier miles to
award Feeney and other free-trip devotees. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The federal tax became effective in October 1997. Soon after its
inception, some experts predicted that frequent flier programs
might be taxed to death or abandoned. But nothing of the kind has
happened and the tax, while annoying, is minimal because it is
based on the amount the partner companies, like Hertz, pay the
airlines for the miles and that is pennies a mile. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hertz, according to a spokeswoman, Lauren Garvey, began passing
the tax along to renters right away. Other companies joined later;
some, like Avis, are still swallowing the tax, while keeping an eye
on the situation. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere down the line, if Feeney shifts into an airline
account some of the mileage he is earning from MCI at the rapid
rate of five miles to the dollar, he will again meet the federal
excise tax. MCI Worldcom began passing it along in April 1998.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Claire Hassett, an MCI spokeswoman, said her company bundled
this tax with other federal taxes on the bill, and for three months
has been inserting a notice about it into its bills. Ms. Hassett
also said MCI found the tax distasteful. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The federal tax throws into the spotlight the complex frequent
flier links among hotels, car rental companies, airlines and credit
card companies. As an example, Hertz, the biggest car rental
company, has 11 airline partners: Alaska, American, Continental,
Delta, Hawaiian, Midwest Express, Northwest, Southwest, TWA, United
and US Airways.
</P>
<P>
   These lines, in turn, have partnerships with foreign airlines on
which it may be possible to earn further miles or just take an
awards trip. Hertz, like everyone else, negotiates a price for
miles from each line, possibly 1.5 to 2 cents a mile, although no
one will state the price. It then must award the miles under the
rules set by the airlines.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The rules vary according to whether the renter is a commercial
company or a private person. Although in days gone by Hertz awarded
500 miles per rental, its rate for private people is now generally
two miles to the dollar spent. But American Airlines' agreement
with Hertz holds this to one mile to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   For the Northwest program, Hertz awards 50 miles per rental day.
Except for American and Northwest, the airlines all require that
the car rental be booked in conjunction with a flight on their
lines. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Garvey of Hertz said that since June 1998 the federal
frequentflier tax has been passed along to individual customers at
the rate of 11 cents to every $50 spent on a mileage-earning
rental. That is, a renter earning 100 miles finds an added tax of
11 cents along with the array of other taxes and charges. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dollar Rent-A-Car, according to Emily Gill, a spokeswoman, adds
the 50 cents as a ``frequent flier tax recovery surcharge'' to each
rental involving mileage. Dollar has partnerships with America
West, American, Continental, Delta, Northwest, TWA and United. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   American Express, whose Membership Rewards program is linked to
Continental, Delta, Southwest, TWA and US Airways as well as Virgin
Atlantic, Cathay Pacific and other overseas lines, is not passing
the sales tax along to card holders ``for now,'' although Judy
Tenzer, a spokeswoman, said that the organization was keeping its
eye on the issue. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the new Starwood Preferred Guest program, according to
Hoyt Harper, a spokesman, does not intend to pass the tax along
when points earned at Westins and other hotels in the group are
turned into airline miles. This program is linked to seven domestic
airlines. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Petersen of Inside Flyer said he did not expect any hotel
program to start passing along the tax.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hotels have been very attached to their frequent guest
programs,'' Petersen said, adding that they did not want to
alienate their loyal visitors. Hertz, he pointed out, dropped out
of frequent flier programs at one point, but discovered it was
worth the cost to keep the customers.

</P>
<P>
   Women who travel, whether alone or not, can find a wealth of
travel information here, along with much other advice not related
to taking trips.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, the featured journeys were value vacations (``20
Affordable Trips for Your Family'') and Pacific Rim romances
(``Honeymoon Hot Spots in Tahiti''). Other suggested trips included
Paris, three-day weekends in five United States cities, and cruises
to the Galapagos and Antarctica.
</P>
<P>
   You can search for vacation ideas by region and activity. There
are also the usual resources, like a foreign-currency calculator
and a newsletter, but you can't book rooms or seats.
</P>
<P>
   The site's travel expert, Leslie Martin, answers questions. One
woman asked for suggestions for a place where it would be ``both
fun and safe to travel alone.'' Ms. Martin liked Bali: ``The
Balinese men are gracious and respectful, and because of the
island's popularity with travelers _ especially Australians _
you'll find English speakers just about everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides the travel section, women.com has 19 ``channels,'' from
careers to weddings. &QL;

 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You can't reserve a hotel room or airline seat at the women's
Web site, but there are innumerable other places where you can do
both. If you are a fan of Expedia, Travelocity, Priceline or
whatever, my advice is to stick with it. They change constantly
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   This month, for example, Expedia enhanced its hotel price
matcher. You enter the price you want to pay for the class of hotel
in a city you want to visit and if Expedia can find it, you are
immediately booked.
</P>
<P>
   If you are not committed to such a site, however, two that
specialize in hotel accommodations are hoteldiscount and
usahotelguide. Hoteldiscount lists rooms in 38 cities worldwide _
there were 48 hotels in London alone _ at more than 1,500
properties, at less than list prices, as the name implies. At the
Kensington Hilton in London, a room for two adults was going for
$249.95 a night; a similar room cost $353 a night on Hilton's Web
site.
</P>
<P>
   Usahotelguide adds detailed property and rate information _
including discounts _ for 30,000 hotels and resorts worldwide, and
its site was revised last month to simplify things. Indeed, the
service was as smooth to operate as any travel site I have tried.
You can check for Internet specials, as well as senior citizen,
AAA, and other discounts. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AIR DISCOUNTS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   www.travelzoo.com &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is fairly well known that airlines offer deep discounts at
their Web sites, but it is not well known that they sometimes
withhold these low fares from the standard online booking services.
Travelzoo _ what a name _ searches more than 20 airline sites for
these discounts, and posts them so you don't have to spend hours
searching.
</P>
<P>
   The first time you enter the zoo, you are asked to list your
first name, ZIP code, nearest airport and, optionally, e-mail
address. But you can use the service without going through all
that. There were two New York-London round-trip flights when I
looked, one at $355, the other at $497. &QL;

Jack Rosenthal is editor in chief of The New York Times Magazine.
He has been a vacation pinch-hitter for William Safire since, ah,
the early '80s. 
 By JACK ROSENTHAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The word of the '90s is probably  &UR; millennium &LR; . It has not always
been spelled correctly (n.b. Maidenform's Millenium undergarments).
But the Western world is devoting energetic attention to the event,
about 100 days hence, when three historic zeros click into place.
Meanwhile, a practical problem remains concerning the first word of
the next decade: what to call it.
</P>
<P>
   The '90s can be characterized in many ways _ a decade of
unimaginable American wealth, perhaps, or of Balkan savagery or of
China's steady emergence. But whatever the label, the '90s have a
name, just like the '80s that came before. The decade that comes
after still does not, so here's a formal nomination:  &UR; the '00s &LR; ,
pronounced the Ohs.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The '00s &LR;  is, for one thing, numerically logical. For another,
the rival possibilities fall short.  &UR; The Aughties &LR; , for example, is
how people referred to the first decade of this century. Today,
that clanks quaintly, evoking a world of corsets and hot-water
bottles.  &UR; The Zeroes &LR; ? That's disfigured for older Americans: To
them, it refers to Japanese fighter planes in World War II.  &UR; The
Oh-Ohs &LR; ? Too timid, implying a fearful anticipation of danger
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Ohs &LR; , by contrast, conveys a positive expectation of wonder
and surprise. In that spirit, let me urge its adoption, if not by
acclamation then at least by usage.
</P>
<P>
   The new edition of The New York Times Manual of Style and Usage,
due out next month from Times Books, is silent on the subject.
Allan M. Siegal, The Times' style czar and the manual's co-author,
with William G. Connolly, wishes to wait and see how popular usage
develops. In other words, all who concur in ``the Ohs'' would do
well to vote early and often. The more people there are who start
using the term, the sooner it will win the respect it is, well,
owed.
</P>
<P>
   SOUNDS RIGHT
</P>
<P>
   For most of its life as America's national language, English was
governed by writing. The only way to communicate across distance,
after all, was by books, periodicals or letters. And written
language meant formal language. The people doing the writing were
likely to be educated, perhaps even inclined to flaunt their
education hypercorrectively _ grammarians vs. vulgarians.
</P>
<P>
   So pronounced was this formal dominance of written English that
it endured long after the telephone, radio, talkies and television
spread the spoken word across the land. Many people still recoil
from colloquialisms and contractions that pass comfortably in
speech. The times, however, they are a-changin'. The dominant form
of English is now oral, largely as spoken on TV. And even that's a
moving target.
</P>
<P>
   Not many years ago, the sentences delivered by orotund
newscasters were read from scripts edited by skilled journalists
like Gilbert Millstein, once an editor at The New York Times
Magazine. Indeed, some broadcasters depended so totally on scripts
that they were caricatured by, for instance, the vacuous Ted Baxter
on ``The Mary Tyler Moore Show.''
</P>
<P>
   Television, meanwhile, was changing, in a way that caused the
spoken language to trump writing in another way. ``Now,'' says Tom
Brokaw of NBC, ``there's so much more spontaneity that people don't
write scripts any more. They're encouraged to be good at the `live
pop''' at the scene. And at times like the John F. Kennedy Jr.
plane crash, the TV anchors have to extemporize for hours.
</P>
<P>
   With the profusion of mass media, TV and movies started trumping
the written language in yet another way, as entertainment English
has increasingly overshadowed newscast English. It may have started
with ``Beavis and Butt-head,'' ``The Simpsons'' and ``Seinfeld'' on
television and ``Wayne's World'' and ``Clueless'' on the big
screen. They spread colloquialisms ( &UR; as if &LR; ,  &UR; whatever &LR; ,  &UR; yadda
yadda &LR; ) and vulgarities ( &UR; kick butt &LR; ,  &UR; bastard &LR; ,  &UR; shagged &LR; ) from
locker room to living room.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in the latest turn, informal spoken English has infected
the newest form of writing. Hardly anyone using e-mail bothers with
capital letters or complete sentences, let alone grammar. And why
should anyone? E-mail is not only instantaneous but friction-free;
the faster you can type what's on your mind, the better.
</P>
<P>
   Is there still hope, given such inroads, for maintaining
standards for written English? The New York Times works at it
daily; the forthcoming stylebook testifies to a determination to
preserve rules while avoiding rigidity.
</P>
<P>
   That task is harder than it used to be; there's reason to
believe that written English is not taught as widely or as well as
in the past. Fewer and fewer people understand the difference
between  &UR; like &LR;  and  &UR; as &LR; ,  &UR; which &LR;  and  &UR; that &LR; , let alone when to use
the subjunctive. Preserving rules is no mere stuffy exercise.
Writing freezes thought. Maintaining standards minimizes
misunderstanding. Even something that sounds right can write wrong.
</P>
<P>
   FRIENDLY ANTS
</P>
<P>
   Just how easily verbal misunderstandings can blossom is
demonstrated by what William Safire calls ``mondegreens'' (from the
folk-song lyric ``and laid him on the green,'' once misheard as
``Lady Mondegreen''). My long-time favorite was how a little boy in
Lynn, Mass., when called on to describe the Heimlich maneuver,
spoke of the ``Time-Life remover.''
</P>
<P>
   By now, mondegreens have so proliferated that they have been
collected on a Web site (kissthisguy.com). At last count, there
were 1,783, including patriotic gems like ``Oh beautiful for
spaceship guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Someone listening to ``Michael, row the boat ashore'' thought
the singer was saying, ``My goat knows the bowling score.'' To
someone else, the folk lyric ``Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme''
said, ``Parsnips say Rosemary is blind.'' More than one contributor
told of hearing Bob Dylan sing about the answer blowing in the
wind, but thought he was declaring, perhaps a bit oddly, that ``the
ants are my friends.''
</P>
<P>
   The Web site, overwhelmed, is now temporarily closed to new
submissions, but here's one for the reopening, drawn from Marlene
Dietrich's unforgettable, slightly slurred rendering of ``Falling
in Love Again,'' in which she reports that ``men cluster to me like
moths around a flame.'' It's even more memorable when heard as
``... matzoh balls in flame.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all mishearings are so dramatic, but neither can all
misunderstandings be laughed off so easily.

UAW CLOSER TO ACCEPTING CONTRACTS WITH 2 AUTOMAKERS 
</HEADLINE>
 (ms) 
 By ROBYN MEREDITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ With the auto industry fat and happy, and both labor
and management eager to keep it that way, the United Automobile
Workers union has moved closer to agreeing to new labor contracts
with both DaimlerChrysler and the General Motors Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The auto industry's three-year labor contracts covering nearly
400,000 factory workers expire at midnight Tuesday, and with that
deadline fast approaching, talks between the union and the two
companies continued through the weekend and Monday. If no deal is
reached Tuesday, the union is likely to extend the talks rather
than call a strike, labor experts said.
</P>
<P>
   Barring a last-minute snag, a deal is expected first at
DaimlerChrysler, which is further along in bargaining with the
union. Once the union reaches a deal with one automaker, it is
expected to follow its custom of pressuring the other two
automakers to accept the same terms. The deal is expected to
include hefty wage gains for workers, labor experts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't seen significant wage gains since the mid-1970s,''
said David L. Gregory, a labor law professor at St. John's
University School of Law in New York. He expects raises of perhaps
4 percent for each year of the contract. ``The companies can well
afford it,'' he said, given their recent record profits.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, unions might accept lower raises in exchange for
increases in other benefits, like beefed-up pension packages,
additional time off, or better job security.
</P>
<P>
   The auto industry is racking up record sales this year, on track
to eclipse a mark set in 1986 of sales of 16.03 million vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   The German automaker is viewed as the front-runner because
Stephen P. Yokich, the union's president, attended negotiations at
the company's American headquarters in suburban Detroit this
weekend and Monday, along with his key lieutenants. If a deal were
reached first at DaimlerChrysler, ratification could take as few as
10 days, with the union then trying to reach a similar agreement
with General Motors.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for GM, Ford and DaimlerChrysler all said talks
continued Monday, but refused to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   The union has been conducting simultaneous negotiations with
DaimlerChrysler and with GM for more than a week. Talks continued
at the Ford Motor Co., but at a more leisurely pace: There were no
talks at Ford this weekend or last weekend, while talks were held
then at GM and DaimlerChrysler.
</P>
<P>
   That is a turnabout for GM and for Ford. GM has traditionally
had the most contentious relationship with the union, but has
sought to mend fences since a strike last year cost it $2 billion.
Ford has had particularly smooth labor relations for the past
decade, and has reached a deal first with the union in the past two
sets of talks. But this year, tension arose because of Ford's
ongoing attempts to sell its Visteon auto parts unit. Ford auto
parts workers worry that a separate company might someday try to
pay lower wages.
</P>
<P>
   In Canada, however, the Canadian Auto Workers union chose Ford
as its ``target'' company, and plans to try to reach a deal first
with Ford, then force GM and DaimlerChrysler to agree to those
terms. Labor contracts in Canada expire Sept. 21.

 &HT;    NEWLY RELEASED WACO DOCUMENTS MAY INDICATE COVERUP
 &HT;    BY REBECCA CARR AND JENA HEATH
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ New documents released Monday show that the Justice
Department admitted four years ago that federal agents used
flammable devices in the fiery 1993 siege of the Branch Davidian
compound near Waco, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   That revelation from the ranking Democrat on the House
Government Reform Committee is seen as important because top
congressional Republicans have accused Attorney General Janet Reno
of ``covering up'' the use of combustible tear gas canisters during
the raid and they have demanded her resignation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was a cover-up about what was in these documents, you
could say that the Congress was covering up these documents just as
much as the attorney general was covering up the documents,'' said
Rep. Henry Waxman (D-Calif.), whose staff found the documents
during a search of the committee archives last Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   But even as Democrats attempted to gain ground with those
documents, new evidence released by the Texas Rangers indicates
there will be more questions coming about the 51-day raid that left
80 people dead, some two dozen of them children.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Rangers released a 13-page report to Congress stating
that more than a dozen spent rifle cartridges of a type used by
professional snipers were recovered from a house used by both the
FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms during the
raid.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI has denied firing shots from the house. ATF has admitted
shooting from the house during its initial gun battle with Branch
Davidian Leader David Koresh and his followers.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the shell casings came from ATF agents or FBI agents,
``We don't know,'' an ATF spokesperson said.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Rangers report stated that a dozen .308-caliber
casings, two dozen Israeli manufactured .223-caliber casings, and
one 22.250 casing were recovered at the house used by the FBI's
hostage rescue team during the stand off.
</P>
<P>
   Calls to the Justice Department were not returned.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to both developments, Republicans hotly disputed
Waxman's characterization of a ``cover-up'' and they vowed a
vigorous investigation of Texas Rangers' report.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfortunate that Henry Waxman chose partisan attacks over
a serious attempt to get at the facts,'' said Mark Corallo,
spokesperson for Rep. Dan Burton (R-Ind.), chairman of the
committee, referring to Waxman's documents.
</P>
<P>
   Burton was not the chairman when the Justice Department turned
over evidence to Congress some three days before the 1995
Government Reform hearings into the raid, Corallo said. It would be
understandable to overlook the five examples of using incendiary
devices amidst the 100,000 pages turned over to the committee, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing more outlandish than Mr. Waxman's assertion
that the Government Reform Committee somehow covered up evidence is
the fact his accusations are given any credence by the media,''
said Rep. Bob Barr (R-Ga.), a member of the committee.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI has admitted launching combustible tear gas canisters
into a concrete bunker near the compound last month, but the agency
still maintains that it did not ignite the deadly fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Mr. Waxman is looking for anyone to blame for an incomplete
investigation in 1995, he need go no further than his own
colleagues who obstructed the process in the first place,'' Barr
said.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Texas Rangers discovery, Republicans said that it
would be a top priority in their investigation. The finding has
also been turned over to former Sen. John Danforth (R-Mo.) who is
leading an independent inquiry into the FBI's role in the deadly
fire at the compound.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Rangers report also found that sound and flash cells,
often used to create diversions in hostage rescues, were used the
final day of the siege. But they may not have been altered to
ensure they started a fire, as some critics of the government have
alleged.

Y2K? O'HARE WANTS TO FORGET 1999  

</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By PAM BELLUCK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ It has direct flights to everywhere from Tokyo to
Fargo, and its amenities include automated antiseptic toilet seats,
but O'Hare International Airport here has not had a very good year.
</P>
<P>
   Extraordinary flight delays have plagued O'Hare for months now,
and passengers are understandably disgruntled. The Federal Aviation
Administration reported recently that in the first five months of
1999, 23,141 O'Hare flights were delayed or canceled, nearly double
the 11,646 flights during the same period in 1998. Passenger
complaints against airlines have nearly doubled, too _to 6,582 this
year, from 3,681 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The situation got so bad that in mid-August, the two airlines
that run the most flights out of O'Hare decided they needed to take
steps to pacify customers.
</P>
<P>
   United Airlines, which is based in Chicago and accounts for 40
percent of O'Hare's air traffic, sent letters of apology to the
970,000 members of its Mileage Plus Premiere program _ coupled with
a bonus of 2,500 frequent flier miles. In the first six months of
1999, United had to cancel or delay 4,677 flights at O'Hare because
of weather and air traffic control problems.
</P>
<P>
   American Airlines, which canceled or delayed 2,645 flights in
the first six months of the year, has sent mea culpa letters to its
frequent fliers on those flights. American's planes make up about a
third of the flights at O'Hare, which is the only airport in the
country that is a hub for two major airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Airports across the country have been saddled with delays, due
in part to weather, the installation of new air traffic control
equipment and record numbers of passengers _ 614 million in 1998,
up from 275 million when deregulation began 20 years earlier. But
the problems at O'Hare, the world's busiest airport when measured
by takeoffs and landings, have been worse than those at other major
airports.
</P>
<P>
   FAA statistics show that O'Hare's records for on-time arrivals
and departures during the first six months of this year were either
the worst or the second worst (behind either Boston or Newark) of
the nation's 29 biggest airports.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1988, O'Hare had the moniker of being the airport with the
most delays in the country,'' Mary Rose Loney, Chicago's aviation
commissioner, said. ``Over 10 years, we achieved a 40 percent
reduction in delays. We've worked hard to be that efficient, only
to see that erode in 1999.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Loney has been so troubled by the situation that in early
August she wrote to Jane Garvey, the FAA administrator.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is alarming that Chicago is experiencing a perplexing
amount of air traffic delay during the first half of 1999, beyond
those attributable to thunderstorms and this past winter's snow
events,'' Ms. Loney wrote. ``Some delays are related to the process
of replacing older radar systems with new air traffic control
equipment. But peak-hour flight schedules have not changed to a
degree that might warrant such an increase in delays.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Loney said in an interview that airline officials had told
her that part of the problem was a result of local air traffic
controllers, apparently uncomfortable with new equipment,
instructing planes to fly farther apart than the minimum required
distance _ 5.68 miles at altitudes above 18,000 feet. Other
preventable delays might have been due to the F.A.A.'s holding
planes on the ground longer than necessary, she said _ well beyond
the duration of a thunderstorm, for example.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA did not respond directly to Ms. Loney's letter, but some
of her concerns may be allayed by changes that the FAA announced on
Aug. 12, which would affect airports nationwide. They include
examining and trying to minimize the number and duration of
``ground stops'' (when planes are held on the ground) and trying to
limit orders for extra flying space between planes.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA also said it would seek more consistency in decision
making by centralizing air traffic control authority in its
national command center in Herndon, Va., instead of allowing local
air traffic control centers to act independently.
</P>
<P>
   In the long term, the FAA also plans to install new software to
modernize air traffic control systems in Chicago and elsewhere,
said an agency spokesman, Eliot Brenner.
</P>
<P>
   The delays have fueled the longstanding arguments by some state
officials and members of Congress that Chicago build a third
airport (Chicago's second airport, Midway, which is smaller and
situated south of downtown, had 1,195 flights delayed in the first
five months of 1999, compared with 499 for the same period in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But city officials oppose a third airport, partly because so
many passengers who fly into Chicago would need to make connections
out of O'Hare anyway, and because the increase in delays, Ms. Loney
said, was not caused by lack of runways or airport capacity.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, travelers might be smart to book flights that
arrive or depart before noon or after 11 p.m., the hours with the
fewest delays, FAA statistics show. Passengers flying between 5
p.m. and 11 p.m. are the most likely to be kept waiting.

   The Champs-Elysees as Sculpture Garden
</P>
<P>
   The Champs-Elysees is the backdrop for monumental sculptures by
50 contemporary artists through Nov. 14. Artists from five
continents are participating in the second edition of Les Champs de
la Sculpture, a free event showcasing work created since 1970 and
serving as an international fin de siecle follow-up to a 1996
exhibition of European art on the Champs-Elysees.
</P>
<P>
   The French artist Daniel Buren is creating the show's largest
work: a giant rainbow of flags extending from the Place de la
Concorde to the Arc de Triomphe. Palestinian and Israeli flags are
draped over an olive tree in ``Sukat Shalom'' (``Peace Cabin''),
designed by the Tel Aviv-based artist Dani Karavan. Wind generated
by rushing traffic helps levitate a silver Kevlar sphere in a
fountain created by Manolis Maridakis of Greece.
</P>
<P>
   Images run the gamut from tribal to techno. Sokari Douglas Camp
of Nigeria draws on traditional Yoruba costume for her mixed-media
``Sword Fish Masquerade.'' Nam June Paik, the Korean-born artist,
features 12 blaring television sets in an installation that he
describes as a counterattack against the televised image.
</P>
<P>
   Others include Cuba's Kcho, one of the stars of the recent
Venice Biennale, whose ``Columnar Infinida'' stacks a series of
flat-bottom Loire boats atop each other, and the Americans George
Segal, Jessica Stockholder and Red Grooms, who is sending an
aluminum and enamel ``Hot Dog Vendor'' to the Paris show.
</P>
<P>
   New Baby Seats on British Airways
</P>
<P>
   British Airways offers bulkhead infant seats for children
younger than 2 who are too active for the line's bulkhead cots.
Twelve of these seats can be used on each Boeing 747 long-distance
flight; they are available in economy class by reservation. There
is no charge beyond the regular trans-Atlantic fare for children
under 2, which is 10 percent of the applicable fare.
</P>
<P>
   These seats, manufactured by Britax, allow infants to see their
parents. The seats can be adjusted from horizontal to upright; in
the cots, the infants lie flat.
</P>
<P>
   The airline's director of marketing, Martin George, said that
passengers had asked for some way to hold larger infants other than
on a parent's knees for a whole flight, without having to pay a
full child's ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Children still must be held on laps for takeoff and landing.
Parents who wish children under 2 to be restrained in a true safety
belt for takeoff and landing, as safety experts recommend, must buy
the child a ticket and take along a seat approved by the government
for use in an airplane. On British Airways, such a ticket costs 75
percent of the adult's economy-class ticket or 50 percent of a
business- or first-class ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Four Seasons Opens First Mexican Resort
</P>
<P>
   Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts is in the midst of a growth
spurt. On Sept. 1, the company opened a resort in Punta Mita,
Mexico, the second of six openings of new or renovated hotels
scheduled for this year. It opened the Four Seasons Hotel Las Vegas
in March and plans by the end of the year to unveil a renovation of
the George V in Paris, and new properties in Cairo, Egypt;
Scottsdale, Ariz.; and London
</P>
<P>
   The Punta Mita resort, the company's first in Mexico, has opened
with 100 rooms overlooking the Pacific about 30 miles northwest of
Puerto Vallarta; 40 more are to open next year. It includes a golf
course designed by Jack Nicklaus that has an unusual optional third
hole with an island green 194 yards into the Pacific. The green is
reached by a stone path at low tide and by six-wheel amphibious
vehicle at other times.
</P>
<P>
   Guest rooms and suites are in 13 Mexican-style casitas, with
ocean views from balconies or terraces. There is a beach, pool,
fitness center and spa, and four lighted tennis courts.
</P>
<P>
   Standard rates are $350 to $475 a room, double occupancy, and
$500 to $2,200 for suites, plus 17 percent tax. An introductory
package is $275 a night, double occupancy, for three nights, with a
fourth night free, until Dec. 17. For reservations, call (800)
332-3442. Greens fees are $125 for guests and $180 for others with
a letter to Sam Logan, the golf director, on club letterhead
attesting to membership in a golf club.
</P>
<P>
   A Museum That Is at Home on the Range
</P>
<P>
   The image of the cowboy evokes that unruly and romanticized time
when westward expansion offered the promise of fortune, and danger
at every turn. The National Cowboy Hall of Fame and Western
Heritage Center in Oklahoma City has declared this the year of the
cowboy, since the museum has opened three new permanent exhibitions
about cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   Prosperity Junction, the first of the new exhibitions that
visitors encounter, is a 13,500-square-foot re-creation of a
19th-century cattle town at dusk. It is an attempt to capture the
mood and structure of pioneer life with a livery stable, saddle
shop, train depot, cattle company, photography studio, bank,
marshal's office, saloon, school house and church.
</P>
<P>
   Next is the American Cowboy Gallery, focusing on the people who
worked the ranges and the ranches. The gallery showcases the tools
(cattle brands, saddles, spurs), clothing, techniques and
traditions of ranching culture and tells the story of some of the
best-known cattle trails and ranches. The gallery explores the
diversity of cowboy culture, looking at vaqueros, women,
African-Americans and Indians.
</P>
<P>
   In the last of the new exhibitions, the American Rodeo Gallery,
patrons can sit in bleacher seats to watch vintage rodeo footage
and listen to a brief history of the sport. Kiosks display
biographies of all Rodeo Hall of Fame members and presentations on
women in rodeo, rodeo clowns and the sport's various events. A
trophy room houses some of rodeo's most coveted awards.
</P>
<P>
   The National Cowboy Hall of Fame is open daily. Admission is
$8.50, $7 for those over 62, $4 for children 6 to 12 and free for
those under 6. Information: (405) 478-2250.

BELL ATLANTIC, VODAFONE NEAR DEAL, ANALYSTS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Eight months ago, Bell Atlantic Mobile and British wireless
telephone giant Vodafone Group PLC were slugging it out in a $50
billion-plus bidding war for AirTouch Communications, the big
Western US cellular phone carrier.
</P>
<P>
   Now the two former combatants are apparently closing in on the
deal many industry analysts think they should have done in the
first place: Give Bell Atlantic control of AirTouch's US operations
to help the New Jersey-based carrier become a coast-to-coast
competitor with AT&AMP;T and Sprint PCS.
</P>
<P>
   Such a move, along with Bell Atlantic's pending merger with GTE
Corp., would quickly turn Bell Atlantic into what by many accounts
would be the number one US wireless carrier, with well over 20
million subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   It would also allow Vodafone, Britain's number one carrier, to
focus better on the European AirTouch operations it chiefly was
seeking when it beat out Bell Atlantic with a $56 billion offer for
AirTouch in January.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as Tuesday, the Bell and Vodafone boards are expected to
ratify a deal under which they will put their US wireless
operations into a new joint venture controlled 55 percent by Bell,
45 percent by Vodafone, with no cash changing hands. The new
venture could be worth $80 billion or more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even when these two organizations seemed to be at each other's
throats, given the market forces involved, they absolutely had to
get together,'' Andrew Cole, head of the global wireless group at
consultants Renaissance Worldwide, said Monday. ``There's really
just no way they could not do this deal.''
</P>
<P>
   In New York Stock Exchange trading, AirTouch's American
depositary receipts rose 10 3/4 to 205 9/16, while Bell Atlantic
shares rose 1 3/4 to 64 1/4.
</P>
<P>
   Because AirTouch and GTE overlap in some key California, Texas,
and other Western markets, antitrust regulators would probably
require the new Bell-Vodafone AirTouch venture to sell a half-dozen
or more big-city franchises.
</P>
<P>
   As the number of US wireless subscribers climbs over 70 million
and calling costs continue to drop, regional companies like Bell
Atlantic are under intense pressure to expand and keep up with big
national brands that can offer subscribers coast-to-coast calling
without exorbitant roaming fees.
</P>
<P>
   Wireless companies are moving quickly towards offering ``all you
can eat'' monthly calling plans with a flat rate for 200 to 600
minutes of calls. Companies like Bell Atlantic that have to make
coverage deals with partners elsewhere in the country _ and absorb
roaming fees _ are at a severe competitive disadvantage compared to
AT&AMP;T, Sprint PCS, and Nextel, which also has a national network but
features phones with two-way radio features that primarily serve a
business and tradesman market.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a race on to control customers and a race to control
costs,'' Cole said.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta-based telecommunications analyst Jeffrey Kagan said that
for Bell Atlantic and Vodafone ``it's in both of their strategic
interests to put their egos aside and do a deal so they can both
have a national footprint.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic and AirTouch are ideal candidates for a
combination because their coverage areas _ Bell in the East,
AirTouch in the Midwest and West _ fit almost as cleanly as two
puzzle pieces. AirTouch chairman Sam Ginn observed earlier this
year that he hoped to negotiate some deal with Bell because ``our
assets fit so naturally together.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, Bell Atlantic confirmed it was talking to
Vodafone about ``a US business relationship'' but cautioned that
there is no deadline and ``no assurance that any transaction will
result.''
</P>
<P>
   Cole said the Bell-AirTouch talks are part of a trend that will
likely lead to four to six ``super-wireless carriers,'' all
covering the United States. At least one is expected to be
controlled by MCI WorldCom, which has lagged AT&AMP;T and Sprint in
moving into wireless calling. ``We're not even halfway done with
the consolidation we're going to see,'' Cole said.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts at the Yankee Group in Boston recently projected that
US wireless phone use will quadruple between now and 2004, rising
from 105 billion minutes in 1998 to 554 billion by 2004 (the
equivalent of 80 million people each making 2 1/4 hours of wireless
calls every week). Growth in faster wireless connections to the
Internet will play a huge role driving up usage, analysts predict.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent report to investors, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &AMP;
Co. said Vodafone AirTouch chief executive Chris Gent had told
analysts on Sept. 3 that the current talks with Bell Atlantic had a
25 to 30 percent chance of succeeding, Bloomberg Business News
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Morgan report said Gent added that if talks failed, Vodafone
AirTouch would consider making a run at Omnipoint, which serves
eastern Massachusetts, New York, and Philadelphia, the Morgan
report said.
</P>
<P>
   Vodafone has interests in 12 other international cellular
networks, including France, Greece, Holland, Malta, and Sweden, and
operations in Australia, New Zealand, Egypt, and Fiji.
</P>
<P>
   After their bitter battle for AirTouch, Bell Atlantic Mobile and
Vodafone had remained partners in a US wireless operation called
PrimeCo Personal Communications LP, which they broke up last month.
It has 1.3 million customers.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic took five major Southern wireless franchises from
the deal, including Miami and New Orleans, to bolster its East
Coast dominance. Vodafone AirTouch took properties in Texas,
Chicago, and Milwaukee, leaving it with no Eastern US presence.

<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ With reports of killings and forced
deportations continuing to emerge from East Timor on Monday,
President B.J. Habibie of Indonesia agreed to the creation of an
international commission to investigate possible atrocities there,
the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mary Robinson, said.
</P>
<P>
   After meeting with him Monday, Robinson said Habibie had
accepted her proposal for Indonesian and foreign officials to join
in ``a commission of inquiry, a commission of experts to look at
the evidence of human rights violations.''
</P>
<P>
   This concession to concerns about Indonesian abuses came the day
after Habibie bowed to international pressure and agreed to the
deployment of a U.N. peacekeeping force in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   A nationalist backlash has begun to grow here already, which
could complicate the deployment of the peacekeeping force and, if
it intensifies, weaken Habibie's hold on power.
</P>
<P>
   An inquiry into human rights abuses could lead to the creation
of a war crimes tribunal similar to those investigating abuses in
Rwanda and the Balkans, Robinson said. ``It may be, in due course,
the question of a tribunal,'' she said. ``I have heard many
accounts that name names.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan hinted at the
possibility of war crimes trials for East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   In a blow to Indonesia's national pride, East Timor, a former
Portuguese colony, chose overwhelmingly two weeks ago to become
independent of the nation that has occupied it since 1975 at the
cost of some 200,000 lives. The referendum was organized by the
United Nations, fueling conspiracy theories here about the
intention of foreigners to break Indonesia apart.
</P>
<P>
   Since the results of the vote were announced, irregular militias
backed by the military have reportedly killed hundreds or even
thousands of people and have caused as many as 300,000 people from
the territory of 800,000 people to flee their homes.
</P>
<P>
   No amount of foreign pressure seems to have slowed the rampage
of the militias, and with the killings reportedly continuing, and
with tens of thousands of refugees facing starvation in the barren
hills, where many are hiding, concerns grew here over possible
delays in deploying the force.
</P>
<P>
   In this interim period, aid workers and diplomats said, the
militias could carry out a final cleansing of their enemies and
huge numbers of people could begin to starve.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are hundreds of thousands of refugees in various parts
of East Timor clustered in mountains without adequate food or with
no food at all, living on roots, living on whatever they can
scavenge'' a U.N. spokesman, David Wimhurst, said in Darwin,
Australia.
</P>
<P>
   In the streets of East Timor's capital, Dili, witnesses said
scavengers were picking through the ruins of burned and vandalized
buildings in search of food, water and other supplies.
</P>
<P>
   In a message from a remote stronghold of guerrillas who support
independence, a senior commander, Tuar Matan Ruak, sent a message
pleading for aid for refugees who have gathered there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have milk for the children _ this is a serious
problem,'' he said. ``In the small villages, the fires are the same
as Dili or even worse _ total chaos. The population has no help, no
protection, no food, no water and no medical supplies.''
</P>
<P>
   In agreeing to the international force on Sunday, Habibie said:
``We cannot wait any longer. We have to stop the suffering and
mourning now.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense Minister John Moore of Australia, which is leading the
planned force, said it's members could begin arriving within three
to five days of approval in New York.
</P>
<P>
   But both Indonesian officials and street protesters here,
seeking a voice in this extraordinary compromise of national
sovereignty, have begun demanding that several key nations be
excluded because they are seen to have pushed Indonesia too hard on
the issue of East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The armed forces will simply not accept the involvement of
Australian forces because there have been clashes of opinion
between some groups in the two countries,'' said the military's
chief spokesman, Brig. Gen. Sudradjat, speaking on television.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Such opposition could seriously compromise plans for the
peacekeeping force, which is expected to consist largely of
Australian troops and which is already being put into place in
Darwin, Australia, just 250 miles from East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   Though Indonesia's compliant parliament formally endorsed the
deployment Monday, a number of its members spoke out against what
they called interference or bullying by foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   As demonstrators in Jakarta and the country's second city,
Surabaya, staged the latest in a series of protests against
Australia and the United States, a parliamentary defense commission
said it objected to including those nations as well as New Zealand
and Portugal, the former colonial power in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The presence of these countries could lead to new disorders
because it has been clear they are not neutral,'' said the
commission chairwoman, Aisyah Amini. ``We have to reject them.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The influential daily newspaper Kompas joined the nationalist
backlash. It noted Monday that some of these same Western
governments had supported Indonesia's invasion of East Timor in
1975, one year after it was set free by Portugal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The international reaction to East Timor's problems has
whipped away the mask of Western governments,'' it wrote.
``Previously they supported invasion; now they threaten us.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   One diplomat said he could sympathize with the sense of national
hurt. Indonesians have been far less well-informed than the outside
world, both now and over the years, about military abuses in East
Timor.
</P>
<P>
   Most here do not share the outside outrage over the violence and
many are bewildered at the intense pressure that has been put on
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a huge loss of face here,'' the diplomat said. ``It is
an extraordinary thing for any nation to accept.'' He noted that
previous U.N. peacekeeping forces had been deployed in countries
that had broken down completely, such as Lebanon, Somalia, Haiti,
Rwanda and Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't think of another real country that peacekeepers have
been sent to,'' he said. ``The world really leaned on this place.
There's got to be a backlash to that.''

MANAGER NEEDS TO IMPROVE HIS WORK

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Question: We are employed at a midsize retail
chain. We have a manager on site, and we are subjected to biweekly
reviews by an area manager. We are a high-performing team and we
always meet our goals. When the area manager visits, he sails in,
rarely says hello, reviews invoices and such, and focuses on
finding something wrong. The atmosphere is depressed and defensive
when he's around. What do you call this form of management and how
can we react in a more positive tone to his visits? K.C.
</P>
<P>
   A: This form of management is called mismanagement. It can
easily be found when an area manager rushes through a store, buries
himself in paperwork, eagerly looks for mistakes, and totally
ignores the staff. He may be an area manager, but his behaviors are
not near the area of management.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of your concerns about how to react in a more positive
tone to his visits, the real issue is for him to demonstrate a more
positive tone in these visits. You should discuss your concerns
with your manager, and perhaps he or she could review the situation
with the area manager.
</P>
<P>
   You can also ask your manager if you could meet with your area
manager yourselves. If he or she approves, the next time the area
manager sails into your store and ignores you, several of you
should say hello and tell him that you would like to meet with him.
In such a meeting, let him know how proud you are of your store,
and show him how the store and the numbers will look even better if
he were to provide more opportunities for two-way communication.
</P>
<P>
   Q: There is a support staff member who is supposed to provide me
with assistance as needed. She is very wealthy and is working to
alleviate her boredom. She is disliked by most of the staff. She is
uncooperative, discourteous, ignores me, shows anger toward me,
refuses assignments, and performs personal items at work. She has
been ``sat down'' with management, but to little avail. The general
manager values her because she collects rent from tenants with some
success. What can I do to better the situation? M.K.
</P>
<P>
   A: Although this person's behavior clearly registers in the
extreme range on the scale of outrageous antics, there are at least
two compelling reasons why she is not going to change or be
changed: the first is her personality, and the second is the
support she is receiving from the general manager.
</P>
<P>
   Management can go ahead and have ``sit-down'' sessions with her,
but it is apparent that there is not much going on beyond the
sitting. It is unfortunate that the general manager does not
realize that although this employee successfully collects rent,
this employee is also successfully collecting significant levels of
dissatisfaction, distress and resentment.
</P>
<P>
   For this situation to work, management should either remove her
support staff responsibilities and have her focus solely on the
collection of rents, or give her some real job counseling. Either
way, you should request a different support staff member,
preferably someone who is working for reasons other than the
alleviation of boredom.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We are in the process of hiring several new managers. One of
the people who is conducting interviews recently said at a meeting
that he can tell in a minute if a person has what it takes to be a
manager. Several of us told him about the problems and risks that
accompany his thinking and he agreed to keep an open mind. Is there
anything else we should be doing in this situation? M.V.
</P>
<P>
   A: With this type of ``one minute manager,'' the best step is to
take a few extra minutes not only to advise him of the problems and
risks of his approach, but also to give him some guidance regarding
the most effective steps in screening applicants.
</P>
<P>
   Individuals who conduct interviews for your organization should
be following the same interview track. This generally means that
they are asking preplanned job-related questions, competency
questions, and work-sample questions, as the interview moves
job-by-job through the applicant's career.
</P>
<P>
   It is also important for the interviewer to understand that his
view of an applicant can be contaminated by prejudices, biases,
previous experiences, and the like. When this interviewer makes a
snap decision about an applicant, he is likely to let his
expectations influence the way in which he interprets the
applicant's responses. This can easily lead to false positive or
false negative conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it is time for the company to consider some training for
those who are doing the screening. Snap decisions in hiring can
cause all sorts of problems, while a snappy educational program can
prevent them.

MIDEAST TALKS ENTER FINAL, MOST DIFFICULT STAGE

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Israeli and Palestinian negotiators laid out widely
divergent positions Monday on the core issues of their dispute as
they opened the final and most difficult chapter in the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
   At a largely symbolic event at the Erez Crossing between Israel
and Palestinian-controlled Gaza, Israeli Foreign Minister David
Levy and Palestinian negotiator Mahmoud Abbas shook hands after
mapping out their positions on the status of Jerusalem, the fate of
millions of refugees, control of water resources, and other thorny
issues.
</P>
<P>
   The ceremony took place on the anniversary of the 1993 signing
of the so-called ``declaration of principles,'' which got the peace
process underway with a historic handshake in Washington between
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak
Rabin, who was later assassinated.
</P>
<P>
   After a six-year year journey often detoured by violence and
delays, the two sides will now begin to navigate the most profound
and complex aspects of reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech at the border, Levy said, ``We've accomplished a lot
toward mutual reconciliation and cooperation in these years. . . .
Now we are facing the final status talks that are supposed to bring
an end to 100 years of conflict between the two nations.''
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian negotiator Yasser Abed Rabbo said he believed that
with goodwill on both sides, they could ``achieve the impossible''
and meet the goal of striking an agreement by next September. But
Rabbo said the talks would go nowhere if Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud Barak sticks to hard-line positions he took on the issues of
Jerusalem and refugees in the May election campaign that brought
him to victory.
</P>
<P>
   US Middle East envoy Dennis Ross and European Union envoy Miguel
Moratinos attended the ceremony in the dusty patch of land, strung
with barbed wire, that separates Israel from the
Palestinian-controlled areas.
</P>
<P>
   The rekindling of the peace process followed a signing ceremony
last week in which Arafat and Barak agreed upon a modified ``land
for security'' deal that laid out the steps to be taken before
final status talks. The deal was based on an agreement brokered by
President Clinton last year at the Wye River plantation in
Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   Those steps, which include further withdrawal of Israeli troops
from 11 percent of the West Bank, release of Palestinian prisoners,
and permitting Palestinians to travel freely between the West Bank
and Gaza, will be carried out in tandem with the talks on the final
status issues.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal, the two sides agreed to try to resolve the final
status issues by Sept. 13, 2000. Israel and the PLO initially
planned to reach a final deal by May of this year, but the process
largely deadlocked for three years under Barak's predecessor
Benjamin Netanyahu, and the deadline came and went with no
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Although the peace process now seems reinvigorated by the
breakthrough, analysts on both sides are skeptical about the
ability of the Palestinians and Israelis to resolve such powerfully
emotional issues as Jerusalem and the refugees within one year.
</P>
<P>
   The skeptics point out that interim phases of the process have
been mired in deep mistrust and delays, and that there is little
reason to believe the more difficult issues will be any different.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing these doubts, former Israeli Prime Minister Shimon
Peres, who now serves in Barak's Cabinet, said Monday, ``The old
problems need new creative solutions.''

 &HT;    Floyd's direction keeps coastal Georgians on edge
 &HT;    By Jingle Davis
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUNSWICK, Ga._A voluntary evacuation of heavily-populated
barrier islands and low-lying areas east of Ga. 17 could become
mandatory by noon today as Hurricane Floyd showed signs of swinging
closer to coastal Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   A hurricane warning was issued north to Brunswick late Monday
afternoon and a watch was extended as far up the coast as Savannah.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most serious threat to coastal Georgia and the
whole east coast since Hurricane Hugo in 1989,'' said Ed Abel,
chief of Glynn County's emergency management agency. ``We've never
had a Category 5 hurricane hit the east coast and this storm is
just under that.''
</P>
<P>
   Floyd, already a major Category 4 storm with 155 mile an hour
sustained winds and gusts of up to 190 miles an hour, would be
upgraded to a Category 5 storm if its winds increase to 156 miles
an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Both Glynn and Chatham counties called for voluntary evacuations
of the most vulnerable stretches of the coast at 6 p.m. Monday,
including such mainland areas as the south Brunswick peninsula,
which includes a National Register historic district.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the only counties that have barrier islands with a lot
of people on them,'' Abel said.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Padgett, administrative assistant at the Emergency
Operations Center in Chatham County, said officials there are
keeping close track of the storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still hoping it will turn more to the northeast,'' she
said. In the meantime, she said, residents of Tybee Island as well
as those on Wilmington, Skidaway, Isle of Hope and other islands
linked to the mainland by low-lying causeways were being advised to
seek shelter inland.
</P>
<P>
   Coastal officials planned to go to a mandatory evacuation, based
on overnight reports from the National Hurricane Center. In
Savannah, a mandatory evacuation for low-lying areas was to go into
effect at 8 a.m. today and for all of Chatham County by noon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we're supposed to get hurricane-force winds and a
storm surge of 9 to 16 feet above normal tide, because Floyd waited
so long to start turning north,'' Abel said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier projections had the storm tracking farther east away
from coastal Georgia but the 5 p.m. advisory Monday showed a
revised path expected to bring tropical storm-force winds ashore by
2 a.m. Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Schools in Chatham and Glynn counties cancelled classes for
today and Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Cross said shelters were opened to the north in Coffee
County and Dublin last night.
</P>
<P>
   By late afternoon, hundreds of coastal residents were lined up
at gas stations along the coast. The Home Depot in Brunswick sold
out of plywood by mid-afternoon. Grocery store managers said
customers were lining up to buy bottled water, batteries and canned
foods.
</P>
<P>
   Telephone circuits were jammed with calls.
</P>
<P>
   On St. Simons Island, residents_especially those in homes near
the beach_spent the afternoon Monday boarding up windows and moving
outdoor furniture indoors.
</P>
<P>
   Woody Woodside, executive director of the Brunswick-Golden Isles
Chamber of Commerce, said there are still a number of tourists
vacationing on the barrier islands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure they're concerned, as all of us are, and they're
staying in touch with emergency officials,'' Woodside said. ``We've
been fortunate so many times before and we're hoping we'll be lucky
again.''

REFORM PARTY DISRUPTION SEEN IN BUCHANAN CANDIDACY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Patrick J. Buchanan's likely bid to become the
Reform Party presidential nominee could boost the status of Steve
Forbes as the GOP's conservative alternative in the primaries and
take away votes from George W. Bush in a possible general-election
matchup.
</P>
<P>
   But Buchanan's all-but-official decision to leave the Republican
Party could also wreak havoc in his newfound political home,
setting off a fight for the Reform Party's candidacy that could
result in ballot-stuffing and could bankrupt the party, the
incoming chairman warned Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Gargan, who will oversee the Reform Party's nomination
process when he takes over as chairman on Jan. 1, said in an
interview that the organization's rules allow anyone to request a
Reform Party primary ballot, leading some group leaders to worry
about running out of funds in the effort to verify eligible voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoever has the biggest mailing list can clearly stuff the
ballot box,'' Gargan said in an interview. ``My personal concern is
that someone who has either a pocket full of money or a very large
personal following could stuff it. It could really be trouble. We
are leaving ourselves open for mischief.''
</P>
<P>
   The expense of verifying voters is enormous, Gargan said. ``We
will have no way of knowing whether they are in an insane asylum or
in prison or 13 years old,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Russell Verney, the Reform Party's outgoing chairman,
defended the nomination process. Allowing any eligible voter to
participate is ``the most ingenious party-building policy we have
ever come up with,'' Verney said.
</P>
<P>
   Reform Party members do not control the selection of their
nominee. Instead, any registered voter _ including those who have
already voted in a Democratic or Republican primary _ will be
allowed to cast a ballot for a candidate in the party's national
primary next summer. As a result, there is no way of knowing how
committed the nominee will be to the Reform Party's agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan Sunday said he will make a decision next month about
joining the Reform Party, but he left little doubt, saying, ``Our
bags are packed.'' That is welcome news to Forbes, whose economic
message is expected to attract some Buchanan followers.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan's departure, however, would likely be bad news to the
Bush campaign. Buchanan campaigned in 1992 against Bush's father,
then-President Bush and harmed his standing in the primaries. And
Ross Perot, who founded the Reform Party, in the general election
received 19 percent of the vote, which many Bush aides still
believe cost the president his reelection. George W. Bush, the
Texas governor, in recent weeks has urged Buchanan to remain in the
Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   If Buchanan becomes the Reform Party nominee and Bush is the
Republican candidate, Buchanan could take away 10 points or more
from Bush in a general election, according to some polls. Still,
Buchanan does not have a lock on the Reform Party nomination, and
the former Nixon and Reagan aide is seen by some as an interloper
interested more in the party's cash than its platform. The Reform
Party nominee will be entitled to $13 million in federal campaign
funds.
</P>
<P>
   But that money _ and the ready-made apparatus of the Reform
Party _ could attract other candidates, with rumors flying about
everyone from former Connecticut Governor Lowell Weicker to actor
Warren Beatty to New York City developer Donald Trump. Ross Perot,
ran unsuccessfully for president in 1992 and 1996, has not
indicated whether he will seek the Reform Party nomination again in
2000.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura, the top elected official of
the Reform Party, has said Buchanan's emphasis on antiabortion
views and other social issues is not in sync with the party, which
focuses on economic matters. But Buchanan's rejection of free-trade
policies such as the North American Free Trade Agreement is party
gospel.
</P>
<P>
   At Buchanan's campaign headquarters in Manchester, N.H., state
chairman Shelly Yuscinski said the calls Monday were running
24-to-1 in favor of Buchanan seeking the Reform Party nomination.
``Folks are looking at this with some anticipation,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But on the Dan Pierce radio show on Manchester's WGIR-AM, most
callers criticized Buchanan. Pierce, paraphrasing Buchanan's
campaign slogan, said the message was ``Go, Pat, go, and good
riddance. These are folks that perceive him as weakening George
Bush in '92 and Bob Dole in '96 and allowing that fellow, Bill
Clinton, to win the election.''
</P>
<P>
   Pierce said Buchanan's following is much smaller now than in
1996, primarily because of New Hampshire's economic prosperity. The
state has a 2.5 percent unemployment rate, which has considerably
toned down the voter anger that Buchanan tapped in the last
primary.

3COM SPINS OFF PALM COMPUTING INTO SEPARATE COMPANY
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Exploiting the surging demand for calculator-sized computers,
the 3Com Corp. said Monday it would spin off its Palm Computing
subsidiary, maker of the popular Palm Pilot, as a separate company
early next year.
</P>
<P>
   3Com's main business is making complicated gear that routes
digital information from one computer to another. That business has
made 3Com the No. 2 maker of data networking equipment, second only
to Cisco Systems Inc., but it has little in common with selling
consumer-friendly electronic devices that fit in a breast pocket.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to maintain their focus on handheld computing, some
senior Palm executives lobbied Eric A. Benhamou, 3Com's chairman,
for a spin-off as long ago as last year. Benhamou resisted, arguing
that such a move would be premature, but Monday he said the time
had come and Palm would be better off on its own.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to spin off a business that would have critical
mass, that could stand on its own two feet,'' Benhamou said in an
interview Monday. ``The timing for it last year was premature.''
</P>
<P>
   An independent Palm would join Psion PLC of Britain, one of its
competitors, among the thin ranks of publicly traded companies
devoted to handheld computing.
</P>
<P>
   In 3Com's last fiscal year, which ended in May, the Palm
operation generated $569.9 million in revenue, an increase of 116
percent over the pervious year and about 10 percent of 3Com's
overall annual revenue. Four years ago, in September 1995, before
the first Palm Pilot had even been introduced, Palm Computing
agreed to sell itself to the USRobotics Corp. for $44 million.
(3Com agreed to acquire USRobotics, and Palm, for $6.6 billion in
1997.) While 3Com's divisions that sell modems and network cards
for PCs are stagnating, and while the company's core switch
business slogs through unceasing battles against Cisco, Palm has
become the company's star operation.
</P>
<P>
   After Palm is spun out as an independent company next year, it
will be worth billions, analysts said. The growth in Palm's
financial value over the last few years has been matched perhaps
only by the growth in popularity of its products. About 5 million
people use Palm devices, and the company controls perhaps
two-thirds of the worldwide market for handheld computers. Among
the technically literate, Palm Pilots, which cost at least $229 and
which can store hundreds of phone numbers and appointments, have
replaced the Filofax as the de rigueur information accessory.
</P>
<P>
   Palm's success, especially in the United States, has come in the
face of a concerted challenge from the Microsoft Corp.'s Windows CE
operating system for handheld devices. It is one of the few
companies to thrive in direct competition against Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Benhamou's vision for Palm's future is even more grand. Like
others in the high-technology world, he forsees a moment when
mobile, pocket-sized devices capture much of the power and
functionality of desktop computers. In as few as three years,
Benhamou expects, most of Palm's revenue will come not from sales
of Palm Pilots but from licensing deals that allow other companies
to use Palm's operating system and from services including sale of
the use of a national wireless network.
</P>
<P>
   Until Monday, Palm seemed destined to reach for that future as
part of 3Com. Jeff Hawkins and Donna Dubinsky, who developed the
original Palm Pilot, left 3Com last year to form a new company,
Handspring Inc., after failing to persuade Benhamou to split Palm
from 3Com.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentally, perhaps, 3Com's announcement Monday came only a
day before Handspring was scheduled to unveil its first products.
Based on the Palm operating system, Handspring's new device may
cost as little as $150 and include the ability to to be upgraded
with new programs and capabilities using small hardware cartridges,
according to people who have seen the device.
</P>
<P>
   ``My overall reaction is that it's still the right thing for
them to do,'' Ms. Dubinsky said Monday, referring to the Palm
spin-off. ``We proposed it a year ago, and I think it took a little
longer for them to see it At the time, Eric thought Palm was very
strategic to 3com's future. We just felt it was a different
business than the networking business and required its own focus.''
</P>
<P>
   Some investors and analysts appeared to share Ms. Dubinsky's
opinion, but Benhamou spoke sharply in defense of his timing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might have made Donna more happy then, but it might not
have been in concert with our goals to maximize shareholder
value,'' he said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   By way of explanation, Benhamou said an earlier spin-off might
have incurred a significant tax liability, while his plan would
hopefully avoid taxes and special charges.
</P>
<P>
   3Com's acquisition of USRobotics, Palm's parent, was accounted
as a pooling of interests, an accounting method for takeovers that
often allows the acquiring company to avoid charges against its
future earnings. But a company must wait two years after completing
a pooling before selling any of the significant assets it acquired.
Because 3Com acquired USRobotics in 1997, a spin-off of Palm before
this year might have incurred big charges against either Palm or
3Com.
</P>
<P>
   The same issue may complicate the future of 3Com sans Palm. For
at least a year, 3Com has been thought to be a potential
acquisition target itself, despite its difficulties competing
against Cisco. By slimming 3Com's profile and increasing the
company's focus on networking, a spin-off of Palm could make 3Com
even more attractive.
</P>
<P>
   Benhamou declined Monday to discuss any potential takeover
offers but said the spin-off might actually make 3Com less
attractive as a target because it could prevent 3Com from being the
target of an acquisition that uses pooling accounting for two years
after the divestiture is completed.
</P>
<P>
   Under Benhamou's plan, 3Com will sell up to 20 percent of Palm
to the public in an initial stock offering sometime around January.
Up to six months after the offering, the remaining shares in Palm
will be given to existing 3Com shareholders. Benhamou said a chief
executive for Palm could be named within weeks but refused to say
what value the stock offering would place on the new company.

JUSTICE DEPARTMENT DISCLOSED USE OF FLAMMABLE CANISTERS, NEW
DOCUMENTS SHOW 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Calif.)  (js) 
 By DAVID JOHNSTON and NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Internal FBI documents disclosed Monday by a
Democratic lawmaker show that information about the use of
combustible tear-gas canisters used in the FBI assault on the
Branch Davidian compound near Waco, Texas, in 1993 had been in the
Justice Department's files for years and was even sent to Congress
no later than 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The documents cast new light on when different parts of the
government first had knowledge about the use of the flammable tear
gas and therefore may alter the dynamics of the renewed outcry over
events surrounding the FBI assault on the compound on April 19,
1993.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI documents were disclosed by Rep. Henry Waxman, a
California Democrat and member of the House Government Reform
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The documents released Monday show that even though Attorney
General Janet Reno angrily sent U.S. marshals to the FBI's
headquarters two weeks ago to seize infrared videotapes containing
references to the use of combustible tear gas, the Justice
Department had for years possessed FBI records that showed such
devices were used at Waco.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the documents provide evidence that the FBI, which
has been accused of misleading the Justice Department about the
issue by some in Congress and the Clinton administration, did
provide information about the use of flammable rounds to Ms. Reno's
subordinates on several occasions, even though Ms. Reno said that
she had not been aware of the information.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, there is no indication in the documents made public
Monday that FBI officials had clearly explained the implications of
using the flammable rounds to their civilian counterparts at the
Justice Department. Moreover, FBI officials had never said publicly
that their agents had used the rounds until last month, when they
said a ``very limited number'' of such canisters had been fired at
a concrete bunker hours before a deadly fire swept through another
structure on the compound. Investigators later found the bodies of
about 80 people, among them a number of children.
</P>
<P>
   In the documents, references to the canisters do not clearly
state that the rounds were combustible but refer to them as
``military'' rounds. The vast majority of tear gas rounds fired
during the Branch Davidian incident were non-flammable canisters
known as ``ferret'' rounds.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate development, the Texas Rangers released a report
to Congress Monday that said the Rangers, who collected evidence
from the Davidian compound after the tear gas assault, had found
spent cartridges from two different types of sniper rifles. Both
were carried by FBI agents during the 51-day siege.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law enforcement officials said Monday that the shell
casings were collected by FBI agents after they had first arrived
in Texas in March 1993, and that they turned the spent cartridges
over to the Texas Rangers. The long-held position of the FBI was
that agents had not fired a single shot.
</P>
<P>
   Later, officials at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms
said its agents had fired the two types of weapons in question
during an early, ill-fated raid on the compound in February 1993.
But officials said they had never determined whether the shell
casings came from the ATF's weapons.
</P>
<P>
   In the Rangers' report, which had been subpoenaed by the House
Government Reform and Oversight Committee, the Texas law
enforcement agency also released a letter by a federal prosecutor
who had advised Ms. Reno that unidentified Justice Department
officials may have withheld facts from her regarding the FBI's use
of flammable tear-gas canisters.

LOUISIANA PILOT LANDS DISABLED PLANE IN GALVESTON SURF

<P>
   GALVESTON, Texas _ A Louisiana pilot glided his disabled Cessna
182 airplane several miles before crash-landing in calm surf before
noon Monday on Galveston's beachfront.
</P>
<P>
   Adrian Bennett Cairns Jr., 65, of Covington, La., and a
passenger walked away uninjured from the crash, which ended with
the airplane upside down in shallow water, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looked like he was going to the sand, but there were people
there and he moved back over the water,'' said Galveston Beach
Patrol lifeguard Tony Pryor. ``He was in a gradual incline and he
hit the water, and it slowly flipped him over on the top side.''
</P>
<P>
   Cairns, who was identified as the pilot by the Texas Department
of Public Safety, was unavailable for comment late Monday. The DPS
did not have the name of the passenger.
</P>
<P>
   Galveston International Airport interim director Hud Hopkins
said Cairns told him the passenger was his sister and the two were
traveling to Galveston to visit a relative. Hopkins did not have
the sister's name.
</P>
<P>
   Hopkins said Cairns confirmed Pryor's assessment of the landing.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were too many tourists on the beach to make a landing
without injuring anybody; so he put it in over the water a
little,'' Hopkins said. ``As soon as he touched water, he flipped
over. But they were completely fine, other than being shaken up.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``It's pretty incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pryor said he first noticed the airplane as it passed his
lifeguard stand. The plane was silent as it swept down the beach
and landed four blocks away, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he did a real good job of landing it, because he
avoided people, and it looked pretty much under control,'' said
Pryor, the first person to reach the overturned plane. ``By the
time I got there, they were both out and going back in getting
stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were real calm,'' Pryor said, adding that the top of the
cockpit was barely underwater in the surf.
</P>
<P>
   Cairns radioed a ``mayday'' minutes before the crash, according
to one person who monitored radio traffic among pilots in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Cairns told other pilots in the area his engine failed, he was
four or five miles from the Galveston airport and he did not expect
to make it to a runway.
</P>
<P>
   At least three helicopter pilots in the area began looking for
the disabled plane when the emergency call went out and one was
shepherding the aircraft when it hit the beach and rolled over,
witnesses said. The plane was flying parallel to the beachfront,
they said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Federal Aviation Administration investigators were at the crash
scene and were inspecting the airplane in a hanger after it was
hauled off the beach and lifted up over the city's seawall.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said the plane's propeller and nose appeared to have
suffered the most damage from the crash-landing but the aircraft's
fuselage and a wing were broken in half during the salvage
operation.
</P>
<P>
   Hopkins said FAA officials plan to examine the engine this week
to find out why it quit running. The plane belonged to Cairns,
Hopkins said.

 &HT;    Justice did disclose use of pyrotechnic tear gas in '95,
Democrat says
 &HT;    By Rebecca Carr and Jena Heath
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _New documents released Monday show that the Justice
Department admitted four years ago that federal agents had used
flammable devices in the fiery 1993 siege of the Branch Davidian
compound near Waco, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   That revelation from the ranking Democrat on the House
Government Reform Committee is important because top congressional
Republicans have accused Attorney General Janet Reno of ``covering
up'' the use of combustible tear gas canisters during the raid and
they have demanded her resignation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was a cover-up about what was in these documents, you
could say that the Congress was covering up these documents just as
much as the attorney general was covering up the documents,'' said
Rep. Henry Waxman (D-Calif.), whose staff found the documents
during a search of the committee archives last Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But even as Democrats attempted to gain ground with those
documents, new evidence released by the Texas Rangers indicates
there will be more questions coming about the 51-day raid that left
80 people dead, about two dozen of them children.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Rangers released a 13-page report to Congress stating
that more than a dozen spent rifle cartridges of a type used by
professional snipers were recovered from a house used by both the
FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms during the
raid.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI has denied firing shots from the house. ATF has admitted
shooting from the house during its initial gun battle with Branch
Davidian leader David Koresh and his followers.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the shell casings came from ATF agents or FBI agents is
still unclear. The ATF said it did not know whether the shell
casings came from FBI or ATF agents.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Rangers report stated that a dozen .308-caliber
casings, two dozen Israeli-manufactured .223-caliber casings, and
one 22.250 casing were recovered at the house used by the FBI's
hostage rescue team during the stand off.
</P>
<P>
   Calls to the Justice Department were not returned.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to both developments, Republicans hotly disputed
Waxman's characterization of a ``cover-up,'' and they vowed a
vigorous investigation of the Texas Rangers' report.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfortunate that Henry Waxman chose partisan attacks over
a serious attempt to get at the facts,'' said Mark Corallo,
spokesman for Rep. Dan Burton (R-Ind.), chairman of the Government
Reform Committee, referring to Waxman's documents.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to wonder why the attorney general is running around
seeming so distraught and upset that people lied to her ... despite
the fact that a memo has existed at the Justice Department since
1993 that points to the use of these devices,'' Corallo said.
</P>
<P>
   Burton was not chairman when the Justice Department turned over
evidence to Congress three days before the 1995 Government Reform
hearings into the raid, Corallo said. It would be understandable to
overlook the five examples of using incendiary devices amid the
100,000 pages turned over to the committee, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing more outlandish than Mr. Waxman's assertion
that the Government Reform Committee somehow covered up evidence is
the fact his accusations are given any credence by the media,''
said Rep. Bob Barr (R-Ga.), a member of the committee.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI has admitted launching combustible tear gas canisters
into a concrete bunker near the compound last month, but the agency
still maintains that it did not ignite the deadly fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Mr. Waxman is looking for anyone to blame for an incomplete
investigation in 1995, he need go no further than his own
colleagues who obstructed the process in the first place,'' Barr
said.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Texas Rangers discovery, Republicans said that it
would be a top priority in their investigation. The finding also
has been turned over to former Sen. John Danforth (R-Mo.) who is
leading an independent inquiry into the FBI's role in the deadly
fire at the compound.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Rangers report also found that sound and flash cells,
often used to create diversions in hostage rescues, were used on
the final day of the siege.
</P>
<P>
   But they may not have been altered to ensure they started a
fire, as some critics of the government have alleged.

TUMOR-SHRINKING DRUG TO BE TRIED ON HUMANS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn.: Texas, Wis.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- The first human tests of a highly-publicized new
cancer drug, endostatin, are on track to begin in Boston within a
few weeks, despite a report questioning the drug's effectiveness,
say medical and company officials.
</P>
<P>
   The much-anticipated clinical trial of human endostatin, a
substance that shrinks tumors by cutting off their blood supply,
has been slowed somewhat by the need to devise a fair system for
selecting which patients will receive the drug, said an official at
Dana-Farber/Partners Cancer Care. Only patients who cannot be
helped by conventional therapies will be eligible, but it's
expected many will want to enter the initial human tests.
</P>
<P>
   The endostatin that will be given to a small number of patients
in the first tests is being supplied by EntreMed, a Rockville, Md.
company that has licensed the right to develop the drug and is
sponsoring the clinical trial in Boston. Mary Sundeen, a company
spokeswoman, said the endostatin has been thoroughly tested and
continues to show success in shrinking tumors in mice.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Dr. Judah Folkman, in whose laboratory at Children's
Hospital endostatin was discovered, criticized as distorted a news
report Monday saying that scientists at the National Cancer
Institute had failed to document in its own laboratory in
Frederick, Md., the effectiveness of mouse endostatin.
</P>
<P>
   Folkman, in an interview, said he was to have shipped some
endostatin made in his laboratory to the NCI lab for testing there,
but because of previous experiences showing that the drug does not
withstand transportation well, he decided against it.
</P>
<P>
   The NCI scientists have already shown that they could duplicate
Folkman's results when they visited his Boston lab earlier this
year and worked under his supervision. The next step was to attempt
similar results in their own laboratory, but using Folkman's
endostatin.
</P>
<P>
   That step was never taken, both Folkman and Entremed said.
``It's not a case of tried and failed, it's a case of never
tried,'' said Sundeen at EntreMed.
</P>
<P>
   NCI officials could not be reached for comment but Sundeen said
the institute may release a statement Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The report in the Wall Street Journal, which raised questions
about endostatin's ability to fight cancer, failed to say that
scientists in six other laboratories have published reports
documenting the drug's effects in animals, Folkman said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the laboratories reporting success is one at Beth Israel
Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, where Dr. Vikas P. Sukhatme has
been testing endostatin and reported last year that it halted or
shrank kidney tumors in mice.
</P>
<P>
   Folkman said the other labs that have replicated his endostatin
results are in the United States, Italy and Sweden, Endostatin
belongs to a category of drugs, angiogenesis inhibitors, that
selectively attack new blood vessels that grow around and into
tumors and are necessary for the cancers to spread. In mouse
experiments, endostatin has dramatically shrunk mouse tumors into
invisibility and has done so without toxic effects.
</P>
<P>
   Other, less potent angiogenesis inhibitors are in early testing
in human patients, and reports thus far suggest the drugs are
well-tolerated by patients and seem to combat tumors, though there
remains too little evidence to say how valuable they will be.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Boston, sites where endostatin will begin testing
this fall in patients are M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Texas and
at the University of Wisconsin.

REFORM PARTY DISRUPTION SEEN IN BUCHANAN CANDIDACY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Patrick J. Buchanan's likely bid to become the
Reform Party presidential nominee could boost the status of Steve
Forbes as the GOP's conservative alternative in the primaries and
take away votes from George W. Bush in a possible general-election
matchup.
</P>
<P>
   But Buchanan's all-but-official decision to leave the Republican
Party could also wreak havoc in his newfound political home,
setting off a fight for the Reform Party's candidacy that could
result in ballot-stuffing and could bankrupt the party, the
incoming chairman warned Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Gargan, who will oversee the Reform Party's nomination
process when he takes over as chairman on Jan. 1, said in an
interview that the organization's rules allow anyone to request a
Reform Party primary ballot, leading some group leaders to worry
about running out of funds in the effort to verify eligible voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoever has the biggest mailing list can clearly stuff the
ballot box,'' Gargan said in an interview. ``My personal concern is
that someone who has either a pocket full of money or a very large
personal following could stuff it. It could really be trouble. We
are leaving ourselves open for mischief.''
</P>
<P>
   The expense of verifying voters is enormous, Gargan said. ``We
will have no way of knowing whether they are in an insane asylum or
in prison or 13 years old,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Russell Verney, the Reform Party's outgoing chairman,
defended the nomination process. Allowing any eligible voter to
participate is ``the most ingenious party-building policy we have
ever come up with,'' Verney said.
</P>
<P>
   Reform Party members do not control the selection of their
nominee. Instead, any registered voter _ including those who have
already voted in a Democratic or Republican primary _ will be
allowed to cast a ballot for a candidate in the party's national
primary next summer. As a result, there is no way of knowing how
committed the nominee will be to the Reform Party's agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan Sunday said he will make a decision next month about
joining the Reform Party, but he left little doubt, saying, ``Our
bags are packed.'' That is welcome news to Forbes, whose economic
message is expected to attract some Buchanan followers.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan's departure, however, would likely be bad news to the
Bush campaign. Buchanan campaigned in 1992 against Bush's father,
then-President Bush and harmed his standing in the primaries. And
Ross Perot, who founded the Reform Party, in the general election
received 19 percent of the vote, which many Bush aides still
believe cost the president his reelection. George W. Bush, the
Texas governor, in recent weeks has urged Buchanan to remain in the
Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   If Buchanan becomes the Reform Party nominee and Bush is the
Republican candidate, Buchanan could take away 10 points or more
from Bush in a general election, according to some polls. Still,
Buchanan does not have a lock on the Reform Party nomination, and
the former Nixon and Reagan aide is seen by some as an interloper
interested more in the party's cash than its platform. The Reform
Party nominee will be entitled to $13 million in federal campaign
funds.
</P>
<P>
   But that money _ and the ready-made apparatus of the Reform
Party _ could attract other candidates, with rumors flying about
everyone from former Connecticut Governor Lowell Weicker to actor
Warren Beatty to New York City developer Donald Trump. Ross Perot,
ran unsuccessfully for president in 1992 and 1996, has not
indicated whether he will seek the Reform Party nomination again in
2000.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura, the top elected official of
the Reform Party, has said Buchanan's emphasis on antiabortion
views and other social issues is not in sync with the party, which
focuses on economic matters. But Buchanan's rejection of free-trade
policies such as the North American Free Trade Agreement is party
gospel.
</P>
<P>
   At Buchanan's campaign headquarters in Manchester, N.H., state
chairman Shelly Yuscinski said the calls Monday were running
24-to-1 in favor of Buchanan seeking the Reform Party nomination.
``Folks are looking at this with some anticipation,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But on the Dan Pierce radio show on Manchester's WGIR-AM, most
callers criticized Buchanan. Pierce, paraphrasing Buchanan's
campaign slogan, said the message was ``Go, Pat, go, and good
riddance. These are folks that perceive him as weakening George
Bush in '92 and Bob Dole in '96 and allowing that fellow, Bill
Clinton, to win the election.''
</P>
<P>
   Pierce said Buchanan's following is much smaller now than in
1996, primarily because of New Hampshire's economic prosperity. The
state has a 2.5 percent unemployment rate, which has considerably
toned down the voter anger that Buchanan tapped in the last
primary.

MONTINI-COLUMN (Undated) - Of course there's an on-going cover-up
involving the tragedy at Waco, but it has nothing to do with the
FBI or the ATF or pyrotechnic devices or mysterious rifle shell
casings or missing reports. The cause of death for the 80 men,
women and children in the Branch Dividian compound was America's
most efficient and predictable killer _ impatience. Not theirs.
Ours. By E.J. MONTINI. Story will move in the ``A'' and ``K''

 &HT;    COLUMN: Waco raises concern about `warrior' police
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Former Sen. John Danforth last week launched his investigation
into the enormously complicated question of how to ascribe blame in
the 1993 destruction of the Branch Davidian compound near Waco,
Texas, with a distinction subtle enough to stump a philosopher.
</P>
<P>
   It would be his task, Danforth said, to decide whether what
happened constituted ``bad judgment'' or ``bad acts.'' In other
words, he seemed to be saying, did federal agents merely stumble
into the deadly fiasco, or was there some element of premeditation
and subsequent cover-up involved in the government's role in the
tragedy?
</P>
<P>
   Possibly Danforth, a respected, independent figure who brings no
political baggage to the job, can clarify many of the troubling
issues surrounding the Waco case. But it's unlikely any
investigation will ever be able to completely assign responsibility
on the slippery slope between judgment and acts in this case.
</P>
<P>
   As great as the need is to put these nagging questions to rest,
there is an even bigger responsibility to insure that similar
incidents don't happen in the future. A paper released last month
by the Cato Institute, ``Warrior Cops: The Ominous Growth of
Paramilitarism in American Police Departments,'' makes a
provocative argument that current trends in law enforcement are
planting the seeds for another Waco.
</P>
<P>
   The study, written by analyst Diane Cecilia Weber, traces the
way in which the war on drugs over the past couple of decades has
brought not only military equipment but a military mind-set into
the realm of domestic law enforcement. The study pays less
attention to the increasing anxiety over terrorism, but obviously
that is also a factor in this trend.
</P>
<P>
   ``State and local police departments are increasingly accepting
the military as a model for their behavior and outlook,'' Weber
writes. ``The problem is that the mind-set of the soldier is simply
not appropriate for the civilian police officer. Police officers
confront not an `enemy' but individuals who are protected by the
Bill of Rights.''
</P>
<P>
   The blurring of the constitutional distinctions between military
and law enforcement has gone forward at the urging of Congress, the
study points out, and with an escalation of ``martial rhetoric''
within both political parties.
</P>
<P>
   This has not only led to the use of military forces for domestic
law enforcement purposes, as in the 1998 razing of 42 crack houses
by Indiana National Guard engineering units, but the proliferation
of military-style SWAT units in police departments across the
country, many with high-tech equipment supplied by the Department
of Defense.
</P>
<P>
   The latest revelations concerning the Waco case only lend
credence to the alarm raised in the study. On Friday, to cite just
one example, Texas officials successfully blocked a request by the
Austin American-Statesman to release a Texas Department of Public
Safety report on evidence collected at the Davidian compound by the
Texas Rangers, claiming it contained military secrets and would
need to be reviewed by other agencies.
</P>
<P>
   It has been relatively easy for politicians to point fingers
over an incident of such evident ``bad judgment'' as Waco. But it
has been hard to resist the appeal of sweeping measures that seem
to be justified by the societal threats of drugs and terrorism,
even though those measures blur the important distinction that
helps define us as a nation, between defending the country and
insuring the rights of its citizens.

MNISTER FIGHTS FOR RIGHT TO SPANK HIS CHILDREN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SACHA PFEIFFER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- The whippings that Donald R. Cobble Jr. occasionally
administers his young son are, his lawyer argues, ``essentially a
religious ceremony.''
</P>
<P>
   Before and after spanking 12-year-old Judah with a leather belt
_ always on the buttocks, and always when the boy is fully clothed
_ Cobble does two things: He hugs his son, and he tells him that he
loves him.
</P>
<P>
   Often, the Woburn, Mass. minister also reads from the Bible as
he delivers the spankings, so Judah understands ``the religious
nature and spirituality of the discipline.''
</P>
<P>
   To Cobble, the ritual is constitutionally protected, effective
parenting.
</P>
<P>
   To the state Department of Social Services, it verges on child
abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Cobble's method of discipline is protected by his
constitutional right to freedom of religion will be decided by the
Supreme Judicial Court, which Monday heard arguments by lawyers for
both sides.
</P>
<P>
   The high court's decision is anxiously awaited by advocates and
opponents of corporal punishment, who disagree passionately over
whether physical discipline is a parent's protected right, or
whether it is simply sanctioned violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The line between corporal punishment and child abuse is hard
to draw,'' said Mary O'Connell, a professor of family and
children's law at Northeastern University. ``Some parents are
abusers in ways so hideous the human mind can't even cope with it.
In other cases, you see people who don't seem to know the line
between correction and abuse.''
</P>
<P>
   Cobble, an associate pastor at the Christian Teaching and
Worship Center in Woburn, attracted DSS attention in 1997, when his
son, Judah, then 9, told a teacher he feared being spanked by his
father.
</P>
<P>
   The child's remarks triggered a DSS investigation, which led a
social worker to conclude that Cobble had abused his son in the
past and could do so in the future. Eventually, a Superior Court
judge reached the same conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Cobble does not deny that he spanks his son, but says he only
uses the soft end of a belt, and only when Judah's behavior merits
it _ not when his academic performance is poor.
</P>
<P>
   Cobble's spankings left no welts or bruises; instead, according
to what his son told social workers, they left pink marks that
would fade after about 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just speaking to a child is not enough,'' Cobble said. ``Some
need the rod sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Cobble's lawyer, Chester Darling, agrees, and thinks DSS is
flexing its muscles in an area where it has no authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should keep their noses out of these families and their
personal business,'' said Darling. ``The state has no business
telling parents whether they can or can't spank their children.''
</P>
<P>
   DSS agrees that parents have a right to discipline their
children. But it argues that the constitution does not protect
parental discipline that jeopardizes the health or safety of a
child.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, DSS acknowledges that it is not always easy to
distinguish between discipline and abuse. To gauge the severity of
a punishment, a lawyer for the agency argued Monday, factors such
as frequency and force of the punishment, and a child's resulting
pain and fear, must be taken into consideration.
</P>
<P>
   To supporters of corporal punishment, the Cobble case represents
government intrusion into a parent's God-given right to raise his
son the way he sees fit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Physical punishment is not inherently wrong and it's not
illegal,'' said Virginia attorney Jordan Lorence, a First Amendment
specialist who has worked on many parental rights cases, ``but many
government social work agencies are controlled by a philosophy that
says all physical punishment should be illegal.''
</P>
<P>
   But many corporal punishment opponents think that some parents
``lean on'' outdated Scripture to justify what amounts to child
abuse.
</P>
<P>
   For example, noted Nadine Block, director of the Center for
Effective Discipline in Columbus, Ohio, which advocates
alternatives to corporal punishment, Deuteronomy teaches that a son
who disrespects his father should be stoned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do reasonable people really believe we should be stoning
children?'' she said. ``We try to be respectful to people's
beliefs, and yet we feel that our greatest priority is to protect
children.''

COMMENTARY: BILL'S LITTLE GIFT 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By GAIL COLLINS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The idea that Bill Clinton let members of a terrorist group out
of jail for Hillary's sake is an interesting concept. It's the
political equivalent of giving your wife an anniversary gift of an
untrained collie. There are really a lot of things she could use
more.
</P>
<P>
   I'm in the minority on this, but I tend to believe the Clinton
camp's version of how the president came to offer clemency to
members of the Puerto Rican nationalist organization FALN. When the
choice is between a sneaky plot and all-purpose bumbling, in this
White House it's generally safe to go with Door Number Two.
</P>
<P>
   The president's supporters say he signed off on the clemency
request at the recommendation of aides, and that his wife had
nothing to do with it. Puerto Rican politicians, who are currently
in no mood to protect the first lady, support this version. Rep.
Nydia Velazquez, D-N.Y., says the deal was brokered by the
president's outgoing political counsel, Charles Ruff. ``We had a
very emotional meeting with Mr. Ruff,'' Ms. Velazquez said. ``We
cried. It was very moving. We tried to put a human face on these
political prisoners, people who have not been convicted of killing
anyone, who have spent up to 20 years away from their families.''
</P>
<P>
   The prisoners, all convicted of nonviolent crimes, did seem to
have gotten a raw deal in their sentencing _ who gets 90 years in
jail for bank robbery? They had actually already disavowed
violence, and it seems easy to imagine that the White House was
bowing to the thousands of pleas it had received from church groups
and other prominent figures.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for the president, the prisoners turned out to be
less than sympathetic figures for the country at large,
self-righteous and unbending. (You could see how they might have
appealed to Jimmy Carter.) One, Ricardo Jimenez, asked on NBC about
people killed by FALN bombings, basically blamed the proprietors of
the restaurants and taverns that got blown up. ``I think all
precautions were taken, you know, to make sure that all human life
was preserved,'' he said. ``And in the end the measures were not
taken that were necessary by the people who owned those
establishments.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton, who supported her husband at first, bailed out
when the deal came under fire. People like Velazquez were never
consulted. For all the listening the first lady has been doing, she
has apparently not learned that when you are making a decision
involving Puerto Rican sensibilities, you should at least touch
base with Puerto Rican politicians.
</P>
<P>
   But the whole idea of freeing the prisoners was a political
loser for Mrs. Clinton from the start. She's planning to run for
Senate against Rudolph Giuliani, a man who regards law and order as
his own name-brand franchise. New York has tons of different ethnic
groups, at least half of which have members in jail for allegedly
political crimes. If the president was pandering, as his critics
contended, he was pandering to a constituency already pretty safely
in his wife's corner, while making her appear soft on terrorism in
the suburbs and upstate, and alienating all the other ethnic groups
that failed to get their political prisoners sprung. Sure enough,
the Puerto Rican prisoners had not even gotten out of their cells
before Jewish supporters of the Israeli spy Jonathan Pollard were
demanding that Mrs. Clinton get behind his release, too.
</P>
<P>
   The real question may be why there was no one in the White House
protecting Mrs. Clinton's back who could have derailed the clemency
deal early on.
</P>
<P>
   But the administration is supposed to be in the business of
running the country, not electing Hillary senator. Mrs. Clinton has
been trying to have it both ways, basking in the real popularity
the president enjoys in New York and taking credit for his
administration's accomplishments, while distancing herself from the
problems.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons want us to believe that the president never told
Hillary about critical details of the clemency offer that might
have influenced her decision to jump ship. Maybe he didn't. Maybe
for the first time in their married life, they lost interest in
political plotting. The more important point is that Mrs. Clinton's
attempt to have a dual life as candidate and first lady isn't
working. Perhaps it's time for her to choose.

 &HT;    Gingrich, wife agree on split of assets
 &HT;    By Duane D. Stanford
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Newt Gingrich and Marianne Gingrich agreed Monday to
keep their divorce out of a public arena _ for now.
</P>
<P>
   The Gingriches have reached a confidential agreement on how to
divide their income and assets while their legal separation
proceeds, avoiding an open and potentially contentious hearing this
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives them both support to live off of,'' said Randy Evans,
Newt Gingrich's attorney and longtime friend.
</P>
<P>
   An assets hearing scheduled for Thursday before Cobb County
Superior Court Judge Dorothy Robinson is now unnecessary, Evans
said. But by late Monday the judge hadn't canceled what was to be a
first joint appearance in court by the Gingriches.
</P>
<P>
   Marianne Gingrich's attorney, John Mayoue, confirmed that an
agreement was reached, but would give no details.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement is a sign that the Gingriches are willing to
compromise to keep their private lives out of public view.
</P>
<P>
   The Thursday hearing was expected to attract national media,
whose reporting has been stoked by Newt Gingrich's relationship
with a 33-year-old congressional aide, Callista Bisek of Virginia.
By avoiding a hearing, the Gingriches also avoid answering specific
charges they've made against each other since Newt Gingrich filed
for the divorce in July.
</P>
<P>
   Marianne Gingrich filed court papers in August accusing the
former U.S. House speaker of attempting to transfer ``certain
valuable assets'' before filing for divorce. She did not specify
what the assets were, but she asked the judge to force her
estranged husband to return anything he took and stop him from
taking anything else.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was never any truth to that, so there was nothing to
resolve,'' Evans said.
</P>
<P>
   Newt Gingrich, 56, retaliated with his own court filing, saying
his wife of 18 years held all the couple's personal liquid assets
when they separated. He further accused her of depleting ``a
substantial portion'' of those assets.
</P>
<P>
   The former 10-term congressman from Marietta, Ga., also
submitted a 1987 separation agreement that paid Marianne Gingrich
$12,000 in alimony over six months, and divided the couple's bank
accounts, furniture and cars. Newt Gingrich asked the judge to
determine whether the agreement was still technically in effect, or
whether the couple could structure a new separation agreement along
the same lines.
</P>
<P>
   Another Newt Gingrich attorney, Thomas Browning, said the
Gingriches had maintained separate residences for six years before
reconciling about late 1993. That news took Washington insiders and
Gingrich supporters at home by surprise. Marianne Gingrich, 48, has
admitted in the past that there was a separation years ago but has
declined to say how long it lasted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed that Newt Gingrich has chosen such a hurtful
strategy,'' said Mayoue, Marianne Gingrich's attorney, before
Monday's agreement, ``especially considering his very public
conduct that's at the heart of this action.''

CLINTON CALLS APEC FORUM `A SUCCESSFUL MEETING' 

</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUCKLAND, New Zealand _ The United States' three biggest
headaches in Asia _ Indonesia, North Korea and China _ all eased a
bit Monday as a Pacific Rim summit ended with the White House
declaring victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``The work we've done in the past few days will help build a
more secure, more prosperous, more integrated Asia Pacific
region,'' President Clinton told reporters Tuesday. He called the
APEC forum ``a successful meeting'' following the advancements on
East Timor, North Korea and China.
</P>
<P>
   The annual session ended with the 21 members sporting black
sailing jackets with a silver fern leaf, encompassing New Zealand's
sports teams colors, posing for a group picture. They issued a
declaration embracing free trade and pressing for a new round of
world trade talks.
</P>
<P>
   But it was security, not economics, that drew the focus of the
summit.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia's initial refusal to halt the killings by pro-Jakarta
militias in independence-minded East Timor dominated the two-day
conference but also gave a renewed purpose to the Asia Pacific
Economic Cooperation summit.
</P>
<P>
   Members rallied international opposition and, under Australia's
lead, assembled a peacekeeping force for the island.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia, whose population is largely Muslim, invaded East
Timor in 1975 and annexed it the following year. An estimated
200,000 East Timorese have died in two decades of conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Talks between the United States and North Korea being held in
Berlin also ``increased the potential for reduced tensions in the
Korean Peninsula,'' said Samuel ``Sandy'' Berger, the president's
national security adviser. North Korea pledged to suspend testing
of long-range missiles in return for the United States easing
economic sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   The isolated communist nation, its people suffering from famine,
repeatedly has threatened to develop a nuclear capability and its
test of one long-range missile over Japan sent shockwaves
throughout the region.
</P>
<P>
   Berger said administration officials would soon provide Clinton
with recommendations on what economic sanctions should be lifted
against North Korea. How to handle North Korea was the topic of a
private session between President Clinton and South Korea President
Kim Dae-Jung and Japan Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi.
</P>
<P>
   And, Clinton and Chinese President Jiang Zemin held their first
face-to-face session since the United States mistakenly bombed
Beijing's embassy in May in Yugoslavia. Clinton and Jiang agreed to
resume talks immediately for China's entry into the World Trade
Organization, which would require the world's most populous nation
to play by international trade rules.
</P>
<P>
   Berger said Taiwan remains a sensitive issue between the two
nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tensions in the U.S.-China relationship affect this entire
region,'' Berger said. ``I can't tell you how many leaders came up
to the president today and said that they were pleased that our
relationship was back on track.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States and China failed to resolve the WTO issue
during the summit but agreed to continue negotiations, which had
been halted following the embassy bombing.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of these issues can be resolved in one giant step,''
Berger said. ``Each requires patient work and persistent
engagement. But we feel that on balance, on the major issues that
threaten stability in this region, this week has witnessed a
genuine progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Gene Sperling, the president's economic adviser, said the United
States also achieved its goals in the APEC declaration issued by
its members at the close of the session.
</P>
<P>
   Sperling said the United States wanted a strong statement from
APEC in support of a new global trade negotiation that will begin
in November in Seattle. ``Things could not have gone much better in
that regard,'' Sperling said.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in two years, the APEC forum was not burdened
by the crushing recession that devastated so many Asian ecomonies.
The United States and others used the recession as an opportunity
to foster more open and honest markets in several countries.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, accompanied by his daughter Chelsea and mother-in-law
Dorothy Rodham, flew early Tuesday to scenic Queenstown, birthplace
of bungee jumping, to take a break at a New Zealand resort. Later,
he will visit Christchurch for a working visit with Prime Minister
Jenny Shipley. The president returns to Washington on Friday.

GRAYING OF NEW ENGLAND SKIERS SHOWN IN STUDY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ELLEN BARRY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Skiing, the sport once associated with bums and
bunnies, is turning gray fast in New England, a tourism consultant
and researcher told a meeting of regional ski industry leaders last
week.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1994 and 1998, the average age of skiers in New England
rose from 36.2 to 40.6, while the nationwide average rose more
slowly, from 37.6 to 38.7, according to pollster Bill Siegel's
company, Longwoods International. Meanwhile, during a period when
overnight travel grew by 22 percent, overnight ski trips in New
England grew by 11 percent _ less than half as fast as the ski
trips nationally, Siegel said.
</P>
<P>
   In the Mount Attitash lodge in Bartlett, N.H., where Siegel
delivered his news to 150 members of the New England Ski Industry
Summit, some listeners shrugged off the numbers, which don't
account for the day trippers, who are typically younger and less
affluent. Others looked at the bright side, congratulating
themselves on keeping skiers in the sport longer, with features
like Attitash's ``Thank Goodness I'm 50'' promotion.
</P>
<P>
   But Siegel, who puts out an annual breakdown of Americans'
leisure, said he had been shocked by the rapid aging on New
England's slopes. During the five-year period his survey followed,
the number of 18- to 24-year-olds who went on ski trips dropped by
5 percent, and the 25- to 34-year-olds dropped by 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I can do is throw the red flag up,'' he said. ``But I
think the industry had better jump on this one, because it looks
like a significant trend.''
</P>
<P>
   The Longwoods survey showed that the ski vacation is
increasingly a carriage trade, in which typical enthusiasts have an
average age of 38.7 and earn a salary upwards of $70,000.
Meanwhile, the number of ski vacationers who earn less than $25,000
dropped precipitously, from 13 percent to 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   While this upscaling trend is good news for resorts branching
into real estate, the long view could spell trouble, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of them may not have wanted to hear what I was saying,''
he said, emphasizing that if young people stop skiing, the sport
could go downhill fast.
</P>
<P>
   Siegel's presentation started a buzz at the Summit, but his
audience dispersed to their respective mountains without a sense of
panic. Greg Sweetser, executive director of the Ski Maine
Association, which commissioned Siegel's talk, prefers what he
calls the ``glass-half-full theory.''
</P>
<P>
   From his own perspective overseeing 16 ski areas in Maine,
Sweetser has drawn very different conclusions. The 55-and-up skiing
population _ which rose from 8 percent in 1994 to 21 percent in
1998, according to Siegel's results _ typically vacations longer
and spends more than their younger counterparts for a product that
has improved vastly in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   And without calculating day trips, ``I'm not sure we aren't
replacing the skiers on the other side,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Alice Pearce, the executive director of Ski New Hampshire,
said she is aware of the intangible buzz that made windsurfing hot
in the 1980s and snowboarding hot in the 1990s, and worries that
skiing has lost its sizzle. Pearce herself learned to ski under the
luminous influence of Jean-Claude Killy and Suzy Parker, and
transferred her affection in the 1990s to the Olympian brothers
Phil and Steve Mahre.
</P>
<P>
   But as ski promoters learned when snowboarding hit the industry
in 1995, even the best marketers have a tenuous control of fashion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you control what sport is going to be hot next? No, not at
all,'' she said. ``The opinion-makers say pogo-sticking is going to
be cool, and then the pogo stickers get access to media, and the
18- to 24-year-olds take up pogo sticking, and the high-schoolers
emulate the 18- to 24-year-olds, and the elementary schoolers
emulate the high schoolers.''
</P>
<P>
   With an increase nationwide of 26 percent, the ski trip was the
fourth fastest-growing form of vacation, after casino vacations,
which increased by 48 percent, and cruises, which increased by 30
percent. And despite the Northeast aging statistics that surprised
Siegel, skiing is in much better shape than, say, the group bus
tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their problem is a demographic one that is more severe,''
Siegel said. ``The person who would take a group bus tour is
basically a widow, a 70-plus widow. When you have a situation like
this, it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, because the kids
aren't going to be caught dead doing something for old people.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   One woman called 911 and demanded that someone come make her
coffee when her family didn't show up fast enough.
</P>
<P>
   Others call their adult children 40 or 50 times a day, asking
for everything from a back rub to help changing a light bulb.
</P>
<P>
   In nursing homes, they hit the call button every five minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Call them difficult, crotchety or just plain cranky _ they are
the highly vocal minority of elderly people formally described as
``high maintenance.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, they rode the porch rocker and yelled at passing
kids, or tormented long-suffering daughters-in-law in the privacy
of the family home.
</P>
<P>
   Today, social-service workers say, difficult older people are
growing in number, living longer and are increasingly separated
from their families.
</P>
<P>
   The result: They now rely on public caregivers, who seem no more
capable of pleasing them than were their daughters-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a bigger population of older people, including older
people with long-term disabilities, those who have had
mood-altering strokes and serious personality disorders that
intensify as they grow older,'' said Dr. Pam Willson, a Phoenix
area neuropsychologist.
</P>
<P>
   She and her husband, geropsychologist Gary Martin, say most of
their elderly patients are well-adjusted and easy to work with. A
quarter or a third of them, however, are ``difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Willson and Martin say they may account for less than 1 percent
of elders. Other caregivers say there are more, though their
``degree of difficulty'' varies.
</P>
<P>
   Gloria Davenport of Orange County, Calif., has even published a
new book on them. In`` Working with Toxic Older Adults,'' Davenport
estimates that 3 percent to 5 percent of those in their 80s or
older may be ``toxic'' _ not only to themselves but also to those
who try to help.
</P>
<P>
   These are not people who can be helped by medications, she said.
Some may have always had character disorders, but they were fine
when they lived on their own.
</P>
<P>
   Now they need help, and no one can please them.
</P>
<P>
   Learning to deal with overly demanding elders is uncharted
territory for some in the social services profession, Davenport
said. However, with the aging of 76 million baby boomers _ already
with a reputation for being somewhat demanding _ the territory is
likely to become well-traveled.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Lacey of the Maricopa County Area Agency on Aging said
extremely difficult elders may only make up 5 percent of the agency
ombudsmen's clientele _ but could easily take up 20 percent of
their time.
</P>
<P>
   The most irascible of this group call firefighters, police or
other community agencies every day, Dawn Savattone of the county
aging agency said. They are well known in emergency rooms and on
the ``do not service'' lists of home health care agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``If all the social workers in the city got together and we
started comparing names, I guarantee you that we would all know
them,'' Savattone said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They burn out every social service agency in town,'' said Bob
Peck, program manager for Adult Protective Services. Of the 300
calls APS gets each month, only about 10 fall into this category,
Peck said.
</P>
<P>
   Willson said, ``I don't think that there has been any organized
recognition of these folks and their problems. They are growing
enough in numbers that we have to deal with them in different
ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Often, ``high maintenance'' elders see the friction as someone
else's fault. They commonly register four or five complaints at a
time, and often threaten to sue.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you first call on them, you are a saint,'' Savattone
said. ``But eventually you fall off the pedestal and become another
of the enemy.''
</P>
<P>
   Some difficult elders say all they want is to be left alone in
their own home, Savattone said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But as soon as all the arrangements are made, they sabotage
them. They may fire home health aides, cancel meal deliveries and
not take their medications,'' she said. ``So they end up exactly
where they were _ surrounded by people trying to meet their needs.
I think they self-sabotage things because being left alone is their
worst nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   Most social service workers also caution that crankiness is not
an automatic part of old age.
</P>
<P>
   ``People of any age who are forced by circumstances to become
more dependent on others or on `the system,' can feel frustrated or
frightened,'' Willson said. ``If their coping ability was poor
beforehand, you can see real problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Davenport makes a clear distinction between ``toxic elders'' and
older people who simply need a lot of care. She said people serving
the former feel emotionally drained after being around them. Some
family members are driven to depression and sometimes nearly to
suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Davenport said her research found that many of the most
difficult people had been teachers, preachers, psychologists,
business owners, executives or others who had held positions of
power and control.
</P>
<P>
   When that erodes with age, she said, they may turn up the volume
of their demands, ``fearfully lashing out like children to maintain
control.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not all complaints are without merit, caregivers
quickly note. There is much to complain about as social service
budgets continue to shrink in Arizona. Sometimes, all a person can
do is fight for the services they need, and sometimes it works.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, however, the demands become counterproductive,
leading to abandonment or shuffling by the social-service
community.
</P>
<P>
   Catherine McCormick, 75, is developing a reputation that would
make her difficult to place in a nursing home - which is fine with
her.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Difficult and demanding' _ those are words I hear over and
over again,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She believes she gets a bad rap. She says that paid caregivers
sent to her have already been told that she is demanding, so that's
what they see.
</P>
<P>
   McCormick and another senior, James Berryman, were good-natured
enough to be interviewed and photographed for this article to
defend older people they say are unfairly called ``difficult and
demanding.'' According to Berryman, they are simply trying to
better their lives and those of others.
</P>
<P>
   By her own estimate, McCormick has had more than 300 caregivers
in her 27 years as a disabled arthritic. She has been fighting
Maricopa County Managed Care to stay in her home since 1994. Being
difficult _ if it is a strategy _ is so far working to keep her on
her own.
</P>
<P>
   She vows to die in her own home, with hospice at her bedside
when she is ready.
</P>
<P>
   Still, McCormick said she really doesn't understand all the
fuss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very polite,'' she said, ``and I expect the people who
are paid to take care of me to do their jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   A former counselor for the blind, McCormick said the underlying
problem is that there are no comprehensive care programs for
disabled elderly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who should be my advocates are my adversaries,''
she said. ``When you are helpless, they move in on you like a pack
of dogs.''
</P>
<P>
   Medical advances and the availability of home services have made
it possible for people like McCormick to live at home, despite
severe problems like diabetes, emphysema or coronary disease,
according to Willson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before, they may not have survived some strokes. Now they
survive, but may not be the same person,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Willson said she recently told one daughter that she would
probably never make her mother happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can make your mom relatively comfortable, that's the
best you can do,'' Willson recalls telling her.
</P>
<P>
   James Berryman is not too comfortable, even though he's bounced
around to dozens of nursing homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm known everywhere,'' said Berryman, 61, who says he has
been in nearly every nursing home in Phoenix during the past 27
years, following a construction accident in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   He has filed complaints about nursing home care to the
Department of Health Services, the Attorney General's Office and
the Maricopa County Ombudsmen.
</P>
<P>
   He sees himself as a nursing home whistle-blower, and figures
his reputation among nursing home administrators is: `` `He will
call the state on you in a minute.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Once, he said, he was bounced from a nursing home for speaking
ill of an administrator, not knowing she was within hearing
distance. Another time he got caught at a Christian nursing home
with a wine cooler in his pillowcase.
</P>
<P>
   Some difficult seniors call fire stations. Each Phoenix fire
station reports about two regular callers, often elderly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it overburdening the system? Not right now,'' Division
Chief Bob Khan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some are just looking for company _ they are so glad to see
you,'' Khan said. ``Others might call just because they are having
a bad day. When you got there, however, they might tell you that
it's none of your business.''
</P>
<P>
   One former regular _ a Romeo of the Westward Ho _ would have
asthma attacks in front of his paramours. Then, when he was asked
if he needed help, he would say ``she will take care of me.''
</P>
<P>
   About 20 to 25 percent of the 20 calls the Fire Department makes
each month to Westward Ho in downtown Phoenix are from people who
are lonely or aren't able to articulate exactly what they need.
</P>
<P>
   Khan calls them ``social calls.'' The same percentage would hold
true of other visits to seniors' homes or complexes, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may never be able to `fix it.''' he said. ``But we need to
adapt to make changes in the system so they have someone to call
besides 911.'' &QL;

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ After fighting off a hostile takeover for
the last two months, Elf Aquitaine SA of France capitulated Monday
and agreed to be acquired for roughly $48.8 billion by a domestic
rival, Total Fina SA.
</P>
<P>
   If completed, the deal would create the world's fourth-largest
oil company _topped only by the proposed Exxon-Mobil combination;
the Anglo-Dutch oil giant Royal Dutch/Shell; and the planned merger
of BP Amoco and ARCO.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement announced Monday is another milestone in Europe's
fast-changing corporate culture. It is the Continent's second huge
hostile takeover in the last few months, following Olivetti SpA's
successful $65 billion bid for Telecom Italia.
</P>
<P>
   It was also the first time a big European company invoked a
``Pac-Man'' takeover defense, in which a company tries to acquire
the company that wants to acquire it.
</P>
<P>
   Both Elf and Total Fina had acknowledged for weeks that they
would merge in one form or another. The big questions were who
would be in charge and whose strategy would prevail.
</P>
<P>
   The clear victor Monday was Thierry Desmarest, the chairman of
Total Fina, who surprised Elf with a hostile bid worth nearly $43
billion on July 5.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal reached Monday, after a long weekend of
bargaining, Total Fina sweetened its all-stock offer by about $6
billion. Desmarest will run the combined company and the chairman
of Elf, Philippe Jaffre, will step down.
</P>
<P>
   The new price works out to about 190 euros, or about $197.60,
for each Elf share, compared with about 170 euros a share in
Total's original bid. Shares of Elf jumped 3.15 percent, to 186.5
euros, after Monday's announcement, while Total Fina slipped
four-tenths of 1 percent, to 129.5 euros.
</P>
<P>
   The companies also appear to be following Desmarest's basic
strategy, which was to retain control of the two companies'
chemical operations. In his counterbid against Total Fina, Jaffre
had proposed spinning off most of the chemical operations and
focusing more closely on the oil business.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement came after two months of tense struggle between
the executives of the companies, whose headquarters are within a
short walk of each other near La Defense, a huge office and
shopping complex, in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Desmarest, who had met with Jaffre occasionally over lunch,
began his unsolicited bid after failing to persuade his rival that
the acceleration of oil-industry mergers made a merger of their two
companies logical.
</P>
<P>
   Jaffre quickly denounced the bid as both hostile and inadequate,
and then fired back a few weeks later with his own plan.
</P>
<P>
   The French government, which once owned Elf, played an important
role by refusing to interfere with Total Fina's offer and quietly
warning Elf not to seek a foreign partner as a ``white knight.''
</P>
<P>
   That severely limited Jaffre's options. More than a month ago,
he had made it clear he was willing to compromise to get a peaceful
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies began serious negotiating late last week and
worked through the weekend, company executives said.
</P>
<P>
   Edouard de Royere, a former president of Air Liquide and a
friend of both Jaffre's and Desmarest's, acted as a mediator.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the negotiations were handled by two board members from
each company. Total Fina's team included Serge Tchuruk, chairman of
the electronics conglomerate Alcatel SA and Desmarest's predecessor
at Total Fina; and Jerome Monod, chairman of Suez Lyonnaise des
Eaux, the large French utility.
</P>
<P>
   Elf's team was led by Michel Pebereau, chairman of Banque
Nationale de Paris, and Bertrand Collomb, chairman of La Farge SA,
one of France's biggest producers of construction material.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Monday in Paris, Jaffre appeared tired but
sought to put the best possible light on things. He noted that
Total Fina was now offering a significantly higher premium for Elf
_ 26 percent over Elf's stock price on July 2, just before the
original offer, versus just 15 percent earlier.
</P>
<P>
   He also said the agreement would create a French oil company
with enough influence to compete with the giants in today's
markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``This deal creates a major French champion in both oil and
chemicals,'' Jaffre said. It ``assures a great future for a company
that holds a very great place in the history of France,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Desmarest, smiling broadly as he took the lead in outlining the
agreement Monday, insisted he was not interested in ``size for
size's sake.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said the company needed more scale to keep up. ``When we
examine our competitors, they are even larger,'' he said. ``That's
why we feel a small push in the race for expansion.''
</P>
<P>
   Desmarest said the merger would produce annual savings of about
1.5 billion euros, or about $1.56 billion. The companies plan to
eliminate about 2,000 jobs in France, but they said those
reductions would be made through early retirement, attrition and
voluntary incentives.
</P>
<P>
   The deal announced Monday was the latest in a series of brash
moves that have distinguished Desmarest since he took command
several years ago of what was then called Total SA.
</P>
<P>
   Though educated in France's best schools, he spent years in the
oilfields. He infuriated the American government two years ago by
signing an oil deal with Iran. This year he took over Petrofina SA,
a big Belgian oil company, which promptly put his company in the
same ranks as Elf Aquitaine.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Desmarest suggested he was still on the lookout for
potential acquisitions, saying he would not ``close the door'' on
other deals. &QL;

Peck, program manager for Adult Protective Services. Of the 300
calls APS gets each month, only about 10 fall into this category,
Peck said.
</P>
<P>
   Willson said, ``I don't think that there has been any organized
recognition of these folks and their problems. They are growing
enough in numbers that we have to deal with them in different
ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Often, ``high maintenance'' elders see the friction as someone
else's fault. They commonly register four or five complaints at a
time, and often threaten to sue.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you first call on them, you are a saint,'' Savattone
said. ``But eventually you fall off the pedestal and become another
of the enemy.''
</P>
<P>
   Some difficult elders say all they want is to be left alone in
their own home, Savattone said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But as soon as all the arrangements are made, they sabotage
them. They may fire home health aides, cancel meal deliveries and
not take their medications,'' she said. ``So they end up exactly
where they were _ surrounded by people trying to meet their needs.
I think they self-sabotage things because being left alone is their
worst nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   Most social service workers also caution that crankiness is not
an automatic part of old age.
</P>
<P>
   ``People of any age who are forced by circumstances to become
more dependent on others or on `the system,' can feel frustrated or
frightened,'' Willson said. ``If their coping ability was poor
beforehand, you can see real problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Davenport makes a clear distinction between ``toxic elders'' and
older people who simply need a lot of care. She said people serving
the former feel emotionally drained after being around them. Some
family members are driven to depression and sometimes nearly to
suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Davenport said her research found that many of the most
difficult people had been teachers, preachers, psychologists,
business owners, executives or others who had held positions of
power and control.
</P>
<P>
   When that erodes with age, she said, they may turn up the volume
of their demands, ``fearfully lashing out like children to maintain
control.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not all complaints are without merit, caregivers
quickly note. There is much to complain about as social service
budgets continue to shrink in Arizona. Sometimes, all a person can
do is fight for the services they need, and sometimes it works.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, however, the demands become counterproductive,
leading to abandonment or shuffling by the social-service
community.
</P>
<P>
   Catherine McCormick, 75, is developing a reputation that would
make her difficult to place in a nursing home - which is fine with
her.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Difficult and demanding' _ those are words I hear over and
over again,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She believes she gets a bad rap. She says that paid caregivers
sent to her have already been told that she is demanding, so that's
what they see.
</P>
<P>
   McCormick and another senior, James Berryman, were good-natured
enough to be interviewed and photographed for this article to
defend older people they say are unfairly called ``difficult and
demanding.'' According to Berryman, they are simply trying to
better their lives and those of others.
</P>
<P>
   By her own estimate, McCormick has had more than 300 caregivers
in her 27 years as a disabled arthritic. She has been fighting
Maricopa County Managed Care to stay in her home since 1994. Being
difficult _ if it is a strategy _ is so far working to keep her on
her own.
</P>
<P>
   She vows to die in her own home, with hospice at her bedside
when she is ready.
</P>
<P>
   Still, McCormick said she really doesn't understand all the
fuss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very polite,'' she said, ``and I expect the people who
are paid to take care of me to do their jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   A former counselor for the blind, McCormick said the underlying
problem is that there are no comprehensive care programs for
disabled elderly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who should be my advocates are my adversaries,''
she said. ``When you are helpless, they move in on you like a pack
of dogs.''
</P>
<P>
   Medical advances and the availability of home services have made
it possible for people like McCormick to live at home, despite
severe problems like diabetes, emphysema or coronary disease,
according to Willson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before, they may not have survived some strokes. Now they
survive, but may not be the same person,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Willson said she recently told one daughter that she would
probably never make her mother happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can make your mom relatively comfortable, that's the
best you can do,'' Willson recalls telling her.
</P>
<P>
   James Berryman is not too comfortable, even though he's bounced
around to dozens of nursing homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm known everywhere,'' said Berryman, 61, who says he has
been in nearly every nursing home in Phoenix during the past 27
years, following a construction accident in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   He has filed complaints about nursing home care to the
Department of Health Services, the Attorney General's Office and
the Maricopa County Ombudsmen.
</P>
<P>
   He sees himself as a nursing home whistle-blower, and figures
his reputation among nursing home administrators is: `` `He will
call the state on you in a minute.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Once, he said, he was bounced from a nursing home for speaking
ill of an administrator, not knowing she was within hearing
distance. Another time he got caught at a Christian nursing home
with a wine cooler in his pillowcase.
</P>
<P>
   Some difficult seniors call fire stations. Each Phoenix fire
station reports about two regular callers, often elderly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it overburdening the system? Not right now,'' Division
Chief Bob Khan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some are just looking for company _ they are so glad to see
you,'' Khan said. ``Others might call just because they are having
a bad day. When you got there, however, they might tell you that
it's none of your business.''
</P>
<P>
   One former regular _ a Romeo of the Westward Ho _ would have
asthma attacks in front of his paramours. Then, when he was asked
if he needed help, he would say ``she will take care of me.''
</P>
<P>
   About 20 to 25 percent of the 20 calls the Fire Department makes
each month to Westward Ho in downtown Phoenix are from people who
are lonely or aren't able to articulate exactly what they need.
</P>
<P>
   Khan calls them ``social calls.'' The same percentage would hold
true of other visits to seniors' homes or complexes, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may never be able to `fix it.''' he said. ``But we need to
adapt to make changes in the system so they have someone to call
besides 911.'' &QL;

 By ANNE STEPHENSON  
 c.1999 Special for The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here are Anne Stephenson's capsule reviews:
</P>
<P>
   ``THE COMPLETE STORIES OF EVELYN WAUGH'' &QL; 
(Little, Brown, $29.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``His style,'' said Edmund Wilson, ``has the desperate
jauntiness of an orchestra fiddling away for dear life on a sinking
ship.'' Evelyn Waugh was wicked and funny, and his fellow writers
were happy to apply the same tactics to him. Here are his works of
short fiction, 39 stories collected for the first time in hardcover
for American readers (the book was adapted from a scholarly edition
published last year in Great Britain). They include ``By Special
Request,'' in which Waugh suggests an alternative ending to his
novel, ``A Handful of Dust,'' and ``Charles Ryder's Schooldays,'' a
chapter in the life of the hero of ``Brideshead Revisited,''
published 16 years after Waugh's death. To coincide with this
volume, Back Bay Books has reissued ``Brideshead Revisited,''
``Decline and Fall,'' ``Vile Bodies,'' ``A Handful of Dust'' and
``Scoop'' in paperback. The books are like Waugh himself _
handsome, with viciously funny stories inside. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``A LITTLE MORE ABOUT ME'' &QL; 
By Pam Houston (Norton, $23.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Actually, this is a LOT more about her, and it is dumbfoundingly
interesting. Houston does nothing, really, except talk about
herself in these essays, yet unlike her filmed recitations for
television's ``Sunday Morning,'' these monologues pull you in, and
before you know it, you've stayed for the duration. Maybe it's the
swagger in what she has to say, the stockpile of experience, the
competence at things that are foreign to many women, and many men,
for that matter. If you've read her short-story collections
(``Cowboys Are My Weakness,'' ``Waltzing the Cat''), you know that
Houston is on intimate terms with adventure, with wilderness, with
danger, and with difficult men who thrive on all three. She has
been a hunting guide in the mountains of Alaska, and she has run so
many white-water rivers in so many countries that she can't
remember them all. She was addicted to risk for a long time, but
she's getting over it. She has a ranch now, and is learning to call
it her own. Finally, she has good friends and, it seems, a
boyfriend who goes against type. In one of these essays she takes
him winter camping and he admits that he has never slept on the
ground before. What's amazing is that she doesn't hold it against
him. Her essays are about mountains, rivers, horses, dogs, hunters
and _ we sure didn't see this one coming _ her lifelong obsession
with her weight. ``Even to this day,'' she writes, ``call me stupid
and I'll laugh in your face; call me a bad writer and I'll discuss
art with you all day long; but call me fat and you'll send me
sobbing to the bathroom, and I'll wear tent dresses for the next
six days.'' It might be the most ordinary thing we've ever heard
about Pam Houston. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``BEST SHOTS: THE GREATEST NFL PHOTOGRAPHY OF THE CENTURY'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
(DK, $30) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Take a look at Barry Sanders on Page 70,'' writes Joe Namath
in his foreword. ``Just look at his feet, his legs, his body
movement, his motion _ how his body weight is leaning so hard to
one side. Look at that right foot of his! And he's still going at
full speed, you know, he's not falling down. I mean, he's exploding
somewhere.'' It's true, you'll be impressed. Sanders, photographed
in 1995 by Allen Kee, is cutting so hard that his body is hanging
out over thin air and the twist of his pivot foot has distorted the
leather of his shoe _ AND HE'S NOT FALLING DOWN. Or look at Lynn
Swann on Page 84, making, in 1976, one of the most spectacular
catches in Super Bowl history. Or at Terry Glenn, turning to draw
in a Drew Bledsoe pass that has just emerged from a dense fog that
hides anything more than a few feet above the field. Or at
linebacker Chuck Bednarik celebrating over the prostrate form of
Frank Gifford, who looks like road kill in a helmet. There's lots
of drama here, but our favorite is a quiet photograph that puts the
others to shame. It shows, quite simply, Walter Payton running a
path created for him by his Chicago Bears teammates. It's an
understated moment that reveals football at its best _ the
precision teamwork, the finesse, the choreography of the game.
(That's the Giants' Mark Ingram on the book jacket, celebrating in
the end zone.) &QL; 
 &QL; 
``LISTEN TO THIS!'' &QL; 
By Alan Reder and John Baxter (Hyperion, $16.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Reder and Baxter spent four years interviewing popular musicians
about their favorite artists and recordings. The result is this
volume, which offers educated and honest opinions (Dave Matthews
says he listens to Keith Jarrett's album, ``The Koln Concert,''
because ``it calms me down, like watching windshield wipers'')
about today's music from some of the people who know it best. The
Beatles are mentioned more than any other group or artist. Other
favorites include James Brown, Joni Mitchell, Hank Williams, Muddy
Waters, the Rolling Stones, John Coltrane, Otis Redding, Elvis
Presley, Charlie Parker, B.B. King, Howlin' Wolf, Jimi Hendrix,
Aretha Franklin, Miles Davis, Lightnin' Hopkins, Ray Charles and
Bob Dylan. But not all of the names are famous, so it's possible to
discover new territory for your own listening pleasure. The authors
note, for example, that Dave Matthews, Ani DiFranco and Victoria
Williams all list among their favorites ``an obscure but very
special album'' by Mary Margaret O'Hara called ``Miss America.''
The book includes a master list of artists, and its index will
inspire you, too. Among the musicians polled are Pat Metheny,
Waylon Jennings, Joan Armatrading, Vassar Clements, Michael Doucet,
Pete Seeger, Sonny Rollins, Willie Nelson, Branford Marsalis, Bobby
McFerrin, Herbie Hancock and Dr. John. &QL;

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ A hurricane that meteorologists said was four times the
size of the infamous Andrew and potentially even more destructive
pounded toward Florida Monday, forcing hundreds of thousands from
their homes and leaving countless residents to hope that the
massive storm would somehow miss their cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``This hurricane,'' said Jerry Jarrell, director of the National
Hurricane Center, ``could be catastrophic.''
</P>
<P>
   From as far south as Miami to as far north as Cape Canaveral,
hundreds of thousands of people evacuated the densely populated
Florida coast as the storm, with winds of more than 155 mph, crept
westward across the Atlantic and forecasters' radar screens.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like a giant bullseye out there,'' said Brad Cramer,
a lifeguard on Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   All day Monday, state meteorologists offered hope that Hurricane
Floyd would be nudged from its westerly course by a trough of low
pressure air moving to the east and southeast, and, instead of
making landfall in South Florida, travel up the coast, its
dangerous eye offshore.
</P>
<P>
   But that hope seemed to weaken by early Monday evening as Floyd
plowed west and slightly northwest, in the general direction of
Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the sort of the thing you have nightmares about,''
said Bill Bill O'Brien, director of emergency management in Palm
Beach County.
</P>
<P>
   In a frightening scenario, the hurricane could turn north just
as the most powerful winds surrounding the eye make landfall,
sending the most destructive part of the hurricane along the coast,
meteorologists said.
</P>
<P>
   Like Andrew in 1992, which killed 40 people, wrecked 160 homes
and caused more than $25 billion in damages, Floyd was a category 4
storm on Monday. It was on the verge of being a category 5, the
most powerful, as of Monday evening, with the power to turn houses
into rubble and splinters if it makes landfall.
</P>
<P>
   But Jarrell warned that even if the hurricane's eye stays as
much as 30 miles off the coast the storm could still rip roofs off
houses and flatten walls. Meteorologists called it a history-making
storm.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Gottschalck, a research associate in Meteorology at the
University of Miami's Rosentiel School of Marine and Atmospheric
Science, called it ``one of the largest and strongest storms'' in
history to hit the U.S. coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``It runs 700 miles in all directions,'' he said of the storm's
size, noting that the hurricane-force winds extend 120 miles from
its eye. ``We are going to feel it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasters, while warning that this hurricane was large and
powerful enough to overcome steering winds like the much-hoped-for
southeasterly front, still held some hope that the trough would
nudge it northeasterly.
</P>
<P>
   As night fell on South Florida, shelters and hotel rooms inland,
especially around Palm Beach, began to fill; cruise ships left for
safer waters to the south; long flotillas of pleasure craft snaked
along canals looking for safe harbor, as lines grew at hardware and
grocery stores.
</P>
<P>
   Because it was still too soon to more accurately estimate the
storm's landfall, the entire state of Florida was placed under a
hurricane warning. More than 200,000 people on Florida's
east-central coast were told to evacuate, and another 200,000 were
evacuated from coastal areas of Miami-Dade County.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Allen Fiske's boat is his home, and he was worried about losing
it as the storm drew closer. A paraplegic since a car accident 17
years ago, he lives aboard his 35-foot sailboat, ``Minimum
Balance.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what I'm going to do,'' he said. ``I can leave it
here at Dinner Key marina and let it get smashed into the pilings,
or I could take it up the Miami River along with everybody else and
let it get smashed against all the other boats. `I'm leaning toward
going south, down to Key Largo.'' The Keys, he said, seem to be the
one place in Florida that are out of harm's way.
</P>
<P>
   While a few people said they thought the evacuations were
premature and a sign of media-driven panic, most people took the
threat seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have only been two other category 5 hurricanes to hit
the U.S. _ Camille in the 1960s and an unnamed storm in 1935,''
said Gottschalck. ``This kind of storm needs to be taken
seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   As far north as Jacksonville, people watched in amazement as the
huge storm swirled across television screens, larger than the state
it was approaching.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, my God,'' said Courtney Edwards, 17, as she saw maps of
the storm on a big-screen television in the electronics department
of a department store in Jacksonville.
</P>
<P>
   Further south, even people who lived miles inland considered
leaving their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did consider driving to Atlanta,'' said Bettye Cox, who
lives in Boca Raton. Instead, she just bought hurricane supplies.
</P>
<P>
   As the storm approached, the weather along the South Florida
beaches as far north as Palm Beach was balmy and breezy _ a perfect
day.
</P>
<P>
   Arturo Penalver, 65, a retired longshoreman from Brooklyn, took
a swim on Palm Beach. ``It's beautiful,'' said Penalver. ``I don't
believe it will come here.''
</P>
<P>
   Edmond Zion, a retired limo driver from Queens, also scoffed at
the growing concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would think that people down here would be used to these
storms already,'' he said. ``They act like it's all new, like they
never heard of such a thing before.''
</P>
<P>
   But in this case, it may be true. This storm could be something
entirely new.
</P>
<P>
   As if the threat of this hurricane was not enough bad news for
Florida, another potentially dangerous storm, Hurricane Gert, seems
to be taking roughly the same path as Floyd, just a few days
behind.
</P>
<P>
   That storm, which developed into a full-fledged hurricane
Monday, was expected to push through the Leeward Islands, Virgin
Islands and Puerto Rico later this week, and _ if it stays on
course _ eventually threaten Florida or the east coast. Though not
as large as Floyd, Gert, the fifth hurricane of the season, was
expected to pound through the Atlantic with winds well over 100
mph.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Floyd is trouble enough.
</P>
<P>
   On ritzy Worth Avenue in Palm Beach, Susan Bryden and six
friends, visiting from Agawam, Mass., hurried through their
shopping to make an evening flight home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're leaving,'' said Ms. Bryden, as employees pulled shutters
down on the windows of Saks Fifth Avenue and Ralph Lauren, ``and
we're glad of it.''
</P>
<P>
   In Miami, the last cruise ship had lumbered out of the harbor by
6 p.m. Most workers had left downtown early. To the north, in Palm
Beach, workers cleared the last chairs off the beaches.
</P>
<P>
   Cramer, the lifeguard, has seen this deceptive calm before.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you live here, you get used to the idea of hurricanes,
but you respect them,'' he said. ``This one demands a lot of
respect.''

 &HT;    Designes from Carolina Herrara patently elegant
 &HT;    By A. Scott Walton
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Ever tasteful, Carolina Herrera set herself apart
from the 100-plus designers staging spring/summer 2000 previews
during this Fashion Week by demonstrating how to bring a little
sensual elegance to patent leather. Highlighting Herrera's
52-ensemble show were: a motorcycling-inspired white patent leather
jacket paired with a tan crepe skirt with a ruffled hem; a
sleeveless beige patent top paired with hip-riding white pants; and
a knee-length white patent skirt worn with a pink camisole
featuring Moroccan tile-inspired embroidery.
</P>
<P>
   The patent pieces drove home Herrera's message about gloss;
further support for her shiny forecast came in the form of second
skin dresses and camisoles in glistening silk/jersey knits,
slim-fitting separates slathered in sequins, chintzed linens and
silk shantungs.
</P>
<P>
   Herrera says ``individuality, self-confidence, originality and
chic are the hallmarks'' of her collection. And it would indeed
require a unique sense of style to adopt some of the color
combinations (pink-and-brown, for instance) that she proposed.
What's more, her clothes were rather revealing in the upper thigh,
back, cleavage and love-handle areas. Skirts were knee- to
floor-length, but slit high. Tab closure pants, asymmetrical
necklines, intricate embroidery, and ruffled shirtfronts were the
most notable details.
</P>
<P>
   The actress Lyn Whitfield looked mesmerized as she made her way
backstage to congratulate Herrera.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very much impressed,'' said Whitfield. ``I loved that
citron taffeta shirt with the ruffles. And all those asymmetrical
halter tops with the jeweled orchid brooches were divine.''
</P>
<P>
   Betsey Johnson
</P>
<P>
   What do grandmothers, cross-dressers, fire-eaters and
bandleaders have in common?
</P>
<P>
   Nothing really. But that didn't stop non-comformist designer
Betsey Johnson from using them to model her spring/summer '00
designs.
</P>
<P>
   Among those strutting around Johnson's Pepto pink showroom in
outfits befitting belly dancers, burlesque queens and beach bunnies
were producer/composer Quincy Jones' daughter Kidada, rocker Steven
Tyler's daughters Teresa and Chelsea, stripper Candis Cayne and the
designer's 50-something sister, Sally Banulis.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's denim jeans were skintight, cropped below the knee and
appliqued with flowers and sequins. Her mini-floral print dresses
were semi-sheer, form-fitting and long. Done up in cotton candy
shades of pink, blue, yellow and green _ with some racy reds and
brazen blacks thrown in for spice _ Johnson's was a ''sweet''
collection that should appeal to the ''girl'' in every woman.
</P>

   THE SCENE
</P>
<P>
   Beautiful (people) show of support for Versace
</P>
<P>
   By A. Scott Walton
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Celebrities crowded into Donatella Versace's show
Sunday night for the unveiling of her spring/summer Versus
collection.
</P>
<P>
   Sly Stallone, Lisa Marie Presley, Natasha Richardson and Madonna
_ all of whom had place cards marking their turf for the event _
dutifully showed up to support the glam-rock designer.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta-based record producer Dallas Austin was one of the many
celebs seated in the first four rows. (Fame is relative though: his
spot was marked: ``Friend of (``Blade'' co-star) Stephen Dorff.'')
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in a hi-tech hodge-podge of streetwear, his trademark
wraparound sunglasses and his spiky hair bleached strawberry
blonde, Austin admitted he was a novice to the runway show
experience.
</P>
<P>
   ''For one thing,'' he said, ''it's a Versace show. And for
another, I was just hanging out with Stephen and we decided to come
by.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't wear much Versace,'' Austin added, ''but I admire her
work.''
</P>
<P>
   The producer of platinum-selling records by the likes of TLC,
Madonna and Michael Jackson, Austin had come to town for last
week's MTV Video Awards and stuck around to work on rock priestess
Stevie Nicks' next album. (''It's going to be called, 'Trouble in
Shangri La,'' he said of Nicks' comeback effort. ''So far, it's
going great.'')
</P>
<P>
   Things appear to be going great for Donatella as well. Though
she was never one to shun the limelight, she was thrust into the
chief design post of her family-owned business when her brother
Gianni was gunned down two years ago in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Throngs of autograph-seekers and paparazzi waited outside her
standing-room-only show, which was enlivened by music from the rave
band Les Rhythmes Digitales. The designer came out for her
post-show bow looking exceedingly youthful in a tiny green tank and
stretch pants.
</P>
<P>
   For spring, Versace favors wraparound skirts that flash lots of
leg, cheekily short shorts, transparent T-shirts with floral
appliques, lightweight leather separates, cropped pants that flare
out at the knee and snow white cotton separates covered in copper
eyelets or sequins. The color scheme included acid-bright shades of
pink, yellow, orange, blue and green. Details included copper
zippers, pants pleated on the diagonal and high-heeled shoes with
fluorescent soles.
</P>
<P>
   Other celebs in attendance included: ''My Best Friend's
Wedding'' co-star Rupert Everett, actresses Juliette Lewis and
Minnie Driver, Aerosmith's Stephen Tyler, Mary J. Blige,
photographers Herb Ritts and Steven Meisel, Spike Lee, and a Will
Smith-less Jada Pinkett. The tiny actress, whose hair has grown out
into a curly afro, wore a sheath so tight and so sheer that
onlookers agreed she couldn't have had on underwear.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's by a young, African-American designer I found named
Rona,'' Pinkett said. ''Her label's called Nude.''
</P>
<P>
   But of course.

FIREFIGHTER SUES BOSTON, CHARGING `HOSTILE' WORKPLACE

<P>
   BOSTON -- Boston's first black female firefighter has slapped
the city and its fire department with a federal civil rights suit
alleging that she has been forced to work in a ``hostile''
environment, while her complaints of harassment have long been
ignored by higher-ups.
</P>
<P>
   Karen L. Miller, who was suspended for four weeks last year for
appearing in a racy skit about fire prevention on public-access
cable televison, also alleges in the suit that she was disciplined
harsher than white colleagues who committed more serious offenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fire department refuses to admit there are any problems on
the job,'' said Miller, 43, who in 1985 became the first black
woman to join the department.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't want to acknowledge that there are still some very
nasty attitudes toward women on the job, toward gays and toward
minorities,'' Miller said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Miller received the month-long suspension without pay last
November for her appearance on ``Fire Spot,'' a show that offered
fire safety tips to children and a few sexual innuendos geared
toward parents.
</P>
<P>
   While pretending to be a little girl, Miller pulled a fire
detector, underwear, whipped cream and a funny-shaped balloon from
a magic box while cracking jokes with another firefighter. Two
other firefighters received written reprimands after the broadcast
and the show's producer was suspended for five days.
</P>
<P>
   ``The show was innocuous, but the department wanted to make it
seem like it was pornographic,'' said Miller, adding that she
believed she was singled out for the harshest discipline as
``retaliation'' for lodging a complaint against the Fire Department
with the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   The MCAD complaint filed in 1994 by Miller and three other
female firefighters mirrors many of the allegations in Miller's
federal lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Miller said another firefighter who took a department car to a
New Hampshire racetrack without permission while off-duty received
only a four-day suspension.
</P>
<P>
   And she says firefighters who brought a blow-up doll and a
``nasty'' cake to a bachelor party at Fire Department headquarters
in January received only a written reprimand.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a possibility that if I was a white male up there doing
this show it probably wouldn't have been a big deal,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the Fire Department nor Mayor Thomas Menino would
comment on the suit Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, which names the city as well as the fire
department, alleges a pattern of harassment spanning 14 years.
Miller says that when hired, she was required to undergo a
psychiatric evaluation in which she was subjected to offensive and
inappropriate questions about hypothetical situations involving sex
in the fire station.
</P>
<P>
   While assigned to Ladder 10 in Jamaica Plain from 1985 to 1993,
Miller said she was prohibited from using bathrooms reserved for
officers, which were the only ones with locks. Miller said male
firefighters deliberately walked in on female firefighters while
they were showering or using the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   Although Miller spent six years in the US Army Reserves, where
she operated heavy equipment, she says she was prohibited from
driving fire trucks while working at the Jamaica Plain station.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994 Miller transferred to the Fire Prevention Division at
headquarters. Her job was to lecture about fire safety at schools
and offices and conduct on-site fire inspections.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Miller says her superiors refused to allow her to attend
training sessions, even when she offered to pay her own expenses to
attend the national fire academy.
</P>
<P>
   When she complained to a captain about being called derogatory
names by a colleague, Miller said she was told, ``Don't be so
thin-skinned, we can't make everybody like you.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller is the only woman assigned to Engine 48 in Hyde Park. In
fact, she is one of only 11 women on the department, including five
whites, six blacks and one Hispanic, according to officials.
Minorities constitute 29 percent of the 1,592-member force, but
only 3 percent of the upper ranks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the job,'' Miller said. ``There are a lot of nice guys
on the job. It's just a few that make it miserable for everybody
else. And that's all it takes. Then the administration doesn't take
a no-tolerance stand.''

COMMENTARY:   A LIGHT UNTO THE NATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By ANTHONY LEWIS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A friend in Israel remarked that over this past
weekend, the weekend of the New Year, people spoke of their country
turning a corner in its history. They were talking not about
politics or the peace process but about a decision of Israel's
Supreme Court: one that barred the use of painful physical methods
in the questioning of suspected terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   It was a remarkable decision, and not just for Israel. The
opinion for a unanimous court, by its president, Justice Aharon
Barak, spoke to judges and lawyers everywhere _ and really to the
citizens of all democracies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although a democracy must often fight with one hand tied
behind its back,'' Barak wrote, ``it nonetheless has the upper
hand. Preserving the rule of law and recognition of an individual's
liberty constitutes an important component in its understanding of
security. At the end of the day, they strengthen its spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   Several coercive physical interrogation techniques used by
Israel's security services were at issue. One is shaking, defined
as ``the forceful shaking of the suspect's upper torso, back and
forth, repeatedly, in a manner which causes the neck and head to
dangle and vacillate rapidly.'' An expert opinion given in the case
said such shaking could ``cause serious brain damage'' and ``harm
the spinal cord.''
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli government argued that shaking and other methods of
physical pressure did no permanent harm to the suspect. It argued,
as Barak put it, that such methods were ``indispensable to fighting
and winning the war on terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   The court said it had to balance the need to fight terrorism
against the need to respect human dignity. ``A democratic,
freedom-loving society does not accept that investigators use any
means ... ,'' Barak wrote. ``An illegal investigation harms the
suspect's human dignity. It equally harms society's image.''
</P>
<P>
   That approach is familiar in American constitutional law. Long
before the modern era the Supreme Court barred the use of
third-degree methods by the police. But the Israeli court had over
the years refrained from deciding claims against security
interrogations.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's court held only that physically coercive methods were
unlawful because they had not been authorized by Israel's
parliament, the Knesset. It was there, Barak said, that the
``pointed debate'' must occur. If there is such a debate, the
Knesset will have to face up for the first time, as a result of the
court's words, to the hard questions about the values of Israeli
society.
</P>
<P>
   A right-wing American commentator, writing in The Wall Street
Journal, saw the decision as ``a form of unilateral disarmament by
Israel.'' The headline asked, ``Has Israel Lost Its Nerve?''
</P>
<P>
   Many Israelis feel, to the contrary, that in the Supreme Court's
judgment Israel found its soul. Dan Meridor, a former leading
figure in the conservative Likud Party, said it ``constituted a
certificate of honor for the state of Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   The nine judges who decided the case had no illusions about the
terrorist threat to Israel. ``We are not isolated in an ivory
tower,'' Barak wrote. ``We live the life of this country. We are
aware of the harsh reality of terrorism.'' He foresaw also that
critics would attack the decision without reading the opinion. But
judges, he said, ``must act according to the law ... When we sit to
judge, we are being judged.''
</P>
<P>
   The hardest issue facing the court was whether security
interrogators could put physical pressure on a suspect who might
know about a ``ticking time bomb.'' Years ago Jacobo Timerman, who
was tortured by interrogators under an Argentine military
dictatorship, asked me what I would do in that very situation. I
said that torture might be justified. ``No!'' he said. ``Never!
Once you start down that road, there is no end.''
</P>
<P>
   That is the position the Israeli court has taken. In doing so it
has defined its country, as our Supreme Court defined the United
States when it decided Brown vs. Board of Education. It has turned
Israel toward the role that Justice Louis D. Brandeis and other
early Zionists saw for a Jewish state: to be a light unto the
nations.

 &HT;    Jury hears Abernathy discussing expense payments
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Jurors listened Monday to the voice of former state
Sen. Ralph David Abernathy III trying to convince his public
relations adviser that it would be ``no big deal'' for her to say
he actually gave her $2,700 in expenses the state paid out for her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who knows I didn't pay you the money I said I paid you?''
Abernathy asked Zee Bradford on one of two tapes played for the
jurors.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one,'' she replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``So if you say you got it, it ain't a big deal,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradford, who now works in Atlanta Mayor Bill Campbell's office,
was the state's star witness as it concluded its theft, false
swearing, oath betrayal and forgery case against Abernathy, son of
the famous civil rights leader. He is accused in 35 counts based on
10 incidents of alleged chiseling on his Senate expense account.
</P>
<P>
   The defense's presentation is expected to be brief since
Visiting Superior Court Judge L.A. McConnell told the jury it might
get the case today. He also indicated he is strongly considering
granting a motion for a directed verdict of acquittal on the
state's six weakest counts.
</P>
<P>
   Bradford testified she agreed to handle Abernathy's public
relations in the 1998 session of the Legislature for $9,000.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant Attorney General Stacy Hydrick showed Bradford two
vouchers Abernathy turned in to the Senate Fiscal Office, one
saying she had been paid $1,200 and another saying she had received
$1,500 for personal services.
</P>
<P>
   In each case, Hydrick asked:
</P>
<P>
   ``Is that your signature on that document?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, it is not,'' Bradford replied each time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you ever receive $1,500 from Ralph Abernathy?''
</P>
<P>
   ``To date in all my life I have only received $300 from him, in
three payments, as God is my witness,'' Bradford replied.
</P>
<P>
   She said Abernathy came to her house the night of July 30, 1998,
showed her the documents and said that if anyone asked, she should
say she received the money. ``I told him I would not lie,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Not long after, GBI agent Fred Mays came to her office to ask
her about the vouchers. Bradford denied signing them or receiving
the money, she said, and Mays asked her if she would tape any phone
conversations she had with Abernathy.
</P>
<P>
   No sooner had Mays given her a tape recorder, she said, than a
television reporter called and asked her if she had signed her name
to $9,000 worth of vouchers for Abernathy.
</P>
<P>
   Panicked, Bradford said she hooked the recorder to her telephone
and called Abernathy. On the tape, he tells her the $9,000 amount
is impossible, because there is a $4,800 per-session cap on
legislative expenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty-seven hundred is not a lot of money,'' he told her,
aghast, ``but 9,000 is almost 10 grand!''
</P>
<P>
   ``All you have to say is that you received the money,'' he tells
her soothingly. ``I need you to say you received the money from
me?'' Bradford protested that she already had paid her income
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came to your house and I showed you what I signed for in
your name,'' he said. ``Why don't you just go ahead and ask your
CPA to file an amendment and I'll pay you for whatever it is.''
</P>
<P>
   On several occasions, he asked, ``What if I just brought you the
$2,700 now?''
</P>
<P>
   Bradford moaned repeatedly that she didn't want to get involved
in the problem and didn't want her name ``in the media.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to go to the mayor and let him know,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   After a brief silence, Abernathy said in a flat voice:
</P>
<P>
   ``Let him know what?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't want him blindsided,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to go to Bill, say, `Bill, they called and said I
received $9,000 from Ralph and I didn't receive $9,000. I received
about $2,000.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ralph, I don't want to lie now,'' Bradford said. ``I didn't
get the money and I don't want to lie and say I did . . . I don't
want to lie, Ralph.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you tell the truth, it's over,'' Abernathy said, his voice
alternately wheedling and badgering. ``It's going to be a great big
deal and your name is going to be spread all over the media in this
city.''

   Riverbeds, lake shores at record lows in Georgia
</P>
<P>
   By Charles Seabrook
</P>
<P>
   C. 1999 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The searing drought has left stretches of several
major rivers and lakes in Georgia at near record-low levels, and
state environmental officials are considering emergency water
restrictions for more than a dozen communities.
</P>
<P>
   Some stretches of the Flint River have barely enough water to
float a canoe. The flow in the Oconee River at Dublin in Middle
Georgia is only a fourth of what is typical for this time of year.
Several streams in South Georgia have dried up completely.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are approaching the conditions we had in the droughts of
1986 and 1988,'' said Nolton Johnson of the state Environmental
Protection Division. Those droughts were Georgia's worst dry spells
since records began at the beginning of the century.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, water levels on Lake Lanier and other reservoirs on
the Chattahoochee River continue to decline with no relief in
sight, says the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The corps is
projecting that Lanier's level will be1,060 above mean sea level by
the first week of October _ about six feet down from its normal
1,066-foot level for October.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boaters should be especially cautious as declining levels may
reduce clearance over underwater constructions,'' said corps
spokesman Patrick Robbins. ``Shallower water conditions could
expose rocks or stumps to those swimming or boating on the lakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Corps and state officials are expected to meet within the next
few days to determine if more water conservation measures should be
put in place for Lanier and other reservoirs. Those measures could
include storing more water in the reservoirs, and reducing the
amount that goes through the dams to generate electricity. A
certain amount has to be released from Lanier to dilute waste water
from sewage treatment plants downstream.
</P>
<P>
   The drought predictions for the state could change if powerful
Hurricane Floyd churning in the Atlantic and other tropical storms
dump a lot of rain on the state. Any relief, however, may be
temporary. ``September and October are usually our driest months of
the year,'' said Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Low water flow in the Tallapoosa River and its tributaries
already has prompted the EPD to issue emergency conservation
measures for Haralson County and the cities of Bremen and Welaska.
Haralson has issued a total ban on outdoor water use. Conditions
have also led the EPD to grant Bremen an emergency permit to tap a
special reservoir.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, sandbags were used to create a small reservoir in a
section of Tallapoosa to build a water supply for peak use in
Haralson County and Bremen.
</P>
<P>
   The EPD also is considering emergency water conservation
measures for more than a dozen other communities beset by low
stream flow. They include Clayton County, Fayette County, Forsyth
County and Heard County; and the cities of Griffin, Hogansville,
Manchester, Newnan, Roswell, Royston, Bent Tree, Dublin and
Greensboro.
</P>
<P>
   Lake Bennett, which is upstream from the city's drinking water
intake, has shrunk to a fraction of its normal size. The water
level in the lake and Whitewater Creek, which feeds it, dropped so
low the Fayetteville water system stopped pumping from the creek
last week and hooked on to the county's water system.
</P>
<P>
   In Dublin, the Oconee is at its lowest flow since records have
been kept. Normally, the flow would be about 1,600 cubic feet per
second (cfs) this time of year. Right now, however, the flow is
hovering around 400 cfs. The lowest one-day flow for the river at
Dublin on record is 428 cfs. One cfs is equal to about 7.4 gallons.
</P>
<P>
   Walton Smith, an Atlanta lawyer, said he canoed a stretch of the
Flint last weekend from Marshallville to Montezuma and found it
``very hazardous'' because of numerous uprooted trees and other
snags exposed by the low water.

13 NURSES IN OVERDOSE CASE TO RETRAIN, RECERTIFY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Thirteen nurses involved in a tragic 1994 chemotherapy
overdose episode involving two patients at Dana Farber Cancer
Institute have accepted formal reprimands from the state nursing
board and have agreed to undergo retraining or recertification.
</P>
<P>
   The board's disciplinary proceedings against the Dana Farber
nurses are controversial among nurses nationally. In Massachusetts,
the board's action against the chemotherapy nurses has become
linked with its proposed new regulations that, many nurses feel,
make them more vulnerable to shortcomings that are more
institutional than individual.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm relieved that the Board of Registration in Nursing has
decided that the appropriate response for the Dana Farber nurses is
retraining, not some more severe action,'' said Judith
Shindul-Rothschild, a Boston College nursing professor. ``Still,
the proposed new regulations present grave problems around holding
individual nurses accountable for systems failures.''
</P>
<P>
   The nursing board's reprimand of 13 Dana Farber nurses is the
latest in a four-year series of official actions and reactions to
the Dana Farber overdoses, which led to the death of Boston Globe
health columnist Betsy A. Lehman, 39, and disabling heart damage in
a North Andover woman, Maureen Bateman, 53. Bateman subsequently
died of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether the nursing board cited 18 Dana Farber nurses
involved in the overdoses.
</P>
<P>
   Three other nurses involved in the overdoses have refused to
accept any sanctions from the state board. A disciplinary hearing
on their cases is scheduled for Oct. 6. Last December, two other
Dana Farber nurses accepted a year's probation to avoid formal
charges and a full-scale hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 13 nurses who recently accepted a reprimand and
retraining requirement, four administered the improper doses, seven
monitored the chemotherapy as it was being delivered, and two
signed off on the erroneous medication order.
</P>
<P>
   Written by a physician-trainee, Dr. James Foran, the order
mistakenly called for four times the intended dose of a highly
toxic cancer drug called cyclophosphamide. The Massachusetts
medical licensure board subsequently suspended Foran's license
retroactively _ an action with no immediate practical effect, since
the suspension period had expired by the time the board acted.
</P>
<P>
   The state pharmacy board in 1997 formally reprimanded three Dana
Farber pharmacists for their role in the overdoses.
</P>
<P>
   The state's action against the nurses alone has sparked
controversy. Dana Farber officials have consistently said the
nurses were not culpable because the hospital did not require
nurses in 1994 to check physicians' chemotherapy orders against
written ``protocols,'' the documents which spell out the conduct of
experimental chemotherapy. In 1995, after the overdoses became
public, the hospital did institute such a requirement.
</P>
<P>
   A 1995 investigation by the state Department of Public Health
did not find fault with individual nurses, but it did call the
nursing board's attention to issues involving nurses' role in
administering experimental chemotherapy, which involves unusual
risk to patients.
</P>
<P>
   The state Board of Registration in Nursing, which licenses
nurses, maintains that proper nursing standards require nurses to
verify correct medication doses even if the institution they work
for does not require it.
</P>
<P>
   An important issue in the case involved the lengths to which
nurses should go to double-check doses. The wording of the recent
consent agreements makes clear that the nursing board expected the
nurses to ``verify the. . .dose with the entire written protocol.''
This presumably will be the board's position in the upcoming
hearings against the remaining three nurses.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Frank E. Reardon, who represents all 18 nurses in the
case, said Monday that the nurses ``did verify against the
appropriate records available to them,'' not ``the entire
protocol.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All the nurses feel they complied with both the hospital's
policy and with the board's policy on the verification of
medication orders,'' Reardon said.
</P>
<P>
   To many authorities in nursing and the growing field of medical
error-prevention, the case of the Dana Farber nurses goes to the
heart of a growing dilemma: How to apportion blame or
accountability between individual licensed professionals and the
institutions or ``systems'' in which they work.
</P>
<P>
   ``This case represents the whole difficulty nurses face right
now with being accountable for their practice within systems that
are setting them up for errors,'' said Diana Mason, editor of the
American Journal of Nursing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nurses are working under almost battlefield conditions these
days,'' Mason said. ``Given the loads they're carrying, it's very
easy when errors are made _ and they will be made _ to want to
blame an individual nurse rather than looking at the system.''
</P>
<P>
   But while Mason is sympathetic to the Dana Farber nurses, she
also supports the nursing board's decision to commence disciplinary
proceedings against them _ a stand unpopular among many nurses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the state board for nursing had to review the
nurses,'' Mason said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the nurses and the hospital should be held accountable
for having a policy that violated standards of practice for
nurses,'' Mason said. ``If they weren't required to do a check,
that should have signaled something to the nurses that something
was wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Mason editorialized in March that nurses ``should never accept
an institutional policy that removes them from adequately checking
medications they will be administering.'' That generated a reply in
the current issue of the American Journal of Nursing from Susan M.
Grant, chief of nursing and patient care services at Dana Farber.
</P>
<P>
   Grant wrote that the Dana Farber nurses relied on what they
thought was correct information when they failed to question the
four-fold overdoses they administered to Lehman and Bateman.
</P>
<P>
   The nurses who recently settled their cases with the nursing
board are: Shelly H. Autor, Mary Edson Cowell, Heidi L. DiPetro,
Nancy M. Hopkins, Donna Joseph, Rolf. W. Ludwig, Kelly McNeill,
Christin O'Brien, Karen Anne Poreda, Sheila B. Rozanski, Leslie Rae
Spencer, Maria Minks Wadsworth, and Robyn V. Woodward.
</P>
<P>
   Cases are still pending against Susan Aikey, Ilene A. Galinsky,
and Maura A. Murray.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When Gov. George W. Bush of Texas first hit the
presidential campaign trail in June, he wore monogrammed cowboy
boots, the perfect accessory for his folksy affability and casual
self-assurance.
</P>
<P>
   But when he visited New Hampshire early last week, he was shod
in a pair of conservative, shiny black loafers that seemed to
reflect more than the pant cuffs above them. They suggested an
impulse by Bush to put at least a bit of a damper on his brash
irreverence, which has been a potent magnet for affection but is a
less certain invitation for respect.
</P>
<P>
   As Bush presses forward with his almost preposterously charmed
quest for the Republican presidential nomination, he has plenty of
confidence, evident in his easy swagger. He has more than enough
money _ about $50 million and counting, an unprecedented,
calculator-boggling sum. And he has a wave of early support in
polls that looks tidal.
</P>
<P>
   But what political analysts, some of Bush's advisers and Bush
himself say he must still do is prove to voters, many of whom will
begin to take a closer look at candidates in the coming months,
that he has the maturity, poise and sheer heft to lead a nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a huge step,'' said Bush, who had never held elective
office before 1995, in an interview in New Hampshire last week.
``And in all of my speeches, I say it's a big step.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big step,'' he repeated, stressing his understanding of
the point and perhaps trying to project the kind of humility that
has not been considered one of his trademarks. ``And I know it's a
big step. I think the real question, though, and the important
question that the American people are going to look at and answer
is: Is the person prepared? You know, more importantly: Is the
person prepared to make the big decisions for America? That's the
big stage. And that's the fundamental question _ of trust.''
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to answer all of that in the affirmative, Bush
recently began what might be called the substance phase of his
campaign. Nearly two weeks ago he delivered an education address in
Los Angeles; on Wednesday he is scheduled to sketch out some of his
plans for national defense at the Citadel in Charleston, S.C. Other
policy speeches will follow at roughly two-week intervals.
</P>
<P>
   At several appearances in New Hampshire last week, Bush invited
audiences to throw questions at him, a process obviously intended
to counter impressions that he has been fuzzy and evasive and to
show voters _ and the many reporters in tow _ that he could think
on his feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``To close the sale,'' said one adviser, ``he needs to
demonstrate that he has the grasp and depth and breadth _ that he
is not simply a popular man who has caught the wave.''
</P>
<P>
   But there have been a few missteps that have underscored how
unfamiliar Bush is with the intensity of the scrutiny he is now
under, despite his lineage and proximity to his father's various
national campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Most political analysts agree that Bush faltered when, after
saying he would not indulge specific questions about whether he had
used illegal drugs as a younger man, he began playing a numbers
game about how many years into the past he could certify himself as
drug-free.
</P>
<P>
   On a much less serious level, he was caught flat-footed when,
during a visit to an elementary school in Florence, S.C., three
weeks ago, a student asked him what his favorite book was in his
childhood, and he could not name one. Bush has made educating young
children a top priority. Literacy was the issue held dear by his
mother, former first lady Barbara Bush, and it is the mission of
his wife, Laura Bush, too.
</P>
<P>
   Then, last week, when bad weather delayed Bush's flight from New
Hampshire to Rhode Island, he arrived in Providence well after his
visit to an elementary school was scheduled to take place, and
headed to a fund-raiser that was just beginning.
</P>
<P>
   Advisers explained that Bush was simply trying to stay on
schedule and that the schoolchildren had already gone to lunch. But
the decision opened the door for Vice President Al Gore, the
front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination, to make
his own journey to the school, where he told students exactly which
book _ ``Mr. Popper's Penguins'' _ he had favored as a child.
</P>
<P>
   ``Running for president is a unique experience,'' said Bob
Teeter, a Republican pollster, adding that it is rare for someone
so new to the race to emerge as far ahead of the pack as Bush has.
``People don't know how hard it is _ how constant, how persistent.
And he hasn't been through it yet.''
</P>
<P>
   But for the most part, Teeter said, Bush has handled himself
well. ``All the indications are good,'' Teeter said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's advisers said that the way Bush manages the awkward,
embarrassing and tense moments that are inevitable in a
presidential campaign will be a signal to voters of whether he is
ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a crucible, it is a gantlet, and part of what people
want to see is how you handle it,'' said Mark McKinnon, Bush's
media consultant. ``That's something people look for in a
president.''
</P>
<P>
   To that end, Bush seems to be striking a careful balance between
the flip, saucy playfulness that comes naturally to him _ and lends
him his distinctive charm _ and a more watchful, dignified
demeanor.
</P>
<P>
   He still gives vent to his insouciant side. ``Some people say
that I proved that if you get a C average, you can end up being
successful in life,'' he said with a smile last week when he was
asked, by a child at an elementary school in Bedford, N.H., whether
he had been a good student.
</P>
<P>
   He still immediately assigns nicknames to the people he meets _
his own quirky way of trying to topple the barriers of formality
between him and anyone in his orbit.
</P>
<P>
   But when two reporters who regularly follow him on the campaign
trail recently joked that they were around each other so much that
they had begun sleeping together, Bush made an exaggerated gesture
of clamping his mouth shut and banishing any discernible expression
of emotion from his face.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not supposed to react to that,'' he told them in a
deliberately robotic tone.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, as he rumbled through southern New Hampshire in a
small Winnebago, Bush said, ``Part of my treating somebody as a
human being is I like to needle them and tease them at times, and
there was a moment when I just, I just, you know, probably
withdrew, because I didn't want somebody to misconstrue what I was
saying.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still a pretty lighthearted fellow,'' Bush added. ``But I
understand that this is a serious business we're talking about. And
I understand the gravity.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that he also understands _ or, at least, constantly
tells himself _ that today's good political fortune could dissipate
tomorrow.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Asked if there were chapters from political history that he
summoned to remind himself of this, Bush said, ``Let's start with
1992,'' referring to year his father, President George Bush,
watched his poll numbers tumble and lost the White House to Bill
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a miserable year, when I watched a great man, a man I
love more than life _ you know, one of the really fundamentally
solid, decent people _ go from 92 to 38 in a very quick period of
time,'' Bush said of his father's standing in the polls. ``History
is full of reversals of political fortunes, and I know that.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he was determined to show that he was working as hard
as, or harder than, his Republican rivals to make his case to
voters; Bush's advisers trumpet the fact that unlike some of his
challengers, Bush must spend a significant amount of time in many
locations _ in New Hampshire and South Carolina and Iowa _ lest he
be accused of taking victory for granted and coasting to the
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm expected to be in all states, and I will be,'' Bush said.
``Some candidates can pick and choose where they campaign and where
they put resources, time and effort, and I'm expected to be in all
of them.''
</P>
<P>
   That very gentle swipe at his Republican opponents is about as
combative as Bush gets toward them. In speeches, Bush zings
Clinton, saying that the Oval Office should not be a mirror for
public opinion, and he zings Gore, saying that Democrats no more
invented prosperity than they invented the Internet. (The gibe
refers to Gore's comment in March that he ``took the initiative in
creating the Internet.'')
</P>
<P>
   But Bush does not take aim at anyone else in the crowded field
of Republican contenders, which at times suggests that he is
already gazing beyond the primaries to November 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not looking ahead,'' Bush said. ``I promise you that. I am
focused on getting the nomination.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, he or any other nominee would be badly hurt in the
general election if the Republican Party fractured along the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope to be in a position, should I earn the nomination, to
bring our party together, to consolidate our party rapidly so that
I can then go out and do what I need to do, which is to go out and
attract independent and discerning Democratic voters.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, one of the most striking elements of Bush's oratory _
and of his campaign schedule up to this point _ is its studious
inclusiveness, its insistence on reaching out to voters not
typically in the Republican fold.
</P>
<P>
   He has visited many social programs and schools with largely
minority populations. When he talks about the value of religious
institutions in widening the social safety net, he does not simply
mention churches _ he invariably invokes synagogues and mosques as
well.
</P>
<P>
   The task now, his advisers acknowledge, is to demonstrate for
voters that there is something real behind those words, actual
visions and prescriptives for what the federal government should
and should not do.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the beginning of a process, and while we've had great
success so far, there's a lot to be done,'' said Karl Rove, the
campaign's principal strategist.
</P>
<P>
   Among the works in progress, political analysts said, is Bush
himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a whole series of things that he has to
project to ratify what for most Republicans has become an
instinctive ballot choice, and that's everything from a grasp of
foreign policy to a sense of what kind of people he'd appoint to
Cabinet posts,'' said Peter Roff, the former political director for
Gopac, a Republican fund-raising and strategizing group.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said that this is exactly what he is trying to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happens in a campaign is there are moments, there are
different ways for candidates to assure people, to earn the
trust,'' he said. ``I'm earning the trust.''

GRAYING OF NEW ENGLAND SKIERS SHOWN IN STUDY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ELLEN BARRY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Skiing, the sport once associated with bums and
bunnies, is turning gray fast in New England, a tourism consultant
and researcher told a meeting of regional ski industry leaders last
week.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1994 and 1998, the average age of skiers in New England
rose from 36.2 to 40.6, while the nationwide average rose more
slowly, from 37.6 to 38.7, according to pollster Bill Siegel's
company, Longwoods International. Meanwhile, during a period when
overnight travel grew by 22 percent, overnight ski trips in New
England grew by 11 percent _ less than half as fast as the ski
trips nationally, Siegel said.
</P>
<P>
   In the Mount Attitash lodge in Bartlett, N.H., where Siegel
delivered his news to 150 members of the New England Ski Industry
Summit, some listeners shrugged off the numbers, which don't
account for the day trippers, who are typically younger and less
affluent. Others looked at the bright side, congratulating
themselves on keeping skiers in the sport longer, with features
like Attitash's ``Thank Goodness I'm 50'' promotion.
</P>
<P>
   But Siegel, who puts out an annual breakdown of Americans'
leisure, said he had been shocked by the rapid aging on New
England's slopes. During the five-year period his survey followed,
the number of 18- to 24-year-olds who went on ski trips dropped by
5 percent, and the 25- to 34-year-olds dropped by 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I can do is throw the red flag up,'' he said. ``But I
think the industry had better jump on this one, because it looks
like a significant trend.''
</P>
<P>
   The Longwoods survey showed that the ski vacation is
increasingly a carriage trade, in which typical enthusiasts have an
average age of 38.7 and earn a salary upwards of $70,000.
Meanwhile, the number of ski vacationers who earn less than $25,000
dropped precipitously, from 13 percent to 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   While this upscaling trend is good news for resorts branching
into real estate, the long view could spell trouble, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of them may not have wanted to hear what I was saying,''
he said, emphasizing that if young people stop skiing, the sport
could go downhill fast.
</P>
<P>
   Siegel's presentation started a buzz at the Summit, but his
audience dispersed to their respective mountains without a sense of
panic. Greg Sweetser, executive director of the Ski Maine
Association, which commissioned Siegel's talk, prefers what he
calls the ``glass-half-full theory.''
</P>
<P>
   From his own perspective overseeing 16 ski areas in Maine,
Sweetser has drawn very different conclusions. The 55-and-up skiing
population _ which rose from 8 percent in 1994 to 21 percent in
1998, according to Siegel's results _ typically vacations longer
and spends more than their younger counterparts for a product that
has improved vastly in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   And without calculating day trips, ``I'm not sure we aren't
replacing the skiers on the other side,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Alice Pearce, the executive director of Ski New Hampshire,
said she is aware of the intangible buzz that made windsurfing hot
in the 1980s and snowboarding hot in the 1990s, and worries that
skiing has lost its sizzle. Pearce herself learned to ski under the
luminous influence of Jean-Claude Killy and Suzy Parker, and
transferred her affection in the 1990s to the Olympian brothers
Phil and Steve Mahre.
</P>
<P>
   But as ski promoters learned when snowboarding hit the industry
in 1995, even the best marketers have a tenuous control of fashion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you control what sport is going to be hot next? No, not at
all,'' she said. ``The opinion-makers say pogo-sticking is going to
be cool, and then the pogo stickers get access to media, and the
18- to 24-year-olds take up pogo sticking, and the high-schoolers
emulate the 18- to 24-year-olds, and the elementary schoolers
emulate the high schoolers.''
</P>
<P>
   With an increase nationwide of 26 percent, the ski trip was the
fourth fastest-growing form of vacation, after casino vacations,
which increased by 48 percent, and cruises, which increased by 30
percent. And despite the Northeast aging statistics that surprised
Siegel, skiing is in much better shape than, say, the group bus
tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their problem is a demographic one that is more severe,''
Siegel said. ``The person who would take a group bus tour is
basically a widow, a 70-plus widow. When you have a situation like
this, it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, because the kids
aren't going to be caught dead doing something for old people.''

WHO ARE THESE GUYS, ANYWAY? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ The dogs are barking, and this baseball caravan is
moving on. And wherever the Boston Red Sox go, people ask the same
questions.
</P>
<P>
   What's with that lineup? Where is the power? What's a Trot? Is
Jimy Williams for real? What did he do with that other ``m''? What
exactly is going on here?
</P>
<P>
   There is one great pitcher and one great everyday player. It is
possible _ not necessarily likely, but entirely possible _ that
they will become the first team to enter postseason play with just
one pitcher posting 10 or more wins.
</P>
<P>
   On paper, the lineup Mike Hargrove will put on the field in this
three-game series should laugh at anything Williams answers with.
Jim Thome or Mike Stanley at first? Roberto Alomar or Jose Offerman
at second? David Justice or Trot Nixon in right? Kenny Lofton or
Darren Lewis in center? Harold Baines or Reggie Jefferson at DH?
These aren't difficult decisions to make. I mean, gee, Manny
Ramirez (target of many HBPs of late) and his 144 ribbies weren't
even in it, and you still had to like their lineup a whole lot
better than Boston's. They might even say that while Nomar
Garciaparra is a pretty nice player, we're quite happy with Omar
Vizquel, Mr. Gold Glove himself, at short.
</P>
<P>
   But all of this firepower made the Indians only 6 1/2 games
better than the Red Sox over the season's first 143 games. That's
really not much over 23 weeks. So what the Red Sox are doing with a
lot of non-marqueee players proves, um, proves, um, proves, well,
what exactly?
</P>
<P>
   ``That we have a situation in which a couple of guys don't have
to carry the team,'' suggests Stanley. ``Aside from the pitching,
which has been phenomenal, the story of this team has been the
contributions of various people throughout the lineup. But coming
into spring training, we knew that was the way it would have to
be.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say we're a National League-type team,'' observes Rod
Beck, who jumped onto this moving train via a bizarre save against
Kansas City back on Sept. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not out there slugging a lot of home runs,'' Beck says.
``But we have a lot of guys hitting .270 and we have a lot of
interchangeable parts. Dusty Baker always said, `Give me a lineup
of .270 hitters and I'll win.' I think that's a truism.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox do a little bit of biceps-flexing every once in a
while (e.g. five homers Saturday in Yankee Stadium), but Home Run
Derby is not their thing. Suppose, for example, that someone had
told you in 1959, 1969, 1979, 1989, or even this past Opening Day
that the Red Sox would some day hit zero home runs in a seven-game
homestand but still go 6-1. You would have dismissed it as some
sort of Jules Verne/George Orwell fantasy. But that's exactly what
happened when this team played Anaheim and Kansas City from Aug.
27-Sept. 2.
</P>
<P>
   They play minimalist baseball, and that seems to fit the
temperament of their oddly minimalist manager. Deep into the third
year of his tenure as Red sox manager, Williams relentlessly
preaches the value of a pitch-by-pitch approach to the game. He
never seems to see or care about the broad arc of anything. He
leaves all the fancy talk, all the historical implications, and all
the what-ifs to the fans and the media. He has a set of built-in
blinders that shield him from situations and controversies that
might distract others in his position.
</P>
<P>
   If Williams had Ramirez or Alomar, he'd happily play them. He
doesn't. So he plays Trot Nixon and Offerman and never asks them to
be anyone but themselves. There's a skill in that.
</P>
<P>
   Darren Lewis may be the quintessential Williams player. He went
into Monday night's game hitting .251, and by every normal measure
you would say he is in a slump (8 for 54). But his batting average
is irrelevant. He is a superb center fielder, and he was batting
second because, 8 for 54 or no 8 for 54, he always has value. He is
the best bunter on the team, as the Yankees found out over the
weekend when Lewis got down four successful sacrifices.
</P>
<P>
   ``He certainly does some things with that bat,'' acknowledges
Williams. ``Hit-and-run, advancing runners. I put the (hit-and-run)
sign on for him twice in one at-bat the other day. Bunting, he's
gotten some big ones down for us. No hesitation. No doubt. He gets
it done.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd tell you they don't pay him to drive in runs,'' adds
Stanley. ``They pay him to play defense and do all those other
things. He does not get caught up in his own numbers. He's out
there to help the team, and that's what it takes to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with a Pedro Martinez on the mound, the 1999 Red Sox
routinely play the role of David to the Goliaths in New York,
Cleveland, and Arlington. You can easily understand why a Jimy
Williams, while never expressing the sentiment publicly, gets a
special glow watching his ``kids,'' as he calls them, win games the
old-fashioned John McGraw way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just love watching them play,'' he says. ``I really enjoy
watching them play. You can come into every game they play, and if
there were no scoreboard, you could never tell if they were winning
or losing, because they play the same way all the time. They may
have bad days, but they never let their guard down. Every day, they
go to the last pitch, the last swing, the last out. They're still
right there.''
</P>
<P>
   You would still trade the Red Sox lineup for the New York
lineup, the Cleveland lineup, the Texas lineup, and maybe some
other lineups. But we're very close to the end and the Red Sox are
still, yes, right there.

 &HT;    School flagpoles become prayer sites this week
 &HT;    By Gayle White
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Millions of students will be getting to school early
on Wednesday to stand around outside and talk. To God.
</P>
<P>
   It's the day of See You at the Pole, an annual gathering of
Christian teenagers around school flagpoles for prayer. Three
million students around the world participated last year, mostly in
the United States. This year, in the wake of highly publicized
cases of school violence, organizers are expecting more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything that happened last year has fueled a movement among
kids to seek answers in life,'' said Mike Crandall, metro Atlanta
director of Student Venture, the high school division of Campus
Crusade for Christ. ``I think there's a great hunger now for God
among kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Also this year, the Alpharetta, Ga.-based North American Mission
Board of the Southern Baptist Convention is encouraging parents and
other adults to gather Tuesday night for their own organized prayer
for the schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``Combined with See You at the Pole, this effort will get the
entire church praying that God will make a difference in the
campuses of our land,'' said board President Robert Reccord.
</P>
<P>
   Some adult groups will meet in churches; others will conduct
``prayer walks'' around their children's schools. North American
Mission Board spokesman Martin King said parents are asked to
notify school administrators of any intention to be on campus, and
to remain on public streets and sidewalks if there is any
objection.
</P>
<P>
   ``Access is not the issue,'' King said. ``Prayer is the issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Youth ministry leaders say most metro Atlanta communities will
be participating to some degree.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you'd be hard-pressed to find a school in metro
Atlanta where some kids did not gather to pray this Wednesday,''
said Wes Cantrell, an organizer in First Priority, a group of youth
ministers of different Christian denominations. First Priority has
about 19 ``networks'' in communities representing about 110 high
schools and middle schools in metro Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   See You at the Pole began in 1990 with the prayer activities of
a Southern Baptist church youth group in the Fort Worth suburb of
Burleson, Texas. The idea spread across Texas, across the United
States and now into more than 20 other countries.
</P>
<P>
   The event is legal because it is student-organized and
student-led on a school-by-school basis, organizers say.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do think it's inappropropriate for students to be doing
this, but there's not a lot you can do about it,'' said Annie
Laurie Gaylor, editor of Free Thought Today, the newspaper of the
Freedom From Religion Foundation, based in Madison, Wis. The
foundation is an organization of atheists and agnostics that fights
what it considers inappropriate public expressions of religion.
</P>
<P>
   For many students, See You at the Pole is only a highly visible
version of an activity they engage in weekly or daily.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 students at Heritage High School in Rockdale
County are expected to pray before school on Wednesday. But the
only difference between Wednesday and any other day at Heritage is
that they'll be outside instead of inside.
</P>
<P>
   Every day a group called the Fellowship of Christian Youth meets
half an hour before school begins, sometimes drawing as many as 90
students.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing I can tell you is we're making a commitment
every day to learn and grow and to take time out of the day to
worship,'' said James Shaw, 16, one of the worship leaders.
</P>
<P>
   In general, Shaw said, Heritage students are accepting of their
peers who particpate. ``We do have a few kids who will be negative
about anything religious,'' he said. Those students refer to the
classroom where the Christian youth gather as the ``clappy-clappy
room,'' he said, because of the peppy guitar music and singing that
pours into the hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time I walked through those doors, I was scared,''
said Shaw, now a junior. ``People don't know what to expect. It's
hard to pull people in there.''
</P>
<P>
   More people will come to prayer around the flagpole because they
can walk up, pray for a minute, and then leave, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Six students were injured in a shooting at Heritage on May 20.
Fellow student Anthony ``T.J.'' Solomon is charged with several
felonies in the incident. Shaw said the number of participants in
the Fellowship of Christian Youth has increased some since the
shooting. ``I'm impressed with the number of freshmen,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he is also hearing from friends at the county's Salem
and Rockdale high schools that more youth are attending Christian
activities there.
</P>
<P>
   Crandall said he sees a similar trend toward increased
participation and Christian ``activism.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not anything anybody's doing,'' he said. ``It's something
God's doing. The kids are responding.''

FEARS GROW AS NEW BLAST LEVELS APARTMENT BLOCK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV AND BRIAN WHITMORE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ President Boris N. Yeltsin ordered security tightened
in cities across Russia Monday after the second deadly blast in
four days rocked the Russian capital, flattening an apartment
building, killing at least 73 people and trapping possibly dozens
more.
</P>
<P>
   Officials pressed for a crackdown against ``foreigners'' after
the predawn explosion in southern Moscow, which Russian security
officials quickly termed a terrorist act.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's blast put a gruesome twist on what had been declared a
national day of mourning for the victims of Thursday's explosion,
also in an apartment building, which killed 94 people. No one has
claimed responsibility for either explosion, and that has only made
the fear worse for stunned Muscovites.
</P>
<P>
   The two bombings are the deadliest in Moscow since World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``This means you can never sleep in peace, you cannot know what
they will hit next,'' said Misha, a resident of a building next
door to the 9-story tenement flattened by Monday's blast, as he
watched rescue workers desperately search for survivors in the
smoldering and tangled ruins.
</P>
<P>
   Rescue workers held out little hope for survivors in the rubble
of the building, which housed more than 125 people. Police said
they hoped many residents were away at country cottages when the
blast struck.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin ordered tight security at airports, nuclear power
stations and other possible targets in Moscow. He said the country
faced a major terrorist threat, but did not say who or what was
behind the threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Terrorism has declared war on the Russian people,'' he said in
an address on Russian television. The best response, he said,
``will be your vigilance and calm.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin gave Moscow police 24 hours to check airports, railway
stations, cellars and attics across the capital. Quick to comply,
police began searches of apartments and set up checkpoints around
the city.
</P>
<P>
   The second explosion in less than a week fueled rumours the
Kremlin was about to introduce a state of emergency in Moscow and
other parts of Russia, a move that would cast into doubt the
parliamentary election.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow's police chief, Nikolai Kulikov, appealed for help in
finding a man he said could be linked to Monday's explosion and the
blast last week. Officials and analysts said they believed both of
the apartment explosions, as well as a recent blast at a shopping
mall and a car bomb in southern Russia last weeek that killed 54,
were linked to federal troops battling against Islamic militants in
the southern Russian region of Dagestan.
</P>
<P>
   The Interfax news agency reported that two unidentified suspects
have been detained in connection with Monday's blast. No further
details were available.
</P>
<P>
   Residents who lived in neighboring apartment buildings watched
through shattered windows as rescue workers carried the bodies of
victims away from the charred rubble and twisted metal. Books and
clothes lay scattered on the ground and hung in branches of nearby
trees.
</P>
<P>
   Friends and family members rushed to the square behind the
ruined building where the bodies were laid out. Some people,
desperately trying to find a missing relative or loved one, tore at
the plastic sheets that covered the victims as rescue workers tried
to fend them off.
</P>
<P>
   Other survivors cried openly, shaking from shock and grief as a
young policeman read out descriptions of those who had just been
found. Still more stunned neighbors stood in the cold drizzle,
staring at the white smoke billowing from the mound of rubble,
watching as trucks hauled away rubble.
</P>
<P>
   Hours after the blast, police cleared people from three adjacent
buildings after reports that explosives had been found in them,
although the reports turned out to be false.
</P>
<P>
   For bystanders, survivors and the bereaved alike, the common
denominator was fear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am scared for my child, I take her to school and don't know
whether she will come home,'' said Nadezhda Narkova, 45, who passed
the scene of the blast on her way to shop.
</P>
<P>
   Leading officials blamed Islamic militants from Russia's
breakaway region of Chechnya, where Moscow fought a disastrous war
against separatists from 1994 to 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Chechen-backed Islamic militants are now fighting Moscow's
forces in Dagestan, a Russian region next to Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Interior Minister Vladimir Rushailo specifically named Chechen
rebel commander Shamil Basayev and the Jordanian-born guerrilla
Khattab as the culprits.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened in Moscow was done by Khattab and Basayev and
their people. There is no doubt about it,'' Rushailo, leading the
investigation into the blasts, told NTV television.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the weekly newspaper Novaya Gazyeta reported, citing
unidentified sources, that a Chechen-led terrorist group _ composed
mostly of ethnic Slavs _ was behind the blasts.
</P>
<P>
   In a front page article titled ``We know who carried out this
bloody raid,'' journalist Vyacheslav Izmailov wrote that Khattab
and Basayev promised to pay participants in the bombing campaign up
to $50,000 each. He said the militants' plans called for seven more
bombing attacks in the capital.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday Basayev denied responsibility for last week's attack.
</P>
<P>
   In a televised address, Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov said he would
seek to deport undesirable elements from the capital and force all
non-Muscovites to re-register with the police within three days.
Anatoly Tyazhlov, governor of the region surrounding Moscow,
threatened to put anybody caught without a residency permit in a
detention camp, RIA Novosti reported.
</P>
<P>
   Several American residents of Moscow have been reported to the
police by their neighbors for looking ``suspicious.'' Some elite
downtown apartment complexes have also begun locking their outside
doors at night and requiring tenants to ring a doorbell to be
admitted to their own building. In one such building, a note to
tenants asks them to report any guests that may be visiting to the
doorman in advance and to be present when the guests arrive.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to normal police patrols, plainclothes officers
combed the Moscow subway checking the documents of anybody looking
suspicious _ which in Russia often means anyone with the dark
complexion of Caucasus natives.
</P>
<P>
   Some politicians have connected the bombings to battles among
political groups in the capital as national elections approach.
Monday's edition of the newspaper Moskovsky Komsomolets, which went
to press before the latest explosion, suggested that Russia's
security services may have been behind last week's explosion _ and
were preparing another one.
</P>
<P>
   Fueling one of Moscow's favorite rumors, the paper speculated
that the Kremlin was trying to provoke a crisis and use it as a
pretext for declaring emergency rule and cancelling elections.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Here are two of the ways Henry Galiano, the
self-trained paleontologist out of Spanish Harlem and owner of the
Maxilla and Mandible Ltd. natural history shop on the Upper West
Side, has driven his wife, Deborah, crazy:
</P>
<P>
   By wearing a T-shirt and not even combing his hair when one of
the many television news crews came to interview him last week; by
giving away so much stuff _ some of it very expensive stuff _ over
the years.
</P>
<P>
   It was one of those gifts, as a matter of fact, that prompted
the visits of the reporters: a fossilized skull, probably belonging
to the pre-human species Homo erectus, which strolled Africa and/or
Asia 1.8 million years ago. It turned up at Galiano's little shop
on Columbus Avenue, behind the American Museum of Natural History,
this past winter, in a box of geological curios and tribal masks.
Last week Galiano gave the fossil to Indonesia, the country of its
origin.
</P>
<P>
   Why give away a fossil some scientists think might have fetched
$500,000?
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, that figure is incorrect, it's total fantasy,''
says Galiano, 48, an easygoing guy in jeans and sneakers whom it's
easier to imagine watching a Knicks game than being co-author of a
paper on Phylogeny of Early Tertiary Carnivora. ``This piece is so
rare, you don't know what it would bring. It would be like selling
the Star of India.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once I found out what it was,'' he continued, ``I just had to
find a home for it, so it could be studied. It belongs in
Indonesia. It's a national treasure, that we think was somehow
spirited out. So after me and my buddies had a chance to study it,
we gave it back. They were so happy.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the pleasure of New York, that adjoining a store of
extravagantly priced linens, and across from a Starbucks, you can
find a shop dedicated to the treasures of the earth, many
reasonably priced, from a Papilio ulysses butterfly ($19) from New
Guinea to a lock of hair ($250) from the woolly mammoth, which
roamed the earth in the Ice Age.
</P>
<P>
   What's even more interesting than what is in the shop, is what
is not.
</P>
<P>
   Galiano, who at the peak of his business a few years ago was
grossing $1 million and who, after having been seriously ill last
year and reducing the business is now earning much less and is by
no means a rich man, has given away about 100 fossils and specimens
to institutes and museums over the years. A spokeswoman for the
Museum of Natural History, Holly Evarts, says Galiano has been ``a
huge supporter.''
</P>
<P>
   One of his gifts to the museum was a 50-million-year-old bat
fossil.
</P>
<P>
   How much did Galiano pay for that fossil?
</P>
<P>
   ``Not much. A few thousand, quite a few thousand. OK, I'll tell
you, $25,000,'' says Galiano, who, one can't help note, succumbs
quite quickly to a bit of bullying.
</P>
<P>
   Wow! That's a lot of money to give away!
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how my wife feels,'' Galiano says. ``I'm just so
passionate about museums and science. I make a living out of
natural history, I need to put back, to balance things out. I could
sell to a private collector, but I have to go to sleep at night,
and if I robbed paleontology of some important, critical
information about the evolution of bats and mammals, I'd feel I'd
done something wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Most paleontologists have years of formal training. Galiano,
raised on East 107th Street and Lexington, did not. His mother, who
was born in Puerto Rico, and his father, who was Cuban-Chinese, ran
Marida's Beauty Salon, in the neighborhood. His ``love affair'' _
this is what Galiano calls his relationship with the American
Museum of Natural History _ began when Galiano was a boy and his
father took him to see the dinosaurs. At 5, Galiano says, he could
tell you the proper name of a dinosaur, spell that name, and draw
the dinosaur. Later, he attended a number of colleges in New York,
taking courses in art and science, planning a career as a
commercial artist, but it did not happen. Sketching places,
buildings, people held no interest.
</P>
<P>
   At 21, with no college degree, Galiano worked for a year in the
department of vertebrate paleontology at the museum for no money.
The payback, he says, was being able to handle the fossils. Eleven
years on salary followed. Then Galiano went into business for
himself.
</P>
<P>
   There have been problems. A few years ago, the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service charged Galiano with interstate trafficking in
endangered wildlife, including the skulls of seven crocodiles and
an Asian elephant. Last year, he paid a $25,000 civil fine.
Discussing the case, Galiano is remarkably nondefensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, yeah, I call that the Big Extortion,'' he says. ``Those
specimens were all legally obtained, from animals that were bred in
captivity. I've never broken the law in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Galiano's role, as he sees it, is as a bridge between the
commercial and the scientific. He sees things that museums miss. He
passes them along.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being so young when I started, I kind of grew up at the Museum
of Natural History and learned from those guys how to respect
natural history and specimens. They taught me everything
surrounding science is based on a reality, a specimen; those
specimens are the facts. You can argue about them, you can
hypothesize all you want, but these objects are real. They're the
proof of our evolution, our history, and to me that history is more
precious than man-made things.''

 &HT;    Report of Atlanta Olympics spending excesses due
 &HT;    (EDS: Moving in (w) Washington and (s) Sports categories.)By
Melissa Turner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Sex, lies and scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   With the national media piling on, the Atlanta Olympic bid story
is quickly deteriorating into a titillating scandal just as former
Attorney General Griffin Bell finalizes his report on the Olympic
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Sensational talk about secret dossiers from the secret files of
Atlanta's Olympic committee that detail which International Olympic
Committee members can be bought, and which prefer to be paid with
women worked its way into national news outlets over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   That's the backdrop against which Bell must now spin his
sobering account of the excesses in the Atlanta campaign to win the
1996 Olympic Games. Bell's report could arrive at the U.S. House
Commerce Committee's door today.
</P>
<P>
   Bell's team of Washington-based lawyers have been working for
more than a month to revise an earlier report to Congress, authored
by Olympic bid chairmen Billy Payne and Andrew Young.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional investigators pointed out discrepancies between
Payne's and Young's June 1 account and documents in some three
dozens boxes of bid records. Bell, a former federal judge, stepped
in to restore credibility at the defense table.
</P>
<P>
   After taking a look at the material in the boxes, Bell, a
leading attorney with the Olympic law firm King &AMP; Spalding,
acknowledged the first report was inaccurate and incomplete. And he
promised to put out a complete story quickly, presumably including
as much as $92,000 in unreported gifts, according to a
congressional staffer.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators found a $425 shotgun purchased for the head of a
national Olympic committee and a $1,000 pine bowl presented to
Matts Carlgren of Sweden from his Atlanta host and hostess, Mack
and Mary Rose Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch himself, was presented with
$8,000 in framed limited edition Olympic posters.
</P>
<P>
   Bell also will acknowledge the Atlanta bid team's aggressive
effort to gather intelligence and compile dossiers on IOC members
and their vulnerabilities in his report. A spokesman for the bid
committee likens the dossiers to ``conducting research'' for a
start-up business.

 &HT;    Report of Atlanta Olympics spending excesses due
 &HT;    (EDS: Moving in (w) Washington and (s) Sports categories.)By

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Sex, lies and scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   With the national media piling on, the Atlanta Olympic bid story
is quickly deteriorating into a titillating scandal just as former
Attorney General Griffin Bell finalizes his report on the Olympic
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Sensational talk about secret dossiers from the secret files of
Atlanta's Olympic committee that detail which International Olympic
Committee members can be bought, and which prefer to be paid with
women worked its way into national news outlets over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   That's the backdrop against which Bell must now spin his
sobering account of the excesses in the Atlanta campaign to win the
1996 Olympic Games. Bell's report could arrive at the U.S. House
Commerce Committee's door today.
</P>
<P>
   Bell's team of Washington-based lawyers have been working for
more than a month to revise an earlier report to Congress, authored
by Olympic bid chairmen Billy Payne and Andrew Young.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional investigators pointed out discrepancies between
Payne's and Young's June 1 account and documents in some three
dozens boxes of bid records. Bell, a former federal judge, stepped
in to restore credibility at the defense table.
</P>
<P>
   After taking a look at the material in the boxes, Bell, a
leading attorney with the Olympic law firm King &AMP; Spalding,
acknowledged the first report was inaccurate and incomplete. And he
promised to put out a complete story quickly, presumably including
as much as $92,000 in unreported gifts, according to a
congressional staffer.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators found a $425 shotgun purchased for the head of a
national Olympic committee and a $1,000 pine bowl presented to
Matts Carlgren of Sweden from his Atlanta host and hostess, Mack
and Mary Rose Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch himself, was presented with
$8,000 in framed limited edition Olympic posters.
</P>
<P>
   Bell also will acknowledge the Atlanta bid team's aggressive
effort to gather intelligence and compile dossiers on IOC members
and their vulnerabilities in his report. A spokesman for the bid
committee likens the dossiers to ``conducting research'' for a
start-up business.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ A cloak of fear descended on Russia's capital Monday as
the second major explosion in four days demolished an apartment
building, killing at least 73 people as they slept.
</P>
<P>
   While no group claimed responsibility for the 5 a.m. blast,
Russian authorities insisted it was the work of Islamic militants
who had taken their war in the Caucasus to Russia's capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``Terrorism has declared war on the Russian people,'' President
Boris Yeltsin said in a nationally televised address.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to reassure anxious residents, Yeltsin ordered tightened
security at airports, nuclear power stations and other possible
targets.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities vowed to check each of Moscow's 33,000 apartment
buildings, especially the storerooms and shops that are often
located on ground floors and in basements.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Yuri Luzhkov announced that all visitors to Moscow would
have to submit to questioning and obtain new residency permits
within the next three days, a decree widely interpreted as directed
against people from the Caucasus, who are often treated with
suspicion by the authorities here.
</P>
<P>
   These measures, however, provided little comfort to the many
Muscovites who live in unguarded and poorly constructed flats _ and
who doubt the government's ability to protect them. Their sense of
vulnerability has mounted in the past month since fighting broke
out in the southern Russian republic of Dagestan, when thousands of
Islamic militants moved from Chechnya into Dagestan and vowed to
turn the Russian republic into an Islamic state.
</P>
<P>
   Natalya S. Saley, a psychotherapist who was counseling residents
near the blast site Monday, said Muscovites feel a new sense of
vulnerability.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people,'' Ms. Saley said, ``are simply afraid to go
back home.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday morning's explosion was an especially rude shock because
Moscow had been largely exempt from terrorism. Russians face many
hardships, but this is still a city in which random violence
against defenseless citizens had been rare. Then a mysterious blast
occurred late last month at the up-scale Manezh shopping center
near the Kremlin, killing one person and injuring about 40 more. It
was followed by an enormous explosion on Thursday, which leveled an
apartment complex in southern Moscow and killed 94.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, in fact, was supposed to have been a somber day of
mourning for the victims of the Thursday bombing _ and for 64
people killed at yet another blast earlier this month at an
apartment complex in Dagestan for Russian officers in their
families.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Muscovites awoke to wailing sirens and feverish rumors
about who might have been responsible for the blast and why.
</P>
<P>
   Vyacheslav Izmailov, an expert on Chechnya for the newspaper
Novaya Gazeta and a retired military officer, stoked the public's
anxiety by declaring that an informant had had alerted him that
Moscow would be the target of more terrorist attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The bombings, he said, had been organized by Islamic militants
and set by a band of Chechen, Russian and Ukrainian mercenaries.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after Monday's bombing, authorities circulated the drawing
of a suspect with a Chechen sounding name _ Mukhit Laipanov _ who
they said had rented stores in the buildings blown up Monday and in
the one destroyed last week.
</P>
<P>
   But there also reports that this was the name of a man who had
died years ago and that the renter had used a phony internal
passport to disguise his identify.
</P>
<P>
   Late Monday night, Luzhkov, the mayor, said that two suspects
had been detained. It was unclear, however, whether they were
merely local Caucasians who had been rounded up or whether the
announcement represented a major break in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Shamil Basayev, the Chechen warlord who is leading the rebel
offensive in Dagestan, insisted that he was involved in the blasts,
spawning a new set of conspiracy theories.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The building bombed Monday was located along Kashirskoye Shosse,
one of the main thoroughfares leading out of southern eastern
Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 150 people are believed to have lived in the
structure, which was adjacent to a public school and a
kindergarten. Erected in 1958, the apartment block was made out of
brick.
</P>
<P>
   Shoddier than the pre-fabricated apartment house that was blown
up Thursday, the building had collapsed into a mound of cement,
metal and dust. Rescuers said the two dozen or so people that
survived appeared to have lived on the upper floors and ended up on
top of the heap.
</P>
<P>
   ``This explosion is a carbon copy of the previous one, with one
little difference,'' said Vadim Seryogin, the chief of the Central
Search and Rescue Service. ``There it was reinforced concrete. Here
it is brick.''
</P>
<P>
   Huge metal cranes hauled away the debris as a cold rain fell. A
few possessions _ books, a small icon _ were placed on a blanket in
a sea of mud.
</P>
<P>
   As with most tragedies, luck played a role. Mikhail Kuznetsov
and his family had stayed an extra day at their country cottage.
They learned their apartment house had been destroyed as they were
listening to the radio on their drive home.
</P>
<P>
   The Chechurin family was less fortunate. They had been at home
in their beds. One child survived but lost a leg. His siblings were
missing and his parents were reported to be among the dead.
</P>
<P>
   When the blast occurred teachers rushed to the school to try to
comfort the students. The children were quickly transferred to a
safer location and the school turned into an emergency headquarters
for police, soldiers, fireman and bomb-sniffing dogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have the feeling that we are living in a war zone,'' said
Valentina I. Petrova, a mathematics teacher at the school. ``The
only difference is that in Dagestan people know that there is a war
going on in their republic while for us this came like a bolt from
the blue.''
</P>
<P>
   Relatives prowled the corridors of the school, desperate for
information about family members who had lived in the building.
</P>
<P>
   Natalya Ivanov, who was looking for information about her niece,
complained that Russia's enemies had taken advantage of the end of
totalitarian controls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Democracy is to blame,'' Ms. Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
   Allocating blame appeared to be especially important for
Russia's politicians. Yevgeni Primakov, the former prime minister
and a potential candidate to succeed Yeltsin, complained that the
Yeltsin government was ``completely unprepared'' to deal with the
threat of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Luzhkov, a political ally of Primakov, cautioned Yeltsin against
using the bombing as an excuse to declare a state of emergency and
delay elections.
</P>
<P>
   Less partisan voices observed that law enforcement authorities
had contributed to Russia's vulnerability to terrorism by
repeatedly assuring Muscovites that security forces had the
situation in the capital under control. The aim of such statements
had been to avoid panic but instead they had made many citizens
less vigilant than they should be, Izmailov said.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, the authorities reversed that stance by appealing
to the public for help. Russians, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin
said, must maintain special vigilance and ``take a careful look at
what is happening around them.''
</P>
<P>
   Others reasoned philosophically that Russia, like other Western
countries, had finally been touched by the scourge of terrorism and
would have to prepare for a long fight.
</P>
<P>
   Mikhail Zadornov, a former finance minister, warned Monday night
that Russians should gird themselves for even more bombings, much
as the British had to contend with terrorism over Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have to live with it _ not for one year but for
10 or maybe 20,'' Zadornov said.

RUSSIANS FEEL HELPLESS AGAINST TERROR

  (With RUSSIA-BLAST)

<P>
   MOSCOW _ ``We go to bed wondering whether we are going to get up
in the morning,'' Lyudmila Yegorova said grimly as she closed up
her soft-drink and flower stand before heading home into a gray and
soggy evening. ``What else can we do?''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Yegorova, 51, left for work on Monday morning without
listening to the news, so the first she heard of the latest bomb
blast in Moscow was from her customers as they piled out of the
Tsvetnoi Boulevard subway station on their way to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is something horrible, something beyond comprehension,''
she said, shaking the rain off her kerchiefed head as she heard the
latest death toll from the eight-story building on Kashirskoye
Highway shattered by the most recent explosion. ``And as always, it
is the innocent people who suffer.''
</P>
<P>
   Across Moscow, people were battling their feelings of
helplessness in the face of what now seems to be a wave of random
violence and terror. Two weeks ago, a bomb went off in an
underground video arcade in a shopping center beneath the Kremlin
walls. Since then, two apartment blocks, notable only for their
ordinariness, have been reduced to rubble, killing more than 160
people, in what the authorities said were back-to-back terrorist
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst is feeling defenseless,'' said Zinaida Tiskhova, a
former engineer who now works in tourism. ``After the first
apartment blast, I thought maybe it could be accidental, a one-time
thing. But now that there has been another one, there is no
guarantee that there won't be more, or that I can be safe.''
</P>
<P>
   By Monday afternoon, the city and its citizens were on full
alert. A hot line was established for reports of suspicious
activities. In one high-rise, policemen armed with automatic
weapons came twice to check reports of an unidentified man walking
across the roof. Neighbors searched empty basements, and summoned
local housing officials to check the permits of offices and shops,
which in the last eight years have sprouted like mushrooms in
residential buildings around the city.
</P>
<P>
   Schools reported uncollected knapsacks, and shoppers were
keeping a keen eye out for untended parcels. To some, it seemed
like a reawakening of Soviet times when everyone was quick to mind
everyone else's business. ``There is suspicion everywhere,'' said a
35-year-old mother who identified herself as Svetlana. Her shopping
bag was searched at her son's school, where she had left it to go
run an errand.
</P>
<P>
   As officials linked the terrorist attacks to Chechen militants
now at war with the Russian army in the southern province of
Dagestan, Chechens and other people of the Caucasus, identified by
their black hair and dark complexions, were feeling the brunt of
the city's heightened vigilance. In normal times, members of ethnic
minorities are often stopped by policemen who check their
documents. Now, some Chechen residents of Moscow said they did not
dare go outside, and those who did said the checks were more
frequent, even though police officials have said they are not
targeting any ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
   Remarks overheard on streets and city buses turned up a range of
suspects. from the dark southerners to builders, who some said may
be blowing up buildings to get rid of empty apartments, to the
government and politicians, who have let Caucasus tensions simmer
to the point of explosion.
</P>
<P>
   One woman, interviewed Monday night on television, said she
would happily go back to Soviet rule, to the days of communal
apartments and long lines, rather than live with fear and
uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Yegorova said: ``The government is guilty. Elections are
coming soon, and that may be influencing what is going on. The
people on the top are settling their accounts, and it is the people
on the bottom who have to pay.''

 &HT;    EPA officials call for new pollution standards at Southern
Governor meeting
 &HT;    By Kathey Pruitt
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEMPHIS, Tenn. _ Atlanta may be the poster child for dirty air,
but other Southern cities are brewing their own pollution problems
that threaten continued growth, federal environmental officials
warned Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The number of unhealthy air days has doubled or tripled in
Charlotte, N.C.; Richmond, Va.; Knoxville, Tenn.; and Washington,
D.C., over the last five years under a stringent new federal
standard, Environmental Protection Agency officials told members of
the Southern Governor's Association meeting.
</P>
<P>
   During that time, Atlanta's number of bad air days each year
quadrupled from 13 to more than 50, but ``they're catching up in
terms of pure numbers,'' John Seitz, director of the EPA's Air
Quality Planning and Standards office, said of the other Southern
cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't consider air quality an issue in your state at
the current time, at the rate you're growing, I guarantee you it
will be _ unless you grow clean,'' he cautioned the governors.
</P>
<P>
   This year alone, there have been at least 34 days where 10 or
more eastern states experienced excessive smog. Even
long-recognized natural areas aren't immune: The Great Smoky
Mountains recorded 37 days of unhealthy ozone levels that make
breathing difficult.
</P>
<P>
   While the new, stricter standard is ensnarled in litigation,
even by old measurements pollution is multiplying quickly in the
South, officials said. The EPA should decide within the next month
whether to temporarily reinstate a less-rigorous air-quality
standard. If so, a handful of cities now in compliance would run
afoul of the older regulation, Seitz said.
</P>
<P>
   But getting chief executives of Southern states to cooperate
with federal officials _ and each other _ to clean up the air has
proven difficult. It's that parochialism the governors of 17 states
and two territories hope to overcome with gatherings like this that
stress the need for regional fixes cut emissions from industry,
power plants and automobiles.
</P>
<P>
   In the thick of it are Georgia officials, who are providing some
guidance, even as they grapple for solutions themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realize we're all in this together,'' Gov. Roy Barnes said.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes was hailed for the second time in as many months as an
innovator for his Georgia Regional Transportation Authority, which
has power to veto transportation projects and some major
developments in 13 counties plagued by pollution.

BUCHANAN MAY LEAVE REPUBLICANS FOR REFORM PARTY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ They have cajoled him. They have scolded him. They
have floated jobs in a future Republican administration and special
roles in the party.
</P>
<P>
   But on Monday, top Republican officials seemed all but resigned
to the likelihood that Pat Buchanan, the fiery conservative
commentator, would bolt from the Republican Party and seek the
presidential nomination of Ross Perot's Reform Party, a move they
fear could drain precious votes from the eventual Republican
nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Although Buchanan has made no formal announcement of his plans,
he made it clear over the last two days that he was disillusioned
by the Republican Party, calling it a ``Xerox copy'' of the
Democratic Party, and that he was strongly leaning toward a
third-party bid.
</P>
<P>
   His remarks produced a mixture of pessimism and anger among top
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is like a spoiled little kid who picks up his marbles and
goes someplace else because he doesn't get his way,'' said Robert
Bennett, chairman of the Ohio Republican Party. ``Pat is frustrated
because his message isn't getting out. But if he leaves the party,
he becomes a dead duck as far as Republicans are concerned. He'll
become another Harold Stassen _ every four years he shows up.''
</P>
<P>
   Henry McMaster, chairman of the South Carolina Republican Party,
said: ``There's nothing anyone can do once someone makes up their
mind. This is unfortunate news, because Pat Buchanan's got a lot of
friends in the Republican Party _ and he's going to lose them if he
leaves the party.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked how damaging a Buchanan bid could be, McMaster recalled
Perot's third-party run in 1992. ``It would hurt,'' he said. ``It
certainly hurt George Bush. We lost an election because of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the potential damage could be even greater than in 1992.
In that race, Perot drew votes from both the Democratic and the
Republican candidates; because of Buchanan's strictly conservative
views on social issues, he would be unlikely to siphon many votes
from Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   At the Republican straw poll in Iowa last month, the party's
front-runner, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, asked Buchanan to stay
in the party and, according to Bush's advisers, the two have also
discussed the issue on the telephone. But one adviser to Bush said
that the governor had given up trying to persuade Buchanan to stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very hard to pull this one off the ledge,'' the adviser
said, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``We really believe that
there are things in a campaign that you can control and things that
you can't control.''
</P>
<P>
   The adviser said there had been informal discussions, inside and
outside the Bush campaign, of offering inducements to Buchanan, but
that they had not been offered. ``What are we going to do?'' the
adviser asked. ``Make him chief trade negotiator? We don't want to
insult him by trying to offer him something.''
</P>
<P>
   The adviser said Bush had also tried an indirect approach by
dispatching emissaries, including people Buchanan worked with in
the Nixon White House, to chat with the candidate. But it has been
to no avail. Jim Nicholson, the Republican national chairman, last
met with Buchanan in March. They have set up another meeting,
possibly for next week. But many Republicans said it would be too
late.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks Buchanan has resisted meeting with Nicholson. Indeed,
in an interview Monday on the NBC News program ``Today,'' Buchanan
was dismissive of Nicholson. ``I don't know the chairman that
well,'' he said. ``Frankly, I have been in the Republican Party and
fought for it longer than he has. So I'm not sure what he can say
to me to change my mind from where I'm going.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan, who said he would make a final decision early next
month, asserted that he could no longer distinguish the Republican
and Democratic parties and felt alienated from his party on foreign
policy and other matters.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In another effort to distance himself, Buchanan has withdrawn
from a scheduled appearance this weekend with other Republican
candidates at a party gathering on Mackinac Island, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   Lyn Nofziger, a veteran Republican strategist who backs Buchanan
for the Republican presidential nomination but opposes a move to a
third party, said he did not expect his friend to stay in the
party. ``I don't think that George W. could talk him out of it,''
Nofziger said. ``I don't think that Jim Nicholson could talk him
out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Kaufman, the party's national committeeman from
Massachusetts, agreed that there was little more anyone could do.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears likely from what I hear from the folks close to him
and around him that he's going the other way,'' Kaufman said. ``If
he doesn't want to stay, it's a free world out there.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason Republicans are particularly unsettled is that
Buchanan, a hard-driving campaigner, won the crucial New Hampshire
Republican primary in 1996. Four years before that, his insurgent
campaign sent shock waves through President George Bush's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I call him the front-runner and I'm not kidding,'' Steve
Duprey, chairman of the New Hampshire Republican Party, said of
Buchanan. ``People have made a career of underestimating Pat
Buchanan. He knows how to run and do well in the New Hampshire
primary.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not entirely clear that Buchanan could get the Reform
Party's nomination. ``The only thing that could keep him out of it
is some indication that he may not be able to pick up the Reform
Party nomination,'' Nofziger said.
</P>
<P>
   The Reform Party's biggest-name elected official, Gov. Jesse
Ventura of Minnesota, has been less than enthusiastic about a
Buchanan candidacy. The party has stayed clear of divisive social
issues like abortion and homosexuality, issues on which Buchanan
holds hard-edged conservative views.
</P>
<P>
   But some in the Reform Party say Buchanan's views on changing
the campaign-spending laws and his isolationist stands on foreign
policy would mesh well.
</P>
<P>
   Clifford May, communications director for the Republican
National Committee, said he still held out hope that Buchanan would
remain in the party. ``We hope that he will recognize that he does
not want to do anything that would benefit Al Gore, Bill Bradley
and others on the left,'' May said, ``or do anything that would
harm that conservative movement for which he has worked so hard for
so many years.''

IN REWARD TO NORTH KOREA, U.S. PLANS TO REMOVE SOME TRADE
SANCTIONS
</HEADLINE>

   AUCKLAND, New Zealand _ Rewarding North Korea for a tentative
agreement to stop testing its new long-range missile, President
Clinton said Tuesday he was preparing to lift some of the trade
sanctions that have barred commerce with the North for close to
half a century.
</P>
<P>
   The move is the first concrete step by Clinton to begin lifting
economic sanctions that have been in place since the Korean War
began in 1950.
</P>
<P>
   But the gesture revives the question, raised by congressional
critics of the administration's negotiations with North Korea, of
whether the administration is rewarding the hard-line Communist
government in Pyongyang for defusing a crisis that it created _
perhaps for negotiating advantage _ when U.S. spy satellites
detected that a missile launching appeared imminent.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement on missile testing, disclosed on Sunday, is
limited, far from explicit and of unknown duration. In talks in
Berlin with Charles Kartman, the State Department's chief
negotiator with North Korea, the North Koreans agreed to suspend
long-range missile testing while negotiations are under way on a
more permanent ban.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing binds the North to the agreement, other than the
fear that whatever sanctions the United States lifts in coming
weeks could be reimposed.
</P>
<P>
   The text of a statement released in Berlin makes no clear
mention of the missile test ban, saying only that both countries
will ``endeavor to preserve a positive atmosphere conducive to
improved bilateral relations and to peace and security.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton, speaking to reporters here Tuesday morning before
boarding a plane for Queenstown on New Zealand's South Island,
said, ``We understand and expect North Korea will refrain from
testing long-range missiles of any kind while our discussions
continue.''
</P>
<P>
   He called the tentative accord ``an important initial step.'' In
return, he said, he is looking at ``easing sanctions'' and moving
toward a normalization of economic relations.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials, working on the fringes of the Asian
economic summit meeting that ended Monday evening, portrayed the
accord as a modest but important victory at a time of sudden
instabilty throughout Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we feared,'' one administration official here said
Tuesday, ``was a new crisis in Korea at the exact moment that
there's heightened tension between China and Taiwan and the
insertion of peacekeeping troops in Indonesia. That would have been
an ugly combination, and we may have ducked it.''
</P>
<P>
   Briefing reporters Monday evening, Sandy Berger, Clinton's
national security adviser, played down the scope of the sanctions
to be lifted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Essentially North Korea would be in the same status as
Syria,'' he said, meaning that the types and amount of commerce
would still be strictly controlled. In theory, the eased sanctions
will allow some American companies to invest in North Korea _
though few American companies appear very eager to enter one of the
world's last Stalinist nations, and one of the poorest.
</P>
<P>
   State Department officials, speaking in Washington, said it
would also be possible to transfer money to North Korea from family
members in the United States. Most cash funneled into the country
flows through Japan, which has a large Korean population centered
in Osaka.
</P>
<P>
   The lifting of the sanctions appears to be the first step in
carrying out a strategy developed by former Defense Secretary
William J. Perry, acting as a special envoy to North Korea for
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The report that Perry gave to Clinton has never been made
public. But those familiar with it describe a proposal for a finely
tuned series of moves to lift sanctions as North Korea begins to
freeze its missile arsenal and end sales of missile technology to
countries that Washington regards as rogue nations.
</P>
<P>
   A 1994 accord froze activity at North Korea's biggest nuclear
weapons plant, but it did not deal with the missiles that could
carry small nuclear weapons. Berger suggested Tuesday that if the
North Koreans made the moratorium on missile launchings permanent,
a greater easing of sanctions could follow.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're going to embark on a different course,'' he said, ``a
course which could conceivably lead to a long-term moratorium on a
missile program, that suggests the possibility of a different kind
of relationship with North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, if that's the case, it's appropriate for us to take
some steps which would ease some of the sanctions that we have in
North Korea.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that ``if they tested, obviously we would be going down
a different path.''
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear how quickly a long-term ban on testing might be
negotiated, but past experience with North Korea suggests that it
could take years.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea's president, Kim Dae Jung, also here for the
economic conference, praised the North Korean commitment and
characterized it as a victory for his own ``sunshine policy,'' a
series of modest economic openings to the South for North Korea.
``We view this as a sign of sincerity in the North,'' Kim said.
</P>
<P>
   Japan has been by far the most concerned about another missile
test, especially after a previous test, in August 1998, crossed
Japanese territory and created a political uproar. Japanese
officials were distinctly more muted in their reaction Tuesday.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Japan has said it would consider returning to the kind of
economic relationship the two countries had before the 1998
launching, but it has offered little else in the way of incentives.
</P>
<P>
   The launching bolstered the position of conservatives in Japan
who have long argued for a more robust military. The strong
domestic reaction to last year's missile test also cleared the way
for Japan to announce that it was joining an American-led project
to develop a ``theater missile defense'' system.
</P>
<P>
   One theory about the new North Korean missile, the Taepodong 2,
is that it was invented as a negotiating chip, not an offensive
weapon. Many times in the last decade North Korea has created a
crisis, then sought its reward _ usually food aid _ for defusing
it.

AMEX MAY SOON FACE COMPETITION FOR SOME BEST-SELLING PRODUCTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By SARA ROBINSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The American Stock Exchange is facing some
fierce competition for its most popular securities, exchange-traded
funds.
</P>
<P>
   Barclays Global Investors, which is the leader in these funds,
plans to introduce dozens of new ones next year, in what has been
regarded as a boon for the Amex.
</P>
<P>
   But Barclays has also been talking with the Chicago Board
Options Exchange about the new listings, a spokeswoman for the
options exchange confirmed Monday _ potentially creating a rival
for the Amex in a crucial market where none existed before.
</P>
<P>
   Exchange-traded funds _ which go by arcane names like SPDRs (for
Standard &AMP; Poor's depository receipts) and WEBS (for world equity
benchmark shares _ blend the characteristics of mutual funds,
closed-end funds and stocks. Each share of the fund tracks a basket
of stocks in some index, which can be traded throughout the day,
bought on margin or even sold short (a bet that their price will
decline).
</P>
<P>
   The most popular funds are SPDRs, or spiders, which are based on
the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index and are owned by the Amex and
managed by the State Street Corp..
</P>
<P>
   ``The trade volume on the Amex doubled, and it's almost
completely because of these,'' Nathan Most, the former senior vice
president for new products at the Amex, said of the spiders'
introduction in 1993. ``I think it did save the Amex.''
</P>
<P>
   Barclays Global Investors, a unit of the British bank Barclays
PLC that is the leader in creating these products, declined to
comment on its discussions. But the talks open up a new battlefield
between the Amex and Chicago, which are also waging a war over
options listings.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could be a very serious challenge to the American Stock
Exchange,'' said John C. Coffee Jr., a securities law professor at
Columbia University. ``If CBOE were able to divert trading from the
Amex in these products, then it would be an devastating blow.''
</P>
<P>
   Amex officials declined to comment on the situation.
</P>
<P>
   Competition between the exchanges heated up on Friday when the
Chicago exchange, the nation's largest options exchange, said it
would list 43 options contracts now listed on the Amex starting
next Monday. Among those listings will be options on the Intel
Corp., the Amex's most active contract.
</P>
<P>
   The Amex retaliated by saying it would start trading 35 options
contracts, including those for the AT&AMP;T Corp., now the domain of
the Chicago exchange, on Tuesday and Wednesday. Until recently,
options listings were governed by a sort of gentlemen's agreement,
under which each exchange restrained from trading each other's
products. Regulators have been investigating those business and
trading practices.
</P>
<P>
   How well the Amex handles these challenges will be the first
test of its new chairman and chief executive, Salvatore F. Sodano,
who was appointed last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you put together this challenge and their challenge to
the Amex's special status on trading options such as Intel,''
Coffee said, ``I'd say that you have a full-scale frontal attack
from CBOE on the core of the Amex's franchise.''
</P>
<P>
   The competition in its core business comes at a difficult time
for Amex. Tensions are lingering from its merger in November with
the National Association of Securities Dealers, parent of the
Nasdaq market. The association made bold promises to the Amex,
saying it would invest in technology and help attract new stock
listings. But it has been slow to show results.
</P>
<P>
   Exchange-traded funds have been the Amex's mainstay in recent
years, accounting for 49 percent of its total trading volume and
almost $21 billion in assets. These products have been gaining in
popularity, even as Amex has had trouble retaining the stock
listings of successful corporations and attracting new ones.
</P>
<P>
   Barclays, which already manages 17 country-specific Webs funds
traded on the Amex, has made preliminary filings with the
Securities and Exchange Commission to offer 51 new products early
next year, though it may bring fewer to market. About 30
exchange-traded funds now trade on the Amex, and at least some of
the new Barclays funds will probably trade there. But at risk is
the virtual monopoly that Amex now enjoys.
</P>
<P>
   Barclays is expected to file a registration statement and
prospectus for its new products this fall. The prospectus will
probably state where they will be traded, though the document could
be amended later.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the Barclays funds will be in direct competition with
existing Amex products, including funds based on the S&AMP;P 500, the
S&AMP;P 400 of mid-sized corporations and several Dow Jones indexes.
One new Barclays fund will track the S&AMP;P 500 index, as do spiders,
Amex's reputed lifesaver. The Barclays fund will be structured as
an open-end fund, allowing continuous reinvestment of dividends, an
advantage for some investors. Spiders, with more than $13 billion
in assets, are structured as a unit investment trust, paying out
dividends quarterly.
</P>
<P>
   The Amex profits from the trading generated by the products, so
having two competing products listed there would be no problem for
it. But Barclays might prefer to list its product on an exchange
where it does not have a direct competitor.
</P>
<P>
   Ed McRedmond, an analyst at A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons in St. Louis,
said, ``I wouldn't expect that someone would necessarily sell their
spiders and buy this. But someone buying in for the first time
might choose the Barclays fund over the spider.''

   Thrasher's Stefan hopes to be the NFL's noteworthy grown-up kid
</P>
<P>
   By Jeff Schultz
</P>
<P>
   C. 1999 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ The first sensation he felt was, dare we say,
dizziness. Patrik Stefan hadn't played in a game in six months.
Even toddlers from Pribham who make that swift transition from
crawling to centering the power play can feel like they are in a
fog after significant down time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt very strange at beginning,'' Stefan said, his English
words fighting through his Czech accent. ``When you don't play, you
lose your feeling about the game. Where you have to be on defense,
on offense. It's hard, these kinds of things. But as the game went
on, I felt much better.''
</P>
<P>
   Stefan's NHL career is exactly one exhibition game long _ a bit
early to gauge how shrewd the Thrashers were to trade from the
second drafting position to the first to select an 18-year-old
center who suffered concussions twice last year in the
International Hockey League. The comforting news is that after a
week of full-contact scrimmages and Sunday's pre-season game in
Grand Rapids, Mich., against St. Louis, Stefan: 1) post-concussion
syndrome hasn't found its way onto the Thrashers' injury report; 2)
the head-spinning Stefan encountered Sunday was merely attributed
to not playing a game since last March.
</P>
<P>
   Stefan was pointless in the game, which is not to say his game
has been pointless. Nervous, by his own admission, at the outset of
training camp, he grew more comfortable by the day in scrimmages in
Orlando, Fla., twice scoring winning goals and another while his
team was shorthanded. He has impressed teammates with his deceptive
speed, his vision on the ice, his passing ability, the ease and
quickness with which he moves the puck. He also has shown uncommon
maturity and resolve for someone who turns 19 on Thursday. They are
traits seldom attached to young draft picks.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't always see 18-year-olds who want to listen and work
hard,'' said Kelly Buchberger, the 32-year-old winger who has been
paired up with Stefan since camp started. ``A lot of kids from the
juniors come in and don't really appreciate what it takes over here
and that it's a privilege just to play in the league.''
</P>
<P>
   The common refrain since the draft has been that the Thrashers
drafted either the next Eric Lindros (a league star) or Brett
Lindros (who had to retire prematurely because of concussions).
Focus on the head blows during Stefan's abbreviated two seasons
with the Long Beach Ice Dogs increased when agent Rich Winter would
not release the player's most recent medical reports, which at
least partly contributed to Tampa Bay's decision to pass on Stefan
and spark a series of draft-day trades. The Thrashers relied on
Winter's word and their own research.
</P>
<P>
   Long Beach John Van Boxmeer said he told Bob Owen, the
Thrashers' director of player development, a week before the draft
that Stefan was fine. ``Our doctors were comfortable there was no
problem with Patrik,'' Van Boxmeer said.
</P>
<P>
   Most important to the Long Beach coach was Stefan's attitude in
the IHL, where the majority of players were five to 10 years older
than him, bigger and stronger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Players took shots at him because he was a dominant player and
he was a young European in our league,'' Van Boxmeer said. ``When
your opponent has a pre-game meeting, they're saying, 'Here's a
young kid _ hit him.' But Patrik didn't take a step backward.''
</P>
<P>
   Few know Stefan better than Owen. Before being hired by the
Thrashers, Owen ran a scouting service and helped place underage
Europeans in the IHL as a hockey prep school for the NHL draft.
Most European players opt for the Canadian juniors. The players are
younger and the style is less physical and more free wheeling. The
IHL was looking for publicity and Owen suggested signing some
Europeans. He recommended Stefan to Van Boxmeer. He had been
scouting Stefan since he was 15, and the player didn't think twice
about leaving home for North America, even though he spoke little
English.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing that strikes you about Patrik is he's a
grown-up,'' Owen said. ``Knowing the makeup of the kid, I knew it
didn't matter if he was in Palm Springs _ he wanted to be a hockey
player. I saw him in the Czech Republic, playing against kids five
years older than him.''
</P>
<P>
   Stefan stayed with a family in Southern California and his
mother and father took turns coming out to visit from his hometown
of Pribham. The belief is that the two years in the IHL will ease
Stefan's transition to the NHL. But when Stefan was dazzling
spectators in training camp, team officials went out of their way
to say, ``No big deal,'' in hopes of keeping expectations in check.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to make it difficult for this kid to
succeed,'' Waddell said.
</P>
<P>
   Van Boxmeer said, ``He's not going to be playing with Jaromir
Jagr or Brett Hull. How many guys as rookies face the other team's
best checkers? That's what he's going to be facing.''
</P>
<P>
   Stefan said intent on not voicing any projected point totals
this year. What's Czech for media-savvy?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to put too much pressure on myself,'' he said.
``I'm trying to take things easy and slow.''
</P>
<P>
   He credits Buchberger with ``helping me with the small things on
the ice,'' and with ``yelling at me'' _ in the good way.
</P>
<P>
   Buchberger foresees greatness, just no right away.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not going to be Wayne Gretzky overnight,'' said
Buchberger, a Gretzky teammate in Edmonton. ``He's capable of being
a star in this league but it takes time.''
</P>

ISRAELIS AND PALESTINIANS BEGIN FINAL ROUND OF NEGOTIATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By WILLIAM A. ORME Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Six years to the day after Yasser Arafat and Yitzhak
Rabin shook hands at the White House and agreed on a blueprint for
peace, Palestinian and Israeli authorities Monday formally began
what both sides say should be the final but most difficult round of
their protracted negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   In an evening of ceremonial cordiality at the border between
Israel and Gaza, Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy and Abu Mazen,
the Palestinian Authority representative, said they hoped to agree
on terms for a permanent settlement within just one year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This agreement will end _ God willing _ the bloody feud
between our two people for the past 100 years,'' Levy said.
</P>
<P>
   Mazen, a principal architect of the 1993 peace agreement, also
spoke of ``a historic reconciliation.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet neither man played down the challenge for negotiators
confronting the most contentious of the many unresolved issues
here: borders, armaments, Jewish settlers, Palestinian refugees and
_ most explosive of all _ the political future of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   There are other daunting problems. Ancient property disputes
must be redressed, and competing claims to religious sites
adjudicated. What will be even more critical is an equitable
allocation of water resources in desert territories with growing
populations and shrinking aquifers.
</P>
<P>
   In just five months, the two sides are supposed to produce a
``framework agreement'' detailing all outstanding issues, with
proposed timetables and formulas for their resolution. By Sept. 13,
2000, the Israelis and Palestinians say they hope to have a final
peace pact ready for signature.
</P>
<P>
   What was unstated in Monday's ceremony was the underlying
Palestinian expectation that shortly after such an accord, the
Palestinian Authority could declare statehood, under terms to which
Israel and the United States had already agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Many Palestinians remain dubious. They note that this is, in
effect, the third renegotiation and rescheduling of peace
commitments made at the White House in 1993. Under the terms of the
1993 pact, the ``final status'' phase of the negotiations was to
have begun no later than 1997 and concluded by May 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Ross, the State Department's veteran Middle East
negotiator, suggested after attending the inauguration of the talks
Monday night that the one-year deadline may be unrealistic. ``It's
definitely going to be very difficult,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Prime Minister Ehud Barak, elected in May on a promise to

expected. Almost immediately after renegotiating the last stalled

   ``We want to emphasize our partnership with Ehud Barak, which
will enable us to reach a common goal,'' Mazen said Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   As the contours of compromise become visible, the Barak
government and the Palestinian Authority are prepared for a bitter
backlash, including violence, from opponents of the peace deal in
both communities.

<P>
   ``While implementing the agreements to which we have committed
ourselves, the Israeli government will face difficulties, and maybe
even dangers,'' Levy warned cabinet colleagues last week.
</P>
<P>
   Echoing Levy's concerns, Mazen said Monday night that the
``faces of terror are still interested in destroying the peace
process and in killing innocent people.'' He repeated the
Palestinian Authority's vows to continue collaborating with Israel
on eradicating terrorism.

   Women are better at tasting wine than men, writes wine importer
and expert  &UR; Kermit Lynch  &LR; of Berkeley in Food &AMP; Wine. Lynch,
apologizing for generalizing about gender, claims that men approach
the tasting ``with cartfuls of excess baggage.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When they stick their nose into a glass of wine they think it
would be unmanly to say something wrong or stupid. So they get
uptight. It is difficult to taste properly when you are uptight.
Fear constricts the flow of blood to the taste buds.''
</P>
<P>
   A woman, on the other hand, says ``the first thing that pops
into her head, fearlessly, and it is amazing how often such
spontaneous responses are appropriate and interesting. Women
approach wine with their noses wide open, and the directness of an
unself-conscious reaction can be refreshing.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, American men generally want what Lynch calls a
``big'' wine. Lynch says that ``size'' is relevant only with
respect to the food served with the wine. ``You wouldn't select a
light wine with dinosaur stew and you wouldn't want a big clunker
with oysters. ... Choosing a wine is not like a caveman choosing a
club, but a lot of men cannot get past that stage of development.''

at contest time.
</P>
<P>
   The change was necessitated by New Jersey discrimination laws,
and would have come a year earlier had it not been fought by
individual state pageants. ``Miss America has a long history of

that changes that,'' said  &UR; Libby Taylor &LR;  of the Miss Kentucky

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the violence in East Timor worsened, the
Americans relied on one person to deliver a tough message to the
the Indonesian government, senior administration officials said on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The go-between was the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
Gen. Henry H. Shelton, who dealt on the phone with his counterpart,
General Wiranto, the head of Indonesia's powerful military.
</P>
<P>
   While President Clinton condemned the Indonesian military's
refusal to stop the violence in East Timor, Shelton spoke three
times with Wiranto, culminating on Friday with what senior
officials called an ``ugly message.''
</P>
<P>
   Using specific and emphatic language, Shelton said the United
States would block the International Monetary Fund from delivering
the billions of dollars that Indonesia needs to recover further
from the Asian economic crisis, senior administration officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Wiranto asked the United States to wait 24 hours
while he visited East Timor to see if his army was maintaining
order, these officials said. If he thought the Indonesian army was
lax, Wiranto promised to ask for international peacekeepers to come
in.
</P>
<P>
   Early Sunday morning, Wiranto phoned Shelton with his report
from East Timor, which was not good, and with the news that he was
recommending that President B.J. Habibie ask immediately for the
peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
   The administration late last week decided it had to step up the
pressure on Indonesia, officials said, to counteract a growing
public perception that the White House was dealing timidly with the
crisis, in order to preserve a relationship with Indonesia, a
country of 200 million people that has rich natural resources.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't looking very valiant, and nobody liked that around
here,'' said an administration official. ``Our spine got
stiffened.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Clinton administration shifted from a policy of resisting
sanctions to making a serious threat to the Indonesian economy,
Shelton relayed the increasingly urgent messages that the
Indonesian army had to end the killings and destruction in East
Timor. That message was underlined by Adm. Dennis C. Blair,
commander in chief of the U.S. Pacific Command, who traveled to
Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Pentagon is beginning preparations to provide logistical
support for a multinational peacekeeping mission for East Timor,
and the Clinton administration is arguing that the channel to the
Indonesian military speaks to the value of the the years of
training given to Indonesia's future military leaders in the United
States and the millions of dollars that the United States spent on
military aid to Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a big plus to have someone who could call the
Indonesian military _ they were the ones calling the shots,'' said
a senior administration official. ``We had a unique asset and I
don't see how our military could have done it without their past
history with these generals.''
</P>
<P>
   As the crisis deepened and it became clear that only Wiranto
could halt the massacres and destruction to the small territory,
and not Habibie, the administration leaned on the military to
convey its messages.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that General Wiranto could have turned off
the violence much sooner,'' said a senior Defense official. ``But
he and the rest of the government were waiting to see if their plan
to get something less than full independence for East Timor would
work.''
</P>
<P>
   At the request of the White House, Shelton placed his first call
to Wiranto last Monday, and received assurances that, with the
imposition of martial law in East Timor, there would be peace in
two days.
</P>
<P>
   But when militias and elements of the army continued terrorizing
and murdering civilians, Blair went to Jakarta for a tense
30-minute interview with Wiranto. They allowed no aides in the
meeting and spoke in English to avoid the need for interpreters.
</P>
<P>
   Blair informed Wiranto that the administration was cutting off
the remainder of American military relations with his country,
according to administration officials, and he then left the
country, canceling a speech he was to deliver before a military
academy in Bandung.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, after Wiranto traveled to East Timor with a team
of diplomats from the U.N. Security Council, he phoned Shelton with
his decision to yield to international pressure and ask for
peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the first credible sign that Indonesia would allow in
peacekeepers,'' said a senior administration official.

YENS HITS 3-YEAR HIGH AS BANK OF JAPAN ENDS INTERVENTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Japanese yen resumed its more than two-month rally against
the dollar Monday, jumping 2.2 percent to a three-year high, and
analysts said the rally should continue.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's surge came after the Bank of Japan intervened in the
foreign exchange market on Friday and staved off the rally for a
day. The selling of yen for dollars worked for one day only because
Japanese officials made clear then that they were not trying to
change the direction of the yen. Instead, they were just trying to
slow its rise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Further yen gains are a good bet in the near term,'' Karen
Parker, director of currency research at Chase Manhattan Bank, said
in a commentary for clients Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   She pointed out that Masaru Hayami, the governor of the Bank of
Japan, said that Japan could not move to reverse the direction of
the yen without intervention support from the United States. And
such support, based on recent comments from Treasury Secretary
Lawrence H. Summers, does not seem likely, she said.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the yen settled at 106.44 to the dollar, up from
108.81 on Friday. This was the strongest the yen has been since the
spring of 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In other currency trading, the dollar was down slightly against
the single European currency, which settled at $1.0411, up from
$1.0364 on Friday. Setbacks in local elections for German
Chancellor Gerhard Schroder knocked the euro lower earlier in the
day, but it rebounded. For the year, the euro is still down 10.8
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The rally of the yen has been fueled by the apparent turnaround
of the Japanese economy after the longest recession since World War
II. As foreign investors have gained confidence about the nation's
economic outlook, they have bet that the Japanese stock market
would go up. And to buy Japanese stocks, foreign investors have to
buy yen, which is pushing its value higher.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, the Nikkei index of 22 stocks is up 29.4
percent in yen terms after a jump of 1.1 percent Monday, to
17,909.29 Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The changing view for the Japanese economy has been supported by
surprising growth figures for the first two quarters of this year.
It became harder to dismiss as an aberration the annual growth rate
of 8.1 percent in the first quarter after the second-quarter annual
growth rate came in at an unexpected 0.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But the rising yen also could pose a threat to the economic
recovery. As the yen strengthens, it makes Japanese exports more
expensive abroad. And these higher prices could cut into sales in
this sector that is so important to the overall economy.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese authorities have worried about this threat, which
is why they tried to change the direction of the yen with six big
interventions in June and July. But they appear to have given up
that strategy, possibly because it is difficult for any government
to stand against the movement of its currency if investors around
the world are pushing it in one direction.

INDONESIA CONCERNED ABOUT COMPOSITION OF U.N. PEACEKEEPING FORCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also TIMOR-RDP, TIMOR-U.S.)

 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Indonesia's foreign minister told the U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan and the Security Council Monday that
his government would welcome the speedy deployment of an
international force for East Timor but had some questions about the
nationalities of its commander and troops.
</P>
<P>
   The council, which is expected to act in the next day or two,
worked late into the night Monday on a draft resolution submitted
by Britain that would give the force the strongest military
authority under the U.N. Charter. The draft indicates that an
Australian would be designated the overall commander, a decision
strongly backed by the United States.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, in Darwin, an Australian port city 250 miles
from East Timor, preparations for action have already begun, with
the Australians apparently confident that they will lead the force.
</P>
<P>
   The Indonesian foreign minister, Ali Alatas, said that his
country would set no conditions but that it would prefer soldiers
from neighboring Asian countries that are members of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations. Some of those nations,
including Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore and the Philippines, have
said they would participate. British Gurkha troops based in Brunei
are also on call.
</P>
<P>
   For many Indonesians, however, Australia is a provocative and
politically explosive choice because it has been a strong supporter
of East Timorese independence leaders, and the two countries had
very rocky relations until relatively recently. Some Security
Council members have qualms about this choice, a diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
   Australia has named a commander, Maj. Gen. Peter Cosgrove, a
Vietnam War veteran, and is assembling ships, helicopters and a
high-speed catamaran capable of carrying more than 500 troops.
France has sent four military officers to advise the Australians,
and 10 U.S. military experts are also in Darwin to help draw up
plans. At the Pentagon, Adm. Craig R. Quigley, a spokesman, said
that the United States was preparing to use its huge cargo planes
to transport troops and equipment but had not selected ships or
soldiers for duty, pending action by the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   The council, which appears united on the need for a quick
deployment of troops, is unlikely to specify the number or
nationalities of soldiers in the force apart from the commander.
Those decisions would be left to the troop-contributing countries
and U.N. peacekeeping experts.
</P>
<P>
   In Jakarta, Indonesian nationalists are demanding that no
Americans, New Zealanders or Portuguese take part. Portugal was the
former colonial power in East Timor, and Americans, New Zealanders
and other non-Asians are apparently viewed as prejudiced against
Indonesia. A diplomat suggested that Indonesia's long years under
often harsh Dutch rule had left a legacy of revulsion against
European domination, which explains a persistent cultural or racial
subtext to the debate about peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   Annan told the Security Council Monday that Indonesian
``sensitivities'' had to be taken into account, diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't come here to prevent any country from
participating,'' said Alatas, but he hinted broadly that the issue
should be weighed. ``It is up to the countries themselves to
consider whether it is appropriate, whether their presence would or
would not exacerbate the situation.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Mobs in Indonesia have been attacking Australian diplomatic and
trade missions over the last week, including an attack Monday in
Surabaya. Alatas said Monday that these are responses to Australian
attacks on Indonesian consulates and its embassy in Australia,
which he said is being boycotted and can't get basic supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the outside chance that mounting political pressures
will cause President B.J. Habibie to balk at the last minute,
diplomats here were relieved to hear Alatas' message Monday and are
more or less optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure if I'm optimistic or pessimistic,'' Richard C.
Holbrooke, the U.S. representative, said in an interview after
Monday's Security Council meeting. But he said he saw no real
opposition in the council to quick action, and he marveled at the
speed with which the situation had turned around.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forty-eight hours ago we were looking at the worst,'' he said.
``Twenty-four hours ago we were trying to parse the meaning of
Habibie. Now we're working on implementation. That's a pretty
impressive record for the Security Council and for Kofi.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far, even if we got there too slowly,'' Holbrooke said,
``the last 48 hours have been a major step forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Portugal's envoy, Antonio Monteiro, said that he welcomed
Alatas' assurances that he was not seeking to set conditions. ``We
are very encouraged,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sir Jeremy Greenstock, Britain's U.N. representative and a
member of a team of five ambassadors sent to Indonesia last week to
urge the government to accept outside help in East Timor, where a
vote for independence by the territory's population set off a week
of terror inflicted by pro-Indonesian militias, said Monday on his
return from Jakarta that he thought Indonesian government officials
had underestimated the scale of the crisis and had needed to be
persuaded ``to think again'' about their resistance to foreign
military assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Alatas told reporters Monday that while he would like more
discussion on the composition of the force, ``what is important is
that Indonesia would like to see this security cooperation, the
sending of a force as soon as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that an international peacekeeping force had been
authorized under the May 5 agreement on the future of East Timor.
But the troops been called for only in the third phase of the
process, after the Indonesian parliament had ratified the
referendum results, probably in November, and the United Nations
would take over administration of East Timor until the new
country's first elections. Until the ratification, Indonesian
troops were supposed to be responsible for law and order.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, however, the situation is different,'' Alatas said.
</P>
<P>
   Creating a multinational force with Security Council backing
rather than an full-dress U.N. peacekeeping operation is essential
to the Clinton administration because of congressional restraints
on U.S. participation and payments for official peacekeeping
operations. A multinational force does not require congressional
notification and the bills for it go to the countries involved and
not to member nations of the United Nations, which would pass 31
percent of the costs on to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Another unknown factor in the Indonesian political environment
now is the attitude of Megawati Sukarnoputri, whose party came in
first _ but without a majority _ in the Indonesian assembly
elections in June. The daughter of Indonesia's first president,
Sukarno, who was an uncompromising nationalist where the unity of
Indonesia was concerned, Ms. Megawati initially opposed the
decision to allow the East Timorese to vote on their future in a
referendum.
</P>
<P>
   Although she later seemed to soften that view, the Security
Council mission that visited Indonesia last week said in its report
Monday that she had again criticized Habibie strongly for agreeing
to sign the May 5 agreement with Portugal and the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``She declined to go public in support of the idea of
international intervention,'' the report from the five ambassadors
said. She told the team that Habibie's legitimacy as leader of
Indonesia was ``fading away.''
</P>
<P>
   Habibie, like Ms. Megawati, is also a likely candidate for the
Indonesian presidency, when a choice is made by indirect election
through the assembly later in the year. Experts say that she could
attract support from the armed forces and other strongly
nationalist groups opposed to any foreign presence in what they
regard as Indonesia, even if East Timor was always a separate case,
incorporated without being internationally recognized as part of
Indonesia since it was seized by Jakarta's troops in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   It is not inconceivable, some U.N. officials and diplomats say,
that a strong nationalist tide could undo the East Timor agreement
or at least weaken it and allow a civil war to break out in the
territory.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Alexandre Gusmao, the East Timorese rebel leader known as
Xanana, told the Security Council mission last week that the
conditions for an outbreak of fighting between his forces and the
Indonesian army already existed. Gusmao, who was in Indonesian
custody for seven years before being released last week and taking
refuge in the British Embassy, urged a quick deployment of an
international force.
</P>
<P>
   In their recommendations to the Security Council, the envoys who
returned Monday from Jakarta said the government of Indonesia
should continue to be pressed to curtail the militias that have
terrorized East Timor and driven hundreds of thousands of people
from their homes and should insure that the militias do not provoke
fighting with Gusmao's rebel troops.

 INVESTMENT MANAGER CHARGED IN VAST SECURITIES FRAUD 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As a global investment manager, Martin A. Armstrong had little
trouble selling himself to sophisticated clients overseas. On the
strength of a stellar performance record, an impressive Web site
and his claims of running one of the world's largest economics
advisory firms, he raised more than $3 billion from Japanese
companies eager for American-style gains in their portfolios.
</P>
<P>
   Now those companies are facing giant losses and probably ruing
the day they heard of Armstrong's investing techniques.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong, 49, chairman of Princeton Economics International
Ltd. and its Hong Kong brokerage subsidiary Cresvale International
Ltd., surrendered late Monday to federal authorities in Trenton,
N.J., and was charged with engaging in an enormous securities fraud
that has resulted in more than $500 million in losses to investors.
</P>
<P>
   According to a complaint unsealed Monday by Mary Jo White, the
U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, Armstrong lied
about returns he was generating in his customers' accounts and
illegally pooled their money, essentially using funds raised from
new investors to pay off older customers.
</P>
<P>
   The fraud appeared to be a desperate attempt to hide massive
trading losses. Indeed, Armstrong owes some $1 billion to
investors, but prosecutors say only $46 million in assets remains
in the accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The alleged fraud occurred in accounts held by Republic New York
Securities Corp., a subsidiary of Republic New York Corp., which
also owns Republic National Bank of New York.
</P>
<P>
   As the case is sorted out, Republic's planned merger with HSBC
of London has been delayed. The bank is conducting an internal
investigation into the management of its futures division, operated
out of Philadelphia, where the accounts of Princeton Economics
clients were held. The shareholder meeting to vote on the proposed
merger has been postponed until Oct. 12.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Ng, a spokeswoman for HSBC in London, declined to comment
on whether the new developments would affect the planned merger. A
spokeswoman for Republic New York declined to comment. The bank was
not charged with any wrongdoing and has suspended two top officials
of the securities subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer representing Armstrong, Marc Durant, a partner at
Durant &AMP; Durant in Philadelphia, said his client vigorously
disputed the allegations and maintained his innocence.
</P>
<P>
   ``He definitely will fight this,'' Durant said. ``He disputes
how the fiduciary, which was Republic New York Securities, handled
the funds and the accounts. He believes he's being made a scapegoat
for honest, noncriminal trading losses.'' Although Armstrong
concedes that there were substantial losses in the accounts, he
disputes prosecutors' figure of $500 million.
</P>
<P>
   The arrest of Armstrong is the latest piece of a puzzle that
began to emerge in May when the Financial Supervisory Agency,
Japan's securities regulator, surprised management of Cresvale's
Tokyo offices with an audit of its accounts. Cresvale, which also
has offices in London, New York and Sydney, Australia, was acquired
by Princeton Economics International in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   According to prosecutors, Cresvale raised $3 billion from
investors on the strength of Armstrong's fictitious record as a
money manager. An April 1998 announcement of a new hedge fund
started by Armstrong, for example, put his firm's investment
returns at more than 28 percent a year since 1992. Instead,
prosecutors say, Armstrong lost hundreds of millions trading.
</P>
<P>
   To hide his losses, Armstrong paid old investors with the
proceeds raised by newer clients, a venerable type of fraud known
as a Ponzi scheme. It was named for Charles Ponzi, an Italian
immigrant to the United States, who swindled $15 million from
40,000 people after World War I. The people thought they were
investing in postal reply coupons, but Ponzi actually pocketed most
of the money, paying early investors with cash from new investors.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong, of Maple Shade, N.J., was released on $5 million bond
on his signature. He did not return a telephone call to his office
seeking comment. A secretary at Princeton Economics International
in Princeton said no one was at the office late Monday afternoon to
comment on the charges.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say that Cresvale sold what it called ``Princeton
Notes,'' backed by Princeton Economics International, to Japanese
companies promising returns of at least 4 percent and the potential
for much more. With interest rates in Japan far lower, the 4
percent returns were attractive. No one outside Japan, nor any
individuals are known to have invested with Cresvale.
</P>
<P>
   As of late August, there were 113 accounts managed by Princeton.
Among the companies that had invested money with Princeton were
Alps Electric Co., Chudenko Electronics Co. and Gun Ei Chemical
Industry Co.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Bloomberg News reported Monday that Alps Electric said it might
lose as much as $185 million in the current fiscal year because of
its investment with Princeton. Shares of these companies and others
that invested in Princeton Notes have fallen in Japanese trading in
recent days.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong published journals and newsletters on financial
subjects, giving him the patina of an intellectual. He was quoted
in numerous publications, including The New York Times, on subjects
ranging from projections on interest rates to the trading of
foreign currencies and other commodities. He was a critic of the
European monetary union, and commented on the silver market when
Warren Buffett was buying silver last year.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1998, he joined Magnum Global Investments to form a
hedge fund offering institutions and wealthy investors access to
what he called his market-forecasting expertise.
</P>
<P>
   A promotion for the hedge fund stated that Princeton Economics
could forecast trends on markets more accurately than other
managers because of its economic model, ``which provides specific
forecasting on more than 30,000 economic and financial statistics
worldwide.'' The model predicted the 1987 stock-market crash, the
1994 bond crash and the demise of the yen since mid-1995, according
to the sales material.
</P>
<P>
   But Armstrong had had run-ins with regulators before. In 1985,
the Commodity Futures Trading Commission filed a complaint against
Armstrong and three consulting companies that he ran for failing to
register as commodity trading advisers and for not maintaining
proper records.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, the commission filed a second complaint
charging that Armstrong's company, Economic Consultants of
Princeton, misrepresented hypothetical performance results and
omitted a required disclaimer in its advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   When he filed to overturn the commission's findings in U.S.
appeals court, Armstrong claimed to have begun working at a coin
and stamp dealership at age 13. He was a millionaire at 15,
according to court documents, and opened his own collectors' store
when he was 21.
</P>
<P>
   In 1973 he began publishing commodity market predictions as a
hobby. The appeals court upheld the commission's ruling. On a
further appeal, the Supreme Court declined to hear his case.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong's link to Republic Securities appears to be James
Curley, a director of Cresvale International, who was chairman of
Republic Securities from March 1994 through June 1996. Since 1994,
James Sweeney has been president of Republic Securities. On Sept.
1, he and William H. Rogers, president of the firm's futures
division, were suspended by the bank pending the outcome of its
investigation. The bank is cooperating with federal authorities.
</P>
<P>
   According to prosecutors, the futures division of Republic
Securities was dominated by Armstrong's trading, accounting for 90
percent of its business. Princeton may have opened accounts at
Republic as early as 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say that Armstrong conducted his fraud with the help
of letters on Republic New York Securities stationery from Rogers;
the letters inflated the values of customers' accounts. Authorities
allege that when a customer wanted confirmation of his account's
value, Armstrong would figure how much the client should have
earned under its agreement with Princeton, and then request that
Republic Securities issue a letter confirming that amount. Rogers
would then provide Princeton with that letter.
</P>
<P>
   If the actual balance in the investor's account was less than
the figure supplied by Princeton, funds from other accounts were
generally transferred to cover the shortfall, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the criminal charges, the Securities and Exchange
Commission filed a civil suit Monday against Armstrong and
Princeton Economics International alleging securities fraud. The
judge in the case froze the assets of both Armstrong and Princeton
Economics International and appointed a receiver for the company.
</P>
<P>
   The Commodity Futures Trading Commission also filed a complaint
alleging that Armstrong defrauded customers through material
misrepresentations. Neither Armstrong nor his firm was registered
as a commodity trading adviser, as is required.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. White said, in a statement: ``This case should send the
clear and concise message that those who commit securities fraud in
the United States, even if they use offshore entities and victimize
foreign investors, cannot escape responsibility for their
actions.''

CONGRESS HAD EVIDENCE OF TEAR GAS CANISTERS IN 1995, DEMOCRAT SAYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By RON HUTCHESON 
And GABRIELLE CRIST 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Congress was given evidence four years ago that pyrotechnic tear
gas canisters were used in the FBI raid on the Branch Davidian
compound in 1993, Democratic Rep. Henry Waxman of California said
on Monday. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   New Congressional investigations into the 1993 standoff were
triggered by recent news reports that the FBI had failed to
disclose the use of the military-style canisters until this year.
But Waxman said congressional investigators were told about the
canisters during the last round of investigations in 1995. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The documents repeatedly refer to military canisters without
specifically mentioning the possibility that they can generate
fire. No evidence has surfaced linking the tear gas to the fatal
fire, which the government says was started by Davidian leader
David Koresh and his followers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess, hypothetically, maybe the staffs read over these
documents and didn't understand the terms. Maybe they didn't think
much about it,'' Waxman said. ``But the facts seem to be that the
attorney general and her Department of Justice and the FBI sent the
Congress, in 1995, documents that military tear gas was used.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Waxman is ranking Democrat on the House Government Reform
Committee, chaired by Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., who said on Monday
that he is expanding his committee's new investigation of the
standoff to look into whether FBI snipers fired into the compound
on the final day of the standoff. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Burton announced the expansion of the investigation after the
Texas Rangers disclosed that they had collected a dozen spent rifle
casings from a house used by FBI snipers during the 1993 siege. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the evidence was far from conclusive because the same house
also was used by agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms during their firefight with sect members on the first day
of the standoff. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And the Rangers' report cites concerns raised not by the
Rangers, but by Colorado film researcher Mike McNulty, who last
year was allowed to review the evidence being held by the Texas
Department of Public Safety. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike McNulty has questioned .308 Winchester cases located at
the undercover house, which may show that the FBI snipers fired
rounds on 04-19-93,'' the report states. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FBI officials have repeatedly said that their agents did not
fire during the 51-day confrontation that ended when a devastating
fire roared through the compound. Koresh and about 80 of his
followers died in the siege. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Burton said the evidence gathered by the Texas Rangers ``raises
new concerns that require further investigation by Congress.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Other Justice Department critics said Waxman's findings
concerning the pyrotechnic tear gas canisters do not exonerate
Attorney General Janet Reno or her subordinates because federal
agents never highlighted the information. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1995, three days before the hearings, they dumped over
100,000 pages worth of documents on the committee staff,'' Burton
spokesman Mark Corallo said. ``I think it was up to them to point
it out to us.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Corallo also noted that Reno has said that she was unaware of
the incendiary canisters. Responding to news reports late last
month, Reno expressed outrage that she did not know about their use
in Waco. She had no immediate reaction to Waxman's disclosures. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The report from the Texas Rangers opens a new line of inquiry by
raising the possibility that FBI snipers shot at the Branch
Davidians. The Texas law enforcement agency released its report on
the Internet late Sunday after delivering copies of the document to
Burton's committee and independent investigator John Danforth. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers said in their report that they reviewed selected
items from the 24,000 pounds of evidence after questions were
raised about the use of the pyrotechnic canisters. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 11-page report contains highly technical information
that breaks down the type of casings found, the manufacturers who
produce the ammunition and quotations from manuals explaining the
chemical breakdown of various tear gas canisters found at the
scene. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One of the spent casings was from a 40mm cartridge reportedly
used to knock down a door so gas could be dispensed, the report
says. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And as was expected, the report confirms the FBI's use of the
pyrotechnic tear gas grenades, which burn at 500 to 700 degrees
Fahrenheit and can ignite flammable items. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The report repeatedly cites concerns raised by McNulty, a
longtime critic of the government's handling of the siege. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike McNulty has advised me that other evidence held by the
DPS is crucial to proving some of his suspicions that the FBI and
ATF have not been truthful in their account of the Branch Davidian
investigation,'' Rangers Sgt. Joey D. Gordon wrote. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For example, McNulty asserts that a blue knit cap worn by a
Davidian killed during the ATF raid might provide evidence that the
man was shot at close range, which contradicts reports by ATF
agents, who say he was shot from a distance. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers report includes several other photos and documents,
including a letter Assistant U.S. Attorney Bill Johnston wrote to
Attorney General Janet Reno in August in which he alleges a
government cover-up. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``... I have formed the belief that facts may have been kept
from you _ and quite possibly are being kept from you even now, by
components of the Department.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The report also includes a June 1999 interoffice memo from
Rangers Sgt. George L. Turner, who says he recovered a ``Thumper
Round'' from the scene, which was later identified as the 40mm
cartridge believed to have been used to knock down the door. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Thumper Round, which Turner's report says is highly
explosive, reportedly was fired by the FBI. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Turner notified Rangers and FBI officials of his findings, but
did not pursue the matter any further. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I never came forward with the information that would seem to
indicate that an explosive projectile was fired on April 19,
1993,'' Turner says in his memo. ``But I was never asked the
question. If I had been, I would have naturally responded with the
truth.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Turner said Rangers officials who testified in the 1995 Senate
subcommittee hearings were reminded of the ``possibility that an
explosive round having been fired.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Danforth, appointed last week by Reno to investigate the final
day of the siege, declined to comment on the Rangers' findings. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``He is no longer commenting on anything,'' an aide to the St.
Louis lawyer said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In a related matter, justice department attorneys asked on
Monday for a two-week extension in turning over information about
expert witnesses scheduled to testify at a lawsuit brought by
Branch Davidians, the Associated Press reported. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mike Caddell, lead attorney for the Branch Davidians, told AP
that while he does not object to the extension, it's another reason
to delay the trial set for Oct. 18. &QL;

used to knock down a door so gas could be dispensed, the report
says.
</P>
<P>
   And as was expected, the report confirms the FBI's use of the
pyrotechnic tear gas grenades, which burn at 500 to 700 degrees
Fahrenheit and can ignite flammable items.
</P>
<P>
   The report repeatedly cites concerns raised by McNulty, a
longtime critic of the government's handling of the siege.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike McNulty has advised me that other evidence held by the
DPS is crucial to proving some of his suspicions that the FBI and
ATF have not been truthful in their account of the Branch Davidian
investigation,'' Rangers Sgt. Joey D. Gordon wrote.
</P>
<P>
   For example, McNulty asserts that a blue knit cap worn by a
Davidian killed during the ATF raid might provide evidence that the
man was shot at close range, which contradicts reports by ATF
agents, who say he was shot from a distance.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers report includes several other photos and documents,
including a letter Assistant U.S. Attorney Bill Johnston wrote to
Attorney General Janet Reno in August in which he alleges a
government cover-up.
</P>
<P>
   ``... I have formed the belief that facts may have been kept
from you _ and quite possibly are being kept from you even now, by
components of the Department.''
</P>
<P>
   The report also includes a June 1999 interoffice memo from
Rangers Sgt. George L. Turner, who says he recovered a ``Thumper
Round'' from the scene, which was later identified as the 40mm
cartridge believed to have been used to knock down the door.
</P>
<P>
   The Thumper Round, which Turner's report says is highly
explosive, reportedly was fired by the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Turner notified Rangers and FBI officials of his findings, but
did not pursue the matter any further.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never came forward with the information that would seem to
indicate that an explosive projectile was fired on April 19,
1993,'' Turner says in his memo. ``But I was never asked the
question. If I had been, I would have naturally responded with the
truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner said Rangers officials who testified in the 1995 Senate
subcommittee hearings were reminded of the ``possibility that an
explosive round having been fired.''
</P>
<P>
   Danforth, appointed last week by Reno to investigate the final
day of the siege, declined to comment on the Rangers' findings.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is no longer commenting on anything,'' an aide to the St.
Louis lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   In a related matter, justice department attorneys asked on
Monday for a two-week extension in turning over information about
expert witnesses scheduled to testify at a lawsuit brought by
Branch Davidians, the Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Caddell, lead attorney for the Branch Davidians, told AP
that while he does not object to the extension, it's another reason
to delay the trial set for Oct. 18.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Walter Smith Jr. has not ruled on the
motion.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ A hurricane that meteorologists said was four times the
size of the infamous Andrew and potentially even more destructive
pounded toward Florida Monday, forcing 1 million from their homes
and leaving countless residents to hope that the massive storm
would somehow miss their cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``This hurricane,'' said Jerry Jarrell, director of the National
Hurricane Center, ``could be catastrophic.''
</P>
<P>
   From as far south as Miami to as far north as Cape Canaveral,
hundreds of thousands of people evacuated the densely populated
Florida coast as the storm, with winds of more than 155 mph, crept
westward across the Atlantic and forecasters' radar screens.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Jeb Bush declared a state of emergency late Monday,
mobilizing the National Guard and enhancing coordination among
towns and granting Florida emergency management head Joe Meyers
power over local authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like a giant bullseye out there,'' said Brad Cramer,
a lifeguard on Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   All day Monday, state meteorologists offered hope that Hurricane
Floyd would be nudged from its westerly course by a trough of low
pressure air moving to the east and southeast, and, instead of
making landfall in South Florida, travel up the coast, its
dangerous eye offshore.
</P>
<P>
   But that hope seemed to weaken by early Monday evening as Floyd
plowed west and slightly northwest, in the general direction of
Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the sort of the thing you have nightmares about,''
said Bill O'Brien, director of emergency management in Palm Beach
County.
</P>
<P>
   In a frightening scenario, the hurricane could turn north just
as the most powerful winds surrounding the eye make landfall,
sending the most destructive part of the hurricane along the coast,
meteorologists said.
</P>
<P>
   Like Andrew in 1992, which killed 40 people, left 160,000
homeless and caused more than $25 billion in damages, Floyd was a
Category 4 storm on Monday. It was on the verge of being a Category
5, the most powerful, as of Monday evening, with the power to turn
houses into rubble and splinters if it makes landfall.
</P>
<P>
   But Jarrell warned that even if the hurricane's eye stays as
much as 30 miles off the coast the storm could still rip roofs off
houses and flatten walls. Meteorologists called it a history-making
storm.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Gottschalck, a research associate in Meteorology at the
University of Miami's Rosentiel School of Marine and Atmospheric
Science, called it ``one of the largest and strongest storms'' in
history to hit the U.S. coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``It runs 700 miles in all directions,'' he said of the storm's
size, noting that the hurricane-force winds extend 120 miles from
its eye. ``We are going to feel it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasters, while warning that this hurricane was large and
powerful enough to overcome steering winds like the much-hoped-for
southeasterly front, still held some hope that the trough would
nudge it northeasterly.
</P>
<P>
   As night fell on South Florida, shelters and hotel rooms inland,
especially around Palm Beach, began to fill; cruise ships left for
safer waters to the south; long flotillas of pleasure craft snaked
along canals looking for safe harbor, as lines grew at hardware and
grocery stores.
</P>
<P>
   Because it was still too soon to more accurately estimate the
storm's landfall, the entire state of Florida was placed under a
hurricane warning. More than 200,000 people on Florida's
east-central coast were told to evacuate, and another 200,000 were
evacuated from coastal areas of Miami-Dade County.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Allen Fiske's boat is his home, and he was worried about losing
it as the storm drew closer. A paraplegic since a car accident 17
years ago, he lives aboard his 35-foot sailboat, ``Minimum
Balance.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what I'm going to do,'' he said. ``I can leave it
here at Dinner Key marina and let it get smashed into the pilings,
or I could take it up the Miami River along with everybody else and
let it get smashed against all the other boats. ``I'm leaning
toward going south, down to Key Largo.'' The Keys, he said, seem to
be the one place in Florida that are out of harm's way.
</P>
<P>
   While a few people said they thought the evacuations were
premature and a sign of media-driven panic, most people took the
threat seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have only been two other category 5 hurricanes to hit
the U.S. _ Camille in the 1960s and an unnamed storm in 1935,''
said Gottschalck. ``This kind of storm needs to be taken
seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   As far north as Jacksonville, people watched in amazement as the
huge storm swirled across television screens, larger than the state
it was approaching.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, my God,'' said Courtney Edwards, 17, as she saw maps of
the storm on a big-screen television in the electronics department
of a department store in Jacksonville.
</P>
<P>
   Further south, even people who lived miles inland considered
leaving their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did consider driving to Atlanta,'' said Bettye Cox, who
lives in Boca Raton. Instead, she just bought hurricane supplies.
</P>
<P>
   As the storm approached, the weather along the South Florida
beaches as far north as Palm Beach was balmy and breezy _ a perfect
day.
</P>
<P>
   Arturo Penalver, 65, a retired longshoreman from Brooklyn, took
a swim on Palm Beach. ``It's beautiful,'' said Penalver. ``I don't
believe it will come here.''
</P>
<P>
   Edmond Zion, a retired limo driver from Queens County, N.Y.,
also scoffed at the growing concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would think that people down here would be used to these
storms already,'' he said. ``They act like it's all new, like they
never heard of such a thing before.''
</P>
<P>
   But in this case, it may be true. This storm could be something
entirely new.
</P>
<P>
   As if the threat of this hurricane was not enough bad news for
Florida, another potentially dangerous storm, Hurricane Gert, seems
to be taking roughly the same path as Floyd, just a few days
behind.
</P>
<P>
   That storm, which developed into a full-fledged hurricane
Monday, was expected to push through the Leeward Islands, Virgin
Islands and Puerto Rico later this week, and _ if it stays on
course _ eventually threaten Florida or the east coast. Though not
as large as Floyd, Gert, the fifth hurricane of the season, was
expected to pound through the Atlantic with winds well over 100
mph.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Floyd is trouble enough.
</P>
<P>
   On ritzy Worth Avenue in Palm Beach, Susan Bryden and six
friends, visiting from Agawam, Mass., hurried through their
shopping to make an evening flight home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're leaving,'' said Ms. Bryden, as employees pulled shutters
down on the windows of Saks Fifth Avenue and Ralph Lauren, ``and
we're glad of it.''
</P>
<P>
   In Miami, the last cruise ship had lumbered out of the harbor by
6 p.m. Most workers had left downtown early. To the north, in Palm
Beach, workers cleared the last chairs off the beaches.
</P>
<P>
   Cramer, the lifeguard, has seen this deceptive calm before.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you live here, you get used to the idea of hurricanes,
but you respect them,'' he said. ``This one demands a lot of
respect.''

ARMED SERBS ARE BACK IN KOSOVO, NATO COMMANDER SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By CARLOTTA GALL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ Groups of Serbian paramilitaries are
infiltrating back into Kosovo from Serbia, apparently bent on
causing trouble three months after Serbian forces withdrew from the
province, NATO's supreme commander, Gen. Wesley Clark, said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am increasingly concerned by the evidence that we see of
organized Serb efforts to cause a little bit of disruption here and
there and bring increasing pressure on this fragile community,'' he
said during a visit to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Clark said that one of the three Serbs shot dead by Russian
peacekeepers in eastern Kosovo last week was carrying a police
identification card. Another was in a military-style uniform, a
spokesman for the peacekeepers said. The men were caught ambushing
a car and beating two Kosovo Albanians. When they opened fire on
the Russian troops, they were shot dead.
</P>
<P>
   The episode was one of a mounting number during the last few
weeks involving armed Serbs, particularly in areas near the border
with the rest of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Mitrovica, in the north, and Gniljane, in the east, are areas of
tension, where Serbs and Albanians clash frequently, and grenade
attacks and shootings are still common. Demonstrations by Serbs
have spread and appear to be more organized and confrontational, a
sign that they might be receiving help from Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Three Serbs were arrested on Sunday on the bridge that divides
the city of Mitrovica, two days after violent confrontations there,
Maj. Ole Irgens, a spokesman for the peacekeepers, said at a news
conference. The men were armed with a Kalashnikov rifle and hand
grenades.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have confirmed reports of groups of fighters in
military-style uniforms,'' he said. ``We have no specific evidence
of paramilitary activity but we certainly will not tolerate such
criminal activity.''
</P>
<P>
   Irgens also announced that NATO would begin training flights of
fighter jets over Kosovo. The exercises will include simulated
ground attacks, he said, but will be conducted well away from
population centers.
</P>
<P>
   Clark's comments and the peacekeepers' announcement appear
intended to remind the Yugoslav leadership in Belgrade that NATO is
in charge in Kosovo. Tensions have risen with the approach of next
Monday's deadline for disarming the Albanian rebel group, the
Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia has been pushing the peacekeepers to allow a limited
number of Serbian troops and police officers back into Kosovo to
guard the borders and holy sites, as stipulated in an agreement
signed at the end of the war, one senior peacekeeping official
said. But the peacekeepers have responded that their return is out
of the question until the Albanian rebels have been disarmed fully.
</P>
<P>
   Clark ruled out their return anytime soon. ``There'll be
discussion about which Serb personnel will come back in for
purposes of, let's say, de-mining, a presence at monuments, maybe a
presence at the border, but purely presence,'' he said in comments
reported by Reuters. ``This is not a re-entry of Serb forces.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue has become political in Belgrade _ a way for the
government to show that it is protecting Serbian interests. But
Irgens said that any return of Serbian personnel would have to be
coordinated with the peacekeepers, and that ``the time is not
right.''

LEO BURNETT IS REORGANIZING ITSELF ON TWO FRONTS

 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Leo Burnett Co. in Chicago, the agency company known for
warm, whimsical and character-driven campaigns for blue-chip brands
like Hallmark, Keebler, Kellogg and Maytag, is making two big
changes, a corporate reorganization and a realignment of senior
management.
</P>
<P>
   The changes are the most significant at Burnett since a palace
coup in March 1997 that toppled two top executives. That shake-up,
unprecedented for Burnett, came after difficulties that included
the loss of large creative accounts like Miller Lite beer as well
as large creative and media-services assignments for marketers like
United Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, there has been a marked upturn in Burnett's fortunes
_ fortuneately for Burnett, a privately held company that must
strive to keep up with bigger, publicly traded competitors like the
Interpublic Group of Companies, Omnicom Group and WPP Group PLC. A
good deal of the credit for the improvements goes to Richard B.
Fizdale, the chariman who retook the reins of power as chief
executive in the coup.
</P>
<P>
   Fizdale, a Burnetter since 1969, helped Burnett land additional
work from clients like Coca-Cola, Heinz and Procter &AMP; Gamble as
well as new accounts from advertisers like Delta Air Lines,
Motorola, G.D. Searle and Toys ``R'' Us.
</P>
<P>
   He also presided over the spinoff of Burnett's media services
operations as an autonomous unit, Starcom Worldwide; the
acquisition of a 49 percent stake in Bartle Bogle Hegarty, a
so-called creative hot shop, and the formation of specialty units
like Vigilante, for urban marketing; Lapiz, for campaigns aimed at
Hispanic consumers, and TFA/Leo Burnett Technology Group, for
high-technology clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was important to stop the bleeding,'' Fizdale said in a
telephone interview Monday after the changes were formally
announced.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nineteen-ninety-six was one of the worst years we've had, but
since 1997, we've won a lot of business,'' he added. ``And where
the agency did not have a global plan, we do now.''
</P>
<P>
   An agency's state of health is ``never perfect,'' Fizdale said,
``always fragile.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But there's a lot to feel really good about,'' he added,
seemingly undaunted even by a visit to the dentist before his
interview.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the shifts this time around are by all accounts
more characteristically Burnett-like: collegial, low key and
harmonious.
</P>
<P>
   Effective Jan. 1, Fizdale, 60, will again relinquish his duties
as chief executive _ for good, he promised, laughing that ``I
guarantee there will not be another coup unless it's to get rid of
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Fizdale will remain chairman for what he described as an
open-ended period, focusing on tasks like determining Burnett's
place in the digital and interactive media arenas.
</P>
<P>
   Roger A. Haupt, chief operating officer, will assume Fizdale's
duties as chief executive. Haupt, 51, who joined Burnett in 1984,
has been considered Fizdale's heir apparent, overseeing management
of the important Motorola and Procter &AMP; Gamble accounts in addition
to Burnett's administrative, financial and information technology
operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been working together a long time,'' Haupt said in a
separate interview, referring to his relationship with Fizdale,
``and we both feel pretty good about where we stand, the momentum
we have.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I will carry that on as aggressively as we have
been, becoming more diversified, more global. And there'll be more
innovation, I hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Haupt is considered one of the strongest supporters of plans by
Burnett to sell at least 10 percent of the agency to Dentsu Inc. in
Tokyo, the Japanese advertising giant. Those discussions continue;
an agreement is expected before the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the outcome of the talks, Burnett will remain an
independent, privately held company, Haupt said, adding: ``That
status is unchanged. And I don't have any plans to change it.''
</P>
<P>
   Also effective Jan. 1, Haupt will assume the additional duties
of president from James G. Oates, who will retire at the end of
1999. Oates, 56, had previously agreed to delay by two years his
departure from Burnett, where he has spent his entire 33-year
advertising career.
</P>
<P>
   Accompanying the management realignment is the formal adoption
of a holding company structure for Burnett, which is ranked No. 12
among the world's agency companies by billings, with an estimated
$7 billion, and No. 9 by revenue at $949.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   From now on, Leo Group will be the name of the ultimate parent
company, owning units like the Leo Burnett Co., specializing in
advertising, and Starcom, specializing in media services, and
managing the 49 percent stake in Bartle Bogle.
</P>
<P>
   Those inclined to make jokes about Leo Group ``roaring'' into
existence may do so here. The reference is of course not to the
M-G-M lion but to Leo Burnett, who founded Burnett in 1935 and was
named one of the most influential industry leaders of the century
by the trade publication Advertising Age.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to be Gizmo Inc. or Oxycon,'' Fizdale said,
adding: ``One day we were sitting around trying to come up with a
name for the holding company and someone _ Chris Kimball, I
believe, our chief administrative officer _ opined that if it's the
name of a person, it's easier to clear globally. So we said, `How
about Leo Group?' and it never changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Leo Burnett is known for a speech he gave in 1967 addressed to
his successors titled ``When To Take My Name Off the Door,''
admonishing them to adhere to his principles.
</P>
<P>
   Even though such abandonment of the founder's ways would now
require his name be scraped off two doors rather than one, there is
nothing to worry about, according to Fizdale: ``It's not time yet.
And it never will be.'' &QL;

   JAPANESE YEN RISES 2.2 PERCENT IN A RALLY AGAINST THE DOLLAR
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese yen resumed its more than two-month rally against
the dollar, jumping 2.2 percent to a three-year high. Analysts said
the rally should continue. In New York, the yen settled at 106.44
to the dollar, up from 108.81.
</P>
<P>
   The surge came after the Bank of Japan intervened in the
foreign-exchange market on Friday and staved off the rally for a
day. But the selling of yen for dollars worked for only one day
because Japanese officials made clear that they were not trying to
change the direction of the yen, only to slow its rise.

in merging voice, data and video applications and funneling them
directly into homes through one broadband cable device. Shares of
Motorola fell $8.375, to $90.375.
</P>
<P>
   STOCKS MIXED AS NASDAQ RETREATS
</P>
<P>
   Stocks ended mixed as investors stepped back from Friday's rally
in technology shares. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 1.90
points, to 11,030.33. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index fell
7.53 points, to 1,344.13, and the Nasdaq composite index fell 42.29

TEXAS RANGERS ISSUE REPORT ON SIEGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (With WACO-DOCUMENTS) 
(af) 
 By JIM YARDLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The report released Monday by the Texas Rangers
will not definitively answer any of the ``dark questions'' about
the Branch Davidian siege that John Danforth has promised to answer
in his independent investigation. But it makes plain the awkward
role facing the Rangers as the different Branch Davidian
investigations begin to gather steam.
</P>
<P>
   Initiated three months ago on orders from James B. Francis Jr.,
the chairman of the Texas Department of Public Safety, the Rangers
report was narrowly focused by design. Last month, a spokesman for
the Rangers, Mike Cox, pointedly said the agency was not
investigating the FBI or the Justice Department. Instead, Cox said,
the inquiry focused on key pieces of evidence believed to be
sitting inside state storage rooms in Austin and Waco.
</P>
<P>
   But nonetheless, the persistent probing of the Rangers and the
outspoken comments by Francis have played significant roles in
applying the pressure that has resulted in the new Washington
investigations into the 1993 events near Waco. Much of what was
included in Monday's inch-thick Ranger's report was not new: the
uncovering of a potentially flammable incendiary device had been
disclosed last month; the significance of rifle shells found inside
a house near the compound that had been used by the FBI Hostage
Rescue Team has been a subject of dispute for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a beginning rather than an end,'' said Michael Caddell,
the lawyer representing families of deceased Branch Davidian
members in a wrongful death lawsuit against the government. ``It is
the first time that any government officials have looked seriously
at these issues. I think it raises more questions than it
answers.''
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, where the Rangers, the state's top law-enforcement
agency, enjoy a nearly revered status as throwbacks to the state's
cowboy origins, the release of the report had been widely
anticipated as the renewed investigations into the siege dominated
local headlines and newscasts.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, The Austin American-Statesman obtained a copy on
Sunday, a day before the Rangers' planned to release it, after
filing a lawsuit Friday to force its immediate release.
</P>
<P>
   But the inquiry's narrow focus reinforces the uncomfortable
reality that the Rangers are potentially uncovering evidence that
could ultimately be used against the federal government in the
wrongful death lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers got into the case in 1993 at the behest of federal
prosecutors in Texas, who asked them to take charge of the crime
scene after the fire and collect evidence from the compound. The
evidence was then used by federal prosecutors in the 1994 criminal
cases against several Branch Davidian members who were convicted of
killing four agents with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms.
</P>
<P>
   For the last six years, an estimated 24,000 pounds of the
evidence has remained in storage rooms in Austin and Waco.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this summer, the Rangers asked the federal judge in the
wrongful death lawsuit to take control of all the evidence, a
motion the judge granted. Then, Francis, a political appointee of
Gov. George W. Bush, ordered an investigation into the evidence
itself after questions were raised by an independent filmmaker,
Michael McNulty, who had toured the storage rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Francis has questioned the role of the military on the day of
the fire. The Pentagon has said that three members of an elite
military unit were at the compound, as observers, on the day of the
fire. But a recent deposition filed by the Justice Department in
the civil lawsuit revealed that as many as 10 soldiers were present
at the compound at different times during the 51-day siege.

SPORTS COLUMN: AFTER MIRER, PARCELLS HAS DOUBTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ On the morning after one fateful step led to a
frightful snap, which begot much frustration and sorrow, Bill
Parcells made it clear that he was not exactly counting on Rick
Mirer to write a fantastic sequel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it was the situations,'' Parcells said Monday, when
asked about Mirer's less than scintillating career. ``We'll see.
I'll try to give him the best chance to be successful.''
</P>
<P>
   This didn't sound like a coach going out of his way to assure
his team that all was well, that Mirer could step in and be for the
Jets what Vinny Testaverde was last year. Despite the obvious
parallels of underachievement elsewhere, despite Testaverde's sunny
assessment of Mirer's ``identical'' circumstances to his own last
fall, Parcells' queasy expressions and coach's careful-speak were
an admonishment against trying to anticipate Mirer into something
he's not.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells, remember, recruited Testaverde before the 1998 season
because he never believed Glenn Foley had the body to survive. When
he spoke of Testaverde last summer, he frequently endorsed his size
and skills. He cited Testaverde's playoff run in Cleveland, his Pro
Bowl season in Baltimore. You suspected Parcells strongly believed
the veteran from Long Island could flourish with the offensive
weaponry the Jets had assembled.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see,'' was the best he could do on the sudden hot
subject of Mirer, the 1993 rookie of the year in Seattle, who was
also unceremoniously dumped by the punchless Bears.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's right to assume that, offensively, we're
not going to function,'' Parcells also said Monday, as the Jets
regrouped for re-evaluation, after being sacked Sunday on first
down, by fate. On the other hand, for those wishing to second-guess
Parcells for being caught in the predicament of not having a
trustworthy backup with the benefit of a full training camp, he
pointed out that he had pursued early-summer deals for Eric Zeier
and Rodney Peete. Which I guess could also be interpreted as
Parcells' admitting that Mirer was not even on his radar screen
until The Great Zolak and Ray from Rutgers had been ordained
preseason flops.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just can't dial a quarterback into the system,'' Parcells
said, although his SOS to Ron Wolf, his buddy in Green Bay, did
result in the routing of Mirer to Weeb Ewbank Hall.
</P>
<P>
   To his credit, Parcells did not blame the artificial turf at
Giants Stadium for Testaverde's torn Achilles' tendon. But then,
how could he? He has always said he prefers grass, but has also
rejected the notion of being ``part of any experiment'' that might
result in the Jets playing on a bad grass field, which, he argued,
is worse. The result is that Wayne Chrebet is out six weeks, Leon
Johnson for the season and Testaverde for who knows how long after
that?
</P>
<P>
   Of course grass should be installed, turf qualifying as a
serious workplace abuse the players' union should have taken on
years ago. Yet Dan Marino suffered the same Achilles' injury, on
grass. This is what usually happens, almost inexplicably, in the
bodies of men and women past their athletic primes.
</P>
<P>
   Is there a doctor out there who can accurately advise Patrick
Ewing how much rest it will take before his feet are pain free? Who
can assure David Cone that his right arm won't play dead when
post-season comes? Testaverde. Ewing. Cone. That's merely the Super
Bowl, National Basketball Association finals and World Series
perhaps turning on the health of three 30-something stars.
</P>
<P>
   In a season that begins with the return of the pitiful and
futile instant replay, the Testaverde injury is also a jarring
reminder that human frailty cannot be legislated out of sports. ``I
just pushed off to go get the ball,'' said Testaverde, a class act,
even hours out of surgery that cut away his dream. ``My last
thought was, `My Achilles popped and I'm out for the season.'''
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde out. Mirer, for now at least, in.
</P>
<P>
   In New England six years ago, Parcells took Drew Bledsoe first
in the draft over Mirer, who went second. Parcells, who rode
Bledsoe to a Super Bowl, made the right choice there, as he made
with Testaverde over Foley here. Then came Sunday, Bledsoe and the
Patriots, Giants Stadium, Testaverde and Mirer, Parcells at one of
those mysterious intersections of yesterdays that he has always
navigated so well.
</P>
<P>
   Is this the one where his reputation finally takes a hit, or
even crashes and burns? Or does he make something out of Mirer and
become a bigger genius than ever?
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see,'' said Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   The coach, for once, has no clue. &QL;

<P>
   GALVESTON, Texas _ A Louisiana pilot glided his disabled Cessna
175 airplane several miles before crash-landing in calm surf before
noon Monday on Galveston's beachfront.
</P>
<P>
   Adrian Bennett Cairns Jr., 65, of Covington, La., and a
passenger walked away uninjured from the crash, which ended with
the airplane upside down in shallow water, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looked like he was going to the sand, but there were people
there and he moved back over the water,'' said Galveston Beach
Patrol lifeguard Tony Pryor. ``He was in a gradual incline and he
hit the water, and it slowly flipped him over on the top side.''
</P>
<P>
   Cairns, who was identified as the pilot by the Texas Department
of Public Safety, was unavailable for comment late Monday. The DPS
did not have the name of the passenger.
</P>
<P>
   Galveston International Airport interim director Hud Hopkins
said Cairns told him the passenger was his sister and the two were
traveling to Galveston to visit a relative. Hopkins did not have
the sister's name.
</P>
<P>
   Hopkins said Cairns confirmed Pryor's assessment of the landing.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were too many tourists on the beach to make a landing
without injuring anybody; so he put it in over the water a
little,'' Hopkins said. ``As soon as he touched water, he flipped
over. But they were completely fine, other than being shaken up.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``It's pretty incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pryor said he first noticed the airplane as it passed his
lifeguard stand. The plane was silent as it swept down the beach
and landed four blocks away, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he did a real good job of landing it, because he
avoided people, and it looked pretty much under control,'' said
Pryor, the first person to reach the overturned plane. ``By the
time I got there, they were both out and going back in getting
stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were real calm,'' Pryor said, adding that the top of the
cockpit was barely underwater in the surf.
</P>
<P>
   Cairns radioed a ``mayday'' minutes before the crash, according
to one person who monitored radio traffic among pilots in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Cairns told other pilots in the area his engine failed, he was
four or five miles from the Galveston airport and he did not expect
to make it to a runway.
</P>
<P>
   At least three helicopter pilots in the area began looking for
the disabled plane when the emergency call went out and one was
shepherding the aircraft when it hit the beach and rolled over,
witnesses said. The plane was flying parallel to the beachfront,
they said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Federal Aviation Administration investigators were at the crash
scene and were inspecting the airplane in a hanger after it was
hauled off the beach and lifted up over the city's seawall.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said the plane's propeller and nose appeared to have
suffered the most damage from the crash-landing but the aircraft's
fuselage and a wing were broken in half during the salvage
operation.
</P>
<P>
   Hopkins said FAA officials plan to examine the engine this week
to find out why it quit running. The plane belonged to Cairns,
Hopkins said.

MICROSOFT STARTS THE RECRUITING FOR ITS NEXT WAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By STEVE LOHR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The browser war may be a memory, but executives
of the Microsoft Corp. conceded Monday that the company now faces
an even greater challenge in the next phase of the Internet's
evolution, as the role of traditional desktop software recedes and
the power center of computing shifts from the operating system to
the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   Software is increasingly becoming a Web-based service whose main
goal is to hasten the spread of electronic commerce over the
Internet. At an event here to sketch out in broad strokes
Microsoft's technical blueprint for Web software, the company's
president, Steven Ballmer, gave his most candid appraisal to date
of the hurdle his company faces.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are at an inflection point,'' Ballmer said, adding that the
Web strategy announced Monday was ``as important if not more
important'' than plans the company detailed for the browser market
in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll either come through this period with a strong following
or we'll be in trouble,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ballmer spoke at a conference here that marks the start of a
stepped-up drive by Microsoft to persuade software developers to
use its technology for building Web-based applications and
Internet-based commerce services. The company is positioning this
shift as a way for personal computer software to embrace the
Internet and is promoting its Windows DNA 2000 family of products.
</P>
<P>
   An initiative that includes several products scheduled to be
introduced in the next 18 months, Windows DNA 2000 is being billed
by Microsoft as a ``comprehensive platform that enables the Web
applications and services of tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   But to date, those are only words _ and the notion of a single
company establishing a software ``platform,'' or standard, that
becomes dominant will be difficult, if even possible, in the
diverse world of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, of course, controls the dominant software standard in
the personal computer industry with its Windows operating system,
which runs on 90 percent of PC's sold today. In the past, outside
software developers had little choice but to write their programs
to run on Microsoft's technology.
</P>
<P>
   But the basic technology standards on the Web are openly
available and not controlled by any single company. So Microsoft
has a much tougher job on its hands in trying to persuade software
developers to use its software for Web applications and Internet
commerce services.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a new world in a sense,'' said Tod Nielsen, a Microsoft
vice president in the developers division. ``It used to be our
sandbox _ people wrote to the Windows API,'' or applications
programming interface, the software hooks that other programs must
use to run smoothly on the operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft executives also conceded that the company has not yet
determined what its business model will be for making money as
software moves from desktop products to Web-based services.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't know yet,'' Ballmer replied in response to a question on
the subject. ``But if you wait to have a business model in place,
you'll be the last guy in the marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the broad outlines of Microsoft's strategy were presented
Monday. For software programmers, Microsoft promises to deliver an
array of development tools and a full range of products to simplify
the writing of Internet applications.
</P>
<P>
   The products start with Windows 2000, a major overhaul of the
Windows NT operating system for corporate environments, which is
expected to be shipped later this year. Among other things, Windows
2000 is intended to help Microsoft compete against Sun Microsystems
and IBM in supplying the robust software needed to run the powerful
computers that serve up e-commerce Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   The company also briefed software developers on several other
products, expected to be shipped by the middle of next year,
including Microsoft Appcenter, software for running Web
applications on centralized data centers, or ``server farms.'' Most
other announcements concerned incorporating Windows DNA 2000
technology in new versions of its current products, like electronic
commerce and data-base software.
</P>
<P>
   To create its Web platform, Microsoft is using an Internet
standard known as Extensible Markup Language, or XML, in its new
offerings. XML opens the way to place more automated intelligence
in software by identifying, tagging and interpreting the kinds of
data in, say, an e-mail message or on a Web site.
</P>
<P>
   In one demonstration Monday, Microsoft showed how a program
using XML could be added to calendar software so it not only looks
ahead to alert the user of his wedding anniversary, but also links
to shopping software that includes his wife's gift preferences and
favorite stores.
</P>
<P>
   XML is an open industry standard. But the Microsoft pitch to
software developers is that such Web-based services will work best
if they use Microsoft's software and tools. Its different software
products, Microsoft says, will operate with the software of rivals,
but they will work better the more Microsoft software is used.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does restrict some of their choice, but we're getting rid
of some of the complexity for them,'' said Paul Maritz, group vice
president of Microsoft's developer group. ``And we think there's
value for that, and we charge for it _ but that's true for other
major software companies too, not just Microsoft.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, some analysts say, Microsoft's strategy amounts to an
effort to control the standards for the Internet. ``The pure XML
standard available to everyone is one thing, but if most people use
Microsoft's XML implementations they become the baseline
standard,'' said Jeffrey Tarter, editor of Softletter, an industry
newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, it may be more difficult for Microsoft to seize the
Internet standards,'' Tarter added, ``but they have 15 or 20 years
of experience of gaining control of standards in computing. They're
good at it.''

<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ After fighting off a hostile takeover for
the last two months, Elf Aquitaine SA of France capitulated Monday
and agreed to be acquired for roughly $48.8 billion by a domestic
rival, Total Fina SA.
</P>
<P>
   If completed, the deal would create the world's fourth-largest
oil company _topped only by the proposed Exxon-Mobil combination;
the Anglo-Dutch oil giant Royal Dutch/Shell; and the planned merger
of BP Amoco and ARCO.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement announced Monday is another milestone in Europe's
fast-changing corporate culture. It is the Continent's second huge
hostile takeover in the last few months, following Olivetti SpA's
successful $65 billion bid for Telecom Italia.
</P>
<P>
   It was also the first time a big European company invoked a
``Pac-Man'' takeover defense, in which a company tries to acquire
the company that wants to acquire it.
</P>
<P>
   Both Elf and Total Fina had acknowledged for weeks that they
would merge in one form or another. The big questions were who
would be in charge and whose strategy would prevail.
</P>
<P>
   The clear victor Monday was Thierry Desmarest, the chairman of
Total Fina, who surprised Elf with a hostile bid worth nearly $43
billion on July 5.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal reached Monday, after a long weekend of
bargaining, Total Fina sweetened its all-stock offer by about $6
billion. Desmarest will run the combined company and the chairman
of Elf, Philippe Jaffre, will step down.
</P>
<P>
   The new price works out to about 190 euros, or about $197.60,
for each Elf share, compared with about 170 euros a share in
Total's original bid. Shares of Elf jumped 3.15 percent, to 186.5
euros, after Monday's announcement, while Total Fina slipped
four-tenths of 1 percent, to 129.5 euros.
</P>
<P>
   The companies also appear to be following Desmarest's basic
strategy, which was to retain control of the two companies'
chemical operations. In his counterbid against Total Fina, Jaffre
had proposed spinning off most of the chemical operations and
focusing more closely on the oil business.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement came after two months of tense struggle between
the executives of the companies, whose headquarters are within a
short walk of each other near La Defense, a huge office and
shopping complex, in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Desmarest, who had met with Jaffre occasionally over lunch,
began his unsolicited bid after failing to persuade his rival that
the acceleration of oil-industry mergers made a merger of their two
companies logical.
</P>
<P>
   Jaffre quickly denounced the bid as both hostile and inadequate,
and then fired back a few weeks later with his own plan.
</P>
<P>
   The French government, which once owned Elf, played an important
role by refusing to interfere with Total Fina's offer and quietly
warning Elf not to seek a foreign partner as a ``white knight.''
</P>
<P>
   That severely limited Jaffre's options. More than a month ago,
he had made it clear he was willing to compromise to get a peaceful
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies began serious negotiating late last week and
worked through the weekend, company executives said.
</P>
<P>
   Edouard de Royere, a former president of Air Liquide and a
friend of both Jaffre's and Desmarest's, acted as a mediator.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the negotiations were handled by two board members from
each company. Total Fina's team included Serge Tchuruk, chairman of
the electronics conglomerate Alcatel SA and Desmarest's predecessor
at Total Fina; and Jerome Monod, chairman of Suez Lyonnaise des
Eaux, the large French utility.
</P>
<P>
   Elf's team was led by Michel Pebereau, chairman of Banque
Nationale de Paris, and Bertrand Collomb, chairman of La Farge SA,
one of France's biggest producers of construction material.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Monday in Paris, Jaffre appeared tired but
sought to put the best possible light on things. He noted that
Total Fina was now offering a significantly higher premium for Elf
_ 26 percent over Elf's stock price on July 2, just before the
original offer, versus just 15 percent earlier.
</P>
<P>
   He also said the agreement would create a French oil company
with enough influence to compete with the giants in today's
markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``This deal creates a major French champion in both oil and
chemicals,'' Jaffre said. It ``assures a great future for a company
that holds a very great place in the history of France,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Desmarest, smiling broadly as he took the lead in outlining the
agreement Monday, insisted he was not interested in ``size for
size's sake.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said the company needed more scale to keep up. ``When we
examine our competitors, they are even larger,'' he said. ``That's
why we feel a small push in the race for expansion.''
</P>
<P>
   Desmarest said the merger would produce annual savings of about
1.5 billion euros, or about $1.56 billion. The companies plan to
eliminate about 2,000 jobs in France, but they said those
reductions would be made through early retirement, attrition and
voluntary incentives.
</P>
<P>
   The deal announced Monday was the latest in a series of brash
moves that have distinguished Desmarest since he took command
several years ago of what was then called Total SA.
</P>
<P>
   Though educated in France's best schools, he spent years in the
oilfields. He infuriated the American government two years ago by
signing an oil deal with Iran. This year he took over Petrofina SA,
a big Belgian oil company, which promptly put his company in the
same ranks as Elf Aquitaine.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Desmarest suggested he was still on the lookout for
potential acquisitions, saying he would not ``close the door'' on
other deals. &QL;

SPORTS COLUMN: AFTER MIRER, PARCELLS HAS DOUBTS 
</HEADLINE>
 repeating to fix coding  (ms) 
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ On the morning after one fateful step led to a
frightful snap, which begot much frustration and sorrow, Bill
Parcells made it clear that he was not exactly counting on Rick
Mirer to write a fantastic sequel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it was the situations,'' Parcells said Monday, when
asked about Mirer's less than scintillating career. ``We'll see.
I'll try to give him the best chance to be successful.''
</P>
<P>
   This didn't sound like a coach going out of his way to assure
his team that all was well, that Mirer could step in and be for the
Jets what Vinny Testaverde was last year. Despite the obvious
parallels of underachievement elsewhere, despite Testaverde's sunny
assessment of Mirer's ``identical'' circumstances to his own last
fall, Parcells' queasy expressions and coach's careful-speak were
an admonishment against trying to anticipate Mirer into something
he's not.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells, remember, recruited Testaverde before the 1998 season
because he never believed Glenn Foley had the body to survive. When
he spoke of Testaverde last summer, he frequently endorsed his size
and skills. He cited Testaverde's playoff run in Cleveland, his Pro
Bowl season in Baltimore. You suspected Parcells strongly believed
the veteran from Long Island could flourish with the offensive
weaponry the Jets had assembled.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see,'' was the best he could do on the sudden hot
subject of Mirer, the 1993 rookie of the year in Seattle, who was
also unceremoniously dumped by the punchless Bears.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's right to assume that, offensively, we're
not going to function,'' Parcells also said Monday, as the Jets
regrouped for re-evaluation, after being sacked Sunday on first
down, by fate. On the other hand, for those wishing to second-guess
Parcells for being caught in the predicament of not having a
trustworthy backup with the benefit of a full training camp, he
pointed out that he had pursued early-summer deals for Eric Zeier
and Rodney Peete. Which I guess could also be interpreted as
Parcells' admitting that Mirer was not even on his radar screen
until The Great Zolak and Ray from Rutgers had been ordained
preseason flops.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just can't dial a quarterback into the system,'' Parcells
said, although his SOS to Ron Wolf, his buddy in Green Bay, did
result in the routing of Mirer to Weeb Ewbank Hall.
</P>
<P>
   To his credit, Parcells did not blame the artificial turf at
Giants Stadium for Testaverde's torn Achilles' tendon. But then,
how could he? He has always said he prefers grass, but has also
rejected the notion of being ``part of any experiment'' that might
result in the Jets playing on a bad grass field, which, he argued,
is worse. The result is that Wayne Chrebet is out six weeks, Leon
Johnson for the season and Testaverde for who knows how long after
that?
</P>
<P>
   Of course grass should be installed, turf qualifying as a
serious workplace abuse the players' union should have taken on
years ago. Yet Dan Marino suffered the same Achilles' injury, on
grass. This is what usually happens, almost inexplicably, in the
bodies of men and women past their athletic primes.
</P>
<P>
   Is there a doctor out there who can accurately advise Patrick
Ewing how much rest it will take before his feet are pain free? Who
can assure David Cone that his right arm won't play dead when
post-season comes? Testaverde. Ewing. Cone. That's merely the Super
Bowl, National Basketball Association finals and World Series
perhaps turning on the health of three 30-something stars.
</P>
<P>
   In a season that begins with the return of the pitiful and
futile instant replay, the Testaverde injury is also a jarring
reminder that human frailty cannot be legislated out of sports. ``I
just pushed off to go get the ball,'' said Testaverde, a class act,
even hours out of surgery that cut away his dream. ``My last
thought was, `My Achilles popped and I'm out for the season.'''
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde out. Mirer, for now at least, in.
</P>
<P>
   In New England six years ago, Parcells took Drew Bledsoe first
in the draft over Mirer, who went second. Parcells, who rode
Bledsoe to a Super Bowl, made the right choice there, as he made
with Testaverde over Foley here. Then came Sunday, Bledsoe and the
Patriots, Giants Stadium, Testaverde and Mirer, Parcells at one of
those mysterious intersections of yesterdays that he has always
navigated so well.
</P>
<P>
   Is this the one where his reputation finally takes a hit, or
even crashes and burns? Or does he make something out of Mirer and
become a bigger genius than ever?
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see,'' said Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   The coach, for once, has no clue. &QL;

ESTES ON TAP, IF NECESSARY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM MCCABE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ It was love at first sight, but whether Bob
Estes gets another date with The Country Club depends on another
love _ Davis Love.
</P>
<P>
   All indications are that Love will be healthy enough to play in
next week's Ryder Cup matches, but if he isn't, Estes _ as the 11th
player in the standings _ would get the call. And to prepare for
his role as pinch hitter, Estes got a tour of the course Monday. He
played a crisp three-hour round with Don Callahan, the director of
golf at TCC.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my kind of course,'' said the 33-year-old Estes, who tied
for 15th at the Canadian Open Sunday. ``I like older, more
traditional-styled courses, where it's more about position than
brute strength.''
</P>
<P>
   Love, who has played on three Ryder Cup teams and provides
valuable experience for captain Ben Crenshaw, was diagnosed Aug. 29
with a pinched nerve in his back a day after the NEC Invitational.
He hasn't played since, as doctors advised him to rest.
</P>
<P>
   Vernon Spratley of Pros Inc., indicated last week that Love
would be ready for the Ryder Cup, and a call to that office Monday
confirmed that that is still the case.
</P>
<P>
   Estes understands the situation, and that there is no timetable.
If Love is ready, he said, that is best for everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``After all, he's the fourth-ranked player in the world,'' said
Estes. ``We need him.''
</P>
<P>
   If not the Ryder Cup, Estes will head to the Texas Open in San
Antonio, which is a pleasant thought, since that's where he secured
his only PGA Tour win, in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like I'm in a bad position,'' said Estes. ``I'm not
stressed out about it.''

necklace was created in 1997 in the London workshop of Asprey &AMP;
Garrard, jewelers to members of the royal family since 1843. It was
worn by Diana at a gala performance of Swan Lake in London just
weeks before her fatal crash. At the time of her death, Diana had
not yet bought the necklace and Asprey &AMP; Garrard reclaimed it,
placing it back in the showcase which was later sold to an

worn by Diana at a gala performance of Swan Lake in London just
weeks before her fatal crash. At the time of her death, Diana had
not yet bought the necklace and Asprey &AMP; Garrard reclaimed it,
placing it back in the showcase which was later sold to an
undiscloed buyer. The matching earings were made later and were not
worn by Diana. (Frances Roberts/New York Times Photo) LITE

LOUISIANA PILOT LANDS DISABLED PLANE IN GALVESTON SURF 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Attn: La.) 
(Eds.: Updates throughout, quotes from pilot) 
 
By KEVIN MORAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GALVESTON, Texas _ A Louisiana pilot glided his disabled Cessna
175 airplane several miles before crash-landing Monday in calm surf
on Galveston's beachfront.
</P>
<P>
   Avoiding the beach because he saw people there, the pilot,
Adrian Bennett Cairns Jr., 65, a physician from Covington, La., and
his only passenger walked away uninjured from the crash, which
ended with the airplane upside down in shallow water.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel incredibly fortunate neither I nor my sister were
injured at all,'' Cairns said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had shoulder harnesses on and we were strapped in pretty
good, and I feel sure the harnesses kept us both from being hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Cairns and his sister, Mary Sue Lanaux of Mandeville, La., were
flying to Galveston International Airport. He said they were
approaching the eastern end of Galveston Island when the trouble
began.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked down at the ferry coming in and commented on what a
beautiful sight that was and the engine hiccouphed'' he said.
``About a minute later it quit.''
</P>
<P>
   Cairns said the engine restarted once and then died for good. He
switched fuel tanks to see if there was a fuel problem and that
made no difference. By then, he was over the city and decided to
head for the beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, I didn't want to stay over land because I didn't
want to take the chance on running out of air speed before I got to
the airport and taking out somebody's house or running into someone
on the street or ramming a building. So I thought the safest place
to be was out over the water.''
</P>
<P>
   Once over the water, he turned along the beachfront toward the
airport, gliding as far as he could.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got everything I could out of it,'' he said. ``I thought I
might be able to make it to the airport.
</P>
<P>
   An aerobatic pilot, Cairns said that experience helped him
maneuver the plane. When he saw people on the beach, he decided to
land in the water. As soon as his wheels touched down, the plane
flipped he said.
</P>
<P>
   Galveston Beach Patrol lifeguard Tony Pryor saw the landing:
``He was in a gradual incline and he hit the water, and it slowly
flipped him over on the top side.''
</P>
<P>
   The plane was silent as it swept down the beach and landed four
blocks away, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he did a real good job of landing it, because he
avoided people and it looked pretty much under control,'' said
Pryor, the first person to reach the overturned plane. ``By the
time I got there, they were both out and going back in getting
stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were real calm,'' Pryor said, adding that the top of the
cockpit was barely underwater in the calm surf.
</P>
<P>
   Cairns, who radioed a ``mayday'' minutes before the crash, said
later that his plane has a new engine, but he has no idea what
caused the failure.
</P>
<P>
   At least three helicopter pilots in the area began looking for
the disabled plane when the emergency call went out and one was
shepherding the aircraft when it hit the beach and rolled over.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Aviation Administration investigators were at the crash
scene and were inspecting the airplane in a hanger after it was
hauled off the beach and lifted up over the city's seawall.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said the plane's propeller and nose appeared to have
suffered the most damage from the crash landing but the aircraft's
fuselage and a wing were broken in half during the salvage
operation.
</P>
<P>
   Galveston International Airport interim director Hud Hopkins
said FAA officials plan to examine the engine this week to find out
why it quit running.
</P>
<P>
   Cairns and his sister remained in Galveston on Monday night to
visit a brother, Robert Cairns of Houston, who is in John Sealy
Hospital for surgery. The pilot noted that he had cancer surgery
himself in Galveston five years ago
</P>
<P>
   Apparently his decision to avoid a beach landing was not lost on
others.
</P>
<P>
   As he walked up the steps from the beach to the seawall, a
couple who had been on the beach said simply: ``Thank you.''

worn by Diana at a gala performance of Swan Lake in London just
weeks before her fatal crash. At the time of her death, Diana had
not yet bought the necklace and Asprey &AMP; Garrard reclaimed it,
placing it back in the showcase which was later sold to an
undiscloed buyer. The matching earings were made later and were not
worn by Diana. (Frances Roberts/New York Times Photo) LITE

 &HT;    Detailed notes tell story of vote-buying in Atlanta Olympic bid
 &HT;    (EDS: Moving in (w) Washington and (s) Sports categories.)By
Melissa Turner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Atlanta Olympic organizers meticulously compiled
information about the International Olympic Committee members who
held the key to riches for their city. No personal detail was too
insignificant or, apparently, too sleazy to go unrecorded.
</P>
<P>
   From the shoe sizes of the wives of the IOC delegates to the
brand of beer they favored was duly noted, filed away and reprised
when planning for the IOC members' visit to the city or selecting
gifts to deliver to their hotel rooms.
</P>
<P>
   And now the dossiers compiled by Olympic organizers and stored
away in three dozen boxes of files currently being scrutinized by
congressional investigators are creating a national furor.
</P>
<P>
   According to congressional investigators, the files contain
lists of IOC members whose votes can be bought and suggestions
about the sexual appetites and preferences of some of the members.
</P>
<P>
   For months Atlantans have been made aware of sordid details of
the bid effort and the committee's denials of wrongdoing. Now CNN,
NBC and Newsweek have produced reports on what the newsweekly
labeled ``the shady side of the modern Olympic movement.''
</P>
<P>
   And U.S. Rep. Fred Upton, the Michigan Republican who is
chairman of the House Commerce Committee's subcommittee on
oversight and investigations, is making the rounds. Starting with
CNN and NBC's Today program, he declared the files ``contain quite
a bit of damaging and troubling evidence'' that suggests ``a
pattern of buying votes'' by the Atlanta Olympic committee.
</P>
<P>
   Upton told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution on Monday that he is
planning public hearings to air Atlanta's dirty Olympic laundry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is there anyone out there who doesn't think what they did was
unethical or improper?'' the congressman asked. ``I don't think any
of this would pass the smell test from the get-go.''
</P>
<P>
   While the dossiers might make for spicy melodrama, they don't
seem to make a case for the kind of outright bribery that has come
to light in the Salt Lake City vote-buying scandal. And that is
primarily what the congressional committee is looking for in its
investigation of the Atlanta effort.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the ``IOC profile'' on Prince Albert of Monaco, one
of the more noteworthy delegates, suggested he ``likes the good
life, wine, women'' and added that his ``visit to Atlanta should be
low-key with press but an all-out orgy.''
</P>
<P>
   And, indeed, the prince and his entourage were shown a good time
during his August 1989 visit. Several private parties were held in
his honor, bags of gifts left in his hotel room. One party was in
Bob Holder's penthouse Park Place apartment, another at country
music legend Kenny Rogers' ranch. After dinner one evening the
Atlanta bid committee rented a private room at a nightclub for
late-night revelry.
</P>
<P>
   When Sinan Erdem, the former volleyball player and IOC member
from Turkey, came for his visit, a private party at a Buckhead home
was planned. A bid committee member dropped a letter to the party's
hosts, Joe and Patty Thomas, offering tips for a successful
evening, which included supplying ``plenty of vodka and invite the
wildest people you know, followed by a trip to the Gold Club after
dinner.'' The Gold Club features nude dancers.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy of gathering personal information on IOC members
and then using it to secure their bids, according to Upton, ``has a
fairly large taint of sleaze. It is pretty disgusting.''
</P>
<P>
   Bid committee spokesman Lee Echols defends the practice.
``Bidding for the Olympic Games was akin to creating a new business
and any new business must conduct research about its product and
audience before it gets off the ground,'' Echols said.
</P>
<P>
   Upton says it's a dirty business that has to stop. ``We need to
have legislation on the books to require it to stop,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Upton points in particular to the fat file folders compiled on
each IOC member that fill more than three large cardboard file
boxes. The folders contain copies of correspondence and memorandums
referencing the delegates. Stapled to the inside cover of each
folder is a list of the dozens of gifts received by the delegate
and the dates they were given.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the folders also contain single-page dossiers, written
by an Atlanta bid team member. The profiles include basic
biographical detail, along with the names of family members, the
dates they visited Atlanta and dates bid team members visited them
in their home countries. They also contain ``personal
information,'' which described their likes and dislikes and
personality quirks. A snapshot of the IOC member, sometimes with a
spouse, was usually attached to the profile.
</P>
<P>
   More often than not, the profiles were superficial. About Juge
Keba Mbaye of Senegal, one of the most influential members of the
IOC, the bid team wrote: ``Considered by all African IOC members to
be their chief, the leader of them all. A very important and
influential member in the eyes of other African IOC members. A very
warm person with an almost regal carriage . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the profile of Jean-Claude Ganga of the Congo, who
has been expelled from the IOC as the worst offender in the Salt
Lake City vote-buying scandal. His dossier hints at the Atlanta bid
team's all-out effort to secure his vote:
</P>
<P>
   ``Very active in anti-apartheid movement, a political animal. A
very, very important ally and a very good friend of Atlanta. He is
very proud of his association with us especially his relations with
(former mayors) Andy Young and Maynard Jackson . . . Ganga is a
very intelligent man, very politically astute, and a real
character. He will always have a personal interest in Atlanta's
success.''
</P>
<P>
   Ganga scored well in Atlanta. The bid committee has admitted to
donating at least $30,000 worth of sports equipment and clothing to
Ganga's National School and University Games in the Congo. They
also paid $15,000 _ at Ganga's request _ to send two teenagers from
the Congo to the prestigious Nick Bolitteri tennis camp in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   But what seems to disturb Rep. Upton and the Commerce Committee
investigators more are a separate set of profiles, also typically a
single page in length and written by a member of the Anchorage,
Alaska, Olympic bid committee, which lost in its quest to land a
Winter Olympics. These profiles, commissioned by the Atlanta
committee, were more personal and often scurrilous, and offered a
strategy for securing the individual members' votes.
</P>
<P>
   One profile noted that ``Gifts are OK. Gifts of female OK'' for
one delegate from Africa. Another member is ``very influential with
the IOC, has reputation as a sadist.'' About the IOC delegate from
Cameroon, who is a surgeon, it was suggested to use Young, a former
ambassador to the United Nations, in the sales pitch and include
visits to medical facilities and show him ``what the medical
community can deliver to Cameroon. A good shot at getting his
support. Work him hard.''
</P>
<P>
   The bid team was told not to waste too much effort on the member
from Cuba: ``Nice enough but no matter how he feels about a city
Castro tells him how to vote.''
</P>
<P>
   They found that the late Louis Guirandou N'diaye of the Ivory
Coast ``loves honors and flattery from women.'' In its own
research, the Atlanta bid team filled out his profile with ``loves
deferential treatment . . . smokes cigars and while he did not
drink alcohol in Atlanta he did drink wine and champagne in
Barcelona when his wife was not with him. He had dental work done
when he was in Atlanta.''
</P>
<P>
   And even though Juan Antonio Samaranch, the IOC president, did
not vote, the Atlanta bid team knew they had to take special care
of his wife when she visited the city with her husband and later
with two friends. Billy Payne wrote several memos instructing his
underlings how to treat Mrs. Samaranch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mrs. Samaranch does not like adhering to his very tight
schedule and prefers to shop,'' Payne wrote in February 1990.
``Line up Saks and Lord &AMP; Taylor visit with the store managers and
when she selects something, make them insist that it's on the house
because she is such an important person, etc. Make it convincing by
prior arrangement with the respective stores.''
</P>
<P>
   From the Samaranch profile, the bid team writes: ``JAS is short,
thin and fit (exercises daily). Has a habit of twiddling a buckeye
while talking. His conversation is formal. Strong negative position
on Ted Turner and TBS . . . does not drink alcohol (drinks mineral
water), likes punctuality, dislikes late evenings, does not
smoke.''
</P>
<P>
   Echols, the bid committee spokesman, says the scrutiny of the
campaign has been challenging. ``The environment in which we
conducted our bid was an environment that has now been
painstakingly scrutinized and turned upside down,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   What does he think of the team's marketing plan now? ``In the
future, cities who consider bidding on the Olympic Games should
confine their marketing strategy to ordering some pizzas and
handing out some Beanie Babies.''

 &HT;    Detailed notes tell story of vote-buying in Atlanta Olympic bid
 &HT;    (EDS: Moving in (w) Washington and (s) Sports categories.)By
Melissa Turner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Atlanta Olympic organizers meticulously compiled
information about the International Olympic Committee members who
held the key to riches for their city. No personal detail was too
insignificant or, apparently, too sleazy to go unrecorded.
</P>
<P>
   From the shoe sizes of the wives of the IOC delegates to the
brand of beer they favored was duly noted, filed away and reprised
when planning for the IOC members' visit to the city or selecting
gifts to deliver to their hotel rooms.
</P>
<P>
   And now the dossiers compiled by Olympic organizers and stored
away in three dozen boxes of files currently being scrutinized by
congressional investigators are creating a national furor.
</P>
<P>
   According to congressional investigators, the files contain
lists of IOC members whose votes can be bought and suggestions
about the sexual appetites and preferences of some of the members.
</P>
<P>
   For months Atlantans have been made aware of sordid details of
the bid effort and the committee's denials of wrongdoing. Now CNN,
NBC and Newsweek have produced reports on what the newsweekly
labeled ``the shady side of the modern Olympic movement.''
</P>
<P>
   And U.S. Rep. Fred Upton, the Michigan Republican who is
chairman of the House Commerce Committee's subcommittee on
oversight and investigations, is making the rounds. Starting with
CNN and NBC's Today program, he declared the files ``contain quite
a bit of damaging and troubling evidence'' that suggests ``a
pattern of buying votes'' by the Atlanta Olympic committee.
</P>
<P>
   Upton told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution on Monday that he is
planning public hearings to air Atlanta's dirty Olympic laundry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is there anyone out there who doesn't think what they did was
unethical or improper?'' the congressman asked. ``I don't think any
of this would pass the smell test from the get-go.''
</P>
<P>
   While the dossiers might make for spicy melodrama, they don't
seem to make a case for the kind of outright bribery that has come
to light in the Salt Lake City vote-buying scandal. And that is
primarily what the congressional committee is looking for in its
investigation of the Atlanta effort.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the ``IOC profile'' on Prince Albert of Monaco, one
of the more noteworthy delegates, suggested he ``likes the good
life, wine, women'' and added that his ``visit to Atlanta should be
low-key with press but an all-out orgy.''
</P>
<P>
   And, indeed, the prince and his entourage were shown a good time
during his August 1989 visit. Several private parties were held in
his honor, bags of gifts left in his hotel room. One party was in
Bob Holder's penthouse Park Place apartment, another at country
music legend Kenny Rogers' ranch. After dinner one evening the
Atlanta bid committee rented a private room at a nightclub for
late-night revelry.
</P>
<P>
   When Sinan Erdem, the former volleyball player and IOC member
from Turkey, came for his visit, a private party at a Buckhead home
was planned. A bid committee member dropped a letter to the party's
hosts, Joe and Patty Thomas, offering tips for a successful
evening, which included supplying ``plenty of vodka and invite the
wildest people you know, followed by a trip to the Gold Club after
dinner.'' The Gold Club features nude dancers.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy of gathering personal information on IOC members
and then using it to secure their bids, according to Upton, ``has a
fairly large taint of sleaze. It is pretty disgusting.''
</P>
<P>
   Bid committee spokesman Lee Echols defends the practice.
``Bidding for the Olympic Games was akin to creating a new business
and any new business must conduct research about its product and
audience before it gets off the ground,'' Echols said.
</P>
<P>
   Upton says it's a dirty business that has to stop. ``We need to
have legislation on the books to require it to stop,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Upton points in particular to the fat file folders compiled on
each IOC member that fill more than three large cardboard file
boxes. The folders contain copies of correspondence and memorandums
referencing the delegates. Stapled to the inside cover of each
folder is a list of the dozens of gifts received by the delegate
and the dates they were given.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the folders also contain single-page dossiers, written
by an Atlanta bid team member. The profiles include basic
biographical detail, along with the names of family members, the
dates they visited Atlanta and dates bid team members visited them
in their home countries. They also contain ``personal
information,'' which described their likes and dislikes and
personality quirks. A snapshot of the IOC member, sometimes with a
spouse, was usually attached to the profile.
</P>
<P>
   More often than not, the profiles were superficial. About Juge
Keba Mbaye of Senegal, one of the most influential members of the
IOC, the bid team wrote: ``Considered by all African IOC members to
be their chief, the leader of them all. A very important and
influential member in the eyes of other African IOC members. A very
warm person with an almost regal carriage . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the profile of Jean-Claude Ganga of the Congo, who
has been expelled from the IOC as the worst offender in the Salt
Lake City vote-buying scandal. His dossier hints at the Atlanta bid
team's all-out effort to secure his vote:
</P>
<P>
   ``Very active in anti-apartheid movement, a political animal. A
very, very important ally and a very good friend of Atlanta. He is
very proud of his association with us especially his relations with
(former mayors) Andy Young and Maynard Jackson . . . Ganga is a
very intelligent man, very politically astute, and a real
character. He will always have a personal interest in Atlanta's
success.''
</P>
<P>
   Ganga scored well in Atlanta. The bid committee has admitted to
donating at least $30,000 worth of sports equipment and clothing to
Ganga's National School and University Games in the Congo. They
also paid $15,000 _ at Ganga's request _ to send two teenagers from
the Congo to the prestigious Nick Bolitteri tennis camp in Florida.

$9.4 BILLION DEAL BETWEEN MOTOROLA AND GENERAL INSTRUMENT IN
WORKS 
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Ill.) (ms) 
 By DAVID BARBOZA AND LAURA M. HOLSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Motorola Inc., long a dominant player in the
semiconductor and cellular telephone markets, may be carving out a
new niche for itself in home entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   By negotiating to acquire the General Instrument Corp., the
leading maker of cable set-top boxes, Motorola is trying to be a
leader in merging voice, data and video applications and funneling
them directly into homes through one broadband cable device,
according to people close to the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, consumers could soon be equipped with a cable
television set-top box offering a variety of multimedia
applications, everything from telephone service and high-definition
television to high-speed Internet access and interactive video
games.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at Motorola and General Instrument refused to comment
Monday on such a merger, which was reported in The Wall Street
Journal and The Los Angeles Times. But people close to the talks
said that as early as this week Motorola was expected to agree to
trade about six-tenths of a share of its stock for one share of
General Instrument, which would value the deal at $9.4 billion,
based on Monday's Motorola stock price.
</P>
<P>
   But initial reaction to the combination was negative as
investors sent the stock of both companies tumbling Monday on the
New York Stock Exchange. Shares of Motorola, which is based in
Schaumburg, Ill., fell $8.25, or 8.5 percent, to $90.375, and
shares of General Instrument, which is based in Horsham, Pa.,
dropped $2.8125, or 5.4 percent, to $49.6875.
</P>
<P>
   Some investors in General Instrument apparently considered the
price Motorola was offering as too low, while some Motorola
shareholders apparently thought it too high, fearing the
acquisition could dilute earnings in the coming year.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts who follow the two companies said that even if
Motorola's earnings were hurt in the early stages of the merger,
the deal would eventually reap huge benefits by positioning the
company in the fast-converging market of cable television and
telephone service.
</P>
<P>
   ``The merger makes a lot of sense for Motorola,'' said Kenneth
Leon, an analyst at ABN Amro. ``This is clearly the direction
Motorola wants to go in: they've been desperately looking for
another high-growth business, and digital boxes open up
opportunities for new features and services.''
</P>
<P>
   The move by Motorola comes as the world of media,
telecommunications and cable properties is being redrawn. Just last
week, Viacom Inc. agreed to acquire CBS Inc. That deal would create
the world's second-largest media company after Time-Warner Inc. And
over the last two years, AT&AMP;T, the nation's largest telephone
company, has transformed itself into the nation's leading provider
of cable television by swallowing up companies like
Telecommunications Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street analysts say leading telecommunications, cable and
media companies are scrambling to find partners in the expectation
that many of the technologies will converge. Wireless phones,
televisions, video games and other devices will no longer have
distinct voice, data and video applications. They will be one _ or
at least linked through cable and wireless ports that can deliver
high-quality video and audio.
</P>
<P>
   ``A major focus for them is broadband technology,'' Mona Eraiba,
an analyst at Gruntal &AMP; Company, said of the prospective
Motorola-General Instrument deal. ``There are going to be set-top
boxes with cable modems and satellite technology. This is really a
chance to deploy the technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Motorola is already the leading maker of cable modems, which can
deliver cable programming into the personal computer. Now, analysts
say, the company can combine that technology and its ability to
feed data into a set-top box and cable infrastructure devised by
General Instrument that delivers everything from interactive video
to electronic commerce capacities. Some analysts predict that new
set-top boxes will be equipped with pay-per-view access and a slot
through which a credit card could be swiped.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're at an inflexion point, everything is moving very fast,''
Ms. Eraiba said. ``And the set-top boxes sit at the crossroads of
many technologies.''
</P>
<P>
   Motorola is now racing to that crossroads. After stumbling badly
because of a slowdown in Asia and a decline in the sales of
cellular telephones, Motorola has moved aggressively to return to
profitability.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, the company has made sharp cuts in its work
force, upgraded its cellular handsets in a booming cellular
marketplace and moved quickly to beef up its software development
and to position itself in the Internet and home entertainment
markets.
</P>
<P>
   It has made agreements with Cisco Systems and Sun Microsystems
Inc. to begin developing a ``wireless Internet'' network. The
company has also invested heavily in Teledesic LLC to produce
satellites to create an ``Internet in the sky'' system.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Motorola have rocketed more than 50 percent in the
past year, despite a troublesome investment in Iridium LLC, a
satellite telephone service now in Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Still,
company executives say Motorola is reaching into homes with cable
modems, set-top boxes and high-definition television sets, with
gentle whispers about the new buzzword on Wall Street: convergence.
</P>
<P>
   ``With set-top boxes they would have a control center that
delivers bytes the same way your electric company is delivering
watts,'' said Eric Buck, an analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP;
Jenrette. ``The big picture is that broadband pipes are going to
win out.''

POLICE HOPEFUL WITH HIGH IQ MAY GET HIS CHANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn.: San Francisco)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ELLEN BARRY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Connecticut man who was disqualified from a police recruitment
process in 1996 because he scored too high on an intelligence test
may yet wear a badge.
</P>
<P>
   Outraged at the use of the Wonderlic Personnel Test to weed out
unusually high or low scorers among would-be police officers, the
San Francisco chief of police has extended an invitation to Robert
Jordan to apply for a position on his force.
</P>
<P>
   Last week a federal district court judge in Connecticut
dismissed a discrimination lawsuit Jordan filed in the wake of his
1996 application for a slot on the New London police force. When
Jordan asked why the department had not followed up on his
application, he was told that he had been screened out because he
scored too high on an intelligence test.
</P>
<P>
   The judge ruled that Jordan was not a victim of discrimination.
But the ruling brought Jordan's case back into the public forum,
and when he read the story in the San Francisco Chronicle, that
city's police chief, Fred Lau, decided to take action.
</P>
<P>
   ``He thought, `There's something wrong with this, this is a
comedy,' '' said Officer Sherman Ackerson, a spokesman. ``The chief
said, `Why don't you get ahold of this guy?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Lau, whose bureau employs 2,200 officers, dropped an application
in the mail to Jordan Tuesday (Sept. 14) and hopes to make a larger
point with the gesture: Even if better-educated police are more
likely to change jobs, their contributions are worth the risk. Some
studies have shown that better-educated officers are less likely to
have excessive force complaints, Ackerson said.

   &UR; COMPLAIN _  &LR;  Hungry, angry and sleep-deprived, Sue Johnson
wandered through a deserted Houston airline terminal at 1 a.m.,
muttering like a mad woman. Continental Airlines had canceled her
connecting flight to San Antonio, failed to give her the proper
paperwork to secure her a spot on a competing carrier, then merely
shrugged when telling her she'd have to stay the night. ``It was a
nightmare trip,'' the graphic designer from San Antonio recalled.
``Unbelievably awful.'' Back home, too irate to write and too vexed
to vent on paper, Johnson instead booted up her computer and, for
$19.95, hired Complain.com to articulate her gripe for her. All it
took was one tart letter from the Internet consumer advocacy
company for Johnson to receive a $200 voucher from the airline. By

U.S. WONDERS IF CHINA WANTS A TRADE DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   QUEENSTOWN, New Zealand _ Two days after President Clinton and
President Jiang Zemin of China rekindled their relationship and
sent their negotiators off to strike one of the world's biggest
trade deals, here's what they came up with: Confusion about whether
China really wants a deal to enter the World Trade Organization
this year and a vague agreement to meet in two or three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   It was not exactly the display of urgent resolve that Clinton
had hoped for when he asked Jiang to resume the talks immediately,
perhaps thinking it was possible to close a deal while the two
leaders were still together. And as the negotiators packed up and
left New Zealand Monday night, Clinton's aides appeared mystified
by China's strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is quite certain what this is all about,'' one of
Clinton's top economic aides said, wondering aloud whether the
Chinese were posturing, delaying or had decided that a quickly
declining economy at home made this a bad time for Jiang to allow
fierce foreign competition into China's markets. Most theories,
however, center on how China may be seeking to parlay the
accidental NATO bombing of their embassy in Belgrade on May 7 into
some valuable trade concessions from the White House.
</P>
<P>
   From the start, the negotiations over the conditions for China
to enter the World Trade Organization have been about far more than
trade. Its entry is one of the few areas where the United States
and China can claim real progress in a relationship hurt by
differences over Taiwan's future, charges of spying and
longstanding arguments over human rights.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton argues that further integrating China into the world
economy will force it to operate under global rules, and that if
the deal is good enough he can demonstrate the economic benefits
for U.S. farmers and workers. Thus, Clinton's meeting with Jiang in
Auckland was carefully stage-managed to allow both sides to
announce a resumption of relations after the embassy bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Both Chinese and U.S. officials described their meeting on
Saturday as surprisingly free of rancor, and that China sought no
further apologies for the embassy bombing that killed three people.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks before the meeting, Clinton sent a letter to Jiang
urging that the two men use the Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation
meeting to resume negotiations. The message was reinforced by Sen.
Diane Feinstein, D-Calif., who saw Jiang on a visit to China and
told him that if China wanted to get congressional approval of the
deal, he had to act quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an assumption that if Congress can't get this passed
before the presidential election is in sight, it's pretty
hopeless,'' Commerce Secretary William Daley said earlier this
week. Next year Clinton's aides are unlikely to engage in a
divisive argument over trade that could once again split the
Democratic Party and further widen a rift between Vice President Al
Gore and U.S. labor unions, which are opposed to the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chinese understand the calendar,'' Daley said.
</P>

<P>
   They may understand it, but they do not appear driven by it. A
round of preliminary negotiations in China last week, and then a
second round in New Zealand between China's trade minister, Shi
Guangsheng, and the U.S. trade representative, Charlene Barshefsky,
never engaged in the substance of the issues dividing the two
countries. Those range from U.S. quotas on Chinese textiles, to the
rights of foreign automakers to enter China's markets, to the rules
that ban the ``dumping'' of Chinese goods in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Even after Clinton implored Jiang at their Saturday meeting to
start serious negotiations the next morning, the talks wandered in
circles, participants say, drifting into differing understandings
of what the two sides had already settled in April. In a private
aside, Clinton raised the issue again with Jiang on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's efforts to implore the Chinese back to the table are a
sharp reversal from April, when he walked away from a deal offered
during an official visit to Washington by Prime Minister Zhu
Rongji. At the time he said it was insufficient, although U.S.
businesses said they were astounded at the breadth of concessions
Zhu was willing to make at the time. When he returned to China, Zhu
was harshly criticized for giving away too much, particularly in
telecommunications and agriculture. It is now unclear whether Zhu's
concessions are still on the table, and many in the White House _
including Clinton himself, some officials say _ now regard the
rejection of the deal in April as a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the National Economic Council, Gene Sperling,
sidestepped questions about the talks, telling reporters that
``we've decided there is little to be gained by negotiating in
public.'' Other officials spent much of the day Monday insisting
that they never expected a deal would be signed _ even though
several top administration officials had told reporters, just a few
weeks ago, that the talks could be wrapped up in days.
</P>
<P>
   The turn of events has put Sperling, Ms. Barshefsky and Clinton
in an extraordinarily difficult position. All week they appeared to
be more eager for China to get into the WTO than the Chinese are.
That is a reversal from April, when China was pressing for
admission, and the United States appeared to be insisting on
ever-greater concessions.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials insist that they will not lower their demands for
market openings simply because of the bombing. ``It's a strategy I
would try as well,'' one top official involved in the negotiations
said Tuesday, ``but in the end it won't work. And if it keeps us
from getting a deal through Congress, it could backfire.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless some U.S. officials concede that Clinton would
probably take a deal that was only slightly better than what he
walked away from in April. The question now is how long it will
take to get both sides to that point.  &QL;

<P>
   GETTYSBURG, Pa. _ Mayor William Troxell personifies the misery
of the modern conflict raging in this historic town as he pores
over his color-coded map of Gettysburg, with the embattled town
souvenir merchants a pink-shaded picket line to the west and the
park headquarters firmly occupying the heart of the Civil War
battleground.
</P>
<P>
   ``My concern is both for the town and for our national park,''
said Troxell, a descendant of one of the town's founding families
and a licensed battlefield guide, his finger moving along the
bloodless but furious battle lines of contemporary Gettysburg.
``What we're facing could destroy approximately 100 businesses and
be very harmful to our tax base,'' he declared, fretfully
summarizing a wrenching four-year conflict between the National
Park Service and the town.
</P>
<P>
   The core of the conflict is a proposal for the cash-strapped
park system to tap $39 million in commercial and foundation
financing and build a new visitors center a half-mile from the
downtown center and its surrounding merchants. Their outcry is that
the change would drain away their trade. But park officials say the
proposal would reclaim some of the hallowed ground of Pickett's
Charge and aim to better protect the park's huge Civil War
artifacts collection.
</P>
<P>
   Just down the road from the mayor, Dr. John Latschar, the
superintendent of the park and a historian with an appreciation for
skirmish lines, exudes his own air of generalship as he awaits a
crucial decision this week by congressional budget negotiators on
whether the plan might be blocked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nowhere in the Park Service mission do you find that I have a
responsibility to protect the commercial enterprises surrounding
the park,'' Latschar said of the shops near the current center that
some visitors find tawdry and others colorful. Rather, he claims a
responsibility to visitors who annually flood 1.7 million strong
into the busiest of the Civil War parks.
</P>
<P>
   One of the less popular figures in this town of 7,000, the
superintendent is determined to move the visitors center, build an
artifacts museum, and restore the battleground terrain at Ziegler's
Grove. The land is occupied by the current center, set atop
Cemetery Hill, a pre-World War II, red-brick building that both
sides tend to agree is worn and cramped.
</P>
<P>
   Latschar is being denounced for his plan because it would allow
a commercial enterprise under the park-service roof. The new center
would be built by a private consortium and operated commercially.
The superintendent stolidly observes that changes in the
park-service status quo often rile merchants, known familiarly in
the park service as the ``rubber tomahawk'' shops.
</P>
<P>
   Town merchants are incensed that the new center would have
theater, cafeteria, bookshop and battlefield guide services and
would be the new site as well for the Cyclorama. This is a major
tourist attraction, built around a light show and Paul
Philippoteaux's 360-degree painting of Pickett's Charge, a vivid
moment in the three days of Gettysburg fighting.
</P>
<P>
   The Cyclorama is a 37-year-old building that park officials say
has problems of rain and asbestos leakage. It is next to the
visitors center, opposite the main strip of souvenir merchants
along Steinwehr Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the arrogance of the park service, the way they've run
rough-shod over this community, that permeates this fight,'' said
Eric Uberman, proprietor of the National Wax Museum, a commercial
tourist attraction across from the center's main entrance. He
dismissed as propaganda the park-service estimate that businesses,
far from withering, might expect more than $20 million in
additional tourist cash from a new, more accommodating visitors
center.
</P>
<P>
   The struggle reached the point where the town's 81-year-old
battlefield dowager, Angela Rosensteel Eckert, began a lawsuit to
reclaim the battle artifacts that her forebears donated as the
heart of the park collection.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dr. Latschar is a very brilliant man, but he's just working
for himself and his new center and is not concerned with the people
here,'' Mrs. Eckert said, complaining that the park had neglected
the collection, housed in the old center, for decades and only
expressed concern lately as a ploy.
</P>
<P>
   The new center would be built on a 45-acre tract barely tinged
with battlefield history. Still, critics say, the park would be
desecrated by the arrival of a commercial developer, Robert Kinsley
of York, Pa. Chosen in a competition, Kinsley would build the
center in a joint venture that Latschar considers a creative way to
deal with what he says is a critical shortage of more than $6
billion in federal money for maintenance throughout the park
system.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the town would prefer to upgrade the existing visitors
building, fearing the shifting of their very center of gravity.
Visitors flow through here to roam the park's 5,800 acres _ a
quiltlike array of glorious fields, historic buildings and crammed
souvenir warrens, motels and food shops.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Earlier this year the House stepped into the dispute. Rep. James
Hansen, R-Utah, who heads the subcommittee on national parks,
called the plan ``fatally flawed.''
</P>
<P>
   The House approved an unusual amendment to block the plan,
introduced by Rep. Ron Klink of Pennsylvania, a Democrat who is
expected to run next year against Republican Sen. Rick Santorum.
Santorum supports the park-service proposal and is leading the
fight against the Klink amendment this week in the final budget
conferences between the House and the Senate on the Department of
the Interior.
</P>
<P>
   Just as in the Civil War, the politics of Washington lobbying
and rivalry is a subtext of the current battle. Opponents are
suspicious of the campaign donations to Santorum by Kinsley, but
the developer insists that his support long predates the Gettysburg
venture.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost as long as the Civil War,'' Kinsley said of the
local fight, insisting that he is seeking no personal profit beyond
``the satisfaction of helping the American people put together an
outstanding museum.''
</P>
<P>
   Some opponents stress that the issue goes beyond the welfare of
local politicians and merchants to that of ``selling the American
heritage to the highest bidder,'' in the words of Dr. Walter
Powell, a local resident who is president of the Gettysburg
Battlefield Preservation Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``The heart of the problem is the agency itself,'' said Powell,
complaining that the park service's public-hearing process was
rigidly controlled and that critics had to resort to the Freedom of
Information Act to find out critical details.
</P>
<P>
   Latschar insists that the hearings have been open and exhaustive
and that joint ventures with private developers are an accepted
innovation in other national parks. ``I'm not surprised at all the
politics involved,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That makes sense if you see we're in charge of the nation's
most priceless sites,'' Latschar added, waiting in his headquarters
for word from Washington.

<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ As an assistant secretary of state, Hal Saunders
mediated between the Arabs and Israelis in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   As director of international affairs for the Kettering
Foundation, he mediated between Estonians and Russians and in the
Tajikistan civil war after the fall of the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he's applied those lessons about dialogue, and more
importantly, about change coming from the people, not the
governments, to America.
</P>
<P>
   This evening, he'll share his ideas on how to talk honestly
about race, and how to do it in a way that causes deep changes.
</P>
<P>
   Saunders is speaking at Books and Company in Kettering, Ohio, as
part of a book tour for his book ``A Public Peace Process:
Sustained Dialogue to Transform Racial and Ethnic Conflicts.''
</P>
<P>
   Blacks and whites work together and go to school together, but
they don't have much knowledge about each other, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In America today, it's not so much malevolence as ignorance that
supports the status quo, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest obstacle to race relations is whites' avoidance of
the problem,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Saunders, who is white, lives in the suburbs of Washington, D.C.
Although he does not live in a gated community, there is no
crossover between that world and the predominantly black and Latino
inner city.
</P>
<P>
   It would be easy for him, and others in his community, to forget
about those with less. It's effortless ``to not have my face rubbed
in the inequity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There are obvious differences between Saunders' experience
abroad and race relations in the United States. For one, there's no
armed struggle here. But, in his opinion, all these conflicts share
the fact that the competition for power is only a sidelight to the
larger issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're clashes over identity, they're clashes over historic
grievances,'' he said. ``People don't negotiate about their
identity or their hatred or their fear.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Saunders is confident these chasms can be bridged. A
sizable minority of whites, he believes, agree with him, that
``America can't survive in the long term if large numbers of
minorities are cut out of the mainstream.''
</P>
<P>
   He plans to host workshops in Dayton for people around the
country who want to learn his method of talking about prejudice.
But spreading intimacy among the races beyond a small committee is
the greatest challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't spread quickly, it doesn't spread dramatically,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   But with sustained efforts, particularly in high schools,
Saunders believes America can have less fragmentation.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people learn to talk with each other in this way, it
becomes addictive,'' he said.

<P>
   &UR; Copyright 1999 San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
Hungry, angry and sleep-deprived, Sue Johnson wandered through a
deserted Houston airline terminal at 1 a.m., muttering like a
madwoman.
</P>
<P>
   Continental Airlines had canceled her connecting flight to San
Antonio, failed to give her the proper paperwork to secure her a
spot on a competing carrier, then merely shrugged when telling her
she would have to stay the night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a nightmare trip,'' recalled the graphic designer from
San Antonio, Texas. ``Unbelievably awful.''
</P>
<P>
   Back home, too irate to write and too vexed to vent on paper,
Johnson booted up her computer and, for $19.95, hired Complain.com
(www.complain.com) to articulate her gripe for her. All it took was
one tart letter from the Internet consumer advocacy company for
Johnson to receive a $200 voucher from the airline.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have time myself to deal with it,'' Johnson said. ``I
didn't have to calm down enough to create an eloquent letter. And I
didn't have to search for the right person to send it to. For 20
bucks, they did it all. The good news is, I got $200. The bad news
is, I've got to fly Continental again.''
</P>
<P>
   Cyberspace, it seems, has turned into the Whine Country. A half
dozen online ghostwriting companies have sprouted on the Web to
complain on behalf of consumers. The industry still is young,
though, and it remains to be seen just how profitable these firms
can be. In fact, a few already have folded.
</P>
<P>
   Complain.com of Mountain View, up and griping on June 1, is the
latest Internet outfit that, for a fee, will pepper CEOs of
offending companies with letters and faxes until they recompense _
or at least acknowledge _ the consumer. Complaint companies do not
receive commission on refunds, they just serve as the mouthpiece.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer complaining is a &LR;   &LR; growth market, according to several
advocacy groups. Complaints filed with the Better Business Bureau
jumped from 1.4 million in 1993 to 2.04 million in 1997, the latest
year for which results are available. The National Association of
Consumer Agency Administrators, a federation of 280 nonprofit
organizations, reports that complaints about auto sales have jumped
more than 50 percent from 1997 to the present.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the vast majority of complaints go unmade,'' said
Steven Ericsson-Zenith, founder of Complain.com. ``It's just too
much trouble for people to do it themselves. Our service is quick _
they've just got to send an e-mail _ and we do the research, write
the letter and send it to the customer to sign. It's really quite
simple.''
</P>
<P>
   So simple, in fact, that some consumer advocates believe paying
for online complaint services is a waste of money.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Wallace, president of the Oakland-San Francisco chapter
of the Better Business Bureau, said his organization provides the
same service as the pay-for-grumble businesses with one major
difference _ it's free.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why there would be a market for it,'' Wallace
said. ``If someone sends us a complaint, we follow up on it just
like companies like Complain.com. We get thousands of inquiries a
month at the Better Business Bureau, and we handle it for free and
have 99 percent name-recognition. Who's ever heard of Complain.com
and outfits like that?''
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, corporations big and small are receiving consumer
tales &UR;  &LR; of woe with letterheads such as Complain to Us (based in
Somerville, Mass.) Caveat Emptor (based in Austin, Texas), Fight
Back (based in Los Angeles) and Ellen's Poison Pen (based in
Alexandria, Va.). Most companies won't release the number of
complaints they handle, but Ellen Phillips of Ellen's Poison Pen
said she has received 3,000 complaints and accepted 300 as clients.
</P>
<P>
   Internet complaint firms say they are more persistent and
provide more personal service than the Better Business Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a new wave of communication,'' said Bill Tran, Caveat
Emptor's president. ``We get a lot better response than the BBB,
which routes complaints to local chapters and then you never hear
back.''
</P>
<P>
   Most complaint firms do not accept advertising, lest they be
perceived as partial to corporate interests. Phillips, a former
English teacher who started Ellen's Poison Pen
(www.ellenspoisonpen.com) out of her home in 1987, said she takes
on any employer, even the government.
</P>
<P>
   Among the successes Phillips cites: obtaining a green card from
the Immigration and Naturalization Service for a client who claimed
to be a political prisoner in his homeland, obtaining a job
transfer for a ``harassed'' government secretary, securing $15,000
in back child support for a single mother, and forcing a school
district to pay a teacher disability for getting injured while on a
field trip.
</P>
<P>
   One of Phillips' proudest successes was getting Ben and Jerry's,
the ice cream-maker, to scoop up $10,000 (to cover hospital bills)
for a customer who had a whole nut lodged in his throat even though
the ice cream container promised ``slivers of nuts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a consumer revolution going on,'' said Phillips, who
also has published a book, ``Shocked, Appalled, Dismayed: How to
Write Letters of Complaint That Get Results.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers now know that if they complain effectively for a
legitimate problem, it pays off. I even have CEOs who have used me
to complain about other companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Being the new kid on the Internet block, Complain.com has yet to
rack up as impressive a list of satisfied complainers as Ellen's
Poison Pen. But the firm, housed in a nondescript business park
just off Highway 101, already is receiving a ``steady stream'' of
business, according to President Priscilla Harriman.
</P>
<P>
   Ericsson-Zenith, 44, and Harriman, 42, developed the idea more
than a year ago. Ericsson-Zenith, a veteran of the semiconductor
industry, handles the technological end; Harriman, former teacher
at a private school on the Peninsula, researches, writes and edits
the complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Complain.com does not extend its advocacy for consumers beyond
writing complaint letters. But Ericsson-Zenith said he is
negotiating with several consumer attorneys to help customers whose
complaints are ignored by companies.
</P>
<P>
   Harriman said Complain.com's first success shortly after going
online was to help a client return a set of defective golf clubs
for a refund.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got the letter out,'' she said, ``and the next day, he
hears from the company, which gave him not only a refund and letter
of apology, but a free new set of clubs.''
</P>
<P>
   Most complaints at Harriman's firm and other online services
deal with transportation matters _ such as complaints about service
on planes, trains and automobiles. Harriman said airlines respond
quickly to complaints but that automakers are notorious for
responding tardily, if at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a lot of trouble with a guy who bought a Ford
truck,'' she said. ``It's a new truck; it squeaks. He takes it back
to the dealer, who says to put gunk on it every two weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated, the customer turned to Complain.com, which has
written letters and sent faxes to Ford.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't heard back from Ford in a long time,'' Harriman
said with a note of frustration.
</P>
<P>
   The mighty pen is all the power that online complaint services
have. None provides legal advice.
</P>
<P>
   A bad track record for a company is the advocates' major weapon.
Most of the online services, as well as the Better Business Bureau,
provide clients with databases listing companies prone to consumer
complaints.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've found that credit-report companies draw the most
complaints,'' said Gary Rattigan, founder of Complain to Us in
Somerville, Mass. ``Credit fixers are the toughest to get any
response out of. The easy touches are the airline companies. All
you've got to do is whine a little, and you get something.''
</P>
<P>
   Complain.com will not turn down any complaint for being too
trivial, but Harriman said she often will tone down the venom in an
irate consumer's screed. ``We let them vent,'' said Harriman, who
writes and edits most of the letters, ``and we leave most of their
exclamation points in. But sometimes, we have to take the heat out.
But if customers want to ask a lot in return, we don't advise them
not to ask. It's their complaint.''
</P>
<P>
   Other businesses, however, weed out greedy clients with
frivolous complaints. Phillips, for instance, chose not to
represent the consumer who wanted monetary damages because
Baskin-Robbins ``put the napkin too high on his ice cream cone and
he licked the napkin by mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I always say, `Don't be greedy,''' but some people are,''
Phillips said.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of online consumer complaint companies say the Web
companies themselves are greedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``These startup complaint companies charge for what we do for
free and what consumers can do themselves,'' said Wallace of the
Better Business Bureau. ``It's a wild scheme, and I don't think
it'll work.'' Some professional Web whiners already have put down
the poison pen &UR;  &LR; because of poor business. B.L. Ochman took down her
Rent-a-Kvetch site last week, and Rattigan of Complain to Us has
started a side business as an online collection agency to ``keep my
complaint business afloat.''
</P>
<P>
   Ericsson-Zenith and Harriman say they are patient and will let
Complain.com find its niche market.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to take a year or so before we know whether people
are really going to take to this,'' Ericsson-Zenith said. ``We're
still waiting for our first complaint about us. So far, the only
problem we had is one guy e-mailing us about poor grammar on our
Web site. He was quite pedantic.''

 Venture Capital Firm Opens Silicon Valley Incubator
<TEXT>

</P>
<P>
   A prominent Southern California venture capital firm that helped
launch successful Web startups like GoTo.com, NetZero, Free-PC.com
and eToys opened a new business incubator yesterday in Silicon
Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Idealab of Pasadena recently raised $350 million to make it the
largest venture capital fund in Southern California. The new
incubator, on Macara Avenue in Sunnyvale, moves Idealab squarely
into the heart of Silicon Valley, where venture capital funds
attract sums 20 times larger.
</P>
<P>
   But Idealab Chairman Bill Gross said he wanted to expand into
Silicon Valley to tap a wealth of startup entrepreneurs not found
in Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   ``People aren't as entrepreneurial here as they are there,''
Gross said in a telephone interview from his Pasadena office. ``We
now have a backlog of 27 ideas we want to start. The bottleneck is
not ideas or money. We need to find great people.''
</P>
<P>
   The Idealab Silicon Valley incubator will be housed in the
former headquarters of PointCast, the struggling online news and
information service that Idealab purchased in May. The incubator
initially will house PointCast, now renamed EntryPoint, and other
Idealab startups, including Eve.com, Utility.com and OpenSales.com.
</P>
<P>
   Idealab Vice Chairman Bob Kavner will head the Sunnyvale office,
with a management team that includes Jim Winget, a former vice
president and chief scientist of Silicon Graphics Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Idealab's incubator, designed to help new Internet businesses
start, is funded by Idealab Capital Partners, an investment fund
launched by Gross and two partners. Idealab Capital Partners was
able to raise more than $350 million in just two months, which
analysts said reflected a growing interest in Southern California's
Internet industry.
</P>
<P>
   The fund is the second created by Idealab Capital, a spin-off of
Idealab. Investors in the fund include Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan,
Times Mirror, the California Institute of Technology and the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   The new Idealab Capital fund is the largest ever created in
Southern California, according to Venture One, an investment
research firm based in San Francisco.

 &HT;    Reds on playoff mission
 &HT;    By Hal McCoy
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ They ask about pressure. They whisper the word,
almost reverently, when they ask about p-r-e-s-s-u-r-e. Aren't the
Cincinnati Reds feeling pressure? They win, the Houston Astros win.
They win, the New York Mets win.
</P>
<P>
   With time spinning crazily out of control, the season's end
creeping dangerously close, is the pressure swooping in because no
matter what they do, the Astros and Mets do it just as well?
</P>
<P>
   Manager Jack McKeon looks at his inquisitor as if he had been
asked directions to the Yellow Brick Road and answered, ``You
crazy, man. It's mythical.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is absolutely no pressure on us,'' he said. ``We're not
supposed to be here anyway. Hell, we don't even bring up the
playoffs. I'm not managing and we're not playing any differently
than at the beginning of the year. If you change things, you end up
screwing it up.''
</P>
<P>
   His players deflect the pressure issue, too, just as they
deflect talk of the Houston Astros. They take care of their
business, as they did once again Monday by flicking aside the
moribund Florida Marlins, 7-4, completing a four-game sweep and
winning for the 10th time in 11 games on their inexorable chase of
the Astros in the National League Central and the Mets in the wild
card chase.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to win the games we HAVE to win,'' left-fielder Greg
Vaughn said after his 38th home run in the sixth inning ignited a
three-run rally that brought the Reds from 4-2 behind to 5-4 ahead.
Vaughn singled to start the seventh inning and stole second to get
into position to score.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Stynes, a stand-in at second base for sore-backed Pokey
Reese, drove in the go-ahead run to make it 5-4 in the sixth with a
single, then put it away in the next inning with a two-run single.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we keep beating the teams we HAVE to beat,'' Vaughn said,
emphasizing the word 'have' each time he used it, ``Things will
take care of themselves. If we do all we can, like keep winning, we
can hold our heads high. If it isn't good enough to catch Houston,
we tip our hats to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Right now, the Reds are not in a hat-tipping mood. They are in a
winning frame of mind and general manager Jim Bowden says the word
pressure should be applied to the Astros and Mets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally, our games end before theirs,'' he said. ``You'd
think it would begin to affect them, put the pressure on them. We
keep winning and they have to see that and say, 'Man, the Reds won
again.'''
</P>
<P>
   Starter Steve Parris (8-2) was not the sharpest blade in the
rack Monday, giving up four runs, including Derrek Lee's two-run
homer in the sixth to put the Marlins ahead, 4-2.
</P>
<P>
   But when the Reds scored three in the sixth and Parris left the
game, he was rewarded with the victory and said, ``It was a nice
vulture win for me. . .come out of the game and get a win out of
it. They did a great job of picking me up when I put them behind,
4-2. The Astros?
</P>
<P>
   ``All we have to do is take care of ourselves because we can't
worry about the Astros until we get down there (two games September
28-29) and play them at the end of the year. It's hard. . .but we
have to keep going out there and winning.''
</P>
<P>
   Stynes is the club's poster child for success. No matter whom
McKeon calls upon to fill-in when an irregular is needed, that guy
produces. Stynes took over for Reese in the first inning Sunday and
contributed three hits, three runs, a double and a stolen base. On
Monday, it was two hits and three RBIs _ driving in the go-ahead
run and two tack-on runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stynes is something,'' Parris said. ``The guy gets put into a
game and does the job. I can't remember the last time he didn't do
the job when he got put into a game.''
</P>
<P>
   In late July, Stynes was hitting an embarrassing .087, but since
August 17 he has ten hits and a sacrifice bunt in 17 plate
appearances, pushing his average to respectability at .240.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looks like the old Stynes (.348 in 1997) and I wish I could
get him more action, but I just can't do it,'' McKeon said. Stynes
gets another chance tonight in the opener of a three-game series
against the Cubs, another team the Reds HAVE to beat, because the
superstitious McKeon said, ``I'll probably go with the same
lineup,'' giving Reese another day to rest his back.

 _ SF CHRON   Trading Stocks in An IRA 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; Copyright 1999 San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;   &LR; Q: Is there any tax penalty if I buy and sell stocks short term
in my individual retirement account? I have been doing a lot of
in-and-out trading in my IRA because I am worried about the market
and don't want to commit my funds for any great length of time and
also because I speculate with risky Internet stocks and try to make
quick profits.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A: Under certain circumstances, you can suffer what amounts to a
tax penalty for trading in an IRA, says Internal Revenue Service
spokesman Jesse Weller.
</P>
<P>
   This could happen if you pay your brokerage commissions with
money from outside the IRA. If you do this and if your commissions
plus the amount you contribute to the IRA in a given year exceed
your annual IRA contribution limit, the excess is subject to a 6
percent excise tax. (Your contribution limit is $2,000 per year or
the amount of your earned income, whichever is less.)
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, if you instruct your broker to deduct your
commissions from the money within the IRA _ as most IRA holders do
_ then you won't be subject to the excise tax.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of taxes, you ought to reconsider your heavy-trading
strategy. The purpose of an IRA is to build a fund over the long
term to help support you in retirement. If you trade in and out,
you risk hopping from one loser to another and actually diminishing
your retirement fund. In addition, much of your capital will be
chewed up by the commissions.
</P>
<P>
   While some investors consistently profit from trading in and
out, the strategy that seems to work best for most people is to buy
shares in financially sound companies with strong earnings growth
and hold them as long as the companies stay that way.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: Last December, I bought some stock in AboveNet
Communications, an Internet software company. A few months ago, the
company announced that it was merging with Metromedia Fiber
Network, which makes fiber optic communications products. What will
be the impact of the Metromedia merger on the value of my shares? I
tried calling the company, but they do not return my calls.
</P>
<P>
   A: That deal was completed on Thursday. You soon should receive
1.175 shares of Metromedia Fiber Network for each of your shares in
AboveNet Communications. If your broker holds your stock for you,
the Metromedia Fiber shares will be credited to your account.
</P>
<P>
   When the deal was announced June 23, Metromedia was selling at
$37.50 per share, making the AboveNet shares worth $44.06, based on
the proposed exchange ratio. That is more than $18 above the price
AboveNet was fetching the previous week.
</P>
<P>
   However, Metromedia Fiber later plunged as low as $22 and
AboveNet plunged, too, closing on August 10 at $25 per share. By
the time the merger took place, Metromedia Fiber had rallied back
to $32.25, giving each of your AboveNet shares a value of $37.89.
</P>
<P>
   There is no good reason why the terms of the merger should have
been a mystery to you. AboveNet was required to send you a proxy
statement spelling out all the details well before Thursday's
special meeting.
</P>
<P>
   If you ever have any questions about any company in which you
own stock, you should call or write the investor relations
department. Keep badgering them until they give you a complete and
comprehensible answer. It's your privilege as a part-owner.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &LR;   &LR;  Q: I will reach my 65th birthday in a few months, and I plan to
retire and begin taking Social Security. Will my Social Security
payments be subject to income tax wholly or in part?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &LR;   &LR;  A: I can't answer your question for certain because I don't
know your income and your tax-filing status. But for many people,
Social Security has been partly taxable since 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Under the current guidelines, if you are single and your income
_ including half your Social Security benefits _ exceeds $25,000
annually, you may have to pay tax on part of your Social Security
income.
</P>
<P>
   The same holds true if you are married, file taxes jointly with
your spouse and have an income (including half of your Social
Security) greater than $32,000.
</P>
<P>
   The portion of your Social Security income that is taxable _ if
indeed it is taxable _ is capped at 85 percent. However, for most
people the percentage is much lower.
</P>
<P>
   You can determine whether you must pay taxes on your Social
Security income _ and if so, how much _ by completing an 18-step
worksheet included with the tax package you get from the Internal
Revenue Service.
</P>
<P>
   For a fully detailed discussion of how Social Security benefits
are taxed, take a look at the 24-page IRS Publication 915. You can
download it from the IRS Web site at www.irs.gov or order it by
telephone at (800) 829-3676.

POLICE HOPEFUL WITH HIGH IQ MAY GET HIS CHANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn.: Conn.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ELLEN BARRY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Connecticut man who was disqualified from a police recruitment
process in 1996 because he scored too high on an intelligence test
may yet wear a badge.
</P>
<P>
   Outraged at the use of the Wonderlic Personnel Test to weed out
unusually high or low scorers among would-be police officers, the
San Francisco chief of police has extended an invitation to Robert
Jordan to apply for a position on his force.
</P>
<P>
   Last week a federal district court judge in Connecticut
dismissed a discrimination lawsuit Jordan filed in the wake of his
1996 application for a slot on the New London police force. When
Jordan asked why the department had not followed up on his
application, he was told that he had been screened out because he
scored too high on an intelligence test.
</P>
<P>
   The judge ruled that Jordan was not a victim of discrimination.
But the ruling brought Jordan's case back into the public forum,
and when he read the story in the San Francisco Chronicle, that
city's police chief, Fred Lau, decided to take action.
</P>
<P>
   ``He thought, `There's something wrong with this, this is a
comedy,' '' said Officer Sherman Ackerson, a spokesman. ``The chief
said, `Why don't you get ahold of this guy?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Lau, whose bureau employs 2,200 officers, dropped an application
in the mail to Jordan Tuesday (Sept. 14) and hopes to make a larger
point with the gesture: Even if better-educated police are more
likely to change jobs, their contributions are worth the risk. Some
studies have shown that better-educated officers are less likely to
have excessive force complaints, Ackerson said.

 VirtualVineyard Swallows Up Wine.com
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By Peter Sinton &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Copyright 1999 San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
In the first major consolidation among online wine vendors,
VirtualVineyard.com of Palo Alto will announce today that it has
acquired Wine.com of Napa.
</P>
<P>
   VirtualVineyard is buying Wine.com primarily for its name, which
it plans to adopt after the merger.
</P>
<P>
   No purchase price will be disclosed, but sources say it may top
the $3.3 million that Compaq Computer reportedly paid last month
for the name altavista.com. Compaq's search engine subsidiary was
already operating under the AltaVista name but it did not own the
Web address www.altavista.com until it paid what is believed to be
a record price for a domain name.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Wine.com has more than just a name; it also has an
operating business. But Robert Harmon, chief executive of Wine.com,
figures that about 70 percent of his company's value is its name.
</P>
<P>
   VirtualVineyard chief executive Bill Newlands acknowledged that
Wine.com ``is the perfect name for a wine site.''
</P>
<P>
   Wine.com is more of an informational Web site, while
VirtualVineyard focuses on wine sales over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The combined company will be ``the first fully integrated wine
portal on the Web combining content, commerce and community on one
wine site,'' said Newlands, who previously led Domaine Chandon and
Simi Winery.
</P>
<P>
   Wine.com has links to more than 200 wineries and is primarily
advertising supported. Unlike many Internet businesses, it has
positive cash flow, said Harmon.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Harmon said it made sense to merge with
VirtualVineyard, which has raised more than $40 million in venture
capital since 1994 and now sells wine in 40 states.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed capital to grow, but I felt why recreate the
wheel,'' said Harmon, who was once Robert Mondavi's chauffeur and
later launched a Napa Valley helicopter tour business that went
bankrupt after his partner was killed in a crash.
</P>
<P>
   Newlands said the merged company will soon be offering 1,500 to
2,000 different combinations of wines in various sizes from around
the world.
</P>
<P>
   But it will not have the online market to itself. There are a
few small competitors such as eVineyard, SendWine.com and
Winecast.com.
</P>
<P>
   A major rival will be WineShopper.com, which also is backed by
more than $40 million in venture capital and is expected to launch
its Web site this month. The San Francisco company has
relationships with wineries, wholesalers and retailers that it
believes will allow it to sell wine legally in any of the 50
states.

<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Schools in Ohio are virtually changing.
</P>
<P>
   Classrooms in Warren and Hamilton counties will move out of the
traditional school setting into homes, businesses, libraries _
anywhere there's a computer that has Internet access with the
start-up this week of a Virtual Learning Academy in Ohio. For the
first time in the state, it's possible to take high school courses
online.
</P>
<P>
   Other counties, including Montgomery County, are expected to
join in quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``This educational delivery system can break down time and
distance barriers that have kept people out of the classroom,''
said John Boggess, superintendent of the Miami Valley Career
Technology Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Adults can take classes to enhance their jobs, students can
get special intervention for proficiency tests or take classes not
offered at their school.''
</P>
<P>
   Via the Internet, students learn from the best libraries,
museums, and information archives in the world, said Greg Berry,
president of The Citadel Group International, based in Maryland.
Citadel developed the learning academy and was hired to make sure
the lessons meet Ohio Department of Education standards, Berry
said.
</P>
<P>
   Many courses are enhanced by graphics, stereo sounds and
multimedia pictures.
</P>
<P>
   The courses are set up so students can move at their own pace,
but still receive guidance from a teacher who is either at an area
school or available by e-mail or telephone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe you cannot substitute the face-to-face time with a
teacher. That element has to be incorporated into any kind of
learning,'' said Clifford A. Migal, president of the Great Oaks
Institute of Technology and Career Development, the joint
vocational school that serves, Hamilton, Highland, and Clermont
Counties.
</P>
<P>
   The academy includes two components: Learning Springs: On-line
curriculum for students grades five to 12. In Ohio, the fee runs
about $165 per student for unlimited access to a library of 80
courses that include basic education classes, proficiency
intervention and electives such as foreign languages. Adult
Learning: more than 600 courses that range from personal
development to computer classes to electrical schematics. Fees run
$150 per course with up to six months to complete. There's no
traditional start of the school year so students can sign up and
get started at any time.
</P>
<P>
   Colleges offer courses on-line, but only three states _ New
York, Georgia and South Carolina _ offer Internet study. Citadel
has contracts with about 6,000 individual school districts to
provide coursework in some fashion on-line.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio will tap into virtual classes through an initiative of the
Ohio Association of Joint Vocational School Superintendents. The
association voted in August to secure rights to the Citaldel's
curriculum in Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw an opportunity for public education to use virtual
learning as a tool in a viably financial way,'' said Vince
Roessner, superintendent of the Warren County Career Center. ``If
we don't deliver this, somebody else will and they may not be as
altruistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Roessner and Migal volunteered to test the program for adults
and high school students in Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Great Oaks got the head start with virtual classes offered to
161 students over the summer. Of those students, two failed, two
dropped the courses and 157 passed. About 83 percent of the
students got a C or better, Migel said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about a group who had already failed the class
once. You bring them back with a new delivery option and 157 out of
161 complete the class,'' Migel said. ``That's phenomenal.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Great Oaks and Warren County career centers will begin to
offer virtual classes to adults in October. Roessner said virtual
high school classes should be on-line by the end of the year.
Credit from the classes counts toward a high school diploma and
would show up on a student's transcript no differently than if the
student went to school to pass the class.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery County hopes to roll out adult programs in January,
Boggess said. The Greene County Career Center is investigating the
on-line courses but has no definite plan to start them,
Superintendent Marsha Leonard.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very interested in learning more,'' Leonard said.

 _ SF CHRON  
 3Com to Spin Off Palm Unit
<TEXT>

 &QL; 
Seeking to cash in on the cachet of the popular Palm handheld
device, 3Com Corp. said yesterday that it plans to spin off its
Palm Computing Division into a separate publicly traded company.
</P>
<P>
   3Com has spent the past two years building up its handheld
electronic organizer unit into a $570 million business. The Palm
division is the fastest-growing part of the company and accounts
for 10 percent of 3Com's $5.77 billion in annual sales.
</P>
<P>
   But while sales of PalmPilot devices have soared, 3Com's main
line of business _ selling networking gear _ has slumped.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with the Santa Clara networking company said the
spin-off will allow 3Com to refocus its efforts on its core
business _ selling gear that connects computers to the Internet and
other networks.
</P>
<P>
   3Com has struggled to grow its networking business amid fierce
competition from giants such as Cisco Systems and Nortel Networks.
The company, which once was the leader in networking equipment, now
is the in the No.2 spot, having been beaten by San Jose's Cisco.
</P>
<P>
   3Com has faced slower-than-expected sales, inventory problems
and falling prices for modems and network interface cards. 3Com's
stock also has taken a beating, plummeting more than 40 percent
since December and taking 3Com's market value with it. Meanwhile,
companies like Cisco, Nortel and Lucent Technologies have seen
their shares soar.
</P>
<P>
   A spin-off is likely to help 3Com's stock price because the
company's shareholders ultimately will own stock in both companies.
3Com will sell up to 20 percent of Palm to the public in about
three months and then spin off the rest to 3Com shareholders.
Analysts speculated that the value of a Palm spin-off could be $5
billion to $10 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Benhamou, 3Com's chairman, said the market opportunity for
an independent handheld-computer company prompted the spin-off.
With more than 4 million devices shipped and 17,000 third-party
developers creating products for the Palm, Benhamou said, the
division is ripe for a spin-off.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps more importantly, Benhamou said, the separation will
give 3Com the flexibility it needs to regain its strength in the
networking business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people had worried about how we would handle both
handheld and networking, and some had even feared that we might be
distracted by handheld and that resources would be diverted away
from networking,'' Benhamou said. ``The risk of that happening has
now been addressed by virtue of creating two separate companies.''
</P>
<P>
   3Com got into the handheld market when it bought U.S. Robotics
for $7.3 billion in June 1997. U.S. Robotics owned Palm Computing,
which it bought from three developers who invented the Palm
personal digital assistant in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Palm devices have been wildly successful, capturing 68 percent
of the worldwide handheld-computer market. The devices have thrived
in the face of competition from Microsoft's Windows CE operating
system and Apple Computer, which tried to compete with its
disastrous Newton product.
</P>
<P>
   But the handheld-computer business never really jibed with
3Com's core technology _ making gear that links networks together
and routes information across computers and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   And while the handheld-computer market is expected to be a
multibillion-dollar business, the earnings potential is even
greater within the $50 billion networking industry.
</P>
<P>
   Industry watchers said shedding Palm will help 3Com in its quest
to capture a piece of the lucrative networking pie while still
getting value from the PalmPilot.
</P>
<P>
   ``3Com officials are in a position right now where they have to
look at their company as a whole and get the most value for the
best parts of their company,'' said Matt Barzowskas, vice president
of FAC Equities in Boston. ``The Palm part of their company has
been doing very well, but it hasn't fit into the overall structure
of the company. The best way to get the value for the shareholders
is to spin it off into its own company.''
</P>
<P>
   Alan Kessler, president of Palm Computing, said a separate
venture will help quell anxiety among some 3Com customers who
feared that the company was getting too ``Palm-centric.''
</P>
<P>
   And 3Com officials acknowledged that having to manage two
diverse businesses had become difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``Palm is a great business, but it doesn't really fit,'' said
Janice Roberts, a senior vice president at 3Com. ``We're talking to
major corporate clients, and they're talking to us about networking
infrastructure, but they see us as a company promoting
handheld-computer devices. It is a stretch for the management
executive team'' to deal with both businesses.
</P>
<P>
   For 3Com, however, losing Palm, means losing the fastest-growing
part of its business. That's likely to create a revenue pinch that
will sting for quite a while, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Splitting off Palm is a necessary evil,'' said Jill House, an
analyst with International Data Corp. ``It is likely to represent a
revenue loss for 3Com ... but in a way, it will make them better
positioned in the networking market because it won't split their
focus. It didn't make any sense for them to be integrated, but I
don't think the split will happen without a little shedding of
tears.''
</P>
<P>
   On the flip side, the potential for an independent Palm is
``tremendous,'' House said, because the company will be better able
to shift direction and tackle new technologies.
</P>
<P>
   ``This allows them to get into many areas that they weren't in
before. If they want to make a quick, agile move into a new
direction, they will be able to. They won't have the huge overhead
of a massive company like 3Com hanging over them,'' House said.
</P>
<P>
   And Palm will need to be nimble as competition in the
handheld-device market heats up.
</P>
<P>
   Palm faces a challenge from wireless cell phones that can access
the Internet and other electronic organizers, such as HandSpring's
Visor, which hits shelves today. Ironically, the creators of
HandSpring's new handheld device _ which promises to be cheaper and
better than the Palm _ are the same people who created the original
PalmPilot.

CITING FREE SPEECH, HOUSE REPUBLICANS URGE VOTE AGAINST BAN ON
DONATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the House prepared to vote Tuesday on an array
of rival proposals to change campaign-finance laws, Republican
leaders made a final push to head off passage of bipartisan
legislation to ban unregulated donations to political parties.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter Monday to fellow House members, Rep. J.C. Watts Jr.,
of Oklahoma, the fourth-ranking member of the Republican
leadership, urged lawmakers to vote against the legislation
sponsored by Reps. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., and Martin T.
Meehan, D-Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Watts argued that the initiative to curb the flow of
special-interest money into campaigns would violate guarantees of
free speech.
</P>
<P>
   For the bill to be constitutional, he said, the First Amendment
would have to be recast to say, ``Congress shall make no law ...
abridging the freedom of speech unless that speech supports or
opposes a cause or is made anonymously or occurs in September or
October of an even-numbered year or is intended to educate the
public about candidates' voting records, or is communicated over
the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tom DeLay, R-Texas, the powerful majority whip, has also
sent out letters to Republicans in recent days opposing the bill.
</P>
<P>
   The question of how to regulate campaign spending moved to
center stage after the 1996 presidential campaign, in which both
parties went to new lengths to get around the campaign-finance
restrictions enacted in the 1970s after the Watergate scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Most Democrats support the Shays-Meehan legislation, but
Republican leaders have made repeated efforts to kill it, arguing
that it violates the Constitution and that it would end their
party's traditional fund-raising advantage.
</P>
<P>
   The supporters of the bill, who argue that the race for campaign
funds is corrupting Congress, were optimistic Tuesday that their
measure would prevail over several others. ``Hopefully we are going
to have good broad support like we did last year,'' said Rep.
Stephen Horn, R-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The Shays-Meehan legislation would ban ``soft money,'' the
unregulated, unlimited donations to political parties that have
escalated in recent years as a way to circumvent limits on campaign
contributions. It would also rein in issue advertisements by
outside advocacy groups during the election season.
</P>
<P>
   The House will also be considering several rival measures: a
less stringent ban on soft money to the national political parties
but not the state political parties; a measure that would repeal
contribution limits and substitute tighter disclosure, and a
measure that would strengthen some of the powers of the Federal
Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Under the rules established for the debate, the passage of any
of those alternatives would serve to defeat the Shays-Meehan bill.
Supporters of the bipartisan bill said they were particularly
concerned that the bill concerning the Federal Election Commission
could prevail because in other circumstances it would have broad
bipartisan support.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the measure to ban soft-money donations passes the House
it still faces an uphill battle in the Senate, where it died in a
Republican-led filibuster last year. Speaker Dennis Hastert made it
a test of his leadership this year to postpone the House debate
until the fall, in order to prevent pressure from building on the
Senate for passage.

VENCOR FILES FOR BANKRUPTCY CITING CUTS IN MEDICARE FEES 
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Del., Ky.) (ms) 
 By MILT FREUDENHEIM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Blaming cuts in Medicare payments, Vencor Inc., a troubled
nursing home chain that expanded and took on debt at the wrong
time, filed for protection Monday under Chapter 11 of the federal
bankruptcy laws.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which operates 300 nursing homes and 60 hospitals,
also asked the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Del., for
protection for more than 100 of its units.
</P>
<P>
   Vencor, based in Louisville, Ky., lost more than $600 million in
the fourth quarter of 1998 and $64 million in the first half of
1999. In April, it said that survival was an issue. In May, it
missed a $14.8 million payment to noteholders.
</P>
<P>
   ``The writing was clearly on the wall,'' said Michael J. Kaplan,
a health care analyst at Standard &AMP; Poor's, the credit rating firm,
which no longer rates Vencor's debt.
</P>
<P>
   Edward L. Kuntz, chief executive of Vencor, said the bankruptcy
filing was necessary ``because of dramatic changes'' affecting the
long-term-care industry, notably Medicare cuts. Under the 1997
budget law, Medicare is shifting payments to preset fees for each
patient, replacing payments that covered costs plus an additional
fee.
</P>
<P>
   The filing was also necessary, Kuntz said, to enable Vencor to
``create a sustainable capital structure.'' Vencor also said it was
negotiating to settle government charges that it had overcharged
$90 million for Medicare patients.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Vencor would try to pare down debt and reduce
rental payments on buildings that it leases.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it had agreements from a bank group headed by
the Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. to lend it $100 million to continue
operating. Vencor listed assets of $1.71 billion and debts of $1.4
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Most nursing homes operated by chains get at least 30 percent of
their revenues from Medicare. Such payments are far less important
for most small nursing homes, which still dominate the industry. A
number of chains borrowed heavily to expand several years ago, when
Medicare was encouraging nursing care as an alternative to
expensive hospital stays.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, when chains like HCR Manor Care and Beverly
Enterprises sold assets to prepare for the cuts, Vencor gave up
flexibility to shrink down, analysts said. It split in two and
transferred properties to a new real estate company, Ventas Inc.,
headed by W. Bruce Lunsford, a co-founder of Vencor.
</P>
<P>
   Ventas said Monday that the outcome at Vencor could
significantly affect Ventas' revenues and ability to repay or
refinance a $275 million bridge loan due on Oct 30. Ventas, which
gets 99 percent of its income from Vencor, suspended payments to
stockholders in July.
</P>
<P>
   Ventas shares fell 6.25 cents Monday, to $3.9375 on the New York
Stock Exchange, down from a 52-week high of $13.75 in January.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for Vencor and Ventas did not reply Monday to requests
for comment.

 &HT;    Uncle Sam wants you...in his survey
 &HT;    By Laura A. Bischoff

<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Do you have trouble finding blue jeans that fit?
Feel cramped in stadium seats? Are car radio dials just out of
reach for you?
</P>
<P>
   Well, take heart. Researchers at Wright Patterson Air Force Base
are measuring 9,000 regular folks across the United States, Canada
and Europe, building a massive database that will eventually be
used in designing all sorts of products such as cars, farm tractors
and underwear.
</P>
<P>
   The Civilian American and European Surface Anthropometry
Resource _ CAESAR _ survey has collected body measurements in nine
cities in the U.S. and Canada, including Dayton. Data collection
will finish in the U.S. by Nov. 23 and final results are due a year
later, said Sherri Blackwell, a CAESAR investigator.
</P>
<P>
   There is a lot of talk about how Americans have gotten heavier
and taller over the years as diets and lifestyles have changed, but
not a lot of hard data, she said. ``When we get all done I want to
know: How heavy are we? How big are we?''
</P>
<P>
   More than 20 companies _ including General Motors Corp., Levi
Strauss, Dayton Hudson Corp., John Deere and Hanes _ are helping to
sponsor the $6 million U.S. Air Force study.
</P>
<P>
   Although the military conducted a study in 1988, the last
comprehensive measurement survey of the civilian population was in
the 1940s, Blackwell said. The CAESAR information will be used to
design products, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers hope to measure 4,000 people in the U.S. and Canada
and 5,000 more in Europe. Participants are recruited by sponsoring
companies and through advertising. They must be between 18 and 65
years old and be able to climb one step.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy-one small white stickers are placed on anatomical
landmarks. Participants are weighed and measured for head size and
sitting height before entering a laser-scanner that captures their
shape in 17 seconds. The result is 47 precise measurements such as
waist and hips and shoulder width.
</P>
<P>
   Participants are not paid, but may receive trinkets such as tie
tacks, ball caps or gift certificates from sponsoring companies,
Blackwell said. ``Not really the kind of incentive that is going to
draw you in if you're not interested in the research itself,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, participants will have the satisfaction of influencing
product design with their own bodies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a chance for anyone in the population. You can come in
and get measured and your data set will be used,'' she said.

COAST GUARD USING SHARPSHOOTERS TO STOP BOATS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DAVID STOUT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Updating a tactic last employed during Prohibition,
the Coast Guard is using sharpshooters on helicopters to disable
the engines of drug smugglers' boats with rifle fire, the service
disclosed Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The commandant of the Coast Guard, Adm. James Loy, said that the
sharpshooters were deployed in recent weeks and that their bullets
had brought two drug-laden boats to a stop in the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   Loy also said that law-abiding boaters or fishermen need not
fear getting shot at, because rifle fire is used only after
repeated warnings to stop, and only after a boat's pursuers are
certain it is a drug-runner. ``If there's a new risk on the part of
the bad guys, that's terrific,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The admiral's press aide, Cmdr. Pat Philbin, said the tactic _
reminiscent of the days when the Coast Guard occasionally fired at
rum-runners from aircraft _ was decided upon after Coast Guard
patrols wearied of seeing smugglers' boats race by at up to 60
knots. ``They would go by and wave at us,'' he said. ``Literally.''
</P>
<P>
   Philbin said law-enforcement agencies had noticed an increase in
recent years of super-fast boats, 30 to 45 feet long, equipped with
up to four powerful engines and carrying enough extra fuel for a
700-mile round trip as they brought drugs from Colombia across the
Caribbean to Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The boats, usually with a crew of two to five, have been known
to carry up to 3,000 pounds of cocaine, Philbin said. He estimated
that before turning to airborne snipers, the Coast Guard caught
perhaps one boat in 10 _ ``and that might be when they blew an
engine.''
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard estimates that 85 percent of all maritime drug
shipments are made on the new speedboats, whose use has doubled in
the last three years.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Monday the Coast Guard was a bit coy, as
Philbin was in a telephone interview. How many airborne marksmen
were there, and from what range did they fire, and what kind of
weapons did they use? ``I'd rather not say much,'' the commander
replied.
</P>
<P>
   One sharpshooter, Charlie Hopkins of Winslow, Maine, was
credited with disabling a smugglers' vessel on Aug. 16 with three
shots from a rifle.
</P>
<P>
   The news conference on Monday featured Transportation Secretary
Rodney Slater, whose department is the Coast Guard's parent agency,
and Gen. Barry McCaffrey, director of the White House's office of
drug-control policy.
</P>
<P>
   They talked of the 53 tons of cocaine that had been seized by
the federal authorities since Oct. 1 (the beginning of the current
fiscal year), and the $17.8 billion that the Clinton administration
wants for anti-drug efforts in the next fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard officials talked about nonlethal weapons like a
``stingball'' that explodes into a shower of rubber bullets, and a
special net that can ensnare a boat's engines.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the two boats disabled by bullets in recent weeks, two
others surrendered after a helicopter pursuit before bullets had to
be used, the Coast Guard said. Together, the four seizures yielded
about 2,600 pounds of drugs and 13 suspected smugglers.
</P>
<P>
   And would Philbin agree that hitting an engine in a moving boat
on a bobbing sea from a vibrating helicopter required pretty good
shooting, even with a laser sight? ``No,'' he said. ``It's very
good shooting.''

A LEAK FROM STARR'S OFFICE WAS NOT ILLEGAL, COURT SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A federal appeals court ruled Monday that there was
nothing illegal in discussions by Kenneth Starr, the independent
counsel, or his aides with reporters about deliberations over
whether to indict President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The unanimous three-judge panel reversed a ruling by U.S.
District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson that the independent
counsel's office had leaked secret grand jury information and told
her to rescind her order directing the Justice Department to
investigate Starr's office and his former spokesman over an article
that appeared in The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's ruling disclosed that Johnson had, last July, secretly
ordered the department to investigate the office of the independent
counsel and its former spokesman, Charles Bakaly, who was forced to
resign last March over his role in the Times article.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals panel said Johnson erred by adopting an overly broad
definition of the kind of grand jury information that prosecutors
may not discuss with reporters. The judges said that any leaks by
Starr's office or Bakaly that may have contributed to the article
were not illegal.
</P>
<P>
   The Times reported in January that Starr had concluded that he
had the constitutional authority to seek a grand jury indictment of
Clinton before he leaves office in January 2001. The article said
Starr had not made a final decision to do so but his conclusion
that he had the authority to indict a sitting president followed an
intense discussion in the office of the independent counsel. The
article's assertions were attributed to ``several associates of Mr.
Starr.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday's ruling provides what appears to be a fresh and
expansive definition of what prosecutors may discuss publicly and
with reporters. It came in response to an appeal of Johnson's order
that was brought not only by Starr and Bakaly but also by the
Justice Department itself. The department was concerned that its
hundreds of federal prosecutors could be liable for their regular
discussions with reporters about criminal cases.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is a law that prohibits prosecutors from publicly
discussing ``matters occurring before the grand jury,'' a phrase
contained in Rule 6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.
</P>
<P>
   But the appeals court ruled Monday that ``internal deliberations
of prosecutors that do not directly reveal grand jury proceedings
are not Rule 6(e) material.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and his lawyer, David Kendall, had argued before Johnson
that Starr and his associates were engaging in a purposeful and
illegal campaign to leak damaging information about the president
to aid their investigation. Starr had responded that any
discussions he and his aides held with reporters did not disclose
6(e) material and were therefore permissible.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall said Monday he strongly disagreed with the appeals court
ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that the decision of the panel is inconsistent with
the precedents of the Court of Appeals,'' he said. Kendall said
that he will seek to have Monday's ruling reconsidered by the full
appeals court, a procedure the court employs in a small number of
extraordinary cases.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling, a setback for the president, was a victory for Starr
and a more limited one for Bakaly. According to the opinion, Bakaly
filed a declaration that in his discussions with the reporter from
the Times, Don Van Natta Jr., he ``refused to confirm or comment on
what Judge Starr or the Office of Independent Counsel was thinking
or doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Starr ordered an investigation by the FBI of any
leaks even if they were not illegal. After that investigation,
Starr's office withdrew its earlier assertion that it was not the
source of any information in the Times article. Bakaly resigned
shortly afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Editors at the Times have said that they do not and will not
discuss the sources for the article.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It was unclear how the appeals court ruling would affect an
earlier decision by Johnson in which she held that 24 other news
articles and broadcasts appeared on their face to show that
prosecutors in Starr's office had leaked grand jury material.
</P>
<P>
   Those 24 news accounts include articles from the Times as well
as Newsweek, Brill's Content, The Washington Post and The Boston
Globe and broadcasts from ABC, NBC, CBS, CNN and the Fox network.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, in a ruling last Oct. 30 said the articles demonstrated
``serious and repetitive'' violations of the law against disclosing
grand jury secrets.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's office has appealed Johnson's ruling on the other
articles. The case has not yet been decided on appeal.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the Times article concerning Clinton's possible
indictment by Starr's office, three appeals court judges, Patricia
M. Wald, Laurence Silberman and Karen LeCraft Henderson, ruled in
their unsigned opinion that the appeals court had never meant that
a ``veil of secrecy be drawn over all matters occurring in the
world that happens to be investigated by a grand jury.''
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court said prosecutors' statements about their
investigations are only a problem when ``they directly reveal grand
jury matters.''

ONE-MAN SHOWS PUT THE TEAMS AT RISK

<P>
   Rick, Ray and Tom.
</P>
<P>
   That is what Bill Parcells answered after the floor fell from
beneath the Jets on Sunday when Vinny Testaverde was lost for the
season with a ruptured left Achilles' tendon. Are you going to seek
another quarterback through a trade, he was asked? Certainly, it
could be done all the way up to 4 p.m. on Oct. 19 when the trading
deadline kicks in.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells answered: ``No. We'll go with Rick, Ray and Tom.''
</P>
<P>
   Rick and the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   Ray and the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   Tom and the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   None of that sounds like Vinny and the Jets. No ring to it. For
Jets fans, this is not sweet music. But that is what the Jets say
they will do, run with Rick Mirer, Ray Lucas and Tom Tupa at
quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Run? Walk? Could be a crawl.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday for the Jets was like a party where every balloon was
popped. Like a ship that ran into an iceberg. Like a train that
jumped off track. Like somebody pulling on a thread until the suit
unraveled, leaving you bare.
</P>
<P>
   Exposed.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets are not alone. The first week of the season reminded
everyone of how important quarterbacks are, how they color the
personalities of their teams, gain so much attention and adulation
and blame. How you cannot win without a good one. How wonderful it
is to have a pair of good ones.
</P>
<P>
   Teams used to stockpile at the position before free agency. In
the last 20 years we saw Staubach and White in Dallas, Schroeder
and Williams in Washington, Simms and Hostetler with the Giants,
Montana and Young in San Francisco. We saw more teams deep at the
position with healthy competition and without a huge drop in talent
if the starter was injured. Then as now, teams usually kept a total
of three quarterbacks, but the first two were more often first rate
in quality.
</P>
<P>
   That is much harder to do nowadays.
</P>
<P>
   Free agency means that, at some point in their careers, most
quarterbacks will be free to move to other teams. The salary cap
for each team means that it must decide its allotment of cap money
to spend on quarterbacks and simultaneously field talented players,
especially superstars, around them.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the questions teams have pondered in this new football era
is: Do we spend more on two top-rate quarterbacks and try to get by
on the edges in filling out our team? Or do we sign a great
starting quarterback complemented by only a decent backup and a
handyman as the third guy and try to milk it? Most teams go with a
top guy and try to milk it.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to quarterbacking duos, there are four teams ahead
of the class: Buffalo (Doug Flutie, Rob Johnson), the Giants (Kent
Graham, Kerry Collins), Minnesota (Randall Cunningham, Jeff George)
and San Diego (Jim Harbaugh, Erik Kramer). Kansas City is close
with Elvis Grbac and Warren Moon, but for the other teams, it is
primarily a one-man quarterback show with a prayer that the backup
could step to the forefront.
</P>
<P>
   What does a ``one-quarterback'' team do when the one flops?
</P>
<P>
   In San Francisco, the 49ers wondered what they would possibly do
without Steve Young and now they are slightly worried about Young _
he was not sharp in a 41-3 embarrassment dished by Jacksonville.
Scott Mitchell, the new starter in Baltimore, started slowly in his
team's 17-point loss at St. Louis. Cleveland's Ty Detmer (6 for 13
passing, 52 yards, 1 interception, 2 first downs gained and no
points) labored against Pittsburgh, which scored 43 points.
</P>
<P>
   But no quarterback on Sunday melted like Tampa Bay's Trent
Dilfer.
</P>
<P>
   It was not just his numbers _ 16 incompletions and 3
interceptions. It was that he helped the Giants score all of their
points in his team's 17-13 defeat. Dilfer was sacked and fumbled,
and the Giants picked up the ball and scored. A Dilfer interception
was returned for a touchdown. Another Dilfer interception set up a
Giants field goal.
</P>
<P>
   He was benched for the team's final four series and his backup,
Eric Zeier, helped his team gain a total of 17 yards in those four
possessions and also threw an interception in the final two
minutes, one that crushed any Tampa Bay hopes. Only the rookie
Shaun King is left for Tampa Bay after Dilfer and Zeier.
</P>
<P>
   Now, that is a quarterback problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult to look those guys in the eye,'' Dilfer said of
his teammates. But they are looking him squarely in his eyes. This
is his seventh pro season. He has made 65 consecutive starts. Tampa
Bay entered this season thinking Super Bowl. Now what?
</P>
<P>
   On the flip side, Brett Favre played so coolly and
enthusiastically in Green Bay's last-seconds 28-24 victory over
Oakland that it made him cry. Troy Aikman was superb, winning by
41-35 in overtime at Washington. Peyton Manning for Indianapolis,
Kurt Warner for St. Louis, Drew Bledsoe for New England, Charlie
Batch for Detroit and Kordell Stewart for Pittsburgh enjoyed happy
opening days.
</P>
<P>
   These were among the quarterbacks on Sunday who lifted their
teams with energetic and big plays. But in each scenario mentioned,
if they go down with injury, so will their teams.
</P>
<P>
   This brings us back to the Jets. They are hoping for a near
miracle, one that they have seen happen.
</P>
<P>
   There was a quarterback who played for three teams. He threw 35
interceptions in his second pro season. He had a quarterback rating
as low as 48.8 and never higher than 88.7. And then he joined the
Jets and in his first season, as a starter, threw 29 touchdown
passes, only 7 interceptions and offered a spellbinding 101.6
quarterback rating. He helped lead his team to a division title and
the conference championship game.
</P>
<P>
   That was Testaverde last season.
</P>
<P>
   Mirer has played for three teams. He threw 20 interceptions in
1995 in Seattle. He threw six interceptions and no touchdowns in
Chicago in 1997. His quarterback rating has been as low as 37.7 and
never higher than 70.2.
</P>
<P>
   And then he joined the Jets this year. Now as the starter.
</P>
<P>
   Rick and the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   Run? Walk? Crawl?

<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ The doors to the New York Jets' locker room
opened at 12:30 on Monday afternoon, as they do every Monday after
a Sunday game. But the scene inside on Monday was different.
Instead of players sitting in front of their lockers, waiting for
reporters to question them about what went right or wrong on
Sunday, most of the lockers were empty, with players nowhere in
sight.
</P>
<P>
   Except, that is, for one section of the locker room, where the
offensive linemen sat in a circle, resembling a self-help group of
300-pounders as they talked to one another about the next step in a
season that began with the unthinkable _ a season-ending injury to
quarterback Vinny Testaverde.
</P>
<P>
   Circle the wagons. Circle the chairs. ``The guys were just
disappointed,'' said center Kevin Mawae when asked what the lineman
had talked about. He said the team had to ``find some ways'' to
battle back, to keep thinking that this season could still be
special, that the Jets could still be a force.
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps the Jets will find a way. But many of them were
still reeling in the wake of Sunday's 30-28 upset victory by the
Patriots, the defeat more or less eclipsed by the loss of
Testaverde, who will be joined on the sideline the rest of the year
by Leon Johnson, the dangerous third-down back and punt returner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now this is a pretty difficult set of circumstances for
us,'' Coach Bill Parcells said at Monday's news conference. He
wasn't asking for sympathy, but he dutifully cited the casualty
list _ the standout receiver Wayne Chrebet, who broke his foot in
the final preseason game and is out for another month; tight end
Eric Green, who was temporarily immobilized by a pinched nerve in
Sunday's game and whose status is uncertain; nose tackle Jason
Ferguson who will miss at least Sunday's game against Buffalo with
a sprained ankle and knee and, of course, Testaverde.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last eight days we've lost four starters, and one guy,
Leon Johnson, a productive player,'' Parcells said.
</P>
<P>
   For Parcells, the immediate reaction to all this misfortune was
to sit tight _ at least at quarterback. No, he said, he is not
bringing in another quarterback to back up Rick Mirer, who, like it
or not, will now direct the Jets' offense. In particular, he ruled
out Jeff Hostetler, who came off the bench to replace an injured
Phil Simms when Parcells was coaching the Giants in 1990 and went
on to be the winning quarterback in the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's 38 years old,'' Parcells said of Hostetler, who is
currently out of football. ``I don't think so. Not right now.''
</P>
<P>
   But there were other moves that Parcells made on Monday, or
suggested he might make, to deal with the current situation:
</P>
<P>
   _He may bring back the ageless Keith Byars for the second time
this season, to help at tight end or fullback.
</P>
<P>
   _He re-signed Ernie Logan, a backup nose tackle he had cut on
Saturday. Logan will probably start for Ferguson.
</P>
<P>
   _He may reluctantly use Dedric Ward, now starting in place of
Chrebet, in a dual role as a punt returner.
</P>
<P>
   _He may use the recently acquired Bernie Parmalee, a
special-teams stalwart, as a third-down replacement for Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, said Parcells, he will activate quarterback Ray
Lucas, making him the No. 3 signal caller. But on Sunday night in
Orchard Park, N.Y., against the Bills, it will be Mirer starting
and punter Tom Tupa as the probable backup. Tupa played relatively
well in that role after Testaverde was injured in the second
quarter Sunday, even connecting on two touchdown passes before
Mirer replaced him in the final quarter.
</P>
<P>
   So for the now it's Mirer and Tupa, two question marks at
quarterback in a season in which the Jets were being talked about
as strong Super Bowl contenders. How, Parcells was asked, could he
stop the team from feeling sorry for itself in its current
situation?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I don't know that I can,'' Parcells said. ``At least
temporarily.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Parcells would not talk on Monday as if he had given
up, although he has now lost a quarterback who posted a 12-1 record
as a starter last season.
</P>
<P>
   He said his coaching brain trust would start devising strategies
to maximize Mirer's talents. While the 29-year-old Mirer is
basically a pocket passer, he does have more mobility than
Testaverde and has rushed for more than 950 yards in his seven-year
career.
</P>
<P>
   Like Testaverde, Mirer was considered a top college quarterback,
was a first-round draft pick and began his National Football League
career with a struggling team. But while Testaverde gradually
developed into a potentially dangerous quarterback as he moved from
Tampa Bay to Cleveland and then to Baltimore before coming to the
Jets, Mirer has yet to demonstrate that kind of ability.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Parcells contended on Monday that he didn't think it
was right to assume ``that we won't be functioning offensively.''
And linebacker Bryan Cox, who will answer questions through good
times and bad and nearly stole the game for the Jets on Sunday with
a second-half touchdown interception, chafed at any suggestion that
the season has come crashing down:
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as we believe and go out and practice with a purpose
and do what we're supposed to do, it doesn't matter what the league
thinks or what the fans think or what the media thinks,'' he said.
``I didn't bust my butt all off season to come here and give up
after one week.''

BUCHANAN MAY LEAVE REPUBLICANS FOR REFORM PARTY 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Deletes prior 8th graf, ``Indeed, the potential ...'' to
delete how Buchanan might do in a general election.)  
(lb) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ They have cajoled him. They have scolded him. They
have floated jobs in a future Republican administration and special
roles in the party.
</P>
<P>
   But on Monday, top Republican officials seemed all but resigned
to the likelihood that Pat Buchanan, the fiery conservative
commentator, would bolt from the Republican Party and seek the
presidential nomination of Ross Perot's Reform Party, a move they
fear could drain precious votes from the eventual Republican
nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Although Buchanan has made no formal announcement of his plans,
he made it clear over the last two days that he was disillusioned
by the Republican Party, calling it a ``Xerox copy'' of the
Democratic Party, and that he was strongly leaning toward a
third-party bid.
</P>
<P>
   His remarks produced a mixture of pessimism and anger among top
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is like a spoiled little kid who picks up his marbles and
goes someplace else because he doesn't get his way,'' said Robert
Bennett, chairman of the Ohio Republican Party. ``Pat is frustrated
because his message isn't getting out. But if he leaves the party,
he becomes a dead duck as far as Republicans are concerned. He'll
become another Harold Stassen _ every four years he shows up.''
</P>
<P>
   Henry McMaster, chairman of the South Carolina Republican Party,
said: ``There's nothing anyone can do once someone makes up their
mind. This is unfortunate news, because Pat Buchanan's got a lot of
friends in the Republican Party _ and he's going to lose them if he
leaves the party.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked how damaging a Buchanan bid could be, McMaster recalled
Perot's third-party run in 1992. ``It would hurt,'' he said. ``It
certainly hurt George Bush. We lost an election because of it.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Republican straw poll in Iowa last month, the party's
front-runner, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, asked Buchanan to stay
in the party and, according to Bush's advisers, the two have also
discussed the issue on the telephone. But one adviser to Bush said
that the governor had given up trying to persuade Buchanan to stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very hard to pull this one off the ledge,'' the adviser
said, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``We really believe that
there are things in a campaign that you can control and things that
you can't control.''
</P>
<P>
   The adviser said there had been informal discussions, inside and
outside the Bush campaign, of offering inducements to Buchanan, but
that they had not been offered. ``What are we going to do?'' the
adviser asked. ``Make him chief trade negotiator? We don't want to
insult him by trying to offer him something.''
</P>
<P>
   The adviser said Bush had also tried an indirect approach by
dispatching emissaries, including people Buchanan worked with in
the Nixon White House, to chat with the candidate. But it has been
to no avail. Jim Nicholson, the Republican national chairman, last
met with Buchanan in March. They have set up another meeting,
possibly for nextweek. But many Republicans said it would be too
late.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks Buchanan has resisted meeting with Nicholson. Indeed,
in an interview Monday on the NBC News program ``Today,'' Buchanan
was dismissive of Nicholson. ``I don't know the chairman that
well,'' he said. ``Frankly, I have been in the Republican Party and
fought for it longer than he has. So I'm not sure what he can say
to me to change my mind from where I'm going.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan, who said he would make a final decision early next
month, asserted that he could no longer distinguish the Republican
and Democratic parties and felt alienated from his party on foreign
policy and other matters.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In another effort to distance himself, Buchanan has withdrawn
from a scheduled appearance this weekend with other Republican
candidates at a party gathering on Mackinac Island, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   Lyn Nofziger, a veteran Republican strategist who backs Buchanan
for the Republican presidential nomination but opposes a move to a
third party, said he did not expect his friend to stay in the
party. ``I don't think that George W. could talk him out of it,''
Nofziger said. ``I don't think that Jim Nicholson could talk him
out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Kaufman, the party's national committeeman from
Massachusetts, agreed that there was little more anyone could do.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears likely from what I hear from the folks close to him
and around him that he's going the other way,'' Kaufman said. ``If
he doesn't want to stay, it's a free world out there.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason Republicans are particularly unsettled is that
Buchanan, a hard-driving campaigner, won the crucial New Hampshire
Republican primary in 1996. Four years before that, his insurgent
campaign sent shock waves through President George Bush's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I call him the front-runner and I'm not kidding,'' Steve
Duprey, chairman of the New Hampshire Republican Party, said of
Buchanan. ``People have made a career of underestimating Pat
Buchanan. He knows how to run and do well in the New Hampshire
primary.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not entirely clear that Buchanan could get the Reform
Party's nomination. ``The only thing that could keep him out of it
is some indication that he may not be able to pick up the Reform
Party nomination,'' Nofziger said.
</P>
<P>
   The Reform Party's biggest-name elected official, Gov. Jesse
Ventura of Minnesota, has been less than enthusiastic about a
Buchanan candidacy. The party has stayed clear of divisive social
issues like abortion and homosexuality, issues on which Buchanan
holds hard-edged conservative views.
</P>
<P>
   But some in the Reform Party say Buchanan's views on changing
the campaign-spending laws and his isolationist stands on foreign
policy would mesh well.
</P>
<P>
   Clifford May, communications director for the Republican
National Committee, said he still held out hope that Buchanan would
remain in the party. ``We hope that he will recognize that he does
not want to do anything that would benefit Al Gore, Bill Bradley
and others on the left,'' May said, ``or do anything that would
harm that conservative movement for which he has worked so hard for
so many years.''

U.S. OPEN RECOVERED NICELY AFTER ITS ROCKY START 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ROBIN FINN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK - So what if history was not made at the 1999 U.S.
Open, the one that sandwiched itself between two hurricanes and,
like a Broadway hoofer with two sore feet, somehow went on with the
show.
</P>
<P>
   There were great strides, great ratings and a couple of
do-it-yourself stars, one of them a bold 17-year-old who spent her
formative years belting balls and dodging gang-related bullets on
public courts in Compton, Calif., the other a charismatic Las Vegan
who bounced from No. 1 to skid row in the ranking and back again.
Together, they compensated for the headliners who went missing at
curtain time.
</P>
<P>
   As 29-year-old Andre Agassi, the Open's eventual winner, cracked
wise or, depending on the interpretation, waxed humble at the iffy
start of the fortnight, ``It's still going to be a good Open, and
I'll do my part.''
</P>
<P>
   When it was over, neither the absence of the five-time champion
Steffi Graf, who opted for retirement at 30, nor the early
withdrawals of Pete Sampras and Patrick Rafter because of injuries,
could detract from the final results. After 14 days pulling hard
duty on the hardcourts, Agassi, an iron-pumping guy on the rebound,
and Serena Williams, an iron-pumping gal on the rise, had
commandeered the story lines of this year's Open and hung on tight.
</P>
<P>
   ``So my dad has been right all along, all these years; I've been
a super riser,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a deliberate absence of conventional seasoning on the
junior circuit, Williams not only became the Open's fifth-youngest
winner in her first Grand Slam final but also stretched the
family's two-week Open take to $1.29 million by capturing the
women's doubles title with her 19-year-old sister, Venus.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Sampras, gunning for that record 13th Grand Slam singles
title, was sorely missed (but not by his fellow competitors). Maybe
Graf, who had dreamed about a fairy tale finish to her career in
New York, was sorely missed (but not by her fellow competitors).
Maybe Rafter, with his Road Warrior zinc oxide mask and his macho
acrobatics, was sorely missed (but mostly by the female fans
craving one of his sweaty shirts or wristbands).
</P>
<P>
   No, Sampras didn't break his tie with Roy Emerson for most men's
Grand Slam titles, and Graf didn't collect a 23rd Slam title, the
one that might have jolted her from her self-absorption and
inspired a chase for Margaret Court's career record 24 Slam titles.
Instead, this Open brought novelty to the forefront, and not always
charitably.
</P>
<P>
   Those teen-age divas from Wimbledon, Mirjana Lucic, Jelena
Dokic, and Alexandra Stevenson, were duds on the hardcourts of the
National Tennis Center. Jennifer Capriati's reward for restoring
herself to Grand Slam shape eight years after her riveting run to
the 1991 semifinals, was yet another interrogation session with a
news media more interested in ferreting out what she had done wrong
in the past than noticing what she was doing right in the present.
Lindsay Davenport was an unconvincing defending champion once the
going got rough against Serena Williams.
</P>
<P>
   By the final weekend, when the cast of characters had been
weeded down to eight semifinalists, the difference between the two
sexes was glaring: on the men's side, three of the final four were
29 or older, a graying landscape of veterans in a state of
reinvention. But on the women's side, three of the four were
teen-agers, further proof that the women's game has been
stockpiling fresh talent the way a diligent greenskeeper lays in
fresh sod.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's different because the women are young and they're going
to get better,'' said Agassi, who congratulated 29-year-old Todd
Martin, an Open runner-up with designs on a teaching career, on his
longevity. Just as it was five years between Open titles for
Agassi, it had been five years since Martin had reached a Slam
final. Agassi vowed to keep playing as long as he got better, but
not indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   ``My career at 29 is lasting pretty long,'' he said. ``Us guys
are kind of tapping into something that we kind of somewhere in the
back of our minds believe won't be around too long. We'll play that
one by ear.''
</P>
<P>
   But not at the 1999 Open: that's history. Of a sort.  &QL;

(ATTN: Texas, Calif.)  (js) 
 By DAVID JOHNSTON and NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Internal FBI documents disclosed Monday by a
Democratic lawmaker show that information about the use of
combustible tear-gas canisters used in the FBI assault on the
Branch Davidian compound near Waco, Texas, in 1993 had been in the
Justice Department's files for years and was even sent to Congress
no later than 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The documents cast new light on when different parts of the
government first had knowledge about the use of the flammable tear
gas and therefore may alter the dynamics of the renewed outcry over
events surrounding the FBI assault on the compound on April 19,
1993.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI documents were disclosed by Rep. Henry Waxman, a
California Democrat and member of the House Government Reform
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The documents released Monday show that even though the Justice
Department sent U.S. marshals to the FBI's headquarters two weeks
ago to seize infrared videotapes containing references to the use
of combustible tear gas, the department had for years possessed FBI
records that showed such devices were used at Waco. The seizure was
ordered by Attorney General Janet Reno, who was angry because she
had maintained for six years that the FBI had done nothing that
could have caused the fire.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the documents provide evidence that the FBI, which
has been accused of misleading the Justice Department about the
issue by some in Congress and the Clinton administration, did
provide information about the use of flammable rounds to Ms. Reno's
subordinates on several occasions. Ms. Reno has said that she had
never seen any documents on the subject until two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, there is no indication in the documents made public
Monday that FBI officials had clearly explained the implications of
using the flammable rounds to their civilian counterparts at the
Justice Department. Moreover, FBI officials had never said publicly
that their agents had used the rounds until last month, when they
said a ``very limited number'' of such canisters had been fired at
a concrete bunker hours before a deadly fire swept through another
structure on the compound. Investigators later found the bodies of
about 80 people, among them a number of children.
</P>
<P>
   In the documents, references to the canisters do not clearly
state that they were combustible but refer to them as ``military''
rounds, a type that uses a pyrotechnic device to pump out tear gas.
The vast majority of tear gas fired during the Branch Davidian
incident was in non-flammable canisters known as ``ferret'' rounds.
</P>
<P>
   The documents had been requested by Congress in preparation for
hearings held in July of 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department officials would not discuss the issue on the
record. A senior Justice Department official said that the
documents will be a subject of likely inquiry by former Sen. John
C. Danforth, who is leading an investigation into events at Waco.
``Certainly one thing Danforth will want to consider is whether
anyone at the Justice Department was aware of the significance of
the words on those pages,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate development, the Texas Rangers released a report
to Congress Monday that said the Rangers, who collected evidence
from the Davidian compound after the tear gas assault, had found
spent cartridges from two different types of sniper rifles. Both
were carried by FBI agents during the 51-day siege.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law enforcement officials said Monday that the shell
casings were collected by FBI agents after they had first arrived
in Texas in March 1993, and that they turned the spent cartridges
over to the Texas Rangers. The long-held position of the FBI was
that agents had not fired a single shot.
</P>
<P>
   Later, officials at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms
said its agents had fired the two types of weapons in question
during an early, ill-fated raid on the compound in February 1993.
But officials said they had never determined whether the shell
casings came from the ATF's weapons.
</P>
<P>
   In the Rangers' report, which had been subpoenaed by the House
Government Reform and Oversight Committee, the Texas law
enforcement agency also released a letter by a federal prosecutor
who had advised Ms. Reno that unidentified Justice Department
officials may have withheld facts from her regarding the FBI's use
of flammable tear-gas canisters.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``I have formed the belief that facts may have been kept from
you _ and quite possibly are being kept from you even now, by
components of the department,'' Assistant U.S. Attorney Bill
Johnston in Waco, Texas, wrote in an Aug. 30 letter.
</P>
<P>
   In June, the Rangers began re-examining material from the 24,000
pounds of evidence they collected in a homicide investigation that
followed the FBI assault. The report said that a casing had been
found for a 40 millimeter projectile that ``burns at 500 to 700
degrees Fahrenheit, and is capable of igniting flammable items.''
The contents of the Rangers' report was first disclosed Monday by
the Dallas Morning News.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday Waxman said he was releasing the FBI documents because
the chairman of the House Government Reform Committee, Rep. Dan
Burton, R-Ind., had said that Ms. Reno failed to inform Congress
about the combustible weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Burton's assertion came after it was disclosed on Friday that an
incomplete version of a 1993 FBI lab report had been sent to the
government reform panel as the committee was preparing for Waco
hearings in 1995. The FBI had sent the full 49-page report to the
Justice Department, but the Justice Department supplied only the
first 48 pages of the document to the committee. The final page of
the inventory of evidence collected at Waco was the only one that
contained a reference to a flammable tear gas canister.
</P>
<P>
   Burton has said that he would expand congressional hearings into
Waco, and his aides said Monday that they they are still trying to
determine exactly what documents were sent to the panel by the
Justice Department prior to the 1995 hearings.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Waxman acknowledged that the three documents _ two of
which were provided to the Justice Department by the FBI _ refer
explicitly to the use of military tear gas canisters.
</P>
<P>
   One document found in the Justice Department's files that was
sent to the committee in 1995 was an interview report of an FBI
agent dated June 6, 1993. In it the agent, Wayne Smith, recalled
hearing a conversation about ``some sort of military round'' being
used.
</P>
<P>
   The second document was a summary of testimony of members of the
Hostage Rescue Team, the FBI unit that carried out the tear-gas
assault. The summary said that there had been an ``attempt to
penetrate bunker w/1 military round and two ferret rounds. Military
round was grey bubblehead w/green base.''
</P>
<P>
   The third document was comprised of undated, handwritten notes
that appear to have been taken close to the date of the assault. It
said, ``smoke from bunker came when these guys tried to shoot gas
into bunker (military gas round).''

TESTAVERDE WILL HELP WHEREVER HE IS ABLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ This was the image that made the news: Vinny
Testaverde pounding the turf with his right fist. He pounded it as
if trying to grind out the memory of what he knew had just
happened: his season had been ended by a torn Achilles' tendon.
</P>
<P>
   His season, yes, but not his career, Testaverde, 35, insisted
Monday. He said he would not spend the next few months feeling
sorry for himself. Instead, Testaverde said, he hopes to help out
the other Jets quarterbacks as a sort of assistant coach while he
prepares for his return.
</P>
<P>
   He did not move Monday like a man who had undergone surgery just
12 hours before: there was no mistaking the athlete on crutches.
But for all the relative ease with which he got around with his
left foot in a cast, Testaverde wasn't going anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll have to go through some rehab for a couple of months,''
he said, with the optimism that has allowed him to last through the
weekly poundings in 12 professional football seasons only to be
hurt on Sunday with no contact.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Testaverde wants to help the quarterbacks coach Dan Henning
work with the backup quarterback Rick Mirer and whomever else the
Jets might use. ``I don't know what my role will be,'' Testaverde
said, ``but I wouldn't mind being an assistant to Coach Henning.''
</P>
<P>
   Tearing an Achilles' tendon is a more common injury for an older
athlete than a younger one. But Testaverde is also a very big man _
6 feet 5 inches and 232 pounds _ and so the healing process might
not be as a easy as it would be for, say, a 150-pounder. Still,
Testaverde said he thought it would not take him the maximum
projected time to rehabilitate his injury: nine months.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's for slow healers,'' he said, ``and I'm not a slow
healer.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, sitting out a year at his age could actually prolong his
career, because he will not take the physical toll of a full season
of football.
</P>
<P>
   But in the moment following the injury _ Coach Bill Parcells
described it as the same type of step people take every day _ none
of these thoughts crossed his mind.
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde had wanted to pounce on the ball, which had been
bobbled by Curtis Martin midway through the second quarter against
the New England Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I pushed off, I heard somebody falling behind me,''
Testaverde said. ``I actually started to turn to look who was
behind me, all within a split second. I thought, `Somebody fell,
somebody hit my ankle.' And my last thought was, `My Achilles
popped and I'm out for the season.'''
</P>
<P>
   He would not say the artificial turf was to blame. It is the
same carpet the Jets played on last year at Giants Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was never in pain,'' he said of the dramatic scene Sunday.
``It was just knowing my season was over. I don't know that it was
the turf. We'll never know. I pushed off pretty hard trying to get
the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting on the injury made Testaverde wistful. He said he had
always had to overcome obstacles. ``I didn't play until I was a
senior in high school, waiting for someone else to step down,'' he
said. ``I had to go to prep school because my grades weren't good
enough to get into college, but I excelled there.'' And then, ``I
got into the pros and played 12 years _ my best year was the
12th.''
</P>
<P>
   This season had seemed so promising, not just for the Jets, but
for Testaverde personally, another chance to continue to burnish
his image while winning.
</P>
<P>
   He had thought this season would surpass 1998, that all the
elements to help a quarterback had improved: a more potent tight
end in Eric Green, a healthy third-down running back in Leon
Johnson, a faster offensive line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know people still had doubts,'' he said, referring to his
own play. ``But last year was no fluke.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, he told his teammates Monday, ``I'm going to live this
season through you.'' &QL;

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   NEW YORK _ So many celebrities, so many hot pants to sell ...
</P>
<P>
   Before the Versus show Sunday night at Roseland _ before
Sylvester Stallone was hustled to his seat, causing a tremor of
``ahs'' along the lipstick-red runway, before Madonna plopped into
hers and whispered something to Rupert Everett _ a Versace press
agent redundantly handed out a sheet that said ``celebrity list.''
</P>
<P>
   Minnie Driver, Lisa Marie Presley, Missy Elliot, Steve Tyler,
Mary J. Blige, Julianne Moore, Spike Lee, Jon Bon Jovi, Natasha
Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   It was like being inside In Style magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Donatella Versace, with her wristful of diamonds and
yellow-blond hair _ when she walked into the Four Seasons for lunch
last week it was as if the sun had risen twice that day _ is at her
Vesuvian best when surrounded by stars. She comes alive at the idea
of having all of them in her front row, wearing her clothes,
looking up at her clothes, and, yes, being in the papers the next
morning photographed at her show.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, at the moment in New York, where the spring collections are
under way, there is hardly a young designer who would dream of
stocking his or her show with celebrities, like a trout farm in the
Catskills. It's bogus, it's bush league, but mainly it's just old.
Which is funny, because Ms. Versace, despite her diamonds, likes to
think of herself as young.
</P>
<P>
   The show started with a clang of electric guitars from a live
band on the stage. Then the first model appeared, wearing a white
cotton mesh top and a white denim skirt that looked as if it had
been taken apart and sewn back together sideways.
</P>
<P>
   She was followed by models in tight cotton eyelet pants,
miniskirts with cutie-pie tops in the Lolita genre, and
screen-printed T-shirts that had been slashed open in the back _
the way a teen-age girl will do after she's tossed ``Silas Marner''
under the bed and started hacking away at her old Pearl Jam shirt
with cuticle scissors until it resembles a tank top.
</P>
<P>
   There were flashes of kinky brilliance, like Kate Moss in a
frilly coral top and white hot pants that twinkled up the front and
rear with gold spangles. A tiny triangular white top punched with
grommets looked as if the model had collided with a wet Kleenex and
kept moving.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even with all those celebrities to give the show the
atmosphere of cool importance, it is no joke to say the clothes
looked as if they had been designed by a lecherous old groupie on a
break from a Grateful Dead tour.
</P>
<P>
   All this, by contrast, must make Susan Cianciolo, who served
frosted animal cookies at her show Sunday and displayed her
handmade clothes on racks that resembled wooden clothes dryers,
seem like the biggest flake of the week. And outwardly, at least,
Ms. Cianciolo's clothes suggest that she and her artist friends _
among them, Laura Genninger and Tammy Tiranasar, who use nailheads
and dowels to print random polka dots on cotton _ got together one
weekend and, in the spirit of Scarlett O'Hara, made some clothes.
</P>
<P>
   But consider: In the past couple of seasons, as Ms. Cianciolo
has gained a kind of cult following, her ideas, particularly her
naive-looking screened prints and deconstructed T-shirts, have been
widely copied. Clothes frayed or destroyed in the
loving-hands-at-home manner are not a new notion; one has only to
think of Rei Kawakubo of Comme des Garcons and Vivienne Westwood in
her early anarchic years.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Cianciolo is giving the idea fresh currency, and is it
any coincidence that the runways this week are already filled with
torn T-shirts and dangling gossamer threads, as if spun from her
strange cocoon?
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cianciolo's inspiration was animals _ hence the childish
fare. Plain-Jane dresses were stitched with crouching cats, while
other shifts and circle skirts were adorned with a menagerie of
detachable animals _ quilted giraffes and dogs of the sort you
would find at a small-town church bazaar. The prints were
ingenious, too, especially a red nailhead print on a white cotton
blouse that had been gathered eccentrically to one side. The
printmaker, Ms. Cianciolo said, called it ``polka dance.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Standing around her husband's art gallery in Chelsea, where the
show was held, Ms. Cianciolo said she liked the novelty of using
plain wooden racks. Models, she seemed to imply, give her a
headache. ``We were trying to present the idea that if you love
clothes, you can hang them around your room on these stands,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You mean like a Stairmaster?'' someone asked.
</P>
<P>
   The designer smiled. ``That never came into my mind,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In a double bill on Sunday, Cesar Galindo and David Rodriguez
presented their collections together. Galindo sent out fancy ball
skirts and simple black crepe outfits quivering with jet beads, but
without much bravura. Rodriguez, on the other hand, showed his
cutting skills and eye for color. There were white leather hot
pants with a vivid brocade top, and a white shift printed with
graphic black circles and shown with thigh-high red stretch boots.
</P>
<P>
   The models _ bewigged, Pan-Caked and wearing what looked like
little waffles of Rice Chex over their eyes _ were the equivalent
of dummies. Wild.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere Sunday, Mark Kroeker played with texture and arty
shapes, like frayed edges and a cream hand-knit top tied in back
with yarn strings. The models, carrying clutches that might have
held a flute or a very long cigarette holder, were drenched in
lotion and glitter, while their hair lifted upward from underneath,
like Dorothy's house in Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   Of the three young design teams presented by Moet &AMP; Chandon, the
Champagne maker, the Wrights _ not brothers, but two sisters,
Angela and Sharon _ showed promise with their minimalist shifts and
asymmetrical suede skirts enlivened with girlish eyelet cutouts.
Equally promising: Gregory Parkinson, who has quietly cultivated a
following, with retailers like Linda Dresner.
</P>
<P>
   Parkinson used denim, cut and pieced together in bias stripes,
and mixed it with simple tops of crinkled silk or homey jersey.
Colors were clear as a cocktail, and the upshot was a refined
collection by a designer whose eye is slightly but delightfully
off.
</P>
<P>
   Outside Diane Von Furstenberg's studio in Manhattan, Fran
Lebowitz, the writer, was lounging on a sofa that someone had put
near the entrance. Drinks were being served, and it was the kind of
scene one finds only in New York on a Sunday night when there is
nothing better to do. Inside, Ms. Von Furstenberg was showing
people around her tableaux vivants.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the Plant,'' she said, stopping before some models in
green and lavender print jersey dresses. Ms. Von Furstenberg
shrugged. ``It's about the plant.'' She then led the way through
the crowd to displays inspired by the Bird and the Earth, each with
sexy variations on wrap dresses and fluted, ruffled skirts.
Afterward, she introduced a man she called Romeo, a healer, who
handed out beads, which, he said, would ward off aggravating
people.
</P>
<P>
   So the week has begun _ and without a Romeo too soon. On Monday,
Han Feng, in a collection she called ``Reborn,'' presented simple,
beautiful clothes: silk capri pants inset with tiny crocheted
details, loose tops shrugging off the shoulders, trousers and
skirts wrapped obi-style, all made sexy with livid poppy and
panther pink. Susan Sarandon, the actress, was in the audience,
but, really, who noticed?

FIVE MORE CHARGED IN UCLA PARKING SCAM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Former UCLA quarterback Cade McNown was among five
current and former football players charged Monday by the L.A. city
attorney's office for their participation in the disabled-parking
scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Former players McNown, tailback Skip Hicks, safety Larry Atkins,
linebacker Brendon Ayanbadejo and current safety Eric Whitfield
will be arraigned this morning in municipal court. They face two
misdemeanor charges: illegal possession of a handicapped-parking
permit and providing false information to the Department of Motor
Vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   McNown, who has denied any wrongdoing, is playing for the
Chicago Bears. Atkins plays for the Kansas City Chiefs and Hicks
plays for the Washington Redskins. Ayanbadejo was cut by the
Atlanta Falcons. None of the four could be reached for comment.
However, Hicks had spoken of the situation at the start of training
camp in July.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was young. You do some things you regret when you're young.
Yes, I had one. I never parked in a handicapped spot, but I guess
that doesn't matter. I shouldn't have had one in the first place,''
he said. ``. . .It's one of those things where you've got to say
I'm sorry, learn from your mistakes and move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitfield, a senior from Carson, was 1 of 11 current players
(seven starters) suspended by UCLA for two games for their part in
the scandal. They will play Saturday against Fresno State.
</P>
<P>
   Senior tailback Keith Brown, also suspended for two games by the
school, was not charged by city attorney Jim Hahn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thery're still thinking my case over,'' said Brown. ``I have
to write a letter to the city attorney and explain my situation.
Then they'll decide.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown said he used the parking placard after having shoulder
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Hahn has now charged 19 current and former Bruins for their part
in the parking scam. Nine of the original 14 received two years'
probation, a $1,485 fine and 200 hours of community service _ 100
hours with the Special Olympics and 100 hours at one of four
organizations that assist people with disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   The nine are linebacker Ali Abdul Azziz, linebacker Robert
Thomas, linebacker Tony White, linebacker Ryan Nece, guard Oscar
Cabrera, safety Ryan Roques, cornerback Marques Anderson and former
players Damian Allen and Deatra Clinton
</P>
<P>
   Anderson was suspended from school for the fall quarter because
of the parking scandal and a previous offense with the dean of
student's office. He will re-enroll in January and return to the
team.
</P>
<P>
   Five players charged July 8 have received two continuances and
will be arraigned this morning at municipal court. They are
fullback Durell Price, guard Jim Ghezzi and three former players:
Mark Reynosa, DuVal Hicks and Craig Walendy.
</P>
<P>
   According to the city attorney's office, all 19 defendants have
been accused of submitting bogus injury information to the DMV in
order to obtain the handicapped placards. In addition, 17 have been
accused of using the signatures of nonexistent doctors.
</P>
<P>
   McNown and Whitfield allegedly used the name of an existing
physician on their applications. However, she told investigators
she had not signed the applications and had no record of having
either player as a patient.

THE PERFECT BIRTHDAY GIFT: BIDDING STARTS AT $500,000 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By ALAN FEUER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The necklace that graced the throat of a princess has
passed through Buckingham Palace, the vault of the jeweler to the
British Crown and the hands of a wealthy but modest couple who live
quietly in the English countryside.
</P>
<P>
   But this elegant piece with diamonds and pearls, once worn by
Diana, Princess of Wales, is heading for the place where so much
that has been touched by cult adoration seems to end up these days:
the auction block.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 16, the necklace and a pair of matching earrings, known
together as the Swan Lake Suite, will be auctioned at the Park
Avenue Armory by Guernsey's, the Manhattan auction house that got
more than $3 million for the baseball Mark McGwire hit for his 70th
home run last year. The organizers have set $500,000 as a minimum
starting price.
</P>
<P>
   The necklace has 164 marquise- and brilliant-cut diamonds and
five strikingly large South Sea pearls, but for some, it has added
sentimental value because Diana wore it on her last official public
appearance.
</P>
<P>
   The necklace was created in 1997 in the London workshop of
Asprey &AMP; Garrard, jewelers to members of the royal family since
1843. It was worn by Diana only once _ on June 3, 1997, at a gala
performance of ``Swan Lake'' at the Royal Albert Hall just weeks
before her fatal crash.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of her death, Diana had not yet bought the necklace
and Asprey &AMP; Garrard reclaimed it, placing it back in the showcase
for sale, said Tania Foster-Brown, a company spokeswoman. In the
meantime, the jewelers had made the matching earrings, and on the
day the necklace was returned, a valued customer was in the shop to
pick up a bracelet that was being repaired, and he bought the Swan
Lake Suite on the spot as a birthday present for his wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really was a remarkable coincidence,'' said the buyer, 42,
who recently retired from his job as a managing director in the
London office of Lehman Brothers, the investment bank. He wrote a
check for ``a considerable sum of money'' _ he would not be
specific _ and walked out the door with the necklace and earrings.
Asprey &AMP; Garrard even threw in the bracelet repairs for free.
</P>
<P>
   Moments after leaving the shop, the buyer called his wife and
told her about the present. ``I said something like, `Look, dear,
I've just bought you something, but I've gone a little
overboard,''' he said. ``When she asked me what it was, I told her
that she had better sit down.''
</P>
<P>
   How should a woman feel when presented with a glimmering arc of
diamonds with a drooping fringe of pearls the size of lemon drops?
Thrilled? Flattered? Overwhelmed? The buyer, who asked that his
name not be used, said his wife was all of those at once.
</P>
<P>
   But she was also uncomfortable, he said _ uncomfortable enough
to give up the jewelry. Although the couple live part time in
London, they spend much of the year in a quiet English hill town
where there is little occasion to wear a necklace last worn by the
Princess of Wales.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had the necklace, but we really weren't doing much with
it,'' the buyer admitted. ``My wife wore it occasionally, but very
privately, just for us or a couple of friends. We're just not in
that circuit where it makes sense to be wearing a major, major
piece. We're not using it, so it would be better if someone else
enjoyed it.''
</P>
<P>
   The auction seemed like the perfect way to dispose of the
jewels, he said, adding that a portion of the proceeds will go to
Unicef.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife's a bit sorry to lose it,'' he added. ``But we're very
conservative English people. We actually feel good about this
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Arlan Ettinger, Guernsey's owner, said the Swan Lake Suite was
the ``gift of the century.''
</P>
<P>
   With a touch of nostalgia, the anonymous buyer-turned-seller
said: ``In the beginning, I bought the thing and we were delighted.
Then, in the middle, we realized we just didn't need it. Now
there's a chance to do something good with it. I guess I just want
a happy ending.''

ON BASEBALL: BOTH YANKEES AND METS COULD MISS THE PLAYOFFS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For anyone ready for devilish developments in the
remainder of the baseball season, how about this scenario:
</P>
<P>
   The Mets make the playoffs, but the Yankees don't. The Yankees,
only a year ago the greatest team since Rodgers and Hammerstein,
are the victims of the Revenge of the Red Sox, an overachieving,
unexpectedly solid team getting even 21 years later for their 1978
ancestors.
</P>
<P>
   But the Yankees suffer a double-barreled blow. Not only do the
Red Sox stunningly snatch the American League East championship out
of their expectant hands, but the $22 million Oakland Athletics,
striking a blow for small-revenue teams, edge the $86 million
Yankees for the wild-card spot.
</P>
<P>
   Someone said the football season began Sunday, but in this
educated view, it's only a rumor. As long as the Mets and the
Yankees are sprinting or staggering toward the post-season,
baseball is the only game in town. Well, figuratively speaking it
is. In reality, there is no game in town Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Is that possible? The Mets are on the brink of their first
post-season games since 1988, the Yankees are suddenly reeling with
a touch of mortality they never experienced last season and neither
team played a home game Monday night and won't play one the next
three days and three nights. Is this any way to make a schedule?
</P>
<P>
   The Mets are in Colorado, the Yankees are in Toronto. Television
and radio will have to suffice. But unexpectedly, the New York area
baseball fan, not the Mets fanatic nor the Yankees zealot, is in a
quandary. No longer are the Mets the only team whose October
schedule is in question, thus making their games mandatory.
Attention must now be paid to the Yankees as well.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of being able to attend one game and listen to the
other, the real fan has to watch one on television and listen to
the other, or, if the appropriate instrument is available, watch
one on the larger part of the screen and the other on
picture-in-a-picture. However it's done, both are required watching
or listening.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets continue to show that they are not the team that
stumbled along the way to the playoffs last year, losing too many
games to weak teams and finishing the season with five consecutive
losses. Their four-game series in Los Angeles made the point.
</P>
<P>
   In the first week of August, the Dodgers came to New York and
bruised the Mets by beating them three times in four games.
Considering the clumps of games the Mets had won before that series
and proceeded to win after it, they seemed to be in no danger of
succumbing to the affliction that undermined them last season,
losing to bad teams.
</P>
<P>
   As if to emphasize that point, though, the Mets repaid the favor
last weekend, dumping the Dodgers three times in four games on
their grass. In that brief span, the Mets also lopped a game and a
half off their deficit with Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the Red Sox were sweeping a three-game series
at Yankee Stadium, and what a revolting development that was for
George Steinbrenner's stomach.
</P>
<P>
   Looking for signs of the significance of that remarkable result?
In 1978, the Yankees and the Red Sox played a four-game series at
Fenway Park Sept. 7-10. Now it's coming back? Yes, the Boston
Massacre. The Yankees, four games behind Boston when they arrived,
won all four games and left tied with the Red Sox for first after
142 games.
</P>
<P>
   This season the teams played their series Sept. 10-12. In each
instance, when the series had ended, the Yankees had played 142
games. Their record then was 86-56, now 85-57.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox were too far behind to pull even with the Yankees at
Yankee Stadium, but their sweep sent shock waves through the
Yankees' organization nonetheless. Wake-up call, as David Cone
called it? It was more like substituting a box of TNT for an alarm
clock.
</P>
<P>
   Should the Yankees continue stumbling, should the Red Sox
continue gaining, should the Mets close in on their playoff spot,
Steinbrenner would very likely set off his own explosion. He has
from time to time this season, in an uncharacteristic low-key way,
warned his troops that they weren't playing up to the standards he
expected.
</P>
<P>
   When the month began, the Yankees thought they would spend the
final month playing for home-field advantage in the first two
series of the playoffs. Later this week they go to Cleveland for a
four-game series in which the Indians, the current home-field
advantage leaders, will try to determine that distinction beyond
question. If the Indians succeed in that quest, it will mean the
Yankees' hold on first place could be further weakened.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets, meanwhile, will continue their dual quest: catch the
Braves in the division race and stay ahead of the Cincinnati Reds
in the wild-card chase. They can accomplish both by continuing to
win, of course. Actually, they have no other choice considering the
way the other contenders have been playing.
</P>
<P>
   Ninety-five or 96 victories may not be enough to make the
playoffs. Never have three teams in one league won 100 games in the
same season, but that development is not beyond the realm of
possibility.
</P>
<P>
   With 18 games left when they began play in Colorado Monday
night, if the Mets matched their .611 winning percentage, they
would win 99 games. That would be enough. And if the Mets made it
and the Yankees didn't, that would be enough to ignite Mount St.
Steinbrenner. The lava would flow all winter long. &QL;

PONCIANO CONTINUES BATTLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   McPHERSON, Kan. _ Those intense eyes seem to burn a hole through
the interviewer a second after he hears the question, ``Are you
starting over?''
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you think?'' he answers.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, Ron Ponciano, former head coach at Cal State
Northridge and Big Sky Conference Coach of the Year in 1998, left
for Seguin, Texas, where the McPherson Bulldogs opened their season
Saturday against Texas Lutheran.
</P>
<P>
   That night, a few hundred people watched McPherson beat Texas
Lutheran 34-13. About 33,000 saw Kansas hand CSUN its second-worst
loss in school history, 71-14.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen years after he became a graduate assistant at Azusa
Pacific, it begins again for Ponciano, at a school with an
enrollment of 400 in a small town in the center of Kansas. This is
a place where residents sit on front porches in the early evenings
and wave as neighbors drive past.
</P>
<P>
   Ponciano didn't come to McPherson College as the team's new
defensive coordinator to forget what happened last summer, when he
was investigated and then fired in mid-July for what the university
believes were serious violations of school policy and NCAA rules.
</P>
<P>
   He slept very little in his first three weeks at McPherson,
because after he finished his coaching duties he would go to the
small house he's renting near campus and meticulously go through
CSUN's 130-page report that described Ponciano as a liar and an
employee with no regard for authority.
</P>
<P>
   Night after night, he re-lived the accusations and conclusions,
which he maintains are false.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get real down at night,'' said Ponciano. ``I think about
what position my family is in now. It's tearing me up. To look at
me, where I am now, is very depressing. Depression is a horrible
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Ponciano, 40, no longer reads the report. Last Friday, he
finished his answer to the report, which he is sending to his Santa
Barbara-based lawyer, Scott Campbell, who is expected to file
Ponciano's civil lawsuit within the next three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``School (officials) think they're going to slip away,''
Ponciano said. ``They messed with my family. My son (3-year-old
Chad) has been saying, `Where is my white house? Where is my pool?'
They turned our world upside down.''
</P>
<P>
   Ponciano retreated to coaching, his profession for almost half
his life. Even though the players he teaches now are small and slow
by comparison, Ponciano holds them to the same standards as he did
the Matadors.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Kazor, a former assistant coach with the Chicago Bears who
is in his second season as the head coach at McPherson, said he's
happy with Ponciano's performance, calling him ``a breath of fresh
air.''
</P>
<P>
   ``(Ponciano's) come in and generated excitement with the
defense,'' Kazor said. ``We will be better defensively in his
presence.''
</P>
<P>
   Ponciano almost didn't get the chance to make it to the season
opener. A few days after he arrived, McPherson athletic director
Dan Hoffman received newspaper articles in the mail _ sent
anonymously _ about Ponciano's firing. Hoffman spent two hours in
the university president's office, explaining why Ponciano deserved
a chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly had some concerns,'' Hoffman said. ``In our
society, we are presumed guilty until proven innocent. I thought we
were fortunate to have him here.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   __The rebuttal __
</P>
<P>
   Ponciano couldn't wait for his suit to be filed to express his
opinion about several issues, including why he thinks he was fired
and the handling of the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   __ Regarding his termination, Ponciano thinks he was a
high-ranking pawn in a university plan to concentrate on other
sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clear to me there were ulterior motives,'' he said.
``They are going to have a hard time saying I was disobedient, that
I ignored rules. We're dealing with bigger issues. (They fired me)
to de-emphasize football.''
</P>
<P>
   __ The $3,000 worth of expense receipts he was accused of
fabricating as an assistant coach in 1996? Ponciano said he only
was doing what he was instructed. He also attacked the report's
conclusion that he taught assistant coach Rob Phenicie his system
of falsifying receipts.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the possible lawsuit, Ponciano didn't name the people
he said told him to turn in the false receipts. But he said he has
kept the paperwork.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have the memos,'' he said. ``They don't think I kept them,
but I did.''
</P>
<P>
   Phenicie, who resigned for personal reasons in the middle of the
investigation, was an assistant at Valley College in '96. He came
to CSUN in '97, when Ponciano left to take the defensive
coordinator's job at San Jose State.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't tell you what Rob Phenicie looked like in '97,''
Ponciano said. ``I never met him.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Ponciano's relationship with former assistant Jeff Kearin has
cooled. Kearin, who talked openly last December about someday
coming back to Northridge as the team's head coach, accepted the
head coaching job on an interim basis a week after Ponciano was
fired.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know who my friends are right now,'' Ponciano said.
``I'm surely not perfect, but people do funny things when they see
an opportunity. To this date, Jeff Kearin has never called me. It
wouldn't go well.''
</P>
<P>
   Kearin maintains he was never disloyal to Ponciano. He said he
hasn't called Ponciano because of the awkward situation.
</P>
<P>
   __ Contrary to interim university President Louanne Kennedy's
belief, Ponciano said he never tried to fire assistant coaches
Craig Wall and Keith Borges when he thought they were providing
incriminating information against him.
</P>
<P>
   He produced memos he sent to Borges and Wall, which were
approved by Sam Jankovich, the interim athletic director at the
time, that didn't contain any language about termination, just a
list of the pair's deficiencies in their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   __ Ponciano also pointed out several other passages in the
report which he called ``ridiculous.'' He says he was honest in his
interviews with internal auditor Peter Dinauer, but when he
requested the notes from those interviews several times, he was
denied.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to be pro-active,'' he said. ``The things I did wrong,
I admitted. I'm looking at this (report), and I can't believe what
I'm reading.''
</P>
<P>
   Later he said, ``Someone meant to get me out and they did.
Things are fabricated and there are flat-out lies.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   __ Heartache in the heartland __
</P>
<P>
   McPherson has a local newspaper that publishes a daily police
log. Last week there was an entry about a resident being visited by
officers because his dog was barking too loud.
</P>
<P>
   When Ponciano drives his pickup truck around town, his thoughts
drift back to his childhood in Willows, a dot on the map in the
upper San Joaquin Valley. But his recent memory works just as well.
He reads about the Matadors on the Internet and wonders how the
players are performing in practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I miss those rascals, big time,'' he said. ``There's so many
things I miss throughout the day. I hope they win the Big Sky
championship. I may be in Kansas, but my football team is in the
San Fernando Valley. I believe in those kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, Ponciano is making an impact at McPherson, an NAIA
school that hasn't had a winning season in decades. After a 15-hour
bus ride, the Bulldogs didn't give up a touchdown until the fourth
quarter, when the game was already decided. With the same core of
defensive players last year, Texas Lutheran beat McPherson 50-38.
</P>
<P>
   It was a sweet victory for Ponciano, who is just now coming out
of the darkest time in his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``The toughest thing is learning the kids' names,'' Ponciano
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ A cloak of fear descended on Russia's capital Monday as
the second major explosion in four days demolished an apartment
building, killing at least 76 people as they slept.
</P>
<P>
   While no group claimed responsibility for the 5 a.m. blast,
Russian authorities insisted it was the work of Islamic militants
who had taken their war in the Caucasus to Russia's capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``Terrorism has declared war on the Russian people,'' President
Boris Yeltsin said in a nationally televised address.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to reassure anxious residents, Yeltsin ordered tightened
security at airports, nuclear power stations and other possible
targets.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities vowed to check each of Moscow's 33,000 apartment
buildings, especially the storerooms and shops that are often
located on ground floors and in basements.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Yuri Luzhkov announced that all visitors to Moscow would
have to submit to questioning and obtain new residency permits
within the next three days, a decree widely interpreted as directed
against people from the Caucasus, who are often treated with
suspicion by the authorities here.
</P>
<P>
   These measures, however, provided little comfort to the many
Muscovites who live in unguarded and poorly constructed flats _ and
who doubt the government's ability to protect them. Their sense of
vulnerability has mounted in the past month since fighting broke
out in the southern Russian republic of Dagestan, when thousands of
Islamic militants moved from Chechnya into Dagestan and vowed to
turn the Russian republic into an Islamic state.
</P>
<P>
   Natalya S. Saley, a psychotherapist who was counseling residents
near the blast site Monday, said Muscovites feel a new sense of
vulnerability.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people,'' Ms. Saley said, ``are simply afraid to go
back home.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday morning's explosion was an especially rude shock because
Moscow had been largely exempt from terrorism. Russians face many
hardships, but this is still a city in which random violence
against defenseless citizens had been rare. Then a mysterious blast
occurred late last month at the up-scale Manezh shopping center
near the Kremlin, killing one person and injuring about 40 more. It
was followed by an enormous explosion on Thursday, which leveled an
apartment complex in southern Moscow and killed 94.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, in fact, was supposed to have been a somber day of
mourning for the victims of the Thursday bombing _ and for 64
people killed at yet another blast earlier this month at an
apartment complex in Dagestan for Russian officers in their
families.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Muscovites awoke to wailing sirens and feverish rumors
about who might have been responsible for the blast and why.
</P>
<P>
   Vyacheslav Izmailov, an expert on Chechnya for the newspaper
Novaya Gazeta and a retired military officer, stoked the public's
anxiety by declaring that an informant had had alerted him that
Moscow would be the target of more terrorist attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The bombings, he said, had been organized by Islamic militants
and set by a band of Chechen, Russian and Ukrainian mercenaries.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after Monday's bombing, authorities circulated the drawing
of a suspect with a Chechen sounding name _ Mukhit Laipanov _ who
they said had rented stores in the buildings blown up Monday and in
the one destroyed last week.
</P>
<P>
   But there also reports that this was the name of a man who had
died years ago and that the renter had used a phony internal
passport to disguise his identify.
</P>
<P>
   Late Monday night, Luzhkov, the mayor, said that two suspects
had been detained. It was unclear, however, whether they were
merely local Caucasians who had been rounded up or whether the
announcement represented a major break in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Shamil Basayev, the Chechen warlord who is leading the rebel
offensive in Dagestan, insisted that he was not involved in the
blasts, spawning a new set of conspiracy theories.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The building bombed Monday was located along Kashirskoye Shosse,
one of the main thoroughfares leading out of southern eastern
Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 150 people are believed to have lived in the
structure, which was adjacent to a public school and a
kindergarten. Erected in 1958, the apartment block was made out of
brick.
</P>
<P>
   Shoddier than the pre-fabricated apartment house that was blown
up Thursday, the building had collapsed into a mound of cement,
metal and dust. Rescuers said the two dozen or so people that
survived appeared to have lived on the upper floors and ended up on
top of the heap.
</P>
<P>
   ``This explosion is a carbon copy of the previous one, with one
little difference,'' said Vadim Seryogin, the chief of the Central
Search and Rescue Service. ``There it was reinforced concrete. Here
it is brick.''
</P>
<P>
   Huge metal cranes hauled away the debris as a cold rain fell. A
few possessions _ books, a small icon _ were placed on a blanket in
a sea of mud.
</P>
<P>
   As with most tragedies, luck played a role. Mikhail Kuznetsov
and his family had stayed an extra day at their country cottage.
They learned their apartment house had been destroyed as they were
listening to the radio on their drive home.
</P>
<P>
   The Chechurin family was less fortunate. They had been at home
in their beds. One child survived but lost a leg. His siblings were
missing and his parents were reported to be among the dead.
</P>
<P>
   When the blast occurred teachers rushed to the school to try to
comfort the students. The children were quickly transferred to a
safer location and the school turned into an emergency headquarters
for police, soldiers, fireman and bomb-sniffing dogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have the feeling that we are living in a war zone,'' said
Valentina I. Petrova, a mathematics teacher at the school. ``The
only difference is that in Dagestan people know that there is a war
going on in their republic while for us this came like a bolt from
the blue.''
</P>
<P>
   Relatives prowled the corridors of the school, desperate for
information about family members who had lived in the building.
</P>
<P>
   Natalya Ivanov, who was looking for information about her niece,
complained that Russia's enemies had taken advantage of the end of
totalitarian controls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Democracy is to blame,'' Ms. Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
   Allocating blame appeared to be especially important for
Russia's politicians. Yevgeni Primakov, the former prime minister
and a potential candidate to succeed Yeltsin, complained that the
Yeltsin government was ``completely unprepared'' to deal with the
threat of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Luzhkov, a political ally of Primakov, cautioned Yeltsin against
using the bombing as an excuse to declare a state of emergency and
delay elections.
</P>
<P>
   Less partisan voices observed that law enforcement authorities
had contributed to Russia's vulnerability to terrorism by
repeatedly assuring Muscovites that security forces had the
situation in the capital under control. The aim of such statements
had been to avoid panic but instead they had made many citizens
less vigilant than they should be, Izmailov said.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, the authorities reversed that stance by appealing
to the public for help. Russians, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin
said, must maintain special vigilance and ``take a careful look at
what is happening around them.''
</P>
<P>
   Others reasoned philosophically that Russia, like other Western
countries, had finally been touched by the scourge of terrorism and
would have to prepare for a long fight.
</P>
<P>
   Mikhail Zadornov, a former finance minister, warned Monday night
that Russians should gird themselves for even more bombings, much
as the British had to contend with terrorism over Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have to live with it _ not for one year but for
10 or maybe 20,'' Zadornov said.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Amy Wesson was experiencing the kind of inconvenience
that doesn't typically befall those who look like Uma Thurman and
who, in the course of their short lives, have earned as much as
$25,000 a day standing in front of a Hasselblad.
</P>
<P>
   She was late for a meeting with Michael Kors, who was
considering her for his show Wednesday, and there were no cabs in
sight. But what concerned her more was the danger of missing her
two-and-a-half-hour daily session with a private trainer. ``I
really want to work out tonight,'' she said again and again. ``I'm
very annoyed.''
</P>
<P>
   That might seem like misplaced frustration for someone trying to
restart a modeling career this Fashion Week, nearly a year after
she began battling a drug problem.
</P>
<P>
   Last October in Milan, Italy, Ms. Wesson was convulsing while
walking the catwalk for Fendi before the eyes of the world's
fashion insiders, reigniting rumors about a serious drug habit. Her
manager, Marilyn Gaultier, withdrew her from modeling afterward and
insisted she seek treatment. ``I really thought I had things in
control,'' Ms. Wesson said last week. ``I was a mess, and everyone
knew it.''
</P>
<P>
   As she attempts a comeback, she discussed for the first time the
cocaine addiction she once denied. Other models, like Kate Moss and
James King, have talked openly in the news media about their
struggles with substance abuse and recovery in the last year, and
the prevalence of drugs in the fashion world. Ms. King's return to
modeling has been a success; she graced Cosmopolitan's August cover
and is shooting a film, ``Happy Campers.'' In 1997, she lost her
boyfriend, Davide Sorrenti, a fashion photographer, to a heroin
overdose, which led the president to denounce fashion for
glamorizing a ``heroin chic'' look.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wesson's problems peaked at about the same time. Two years
ago, her former agency, Company Management, sued her for breach of
contract, charging that drugs had left her unable to fulfill her
professional commitments. And her commitments were enviable. She
came to prominence in advertising campaigns for Versace, Valentino
and BCBG. After Company dropped her, Ms. Gaultier took her on,
despite the drug issue. ``I thought she was beautiful,'' she said.
``I didn't think at that moment it was such a big problem.''
</P>
<P>
   But after the Fendi debacle, Ms. Gaultier insisted that Ms.
Wesson get treatment. Ms. Wesson went home to Tupelo, Miss., where
she'd been discovered at a mall six years earlier. In January, she
entered the first of two rehabilitation centers in the Southwest,
and spent two months.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wesson moved to New York on her own as a teen-ager and said
she first tried cocaine when a friend gave her some in a bar. ``The
first time, I didn't like it,'' she said. ``I tried it again. It's
something that just stuck with me. It numbed.''
</P>
<P>
   She developed a daily habit. ``There was never a time I didn't
have it on me,'' she said. ``I'd think, It's 6 o'clock, time to go
home and do a line.'' She tried unsuccessfully to straighten out on
her own.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if I got clean for a week, I was still so depressed,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wesson said no one in the industry confronted her about her
problem before Ms. Gaultier. But Michael Flutie, the president of
Company Management, said he tried to get her to alter her ways on a
number of occasions. ``Amy was in denial about her problem,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Flutie called together 60 models' agents, photographers
and ad agency representatives to discuss ways of combating drug use
in fashion. Have matters improved? Paolo Zampolli, the president of
ID Model Management, said he believed the problem had been
``drastically reduced.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past two years, we've only had one girl with a
problem,'' he said. ``My position was to get rid, immediately, of
the girl.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Ms. Wesson, she is finding the modeling business no less
demanding. Ms. Gaultier admits to being ``scared'' about the size
of her client's hips (which to the average person, but not to an
agent, appear no wider than a ribbon). She did not get the Michael
Kors job, but she will walk for Daryl K Tuesday and Helmut Lang on
Thursday, when she turns 22. &QL;

TONY DUQUETTE, 85, A DECORATOR OF FANTASY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JULIE V. IOVINE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tony Duquette, the designer whose lavish, whimsically baroque
sets and costumes, interiors and jewelry made him a Hollywood
favorite for more than five decades, died on Sept. 9. He was 85.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of his death, at the University of California at Los
Angeles Medical Center, was complications from a heart attack, said
Hutton Wilkinson, his business partner of 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Exotic excess was the signature of the Tony Duquette style. ``He
was the only man who could spend $999 in a 99-cent store,''
Wilkinson said.
</P>
<P>
   Part sly conjurer, part satin-robed aesthete, Duquette was
concerned with the dazzling effect of his designs, often using
unabashedly cheap materials.
</P>
<P>
   At his Hollywood Hills studio, a roomful of 18th-century French
antiques sat amid gilded trees beneath a ceiling studded with
glued-on gold plastic serving trays. His talent for overdoing it
was appreciated by clients who had acquired their own sense of the
grandiose, among them Vincente Minnelli, Doris Duke, Mary Pickford,
J. Paul Getty, David O. Selznick and the duchess of Windsor.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was doing fantasy from the moment he began, and remained
committed to his vision no matter what the fashion of the day
dictated,'' said Liz O'Brien, a New York dealer in 20th-century
decorative arts.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Michael Duquette (the name is pronounced due-KETT) was
born in Los Angeles on June 11, 1914. The oldest of four children,
Duquette ``always just was what he was _ artistic, driven,'' said
his sister, Jeanne Newman. When he was 12, he entertained his
siblings with a puppet show of ``Scheherazade,'' making all the
costumes himself. The toy houses he built were romantically lighted
with birthday candles.
</P>
<P>
   After high school, he attended the Chouinard Art Institute in
Los Angeles on a scholarship. His first job was as a designer at
Bullock's department store. As a freelancer, he also worked for the
Hollywood designers Billy Haines and James Pendleton.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II, he served as a private in the U.S. Army. In
1949, he married Elizabeth Johnstone, an artist and eager
contributor to the Duquette vision. He called her Beegle, and the
nickname stuck.
</P>
<P>
   Duquette liked to say that he was discovered by Lady Mendl (who
had become famous as an interior decorator as Elsie de Wolfe) when,
in her 80s, she decamped from her villa in France to a villa in Los
Angeles to avoid the war.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want you to make me a meuble,'' Lady Mendl commanded,
putting the word ``furniture'' into French, after admiring a
jewel-bedecked plaster and glass centerpiece that Duquette had
designed for a dinner party.
</P>
<P>
   Impressed with the result, a black-lacquered secretary with
Moors set against a mirrored background festooned with Venetian
glass flowers, she began to promote her new discovery to clients,
friends and influential editors.
</P>
<P>
   Their collaboration lasted until her death, in 1951. Duquette
became president of the Elsie de Wolfe Foundation and at the time
of his death he was organizing an auction of the foundation's Elsie
de Wolfe collections, to be held at Christie's in Los Angeles next
week.
</P>
<P>
   It did not take long for Duquette to become established as a
celebrity decorator, furniture and jewelry maker, and set designer.
He furnished a castle for Elizabeth Arden, designed his first piece
of jewelry for the duchess of Windsor and built sets for Vincente
Minnelli's lavish movies ``Ziegfeld Follies of 1944'' and ``Yolanda
and the Thief,'' with Fred Astaire (1945).
</P>
<P>
   He won a Tony award for best costumes for the original 1961
Broadway production of ``Camelot.'' In the late 1940s, he was given
a one-man show at the Pavillon de Marsan in the Louvre.
</P>
<P>
   But his own lavishly theatrical homes were perhaps his most
astonishing creations. The house on his 175-acre Malibu ranch,
named Sortilegium, was an architectural collage of Oriental and
Georgian motifs interlarded with bits of unexpected exotica: a
window from Greta Garbo and John Gilbert's love nest, a Venetian
gondola, and a set of 18th-century doors presented to him and his
wife by Mary Pickford and Buddy Rogers as a wedding present. It was
destroyed by fire in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Another home, Dawnridge, was a villagelike compound with
Balinese pavilions and grand Venetian salons, the whole spiced with
18th-century Chinese window carvings.
</P>
<P>
   Duquette also enjoyed creating what he called celebrational
environments. His most famous installation, dedicated in the 1980s,
was in honor of St. Francis of Assisi, the patron saint of San
Francisco, where Duquette had gained a large following with his
opera sets and decorations for debutante balls.
</P>
<P>
   The Duquette Pavilion of St. Francis consisted of a room crowded
with monumental 28-foot metal sculptures of archangels and giant
jewel-studded tapestries. It, too, was destroyed by fire, in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   His wife died in 1995. In addition to his sister, Ms. Newman of
La Canada, Calif., Duquette is survived by a brother, Frank
Duquette of Palm Springs, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Projects he was working on at the time of his death included
rooms in the Palazzo Brandolini in Venice, Italy, and a jewelry
collection for Gucci.
</P>
<P>
   ``Decorating is not a surface performance,'' Duquette once said,
``It's a spiritual impulse, inborn and primordial.''

4 LEADING SECURITIES FIRMS JOIN FORCES TO BACK PRIMEX 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The four largest securities firms in the United
States have joined forces to back Primex Trading, a novel
electronic auction system for stocks, giving Primex a jump-start in
the static-filled world of electronic trading.
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup's Salomon Smith Barney and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter
Monday said they had joined three earlier backers, Goldman, Sachs &AMP;
Co., Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. and Bernard L. Madoff Investment
Securities, as Primex's partners. Although several other new
electronic trading networks have attracted investments from
multiple banks and securities firms, support from the four leading
Wall Street firms seems likely to secure Primex a substantial flow
of trading orders from the moment it begins, probably next summer.
</P>
<P>
   Primex is aiming to be an electronic version of the New York
Stock Exchange. Participants will not only be able to buy and sell
stocks at prevailing market prices, as they now do through many
traditional and electronic exchanges, but also interact openly with
one another _ in effect, bargain _ to find the best prices
possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the fact four of the world's largest securities firms
have backed this system suggests that it brings something new and
unique to our ability to obtain the best execution for our
customers,'' said Bill Hart, a managing director in equity trading
at Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   Although the major Wall Street firms are key backers of the New
York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq, they have also taken stakes in a
variety of new electronic trading networks that compete with
traditional exchanges. Electronic networks have already stolen some
of the business of matching buy and sell orders for stocks away
from exchanges and the securities firms themselves. Exactly how
electronic trading will eventually effect the marketplace is
uncertain, and nearly all the players seem to be hedging their bets
by investing in multiple alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   Peter B. Madoff, the manager and one of the founders of Primex,
said the system differs from other trading networks in that it is
open and interactive. In other words, it is intended to be a super
exchange, giving users the ability to haggle for the best prices
with other users on any other trading system. The idea is a good
one, some analysts say, but the test will be whether it catches
fire with investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our ability to bring these five parties together is a
significant statement,'' Madoff said. ``They account for a
significant portion of stock trading worldwide, and they share the
same vision to create a new (stock trading) mechanism.''
</P>
<P>
   Madoff said that Primex would welcome participation by the New
York Stock Exchange, which specializes in auction trading the old
fashioned way, by open outcry. But there's little doubt that Primex
will also compete with the stock exchange.
</P>
<P>
   People involved with Primex said that the participating Wall
Street firms are likely to steer many stock transactions through
Primex first. For a small fee, Primex would then shop for the best
prices available on all other participating exchanges, electronic
networks or private broker-dealers. If floor traders on the New
York Stock Exchange turn out to be offering the best price, the
order will end up there, but could otherwise be settled without
ever crossing the exchange floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We having nothing to lose by going to Primex first,'' said an
executive of a securities firm that has invested in Primex and who
declined to be identified by name. ``That's not really the case
with some other electronic networks, because they will not be as
broad.''
</P>
<P>
   The firms involved with Primex declined to disclose details
about the electronic network's ownership structure or the amounts
of money they have invested. But one person involved said the four
big Wall Street firms had equal stakes in the new venture, which
was the brainchild of Peter and Bernard Madoff, two brothers who
have been on the cutting edge of Wall Street stock trading for
years.
</P>
<P>
   Start-up costs for electronic exchanges are not necessarily
formidable. Merrill Lynch last week became the latest securities
firm, after ETrade, Goldman and J.P. Morgan, to buy a stake in
Archipelago, one of the best financed of the new electronic
networks. It paid about $30 million for a 14.3 percent stake,
people close to the firm said.

OTTO A. SILHA, 80, A PUBLISHER OF MINNEAPOLIS NEWSPAPER
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Otto A. Silha, a onetime copy editor and newspaper marketer who
became president and publisher of The Minneapolis Star and Tribune
in the 1970s and after retiring in 1984 underwrote a program in
media ethics at the University of Minnesota, died Sept. 11. He was
80.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was complications following a heart attack, according
to his son, Stephen.
</P>
<P>
   Silha began his journalism career on his college newspaper, The
Minnesota Daily, in 1939. Aside from a four-year stint in the
military during World War II, he spent most of the next 44 years in
journalism working on the business side of the Star and Tribune
Co., where he showed a zest for marketing, according to several
colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   But if the business of newspapers was the first love in his
career, his interest turned to journalistic ethics after his
retirement. Louis D. Boccardi, president and chief executive of The
Associated Press, on whose board Silha served, said, ``He was a guy
from the business side but always had a sense of the larger issues,
the larger purpose in newspapering.''
</P>
<P>
   Silha served with John Cowles Jr. in the top ranks of the Star
and Tribune Co. _ which was renamed the Cowles Media Co. in 1982 _
when the Cowles family name was synonymous with a tough,
no-nonsense journalism in Minnesota and Iowa. Members of the
extended Cowles family owned both the Star and Tribune Co. and the
Des Moines Register Tribune Co.
</P>
<P>
   Silha joined The Minneapolis Star ``right out of the University
of Minnesota _ and, what was very much the tradition those days, he
worked his way up,'' said James A. Alcott, a former vice chairman
of the Cowles Media Co. who was also the author of a company
history. Silha started as a copy editor and soon moved to the
business side.
</P>
<P>
   About the time Silha was named chairman of the company that
owned the newspaper and small magazine and book publishing
divisions, the company bought The Buffalo Courier-Express, a
morning newspaper. The investment proved ill-timed; Cowles Media
closed the paper in 1982, after losing $25 million. Two years
earlier, the company _ then still called the Minneapolis Star and
Tribune Co. _ had sold Harper's Magazine.
</P>
<P>
   After retiring from Cowles, he formed Silha Associates, a
national media and management consulting organization. He also
served as a consultant to the Gannett Co., which was then in the
process of planning its successful purchase of another major Cowles
family holding, the Des Moines Register Tribune Co.
</P>
<P>
   But his major focus in his retirement years was the issue of
journalistic ethics and the needs of the city of Minneapolis. He
donated $2 million to the University of Minnesota to further the
study of media ethics, headed the Minnesota Experimental City
Project and founded City Innovation, a national volunteer program.
</P>
<P>
   David C. Cox, who was president and chief executive of Cowles
Media until it was absorbed into McClatchy Newspapers Inc. in 1998,
said Silha ``was best known for advanced thinking about urban
development.''
</P>
<P>
   Silha is survived by his wife, Helen, of Edina, Minn.; two sons,
Stephen, of Vashon Island, Wash., and Mark, of Minneapolis; a
daughter, Alice Reimann, and three grandchildren.

DDT COMPLICATES DEBATE ON PACT TO BAN PESTICIDES 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA, Switzerland _ Negotiators have hammered out a broad
agreement to ban several toxic chemicals and pesticides, but were
unable to decide the fate of DDT because of its use as a cheap
means to combat malaria. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A week of talks here among 115 nations striving for a treaty on
hazardous substances produced a tentative accord that calls for
production of eight chemicals to stop when the treaty takes
effect. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yet to be determined is how to handle DDT, which has divided
environmentalists and public health specialists because of its
usefulness against malaria.
</P>
<P>
   DDT, which poses health risks to wildlife, particularly birds,
and has been found in the milk of nursing mothers, has been banned
in many industrial countries. But more than two dozen countries
rely on the chemical for use against malaria, which kills 1.1
million people each year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The World Health Organization urged negotiators to weigh DDT's
dangers against its benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The World Wide Fund for Nature, known as World Wildlife Fund in
the United States, countered by issuing a study last week that
concluded that lower-risk pesticides could be equally effective
against malaria. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists have now eased their demand for a firm date
for DDT elimination.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to DDT, negotiators failed to make progress on PCBs,
or polychlorinated biphenyls, which are industrial chemicals used
in electric transformers and plastics and as paint additives.
</P>
<P>
   The treaty is expected to be signed in Stockholm in 2001, after
two more negotiating rounds.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new accord, the pesticides to be eliminated without
exemptions are aldrin, endrin, toxaphene. Five others _ the
pesticides chlordane, dieldrin, heptachlor and mirex and the
industrial byproduct hexachlorobenzene _ were chosen for
elimination with limited exemptions.  &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ You might say that Henry Hale Bliss was done in by
his own chivalry.
</P>
<P>
   As this old story goes, he had stepped off a trolley car at
Central Park West and 74th Street and was turning to help a certain
Miss Lee also get down when he was run over by an automobile. Miss
Lee became hysterical, and for good reason. Bliss' skull and chest
were crushed. A few hours later, he was dead.
</P>
<P>
   Had all this happened in today's New York, Bliss might have
lived. He probably would have kept walking and avoided the auto.
How many men today extend a hand to a woman getting off a bus? For
that matter, how many women welcome the assistance, rather than
telling the guy to keep his bleeping hands to himself?
</P>
<P>
   But Bliss, a 68-year-old realtor, lived in a more chivalrous
day, and his graciousness proved his undoing. It did, however, put
him in the history books, for he is believed to be the first person
in America to be mortally injured by a motor vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   That was on Sept. 13, 1899. Monday, the 100th anniversary of
that awful event, dozens of people flocked to the busy intersection
of 74th and Central Park West _ known as ``Dangerous Stretch'' even
a century ago _ to remember Bliss and to appeal for stricter
enforcement of laws protecting pedestrians.
</P>
<P>
   It was a motley gathering.
</P>
<P>
   There was Harris Silver, founder of a pedestrian safety group
called Citystreets, who said most traffic fatalities were avoidable
if drivers would only be a bit more careful. ``We're not fans of
the word `accident,''' Silver said.
</P>
<P>
   There was Heward Grafftey, a traffic-safety advocate from Canada
who welcomed the crowd in English and French. Must be de rigueur
for a Canadian these days. He raised a few eyebrows by citing
estimates that motor vehicles have killed 30 million people
worldwide since Bliss.
</P>
<P>
   There was Gordon Stewart, president of the Insurance Information
Institute. His trade group's members hate traffic deaths, Stewart
observed, if only because they hate paying life insurance claims.
No one can accuse him of lacking candor.
</P>
<P>
   There was Henry J. Stern, the city parks commissioner, whose
agency prepared a green-and-white sign marking Bliss' untimely end.
Stern came out foursquare against death. Still, he felt impelled to
affirm his belief that ``the automobile has been a blessing to
civilization rather than a curse.''
</P>
<P>
   A knot of people stood off to the side, not part of the formal
ceremony. They were from another New York pedestrian-safety group,
Right of Way, and they held canvas banners carrying the names of
nearly every one of the 1,020 pedestrians and bicyclists who died
in the city from 1994 to 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Analyzing those deaths in a report issued this year, Right of
Way found that, overwhelmingly, drivers were to blame. Most
typically, pedestrians were knocked down while in crosswalks, where
by law they had priority over cars. Interestingly, drunken driving
was a factor in only 4 percent of the cases. Quite simply, said
Charles Komanoff, who directed the study, the main problem is an
excess of ``dangerous and aggressive driving.''
</P>
<P>
   To get back to Bliss, few New Yorkers will be shocked to learn
that he was run over by a taxicab (whose passenger happened to be
the son of a former mayor, Franklin Edson). Equally few will be
startled to hear that the taxi driver, Arthur Smith, claimed he had
to swerve to avoid hitting a truck that was in the way. Plus ca
change and so on, as Grafftey might say.
</P>
<P>
   One big difference between then and now is that Smith was
marched off to the nearest police station house and charged with
homicide. His ultimate fate is not clear. But we do know that when
a driver plows into a pedestrian these days, a typical police
reaction is to advise him to be more careful next time.
</P>
<P>
   It should be noted that all is not gloomy. Police figures show
that pedestrian deaths in the city have been declining, to 193 last
year from 277 in 1997. The 1990 figure was 365.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, perfection is far off, a point accentuated on Monday by
the presence of three great-granddaughters of Henry Bliss. The
women stepped into Central Park West, and put pink and red roses on
the spot where their ancestor is assumed to have been struck.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look both ways,'' a man called out _ an important warning for
anyone in this city and perhaps proof that chivalry is not dead
after all.

<P>
   MIAMI _ A hurricane that meteorologists said was four times the
size of the infamous Andrew and potentially even more destructive
pounded toward Florida Monday, forcing 1 million from their homes
and leaving countless residents to hope that the massive storm
would somehow miss their cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``This hurricane,'' said Jerry Jarrell, director of the National
Hurricane Center, ``could be catastrophic.''
</P>
<P>
   Bearing down on Florida, Hurricane Floyd, with winds of more
than 150 mph, stretched for about 700 miles, twice as long as the
state of Florida. Hurricane-force winds, at least 74 mph, extended
125 miles out from the eye. Hurricane Andrew's hurricane-force
winds extended only 25 or 30 miles.
</P>
<P>
   The Florida coast north of Palm Beach was expected to start
feeling the effects of the storm in time for rush hour on Tuesday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   From as far south as Miami to as far north as Cape Canaveral,
hundreds of thousands of people evacuated the densely populated
Florida coast as the storm crept westward across the Atlantic and
forecasters' radar screens.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Jeb Bush declared a state of emergency late Monday,
mobilizing the National Guard and enhancing coordination among
towns and granting Florida emergency management head Joe Meyers
power over local authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like a giant bullseye out there,'' said Brad Cramer,
a lifeguard on Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   All day Monday, state meteorologists offered hope that Hurricane
Floyd would be nudged from its westerly course by a trough of low
pressure air moving to the east and southeast, and, instead of
making landfall in South Florida, travel up the coast, its
dangerous eye offshore.
</P>
<P>
   But that hope seemed to weaken by early Monday evening as Floyd
plowed west and slightly northwest, in the general direction of
Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the sort of the thing you have nightmares about,''
said Bill O'Brien, director of emergency management in Palm Beach
County.
</P>
<P>
   In a frightening scenario, the hurricane could turn north just
as the most powerful winds surrounding the eye make landfall,
sending the most destructive part of the hurricane along the coast,
meteorologists said.
</P>
<P>
   Like Andrew in 1992, which killed 40 people, left 160,000
homeless and caused more than $25 billion in damages, Floyd was a
Category 4 storm on Monday. It was on the verge of being a Category
5, the most powerful, as of Monday evening, with the power to turn
houses into rubble and splinters if it makes landfall.
</P>
<P>
   But Jarrell warned that even if the hurricane's eye stays as
much as 30 miles off the coast the storm could still rip roofs off
houses and flatten walls. Meteorologists called it a history-making
storm.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Gottschalck, a research associate in Meteorology at the
University of Miami's Rosentiel School of Marine and Atmospheric
Science, called it ``one of the largest and strongest storms'' in
history to hit the U.S. coast.
</P>
<P>
   As night fell on South Florida, shelters and hotel rooms inland,
especially around Palm Beach, began to fill; cruise ships left for
safer waters to the south; long flotillas of pleasure craft snaked
along canals looking for safe harbor, as lines grew at hardware and
grocery stores.
</P>
<P>
   At the Kennedy Space Center, which is just 9 feet above sea
level, almost all of the 12,500 workers were being evacuated. A
skeleton crew remained, but they, too, would leave if the winds
become as fierce as predicted, a spokesman said. That would be the
first complete evacuation of the space center ever.
</P>
<P>
   Three of NASA's space shuttles were in a hangar that was
designed to withstand winds of only up to 105 mph. A fourth was in
a building designed to stand winds of up to 125 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Because it was still too soon to more accurately estimate the
storm's landfall, the entire state of Florida was placed under a
hurricane warning. More than 200,000 people on Florida's
east-central coast were told to evacuate, and another 200,000 were
evacuated from coastal areas of Miami-Dade County.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia was under a hurricane watch and forecasters expected to
extend that watch into South Carolina.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Allen Fiske's boat is his home, and he was worried about losing
it as the storm drew closer. A paraplegic since a car accident 17
years ago, he lives aboard his 35-foot sailboat, ``Minimum
Balance.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what I'm going to do,'' he said. ``I can leave it
here at Dinner Key marina and let it get smashed into the pilings,
or I could take it up the Miami River along with everybody else and
let it get smashed against all the other boats. ``I'm leaning
toward going south, down to Key Largo.'' The Keys, he said, seem to
be the one place in Florida that are out of harm's way.
</P>
<P>
   While a few people said they thought the evacuations were
premature and a sign of media-driven panic, most people took the
threat seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have only been two other category 5 hurricanes to hit
the U.S. _ Camille in the 1960s and an unnamed storm in 1935,''
said Gottschalck. ``This kind of storm needs to be taken
seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Day hurricane of 1935, which hit the Florida Keys,
killed 408 people. Hurricane Camille, which went ashore in
Mississippi and Louisiana in 1969, killed 256.
</P>
<P>
   As far north as Jacksonville, people watched in amazement as the
huge storm swirled across television screens, larger than the state
it was approaching.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, my God,'' said Courtney Edwards, 17, as she saw maps of
the storm on a big-screen television in the electronics department
of a department store in Jacksonville.
</P>
<P>
   Further south, even people who lived miles inland considered
leaving their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did consider driving to Atlanta,'' said Bettye Cox, who
lives in Boca Raton. Instead, she just bought hurricane supplies.
</P>
<P>
   As the storm approached, the weather along the South Florida
beaches as far north as Palm Beach was balmy and breezy _ a perfect
day.
</P>
<P>
   Arturo Penalver, 65, a retired longshoreman from Brooklyn, took
a swim on Palm Beach. ``It's beautiful,'' said Penalver. ``I don't
believe it will come here.''
</P>
<P>
   Edmond Zion, a retired limo driver from Queens County, N.Y.,
also scoffed at the growing concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would think that people down here would be used to these
storms already,'' he said. ``They act like it's all new, like they
never heard of such a thing before.''
</P>
<P>
   But in this case, it may be true. This storm could be something
entirely new.
</P>
<P>
   As if the threat of this hurricane was not enough bad news for
Florida, another potentially dangerous storm, Hurricane Gert, seems
to be taking roughly the same path as Floyd, just a few days
behind.
</P>
<P>
   That storm, which developed into a full-fledged hurricane
Monday, was expected to push through the Leeward Islands, Virgin
Islands and Puerto Rico later this week, and _ if it stays on
course _ eventually threaten Florida or the east coast. Though not
as large as Floyd, Gert, the fifth hurricane of the season, was
expected to pound through the Atlantic with winds well over 100
mph.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Floyd is trouble enough.
</P>
<P>
   On ritzy Worth Avenue in Palm Beach, Susan Bryden and six
friends, visiting from Agawam, Mass., hurried through their
shopping to make an evening flight home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're leaving,'' said Ms. Bryden, as employees pulled shutters
down on the windows of Saks Fifth Avenue and Ralph Lauren, ``and
we're glad of it.''
</P>
<P>
   In Miami, the last cruise ship had lumbered out of the harbor by
6 p.m. Most workers had left downtown early. To the north, in Palm
Beach, workers cleared the last chairs off the beaches.
</P>
<P>
   Cramer, the lifeguard, has seen this deceptive calm before.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you live here, you get used to the idea of hurricanes,
but you respect them,'' he said. ``This one demands a lot of
respect.''

 VICTIMS OF NAZIS ARE DEALT A BLOW IN LAWSUITS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By RONALD SMOTHERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ In separate decisions Monday, two federal judges
dealt a blow to efforts by the survivors of Nazi labor and
concentration camps to get reparations and damages from companies
that helped fuel the German war machine.
</P>
<P>
   The two judges dismissed class-action lawsuits brought against
the companies, most of which have sizable operations in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   In dismissing the lawsuits, both judges seemed to acknowledge
the horrors of the camps but lamented that the issues were not
appropriate for a federal court. The issues, they ruled, concerned
international treaties between nations, and foreign policy, and
were thus in the realm of the executive branch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Courts may not pass judgment upon the political negotiations
of the executive branch and the international community,'' Judge
Joseph Greenaway Jr. of U.S. District Court wrote in his 120-page
decision in one of the lawsuits, brought against Ford Motor Co. and
its former German counterpart in the World War II era, Ford Werke
AG. ``Such intrusion into the realm of foreign policy would
undermine the executive branch's sole discretion in the field of
international relations.''
</P>
<P>
   Writing separately in another group of four consolidated
class-action suits, Judge Dickinson Debevoise, also of U.S.
District Court, said every human instinct cried out for remedy in
the cases, but he added that the court did not have the right to
engage in the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not accurate to characterize the present actions as
simply controversies between private parties,'' Debevoise wrote in
his 78-page decision as he criticized one major contention of the
plaintiffs. ``In effect the plaintiffs are inviting this court to
try its hand at refashioning the reparations agreements which the
United States and other World War II combatants forged. This is a
task which the court does not have the judicial power to perform.''
</P>
<P>
   The four consolidated cases ruled on by Debevoise included
claims against Degussa AG, the chemicals and precious metals
company that refined gold seized by the Nazis and which
manufactured the deadly Zyklon B gas used in the concentration
camps.
</P>
<P>
   The other cases involved the giant electric company Siemens AG
and its aircraft-manufacturing operations during the war, which,
according to the plaintiffs, used as many as 100,000 slave laborers
provided by the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   Melvyn Weiss, a lawyer representing plaintiffs in the cases
before both judges, said he was disappointed by the rulings and
added that they would be appealed.
</P>
<P>
   But he said that he saw some hope in Debevoise's insistence that
government officials had some responsibility for addressing the
claims of people like his clients in negotiations with Germany, and
that Germany had some legal obligation to respond.
</P>
<P>
   ``It puts the Germans in a bad position because they have
insisted all along that they had no legal obligations in such
cases, just humanitarian obligations,'' Weiss said. ``It puts the
U.S. government in a box because they have always insisted that we
had no legal remedies.''
</P>
<P>
   He predicted that lawyers would press political institutions in
both nations to bring pressure on the governments to settle the
claims.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The rulings came in five of an estimated three dozen cases in
U.S. courts that seek damages from companies said to have profited
in Germany during the war years. Most of the lawsuits were filed in
the wake of the historic agreement by Swiss banks last year to
settle $1.25 billion in claims brought by Holocaust survivors who
accused them of failing to return their stolen assets after the
war.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for the companies involved in the cases could not be
reached for comment. But both Siemens and Degussa are among 16
companies involved in negotiations with the Conference on Jewish
Material Claims Against Germany, an international organization of
several groups seeking restitution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our view is that this is an issue that is one of morality,''
said Gideon Taylor, executive vice president of the organization.
``For us, the process of finding a just and a fair resolution of
these issues for slave laborers is one that will continue
regardless of court decisions.''

LINEUP SHUFFLES AS PRODIGALS RETURN

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ On the day the Bruins named a starting
quarterback, they also welcomed back 10 players from suspension and
immediately inserted six into the starting lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Tony White, Robert Thomas and Ryan Nece returned from the
disabled-parking-placard suspensions to fortify a depleted
linebacking corps. All three will start Saturday against Fresno
State.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Roques takes over at strong safety for Jason Stephens.
</P>
<P>
   Oscar Cabrera slides into his starting spot at left guard.
</P>
<P>
   And Durell Price is back as the No. 1 fullback. He replaces Matt
Stanley, who earned a scholarship but lacks Price's leadership
skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need some of that,'' coach Bob Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   Four other suspended players _ guard Jim Ghezzi, tailback Keith
Brown, safety Eric Whitfield and linebacker Ali Abdul Azziz _
return as reserves. The 11th suspended player, cornerback Marques
Anderson, is out for the fall quarter.
</P>
<P>
   __ The defense rests: The return of Roques and Whitfield means
tailback DeShaun Foster and receiver Freddie Mitchell will no
longer play defense in passing situations.
</P>
<P>
   Foster will remain the starting tailback, although his workload
diminishes with Brown's return.
</P>
<P>
   ``DeShaun got tired (against Ohio State),'' Toledo said. ``He
got 42 snaps, and Jermaine (Lewis) got 24. We'll take a few away
from DeShaun and give them to Keith.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Make way for the rookie: True freshman Ricky Manning, UCLA's
best defensive back so far, will start at right cornerback. Senior
Jason Bell won't play Saturday because of a nagging heel injury
that required offseason surgery.
</P>
<P>
   If Bell had been healthy, Toledo said, Manning would have
replaced redshirt freshman Joe Hunter at left cornerback.
</P>
<P>
   __ Position change: Outside linebacker Santi Hall has returned
to defensive end, the position he was expected to play before the
suspensions.
</P>
<P>
   Hall, a sophomore, becomes the No. 2 weakside end behind
freshman Rusty Williams _ the spot previously occupied by Travor
Turner, who is out for the year with a knee injury.
</P>
<P>
   __ Injury update: Reserve outside linebacker Billy Pieper will
miss two to four weeks because of a torn medial collateral ligament
in his right knee.
</P>
<P>
   Freshman guard Mike Saffer is out two to four weeks with a
sprained right ankle. His injury is significant from a personnel
standpoint: He's one of the best players on an inexperienced unit.
Senior guard Matt Phelan, who had been starting for the suspended
Cabrera, slides over to Saffer's spot.
</P>
<P>
   Receiver Danny Farmer, who tweaked his sprained left ankle at
Ohio State, is expected to play Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   __ Odds and ends: Stanley was named offensive player of the
game. Safety Joey Strycula _ ``He's like a coach on the field,''
Toledo said _ was the top defensive player, and walk-on Adam
Geitner won the special-teams honor. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Roques replaces Mitchell as the punt returner. Mitchell and
Lewis will continue to return kicks. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Right tackle Brian Polak and receiver Brad Melsby were named
captains this week. . . .
</P>
<P>
   The Sept. 25 game at Stanford begins at 2 p.m. and won't be
televised live. However, Fox Sports West 2 will show the game
delayed at 3:30 p.m.

<P>
   A month later, sitting in the Jasper County Jail, he came to
this conclusion about his role in the murder:
</P>
<P>
   ``I am the God-damned hero of the day!'' he wrote to a friend at
his old prison unit.
</P>
<P>
   In the eight-page letter, intercepted by jailers and read to the
jury Monday on the first day of testimony in Brewer's capital
murder trial, the defendant wrote of a conversation he once had
with another inmate while serving time for burglary and parole
violations at the Beto I prison unit in Tennessee Colony.
</P>
<P>
   That prisoner, whom Brewer called Jason ``Red Arm,'' had spoken
of ``rolling a tire,'' prison slang for assaulting a black person.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I did it; and no longer am I a virgin!'' Brewer wrote.
``It was a rush and I'm still lickin' my lips for more ... ''
</P>
<P>
   But while prosecutors insist the letter is a virtual confession
to the June 7, 1998, murder of James Byrd Jr., Brewer's defense
team was equally as adamant that the letter could be read more
literally to convey that Brewer was referring to having sex.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, in a 15-minute, low-key opening statement, Jasper
County District Attorney Guy James Gray told the 12 jurors and two
alternates that Brewer, 32, was the mentor and hate teacher for his
former prison buddy and co-defendant John William ``Bill'' King
when King was approached to join the Confederate Knights of
America, a small prison gang affiliated with the Ku Klux Klan.
</P>
<P>
   ``He schooled the young man,'' Gray said. ``This guy was the
mentor. He took him under his wing and taught him about the
structure of the organization.''
</P>
<P>
   A Jasper jury convicted King, 24, last February and sentenced
him to death. A third defendant, Shawn Allen Berry, also 24, is to
be tried later this fall in Jasper.
</P>
<P>
   Gray told the jury that Brewer, who would face life in prison or
death by injection if convicted, ``sees himself as a hero, a
star.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He sees that he's accomplished something,'' the prosecutor
said. ``It's really a weird mindset.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Jesus Moran, a prison inmate who met Brewer at the
Huntsville Diagnostic Unit after his arrest in Byrd's killing,
testified that Brewer had expressed no remorse for the crime,
saying only that if he had to do it all over again, he would make
sure he got away with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it was up to them, they would like to take the whole black
population and shoot them behind the head _ men, women and
children,'' Moran said.
</P>
<P>
   Brewer's attorneys, Doug Barlow and Layne Walker of Beaumont,
declined to give an opening statement, but put on a vigorous
defense, cross-examining all eight witnesses who took the stand.
</P>
<P>
   Brewer also seemed animated in court. Wearing a white shirt, tie
and a navy sportcoat that hid his racist tattoos as well as a stun
belt, Brewer sat with his arm around the back of Walker's chair.
Throughout the day, he whispered to his attorneys, and at one point
while waiting for the jury to return from lunch, he laughed out
loud and patted Walker on the back.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors and several witnesses described Brewer as a
committed racist who had risen in the ranks of the CKA and had
signed a blood oath to the Klan in 1995. By the time King arrived
at Beto I, Brewer was already the top CKA officer at the prison,
the ``Exalted Cyclops.''
</P>
<P>
   Moving rapidly, prosecutors had put on four witnesses by lunch
time and had shown the nine-man, five-woman jury more than a dozen
color photographs of Byrd's corpse.
</P>
<P>
   The photographs, which have not been made public and which the
Byrd family has never seen, show Byrd's dismembered, decapitated
body lying in the middle of Huff Creek Road east of Jasper, just
outside the gates to a rural black cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   They also show his upper torso and head as it was found the
morning after the murder, in a ditch about a mile down from the
rest of his body. They also were shown photos taken during Byrd's
autopsy.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd's father, his siblings and other relatives sat in the front
few rows of the courtroom, next to the jury box. Having sat through
the trial of King earlier this year, there were few surprises for
the family in Monday's testimony.
</P>
<P>
   But Clara Taylor, Byrd's sister, said she did not realize until
Monday that her brother's pants had been stripped down to his
ankles before he was dragged to his death.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought it was pulled down in the dragging,'' she said
afterward. ``It shows the intense cruelty of Brewer and all three
of them. They meant to inflict serious punishment.''

 &HT;    Motion in Branch Davidian suit says expert will prove FBI fired
shots
 &HT;    By Mark England
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Plaintiffs in the Branch Davidian lawsuit against
the government filed a motion Monday in Waco's federal court
stating they have an expert who will testify his analysis of a FLIR
tape shows at least 60 shots were fired at the Davidians by the FBI
on the day their residence burned down. FLIR stands for
forward-looking infrared film, which, basically, picks up the heat
signatures of objects.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Allard was listed among the plaintiffs' expert witnesses
for the lawsuit, set for trial on Oct. 18.
</P>
<P>
   Allard _ who made similar claims in the film ``Waco: Rules of
Engagement'' _ said he recently analyzed a FLIR tape brought to him
by Mike McNulty, who is producing his second film on Waco.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any layman can look at what I looked at and say it's gunshots,
assuming he knows something about gunshots,'' said Allard, who
worked 10 years in the Army's Night Vision Laboratory and is a
physicist at a private company in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   On at least three occasions, the FLIR film he analyzed showed
automatic weapons fire directed at the Davidians on April 19, 1993,
once while their residence was on fire, Allard said.
</P>
<P>
   A government plane shot the FLIR images while circling Mount
Carmel at 9,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the FLIR shows is that while a fire is engulfing the
kitchen area, gun positions on the outside are pouring automatic
gunfire in there,'' Allard said. ``I stopped counting at 45 shots.
You don't see 45 shots. You see a flash here, a flash there. But if
you break the film down, you can actually count the number of
rounds.''
</P>
<P>
   The gun positions were about 30 yards away from the kitchen
area, according to Allard, who believes the Davidians were
essentially trapped in the fire.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department and FBI officials declined to comment on
Allard's allegations.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's all part of the Danforth investigation,'' an FBI
spokesman said. ``We wouldn't want to comment.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Mike Caddell, who represents some of the plaintiffs in
the Davidian lawsuit, said he had seen the FLIR tape that Allard
analyzed. Caddell plans to present it during the upcoming trial, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's the most dramatic evidence that there was gunfire
from government positions,'' Caddell said. ``At the end of the day,
I think that's what this case is going to be about. I don't know
this many years after the fact if we can prove who started the
fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Allard said he believes most people will conclude the
``flashes'' seen in the FLIR tape are gunshots. Caddell agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know of nothing in nature that will create that kind of
rapid heat generation,'' Caddell said. ``I can't imagine what else
it could be. Light would not heat up something so quickly and then
cool off so rapidly that it would disappear.''
</P>
<P>
   A firm hired by the Washington Post to examine the FLIR images
seen in ``Waco: Rules of Engagement'' argued that the flashes could
be reflections of sunlight. Allard dismissed that premise, arguing
that the company making the claim handles government contracts. He
also claimed its methodology for studying the FLIR tape was flawed.
</P>
<P>
   Allard said you can measure the flashes shown on the FLIR in
60ths of a second. Some of the flashes last 3/60ths of a second,
which he said corresponds to automatic weapon fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``No technical person I know of that's looked at the tapes said
it's anything but gunfire,'' Allard said.
</P>
<P>
   The FLIR tape also picked up an image of Davidians on rooftops
shooting at targets away from their residence, according to Allard,
who said the gunfire took place some time before the fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we saw were two gun positions on the roof,'' Allard said.
``We couldn't see the men at all. They had warmed up. They were the
same temperature of the roof. The FLIR, which sees changes in
temperature, couldn't see them. We saw flashes, three of them. They
appeared to be firing into the field around them.''
</P>
<P>
   Also Monday, the government filed a motion asking for two more
weeks to produce its list of expert witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   According to the motion, the Department of Justice can't meet
this week's deadline to produce the list because its attorneys must
review all records in their possession pursuant to a subpoena from
the Government Reform Committee of the House of Representatives,
which is reinvestigating what happened at Mount Carmel.

STATION CASINOS INC. MAKES OFFER FOR FLAMINGO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICK ALM  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Station Casinos Inc. on Monday announced a
surprise purchase of the Flamingo Hilton Casino for $22.5 million,
leaving its main Kansas City rival Harrah's literally surrounded.
</P>
<P>
   John V. Finamore, Station Casinos Inc. president for Midwest
operations, said the company intends to keep the casino open,
retain its estimated 800 employees and remodel and rebrand the
riverboat as a Station property.
</P>
<P>
   The Flamingo's proposed sale to Trump Hotels &AMP; Casino Resorts
Inc. for $15 million fell apart in recent weeks as the Missouri
Gaming Commission showed signs it was balking at approving the
sale.
</P>
<P>
   When the deal was announced in January, Trump and the Hilton
Hotels Corp. agreed either side could walk away after midnight Aug.
31 if regulatory approval hadn't been granted, and that's what
happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``This happened very quickly, in the last 10 days or so,''
Finamore said Monday, after ``it became very clear the Trump deal
was not going to go through.''
</P>
<P>
   Station's proposed purchase still faces approval by the Missouri
Gaming Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Finamore said Station couldn't pass up the deal for a property
that cost an estimated $119 million to build. ``This is a great
deal for our company,'' he said. ``For $22.5 million this was a
no-brainer.''
</P>
<P>
   The sale calls for Station to assume Hilton's land lease
payments used to help repay bonds issued to develop the Richard L.
Berkley Riverfront Park, Finamore said.
</P>
<P>
   The move is an about-face of sorts for Station, which locally
had put its own expansion plans on hold during a capital spending
slowdown by its Las Vegas parent.
</P>
<P>
   Harrah's Entertainment Inc. and a group associated with St. Jo
Frontier Casino owner William M. Grace also were thought to be
among the interested potential bidders.
</P>
<P>
   Mel Fisher, executive director of the Missouri Gaming
Commission, had little to say about Station's announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are a company in good standing in this state,'' he said.
``We're still digesting the implications.''
</P>
<P>
   Those implications revolve around the prospect of two companies,
Station and Harrah's, dominating Missouri's gaming marketplace with
ownership of 12 of the state's 16 casino properties.
</P>
<P>
   Each company would own three of Kansas City's seven riverboats
(including Harrah's ownership of the now-closed Sam's Town casino).
</P>
<P>
   In St. Louis, Station would own two boats and Harrah's four,
after the expected approval of its announced purchase of Players
International Inc., which operates the Riverport gambling complex
in partnership with Harrah's in Maryland Heights.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's two big players,'' Fisher said. ``It's certainly
something we will look at.''
</P>
<P>
   Fisher would not discuss the commission's now-ended review of
the Trump bid. But regulators here and in New Jersey, where the
company is based, have expressed concern in recent months about the
Trump company's ability to service its $1.8 billion debt.
</P>
<P>
   Finamore said Station hopes to win state regulatory approval and
close the deal before the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have a name for it yet,'' he added. ``It will be a
Station property operated by us.''
</P>
<P>
   Station also operates its Station Casino Kansas City complex.
</P>
<P>
   Between Station Casino Kansas City and the Flamingo lies Kansas
City marketplace rival Harrah's North Kansas City Casino &AMP; Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Since last fall Station and Harrah's have vied for the market
share lead, with Station now holding a slim lead.
</P>
<P>
   Las Vegas-based Station Casinos Inc. intends to spend several
million dollars in installing new slot machines, carpeting and
other upgrades, Finamore said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of it will go to removing the Flamingo identity and
`Stationizing' it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Finamore said it was too early to discuss long-term plans that
might include a hotel and other nongambling amenities.
</P>
<P>
   Trump Hotels agreed to purchase the Flamingo for $15 million _
less than 15 cents on the dollar that it cost to build the purple
and pink gambling palace a few miles north of downtown Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   The ownership change was quietly engineered late last year to
take Hilton off the hook with the gaming commission over
still-pending bribery and perjury allegations that have threatened
Hilton's gaming licenses in other states.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year Missouri gaming officials appeared more than
ready to approve the deal and be done with Hilton.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1998 Hilton agreed to pay the federal
government $655,000 in fines and penalties to avoid a criminal
trial on federal allegations that Hilton executives provided
financial rewards to associates of then-Kansas City Port Authority
Chairman Elbert Anderson in exchange for his political support for
the casino, built on city-owned land.
</P>
<P>
   Hilton maintains that neither it nor any of its employees did
anything illegal or improper, said Marc Grossman, spokesman for the
Beverly Hills, Calif.-based company.
</P>
<P>
   Hilton remains under threat of being fined, suspended or
stripped of its Missouri Gaming Commission license unless it sells
the property _ soon.
</P>
<P>
   Hilton wrote the struggling casino off its books as a financial
loss in 1997. Since then the market has grown, Sam's Town has
closed, and the Flamingo has held on to a respectable 13 percent
market share.
</P>
<P>
   That, and the imminent prospect of open boarding at Missouri's
riverboat casinos made the Flamingo a desirable if modest
acquisition for expansion-minded gaming companies, Finamore said.
</P>
<P>
   Grossing in excess of $5.5 million a month, ``It's going to be a
nice revenue stream for our company,'' Finamore said.
</P>
<P>
   Station also operates casinos in Las Vegas.

RIDEAUX COULD RETURN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC freshman cornerback Darrell Rideaux seems
likely to play Saturday against San Diego State, although his back
injury could limit his role in the secondary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he'll be 100 percent, but he'll be available,''
USC coach Paul Hackett said. ``We'll have to see how the week goes.
Hopefully, the rest gave him some strength back and didn't pound
him down.''
</P>
<P>
   The more interesting question seems to be Rideaux's injury
itself. Rideaux said he had back spasms following USC's practice
Sunday night. But according to several sources, he actually has a
stress fracture suffered last June when a runner collided with him
at the state track championships.
</P>
<P>
   Rideaux said his back is ``a day-to-day thing'' but again
downplayed the possibility he would redshirt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a factor. At this point, we don't think the injury is
that severe,'' Rideaux said. ``That decision will be made by coach
Hackett in the upcoming days.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett was a little less certain to rule out the possibility of
redshirting.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be a long shot. It's not out of the question but
unlikely,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   Rideaux missed USC's opener with Hawaii and the Trojans' depth
at cornerback is a problem with freshman Kevin Arbet expected to
miss this week's contest with a sprained ankle. That leaves senior
Tanqueray Clark and sophomore Eric Reese to compete for the nickel
back position, unless Rideaux is able to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a matter of where do I fit in the game plan,'' Rideaux
said. ``Now I have to find out where do I fit in.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Garner update: Junior wide receiver Troy Garner of Notre Dame
High will meet with Hackett this week regarding his two-week
suspension from the team. Garner was suspended during training camp
at UC Irvine after arguing with strength coach Matt Schiotz.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to get together this week to clear the air,''
Hackett said. ``I would anticipate he would be back if not this
coming week, then the following week.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Scouting report: After watching game tapes of San Diego
State's loss to Illinois, Hackett was encouraged by the way the
Illini's defense harassed Aztecs quarterbacks Brian Russell and
Jack Hawley into completing only 17 of 40 passes for 179 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``The quarterbacks did not play particularly well,'' Hackett
said. ``Illinois did some things that could help us.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Oregon time announced: USC's game with Oregon on Sept. 25
will have a 7:15 p.m. kickoff and be televised on Fox Sports West.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans' game with Oregon State at the Coliseum on Oct. 2
will either kickoff at 12:30 p.m. or 3:30 p.m., with 3:30 the most
likely time.
</P>
<P>
   __ They're No. 1: Based on their 62 points against Hawaii, the
Trojans find themselves No. 1 in the country in the NCAA national
rankings for scoring offense.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans are also tied for first in turnover margin at
plus-3.

RECORDS SHOW CONGRESS HAD WACO TEAR GAS FILES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
and JIM HENDERSON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The FBI's use of potentially combustible tear gas
during the 1993 assault on the Branch Davidian compound is outlined
in documents the Justice Department delivered to Congress four
years ago, according to records disclosed Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Democrats said the documents cast doubt on
Republican claims that the Justice Department was trying to conceal
the FBI's deployment of the military-style tear gas canisters near
the fiery end of the standoff near Waco.
</P>
<P>
   The documents _ handwritten notes and summaries of interviews
with FBI agents _ were delivered to the House Government Reform
Committee in 1995 along with other evidence related to the 51-day
siege.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic staff members said they found the documents over the
weekend while combing through more than 40 boxes of files put in
storage after the committee's 1994-95 investigation of the standoff
between federal agents and the Branch Davidian religious sect.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery prompted criticism of top-ranking Republicans,
particularly House Government Reform Chairman Dan Burton and Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott, who have led the GOP chorus calling for
the resignation of Attorney General Janet Reno, who oversees the
Justice Department and FBI.
</P>
<P>
   ``Contrary to the allegations of a cover-up, substantial
evidence of the use of military tear gas rounds was, in fact,
provided to Congress in 1995,'' said California Rep. Henry Waxman,
the committee's top-ranking Democrat. ``There is no indication that
Chairman Burton or his staff thought to review these documents
before accusing the attorney general of a cover-up.''
</P>
<P>
   The FBI acknowledged last month _ after six years of denials _
that agents fired rounds of potentially incendiary military tear
gas at the roof of a concrete bunker near the Branch Davidian
compound. The canisters were fired hours before fire enveloped the
compound, the FBI said, standing by earlier claims that the tear
gas did not trigger the fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was a cover-up about what was in these documents, you
could say that the Congress was covering up these documents just as
much as the attorney general was covering up the documents,''
Waxman said.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, who are preparing for new hearings into the Waco
incident, bridled at Waxman's assertion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfortunate that Mr. Waxman chose partisan attacks over a
serious attempt to get to the facts,'' said Mark Corallo, a
spokesman for Burton. ``You have to take it with a grain of salt.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At worst, what we have is an oversight by congressional staff
in 1995 when they were looking through hundreds of thousands of
pages of documents,'' Corallo said, adding that Republican staff
members still have not found the material. ``Somehow they (the
Democrats) found it right away, in a couple of hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Corallo pointed out that Burton was not committee chairman when
the Justice Department turned over evidence to Congress, much of it
three days before the committee's hearings into the raid.
</P>
<P>
   The documents found by Waxman's staff were turned over to former
Sen. John Danforth, a Missouri Republican who was named by Reno
last week to lead an independent inquiry into the FBI's role in the
deadly fire at the compound. More than 80 people _ including about
two dozen children _ died inside the compound during the FBI
attack.
</P>
<P>
   Among the documents was a Justice Department interview in 1993
with an FBI pilot who recalled a radio conversation between agents
on the ground discussing ``utilization of some sort of military
round ... on a concrete bunker'' near the Davidian compound.
</P>
<P>
   Also released by Waxman were copies of handwritten notes
indicating that ``smoke from bunker came when these guys tried to
shoot gas into the bunker (military gas round).'' The notes also
said that ``rounds bounced off.'' One interview summary said an FBI
agent reported that ``smoke on film came from attempt to penetrate
bunker w/1 military and 2 ferret rounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Texas Rangers released a 13-page report Monday
indicating that casings from spent ammunition _ the kind often used
by professional snipers _ were found in a house near the Davidian
compound. The building had been used by federal agents during the
standoff.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI has maintained that its agents did not fire their
weapons during the final assault on April 19, 1993. Officials at
the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms acknowledge that its
sharpshooters used the house during the initial gunbattle with
David Koresh and his Branch Davidian followers.
</P>
<P>
   A Houston lawyer representing plaintiffs in a wrongful death
suit said Monday that the casings may be meaningless unless the
government produces the rifles that fired them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're never going to see those rifles,'' said Jim Brannon.
``They've probably been broken down and sold for scrap by now.''
</P>
<P>
   In the report submitted to Congress on Friday and posted on the
Internet on Monday, the Texas Rangers, which had been custodian of
most of the evidence gathered at the scene, said 12 .308-caliber
casings and 24 Israeli-made .223-caliber casings were recovered
from the house used by the FBI throughout the standoff.
</P>
<P>
   The agent in charge of the house was Lon Horiuchi, an FBI sniper
who fired the shots that killed the wife of a white separatist at
Ruby Ridge, Idaho, a few months before the Waco standoff. Another
FBI agent initially reported hearing shots fired from the house on
the last day of the siege, but the agency now says that account was
inaccurate and the agent has changed his story.
</P>
<P>
   Without matching the shells to the guns, Brannon said, it would
be impossible to know if the cartridges were fired by ATF or FBI
agents.
</P>
<P>
   That issue probably will have to be resolved in Congress, and
not in the civil wrongful death suit filed by survivors of the Waco
victims. That suit has been scheduled for trial on Oct. 18 and the
cut-off date for discovery was Sept. 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under ordinary circumstances, we would make them cough up
those guns,'' Brannon said. ``But there can be no more discovery
except by agreement. I don't think the government's lawyers will
agree to cough up anything.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Walter Smith, who presided over the criminal
trials of 11 Davidians accused in the deaths of four ATF agents, is
also hearing the civil case and has not made rulings friendly to
the plaintiffs _ including delaying the trial until all of the
recently disclosed evidence can be studied.
</P>
<P>
   The government Monday asked for an extension to Sept. 24 to turn
over a list of expert witnesses in the suit. Government lawyers
said they could not produce the documents in time because they also
were trying to comply with congressional subpoenas.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the civil trial, the spent casings could raise new
questions about the credibility of the FBI and the steps it took to
end the siege.
</P>
<P>
   For six years, the Justice Department had maintained that the
Davidians, not FBI agents, started the fire that destroyed the
compound. Two weeks ago, the department acknowledged that its
agents did fire two pyrotechnic tear gas canisters on the last day
of the siege and had withheld that fact from Reno, who had
prohibited the use of such devices.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI made the admission after an independent filmmaker, Mike
McNulty, was given access to the Texas Rangers' evidence lockers
and was preparing to report the use of pyrotechnics in a
documentary to be released this fall.
</P>
<P>
   In the report to Congress, the Texas Department of Public Safety
included a memo from Sgt. George L. Turner, who found a 40 mm metal
cartridge near the compound the day after the siege ended and
reported it immediately to FBI agents. It turned out to be a M651
military tear gas grenade that burns at 500 to 700 degrees
Fahrenheit and ``is capable of igniting flammable items,''
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI has said that two of those cartridges were fired at the
bunker 40 yards from the compound, not at buildings occupied by the
Davidians.
</P>
<P>
   The Davidian compound burst into flames about six hours after
the FBI decided to end the standoff by breaking through the walls
with armored vehicles and inserting tear gas into the house.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' report _ an inventory and analysis of some of the
24,000 pounds of evidence in their custody _ notes that other
devices capable of starting a fire were used by government agents.
They include flash-bang grenades and military flares.

BILLIONAIRE'S EX-WIFE WANTS $4,400 A DAY FOR CHILD 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DAVID ROHDE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Patricia Duff unveiled for the first time Monday
exactly how much child support she says she needs from her
billionaire ex-husband, Ronald Perelman, to raise their 4-year-old
daughter _ $4,400 a day for the next 14 years.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Duff's request, which totals $22.3 million, came as she
concluded her phase of a snail-like custody trial in state Supreme
Court in Manhattan. Ms. Duff, a prominent Democratic fund-raiser
who is worth $23 million, and Perelman, the majority owner of
Revlon Inc. who is worth an estimated $6 billion, have been locked
in an ugly custody and child-support battle over their daughter,
Caleigh, for the last three years.
</P>
<P>
   If Ms. Duff was awarded the amounts that she requested, Perelman
would pay $1.6 million a year in child support, in addition to $1.3
million in alimony, to Ms. Duff until Caleigh turns 18. Ms. Duff's
supporters contend that such a settlement is piddling to a
multibillionaire like Perelman.
</P>
<P>
   On the witness stand Monday, Ms. Duff presented a detailed
budget listing Caleigh's monthly living expenses. According to Ms.
Duff, she spends $9,953 each month on travel expenses for Caleigh
and her nanny. A total of $3,175 a month is spent on clothing for
Caleigh, and $3,585 on ``recreational'' activities, she said. The
cost of Caleigh's personal domestic employees _ apparently nannies
and maids _ is $30,098 a month, and the 4-year-old dines out at a
cost of $1,450 a month, Ms. Duff said.
</P>
<P>
   As they have throughout the trial, Perelman's representatives
ridiculed the figures and suggested that Ms. Duff was trying to use
her daughter to pad her income. ``In her testimony, Ms. Duff was
only able to estimate actual expenses for Caleigh of $5,000 a
month, or $60,000 a year,'' said Allen Rubenstein, a spokesman for
Perelman. ``These numbers speak for themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   In a June 1998 affidavit, Ms. Duff estimated her monthly
child-support needs at $87,000 a month. The figure that she
proposed Monday was $132,000 a month.
</P>
<P>
   She also included a request that Perelman pay part of Caleigh's
housing costs. The cost of the Upper East Side apartment and the
Connecticut and East Hampton homes that Ms. Duff is proposing would
range from $1 million a year to $750,000 a year, she said. She also
estimated $1.3 million to $2 million in initial first-year start-up
costs.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Duff's time on the witness stand was not as contentious as
in recent days, when she was repeatedly reprimanded by Justice
Franklin Weissberg for failing to answer questions. When asked
whether Caleigh's nanny also flew first-class on four weekend trips
to Florida in 1997, she replied, ``Absolutely.''
</P>
<P>
   After her testimony, Ms. Duff repeated the argument of her
lawyer, Richard Emery, that Caleigh should enjoy the same standard
of living as Perelman's children from previous marriages. She said
the lifestyle that she was requesting paled in comparison with the
type of luxury that Perelman lived in.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not private jets,'' she said. ``It's not a big yacht.
It's rough parity with an Upper East Side family. It's a privileged
life, no question about it.''

COMMENTARY: BILL'S LITTLE GIFT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: Changes ``did'' to ``do'' in graf that begins ``The prisoners
...'' Changes ``the Israeli spy Jonathan Pollard'' to ``Jonathan
Pollard, who spied for Israel.'' Deletes last sentence of graf that
begins ``The Clintons ...'' Adds a new final graf.)  (jt) 
 By GAIL COLLINS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The idea that Bill Clinton let members of a terrorist group out
of jail for Hillary's sake is an interesting concept. It's the
political equivalent of giving your wife an anniversary gift of an
untrained collie. There are really a lot of things she could use
more.
</P>
<P>
   I'm in the minority on this, but I tend to believe the Clinton
camp's version of how the president came to offer clemency to
members of the Puerto Rican nationalist organization FALN. When the
choice is between a sneaky plot and all-purpose bumbling, in this
White House it's generally safe to go with Door Number Two.
</P>
<P>
   The president's supporters say he signed off on the clemency
request at the recommendation of aides, and that his wife had
nothing to do with it. Puerto Rican politicians, who are currently
in no mood to protect the first lady, support this version. Rep.
Nydia Velazquez, D-N.Y., says the deal was brokered by the
president's outgoing political counsel, Charles Ruff. ``We had a
very emotional meeting with Mr. Ruff,'' Ms. Velazquez said. ``We
cried. It was very moving. We tried to put a human face on these
political prisoners, people who have not been convicted of killing
anyone, who have spent up to 20 years away from their families.''
</P>
<P>
   The prisoners, all convicted of nonviolent crimes, do seem to
have gotten a raw deal in their sentencing _ who gets 90 years in
jail for bank robbery? They had actually already disavowed
violence, and it seems easy to imagine that the White House was
bowing to the thousands of pleas it had received from church groups
and other prominent figures.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for the president, the prisoners turned out to be
less than sympathetic figures for the country at large,
self-righteous and unbending. (You could see how they might have
appealed to Jimmy Carter.) One, Ricardo Jimenez, asked on NBC about
people killed by FALN bombings, basically blamed the proprietors of
the restaurants and taverns that got blown up. ``I think all
precautions were taken, you know, to make sure that all human life
was preserved,'' he said. ``And in the end the measures were not
taken that were necessary by the people who owned those
establishments.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton, who supported her husband at first, bailed out
when the deal came under fire. People like Velazquez were never
consulted. For all the listening the first lady has been doing, she
has apparently not learned that when you are making a decision
involving Puerto Rican sensibilities, you should at least touch
base with Puerto Rican politicians.
</P>
<P>
   But the whole idea of freeing the prisoners was a political
loser for Mrs. Clinton from the start. She's planning to run for
Senate against Rudolph Giuliani, a man who regards law and order as
his own name-brand franchise. New York has tons of different ethnic
groups, at least half of which have members in jail for allegedly
political crimes. If the president was pandering, as his critics
contended, he was pandering to a constituency already pretty safely
in his wife's corner, while making her appear soft on terrorism in
the suburbs and upstate, and alienating all the other ethnic groups
that failed to get their political prisoners sprung. Sure enough,
the Puerto Rican prisoners had not even gotten out of their cells
before Jewish supporters of Jonathan Pollard, who spied for Israel,
were demanding that Mrs. Clinton get behind his release, too.
</P>
<P>
   The real question may be why there was no one in the White House
protecting Mrs. Clinton's back who could have derailed the clemency
deal early on.
</P>
<P>
   But the administration is supposed to be in the business of
running the country, not electing Hillary senator. Mrs. Clinton has
been trying to have it both ways, basking in the real popularity
the president enjoys in New York and taking credit for his
administration's accomplishments, while distancing herself from the
problems.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons want us to believe that the president never told
Hillary about critical details of the clemency offer that might
have influenced her decision to jump ship. Maybe he didn't. Maybe
for the first time in their married life, they lost interest in
political plotting.
</P>
<P>
   But whatever he said or she said, the conspiracy theorists can't
have it both ways. If Bill Clinton is a purely poll-driven public
official who does nothing without weighing the potential gains and
losses, he could certainly have figured out that offering clemency
to people with even the remotest of connections to terrorism was
not going to be a crowd-pleaser. And if he was now making every
decision with his wife's Senate race in mind, he would never have
made this one.

SHARES SOAR AND SINK AFTER RULING ON GENE CHIPS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Shares in Incyte Pharmaceuticals Inc. plummeted
Monday and shares in Affymetrix Inc. soared after a judge ruled
last week in favor of Affymetrix in a patent dispute between the
two Silicon Valley companies over gene-chip technology.
</P>
<P>
   Late Friday, Judge Richard Torczon of the U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office ruled that Incyte had ``failed to establish a
threshold case'' against Affymetrix's patents.
</P>
<P>
   Incyte, which said it would appeal the decision, had sought to
block two Affymetrix patents on the production of DNA microarrays,
glass chips that are coated with genes for use in genetic analysis
and drug research.
</P>
<P>
   Affymetrix had already sued Incyte for patent infringement in
January 1998 after Incyte acquired this gene-chip technology with
its purchase of Synteni, a start-up company. The technology uses
liquid droplets to deposit DNA on glass, while Affymetrix uses
photolithography, the technique used to make computer chips on
silicon. But Affymetrix has always asserted that its patents
covered DNA microarrays regardless of how they were made.
</P>
<P>
   Incyte shares closed at $27.25, down $14.125, or 34 percent.
Affymetrix shares closed at $121.0625, up $19.9375, or 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the ruling indicated that the Patent Office was
taking a very broad interpretation of Affymetrix's patents, which
could effectively block any competitors in the microarray market.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does broadly cover the chip technology itself, and that is
why they have had this rise in the share price,'' said Viren Mehta,
an analyst with Mehta Partners. As for Incyte, he said, ``Right off
the bat, their microarray business, which contributed about 7 to 10
percent of their revenues, will suffer.''
</P>
<P>
   The broader question, he said, is how much Incyte depends on
internal use of the technology for its primary products _ databases
of genetic information and related analytical tools.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Bendekgey, Incyte's general counsel, said the Patent
Office's decision ``was based on limited evidence relating to only
two legal issues'' and did not address claims yet to be resolved in
the lawsuit, which is set for trial next year in California. ``We
continue to believe that these defenses will enable us to prevail
at trial,'' he said, ``just as we defeated Affymetrix's earlier
request for a preliminary injunction.''
</P>
<P>
   The injunction would have blocked sales of Incyte's product. But
Affymetrix officials said that they were confident they would
prevail at trial and that the hurdle in winning a preliminary
injunction _ proving irreparable harm _ was difficult because they
had lost few actual sales to Incyte.
</P>
<P>
   They estimated that Incyte's sales of the infringing technology
amounted to only $2 million this year, while Affymetrix had sales
for the first six months of $39.5 million.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``A lot of the customers now are going to believe we have won
this,'' said Vern Norviel, Affymetrix's general counsel. He said
that Affymetrix had licensed or was negotiating licenses to a
number of companies with microarray products and that he expected
others to follow. ``There are many methods that could be used to
get to a chip,'' he said. ``We have the patent on a chip.''
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Affymetrix said it had agreed to acquire Genetic
Microsystems Inc., a privately held company in Woburn, Mass., in a
stock swap valued at about $121 million. Affymetrix said there was
demand for Genetic Micro's microarrays, which cost less but contain
fewer genes per chip than Affymetrix's.

LAIDLAW SELLING TWO BUSINESSES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: S.C., Canada)  (lb) 
 By TIMOTHY PRITCHARD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ Laidlaw Inc., the Canadian-based operator of North
America's largest bus fleet, including the Greyhound lines, said
Monday that it intends to sell two major businesses that have
depressed its stock price and no longer fit its core transportation
strategy, and to use some of the $2 billion in anticipated proceeds
to buy more buses.
</P>
<P>
   One of the holdings for sale, a 44 percent stake in Safety-Kleen
Corp., an industrial services provider, is a link with Laidlaw's
past in transporting industrial waste. The other is its health-care
division, which includes the largest ambulance service in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   But industrial waste disposal no longer attracts investors, and
Laidlaw has spent the better part of a year trying to restructure
its ambulance operation, American Medical Response, and has nothing
but expenses to show for it. Over the last year, Laidlaw shares
have dropped by 30 percent in value.
</P>
<P>
   News of the planned asset sale pleasantly surprised investors.
Laidlaw shares gained 75 cents, or 11.4 percent, to close at
$7.3125 on the New York Stock Exchange. Shares of Safety-Kleen,
which is based in Columbia, S.C., rose $1.0625, or 8.5 percent, to
$13.50.
</P>
<P>
   The planned sales mark a strategy shift for James Bullock, the
chief executive of Laidlaw, who oversaw the company's
diversification. After the sales, Bullock said, ``Laidlaw will
focus on expanding our position as North America's largest provider
of specialty bus services.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to its school-bus fleet, Laidlaw became a major
operator of intercity buses with the acquisition of Greyhound Lines
in March.
</P>
<P>
   The company has hired Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. as an adviser and it
expects the asset sales to be completed in the next six to 12
months. With the sale of its Safety-Kleen and health-care
operations, the company said it hopes to ``realize net proceeds in
excess of $2 billion.''
</P>
<P>
   Laidlaw's increased focus on the bus business comes against a
background of sharply increased competition in the North American
market from British rivals.
</P>
<P>
   In June, Stagecoach Holdings PLC, Britain's largest bus and
railroad company, agreed to buy Coach USA Inc. for $1.88 billion to
become the largest charter-bus and tour operator in the United
States. In July, the British bus operator FirstGroup PLC said it
would buy Ryder System Inc.'s school-bus business for $940 million.
</P>
<P>
   Although Laidlaw began as a trucker of industrial waste, its
stake in Safety-Kleen is all that remains of that part of its past.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have been trying to distance themselves from that
particular business,'' said Cam Hon, an analyst at Dominion Bond
Rating Service in Toronto. He said the size of the Safety-Kleen
stake may help Laidlaw sell above the market price.
</P>
<P>
   Laidlaw's financial statements for the year ended Aug. 31, 1999,
will describe the properties to be sold as discontinued operations,
and an expected loss of $1 billion ($3.03 a share) will be taken on
the sale of the health-care division. Besides American Medical
Response, which has annual revenue of $1 billion, this division
includes Emcare, a medical-practice management company with annual

MALONE AND PIAZZA: WHAT A SAGA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; Pinch me, please. Wake me from my dream. I'm not on this
planet, am I? Where am I? Is this how it feels to be among the
dearly departed? Is this reality, or a catatonic trance, or
someone's idea of a surrealistic joke?
</P>
<P>
   I read something over the weekend that left me bewildered,
bewitched, befuddled and, yes, bemused.
</P>
<P>
   I read honestly, it was right there on the sports pages of the
largest-circulation newspaper in L.A. that Kevin Malone made
contact with the New York Mets about the possibility of bringing
Mike Piazza back to the Los Angeles Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   I'm sure the next thing I'm going to hear is that Kevin Malone
has asked President Bill Clinton about the possibility of his being
named a special UN envoy to Indonesia so he can help resolve the
conflict in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   Or perhaps Kevin Malone will ask NASA officials about the
possibility of his being included on the next space shuttle to
Mars, or maybe he will call Al Davis up in Oakland and ask Davis
about the possibility of his playing quarterback for the Raiders.
</P>
<P>
   Outlandish?
</P>
<P>
   Of course.
</P>
<P>
   But no more fanciful than the startling report that Kevin Malone
actually went to the Mets allegedly sound of mind, body and soul
and sought Piazza.
</P>
<P>
   Now ol' Kev has set himself up for enough ridicule during his
brief incumbency as chief choreographer of the Dodgers' comedy
troupe, actually predicting during the off-season that this
rollicking team would be spending a portion of October in the World
Series.
</P>
<P>
   You would think Malone would now be treading cautiously in his
utterances and actions, but this is a guy with a habit of walking
in the dark in steep terrain and stumbling haplessly into the
abyss.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, Kevin Malone actually thinks he can alter the course
of history at mid-stream, reversing the steady flow of past
mistakes perpetuated by himself and by those who employ him.
</P>
<P>
   If the Dodgers were willing to part with Piazza, reasons Malone,
then wouldn't the Mets be willing to partake in the same insanity?
</P>
<P>
   I'm sure as I write this, Kevin Malone is busy talking to the
Boston Red Sox about Pedro Martinez, the sterling pitcher who also
was discarded by the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   And, if the truth were known, I'm sure Kevin Malone during his
meeting with the Mets also inquired about Roger Cedeno, still
another Dodgers retread who's gone on to bigger and better things
outside L.A.
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, I'm aghast at the revelation that Malone even attempted
to lure Piazza back, considering the Mets just gave Piazza a
seven-year, $91 million contact, considering the Mets have become a
serious National League playoff contender since Piazza's arrival,
considering Piazza is having another banner season, considering the
Mets are desperately trying to close the gap between themselves and
their more successful crosstown rivals, the New York Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Did Kevin Malone actually believe the Mets would be so myopic,
so imbecilic, so crazed, so like, well, the Dodgers, to give up a
commodity of the magnitude of Mike Piazza?
</P>
<P>
   One idly wonders if Malone's bizarre proposal was nothing more
than a flimsy PR gesture at the behest of the gentlemen reportedly
responsible for Piazza's excommunication, Fox executives Chase
Carey and Peter Chernin, and Dodger president Bob (Don't Call Me
Rocky) Graziano.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodger patrons I talk to still are outraged by Piazza's
ouster and aren't appeased one iota by Malone's latest bit of
zaniness.
</P>
<P>
   From what I've been told about this entire farce, the Mets felt
insulted that Malone would come to them with such a proposition in
the first place.
</P>
<P>
   I mean, do the Dodgers think the Mets are as dumb as they are?
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, if nothing else, Kevin Malone is at least injecting a
few early September cackles into a Southern California baseball
season that has been a disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Poor Kev.
</P>
<P>
   The guy hasn't got anything right since he was tabbed to succeed
Tom Lasorda as Dodger GM. He got rid of a catcher who could catch,
Charles Johnson, for one who can't, Todd Hundley. He brought in an
aging center fielder playing out the record in Devon White. He gave
a multi-year, multi-million dollar contract to a guy who can't
pitch, Carlos Perez. I have no idea what reason he brought Alan
Mills to the Dodgers other than to give up base hits to opposing
batters.
</P>
<P>
   Still, I grudgingly must admit I have a deep fondness and strong
admiration for Kevin Malone.
</P>
<P>
   This is a religious man who displays courage beyond the divine
duty of his calling.
</P>
<P>
   The shocking fact that he actually phoned the Mets and inquired
about Mike Piazza gives you a clear insight into the enlightened
forces now running one of the storied franchises in baseball
history.

EDITORIAL: AN EFFECTIVE FORCE FOR EAST TIMOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Sept. 14
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot wait any longer,'' Indonesia's president, B.J.
Habibie, said on Sunday. ``We have to stop the suffering and
mourning immediately.'' With those words, Habibie bowed to world
opinion and agreed to allow international peacekeepers into East
Timor. But important questions remain about when _ and with what
powers _ the force will go in. The international community needs to
maintain political and financial pressure on Indonesia to accept a
force large and powerful enough to protect East Timor's people _
and to do so immediately, before thousands more are killed.
</P>
<P>
   Militias created and backed by Indonesia's military have been
rampaging in East Timor for months, but the violence dramatically
worsened after an Aug. 30 vote that overwhelmingly supported
independence for the disputed province, which Indonesia invaded and
swallowed in 1975. The militias have set fire to much of the
country and killed perhaps thousands of people, many of them the
pro-independence intelligentsia. Others have been rounded up and
taken to West Timor, and tens of thousands have fled to the
mountains, where they are in danger of starving.
</P>
<P>
   Habibie's announcement that he would accept an international
force took considerable political courage, as the idea is hugely
unpopular with Indonesians and especially with its powerful
military establishment. He agreed after several countries began to
cut off joint training exercises, as well as military aid and
sales, and important donors and the International Monetary Fund and
World Bank suggested that they would condition further assistance
on Indonesia's performance in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   The peacekeeping force, which requires the blessing of the U.N.
Security Council, would be organized and led by Australia.
Australian officials say they will provide about 4,500 of the
anticipated 7,000 troops needed if Indonesia's military in East
Timor is cooperative. They claim they can get 2,000 troops to East
Timor within 72 hours of U.N. approval.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton says that Washington does not anticipate
providing ground troops for the mission, but that American support
forces would assist with logistics, intelligence, airlift and
coordination. Australia has maintained that American expertise is
needed for these tasks, and this is an appropriate role for the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday the Security Council met to hear a chilling report
from a delegation of U.N. ambassadors that had just returned from
East Timor, and to begin to negotiate the details of the force.
Happily, Indonesia has retreated from earlier statements that the
unit should contain only Asians. The world needs to keep up the
economic and diplomatic pressure to convince Habibie that the force
must be able to detain militia members or Indonesian soldiers who
terrorize the population or menace peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   Habibie has already agreed to a commission to look into human
rights violations. Those investigators must be able to work freely.
Most crucial, Habibie cannot be permitted to stall. There will soon
be nothing left of East Timor to save.  &QL;

TV SPORTS: WILLIAMS SISTERS WINNERS ON AND OFF CENTER COURT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Was Serena Williams' victory Saturday in the U.S. Open the
tennis equivalent of Tiger Woods' 1997 Masters triumph? Will the
Serena Effect _ or the combined Serena-Venus Effect _ rival Woods'
dramatic impact on television ratings?
</P>
<P>
   The questions are natural in view of CBS' overnight Nielsen
ratings for the women's semifinals and final. The caution, of
course, is that the Woods Effect has proved itself for more than
two years. The Williamses have done it once.
</P>
<P>
   Serena's defeat of Martina Hingis on Saturday delivered a 7.2
rating, doubling the rating for last year's Hingis-Lindsay
Davenport final and the highest such overnight rating ever for a
U.S. Open women's match. After a five-hour rain delay on Friday
that shifted the women's semifinals into a later time period with
more households watching, Serena's victory over Davenport produced
a 4.0 rating, an increase of 48 percent from 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Venus' loss to Hingis, which occurred partly during prime time,
generated a stunning 5.9 rating, an increase of 111 percent from a
year ago when she lost to Davenport.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without a doubt, Venus and Serena have the ability to attract
the casual tennis fan and people who don't watch tennis because of
their larger-than-life personas,'' Rob Correa, a CBS Sports vice
president, said.
</P>
<P>
   But he added that few tennis events are on network television _
the U.S. Open, Wimbledon and the French Open chiefly among them _
so the Williams' impact on network television will be somewhat
muted. ``Tiger can be on network TV every Saturday and Sunday,'' he
said, ``which isn't true with tennis.''
</P>
<P>
   CBS should have taken out full-page newspaper ads to thank the
Williamses for their good Nielsen deeds. But that was left to Puma
(``Serena Rocks!''), the footwear and apparel company endorsed by
Serena, and the National Fluid Milk Processor Promotion Board,
which used the sisters to ask, ``Got Milk?'' With the sisters
together, the ad says: ``One Cup. Two Straws, Please.''
</P>
<P>
   The surging careers of the Williams sisters will make the price
tags of their endorsement deals escalate. With Venus' five-year,
$14 million Reebok deal expiring in April, the cost of keeping her
concerns the company. ``She's a key person for us, on par with
Allen Iverson,'' Dave Fogelson, a Reebok spokesman, said. ``We're
looking at making her an overall brand icon in the fitness
category. She's in our plans, but we can't break the bank.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Venus did not win Saturday, Fogelson said, ``The
excitement she and her sister generated is more important than just
one of them coming to the fore, so Reebok and Puma benefit from the
synergy.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Davis, the Williams' lawyer, said corporate interest in
the sisters has been strong for several months. ``But every deal is
evaluated on its own,'' he said. ``There's never been a sense of
urgency to rush into deals.''
</P>
<P>
   The Williamses endorse Wilson Hammer rackets and recently
appeared in American Express print ads, a one-shot deal that Davis
hopes to expand. Bob Williams, the president of Burns Sports, which
matches athletes to advertisers, said: ``Up until now there's been
more demand for them to be together, but that will change as their
careers start to diverge. There's great potential for them to
develop a rivalry.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis said some companies will want one sister or the other, but
others will want them together. But he knows the sisters'
endorsement future depends on their court success. ``You have to
achieve greatness,'' he said. He pointed to the endorsement success
of the sexy Anna Kournikova, who has not won a tournament but who
is co-starring in a commercial for an investment company.
</P>
<P>
   ``How long will it last if she doesn't win?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   `NFL Today' Redux
</P>
<P>
   Last year, CBS' ``The NFL Today'' was a creative dud. By the
evidence of the revamped edition that made its debut on Sunday, the
studio show is alive and well. The three analysts _ Craig James,
Randy Cross and Jerry Glanville _ do not need the host Jim Nantz to
ask them individually what they think, as he had to do with Marcus
Allen, Brent Jones and George Seifert last season. And Glanville
brings an element rarely seen with more sedate studio denizens: He
squirms on a chair that seems to be delivering electric shocks to
his posterior.
</P>
<P>
   The show had a pace that was missing last year because the four
of them speak quickly and appear to genuinely like one another. But
the oddly named ``eye openers'' prediction segment dragged on and a
feature by Allen, now a field reporter, on the Jets and coach Bill
Parcells, lacked the type of insight provided in a segment of
Thursday's ``Real Sports'' on HBO.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was with the Oakland Raiders,'' Allen said, ``they told
the players, `Just win, baby.' Bill Parcells tells his players,
`Just win.''' Huh? What separates Parcells from Oakland's Al Davis
is one single ``baby''?
</P>
<P>
   The foremost Parcells interpreter is Phil Simms, CBS' top game
analyst, who was not in Allen's piece. On HBO, Simms playfully
discussed Parcells' harsh motivational tactics and said, ``I'll
never admit to it, but that fat SOB was right.''
