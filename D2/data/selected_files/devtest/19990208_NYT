INDEPENDENT COUNSEL LAW,UP FOR RENEWAL, FACES TOUGH SCRUTINY 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   The Senate has been using phrases like ``end game'' as it
prepares for a final vote this week on articles of impeachment
against President Clinton, but Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr
has made clear his game is far from over.
</P>
<P>
   As Starr presses ahead with prosecutions _ possibly including
Clinton _ Congress must decide the fate of the Independent Counsel
Act, the Watergate-era law used by Starr to investigage the
president.
</P>
<P>
   The law is in trouble, say both supporters and opponents, in
large part because of perceived overzealousness in Starr's 53-month
investigation of Clinton, an inquiry that has covered everything
from 1970s land deals to the president's sex life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ken Starr is a poster child for killing the law,'' said
Charles Lewis, head of the Center for Public Integrity in
Washington, D.C., which monitors the influence of money in
politics. ``The whole concept could go out the window with what
this nation has been through.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr has done ``great damage'' to chances the act will be
renewed when it expires in June, agreed Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich.,
who is trying to change the law.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Clinton signed a reauthorization of the Independent
Counsel Act, hailing it as ``a foundation stone for the trust
between the government and our citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton more recently has railed against Starr for ``prying into
private lives.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the act's strong backers in Congress in 1994 was Rep.
Mike Espy of Mississippi, who later became Clinton's agriculture
secretary.
</P>
<P>
   After winning acquittal on bribery charges brought by
independent counsel Donald Smaltz, Espy vowed to be the leadoff
witness in Congress against extending the law as written.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jim McDermott, D-Wash., who voted in 1994 to renew the act,
said: ``Sometimes the cure is worse than the disease. Our
experience with Mr. Starr means at minimum massive changes when the
law comes up for renewal.''
</P>
<P>
   The public clearly has turned against the independent counsel
and his tactics. National surveys show that 60 percent of Americans
believe Starr's investigation is politically motivated. A recent
CBS News/New York Times poll found Starr with a personal approval
rating of 22 percent. A few days earlier, another national survey
gave a 40 percent approval to ``Hustler'' publisher Larry Flynt.
</P>
<P>
   Public opinion seems to have come to the view given in a
much-quoted 1988 dissent by Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia to
a challenge to the act. In it the conservative judge warned about
the ``vast power and the immense discretion'' bestowed on
independent counsels.
</P>
<P>
   The ``most dangerous power'' of a special prosecutor, wrote
Scalia, is that ``he will pick people that he thinks he should get,
rather than cases that need to be prosecuted. With the law books
filled with a great assortment of crimes, a prosecutor stands a
fair chance of finding at least a technical violation of some act
on the part of almost anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Spawned by the Watergate scandal that brought down President
Nixon, the Independent Counsel Act was adopted in 1978, designed to
create a mechanism for evaluating evidence of wrongdoing by
high-level federal officials that would free prosecutors from
political interference.
</P>
<P>
   If the attorney general, a political appointee, found evidence
of wrongdoing, he or she is required to refer the matter to a
three-member panel of federal appellate judges. The judges pick the
independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   The law allows independent prosecutors to operate virtually
without supervision, with limitless resources and unlimited time to
investigate high public officials.
</P>
<P>
   In practice, the Independent Counsel Act has led to the most
costly investigations in American history. Independent Counsel
Lawrence Walsh spent $47.2 million on his probe of the Iran-Contra
scandal. Starr's investigation had cost $40.8 million through the
end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Smaltz spent more that $17 million investigating Espy for such
alleged indiscretions as accepting Super Bowl tickets and dinners.
Last year, he produced a 32-count indictment against the former
agriculture secretary. A jury acquitted Espy of all charges after a
trial in which the defense called no witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers say sweeping powers can cloud independent
counsels' judgment. Investigations are sweeping up small fry and
prosecuting ``crimes the Republic can afford ot to litigate'' said
Joshua Rosenkranz of the Brennan Center for Justice at New York
University.
</P>
<P>
   Independent Counsel David Barrett has spent three years
investigating former housing secretary Henry Cisneros for allegedly
lying to the FBI about how much money he paid a former mistress. In
addition to indicting Cisneros, Barrett has jailed the former
mistress for making false claims on a mortgage application.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have is an unlimited license with an unlimited budget
for unlimited time to rove around and dig up whatever dirt a
prosecutor can find,'' Rosenkranz said.
</P>
<P>
   Although designed specifically to remove partisanship from
investigations, politics nonetheless play a role.
</P>
<P>
   ``Views of this law change with the political season,'' noted
Kevin Hamilton, a partner at Perkins Coie, Washington state's
largest law firm.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats fervently supported independent counsels during the
Reagan-Bush years.
</P>
<P>
   An election-eve leak out of Walsh's investigation helped derail
President Bush in the 1992 campaign. Before leaving office, Bush
pardoned former defense secretary Caspar Weinberger and others
indicted by the Iran-Contra prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   The law's potential for casting suspicion, even without
indictments, was already apparent. When an independent counsel
found ``insufficient credible evidence'' to indict him, former
Labor Secretary Raymond Donovan asked a memorable question: ``What
office do I go to to get my reputation back?''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have become as aggressive in demanding appointment
of special prosecutors as Democrats were in the 12 years that
Republicans held the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Five independent counsel investigations of Clinton
administration officials are under way.
</P>
<P>
   Starr has investigated the Clintons since August 1994. Smaltz
tried and failed to convict Espy. Ralph Landcaster is investigating
an allegation that Labor Secretary Alexis Herman solicited $250,000
in illegal campaign contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Barrett has brought a perjury indictment against Cisneros. And
Carol Elder Bruce is investigating allegations that Interior
Secretary Bruce Babbitt lied to Congress over Clinton campaign
contributions and rejection of a casino proposal by a Wisconsin
Indian tribe.
</P>
<P>
   The investigations have cost an estimated $70 million, and piled
up millions of dollars in costs among those caught up in the
investigations.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have expressed outrage when, in several recent
cases, Attorney General Janet Reno rejected appointment of
independent counsels.
</P>
<P>
   Reno has found no grounds to appoint an independent counsel to
investigate Clinton's role in 1996 Democratic fund raising, or to
probe whether Vice President Al Gore lied about his role in putting
together the campaign's warchest.
</P>
<P>
   She declined last week to recommend a special prosecutor to
investigate allegations of perjury against former deputy White
House chief of staff Harold Ickes.
</P>
<P>
   That marked the ``final nail'' in the coffin of the Independent
Counsel Act, said Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn. Thompson was chairman
of a Senate panel that took Ickes' testimony denying that the
administration had done favors for the Teamsters Union.
</P>
<P>
   ``The demise of the Independent Counsel Act when it expires this
year may be the most notable achievement of her tenure,'' Thompson
said, referring to Reno.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's investigation has raised questions on three major
counts:
</P>
<P>
   _ Politicized prosecutors: Starr was named independent counsel
in 1994 by a panel headed by Judge David Sentelle of the U.S. Court
of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Sentelle is a former Republican Party official and a protege of
North Carolina Sen. Jesse Helms. Two days before Starr's
appointment, he lunched in the Senate Dining Room with Helms and
fellow North Carolina Sen. Lauch Faircloth. The men later claimed
to have talked about their prostates, not special prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever they discussed, investigation of Clinton was entrusted
to a political enemy who had already given advice to Paula Jones'
lawyers in her sexual harassment suit against the president.
</P>
<P>
   _ Expandable probes: Once appointed, Starr controlled the scope
of his investigation. Were the Justice Department to object to any
expansion of his investigation _ or that of any other special
prosecutor _ Sentelle's panel makes the final decision.
</P>
<P>
   Starr has gone far beyond his original charge of investigating a
land deal in Arkansas made while Clinton was governor. Starr was
looking into Clinton's sex life long before Linda Tripp informed
Starr's office of her taped conversations with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   _ Checks and balances: No procedures or rules have been
published dictating how an independent counsel's office should
operate. Starr has insisted his office has followed ``ordinary
prosecutorial practice.''
</P>
<P>
   But major questions have been raised about his tactics. Public
hostility toward Starr's probe has been fueled by the prolonged
imprisonment of Clinton's Whitewater business partner Susan
McDougal, the sight of Marcia Lewis _ Lewinsky's mother _ shaken
after a grand jury grilling, and explicit sexual detail in Starr's
impeachment referral to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   At the Center for Public Integrity, Charles Lewis has what he
calls ``one of the most unpopular jobs'' in Washington as he argues
for reauthorization of the Independent Counsel Act.
</P>
<P>
   ``Starr exercised abysmally poor judgment in terms of
partisanship, and giving the impression that he was a man on a
mission,'' Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I am not content to have attorney generals, appointed by
the president, decide on prosecutions at high levels of the
government. The issue is how to reform the (independent counsel)
act. If you overreform it, you render it useless. If you don't
reform it at all, you run the risk of another Ken Starr.''

   MOORPARK, Calif.: not as a malady to be cured.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't mind being short and I feel there's a purpose to being
short,'' Donna said. ``If you're going to start getting involved
with making the perfect person, to me it's not right.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bankowskis' faith that they are normal people with an
unusual condition has helped their children straddle the barriers
it poses.
</P>
<P>
   Following the path of suburban teen-agers everywhere, Zach works
at a McDonald's restaurant in the suburban Ventura County city of
Moorpark, where he was recently promoted to shift leader - a step
toward a management position.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a very hard worker,'' said his supervisor, assistant
manager Jose Zavala. ``If you ask him to do anything he'll do it.
Some people think they can't do it because of their size. He'll try
it.''
</P>
<P>
   His diligent work habits belie the difficulty of his task,
though. Zach stands atop a chair to work the drive-in window and
takes Advil to ease the back pains that come from stepping on and
off it.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the time he works the front counter, where he has to
hustle to keep pace with his longer-limbed co-workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to work twice as hard, because it takes me twice as
long,'' he said. ``I have to keep up with the other managers and I
have to improve myself every day.''
</P>
<P>
   As a preschool teacher at Children's World in Calabasas in
nearby Los Angeles County, Leann's stature -- she stands 4 feet
tall -- has been an asset and a challenge, complicating her job,
but endearing her to her 2-year-old students.
</P>
<P>
   ``They relate to the eye to eye contact. They can come up to me
and speak to me without having to always look up to me,'' she said.
``And they relate to me as a friend or a playmate. But they do know
I'm a teacher, and they do listen.''
</P>
<P>
   The changing table, waist-high to an average-sized person, is
out of Leann's reach.
</P>
<P>
   To compensate, she places a changing pad on a kid-height table
and changes the toddlers there.
</P>
<P>
   Leann's success at the center stands in contrast to a previous
disappointment. Earlier, she had phoned a Moorpark preschool
inquiring about an open position. When she arrived in person,
supervisors said the job was filled.
</P>
<P>
   Suspicious, Donna called and feigned interest in the job. She
was told the job was open. Several subsequent phone calls yielded
the same answer.
</P>
<P>
   That experience exemplifies the kind of discrimination
prohibited by the Americans with Disabilities Act, said Angela Van
Etten of West Palm Beach, Fla., an advocate for legal rights of
little people.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's almost a dream case because it's so blatant,'' Van
Etten said. &QL; 
If Leann could show that she was physically limited by her
dwarfism, but could still perform the job, she could have won a
case against the day care center, Van Etten said.
</P>
<P>
   But Leann chose to go where her skills were wanted and
appreciated. She was hired at Children's World in July.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leann worked out great,'' said Cindy Valeri, a teacher who
recommended Leann for the job. ``She was wonderful with the kids
and she could do everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Teacher Maggie Tufts said Leann's presence broadens the
students' minds.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the toddlers, they're going to grow up with people like
her. And for them that's normal.''

TIGHTLY KNIT FAMILY OF LITTLE PEOPLE THRIVES DESPITE SOCIETY'S
HURDLES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DEBORAH SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; MOORPARK, Calif. &UR;  &LR; -- &UR;  &LR; During World War II, when young women
were flocking to work in factories, Jeanne Michaels still had to
fight for a job. Even as the war brought down gender walls, there
was one she couldn't climb over - the one that kept little people
out of the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   But then supervisors at the Ford Bomber Plant near Dearborn,
Mich., found that Michaels had an ability that separated her from
most people: At 3 feet 8 inches tall, she and other dwarfs could
climb inside the wings of B-24 bombers and bolt fuel tanks in tight
spaces where other workers couldn't reach.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first they didn't want to hire the little people, but then
they found we could fit in the wings,'' said Michaels, now 80.
``When they found out what we could do, they were very glad to have
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Michaels proved her mettle half a century ago, her
daughter, son-in-law and grandchildren - all born with a congenital
form of dwarfism - are succeeding in careers in business,
computers, child care and fast food. &QL; 
Yet they still struggle with the same obstacles - social and
physical - that she overcame.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of a foot or so of height, the family leads a
typical Southern California life.
</P>
<P>
   Donna and her husband, Leroy Bankowski, each 51, are GTE
employees. Their daughter, Leann, 21, is a preschool teacher and
son Zach, 17, is a partying, beach-going teen-ager with an
after-school job at McDonald's.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge to maintain that normality requires extraordinary
patience and perseverance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a life like anybody else,'' Donna said. ``We work and
we shop and we buy clothes. The only difference is that we have to
make certain adjustments. But we have made the adjustments and we
know what we have to do.''
</P>
<P>
   World War II, with its demand for production, provided
opportunity for Michaels.
</P>
<P>
   She spent three years assembling airplanes, then when the war
ended, worked as a spark plug inspector.
</P>
<P>
   After that she moved to Chicago for a job at the Midget's Club,
a tavern run and staffed entirely by dwarfs. The owner, himself a
dwarf, installed a scaled-down bar, kitchen and even piano to fit
his short-statured staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was exciting, because it was run all by little people,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   There Michaels met her husband, a waiter at the club. Like other
women of that era, she became a homemaker when she married and bore
her first and only child, Donna.
</P>
<P>
   Donna, the child of two dwarfs in an extended family of
average-sized people, grew up at ease with both tall and short
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt that I was accepted in both worlds because of a lot of
problems my parents overcame,'' said Donna, who is 4 feet tall.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, Leroy, however, was born to a taller-than-average
family, with three brothers who towered over him at up to more than
6 feet. His bewildered parents sought to shield him from harm, but
instead kept him from experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents, probably my dad more, wanted to be protective of
me, and were afraid I'd be hurt, either physically or hurt
feeling-wise,'' he said. ``So I was more sheltered.''
</P>
<P>
   He met Donna in 1973 through Little People of America, a
national organization founded by actor Billy Barty. Bankowski is
now president.
</P>
<P>
   The couple share dwarfism, age, a Polish background and Catholic
faith. They married the following year and lived in his home in
Coeur D'Alene, Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   While Donna approached life beaming with self-confidence, she
faced some of the same workplace discrimination as her mother. In
an era of affirmative action, the prejudice was veiled in
euphemism.
</P>
<P>
   Potential employers told her she was too qualified, that she'd
grow bored or that they couldn't afford to pay the salary she
deserved. But she suspected that beneath the euphemisms was a
deeper issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``There would always be the issue,'' she said. ``But the issue
would always be that you're short.''
</P>
<P>
   Over years she persevered to become a business control
dispatcher for GTE, while Leroy worked his way up to become a
database administrator.
</P>
<P>
   When the company cut back its Coeur D'Alene operations, the
couple transferred to the company's Westlake Village office in
suburban Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   As Leroy bustled around the office during a holiday potluck,
bantering with co-workers and locating extra plates and soft drinks
for a visitor, it was easy to forget that he confronts physical
challenges in the most ordinary of tasks.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can do everything by himself,'' said his friend and
co-worker Bill Bankowski, who is not related to Leroy.
</P>
<P>
   ``But in the cafeteria the sodas are so high, the salad bar is
so high he can barely see it. But he manages. So it's amazing how
he adapts so well and makes it look effortless.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Leroy has twice required surgery to repair back and
neck injuries related to his dwarfism.
</P>
<P>
   Achondroplasia, the form of dwarfism that affects the Bankowskis
and most other little people, is characterized by shortened limbs
and small bodies and a distinctive skull shape with a prominent
forehead and small jaw, said Ravi Savarirayan, a geneticist at
Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   It results in small vertebral openings, which can cause nerve
compression in the spine, he said. But surgery is complicated in
dwarfs, whose average-sized organs are compacted into a small body.
</P>
<P>
   During his two spinal surgeries, and prostate operation, Leroy
had to seek care from specialists familiar with his condition.
</P>
<P>
   Savarirayan said genetic research could yield cures for those
conditions, and even reverse dwarfism itself.
</P>
<P>
   But the Bankowskis are uncomfortable with that prospect, saying
they view their size as part of the vast diversity of human
creation, not as a malady to be cured.

charging publishers modest fees last summer in a limited
experiment. But this year, Amazon increased the offerings to
publishers so that now $10,000 is the price tag for a premium

EX-CLIPPERS MAKE CHICAGO HOME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If Michael Jordan up and retires on you, don't get
worried. Get an ex-Clipper.
</P>
<P>
   That's what the Bulls have done, twice. The first Air apparent
was Ron Harper, who left the Clippers after the 1993 season to play
shooting (and missing) guard in Chicago while Jordan was waving at
curveballs.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls filled their backcourt opening _ the one next to the
persevering Harper _ by hiring Brent Barry, who was a Clipper a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Tough act to follow, eh?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not filling anybody's shoes but my own,'' Barry said from
the Bulls locker room before Sunday's game with his old Clippers
pals.
</P>
<P>
   When the Clippers traded soon-to-be-free-agent Barry to Miami
for soon-to-be-free-agent Ike Austin last season, it left a void in
their backcourt and highlight reel. Meanwhile, on a bench in south
Florida, Barry watched his contract expire while cooling his heels
in Pat Riley's doghouse.
</P>
<P>
   The lockout came and went. Rumors flew that the Northern
California native was supposed to be re-signed by the Heat, then
traded to the Golden State Warriors. But when the air cleared,
Barry _ a one-time winner of the NBA's slam-dunk contest _ was part
of the severe rebuilding program in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought after last season was over, I'd be going back to
Miami,'' he said. ``But I think I've found a home in Chicago.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sports Arena, which used to be home, is no more than another
office now.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just another game,'' Barry said, ``just another business
trip. Still, it feels a bit strange. I came here and worked very
hard. I thought I did everything I could to improve.''
</P>
<P>
   Now he's doing everything he can to prove he's a solid
all-around player.
</P>
<P>
   Riley openly questioned Barry's commitment to defense. On
Sunday, Clippers assistant Rex Kalamian said the former Oregon
State star has the quickness and instincts to lead the league in
steals.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least one person in the league thinks I can play defense,''
Barry said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Taylor-made injury: The right knee of Rodney Rogers bothered
the Clippers forward during training camp and kept him out of the
lineup Sunday. But teammate Maurice Taylor gets an assist.
</P>
<P>
   In Saturday's practice, Taylor was knocked off balance during a
drill and regained his balanced while banging into Rogers' knee.
The official wound is ``sprained right medial collateral
ligament.'' The bump was completely unintentional, by the way. But
Taylor was expected to start in Sunday's game against Chicago, in
place of the injured Rogers.

JACKSON RETURNS TO SEATTLE FOR SPORTS STAR TRIBUTE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RALEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ We had Keith Jackson all to ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   With his soft Georgia drawl and precise manner, he stared into a
KOMO-TV camera nightly and gave us news and sports. He was on the
radio at all hours. He entered our homes from Husky Stadium, Sicks'
Stadium, Lake Washington, even the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   For a decade, from the end of the Korean war to the start of
Vietnam, Jackson told Seattle who won and who died.
</P>
<P>
   Then he was gone.
</P>
<P>
   The networks beckoned and he would talk his way to the top of
his profession. But like a newborn, his first meaningful words were
spoken here.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, the recently retired Jackson, 70, will come full
circle to connect with his broadcasting roots, receiving the
Publisher's Award at the Post-Intelligencer's 64th Sports Star of
the Year banquet at the Sheraton Seattle Hotel &AMP; Towers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's where you started,'' he said. ``It was our first big
job.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson is known as the voice of his beloved college football, a
sport he described from every national vantage point for 31 of the
past 32 years. He covered 10 Summer and Winter Olympics, major
league baseball and the first year of Monday Night Football, all
for ABC-TV.
</P>
<P>
   But before he was everyone's household guest, before there was
Coverage You Can Count On, before there were blow dryers, Jackson
diligently provided headlines and insight from a studio at Fourth
and Denny.
</P>
<P>
   He got tough with the University of Washington. He got silly
with the weatherman.
</P>
<P>
   Part of him never left.
</P>
<P>
   On a hillside overlooking Lake Washington, his stenciled name
still adorns a rusty mailbox. Badly faded, yet visible.
</P>
<P>
   The Kenmore home has changed hands at least three times. A
garage has been added, a deck extended. Another remodel is under
way. But for 40 years, the original owner's name hasn't left the
letter box _ K.M. Jackson _ providing an unofficial landmark.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson came to the city in 1954, just as local television was
getting its legs. KOMO-TV had been on the air for less than a year
when he was hired, as a recent Washington State University grad who
had spent a few months at radio station KLER in Lewiston, Idaho.
With the move, he doubled his $82.50 per week salary. He had star
quality from the outset.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was one of the most self-assured people I've ever met in my
life,'' said Herb Robinson, Jackson's KOMO-TV co-anchor. ``He had
supreme confidence. He was a helluva find.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson regularly worked 16-hour days, chasing news and making
inroads.
</P>
<P>
   He and Robinson formed the West's first two-person TV news team.
They came on at 6:30 and 10:30 p.m., later shifting the second
newscast to 11. Jackson looked serious in his crew cut. Robinson
knew better, fighting on-air giggles as his partner made faces
off-camera.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson was the first in Seattle to banter with his weatherman.
He made the other guy do a forecast from the alley as good-natured
punishment for missing a coming snowstorm.
</P>
<P>
   To fulfill advertising commitments, Jackson smoked cigars and
drank milk on his newscasts. He was witty and hard-working, and
well-received by the viewers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won every kind of award,'' he said. ``We put Channel 4 on
the map.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson and his wife, Turi, first lived in Lake City, in a small
rambler with a big back yard on 27th Avenue Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Their next-door neighbors, Lloyd and June Hughes, still reside
there. They played badminton in Jackson's back yard, monthly games
of Scrabble inside. They had chuckhole-filling parties in the
street, shared the birth of their children.
</P>
<P>
   Life in North Seattle was simple then. It was a time for dreams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I helped him fix his fence, just to talk to him,'' Lloyd said.
``I told him I thought he would go clear to the top in
broadcasting, and I don't remember what he said back, but it was
true.''
</P>
<P>
   After five years, Jackson moved his family a few miles north, to
a new two-story home with a lake view. It was close to Inglewood
Country Club, where he would become a member with his 7 handicap.
</P>
<P>
   He was much more famous now, but it wasn't always apparent. Not
to his new next-door neighbor in the Kenmore neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first moved in, I didn't recognize him and struck up a
conversation in the back yard,'' said Bill Guy, a retired UW
bioengineering professor. ``I didn't realize he was Keith Jackson
until I saw him on television.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson wasn't always charming and unassuming. Not when his work
was threatened.
</P>
<P>
   For eight of his 10 years in Seattle, he was the voice of Husky
football. He called back-to-back Rose Bowl victories, and reveled
in the resurgence of Jim Owens' program.
</P>
<P>
   But Jackson seems most proud of battling the UW over reporter
access in 1955. He took the issue to the state Supreme Court in
Olympia, forcing the school to back down and open its doors to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The University of Washington said, `You can't come in here
with your television camera; we've sold the rights and you can't do
this,''' he recalled. ``I said, `Horse----, I'm a legitimate
newsman and, if you don't like it, throw me out,' and they did.
Guess how long that lasted.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson could be plenty tough. In 1956, the Husky athletic
program was about to be penalized for having a football slush fund,
and the UW tried to delay the bad news. Jackson was in no mood for
damage control.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sat in a hallway and (athletic director) Harvey Cassill
said, `Go away, we're not telling you anything and we're going to
get away with it,''' Jackson remembered. ``I said, `If you don't
tell us something, this is a live camera and we're going to tell
the public you won't tell us something.'''
</P>
<P>
   He earned people's respect. He was asked to broadcast Seattle
Rainiers baseball games, Seattle University basketball and the Gold
Cup hydroplane races. There was opposition to him taking the
Rainiers job; Jackson was asked to replace an ousted legend, Leo
Lassen. But he pushed ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's crowning moment came when he accompanied the UW men's
crew team to Russia. Against great odds, he did the first live
radio broadcast of a sporting event from the then-communist
country. He also taped footage with KOMO cameraman Howard Ramaley
to be shown when they returned home.
</P>
<P>
   They were hassled bringing broadcast equipment through the
Moscow airport. They were detained approaching the reservoir race
site. There were censorship tactics to sidestep. But Jackson eased
his way past each obstacle, smoothly pulling out a Seattle Police
Department press card to gain race-day entry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Later we talked to local press people and they started naming
off people, contemporaries, who had disappeared,'' Ramaley said,
``and they said, `You were lucky.'''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson ranks the groundbreaking Russian moment among his
greatest broadcasting experiences. And anyone else's.
</P>
<P>
   ``That story is as good as Mark Spitz winning seven gold medals,
or Eric Heiden and five medals, or as good as two successive Super
Bowl wins,'' he said. ``It was a glorious thing. I'll never forget
it because it told me about the fiber of society. People said, `To
hell with you,' and we did it anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson was good. But he wasn't perfect.
</P>
<P>
   One summer, co-anchors Jackson and Robinson covered the
hydroplane races. They announced the winner and signed off. KOMO
was minutes into a movie when viewers were returned dockside for a
correction.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rules of the Gold Cup were complicated and we announced
the wrong winner of the race,'' Robinson said. ``We scrambled back
on the air from the lake to get it right.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson was otherwise meticulous in his work. He did a one-hour
Husky football show and often met with Owens at 2 a.m. in the
studio to rehearse.
</P>
<P>
   He was a stickler for doing things right. Johnny O'Brien, the
former Seattle University basketball standout, teamed with Jackson
to do Chieftain broadcasts. They would review game tapes together
the day after.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's ego or emotions never got in the way. He stayed
neutral at a time when broadcasters acting as team boosters or
cheerleaders was an accepted practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he tried to get extremely close to anything
where it would affect his impartiality,'' O'Brien said. ``Now I
can't speak for Washington State.''
</P>
<P>
   In Pullman, Jackson was a Georgian farm boy fresh out of the
Marines who planned to study police and political science, maybe
become a career military man. Instead, he reversed his field,
finding his livelihood and true love.
</P>
<P>
   Unimpressed by a campus broadcast of a Pullman High football
game, Jackson brazenly told WSU professor Burt Harrison he could do
better. Harrison handed him a tape recorder, sent him to another
Pullman game and said, ``Show me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Back in those days, I got a lot of kids who came in and
thought they were the world's greatest damn sports broadcaster, and
most weren't,'' said Harrison, now 81 and living in Albion. ``The
tape came back and, my God, he was great, absolutely great.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, a self-described dreamer with no legitimate broadcast
experience, said, ``I had it in my soul all along.''
</P>
<P>
   Between broadcasts, the southerner would meet and marry Turi,
the daughter of a couple who served as clubhouse managers at the
Pullman golf course. The courtship play-by-play went like this: An
introductory conversation, movie dates and a whirlwind romance.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson started doing college football broadcasts for campus
radio station KWSC, beginning a five-decade association with the
sport. His first game was a 14-13 Cougar loss to Stanford in 1952.
He still sighs with disgust when recalling how a WSU quarterback
fumbled an extra-point snap, and that wound up making the
difference in the game.
</P>
<P>
   He recreated Cougar road games in a campus basement with Art
McDonald, a classmate who later worked with him at KOMO. They tore
wire copy _ stuff like, Smith up the middle, three yards _ and
turned out imaginative three-hour broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson impressed everyone with his style and ambition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think all of us knew Keith Jackson was going to be a
monumental success when he left school,'' said Geri McDonald, a WSU
classmate who owns a Seattle public-relations firm and is Art's
wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has become legend, but he's still Keith. He hasn't
forgotten anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor has the Northwest forgotten him.

SONICS RALLY LATE TO DOWN BLAZERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ His name rhymes with Gucci. But Moochie Norris is no
brand-name point guard.
</P>
<P>
   He is just a journeyman insomniac, which means Norris has
difficulty sleeping most nights. The 6-foot-1 Norris might have
been ripe for a nap by game time Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   And Norris might as well been sleep because for a stretch during
the Sonics' 91-88 win against Portland, he lived out a dream.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics' strongest point in two regular-season games is that
they are sufficient at point guard. Clearly, all-star Gary Payton
is in midseason form after Friday's 28-point game, with Sunday's
30-point effort.
</P>
<P>
   Norris is not quite stitched with the same fiber, but he is the
real thing.
</P>
<P>
   If for only one night, Norris squelched skeptics with an
outburst that turned the game around for the Sonics.
</P>
<P>
   Norris single-handedly erased the Sonics' 71-61 deficit at the
start of the fourth quarter. He drained three consecutive
3-pointers. And after Dale Ellis interceded the spotlight with a
3-pointer, Norris buried a fourth bomb that tied the score at
78-78.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics outscored the Trail Blazers 30-17 in the fourth
quarter. With the game knotted at 86-86 and 2:10 left in the game,
the Sonics pulled away for good.
</P>
<P>
   Payton's jumper with the shot clock running down put the Sonics
ahead 89-86. Portland lost its shooting touch down the stretch.
Then, Dale Ellis' free throws iced the win with 2.4 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   It was Norris' four-minute flare-up got the Sonics back into a
game otherwise dominated by Portland's size and athleticism. It
also gave Norris a lifetime worth of confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to do whatever it takes to win a championship or make
the playoffs,''said Norris, who poured in a career-high 12 points
in the fourth-quarter comeback.
</P>
<P>
   The postseason is still three months a way. Sunday, though,
provided Norris with the most vindication he's had in a Sonic
uniform. Although he performed well throughout training camp,
Norris has heard more about the team needing a veteran backup point
guard.
</P>
<P>
   All Norris has done is methodically dispel what are considered
his weakness. He answered the notion that he can't shoot jumpers by
canning 4-of-6 crucial field goals in 16 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it wasn't tonight, it would have been another night,''
Sonics coach Paul Westphal said. ``The little fella can play.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics' coaching staff changed the mechanics of Norris' jump
shot. He no longer jumps as he releases the ball. Instead, Norris
fires his jumpers from a flat-footed stance, only bending his knees
and following through.
</P>
<P>
   ``After I took the first one, I was like, I can learn to like
this,'' said Norris, who is getting his first real chance to play
in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   The experience will come with time.
</P>
<P>
   ``People talking about we need this and we need that, and he's
not supposed to be a backup to me,'' Payton said. ``And when he
goes out there and prove it like that, it's great to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Norris started out the game as slow as the Sonics, who trailed
49-44 at halftime. The deficit was 64-50 with 6:28 left in the
third quarter because Portland owned the paint. The Trail Blazers
scored mostly with layups and shots taken less than five feet from
the basket.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics were flat. They relied mostly on jump shots and
Payton, whose fiery play and 11-of-18 shooting kept the Sonics in
the game.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Payton was on the bench when the Sonics made their
run.
</P>
<P>
   Westphal gave his superstar a break just before the third
quarter ended. Moochie, who was sluggish in his eight minutes
before entering in the fourth quarter, received a pep talk from
Westphal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him he has got to stop playing like a wimp,'' Westphal
said. ``He has to figure he's the best guy on the floor when he's
out there. You're the point guard and you're in control. Make it
your game.''
</P>
<P>
   It is the same message Payton has been sending to Norris since
he arrived in training camp two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Norris said part of his motivation has been earning Payton's
respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try not to go anywhere and just stay on his mind,'' Norris
said. ``I want Gary to believe in me. And he's been telling me that
I belong, that I'm doing a good job. It's meant a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Norris realizes there is long road ahead, but he is steadily
making believers along the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was great to see Mooch do so well because he works so hard
in practice,'' Sonic forward Vin Baker said. ``He was saying the
other day that he wanted to have a breakout game and he certainly
helped us win tonight.''

POWER SHIFT TO PORTLAND? NO ONE TOLD SONICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The high-tension, playoff-feeling,
is-this-really-only-the-first-weekend-of-a-nutball-NBA-season game
between the Sonics and Blazers proved at least one thing:
</P>
<P>
   The combined vertical leap of the Blazers' roster does indeed
exceed the height of the Space Needle.
</P>
<P>
   Other than that, it is impossible at this particular time to
figure whether the Jacques Cousteau-deep Blazers can make good on
all that enviable talent.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night, it did not mean squat. Or Squatch.
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers' starting five of Brian Grant, Walt Williams,
Arvydas Sabonis, Isaiah Rider and Damon Stoudamire does not even
include Jimmy Jackson or Rasheed Wallace. Behind them, there is a
wave of young guns and veterans like Stacey Augmon, Greg Anthony,
John Crotty, Bonzi Wells, Kelvin Cato and Jermaine O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think in a weird season like this you need depth,'' Williams
said, thinking ahead to the 49 games left to be played in 87 days.
</P>
<P>
   For just such depth, NBA pundits have the Blazers finishing
either No. 7 in the West or as NBA champs. This would mean that the
jury is not only out on Portland, it may also be smoking some of
the stuff that once got Rider arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, judging from the first three quarters of the showdown
with the Interstate-5 rival Sonics, this is not a Pacific Division
team anybody would want to mess with.
</P>
<P>
   Stacked with talent from 1-through-14, the Blazers are almost as
flush as Bill Gates and Paul Allen.
</P>
<P>
   OK, maybe not that flush; it's just that both Microsoft
co-founders were in the house at KeyArena, where Allen, the
Seahawks and Blazers owner, looked like he was having some fun, at
least until the fourth quarter, when the Sonics soared to a 91-88
comeback win.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the Blazers have Wallace and Mighty Mouse, Rider and Grant
as testimony to aggressive drafting and signing of young guns who
could make Portland a power base again in the West.
</P>
<P>
   And, yes, the Lakers have Kobe Bryant, the Nuggest have Antonio
McDyess, the Timberwolves have Stephon Marbury, and the Nets,
Celtics and Sixers have Keith Van Horn, Antwan Walker and Allen
Iverson.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics, not to be left out of the sweepstakes to sign
big-name, high-priced talent, have Moochie Norris.
</P>
<P>
   That's right, Moochie.
</P>
<P>
   In one of nightcaps for the NBA's first prime-time Sundays of
this nutball season, the league forgot to send network TV cameras
to the game where the league's latest, greatest saving grace was
getting it done.
</P>
<P>
   The call was ``Moochie for three!'' as the little man drained
`em to his own delight and to the packed (and unapathetic) KeyArena
crowd.
</P>
<P>
   In the mind-bending vacuum created by the departure of You Know
Who, the lords of the hardcourt went to great lengths to come up
with a suitable replacement, be it Kobe or Keith or whoever.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the Blazers have sought that angle with the $81
million signing of Stoudamire _ a terrific playmaker who still
needs time to get Rider to stop trying to perform 360-degree spin
moves that result in offensive fouls or long-range bombs that waste
as many possessions as he can turn into gold.
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, despite a lack of big-name free agent deals in this
fax-and-cell-phone post-lockout signing period, the Sonics were not
to be outdone by the Blazers.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics were willing to go to great lengths, too, which
explains why most of the coaching staff took a little trip east
over Snoqualmie Pass to The Palm Springs of the Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   People, the sacred land we are talking about is Yakima. And in a
CBA game between the Sun Kings and Fort Wayne Fury, the Sonics
found their back-up point guard, Moochie, who torched the Blazers
in the first eight minutes of the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Norris hit four treys, grabbed a big rebound and fed Detlef
Schrempf on a crucial assist to lead the Sonics back from a 71-61
deficit to the victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh yeah, we took a road trip to Yakima,'' Sonic assistant
coach Dwane Casey said after Norris and Gary Payton (32 points, 6
assists) broke down the Blazers in the final quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a little scary going over the pass with (head coach)
Paul (Westphal) driving. He's from Phoenix, so I don't think he's
ever driven in snow before. But I knew Moochie's college coach and
I had seen him play. We knew he was an NBA point guard. We knew
about him.''
</P>
<P>
   Mighty Mouse vs. Moochie.
</P>
<P>
   It's not exactly an NBA ratings match-up like Gary Payton vs.
Sir Air, but the Sonics will take the advantage and run with it.
For at least one game, the Sonics showed they have the firepower to
stave off the franchise most pegged to be the NBA's up-and-comer.
</P>
<P>
   ``They got a great group of guys. They have a great team, but
I'm not around them. Those predictions are just people putting
things on them, but what does it mean?'' Payton said.
</P>
<P>
   If the NBA power shift from the Emerald City to the Rose City is
underway, someone forgot to tell the Sonics. And, more important,
they forgot to tell Moochie.

EASING TENSIONS, DISNEY GAINS O.K. TO SHOW `MULAN' IN CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Ending a de facto ban on new Walt Disney movies here,
China announced on Monday that it was allowing theatrical release
of ``Mulan,'' the cartoon feature based on a Chinese myth.
</P>
<P>
   The recent agreement to show ``Mulan'' in China marks the
apparent smoothing over of high-stakes tensions between the Walt
Disney Co., which is anxious to enter the China market in a major
way with its films and other products, and the government, which
keeps a firm grip on the movie industry.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's efforts to cultivate Chinese officials were suddenly
derailed in 1996, when Chinese officials expressed anger over
Disney backing of ``Kundun,'' a film sympathatic to the Dalai Lama.
Disney refused to back down and distributed the film directed by
Martin Scorcese.
</P>
<P>
   But Disney executives have sought to regain favor ever since,
among others things holding out the carrot of a possible Disney
theme park in China, and their success was reflected in Monday's
official announcement.
</P>
<P>
   According to the New China News Agency, ``Mulan'' will open
later this month in the port city of Tianjin, then in April in
Beijing. The announcement did not say when the movie would open in
other major cities.
</P>
<P>
   Only about ten foreign films are allowed to play commercially
here each year, as the government tries to protect the domestic
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Disney had applied to distribute ``Mulan'' in China last year,
when it opened elsewhere, but was turned down. ``The film was well
shot but importing `Mulan' is a complicated issue,'' a Chinese
official said then.
</P>
<P>
   A recent issue of China Entertainment Network News, a newsletter
published in Shanghai, said that as part of its strategy during the
last year of regaining favor in China, Disney bought the foreign
distribution rights to two Chinese feature films and hired a
Chinese performance troupe to participate in the European release
of ``Mulan.''
</P>
<P>
   The Disney chairman, Michael Eisner, visited China last October
to meet with top officials. A major topic of discussion, say people
familiar the matter, was the possibility of building a Disney theme
park in China.
</P>
<P>
   By some accounts, Disney said it preferred to locate such a park
in the relatively prosperous enclave of Hong Kong, formally part of
China. But Chinese officials said any park must be built on the
mainland. Shanghai made a strong play for the park to Eisner during
his visit.
</P>
<P>
   Disney is reportedy now actively considering locating a park in
the more prosperous, capitalist areas of southern China. If the
park were located near Hong Kong, tourists could be attracted from
there as well as the mainland. Another site under discussion is
Hainan Island, a semi-tropical tourist destination off of southern
China.

THORNTON SNAPS BRUINS OUT OF DOLDRUMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A year ago, heck, a few months ago, Joe Thornton
wouldn't have been the center on a checking line against Wayne
Gretzky.
</P>
<P>
   At the start of this season, his second in the NHL, the
19-year-old Thornton wouldn't have had the patience or experience
late in a tie game to wait out veteran Rangers goalie Mike Richter,
shift to his backhand, and bury a beauty of a shot to give his team
the victory.
</P>
<P>
   That was then, this is now. Thornton, whose education has been
chronicled daily since he was selected by the Bruins with the first
overall pick in the 1997 draft, has begun to blossom into the
player the team had hoped for. That was perfectly illustrated
Sunday when Thornton took a pass from Antti Laaksonen and scored,
rescuing the Bruins from the Rangers, 3-2, at the FleetCenter.
</P>
<P>
   It was Thornton's 10th goal of the year but the biggest of his
young career.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first victory for Boston since Jan. 18, ending the
club's winless skid at eight games (0-6-2).
</P>
<P>
   ``Antti made a good play, just chipping it by the two
defensemen,'' said Thornton. ``I came through and was lucky to beat
Richter. The two defensemen went right at Antti and just left me
wide open. I don't know if I would've made it last year or not. In
a 2-2 game like that, I think I would've stayed back. I don't think
I would've forced that play like that last year.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins jumped out to a 2-0 lead on goals by Sergei Samsonov
(No. 18) and Dmitri Khristich (No. 21). Samsonov scored on the
power play at 15:01 of the first and Khristich beat Richter at
16:27 of the second, a period in which the Rangers vastly outplayed
the Bruins as well as outshot them, 13-3.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble really started for Boston midway through the third.
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman Brian Leetch took a centering pass from Brent Fedyk
and beat goalie Byron Dafoe to pull within 2-1 at 9:36. The Rangers
tied it during a Boston power play. Defenseman Jeff Beukeboom tried
to clear the puck out and wound up with a fortuitous bounce for New
York. Bruins captain Ray Bourque put his hand up to his face, the
puck glanced off his glove, then his helmet, and Adam Graves took
off down the ice on a breakaway, tying the game at 12:21.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hit my glove first,'' said Bourque. ``I thought I had it. I
put my glove right in front of my face and kind of blinded myself.
It caught me in the side of the head and bounced right towards him.
I was praying (Dafoe) would make the save and I could get the
rebound, but he made a good shot and scored a nice goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Then came Thornton's moment in the sun.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Tim Taylor went down early in the game,'' said coach Pat
Burns, referring to Taylor getting hit in the face with the puck,
requiring him to have stitches, ``I put Joe back out there with
(P.J.) Axelsson and (Rob) DiMaio and said, `No. 99 is your guy
now.' He took the challenge, which is good.''
</P>
<P>
   Thornton knew he would have to play very responsibly with
Axelsson and DiMaio, with whom he had played before.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Timmy got hurt, I had to fill in Timmy's spot,'' said
Thornton. ``Whenever you go against Gretzky, it's a fun time. I've
never played against him so it was extra special for me. To get the
game-winner was special also.''
</P>
<P>
   Bourque said he was impressed by the poise Thornton showed
Sunday and by his overall development. As up and down as the season
has been so far, Bourque said Thornton's emergence has been very
welcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``It kind of happened bang-bang,'' said Bourque of Thornton's
goal. ``Last year he probably would've shot it from the high slot
or something like that. But he took control and made a really nice
move.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've really seen a big difference in Joe. He's been given a
bigger role. He wants to be a good player. He knows there are
certain things he has to go through and there are more he'll have
to go through. I think he's going to be a real good player for a
lot of years in this league. He's only going to get better and
better.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Against Gretzky), you saw how he just picked up his game when
he got with those two guys. I noticed it right away. It kind of
opens your eyes as to what's there and what's going to be there for
years to come.''

WHO NEEDS MJ?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Several years ago, then-Clipper Ron Harper defined
another tact-numbing defeat with a deep breath, a furtive glance
around the Sports Arena and this declaration:
</P>
<P>
   ``We stink.''
</P>
<P>
   For Harper, Sunday's return to Clippers central must have felt
like a whiff of ambrosia. After 48 minutes of basketball, he and
his Chicago Bulls teammates smelled like . . . victory, an 89-84
victory.
</P>
<P>
   To the veteran guard, there should be no place like this old
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should burn it down,'' said Harper of the vintage hoop
venue.
</P>
<P>
   Neither team generated the requisite temperature for that, but
any win will be appreciated by the three-time defending NBA champs.
Under first-year coach Tim Floyd, they were expected to tour the
league while developing an overpowering need for Michael Jordan
cologne.
</P>
<P>
   During a ripe first quarter, it might have been wise to give the
Clippers an aroma-altering blast. Their inertia on the glass
enabled the Bulls to snag 11 offensive boards and post a rebounding
margin of 20-9.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were done in by our lack of rebounding from the very outset
of the game,'' Clippers coach Chris Ford said. ``Our defense was
not that bad; it was our lack of rebounding.''
</P>
<P>
   The offense wasn't so hot, either. While the Bulls shot just 40
percent from the floor, the Clippers' percentage was a scalding 37.
Their muddled offensive flow and subsequent chilly shooting was
underscored by a dubious Clippers record of five team assists.
Right, five for the entire game.
</P>
<P>
   But Ford couldn't block out the recent memory of that dismal
rebounding.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to be more physical,'' he said. ``There's no reason
why we shouldn't be a good rebounding team; we've got size, we've
got bulk.''
</P>
<P>
   What they didn't have was power forward Rodney Rogers, who has a
bit too much bulk and a gimpy right knee. Maurice Taylor started in
his place and willed 14 points but contributed only 4 rebounds in
32 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago finished its first victory since a recent superstar
purge with a 50-37 rebounding edge. Toni Kukoc, Chicago's new
leading man, scored 22 points, had 11 assists and grabbed 9
rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a great player,'' said Clippers forward Lamond Murray,
who bagged 20 points. ``The guy's 6-11, he's out there handling the
ball; that's gonna present some problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they (Bulls) are still solid. But what killed us was
not boxing out well.''
</P>
<P>
   Those 11 offensive rebounds provided an opportunity for Kukoc to
throw in 14 first-quarter points. At the end of the period, Bulls
backup center Bill Wennington drilled the fifth 3-pointer of his
career to leave the home team in a 33-16 hole.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, Harper sliced to the hoop for two of his 20
points, giving Chicago its largest advantage of the night at 45-25.
</P>
<P>
   But playmaker Darrick Martin and rookie center Michael
Olowokandi had nine and seven points, respectively, as the Clippers
rallied to outscore the Bulls 23-20 in the second quarter.
Olowokandi finished with 12 points and six rebounds in 28 minutes.
But he didn't finish his work day until spending a few postgame
minutes pumping iron in the weight room.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys played hard,'' Ford said. ``They didn't give up.''
</P>
<P>
   And they closed to within a deuce, at 70-68, when Murray hit a
15-foot fadeaway over Kukoc with 10:24 left in the game. The Bulls
extended the lead to nine, but another Murray-over-Kukoc bucket cut
it to 82-80 with 1:50 remaining. Martin drove for a score and the
Clippers trailed 85-84 with 24 seconds to play. Harper made a free
throw with 17.2 left, but the Clippers ran out of rally juice when
Martin missed on a 3-pointer with 10 seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think we're a sorry team,'' Harper said, ``but that's
not true. We'll be all right.''

ADVICE? GIVE MORE ICE TO THORNTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; BOSTON _ It's time to play the legs off Joe Thornton. Get him
out there. Now. Every second shift. Every power play, not as the
second-line center, but as a wing on the No. 1 unit.
</P>
<P>
   Play him, play him, play him. Play him until he comes back to
the bench, oxygen-starved, rubber-legged, every muscle burning,
looking like he just took on Heartbreak Hill in Byron Dafoe's full
metal jacket.
</P>
<P>
   If the Bruins do that, they'll make the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   And if they don't do that ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey,'' said Bruins coach Pat Burns, pulling on his overcoat
after Sunday's exciting 3-2 win over the Rangers, ``right now I'll
take all suggestions.''
</P>
<P>
   No. 1 suggestion: Knock Dmitri Khristich off right wing of the
do-nothing/-nothing-doing power play (Burns: ``I don't know what it
is, but he's not firing'') and park Jumbo Joe there, with Jason
Allison in the middle and Sergei Samsonov on the wing. Watch the
back half of a penalty-kill box deal with that trio. After a minute
of that _ provided the puck isn't already in the net _ keep Allison
out there and sub in two other wings (the ones who are skating the
best that day).
</P>
<P>
   ``Allison could do that, he could play the full two minutes,''
said Burns. ``And, yeah, Joe could play the wing ... no problem.''
</P>
<P>
   And if Allison can't hack the extra 60 seconds, see if Thornton
is up to working the full advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Now halfway through his second big-league season, Thornton shows
every sign of _ and this is the most important part, folks _
wanting to be out there. I'm not saying that because of his winning
goal Sunday _ which in itself was a pretty piece of work, a nice
backhand pop off the rush _ but because of the way he is skating.
Whether he's on the puck or just simply on the ice, Thornton is now
using his legs and making the obvious connection between cerebral
matter and stepping on the gas.
</P>
<P>
   He's no longer the kid on a field trip, staring out the bus
window. He's 19, skating, and he's got game. This is why he was the
No. 1 pick in the June 1997 draft. He's gone from franchise
credentials to looking franchise-ready.
</P>
<P>
   Give him the minutes. See how he runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to play a lot,'' said Thornton. ``Every game I want to
play a lot. And I am playing more.''
</P>
<P>
   More, but not enough. He finished with 18 minutes 16 seconds on
his stat sheet Sunday. I know it's apples and oranges, but
defenseman Dave Ellett finished with 21:02. There are 12 forwards
and only six defensemen. But I want to look up each night and see
that Thornton's time on ice is equal to the likes of Ellett and Hal
Gill (21:55). I want to see him dead even with Allison (23:03).
Cheating him of minutes is cheating his growth, and possibly
cheating the chance of victory.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Taylor needed some stitch work in the first period Sunday
and Thornton had to move into his slot spot between P.J. Axelsson
and Rob DiMaio. Guess what? He thrived on it. Opposite Thornton was
Wayne Gretzky, who was once The Kid, once the unproven phenom
craving, and then devouring, the minutes handed him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ninety-nine's your guy now,'' said Burns.
</P>
<P>
   Thornton held his own against the Great One and also put an
obvious charge into his wingers. He didn't sag back, stand there,
look to reload the bus on the field trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever you go against Gretzky it's a fun time,'' said
Thornton. ``Actually, that's the first time I've ever done that.''
</P>
<P>
   If Burns &AMP; Co. buy into the Full Joe program, there are bound to
be some embarrassing moments. To play the legs off him now
undoubtedly will bring some flat-out failure(s). At a time like
this, with their fingertips barely touching that No. 8 playoff
spot, the risk will bring painful results.
</P>
<P>
   Case in point: Joe wasn't so Jumbo in Saturday's 2-2 tie in
Philadelphia. And why? He forgot to skate. For 65 minutes, he was
barely visible. Is that going to happen again? Of course. But the
bet here is, the hotter his legs are, they'll retain the heat.
Asked to skate more, he will skate more. Put in more pressure
situations, he'll turn into the go-to guy everyone was hearing and
dreaming about not even two summers ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're on him, every day we talk to him about it,'' said Burns,
referring specifically to Thornton's skating and his overall on-ice
awareness. ``We want him to skate first and then do the play.''
</P>
<P>
   The last month or so, in which the Bruins have gone an abysmal
2-8-3, has shown that the players here, playing in the line
combinations and defensive pairings in which they've played, cannot
make the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Can the Bruins go out and make big trades? No.
</P>
<P>
   Can the Bruins call up more minor leaguers and expect a rainbow
to appear over the bench? Uh-uh.
</P>
<P>
   What they can do, what they have to do, is take the parts on
hand and use them differently. The key to that _ and perhaps the
only answer _ is to make sure Thornton plays every minute over
every game that he can play.
</P>
<P>
   There is no sense in waiting any longer. He's here. He's ready.
</P>
<P>
   And so is a legion of fandom that has been waiting for something
like this for a very, very long time.

NOT A TOTAL WASHOUT FOR STEWART 
</HEADLINE>
 PRO AM-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. _ At least this year, they didn't have to
wait six months to crown a champion. And for that Payne Stewart can
be thankful.
</P>
<P>
   For the third time in four years, rain was a factor in the final
round of the AT&AMP;T National Pro Am at Pebble Beach, as play was
suspended at 9:30 Sunday morning because of standing water on the
greens and was not resumed, although tour officials waited until
2:10 p.m. before making an official announcement.
</P>
<P>
   With the forecast calling for more rain all day Monday _ storms
waiting to hit the West Coast were lined up all the way across the
Pacific to Japan _ officials decided to conclude the tournament
after 54 holes.
</P>
<P>
   Which was good news for Stewart, whose 10-under-par 69-64-73_206
through three rounds was good enough to earn him a one-shot victory
over Frank Lickliter, giving him his first win since the Shell
Houston Open in 1995 and only his second tour win since taking the
US Open in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The pro-am portion of this unique tournament format, which
allows amateur partners to participate in the final round, ended in
a three-way tie between Lickliter and Bob MacDonnell, Craig Stadler
and Glenn Frey, and Neal Lancaster and Robert Scott, at 22-under
194.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud of the way I played,'' said Stewart, who never even
teed off Sunday since play was suspended before the final three
groups could get under way. ``I'm hitting the ball well, the best I
have in years.''
</P>
<P>
   The suspension of play was disappointing for several golfers who
began playing before conditions worsened. It was particularly
maddening for defending champion Phil Mickelson, who birdied two of
his first three holes before play was stopped.
</P>
<P>
   David Duval, the world's hottest golfer who shot a 13-under
final-round 59 two weeks ago to win the Bob Hope Classic, began his
round with an eagle on the par-4 373-yard first hole, holing out an
8-iron from 135 yards to go to 5 under.
</P>
<P>
   And Lickliter, just a shot off at the start of the round, got no
opportunity to catch up. ``I don't feel cheated,'' he said. ``I
just feel disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   Bad weather has become a Pebble Beach tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, for example, Mickelson and the field were able to
play only nine holes during the first two rounds on Thursday and
Friday before an El Nino-caused storm moved in after Saturday's
third round, forcing postponement of the final round until Aug. 17.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, who picked up a check worth $504,000 for his three
rounds of work, was not apologizing for his good fortune. ``I've
been on the short end of 54,'' said Stewart, who concluded his play
by hitting a 5-iron within a foot of the cup on the 18th Saturday
that gave him a tap-in for a birdie at Spyglass, which had the most
benign conditions of three courses used for the first three rounds.
``It evens itself out.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart was referring to the rain-shortened 1986 tournament in
which Fuzzy Zoeller was declared a winner after three rounds when
rain washed out Friday's second round and Monday's fourth, giving
Zoeller a five-shot win over Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the mystique of Pebble Beach is the weather, which can
humble even the greatest golfers. Saturday, for example, with a
steady rain in the afternoon accompanied by 40-m.p.h. hour winds,
the average score was 79.3, with not one golfer able to break par
72.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart said he wanted to win a four-round tournament, but he
also understood the circumstances. ``I know it's not tainted. You
come here, you know the possibility exists the weather is liable to
be bad, so you have to go out and score early.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the lack of a real downpour, it became clear that the
greens rapidly were becoming unplayable. Duval, who played only one
hole, knew what to expect. ``He came back in and said, `We're not
going out there again,''' said Stewart, who was 20 minutes away
from his tee time when play was suspended. For Stewart, it's a
starting point for a season that he hopes includes a trip to The
Country Club in Brookline in September as a member of the Ryder Cup
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to win again,'' said Stewart. ``And I want to be on the
Ryder Cup team because I'm tired of losing. The last two times, I
wasn't on the team and we didn't win. So I need to get on the team.
I've got a lot of enthusiasm and when I play the Ryder Cup, it
shows. I can bring that back to the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's results didn't hurt those chances.

MORE MEDALS FOR AUSTRIA 
</HEADLINE>
 ALPINE-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY CHAMBERLAIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   VAIL, Colo. _ The headline on a Viennese newspaper story Sunday
read: ``Where's the competition?'' in reference to Austria's
dominance of the World Alpine Championships.
</P>
<P>
   It appeared after Hermann Maier's devastating run down the
fearsome Birds of Prey downhill course Saturday, which boosted
Austria's medal count to seven of 12. Maier also tied for gold in
the Super-G last week.
</P>
<P>
   So what will Monday's headline read?
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, Austrian women downhillers bettered the men by winning
the top four spots in the race, wiping out any hope of the Germans
and French. Medal count after the event: 10 of 15.
</P>
<P>
   Renate Goetschl, a 27-year-old who was favored to win, came
through with flying (red and white) colors, taking the lead from
two teammates who were waiting anxiously in the finish area.
</P>
<P>
   Michaela Dorfmeister took the silver, nipping Stefanie Schuster
by 17/100ths of a second.
</P>
<P>
   The best United States finish came from Alaska's Megan Gerety,
who placed eighth. Despite her Top 10 finish, Gerety said, ``I'm
really disappointed. I was hoping for a podium finish, or at least
a top six. I skied great over the top of the course, but then lost
some time lower when I made a couple of mistakes in the jumps.''
</P>
<P>
   A boisterous crowd estimated at 20,000 packed the finish stadium
and snowshoed up along the high-speed race course down the
International Trail. From the oompah band and the clanking of
dozens of cowbells every time an Austrian kicked out of the start,
it was clear that country brought its own fan contingent.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to understand,'' said Goetschl, ``ski racing in
Austria is like basketball or football here. It is the No. 1 sport.
We have great support.''
</P>
<P>
   Starting in second position, Schuster, a 29-year-old veteran who
skied in the '89 Vail Worlds, held a lead while several big guns
took shots at her time. But the top Norwegians, Swiss, and Germans
kept missing the mark, particularly on the lower technical part of
the course, and nobody threatened until Dorfmeister. Running 18th,
the Olympic silver medalist nipped Schuster's time by 15/100ths of
a second, and both watched as Goetschl kicked out of the start.
</P>
<P>
   Already having won two silver medals here this week, Goetschl
was nearly perfect over the flats on top, and charged through the
technical part, reminiscent of Maier's hard-charging, high-risk
style.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal was just to win a medal,'' said Goetschl. ``But this
is just unbelievable. This has been just an unbelievable week for
me. I stood in the start and said I was going to fight really hard.
I skied well and made no mistakes. We three Austrians had really
good stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Why the Austrians are so dominant is the talk of these
``off-year Olympics.'' Heavy government support and a large
organization are two reasons, say Austrian coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Also, we are competitive with one another,'' said Dorfmeister.
``We support each other a great deal, but when we are racing for
points, we ski for a result.''
</P>
<P>
   Kirsten Clark, from Raymond, Maine, finished 16th. While this
year has been disappointing so far, Clark said her finish ``gives
me a boost of confidence for the rest of the season.'' The next US
finisher was Jonna Mendes in 25th.
</P>
<P>
   But as the oompah band pumped away and the Austrians basked on
the podium in the Colorado sunshine, it was clear that the US _ and
all the other teams _ have a long way to go before ``Where's the
competition?'' has an answer.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, the greatest rivalry is cross-gender. ``Today I
heard the boys say that the women won three medals,'' said
Schuster. ``So they say, `We will have to be stronger to stay with
them.'''
</P>
<P>
   Monday, the men's downhill combined runs on the Birds of Prey
course.

UMASS WIN LACKS LUSTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMHERST, Mass. _ What do you get when you cross two Atlantic 10
teams with a combined record of 18-24, both mired in a season-long
struggle for consistency?
</P>
<P>
   Picture a rocky horror show.
</P>
<P>
   Or consider the view of St. Joseph's coach Phil Martelli, whose
Hawks lost to the University of Massachusetts, 59-58, Sunday
despite the fact that UMass shot a season-worst 36 percent from the
floor, and 44 percent from the line in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``A game that ugly will send people to watching the impeachment
trial again,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It was a contest typical of how both teams have fared this
season, which meant a soporific crowd of 6,255 witnessed solid
pressure defense and an occasional clutch play, but, for the most
part, poor shooting from lackluster offenses. There were 13 ties
and 13 lead changes _ numbers that usually reflect a pulsating
affair _ with neither team leading by more than 6 points.
</P>
<P>
   The game's best drama came on the last two possessions, when
UMass (10-12, 6-4) separated itself from its counterpart just
enough for victory. Junior guard Monty Mack (18 points) hit a
driving bank shot with 13 seconds left for the game's final points,
then Chris Kirkland (8 points, 2 blocks) rejected an attempt by St.
Joseph's forward Andre Howard as time expired.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we all started scrambling, Ajmal (Basit) went over to
the guy taking the shot, and I just went over and helped him,''
said Kirkland, who also sank two free throws with 51.1 seconds left
to help UMass to its first sweep of an opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you shoot 36 percent from the floor and 58 percent
from the line and win, what can you say?'' said UMass coach Bruiser
Flint. The third-year coach improved his career record to 50-37,
tying Jack Leaman as the second-fastest coach in school history to
reach 50 wins (behind Matt Zunic, 1959-62).
</P>
<P>
   The victory also tied UMass with Rhode Island for second place
in the Atlantic 10 East Division with six league games each to
play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, we're still in second place,'' said Flint. ``We still
have a chance. I keep telling the players, `What do we have to
lose?' We have everything to gain at this point if some guys just
come out and do their jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Damian Reid had 17 points to lead St. Joseph's (9-13, 3-7),
which shot 35 percent from the floor, 44 percent from the line in
the first half, and had 14 turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Hawks' sixth consecutive defeat, and another close
call at the Mullins Center that ended in a loss. Martelli was among
several in the Hawks camp who insisted that Howard was fouled on
the final play. ``He got fouled. There was a foul and no call,''
said Martelli, whose team lost to UMass in overtime last season and
during the 1995-96 season.
</P>
<P>
   UMass players denied there was a foul, but Flint wasn't so quick
to second that motion. ``There might have been, but hey, don't you
think it was about time I got a call in my own house?'' said Flint,
who was whistled with a controversial technical foul for being out
of the coaches' box last week against Fordham.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the game's ugliness, Flint was pleased with the win
considering that the Minutemen are banged up. Starting senior guard
Charlton Clarke (7 points, 3 assists, 2 steals) has opted to play
the rest of the season after an X-ray on his right foot Friday
showed a stress fracture in his fourth metatarsal.
</P>
<P>
   Clarke's options were to sit out two weeks and come back at the
end of the month or play with the pain and sit out practices. He
chose the latter despite being told by physicians he might incur
further damage. ``It's going to bother me now because the game is
over,'' said Clarke. ``During the game I didn't feel it _ or I
acted like I didn't feel it.''

NEW BALANCE MEET PROVES EVENTFUL 
</HEADLINE>
 BALANCE TRACK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA HUEBNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Woman No. 1, the one with her heart set on breaking the
American indoor record for 3,000 meters, didn't get to so much as
try. Woman No. 2, the one who broke the US pole vault record Friday
night, broke it again. Woman No. 3, the one who chopped off her
signature ponytail when she turned 30 recently, won the 800 meters
in what might be an American record but, then again, it might not.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and the men's 60 meters was the fastest ever run in the US,
while the hometown hero in the 400 fell and didn't finish.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing quite like a track meet, and the 1,800 or so
fans who rocked the Reggie Lewis Track and Athletic Center for
Sunday's fourth annual New Balance Invitational got a chance to
experience firsthand the sport in all its glorious quirkiness.
</P>
<P>
   First, the men's 60 meters, which Maurice Greene blistered in
6.45 seconds despite the race being called back twice by false
starts. ``I'm kind of glad,'' said Greene, who last year set the
world record of 6.39, ``because the first time I wasn't reacting
well. It kind of woke me up.''
</P>
<P>
   Greene, the reigning world champion at 100 meters, ran 6.51
Friday night in winning at the Millrose Games in Madison Square
Garden after a bad start. ``I believe if I run my race, the record
will come, but it's still early in the season,'' he said after a
giddy victory lap. Vincent Henderson ran 6.67 for second.
</P>
<P>
   In the men's 400, the spotlight was on Calvin Davis, the
Dorchester native who won a bronze medal in the 1996 Olympics as a
newcomer to the 400-meter hurdles. Sunday, while rounding the first
turn midway through the 400 flat, he fell after being jostled,
rolling into the infield and out of the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Indoors, contact's bound to happen,'' said Davis, back in
Boston from Columbia, S.C., to compete in front of family and
friends. ``But that was really rough.''
</P>
<P>
   Woman No. 1 is Regina Jacobs, who won the mile Friday night at
the Millrose Games in 4 minutes 31 seconds and had planned an
assault on the US mark at 3,000 meters here until she woke up with
a temperature of 101 degrees, a victim of the flu.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really disappointing,'' said Jacobs, who appeared
briefly to apologize to the spectators after being forbidden from
running by her coach and husband, Tom Craig, on doctor's advice.
``After racing the other night in New York, I knew the record was
gone. It was going to be broken, and it was going to be fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs wasn't the only competitor in the 3,000 to turn up ill,
so the race was canceled.
</P>
<P>
   After her winning jump of 14 feet 8 3/4 inches at Millrose broke
Stacy Dragila's US record by a half inch, Woman No. 2, Melissa
Mueller of Phoenix, bettered herself Sunday when she vaulted 14-9.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew it was coming and that I was going to do it pretty
soon,'' said the 26-year-old Mueller, who while attending the
University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh was the Division 3 national
champion at both the hurdles and high jump. Three years ago, she
switched to the pole vault, a relatively new event for women.
</P>
<P>
   There was nothing new about the women's 800 record of 1:58.9,
set by Mary Slaney in 1980. And therein lies a mystery to Suzy
Hamilton's victory Sunday, in which Woman No. 3 ran on the shoulder
of Harvard graduate Meredith Rainey Valmon until the last lap,
overtaking her on the turn coming out of the backstretch to triumph
in 1:58.92. Because Slaney's race 19 years ago was hand-timed, a
method much less sensitive than today's electronic devices,
Hamilton's time will be submitted to USA Track &AMP; Field for their
review as the American record.

FROGS Like many other researchers, Michael Zasloff made his
discovery as a fortuitous accident. He was doing genetic research
on frogs when he noticed that after he operated on them in a
non-sterile environment, the wounds never became infected. Guessing
that something in their skin was protecting them from bacterial
attack, he discovered a peptide, which he named magainin. He
proceded to find peptide antibiotics in a host of other animals.
Zasloff is turning these peptides into antibiotic drugs for humans
in the hope of providing an alternative or an adjunct to existing
drugs. Clinical trials are now taking place. By Josie Glausiusz.

DEBATE RELIGION AND SCIENCE ONLY IF IT'S FOR A PRIZE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL TAMMEUS  
 c. 1999 KANSAS CITY STAR 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You can, if you want, make the argument that science has brought
us the possibility of nuclear destruction. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, you can make the argument that religion has brought
us such horrors as ethnic cleansing. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I'm not saying I would make those arguments, though I might. In
fact, I prefer not to tell you what I would say about those matters
in case I decide to compete against you in this year's Great
American Think-Off, which will focus on this question: ``Which Is
More Dangerous: Science or Religion?'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The GATO, as I like to call it, is a slick national philosophy
contest that results in a debate held in New York Mills, Minn.,
which claims a population of 972. Each year the GATO invites
ordinary people (what it likes to call ``thinking citizens'') to
write 750-word essays about the selected topic. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although the contest has been around for several years, I have
yet to enter it. I have not wanted to take advantage of my
profession as a columnist who strings together veritable necklaces
of lovely words every day. Well, it's either that or my fear that
my traditional approach to these weighty subjects _ an approach
that includes rambling around through one digression after another
_ would not find favor among the muckety-muck judges of the GATO. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This year, however, I'm tempted. Science and religion, after
all, are two of my favorite subjects. My stock of opinions about
them has gotten so crowdy _ despite my shoveling them into public
print with regularity _ that I may never get them all out if I
don't take advantage of opportunities like this. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I don't tell you that to scare you away from entering. But I do
want you to be aware that if I leap into the contest this year you
will be hard pressed to come up a winner. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Still, if you want to try, here is what you need to know: Essays
must be postmarked by April 5. Send them to Think-Off '99, Box 246,
New York Mills, Minn., 56567. Or e-mail them to
nymills(at)uslink.net, though not as an attachment. (Or go to
www.kulcher.org.) If you are one of the four finalists you will get
a free trip to New York Mills for the June 12 debate. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   June 12? I know what you're thinking. That's when the Buzzard
Days Festival takes place in Glendive, Mont. Yes, and it will also
be George Bush's 75th birthday. But you've simply got to make
choices. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The rules also say that essays ``should be based on personal
experience and observations rather than on philosophical
technicalities.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I'd like to help you out here and explain what is meant by
philosophical technicalities, but I'm pretty sure I would not know
a philosophical technicality if it faxed itself to me. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This is because it's been 36 years since I took a philosophy
course in college and about all I remember is that the late Plato
and the late Aristotle were Greeks. Unless I'm thinking of the late
Spiro T. Agnew, which I might be, even though I've made it a point
to try to think about the late Spiro T. Agnew as little as
possible. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So when if you inadvertently include some philosophical
technicalities in your essay and they disqualify you, don't blame
me. I've given you enough warning for you to have time to search
for the term on the Web. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You may, like me, feel some reluctance about entering because
you'll have to criticize either science or religion and, like me,
you have a soft spot in your head (and maybe your heart) for both
of them. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Well, get over it. No one's going to hold your judgments against
you in the end. Uh, except maybe God. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>

</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Feb. 14)  
(lb) 
 By SCOTT VEALE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA &LR;  By Arthur Golden. Vintage Contemporaries,
$14. This first novel is an audacious ventriloquist act, assuming
the voice of a Japanese woman born in the 1920s who recalls her
metamorphosis from ugly duckling to luminous geisha and kept
mistress. In 1997 the New York Times reviewer John David Morley
found the heroine flatly drawn but said the period details and
``colorful nuggets of information ... serve to enrich'' the book.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; M.F.K. FISHER. A LIFE IN LETTERS: CORRESPONDENCE, 1929-1991 &LR; 
Selected and compiled by Norah K. Barr, Marsha Moran and Patrick
Moran. Counterpoint, $21. The celebrated food writer had a lifelong
addiction to correspondence and is said to have treated letter
writing as a warm-up exercise each morning. This sampling displays
her finely controlled siren voice and reveals the continuing
struggle between the woman and the writer, while artfully
concealing the intimate details of her life. ``It is a special
pleasure to open a book of nearly 500 pages and hear on each one of
them the distinctive, quirky, personable, contradictory and
altogether artful Fisher voice,'' Betty Fussell wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE MAGICIAN'S WIFE &LR;  By Brian Moore. Plume, $12.95. When a
famous French illusionist is sent by Napoleon III on a political
mission to work his magic in North Africa, his wife goes native,
shedding her bourgeois inhibitions and taking up the Muslim cause.
The novelist, who died last month at the age of 77, pulls off ``one
of his neatest tricks yet,'' Thomas Mallon wrote in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE SLAVE TRADE: THE STORY OF THE ATLANTIC SLAVE TRADE,
1440-1870 &LR;  By Hugh Thomas. Touchstone/Simon &AMP; Schuster, $20.
Sidestepping the moral outrage that characterizes so many other
books on the topic, the author explores the development of the
slave trade as a business and the many (often complex) characters
involved in the commerce until its demise in the 19th century. In
1997, John Thornton called this ``a fine narrative history, long on
detail and striking anecdote.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; AFRICA IN CHAOS &LR;  By George B.N. Ayittey. St. Martin's Griffin,
$18.95. This book focuses on the continent in the postcolonial
years, finding fault with those African and Western liberals who
blame imperialist legacies alone for problems often rooted in
incompetent leadership and home-grown corruption. The result is a
``robust, provocative'' book, Jeremy Harding wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; INTO THE HOUSE OF THE ANCESTORS: INSIDE THE NEW AFRICA &LR;  By Karl
Maier. Wiley, $14.95. This is a more optimistic look at
contemporary Africa and its diverse peoples, who the author
maintains are bound together by their struggle to build a workable
future. ``He introduces the reader to his subject through a rich
variety of Africans, from computer scientists and doctors to
guerrilla fighters and traditional healers,'' Howard W. French said
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NOBODY'S GIRL &LR;  By Antonya Nelson. Scribner, $12. After the
death of her mother, this novel's 30-ish heroine sends herself into
exile in rural New Mexico, where she falls for a 17-year-old
student in one of her high school classes. Last year the reviewer
Suzanne Ruta said the author ``wraps her tart, surprising sentences
around a slew of trends and shibboleths.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PERDIDO &LR;  By Rick Collignon. Bard/Avon, $10. This takes place in
another dusty corner of New Mexico, where an Anglo construction
worker in the village of Guadalupe finds his sense of belonging
threatened when he starts asking questions about the mysterious
hanging death of a girl. In 1998 Denise Gess called this ``a novel
that captivates and surprises all the way to its chilling end.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PRIDE &LR;  By Lorene Cary. Anchor/Doubleday, $12.95. This story of
the enduring friendship of four middle-class black women is both a
morality tale about the dangers of compromise and a strong argument
that women are just as likely as men to suffer midlife crises. Last
year the reviewer Michael Rovner praised the novel's ``subtle,
idiosyncratic characters.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; W.B. YEATS: A LIFE VOLUME 1: THE APPRENTICE MAGE, 1865-1914 &LR;  By
R.F. Foster. Oxford University, $26.50. The first of two planned
volumes follows William Butler Yeats through his ``Celtic
Twilight'' years to his emergence as a fully formed modern poet.
``The biographer is himself a fine writer, bearing with grace his
knowledge of Irish history, and writing with wit, authority and ...
eloquence,'' Thomas Flanagan wrote in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MY SISTER LIFE: THE STORY OF MY SISTER'S DISAPPEARANCE &LR;  By
Maria Flook. Broadway, $13. The author was 12 when her teen-age
sister, Karen, a ``problem'' child with a history of truancy, drug
abuse and promiscuity, ran away from their home in suburban
Delaware for two years. This memoir ``traces the trajectory of
Karen's disappearance and the fallout of her actions on Maria,''
Courtney Weaver wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; UNDER THE SNOW &LR;  By Kerstin Ekman. Picador USA, $12. This
Swedish mystery, originally published in 1961, revolves around an
eccentric artist and a policeman who team up to solve the murder of
a teacher in a remote village. ``The novel's plot is nicely
convoluted ... with plenty of satisfying revelations and a deft
solution,'' Margot Livesey wrote last year.

for Sunday, Feb. 7, moved Saturday and are repeated Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Scheduled for the dress page:
</P>
<P>
   JORDAN-HISTORY-REVIEW (Undated) _ The ruling dynasty of the
Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan stretches back through the mists of
time to ... May 25, 1946. Of all the artificial Middle Eastern
countries arbitrarily created by the Western powers after World War
I, none was more artificial than the tiny, poor, lawless leftover
patch of desert that would become Jordan. By John Kifner. (`i'
category). WITH GRAPHIC.
</P>
<P>
   DRAFT-REVIVAL-REVIEW (Washington) _ A quarter century after the
last conscripts mustered at boot camp, the idea of reviving the
draft has gained new currency among a small lot of academics,
lawmakers and, even, military commanders. They argue that a
restoration of the draft _ perhaps as part of some compulsory
national service _ would not only answer the personnel crises
facing today's volunteer forces but also provide a much-needed
curative to the military's growing detachment from society. By
Steven Lee Myers. (`a' category)
</P>
<P>
   _ Inside the section, moving in the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   EX-SPIES-REVIEW (Undated) _ Hundreds of former CIA and KGB
agents are working together as business partners to provide
sensitive information to American corporations. These out-of-work
spies from the U.S. and Russia are joining hands in the pursuit of
capitalism, providing protection, intelligence and political risk
assessments to U.S. companies extending their reach to emerging
markets and other global hot spots. By Leslie Wayne.
</P>
<P>
   GLOBAL-LENDING-REVIEW (Undated) _ Ever since the global
financial crisis began in East Asia 19 months ago, the public
debate has focused on how to keep poor countries from borrowing too
much money. Now, though, economists and policy-makers have been
struck by a new insight: whenever somebody is borrowing too much,
somebody else is lending too much. So begins a new debate about how
best to restrain the lenders who got the countries into trouble in
the first place. By Louis Uchitelle.
</P>
<P>
   _ Inside the section, moving in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   INTERNS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Monica Lewinsky is not the first
bright-eyed intern dealt a rude awakening by the realities of
office sex, intrigue, power politics or just plain bad workplace
behavior. A look at the experiences of journalism students sent as
interns into the world of newspapers, TV and radio.
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-ENGLAND-REVIEW (London) _ In 1386, Michael de la Pole,
Earl of Suffolk, became the first person in history to be
impeached. His case also marked the first appearance of the phrase
`high crimes and misdemeanors.' And thus began a long and tangled
process of legal challenge to executive authority by a legislative
body that, somewhat circuitously, brought Bill Clinton to trial in
the U.S. Senate. By Alan Cowell.
</P>
<P>
   HOMELESS-DEPRESSION-REVIEW (New York) _ Depression and
manic-depression, with its wild mood swings, are becoming
recognized as a significant cause of homelessness. Shelters have
long been filled with schizophrenics, people whose hallucinations
and delusions force them out of jobs, homes and relationships. But
the link between depression and homelessness is only now becoming
clear. By Lynette Holloway.
</P>
<P>
   SOCSEC-STOCKS-REVIEW (Washington) _ What would happen if the
government were investing hundreds of billions of dollars of Social
Security reserves in the stock market, and congressional
anti-abortion forces decided that none of this money should be put
into companies that make or import abortion pills? That is the kind
of nightmare foreseen by economists and politicians who oppose
President Clinton's plan to beef up Social Security reserves by
investing some of the money in stocks. Political tampering, Alan
Greenspan said, could endanger `the efficiency of our capital
markets and thus our economy.' By David E. Rosenbaum. WITH GRAPHIC.
</P>
<P>
   CENSUS-REDISTRICT-REVIEW (Undated) _ A look at the political
implications of dueling census methods. The Supreme Court ruled out
using a method of counting called statistical sampling in doling
out the 435 House seats among the states in 2001. This kind of
sampling, which is used by pollsters and advocated by the Clinton
administration, would help account for the disproportionately large
number of blacks, Hispanics, immigrants, poor people and city
dwellers who have been overlooked by census-takers. By James Dao.
</P>
<P>
   TIGER-TROUBLE-REVIEW (Undated) _ Here's the high-concept movie
pitch: Escaped Man-Eating Tiger Terrorizes Smalltown U.S.A. Drama
abounds in heart-pounding tale of a suburb suddenly forced to
resolve cultural conflicts in face of primordial threat: a
marauding (actually, it was wandering, but let's invoke dramatic
license) tiger. It's a true story, one that began spinning out late
last month amid the dizzying glare of the New York media. By Joe
Sharkey.

   Here's the high-concept MOVIE PITCH: Escaped Man-Eating Tiger
Terrorizes Smalltown U.S.A.
</P>
<P>
   Drama abounds in heart-pounding tale of a suburb suddenly forced
to resolve cultural conflicts in face of primordial threat: a
marauding (actually, it was wandering, but let's invoke dramatic
license) tiger. Characters include TOM BROWN JR., wily
wilderness-skills instructor, environmental writer and backwoods
tracker, and JOAN BYRON-MARASEK, cat-lover extraordinaire known to
older locals as ``the Tiger Lady.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a true story, one that began spinning out late last month
amid the dizzying glare of the New York City media. It features
television HELICOPTERS clattering over the treetops; TERRIFIED
NEIGHBORS herding CHILDREN indoors; CLAMORING REPORTERS, COPS,
BACKWOODS SURVIVALISTS, and, naturally, LAWYERS. Not to mention the
symbolic center of the tale: BENGAL TIGER, hunted down on Jan. 27
after appearing near some new homes, shot by police as darkness
fell, limping into the woods to die.
</P>
<P>
   The SCENE: picturesque, woodsy Jackson Township, N.J., a rapidly
suburbanizing municipality 40 miles from New York in the northern
periphery of the state's vast Pine Barrens forest. The town is in
the throes of a culture clash, with new residents tucking $250,000
houses deep into the woods, imposing suburbia on crusty Pineys (as
some locals call themselves) who are struggling to maintain an
individualistic way of life that, for example, allowed MS.
BYRON-MARASEK to keep about two-dozen full-grown tigers and 40 dogs
on her 12 fenced acres without attracting a lot of commotion.
</P>
<P>
   The STORY THUS FAR: After the tiger was killed, trackers
followed the beast's path to collect prints and forensic evidence,
as Brown described it, to determine where it came from. ``The poor
thing did not act as a tiger; it acted like a lost beagle,'' said
Brown, who operates Tracker Inc., a company that conducts
wilderness and survival training courses.
</P>
<P>
   Officials believe the tiger escaped from Ms. Byron-Marasek's
place, which is registered as a charity called Tigers Only
Preservation Society. She isn't talking, but through her lawyer has
denied that the tiger was hers, casting herself as a dedicated
animal-welfare activist. Various state and federal agencies
regulate the private keeping of exotic animals like tigers and
lions, but wildlife experts say monitoring is haphazard.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the state had issued Ms. Byron-Marasek permits
to operate a haven where she cared for 23 tigers acquired from
unknown sources. Late last week, saying the site had deteriorated
significantly since it was last inspected 13 years ago, the state
ordered her to make immediate improvements in safety fencing and
other conditions or lose her tiger permits.
</P>
<P>
   (In a SUBPLOT, astonished Jackson Township residents learned
after the shooting that their 100-square-mile municipality was
actually home to as many as 30 tigers, giving it the distinction of
having one of the greatest concentrations of tigers on Earth _
higher even than the most dense tiger populations in their natural
habitats in Asia. For besides the 23 registered to Ms.
Byron-Marasek, another 9 tigers reside at the nearby Six Flags
Great Adventure amusement park, which insists that all of its
tigers are accounted for.)
</P>
<P>
   The town is torn. A roadside memorial to the slain tiger has
been erected. Yellow ribbons flutter from pine trees. Animal rights
activists have set up a defense fund for Ms. Byron-Marasek.
</P>
<P>
   THE MORAL: ``Basically, tigers are huge predators,'' said David
Phemister, the conservation programs coordinator for the National
Fish and Wildlife Foundation, which manages the international Save
the Tiger Fund. ``Keeping them as pets, even in a situation where
you're performing an animal welfare or rescue operation, is
something that almost inevitably doesn't work out. And it seems to
me personally that an escaped tiger roaming through suburban New
Jersey is the epitome of things not working out.''
</P>
<P>
   About 8,000 tigers now live in the wild, down from over 100,000
at the start of this century, according to Save the Tiger Fund.
Another 1,000 tigers are held worldwide in zoos, conservation
parks, circuses and the like, according to the American Zoo and
Aquarium Association.
</P>
<P>
   But as the Jackson Township tiger hunt showed, no one really can
say how many tigers are living where you'd least expect to find
them. A 1997 National Geographic article pictured an Arkansas woman
who keeps 52 of the big cats at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``There could be more tigers in private hands in the United
States than there are wild tigers in India,'' said Phemister.
``How's that for a depressing thought?''
</P>
<P>
   FADE OUT.

TWO (MANY) CHOICES FOR 2000 CENSUS
</HEADLINE>
 
 (Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With just a few words, the Supreme Court has made
what's been called ``the purest of all political bloodsports''
potentially bloodier. Officially, the sport is called redistricting
_ the drawing of political boundaries. But because elected
officials might lose their seats, it is known better as incumbent
protection.
</P>
<P>
   The next round of redistricting will rely on census data
gathered next year. But in a 5-4 decision in January, the court
ruled out using a method of counting called statistical sampling in
doling out the 435 House seats among the states in 2001. This kind
of sampling, which is used by pollsters and advocated by the
Clinton administration, would help account for the
disproportionately large number of blacks, Hispanics, immigrants,
poor people and city dwellers who have been overlooked by
census-takers. Instead the court said federal law requires that the
traditional method be used for distributing the House seats.
</P>
<P>
   But the court did not rule out sampling entirely. The justices
left the door open for the states to use it to apportion their own
legislatures and to draw congressional district boundaries within
each state. The Census Bureau now plans to release two sets of
numbers. The Republicans have vowed to fight the release of any
data adjusted by sampling, saying the figures can be manipulated
for political purposes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Redistricting is already the purest of all political blood
sports,'' said Tim Storey, a redistricting expert with the National
Conference of State Legislatures. ``The court's ruling just
provides another layer of uncertainty on top of all the others.''
</P>
<P>
   The legislatures or commissions that draw the district lines
within each state are already burdened by complex and sometimes
contradictory laws, court rulings and political pressures: federal
law requires that ethnic minorities' voting strength not be
diluted; incumbents expect to be protected, and neighborhoods want
to remain intact.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Clinton administration is proposing to give the states
a choice of using either the traditional count (which in addition
to the door-to-door effort includes mailed forms and other means)
or the adjusted version based on sampling. Many legislators are
saying they prefer no choice at all.
</P>
<P>
   In large states like Illinois, New York, Ohio, Texas and
California, the fighting has already begun. Democrats are pushing
to use sampling and Republicans are vowing to fight it. Losers can
be expected to take winners to court. And divided legislatures are
likely to deadlock over the issue, which would leave the map
drawing to judges. ``No matter what legislatures do, there will be
a race to the court house,'' said Storey.
</P>
<P>
   The 1990 census said it missed 8.4 million people. In cities
like Chicago, Los Angeles and New York City, where the Census
Bureau determined _ using sampling _ that Hispanic and Asian groups
were undercounted in the 1990 census, sampling could be a boon to
Democrats, probably at the expense of white Republican suburbs.
Experts say that sampling in New York City could help create two
new Democratic Assembly seats and one Democratic state Senate seat.
It could also cause two marginally Republican Senate districts to
become marginally Democratic, and prevent the city's loss of a
congressional seat to the suburbs. (The state itself is projected
to lose two congressional seats in 2000.)
</P>
<P>
   In California, sampling could add one or more legislative and
congressional seats to Democratic-leaning Hispanic neighborhoods in
Los Angeles and possibly San Diego, experts said. And in states
where Republicans hold narrow majorities _ the Texas Senate and the
Houses in the Pennsylvania and Illinois Legislatures _ sampling
might even help Democrats recapture majorities. ``An adjusted
census could provide Democrats the crucial edge needed to prevail
in close contests to control several state legislative chambers,''
warned Republican National Committee chairman Jim Nicholson in a
1997 memo.
</P>
<P>
   Many political scientists and demographers discount such dire
predictions. Elections, they say, turn more on voter turnout and
other factors than redistricting. They also say creative Republican
line drawers can probably blunt the worst effects of sampling.
</P>
<P>
   Some redistricting experts say the fight over sampling could
also set off feuding among Democrats. White Democrats might oppose
using sampling data lest it would draw districts that favor
minority candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Connor, a Brooklyn Democrat who is the New York state
Senate minority leader, said that if an adjusted count had been
used for redistricting in 1991, it would have enabled the Democrats
to win control of the Senate. But it might also cause his district
to be so thoroughly redrawn he could not be re-elected, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Connor, who is white, said he wants to take his chances on
sampling in 2000. ``If I get thrown out of office, so what,'' he
said. ``The party can give me one hell of farewell dinner thanking
me for bringing them to the promised land, even if I don't make it
there myself.''

HOW TO CURB BORROWING: MAKE LENDING RISKIER 
</HEADLINE>
 
 (Repeating for all needing.) (The Week in Review) 
(bl)  
By LOUIS UCHITELLE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ever since the global financial crisis began in East Asia 19
months ago, public debate has focused on the mistake made by the
damaged countries: too much borrowing. Now the flip side of that
problem is coming into focus: too much lending.
</P>
<P>
   The latest thinking about how to stop new outbreaks of global
financial distress features proposals to slow down lending by
making it riskier and more expensive. The plans, coming from
academics and public officials, would rein in the banks, mutual
funds, hedge funds, pension funds and wealthy individuals in
industrial countries who in the 1990s poured tens of billions of
dollars in short-term loans into East Asia's booming economies.
</P>
<P>
   These loans played a huge part in precipitating bankruptcies,
bank failures, plunging currencies and recessions, first in Asia,
then in Russia and now in Brazil. When trouble came, the lenders
canceled the loans, withdrawing their money and leaving whole
countries in ruins.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is that in this particular crisis, private sector
lenders have not emerged well,'' Stanley Fischer, first deputy
managing director of the International Monetary Fund, said a week
ago at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, an annual
gathering of world leaders, corporate executives, economists and
other movers and shakers.
</P>
<P>
   The lenders, naturally enough, aren't happy about the attempts
to alter their behavior. Rising from his seat in the audience,
Citigroup vice chairman Deryck Maughan responded to Fischer by
noting that lenders had already lost considerable sums in the
current crisis _ a curb in itself on overly risky lending in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, William Cline, chief economist at the Institute
for International Finance, which represents lenders, said new rules
that make lending riskier would only inhibit the flow of capital
that emerging countries will need to expand their economies once
the current global crisis ends.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will take some time for a really strong, resurgent lending
market to revive,'' Cline said. ``It is asking for trouble to put
up impediments now to this future lending.''
</P>
<P>
   But that is the very goal of the new proposals. They seek to
avoid flooding a country with too much short-term lending that can
be quickly withdrawn. Already some nations are restricting such
lending by taxing short-term loans as they enter the country, thus
making them more expensive for the borrowers.
</P>
<P>
   The new approaches would strike at the lenders, preventing them,
for example, from pulling out their money in the event of crisis
conditions _ a weakening currency, shrinking economic growth _ that
threaten to devastate an economy. Other proposals would give debtor
countries the legal right to reschedule and postpone payments owed
to foreign banks and bondholders.
</P>
<P>
   Restricting lenders would solve another problem. It would
deflect criticism that the Clinton administration and the IMF, in
pushing through huge bailout loans for countries in crisis, are
using public money to repay lenders for risky credits they should
not have extended in the first place, or at least not in such
quantities. Such bailouts will only encourage excessive lending in
the future, this argument goes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If lenders don't take a hit, they won't price their loans
correctly,'' said Robert Litan, a senior fellow at the Brookings
Institution. ``They will set interest rates too low, and they will
shovel too much money into questionable markets.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposals to curb lending are coming increasingly from
international organizations, most of which bring together
representatives from industrial countries where the lenders are
located. One proposal, for example, would require or encourage
lenders to put aside, say, 9 cents or 10 cents for every dollar
lent to banks and businesses in high-risk countries. These are
amounts larger than the sums that are required to be put aside
today. With that extra money sitting idle, lenders would have to
increase their interest rates to earn as much as before _ and the
higher rates would inhibit lending.
</P>
<P>
   Another change would make it easier to renegotiate debt, much of
which is in the form of bonds sold to mutual funds, hedge funds,
wealthy investors and the like. Through a majority vote, for
example, these bondholders could agree to stretch out payments from
hard-pressed debtors in emerging countries. Currently, most bonds
agreements require a unanimous vote to do this.
</P>
<P>

HOW TO CURB BORROWING: MAKE LENDING RISKIER 
</HEADLINE>
 
 (Repeating for all needing.) (The Week in Review) 
(bl)  
By LOUIS UCHITELLE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ever since the global financial crisis began in East Asia 19
months ago, public debate has focused on the mistake made by the
damaged countries: too much borrowing. Now the flip side of that
problem is coming into focus: too much lending.
</P>
<P>
   The latest thinking about how to stop new outbreaks of global
financial distress features proposals to slow down lending by
making it riskier and more expensive. The plans, coming from
academics and public officials, would rein in the banks, mutual
funds, hedge funds, pension funds and wealthy individuals in
industrial countries who in the 1990s poured tens of billions of
dollars in short-term loans into East Asia's booming economies.
</P>
<P>
   These loans played a huge part in precipitating bankruptcies,
bank failures, plunging currencies and recessions, first in Asia,
then in Russia and now in Brazil. When trouble came, the lenders
canceled the loans, withdrawing their money and leaving whole
countries in ruins.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is that in this particular crisis, private sector
lenders have not emerged well,'' Stanley Fischer, first deputy
managing director of the International Monetary Fund, said a week
ago at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, an annual
gathering of world leaders, corporate executives, economists and
other movers and shakers.
</P>
<P>
   The lenders, naturally enough, aren't happy about the attempts
to alter their behavior. Rising from his seat in the audience,
Citigroup vice chairman Deryck Maughan responded to Fischer by
noting that lenders had already lost considerable sums in the
current crisis _ a curb in itself on overly risky lending in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, William Cline, chief economist at the Institute
for International Finance, which represents lenders, said new rules
that make lending riskier would only inhibit the flow of capital
that emerging countries will need to expand their economies once
the current global crisis ends.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will take some time for a really strong, resurgent lending
market to revive,'' Cline said. ``It is asking for trouble to put
up impediments now to this future lending.''
</P>
<P>
   But that is the very goal of the new proposals. They seek to
avoid flooding a country with too much short-term lending that can
be quickly withdrawn. Already some nations are restricting such
lending by taxing short-term loans as they enter the country, thus
making them more expensive for the borrowers.
</P>
<P>
   The new approaches would strike at the lenders, preventing them,
for example, from pulling out their money in the event of crisis
conditions _ a weakening currency, shrinking economic growth _ that
threaten to devastate an economy. Other proposals would give debtor
countries the legal right to reschedule and postpone payments owed
to foreign banks and bondholders.
</P>
<P>
   Restricting lenders would solve another problem. It would
deflect criticism that the Clinton administration and the IMF, in
pushing through huge bailout loans for countries in crisis, are
using public money to repay lenders for risky credits they should
not have extended in the first place, or at least not in such
quantities. Such bailouts will only encourage excessive lending in
the future, this argument goes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If lenders don't take a hit, they won't price their loans
correctly,'' said Robert Litan, a senior fellow at the Brookings
Institution. ``They will set interest rates too low, and they will
shovel too much money into questionable markets.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposals to curb lending are coming increasingly from
international organizations, most of which bring together
representatives from industrial countries where the lenders are
located. One proposal, for example, would require or encourage
lenders to put aside, say, 9 cents or 10 cents for every dollar
lent to banks and businesses in high-risk countries. These are
amounts larger than the sums that are required to be put aside
today. With that extra money sitting idle, lenders would have to
increase their interest rates to earn as much as before _ and the
higher rates would inhibit lending.
</P>
<P>
   Another change would make it easier to renegotiate debt, much of
which is in the form of bonds sold to mutual funds, hedge funds,
wealthy investors and the like. Through a majority vote, for
example, these bondholders could agree to stretch out payments from
hard-pressed debtors in emerging countries. Currently, most bonds
agreements require a unanimous vote to do this.
</P>
<P>
   Still other proposals would put ceilings on short-term lending
in risky markets, or require lenders to take a loss on their loans
in the event of a crisis _ a ``haircut'' that Litan is pushing.
</P>
<P>
   Are any of these changes likely to be adopted and enforced?
Probably not, if the global crisis ends soon. Besides, there are
few mechanisms to enforce these rules across borders.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the global crisis endures, overcoming the resistance of
lenders will not be easy. Borrowers may also object, given the
likelihood that the various restrictions will require them to pay
higher interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is,'' Litan said, ``that no one wants to be the
first to make the necessary commitment.''

RENT-A-SPY: COLD WAR FOES JOIN AS CAPITALIST TOOLS 
</HEADLINE>
 
 (Repeating for all needing.) (The Week in Review) 
(bl)  
By LESLIE WAYNE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   If anyone had suggested during the Cold War that former CIA and
KGB agents would one day be working together as business partners
to provide sensitive information to U.S. corporations, the idea
would have seemed too far-fetched to be believed.
</P>
<P>
   But that is exactly what is happening today as hundreds of
out-of-work spies from the United States and Russia are joining
hands in the pursuit of capitalism, providing protection,
intelligence and political risk assessments to U.S. companies
extending their reach to emerging markets and other global hot
spots.
</P>
<P>
   They include men like Gen. Victor Budanov, a former chief of
counterintelligence for the KGB, who formed a joint venture with
Gerard Burke, who was once assistant director of the National
Security Agency. Budanov heads the Moscow office of Parvus
International, a business intelligence firm in Silver Spring, Md.,
founded by Burke that employs former CIA, KGB and Soviet-bloc
agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not talk about our former jobs,'' Budanov said. ``We are
in a new life and we are now partners in the same boat of helping
our American clients.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the American Society for Industrial Security, a trade group
with 35,000 members representing private security companies, has a
Moscow chapter with about 35 ex-employees of the Soviet
intelligence agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who knows the territory there better than former KGB
officers?'' said Joseph Ricci, a spokesman for the group. ``Some of
our members at first had a hard time with having a Russian chapter
_ but then most of our members started out working for the U.S.
government. But these KGB guys are not employed by their government
anymore and they have to make a living. Their loyalty is to who is
putting food on their table.''
</P>
<P>
   Business intelligence firms provide U.S. corporations operating
overseas with information about local politics and pitfalls,
protection for executives and background data on local business
partners.
</P>
<P>
   Companies like Parvus keep American businesses from stumbling
into bad business arrangements in far-flung places like Kazakhstan,
Russia and the Ukraine and bail them out when they do _ helping
them deal with kidnappings, fraud, theft and extortion.
</P>
<P>
   For many of these firms, it makes perfect sense to employ former
spies, many of whom have spent their lives studying other cultures,
speak many languages and can often surreptitiously ferret out
information through networks of local contacts _ both among local
government officials and shadier types.
</P>
<P>
   ``Former KGB officers, like our CIA, are the best and the
brightest,'' said Frederick Rustmann, a retired CIA officer who is
head of CTC International (named after the CIA's Counter-Terrorism
Center), a firm in West Palm Beach, Fla., with six former CIA
agents and one ex-KGB officer on staff and scores of former
Soviet-bloc spies on retainer abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were all in the same trade and we all learned the same
techniques,'' Rustmann said. ``KGB officers are naturals. We use
them to collect information for us and for security. You can rent a
former KGB agent with four languages, a gun and a car for 50 bucks
a day. And he'll interpret for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Many former Russian spies are available because the KGB was
broken up into several agencies and scaled back after 1991, and the
financial rewards are far greater on the outside. And the recent
political and economic turmoil in Russia has only increased the
demand for their services, with Western companies scrambling for
more intelligence and protection than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   But don't the spies feel a little weird about working side by
side with their former adversaries? Apparently not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, our countries were enemies, but many of us were
friends,'' Rustmann said. ``The fact is, when I was in Libya I had
lots of KGB friends. Our backgrounds are similar, our psychology
and training are similar. We used to go on picnics together and our
families were friends. I was always trying to recruit Boris and he
was trying to recruit me.''
</P>
<P>
   Burke said in the six years that Parvus has been doing business
in Moscow, only once did a client _ a Fortune 100 company _ raise
questions about whether former KGB agents were trustworthy. Burke
dealt with this concern by slowly introducing his KGB staffers to
the American client and then increasing their level of
responsibility and accessibility to corporate secrets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in this business for many years and I'm able to vet
these people carefully,'' Burke said. ``From time to time in the
back alleys of the world, you are confronted with a lot of
inducements and you see a very, very dark side. There are some
former spies I wouldn't touch with a 10-foot pole.''
</P>
<P>
   Many former Soviet-bloc spies say they are still serving their
countries, only in a new way, by making sure that American
businesses keep capital invested in their homelands. ``Instead of
doing stupid Cold War stuff, we have finally found some useful
purpose in life,'' said one former spy who asked not to be named.
``We want to make sure that American investors don't get burned
here so that capital keeps flowing in. What used to be a lethal
weapon has now become very peaceable.''

IMPEACHMENT: WHAT A ROYAL PAIN 
</HEADLINE>
 
 (Repeating for all needing.) (The Week in Review)

<P>
   LONDON _ In 1386 _ which was a long, long time ago _ one Michael
de la Pole, Earl of Suffolk, confronted a destiny in medieval
England that resonates to this day.
</P>
<P>
   He was impeached.
</P>
<P>
   And there began a long and tangled process of legal challenge to
executive authority by representative body that, somewhat
circuitously, brought William Jefferson Clinton to trial on the
floor of the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The Earl of Suffolk, let it be said, was not impeached on
accusations related to sexual dalliance, so far as is known. His
crimes related more to misusing public funds and other offenses.
</P>
<P>
   But he was, like President Clinton, accused of ``high crimes and
misdemeanors'' _ the first appearance of that vague and contentious
phrase in the canon of English law. The words provided a starting
point for the Framers of the U.S. Constitution almost four
centuries later, according to Professor Gary McDowell, an American
expert on impeachment at the Institute of United States Studies at
London University.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt,'' McDowell said in congressional testimony
as the impeachment proceedings got under way in Washington in
November, ``that when the Americans turned their attention to
fashioning procedures for impeachment, they had the history of
Great Britain in mind.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, the British lessons serve as much as a warning of
impeachment's abuses as a guide to its benefits. ``History shows us
that in England, impeachment has been an engine more of passion
than of justice,'' he quoted Thomas Jefferson as saying.
</P>
<P>
   It is, possibly, one of the abiding ironies that the Framers of
the Constitution transplanted the notion of impeachment from an old
monarchy to a new republic just as the British themselves were
abandoning it. The Constitutional Convention began its
deliberations in Philadelphia in 1787. The last major impeachment
in British history began in 1788, when Warren Hastings, the first
governor-general of India, was charged with ``maladministration,
corruption in office and cruelty towards the people of India,''
according to McDowell. (His trial lasted seven years and he was
acquitted.)
</P>
<P>
   The reason impeachment withered in Britain was simply that the
growing strength of Parliament and the waning of despotic
monarchial rule allowed legislators to remove ministers through
confidence votes. ``As soon as the British system evolved into a
parliamentary system,'' said Professor Bernard Capp, a historian at
Warwick University, ``impeachment fell away.''
</P>
<P>
   So what remained from Britain's tradition in the new American
model of impeachment? Capp said impeachment in Britain had largely
been used as ``a means of attacking unpopular ministers'' put into
office by the king _ especially in the 17th century.
</P>
<P>
   Raoul Berger, a leading authority, wrote in his study,
``Impeachment: The Constitutional Problems'' (Harvard University
Press, 1974), ``Direct attack on the king being unthinkable save by
the path that led Charles I to the block, Parliament indulged in
the fiction that the king could do no wrong but was misled by its
ministers.''
</P>
<P>
   Impeachment gave Parliament a means to establish supremacy over
``absolutist pretensions,'' Berger wrote, and hence to erode the
power of the monarchy on the way to democracy. As in the United
States today, it thus represented a weapon in the perennial battle
between executive and legislative branches of government, an arrow
from a quiver of checks and balances supposed to hold democracy in
equilibrium and protect it from abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Historians say British tradition is the source of the process by
which the lower legislative house levels the charges to be tried by
the upper house (in Britain's case, it was the House of Commons and
House of Lords, respectively).
</P>
<P>
   And just as in the United States, impeachment in Britain was
long used for the removal of judges _ like Chief Justice William
Scroggs, impeached in 1680 on charges including excessive drinking
and bringing ``the highest scandal on the public justice of the
kingdom'' through irresponsible rulings.
</P>
<P>
   It was the British practice that enshrined the notion of ``high
crimes and misdemeanors'' as going beyond common law to a broader
sense of the betrayal of public trust.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, the British system worked on a definition similar
to that provided by former President Gerald R. Ford when, as a
congressman in 1970, he said that ``an impeachable offense is
whatever a majority of the House of Representatives considers it to
be at a given moment in history.''
</P>
<P>
   The Duke of Buckingham, for instance, was impeached in 1626 on
charges that included procuring ``titles of honor to his mother,
brothers and kindred,'' according to Berger's study.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Pett, the commissioner of the navy, was impeached in 1668
for ``negligent preparation for the Dutch invasion'' and ``loss of
a ship through neglect to bring it to mooring.''
</P>
<P>
   The Earl of Oxford, Viscount Bolingbroke and the Earl of
Strafford were impeached in 1715 for giving ``pernicious advice''
to the Crown regarding the terms of the Peace of Utrecht, ending
the War of the Spanish Succession.
</P>
<P>
   Arguably the prescribed punishment is the biggest difference
between the British and American impeachment procedures.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, removal from office is the sole penalty.
But in Britain, possible penalties once included ``corruption of
the blood,'' meaning the disinheritance of the offender's
descendants, said James McClellan, a retired professor of political
science and law in Indianapolis. Sentence could be meted out
through a ``bill of attainder,'' a legislative act allowing
punishment without trial. Treason, according to most authorities,
was punishable by death.
</P>
<P>
   Surveying the charges against him, Clinton might also draw
comfort from other turns of history.
</P>
<P>
   Sir William Blackstone, the principal British legal authority
available to the Framers, identified the obstruction of justice as
``at all times an offense of a very high and presumptuous nature.''
Perjury, he said, was a ``detestable'' offense, ``punished with six
months' imprisonment, perpetual infamy, and a fine, or to have both
ears nailed to the pillory.''

</P>
<P>
   The reason impeachment withered in Britain was simply that the
growing strength of Parliament and the waning of despotic
monarchial rule allowed legislators to remove ministers through
confidence votes. ``As soon as the British system evolved into a
parliamentary system,'' said Professor Bernard Capp, a historian at
Warwick University, ``impeachment fell away.''
</P>
<P>
   So what remained from Britain's tradition in the new American
model of impeachment? Capp said impeachment in Britain had largely
been used as ``a means of attacking unpopular ministers'' put into
office by the king _ especially in the 17th century.
</P>
<P>
   Raoul Berger, a leading authority, wrote in his study,
``Impeachment: The Constitutional Problems'' (Harvard University
Press, 1974), ``Direct attack on the king being unthinkable save by
the path that led Charles I to the block, Parliament indulged in
the fiction that the king could do no wrong but was misled by its
ministers.''
</P>
<P>
   Impeachment gave Parliament a means to establish supremacy over
``absolutist pretensions,'' Berger wrote, and hence to erode the
power of the monarchy on the way to democracy. As in the United
States today, it thus represented a weapon in the perennial battle
between executive and legislative branches of government, an arrow
from a quiver of checks and balances supposed to hold democracy in
equilibrium and protect it from abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Historians say British tradition is the source of the process by
which the lower legislative house levels the charges to be tried by
the upper house (in Britain's case, it was the House of Commons and
House of Lords, respectively).
</P>
<P>
   And just as in the United States, impeachment in Britain was
long used for the removal of judges _ like Chief Justice William
Scroggs, impeached in 1680 on charges including excessive drinking
and bringing ``the highest scandal on the public justice of the
kingdom'' through irresponsible rulings.
</P>
<P>
   It was the British practice that enshrined the notion of ``high
crimes and misdemeanors'' as going beyond common law to a broader
sense of the betrayal of public trust.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, the British system worked on a definition similar
to that provided by former President Gerald R. Ford when, as a
congressman in 1970, he said that ``an impeachable offense is
whatever a majority of the House of Representatives considers it to
be at a given moment in history.''
</P>
<P>
   The Duke of Buckingham, for instance, was impeached in 1626 on
charges that included procuring ``titles of honor to his mother,
brothers and kindred,'' according to Berger's study.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Pett, the commissioner of the navy, was impeached in 1668
for ``negligent preparation for the Dutch invasion'' and ``loss of
a ship through neglect to bring it to mooring.''
</P>
<P>
   The Earl of Oxford, Viscount Bolingbroke and the Earl of
Strafford were impeached in 1715 for giving ``pernicious advice''
to the Crown regarding the terms of the Peace of Utrecht, ending
the War of the Spanish Succession.
</P>
<P>
   Arguably the prescribed punishment is the biggest difference
between the British and American impeachment procedures.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, removal from office is the sole penalty.
But in Britain, possible penalties once included ``corruption of
the blood,'' meaning the disinheritance of the offender's
descendants, said James McClellan, a retired professor of political
science and law in Indianapolis. Sentence could be meted out
through a ``bill of attainder,'' a legislative act allowing
punishment without trial. Treason, according to most authorities,
was punishable by death.
</P>
<P>
   Surveying the charges against him, Clinton might also draw
comfort from other turns of history.
</P>
<P>
   Sir William Blackstone, the principal British legal authority
available to the Framers, identified the obstruction of justice as
``at all times an offense of a very high and presumptuous nature.''
Perjury, he said, was a ``detestable'' offense, ``punished with six
months' imprisonment, perpetual infamy, and a fine, or to have both
ears nailed to the pillory.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Hussein ibn Talal, a pivotal and sometimes heroic figure in the
Middle East, will be laid to rest with all the pomp and pageantry
of royalty: the Bedouin desert warriors in their red-checked
keffiyahs and smartly crossed leather ammunition belts; the
Circassian palace guards _ Muslims uprooted from the Caucasus _ in
high-booted, fur-hatted uniforms like cossacks; the crown, the
banners, symbols of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, a dynasty
stretching back through the mists of time to . . . May 25, 1946.
</P>
<P>
   In the Middle East, Egyptian diplomat Taseen Bashir likes to
say, only Egypt and Iran are real countries, places with a cohesive
history of nationhood; the rest are ``tribes with flags.''
</P>
<P>
   And of all the artificial countries created by the victorious
European powers who drew arbitrary lines on maps after World War I,
none was more artificial than the tiny, poor, lawless leftover
patch of desert that would become Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Even the flag was artificial. The green, red, white and black
banner that fluttered over Arab raiders led by the Hashemite family
against the Ottoman Empire _ the basis for today's flags of Jordan
and the Palestine Liberation Organization _ was designed by a
British Foreign Service officer named Sir Mark Sykes and produced
by his army's supply shop in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
   But Sykes is not remembered as the Betsy Ross of Arabia. He is
better known as half of a secret double-cross _ the Sykes-Picot
agreement of 1916 _ in which the British effectively sold out their
Arab allies by recognizing French interests in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, from this unpromising land, King Hussein and has
grandfather, King Abdullah, forged, largely by sheer force of
personality, the most modern nation in the Arab world. They did it
through dangerous decades of war with Israel and the frequent
hostility of their fellow Arabs.
</P>
<P>
   Even while clinging tenaciously to the old symbols _ Hussein's
personal aircraft is named the Qureish for the tribe of the Prophet
Mohammed, from whom he claims descent _ these unlikely survivors
developed a legitimacy far more in tune with the 20th century, one
that rests on a social contract with the royal family's people.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a social contract that harks back to the monarchy of
older times,'' said Fouad Ajami, a leading scholar of the region.
``The record of the Hashemites stands out as one of great
moderation and tolerance; they were temperate, merciful rulers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was always a turbulent realm, and when necessary there was
an iron fist in the velvet glove. But there was a legacy of
forgiving; even assassins were forgiven and rehabilitated. They
made a going concern of this modest realm and helped their people
escape the furies of the region around them.''
</P>
<P>
   The back story of the Hashemite monarchy begins on the eve of
World War I, in which the decaying Ottoman Empire would be allied
with Germany and Austria-Hungary. At the center of Ottoman rule was
the caliph, the supreme religious leader of Islam. But in the Arab
lands there were secret stirrings of nationalism, chafing against
Turkish rule.
</P>
<P>
   The British military commander, Lord Kitchener, and his
fledgling Middle East experts wanted to fan the flames of Arab
resistance; they hit on a scheme to create a new caliph, beholden
to them, in hopes that Britain could control the region after the
war. Their candidate was King Hussein's great-grandfather, Emir
Hussein of the Hejaz, the Sharif of Mecca, or guardian of Islam's
holiest places at the far southern edge of the Arabian Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   He duly declared the Great Arab Revolt in 1916 _ an affair of
machinations, blunders and betrayals all around that is told in
admirable detail in ``A Peace to End All Peace'' by David Fromkin
(Avon Books, 1989). For the less rigorous, this is the tale told in
the movie ``Lawrence of Arabia.''
</P>
<P>
   The Arab revolt was actually not all that great, historians now
say. It enlisted only a few thousand tribesmen and its exploits
were inflated by two master storytellers, the American
correspondent Lowell Thomas and Capt. T.E. Lawrence himself.
Nevertheless, the Arab army under Hussein's youngest son, Feisal
(Omar Sharif in the movie), led the victorious allies into
Damascus, the regional capital, on Oct. 1, 1918.
</P>
<P>
   The Arab nationalists planned for Feisal to become king in
Damascus and his older brother, Abdullah, to be king in Baghdad.
But the European powers, carving up the Ottoman remains, had other
ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Feisal reigned in Damascus only momentarily, until the French
took control there under the Sykes-Picot understanding. Then, with
British help, he moved his franchise to Baghdad, where his family
ruled until they were killed in a 1958 military coup.
</P>
<P>
   Back home in the Hejaz, the Hashemite dream of ruling as caliphs
failed too. Sharif Hussein proclaimed himself caliph on March 5,
1924, two days after the secularizing Young Turks now ruling
Istanbul abolished the office. But Abdul Aziz Ibn Saud, who bore
Hussein's family many grudges, led the Wahhabis _ the Muslim
fundamentalists of their day _ out of the desert and kicked Hussein
out in 1925, seizing the guardianship of the holy places and
creating Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   Many years later, when King Hussein would not line up against
Iraq in the Gulf War against the Saudis, he would refer to himself
as the sharif, in echo of his great-grandfather's claim.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, another wartime promise _ the Balfour Declaration of
1917, anticipating a Jewish homeland in the British mandate in
Palestine _ would shape events in the region for decades.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In early 1921, Abdullah turned up in the unpromising sands in
the eastern part of the mandate with an armed entourage, announcing
he was on his way to conquer Syria. Abdullah had been the original
architect of the alliance with the British, but Lawrence had
shunted him aside as charming and wily _ ``a tool too complex for
such a simple purpose'' _ in favor of Feisal.
</P>
<P>
   It was the beginning of the process by which Abdullah and his
grandson, King Hussein, would remain in the desert and create the
Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Winston Churchill, then colonial secretary, claimed he created
Jordan ``in an afternoon,'' by splitting off the territory in the
Palestine mandate east of the Jordan River into Transjordan in 1923
(although it continued to be administered as a mandate territory
until independence in 1946).
</P>
<P>
   This split avoided confrontations with France over who would
rule Damascus. And by naming Abdullah emir, or prince, and later
king, Churchill said, the British could ``repair the damage done to
the Arabs'' and the Hashemites.
</P>
<P>
   More important, Transjordan could serve as a safety valve for
Arabs who might leave the Palestine mandate as Jews streamed in.
The British subsidized Transjordan with millions of dollars, and
organized, trained and officered its army, the Arab Legion. This
force became the strongest in the Arab world. In 1948, it alone
held against the nascent Israelis, crossing the Jordan River to
take the West Bank and the holy sites in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   For both Abdullah and Hussein, ruling Jordan was always a
complex and potentially deadly balancing act. They had to satisfy
their Western patrons (first Britain, then the United States) while
keeping at bay their enemies (mostly Arab) and, above all, coping
with the vexing problem of the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Urbane by upbringing and nature, they nevertheless appeared at
home among the desert tribes who formed the backbone of their army
and their political base.
</P>
<P>
   As king, Hussein would find the balancing act even more
difficult. He was only 15 in 1951 when he saw his grandfather
gunned down next to him on the steps of al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem
by a Palestinian nationalist. He struggled, more than his
grandfather had, to balance his own modern and Western impulses
with Arab traditions and, often, anger. Still, in a land without
natural resources, he was able to build an educational system that
turned the population into a resource, able to work abroad in the
oil states.
</P>
<P>
   Under his rule, Jordan did not evolve into a full democracy but
it built a freewheeling Parliament and a relatively open press, in
sharp distinction to its Arab neighbors. King Hussein commanded an
effective intelligence service, or Mukhabarat, but ruled by a kind
of mass popularity rather than the fear of the secret police that
characterizes Syria and Iraq and is mitigated in Egypt only by
inefficiency and corruption. Palestinians numbered two-thirds of
the population of his country, swollen by refugees from the wars in
Israel and the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the decisions were costly: joining in the disastrous
Six Day War against Israel in 1967 and choosing not to join the
fight against Iraq in the 1991 gulf war. Ajami believes that
``history will judge these survival calls,'' for the king could not
withstand the mood of his own subjects. But in 1967 he lost the
valuable West Bank and holy sites, and in 1991, the desperately
needed subsidies and support from the oil-rich Gulf countries,
compounding his economic difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   At other times, there was raw, physical courage, as when he led
his army to expel the Palestinian commandos in the Black September
of 1970, earning him the nickname of ``PLK,'' which stood for
Plucky Little King.
</P>
<P>
   There were secret meetings over the years with Israel's leaders.
There were assassination attempts; once Syrian jets tried to shoot
down his private plane.
</P>
<P>
   And, at the end, he struggled most of all to find some peace for
the Middle East.

THE WORKPLACE OFTEN TAKES AN INTERN FOR THE WORSE

<P>
   Monica Lewinsky, America's most famous intern, has certainly
learned many tough lessons in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   But, of course, she's not the only bright-eyed intern dealt a
rude awakening by the realities of office sex, intrigue, power
politics or just plain bad workplace behavior. Consider what
happens to young pups in, say, the world of journalism, the
profession chronicling the Lewinsky saga.
</P>
<P>
   I know, because as a New York University journalism professor I
regularly sent my students out on newspaper, TV and radio
internships, and they reported back to me. Below are selected
entries from the weekly internship logs kept by my students over
the last few years. Taken together, their experiences could be a
syllabus for a course in the school of hard knocks.
</P>
<P>
   _ RICHARD PETROW
</P>
<P>
   INTERN ASSIGNMENT: Production assistant for national TV talk
show originating in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   RUDE AWAKENING: The intern is sexually harassed by a producer,
but gets a new internship after a complaint is lodged against the
offender.
</P>
<P>
   Log entry No. 1: J., the producer, kept telling me how great I
looked, and asked me out for a drink, and kept calling me ``Babe.''
I guess I know what interns are thought to be in that office. I'm
not interested in sleeping my way up the journalistic ladder.
</P>
<P>
   Log entry No. 2: J., the producer, cornered me in the lobby of
the building and kissed me on the mouth and called me ``a sweet
mushroom.'' Professor, is this sexual harassment?
</P>
<P>
   Log entry No. 3: J., the producer, asked if I dyed my pubic
hair, and when I said, ``Pardon me?!'' he unzipped his fly and
threatened to show me his.
</P>
<P>
   INTERN ASSIGNMENT: Production assistant for a network TV news
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   RUDE AWAKENING: Not only was the intern just a go-fer, but she
had to pay out of her own pocket for what she went for.
</P>
<P>
   Log entry: One of the producers asked me to buy him candy. Not
only does he take advantage of me, but also he doesn't pay me back.
What makes it worse, he always asks: ``You don't mind, do you,
honey? You know you're one of my favorite interns and I'll give you
a great recommendation when you leave.'' He also talks to me in a
condescending way, telling me to ``come here.'' Like I'm some kind
of dog.
</P>
<P>
   INTERN ASSIGNMENT: Research assistant at a weekly TV news
program.
</P>
<P>
   RUDE AWAKENING: It's who you know.
</P>
<P>
   Log entry: Favoritism plays a strong role here. Men interns who
are later hired for full-time jobs become researchers or tape
editors, while females are forced into receptionist slots. One
intern is a 17-year-old boy who is IGNORANT, LAZY and frankly
INCOMPETENT. He constantly wanders off and gives other interns
tasks he doesn't want to do, but he is the son of a friend of the
producer. It makes me SICK.
</P>
<P>
   INTERN ASSIGNMENT: Work at an upscale arts magazine in New York.
</P>
<P>
   RUDE AWAKENING: So-called creative types can be pretentious
windbags.
</P>
<P>
   Log entry: I have a problem dealing with art and artistic
people. Why do they say such things as, ``an idea expressed by this
form of multicultural contemporary art . . . is primordial in
essence''? I don't understand what the hell they are talking about.
</P>
<P>
   INTERN ASSIGNMENT: News assistant at a New York radio station.
</P>
<P>
   RUDE AWAKENING: You've got the job: Hip, hip, hooray.
</P>
<P>
   Log entry: My last day at the radio station. My boss asks me to
come into the newsroom. The next thing I know I'm being serenaded
to a chorus of ``For He's a Jolly Good Fellow.'' They swamped me
with gifts _ a hat, gingerbread cookies, Chinese food. My boss said
I was one of the top five interns of all time. Later I was informed
that I could continue on as a volunteer, but that there aren't any
paid positions available.
</P>
<P>
   INTERN ASSIGNMENT: Editorial assistant for an alternative
entertainment weekly.
</P>
<P>
   RUDE AWAKENING: The intern equivalent of learning you're not in
Kansas anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Log entry: We get freaky stuff in the mail, like the press
release from Mon Cherie's the Chamber, which is this
dance/bondage/sexual fetish club in Atlanta. It had just celebrated
its first anniversary, which was OK by me except that they felt
compelled to send us pictures of half-dressed people wearing dog
collars having chocolate sauce licked off their bodies by people in
leather. We sent them back a note saying, ``Unfortunately, we do
not have an editorial need for this type of material.''
</P>
<P>
   INTERN ASSIGNMENT: Production assistant for a local TV news
operation.
</P>
<P>
   RUDE AWAKENING: Sometimes your heroes have feet of clay.
</P>
<P>
   Log entry: The correspondent and producer were several hours
late because the correspondent hadn't finished the script. I was
stunned. At NYU, when a script is due at a certain time, it is due
then! When the correspondent finally arrived, he fixed his makeup
and complained about his red eyes. He had problems delivering his
standups and decided he would become a spoiled brat. I was in
disbelief as I watched his childlike bickering, unrealistic demands
and temper tantrums. Never had I seen someone act so
unprofessional. I then realized that this man, whom I had thought
to be one of the greatest reporters on television, was an
incompetent journalist with no talent.
</P>
<P>
   INTERN ASSIGNMENT: Reporter at the New York bureau of a major
Japanese daily.
</P>
<P>
   RUDE AWAKENING: Superiors can be imperious jerks.

   In early 1921, Abdullah turned up in the unpromising sands in
the eastern part of the mandate with an armed entourage, announcing
he was on his way to conquer Syria. Abdullah had been the original
architect of the alliance with the British, but Lawrence had
shunted him aside as charming and wily _ ``a tool too complex for
such a simple purpose'' _ in favor of Feisal.
</P>
<P>
   It was the beginning of the process by which Abdullah and his
grandson, King Hussein, would remain in the desert and create the
Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Winston Churchill, then colonial secretary, claimed he created
Jordan ``in an afternoon,'' by splitting off the territory in the
Palestine mandate east of the Jordan River into Transjordan in 1923
(although it continued to be administered as a mandate territory
until independence in 1946).
</P>
<P>
   This split avoided confrontations with France over who would
rule Damascus. And by naming Abdullah emir, or prince, and later
king, Churchill said, the British could ``repair the damage done to
the Arabs'' and the Hashemites.
</P>
<P>
   More important, Transjordan could serve as a safety valve for
Arabs who might leave the Palestine mandate as Jews streamed in.
The British subsidized Transjordan with millions of dollars, and
organized, trained and officered its army, the Arab Legion. This
force became the strongest in the Arab world. In 1948, it alone
held against the nascent Israelis, crossing the Jordan River to
take the West Bank and the holy sites in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   For both Abdullah and Hussein, ruling Jordan was always a
complex and potentially deadly balancing act. They had to satisfy
their Western patrons (first Britain, then the United States) while
keeping at bay their enemies (mostly Arab) and, above all, coping
with the vexing problem of the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Urbane by upbringing and nature, they nevertheless appeared at
home among the desert tribes who formed the backbone of their army
and their political base.
</P>
<P>
   As king, Hussein would find the balancing act even more
difficult. He was only 15 in 1951 when he saw his grandfather
gunned down next to him on the steps of al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem
by a Palestinian nationalist. He struggled, more than his
grandfather had, to balance his own modern and Western impulses
with Arab traditions and, often, anger. Still, in a land without
natural resources, he was able to build an educational system that
turned the population into a resource, able to work abroad in the
oil states.
</P>
<P>
   Under his rule, Jordan did not evolve into a full democracy but
it built a freewheeling Parliament and a relatively open press, in
sharp distinction to its Arab neighbors. King Hussein commanded an
effective intelligence service, or Mukhabarat, but ruled by a kind
of mass popularity rather than the fear of the secret police that
characterizes Syria and Iraq and is mitigated in Egypt only by
inefficiency and corruption. Palestinians numbered two-thirds of
the population of his country, swollen by refugees from the wars in
Israel and the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the decisions were costly: joining in the disastrous
Six Day War against Israel in 1967 and choosing not to join the
fight against Iraq in the 1991 gulf war. Ajami believes that
``history will judge these survival calls,'' for the king could not
withstand the mood of his own subjects. But in 1967 he lost the
valuable West Bank and holy sites, and in 1991, the desperately
needed subsidies and support from the oil-rich Gulf countries,
compounding his economic difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   At other times, there was raw, physical courage, as when he led
his army to expel the Palestinian commandos in the Black September
of 1970, earning him the nickname of ``PLK,'' which stood for
Plucky Little King.
</P>
<P>
   There were secret meetings over the years with Israel's leaders.
There were assassination attempts; once Syrian jets tried to shoot
down his private plane.
</P>
<P>
   And, at the end, he struggled most of all to find some peace for
the Middle East.

   Monica Lewinsky, America's most famous intern, has certainly
learned many tough lessons in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   But, of course, she's not the only bright-eyed intern dealt a
rude awakening by the realities of office sex, intrigue, power
politics or just plain bad workplace behavior. Consider what
happens to young pups in, say, the world of journalism, the
profession chronicling the Lewinsky saga.
</P>
<P>
   I know, because as a New York University journalism professor I
regularly sent my students out on newspaper, TV and radio
internships, and they reported back to me. Below are selected
entries from the weekly internship logs kept by my students over
the last few years. Taken together, their experiences could be a
syllabus for a course in the school of hard knocks.
</P>
<P>
   _ RICHARD PETROW
</P>
<P>
   INTERN ASSIGNMENT: Production assistant for national TV talk
show originating in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   RUDE AWAKENING: The intern is sexually harassed by a producer,
but gets a new internship after a complaint is lodged against the
offender.
</P>
<P>
   Log entry No. 1: J., the producer, kept telling me how great I
looked, and asked me out for a drink, and kept calling me ``Babe.''
I guess I know what interns are thought to be in that office. I'm
not interested in sleeping my way up the journalistic ladder.
</P>
<P>
   Log entry No. 2: J., the producer, cornered me in the lobby of
the building and kissed me on the mouth and called me ``a sweet
mushroom.'' Professor, is this sexual harassment?
</P>
<P>
   Log entry No. 3: J., the producer, asked if I dyed my pubic
hair, and when I said, ``Pardon me?!'' he unzipped his fly and
threatened to show me his.
</P>
<P>
   INTERN ASSIGNMENT: Production assistant for a network TV news
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   RUDE AWAKENING: Not only was the intern just a go-fer, but she
had to pay out of her own pocket for what she went for.
</P>
<P>
   Log entry: One of the producers asked me to buy him candy. Not
only does he take advantage of me, but also he doesn't pay me back.
What makes it worse, he always asks: ``You don't mind, do you,
honey? You know you're one of my favorite interns and I'll give you
a great recommendation when you leave.'' He also talks to me in a
condescending way, telling me to ``come here.'' Like I'm some kind
of dog.
</P>
<P>
   INTERN ASSIGNMENT: Research assistant at a weekly TV news
program.
</P>
<P>
   RUDE AWAKENING: It's who you know.
</P>
<P>
   Log entry: Favoritism plays a strong role here. Men interns who
are later hired for full-time jobs become researchers or tape
editors, while females are forced into receptionist slots. One
intern is a 17-year-old boy who is IGNORANT, LAZY and frankly
INCOMPETENT. He constantly wanders off and gives other interns
tasks he doesn't want to do, but he is the son of a friend of the
producer. It makes me SICK.
</P>
<P>
   INTERN ASSIGNMENT: Work at an upscale arts magazine in New York.
</P>
<P>
   RUDE AWAKENING: So-called creative types can be pretentious
windbags.
</P>
<P>
   Log entry: I have a problem dealing with art and artistic
people. Why do they say such things as, ``an idea expressed by this
form of multicultural contemporary art . . . is primordial in
essence''? I don't understand what the hell they are talking about.
</P>
<P>
   INTERN ASSIGNMENT: News assistant at a New York radio station.
</P>
<P>
   RUDE AWAKENING: You've got the job: Hip, hip, hooray.
</P>
<P>
   Log entry: My last day at the radio station. My boss asks me to
come into the newsroom. The next thing I know I'm being serenaded
to a chorus of ``For He's a Jolly Good Fellow.'' They swamped me
with gifts _ a hat, gingerbread cookies, Chinese food. My boss said
I was one of the top five interns of all time. Later I was informed
that I could continue on as a volunteer, but that there aren't any
paid positions available.
</P>
<P>
   INTERN ASSIGNMENT: Editorial assistant for an alternative
entertainment weekly.
</P>
<P>
   RUDE AWAKENING: The intern equivalent of learning you're not in
Kansas anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Log entry: We get freaky stuff in the mail, like the press
release from Mon Cherie's the Chamber, which is this
dance/bondage/sexual fetish club in Atlanta. It had just celebrated
its first anniversary, which was OK by me except that they felt
compelled to send us pictures of half-dressed people wearing dog
collars having chocolate sauce licked off their bodies by people in
leather. We sent them back a note saying, ``Unfortunately, we do
not have an editorial need for this type of material.''
</P>
<P>
   INTERN ASSIGNMENT: Production assistant for a local TV news
operation.
</P>
<P>
   RUDE AWAKENING: Sometimes your heroes have feet of clay.
</P>
<P>
   Log entry: The correspondent and producer were several hours
late because the correspondent hadn't finished the script. I was
stunned. At NYU, when a script is due at a certain time, it is due
then! When the correspondent finally arrived, he fixed his makeup
and complained about his red eyes. He had problems delivering his
standups and decided he would become a spoiled brat. I was in
disbelief as I watched his childlike bickering, unrealistic demands
and temper tantrums. Never had I seen someone act so
unprofessional. I then realized that this man, whom I had thought
to be one of the greatest reporters on television, was an
incompetent journalist with no talent.
</P>
<P>
   INTERN ASSIGNMENT: Reporter at the New York bureau of a major
Japanese daily.
</P>
<P>
   RUDE AWAKENING: Superiors can be imperious jerks.
</P>
<P>
   Log entry: As I have already been offered a job with a newspaper
in Tokyo after my graduation, I thought it might be wise for me to
intern at the paper's New York bureau. I telephoned the New York
bureau chief and told him of my situation. I asked if he could see

FOR THE SHORT-HANDED MILITARY, A WISP OF A DRAFT 
</HEADLINE>
 
 (Repeating for all needing.) (The Week in Review) 
(bl)  
By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Navy cannot put full crews aboard its warships.
The Air Force has a shortage of pilots. Recruiting soldiers has
become so difficult that between now and May, the Army will give
$3,000 up front to any reasonably able young man or woman who
enlists.
</P>
<P>
   Isn't it time, then, to think about bringing back the draft?
</P>
<P>
   Now, relax, all you draft-eligible young men (and maybe even
young women) out there. It's early yet to start reviving old
excuses for the draft board or packing your bags for Canada.
</P>
<P>
   But a quarter century after the last conscripts mustered at boot
camp, the idea of reviving the draft has gained new currency among
a small group of academics, lawmakers and even military commanders.
</P>
<P>
   They argue that a restoration of the draft _ perhaps as part of
some wider program of compulsory national service _ would not only
solve the personnel crises facing today's volunteer forces but also
provide an antidote to the military's growing detachment from
society.
</P>
<P>
   In January, The Army Times called for the draft, saying it would
make up for recruiting shortfalls and insure that political leaders
``would enter office understanding the military, its strengths and
weaknesses, and its culture.''
</P>
<P>
   In his recent book about the Marines, ``Making the Corps''
(Scribner, 1997), Thomas E. Ricks, a reporter for The Wall Street
Journal, argued that conscription was needed to rectify what he
regards as an ominous alienation of the military's warrior culture.
</P>
<P>
   He and others say it would restore to American society a sense
of collective duty and sacrifice lost after the draft ended in
1973. This is the sort of sentiment behind the popularity of
``Saving Private Ryan'' and Tom Brokaw's new book, ``The Greatest
Generation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's certainly worth considering,'' Capt. Thomas
Otterbein, commander of the Navy's newest aircraft carrier, the
Harry S. Truman, said when asked about the draft. ``We, as a
people, don't seem to have the same national ethos we used to have,
where public service, whether it be military or some other aspect
of it, was sort of expected.''
</P>
<P>
   It would take an act of Congress to restore the expired Military
Selective Service Act, and that is not about to happen, given the
political, social and economic forces arrayed against the idea of
interrupting the fledgling careers of today's youth at a time of
peace and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine, too, the debate that would have to take place about the
question of women. When there was last a draft, America was a
different place. The notion of conscripting women was almost
unthinkable (though not entirely, since for a time during World War
II, the Army worried that it might have to draft female nurses to
staff its field hospitals).
</P>
<P>
   Today, women make up 14 percent of the military, serving in
virtually all except the most combat-intensive units. In the
attacks on Iraq in December, women even flew jets into combat from
the deck of the aircraft carrier Enterprise. Excluding women from
the draft today would raise vexing questions about equality and
women's role in society.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one thing to ask people to send their sons to battle,''
one Pentagon official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
``Is anybody going to support sending their daughters?''
</P>
<P>
   For this and other reasons, the overwhelming majority of the
nation's uniformed leaders oppose the idea of reviving the draft on
its face. Most of them are old enough to remember the malcontents
that the draft foisted on the Army and, to a lesser extent, the
Marine Corps. (The Air Force and Navy always had enough volunteers,
many motivated by the desire to avoid being drafted into the grunt
forces of the Army or Marines.)
</P>
<P>
   The uniformed leaders say today's military is better-educated,
better-trained and better-motivated than any conscripted force ever
was or could be again.
</P>
<P>
   Rudy De Leon, the undersecretary of defense for personnel and
readiness, said that nothing short of a supreme national emergency
would rally the public support necessary to reinstitute the draft.
``The notion that the country would have a draft absent a critical
problem is out of sync with our history,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It's true that conscription cuts against the American grain.
Through most of its history, the United States has depended on
volunteers to fight its wars and keep its peace. The nation first
drafted soldiers in 1861 at the beginning of the Civil War, when it
faced the ultimate emergency: survival. It did not do so again
until May 1917; 15 months later, the drafted ended before World War
I did.
</P>
<P>
   President Franklin D. Roosevelt revived the draft in 1940 _
technically the first peacetime draft, though war was clearly
imminent. A year later, only weeks before Pearl Harbor, it survived
a congressional challenge by only a single vote. After a brief
respite following World War II, the nation's longest period of
compulsory service began in 1948. It lasted 25 years, through the
Cold War, Korea, the Berlin airlift, the Cuban missile crisis.
</P>
<P>
   President Richard M. Nixon, a Republican who campaigned against
the draft, let the Selective Service Act expire in 1973. It was the
Vietnam War, of course, that killed the draft, but not just because
the war was unpopular. The draft was widely viewed as unfair. Those
with the means or the connections _ Bill Clinton, Dan Quayle _
avoided conscription. Those who didn't _ poor farm boys,
blue-collar workers, blacks _ went to the jungles.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Charles Moskos, an expert on military affairs at Northwestern
University and an advocate of compulsory service, said a draft
could once again be a socially binding force, if designed to
include the nation's elite. He recalled that two-thirds of his
graduating class at Princeton in 1956 went into the military, the
same year Elvis Presley answered the Army's call-up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all knew Elvis Presley was 45 kilometers down the road,''
Moskos said of his tour in Germany. ``Can you imagine Michael
Jackson in the Army today?''
</P>
<P>
   Well, no. But while a revival of the draft is remote, the
question is not as academic as it might seem. By law today, as
during the draft, every American male citizen or permanent resident
between 18 and 25 is required to register with the Selective
Service System. A high compliance rate is insured in part by the
fact that proof of draft registration is a prerequisite for federal
jobs, job training or student financial aid. (Many states have
similar requirements.) Ninety-one percent of those eligible _ more
than 10 million men _ are now a draft card away from military
service should the need arise. Failing to register is a federal
felony punishable by up to 5 years in prison and $250,000 fine,
though the crime hasn't been prosecuted in years.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, some members of Congress have mused publicly
about reinstating the draft, including Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., a
prisoner of war in Vietnam, and Rep. Floyd Spence, R-S.C.,
Republican chairman of the House's Armed Services Committee.
</P>
<P>
   And the military's mounting personnel woes have given the idea
new seriousness. With the economy thriving and young people less
willing than ever to consider a hitch in the military, let alone a
career, the services are scrambling to find enough recruits for
even today's trimmed-down military.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy fell short of its recruiting goals last year by nearly
7,000 sailors, and the shortfall is now manifesting itself as
shortages of sailors in the fleet. In the first quarter of this
fiscal year, the Army fell short by 2,345 recruits, nearly 20
percent below its goal for the period, despite new ads, bonuses and
an increase in college aid.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to reach a point where we can't rely on volunteers
anymore,'' one Army official fretted.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the Pentagon hopes to solve the problem with an
across-the-board pay raise, targeted raises for the middle ranks
and better retirement benefits. The services are also taking steps,
some of them controversial. The Navy plans to recruit more youths
who have not finished high school. The Army hopes to target the
nation's growing Hispanic population, where many young men and
women seem more eager to serve than non-Hispanic whites or blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Admiral Jay Johnson, who as chief of naval operations is the
Navy's top officer, said that even with recruiting problems, it was
``pretty tough to beat'' the force he has. Today's Navy, he said,
is ``a high-quality, all-volunteer force, people who are here
because they want to be, not because they have to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, somebody might say, `Yeah, OK, Johnson, what if you can't
get that force?''' he said. ``If you can't get that force, then I
guess we have to have another discussion.''

<P>
   Imagine, too, the debate that would have to take place about the
question of women. When there was last a draft, America was a
different place. The notion of conscripting women was almost
unthinkable (though not entirely, since for a time during World War
II, the Army worried that it might have to draft female nurses to
staff its field hospitals).
</P>
<P>
   Today, women make up 14 percent of the military, serving in
virtually all except the most combat-intensive units. In the
attacks on Iraq in December, women even flew jets into combat from
the deck of the aircraft carrier Enterprise. Excluding women from
the draft today would raise vexing questions about equality and
women's role in society.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one thing to ask people to send their sons to battle,''
one Pentagon official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
``Is anybody going to support sending their daughters?''
</P>
<P>
   For this and other reasons, the overwhelming majority of the
nation's uniformed leaders oppose the idea of reviving the draft on
its face. Most of them are old enough to remember the malcontents
that the draft foisted on the Army and, to a lesser extent, the
Marine Corps. (The Air Force and Navy always had enough volunteers,
many motivated by the desire to avoid being drafted into the grunt
forces of the Army or Marines.)
</P>
<P>
   The uniformed leaders say today's military is better-educated,
better-trained and better-motivated than any conscripted force ever
was or could be again.
</P>
<P>
   Rudy De Leon, the undersecretary of defense for personnel and
readiness, said that nothing short of a supreme national emergency
would rally the public support necessary to reinstitute the draft.
``The notion that the country would have a draft absent a critical
problem is out of sync with our history,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It's true that conscription cuts against the American grain.
Through most of its history, the United States has depended on
volunteers to fight its wars and keep its peace. The nation first
drafted soldiers in 1861 at the beginning of the Civil War, when it
faced the ultimate emergency: survival. It did not do so again
until May 1917; 15 months later, the drafted ended before World War
I did.
</P>
<P>
   President Franklin D. Roosevelt revived the draft in 1940 _
technically the first peacetime draft, though war was clearly
imminent. A year later, only weeks before Pearl Harbor, it survived
a congressional challenge by only a single vote. After a brief
respite following World War II, the nation's longest period of
compulsory service began in 1948. It lasted 25 years, through the
Cold War, Korea, the Berlin airlift, the Cuban missile crisis.
</P>
<P>
   President Richard M. Nixon, a Republican who campaigned against
the draft, let the Selective Service Act expire in 1973. It was the
Vietnam War, of course, that killed the draft, but not just because
the war was unpopular. The draft was widely viewed as unfair. Those
with the means or the connections _ Bill Clinton, Dan Quayle _
avoided conscription. Those who didn't _ poor farm boys,
blue-collar workers, blacks _ went to the jungles.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Charles Moskos, an expert on military affairs at Northwestern
University and an advocate of compulsory service, said a draft
could once again be a socially binding force, if designed to
include the nation's elite. He recalled that two-thirds of his
graduating class at Princeton in 1956 went into the military, the
same year Elvis Presley answered the Army's call-up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all knew Elvis Presley was 45 kilometers down the road,''
Moskos said of his tour in Germany. ``Can you imagine Michael
Jackson in the Army today?''
</P>
<P>
   Well, no. But while a revival of the draft is remote, the
question is not as academic as it might seem. By law today, as
during the draft, every American male citizen or permanent resident
between 18 and 25 is required to register with the Selective
Service System. A high compliance rate is insured in part by the
fact that proof of draft registration is a prerequisite for federal
jobs, job training or student financial aid. (Many states have
similar requirements.) Ninety-one percent of those eligible _ more
than 10 million men _ are now a draft card away from military
service should the need arise. Failing to register is a federal
felony punishable by up to 5 years in prison and $250,000 fine,
though the crime hasn't been prosecuted in years.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, some members of Congress have mused publicly
about reinstating the draft, including Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., a
prisoner of war in Vietnam, and Rep. Floyd Spence, R-S.C.,
Republican chairman of the House's Armed Services Committee.
</P>
<P>
   And the military's mounting personnel woes have given the idea
new seriousness. With the economy thriving and young people less
willing than ever to consider a hitch in the military, let alone a
career, the services are scrambling to find enough recruits for
even today's trimmed-down military.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy fell short of its recruiting goals last year by nearly
7,000 sailors, and the shortfall is now manifesting itself as
shortages of sailors in the fleet. In the first quarter of this
fiscal year, the Army fell short by 2,345 recruits, nearly 20
percent below its goal for the period, despite new ads, bonuses and
an increase in college aid.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to reach a point where we can't rely on volunteers
anymore,'' one Army official fretted.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the Pentagon hopes to solve the problem with an
across-the-board pay raise, targeted raises for the middle ranks
and better retirement benefits. The services are also taking steps,
some of them controversial. The Navy plans to recruit more youths
who have not finished high school. The Army hopes to target the
nation's growing Hispanic population, where many young men and
women seem more eager to serve than non-Hispanic whites or blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Admiral Jay Johnson, who as chief of naval operations is the
Navy's top officer, said that even with recruiting problems, it was
``pretty tough to beat'' the force he has. Today's Navy, he said,
is ``a high-quality, all-volunteer force, people who are here
because they want to be, not because they have to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, somebody might say, `Yeah, OK, Johnson, what if you can't
get that force?''' he said. ``If you can't get that force, then I
guess we have to have another discussion.''

   NEW YORK _ It was spring when J. Geraldine Jackson first began
to feel the world closing in on her. It seemed as if she were
living in a cave inside her mind. She slept countless hours and
lost her job. Her heart raced. Sometimes her left leg went numb.
Her favorite television show, ``The Equalizer,'' a dark drama about
crime in Manhattan, no longer held its allure. Noise _ especially
laughter _ made her want to fight.
</P>
<P>
   It was a little smart talk from her sister that finally set her
off. She pummeled her sister with her fists, grabbed a pocketbook
and a change of clothes, and fled the housing project in the Bronx
where she lived with her mother. She landed in a homeless shelter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to go,'' Ms. Jackson, 39, recalled. ``I was really
beginning to lose it. I had lost it.''
</P>
<P>
   That day last May marked the final phase of her journey into
homelessness, which, she can now see, had begun more than a decade
ago. It took the doctors at the homeless shelter a few weeks to
give her problem a name: manic-depression.
</P>
<P>
   As mental-health experts learn more about mood disorders, it is
becoming clear that depression and manic-depression, with its wild
mood swings, are a significant cause of homelessness.
</P>
<P>
   Homeless shelters have long been filled with schizophrenics,
people whose hallucinations and delusions force them out of jobs
and homes and relationships. But the link between depression and
homelessness is only now becoming clear.
</P>
<P>
   Much attention has been focused on depression and
manic-depression in recent years as a number of prominent _ and
well-off _ people have offered public accounts of their battles
with the diseases. In ``An Unquiet Mind: A Memoir of Moods and
Madness (Vintage Books, 1995), Dr. Kay Redfield Jamison, a
psychiatrist, gave a moving portrait of her own battle with
manic-depression.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Wallace of ``60 Minutes'' did a segment on the program with
Art Buchwald in which they discussed their struggles with
depression. William Styron's memoir of his struggle with a deep
depression, ``Darkness Visible,'' became a best seller a few years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   But they all had safety nets, and they were brought back, some
from the brink of suicide, by expensive treatments and dutiful
families.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was able to get the best medical care possible,'' said Dr.
Jamison, a professor of psychiatry at the Johns Hopkins School of
Medicine. Whenever she sees a homeless person, she thinks, ``There
but for the grace of God go I,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   For Ms. Jackson and others like her, there is no such safety
net. It is unclear how many others are in similar situations, but
Dr. Ronald Fieve, a pioneer in the use of lithium to treat
depression and manic-depression, said aggressive efforts to
identify homeless people with the disorders could significantly
reduce the population of homeless shelters.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people are in a state of chronic illness that is
treatable,'' said Fieve, who has recruited homeless patients at
shelters for clinical studies of mood disorders.
</P>
<P>
   As a rule, doctors say, manic-depression like Ms. Jackson's,
also known as bipolar disorder, responds to mood stabilizers like
lithium, Depakote and Tegretol, but diagnosing the disease can be a
formidable task because it can appear, in its later stages, like
schizophrenia. During the highs, manic-depressives can become
delusional, like schizophrenics. Because schizophrenia's symptoms
are easier to diagnose, emergency-room doctors and shelter
operators are much more likely to classify someone as schizophrenic
than manic-depressive.
</P>
<P>
   During the low points for manic-depressives, extreme fatigue is
common.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no desire to get going on anything, which means they
become burdens if they are living with anybody,'' Fieve said.
``They are not able to earn any money. If you work, you've probably
lost your job because of excessive absenteeism and poor
performance. If you are poor, this is where homelessness sets in.
Your family can't deal with you. So, you're out on the streets.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jackson turned to cocaine in an attempt to quiet her demons.
It only made things worse, she said. And when the doctors did sort
out her problems, she said, they had difficulty treating her
manic-depression because of her drug addiction.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the appropriate diagnosis and medication, the
complexities of manic-depression are such that patients live in
denial. Sometimes they stop taking their medicine when they start
to feel better, leaving them open to more intense episodes.
</P>
<P>
   On this point, and many others, Ms. Jackson's is a case study in
how manic-depressives can drift into homelessness and, if their
problem is recognized, reclaim their lives.
</P>
<P>
   The reclamation does not occur overnight, but comes in fits and
starts as Ms. Jackson's metamorphosis shows. Though it takes years
for some people to get the disease under control, it took her less
than a year. She was supervised closely by doctors who were
experienced in helping homeless manic-depressives.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jackson allowed a reporter to follow her on the journey,
which lasted about eight months, the length of her stay at a
homeless shelter for mentally ill women in lower Manhattan. She
permitted doctors and social workers to discuss her case with the
reporter because she wanted her story to help others.

</P>
<P>
   The first meeting with Ms. Jackson occurred last June, after her
third week at the shelter. Angry and suspicious, she believed she
had been misdiagnosed. She wore a billowy denim dress and tried to
hide behind huge sunglasses and a sun hat.
</P>
<P>
   She spoke in fragments, but she made two things clear. She
wanted a home for herself and her 13-year-old son, Timothy, who is
living with her father during her recovery. And she was sick, she
said, but not in the head. She had heart palpitations, a headache
and a sharp pain that charged up and down her left leg.
</P>
<P>
   During several meetings in June, the signs of depression
lingered. The headaches, palpitations and leg pain persisted. Once
styling spray from her short curly hair dripped into her eyes and
slid down the sides of her face. She didn't notice. A hallmark of
depression is the loss of concern about one's appearance.
</P>
<P>
   But by July, the transformation was dramatic. The headaches,
heart palpitations and leg pain had disappeared. Depression can
sometimes cause unexplained pain, said Dr. David Nardacci, who had
first prescribed a combination of mood stabilizers, antidepressants
and sleeping pills for her. Later, she was stabilized on a new
combination of mood elevators and antidepressants, including
Wellbutrin and Tegretol, and taken off the sleeping pills.
</P>
<P>
   No longer irritable, she was talkative and energetic. A
toothless smile had replaced the vacant stares and the darting
glances. She wore her short curly hair pinned back.
</P>
<P>
   She even chatted with a security guard at the front desk of the
shelter and joked with other residents as she left for an outing.
Over a dinner of steamy pasta at a trendy downtown restaurant, she
talked about reconnecting with her family and living drug-free.
</P>
<P>
   And she ruminated about how manic-depression can ruin a person's
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe I didn't think I had this,'' she said of
manic-depression. ``It's so obvious to me now.''
</P>
<P>
   She was ready, she thought, to go back to work. But her
counselors urged her to take one day at a time. She had been fired
in March 1997 from her clerical job at an insurance office because
of excessive absenteeism, a symptom of her disease. She talked
about wanting to repair her credit, which was ruined years ago by
wild spending sprees during manic phases.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad I made this move,'' she said of her entry into the
shelter system. ``If I had done it sooner, things wouldn't be so
bad now. I would have been able to save my job. I would have had my
own house. I could have been in school. I could have had a car and
credit cards. I would have been able to save a lot of things.''
</P>
<P>
   Feeling better than she had in 20 years, Ms. Jackson left the
shelter last month and moved into assisted housing on Manhattan's
Lower East Side. She signed up to live there for two years, she
said, but she plans to be out in about seven months. She wants to
become an addictions counselor.
</P>
<P>
   Because new symptoms of anxiety and depression had flared up a
few months ago, Nardacci added lithium to Ms. Jackson's daily dose
of medications. The pills are in part responsible for a 30-pound
weight gain, but Ms. Jackson was unfazed.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in a yellow turtleneck and tweed pants, her hair swept
up into a beehive, Ms. Jackson was happy yet apprehensive about
leaving the shelter.
</P>
<P>
   Her next stop, Los Vecinos on Pitt Street, is geared toward
mentally ill people with substance abuse problems and offers
counseling and psychiatric treatment, among other things.
</P>
<P>
   The services at Los Vecinos are much like those offered at the
shelter, but Ms. Jackson has her own room instead of a cubicle. She
shares a common space with two other women.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wake up to whatever the plan is for that day,'' she said.
``I have no baggage from the day before. I can deal with things.
That's a big plus. It is so awesome that I can deal with things
that used to grip me for days.''

   WASHINGTON _ What would happen if the government were investing
hundreds of billions of dollars of Social Security reserves in the
stock market, and the anti-abortion forces in Congress decided that
none of it should be put into companies that make or import pills
that induce abortion?
</P>
<P>
   Playing politics with the Social Security reserves would be
quite unpopular. But companies that might want to put abortion
pills on the market could hardly afford the risk that their stocks
would be off limits to maybe the biggest single investor in the
world. So it's a safe bet that any plans to put the pills on sale
would be shelved.
</P>
<P>
   That is the kind of nightmare foreseen by the economists and
politicians who oppose President Clinton's plan to beef up Social
Security reserves by investing some of the money in stocks.
Political tampering, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan warned
Congress in January, could ``put at risk the efficiency of our
capital markets and thus our economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans and conservative economists oppose the Clinton plan
because they fear government intrusion in the markets. But most of
them would also divert Social Security money into stocks. Under
various proposals, all workers would be allowed to take some of the
money they would otherwise pay in taxes and invest it in stocks
that would go into their own private investment accounts.
</P>
<P>
   But these plans are fraught with potential problems, too, the
most serious being the possibility that workers could lose some of
their retirement savings through bad investments or a drop in the
market.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides are trying to take advantage of a simple fact of
economic history: Over a long period of time, private stocks have
earned much more money for investors than the government bonds
where by law the Social Security reserves are now held. Economists
project the average annual return on stocks over the next 75 years
to be 6 percent to 7 percent more than the rate of inflation,
compared with an average of less than 3 percent above inflation for
government bonds.
</P>
<P>
   This is important because every additional dollar investments
earn for retirement is one less dollar the government will have to
raise for Social Security through higher taxes or reduced benefits
when the baby boomers begin to retire early in the next century.
</P>
<P>
   But the issue is more a matter of politics and ideology than of
economics. Most of the advocates on both sides _ those who want the
government to control the investments and those who want workers to
invest the money themselves _ would rather leave the Social
Security system as it is now with its lower return on investments
than take what they see as the unacceptable risks of the other
side's proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Under President Clinton's plan, nearly $600 billion, or 15
percent of the Social Security trust fund, would be invested in
stocks between now and 2015. Counting dividends and inflation, the
government would then own about $1 trillion in stock, nearly 4
percent of all the outstanding public stock in the country.
</P>
<P>
   A strict firewall would be built to protect this investment from
political meddling. Management would be placed in the hands of an
independent board whose members would serve long, staggered terms
and not be subject to removal for political reasons. Investments
could be made only in broad index funds, not in individual stocks.
The government's voting rights on its shares would be restricted,
and the managers would be required to vote shares solely according
to the economic interest of the beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   The president and his economic advisers argue that the
management board would be every bit as insulated from politics as
the Federal Reserve Board. And they say the experience of state
pension funds and the Thrift Savings Plan for federal workers shows
that public pension money can be invested in the stock market
without political interference.
</P>
<P>
   But critics point out that over the years, the Federal Reserve
has often been subjected to political arm twisting. (The Nixon
White House, for example, leaned heavily on Fed Chairman Arthur
Burns to see that the economy was especially strong in 1972 when
Nixon ran for re-election. Burns denied it, but many historians are
now convinced that he manipulated monetary policy to that effect.)
</P>
<P>
   Any firewall that Congress builds, the critics note, Congress
can also tear down with one vote.
</P>
<P>
   As for state and local pension funds, they have generally
avoided political tampering, but there are countless exceptions.
Pension funds in California and Illinois have been required to
contribute money to offset state budget deficits. Funds in
Pennsylvania and Connecticut recently lost millions of dollars
because politicians insisted they make investments to keep or
attract job-producing businesses in those states. In the 1970s and
1980s, more than half the state legislatures prohibited their
retirement funds from being invested in companies that did business
in South Africa. Pension funds in four states _ Florida,
Massachusetts, Minnesota and Vermont _ have been required to sell
their stock in tobacco companies.
</P>
<P>
   The Thrift Savings Plan has indeed been free of politics. But
with assets of about $70 billion, its portfolio is much smaller
than Social Security's would be. In addition, unlike Social
Security, participation is voluntary for Federal workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pension fund money is lusted after by politicians of both
parties,'' said Richard Koppes, former general counsel of the
California Public Employees' Retirement System. ``They can't resist
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Allowing workers to invest part of their retirement money
themselves, as most Republicans want to do, avoids most of the
political problems, but it raises others. Most Americans are not
sophisticated about finance and could be victimized by unscrupulous
sales pitches. In 1988, when Britain allowed workers to opt out of
the public pension system and invest in private accounts, many
people lost billions of dollars to scam artists in what was called
the ``mis-selling'' scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem is that markets are not always strong. The
decade of the 1970s, for example, was not good for stocks. Adjusted
for inflation, the average portfolio did not reach its 1969 level,
even with dividends reinvested, until 1983. A huge government
portfolio could smooth the peaks and valleys, but private investors
could lose a large part of their retirement savings in a bear
market.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, small accounts would be expensive to administer, and a
sizable chunk of workers' savings could go to administrative fees.
According to Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Arthur
Levitt Jr., a 1 percent annual fee, for instance, reduces an
account's balance by 17 percent after 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Still, since almost everyone in politics wants to put some of
the money in the stock market one way or another, perhaps the
president and Congress will decide that the reward is worth the
risks. The division between the two sides over how to invest the
Social Security money is so sharp, though, that a compromise will
be difficult. But the attraction of finding a way to minimize tax
increases and benefit cuts is mighty strong.

   The Budget Fight Opens in Washington
</P>
<P>
   The scramble has begun for trillions of dollars in surplus
federal revenues. President Clinton proposed a $1.77 trillion
budget for the year 2000 jammed full of tax breaks and new spending
_ for families with children and for schools, the elderly and
disabled, the environment and scientific research.
</P>
<P>
   But he warned Congress again not to lay a finger on the $117
billion budget surplus for that year and the more than $2.4
trillion in surpluses he projects for the next 10 years. Clinton
insists the money should be held in reserve until a plan is
completed to insure the long-term solvency of Social Security and
Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans in Congress have other plans _ a big
across-the-board tax cut. But they can't agree on the structure and
size of the cut.

   Most of the land is in the Lewis and Clark National Forest, near
Glacier National Park and the Bob Marshall Wilderness. It is the
only place where grizzly bears frequently roam down from the

and other species.

   The District of Columbia's latest incident of racial tension
ended quietly when Mayor Anthony Williams asked a white aide who
had used the word ``niggardly'' in talking with a black co-worker
to return to his job.
</P>
<P>
   The aide, David Howard, resigned after reports that the
co-worker thought he had used a racial epithet, rather than a word
that is a synonym for miserly and does not derive from the slur.
After investigating, Williams found that Howard did not utter the
slur that the co-worker thought he heard. The mayor also told
Howard he had acted ``too hastily'' in accepting his resignation.

   But sometimes, what it takes is a lawsuit: On Tuesday, in the

still stands.
</P>
<P>
   That was then. Now, at 44, Payton finds himself struck by a rare
liver disease that requires a transplant within two years. Payton,
thin and appearing tired, made his condition known at an emotional
news conference at which he asked friends and fans to pray for him.

   Ever since the AIDS epidemic was discovered in 1981, many have
wondered: Where did the AIDS virus come from? Virus detectives say
they have an answer: an endangered subspecies of chimpanzees. Using
genetic and molecular tests, an international team of scientists
said they had traced the origin of HIV-1, the virus that has caused
most of the 30 million AIDS infections in the world, to Pan
troglodytes troglodytes, chimpanzees that live in west and central
Africa. Because these chimpanzees apparently can live with the
virus without falling ill, a hope is to use the discovery to
eventually improve therapies and develop an effective vaccine.

the wealthy and turned the road snaking up from the valley into a

   Yet billionaires and presidents attending the privately funded
World Economic Forum in the Swiss ski resort of Davos proved once
again that the gathering, which has no official status, seems
irresistible to the world's elite.

   For six days, the big stars of policy, high finance and high
visibility _ from Nelson Mandela to George Soros and Yasser Arafat,
from Al Gore to Kofi Annan and Jane Fonda _ clustered in a concrete
conference center that someone nicknamed ``the bunker'' to debate
topics ranging from executive health to the maladies of the global
economy (the dominant theme).
</P>
<P>
   The forum reaches no binding decisions. But, for participants,
it is supposed to nurture networking and brainstorming among
government leaders and corporate barons, even as it provides a
platform for sonorous pronouncements and encourages debate on
weighty issues. And, of course, for those with energy left over,
Davos is ringed by crystalline ski-slopes that, last week, were in
perfect condition.

record for rushing yardage; his career mark of 16,726 yards gained
still stands.

<P>
   That was then. Now, at 44, Payton finds himself struck by a rare
liver disease that requires a transplant within two years. Payton,
thin and appearing tired, made his condition known at an emotional
news conference at which he asked friends and fans to pray for him.

   AIDS Virus Traced to Chimps
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the AIDS epidemic was discovered in 1981, many have
wondered: Where did the AIDS virus come from? Virus detectives say
they have an answer: an endangered subspecies of chimpanzees. Using
genetic and molecular tests, an international team of scientists
said they had traced the origin of HIV-1, the virus that has caused
most of the 30 million AIDS infections in the world, to Pan
troglodytes troglodytes, chimpanzees that live in west and central
Africa. Because these chimpanzees apparently can live with the
virus without falling ill, a hope is to use the discovery to
eventually improve therapies and develop an effective vaccine.

   Money or Power Required. Skis Welcome Too.

   The hotel rooms veer from spartan to luxurious, and suites are
said to be in short supply. The rattling railway through the Alps
takes hours to get there. A snowstorm grounded the helicopters of
the wealthy and turned the road snaking up from the valley into a
white-out.
</P>
<P>
   Yet billionaires and presidents attending the privately funded
World Economic Forum in the Swiss ski resort of Davos proved once
again that the gathering, which has no official status, seems
irresistible to the world's elite.
</P>
<P>
   For six days, the big stars of policy, high finance and high
visibility _ from Nelson Mandela to George Soros and Yasser Arafat,
from Al Gore to Kofi Annan and Jane Fonda _ clustered in a concrete
conference center that someone nicknamed ``the bunker'' to debate
topics ranging from executive health to the maladies of the global
economy (the dominant theme).
</P>
<P>
   The forum reaches no binding decisions. But, for participants,
it is supposed to nurture networking and brainstorming among
government leaders and corporate barons, even as it provides a
platform for sonorous pronouncements and encourages debate on
weighty issues. And, of course, for those with energy left over,
Davos is ringed by crystalline ski-slopes that, last week, were in
perfect condition.

<P>
   ``Uneasy lies the head that wears the crown,'' wrote William
Shakespeare.
</P>
<P>
   And that goes for crown princes, too, as Jordanian politics now
demonstrate.
</P>
<P>
   King Hussein deposed his brother, Hassan, from his 34-year
tenure as heir to the throne, and named his eldest son Abdullah, as
his successor. It was an extraordinary birthday present for
Abdullah, who turned 37 on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Just before the king's fairytale-like return to Jordan ended
darkly, he essentially accused his brother Hassan of meddling in
the army and allowing his own supporters to criticize Queen Noor.
</P>
<P>
   And yet many believe there can be absolutely no question of
Hassan's loyalty. Perhaps Hussein was led to false suspicions due
to palace intrigues, possibly involving Queen Noor herself, who
wants her son, Hamza, still only 18, to succeed to the throne.
Perhaps the king had worried that Hassan would put his own son on
the throne, though the two men had agreed decades ago that
Hussein's line would rule in future.
</P>
<P>
   Many national leaders find it hard to choose replacements, and
they often become jealous and suspicious of even the most trusted
lieutenants put into that position. Perhaps, they worry, the heir
is secretly trying on the crown and dreaming of what he will do too
soon before the old ruler is gone.
</P>
<P>
   The regent is placed in a very difficult position: Doing nothing
makes him seem a poor administrator; taking decisions makes him
seem a threat.
</P>
<P>
   Hassan apparently fell off this narrow tightrope.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's new king lacks political experience, though his strong
base in the army implies he would be able to make a stable regime.
Hussein even linked the change in succession with a defense of army
chief of staff, Field Marshal Abd al-Hafiz Kaabna, who Hassan was
seeking to remove.
</P>
<P>
   None of these developments means that Jordan is unstable. There
is not going to be any serious conflict among the factions. Things
will soon settle down into an acceptance of Abdullah's rule, and
the jockeying will begin by ambitious officials to ingratiate
themselves with the new successor.
</P>
<P>
   One hopes Abdullah will quickly become entrenched and
experienced as he moves toward success in his reign as Jordan's
fourth king.
</P>
<P>
   The key factor about Jordan is that it is a small country, in
terms of both population and territory. Compared to several
neighbors, it is inevitably weak.
</P>
<P>
   During the era of King Hussein's grandfather _ the original King
Abdullah _ in the 1940s and early 1950s, some Jordanians hoped
their state could be the nucleus of a wider Arab realm. But these
hopes soon faded and, with Abdullah's assassination in 1951,
disappeared entirely.
</P>
<P>
   Survival, not empire-building, has been the necessary theme of
Jordan's foreign policy. Today the main external threats are from
Iran, Iraq and Syria.
</P>
<P>
   King Hussein's successor will not find this easy to change, nor
is he likely to seek allies among the radical states. They cannot
do too much for Jordan, though there is a lot they can do against
it.
</P>
<P>
   Iran is a problem, of course, because its Islamic regime stands
for everything Jordan's government opposes, and vice versa. But
Iran is relatively far away, on the other side of Iraq, and does
not participate in the Arab political arena.
</P>
<P>
   Syria is much closer. Damascus would like to make Amman a
satellite similar to Lebanon. The Syrians have also sponsored
anti-Jordanian terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Coexistence is possible, but alliance is out of the question.
</P>
<P>
   The case of Iraq is more complicated.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq is potentially Jordan's largest trading partner, and the
sanctions against Baghdad have been devastating for Jordanian
business. The pressure of Jordanian public opinion and fear of
Iraqi military aggression led King Hussein to support Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein during the 1990-1991 Kuwait crisis and
ensuing war.
</P>
<P>
   After Iraq's defeat, Jordan switched sides. The United States
forgave it, but the Saudis and Kuwaitis are still angry. King
Hussein then burnt his bridges to Baghdad by welcoming Iraqi
oppositionists and attacking Saddam Hussein's regime in very strong
terms.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqis have reciprocated with even harsher words.
</P>
<P>
   There are no short-term prospects of a thaw, especially as long
as sanctions remain in place against Iraq. Still, in a
post-sanctions _ and, even more, a post-Saddam _ situation, the new
king might be eager to make up with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the Jordanians would waste no time in reestablishing
maximum trade the moment there was any opening to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, LESSON ONE for Jordan's new ruler is: Be very wary
about the radical regimes, both as a foreign threat and as a source
of internal subversion.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, any unilateral Jordanian-Iraqi rapprochement would
kill the kingdom's chances of getting Saudi and Kuwaiti aid.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Jordan has been pursuing the delicate task of
apologizing to the gulf monarchies for its behavior a decade ago.
In recent months, the common antipathy toward Iraq has been making
the Kuwaitis more open than ever to patching things up with Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   The Saudis are harder to persuade. They frequently remind
themselves that, back in 1991, a few Jordanians spoke of King
Hussein as the proper guardian of Mecca and Medina.
</P>
<P>
   The House of Saud took those cities away from King Hussein's
ancestors in the 1920s, and the current rulers of Saudi Arabia
worried that the Jordanians were dreaming of a comeback there.
</P>
<P>
   Still, perhaps they would give Abdullah the benefit of the
doubt, wanting to ensure the continuing stability of the Jordanian
monarchy.
</P>
<P>
   So LESSON TWO for the new ruler is: Do everything you can to
persuade the Saudis and Kuwaitis that you won't cause them any
headaches, so they'll give you lots of aid. Remember that Jordan's
main internal problems are due to economic stagnation.
</P>
<P>
   The next king might be tempted to distance Jordan a bit from
Israel to reduce some Arabs' antagonism and open other's purses.
Yet the strategic relationship with Israel is one of Jordan's main
assets.
</P>
<P>
   Who else is going to back Jordan against a radical threat or
help ensure a Palestinian state doesn't become a new problem for
Jordan?
</P>
<P>
   Thus, LESSON THREE: Preserve good relations with Israel,
whatever adjustments might be made to fit the new king's style.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's relationship with the Palestinians has a long and
complex history. Abdullah's West Bank wife should be an asset in
winning support from Palestinian-Jordanians.
</P>
<P>
   LESSON FOUR: Express support for the Palestinians so they make
gains. More Palestinians should not need to flee to Jordan as
refugees.
</P>
<P>
   But make sure they are hemmed in by commitments, so that a
Palestinian state would neither subvert nor threaten Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, remember that Arab solidarity is a wonderful thing, but
U.S. protection _ not politically correct nationalist or Islamist
rhetoric _ is Jordan's main protection from the potentially
smothering embrace of its Arab brothers.

<P>
   AMMAN - Jordanians absorbing the shockwaves of their political
earthquake back their new young ruler, Abdullah. But some express
concern over his inexperience and worry that he will have
difficulty filling his father's shoes.
</P>
<P>
   After assuming his post as crown prince last week, Abdullah
seemed remarkably well ensconced as the man who in only days would
inherit Hussein's kingdom. By Sunday, when his father passed away,
pictures of Abdullah in his new role, reviewing elite troops and
receiving kisses from tribal Beduin leaders had for days been
dominated the state media.
</P>
<P>
   Ministers, parliament members and the rest of the political
elite went out of their way to assure Abdullah of their support and
loyalty, and convey a sense of continuity as the kingdom endured
the shock of an end to the 46-year old reign of Hussein. Even the
former crown prince, Hassan, embraced Abdullah and offered best
wishes for his success.
</P>
<P>
   Some storekeepers had already removed pictures of King Hussein
with his brother Hassan and replaced them with posters of the king
with Abdullah.
</P>
<P>
   But in the Hussein refugee camp in downtown Amman, Salim
Ibrahim, an aluminum worker, was worried about the transition.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in a cafe crowded with unemployed youths playing cards
and old men smoking nargilas, Ibrahim, who traces his roots to Lod,
said: ``I am concerned at this point about Jordan's future. We know
King Hussein and he knows us. But we don't know how things will be
with another person.
</P>
<P>
   ``Abdullah is a military man, and he won't be like King Hussein,
who understood politics 100 percent. Abdullah doesn't have the
understanding that Hassan does,'' referring to the foreign and
domestic policy experience Hassan garnered during his 34-year
tenure as crown prince. ``Maybe, step-by-step, he will learn.''
</P>
<P>
   The main concern in the refugee camp was economic conditions,
which residents say have been deteriorating ever since the Persian
Gulf War. Unemployment in Jordan is estimated by economists to be
at 17 percent and, by all appearances, it was very much higher than
that in the camp.
</P>
<P>
   Others among the camp's 50,000 residents predicted the change in
succession would have no impact on their lives. ``It won't have any
effect, because we are talking about the same family, the Hashemite
family,'' a shopkeeper said.
</P>
<P>
   One man said he was puzzled by the letter King Hussein had sent
to Hassan that was publicized by the palace last week,
</P>
<P>
   It charged Hassan with usurping authority during the king's
six-month absence at the Mayo Clinic, and said that his associates
had waged a smear campaign against Hussein's American-born wife,
Queen Noor. ``It appears there were some family problems,'' the man
said. ``This letter was very strange.''
</P>
<P>
   Across town, on the tree-lined campus of the University of
Jordan, students said they were surprised by the rapid-fire change
in succession, but seemed to support it or accept it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course I feel badly about Prince Hassan,'' said Rami
Samain, 22, a law student, praising his academic accomplishments,
which include writing three books. As for Abdullah, he added: ``He
has a military mentality and that is a good thing for a developing
country.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The king has acted in the people's interest,'' added Mahmoud
Rawajdeh, a student of Islamic law. ``Perhaps Hassan can help
Abdullah. Why not?''
</P>
<P>
   Another student, who asked not to be identified, said: ``The
king started ruling when he was 18 and people accepted him as king.
Abdullah is much older than that, and his father chose him. I
expect Abdullah will be good for the country.''
</P>
<P>
   But another student, who asked not to be identified, said: ``I
think Abdullah has no experience with what is happening in the
region. Prince Hassan better understands relations with other
countries. There are reasons for these changes that no one knows. I
think King Hussein did this for his personal interest and not for
our benefit at all.''

   In his more than 40 years as the ruler of Jordan, King Hussein
served his country and his people well. Jordan today is in far
better shape than most Arab countries, despite the absence of oil
and other natural resources, and its prospects for the 21st century
are better than those of Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, and certainly Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Although he could not erase the Hashemite kingdom's deep social
and political divisions, Hussein was quite successful in managing
the internal conflicts to prevent them from exploding. Slowly and
carefully, he introduced democratic norms, encouraged pluralism and
debate, and gently nudged Jordan to the front of the Arab world in
this process.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the king's stature grew throughout the Middle
East. His judgment, straightforward style and common sense were
widely respected, and his humanity and measured leadership served
as an example for all other leaders in the region. In Israel, King
Hussein was more popular than any of the home-grown politicians.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, it is important to recall that in navigating
the Middle Eastern obstacle course that threatened the survival of
Jordan, Hussein made some major mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1960s, he failed to take action against Palestinian
terror groups using Jordan as a safe haven for attacking Israel.
This led to unnecessary and very costly confrontations with Israel.
This only ended in September 1970, when Palestinians turned their
guns against Hussein and almost succeeded in overthrowing the
Hashemite regime.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1967, he joined Gamal Abdel Nasser's military alliance
threatening to invade Israel, and after the war began in June,
Jordan's forces joined in and were quickly defeated. As a result,
the Hashemite kingdom lost control of the West Bank and, more
importantly, of Jerusalem's Old City.
</P>
<P>
   Much later, in 1990, Hussein briefly embraced Saddam Hussein's
madness. Perhaps his hand was forced by Iraqi- and
Palestinian-inspired demonstrations in Jordan, but as the leader,
he was responsible for the failure to prevent the creation of an
atmosphere in which popular support for the Iraqi dictator thrived.
</P>
<P>
   However, like his grandfather Abdullah, Hussein learned quickly
from his mistakes, and corrected them. In contrast to the leaders
of many neighboring countries, Iraq in particular, Hussein avoided
piling mistake upon mistake.
</P>
<P>
   He did not allow pride and inflated self-importance to dominate,
and was not afraid of admitting errors and reversing course. As a
result, the citizens of Jordan were spared the enduring pain and
suffering of the Iraqis, Syrians, Palestinians and Lebanese.
</P>
<P>
   After the 1967 disaster, while the other Arab states continued
to deny the reality of Israel's existence, Jordan quickly resumed
the informal cooperation on vital issues such as security and
water. The secret meetings started again, and cooperation with
Moshe Dayan's ``open bridges'' policy allowed the Palestinians on
both sides of the river to continue to trade and travel without
interruption.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, within a few months of end of the 1991 Persian Gulf
War, Jordan had totally disengaged from Iraq, and repaired its
relations with the United States and Israel. By the time of the
Madrid conference in October 1991, Hussein was no longer persona
non grata, and resumed his central role in promoting Arab-Israeli
negotiations and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, as the power of Iraq and the Palestinians declined,
Jordan was able to make substantial progress toward securing
security and stability by balancing the various threats.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as the Oslo agreement created the necessary political
conditions, negotiation of the Israel-Jordan peace treaty
accelerated and it was signed in November 1994. As a result, the
United States agreed to erase Jordan's debts, and other economic
benefits began to flow.
</P>
<P>
   However, the final and most important test of any leader is his
(or her) ability to create a legacy that lasts into future
generations.
</P>
<P>
   In the past decade, Hussein's brother, now the former crown
prince, Hassan, continued the the careful movement toward democracy
and pluralism. Hassan also helped to propel relations with Israel,
creating a far healthier and vital relationship between Jerusalem
and Amman. Hassan's emphasis on religious dimensions that unite
Arabs, Jews and Christians, and on the joint pursuit of scientific
and technological knowledge, provided additional dimensions to this
process.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently responding to pressures within his family, and his
own wish to see his line continued, the king abruptly replaced
Hassan with his oldest son, Abdullah.
</P>
<P>
   The world joins Jordanians in praying that Hussein made the
right choice and that the transition between rulers will be smooth.
</P>
<P>
   Abdullah's challenge is to continue and extend the policies that
were initiated by his namesake and great-grandfather, and were
extended and developed by his father. If he succeeds, he will be
able to lead Jordan to political and social stability, economic
growth, and increased democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps after Abdullah's reign, his heir will be chosen by
popular vote, and the monarchy will become more of a symbol. In
this way, Jordan will guide the rest of the Middle East toward the
stability that we all need.

 &HT;    With the passing of King Hussein, the people of Jordan are
losing a wise and tested leader and a strong and courageous
advocate of the cause of peace in the Middle East.
 &HT;    King Hussein made a great contribution to the history of the
Jordanian nation. His achievements for the benefits of his people
and other Arabs, as well as his global stature, were
internationally recognized during his lifetime. The king truly
deserved that recognition.
 &HT;    I recall my very first meeting with the king in Moscow, in 1987.
What a personality, what a strong and lively mind! Immediately, I
saw in him a wise and experienced statesman and a warm and friendly
man, a great human being. We talked at length about how best to
travel the road to peace in the Middle East. Political,
intellectual and personal courage were needed to reach that goal,
and the king clearly had it. As I worked to re-start the peace
process in that troubled region, King Hussein's advice was always
welcome and very important to me.
 &HT;    In his many years at the helm of Jordan, the king had his share
of frustrations and setbacks. He knew how to take those blows _ he
persevered, he went forward and led others. This ability will be
greatly missed.
 &HT;    As I was traveling in the United States last October, I watched
with admiration as the king left his hospital bed to help resolve
the difficulties in the negotiations between the Israeli and
Palestinian leaders. He looked frail, but I wanted to be hopeful
for his health. So it was a great shock for me to learn that King
Hussein was losing his battle to cancer.
 &HT;    Last April I visited Jordan. The king and Queen Noor invited me
and Raisa to the Royal Palace. It was a most memorable day for us.
It was as though we had seen each other and talked just a few days
before. The king and I discussed the Middle East and the many
political and psychological obstacles still to be overcome to make
peace a durable reality. He was full of ideas and vigor.
 &HT;    We met as old friends. We reminisced about our first talk in
Moscow, in 1987. Back then, I was struck by the king's total
commitment to peaceful methods of solving the Middle East problem.
I saw how concerned he was about the fate of the Middle East peace
process.
 &HT;    The king had done a great deal to preserve stability in
Jordanian society amid the turmoil in the region; yet in Jordanian
society, particularly among intellectuals and young people, there
was a growing disenchantment. Many people were viewing the peace
process as hopelessly deadlocked. Frustration was turning into
despair and a feeling of helplessness, which can be quite
dangerous.
 &HT;    It was clear to both the king and myself that, first of all, the
peace process must be carried forward, despite all setbacks. The
foundations laid down in Madrid and Oslo, we agreed, must be
preserved, for it was the only framework not just for the
resolution of the Palestinian problem but for creating a durable
system of security and cooperation in the region.
 &HT;    King Hussein and I discussed such a system in some detail. It
should encompass, among others, such countries as Iraq, Iran and
Turkey. Without it, the Middle East would not be able to respond to
the challenges of the new century, which include the issues of
security but also the environment, the water crisis and the problem
of terrorism.
 &HT;    In working for a peaceful solution of any issue it is very
important never to despair, always to remain optimistic. The
momentum for peace, set in motion by true leaders such as Yitzhak
Rabin, Shimon Peres, Yassir Arafat, Hosni Mubarak and King Hussein
is still strong. The severe setbacks of recent months have not
destroyed it.
 &HT;    But now my sympathy and condolences must go to the people of
Jordan, who I am sure will rally around their new leader, Crown
Prince Abdullah; to Queen Noor, whom Raisa and I remember fondly;
to the king's children and family. My thoughts today are about
them, and about peace in the Middle East. Its triumph will be the
best tribute to King Hussein of Jordan.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Congress must clarify role of future independent
counsels
 &HT;    By Martha Ezzard
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   One section of the independent counsel law, curiously overlooked
by Congress, ought to be activated. It calls for congressional
oversight of the conduct of the office:
</P>
<P>
   ``The appropriate committees of the Congress shall have
oversight jurisdiction with respect to the official conduct of any
independent counsel appointed under this chapter, and such
independent counsel shall have the duty to cooperate with the
exercise of such oversight jurisdiction.''
</P>
<P>
   In the post-impeachment era _ coming soon _ Congress has an
obligation to examine the conduct of Kenneth Starr on at least two
counts: first, the incessant leaks from his office that have made a
mockery of grand jury secrecy. Judge Norma Holloway Johnson
demanded some months ago that Starr show cause why he should not be
held in contempt for alleged violations of grand jury
confidentiality. Those rules are important to the fairness of our
system, since evidence can be given to a grand jury that is
hearsay, not corroborated and not admissable in court.
</P>
<P>
   Now a second contempt claim has been filed by the White House
counsel against Starr for the alleged leaking of information
relating to a possible grand jury indictment of President Clinton
before he leaves office. That leak occurred just before a crucial
Senate vote in the trial _ construed by many as an effort by
Starr's office to influence the outcome of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Starr promised once more to conduct an internal investigation.
Congress should demand to know the results.
</P>
<P>
   Second, Congress should examine whether Starr went beyond the
statutory grant of power by inserting himself in the Senate trial
phase of the process. The law only grants him the authority to send
to the House of Representatives ``substantial and credible
information ... that may constitute grounds for impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   The forefathers did not envision a government appointee with
unlimited public funds siding with one political party in an
impeachment hearing. They did not imagine an appointed prosecutor
using an immunity grant obtained by virtue of a grand jury
investigation to force a witness to testify in a Senate impeachment
trial. The law gives Starr no advocacy powers, nor any power at all
beyond sending a report to the House.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the independent counsel law is renewed or not, Congress
should clarify for posterity the line separating the House and
Senate roles in impeachment. No appointed government power, other
than the courts, can be allowed to dilute or supercede the power of
the people's elected representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional oversight has nothing to do with exonerating the
president. His dishonor is written indelibly in the history books,
as surely as is the intent of the framers that removal can only
occur for actions that endanger the nation, no other.
</P>
<P>
   If Congress doesn't act to curb the abuses of this prosecutor _
drunk with the excesses of his unchecked power _ who will?
</P>
<P>
   Not Attorney General Janet Reno, so absorbed with the literal
definitions of the law as to miss its larger meaning. Not the
three-judge panel that approved Starr's appointment knowing of the
past partisan connections that should have disqualified him.
</P>
<P>
   Only Congress can clarify for posterity that no power, other
than the elected representatives of the people, can interfere with
the constitutional process of impeachment.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Wavering on the death penalty _ again
 &HT;    (For release Wednesday, Feb. 10, 1999.)
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   I've lost track of how many times I've flip-flopped between
favoring and opposing the death penalty. Presently, I'm in my
pro-death penalty mode, but something happened last week that may
reverse that position _ again.
</P>
<P>
   Likely, there are many others such as me, torn between
permanently ridding society of criminal monsters yet fearful that
sometimes we've got the wrong guy.
</P>
<P>
   In Illinois last week, a man who has been in prison for 17
years, and was two days away from being executed last September,
was released when information, much of it obtained by a college
journalism professor and his students, surfaced that he did not
commit the murders of which he was accused.
</P>
<P>
   Critical to it was the videotaped confession of a Milwaukee man,
Alstory Simon, in the 1982 murders of two teenagers for which
Anthony Porter was convicted and sentenced to death. And critical
to that was the fact that the Milwaukee man's ex-wife came forward
to say she was present when Simon killed the two people in a
Chicago park.
</P>
<P>
   Porter was freed from prison over the weekend. He walked out,
instead of being carried out in a wooden box.
</P>
<P>
   Porter always maintained his innocence, but a jury and a judge
thought otherwise. And that's the problem with the death penalty.
Once carried out, there is no recourse. In fighting execution all
these years, Porter has been spared. Those who often argue for
swifter justice would have been dealing with a posthumous situation
today.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, I feel no apprehension about executing an open-and-shut
case; one in which a person admits to slaughtering a family, or
who, through solid scientific evidence, is found guilty.
</P>
<P>
   I am not naive enough to believe that the death penalty is a
deterrent, but I have no problem with using it as punishment _
unless we have the wrong guy. And how do we truly figure out who is
and who isn't?
</P>
<P>
   For years I had been a rigid proponent of the death penalty,
until a Florida case turned me in the other direction. In 1963, two
young blacks were arrested and charged with the murders of two
service station attendants. Under physical duress at the hands of
the police, they confessed, were convicted and sentenced to death.
</P>
<P>
   As they later declared their innocence and lodged claims of
police abuse, their case reached the public, also via probing
journalists. Freddie Pitts and Wilbur Lee spent a decade on death
row until another person confessed to the crimes. In the past year,
each received $500,000 in compensation from the Florida Legislature
for their ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   For every case of the wrong guy or guys, there are plenty of
right guys. Ted Bundy, the serial killer, couldn't have been
anything but the right guy. I shed no tears over his execution,
although the placard wavers outside the prison did.
</P>
<P>
   I suppose, to be on the safe side, I should be opposed to the
death penalty (again) _ as one wrongful execution would be a crime
in itself. But I continue to waver. Violent crime has a
stranglehold on our society and must be dealt with. While there are
those who wave off a wrongful execution as just one of those
things, I can't.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, I have no solution. Nor do our courts, our political
leaders, our law enforcement people, or the general population. It
is something we will continue to wrestle with until the last days
of civilization, which, according to some people, isn't too far
away anyhow.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: A new performer on Jordan's high wire
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The death of King Hussein of Jordan adds even more importance to
the pending Israeli national election that already was carrying
heavy political freight. The always too-eagerly centrifugal Middle
East has lost one of the key figures working effectively to keep it
from flying completely apart.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli election tests whether the strong majority of
Israelis who want peace secured can find the domestic political
means to that end. They will have to do so now in an atmosphere of
uncertainty about future relations with the one Arab treaty partner
who seemed a genuine rather than, like Egypt's Hosni Mubarak, a
grudging companion in the task.
</P>
<P>
   By temperament and training, Prince, now King, Abdullah is
committed to his father's policies. He is untested, however, and
little rehearsed in a region aprowl with political carnivores.
Syria's Hafez Assad and Iraq's Saddam Hussein, for instance, would
rather have a pliant Jordan next door than the independent Jordan
King Hussein created over nearly five decades.
</P>
<P>
   As it was of his father, a dicey balancing act will be demanded
of Abdullah, leading a population now more Palestinian than Bedouin
in a nation of few natural resources caught not just at the seam of
Arab-Israeli issues but at a crossroads of Arab national and
personal rivalries in which alliances shift and loyalties are
fungible.
</P>
<P>
   His father has left Abdullah a surprisingly strong state.
Hussein took a dubious shard from the collapsed Ottoman Empire and
by his own statecraft and will developed a genuine national
identity among peoples with no historical imperative to common
statehood.
</P>
<P>
   To accomplish that, Hussein had to survive attempted coups and
assassination plots and defeat the effort of the Palestine
Liberation Organization to take over Jordan like a parasite
engorging its host.
</P>
<P>
   Arguably, Hussein was clever, or at least lucky, even in his
mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   The doomed decision to join the Arab war against Israel in 1967
cost Jordan the West Bank and East Jerusalem, but it is doubtful
Hussein could have kept the throne if he had stayed out. And he
successfully gambled that Israel and the United States,
understanding his vulnerability to Iraq and the demands of his own
population, would forgive his neutrality in the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   The Arabist bona fides he banked with those decisions helped
Hussein bring off his decision in 1994 to surface from years of
secret contacts with Israeli leadership and sign an open peace
treaty. The pact is steadied, too, by Hussein's sound calculation
that the limited democracy he had allowed _ too limited, but that
is another story _ would do more to contain than to inflame
contrary Islamist and nationalist passions.
</P>
<P>
   In a region much bloodied from armed bravura, King Hussein
offered at the end the bravery of peace-making. His swashbuckling
rush from his sick bed last fall _ his death bed, we now know _
secured the Wye River accords and saved the failing Mideast peace
process. There was, in that one transcendent gesture, far more
heroism than in all the missile-rattling of foolish Arab
bravehearts.

OTHERS NOT SO COMPASSIONATE ON BUSH LABEL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The scene at the back gate of the Governor's
Mansion one otherwise-pleasant afternoon last week was an annoyance
for Gov. George W. Bush's security detail and a potential challenge
for his political consultants.
</P>
<P>
   Department of Public Safety officers were wrestling _ as
compassionately as could be expected _ more than a dozen
wheelchair-bound protesters who had ignored their orders to clear
the driveway.
</P>
<P>
   Hands were pried off metal bars, and, in the struggle, some
people fell from their wheelchairs to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters, who objected to Texas' official stand in a
lawsuit over living options for the disabled, were arrested and
bused off to face criminal trespass charges, and Bush's favorite
political expression was ridiculed once again.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this is compassionate conservatism, he (Bush) is in a lot
of trouble,'' said a protest leader, sitting in his wheelchair,
hands cuffed behind his back, in a can't-miss opportunity that news
cameras eagerly devoured.
</P>
<P>
   When Bush started applying the ``compassionate conservative''
label to his personal politics, he may as well have hung a ``kick
me'' sign on his back as well.
</P>
<P>
   Would-be opponents for the Republican presidential nomination
soon started taking shots at the expression, apparently believing
that ``compassionate'' was too suspicious a word for strongly
conservative Republicans who will be a major factor in nominating
their party's next presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Weasel words,'' one White House hopeful said.
</P>
<P>
   The expression also has been attacked from the opposite
direction by Vice President Al Gore, who is gearing up for the
Democratic presidential nomination and may eventually meet Bush
one-on-one.
</P>
<P>
   Gore didn't decry ``compassionate conservatism'' as such, but he
questioned Bush's credentials _ without mentioning Bush by name _
for transforming a ``pretty word'' into positive results.
</P>
<P>
   Without using the phrase, several Democratic members of the
Texas Senate also indirectly attacked Bush's ``compassionate''
capacity when they held a news conference immediately after his
State of the State speech last month to criticize the governor's
budgetary priorities.
</P>
<P>
   They said Bush, in his eagerness to enact modest tax cuts, was
giving insufficient attention to the health-care needs of children
and other important public programs.
</P>
<P>
   Then there were the wheelchair protesters outside the mansion.
</P>
<P>
   In fairness to Bush, at least one group represented in the
protest was staging demonstrations in Austin long before Bush ever
moved into the governor's office. Calling itself ADAPT _ Americans
Disabled for Attendant Programs Today _ this group, in fact, has
long been one of the more aggressive advocacy groups in town.
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, members in wheelchairs even staged an
all-night sit-in in the public reception room outside then-Gov. Ann
Richards' Capitol office. At least on one particular issue, they
were as unimpressed then with Democrat Richards' so-called ``New
Texas'' as they are now with Bush's ``compassionate conservatism.''
</P>
<P>
   ADAPT, a strong advocate of community care for the disabled,
went to the Governor's Mansion last week to protest Texas' decision
to support Georgia's appeal of a lower federal court ruling that
promotes community care.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters fear that the appeal, if upheld by the U.S.
Supreme Court, could force more people into nursing homes and other
institutions against their will.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to back Georgia in the case actually was made by
Texas Attorney General John Cornyn. But ADAPT, like many other
advocacy groups, prefers to direct its attention to the governor.
</P>
<P>
   And, for the record, Bush supported Cornyn's decision. Both men
said they didn't want the federal courts to tell Texas officials
how to plan for treatment of disabled citizens.
</P>
<P>
   The best that I can figure out is that Bush believes a
``compassionate conservative'' is someone who believes it's OK for
government to help those who need help, provided those who need
help also are willing to be ``personally responsible'' _ another
key phrase of the governor's _ and help themselves.
</P>
<P>
   I also suspect that Bush is using the label to appeal to a broad
cross section of Texans and other Americans without using the word
``moderate,'' a much-hated term on his party's right wing.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, particularly the handful out there who still admit to
being ``liberals,'' will define the label differently from Bush. So
will advocacy groups and less-compassionate Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind what the dictionary may say. Whether Bush runs for
president or decides to serve a full second term as governor,
political differences over the label will remain inevitable.

STATES RAISE OBJECTIONS TO ID COMPANY BUYING DRIVER'S LICENSE
PHOTOS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KIM COBB 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It looked like just the latest retailing gimmick _ use a check
or credit card at a store equipped with ``True ID'' and the clerk
could call up a tiny, computerized photo to verify the identity of
the purchaser. Very high-tech, very clever.
</P>
<P>
   But in the past two weeks, residents in South Carolina, Florida
and Colorado were infuriated to learn that this new system is built
on driver's license photos and related personal information
purchased from the states' motor vehicle bureaus.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the states are now in court and all three are trying to
cancel contracts that critics say were at best ill-advised, and
perhaps unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with Image Data, the fledgling New Hampshire company
marketing the True ID system, say it's all a misunderstanding. Only
people's photographs will be available to retailers, said company
spokeswoman Lorna Christie _ not the other information printed on
the driver's license.
</P>
<P>
   ``Much of the controversy has been based on misperception of
what our company is providing,'' Christie said. ``We understand
we've got a unique business model.''
</P>
<P>
   But Tulane University law professor and constitutional privacy
expert M. David Gelfand predicted the squalls surrounding True ID
may result in laws that could prevent states from selling this
information _ regardless of assurances as to how it will be used.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's going on here ... is not too different from what people
are complaining about their credit cards _ that they're selling
information about them,'' Gelfand said. ``It seems particularly
questionable for government to be engaged in the same process.
</P>
<P>
   ``The deal (between citizen and government) is in order to get a
driver's license, you have to give up this information. Then this
information is being distributed well beyond the group that needs
it. You can understand why a police officer needs it.''
</P>
<P>
   Company lore says founder Bob Houvener hatched the plan for True
ID after being victimized by credit-card fraud. Identity fraud has
cost consumers more than $25 billion in the United States, Christie
said, and the crime continues to grow at 12 percent to 17 percent
per year.
</P>
<P>
   While the most frequent situation may be simple credit card
theft, Christie said, a thief will sometimes take on the
card-holder's entire identity, buying a house or even landing a job
under the assumed name.
</P>
<P>
   Image Data sought legislative changes in Colorado, Florida and
South Carolina to pave the way for buying the driver's license data
and photos. Image Data has since contracted to pay $140,000 to
Florida for the driver's license information, $128,000 to Colorado
and $5,000 to South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   The True ID system is in place only as a pilot program provided
at no charge to 10 retailers in South Carolina. Clerks either use a
credit card or check to call up a small photo that Image Data
claims cannot be printed or downloaded before it disappears within
eight seconds.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the information (addresses and, in some cases,
Social Security numbers found on driver's license applications)
would be used by Image Data only to verify that the correct photo
is being displayed, company spokeswoman Christie said.
</P>
<P>
   Unauthorized users would not be able to ``hack'' either the
photographs or the data, Christie said, adding that Image Data uses
the same level of encryption used by international banks and
financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
   In Florida, three lawyers filed suit recently to block the
contract, and say they will pursue the case as a class action. Gov.
Jeb Bush canceled the contract a few hours after a Seminole County
judge issued a temporary injunction prohibiting Image Data from
using the license photos.
</P>
<P>
   In Colorado, legislative leaders have agreed to introduce
legislation to repeal the 1997 law that authorized the state's
Division of Motor Vehicles to sell the photos. Gov. Bill Owens has
said he thinks they can legally suspend the contract until a
legislative ban is passed.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina Attorney General Charlie Condon went to court
last week to request a temporary injunction blocking his state's
contract, but a ruling is not expected until next week. Condon
learned of his state's agreement with Image Data after reading
about it in local news coverage, an office spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Condon spokesman Tom Landes said South Carolina's enabling
legislation was passed as part of a general appropriations bill,
and that many state lawmakers now say they did not know it was
included.
</P>
<P>
   But Christie said, ``I can tell you that we had numerous
meetings with officials and organizations in each state that talked
about our service.''
</P>
<P>
   Christie said she could not comment on whether the company is
considering its own legal action to enforce the contracts.

IMPEACHMENT ENTERS WILD BUT PREDICTABLE ENDGAME

<P>
   It's apparent that U.S. House managers _ and even lead
prosecutor Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill. _ finally see that President
Clinton won't be a convicted on either of the two articles of
impeachment. So, they have begun a whisper campaign. The managers
imply that the House impeachment investigation turned up
``evidence,'' now kept in sealed documents, about Clinton groping
Kathleen Willey and about other women who were sexually harassed by
Clinton when he was the governor of Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   Sure. And there's a man outside a casino in Las Vegas who will
sell you a fool-proof way to win at roulette.
</P>
<P>
   In one of Hyde's rare moments of being candid, last week, he
pleaded for live testimony saying, ``We just need new evidence.''
New evidence for what? To convict, obviously. In other words, even
Hyde admits that the case the House brought to the Senate doesn't
have sufficient proof that Clinton committed perjury or obstruction
of justice.
</P>
<P>
   The House impeachment managers were hoping something dramatic
would break in live testimony before the Senate, but that door was
shut tight by a vote of the Senate. Then they hoped something would
leap out of the depositions taken of Monica Lewinsky, Vernon Jordan
and Sidney Blumenthal. Nothing did. No new evidence.
</P>
<P>
   House manager Rep. James Rogan, R-Calif., in order to ratchet up
moral outrage, described Lewinsky in the videotape of her
deposition as ``a young woman, very much like a family member we
might know.'' Other impeachment managers spoke of her innocence and
youth. Not one mentioned that Lewinsky had a lengthy affair with a
married man while she attend college at Lewis and Clark in
Portland, Ore. Not one mentioned, as the Oregonian reported in late
October, that Lewinsky had forged a dean's name on a letter to get
extra paid work for her married lover.
</P>
<P>
   Innocence?
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks various right-wing kooks have sprayed their
warped email across the Internet. They claim that Clinton fathered
a child with a black prostitute. That he had Vincent Foster killed.
That Clinton raped several women before he became president. That
he is guilty of treason for trading missile technology to China.
Worse, that Clinton is a womanizer _ and for such a sin alone
should be impeached.
</P>
<P>
   Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr let it be known that he may
decide to bring criminal charges against Clinton before the
president leaves office. His timing was critical to turning up the
heat on the president and the Senate. In effect, Starr was saying
to those senators who are reluctant to convict Clinton on the
unconvincing evidence presented to them: Look again, there's more
than enough to convict Clinton in a criminal trial.
</P>
<P>
   If Starr really intends to bring criminal charges against
Clinton while the president is still in office, he is wading in
unknown waters. While some constitutional scholars may consider
that possible, the intent of the framers is clear _ impeachment is
the only way to topple a sitting president. A criminal trial will
have to wait until Clinton is no longer president.
</P>
<P>
   And now GOP Senate conservatives want to have Clinton found
guilty _ without convicting him of the articles of impeachment.
That's what a ``finding of fact resolution'' means _ and a
resolution only needs a majority vote to pass. In other words, the
55 Republicans in the Senate can vote in favor of a resolution that
claims the president is guilty since they can't convince enough
Democrats to vote to convict the president. Guilty, but not guilty.
Clearly, such a resolution would go beyond the impeachment
authority granted to the Senate by the U.S. Constitution _ and far
beyond America's sense of fair play. Either Clinton is guilty or
he's not guilty. He can't be both.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile the American public has quietly been telling the
Republican Party to knock it off or pay the consequences in the
next election.
</P>
<P>
   Listen up, Republicans. This isn't an idle threat. Shut the
impeachment down, or be shut down yourselves.

GEEZERS ON THE GO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Wednesay Feb. 10)  
 By DAVID GRIMES   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   While you were napping, the United Nations declared 1999 the
International Year of Older Persons.
</P>
<P>
   As someone who is hurtling toward Older Person status at the
speed one normally associates with rogue asteroids, this
declaration does not come a moment too soon. If the United Nations
had waited much longer, I might have whizzed right past Older
Person status and gone directly to Gibbering Geezer or, worse yet,
Lawn Bowler.
</P>
<P>
   Sarasota, of course, is absolutely lousy with Older Persons to
the point that you can hardly throw an empty Metamucil bottle out
your car window without smacking one in the head. (Lame joke: If
you want to start a stampede in a Sarasota movie house, you don't
yell ``Fire!'' You yell ``Viagra!'')
</P>
<P>
   Older Persons, at least of the Sarasota variety, are quite
active and engaged and much too busy to give the United Nations a
day of their time, much less a year. If your idea of an alert Older
Person is someone who can rock and drool at the same time, you need
to get a load of the old folks from Sarasota. They run marathons,
play championship golf and tennis, write novels, play in jazz
bands, go to college and just generally make us younger folk feel
like soggy Kleenex.
</P>
<P>
   I used to look forward to being an Older Person, but now I'm not
sure if I have the stamina. As someone who gets dizzy bending over
to pick up the morning newspaper, it's hard to imagine turning 65
and suddenly feeling the urge to skydive, water-ski or scuba-dive.
</P>
<P>
   Retirement, Sarasota-style, is a lot more than wandering around
in your bathrobe mumbling to yourself; it's a full-time job that
requires energy and commitment. The situation is only going to get
worse once the United Nations' message of empowered
senior-citizenship gets around.
</P>
<P>
   The way I look at it, there is already too much pressure on
Older Persons without the United Nations getting into the act. The
first question that's asked of a person approaching his or her 65th
birthday is, ``What are you going to do when you retire?''
Somewhere along the line the definition of retirement changed from
``to stop doing'' to ``to start doing'' and the whole idea of
retirement has been a lot less attractive ever since.
</P>
<P>
   The old notion of retirement as ``long days of nothing special
interrupted by frequent naps'' has no relevance in today's society.
Retirees often find themselves working harder for longer hours
(and, of course, lower pay) than they did when they held the
stressful, full-time jobs they were so anxious to quit.
</P>
<P>
   It's nice to think of retirement as a time when the most
strenuous thing you have to do is scuff out to the kitchen for a
fresh cup of tea, but the reality is far less relaxed. In Sarasota,
many Older Persons fill their time doing volunteer work, performing
in community theater, becoming active in local politics or
otherwise flitting about in a decidedly un-old-fogeyish way. While
I have no quarrel with Older Persons who wish to remain active to
the point of carrying their own coffins, I don't think there should
be a stigma attached to Older Persons who prefer that their
retirement years proceed at a more leisurely pace.
</P>
<P>
   Although the folks at the United Nations may think otherwise,
there is nothing wrong with an Older Person going through an entire
day without doing anything that promotes his or her physical or
mental well-being or results in the betterment of mankind. If all
you managed to do in the last 24 hours was feed yourself and hit
the mute button when the Jerry Springer show came on, you should
not feel that you squandered your time.
</P>
<P>
   Life, after all, can be very pleasurable if you don't let your
retirement get in the way.
</P>

Senate will vote this week against throwing Bill Clinton out of the
White House. This probably will be your fault. Or, more precisely,
it'll be the fault of people who think the way you think, which is
most people. When you pluck away the feathers _ and, man, have we
had feathers flying around in this one _ the naked corpse of their
argument shapes up like this. By DAN LYNCH.
</P>
<P>
   LEBRUN-ACQUIT (Albany, N.Y.) _ That guy who yelled at the Senate
to vote and get it over with was speaking for Americans from coast
to coast, for the vast majority of us. Which is a great deal more
than you can say for the Republicans in Congress who deliberately
turned their backs on the people to indulge themselves in a
relentless partisan hounding of the President while cloaking the
shameless process with a mythical higher calling. By FRED LeBRUN.
</P>
<P>
   ROBISON-COLUMN (Austin, Texas) _ When Texas Gov. George W. Bush
started applying the ``compassionate conservative'' label to his
personal politics, he may as well have hung a ``kick me'' sign on
his back as well. By CLAY ROBISON

 &HT;    Aging population will change America's `youth' culture
 &HT;    By Marilyn Geewax
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Thousands of years ago, when cave-dwelling families
clustered around glowing fires, they could see that life had a
natural order: Young adults did most of the hunting and gathering
for food. Lots of children scampered around. And a few old gray
heads helped watch over the babies.
</P>
<P>
   That's the order most people still want to see, with the family
focused on parents and children. Grandparents and elderly aunts and
uncles are in the picture, but toward the edges.
</P>
<P>
   But as we move into the 21st century, that ``natural'' order
will be overturned in industrialized countries, where the elderly
soon will outnumber the children.
</P>
<P>
   As we advance further into the new century, family trees may no
longer branch out with siblings and cousins. Instead, they could
grow like tall, skinny pines, with parents, grandparents,
great-grandparents and even great-great-grandparents stacked up on
top of just a few children.
</P>
<P>
   This megachange is coming because people with access to modern
medical care are living much longer. At the same time, our
urban-oriented economy, with its plentiful jobs for women, is
discouraging young adults from planning big families. As the 20th
century comes to an end, we are moving into a world that has never
existed, one where old people will dominate and babies will be
rare.
</P>
<P>
   In his new book, ``Gray Dawn: How the Coming Age Wave Will
Transform America and the World,'' economist Peter G. Peterson
calls this shift one of the ``great hazards in the next century.''
</P>
<P>
   But why are old people a hazard? Because they do not work as
much as young people, which means they don't contribute much in
income taxes. Economists say it's not possible for a small number
of workers to support a large numbers of retirees collecting
benefits from Social Security and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike global warming, says Peterson, this hazard is not just a
hypothesis. It's an inevitability. The key players already are
here: They're the baby boomers.
</P>
<P>
   In the affluent countries of North America and Western Europe,
and in Japan and Australia, the enormous generation born in the two
decades following World War II is making its way through middle
age. In another decade, this massive group will begin to retire.
And because of medical advances, many of them will live for decades
beyond age 65.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, fertility rates have fallen so sharply that many
industrialized countries are now running below the ``replacement
rate'' necessary to replenish today's population.
</P>
<P>
   The imbalance between the number of old people and young will
become extreme in the first half of the new century. Just 40 years
from now, the United States will have four retirees for every one
person of college age. If our state and federal coffers are being
used to support those retirees, will there be any money left to
help students with tuition?
</P>
<P>
   This year, Congress may finally begin to grapple with this
immense demographic problem when it addresses Social Security
reform. Most economists say that unless old-age benefits are
trimmed or taxes are raised, the system will collapse in the next
century.
</P>
<P>
   But the aging of the population will do far more than just crimp
Social Security. Culturally, it may be difficult to adjust to
living in a society with far more grandparents than grandchildren,
far more funerals than baptisms.
</P>
<P>
   Americans may have an especially hard time giving up their youth
culture. As a nation of immigrants, we have always had a steady
supply of young workers to fill farms and factories. The relative
youth of our population contributed to a risk-taking culture, with
high levels of worker mobility and optimism. With its population
aging, the country may become less entrepreneurial.
</P>
<P>
   As the gray dawn breaks, we will wake up in a new world where
family life will be radically different from anything ever
experienced by humans.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Driver photos on a screen near you
 &HT;    By Mark Lane
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ The Mark Lane photographed by the Florida
Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles had just come in
out of the wind. Judging from his hair, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike me, he always wears a tie. That's because people who need
to look at driver's licenses are usually seeking reassurance. We
live in a society that finds men in ties reassuring. At least,
compared to men in, say, Metallica T-shirts.
</P>
<P>
   This Mark Lane's signature appears beneath him. That is not
reassuring. You could mistake it for an electrocardiogram with bad
news for a heart patient.
</P>
<P>
   The driver's license Mark Lane exists not only in my wallet but
in the vast data storehouses of the Florida Department of Highway
Safety and Motor Vehicles. That Mark Lane is in demand right now.
He's worth only a penny, but he has lots of company.
</P>
<P>
   Until last week, the Florida Department of Highway Safety and
Motor Vehicles was selling driver's license photos to Image Data
Corp., a New Hampshire-based company. The contract would have sold
14 million bad photographs of Florida drivers for $140,000. About
35,000 were delivered. I don't know if the dapper, tie-wearing Mark
Lane made the cut.
</P>
<P>
   Image Data has been buying driver's license photos in South
Carolina, Colorado and Florida. It plans to create a computerized
system to help retailers make sure that customers opening their
checkbooks and wallets are who they they claim to be.
</P>
<P>
   I could show up at a cash register unshaven and wearing a black
Metallica T-shirt, but when the clerk punches my name in the
system, the respectable if wind-blown, tie-wearing Mark Lane would
appear on the screen. Check approved.
</P>
<P>
   This all seems very Jetsonslike and probably represents huge
progress. But, there are buts.
</P>
<P>
   So many, that Florida Gov. Jeb Bush last week ended the state's
contract with the firm.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's decision won applause because most folks felt a line had
been crossed. Not a bright yellow line, but one of those fuzzy,
foggy frontiers. Privacy lines tend to be like that.
</P>
<P>
   Driver's license information already is available to anyone who
wants it. Insurance companies and mass mailers have been buying
lists of drivers for years. It's public record. Everyone paid for
it. Everyone can look at it.
</P>
<P>
   All true. But now photographs are involved and the issues
somehow aren't the same. Your face. Your photograph. Taken on a
bad-hair day. Eyes stupidly wide because the flash went off a
moment before you expected. This photo miniature now can appear at
a moment's notice whenever a teen-age discount-store clerk beckons
it. She will tap in your name and giggle to herself at the image
filling the screen.
</P>
<P>
   Kind of humbling, isn't it?
</P>
<P>
   An average person who has lived a tolerably full life has far
more damaging documents hidden somewhere than a driver's license
photograph taken on a windy day. My taxi driver's license, my
divorce papers, my high school Permanent Record ... . But they're
different. They're in file cabinets. Safe from store clerks.
</P>
<P>
   Computerization means bad things that used to be safely entombed
in musty basement file cabinets can be in the electronic equivalent
of thousands of file cabinets in thousands of places.
</P>
<P>
   In the file-cabinet era, judges and lawyers talked about privacy
as ``the right to be left alone.''
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't quite cover it. We are left alone when our mugs
are whizzing though cyberspace. But it still doesn't feel right.
</P>
<P>
   In the clerk-laughing-at-your-driver's-license-on-a-screen era,
privacy means something else. The right to be anonymous. The right
not to be turned into electronic data without our knowledge. The
right not to be embarrassed at cash registers.
</P>
<P>
   And the right not to have your face turn up as a commodity,
bought and sold by people you don't know. Unless you're Cindy
Crawford or somebody like that. And I'm not.
</P>
<P>
   That's a lot of luggage for one small word to carry. Like art
and pornography, a privacy violation is something you recognize
when you see it. And seeing my tie-wearing, wind-blown, smiling
self on a little screen at the Pump `N' Pay qualifies. But don't
ask me why.

 &HT;    Taking a cue from the 'gators
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ It's just after sunrise beside a still lake
in central Florida. My companion and I are sitting on the end of a
weather_beaten dock, sipping the morning's first cup of decaf and
settling in for some serious 'gator watching. It doesn't take long.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's one,'' he whispers and hands me the binoculars as he
points. ``Over there in the sawgrass.'' I focus on what looks like
a log with a big knot on one end and can't help thinking how
natural it seems to be silent in such a place. I wonder if it's
because we don't want to spook the wildlife or if it's just
reverence for the serenity we might be disrupting.
</P>
<P>
   The log swings a little to its right and blinks an eye. ``Don't
move,'' my friend cautions. ``If we're still, he'll think we're
just part of the scenery.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Or breakfast,'' I can't resist adding under my breath as I
ease my feet up under me.
</P>
<P>
   My old friend chuckles soundlessly. ``You've been away from home
too long,'' he says with a grin. ``That 'gator isn't going to
bother you. He's got other things on his mind.'' I ask him like
what and he says like maybe girl 'gators. I zoom in for a better
look and shake my head.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too ugly,'' I say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe by people standards,'' he says, ``but to some lady
'gator, he could be a crusty old dreamboat.'' I refocus for a
double check. No way.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few feet away we hear a gentle ``ploosh'' as a great blue
heron wades into the reeds. Soon, a coot paddles past, just inches
from the 'gator. I hold my breath but nothing happens. The bird
swims on unmolested.
</P>
<P>
   As we sit still and watch, I can't help thinking how lucky we
are _ two Florida crackers enjoying what remains of our home
state's wild country. It's sad to know there are whole generations
of folks growing up where we did, on the edge of the Everglades,
who have never experienced the nature we took for granted. The
smart creatures, the lucky ones, have retreated deeper into the
swamp _ the less adaptable ones into oblivion. I can't help
thinking that could be true about people too. My friend and I have
known both kinds.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the days when alligators were on the endangered species
list (along with scrub jays, Key deer, and the Florida panther), my
friend tells me that poachers used to meet late at night in the
many hammocks that ring the Everglades, under the pretense of going
frog gigging. He says it was easy to tell the poachers from the
giggers _ poachers always had new pickup trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Florida alligators, I'm told, are now considered a renewable
resource. I guess that means there are enough to go around so folks
can start wearing them on their feet again.
</P>
<P>
   Another bumpy log moves into sight, not too far from where an
anhinga stands knee-deep in a floating island of hyacinths,
apparently uninterested in the two water snakes undulating past
him. ``He's a snakebird,'' I whisper, ``so why isn't he grabbing
one of them for breakfast?'' My companion tells me the bird may not
be hungry and, unlike humans, doesn't view his lake as the
drive-thru lane of a fast food restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   The second 'gator is a lot bigger than the first. I ask if he's
going to eat the snakebird. Probably not, my friend says and
reminds me these creatures don't kill for pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   He's right. The big bird is obviously alert but unafraid as he
opens his wings to dry in the warming sun. The 'gator watches for a
few minutes and then closes both eyes as the rest of the lake gets
on with the business of daily living.
</P>
<P>
   There's a lesson to be learned here, but the morning is too
relaxed for deep thought. Instead, I make like a 'gator and stretch
out in the sun, chuckling as I conjure up a picture of alligators
wearing ``people-skin'' shoes to the yacht club dance. Quickly, I
remind myself that'll never happen. They're way too smart to go
around acting like humans.

 &HT;    Texas has chance to improve on schools' 'end-all' measurement
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ This is a message best screened from
schoolchildren in Texas, lest they stampede in the streets, turn
over cars and set enough victory bonfires to blind a space shuttle
crew.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime in the next three years, TAAS will be no more.
</P>
<P>
   That's the Texas Assessment of Academic Skills, the bane of
every school child, rich or poor, bright or struggling, the bane of
parents, of teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, that TAAS _ the same one viewed by some observers as the
best thing Texas has done for education in a millenium or so.
</P>
<P>
   If current legislation before the Texas Legislature passes,
Texas will take a pencil and mark through TAAS.
</P>
<P>
   I meant it when I told you to screen the children from this. For
now, kids, comes the bad news. As TAAS fades to No. 2 black, a
successor will emerge, likely under a new name. It will be more
comprehensive, involving more subjects, and testing 120,000 more
students.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the contingency for which officials here at the Texas
Education Agency now prepare.
</P>
<P>
   Reforms in Senate Bill 1 would expand and broaden state testing
in the fall of 2002. The current exit test is given starting in
10th grade. Under SB 1, authored by Sen. Teel Bivins, R-Amarillo,
and promoted by Education Commissioner Mike Moses, graduation would
hinge on a new 11th-grade exit test. Other reforms would include
testing for science in grades five, seven, and 10 (currently
science is tested only in grade eight), and social studies in
grades four, eight and 10 (currently only eighth-graders take a
social studies TAAS.)
</P>
<P>
   Students would be tested at reading and math in grades three
through 11. Currently ninth-graders statewide do not take TAAS. The
writing portion would be expanded to include grade six (in addition
to the current testing in grades four, eight and 10.)
</P>
<P>
   As with everything involving TAAS, this carries as much dread as
promise, and potentially as much drag as it would provide a boost.
Most educators, if they are honest, will assert that TAAS has
become the engine that drives most wheels in Texas public schools,
and that's not good. It's dehumanizing for teachers. It undermines
the lively arts and the study of history, science and all else that
would take time away from ``the basics'' _ as if history, science
and social studies don't qualify as that.
</P>
<P>
   Worst of all, by focusing so heavily on the basics, and making a
test of minimum grade-level skills the holy grail of
accountability, Texas by design deprives students who would thrive
in more rarefied conditions. Texas thinks it is doing its best when
it rings the bell with rising TAAS scores. Actually it is only
bragging that more and more students can rise to a common
denominator that's too low to rank as excellence.
</P>
<P>
   So what do we do?
</P>
<P>
   We raise the common denominator, for one, make TAAS more
rigorous, even if it means lowering the score needed to pass.
</P>
<P>
   For another, we make it possible for some students to shed the
back-to-basics yoke throughout the year if they can demonstrate off
the bat in the fall that they have a command of grade-level basics.
Yes, let them test out of eight months of TAAS preparation.
</P>
<P>
   We make math tests that reflect true grade-level mastery. We
make composition tests real tests of real writing rather than the
gauge used today that amounts to grading a child for a rough draft
and encourages formula regurgitation.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, we need to come to grips with the rampant,
blood-sucking, mind-numbing plague that is education driven by a
test, and return to testing that's driven by education.
</P>
<P>
   Any of these objectives, if met, would be worth victory
bonfires. In three upcoming columns, I will light a few candles.

 &HT;    Won't you be my online valentine?
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Valentine's Day _ in theory at least _ should be one
of the most personal holidays on the calendar. It should be a time
to turn off the computer and take the person you love to a
restaurant, buy flowers, send notes written in longhand and, my
gosh, hug.
</P>
<P>
   But in this cyber-world, there are complications.
</P>
<P>
   There may be people whom you'd like to take to dinner, but _
because of distance or circumstances _ cannot. Or perhaps your
excuse is even more flimsy _ maybe you just flat forgot to buy the
candy or the card and need a last-minute way to say ``I care.''
</P>
<P>
   You'll have to decide for yourself if an electronic greeting
from the Internet has the warmth and feeling you would like to
convey. For some folks, it would be better to just pick up the
phone instead. But if your valentine would enjoy an electronic
greeting, then the Web can furnish plenty of choices.
</P>
<P>
   The first site on our tour of love offers electronic greeting
cards for free. You'll find all types, including cards customized
for Valentine's Day, as well as cards for friends, lovers, bosses,
casual acquaintances (why the heck are you sending them a card
anyway?) and almost any other occasion or relationship possible.
It's called Blue Mountain and is located at
http://www1.bluemountain.com.
</P>
<P>
   Just click on the category of card you'd like to send,
personalize the message and push the button. Your greetings arrive
almost instantly. And there are cards in other languages. In this
wide world, that's a handy thing to have. There's no charge at all.
</P>
<P>
   The next site isn't free, but it's worth mentioning since it
offers to send real paper greeting cards for you. Just select the
card online and give the address. You'll find the site at
http://sparks.com. Prices vary, but most of the cards, including
mailing, go for about $2.75. If a card isn't enough, you can also
send other gifts, including chocolates, from the same site.
</P>
<P>
   But what do you do for the unconventional valentines on your
list? One thing, for those who have an out-of-this-world valentine,
is to send one of the science-fiction-oriented Valentine's Day
cards from 3D Adventure at
http://www.dair3.com/greeting/valentin.cgi. Some of the cards are
really quite beautiful, and many include animation.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all these sites work in the same general way. You select
a category, click on the card that you like, furnish your e-mail
address and the address of your valentine, and the card is sent. In
almost every case, your recipient will need access to the World
Wide Web to view the card. So if the person you care about has
access to e-mail only, perhaps you should try sending a personal
message, instead of an e-card.
</P>
<P>
   A personal favorite is a Web site called Regards.Com. It's also
free and _ as you would expect _ includes an assortment of
ready-made Valentine's Day cards. But if you have a Web site, you
can use Regards to send a greeting card that includes an electronic
image or photograph.
</P>
<P>
   Just place the image or photograph on your own Web space and
then fill in the blanks at Regards to include that image in a
customized card. If you don't have a Web site, you can also include
Web addresses for images that you've found on other sites.
</P>
<P>
   If none of these sites suit you, simply do a search for ``free
electronic greeting cards,'' and you'll find literally hundreds of
other places that offer everything from sweet sentiments to racy
adult-oriented cards. And keep in mind that there's still plenty of
time to do something really crazy: Buy a real card and send it
through the mail.

 &HT;    Microsoft Encarta African-- a distinguished addition to software
targeting African-Americans
 &HT;    WITH PHOTO; TECH-CENTERPIECE-SIDE
 &HT;    By Shelia M. Poole
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Walk the bustling streets of Timbuktu.
</P>
<P>
   Trace the trans-Atlantic slave routes and learn about customs
that survive today and can be traced directly to Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Listen to the gravelly voice of Louis ``Satchmo'' Armstrong belt
out ``Back O' Town Blues'' during a 1965 performance.
</P>
<P>
   All with a mouse click.
</P>
<P>
   Those and other features are now available on Microsoft Encarta
Africana software, which was released on the Rev. Martin Luther
King Jr.'s birthday.
</P>
<P>
   ``A tree needs plants to grow, and we need a sense of who we
are,'' said G. Ewa Ealy, co-manager and special events coordinator
for the Shrine of the Black Madonna bookstore in Atlanta who plans
to carry the product. ``I don't think you can underestimate the
potential this product has to our community and to our world.''
</P>
<P>
   Encarata Africana, which sells for $70, offers a groundbreaking,
comprehensive encyclopedia of Africans and people of African
descent throughout the world _ from the shores of Africa to the
United States, the Caribbean, South America and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   The idea was the brainchild of Dr. Louis Henry Gates Jr., noted
author and chairman of the Afro-American Studies department at
Harvard University, and Dr. Kwame Anthony Appiah, professor of
Afro-American Studies and Philosophy at Harvard University.
</P>
<P>
   The two made a pact 25 years ago that they would bring the dream
of W.E.B. DuBois, a leading African-American scholar of the 20th
century, to produce a comprehensive encyclopedia of Africana.
</P>
<P>
   The first companies they approached about the project _ then as
a book _ were lukewarm.
</P>
<P>
   They were told by one company it was ``not economically viable''
and were asked if Gates could possibly raise $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   They struck gold, however, when an executive at Random House
suggested doing the project on CD-ROM. With financial backing from
the likes of composer Quincy Jones and others, they came up with a
prototype. But even with a good prototype, they continued to hit
snags.
</P>
<P>
   Once, they were told the timing was off and that it might work
better as a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could have cried,'' said co-editor Gates. ``They all said,
`Great project, but its not commercially viable.'''
</P>
<P>
   Enter Microsoft. The parties got together, and soon plans were
made to launch Encarta Africana.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing quite like this out there,'' said Gates, who
said the editors and publishers are making a concerted effort to
reach schools, churches and universities. ``This is the whole black
world. This is the bottom line. We want to make the African and
African-American experience a fundamental part of the fabric of
culture itself, of knowledge itself and of education itself. Not
just something that is done in the coldest, darkest, dampest month
of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   He said talks are under way about a second version, which will
be ``bigger and badder'' than the first.
</P>
<P>
   While much of the attention has been focused on Encarta
Africana, other software titles are available that either target
African-Americans or address some aspect of African-American
culture and history.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the Learning Co. last summer published Essence
Virtual Makeover, beauty software created specifically for
African-American women. The software, created in conjunction with
Essence magazine, has gotten off to a good start. Learning
officials say it is the seventh-best-selling product in its
category, personal improvement.
</P>
<P>
   Users load a photo into their computer and within minutes can
try out hundreds of different hairstyles, hair colors, cosmetics
and contact lenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has done pretty well considering it has a smaller
demographic target than a lot of our software,'' said Pamela Sooge,
vice president of lifestyles. ``We estimate that 2 million
African-American women use computers at home.''
</P>
<P>
   The project made sense, Sooge said, considering on average
African-American women spend more on hair care and cosmetics than
their white counterparts. But that was not being addressed in
previous computer makeover products. African-American women found a
very limited number of styles that would fit them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main issue really comes down to PC penetration and
purchasing behavior, and that will grow obviously as there are more
computers in those households,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Other programs available include:
</P>
<P>
   _ Black Wings: The program chronicles African-Americans in
aviation. Black Wings is a joint project of the National Aerospace
Museum and Fairfax, Va.-based SSB Inc. It was released in 1996 and
includes interviews with many of the original Tuskegee airmen and
information on aviators in the Korean and Vietnam wars, then takes
users into the space age. $39.99
</P>
<P>
   _ Clip Art With Color Volumes I-IV: Published by Gikuuri
Software, this series contains more than 300 color images of
African-Americans in different settings. The images can be used in
newsletters, invitations and brochures. $29.99-$49.99
</P>
<P>
   _ Encyclopedia Britannica Profiles Black History: This software
program answers such questions as what was the Dred Scott decision?
When were the Fugitive Slave Acts passed? This interactive program
contains time lines, more than 500 articles, 275 photographs and
audio and video clips. $29.99
</P>
<P>
   While these and other black-oriented software programs have
gotten a thumbs up from many, others bemoan the dearth of computer
products that specifically target African-Americans or that include
African-Americans in prominent roles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably an issue of critical mass,'' said Patrick
McElroy, president of the Freedom Group, an Atlanta-based Internet
consulting firm and owner of EverythingBlack.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are a company with $20 million in overhead a year, it's
probably not worth your while to do Afrocentric software
exclusively. But if you're a one- or two-person shop, obviously you
can make enough money to pay expenses and have some extra.
Oftentimes we are underserved because we are waiting for some big
corporation to satisfy a niche when perhaps a niche player should
come in and take care of that need.''

<P>
   ATLANTA _ For some, the arrival of February _ Black History
Month _ used to mean countless hours in the library searching for
information on such figures as Paul Robeson, Madame C.J. Walker and
Bessie Smith.
</P>
<P>
   But today, students and parents have another reference point _
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people are trying to have a career and be parents at the
same time,'' said Camille Binder, whose 5-year-old son, Chaunce,
uses his computer to learn more about notable black personalities.
``You can't pick your child up at 6 p.m. and then head to the
library. It's easier to do it at home on the Internet. It works
better for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Binder recently used the Internet to help Chaunce, who attends
private school, find information on poet/author Maya Angelou.
</P>
<P>
   A number of sites have special Black History Month issues.
Others that typically target African-American users and just expand
their offerings this month are good resources anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone puts special emphasis on February.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's black history every day with us,'' said Patrick McElroy,
president of the Atlanta-based Freedom Group, an Internet
consulting firm that launched EverythingBlack.com in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The site, which McElroy claims get 2,500 visitors daily,
contains information on such areas of interest as Africa, black
history, literature, politics and business.
</P>
<P>
   ``When major corporations turn their focus away from
African-American history at the end of the month, we will still be
there.''
</P>

 &HT;    How to get the maximum out of your PC
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ You've just bought a new PC, but it's no time to relax
and celebrate. At least not until you've probably souped it up like
a jalopy of yesteryear. The February issue of Maximum PC features
an article with 30 tips on how to sharpen the performance of a new
PC. Among the magazine's tips: Removing little-used files,
scheduling regular tune-ups and deleting a program called AOL
Messenger.
</P>
<P>
   In the past 17 years, Mike Bloomberg has turned himself into a
``baron of real-time financial news.'' But has the baron lost his
touch? Is he in danger of losing out to new up-and-comers? The
February issue of Wired magazine raises that question about
Bloomberg and the financial computers that carry his name.
</P>
<P>
   ON CD-ROM
</P>
<P>
   Bulldog Productions doesn't pull punches in describing the
latest version of its computer CD game ``Populous.'' Its promotion
tag line says, ``Feel the divine power, enforce your omnipotent
influence.'' In this game, players create their own world, command
its subjects and punish them if they get out of line. What's new
about this latest version of ``Populous'' is 3-D graphics and lots
of new powers.

<P>
   Keep track of the maintenance of your car through a CD-ROM
called Peak Performance v4.11. It lets you record and schedule all
service appointments. You can track oil changes and monitor the
wear and tear on your car. Peak Performance also lets you print out
customizable reports on maintenance history.

   ONLINE

<P>
   Preschoolers can learn about animals at a nifty new site
maintained by Public Broadcasting. It's called ``Zoboomafoo,''
based on the TV show of the same name. You'll find the site at

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Griping is easier than doing. Action is tougher than
apathy. If you're frustrated with your congressional
representative, the school board or the condition of your roads,
you can write a letter to the editor of your newspaper or to an
elected official, or you can call. It doesn't get easier.
</P>
<P>
   Or does it? http://www.e-thepeople.com is a Web site devoted to
giving people voice. The free site has links to online petitions
that have been started concerning local and national issues. There
is also a database of 140,000 federal, state and local officials in
more than 7,000 cities. To start a petition or lodge a complaint,
enter your ZIP code, choose a topic and the site lists all the

   3-D FOR CAMCORDERS
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when shooting your own video was impressive
enough. How can you beat pictures that move? 3D Video Inc. is
selling a camcorder attachment that lets your record video in 3-D.
</P>
<P>
   The NuView SX-2000 adapter, with 3-D glasses and the equipment
to make it play 3-D images on your television, sells for $499. The
adapter requires one AAA 1.5-volt battery, which will work for more
than 60 hours.
</P>
<P>
   A reviewer in the February 1998 issue of Camcorder magazine
compared using the adapter to ``the same as seeing color television
for the first time back in the '50s ... the addition of color was a
quantum leap in enhancing the believability of the medium.''

   More information about the adapter can be found at

   COMPAQ, EBAY CUT A DEAL
</P>
<P>
   In a move that might make online auction sites as popular as
anything on the Internet, Compaq Computer will start putting eBay
icons on its PC desktops.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq will put the icon on the desktops of its Prosignia
Desktop 310 and Notebook 210 PCs. eBay will promote Compaq's
Prosignia line at trade shows this year.
</P>
<P>
   eBay is a 24-hour-a-day online auction site. It has more than
1.3 million registered users and more than 1 million items for
sale, including books, sports memorabilia and toys.
</P>
<P>
   WEB USE FIGURES TO BROADEN
</P>
<P>
   The Web might be a resource for the well-off, but that will
probably change as it grows in popularity, according to a report by
2CAN Media, an interactive media company.
</P>
<P>
   From April 1998 to October, the number of Web users grew by 17
percent to a total of 62 million, according to Media Metrix, a New
York company that tracks Web usage. About 24 percent of American
households use the Web, and it's a wealthy group. The average
household income of Web users is more than $50,000, according to
2CAN Media. Of those using the Web, 40 percent are college
graduates and 40 percent are in management or professional
positions. All figures are above the national average.
</P>
<P>
   The report states as the Web attracts more users, its
demographics will start looking more like America, with all income
levels represented.
</P>
<P>
   Web use is measured by companies like Media Metrix, which tracks
the Web action of a sample group of 40,000 users. The report
challenges the Internet industry to come up with measurement
standards more reflective of actual Web use.
</P>
<P>
   A LOOK, BUT NO SALE
</P>
<P>
   People are willing to check the Web to find out what flights are
available and other general flight information. But a study by NPD
Online Research found less than 33 percent of those who access
airline sites buy their tickets there.
</P>
<P>
   The study looked at the activities of 13,000 visitors to sites
for American, Canadian, Continental, TWA and United. Of those
polled, males were more likely to have bought a ticket from an
online site, as were people who have flown six or more flights in
the most recent 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   The study found most people were moderately satisfied with
airline sites. Only 18 percent of those polled could find the
information they were looking for every time.

 &HT;    Buy the rice, stock the pantry and sleep well at night
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ I was at a party the other night where most of the
guests were from other countries, including many from small
countries in what used to be the Communist bloc. I'm not good at
parties _ even when they are held in English _ because I am shy and
hard of hearing.
</P>
<P>
   But this was even stranger, since most of those at the party
were very formal and polite _ it's one of the cultural differences
between Americans and Eastern Europeans that seem real to me _ and
they tried hard to make me feel at home. So I wasn't suprised when
a graduate student named Vladimir found me somewhere over near the
pirogies and said:
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand that you are a computer expert. Tell me please,
whether the Year 2000 computer problem will create world
disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   I explained to Vladimir I was a computer writer, not a computer
expert. I told him being a computer writer is very much like a
sports writer. Most of us know more than the average hobbyist and a
lot less than a real computer professional. After all, when was the
last time you heard of a football team hiring a sports writer to be
the coach?
</P>
<P>
   But, with that qualification, let me tell you what I think about
the Year 2000 problem. Maybe that way, if you bump into Vladimir,
who had as much trouble understanding my thick Southern English as
I did understanding his Bulgarian-accented English, you can tell
him for me.
</P>
<P>
   First, since this is a computer column for beginners, let's be
sure you haven't lived in a cave for the past couple of years and
have somehow avoided learning about the Year 2000 problem.
Programmers, in the old days, didn't use all four digits when they
needed to include a date in a computer program. In those days,
computer memory was as scarce as June bugs in a chicken yard, so
programmers used just two digits.
</P>
<P>
   That worked reasonably well during the middle of the century,
but now that 02 could logically mean 1902 or 2002, computers get
confused. This digital confusion _ just like the human variety _
can cause all sorts of problems unrelated to the reason for the
confusion. The computer can freeze up, destroy data, do all sorts
of crazy things when it is confused. And, since computers live in
communities, just like people, one confused computer on the
network, way off in Des Moines, can wreak havoc with the others on
either the Internet or internal network.
</P>
<P>
   So far, there have been predictions of massive power outages,
food shortages, water supply problems _ it sounds very much like
the end of the world. And, to make things more frightening, many of
the predictions come from people who understand and work with
computers at a high level. So, Vladimir's question isn't a foolish
one.
</P>
<P>
   But, as it is with a lot of good questions, there is no clear
answer. Governments and big businesses are spending billions of
dollars to fix the problem (and

 &HT;    Won't you be my online valentine?
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Valentine's Day _ in theory at least _ should be one
of the most personal holidays on the calendar. It should be a time
to turn off the computer and take the person you love to a
restaurant, buy flowers, send notes written in longhand and, my
gosh, hug.
</P>
<P>
   But in this cyber-world, there are complications.
</P>
<P>
   There may be people whom you'd like to take to dinner, but _
because of distance or circumstances _ cannot. Or perhaps your
excuse is even more flimsy _ maybe you just flat forgot to buy the
candy or the card and need a last-minute way to say ``I care.''
</P>
<P>
   You'll have to decide for yourself if an electronic greeting
from the Internet has the warmth and feeling you would like to
convey. For some folks, it would be better to just pick up the
phone instead. But if your valentine would enjoy an electronic
greeting, then the Web can furnish plenty of choices.
</P>
<P>
   The first site on our tour of love offers electronic greeting
cards for free. You'll find all types, including cards customized
for Valentine's Day, as well as cards for friends, lovers, bosses,
casual acquaintances (why the heck are you sending them a card
anyway?) and almost any other occasion or relationship possible.
It's called Blue Mountain and is located at
http://www1.bluemountain.com.
</P>
<P>
   Just click on the category of card you'd like to send,
personalize the message and push the button. Your greetings arrive
almost instantly. And there are cards in other languages. In this
wide world, that's a handy thing to have. There's no charge at all.
</P>
<P>
   The next site isn't free, but it's worth mentioning since it
offers to send real paper greeting cards for you. Just select the
card online and give the address. You'll find the site at
http://sparks.com. Prices vary, but most of the cards, including
mailing, go for about $2.75. If a card isn't enough, you can also
send other gifts, including chocolates, from the same site.
</P>
<P>
   But what do you do for the unconventional valentines on your
list? One thing, for those who have an out-of-this-world valentine,
is to send one of the science-fiction-oriented Valentine's Day
cards from 3D Adventure at
http://www.dair3.com/greeting/valentin.cgi. Some of the cards are
really quite beautiful, and many include animation.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all these sites work in the same general way. You select
a category, click on the card that you like, furnish your e-mail
address and the address of your valentine, and the card is sent. In
almost every case, your recipient will need access to the World
Wide Web to view the card. So if the person you care about has
access to e-mail only, perhaps you should try sending a personal
message, instead of an e-card.
</P>
<P>
   A personal favorite is a Web site called Regards.Com. It's also
free and _ as you would expect _ includes an assortment of
ready-made Valentine's Day cards. But if you have a Web site, you
can use Regards to send a greeting card that includes an electronic
image or photograph.
</P>
<P>
   Just place the image or photograph on your own Web space and
then fill in the blanks at Regards to include that image in a
customized card. If you don't have a Web site, you can also include
Web addresses for images that you've found on other sites.
</P>
<P>
   If none of these sites suit you, simply do a search for ``free
electronic greeting cards,'' and you'll find literally hundreds of
other places that offer everything from sweet sentiments to racy
adult-oriented cards. And keep in mind that there's still plenty of
time to do something really crazy: Buy a real card and send it
through the mail.

 &HT;    Web sites also a good place to start
 &HT;    By Shelia M. Poole

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For some, the arrival of February _ Black History
Month _ used to mean countless hours in the library searching for
information on such figures as Paul Robeson, Madame C.J. Walker and
Bessie Smith.
</P>
<P>
   But today, students and parents have another reference point _
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people are trying to have a career and be parents at the
same time,'' said Camille Binder, whose 5-year-old son, Chaunce,
uses his computer to learn more about notable black personalities.
``You can't pick your child up at 6 p.m. and then head to the
library. It's easier to do it at home on the Internet. It works
better for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Binder recently used the Internet to help Chaunce, who attends
private school, find information on poet/author Maya Angelou.
</P>
<P>
   A number of sites have special Black History Month issues.
Others that typically target African-American users and just expand
their offerings this month are good resources anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone puts special emphasis on February.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's black history every day with us,'' said Patrick McElroy,
president of the Atlanta-based Freedom Group, an Internet
consulting firm that launched EverythingBlack.com in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The site, which McElroy claims get 2,500 visitors daily,
contains information on such areas of interest as Africa, black
history, literature, politics and business.
</P>
<P>
   ``When major corporations turn their focus away from
African-American history at the end of the month, we will still be
there.''
</P>
<P>
   SITES OF INTEREST
</P>
<P>
   http://scriptorium.lib.duke.edu/collections/African-American-women.h
tml _ Collection of letters and memoirs of 19th century slave woman
from Duke University.
</P>
<P>
   http://www.msn.com/schoolhouse _ For Black History Month, this
site will offer lessons and lesson plans. Also gives links to
related sites, including Encarta Africana.
</P>
<P>
   http://www.blackfamilies.com _This Cox Interactive Media site
focuses on the black family. Each day during Black History Month,
the site will feature a historical figure. Personalities to be
profiled this month include Mary McLeod Bethune and Alex Haley.
</P>
<P>
   http://www.afroam.org/history/history.html _ Afro-Americ(at)'s
Black History Month Museum offers a compilation of articles and
information on events in African-American history. Interactive.
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    Microsoft Encarta African-- a distinguished addition to software
targeting African-Americans
 &HT;    WITH PHOTO; TECH-CENTERPIECE-SIDE

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Walk the bustling streets of Timbuktu.
</P>
<P>
   Trace the trans-Atlantic slave routes and learn about customs
that survive today and can be traced directly to Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Listen to the gravelly voice of Louis ``Satchmo'' Armstrong belt
out ``Back O' Town Blues'' during a 1965 performance.
</P>
<P>
   All with a mouse click.
</P>
<P>
   Those and other features are now available on Microsoft Encarta
Africana software, which was released on the Rev. Martin Luther
King Jr.'s birthday.
</P>
<P>
   ``A tree needs plants to grow, and we need a sense of who we
are,'' said G. Ewa Ealy, co-manager and special events coordinator
for the Shrine of the Black Madonna bookstore in Atlanta who plans
to carry the product. ``I don't think you can underestimate the
potential this product has to our community and to our world.''
</P>
<P>
   Encarata Africana, which sells for $70, offers a groundbreaking,
comprehensive encyclopedia of Africans and people of African
descent throughout the world _ from the shores of Africa to the
United States, the Caribbean, South America and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   The idea was the brainchild of Dr. Louis Henry Gates Jr., noted
author and chairman of the Afro-American Studies department at
Harvard University, and Dr. Kwame Anthony Appiah, professor of
Afro-American Studies and Philosophy at Harvard University.
</P>
<P>
   The two made a pact 25 years ago that they would bring the dream
of W.E.B. DuBois, a leading African-American scholar of the 20th
century, to produce a comprehensive encyclopedia of Africana.
</P>
<P>
   The first companies they approached about the project _ then as
a book _ were lukewarm.
</P>
<P>
   They were told by one company it was ``not economically viable''
and were asked if Gates could possibly raise $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   They struck gold, however, when an executive at Random House
suggested doing the project on CD-ROM. With financial backing from
the likes of composer Quincy Jones and others, they came up with a
prototype. But even with a good prototype, they continued to hit
snags.
</P>
<P>
   Once, they were told the timing was off and that it might work
better as a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could have cried,'' said co-editor Gates. ``They all said,
`Great project, but its not commercially viable.'''
</P>
<P>
   Enter Microsoft. The parties got together, and soon plans were
made to launch Encarta Africana.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing quite like this out there,'' said Gates, who
said the editors and publishers are making a concerted effort to
reach schools, churches and universities. ``This is the whole black
world. This is the bottom line. We want to make the African and
African-American experience a fundamental part of the fabric of
culture itself, of knowledge itself and of education itself. Not
just something that is done in the coldest, darkest, dampest month
of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   He said talks are under way about a second version, which will
be ``bigger and badder'' than the first.
</P>
<P>
   While much of the attention has been focused on Encarta
Africana, other software titles are available that either target
African-Americans or address some aspect of African-American
culture and history.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the Learning Co. last summer published Essence
Virtual Makeover, beauty software created specifically for
African-American women. The software, created in conjunction with
Essence magazine, has gotten off to a good start. Learning
officials say it is the seventh-best-selling product in its
category, personal improvement.
</P>
<P>
   Users load a photo into their computer and within minutes can
try out hundreds of different hairstyles, hair colors, cosmetics
and contact lenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has done pretty well considering it has a smaller
demographic target than a lot of our software,'' said Pamela Sooge,
vice president of lifestyles. ``We estimate that 2 million
African-American women use computers at home.''
</P>
<P>
   The project made sense, Sooge said, considering on average
African-American women spend more on hair care and cosmetics than
their white counterparts. But that was not being addressed in
previous computer makeover products. African-American women found a
very limited number of styles that would fit them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main issue really comes down to PC penetration and
purchasing behavior, and that will grow obviously as there are more
computers in those households,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Other programs available include:
</P>
<P>
   _ Black Wings: The program chronicles African-Americans in
aviation. Black Wings is a joint project of the National Aerospace
Museum and Fairfax, Va.-based SSB Inc. It was released in 1996 and
includes interviews with many of the original Tuskegee airmen and
information on aviators in the Korean and Vietnam wars, then takes
users into the space age. $39.99
</P>
<P>
   _ Clip Art With Color Volumes I-IV: Published by Gikuuri
Software, this series contains more than 300 color images of
African-Americans in different settings. The images can be used in
newsletters, invitations and brochures. $29.99-$49.99
</P>
<P>
   _ Encyclopedia Britannica Profiles Black History: This software
program answers such questions as what was the Dred Scott decision?
When were the Fugitive Slave Acts passed? This interactive program
contains time lines, more than 500 articles, 275 photographs and
audio and video clips. $29.99
</P>
<P>
   While these and other black-oriented software programs have
gotten a thumbs up from many, others bemoan the dearth of computer
products that specifically target African-Americans or that include
African-Americans in prominent roles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably an issue of critical mass,'' said Patrick
McElroy, president of the Freedom Group, an Atlanta-based Internet
consulting firm and owner of EverythingBlack.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are a company with $20 million in overhead a year, it's
probably not worth your while to do Afrocentric software
exclusively. But if you're a one- or two-person shop, obviously you
can make enough money to pay expenses and have some extra.
Oftentimes we are underserved because we are waiting for some big
corporation to satisfy a niche when perhaps a niche player should
come in and take care of that need.''

 &HT;    How to get the maximum out of your PC
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ You've just bought a new PC, but it's no time to relax
and celebrate. At least not until you've probably souped it up like
a jalopy of yesteryear. The February issue of Maximum PC features
an article with 30 tips on how to sharpen the performance of a new
PC. Among the magazine's tips: Removing little-used files,
scheduling regular tune-ups and deleting a program called AOL
Messenger.
</P>
<P>
   In the past 17 years, Mike Bloomberg has turned himself into a
``baron of real-time financial news.'' But has the baron lost his
touch? Is he in danger of losing out to new up-and-comers? The
February issue of Wired magazine raises that question about
Bloomberg and the financial computers that carry his name.
</P>
<P>
   ON CD-ROM
</P>
<P>
   Bulldog Productions doesn't pull punches in describing the
latest version of its computer CD game ``Populous.'' Its promotion
tag line says, ``Feel the divine power, enforce your omnipotent
influence.'' In this game, players create their own world, command
its subjects and punish them if they get out of line. What's new
about this latest version of ``Populous'' is 3-D graphics and lots
of new powers.
</P>
<P>
   Keep track of the maintenance of your car through a CD-ROM
called Peak Performance v4.11. It lets you record and schedule all
service appointments. You can track oil changes and monitor the
wear and tear on your car. Peak Performance also lets you print out
customizable reports on maintenance history.
</P>
<P>
   ONLINE
</P>
<P>
   Preschoolers can learn about animals at a nifty new site
maintained by Public Broadcasting. It's called ``Zoboomafoo,''
based on the TV show of the same name. You'll find the site at

 &HT;    Buy the rice, stock the pantry and sleep well at night
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ I was at a party the other night where most of the
guests were from other countries, including many from small
countries in what used to be the Communist bloc. I'm not good at
parties _ even when they are held in English _ because I am shy and
hard of hearing.
</P>
<P>
   But this was even stranger, since most of those at the party
were very formal and polite _ it's one of the cultural differences
between Americans and Eastern Europeans that seem real to me _ and
they tried hard to make me feel at home. So I wasn't suprised when
a graduate student named Vladimir found me somewhere over near the
pirogies and said:
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand that you are a computer expert. Tell me please,
whether the Year 2000 computer problem will create world
disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   I explained to Vladimir I was a computer writer, not a computer
expert. I told him being a computer writer is very much like a
sports writer. Most of us know more than the average hobbyist and a
lot less than a real computer professional. After all, when was the
last time you heard of a football team hiring a sports writer to be
the coach?
</P>
<P>
   But, with that qualification, let me tell you what I think about
the Year 2000 problem. Maybe that way, if you bump into Vladimir,
who had as much trouble understanding my thick Southern English as
I did understanding his Bulgarian-accented English, you can tell
him for me.
</P>
<P>
   First, since this is a computer column for beginners, let's be
sure you haven't lived in a cave for the past couple of years and
have somehow avoided learning about the Year 2000 problem.
Programmers, in the old days, didn't use all four digits when they
needed to include a date in a computer program. In those days,
computer memory was as scarce as June bugs in a chicken yard, so
programmers used just two digits.
</P>
<P>
   That worked reasonably well during the middle of the century,
but now that 02 could logically mean 1902 or 2002, computers get
confused. This digital confusion _ just like the human variety _
can cause all sorts of problems unrelated to the reason for the
confusion. The computer can freeze up, destroy data, do all sorts
of crazy things when it is confused. And, since computers live in
communities, just like people, one confused computer on the
network, way off in Des Moines, can wreak havoc with the others on
either the Internet or internal network.
</P>
<P>
   So far, there have been predictions of massive power outages,
food shortages, water supply problems _ it sounds very much like
the end of the world. And, to make things more frightening, many of
the predictions come from people who understand and work with
computers at a high level. So, Vladimir's question isn't a foolish
one.
</P>
<P>
   But, as it is with a lot of good questions, there is no clear
answer. Governments and big businesses are spending billions of
dollars to fix the problem (and for reasons way too complex for me
to explain in the space I'm given, the problems aren't as easy to
fix as choosing ``find and replace'' in your word processor). The
problem isn't limited to software. Chips that live in your car and
in missile systems and in kids' toys also can and do have the
problem. And since it is impossible to duplicate the software and
conditions that will exist in the future, dress rehearsals like
setting the clock forward on a computer aren't perfect ways of
predicting what will happen.
</P>
<P>
   From what I hear and understand, most personal computer owners
will face only minor problems at worst. Be most concerned if you
have old spreadsheet or financial management software. Either
replace it with software marked ``Year 2000-compliant'' or look on
the company's Web site for tiny programs intended to fix the Y2K
problems in older programs. These programs are usually free for the
downloading.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the big question. The one Vladimir (his real name) asked
about. Should you put this column down and head for the survivalist
supply store to stock up on dried beans, bottled water, rice and
dried pasta?
</P>
<P>
   My answer is a serious one, the best one I can give you under
the circumstances. Heck yes, stock up. I don't think, Vladimir, the
end is near. I think planes will fly, grocery stores will function,
utilities will provide. But a lot of smart people truly worry there
will be supply disruptions. Why not buy the rice? Worst case,
you'll have a well-stocked larder and a healthy diet.

 &HT;    This just in: Author now uses Windows 98
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A few months ago, I received a nasty little electronic
screed from a computer expert who had evidently wandered into this
space by mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who are you related to?'' he began, making me think it was yet
another inquiry about genealogical computing.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, what he meant was that I was so stupid that I would
have to be related to somebody very important around here to be
anointed a computer columnist. That's pretty insulting. If I was
related to somebody important, I think I could do better than
part-time computer columnist.
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, what laid bare my incompetence to him was a passing
remark that I was still using Windows 95 and, perhaps worse,
Netscape instead of Explorer. What if he knew I drive a 10-year-old
pickup truck and use a razor so old the blades have to be bought at
flea markets?
</P>
<P>
   In my defense, I was intending to upgrade to Windows 98 sometime
before Windows 2000 appears. After all, Chairman Bill didn't spend
a billion or so whipping up hype over it, so why should I get all
aquiver about it?
</P>
<P>
   I was using Netscape chiefly because I resented Microsoft's
constant attempts to stuff Explorer down my throat.
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, licking my wounds and begging forgiveness, I
upgraded the other day to Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, wow, as the hippies used to say.
</P>
<P>
   The best thing I've discovered about Windows 98 is that instead
of another attempt to force me to use Explorer, it just sort of
dangles it in front of me. Other than that, and the fact that the
menus sort of drool down now instead of popping down, and the
program list has to be scrolled, I haven't found much difference.
To be sure, there are some differences under the surface, but most
people probably won't notice their effects.
</P>
<P>
   Encouraged, I decided to give Explorer, which I've used before,
another run, and also try Outlook, Microsoft's mail and news
reader.
</P>
<P>
   Explorer is quite all right, but I still prefer Netscape. I
don't see myself using most of the bells and whistles that Explorer
offers, such as channels. Outlook is weak. I definitely prefer
Eudora Pro and Agent as mail and news readers, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Now, had I been using Explorer for several years and tried
Netscape, I'd probably prefer Explorer. They both do the same thing
and in the same general way.
</P>
<P>
   There is a lot to be said for the simple truism that the best
program is the one you know how to use. I would guess that the bulk
of the people who read this column are still using Windows 95.
There's not a program out there that insists on association with
Windows 98. Unless you can see some clear advantage to a new
program, why switch?
</P>
<P>
   One reason, I suppose, would be to have all the most recent
bells and whistles so some geek won't sneer at you for not staying
on the same page with Chairman Bill.

COMMENTARY: KING HUSSEIN, 1935-1999 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating for all needing from Sunday night's file)  (gm) 
 By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   King Hussein is being eulogized around the world for his role as
an Arab-Israeli peacemaker and international statesman. But the
king's real legacy, and what explains the outpouring of grief by
his own people, is the admirable way he ran his own backyard. The
way he played the roles of governor, mayor and even local Bedouin
chief is what really set him apart as an Arab leader.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, as a geopolitician, the king had his shortcomings. While
he was always nimble enough to keep his country from being
devoured, he suffered mightily from the game of nations. He let
Nasser and the nationalist euphoria of the Arab street bamboozle
him into the 1967 war. He talked himself out of the 1973 war, when
he might have actually recaptured part of his lost kingdom from
Israel. Then he went over the waterfalls in a rowboat with Saddam
Hussein, as the Jordanian street, particularly the Palestinians,
pushed him toward an alliance with Iraq in reaction to Israel's
crushing of the Palestinian intifada in the West Bank. When the
king finally surfaced from the Iraq fiasco, he swam over to
Israel's shores in the late 1990s. In fairness, the king's
geopolitical do-si-do was partly in the nature of things: his tiny
country, sitting at the crossroads of caravan routes and at the
hinge of big-power rivalries, was always going to be the plaything
of larger forces.
</P>
<P>
   But when it came to the game of nation-building, King Hussein
deserves to be remembered as an Arab superpower. Jordanians do not
care two cents about the peace King Hussein made with the Jews on
the western side of the Jordan. What they revere him for is the
peace he maintained for Jordanians on the eastern side of that
river. It may seem like an unfairly simple epitaph for such a
historic figure, but for my money King Hussein's gravestone should
read: ``He kept Jordan a nice place to live in a bad
neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   After stomping out a Palestinian guerrilla attempt to take over
Jordan in 1970, he established a stable, almost calm equilibrium at
home by using his own natural resources with his people. He bought
stability with tolerance and integrity, when dinars and dollars
just were not available. King Hussein was a bit like a single
mother in the slums of Hell's Kitchen who worked two jobs, but
nevertheless raised all eight of her kids to finish school and stay
out of jail.
</P>
<P>
   In a neighborhood of brutal thugs, he operated with a basic
decency. In a neighborhood of teeming, unplanned cities, he
maintained clean streets, with stoplights that worked, buses that
ran and gardens that grew green. In a neighborhood of overlapping
intelligence services and censored newspapers, he let his people
breathe. In a neighborhood of anti-democratic regimes, he
experimented with real parliamentary politics.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Jordan is still poor and underdeveloped in many ways. But
if you've flown into Jordan from Syria, from Iraq or from Algeria,
then you've experienced that sense of exhaling, that feeling of
tension flushing out of your body as you drove from the airport
into the relaxed Jordanian capital of Amman. No, Jordan wasn't
Switzerland, but compared with many of its neighbors, it was an
oasis of stability, with deep wells of restraint, in a desert of
nastiness.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, other Arab countries around Jordan are stable too. But
their stability was bought wholesale, not retail. In places such as
Syria or Iraq, stability was bought by taking away people's
freedoms, by taking away their free speech, by taking away their
right to vote, by taking away political pluralism or opposition
parties.
</P>
<P>
   King Hussein did it the other way. And that is why his people
are crying real tears. The same with people outside the Middle
East. It's odd to think how popular Hussein had become in his later
years. After all, his past was not uncheckered. I believe it is
because King Hussein ignited the same feeling in us that the late
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin touched. It is the hope that
is kindled when we see old men changing. There is something about
watching these graybeards standing up, breaking with the past,
offering a handshake to a lifelong foe and saying: ``Enough. I was
wrong. This war is stupid.'' It keeps alive the idea that anything
is possible in politics, even in Middle East politics.
</P>
<P>
   King Hussein's tenure also reminds us of a fundamental rule of
international relations: the less oil a country has, the more
likely its leader will try to survive not by crushing his people
with a massive state bureaucracy and army, but by accommodating
them. The king had too little oil and too many Palestinians (some
70 percent of his population) to rule with anything like an iron
fist.
</P>
<P>
   But the less oil you have, and the more you have to rely on
building a real bond with your people, the more vulnerable you are
to the shifting moods of the street. That is why until his last
day, the king alternated between maintaining his legitimacy by
sweeping the streets and maintaining his legitimacy by _
occasionally _ being swept up by them. His decision to sack his
brother, longtime Crown Prince Hassan, and replace him with his son
Abdullah as heir, was driven in part by a sense that Abdullah _
with his Palestinian wife and his own roots in the
Bedouin-dominated Jordanian Army _ would be much more popular on
the street, and much more capable of holding the Jordanian
consensus than the more experienced, but elitist, Hassan.
</P>
<P>
   Abdullah's appointment was King Hussein's last bet that the best
way to preserve one's dynasty is by relying on legitimacy, not
fear. If Abdullah can manage to sweep the streets half as well as
his father, and not be swept up by them quite so often, he might
just make the king's bet a good one.

<TEXT>

   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   Q: If the Senate convicts President Clinton, does he retain
retirement benefits after leaving office? My husband and I are
divided on this. _ Sharon Geanuleas
</P>
<P>
   A: If removed from office, a president loses more than face. Out
go any government payments such as retirement dollars and Secret
Service protection, says Don Ritchie, associate historian for the
U.S. Senate. Loss of these generous retirement benefits may have
figured into Richard Nixon's decision to resign. The presidential
benefits were introduced in the 1950s as part of the pension
package (a modern-day benefit of being the leader of the free
world). Q: How do they make the fabulous pictures that cover an
entire bus and the smaller ones that advertise businesses? What
company does the work? How much does it cost? Who pays for it? _
Suellen Jones
</P>
<P>
   A: The ads are made by Obie Media, an Oregon-based company
specializing in transit advertising.
</P>
<P>
   The full wrap, an ad covering the entire bus, is made on vinyl
sheets (solid for the lower portions and ``Swiss cheese-like'' on
the windows) and placed on the bus. This takes about 80 pieces of
sticky backed vinyl (ever deal with shelf liner?).
</P>
<P>
   Q: A couple of weekends ago, at my uncle's birthday party, I
found out that my sister and her on-again/off-again fiance got
married on New Year's Eve in Las Vegas. (I found out from a cousin
whom I see once or twice a year.) My entire family _ fiance
included _ was at our parents' house for Christmas, yet I wasn't
told of the upcoming wedding. I have received an invitation to a
reception in their honor. Am I being petty for feeling that I
should snub the reception since I was snubbed about the wedding
announcement? I realize that an invitation to the wedding would
have been out of the question, since it was out of state, but still
...
</P>
<P>
   _F.G.
</P>
<P>
   A: This wedding was not an accident. Your sister, for her own
reasons, clearly did not want the family there. Hey _ you were in
good company since no one was invited. That is her decision and, in
my opinion, her loss. Water under the bridge. Do not snub the
reception. You will regret it later and miss a good party. (What's
a little swallowed pride when there is free food and drink?)
Whether you bring a gift to the couple is up to you. In any case,
find a quiet moment (not in front of others _ no husband, no
cousin) in the next few months and tell your sister how you feel _
in the least accusatory tone you can muster. For all you know, this
could be a complete shock to her. Let her know you want your
relationship with her to continue in a positive manner. With any
luck she will realize the fallout from her thoughtlessness. But be
prepared, she may not. Then it is over. She had her way; you had
your say.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I want to write to Shel Silverstein. I think he is a great
poet. Will you please give me his address?
</P>
<P>
   _Joscelyne Schroeder
</P>
<P>
   A: ``The Giving Tree'' is one of my favorite books. Hard to
believe this man also composed the Johnny Cash hit ``A Boy Named
Sue,'' but he did. This very private author penned one of
Publishers Weekly's all-time best-selling hardcover books, ``Where
the Sidewalk Ends.'' Write to him in care of HarperCollins
Children's Books, 10 E. 53rd St., New York, NY 10022. Remember, he
is famous for not replying to mail or making personal appearances,
so if your letter goes unanswered, don't take it personally.
Silverstein believes that no child should receive something if all
children cannot.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Many years ago our family played a word game named Scribbage.
It was made up of a cup, a timer and 13 lettered cubes or blocks.
We could build words crossword-style. I believe it was the
forerunner of Scrabble. Scribbage was made by the same company that
made another popular word game, Yahtzee, which we still play
sometimes. The E.S. Lowe Co. at 200 Fifth Ave., New York, NY 10010
was the manufacturer of both games. I read your column in Omaha.
Can you tell us if this game is still available and where? _Don
Bailey
</P>
<P>
   A: Found one _ and only one _ at Hog Wild, 100 E. N Loop Blvd.,
here in Austin. Call (512) 467-9453. This shop specializes in
vintage toys, and this game, in good condition, will be in the $20
range.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Within one week I have seen four dead robins in my South
Austin neighborhood. One day, I was out in my yard when a robin
fell out of a tree and hit the ground with a thud. When I walked
toward it to investigate, it jumped up and tried to fly back up
into the tree but didn't quite make it and fell back to the ground
with another loud thud. I carefully approached it again. It laid on
its back for a moment before jumping to its feet, hopping across
the yard and finally finding enough strength to fly into a low
branch, where it sat for several minutes. Can you tell me what is
going on? _ Jennifer Sanders
</P>
<P>
   A: A rockin' robin. ``The robin in question had likely eaten
fermented fruit and was feeling a bit tipsy,'' says Paul Sunby,
biologist at SWCA Inc., an environmental consulting firm. That is
actually a fairly common occurrence for frugivores (fruit eaters)
such as the robin and cedar waxwings. The sugar in berries can
ferment if the berries stay on a tree too long. When eaten, they
create a buzz for the bird. These party animals may not react
quickly enough when faced by a predatory cat, a dog or an oncoming
SUV. Sunby adds robins should ``never drink and fly.'' There seems
to be a much higher than average number of robins wintering in
Austin this year. You might just be seeing a few dead ones because
so many robins are around. Sunby adds compassionately, ``That
little robin ticker has to give out sometime.'' Q: I was told
Gerber is settling a lawsuit by giving children a $500 savings
bond. I would like to know if the lawsuit settlement is legitimate
before we send information about our child to the address listed
for Gerber. _ W.C.
</P>
<P>
   A: This is one of those Internet legends with no basis in fact.
None. Like the one asking well-intentioned folks to send business
cards to a nonprofit to help an ill child. (Make-a-Wish has
disavowed this one.) The Gerber rumor is more dangerous because
information like your child's Social Security number and birth
certificate can be the basis for establishing a false identity.
Vest your cards. The first Gerber baby products? In late 1928,
strained peas, prunes, carrots, spinach and beef vegetable soup
appeared on the national scene. Q: I have a 1950s-era Chambers
range and it would be helpful to have a source for parts. These
ranges are built like battleships. Do you or your readers know of a
Chambers graveyard for parts? _ David Anderson
</P>
<P>
   A: Contact Macy's Texas Stove Works in Houston, where ``all
parts known to mankind'' for Chambers ranges are stocked. Call
Macy's at (713) 521-0934.Upshot/Update/Uproar_ Reader Bob Reim

produced to protect flooring while painting _ heavy and wide. Pick
up a 36-inch-wide roll for $6 in the paint department of Home Depot
stores.

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   ``Uneasy lies the head that wears the crown,'' wrote William
Shakespeare.
</P>
<P>
   And that goes for crown princes, too, as Jordanian politics now
demonstrate.
</P>
<P>
   King Hussein deposed his brother, Hassan, from his 34-year
tenure as heir to the throne, and named his eldest son Abdullah, as
his successor. It was an extraordinary birthday present for
Abdullah, who turned 37 on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Just before the king's fairytale-like return to Jordan ended
darkly, he essentially accused his brother Hassan of meddling in
the army and allowing his own supporters to criticize Queen Noor.
</P>
<P>
   And yet many believe there can be absolutely no question of
Hassan's loyalty. Perhaps Hussein was led to false suspicions due
to palace intrigues, possibly involving Queen Noor herself, who
wants her son, Hamza, still only 18, to succeed to the throne.
Perhaps the king had worried that Hassan would put his own son on
the throne, though the two men had agreed decades ago that
Hussein's line would rule in future.
</P>
<P>
   Many national leaders find it hard to choose replacements, and
they often become jealous and suspicious of even the most trusted
lieutenants put into that position. Perhaps, they worry, the heir
is secretly trying on the crown and dreaming of what he will do too
soon before the old ruler is gone.
</P>
<P>
   The regent is placed in a very difficult position: Doing nothing
makes him seem a poor administrator; taking decisions makes him
seem a threat.
</P>
<P>
   Hassan apparently fell off this narrow tightrope.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's new king lacks political experience, though his strong
base in the army implies he would be able to make a stable regime.
Hussein even linked the change in succession with a defense of army
chief of staff, Field Marshal Abd al-Hafiz Kaabna, who Hassan was
seeking to remove.
</P>
<P>
   None of these developments means that Jordan is unstable. There
is not going to be any serious conflict among the factions. Things
will soon settle down into an acceptance of Abdullah's rule, and
the jockeying will begin by ambitious officials to ingratiate
themselves with the new successor.
</P>
<P>
   One hopes Abdullah will quickly become entrenched and
experienced as he moves toward success in his reign as Jordan's
fourth king.
</P>
<P>
   The key factor about Jordan is that it is a small country, in
terms of both population and territory. Compared to several
neighbors, it is inevitably weak.
</P>
<P>
   During the era of King Hussein's grandfather _ the original King
Abdullah _ in the 1940s and early 1950s, some Jordanians hoped
their state could be the nucleus of a wider Arab realm. But these
hopes soon faded and, with Abdullah's assassination in 1951,
disappeared entirely.
</P>
<P>
   Survival, not empire-building, has been the necessary theme of
Jordan's foreign policy. Today the main external threats are from
Iran, Iraq and Syria.
</P>
<P>
   King Hussein's successor will not find this easy to change, nor
is he likely to seek allies among the radical states. They cannot
do too much for Jordan, though there is a lot they can do against
it.
</P>
<P>
   Iran is a problem, of course, because its Islamic regime stands
for everything Jordan's government opposes, and vice versa. But
Iran is relatively far away, on the other side of Iraq, and does
not participate in the Arab political arena.
</P>
<P>
   Syria is much closer. Damascus would like to make Amman a
satellite similar to Lebanon. The Syrians have also sponsored
anti-Jordanian terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Coexistence is possible, but alliance is out of the question.
</P>
<P>
   The case of Iraq is more complicated.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq is potentially Jordan's largest trading partner, and the
sanctions against Baghdad have been devastating for Jordanian
business. The pressure of Jordanian public opinion and fear of
Iraqi military aggression led King Hussein to support Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein during the 1990-1991 Kuwait crisis and
ensuing war.
</P>
<P>
   After Iraq's defeat, Jordan switched sides. The United States
forgave it, but the Saudis and Kuwaitis are still angry. King
Hussein then burnt his bridges to Baghdad by welcoming Iraqi
oppositionists and attacking Saddam Hussein's regime in very strong
terms.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqis have reciprocated with even harsher words.
</P>
<P>
   There are no short-term prospects of a thaw, especially as long
as sanctions remain in place against Iraq. Still, in a
post-sanctions _ and, even more, a post-Saddam _ situation, the new
king might be eager to make up with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the Jordanians would waste no time in reestablishing
maximum trade the moment there was any opening to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, LESSON ONE for Jordan's new ruler is: Be very wary
about the radical regimes, both as a foreign threat and as a source
of internal subversion.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, any unilateral Jordanian-Iraqi rapprochement would
kill the kingdom's chances of getting Saudi and Kuwaiti aid.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Jordan has been pursuing the delicate task of
apologizing to the gulf monarchies for its behavior a decade ago.
In recent months, the common antipathy toward Iraq has been making
the Kuwaitis more open than ever to patching things up with Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   The Saudis are harder to persuade. They frequently remind
themselves that, back in 1991, a few Jordanians spoke of King
Hussein as the proper guardian of Mecca and Medina.
</P>
<P>
   The House of Saud took those cities away from King Hussein's
ancestors in the 1920s, and the current rulers of Saudi Arabia
worried that the Jordanians were dreaming of a comeback there.
</P>
<P>
   Still, perhaps they would give Abdullah the benefit of the
doubt, wanting to ensure the continuing stability of the Jordanian
monarchy.
</P>
<P>
   So LESSON TWO for the new ruler is: Do everything you can to
persuade the Saudis and Kuwaitis that you won't cause them any
headaches, so they'll give you lots of aid. Remember that Jordan's
main internal problems are due to economic stagnation.
</P>
<P>
   The next king might be tempted to distance Jordan a bit from
Israel to reduce some Arabs' antagonism and open other's purses.
Yet the strategic relationship with Israel is one of Jordan's main
assets.
</P>
<P>
   Who else is going to back Jordan against a radical threat or
help ensure a Palestinian state doesn't become a new problem for
Jordan?
</P>
<P>
   Thus, LESSON THREE: Preserve good relations with Israel,
whatever adjustments might be made to fit the new king's style.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's relationship with the Palestinians has a long and
complex history. Abdullah's West Bank wife should be an asset in
winning support from Palestinian-Jordanians.
</P>
<P>
   LESSON FOUR: Express support for the Palestinians so they make
gains. More Palestinians should not need to flee to Jordan as
refugees.
</P>
<P>
   But make sure they are hemmed in by commitments, so that a
Palestinian state would neither subvert nor threaten Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, remember that Arab solidarity is a wonderful thing, but
U.S. protection _ not politically correct nationalist or Islamist
rhetoric _ is Jordan's main protection from the potentially
smothering embrace of its Arab brothers.

<P>
   AMMAN - Jordanians absorbing the shockwaves of their political
earthquake back their new young ruler, Abdullah. But some express
concern over his inexperience and worry that he will have
difficulty filling his father's shoes.
</P>
<P>
   After assuming his post as crown prince last week, Abdullah
seemed remarkably well ensconced as the man who in only days would
inherit Hussein's kingdom. By Sunday, when his father passed away,
pictures of Abdullah in his new role, reviewing elite troops and
receiving kisses from tribal Beduin leaders had for days been
dominated the state media.
</P>
<P>
   Ministers, parliament members and the rest of the political
elite went out of their way to assure Abdullah of their support and
loyalty, and convey a sense of continuity as the kingdom endured
the shock of an end to the 46-year old reign of Hussein. Even the
former crown prince, Hassan, embraced Abdullah and offered best
wishes for his success.
</P>
<P>
   Some storekeepers had already removed pictures of King Hussein
with his brother Hassan and replaced them with posters of the king
with Abdullah.
</P>
<P>
   But in the Hussein refugee camp in downtown Amman, Salim
Ibrahim, an aluminum worker, was worried about the transition.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in a cafe crowded with unemployed youths playing cards
and old men smoking nargilas, Ibrahim, who traces his roots to Lod,
said: ``I am concerned at this point about Jordan's future. We know
King Hussein and he knows us. But we don't know how things will be
with another person.
</P>
<P>
   ``Abdullah is a military man, and he won't be like King Hussein,
who understood politics 100 percent. Abdullah doesn't have the
understanding that Hassan does,'' referring to the foreign and
domestic policy experience Hassan garnered during his 34-year
tenure as crown prince. ``Maybe, step-by-step, he will learn.''
</P>
<P>
   The main concern in the refugee camp was economic conditions,
which residents say have been deteriorating ever since the Persian
Gulf War. Unemployment in Jordan is estimated by economists to be
at 17 percent and, by all appearances, it was very much higher than
that in the camp.
</P>
<P>
   Others among the camp's 50,000 residents predicted the change in
succession would have no impact on their lives. ``It won't have any
effect, because we are talking about the same family, the Hashemite
family,'' a shopkeeper said.
</P>
<P>
   One man said he was puzzled by the letter King Hussein had sent
to Hassan that was publicized by the palace last week,
</P>
<P>
   It charged Hassan with usurping authority during the king's
six-month absence at the Mayo Clinic, and said that his associates
had waged a smear campaign against Hussein's American-born wife,
Queen Noor. ``It appears there were some family problems,'' the man
said. ``This letter was very strange.''
</P>
<P>
   Across town, on the tree-lined campus of the University of
Jordan, students said they were surprised by the rapid-fire change
in succession, but seemed to support it or accept it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course I feel badly about Prince Hassan,'' said Rami
Samain, 22, a law student, praising his academic accomplishments,
which include writing three books. As for Abdullah, he added: ``He
has a military mentality and that is a good thing for a developing
country.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The king has acted in the people's interest,'' added Mahmoud
Rawajdeh, a student of Islamic law. ``Perhaps Hassan can help
Abdullah. Why not?''
</P>
<P>
   Another student, who asked not to be identified, said: ``The
king started ruling when he was 18 and people accepted him as king.
Abdullah is much older than that, and his father chose him. I
expect Abdullah will be good for the country.''
</P>
<P>
   But another student, who asked not to be identified, said: ``I
think Abdullah has no experience with what is happening in the
region. Prince Hassan better understands relations with other
countries. There are reasons for these changes that no one knows. I
think King Hussein did this for his personal interest and not for
our benefit at all.''

   In his more than 40 years as the ruler of Jordan, King Hussein
served his country and his people well. Jordan today is in far
better shape than most Arab countries, despite the absence of oil
and other natural resources, and its prospects for the 21st century
are better than those of Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, and certainly Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Although he could not erase the Hashemite kingdom's deep social
and political divisions, Hussein was quite successful in managing
the internal conflicts to prevent them from exploding. Slowly and
carefully, he introduced democratic norms, encouraged pluralism and
debate, and gently nudged Jordan to the front of the Arab world in
this process.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the king's stature grew throughout the Middle
East. His judgment, straightforward style and common sense were
widely respected, and his humanity and measured leadership served
as an example for all other leaders in the region. In Israel, King
Hussein was more popular than any of the home-grown politicians.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, it is important to recall that in navigating
the Middle Eastern obstacle course that threatened the survival of
Jordan, Hussein made some major mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1960s, he failed to take action against Palestinian
terror groups using Jordan as a safe haven for attacking Israel.
This led to unnecessary and very costly confrontations with Israel.
This only ended in September 1970, when Palestinians turned their
guns against Hussein and almost succeeded in overthrowing the
Hashemite regime.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1967, he joined Gamal Abdel Nasser's military alliance
threatening to invade Israel, and after the war began in June,
Jordan's forces joined in and were quickly defeated. As a result,
the Hashemite kingdom lost control of the West Bank and, more
importantly, of Jerusalem's Old City.
</P>
<P>
   Much later, in 1990, Hussein briefly embraced Saddam Hussein's
madness. Perhaps his hand was forced by Iraqi- and
Palestinian-inspired demonstrations in Jordan, but as the leader,
he was responsible for the failure to prevent the creation of an
atmosphere in which popular support for the Iraqi dictator thrived.
</P>
<P>
   However, like his grandfather Abdullah, Hussein learned quickly
from his mistakes, and corrected them. In contrast to the leaders
of many neighboring countries, Iraq in particular, Hussein avoided
piling mistake upon mistake.
</P>
<P>
   He did not allow pride and inflated self-importance to dominate,
and was not afraid of admitting errors and reversing course. As a
result, the citizens of Jordan were spared the enduring pain and
suffering of the Iraqis, Syrians, Palestinians and Lebanese.
</P>
<P>
   After the 1967 disaster, while the other Arab states continued
to deny the reality of Israel's existence, Jordan quickly resumed
the informal cooperation on vital issues such as security and
water. The secret meetings started again, and cooperation with
Moshe Dayan's ``open bridges'' policy allowed the Palestinians on
both sides of the river to continue to trade and travel without
interruption.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, within a few months of end of the 1991 Persian Gulf
War, Jordan had totally disengaged from Iraq, and repaired its
relations with the United States and Israel. By the time of the
Madrid conference in October 1991, Hussein was no longer persona
non grata, and resumed his central role in promoting Arab-Israeli
negotiations and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, as the power of Iraq and the Palestinians declined,
Jordan was able to make substantial progress toward securing
security and stability by balancing the various threats.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as the Oslo agreement created the necessary political
conditions, negotiation of the Israel-Jordan peace treaty
accelerated and it was signed in November 1994. As a result, the
United States agreed to erase Jordan's debts, and other economic
benefits began to flow.
</P>
<P>
   However, the final and most important test of any leader is his
(or her) ability to create a legacy that lasts into future
generations.
</P>
<P>
   In the past decade, Hussein's brother, now the former crown
prince, Hassan, continued the the careful movement toward democracy
and pluralism. Hassan also helped to propel relations with Israel,
creating a far healthier and vital relationship between Jerusalem
and Amman. Hassan's emphasis on religious dimensions that unite
Arabs, Jews and Christians, and on the joint pursuit of scientific
and technological knowledge, provided additional dimensions to this
process.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently responding to pressures within his family, and his
own wish to see his line continued, the king abruptly replaced
Hassan with his oldest son, Abdullah.
</P>
<P>
   The world joins Jordanians in praying that Hussein made the
right choice and that the transition between rulers will be smooth.
</P>
<P>
   Abdullah's challenge is to continue and extend the policies that
were initiated by his namesake and great-grandfather, and were
extended and developed by his father. If he succeeds, he will be
able to lead Jordan to political and social stability, economic
growth, and increased democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps after Abdullah's reign, his heir will be chosen by
popular vote, and the monarchy will become more of a symbol. In
this way, Jordan will guide the rest of the Middle East toward the
stability that we all need.

<P>
   ``Uneasy lies the head that wears the crown,'' wrote William
Shakespeare.
</P>
<P>
   And that goes for crown princes, too, as Jordanian politics now
demonstrate.
</P>
<P>
   King Hussein deposed his brother, Hassan, from his 34-year
tenure as heir to the throne, and named his eldest son Abdullah, as
his successor. It was an extraordinary birthday present for
Abdullah, who turned 37 on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Just before the king's fairytale-like return to Jordan ended
darkly, he essentially accused his brother Hassan of meddling in
the army and allowing his own supporters to criticize Queen Noor.
</P>
<P>
   And yet many believe there can be absolutely no question of
Hassan's loyalty. Perhaps Hussein was led to false suspicions due
to palace intrigues, possibly involving Queen Noor herself, who
wants her son, Hamza, still only 18, to succeed to the throne.
Perhaps the king had worried that Hassan would put his own son on
the throne, though the two men had agreed decades ago that
Hussein's line would rule in future.
</P>
<P>
   Many national leaders find it hard to choose replacements, and
they often become jealous and suspicious of even the most trusted
lieutenants put into that position. Perhaps, they worry, the heir
is secretly trying on the crown and dreaming of what he will do too
soon before the old ruler is gone.
</P>
<P>
   The regent is placed in a very difficult position: Doing nothing
makes him seem a poor administrator; taking decisions makes him
seem a threat.
</P>
<P>
   Hassan apparently fell off this narrow tightrope.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's new king lacks political experience, though his strong
base in the army implies he would be able to make a stable regime.
Hussein even linked the change in succession with a defense of army
chief of staff, Field Marshal Abd al-Hafiz Kaabna, who Hassan was
seeking to remove.
</P>
<P>
   None of these developments means that Jordan is unstable. There
is not going to be any serious conflict among the factions. Things
will soon settle down into an acceptance of Abdullah's rule, and
the jockeying will begin by ambitious officials to ingratiate
themselves with the new successor.
</P>
<P>
   One hopes Abdullah will quickly become entrenched and
experienced as he moves toward success in his reign as Jordan's
fourth king.
</P>
<P>
   The key factor about Jordan is that it is a small country, in
terms of both population and territory. Compared to several
neighbors, it is inevitably weak.
</P>
<P>
   During the era of King Hussein's grandfather _ the original King
Abdullah _ in the 1940s and early 1950s, some Jordanians hoped
their state could be the nucleus of a wider Arab realm. But these
hopes soon faded and, with Abdullah's assassination in 1951,
disappeared entirely.
</P>
<P>
   Survival, not empire-building, has been the necessary theme of
Jordan's foreign policy. Today the main external threats are from
Iran, Iraq and Syria.
</P>
<P>
   King Hussein's successor will not find this easy to change, nor
is he likely to seek allies among the radical states. They cannot
do too much for Jordan, though there is a lot they can do against
it.
</P>
<P>
   Iran is a problem, of course, because its Islamic regime stands
for everything Jordan's government opposes, and vice versa. But
Iran is relatively far away, on the other side of Iraq, and does
not participate in the Arab political arena.
</P>
<P>
   Syria is much closer. Damascus would like to make Amman a
satellite similar to Lebanon. The Syrians have also sponsored
anti-Jordanian terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Coexistence is possible, but alliance is out of the question.
</P>
<P>
   The case of Iraq is more complicated.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq is potentially Jordan's largest trading partner, and the
sanctions against Baghdad have been devastating for Jordanian
business. The pressure of Jordanian public opinion and fear of
Iraqi military aggression led King Hussein to support Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein during the 1990-1991 Kuwait crisis and
ensuing war.
</P>
<P>
   After Iraq's defeat, Jordan switched sides. The United States
forgave it, but the Saudis and Kuwaitis are still angry. King
Hussein then burnt his bridges to Baghdad by welcoming Iraqi
oppositionists and attacking Saddam Hussein's regime in very strong
terms.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqis have reciprocated with even harsher words.
</P>
<P>
   There are no short-term prospects of a thaw, especially as long
as sanctions remain in place against Iraq. Still, in a
post-sanctions _ and, even more, a post-Saddam _ situation, the new
king might be eager to make up with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the Jordanians would waste no time in reestablishing
maximum trade the moment there was any opening to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, LESSON ONE for Jordan's new ruler is: Be very wary
about the radical regimes, both as a foreign threat and as a source
of internal subversion.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, any unilateral Jordanian-Iraqi rapprochement would
kill the kingdom's chances of getting Saudi and Kuwaiti aid.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Jordan has been pursuing the delicate task of
apologizing to the gulf monarchies for its behavior a decade ago.
In recent months, the common antipathy toward Iraq has been making
the Kuwaitis more open than ever to patching things up with Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   The Saudis are harder to persuade. They frequently remind
themselves that, back in 1991, a few Jordanians spoke of King
Hussein as the proper guardian of Mecca and Medina.
</P>
<P>
   The House of Saud took those cities away from King Hussein's
ancestors in the 1920s, and the current rulers of Saudi Arabia
worried that the Jordanians were dreaming of a comeback there.
</P>
<P>
   Still, perhaps they would give Abdullah the benefit of the
doubt, wanting to ensure the continuing stability of the Jordanian
monarchy.
</P>
<P>
   So LESSON TWO for the new ruler is: Do everything you can to
persuade the Saudis and Kuwaitis that you won't cause them any
headaches, so they'll give you lots of aid. Remember that Jordan's
main internal problems are due to economic stagnation.
</P>
<P>
   The next king might be tempted to distance Jordan a bit from
Israel to reduce some Arabs' antagonism and open other's purses.
Yet the strategic relationship with Israel is one of Jordan's main
assets.
</P>
<P>
   Who else is going to back Jordan against a radical threat or
help ensure a Palestinian state doesn't become a new problem for
Jordan?
</P>
<P>
   Thus, LESSON THREE: Preserve good relations with Israel,
whatever adjustments might be made to fit the new king's style.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's relationship with the Palestinians has a long and
complex history. Abdullah's West Bank wife should be an asset in
winning support from Palestinian-Jordanians.
</P>
<P>
   LESSON FOUR: Express support for the Palestinians so they make
gains. More Palestinians should not need to flee to Jordan as
refugees.
</P>
<P>
   But make sure they are hemmed in by commitments, so that a
Palestinian state would neither subvert nor threaten Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, remember that Arab solidarity is a wonderful thing, but
U.S. protection _ not politically correct nationalist or Islamist
rhetoric _ is Jordan's main protection from the potentially
smothering embrace of its Arab brothers.

   AMMAN - Jordanians absorbing the shockwaves of their political
earthquake back their new young ruler, Abdullah. But some express
concern over his inexperience and worry that he will have
difficulty filling his father's shoes.
</P>
<P>
   After assuming his post as crown prince last week, Abdullah
seemed remarkably well ensconced as the man who in only days would
inherit Hussein's kingdom. By Sunday, when his father passed away,
pictures of Abdullah in his new role, reviewing elite troops and
receiving kisses from tribal Beduin leaders had for days been
dominated the state media.
</P>
<P>
   Ministers, parliament members and the rest of the political
elite went out of their way to assure Abdullah of their support and
loyalty, and convey a sense of continuity as the kingdom endured
the shock of an end to the 46-year old reign of Hussein. Even the
former crown prince, Hassan, embraced Abdullah and offered best
wishes for his success.
</P>
<P>
   Some storekeepers had already removed pictures of King Hussein
with his brother Hassan and replaced them with posters of the king
with Abdullah.
</P>
<P>
   But in the Hussein refugee camp in downtown Amman, Salim
Ibrahim, an aluminum worker, was worried about the transition.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in a cafe crowded with unemployed youths playing cards
and old men smoking nargilas, Ibrahim, who traces his roots to Lod,
said: ``I am concerned at this point about Jordan's future. We know
King Hussein and he knows us. But we don't know how things will be

</P>

   ``Abdullah is a military man, and he won't be like King Hussein,

Hussein was more popular than any of the home-grown politicians.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, it is important to recall that in navigating
the Middle Eastern obstacle course that threatened the survival of
Jordan, Hussein made some major mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1960s, he failed to take action against Palestinian
terror groups using Jordan as a safe haven for attacking Israel.
This led to unnecessary and very costly confrontations with Israel.
This only ended in September 1970, when Palestinians turned their
guns against Hussein and almost succeeded in overthrowing the
Hashemite regime.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1967, he joined Gamal Abdel Nasser's military alliance
threatening to invade Israel, and after the war began in June,
Jordan's forces joined in and were quickly defeated. As a result,
the Hashemite kingdom lost control of the West Bank and, more
importantly, of Jerusalem's Old City.
</P>
<P>
   Much later, in 1990, Hussein briefly embraced Saddam Hussein's
madness. Perhaps his hand was forced by Iraqi- and
Palestinian-inspired demonstrations in Jordan, but as the leader,
he was responsible for the failure to prevent the creation of an
atmosphere in which popular support for the Iraqi dictator thrived.
</P>
<P>
   However, like his grandfather Abdullah, Hussein learned quickly
from his mistakes, and corrected them. In contrast to the leaders
of many neighboring countries, Iraq in particular, Hussein avoided
piling mistake upon mistake.
</P>
<P>
   He did not allow pride and inflated self-importance to dominate,
and was not afraid of admitting errors and reversing course. As a
result, the citizens of Jordan were spared the enduring pain and
suffering of the Iraqis, Syrians, Palestinians and Lebanese.
</P>
<P>
   After the 1967 disaster, while the other Arab states continued
to deny the reality of Israel's existence, Jordan quickly resumed
the informal cooperation on vital issues such as security and
water. The secret meetings started again, and cooperation with
Moshe Dayan's ``open bridges'' policy allowed the Palestinians on
both sides of the river to continue to trade and travel without
interruption.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, within a few months of end of the 1991 Persian Gulf
War, Jordan had totally disengaged from Iraq, and repaired its
relations with the United States and Israel. By the time of the
Madrid conference in October 1991, Hussein was no longer persona
non grata, and resumed his central role in promoting Arab-Israeli
negotiations and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, as the power of Iraq and the Palestinians declined,
Jordan was able to make substantial progress toward securing
security and stability by balancing the various threats.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as the Oslo agreement created the necessary political
conditions, negotiation of the Israel-Jordan peace treaty
accelerated and it was signed in November 1994. As a result, the
United States agreed to erase Jordan's debts, and other economic
benefits began to flow.
</P>
<P>
   However, the final and most important test of any leader is his
(or her) ability to create a legacy that lasts into future
generations.
</P>
<P>
   In the past decade, Hussein's brother, now the former crown
prince, Hassan, continued the the careful movement toward democracy
and pluralism. Hassan also helped to propel relations with Israel,
creating a far healthier and vital relationship between Jerusalem
and Amman. Hassan's emphasis on religious dimensions that unite
Arabs, Jews and Christians, and on the joint pursuit of scientific
and technological knowledge, provided additional dimensions to this
process.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently responding to pressures within his family, and his
own wish to see his line continued, the king abruptly replaced
Hassan with his oldest son, Abdullah.
</P>
<P>
   The world joins Jordanians in praying that Hussein made the
right choice and that the transition between rulers will be smooth.
</P>
<P>
   Abdullah's challenge is to continue and extend the policies that
were initiated by his namesake and great-grandfather, and were
extended and developed by his father. If he succeeds, he will be
able to lead Jordan to political and social stability, economic
growth, and increased democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps after Abdullah's reign, his heir will be chosen by
popular vote, and the monarchy will become more of a symbol. In
this way, Jordan will guide the rest of the Middle East toward the
stability that we all need.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    With the passing of King Hussein, the people of Jordan are
losing a wise and tested leader and a strong and courageous
advocate of the cause of peace in the Middle East.
 &HT;    King Hussein made a great contribution to the history of the
Jordanian nation. His achievements for the benefits of his people
and other Arabs, as well as his global stature, were
internationally recognized during his lifetime. The king truly
deserved that recognition.
 &HT;    I recall my very first meeting with the king in Moscow, in 1987.
What a personality, what a strong and lively mind! Immediately, I
saw in him a wise and experienced statesman and a warm and friendly
man, a great human being. We talked at length about how best to
travel the road to peace in the Middle East. Political,
intellectual and personal courage were needed to reach that goal,
and the king clearly had it. As I worked to re-start the peace
process in that troubled region, King Hussein's advice was always
welcome and very important to me.
 &HT;    In his many years at the helm of Jordan, the king had his share
of frustrations and setbacks. He knew how to take those blows _ he
persevered, he went forward and led others. This ability will be
greatly missed.
 &HT;    As I was traveling in the United States last October, I watched
with admiration as the king left his hospital bed to help resolve
the difficulties in the negotiations between the Israeli and
Palestinian leaders. He looked frail, but I wanted to be hopeful
for his health. So it was a great shock for me to learn that King
Hussein was losing his battle to cancer.
 &HT;    Last April I visited Jordan. The king and Queen Noor invited me
and Raisa to the Royal Palace. It was a most memorable day for us.
It was as though we had seen each other and talked just a few days
before. The king and I discussed the Middle East and the many
political and psychological obstacles still to be overcome to make
peace a durable reality. He was full of ideas and vigor.
 &HT;    We met as old friends. We reminisced about our first talk in
Moscow, in 1987. Back then, I was struck by the king's total
commitment to peaceful methods of solving the Middle East problem.
I saw how concerned he was about the fate of the Middle East peace
process.
 &HT;    The king had done a great deal to preserve stability in
Jordanian society amid the turmoil in the region; yet in Jordanian
society, particularly among intellectuals and young people, there
was a growing disenchantment. Many people were viewing the peace
process as hopelessly deadlocked. Frustration was turning into
despair and a feeling of helplessness, which can be quite
dangerous.
 &HT;    It was clear to both the king and myself that, first of all, the
peace process must be carried forward, despite all setbacks. The
foundations laid down in Madrid and Oslo, we agreed, must be
preserved, for it was the only framework not just for the
resolution of the Palestinian problem but for creating a durable
system of security and cooperation in the region.
 &HT;    King Hussein and I discussed such a system in some detail. It
should encompass, among others, such countries as Iraq, Iran and
Turkey. Without it, the Middle East would not be able to respond to
the challenges of the new century, which include the issues of
security but also the environment, the water crisis and the problem
of terrorism.
 &HT;    In working for a peaceful solution of any issue it is very
important never to despair, always to remain optimistic. The
momentum for peace, set in motion by true leaders such as Yitzhak
Rabin, Shimon Peres, Yassir Arafat, Hosni Mubarak and King Hussein
is still strong. The severe setbacks of recent months have not
destroyed it.
 &HT;    But now my sympathy and condolences must go to the people of
Jordan, who I am sure will rally around their new leader, Crown
Prince Abdullah; to Queen Noor, whom Raisa and I remember fondly;
to the king's children and family. My thoughts today are about
them, and about peace in the Middle East. Its triumph will be the
best tribute to King Hussein of Jordan.

HOW TO BE GRUNTLED, KEMPT AND COUTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Feb. 14)  
(Eds: Items in bold should be set in italics.) 
(lb) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In wordplay you can sometimes get word understanding. Phrases
like ``If vegetarians eat vegetables, what do humanitarians eat?''
and ``Why do we put suits in a garment bag and put garments in a
suitcase?'' have been knocking about the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Such  &UR; double-entendres &LR;  can be funny. For example, two meanings
of  &UR; funny &LR;  are the basis for the line ``Is it true cannibals don't
eat clowns because they taste funny?'' Because  &UR; season &LR;  has several
meanings, we can ask, ``If it's tourist season, why can't we shoot
them?''
</P>
<P>
   These one-liners, spuriously attributed to the word players
George Carlin and Steven Wright, neither of whom claims credit,
cause us to take another look at what we're saying.
</P>
<P>
   The word to be examined today is treated in a similarly
thought-provoking phrase: ``How come you don't ever hear about
 &UR; gruntled &LR;  employees?''
</P>
<P>
   Those of us in the scandalmongering dodge rely heavily on
``disgruntled former employees'' for leaks, tips and other
often-slanderous leads; in gratitude, we change their designation
to the more upbeat  &UR; whistle-blower &LR; . But they are surely in a state
of disgruntlement, and the time has come to get to the bottom of
the word.
</P>
<P>
   It begins, as great armies and New England dessert makers do,
with  &UR; grunts &LR; . These are the short, deep, guttural sounds made by
hogs, especially when eating. The word seeks to imitate the sound;
a Roman farmer was probably responsible for the Latin  &UR; grunire &LR; ,
``to grunt; to sound like a rooting pig or sickly cow.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Gruntle &LR;  is what lexicographers call a frequentive, a verb that
describes repeated or recurrent action. (Some call it
``frequentative,'' but they need preventive, not preventative,
medicine.) The frequentive of  &UR; wrest &LR;  is  &UR; wrestle &LR; ; of  &UR; prate &LR; ,
 &UR; prattle &LR; ; of  &UR; spark &LR; ,  &UR; sparkle &LR; ; and the frequentive of  &UR; grunt &LR;  is
 &UR; gruntle &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   The Oxford English Dictionary defines  &UR; gruntle &LR;  as ``to grumble,
murmur, complain,'' and cites a 1589 sermon by Robert Bruce: ``It
becomes us not to have our hearts here  &UR; gruntling &LR;  upon this
earth.''
</P>
<P>
   Haynes Goddard of Cincinnati writes to suggest that the verb
 &UR; disgruntle &LR;  means ``to deprive of the opportunity to register
dissatisfaction and complaint'' _ that is, to deny the release of a
good, loud grunt, and thereby to make the would-be gruntler sullen.
</P>
<P>
   We don't know; the OED mysteriously lists  &UR; disgruntle &LR;  as
appearing in 1682 and meaning ``to put into sulky dissatisfaction
or ill humor.'' You might think that if the old  &UR; gruntle &LR;  meant
``complain,'' then  &UR; disgruntle &LR;  would mean ``to stop from
complaining,'' but language is not always logical.
</P>
<P>
   However, thanks to a comic writer,  &UR; gruntled &LR;  _ having died as
obsolete _ has indeed made it back into the dictionaries. P.G.
Wodehouse, creator of Jeeves, wrote, in his 1938 ``Code of the
Woosters,'' ``If not actually  &UR; disgruntled &LR; , he was far from being
 &UR; gruntled &LR; .'' The OED and Merriam-Webster list that play on a word
as a back-formation from  &UR; disgruntle &LR; , and the word  &UR; gruntle &LR;  is
born again _ meaning ``to put in a good humor.''
</P>
<P>
   Wodehouse has answered the comedic question. There are, indeed,
 &UR; gruntled &LR;  employees. They're the ones with the soaring 401(k)
accounts, and those fat kittens rarely blow their whistles to
scandalmongers.
</P>
<P>
   While we're at it, and to save each other mail, let's look at
the humorous use of  &UR; couth &LR;  and  &UR; kempt &LR; , wordplay on  &UR; uncouth &LR;  and
 &UR; ill kempt &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   As the current millennium began,  &UR; kempt &LR;  meant ``combed.'' Such
personal tidiness was not always taken to be a positive: ``If a man
have a  &UR; kempt &LR;  hed,'' John Wyclif warned young women in 1380,
``thanne he is a leccherous man.'' (That same suspiciously
slicked-down hair gave rise to the pejorative  &UR; city slicker &LR; .)
</P>
<P>
   In the 16th century,  &UR; kempt &LR;  divided into  &UR; ill kempt &LR;  (slobs a
girl could trust) and  &UR; well kempt &LR; , as in James Joyce's
``Ulysses'': ``a wellkempt head, new-barbered'' and still
lecherous. Today, the seldom-used  &UR; kempt &LR;  is neutral, as if with
hair hastily combed by the fingers.
</P>
<P>
   Also a thousand years ago,  &UR; couth &LR;  meant ``known, familiar'' and
 &UR; uncouth &LR;  was ``unknown, foreign, strange'' (as the admonition to
young women later went, ``uncouth, unkissed'').  &UR; Couth &LR;  faded out,
but was back-formed and born again, thanks to Max Beerbohm in 1896.
It was popularized in a funny line delivered by a shrewd dumb-blond
character, played by Judy Holliday in Garson Kanin's 1946 ``Born
Yesterday.'' When criticized by her overbearing lover as  &UR; uncouth &LR; ,
she replied, ``I'm every bit as  &UR; couth &LR;  as you are!''
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the comic spirit of language, we still have  &UR; couth &LR; ,
 &UR; kempt &LR;  and  &UR; gruntled &LR; . Like a stand-up comedian on a sit-down
strike, I am still working at 186,300 miles per second on the
cosmological-linguistic question ``So, what's the speed of dark?''
</P>
<P>
   LOWERING THE RUSH
</P>
<P>
   Two metaphors that Democrats and Republicans were able to agree
on during the impeachment proceedings: We must not  &UR; lower the bar &LR; 
and yet we must not  &UR; rush to judgment &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   What bar? Is there a nurturing tavern on Capitol Hill known as
``the Lowered Bar''? No. Is this, as some congressional wags have
suggested, a reference to the limbo, a West Indian dance in which
the dancer bends backward and seeks to shuffle under an ever-lower
bar? Again, no.
</P>
<P>
   The old figure of speech was introduced into recent hearings by
Arthur Schlesinger Jr.: ``The  &UR; lowering of the bar &LR;  ... creates a
novel, indeed revolutionary, theory of impeachment.'' Presumably _
but not certainly _ the metaphor is derived from the high jump, in
which lowering the bar or pole makes it easier for a jumper to
clear.
</P>
<P>
   Whoa! What about the  &UR; rush to judgment &LR; ? Mark Lane, a Washington
lawyer, immortalized the phrase in a 1966 book suggesting a vast
conspiracy in the Kennedy assassination. His source was Lord
Chancellor Thomas Erskine, speaking for the defense in an 1800 case
about the attempted assassination of King George III.
</P>
<P>
   ``An attack upon the king is considered to be  &UR; parricide &LR; 
against the state,'' said Erskine, using a word meaning ``the
murder of a close relative,'' and added, ``There should be a solemn
pause before we  &UR; rush to judgement &LR; .'' Being British, he used an
extra  &UR; e &LR; . When you consider the original subject, this year's use
of the metaphor seems apt.

THE COLD, HARD REALITIES OF CASH 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN LYNCH  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ There are, I suppose, some institutions still
revered in this society _ pharmacies, maybe, or dog pounds. But
with such widespread public distrust of every institution from
hospitals to public schools to courtrooms, it always astonishes me
that so many people are so trusting of operations that survive on
loaning money.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's because I once lived in a neighborhood where most
transactions involving personal finance were conducted in the back
booth of a luncheonette. And Jimmy, the guy lending the money,
employed an interesting collection agent.
</P>
<P>
   The collection agent's name was Rocky. His tailor always left
room in Rocky's purple suitcoats for a Smith &AMP; Wesson .38-caliber
police special.
</P>
<P>
   But Dan Oliveri is, to his regret, a trusting guy. He's on
disability. He lives in the Albany suburb of Greenfield Center with
his wife, Donna, who manages a motel in the suburb of Saratoga
Springs.
</P>
<P>
   A few months ago, Oliveri hit the drive-through of his local
bank to make a deposit.
</P>
<P>
   It was for $493.54, some in checks but most of it in cash. The
teller handed him a receipt for his money. Then he drove away. Not
long after that, he paid some bills. Oliveri was disturbed to
discover that some of the checks he'd written turned out to be what
Rocky the collector would have called ``leapers.'' They bounced
higher than an NBA first-round draft choice.
</P>
<P>
   The precise amount of the shortage: $493.54. Oliveri promptly
went to his bank. He produced his deposit receipt. At which point,
it was pointed out to him, the deposit slip was not stamped. His
account number had been handwritten on the receipt, and the amount,
but the receipt had not been run through the computer printer at
the drive-up window.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told me that anybody could have written that stuff on the
receipt,'' Oliveri said. ``I'd driven through quickly, with a crowd
behind me, and I'd never noticed.''
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line? The bank had no record of the deposit. Oliveri
can't prove a thing. He's just out the money.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Jerry Goldberg. He's a retired gentleman in
Colonie, another Albany suburb. A few years ago, he went to a
finance company to take out a mortgage on his house. So every
month, like most of us, he writes a check for his mortgage payment.
Unlike most of us, however, he hand-delivers the check.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, he found out that the finance company had no record
of the mortgage check he delivers on the third of every month. So
Goldberg went to the finance company office with his receipt.
</P>
<P>
   ``They couldn't find the check,'' he told me. ``The girl said
the check was definitely lost. They searched all over. So I called
my bank on the automated thing there. It hadn't cleared. So that
same day, I gave them another check for $925.52. It made up for the
check they'd lost.''
</P>
<P>
   All of which was fine until, a few weeks later, some other
checks Goldberg has written began leaping like Michael Jordan. He
called his bank to discover that both checks he'd given the finance
company had been deposited. He'd never stopped payment on the lost
check. That, after all, costs 25 bucks. And the finance company had
assured him that the first check was nowhere to be found. Now
Goldberg faces an overdraft charge of $85.
</P>
<P>
   The moral of these stories? One, never leave a bank line, no
matter how many people are waiting impatiently behind you, without
closely inspecting your deposit receipt. And never, ever leave a
lost check floating around out there. It's just bound to come back
to bite you in the butt.
</P>
<P>
   One other piece of advice, too. Don't ever borrow money from
anybody with a collection agent who wears a purple suit. That's
experience talking.
</P>

GLITCHES DON'T DOUSE ENTHUSIASM FOR ON-LINE TRADING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By EDWARD IWATA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ There's a twist of irony in the recent computer
crashes at one popular on-line brokerage business: Rather than a
sign of failure, the problems were an indication of how successful
Internet trading has become.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys are running 100 miles an hour to keep pace,'' said
Bill Burnham, an Internet analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston in
San Francisco. ``Given the spectacular growth of on-line trading,
it's difficult for them to maintain 100 percent performance.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Chung, an on-line analyst at Williams Capital Group in
New York, said, ``A lot of firms underestimated the attractiveness
of on-line trading to the general public and they weren't quite
prepared for the onslaught of trades.''
</P>
<P>
   On-line investing has exploded in recent months, with total
volume soaring to 340,000 trades in the fourth quarter of 1998, CS
First Boston said. That represents a phenomenal one in every seven
stock trades made in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   As cyber-trading transforms the financial world, on-line
brokerage companies are struggling to absorb the crush of trading
by hundreds of thousands of investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technology and the Internet are growing at such a tremendous
pace that it's breaking new ground at every level,'' said Tracey
Gordon, a spokeswoman at Charles Schwab in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going from the Stone Age to the Space Age in a matter of
minutes, rather than centuries.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the past two years, nearly all of the top on-line brokers _
including ETrade of Palo Alto, Calif., Charles Schwab and
Ameritrade Holding Corp. of Omaha, Neb. _ have each endured several
crashes of their trading systems.
</P>
<P>
   A glitch in new software caused the trading page on ETrade's Web
site to crash several times last week, frustrating customers.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Nash, ETrade's vice president for customer management, said
the new software didn't ``fit well in its new environment,'' even
after rigorous testing.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Internet systems, you've got the potential for so many
different combinations, and they can go right or wrong,'' Nash
said. ``We take all kinds of precautions, but this was just one of
those things. We're learning a tremendous amount from our
experiences.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the technology is strong enough to handle the
onslaught of trading. On-line brokerages, though, must more quickly
adapt their computer and communications systems to the rapid growth
of their industry.
</P>
<P>
   Burnham said it could be several months before the on-line
brokers catch up to the growing demand from consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ETrade, which is spending $75 million this year on new
technology, can handle up to 170,000 trades a day _ four times its
daily average of 43,000 trades. Next month, the company will open a
third technology center near Atlanta that will triple its trading
capacity.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Charles Schwab can handle up to four times its
average volume of nearly 1 million trades a day, Gordon said. The
brokerage has five mainframe computers to handle the load.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, hundreds of investors have complained to the
Securities and Exchange Commission, which regulates the securities
industry, about problems they've endured with on-line brokerage
houses. The most common complaints include delays and errors in
processing trade orders.
</P>
<P>
   The New York state attorney general has said his office will
investigate the on-line trading industry because of consumer
complaints about Web site crashes and delays in stock trades.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   During the chaos of the October 1997 market crash, scores of
on-line investors found they couldn't get through for hours to make
trades on ETrade, Charles Schwab and other on-line sites.
</P>
<P>
   Angry investors sued ETrade, claiming the brokerage cost
customers money by failing to handle heavy volume trading ``around
the clock,'' as promised in its television and print advertising.
ETrade officials would not comment on the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the electronic brokerages have spent millions of
dollars to upgrade their services.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the Web site crashes, analysts Burnham and Chung said the
brokerage companies deserve praise. No other companies in
electronic commerce are executing transactions with customers at
such a rapid pace, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry keeps steamrolling ahead,'' Chung said. ``People
realize there will be these glitches, but they're still attracted
to the overall benefits of trading on-line.''

 &HT;    Texas has chance to improve on schools' 'end-all' measurement
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ This is a message best screened from
schoolchildren in Texas, lest they stampede in the streets, turn
over cars and set enough victory bonfires to blind a space shuttle
crew.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime in the next three years, TAAS will be no more.
</P>
<P>
   That's the Texas Assessment of Academic Skills, the bane of
every school child, rich or poor, bright or struggling, the bane of
parents, of teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, that TAAS _ the same one viewed by some observers as the
best thing Texas has done for education in a millenium or so.
</P>
<P>
   If current legislation before the Texas Legislature passes,
Texas will take a pencil and mark through TAAS.
</P>
<P>
   I meant it when I told you to screen the children from this. For
now, kids, comes the bad news. As TAAS fades to No. 2 black, a
successor will emerge, likely under a new name. It will be more
comprehensive, involving more subjects, and testing 120,000 more
students.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the contingency for which officials here at the Texas
Education Agency now prepare.
</P>
<P>
   Reforms in Senate Bill 103 would expand and broaden state
testing in the fall of 2002. The current exit test is given
starting in 10th grade. Under SB 103, authored by Sen. Teel Bivins,
R-Amarillo, and promoted by Education Commissioner Mike Moses,
graduation would hinge on a new 11th-grade exit test. Other reforms
would include testing for science in grades five, seven, and 10
(currently science is tested only in grade eight), and social
studies in grades four, eight and 10 (currently only eighth-graders
take a social studies TAAS.)
</P>
<P>
   Students would be tested at reading and math in grades three
through 11. Currently ninth-graders statewide do not take TAAS. The
writing portion would be expanded to include grade six (in addition
to the current testing in grades four, eight and 10.)
</P>
<P>
   As with everything involving TAAS, this carries as much dread as
promise, and potentially as much drag as it would provide a boost.
Most educators, if they are honest, will assert that TAAS has
become the engine that drives most wheels in Texas public schools,
and that's not good. It's dehumanizing for teachers. It undermines
the lively arts and the study of history, science and all else that
would take time away from ``the basics'' _ as if history, science
and social studies don't qualify as that.
</P>
<P>
   Worst of all, by focusing so heavily on the basics, and making a
test of minimum grade-level skills the holy grail of
accountability, Texas by design deprives students who would thrive
in more rarefied conditions. Texas thinks it is doing its best when
it rings the bell with rising TAAS scores. Actually it is only
bragging that more and more students can rise to a common
denominator that's too low to rank as excellence.
</P>
<P>
   So what do we do?
</P>
<P>
   We raise the common denominator, for one, make TAAS more
rigorous, even if it means lowering the score needed to pass.
</P>
<P>
   For another, we make it possible for some students to shed the
back-to-basics yoke throughout the year if they can demonstrate off
the bat in the fall that they have a command of grade-level basics.
Yes, let them test out of eight months of TAAS preparation.
</P>
<P>
   We make math tests that reflect true grade-level mastery. We
make composition tests real tests of real writing rather than the
gauge used today that amounts to grading a child for a rough draft
and encourages formula regurgitation.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, we need to come to grips with the rampant,
blood-sucking, mind-numbing plague that is education driven by a
test, and return to testing that's driven by education.
</P>
<P>
   Any of these objectives, if met, would be worth victory
bonfires. In three upcoming columns, I will light a few candles.

entertainment package.)

 Includes a color slide of Michelle Pfeiffer and Jeff Bridges in a
scene from ``The Fabulous Baker Boys.'' 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Love scenes mean never having to say you're sorry.
 &HT;    Except when your elbow blocks someone's closeup. Or you're
rubbing your co-star's lips raw by take 30.
 &HT;    Or if you're curled up in a car trunk with George Clooney and
having major leg cramps, as Jennifer Lopez learned making ``Out of
Sight'' (1998).
 &HT;    ``After 45 takes,'' she says, ``I was praying, `Please, let all
this cuddling be over.'''
 &HT;    In reality, not all of the movies' most celebrated love scenes
were all that romantic, at least to the stars who made them. 
 -0- 
 ``PRETTY WOMAN'' (1990)  
 &HT;    The scene: A wealthy businessman (Richard Gere) and his
enchanting hooker (Julia Roberts) relax in the tub in his luxury
hotel suite.
 &HT;    ``The bathtub scene wasn't as fun as it looked,'' Roberts
recalls. ``No one wants to spend a day in water, even if it's with
Richard Gere. Your body stocking is pinching. At one point I'm
lathering up Richard's chest for the 20th time and he goes, `Julia,
my skin is cracking open. You've got to stop using the soap on
me.'''
 ``DIRTY DANCING'' (1987)  
 &HT;    The scene: A poor dance instructor (Patrick Swayze) and a rich
college girl (Jennifer Grey) crawl passionately toward one another
across the floor of a Catskills dance studio.
 &HT;    ``A few days before we did the scene, my knee mysteriously
filled with fluid,'' Swayze says. ``I had to have it drained with a
needle. Needless to say, it was no picnic crawling on it. I might
look like I'm happy and in love, but I was in horrible pain.''
 ``A STAR IS BORN'' (1976)  
 &HT;    The scene: A singer on his way down (Kris Kristofferson) and his
wife, a singer on her way up (Barbra Streisand), express their love
in a tub.
 &HT;    ``It's my favorite scene of the film,'' Kristofferson says,
``but it was tough. I remember our producer, Jon Peters, was also
Barbra's boyfriend at the time. He wanted me to wear a wetsuit in
the tub _ I guess he was jealous. I would have been jealous of me,
too.
 &HT;    ``In the end, I did wear some boxer shorts in the tub. It's
disappointing, because it would be a better story if I wore
nothing.''
 ``BULL DURHAM'' (1988)  
 &HT;    The scene: An aging baseball player (Kevin Costner) and a
philosophical fan (Susan Sarandon) finally get up close and
personal with each other.
 &HT;    ``We approached these scenes from a perspective of fun,''
Sarandon says with a laugh. ``Kevin and I knew we had to have movie
sex in a tub, sex on the kitchen table and so on. We wanted to look
like it was the best time in our lives.
 &HT;    ``I remember being nervous and hoping he moved in the right
angles to hide parts of my body.''
 ``THE BRIDGES OF MADISON COUNTY'' (1995)  
 &HT;    The scene: An Iowa housewife (Meryl Streep) and her photographer
lover (Clint Eastwood) realize that she can never leave her family.
On his way out of town, they spot each other and gaze longingly
across the road neither will cross.
 &HT;    ``It's my favorite scene,'' Streep says. ``I remember we shot it
in the rain. Clint is standing there with his hair plastered to his
forehead, and the entire time I was wishing the script could change
and my character would go to him.
 &HT;    ``But that would have ruined the movie.''
 ``OUT OF SIGHT'' (1998)  
 &HT;    The scene: A fugitive (George Clooney) breaks out of jail,
stuffs a federal marshall (Jennifer Lopez) in the trunk of the
getaway car and slips in next to her. His buddy drives off, leaving
the two to get acquainted.
 &HT;    ``We did 45 takes, which took two days,'' Lopez says. ``What I
remember the most is that I could curl up like that for about four
hours and then I needed a break. I needed to stretch.''
 &HT;    Clooney has a different take on the scene.
 &HT;    ``We rehearsed the scene on the very creaky couch in my office,
which was fun,'' he says roguishly. ``Later, it was funny because
we had to do reshoots on the trunk scene. I was like, `Yes! Yes!
Yes!'
 &HT;    ``Then I said, `Really? That's too bad.'''
 ``AS GOOD AS IT GETS'' (1997)  
 &HT;    The scene: Nasty Melvin Udall (Jack Nicholson) finally softens,
telling his might-be girlfriend (Helen Hunt) why they belong
together: ``You make me want to be a better man.''
 &HT;    ``I loved doing this scene,'' Nicholson says. ``We didn't have
to do too many takes, but I remember thinking, `This is one of the
most beautiful things I've ever heard one human being say to
another.'''
 &HT;    Hunt agrees: ``I teared up for real every time he said the
line.''
 ``THE MASK OF ZORRO'' (1998)  
 &HT;    The scene: The dashing Zorro (Antonio Banderas) matches swords
with a beautiful maiden (Catherine Zeta Jones) and, in the
processes, whittles away at her dress until it finally comes off.
 &HT;    ``My dress was attached by wires,'' Jones recalls. ``All of a
sudden someone offstage pulled a string and, whoosh, I was almost
nude. Antonio had this devastating smirk the entire time.''
 &HT;    ``The only bad part is that Catherine slashed my back a little
bit during the scene,'' Banderas adds jokingly. ``Also, I came home
and told my wife, Melanie Griffith, about it and ... well, I still
have the bruise.''
 ``THE FABULOUS BAKER BOYS'' (1989)  
 &HT;    The scene: A sultry singer (Michelle Pfeiffer) slithers across a
piano singing ``Makin' Whoopee'' to her handsome pianist (Jeff
Bridges).
 &HT;    ``I thought that either I would look like the biggest fool alive
or the scene would be cinematically great,'' Pfeiffer says. ``I
trusted the director, who said, `I promise I won't make you look
like a fool.' I said, `But I'm standing on top of a piano. How can
I not look like a fool?'
 &HT;    ``Plus that dress was very slippery. I was worried about falling
off the piano, which thankfully didn't happen.''
 ``SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE'' (1998)  
 &HT;    The scene: The Bard (Joseph Fiennes) and his lady love (Gwyneth
Paltrow) spend a day in bed, reading to each other from his new
play, ``Romeo and Juliet.''
 &HT;    ``I remember thinking during the filming that we were getting
it,'' Paltrow recalls. ``We were conveying the passions of these
people in a beautiful, seamless way.''
 &HT;    Fiennes takes a less romantic view, however.
 &HT;    ``Oh, it wasn't as glamorous as one might think,'' he says.
``Let's start with the fact that Gwyneth's boyfriend, Ben Affleck,
is in the movie, and he's a big guy. You don't want to get on the
wrong side of Ben and say, `Guess what? I will be spending the
duration of the day in bed with your girlfriend.''
 ``PRETTY IN PINK'' (1986)  
 &HT;    The scene: The high-school prom. The poor girl (Molly Ringwald)
dances with the school geek (Jon Cryer) who's always been madly in
love with her.
 &HT;    ``The day we shot the big dance scene I had the flu,'' Ringwald
says. ``Every single time poor Jon would twirl me around, I would
have to say, `Excuse me.' Then I would run in the corner and throw
up. It wasn't exactly romantic.''
 ``JERRY MAGUIRE'' (1996)  
 &HT;    The scene: A sports agent (Tom Cruise) returns to his estranged
wife (Renee Zellweger) and tells her, ``You complete me.''
 &HT;    ``The day Tom looked in my eyes and said that line was
fantastic,'' Zellweger says. ``We did 15 takes. When it was over, I
was actually shaking.
 &HT;    ``I remember I sat down in this fake kitchen and Tom came in. He
sat down next to me and smiled, and then said, `Renee, just think _
we'll be together forever.'
 &HT;    ``Of course, he meant on the screen.''

`ER'S' GEORGE CLOONEY ANSWERS HIS FINAL CALL

 Includes a color slide of George Clooney in a scene from ``ER.'' 
 By DAVID KRONKE  
 c.1999 TV Guide Canada  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As he prepares to leave NBC's hit series ``ER,'' George Clooney
is being showered with praise for his acting abilities. After all,
dozens of critics say, it's his talent more than anything else
which has made the show television's highest-rated drama.
</P>
<P>
   Just don't expect him to agree. When I interviewed Clooney in
his trailer outside the ``ER'' soundstage a couple of years ago, he
did his best to convince me he wasn't much of an actor.
</P>
<P>
   ``As an actor, I'm somewhat of a hack,'' he said, perfectly
seriously. ``I find myself stealing from the actors that I really
like, as opposed to coming up with interesting choices of my own.
The truth is, you don't have to be a great actor on a show that's
this well written.''
</P>
<P>
   He recalled appearing on stage before an audience which included
his uncle, Oscar-winning actor/director Jose Ferrer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was crying and yelling and spitting and doing everything in
it,'' Clooney said. ``Jose was sitting in the back, and afterward I
went to him and said, `What do you think?'
</P>
<P>
   ``And he said, `Get the scenery out of your mouth, you don't
know where it's been!'''
</P>
<P>
   Clooney freely admitted that the constraints of a television
production schedule make series acting much different from film or
stage work.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're working on a TV series and a director comes in,
you can't really do what they tell you,'' he said. ``They come on
the show and want to make their episode something special _ `This
is the one where Dr. Ross cries.' But you can't do every one of
those. So you learn how to direct yourself and not pay attention to
the director.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll say, `Do it this way,' and you'll say, `Yeah, yeah,
yeah' _ and you'll do it your way, and everything is moving too
fast for them to notice.''
</P>
<P>
   Doing it his way has worked out for Clooney. He's leaving ``ER''
to focus on a film career which so far has drawn critical praise
more often than box-office gold.
</P>
<P>
   Don't look for Dr. Ross to have a memorable death scene, a la
Det. Bobby Simone's much-hyped departure from ``NYPD Blue'' in fall
1998. Clooney isn't burning any bridges _ he's already made it
known that he's up for an occasional return to the series. There
may be a few golden eggs left in the proverbial goose, and the
canny Clooney isn't ruling anything out.
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, executive producer John Wells has opted not to make
the actor's departure part of any sort of season-ending
cliff-hanger, but to incorporate it into the season's natural arc
of stories, much as the series did when Sherry Stringfield left
several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Clooney comes by that show-business savvy naturally. He hails
from a show-business family _ besides Ferrer, singer Rosemary
Clooney is his aunt and actor/television host Nick Clooney is his
father _ and has paid his Hollywood dues. Before scoring with
``ER,'' he had done his share of failed pilots, had been jettisoned
from 1990's ``Baby Talk'' before it even hit the air and had done
time as a supporting player on a few successful series, ``The Facts
of Life,'' ``Roseanne'' and ``Sisters.''
</P>
<P>
   So he came in knowing how Hollywood works, how something as
simple as a lucky break or a good time slot can make the difference
between obscurity and global stardom, and he was able to maximize
the benefits of his success on ``ER,'' neither bailing out at the
first opportunity _ as, for example, David Caruso did with ``NYPD
Blue'' _ nor staying so long on the series that it stifled his
big-screen potential.
</P>
<P>
   And to date ``potential'' is the key word for Clooney's career
as a movie star.
</P>
<P>
   His two most impressive performances _ opposite Michelle
Pfeiffer in the slight-but-charming romantic comedy ``One Fine
Day'' (1996) and as a raffish criminal in ``Out of Sight'' (1998) _
both suffered from bad timing: The former was bulldozed at the box
office by Tom Cruise's ``Jerry Maguire,'' which was released a week
later, while ``Out of Sight'' was a subtle, intricately paced crime
comedy/drama that foundered amid the leviathans of summer 1998.
</P>
<P>
   His other films have been less distinguished. ``The Peacemaker''
(1997) was a turgid political thriller, heavy on technobabble and
light on chemistry between Clooney and co-star Nicole Kidman.
``From Dusk Till Dawn'' (1997) was a cheesy B movie _ one with some
style, but a cheesy B movie nonetheless _ while ``Batman &AMP; Robin''
(1997) was a brain-dead behemoth swamped in the kind of lavish
special effects that are antithetical to an actor like Clooney,
whose appeal lies in his relaxed, easygoing charm.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the stakes are high as he leaves ``ER.'' His viability as
a leading man will probably be determined by his first couple of
post-television films, which makes it all the more troubling that
he isn't sure exactly what they'll be.
</P>
<P>
   Recently ``Leatherheads,'' an early-days-of-football piece that
would have reunited him with ``Out of Sight'' director Steven
Soderbergh, was cancelled before it went into production.
</P>
<P>
   He's currently working on ``Three Kings,'' a film about a trio
of Gulf War soldiers with a little time on their hands who decide
to hunt for a lost gold reserve. His unlikely co-stars include
rapper/model-turned-actor Mark Wahlberg and rapper Ice Cube. Behind
the camera is David O. Russell, who wrote and directed Ben
Stiller's knockabout, love-hurts comedy, ``Flirting with Disaster''
(1996).
</P>
<P>
   Shrewdly, however, Clooney is hedging his bets. He may be
dreaming of movie stardom, but he's keeping his hand in on the
television front as well. His production company is developing
``Blood Brothers,'' an hour-long mob drama, for CBS, as well as
``Double Helix,'' a drama written by Mike Werb and Michael
Colleary, who wrote ``Face/Off'' (1997).
</P>
<P>
   The actor also has a production deal with HBO and Warner Bros.
Television, which produces ``ER,'' to mount ``Kilroy,'' a
laugh-track-free comedy in which a fictional aspiring actor will
visit the sets of real-life television shows. His fictional
``gigs'' will be actual appearances on the real shows _ a
mind-bending wrinkle reminiscent of ``The Larry Sanders Show,''
which clearly appeals to Clooney.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he's fascinated by the retro-possibilities of live
television. Clooney was one of the principal movers behind ``ER's''
famous live episode, and has several live television movies in the
works for CBS. Possible subjects include a remake of Sidney Lumet's
``Fail-Safe'' (1964) and ``Murrow and Me,'' a biography of the
famed television-journalism pioneer Edward R. Murrow. He plans to
appear in the former, and perhaps in the latter as well.
</P>
<P>
   As for ``ER,'' Clooney's departure comes at an awkward time, the
same season that NBC agreed to break the bank and fork over a
not-even-close-to-precedented $13 million an episode.
</P>
<P>
   The show's biggest star will not be replaced, at least not in so
many words. The series' ratings have remained strong, and the
producers will play up existing characters and story lines rather
than importing a new actor or an established star to take up
Clooney's slack.
</P>
<P>
   Noah Wyle would seem to be the biggest benefactor of Clooney's
exit, which leaves open the position of resident hunk. But don't
count out Eriq La Salle, who has never gotten the attention that
the caliber of his performances ought to warrant. That may be
changing, however _ the week after Clooney leaves, ``ER'' will
showcase La Salle in one of those periodic episodes that focuses on
one character.
</P>
<P>
   In short, fans of ``ER'' and of George Clooney need not worry,
at least initially. Neither the series' staying power nor the
actor's career shows much sign of a weakening pulse.

 Includes a color slide of Tony Randall and Jack Klugman with
William Ragsdale and Sean O'Bryan in a scene from ``Brother's
Keeper.'' 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Call it a two-for-one sale _ two great actors, that is, for one
terrific team.
 &HT;    Jack Klugman and Tony Randall are used to working in tandem. The
two are old pals, not to mention co-stars not only of television's
beloved series ``The Odd Couple'' (1970-1975) and a 1993 reunion
telemovie, but also of numerous stage plays and television
commercials.
 &HT;    On Feb. 19 they'll be back, turning up in the ABC sitcom
``Brother's Keeper,'' in a episode entitled ``An Odd Couple of
Days.''
 &HT;    What convinced them to agree to this latest pairing?
 &HT;    ``That's easy,'' Randall says by telephone from his New York
apartment.
 &HT;    ``A lot of money,'' Klugman says by telephone from his Los
Angeles home.
 &HT;    Ba-da-bing!
 &HT;    ``For television, we actually don't get that many offers to work
together,'' the 76-year-old Klugman says more seriously, his voice
still hoarse after a successful battle with throat cancer. ``Tony
and I work together mostly in the theater.
 &HT;    ``In this case,'' he says, ``the show's producer, Jonathan
Axelrod, was the son of a friend of Tony's. He gave us carte
blanche in terms of improvising and doing anything we wanted. That
made it very attractive.''
 &HT;    Randall, who will turn 79 on Feb. 26, interrupts.
 &HT;    ``Jack put his finger on it right away,'' he says. ``They paid
us a lot of money.''
 &HT;    And the two share a laugh.
 &HT;    For those not familiar with ``Brother's Keeper,'' it's a sitcom
nestled in ABC's family-friendly Friday-night schedule. The show
revolves around 8-year-old Oscar (Justin Cooper), who lives with
his straitlaced father (William Ragsdale) and his father's brother
(Sean O'Bryan), a likable but chronically reckless sports star.
 &HT;    In the upcoming episode, Ragsdale and O'Bryan encounter Klugman
and Randall, who play bickering brothers-in-law, and wonder if
they're seeing their own future before them.
 &HT;    ``It'll be familiar stuff,'' Randall says. ``We play characters
people are pretty accustomed to seeing us play. We get into
struggles and we fight.''
 &HT;    The episode marks the first time in 24 years that Klugman and
Randall have teamed for a sitcom.
 &HT;    ``It was 1975 that we finished `The Odd Couple,''' Randall says.
``But it's really like riding a bike when Jack and I work together.
We did long runs of `Odd Couple' as a play, and we did `The
Sunshine Boys' for eight months last year, a good part of that on
Broadway. We work together frequently.''
 &HT;    ``As often as we can,'' Klugman says.
 &HT;    Some actors have resisted being paired with the same performer
too often _ Richard Burton famously warned Elizabeth Taylor that he
didn't want them to turn into Laurel and Hardy _ but Randall and
Klugman don't mind at all.
 &HT;    ``We work well together,'' Randall says. ``I guess that's
obvious. It's a pleasure to work with Jack.''
 &HT;    ``We appreciate each other,'' Klugman says. ``We work the same
way. It's good to work together a lot, because you get to know the
other person.
 &HT;    ``You get a sense of comfort, but also a spontaneity that you
can spark in each other,'' he adds. ``On stage, we're confident we
can do anything, and we know the other guy will be there to support
it.''
 &HT;    ``And there's no competition between us,'' Randall says.
 &HT;    ``It's very, very rare,'' Klugman concludes, ``to find someone
you can act with who makes you feel so comfortable.''
 &HT;    Randall's career dates back to 1941 and his stage debut in the
play ``The Circle of Chalk.'' His numerous subsequent credits
include the movies ``Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?'' (1957),
three Doris Day-Rock Hudson outings and ``The King of Comedy''
(1983). On television he's starred in ``Mr. Peepers'' (1952-1955)
and ``Love, Sidney'' (1981-1983), while on the stage he's appeared
in everything from ``The Music Man'' to ``M. Butterfly.''
 &HT;    Since 1991, Randall has immersed himself in his dream project,
The National Actors Theatre, a not-for-profit company that stages a
variety of shows each season.
 &HT;    Klugman launched his career in 1949 opposite Rod Steiger in the
play ``Stevedore,'' and subsequently appeared in ``Mr. Roberts''
and ``Gypsy,'' as well as a 1998 production of ``Death of a
Salesman'' in Los Angeles. His films include ``12 Angry Men''
(1957), ``Days of Wine and Roses'' (1962) and ``Dear God'' (1996).
 &HT;    On television, Klugman acted in several classic episodes of
``The Twilight Zone,'' starred as the title character in ``Quincy,
M.E.'' (1976-1983) and won an Emmy for a 1964 appearance on ``The
Defenders.''
 &HT;    And, along the way, they met each other.
 &HT;    ``We met doing a show people mention frequently,'' Randall says,
deadpan. ``I bet people think of it all the time.''
 &HT;    He and Klugman crack up.
 &HT;    ``It was called `Appointment with Adventure,''' Randall says.
``That was sometime in the last century.''
 &HT;    ``It was 1954,'' Klugman says. ``It was a summer replacement.
Shows would play all winter, and in the summer a stock company
would come in with a replacement.
 &HT;    ``Who was in it with us, Tony?''
 &HT;    ``Gena Rowlands,'' Randall says. ``She was the only good thing
in it.''
 &HT;    Klugman laughs.
 &HT;    ``It was terrible,'' he says. ``Terrible.''
 &HT;    ``Jack played a gangster and I was a professor,'' Randall says.
``It was really bad.''
 &HT;    It never occurred to either actor that, 45 years later, they'd
still be friends, still sharing the stage and screen.
 &HT;    ``No, no, no,'' they say simultaneously.
 &HT;    ``We didn't see each other for almost 20 years after that
show,'' Klugman says. ``Until we did `Odd Couple.'''
 &HT;    Airing from 1970 to 1975, ``The Odd Couple'' cemented the
perception of Randall and Klugman as comedians. Both men swear,
rather unconvincingly, that the label doesn't bother them.
 &HT;    ``Whatever the public likes is fine,'' Randall says. ``They
decide, but we know better.''
 &HT;    ``In the final analysis,'' Klugman adds, ``you can get
categorized, but if you categorize yourself or put yourself in a
pigeonhole, then you become that type.
 &HT;    ``When I was up for `Odd Couple,''' he recalls, ``they said to
Garry Marshall, `But he only does drama. He can't do comedy.' Then
when I was doing `Quincy' they said, `He only does comedy. He can't
do drama.' You can't listen to anything they say.''
 &HT;    ``People only remember the last thing they saw,'' Randall says.
``That's not only the public, it's the people who give jobs. And
it'll never change.
 &HT;    ``After I did `The Seven Faces of Dr. Lao'' (1964),'' he
recalls, ``I was offered nothing but ancient Orientals! It sounds
ridiculous, but it's true. For one of the movies I couldn't do they
got John Gielgud _ I've always liked that.''
 &HT;    ``I never knew that, Tony,'' Klugman says, chuckling. ``Look,
it's just a way of a studio protecting itself, protecting its
dollars.''
 &HT;    Randall and Klugman are both busy with a variety of activities.
Randall, the father of a 2-year-old daughter and an 8-month-old
son, is gearing up for the National Actors Theatre production of
``The Night Must Fall,'' starring Matthew Broderick. Klugman, the
father of two grown sons, hopes to star soon in a two-hour
``Quincy'' movie for television.
 &HT;    Later this year, the two will return to the stage for a
production of Tom Stoppard's ``Rough Crossing.'' If a Florida
tryout proves popular, they'll take the show to Broadway.
 &HT;    ``We've actually found two or three plays we might do in the
future,'' Randall says. ``The public likes to see us together, it
seems. That's good, because Jack and I like to work together.''
 &HT;    ``We've got a good thing going,'' Klugman says. ``Why stop
now?''

 Includes a color slide of Elizabeth Hurley with Jeff Daniels in a
scene from ``My Favorite Martian.'' 
 By JEANNE WOLF and SHEP MORGAN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Elizabeth Hurley isn't always as sexy as she looks in those
television commercials.
 &HT;    If you're in any doubt, check out her latest film, ``My Favorite
Martian,'' opening Feb. 12. The adaptation of the old television
series features Hurley and a great deal of mugging _ or, as she and
other Brits call it, ``pulling faces.''
 &HT;    ``I went to a screening this week, and I found myself quite
frightening,'' she says. ``I make those faces all the time in real
life, and now I realize what I must look like. From now on I'm
going to try to imagine that my features are frozen so I'll never
pull another face again.''
 &HT;    Director Dan Petrie has praised Hurley's willingness to set
aside her supermodel image to deliver the kind of off-the-wall
performance the film required.
 &HT;    ``I think you just have to throw away your inhibitions,'' she
says with a shrug. ``Otherwise every day on that set would have
been excruciating. If you get self-conscious, you're a goner. You
just have to close your eyes, take a deep breath and say to
yourself, `OK, get silly!'''
 &HT;    One particularly silly scene finds Hurley possessed by the title
alien, to the point of sprouting tentacles.
 &HT;    ``I practiced alone in my trailer for that scene,'' she admits.
``But occasionally Chris Lloyd, who plays the Martian, would come
by to give me a few tips. That was actually a nightmare, because
there I was, contorting my body for this brilliant comedian while
he was critiquing me.''
 &HT;    Hurley's character is an obnoxious television reporter, but she
denies modeling her on any single real person.
 &HT;    ``I can tell you it was not Barbara Walters,'' the actress says
with a laugh. ``Actually, it was sort of my revenge on some of the
reporters who've tortured me in interviews over the years. I just
sort of made a composite of all the worst so-called journalists
I've had to face, and there was my character.
 &HT;    ``It was actually quite liberating to play someone so beastly,''
she adds. ``Normally you get so obsessed with making yourself
charming and likable _ it was actually quite nice to forget all
that and just be a cow.''
 &HT;    There's nothing noticeably bovine about Hurley as she relaxes in
a Hollywood hotel suite. Her stunning beauty is set off by a pair
of tightfitting leather jeans and a form-hugging black sweater.
 &HT;    ``Normally it takes me a few good hours of hair and makeup to
look good on camera,'' she insists. ``People who see me looking
groomed and perfect in those cosmetics commercials don't realize
how much work it takes. In real life I like to dress down.
 &HT;    ``Actually, I think being pretty can sometimes be a liability,''
she adds. ``People think you're not very smart or interesting.
 &HT;    ``I fell into that trap the other day,'' Hurley admits.
``Somebody was talking about a very handsome actor for a dramatic
part, and I made a face. I realized I was thinking, `He's probably
too gorgeous to have any depth.' That's a hideously unfair
assumption _ it's absolute rubbish that people who look good can't
be clever.''
 &HT;    The actress has spent the last couple of years working to prove
that she's more than a pretty face. She and her longtime boyfriend,
actor Hugh Grant, have their own production company, Simian
Productions. They produced ``Extreme Measures,'' which fizzled at
the box office in 1997, and have another coming later this year.
 &HT;    ``It's called `Mickey Blue Eyes,''' she says. ``It's sort of a
romantic comedy about the Mafia. Hugh is the leading man, and he's
very, very funny in it. I think it's his best acting in a long
time. He spends half the movie trying to become a New York
goodfella with some help from James Caan, but he just can't get it
together.
 &HT;    ``Being a producer is not nearly as cushy as being an actor,''
Hurley adds with a laugh. ``When you're acting, you do your 10
weeks' work and get spoiled rotten, and very well paid to boot.
When I'm producing I spend a lot of time taking care of those perks
for my stars, and I don't get any.
 &HT;    ``But I love having the control over what we're doing. If things
don't work out you have no one to blame but yourself, and I rather
like that.''
 &HT;    When they aren't working, Hurley says, she and Grant hardly lead
glamorous lives.
 &HT;    ``We don't actually go out that much at the moment,'' she says,
``but I don't sit at home and watch TV, either. I don't have a set.
I probably haven't watched an entire program in 25 years _ I just
don't have the patience to sit still that long.''
 &HT;    The two spend much of the year in Los Angeles, but Hurley misses
her native Britain.
 &HT;    ``There's no street life here,'' she says. ``Nobody walks around
or sits at an outdoor cafe or anything. But I do find that I have a
little more privacy here. If you think the tabloid press is bad in
Hollywood, you should go to London _ the English press is insane.''
 &HT;    Few have endured the kind of press blitz that Grant and Hurley
faced after his 1995 arrest for soliciting a prostitute, and Hurley
says that she's still dealing with the consequences.
 &HT;    ``You have to be careful not to cocoon yourself,'' she says.
``Suddenly you find you're missing out on life. You say to
yourself, `I want to sit at a sidewalk cafe and watch people pass
by, because that was one of the favorite things that I ever did.'
You start to do your own grocery shopping again, just because it
feels weird not to do what normal people do.
 &HT;    ``Gradually you find a way to live with people staring at you
and stuff, as long as you feel safe. I live much more normally now
than I did a couple of years ago.''
 &HT;    Looking ahead, Hurley denies any master plan behind her rather
eclectic choice of projects.
 &HT;    ``I kind of look at a stack of scripts in the office and take
what seems best and right to do at the moment,'' she says,
laughing. ``However, I do get bored when I see a part that begins,
`A beautiful girl pulls up in a sports car, gets out and takes off
her dark glasses.' That's when I hear a voice in my head saying, `I
don't think so.'''
 &HT;    Next up is a cameo appearance in the sequel to ``Austin Powers:
International Man of Mystery,'' her surprise hit of 1997.
 &HT;    ``I wasn't disappointed that I don't last for the whole movie,''
she says. ``Austin Powers is like James Bond, he wants a new Pussy
Galore in every film. Anyway, the original was such a huge hit that
it gave my career a tremendous boost.
 &HT;    ``What's strange is, I get all these little boys coming up to me
wherever I go who loved the movie,'' she adds. ``They want me in a
silver miniskirt. It's a little bizarre, but quite cute.''
 &HT;    Those young fans don't get her thinking about a family of her
own, though.
 &HT;    ``My sister has two children, and I've become an extremely good
aunt,'' she says. ``I was a bit scared of them at first _ I didn't
have the faintest idea of how to talk to them. But now I'm
absolutely in love with them.''
 &HT;    Hurley pulls a face.
 &HT;    ``I don't think I'm quite ready to be a mother myself,'' she
adds. ``I don't think I'm that responsible. But, you know,
gradually I am getting more grown up.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   In Danby, Vt., about a dozen miles north of Manchester, Vermont
Country Bird Houses manufactures stylish homes for your tweety
friends.
</P>
<P>
   Created by Jim Kardas, who began the business after retreating
from 20 years in advertising, the handmade bird houses are designed
and sized to accommodate the needs of specific birds. Features
include removable panels for seasonal cleaning, ventilation and
drainage.
</P>
<P>
   Inspiration comes from historic Vermont structures: churches,
schools and cottages. Also available are three- and five-structure
bird villages. During the company's winter sale, on through the end
of March, prices range from $89 to $175; village sets cost up to
$500. Order by calling 888-440-0226, visiting the Web site,
http://www.vermontcountry.com or stopping by the shop, on Danby's
Main Street.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   EASIER LISTENING: A company called RangeStar makes a little
gizmo that clips onto the antenna of digital (PCS) mobile phones
and promises to improve the phone's performance significantly, in
several ways: by increasing the range by 100 percent or more,
decreasing the number of dropped calls by 80 percent, improving
call clarity and extending battery life by 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, the product changes the shape of the outgoing
signal to reduce, by 86 percent, the amount of signal going into
the user's head. In 1997, the mobile-phone market was split almost
evenly between conventional cellular (analog) and digital mobile
phones; digital will, by 2001, account for 90 percent of the
estimated $55 billion worth of business worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Order the $30 RangeStar PCS Antenna by calling the company
directly, at 877-966-3371, or visiting its Web site,

   WALLET ALERT: We're not sure what a beeping billfold has to do
with the year 2000, but that's how a company called Kopel Inc. is
trumpeting its new entry into that field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Credit card protection for the new millennium,'' reads the
headline of its news release. Peculiar pitch notwithstanding, the
product sounds like a good idea: When a card (debit, ATM, charge,
credit) or passport is removed from its slot, the wallet beeps a
few times every 20 seconds until the card is replaced. The wallets,
which resemble standard moneyholders, come in various sizes and
styles, for men and women, priced from $14 to $38.
</P>
<P>
   Because each slot must be filled, the wallets come with filler
cards, in case you're short of plastic. The wallet's beep is
controlled by a tiny microchip and a replaceable watch battery with
a three-year warranty. To order, call 800-988-6255 or visit the Web
site, http://www.beepingwallet.com.

LEAVING ONE'S RELIGION AT THE DOOR?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A column about the pope will always stir up readers _ which is
why I only write one every 20 years or so. The latest was last
week's offering criticizing Missouri Gov. Mel Carnahan for
commuting a convicted killer's death sentence at the urging of Pope
John Paul II.
</P>
<P>
   To buttress my argument that public officials should not kowtow
to religious leaders on matters of public policy, I cited the
example of President John F. Kennedy, a Roman Catholic who promised
the voters during his 1960 campaign that he would follow the
dictates of the Constitution, not the pope, in carrying out his
presidential duties.
</P>
<P>
   Some readers agreed; some didn't. A few of the dissenters were
fans of the pope; some had no apparent interest in the pope but had
plenty of interest in capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   And one of the most interesting responses came from a reader who
took issue with my contention that public officials should park
religion at the door when doing the public's business:
</P>
<P>
   ``This week is National Catholic Schools Week. During this week,
we celebrate the many accomplishments of our Catholic schools,
students and teachers. I personally take great pride in having
attended Catholic schools for twelve years. My parents made many,
many sacrifices to send my eight siblings and me to Catholic
schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``My children, and all my nieces and nephews, have attended or
are currently attending Catholic schools. Obviously, my siblings
and I think that a Catholic education is a tradition we want to
pass on to the next generation.
</P>
<P>
   ``And now, that brings me to why I am writing to you. My whole
purpose in sending my children to Catholic schools is to make
certain that the values that I teach at home are reinforced at
school. I want to make certain that those values permeate every
facet of their lives. I want to make certain that every thought,
that every decision, and that every action they take is made after
thoughtful consideration of the values that define Catholicism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want them to know that in life you don't compartmentalize
the secular vs. the religious, and the public vs. the private. You
don't leave your values at home. You are who you are, regardless of
whether you are conducting business at church, at home, at school,
or at work. This is true even if that work is government or
politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell my children that if they run for public office and win,
the victory should be for who they are _ not because they will
mindlessly carry out today's perception of what is popular. When
you vote, you should vote for the individual who most closely
believes what you believe, and who values what you value.
</P>
<P>
   ``You then trust, unless presented with facts to the contrary,
that the individual will make the right choice when presented with
facts that the general public does not know. ... you believe that
the individual is a person of honor and integrity, and will
represent you accordingly. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``If JFK chooses to divorce himself from his Catholicity to win
public office, then so be it. If you choose to divorce yourself
from your Catholicity to sell newspapers, then so be it. But don't
tell my children or those of other Catholic parents that that is
the only way. It is NOT.''
</P>
<P>
   That all sounds pretty good _ especially the part about
``compartmentalizing,'' which has recently become a popular catch
phrase for the rationalization that a politician's private conduct
has nothing to do with his or her fitness for public office. Surely
a moral society has a right to expect that its leaders will respect
and adhere to that society's values.
</P>
<P>
   And we certainly should expect our leaders to bring their values
to bear in making decisions that affect the public. What we don't
expect public officials to do is impose any particular religious
beliefs or the rules of any church on a citizenry that may not
subscribe to those specific beliefs or rules.
</P>
<P>
   The Constitution of the United States guarantees the separation
of church and state. In America, that is the only way.

LET'S END THE IMPEACHMENT CHARADE 
</HEADLINE>
   (With: LYNCH-CONVICT)  
 Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By FRED LeBRUN  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Heaven help us, it's almost over and not a day
too soon.
</P>
<P>
   About the only memorable moment from the Republicans' endless
impeachment trial of the president was that scream of angst from
the Senate gallery on Thursday. An ordinary citizen, neatly dressed
and bearded and clearly frustrated, couldn't stand it anymore and
finally shouted down to the proceedings: ``God almighty, take the
vote and get it over with.''
</P>
<P>
   That unidentified individual spoke for Americans from coast to
coast, for the vast majority of us. Which is a great deal more than
you can say for the Republicans in Congress who deliberately turned
their backs on the people to indulge themselves in a relentless
partisan hounding of President Clinton while cloaking the shameless
process with a mythical higher calling.
</P>
<P>
   It's also more than you can say about those pundits and
supporters of the hypocritical Republicans, including newspaper
columnists like my pontificating colleague Dan Lynch. For a year
now we've been regularly treated to ever shriller and more strident
denunciations of the president. ``Impeach, impeach'' has been his
steady cranky subtext, well-larded with hokum Constitutional wisdom
for justification. He has tried to shepherd us with a two-by-four
into the Republican camp, and he too has failed.
</P>
<P>
   His reaction, and those of fellow travelers like national
columnist George Will, are amusing. They blame the people for not
getting it. Here they are, columnists paid to persuade with their
superior intellects. Yet when the public instead embraces Clinton
with the highest popularity rating of any president in peace time,
they fault the American people as too dumb to figure out what they
ought to think. Namely: Don't you understand that this is a
critical moment in our nation's history and that the president is a
criminal?
</P>
<P>
   Well, no, we don't. Along with not telling the people they're
too stupid to have the right opinion on the impeachment, maybe it's
also not a good plan to insist on what the news is. News, like
cream and less elegant organic matter, rises to the top. The
American people have spoken resoundingly on what the news is here.
Wall Street is mercurial, but not because of the soap opera in
Washington, and continues in its bullish ways. Folks go about their
business forgetting for days at a time that only the second
impeachment trial in our history is taking place.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the people are showing by their behavior that
it's a nice sideshow going on inside the Beltway, but it is not
significant enough to bump ``Melrose Place.''
</P>
<P>
   History will vindicate the Republican position, says the chief
House prosecutor, Rep. Henry Hyde of Illinois. Talk about the last
bastion of the crackpot, it has to be ``no one understands I'm a
genius, but future generations will.
</P>
<P>
   Please. I will not presume what history will say about all this,
but if the contemporary reaction is at least a clue, I think we can
expect a footnote and an asterisk and that's about it. Another
pathetic testament to how badly the self-righteous right misjudged
how the rest of us would react to the presidential affair.
</P>
<P>
   That's right, an affair. Sex. That's what it was always about
from the beginning, rant as much as you like about perjury and
obstruction of justice. The naked truth is that every aspect of
every charge against the president is within the context of a
sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky. Lying about sex is about
sex. Gifts, jobs and all the rest _ sex. The American people
figured that out right off, shrugged their collective shoulders,
generally agreed Bill Clinton had the morals of a smarmy brush
salesman on the road, but also decided that seamy personal behavior
isn't impeachable, or our problem.
</P>
<P>
   It's Hillary's problem. No Harvard law degree necessary. End of
story. We should be so lucky. This week, maybe, the windbags can
pull themselves from the keyhole and end this travesty. Then after
a cold shower perhaps Congress can do what it hasn't done for some
time _ get back to work.

<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Barring some miracle, the Senate will vote this
week against throwing President Clinton out of the White House.
This probably will be your fault.
</P>
<P>
   Or, more precisely, it will be the fault of people who think the
way you think, which is most people. When you pluck away the
feathers _ and, man, have we had feathers flying around in this one
_ the naked corpse of their argument shapes up like this:
</P>
<P>
   1. He didn't really lie under oath. And if he did it wasn't
perjury. And if it was perjury it was perjury over sex. And if it
was perjury over sex it doesn't count. And I would have done that,
too. And if you wouldn't have done it, too, then you're really
stupid.
</P>
<P>
   2. Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., and his buddies are vicious, vengeful
creeps. And who needs some uptight, modern-day version of Cotton
Mather launching a federal investigation every time somebody the
religious right dislikes unzips his fly? And I hate those people so
much that I don't care what Clinton did as long as he didn't leave
a bleeding carcass in his wake.
</P>
<P>
   3. They're all hypocritical lowlifes. They're all chasing babes.
And my 401(k) is doing great. And, hey, there's an NBA game on, and
do we have enough chips and dip?
</P>
<P>
   Madness, all of it. Sure, senators are supposed to be immune to
such outbreaks of public insanity. They read the polls, though.
They see these attitudes enduring for a solid year, regardless of
the facts. And they say, ``OK, this is what the people want.''
</P>
<P>
   So just as there was really no quest for truth in the House
impeachment hearings, there's no quest for truth in the Senate
trial of the president. Nobody wants the facts firmly fixed in the
record on the Senate floor. The Senate is galloping away from this
thing like it's a lion and they're zebras.
</P>
<P>
   We, the people, will pay for it, too. Not right away, but those
chickens are circling up there, in search of a roost. Once you
permit anybody who takes the presidential oath to commit felonies _
serious crimes, high crimes by any reasonable definition _ and
remain in office, then you're setting the stage for disaster down
the road.
</P>
<P>
   First you dismiss perjury over a sexual encounter. Then you
dismiss it over something like a third-rate burglary. Then you
dismiss it over a well-intentioned lie to Congress over, say,
whether we really need 500,000 guys in uniform in some
inconsequential rathole like Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   If we reject the highest standards of conduct for the occupants
of the Oval Office, then we're just begging them to screw us
collectively instead of individually. And some of them will, too,
just wait.
</P>
<P>
   One of the tactics of the Clinton spin team _ the Chicago Bulls
of American politics, by the way _ has been to paint everybody who
wants him ousted as a right-wing loon. But I'm with distinctly
non-right-wing loons like Lowell Weicker, the former governor and
senator from Connecticut, and A.M. Rosenthal, the retired editor of
the New York Times. They both bemoan the public's determination to
keep a criminal in the White House, whatever his virtues and
however scary his enemies.
</P>
<P>
   To me, that has always been the issue _ not Clinton the man,
just Clinton the president. I never found him all that
objectionable politically or even personally, despite his
skirt-chasing. In fact, I've admired his immense gifts as a
politician and supported his stand on issues like the Family Leave
Act. I just want him bounced out for committing felonies, is all.
</P>
<P>
   But I know a good many bright, decent, thoughtful people who
think as you do, and I've convinced precisely none of them on this.
And, as Johnny Cochran might say, if you cannot convict, you cannot
evict. So, whatever happens down the road as a result of this won't
be my fault.
</P>
<P>
   It'll be yours.

TAKING THE BULL BY THE HORNS IN BRAZIL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD CHACON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO _ Like a king on his throne, Antonio de Oliveira
Bemvindo leaned back in a rickety metal chair in the hot, dimly lit
basement of a local government building and grinned over his good
fortune.
</P>
<P>
   The amiable, broad-shouldered electrician, called ``Bull''
around the halls of the local Legislature, knows that no matter how
bad the Brazilian economy gets, his job is guaranteed by law for
life. He makes roughly $2,100 a month, about three times more than
the average private sector wage.
</P>
<P>
   Bemvido only has to work 10 days a month. And if he stays on the
job for another 10 years he qualifies for six months vacation. ``We
make good money because the people upstairs make good money,''
Bemvindo, 48, said while pointing with his thumb to the
representatives' offices above him. ``And the reason they get money
is because this is a house of power.''
</P>
<P>
   His job represents the kind carefree public-sector spending that
Brazil's government has enjoyed for years. Now, however,
international lenders and investors are demanding that Brazil
sharply reduce its deficit, which has swollen to about 8 percent of
its gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
   ``(There) . . . is an attitude thatcomes from colonial times
that the state can do whatever it wants,'' said Geraldo Carbone,
president of BankBoston Brazil. ``But if this country is to be part
of the international community, we cannot have this kind of fiscal
deficit anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Brazilian leaders and representatives of the International
Monetary Fund hammered out a revised agreement this week for a
$41.5 billion aid package that among other things includes strict
targets to reduce government debt.
</P>
<P>
   Observers predict that unless Brazil sharply cuts these
expenses, its economy could slip back into the nightmarish days of
widespread unemployment and 2,000 percent annual inflation it saw
during the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Government facilities in Rio de Janeiro aren't plush, but they
are rife with inefficiencies and lessons in how the country's
public sector operates.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, Bemvido is a ``legislative assistant,'' a title
given to him 17 years ago when he started working as a lawmaker's
bodyguard. But he said he didn't like that job, so he was
transferred to the higher paying assignment in the basement, where
he's now responsible for making sure the building's air
conditioners work. His title was never changed.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the government paycheck isn't enough to raise three
children, Bemvido says, so he is allowed to supplement his income
by teaching classes in the Brazilian martial arts known as
capoeira.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Marcelo Fernando, a 27-year-old refrigeration
technician for a private company that is under contract to the
city, makes about $270 a month working next to Bemvido.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not bothered that Bull makes more,'' Fernando said, adding
that he occasionally joins Bemvido and other government workers for
a beer after work. ``But there are great salaries when you work for
a politician.''
</P>
<P>
   The average private sector salary is $200 to $250 a month,
whereas the largest portion of workers in the federal executive
branch _ about 26 percent _ received monthly wages of $470 to $550,
according to the federal administration agency. The government
employs about 5.5 million of Brazil's roughly 71 million workers,
the agency said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, local and state governments by law aren't supposed to
spend more than 60 percent of their budgets on salaries. But last
year 17 of Brazil's 27 states exceeded that limit, according to
federal figures.
</P>
<P>
   The state government in Rio de Janeiro, for example, spent 80
percent of its budget on personnel in 1998. All the state houses
combined owe loans to the federal government that come out to
roughly $500 for each of Brazil's 163 million citizens.
</P>
<P>
   During his reelection campaign last year, President Fernando
Henrique Cardoso promised several cost-cutting reforms. Some of
them have been grudgingly approved by Congress, such as a reduction
in pension benefits and a requirement for employee evaluations to
determine whether someone can be fired for poor performance.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the new law, Leile Moreira, a 36-year-old federal
Justice Department employee, will have an additional $300 deducted
from her pay. But she will still net $2,000 a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't mind making a sacrifice because I have so many friends
who don't even have a job,'' Moreira said while walking downtown
carrying a stack of legal papers. ``The problem is the government
often doesn't use the money for good things. I think things will
get worse before they get better.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as new reforms begin to take effect, some analysts believe
that government layoffs _ once an unthinkable idea in Brazil _ will
be unavoidable.
</P>
<P>
   But Nelson Mello e Souza, a former planning director for the
Organization of American States and now vice chancellor at the
private University Estacio de Sa in Rio de Janeiro, said that
cutting government spending too much could make things worse by
dramatically increasing unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Government is an easy target to pick,'' said Mello e Souza,
``but it could put people out on the street.''
</P>
<P>
   A more important strategy, the sociologist added, was the
Cardoso administration's decision last month to allow Brazil's
currency, the real, to float freely against the dollar. But that
policy has created a feeling of betrayal among many Brazilians that
their government, long a staunch defender of its currency, had
conceded defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government is making all these decisions about our money
and we can't even buy bread,'' said one woman in Rio de Janeiro who
identified herself only as a federal employee. ``It's not that
there's no money, it's that the money we have is poorly
administered. The whole system is to blame.''
</P>
<P>
   BankBoston's Carbone and others are optimistic that the country
can avoid an economic meltdown through a regimen of free-floating
currency exchange, increased exports and tighter government
accounting. Despite inflation predictions this year of betweeen 10
and 20 percent, there is even talk of new growth here within two
years.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Bemvindo, an avowed leftist, is not so cheerful.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have to worry about my job, but the others here do,''
Bemvindo said, as he wheeled his chair in front of a
floor-to-ceiling-high stack of idle air conditioners. ``This is not
a fair system. But Brazil is that way.''

CHUMMING UP TO GEORGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Empire State is a vast land but, it seems these
days, not big enough for Rudolph Giuliani and George Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor of New York City and the governor of the state: Both
are Republicans, both hold similar views on the major issues of the
day. But both also have ambitions for national office _ even for
the highest office in the land _ and they know New York can offer
up only one contender at a time.
</P>
<P>
   So, the biggest drama in New York politics now has little to do
with President Clinton's impeachment trial or with the tantalizing
rumors that his wife, Hillary Clinton, may consider a run for the
US Senate. Rather, it's the feud between Giuliani and Pataki _ and
the guns both are toting to the showdown are getting bigger by the
day.
</P>
<P>
   When Giuliani was in Albany last week, lobbying the state
Legislature for more money, he did not even meet with Pataki _ nor
did Pataki ask him to.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, one of Giuliani's agencies attacked Pataki's
appointee to the city's school-construction board, blaming him for
the death of a Brooklyn schoolgirl who was hit by a falling brick.
The appointee was forced to resign.
</P>
<P>
   Almost instantly, Pataki launched an official probe not only of
the board but of corruption throughout the city's school system,
invoking the Moreland Act, which gives state investigators the
power to subpoena witnesses and documents.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani erupted, and unleashed his schools chancellor, Rudy
Crews, to denounce Pataki publicly for using the city's
schoolchildren as a prop for his own presidential ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   And the list goes on: Shortly before this episode, Giuliani
announced plans to build a huge stadium on the West Side of
Manhattan, not for the New York Yankees, which, he now concedes,
will probably stay in the Bronx, but for the New York Jets, which
he hopes to lure back from New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   He did not inform Pataki ahead of time, even though the governor
would have to approve such a project.
</P>
<P>
   The two have also recently disagreed about plans and funding for
the Javits Convention Center, the Coliseum, the Holocaust Museum,
and a rail line to John F. Kennedy Airport.
</P>
<P>
   At bottom, many observers believe, Pataki and many other state
Republicans have never forgiven Giuliani for endorsing his
opponent, the Democratic incumbent, Mario Cuomo, in the 1994
governor's race.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, both men dismiss talk of a feud. Privately, though,
associates of both men acknowledge a mutual animosity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty clear to everyone around them that these two guys
can't stand each other,'' one business executive who deals with
both officials said, asking, like most people in such
circumstances, not to be identified.
</P>
<P>
   Both men also claim they are no great ambitions to higher
office, though they have been gallivanting around the country,
speaking at Republican fund-raisers, and forming their own
political action committees.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki told the New York Observer last year that he cannot help
but contemplate the White House. Giuliani, who must retire as mayor
in 2001 due to term-limit laws, has lately downplayed the idea of
running for president, but is known to have an eye on two other
possibilities: the US Senate seat that Democrat Daniel Patrick
Moynihan is vacating in 2000 (the same one Hillary boosters want
her to seek) _ or teaming up with Texas governor and likely
presidential candidate George W. Bush _ either as a running mate,
or as a possible future member of a Bush Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, son of former president George Bush, is widely seen as a
front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination. He and
Giuliani met at City Hall last year, and talked about national
politics. Bush has invited Giuliani to spend the night at his
governor's mansion on Feb. 11, when the mayor is scheduled to be in
Texas delivering a speech.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's camp believes having Giuliani on the ticket would
help Bush win New York. But statewide polls indicate that, while
many like him as mayor, few New Yorkers want to see Giuliani in the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   The same is true of Pataki. A survey released last week by the
Quinnipiac College Polling Institute showed 18 percent of New
Yorkers would be more likely to vote for a Republican presidential
candidate if Pataki were the running mate _ but 25 percent would be
less likely.
</P>
<P>
   Pollsters think Giuliani would have an easier shot at the Senate
seat, unless Hillary Clinton runs. The Quinnipiac poll suggests
Hillary Clinton would beat him, 51-42.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton has given no sign that she might _ or might not _
run. State Democratic chairwoman Judith Hope, who had previously
discounted the idea, said Wednesday she now sees a ``50-50'' chance
of her running after all. Hope spent time with Mrs. Clinton at a
fund-raiser here Tuesday night, though she declined to say whether
the two talked about the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Governor Bush, whose actions might also shape Giuliani's and
Pataki's fate, has not yet declared his intentions, either. So the
two New Yorkers sit and wait for the horizon to clear, and their
jockeying for position intensifies.

ABE LINCOLN: MAKING THE MOST OF THE LEAST

 &HT;    
 By HAL MALEHORN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    In the century and more since his death, Americans have come to
regard Abraham Lincoln arguably as our most beloved political
figure, and inarguably as one of our most effective presidents.
 &HT;    From the thousands of Lincoln books and articles penned by
scholars over the years one unifying theme has emerged: He made the
most of the least, and he turned the worst into his best. Indeed, a
lesser man would not have been so patient in the face of adversity,
nor so persistent in pursuing his goals.
 &HT;    There were dozens of circumstances that could have turned him
aside from his purposes, and thus cost him the admiration and
respect that he subsequently earned. Consider these:
 &HT;    He was born to poor parents who could neither read nor write. He
got his schooling a little at a time, which amounted to less than a
year of formal instruction all added up.
 &HT;    His younger brother died as an infant, his older sister died in
childbirth and his mother, Nancy Hanks, died when he was but 9.
 &HT;    The lad was raised by a stepmother who could scarcely scratch
out her own name. For a spell he and up to a dozen of his kin lived
together, crowded into a small, primitive cabin.
 &HT;    As he grew into manhood Abraham was never much to behold. He had
a spare frame and angular face. His hair was thick and coarse, and
it would hardly stay put. His nose was large and his ears stuck
out. His adult voice was thin and high-pitched, and it grated on
listeners' ears. At every age he towered over all.
 &HT;    As a boy and man, Lincoln survived several of life's perils. As
a child he nearly drowned in Knob Creek; as a teen he lay
unconscious a long time after being kicked in the head by a horse.
He was almost slain by brigands on his first flatboat trip to New
Orleans, and he was robbed at knifepoint in Louisville.
 &HT;    Socially, he was awkward in polite company, and his early
relationships were tentative and melancholic. Ann Rutledge, his
first close female friend, died suddenly of a fever. His initial
engagement to Mary Todd was canceled by mutual consent. He shortly
after proposed to Mary Owens, but she turned him down.
 &HT;    Lincoln's business ventures were similarly unspectacular. He
bought a New Salem store, and then a second enterprise, but both
went bust. It took him 20 years to pay off all he owed; he ruefully
called that obligation ``the national debt.''
 &HT;    Although he eventually earned a more than adequate cash income,
he never owned much real estate. From time to time he helped out
his folks in Coles County, Illinois, but his lazy stepbrother
frittered away most of the funds Lincoln sent.
 &HT;    Lincoln eventually married Mary Todd, who turned out to be much
more than a handful. She was jealous and resentful of other women,
she was rude to Lincoln's colleagues and she had a tart tongue for
tradespeople. Mary squandered much of her husband's modest earnings
on extravagant furnishings and clothing.
 &HT;    By his own admission, Lincoln was not much of a disciplinarian
to his four growing sons. Mary ran the household, and the offspring
pretty much ran themselves. Sadly, two of the children died young,
sending Mary into unending grief.
 &HT;    Lincoln's political career took many disappointing turns among
its few key successes. He was defeated for the Illinois Assembly
his very first try, defeated twice for speaker of that house later
on, defeated for presidential elector, defeated for Congress and
defeated in a vice presidential bid.
 &HT;    And, because in 1858 U.S. senators were chosen by the various
state legislatures, Lincoln lost that year's Senate race to Stephen
A. Douglas, even though Lincoln had polled more popular votes.
 &HT;    Finally elected to the White House by only a plurality among
four strong national candidates, Lincoln presided during this
country's most perilous and tragic period. He became one of the
most reviled figures in American history at the time, among both
his own and the opposing political parties.
 &HT;    During the four-year Civil War that began six weeks after he
took office, he was frequently at odds with his own cabinet. And
his generals on the battlefield were all too often either
incompetent or reluctant to fight the enemy.
 &HT;    Seven members of Mary Todd's own Kentucky clan fought for the
Confederacy. Mary herself during the war was investigated by a
congressional committee for possible treasonable activities.
Lincoln had to personally assure the members of Congress of her
abiding loyalty to the Union.
 &HT;    By the day Lincoln was assassinated he had received dozens of
death threats. Sadly, the Union he had helped preserve could not
protect its chief.
 &HT;    Many years after Lincoln had died, poet Rosemary Benet mused,
``If Nancy Hanks came back as a ghost/Seeking news of what she
loved most/She'd ask first, ``Where's my son?/What happened to Abe?
What's he done?''
 &HT;    Americans past and present could proudly answer that inquiring
ghost by slightly paraphrasing the rest of that poem: ``Yes, Nancy
Hanks, we knew your son/He did grow tall, he did have fun./He
learned to read. He got to town. We knew his name./In spite of it
all, he did get on.''

AIRLINES FACE RISING FRUSTRATIONS FROM PASSENGERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAVID ARMSTRONG  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Trapped on the tarmac. Dazed by delays. Slapped
silly with surcharges. Constrained by carry-on rules. Starved for
snacks, even in first-class. Flummoxed by fare increases.
</P>
<P>
   Such are the travails of airline passengers. A potent mix of
problems has emerged to frustrate fliers both well-known, like San
Francisco Mayor Willie Brown _ who vented recently at United
Airlines for delays and carry-on luggage rules at San Francisco
International Airport _ and unknown, like the millions crammed into
Lilliputian coach seats. This is the winter of our discontent.
</P>
<P>
   The airlines are frustrated, too. Although most are awash with
profits, the money, airline officials say, is earmarked for new
aircraft, high-tech landing gear, sleek airport lounges and roomier
seats.
</P>
<P>
   Executives say the public doesn't understand how hard they are
working to make the pain go away, and are overlooking the
industry's consumer-friendly innovations of recent years such as
expansive frequent-flier programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're handling lots of people, buying lots of planes. It's all
leading to something. There's an eventual benefit to the
consumer,'' said Jack Evans, the manager of corporate
communications for Alaska Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, there's turbulence ahead for the major U.S.
carriers, which boarded 615 million passengers on packed planes
last year. Vexing consumers the most are rising fares, flight
delays, vanishing food and carry-on policies.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 28, the major U.S. airlines _ including United,
American, Delta, U.S. Airways, Continental, TWA, Alaska, America
West, Southwest and Northwest _ raised fares 4 percent in domestic
economy and 2 percent for domestic business class.
</P>
<P>
   The industry has tried more than a dozen times to raise prices
since the fall of 1997, the last successful fare increase, but was
always thwarted by Northwest, which wouldn't support it. This time,
Northwest _ recovering from a strike by pilots _ went along.
</P>
<P>
   According to analysts such as Atlanta-based author Christopher
McGinniss, the airlines are raising fares because demand is high.
</P>
<P>
   McGinniss, author of ``The Unofficial Business Traveler's Pocket
Guide,'' observes that the airlines can have their way right now
because ``The planes are so full, and there's no competition except
on a few routes.''
</P>
<P>
   McGinniss said the hub system that allows a single major airline
to dominate a given airport has helped weaken competition.
</P>
<P>
   According to American Express consultant Bob Harrell, business
fares, which produce 45 percent of airline revenue, ``are at
historic high levels since we began tracking them in 1992.''
Harrell said business-class fares had risen 44 percent since early
1996, driven by airline confidence that the consumer will pay and
robust business.
</P>
<P>
   David Fuscus, a spokesman for the Air Transport Association, the
major lobbying arm of the major airlines, counters that leisure and
business fares have declined an average of 36 percent since the
industry was deregulated in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, airline profits were $5.1 billion in 1998, off just
slightly from a record $5.2 billion in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines say that these prosperous times follow the lean early
'90s, when high fuel costs, a recessionary economy and the Persian
Gulf War instilled a fear of flying, especially among leisure
travelers. Some airlines lost hundreds of millions of dollars; this
is an attempt to recoup those losses and build stability.
</P>
<P>
   Recent weather-related delays at such busy airports as San
Francisco International and Detroit have created a backlash.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 2-3, a powerful winter storm brought airport operations
to a deal halt in Detroit. Some Northwest passengers were stranded
in planes on the tarmac for up to 8 hours in a snowstorm without
adequate food, water or working toilets, according to news reports.
</P>
<P>
   ``The weather knocked us out, along with the rest of the
community, and severely affected the airport,'' said Northwest
spokesman Jon Austin. To make amends, Austin said Northwest ``sent
personal letters of apology and coupons for a free trip'' to
affected travelers.
</P>
<P>
   The Detroit incident mobilized organizations such as the
American Society of Travel Agents, which has proposed a ``bill of
rights'' for passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, airlines such as United have declared war on
oversized carry-on bags, especially of the wildly popular wheeled
variety. Airline officials say they jam overhead bins, slow
boarding and deplaning and fray tempers as gate agents increasingly
demand that bags be checked.
</P>
<P>
   Because there is no size standard for the 10 major U.S.
airlines, fuming fliers find that a bag that is perfectly
acceptable to one airline has to be lugged back to the ticket
counter and checked in at the behest of another.
</P>
<P>
   To ease the confusion, the Association of Flight Attendants,
which represents 43,000 of the nation's 110,000 attendants, asked
the Federal Aviation Administration in December to impose a uniform
standard. Union spokeswoman Cynthia Kain said the AFA supports
restrictions because full overhead bins can cause injuries and
delays.
</P>
<P>
   Kain acknowledged that an AFA plea to the airlines to
voluntarily come up with a standard just hasn't flown. Indeed, some
airlines _ notably Continental _ are honing a competitive edge by
being more permissive than rivals. Of Continental, she said: ``We
call it the carry-it-all-on airline.''
</P>
<P>
   Continental's director of public relations, David Messing, said
more-relaxed rules are more people-friendly, adding that
Continental is enlarging overhead bins and ``taking a lot of new
aircraft deliveries with larger bins.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's a flight with a light load factor, not an eyebrow will
be raised'' at big, bulging carry-ons, Messing said. If the plane
is full, the policy tightens up.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another gripe is the quality of airline food. While celebrity
chefs fuss over meals for first-class passengers, others forage for
nuts and soda in the cheap seats. Now, on some Delta flights, even
high-paying first-class passengers have to tighten their belts.
</P>
<P>
   Delta has downgraded full meals to snacks in first-class on 80
short flights and snacks to beverages on another 160 flights. The
cutbacks, Delta spokeswoman Katie Moussouri said, will save $14
million a year. Delta reported profits of $1 billion in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Such stress points have resonated with consumers, travel
industry organizations and politicians, who are proposing a wide
range of actions. Proposed remedies include voluntary endorsement
by the airlines of a bill of rights, more federal regulatory
oversight and court-ordered airline policy changes.
</P>
<P>
   The American Society of Travel Agents has asked Secretary of
Transportation Rodney Slater to call a national conference to
``restore public confidence in the air transportation system'' and
``examine deteriorating levels of customer service.''
</P>
<P>
   The organization _ which claims 26,500 members _ is already at
war with the airlines, charging that global alliances that allow
carriers to code-share, link frequent flier programs and share
airport lounges may violate antitrust laws. As it is, the
Department of Justice is suing to challenge Northwest's $465
million acquisition of a stake in Continental.
</P>
<P>
   If that wasn't enough, last week two U.S. senators announced
plans to introduce legislation for more oversight of the airline
industry, which was deregulated in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation by Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., and Sen. John McCain,
R-Ariz., would give passengers 48 hours to cancel nonrefundable
tickets. The bill also would require airlines to explain why
flights are delayed and tell frequent fliers how many seats are
available if they want to cash in their miles.

OLYMPIC SCRUTINY NOW FOCUSES ON ATLANTA'S AGGRESSIVE EFFORTS 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS  
 (a and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MITCHELL ZUCKOFF AND JOHN POWERS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A shiver of surprise coursed through the ballroom of
Tokyo's New Prince Takinawa Hotel when International Olympic
Committee president Juan Antonio Samaranch announced that Atlanta
had won its long-shot bid to host the 1996 Summer Games.
</P>
<P>
   Whispers of influence peddling lingered for years after that
September 1990 IOC vote. Now, in the wake of revelations of payoffs
in Salt Lake City, surrounding the Utah capital's selection as the
site of the 2002 Winter Games, the questions have turned to
suspicions, and Atlanta has found its Olympic memories under
scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Hodler, the Swiss IOC official who set off the Salt Lake
scandal, triggered the inquiry when he suggested that Atlanta also
engaged in bribes and vote-buying. In December, when asked if he
thought Atlanta was clean, Hodler said, ``Certainly not.'' He said
it was hard to believe ``Atlanta could have been facing this
blackmail'' and won the Games without ``doing something.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, no specific evidence of wrongdoing has surfaced, and
Atlanta Olympic organizers spent the past week combing through
4,000 boxes of documentary history of the 1996 Games to prepare a
response to an IOC inquiry letter. That response will firmly
maintain they violated no laws or Olympic rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``No bribes, no scholarships, direct or indirect. No, sir,
absolutely none,'' Billy Payne Jr., the chief organizer and
visionary behind Atlanta's Olympic bid, said in an interview. Not
only were no offers made, Payne said, no payoffs or inappropriate
gifts were sought by IOC members or middlemen.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Olympic organizers here have refused to expedite the release
of the documents that reveal in excruciating detail the nearly
10-year effort to land and stage the 1996 Games. Payne said the
documents will be made public only after a lengthy archiving
process, though he would release some sooner if needed to refute
specific allegations.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta organizers, however, have acknowledged lavish
gift-giving and pampering that raised Southern hospitality to new
heights. It was an effort that cost $7.8 million, plus millions
more in donated services, raised largely from local corporations,
philanthropies, and wealthy individuals. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Symptomatic excess? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some critics say Atlanta's effort to land the 1996 Games
demonstrated the climate of excess within the entire Olympic
movement, paving the way for corruption in Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ethics here are fuzzy, and no one in Atlanta dares to get
righteous,'' Steve Hummer, a columnist with The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, wrote last month. ``There is no innocence,
only varying degrees of guilt in these crimes of influence.''
</P>
<P>
   Those criticisms got an added lift last week when Tom Welch, the
former president of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee, claimed
that former Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young was among those aware of the
cash and scholarships allegedly exchanged for votes from certain
IOC members.
</P>
<P>
   Young, who acted as an unpaid advisor to the Utah committee,
said in an interview he was aware of the program, but did not know
to whom the scholarships were given. Young also lashed out at the
media.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems naive or racist that the American press, and the
world press, should have put so much focus on humanitarian
assistance to poor people and label that as corruption, and not say
a word about the influence of $5 billion or $6 billion television
contracts, or the hundred-million-dollar marketing contracts,''
Young said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's be real _ the influence in the Olympic movement is not
in the hands of a few poor Africans or Asians or Latins,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Atlanta has made no secret of its aggressive
attempts from 1987 onward to influence IOC members, using
enticements large and small as a way to cement ``friendships'' that
would pay off in the form of a winning bid at the IOC's September
1990 site-selection meeting in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   ``You try to build the best relationship you can, to win these
people's trust and confidence,'' said Charlie Battle Jr., a lawyer
who was the Atlanta bid committee's chief international emissary.
``We did what we thought was appropriate and accepted and
recognized as the thing to do to put your best foot forward, within
the parameters of the regulations as we understood them.''
</P>
<P>
   There were the obligatory first-class airplane tickets,
exquisite meals, and rooms at the Marriott Marquis hotel; silver
mint julep cups; Cabbage Patch dolls; homespun touches like Claxton
fruitcakes and Vidalia onion relishes; limited-edition quilts and
embroidered ``Georgia on my mind'' pillow cases; video copies of
``Gone With The Wind''; visits by private jet to Savannah; and
yacht rides aboard The Highlander, owned by the family of Malcolm
Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   There also were personalized gifts _ chosen with help from
individual dossiers compiled on each IOC member. They included a
print of a building at Amherst College for Prince Albert of Monaco,
an alumnus; a carved walking stick for an IOC delegate from San
Juan who walked with a cane; a meeting with famed architect John
Portman for a Mexican IOC member in the same profession; symphony
tickets for music lovers and outings to the exclusive Augusta
National Golf Club for golf enthusiasts; and a bulldog for a Cuban
IOC delegate who grew enamored of the University of Georgia mascot.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta organizers also helped pick up the tab when David
Sibandze, an IOC member from Swaziland, spent four days at Piedmont
Hospital after collapsing with a heart ailment. Sibandze resigned
from the IOC last month when it was revealed his son received
scholarships and a job through the SLOC. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `They didn't break any rules' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Still, Atlanta organizers insist they were far less excessive
than other bid cities, which in some cases spent twice as much.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing in our past that would dampen our fond and
wonderful memories. It is only a question of when are we finally
believed,'' said Ginger Watkins, an original bid committee member
who oversaw all IOC delegates' visits to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Though rival candidate cities found it suspicious that a
first-time bidder could defeat favored Athens and four other cities
for the coveted Centennial Games, none has accused Atlanta of
providing Salt Lake-style payoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They ran a very bold and brassy and slick campaign _ all the
things we did not want to be,'' said Norman Seagram, who was
financial chairman of the Toronto bid committee. ``But they didn't
break any rules.''

<P>
   D.M., Dedham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Tony McClary, manager of safety and training for Hudson
General, a major de-icing contractor at Logan International
Airport, has de-iced thousands of planes, and says with no small
amount of pride that it's a complicated procedure that involves a
lot more than squirting hot water on a plane so its surfaces will
be smooth and perform the way they're supposed to.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he says, de-icing is only one step. Step two is
anti-icing, to keep the frozen stuff from building back up as the
plane sits in the snow/sleet/freezing rain, waiting to take off.
Both steps use fluids that contain glycols, chemicals that have a
lower freezing point than water.
</P>
<P>
   De-icers use either ethylene glycol or propylene glycol in a
50-50 mix with water, heated to 180 degrees Fahrenheit and sprayed
onto the plane. The heat and powerful spray do some of the de-icing
work. But the key are those glycols, which lower the freezing point
of moisture on the plane's surface to as low as 60 degrees below
zero.
</P>
<P>
   After spraying the de-icing fluid on the plane, the ``holdover
time'' during which the plane stays clean is only 6 to 15 minutes,
depending on weather conditions. So sometimes they do a second
step, called anti-icing, in which they spray the plane with a mix
of glycol and non-Newtonian fluids. That's just a fancy name for
fluids too thick to run by themselves, like ketchup or honey.
</P>
<P>
   The thicker fluid stays on the plane longer and lets the glycols
keep things from refreezing while the plane is waiting. Holdover
time after a step two anti-ice treatment is as much as an hour and
twenty minutes, depending on the specific fluid used and the
weather conditions. Usually they only spray the thicker stuff on
the critical control surfaces of the plane, the wings, and the
tail.
</P>
<P>
   Non-Newtonian fluids designed for anti-icing are not really like
ketchup or honey. ``They have the unique ability to change
viscosity when confronted with aerodynamic forces acting on the
fluid,'' McClary says. That's a fancy way of saying that when the
plane speeds up as it takes off, the force of the wind on the fluid
makes it get thinner, making it more like water than honey, and it
drips right off the plane. By the time the plane exceeds 156 miles
per hour, the fluid is gone, the plane's surface is clean, and
takeoff (at 180 miles per hour for your average jetliner) is safe.
</P>
<P>
   Step One fluids are pinkish. The Step Two fluids are greenish.
Both consume oxygen when they get into aquatic ecosystems. Both
biodegrade quickly. In five days they're 70 percent gone. After 20
days they're 96 percent broken down.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Why is water in the gas tank a problem particularly in
winter, and how does adding moisture (dry gas) to two liquids (gas
and water) remove moisture from the tank?
</P>
<P>
   M.P., Brookline, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. David Williams, a chemist with the Coastal Unilube Company,
says you've usually got water in your gas tank and your gas lines.
Small amounts aren't a problem most of the time. But in the winter,
water can condense and freeze up in your gas line. Then you've got
a problem.
</P>
<P>
   The water comes from humidity condensing into liquid, either in
your car's fuel system or in the underground tanks at the gas
station.
</P>
<P>
   Water is heavier than gasoline and normally settles to the
bottom of the filling station's underground tanks. But when the
tanks are refilled, the water is stirred up. The more recently your
filling station has been resupplied, the more water you'll be
getting in the gas you buy.
</P>
<P>
   Once it's in your car, water settles to the bottom of your gas
tank, too, but driving around mixes everything up. Small amounts
vaporize out into the fuel lines, and in the winter that condensate
can freeze.
</P>
<P>
   Now, how does a liquid added to two liquids remove a liquid? It
doesn't. Williams says so-called dry gas-type products are
alcohols, usually isopropyl alcohol or methanol. (The molecular
composition of isopropynol, made up of carbon, oxygen and hydrogen,
is set up in such a way that one end bonds with the carbon and
hydrogen in gasoline, and the other end bonds with the hydrogen and
oxygen in water. You end up with one long chain. . .the gasoline on
one end, the water on the other, and the alcohol in the middle
holding them together. The methanol doesn't bond with the water,
but it reduces its surface tension so it stays suspended in the
gasoline, kind of like little globs of oil in vinegar after you
shake up salad dressing.
</P>
<P>
   Then, when the fuel pump draws gasoline to the engine, it draws
the water along with it, where everything gets burned up.

 ANAHEIM, Calif.: ... such things.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sir Martin Rees, professor at Cambridge University and author of
``Before the Beginning,'' explained that ``if there were many
universes, each triggered by a separate `big bang' or `genesis
event,' then we would naturally find ourselves in one of the
special subset that permitted complex evolution. There would be
nothing coincidental or providential about the apparent `fine
tuning' on which life depends.''
</P>
<P>
   The case for that explanation may become clear as data flows in
from new satellites designed to study the traces of the earliest
remnants of the newborn universe, and from atom-smashers probing
the properties of matter under conditions that have not existed
since the instants after the universe's birth.
</P>
<P>
   Just with the information already available, the picture keeps
getting more exotic. In the early decades of this century, the
debate was whether the universe was eternal and unchanging (the
Steady State theory) or was all created at a specific momentin a
huge cosmic fireball. This view came to be known by a label coined
by its critics to ridicule the idea: the Big Bang.
</P>
<P>
   When, in the early 1960s, a kind of cosmic radio static was
discovered radiating from all directions in the sky _ considered a
relic of the heat of that cosmic explosion _ that seemed to seal
the case in favor of the Big Bang. Additional evidence since then
has only strengthened that view _ although a handful of scientists
continue to hold out for the steady state.
</P>
<P>
   There are some problems in the prevailing view, though. The
standard Big Bang cannot explain why the bang wasn't completely
smooth and uniform in all directions. If it had been, all of the
particles of matter would simply have continued to hurl apart, and
even whole atoms _ not to mention larger objects like stars and
planets _ could never have formed. How to resolve the paradox?
</P>
<P>
   That led to the idea of cosmic inflation, which several
scientists, including Alan Guth of the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, began to develop in the 1970s and early 1980s. This
idea held that instead of a steady expansion, the universe went
through a sudden, much-faster explosive period just after its
birth, and it seemed to solve the problem, and became the most
widely-accepted cosmological theory.
</P>
<P>
   From the start, however, there were some problems. For one
thing, nobody could explain why this ``inflationary'' period of
rapid growth stopped, leaving the steady expansion of the universe
astronomers observe today. In addition, the theory predicted a
universe much ``lumpier'' than it really is.
</P>
<P>
   Linde's version, by contrast, includes ``eternal inflation,''
which gets around the problem of the abrupt end of inflation
predicted by Guth's theory. In Linde's scenario, instead of an
abrupt end, the inflation just gradually slowed down. And his
theory predicts exactly the amount of lumpiness _ the variations in
the cosmic background radiation that echoes the state of the
universe soon after the Big Bang _ observed by satellites.
</P>
<P>
   These observations don't prove the theory is right, Linde says,
but no other theory at present can account for the observations
made by satellites such as the Cosmic Background Explorer, or COBE.
Its observations could easily have disproved all versions of
inflationary theory; the fact that they didn't is an encouraging
sign that the theory may be on the right track.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the findings reported last year that seem to show
that the universe will continue to expand forever _ that the
universe is ``open'' _ cannot be explained by any cosmology other
than some versions of this inflationary theory.
</P>
<P>
   The scale of that initial burst of inflation is almost
impossible to grasp. According to Linde's calculations, in a period
of time that was literally shorter than the blink of an eye, a
microscopic speck of space itself expanded to become larger than
the visible universe.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the part of the universe that we inhabit has settled down
to a steady expansion in which galaxies, stars, planets and people
can exist. But somewhere out there in space, at this moment, the
energy of a region of space may be building up again to the level
needed to spawn another Big Bang. And from that region, another
universe _ maybe similar to ours, maybe one with completely
different basic characteristics _ will burst into existence . . .
and immediately lose contact forever with our universe.
</P>
<P>
   But through one of the trickier implications of relativistic
space, even though the new universe expands exponentially to
tremendous size, it continues to occupy only a tiny point in space
from our perspective _ and therefore can pose no danger to its
``parent'' universe. It's a bit like the time machine in the old
``Dr. Who'' television series, which was tiny outside but huge on
the inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this way,'' Linde says, ``the universe reproduces itself.''
One question this theory does not answer, however, is whether there
was one original Big Bang, with nothing before it, or whether the
process has been going on forever. Either is possible, according to
this view.
</P>
<P>
   Even though it is impossible to detect or communicate with the
new baby universes that arise, Linde says, their existence may give
some comfort for those who worry about the really, really long view
of things: ``Our part of the universe has been created, but other
parts of the universe are still being created. If life in our part
of the universe were to disappear, then it will appear again
someplace else. So the universe as a whole becomes immortal.''

 ATLANTA: ...any rules.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``We did it the Canadian way and they did it the American way,''
said Paul Henderson, who headed the Toronto committee. ``They set
the standard. But I can't nail Atlanta. They put on a full-court
press and they won. Our position is that we shot ourselves in the
foot. To point fingers or blame something that happened on somebody
else is not our style.''
</P>
<P>
   Mahmoud El Farnawani, an Ontario businessman who was a paid
consultant and lobbyist for cities bidding for the last four
Olympics awarded, told the Toronto Star in 1998 that Atlanta used a
``special way'' to land the 1996 Games. ``This cannot be told
because it would be very damaging,'' El Farnawani said, ``but
everyone around the world knew what was happening.''
</P>
<P>
   El Farnawani, who was paid $160,000 by the Salt Lake committee
to influence IOC members from northern Africa, would not comment on
the Atlanta bid last week, saying the ongoing IOC scandal had left
him ``physically and emotionally drained.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever he heard or saw, it's all innuendo, etc.,'' said
David Goodman, El Farnawani's attorney. ``And I don't think it's in
his interest to comment about it.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Young's `African strategy' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the avalanche of souvenirs, free travel, hotel stays and
five-star meals, there were the unique efforts of Young, the former
UN ambassador and civil rights leader who was Atlanta's mayor from
1981-89. Young developed what might be called an ``African
strategy,'' parlaying his longstanding personal ties there into
votes for his city.
</P>
<P>
   In meetings with each African and Caribbean IOC member, roughly
20 in all at the time, Young stressed that two-thirds of Atlanta
residents were black, making it the only ``African'' city bidding
for the Games that year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Olympics has been transformed from a $700 million deficit
event in 1976 to a $5 billion asset in 1996. I think some poor
Africans ought to have some influence in the way that money is
spent,'' said Young, who is now chairman of Good Works
International, which seeks to create business links between
developed and under-developed countries.
</P>
<P>
   One month before the September 1990 vote, Young went to visit
Jean-Claude Ganga of The Republic of Congo _ one of the IOC members
now facing expulsion over the Salt Lake scandal _ bearing gifts of
soccer balls, basketballs, and athletic clothing. Ganga, among the
most influential African IOC members, switched his support from
Toronto to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Young also organized a training camp for African athletes _ just
as he had done before the 1984 Summer Games in Los Angeles _ at
LaGrange College about an hour southwest of downtown Atlanta. The
camp opened in 1991, after Atlanta had been awarded the 1996 Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our generosity was an attempt to counteract the perception
that the Americans were only interested in the Olympics because it
was big money,'' Young said. ``Everybody who is bidding ought to be
called on to help countries that are less fortunate, and that's
what the Olympic movement stands for.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, an Australian Olympic official has accused
Young of directing US government aid to African nations during the
1996 bid process, but the official, John Coates, has offered no
evidence and named no countries. Young denied the allegation, but
said he would have supported such aid.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's winning bid also gave rise to lingering questions
about the role played by corporate sponsors, including Delta
Airlines, NationsBank, Bell South, Georgia Power, and Home Depot,
among others. Some provided in-kind contributions, such as Delta
airline seats, that Atlanta Olympic officials said were not
included in their $7.8 million spending total.
</P>
<P>
   But the most attention has focused on the role played by
Atlanta-based Coca-Cola, one of the Olympics' oldest and biggest
sponsors, in the surprise defeat of Athens, the sentimental
favorite to host the centennial Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta was considered a long shot because the Summer Games had
been held on United States soil just 12 years earlier, because it
was a first-time bidder, and because Atlanta was associated in the
minds of some IOC members with Ted Turner, the mogul who launched
the Goodwill Games as a competitor to the Olympics, and Jimmy
Carter, who as president ordered the US boycott of the 1980 Summer
Games in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola's local bottler contributed about $300,000 to
Atlanta's bid effort _ in addition to $250 million spent by the
corporation during 1996 on Olympic-related promotions, including
the torch relay. But the parent corporation has a strict policy
against favoring one city over another in Olympic bidding, and
local Coca-Cola bottlers contributed to at least three other cities
that sought the 1996 Games, said Ben Deutsch, spokesman for
worldwide sports at Coca-Cola.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsch said that although Coca-Cola was proud to have the
Olympics in its hometown, the company gained little from its
presence. ``The real opportunity for us as a business is in the 134
other countries where we did marketing promotions in 1996 in terms
of the Olympics,'' Deutsch said. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Olympics still a presence &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Two-and-a-half years after the closing ceremonies of the 1996
Olympics, the Games are still an ever-present memory here. Visitors
are greeted at the airport with a sign welcoming them to Atlanta,
``Home of the Centennial 1996 Olympics.'' Five-ring Olympic flags
still fly, and every day at noon, Centennial Olympic Park downtown
_ scene of the bombing that cast a shadow on the Games _ comes
alive with dancing fountains and blaring music, from the Olympic
theme to Neil Diamond singing ``Coming to America.''
</P>
<P>
   But with the controversy swirling from Salt Lake to IOC
headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland, some local memories have
become tarnished.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Atlanta did a great job getting the Olympics, and they
leveraged it into great benefits for me as an Atlanta resident in
terms of the infrastructure and the venues left behind,'' said
architect Eric Brock, spending his lunch hour at the park last
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm completely jaded in terms of the whole Olympic
organization,'' he added, ``how it operates, how votes get sold,
all of that, and it's embarrassing to think Atlanta had to play by
those rules to get it.''

THEY COULDN'T FIND THE FACTS

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; WASHINGTON _ As plug-pullings go, it has to be the fastest on
record.
</P>
<P>
   What finally set the Senate on a course to tell the House of
Representatives _ as politely as humanly possible _ that its
impeachment case does not deserve to succeed, was not its lopsided
vote to spare Monica Lewinsky the torture of live testimony for no
probitive purpose.
</P>
<P>
   It was a more private judgment _ leadership guided but
membership supported _ to stop an almost comically ill-advised
effort to turn the Senate into the House.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday morning, the impeachment body still twitched; two
hours later it was dead.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, the ``findings of fact'' _ the last gasp of
pure partisanship in a proceeding that cooler heads in the Senate
kept from becoming a full-fledged trial _ were not that at all.
</P>
<P>
   The best that seven designated Republican finders could find
were argumentative conclusions, essentially that President Clinton
was indeed responsible for the conduct alleged in the two
impeachment articles that can now be swept into history's dustbin;
the G word (guilty), the P word (perjury), and the O word
(obstruction) were avoided, but saying that the president
``willfuly'' testified falsely and ``wrongfully,'' and tried to
disrupt lawful court proceedings is a distinction without a
difference.
</P>
<P>
   As such, the seven turned off the only Democratic senator who
had even expressed interest in the idea, Connecticut's Joseph
Lieberman; and they halted any chance of the idea spreading to
others.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, as Democrats from Minority Leader Tom Daschle on down
made clear, they could have been the basis for filibuster by
amendment _ like adding a ``finding'' that Ken Starr's mother wears
combat boots, or that Lucianne Goldberg and Linda Tripp are poor
role models for 21st century women.
</P>
<P>
   But behind all that was the most important fact of all, that
there were as many as 14 Republican senators fully prepared to
oppose findings of anything.
</P>
<P>
   For those counting, that is slightly more than 25 percent of the
GOP membership, meaning that the so-called findings, no matter
their shape or form, never had as much as a prayer of passage.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition, to a person, was principled. A few senators _
Phil Gramm of Texas and Bob Smith of New Hampshire, for example _
tend to oppose anything not specified, or enumerated, in the
Constitution. And the rest _ including moderately conservative
types like Mike DeWine of Ohio, Gordon Smith of Oregon, and Richard
Shelby of Alabama _ opposed any fudging of the explicit
constitutional obligation of the Senate to convict or not convict.
</P>
<P>
   But the evening before the Republicans met, a final straw was
added to the camel's back in the form of a CBS News poll that found
the public viewing the Senate with the same distaste with which it
had viewed the House back in December _ as a den of squabbling,
posturing partisans unable to work together.
</P>
<P>
   The members were already convinced, but the poll hit the big
shots where they live, especially Majority Follower Trent Lott.
</P>
<P>
   An hour before the Senate convened to vote down the subpoena for
Lewinsky (splitting the GOP caucus almost in half), Lott yanked the
plug on the fact-finders, claiming, ``I have felt all along that
really what we ought to do is do what the Constitution and the
rules provide _ go through the impeachment trial, get to the
articles of impeachment, vote on those, and then move on.''
</P>
<P>
   In a pig's eye.
</P>
<P>
   It was Lott himself who had encouraged the original fact-finder,
Senator Susan Collins of Maine, back in December; and it was Lott
two weeks ago who named two other senators to run a seven-person
GOP operation to come up with a draft.
</P>
<P>
   Collins, in particular, was left holding the bag, though she was
hardly in a position to complain.
</P>
<P>
   Coming into the Senate proceedings, she had strongly supported
the calling of witnesses to the floor as the only way information
that could inform a vote could be presented, and she was pushing a
separate procedure to find ``facts'' because of her theory that an
acquittal under the Constitution might send the wrong ``message.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the end she voted against hearing the only requested
witness, and yet she helped draft two findings of ``fact'' claiming
that the president did what he was accused of doing.
</P>
<P>
   The composite of Collins's positions was that she looked like a
pretzel.
</P>
<P>
   The demise of her idea, however, like the demise of live
witnesses, was but a metaphor for the end of impeachment itself.
</P>
<P>
   The trial will limp on to its anticlimactic conclusion this
week, but the real end came Thursday with a genuine jolt.

<P>
   BOSTON _ Heather Urquhart's mornings start early, with the 7
a.m. feeding of a baby penguin who consumes as much pureed herring
and shrimp daily as, say, a 150-pound man would if he ate 90 pounds
of food. Urquhart is senior aquarist at the New England Aquarium,
and the chick is the smallest of the 61 penguins in her charge.
</P>
<P>
   Usually little DY2xPE/98-17/3B _ hatched Jan. 14, gender and
name as yet undetermined _ would be cared for by his (or her)
parents in the aquarium's ground-floor penguin area, where the baby
would be kept warm in the nest and fed regurgitated fish from mom
and dad's own beaks. But the exhibit is under renovation, and all
the other penguins are crowded into temporary quarters.
</P>
<P>
   So Urquhart is hand-raising the African penguin chick in a
heated tank in her office. It's one way her job's changed since
construction of an expanded penguin area began a month ago. With
the exhibit's expected reopening next Saturday, the colony of 40
African penguins (DY2xPE, No. 41, will still be in its tank) and 14
rockhoppers will be joined by six little blue penguins from
Australia, the smallest of the world's 17 penguin species.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since Urquhart, 35, was a girl growing up in Bellingham,
watching Jacques Cousteau on television and snorkeling in Cape
Cod's Waquoit Bay, she dreamed of a career tending marine animals.
She volunteered with the aquarium's penguins when she was a student
at Salem (Mass.) State College, and was hired in 1988 to dive in
the giant ocean tank as well as work with the tuxedoed birds.
Gradually managing the growing penguin colony became her a fulltime
job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being involved with an animal from the day it's born until it
grows and finds a mate and has offspring of its own is a pretty
wonderful experience,'' she says. ``These are like my surrogate
children, I guess. They're kind of like a family.''
</P>
<P>
   On this morning, DY2xPE weighs 134 grams (4.7 oz.), up from a
birth weight of 53 grams (1.9 oz.). The downy gray chick is so
small it fits in the palm of Urquhart's freshly washed hand.
</P>
<P>
   With a syringe in one hand and two fingers of the other forming
a snug ``V'' around the chick's beak to mimic the parental beak,
Urquhart squirts in 13.4 grams of warm mush. She thinks it's a jinx
to name a chick before the 40th day.
</P>
<P>
   The next stop is the holding area, which Urquhart enters after
dipping the soles of her shoes in two trays of disinfectant. As she
hoses down the rubber drydock on the floor, she notices clumps of
regurgitated food in the rockhoppers' corner, which she removes.
She notes the unusual activity in the log because this bears
watching.
</P>
<P>
   Manual labor is as much part of Urquhart's job as the
stimulation of hand-raising chicks and traveling Each year she goes
to South Africa to work with penguin researchers, and she went to
Australia in 1997 to pick up the little blues and to learn to care
for them. each year to South Africa to work with penguin
researchers and going to Australia to pick up the little blues and
learn to care for them. ``People think what we do is glamorous,''
Urquhart says, ``but when you're taking care of animals, 85 percent
of it is cleaning.''
</P>
<P>
   The holding area is a cacophony of African (a.k.a. jackass)
penguins braying, rockhoppers honking, and little blues trilling.
The center is chilly, with 34 African penguins in metal cages _
``They're burrowing animals, so they're pretty comfortable,''
Urquhart says _ and the rest of the birds on the floor. The little
blues, who've been here since 1997 getting acclimated and awaiting
their own fiberglass island in the exhibit, have cat litter boxes
fashioned into makeshift burrows. The rockhoppers' corner is
furnished with steps and overturned milk and bread crates
reminiscent of the rocks on which these orange-crested penguins
like to hop.
</P>
<P>
   All the birds have names, mostly educational appellations such
as Gur-Roo-Mul, which is an aboriginal word for penguin, or Beach
Donkey, which is a nickname for African penguins.
</P>
<P>
   Each penguin has an identifying band, the same color for mated
pairs, right wing for females, left for males. Penguins don't have
the external characteristics that make telling a male from a female
easy, so the aquarium determines gender via blood test when a
penguin is a few months old. But Urquhart says she can tell a
penguin's gender by its size and demeanor. ``Usually when I guess
the sex,'' she says, ``I'm 100 percent on.''
</P>
<P>
   She knows these birds so well that she doesn't look at the bands
to tell who is who. The little blue named Melbourne, she says, is
``kind of shy'' and the little blue Tasmania is ``pretty bold and
very curious.'' The African penguin named Robben, at 30-plus the
aquarium's oldest penguin, was morose when her mate, Mr. Shorty,
died in 1994, until she took up with a young male named Lambert who
was only 2.
</P>
<P>
   The little blues, who weigh only 1 1/2-2 1/2 pounds apiece, must
be happy, Urquhart says, because Tomeranaray laid two eggs, and she
and her mate, Martidekker, took turns sitting on them. Alas, both
eggs were infertile, which often happens the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Soon it's time to check on preparations for the 9 a.m. general
feeding. In the top-floor dive room, Vivian Ng, a Northeastern
co-op student, and three volunteers use crochet needles to hide
vitamins and antifungal medication into the gills of 60 thawed
smelt, one for each bird; the vitamins are necessary because
freezing robs fish of nutrients, and the medicine because the
stress of moving could make penguins susceptible to molds and
spores.
</P>
<P>
   At 9, it's down to the holding area for the first of three
meticulously orchestrated daily feedings. In pairs, one person
offers fish while another keeps count of how much each bird eats..
Yet another person rotates the fed birds through the area's three
pools so each will get a daily 15-minute swim, which is extra work
because when the exhibit is open, the penguins swim whenever they
want.
</P>
<P>
   When Mercury balks at eating, Urquhart cuddles him in her lap.
``There's more distraction here,'' she says, ``so they need a
little more prodding.''
</P>
<P>
   It is 10 a.m., time for Urquhart to dash upstairs for DY2xPE's
next feeding. The chick eats 10 percent of its body weight six
times a day. Urquhart gently lifts the baby and settles it on the
scale. Weight gain in three hours? Five grams.
</P>
<P>
   Then it's back to the holding area where volunteers and staffers
are scrubbing mats and scouring cages and rotating penguins through
the pools before the 1 o'clock feeding, as the cycle continues.

 ! poor, !! fair, !!! good, !!!! excellent  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; !!! &LR;  ``Children of Heaven'' An exquisite miniature from Iran's
Majid Majidi about children _ a brother and sister _ who cope
resourcefully with the loss of a pair of shoes the family can't
afford to replace. The film doesn't rely on cuteness (though its
young leads are more than cute); it allows the children to make
moral choices and follow through on them. (PG)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; !!!! &LR;  ``The General'' John Boorman's entertaining and
startlingly audacious biofilm about a Dublin crime lord played by
Brendan Gleeson, whose hand conceals his face by reflex but who
plays to his anti-authoritarian neighborhood's love of
theatricality as he rules his patch of turf like an ancient tribal
chief. (R)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; !! &LR;  1/2 ``Payback'' Mel Gibson as a bad guy this time _ a crook
who was double-crossed and left for dead and returns with a
we'll-bury-you-before-you-bury-us attitude as he works his way up
the criminal food chain. You've never seen him take as much
punishment as he takes here, but of course he just keeps on coming
in this kinetic but pretty soulless and mechanical outing. (R)
</P>
<P>
   (FR)  &UR; !!!! &LR;  ``Rushmore'' Invigoratingly original and flat-out
delightful comedy about two unlikely buddies in love with the same
pretty schoolteacher. Jason Schwartzman is a find as an obsessive,
precocious, and overextended prep-schooler. Bill Murray gives the
performance of his career as an unhappy steel tycoon aching to
remake his life. Going deep, Murray makes us realize what a master
of weighty deadpan glances he is in Wes Anderson's endearingly
unpredictable comedy. (R)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ! &LR;  ``Simply Irresistible'' Eminently resistible. Formulaic,
foody romantic comedy that slights both romance and comedy.
Struggling restaurateur Amanda (Sarah Michelle Gellar, of ``Buffy
the Vampire Slayer'') meets uptight yuppie restaurateur Tom (Sean
Patrick Flanery) and invisible sparks fly. Dead on arrival. (PG-13)
(Jim Sullivan)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; !!! &LR;  ``The Swindle'' Claude Chabrol goes lightly Hitchcockian
in his 50th film. The mystery here is the exact nature of the
relationship between a longtime scam team played by Isabelle
Huppert and Michel Serrault. Are they husband and wife? Lovers?
Father and daughter? Or just business partners? The shifts in
dynamic are more intriguing than her scheme for a big score.

ROVING POET WANTS TO SHARE YOUR LETTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KENNEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass._ Last year, Andrew Carroll was crisscrossing
the country handing out books of poetry. This year, he's asking
people to send him their family's wartime letters.
</P>
<P>
   So strongly does Carroll feel about his dual mission to make
poetry accessible and to prompt people to write letters more often
that he's handing out copies of his book ``Letters of a Nation: A
Collection of Extraordinary American Letters,'' and is looking for
new places to hand out books of poetry.
</P>
<P>
   Over lunch last week, Carroll _ who is 28 and lived in Wellesley
before moving to Washington as a teenager _ talked of the
connection he sees between poetry and letters. ``They're really
alike,'' he said. ``Both of them give such great insight into the
human experience, and they offer to others so much of who and what
we are ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Putting together ``Letters of a Nation,'' published this month
in paperback by Broadway Books, involved working with dozens of
librarians and archivists to obtain about 200 letters that deal
with public issues and personal matters _ and many that express
personal views on public matters, such as President Clinton's
correspondence with his draft board and the essayist E. B. White's
missiveabout not paying a local dog tax. Another letter, by
Boston-bred humorist Fred Allen, is a droll treatise on the
problems of writing long letters.
</P>
<P>
   The many wartime letters in the collection, such as Civil War
General William Tecumseh Sherman's letter to the mayor of Atlanta
explaining why he had ordered the burning of the city, and a letter
from a World War I infantryman ``to be opened if I am killed,'' so
affected Carroll that last fall he began the Legacy Project,
seeking other wartime writings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought people would be possessive about those wartime
letters,'' Carroll said, but he has received hundreds, ``so many of
them the last ones that were received'' before the embattled writer
_ son, husband, brother _ was killed in action.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll's goal in soliciting these letters is ``first, just to
get people to look for them because every day they're being
destroyed in fires'' _ as happened with his own family's letters _
or are just being thrown out. Beyond that, Carroll wants to get as
many as possible donated to museums and archives for use by
scholars and researchers.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Legacy Project, Carroll also heads up the
American Poetry and Literacy Project, a nonprofit organization that
he founded with the late Nobel laureate Joseph Brodsky.
</P>
<P>
   The poetry project is best known for distributing hundreds of
thousands of books of poetry. This year, it will give a collection
of poems dealing with adventure and travel to Peace Corps workers
and others.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll says he has been touched deeply himself by his
experiences as a poetry-nurturer and letter-collector. Giving away
copies of a collection of love poems at the Wedding Chapel in Las
Vegas last year was ``pure fun,'' Carroll said, but then a few
weeks later he was at the Angola State Prison in Louisiana. ``I was
out in the exercise yard with them _ there was no protective shield
between us _ and these guys would come up to me and recite poems
they knew. It was a powerful experience to see them engaged in
something so passionate as poetry.''
</P>
<P>
   Next weekend _ for Valentine's Day _ sleeping-car passengers out
of Boston on Amtrak's Twilight Shoreliner will receive copies of
the ``Letters of a Nation'' collection. Along with the book,
Carroll said, the travelers will receive stationery, envelopes
stamped with the cupid ``love'' stamp, and a pen as an incentive to
write love letters.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll acknowledges that in the age of the e-mail, the
hand-written love letter may be a thing of the past. ``E-mail is a
wonderful way to flirt,'' he said, admitting that he carried on a
relationship with a former girlfrind by e-mail _ and was dumped by
her via e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can present yourself as a great wit in e-mail, even if
you've slaved over the message for hours,'' Carroll said. ``But
when you're in a real relationship, it's important to write an
honest-to-goodness love letter,'' because, he said, ``the implicit
message of a letter is that you matter.''

A ROTH IRA STRATEGY FOR STRUGGLING FUNDS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I am presently enrolled in a 403(b) plan, and included in
this portfolio are holdings in Fidelity's Latin America and
Emerging Markets funds. Would it be a good investment strategy to
roll over these positions into a traditional IRA, and then convert
that IRA into a Roth IRA, thereby lessening the tax bite and giving
the funds time to recover?
</P>
<P>
   J.H., Worcester, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I like it. I presume your thinking is that while these two
battered funds are now fairly cheap, a true long-term investor will
be well rewarded by sticking with them. If that thinking is
correct, by switching the holding from a tax-deferred to a tax-free
status, you'll be paying taxes to Uncle based on the current
depressed value. (Three-year returns for Latin America fund show
average annual gains of only 5.26 percent, and Emerging Markets
shows a horrifying 19.80 percent average annual loss for the same
period.)
</P>
<P>
   You should, however, remember a few things. One is that you'll
have to have the cash on hand to pay the taxes on the conversion to
the Roth IRA; if you withdraw some of the funds to take care of the
tax liability, that counts as a premature withdrawal and is subject
both to taxation as income plus a 10 percent premature withdrawal
penalty (unless you're over age 59 1/2). Another thing to keep in
mind is that all of the taxliability for this move will fall in
tax-year 1999; the provision allowing taxpayers to spread the tax
liability for a traditional IRA-to-Roth IRA transfer expired at the
end of last year. Finally, you should remember that once this money
has been put into a Roth IRA, it must remain there at least five
years before withdrawal; even if you're over age 59 1/2 you'd face
a penalty if the money is withdrawn before five years have expired.
And in this arithmetic, it doesn't matter how long the money might
have been in a traditional IRA before being transferred to the
Roth; the five-year clock starts ticking upon the deposit into the
Roth account.
</P>
<P>
   This strategy can be applied more broadly by other retirement
savers. If there are segments of your retirement portfolio which
you expect to produce the best results _ either temporarily
distressed holdings such as these or other holdings for which the
long-term prospects seem particularly bright _ the Roth is the best
place for them. To draw an exaggerated example, suppose your
retirement portfolio is evenly divided between GNMA fund shares and
shares of a fund focusing on sectors such as health care or
computer technology. Over a long period, it's reasonable to assume
that the GNMA fund will plug along with average annual total
returns in the 7.5 percent to 8.5 percent; it's also reasonable to
presume that after a pretty bumpy ride, the long-term owner of the
two sector funds will see average annual total returns in double
digits. By using Roth accounts for the riskier but potentially more
rewarding holdings, the owner would be likely to achieve his or her
greater gains in the tax-free account. It seems to me that even for
those who don't go to extremes such as I outline above, the best
strategy for holders of Roth IRAs as well as tax-deferred accounts
is to have the more conservative holdings in the tax-deferred
accounts, and those with a higher risk-reward profile in the Roth.
(But also remember that a Roth is no place to speculate, because
you pay the taxes up front, and if you then lose the money _ tough
beans.)
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am a 21-year-old full-time college student, and had a son
last August. I have about $2,000 saved that I want to put in some
kind of Education IRA to build a fund that in 18 years will be near
the $100,000 mark. For the next couple of years, until I get out of
college, I will only be able to invest $50 a month. Do I have
enough money to start a fund? Where might I invest?
</P>
<P>
   J.Q., South Boston &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Sure you have enough money, but you might want to think twice
about the educational IRA. First of all, given the $500-a-year
limitation on contributions, it's likely that an educational IRA
would only take you about a quarter way to your goal. But the more
important message is that sometimes there are more important thing
than saving money on taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The big feature of the Education IRA is that the entire amount
accumulated in an account can be withdrawn tax-free, provided the
owner or a sibling uses it for qualified postsecondary education.
In effect, Uncle Sam promises to overlook taxes on the earnings
generated by the account. Let's suppose you made the full $500
annual contributions to such an account for 18 years and the
account produced average annual returns of 8 percent. In the end,
your son would have $19,413, of which $9,000 would be your
contributions and the remaining $15,413 would represent earnings
from the account.
</P>
<P>
   But the accumulation would also represent assets owned by the
student and which would be deemed by the agencies which handle
financial aid applications to be available to meet his college
expenses. While these agencies also consider the parents' assets,
only a low percentage of parents assets _ currently 5.65 percent _
is treated as available for educational costs. For that reason,
experts on saving money for college generally suggest that saving
always be done in the parents name, even if it means a higher tax
burden during the accumulation period. The exception is for parents
who are very very wealthy and who expect very little or nothing in
the way of financial aid for their children. Moreover, the current
edition of Paying For College Without Going Broke by Kalman A.
Chany suggests it will likely prove that Education IRAs are only
appropriate for upper-income families with relatively young
children who are absolutely certain that they will not qualify for
financial aid.
</P>
<P>
   Given the fact that you're still in college and your future
financial status is likely more a matter of conjecture than
analysis, I'd err on the safe side and stay away from the
educational IRAs.
</P>
<P>
   Now, to accumulate $100,000 over an 18-year period, beginning
with two years of $50 monthly contributions, you would have to
raise the monthly savings level to $253 for the last 16 years,
again presuming 8 percent average portfolio returns. (I use that
figure, rather than the 10 percent I usually plug into retirement
portfolios, because while you might start out with an all-stock
fund, about the time of the student's ninth or tenth birthday
you'll want to begin moderating risk, until by the time the student
enters college the bulk of the money is in very conservative
holdings.) As a savings vehicle, I'd start out with a solid growth
and income fund, of which there are hundreds of examples. An easy
choice is a fund such as Vanguard Index 500, which simply seeks to
track the results of the Standard and Poor's 500 Index. This fund
has a minimum investment of $3,000, so you'd have to save a little
more before beginning. Or you could shop around among the large-cap
blend funds in the Morningstar Mutual Funds reports, seeking a fund
which might produce similar results but which has a lower minimum
initial investment.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My wife and I are in a quandary about the diversification of
our mutual funds. We've been investing in stocks and mutual funds
through 401(k)s and with saved-up cash for eight years now. When
reviewing our finances this year, we look at the diversification
and found that almost all of our money is in large company stocks
and funds. We are wondering if we should sell some of our holdings
and diversify to mid-cap and/or small-cap funds, and if so to what
degree. This would have a significant tax impact, as about half of
the accumulation in most of our taxable accounts represents
unrealized capital gains.
</P>
<P>
   J.F., Newton, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Although you're right that your portfolio is
over-concentrated in large-cap stocks and funds with portfolios
dominated by large-caps, you don't need to worry about short-term
tax liability when you rebalance the portfolio. That's because the
breakout you supplied showed that 61 percent of the total portfolio
(excluding funds set aside for your children's education) is in
401(k) accounts and IRAs. You can make any changes you want within
those portfolios _ at least any changes you want within the
limitations of the options available through the 401(k)s _ and
there will be no tax consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is true that about 95 percent of your taxable
holdings are in large-cap stocks, I suggest you simply treat those
holdings as collectively representing your core portfolio holding.
</P>
<P>
   Then you can adjust your tax-deferred holdings so that the
overall portfolio is better diversified. My suggestion for overall
portfolio balance is 50 percent large cap, 20 percent small cap,
and 10 percent each in mid-cap, international and health care
investments.
</P>
<P>
   Since you're quite young _ both of you 34 years old _ that final
suggestion of a good health care fund (such as the Fidelity and
Vanguard offerings) should prove a big winner over the long term,
and given your youth, I might be tempted to bump that allocation up
to 15 percent, reducing the small-cap position accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   The net tax effect of all these moves? Nothing.

<P>
   To the end, he was a king.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein ibn Talal had spoken of his own mortality many times,
and his last journey Friday _ six thousand miles from an American
deathbed to the land he ruled for 46 years _ became him. Soldiers
prefer to die at home.
</P>
<P>
   He was an honorable man. He believed that if he trusted enough
in another person, his good faith would be returned; he was cruelly
rewarded...
</P>
<P>
   What king would ever turn up at his own state security jail to
drive his most vociferous political prisoner home?
</P>
<P>
   Leith Shubailath had infuriated the monarch _ he was a man
easily riled _ and was imprisoned for asking why the queen wept at
Yitzhak Rabin's funeral. When the king arrived at the prison,
Shubeilath delayed him ten minutes while he said goodbye to his
fellow inmates. Hussein waited patiently for him.
</P>
<P>
   Would Saddam (who prefers to string his prisoners up) have done
that? Would King Fahd? Would President Mubarak? Would Benjamin
Netanyahu?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it is this which distinguished the king: among the
monsters of the Middle East, he appeared such a reasonable man.
</P>
<P>
   He was, in a very real sense, the region's political Bomb
Disposal Officer, the one man who could be relied on to calm
nerves, order bystanders to open their windows and then gently,
firmly, withdraw the detonator of war.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Arabs and Israelis fear for the future. What are they
going to do now that there is no one to defuse the bombs? &QL;

   AMMAN _ Signs of outward grief are everywhere in the Jordanian
capital. Outside the Al-Hussein Medical Center where King Hussein
had just died women braved the driving rain to sob; some fell
fainting to the ground as they waited for the king's body to leave
the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Even more moving than the tears, though, was the way in which
Jordanians, who are not used to cold, groped their way forward in
the white banks of mist to express sorrow for their beloved king.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in Amman, people looked worried more than
grief-striken. King Hussein had always protected them from the dark
forces around Jordan; what will happen to their tiny, vulnerable
kingdom now that he is gone? &QL;

Jordanians, many carrying black flags of mourning, drove in cars
and trucks through the driving rain and thick, ominous mist to
tearfully wait for his body to be removed from the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Shopkeepers pulled down the metal shutters of their shops,
closing up as a sign of respect for the beloved king _ and father
figure _ who had ruled Jordan for a staggering 46 years.

   In Jordan King Hussein was a benevolent autocrat, ultimately
controlling everything but avoiding extreme repression. As one

<P>
   The King has been a good leader, of his own people and of wider
Arab interests in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>

   He played both ends against the middle because he believed
(correctly) that Jordan's weakness _ 4.4 million people and no
natural resources or defenses _ left him no choice.

<P>
   By Robert Fisk &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When King Hussein began his initial six months of cancer
treatment at the Mayo Clinic last year, his younger brother Hassan
should have cast his mind back to the day, 43 years earlier, when
another trusted servant of the monarchy believed he was secure in
his job.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein was only 21 but had already argued brusquely with
Lieutenant General Sir John Bagot Glubb, commander of his Arab
Legion and principal military adviser to his majesty.
</P>
<P>
   Persuaded by his own confidants that Glubb Pasha should be
dismissed, and convinced that the British were trying to control
Jordan's armed forces, the king fired the 59-year old British
general. Glubb Pasha was taken to the airport the next morning in
Hussein's own car.
</P>
<P>
   Ignoring this historical precedent, Crown Prince Hassan used his
regency last year to boost his own image, to project his rule in
the Jordanian press and to demand the firing of Hussein's chief of
staff.
</P>
<P>
   To the sick king in Minnesota, his brother Hassan was trying to
take over the army _ just as Glubb was trying to do in 1956.
</P>
<P>
   But Hassan could not be packed off to Amman airport. Instead,
the king came home, disgraced his brother and picked another
Sandhurst graduate as regent _ a man, ironically, of whom Glubb
Pasha would have approved _ Hussein's eldest son, Abdullah... &QL;

   All across the Arab world, age and sickness haunt the lands.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's King Hussein is dead, having succumbed to his toughest
enemy, cancer. Saudi Arabia's King Fahd can barely stand, and
stumbles on the simplest sentences. Yasser Arafat suffers ever more
from the brain tumor inflicted after a near-fatal air crash.
Syria's Hafez Assad suffers from a heart condition, and has lost
his heir-apparent son, Basil, in a road accident. Egypt's Hosni
Mubarak has never appointed a vice-president, let alone a
successor.

<P>
   ``Succession'': it's the Middle East's unspoken crisis. The
great unmentionable. But it is real.

   We in the West, of course, accept the Arab world's odd,
dangerous system of inheritance. Why? Because we like
dictatorships. We know how to do business with the kings and
generals _ how to sell them our arms, fighter-bombers and missiles.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that we, as well as the Arab regimes themselves,
have produced and maintained this archaic drama of crown princes
and beloved sons, of gulf sheikhdoms that are no more than the
private property of individual families... &QL;

and his last journey Friday _ six thousand miles from an American
deathbed to the land he ruled for 46 years _ became him. Soldiers
prefer to die at home.
</P>
<P>
   He was an honorable man. He believed that if he trusted enough
in another person, his good faith would be returned; he was cruelly
rewarded...
</P>
<P>
   What king would ever turn up at his own state security jail to
drive his most vociferous political prisoner home?
</P>
<P>
   Leith Shubailath had infuriated the monarch _ he was a man
easily riled _ and was imprisoned for asking why the queen wept at
Yitzhak Rabin's funeral. When the king arrived at the prison,
Shubeilath delayed him ten minutes while he said goodbye to his
fellow inmates. Hussein waited patiently for him.
</P>
<P>
   Would Saddam (who prefers to string his prisoners up) have done
that? Would King Fahd? Would President Mubarak? Would Benjamin
Netanyahu?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it is this which distinguished the king: among the
monsters of the Middle East, he appeared such a reasonable man.
</P>
<P>
   He was, in a very real sense, the region's political Bomb
Disposal Officer, the one man who could be relied on to calm
nerves, order bystanders to open their windows and then gently,
firmly, withdraw the detonator of war.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Arabs and Israelis fear for the future. What are they
going to do now that there is no one to defuse the bombs? &QL;

   ``With our blood, with our soul, we sacrifice ourselves to
you!'' And as the mist swept around me _ such wind, such very thick

portraying the dead king who lay only a few hundred feet from us.

<P>
   AMMAN _ Signs of outward grief are everywhere in the Jordanian
capital. Outside the Al-Hussein Medical Center where King Hussein
had just died women braved the driving rain to sob; some fell
fainting to the ground as they waited for the king's body to leave
the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Even more moving than the tears, though, was the way in which
Jordanians, who are not used to cold, groped their way forward in
the white banks of mist to express sorrow for their beloved king.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in Amman, people looked worried more than
grief-striken. King Hussein had always protected them from the dark
forces around Jordan; what will happen to their tiny, vulnerable
kingdom now that he is gone? &QL;

   AMMAN _ As news of the death of King Hussein spread through
Amman, the Jordanian capital, just before noon Sunday thousands of
Jordanians, many carrying black flags of mourning, drove in cars
and trucks through the driving rain and thick, ominous mist to
tearfully wait for his body to be removed from the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Shopkeepers pulled down the metal shutters of their shops,
closing up as a sign of respect for the beloved king _ and father
figure _ who had ruled Jordan for a staggering 46 years.
</P>
<P>
   In Jordan King Hussein was a benevolent autocrat, ultimately
controlling everything but avoiding extreme repression. As one
member of the opposition said: ``You could try to overthrow him but
he would still forgive you in the end.'' &QL;

</P>
<P>
   As the West pays its respects to the memory of King Hussein of
Jordan, it should pause to acknowledge a conundrum.
</P>
<P>
   The King has been a good leader, of his own people and of wider
Arab interests in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   It is to be hoped that the rather Shakespearian deathbed
maneuvers, dashing at the 11th hour his brother's 34-year
expectation of inheriting the crown in favor of his eldest son,
Abdullah, will come to good... &QL;

   AMMAN _ It was always a balancing act. Jordan is a buffer state
between more powerful countries, notably Israel and Iraq. King
Hussein's political career was spent playing off his enemies
against each other.
</P>
<P>
   He played both ends against the middle because he believed
(correctly) that Jordan's weakness _ 4.4 million people and no
natural resources or defenses _ left him no choice.
</P>
<P>
   His death, comes at a bad moment for Jordan. His neighbors _
indeed, the world _ awaits to see if the house King Hussein built
will hold together. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   By Robert Fisk &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When King Hussein began his initial six months of cancer
treatment at the Mayo Clinic last year, his younger brother Hassan
should have cast his mind back to the day, 43 years earlier, when
another trusted servant of the monarchy believed he was secure in
his job.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein was only 21 but had already argued brusquely with
Lieutenant General Sir John Bagot Glubb, commander of his Arab
Legion and principal military adviser to his majesty.
</P>
<P>
   Persuaded by his own confidants that Glubb Pasha should be
dismissed, and convinced that the British were trying to control
Jordan's armed forces, the king fired the 59-year old British
general. Glubb Pasha was taken to the airport the next morning in
Hussein's own car.
</P>
<P>
   Ignoring this historical precedent, Crown Prince Hassan used his
regency last year to boost his own image, to project his rule in
the Jordanian press and to demand the firing of Hussein's chief of
staff.
</P>
<P>
   To the sick king in Minnesota, his brother Hassan was trying to
take over the army _ just as Glubb was trying to do in 1956.
</P>
<P>
   But Hassan could not be packed off to Amman airport. Instead,
the king came home, disgraced his brother and picked another
Sandhurst graduate as regent _ a man, ironically, of whom Glubb
Pasha would have approved _ Hussein's eldest son, Abdullah... &QL;

<P>
   By Robert Fisk &QL;
</P>
<P>
   All across the Arab world, age and sickness haunt the lands.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's King Hussein is dead, having succumbed to his toughest
enemy, cancer. Saudi Arabia's King Fahd can barely stand, and
stumbles on the simplest sentences. Yasser Arafat suffers ever more
from the brain tumor inflicted after a near-fatal air crash.
Syria's Hafez Assad suffers from a heart condition, and has lost
his heir-apparent son, Basil, in a road accident. Egypt's Hosni
Mubarak has never appointed a vice-president, let alone a
successor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Succession'': it's the Middle East's unspoken crisis. The
great unmentionable. But it is real.
</P>
<P>
   We in the West, of course, accept the Arab world's odd,
dangerous system of inheritance. Why? Because we like
dictatorships. We know how to do business with the kings and
generals _ how to sell them our arms, fighter-bombers and missiles.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that we, as well as the Arab regimes themselves,
have produced and maintained this archaic drama of crown princes
and beloved sons, of gulf sheikhdoms that are no more than the
private property of individual families... &QL;

   NEW RELEASES: ``Antz'' _ One of the best animated films released
last year. Woody Allen, spoofing his angst-ridden persona, is
terrific as the psychiatric patient ant bemoaning his troubles
while lying on a leaf. Enough sophistication for adults while still
appealing to children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next Stop Wonderland'' _ Boston-area fans will enjoy the
settings for this well-received independent film. The notion of
romantic timing is wonderfully explored, and the performances are
first-rate. The story sags a bit, but the end result is satisfying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rounders'' _ Edward Norton and Matt Damon head a smart cast in
director John Dahl's provocative exploration of high-stakes poker.
The carefully detailed character study keeps a dead-eye on the
steely professionalism of a group of card players. A film as tough
and hard-headed as Amarillo Slim.

   ``Legionnaire'' _ This big-budget Claude Van Damme feature
sacrifices action for character and plot development. No surprise
there. This foreign-legion, direct-to-video release gets stuck in
the sand. Rent ``Lawrence of Arabia'' or ``Gunga Din'' instead.

GENDER CALLED FACTOR IN SCIENTISTS' VIEW OF TECHNOLOGICAL PERILS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   When it comes to the hazards of technology and environmental
perils, men and women do not always see eye to eye, not even when
they are both scientists.
</P>
<P>
   Women are a bit more likely than men to believe there is good
reason to worry about technological hazards widely publicized in
the media, like global warming, pesticides on food, and exposure to
magnetic fields, a study has found. The study included two surveys;
one questioned laypeople, the other targeted scientists.
</P>
<P>
   Previous studies have shown that women tend to be more concerned
about such hazards, but the new research is the first to reveal a
gender difference even among scientists, said the author of the
study, John D. Graham of the Harvard School of Public Health.
</P>
<P>
   Though the surveys did not ask for the ``why'' element of the
responses, Graham said he and his colleagues have some theories.
</P>
<P>
   ``One is that women may feel more vulnerable in terms of the
consequences of these hazards than do men,'' he said. ``Women may
feel more responsible for the health of the household, and take
more seriously claims for these hazards.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Another is that men may have jobs that are more
technologically oriented, and they may have more of a protechnology
bias,'' said Graham, who directs the Center for Risk Analysis at
Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   Two reports on the study are being published in the February
issue of the journal Technology. They are based on two surveys, one
of 1,000 laypersons reached through random phone calls, and another
that questioned 260 scientists who belong to the prestigious
National Institute of Medicine and have published articles on
technological hazards.
</P>
<P>
   Only 52 of the scientists were women, which Graham acknowledged
could weaken the findings of that part of the study.
</P>
<P>
   The surveys asked respondents to rate eight technological
hazards on a 10-point scale as to how confident they were that the
threats existed. A score of 10 would mean complete confidence that
the hazards were real and a 0 would indicate complete confidence
that they did not exist.
</P>
<P>
   The hazards, chosen from two years of national print media
stories, were: global warming from carbon dioxide pollution;
particulate air pollution; electromagnetic fields from power lines;
natural radon gas in homes; medical X-rays; second-hand tobacco
smoke; depletion of the ozone layer of the atmosphere; and
pesticides on foods.
</P>
<P>
   Laypeople and scientists had similar ratings of some hazards,
such as second-hand smoke and threats to the ozone layer, but
laypeople were more troubled by pesticides on foods and
electromagnetic fields.
</P>
<P>
   For three of the eight hazard questions, women scientists were
significantly more sure than male scientists that the risks
existed: electromagnetic fields, pesticides on foods, and
second-hand smoke. Overall, the women scored the eight hazards at
6.41 on the confidence rating scale, while men put it at 5.82,
though this difference was not statistically significant.
</P>
<P>
   From the point of view of one woman scientist not involved in
the survey, the findings could be subject to dangerous
misinterpretation. ``We don't want this to be seen as women being
hysterical'' on the subject of technological risk, said Ellen
Silbergeld, professor of epidemiology and toxicology at the
University of Maryland Medical School in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   She also questioned the research methods, saying that other
factors might have been just as important as gender in respondents'
ratings _ such as socioeconomic status, employment in a
technology-oriented job, or their health status.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Silbergeld emphasized there is no ``right'' answer
about controversial hazards like those on the survey. ``We don't
want to turn over our democracy to a priesthood of people who have
PhD's,'' she said in an interview.

TWINS ARE PIONEERS IN AIDS RESEARCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ A pair of nearly 4-year-old Massachusetts twins may
show researchers how the immune system can keep the human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in check, just as it normally disarms
the lifelong viral infections that cause measles and cold sores.
</P>
<P>
   University of Massachusetts researchers conducting a novel,
$250,000 experiment with the twins say its success would achieve
the Holy Grail of AIDS research _ immune system control of HIV _
and point the way for adult therapy as well. The researchers, Dr.
John Sullivan and Dr. Katherine Luzuriaga of the UMass Medical
School in Worcester, described the project in an interview last
week during a conference here on HIV.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists at Therion Biologics, a Cambridge, Mass.
biotechnology firm, are at work fabricating a vaccine from pieces
of the particular HIV strain the twins acquired from their mother
before or during birth. The UMass researchers are betting heavily
that the vaccine will ``teach'' the children's immune systems to
recognize and attack the HIV that lurks somewhere in their bodies,
even though the most sensitive blood tests have been unable to
detect it for years now.
</P>
<P>
   The only way to be sure the vaccine has worked will be to
suspend the triple-drug regimen the twins have been on since
infancy to see if the virus comes out of hiding. The twins were
among the first anywhere to receive potent anti-HIV ``cocktails''
that have transformed AIDS over the past three years into a
treatable chronic disease _ at least for many in affluent nations.
</P>
<P>
   The bold Umass experiment is one of many signs that AIDS
researchers are turning their attention to immune control as the
glimmering best hope _ most likely the only hope _ of beating HIV
in the long run. It is now plain that drugs alone won't do the job.
Many if not most AIDS researchers are convinced that immune
responses specifically directed against HIV need to become ``our
other drug,'' as Dr. Stefano Vella of the Italian National
Institute of Health puts it.
</P>
<P>
   Research presented at the Sixth Conference on Retroviruses and
Opportunistic Infections, as the Chicago meeting is called,
demonstrates that:
</P>
<P>
   --Current drug regimens are not potent enough to suppress HIV
below detectable levels in 30 to 50 percent of patients.
</P>
<P>
   --Treatment eventually fails in a substantial fraction of HIV
patients who respond to drug-treatment initially (one-third in one
large three-year study) because the virus ``breaks through.''
</P>
<P>
   --HIV strains quickly emerge that are resistant to all three
classes of antiviral drugs (and will eventually to new drugs in the
pipeline, scientists expect), and resistant strains are being
transmitted from one person to another.
</P>
<P>
   --Severe metabolic side effects, such as fat deposits, high
cholesterol, and diabetes, afflict about 10 percent of long-term
users of triple-drug treatment; less-severe side effects appear in
up to 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Counterbalancing these gloomy reports, however, are many new
signs that the immune system can fight HIV and win. This has set
researchers on a quest for strategies that combine drugs and immune
boosters. The drugs limit HIV's damage to the immune system and
keep the virus suppressed, while the boosters would keep immune
cells on lifelong alert for any HIV that re-emerges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly we now have the evidence that the immune system works
and can be a good companion to anti-retroviral therapy,'' Vella
says. ``Even a few months ago, we didn't think the immune system
did anything in HIV disease.''
</P>
<P>
   One line of evidence comes from studies of ``long-term
non-progressors,'' the lucky few individuals who can keep the virus
in check for years without any drug treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a group, these `non-progressors' have extremely low viral
loads 15 years after being infected with HIV,'' says Dr. Thomas C.
Greenough of UMass.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers are learning what sets the immune systems of these
non-progressors apart. For instance, Greenough notes, their blood
contains high levels of so-called CD8 cells in an activated state,
a sign they are on constant alert against HIV. Scientists believe
CD8 cells, one of the body's main lines of defense against viruses,
secrete a chemical factor that kills HIV, but so far the factor has
not been identified.
</P>
<P>
   Also in non-progressors, critical immune cells, called CD4 or
``helper'' cells, invariably maintain their ability to recognize
HIV proteins, reported Dr. Eric S. Rosenberg of Massachusetts
General Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   But what about the vast majority of HIV patients who can't
control the virus on their own? Other new evidence shows that
HIV-damaged immune systems slowly recover with Highly Active
Anti-Retroviral Treatment, or HAART, as the multidrug therapy is
known. The proof is in studies of patients who are deliberately
taken off other medications given to prevent ``opportunistic''
infections such as cytomegalovirus (CMV), which can cause blindness
and pneumocystis, a frequent cause of fatal pneumonia among
patients in the pre-HAART era.
</P>
<P>
   In a study of 47 HAART patients whose anti-CMV drugs were
stopped, ``the data indeed suggest restoration of immunity
sufficient to protect against CMV relapse in 90 percent,'' says Dr.
Brigitte Autran of the Pitie Salpetriere Hospital in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly encouraging is a Spanish study of 400 patients
randomly assigned either to stay on, or stop, drugs that prevent
pneumocystic pneumonia. There were no cases of pneumonia in either
group.
</P>
<P>
   Against the backdrop of evidence that patients' immune systems
can be reconstituted after damage by HIV, the most intriguing new
research shows that brief holidays from HAART may be key to keeping
the virus in check. This runs counter to the prevailing dogma that
it is dangerous for HAART patients to miss a single dose of drug,
lest the virus seize the chance to develop mutations that make it
drug-resistant.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence so far is still anecdotal, but a few patients
around the world have mounted immune defenses against HIV after
stopping all multidrug therapy. The most famous case, the so-called
``Berlin patient,'' stopped HAART twice for medical reasons; he
remains healthy and without detectable HIV in his blood 25 months
after the second cessation, says Dr. Franco Lori of Project RIGHT,
an AIDS research program in Washington and Pavia, Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Lori has studied three other patients who have stopped HAART for
brief periods, and in each case it took longer for HIV to reappear
in their bloodstreams _ from one week after the first holiday to as
long as eight weeks after the third interruption.
</P>
<P>
   Lori repeated the experiment with three macaque monkeys infected
with the simian version of HIV. After several treatment
interruptions, all three monkeys have undetectable blood levels of
virus after about 100 days without drug treatment. Lori plans
larger experiments with monkeys and humans this year.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the new evidence suggests that HAART may be too
effective. By suppressing HIV so well, the regimens apparently
deprive patients' immune systems of HIV proteins needed to mount a
specific immune response to the virus.
</P>
<P>
   That is why, the UMass researchers think, the little girl in
their twin pair has no antibodies to HIV, nor do her immune cells
recognize the virus in the test tube. But her brother has low
levels of antibodies and at least a weak cellular response to HIV _
because his virus briefly broke through the drug barrier 17 months
ago with a burst of replication that his immune system still
``remembers.''
</P>
<P>
   Once they have a vaccine custom-made against the twins' virus,
the Umass researchers plan to administer it in hopes the children's
immune system will make both antibodies and immune cells
specifically targeted to any of the virus that emerges from
sanctuaries within their bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan and Luzuriaga hope they can use a therapeutic vaccine,
rather than treatment interruptions, to tweak the twins' immune
systems into effective vigilance against HIV. If the signs are
good, they hope to try it on 10 other children who are long-term
HAART successes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea,'' Sullivan says, ``will be to try to convert these
kids into long-term non-progressors.''

 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. CHANDLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe

<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Since our earliest ancestors first began to
form abstract questions, the most fundamental one of all has been
this: Where did we, and everything around us, come from _ and what
is our ultimate fate?
</P>
<P>
   To many people, worrying about such things may seem as relevant,
and the answers as believable, as medieval theological arguments
about how many angels could dance on the head of a pin. But as
solid new evidence is mounting, that could change very soon.
</P>
<P>
   For more than 20 years Andrei Linde, a Soviet emigre physicist
who now works at Stanford University, along with a few colleagues,
has been gradually developing a mind-bending answer to that
question. He suggests that the universe we live in, and the Big
Bang that most scientists think spawned it, are just one of a
nearly infinite number of such places and events that may have been
going on forever and that will continue for all eternity.
</P>
<P>
   There may be some comfort in this scenario for anyone troubled
by last year's finding by several astrophysicists that our universe
seems destined to run out of steam, expanding forever but gradually
becoming cold, sparse, and totally lifeless. Even though this
universe that began with a bang may go out with a cosmic whimper,
according to Linde's views, billions of other universes will carry
on forever. And, in one of his theory's more exotic possibilities,
some of those new universes could be ones that someday our human
descendants will, in god-like fashion, deliberately create.
</P>
<P>
   Linde's ideas were once considered among the more exotic
variations of a set of theories known as inflationary cosmology,
but a variety of discoveries in recent years have greatly
undermined the competing notions. ``Ten years ago, it was
completely crazy. Today, it explains many observations,'' Linde
says. It's beginning to look as if Linde's cosmology which he calls
``the eternally self-reproducing universe'' _ or some new variation
of it _ could soon be the last theory left standing.
</P>
<P>
   But what some cosmologists, including Linde, find even more
remarkable is this: We may be right on the verge of being able to
answer these ultimate questions _ which not long ago seemed
unanswerable _ once and for all.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a special time in which we live,'' said Linde recently
at a meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of
Science. While theories have come and gone or been modified beyond
recognition over the last few decades, ``in the next 10 or 20
years, we're going to have a fairly complete picture of the
universe that is not going to change for billions of years.''
</P>
<P>
   A new generation of orbiting telescopes and earthbound particle
accelerators should provide the data that can decisively answer
some of the most fundamental questions about our origins, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Echoing that sentiment, physicist Joel Primack of the University
of California, Santa Cruz, also speaking at the AAAS meeting, said
``it's an absolutely incredible moment that we're living through.''
</P>
<P>
   It's something like the era when North America was mapped for
the first time: It went from a complete unknown to a very specific
outline within a short time; while many details have continued to
be filled in since then, the basic picture, once discovered, has
not changed.
</P>
<P>
   Primack said ``the questions that we were able to ask early in
this century are beginning to be answered.'' Humanity is finally
reaching a time, he said, when we are ``beginning to see the
outline of the big picture.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Linde, ``We waited for this moment for perhaps 15
billion years.''
</P>
<P>
   The emerging answers may well turn out to be a surprise, even
for many physicists and astronomers. The origin of the universe may
have been far more complex and bizarre than the usual view of a
single, explosive Big Bang that started everything in a colossal
fireball.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, some cosmologists say the evidence is now pointing
toward a view in which our Big Bang was just one of a nearly
infinite number of such events. Each of these bangs may create an
entirely different universe, with different basic laws and even
different kinds of space with more or fewer dimensions than the
four (three of space and one of time) that we are accustomed to.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, Linde acknowledges, maybe all the theories will be
knocked down by new evidence that comes in, and cosmologists will
be forced to go back to the drawing board and start over.
</P>
<P>
   Astrophysicist Virginia Trimble of the University of California
at Irvine said the new finds could, among other things, answer a
question that has been troubling theorists for the last few
decades: Why is it that some of the most basic characteristics and
physical laws of our universe seem to have been ``fine tuned'' to
produce exactly the conditions needed for stars, planets and living
things to exist. If a few of the basic principles had been just the
slightest bit different _ differences that according to current
physical theory are just as likely as the way things actually are _
then we might have had a universe in which no matter ever formed,
or one in which no elements but hydrogen and helium, and none of
the building blocks needed for planets and people, could ever have
arisen.
</P>
<P>
   The question is ``Whether we are very lucky, or incredibly
lucky,'' to be living in a universe whose basic laws are ``just
right'' for us to exist, Trimble said. In other words, she said,
``Why should it be that we live in a universe that we can live
in?''
</P>
<P>
   In Linde's view, the answer is simple: It may be that all of the
different possibilities that could have arisen actually did arise,
each in their own universe (or region of the universe, depending on
how one chooses to define the term). But only those universes whose
laws permitted the existence of life ended up producing beings
capable of wondering about such things.

A LAME LOOK AT THE '60S 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARTIN F. NOLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO &UR;  &LR;  _ The previews for NBC's saga of the 1960s,
resembled ads for a theme park: Welcome to our safely sanitized
recreation of that rollicking time. Critics call the miniseries
tame and lame, but in ``sweeps'' time on television, a demographic
imperative tries (again) to woo baby boomers, the 76 million
Americans born between 1945 and 1964.
</P>
<P>
   In politics, the 1960s ``culture wars'' is overused shorthand
for later trends. Just as a few years at the decade's end dominate
popular recollections of it, so do its older, highly educated,
politically motivated protestors. These cultural and political
pioneers dominate, but however many said they were at Chicago
and/or Woodstock or hallucinated that they were, the figure does
not add up to 76 million.
</P>
<P>
   The full baby boom portrait is more homespun Americana than
Woodstock Nation. It's no stretch to suggest that while most baby
boomers are not fundamentalist Christians, most fundamentalist
Christians are baby boomers.
</P>
<P>
   Early baby boomers, now in their mid-50s, had more educational
opportunity than their younger siblings because classrooms were
less crowded and had better jobs in an expanding economy that later
faced downsizing.
</P>
<P>
   Like many older siblings, top-tier boomers became lecturers.
They were right on civil rights, right on the war in Vietnam, and
right on Richard Nixon, so on other issues they were sure they knew
best.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco is also a 1960s theme park, sometimes stuck in
1967's ``summer of love.'' At a sale of donated books from the
Friends of the San Francisco Public Library last week, I counted 22
copies, many in pristine condition, of ``The Greening of America,''
a 1970 ode to that decade.
</P>
<P>
   One notable San Franciscan, Robin Williams, warns that if you
can remember the 1960s, you must not have been there. But the lure
is still powerful, which explains the presence of white kids from
the suburbs panhandling on Haight Street near Ashbury Street.
</P>
<P>
   That fabled intersection is now adorned by a Ben &AMP; Jerry's
franchise, fighting fascism, war and injustice with Vermont
cholesterol. Nearby is another enduring legacy of the 1960s, a Gap
store.
</P>
<P>
   In American culture, clothing matters. In 1969, the first Gap
store opened, selling San Francisco's Levi jeans. The proprietors
whimsically named the shop after the great culture clash of the
time, the ``generation gap.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Gap Inc. reported worldwide sales of more than $9
billion in 1998. The company went public in 1976. Adjusted for
stock splits, a share of stock then was worth 17 cents. Last week,
it was worth $44. In American economics, duds do well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been John O'Hara'd, McNamara'd,'' sang Simon and
Garfunkel, the Manhattan minstrels of the late 1960s. ``I've been
Rolling Stoned and Beatled 'till I'm blind.'' Rock 'n' roll is not
only the Muzak of the theme park, but its politics, economics,
cuisine, and couture, as the NBC series makes clear in its
priorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've wanted to return to the 1960s since Dec. 31, 1969,''
Lynda Obst, executive producer of the miniseries, was quoted as
saying. ``The iconic events of the birth of the counterculture _
Dylan going electric, the sit-in at Columbia, Woodstock, and many
others _ provide this film's narrative drive.''
</P>
<P>
   Dylan going electric? When Robert Allen Zimmerman, a/k/a Bob
Dylan, the asthmatic warbler from Minnesota, discovered kilowatts
in 1965, a generation was apparently McNamara'd, if not O'Hara'd.
</P>
<P>
   Simon and Garfunkel sang of an infidel who thought Dylan ``meant
Dylan Thomas. The man ain't got no culture.'' If culture is a
serious business, then ``culture wars'' are not for the faint of
heart.
</P>
<P>
   When someone mentions culture, I reach for my revolver, Herman
Goering, the head of the Nazi air force, once said. Those who can
never know the 1960s, along with those who can never forget the
1960s, may want to remain noncombatants.

OLYMPIC SCRUTINY NOW FOCUSES ON ATLANTA'S AGGRESSIVE EFFORTS

 By MITCHELL ZUCKOFF AND JOHN POWERS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A shiver of surprise coursed through the ballroom of
Tokyo's New Prince Takinawa Hotel when International Olympic
Committee president Juan Antonio Samaranch announced that Atlanta
had won its long-shot bid to host the 1996 Summer Games.
</P>
<P>
   Whispers of influence peddling lingered for years after that
September 1990 IOC vote. Now, in the wake of revelations of payoffs
in Salt Lake City, surrounding the Utah capital's selection as the
site of the 2002 Winter Games, the questions have turned to
suspicions, and Atlanta has found its Olympic memories under
scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Hodler, the Swiss IOC official who set off the Salt Lake
scandal, triggered the inquiry when he suggested that Atlanta also
engaged in bribes and vote-buying. In December, when asked if he
thought Atlanta was clean, Hodler said, ``Certainly not.'' He said
it was hard to believe ``Atlanta could have been facing this
blackmail'' and won the Games without ``doing something.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, no specific evidence of wrongdoing has surfaced, and
Atlanta Olympic organizers spent the past week combing through
4,000 boxes of documentary history of the 1996 Games to prepare a
response to an IOC inquiry letter. That response will firmly
maintain they violated no laws or Olympic rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``No bribes, no scholarships, direct or indirect. No, sir,
absolutely none,'' Billy Payne Jr., the chief organizer and
visionary behind Atlanta's Olympic bid, said in an interview. Not
only were no offers made, Payne said, no payoffs or inappropriate
gifts were sought by IOC members or middlemen.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Olympic organizers here have refused to expedite the release
of the documents that reveal in excruciating detail the nearly
10-year effort to land and stage the 1996 Games. Payne said the
documents will be made public only after a lengthy archiving
process, though he would release some sooner if needed to refute
specific allegations.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta organizers, however, have acknowledged lavish
gift-giving and pampering that raised Southern hospitality to new
heights. It was an effort that cost $7.8 million, plus millions
more in donated services, raised largely from local corporations,
philanthropies, and wealthy individuals. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Symptomatic excess? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some critics say Atlanta's effort to land the 1996 Games
demonstrated the climate of excess within the entire Olympic
movement, paving the way for corruption in Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ethics here are fuzzy, and no one in Atlanta dares to get
righteous,'' Steve Hummer, a columnist with The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, wrote last month. ``There is no innocence,
only varying degrees of guilt in these crimes of influence.''
</P>
<P>
   Those criticisms got an added lift last week when Tom Welch, the
former president of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee, claimed
that former Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young was among those aware of the
cash and scholarships allegedly exchanged for votes from certain
IOC members.
</P>
<P>
   Young, who acted as an unpaid advisor to the Utah committee,
said in an interview he was aware of the program, but did not know
to whom the scholarships were given. Young also lashed out at the
media.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems naive or racist that the American press, and the
world press, should have put so much focus on humanitarian
assistance to poor people and label that as corruption, and not say
a word about the influence of $5 billion or $6 billion television
contracts, or the hundred-million-dollar marketing contracts,''
Young said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's be real _ the influence in the Olympic movement is not
in the hands of a few poor Africans or Asians or Latins,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Atlanta has made no secret of its aggressive
attempts from 1987 onward to influence IOC members, using
enticements large and small as a way to cement ``friendships'' that
would pay off in the form of a winning bid at the IOC's September
1990 site-selection meeting in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   ``You try to build the best relationship you can, to win these
people's trust and confidence,'' said Charlie Battle Jr., a lawyer
who was the Atlanta bid committee's chief international emissary.
``We did what we thought was appropriate and accepted and
recognized as the thing to do to put your best foot forward, within
the parameters of the regulations as we understood them.''
</P>
<P>
   There were the obligatory first-class airplane tickets,
exquisite meals, and rooms at the Marriott Marquis hotel; silver
mint julep cups; Cabbage Patch dolls; homespun touches like Claxton
fruitcakes and Vidalia onion relishes; limited-edition quilts and
embroidered ``Georgia on my mind'' pillow cases; video copies of
``Gone With The Wind''; visits by private jet to Savannah; and
yacht rides aboard The Highlander, owned by the family of Malcolm
Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   There also were personalized gifts _ chosen with help from
individual dossiers compiled on each IOC member. They included a
print of a building at Amherst College for Prince Albert of Monaco,
an alumnus; a carved walking stick for an IOC delegate from San
Juan who walked with a cane; a meeting with famed architect John
Portman for a Mexican IOC member in the same profession; symphony
tickets for music lovers and outings to the exclusive Augusta
National Golf Club for golf enthusiasts; and a bulldog for a Cuban
IOC delegate who grew enamored of the University of Georgia mascot.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta organizers also helped pick up the tab when David
Sibandze, an IOC member from Swaziland, spent four days at Piedmont
Hospital after collapsing with a heart ailment. Sibandze resigned
from the IOC last month when it was revealed his son received
scholarships and a job through the SLOC. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `They didn't break any rules' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Still, Atlanta organizers insist they were far less excessive
than other bid cities, which in some cases spent twice as much.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing in our past that would dampen our fond and
wonderful memories. It is only a question of when are we finally
believed,'' said Ginger Watkins, an original bid committee member
who oversaw all IOC delegates' visits to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Though rival candidate cities found it suspicious that a
first-time bidder could defeat favored Athens and four other cities
for the coveted Centennial Games, none has accused Atlanta of
providing Salt Lake-style payoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They ran a very bold and brassy and slick campaign _ all the
things we did not want to be,'' said Norman Seagram, who was
financial chairman of the Toronto bid committee. ``But they didn't
break any rules.''

   WIDEMAN-RETRIAL (Pittsburgh) _ Robert Wideman's part in a
killing a generation ago might have been forgotten by now, except
by the family of a 24 year old man who was shot in the back on a
November night in 1975. Instead, the crime has become one of the
enduring literary images of black America. It was the subject of an
acclaimed 1984 book, ``Brothers &AMP; Keepers'' by Robert Wideman's
brother, John Edgar Wideman. One brother in the non-fiction work
was the noted author who had escaped the ghetto. The other was the
street tough who embodied the cycle that claims many young black
males. At 25, Robert Wideman was imprisoned for life with no
possibility of parole after an accomplice fired a fatal shot in a
robbery that went wrong. Now, Robert Wideman's case is no longer
alive only in literature. A judge has ordered a new trial, angry
prosecutors are appealing, and a debate has broken out over the
effect of race and fame on justice. By William Glaberson.

   BLACK-DOCTOR (Savannah, Ga.) _ Profile of a black doctor who
works in a neighborhood that like many other poor urban and rural
communities is short of physicians, black or white, and in a wider
community with few black physicians. Nationally, in a population
that is 13 percent black, less than 4 percent of all physicians are
black. In Savannah, which is more than 50 percent black, 30 of 540
physicians are black, or less than 6 percent. Lately, these
disparities have stirred concern among African-American advocates
and historically black medical schools like Morehouse in the face
of waves of new research showing disparities in the health of black
and white Americans. By Peter T. Kilborn.

APPLE AIMS FOR BUSINESS NICHE WITH NEW GE SERIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WENDY TANAKA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Apple Computer Inc's powerful new G3 computers
represent a crucial step for the company into the arena of business
computing.
</P>
<P>
   The G3 design has the same unconventional look as Apple's
enormously popular iMac. But that's where the similarity between
the two computers stops.
</P>
<P>
   The iMac is designed for the home and sells for about $1,200.
The new G3 is aimed at design professionals and ranges in price
from $1,600 to $3,000. It is a much faster version of Apple's
original G3, introduced in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The G3 has up to a gigabyte of memory and 100 gb of internal
disk storage. It also has processor speeds of up to 400 megahertz
and a built-in, high-performance ATI RAGE 128 graphics card. The
G3's minitower flips open so users can add memory, storage or PCI
cards.
</P>
<P>
   Apple said Web site designers, publishing houses, schools and
video editing companies will be some of the main G3 customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a loyal following, and this machine is exactly what
they've been looking for,'' Apple spokesman Russell Brady said.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of the iMac have exceeded industry projections. Since its
launch in August, 800,000 iMacs have been sold _ about 300,000 more
than analysts had projected. And Apple just introduced a newer
version of the iMac, offering slightly more speed and a new array
of colors.
</P>
<P>
   Brady said figures for the new G3, introduced last month,
wouldn't be available until April, when Apple's first-quarter
results are posted.
</P>
<P>
   Technology analysts predicted that the G3 would not be a
barn-burner product like the iMac because Apple missed the boat
several years ago and didn't expand its base of business customers.
As a result, Microsoft Corp.'s Windows NT operating platform
swooped in and has become the dominant business desktop workstation
for producing graphics and three-dimensional visuals.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Specker, an analyst in Soundview Technology Group Inc.'s
San Francisco office, said Apple's failure to penetrate the
business market stems from the ``fundamentally poor decision'' by
former Apple chief executive John Sculley to not license Apple
technology to other vendors.
</P>
<P>
   Dataquest Inc. of San Jose, Calif., estimated about 63 million
Windows NT operating units will be sold in 2001. That is roughly
nine times more than the 7 million NT computers sold in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Brady said 1.6 million older Apple G3 units were sold, and he
said the newer series offers heftier sales potential.
</P>
<P>
   ``People at the high end of Web design and graphics will be
doing back flips over the G3. It's a great install-based extension,
but it won't do anything to get into Microsoft's space,'' said John
Oltsik, an analyst at Forrester Research Inc., a market research
firm in Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Apple die-hards are most likely to purchase the new G3, Specker
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The G3 target market is people with a lot of money who like
Apples,'' he said. ``That's a substantive revenue opportunity.''

THEY COULDN'T FIND THE FACTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and k coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; WASHINGTON _ As plug-pullings go, it has to be the fastest on
record.
</P>
<P>
   What finally set the Senate on a course to tell the House of
Representatives _ as politely as humanly possible _ that its
impeachment case does not deserve to succeed, was not its lopsided
vote to spare Monica Lewinsky the torture of live testimony for no
probitive purpose.
</P>
<P>
   It was a more private judgment _ leadership guided but
membership supported _ to stop an almost comically ill-advised
effort to turn the Senate into the House.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday morning, the impeachment body still twitched; two
hours later it was dead.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, the ``findings of fact'' _ the last gasp of
pure partisanship in a proceeding that cooler heads in the Senate
kept from becoming a full-fledged trial _ were not that at all.
</P>
<P>
   The best that seven designated Republican finders could find
were argumentative conclusions, essentially that President Clinton
was indeed responsible for the conduct alleged in the two
impeachment articles that can now be swept into history's dustbin;
the G word (guilty), the P word (perjury), and the O word
(obstruction) were avoided, but saying that the president
``willfuly'' testified falsely and ``wrongfully,'' and tried to
disrupt lawful court proceedings is a distinction without a
difference.
</P>
<P>
   As such, the seven turned off the only Democratic senator who
had even expressed interest in the idea, Connecticut's Joseph
Lieberman; and they halted any chance of the idea spreading to
others.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, as Democrats from Minority Leader Tom Daschle on down
made clear, they could have been the basis for filibuster by
amendment _ like adding a ``finding'' that Ken Starr's mother wears
combat boots, or that Lucianne Goldberg and Linda Tripp are poor
role models for 21st century women.
</P>
<P>
   But behind all that was the most important fact of all, that
there were as many as 14 Republican senators fully prepared to
oppose findings of anything.
</P>
<P>
   For those counting, that is slightly more than 25 percent of the
GOP membership, meaning that the so-called findings, no matter
their shape or form, never had as much as a prayer of passage.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition, to a person, was principled. A few senators _
Phil Gramm of Texas and Bob Smith of New Hampshire, for example _
tend to oppose anything not specified, or enumerated, in the
Constitution. And the rest _ including moderately conservative
types like Mike DeWine of Ohio, Gordon Smith of Oregon, and Richard
Shelby of Alabama _ opposed any fudging of the explicit
constitutional obligation of the Senate to convict or not convict.
</P>
<P>
   But the evening before the Republicans met, a final straw was
added to the camel's back in the form of a CBS News poll that found
the public viewing the Senate with the same distaste with which it
had viewed the House back in December _ as a den of squabbling,
posturing partisans unable to work together.
</P>
<P>
   The members were already convinced, but the poll hit the big
shots where they live, especially Majority Follower Trent Lott.
</P>
<P>
   An hour before the Senate convened to vote down the subpoena for
Lewinsky (splitting the GOP caucus almost in half), Lott yanked the
plug on the fact-finders, claiming, ``I have felt all along that
really what we ought to do is do what the Constitution and the
rules provide _ go through the impeachment trial, get to the
articles of impeachment, vote on those, and then move on.''
</P>
<P>
   In a pig's eye.
</P>
<P>
   It was Lott himself who had encouraged the original fact-finder,
Senator Susan Collins of Maine, back in December; and it was Lott
two weeks ago who named two other senators to run a seven-person
GOP operation to come up with a draft.
</P>
<P>
   Collins, in particular, was left holding the bag, though she was
hardly in a position to complain.
</P>
<P>
   Coming into the Senate proceedings, she had strongly supported
the calling of witnesses to the floor as the only way information
that could inform a vote could be presented, and she was pushing a
separate procedure to find ``facts'' because of her theory that an
acquittal under the Constitution might send the wrong ``message.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the end she voted against hearing the only requested
witness, and yet she helped draft two findings of ``fact'' claiming
that the president did what he was accused of doing.
</P>
<P>
   The composite of Collins's positions was that she looked like a
pretzel.
</P>
<P>
   The demise of her idea, however, like the demise of live
witnesses, was but a metaphor for the end of impeachment itself.
</P>
<P>
   The trial will limp on to its anticlimactic conclusion this
week, but the real end came Thursday with a genuine jolt.

 ATLANTA: ...any rules.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``We did it the Canadian way and they did it the American way,''
said Paul Henderson, who headed the Toronto committee. ``They set
the standard. But I can't nail Atlanta. They put on a full-court
press and they won. Our position is that we shot ourselves in the
foot. To point fingers or blame something that happened on somebody
else is not our style.''
</P>
<P>
   Mahmoud El Farnawani, an Ontario businessman who was a paid
consultant and lobbyist for cities bidding for the last four
Olympics awarded, told the Toronto Star in 1998 that Atlanta used a
``special way'' to land the 1996 Games. ``This cannot be told
because it would be very damaging,'' El Farnawani said, ``but
everyone around the world knew what was happening.''
</P>
<P>
   El Farnawani, who was paid $160,000 by the Salt Lake committee
to influence IOC members from northern Africa, would not comment on
the Atlanta bid last week, saying the ongoing IOC scandal had left
him ``physically and emotionally drained.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever he heard or saw, it's all innuendo, etc.,'' said
David Goodman, El Farnawani's attorney. ``And I don't think it's in
his interest to comment about it.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Young's `African strategy' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the avalanche of souvenirs, free travel, hotel stays and
five-star meals, there were the unique efforts of Young, the former
UN ambassador and civil rights leader who was Atlanta's mayor from
1981-89. Young developed what might be called an ``African
strategy,'' parlaying his longstanding personal ties there into
votes for his city.
</P>
<P>
   In meetings with each African and Caribbean IOC member, roughly
20 in all at the time, Young stressed that two-thirds of Atlanta
residents were black, making it the only ``African'' city bidding
for the Games that year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Olympics has been transformed from a $700 million deficit
event in 1976 to a $5 billion asset in 1996. I think some poor
Africans ought to have some influence in the way that money is
spent,'' said Young, who is now chairman of Good Works
International, which seeks to create business links between
developed and under-developed countries.
</P>
<P>
   One month before the September 1990 vote, Young went to visit
Jean-Claude Ganga of The Republic of Congo _ one of the IOC members
now facing expulsion over the Salt Lake scandal _ bearing gifts of
soccer balls, basketballs, and athletic clothing. Ganga, among the
most influential African IOC members, switched his support from
Toronto to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Young also organized a training camp for African athletes _ just
as he had done before the 1984 Summer Games in Los Angeles _ at
LaGrange College about an hour southwest of downtown Atlanta. The
camp opened in 1991, after Atlanta had been awarded the 1996 Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our generosity was an attempt to counteract the perception
that the Americans were only interested in the Olympics because it
was big money,'' Young said. ``Everybody who is bidding ought to be
called on to help countries that are less fortunate, and that's
what the Olympic movement stands for.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, an Australian Olympic official has accused
Young of directing US government aid to African nations during the
1996 bid process, but the official, John Coates, has offered no
evidence and named no countries. Young denied the allegation, but
said he would have supported such aid.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's winning bid also gave rise to lingering questions
about the role played by corporate sponsors, including Delta
Airlines, NationsBank, Bell South, Georgia Power, and Home Depot,
among others. Some provided in-kind contributions, such as Delta
airline seats, that Atlanta Olympic officials said were not
included in their $7.8 million spending total.
</P>
<P>
   But the most attention has focused on the role played by
Atlanta-based Coca-Cola, one of the Olympics' oldest and biggest
sponsors, in the surprise defeat of Athens, the sentimental
favorite to host the centennial Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta was considered a long shot because the Summer Games had
been held on United States soil just 12 years earlier, because it
was a first-time bidder, and because Atlanta was associated in the
minds of some IOC members with Ted Turner, the mogul who launched
the Goodwill Games as a competitor to the Olympics, and Jimmy
Carter, who as president ordered the US boycott of the 1980 Summer
Games in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola's local bottler contributed about $300,000 to
Atlanta's bid effort _ in addition to $250 million spent by the
corporation during 1996 on Olympic-related promotions, including
the torch relay. But the parent corporation has a strict policy
against favoring one city over another in Olympic bidding, and
local Coca-Cola bottlers contributed to at least three other cities
that sought the 1996 Games, said Ben Deutsch, spokesman for
worldwide sports at Coca-Cola.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsch said that although Coca-Cola was proud to have the
Olympics in its hometown, the company gained little from its
presence. ``The real opportunity for us as a business is in the 134
other countries where we did marketing promotions in 1996 in terms
of the Olympics,'' Deutsch said. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Olympics still a presence &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Two-and-a-half years after the closing ceremonies of the 1996
Olympics, the Games are still an ever-present memory here. Visitors
are greeted at the airport with a sign welcoming them to Atlanta,
``Home of the Centennial 1996 Olympics.'' Five-ring Olympic flags
still fly, and every day at noon, Centennial Olympic Park downtown
_ scene of the bombing that cast a shadow on the Games _ comes
alive with dancing fountains and blaring music, from the Olympic
theme to Neil Diamond singing ``Coming to America.''
</P>
<P>
   But with the controversy swirling from Salt Lake to IOC
headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland, some local memories have
become tarnished.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Atlanta did a great job getting the Olympics, and they
leveraged it into great benefits for me as an Atlanta resident in
terms of the infrastructure and the venues left behind,'' said
architect Eric Brock, spending his lunch hour at the park last
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm completely jaded in terms of the whole Olympic
organization,'' he added, ``how it operates, how votes get sold,
all of that, and it's embarrassing to think Atlanta had to play by
those rules to get it.''

IMPEACHMENT TAKES ITS TOLL ON THE GOP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT A. JORDAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the impeachment trial of President Clinton approaches its
end, it appears that this episode has been _ and will continue to
be _ far more costly to the Republicans than to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The only casualties to date have been Republicans, including
some of the key leaders of the GOP's assault on the president.
Instead of destroying Clinton as they had hoped, they ended up
destroying themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Among the battlefield casualties are former House Speaker Newt
Gingrich, who was forced to resign after the GOP lost six seats in
November; former Speaker-elect Robert Livingston, who resigned
after published reports of his adulterous history; and, of course,
those who lost their seats in Congress in the last election. Among
them were such Clinton foes as Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato of New
York, who lost his seat to Charles Schumer, and presidential
nemesis Senator Lauch Faircloth of North Carolina, who lost to John
Edwards. In Indiana, the race to succeed another anti-Clinton
incumbent who was retiring from the Senate was won by Evan Bayh, a
Democrat and Clinton defender.
</P>
<P>
   There are also the walking wounded of the impeachment episode.
These include US Representative Henry Hyde, who chaired the House
impeachment drive against Clinton. Hyde may have survived the
publicity about his self-described ``youthful indiscretion'' in
which, at age 46, he was involved in an adulterous affair that cost
a woman her marriage and family. But his unrelenting efforts to
push the Senate toward convicting Clinton apparently did not sit
well with voters in his own district. Recent polls show that Hyde's
negative ratings overshadow his positives in his own district.
</P>
<P>
   Hypocrisy was the weapon that caused some GOP casualties _ such
as when Hustler publisher Larry Flynt had a hand in revealing
Livingston's affairs, and then revealed that one of the impeachment
managers, Georgia Representative Bob Barr had sought and paid for
his wife's (now his ex-wife) abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Barr and Trent Lott, the Senate majority leader, garnered some
public notoriety for their appearances before, and apparent ties
to, the Council of Conservative Citizens, which many critics view
as a racist organization, connected to the Ku Klux Klan and the
White Citizens Council. Both Lott and Barr have tried to distance
themselves from the organization.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the revelation that Tom DeLay, the majority whip and
leader of the House drive for Clinton's removal for ``lying under
oath'' _ had lied under oath in a civil deposition in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   For other Republicans, the damage may be yet to come. For
example, Senator John Chafee of Rhode Island, although a moderate,
has reportedly lost ground with his constituents after siding with
conservative Republicans on key issues during the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Other Republicans may find their support for a controversial
``finding of fact'' against Clinton comes back to haunt them. Faced
with strong Democratic protest, Republicans have abandoned this
thinly-veiled attempt to have Clinton branded a ``criminal'' before
his expected acquittal by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Taken together, all these factors give Democrats _ who have
already gained significant ground in the last two elections _
reason to be optimistic about 2000. Dick Gephardt of Missouri, the
House minority leader who decided just last week not to run for
president, knows that, given voters' anger at Republicans, he has a
good chance of being the next speaker.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the many GOP casualties during independent
counsel Kenneth W. Starr's inquisition against Clinton is because
the party's right-wing went against the electorate. It attempted to
undo the people's election of Clinton by its blatant attempt to
throw him out of office on flimsy charges drawn on his private, if
scandalous, affair with Monica S. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   People made it clear that the these Republicans did not
represent their views, and that, by trying to remove Clinton, they
were negating the wishes of the very voters who chose Clinton in
two successive elections.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, the Republicans attempted a political coup d'etat not
only against Clinton, but against the people who elected him. And
the people judged these Republicans accordingly, as demonstrated in
November.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans say voters will retain only a faint memory of
these events when they go to the polls in two years, but that is
wishful thinking. The voters who elected Clinton sent a strong
message in the last election. Apparently the Republicans just don't
get it. That's why voters are likely to send a stronger, and
simpler, message to the GOP next time: Get out.

WHATEVER HAPPENED TO THE `GAY GENE'? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW BRELIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The research project in 1993 that indicated many gay men shared
a common genetic marker in the X chromosone was hailed as a
momentous scientific discovery _ one that would help transcend
bigotry, heal family wounds and lay to rest a question for the
ages: is sexual orientation genetic?
</P>
<P>
   The idea of a ``gay gene'' offered an ironclad defense of
homosexuality; if it was genetically predetermined, then being gay
could not be cast as ``deviant'' behavior, something that could be
``corrected.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Thanks for the Genes, Mom!'' T-shirts were sold in gay and
lesbian bookstores. Many gay activists and newspaper editorial
writers predicted the discovery would give homosexuals greater
legal standing to fight discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Six years later, however, the gene has still not been found and
interest in _ and enthusiasm for _ the ``gay gene'' research has
waned considerably among both activists and scientists. There is a
growing consensus that sexual orientation is much more complicated
than a matter of genes.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Richard Pillard, a professor of psychiatry at Boston
University School of Medicine who was involved in a study of twins
and sexual orientation, has done research showing that sexuality is
greatly influenced by environment, and that the role of genetics
is, in the end, limited.
</P>
<P>
   According to Pillard's findings, a gay man's fraternal twin had
about a 22 percent chance of being gay; an adopted sibling had a
roughly nine or 10 percent chance; and a person selected by random
draw has a three our four percent liklihood. The message:
environment _ in this case, the environment that adoptive siblings
share _ clearly helps shape sexuality.
</P>
<P>
   Pillard offers a further bit of evidence on the limited
(although still significant) influence of genes: With identical
twins, if genes were everything, you would expect a 100 percent
overlap in sexuality; in other words, if one twin was gay, so, too,
the other. But identical twins shared sexual orientation only 50
percent of the time, he reports, and that statistics for lesbian
women are similar.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Dean Hamer, the National Cancer Institute molecular
biologist who lead the 1993 study (and its validation study in
1995), believes a gay gene does exists and will be found within
five years. But he also acknowledges the limites of genetic
predisposition. For example, he has been unable to find in women
the same genetic marker found in some gay men. ``Clearly,'' he
says, ``there is a lot more than just genes going on.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he says, ``It is the same for every human behavior _
environment matters for extroversion, smoking cigarettes, just
about anything you can name.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is not known,'' he says, ``is what about the environment
is important. And for that, we are just as clueless as we were 100
years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One of the reasons the gay community has cooled to the idea of a
`gay gene' is that a justification of sexuality is no longer seen
as so important. Indeed, a fuller picture of civil rights has
emerged.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our position is that to us it (the gene) may be a scientific
question, but it is not a political one,'' says Kerry Lobel,
executive director of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force.
``Gene or no gene, every person deserves full civil rights under
the law.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is another reason for the second thoughts. Not only is
there plenty of historical precedent to suggest that discovery of a
``gay gene'' would do nothing to ease discrimination against
homosexuals, there is also some reason to think it could make
matters worse.
</P>
<P>
   Consider that James Watson, the Nobel laureate who with Francis
Crick, discovered DNA, said that if the gene was discovered and a
woman decided not to give birth to a child that may have a tendency
to become homosexual, she should be able to abort the fetus.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine, says Lobel, going to the doctor, finding out you have
the gene and then that information is given to your insurance
company. ``Perhaps you are denied benefits,'' she adds. ``Or
perhaps your employer finds out you have the gay gene and you are
fired from your job. Maybe, in a court, you are fighting for
custody of your child and someone says you are a lesbian and you
don't get custody because the court orders a genetic test.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruth Hubbard, a board member of The Council for Responsible
Genetics, a Harvard Univerity biology professor emeritus and author
of ``Exploding the Gene Myth,'' says history is replete with
discrimination for biological reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``For people to feel that because it is biological makes it
unchallengeable and takes people off the hook from right wing
criticism is very short-sighted. Both being Jewish and being black
is considered biological by some people, and it has not stopped
discrimination against either group.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the job is to widen the range of acceptable behaviors
and not to discriminate on the basis of who people choose to love
and live with and not invent biological reasons for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Searching for a ``gay gene,'' says Hubbard, is not even a
worthwhile pursuit. ``Let me be very clear: I don't think there is
any single gene that governs any complex human behavior. There are
genetic components in everything we do and it is foolish to say
genes are not involved, but I don't think they are decisive.''
</P>
<P>
   John D'Emilio, co-author of ``Intimate Matters: a History of
Sexuality in America,'' agrees. ``I don't want to be in a position
to say scientists should not do research, but it is not something
that I would look for.''
</P>
<P>
   And the federal government may not want to look for it either.
Pillard said he sought funding for a study to replicate Hamer's
work and was denied. ``Research in this area has stalled for a
couple of years,'' he says. ``I really think the government is not
interested in fanning the flames of this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   D'Emilio says he is skeptical about a genetic key unlocking
understanding to sexual orientation because of cultural and
historical evidence which points to ``an immense maliability of
human sexuality. In Western society, in the classical world, there
were huge numbers of men who were married and also had ongoing
homosexual relationships.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, despite there being very little evidence for a biological
basis for homosexuality _ one group of Canadian researchers could
not replicate Hamer's findings _ it is something many Americans are
rushing to embrace.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, says D'Emilio, that feeling comes from a
``very noble and generous place. On the one hand, many American
people, I think, would really like to embrace gay people and feel
things that have happened to gay people are wrong. In open
democratic societies people should be accepted for who they are,''
he says. ``Culturally, however, homosexuality makes people
uncomfortable. If people can be persuaded you are born this way,
that you have no choice, it resolves a complicated moral issue.''
</P>
<P>
   But if genetics plays only a supporting role in determining our
sexual orientation, it means there are no easy answers about where
our sexual orientation comes from, only questions about how we
respond.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does not matter to me where it comes from,'' says Lobel.
``Even for people who currently believe that you are born that way,
my colleagues on the right who belive that think the issue is: what
do you do? Act out on your orientation or stifle it? I'd like to
think we live in a world where we want people to have consentual
relationships with each other, but reasonable people disagree.''
</P>
<P>
   Science aside, says D'Emilio, ``We are left with the question,
of `Do we accept people who are sexually different?'''

UMASS IS RICHER THAN EVER, BUT THE TAXPAYER GETS NO RELIEF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When William Bulger became president of the University of
Massachusetts three years ago, the public was unimpressed. In a
Boston Globe poll, only 20 percent thought the vindictive president
of the state Senate, a man with no scholarly credentials and a
deeply etched reputation for not tolerating dissent, ought to be
running a university.
</P>
<P>
   But the muckety-mucks of the UMass system were thrilled. In
Bulger's appointment they beheld dollar signs, and that mattered
more to them than mere scholarship. ``We need somebody who can get
us the money to do what we need to do,'' said the president of the
UMass-Amherst faculty Senate. ``Obviously, he would be helpful . .
. in terms of funding,'' said the governor who appointed him.
Bulger ``will be able to acquire the resources,'' said the trustee
who chaired the presidential search committee.
</P>
<P>
   What they really needed was a director of development, but
Bulger, who craves prestige, would never have considered any
position but the top one. So he got the UMass presidency and the
perks that went with it, including a $189,000 salary _ $107,600
more than he was making as Senate president _ and the
10,500-square-foot office on Tremont Street in downtown Boston.
</P>
<P>
   It was a start, but Bulger wanted more. And whatever Bulger
wants, Bulger usually gets. Which is why his office today is a
marble-foyered palace overlooking the State House, three times the
size of the Tremont Street complex (at nearly six times the rent).
And it is why his salary has risen to $238,000 _ and will soar to
$282,000 next year. At that point, the president of one of the
nation's least distinguished public universities will be drawing
down one of the highest salaries in academe.
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, Bulger is doing the job he was hired to do:
fund-raising. UMass is pulling in dollars almost faster than they
can be counted. Alumni giving has quintupled. Donors eager to bask
in Bulger's glow paid $10,000 and up to reserve a table at his
lavish inaugural in 1997. Overall giving has rocketed from $25
million in 1994 to $62 million last year, a 150 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's done his job unbelievably,'' says the chairman of the
UMass board of trustees, ``and we have an obligation to pay him
what he deserves.'' Not so; the obligation was Bulger's. He was
hired with no relevant experience, and owed it to the trustees to
prove that he deserved to be paid $189,000 a year. Do they _ and
the taxpayers _ really owe Bulger a 49 percent raise merely because
he met his job description?
</P>
<P>
   But then, who really cares about the taxpayers' interest in all
of this? Certainly not Bulger; his tenure on Beacon Hill was one
long picking of the public pocket. Not the trustees, either; one
indication of their regard for the taxpayers who pick up much of
the UMass tab is that they kept Bulger's gluttonous pay hike secret
for months. Not even Governor Cellucci, a one-time fiscal
conservative. Last week, as he promoted his elephantine $20.4
billion budget, the governor let it be known that Bulger's bonanza
was OK by him.
</P>
<P>
   What was not OK by him was the trustees' vote to increase the
price of a UMass education by an average of 1.4 percent in the
coming year. The actual effect on student bills would be minimal.
The largest increase any UMass student would face is $175 (at the
Boston campus), while some students would actually enjoy a $2
decrease (at UMass-Lowell). But Cellucci was outraged. ``We should
be committed to lowering the cost,'' he said. ``To do that, you
have to lower tuition and fees.''
</P>
<P>
   Terminology is important here. When tuition and fees at a state
school go down, the taxpayer's cost goes up. UMass students are
heavily subsidized by the working men and women of Massachusetts,
who will lay out nearly $450 million next year so those students
can attend college on the cheap. Even after the slight fee
increase, a year at UMass-Amherst _ tuition, fees, room, board _
will cost just $10,097. That is a terrific bargain, as anyone
wrestling with the cost of a private college well knows.
</P>
<P>
   Why should a taxpayer struggling to put a child through
Northeastern or Boston University also be forced to help put 48,000
students through the University of Massachusetts? It isn't as if
everyone who goes to Northeastern and BU is wealthy, while plenty
of students whose families are wealthy attend UMass. Students at
UMass enjoy a highly lucrative form of middle-class welfare. That
may be tolerable in a state where the vast majority of college
students are educated by the state. But in Massachusetts, where
three out of five students attend independent colleges and
universities, it raises questions of basic equity.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of questions, here's another. Cellucci's budget for the
upcoming fiscal year increases the UMass appropriation by $20.4
million. By what logic does a university that can raise huge sums
from private donors need a larger state subsidy? With Bulger at the
helm, contributions are pouring in as they never have before.
Increasingly, UMass can stand on its own. Shouldn't the taxpayers
be allowed to reduce their level of support?
</P>
<P>
   Well, somebody else will have to think about those questions;
Paul Cellucci is busy pandering to the UMass lobby. ``I am very
upset that the board apparently has decided to raise the fees,'' he
fumed last week. That is another way of saying: I am very upset
that the taxpayers of Massachusetts might get a bit of relief.

OSCAR HIJUELOS' HEROINE IS A WOMAN IN FULL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GAIL CALDWELL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
EMPRESS OF THE SPLENDID SEASON 
By Oscar Hijuelos. HarperFlamingo. 342 pp. $25. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Oscar Hijuelos's voice is so distinctive you might recognize it
from a grocery list. Tucked among the oranges and chicken and milk
would come the telling Hijuelos instruction: ``And don't forget the
mangoes for Mrs. Diaz's birthday party.'' Formal and intimate at
once, his tone evokes emotional revelations simply by the respect
he shows his subjects. In capturing a life _ one woman's weary
afternoon, say, or a young man's memory of a first love _ Hijuelos
manages to convey the ultimate kindness by cloaking everything he
writes in dignity.
</P>
<P>
   This quiet precision in Hijuelos's work is often camouflaged by
the flashier aspects of his novels: the gorgeous realism of ``The
Mambo Kings Play Songs of Love,'' the flood of sensuality in ``The
Fourteen Sisters of Emilio Montez O'Brien,'' the somber force of
``Mr. Ives' Christmas.'' In ``Empress of the Splendid Season,'' the
empress herself _ one carefully realized Lydia Espana, a
Cuban-American housekeeper in New York _ sometimes overshadows the
hand who has drawn her. This is a novel about class: about the
cruel absurdities of the American dream and the grim realities that
belong to the hostages it takes. But this larger theme appears only
through the bittersweet accumulation of Lydia's life, lived inch by
inch, day by day, with a splendor that owes far more to endurance
than to victory.
</P>
<P>
   One of the virtues of Lydia as a character is that she is never
romanticized, or made to seem noble merely by the fact of her
poverty. Preferring to think of herself as ``upper lower class,''
she's considered a snob by some of her peers and a mystery by her
children. But Lydia partly survives her quotidian life by escaping
it, and this often means the fanciful notions and wistful
superiority offered by pop culture as a way out. If, while she
dusts, Lydia daydreams about her privileged life as a wealthy young
girl in Cuba, or believes that a Hollywood star has smiled at her
on a Manhattan streetcorner, such pretensions are simply part of
her fight-back fantasy. Stripped of illusion, no life is bearable
all the time.
</P>
<P>
   The beautiful, self-centered daughter of a small-town mayor in
pre-Castro Cuba, Lydia was banished from the family by her father
when she spent the night with a near-stranger. It was 1947, she was
22 and disgraced, and she emigrated to New York _ the starting-over
point for millions of Americans. Two years later, at a dance in the
Bronx, she met the reserved and decent man she would marry. A
waiter who was 10 years older than Lydia, Raul adored her _ and
wrote her a poem describing his feelings, ``like the morning sun on
the most glorious day / of the most beautiful and splendid
season.'' To Raul, she was an empress whose title could never be
taken away.
</P>
<P>
   This man with a strong work ethic and a weak heart, as Lydia
comes to think of him, drops his laden tray one night at work a few
years later, suffering the first of several heart attacks that will
dictate the rest of his life. By now the mother of two young
children, Rico and Alicia, Lydia begins cleaning houses to support
the family _ an occupation that promises exhausting work as well as
solitude, a modicum of independence, and occasionally a day's worth
of voyeuristic distraction. Carrying her gentility with her like a
sword into her job interviews, Lydia gains servant's entrance into
some of the finest apartments in Manhattan. What she glimpses there
over the years, of course, has everything to do with material
splendor and entitlement _ the silent whoosh of doors opening
everywhere _ but little to do with that most elusive of qualities,
happiness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Empress of the Splendid Season'' unfolds with straightforward
chronology, following Lydia through some three decades of
servitude, suggesting the bitter disaffection she's prone to as
well as the deep sustenance of her friends and family. This
and-then-and-then approach can be off-putting: Hijuelos has a
tendency toward the warm-for-its-own-sake vignette, and then the
course of the novel can seem more anecdotal than deliberate. But
the failing is transient. By the end of Lydia's fictional arc, her
years of work and children _ of joys merged with disappointments _
comes to feel like the hard-earned life it is: a testament to
getting through.
</P>
<P>
   The strength of this novel, though, owes less to plot than to
the humanity of its narrator. Bestowing his Lydia with a
detachment, even numbness, that will plague her relations with her
children (and also infect them), Hijuelos underscores the emotional
burdens of poverty without ever having to name them. Hints of this
discord appear from the outset, particularly with Rico, and it is
his chance at a ``better'' life that the reader begins to cling to
_ unconsciously, we are made to understand the ultimate immigrant
experience. Other people come and go through Lydia's working life _
the wealthy, kind-hearted Mr. Osprey, who cares for her and her
family with a perfectly crafted sense of nobless oblige; his cook,
Mr. Chang _ and yet it is always the one searing detail that
suggests the life in miniature. What we remember of Lydia and
Raul's apartment is the window that for years has gone unwashed
because of the bars protecting it. And what we learn about Lydia's
hopes and dreams has to do with the investments she makes when a
real windfall comes her way: a microwave oven, a subscription to
Readers Digest, and a thousand-dollar donation to the local church.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard not to love Lydia Espana by the end of her season,
splendid, at least, within the caring province of Hijuelos's
imagination. More determined than noble, Lydia is noble because of
her determination _ and a constant reminder that poverty itself has
no grand design, not when it comes to choosing victims.

GEORGE CARLIN: YOU ARE ALL DISEASED 
Directed by: Rocco Urbisci 
Produced by: Kimber Rikabaugh 
On: HBO, Saturday, throughout February 
Rating: TV-MA (adult content, adult language) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As a general rule, comedians grow more conservative as they grow
older. Robert Klein still does material from his album ``Child of
the '50s,'' and the Smothers Brothers' political satire of the '60s
has evolved into a rather timid sibling rivalry.
</P>
<P>
   Not Carlin. In his 11th HBO special, the gray-haired, wild-eyed
stand-up philosopher raves on. In the live cablecast of his latest
special, `George Carlin: You Are All Diseased,'' Carlin stalks the
audience. Using logic as his primary weapon, Carlin rationally and
hilariously rips and claws his way through America's conventional
wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, as Carlin might observe, if it's conventional, it
can't be wise.
</P>
<P>
   ``If honesty were introduced, this country would collapse,'' he
says. That observation may not be that funny, but it's true. And
the same could be said for ``You Are All Diseased.''
</P>
<P>
   Be forewarned, this is not the sweet Mr. Carlin who plays the
pleasant Mr. Conductor on PBS's ``Shining Time Station.'' This is
the lunatic Mr. Carlin who'll stop at nothing to cut through the
brainless cultural morass exemplified by incessant reruns of
``Little House on the Prairie'' and idiotic advertising slogans.
Carlin despises convention and hypocrisy. And, if it takes
profanity to cut through audience complacency, so be it.
</P>
<P>
   His thinning gray hair pulled back, giving him a manelike
appearance that reinforced his predatory nature, Carlin tore
through America's consumer culture, dependence on mainstream
religion, and treatment of children. He took no prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   Jabbing and cutting and weaving across the faux New York rooftop
set like a shadowboxer, Carlin didn't settle for belly laughs. This
was head-to-head combat.
</P>
<P>
   He took on the myth of airport security, a setup he said that's
``only there to make white people feel good'' and suggested we
begin to see terrorism as entertainment. Carlin lampooned our mad
rush to stay healthy, concluding with the ultimate absurdity that
on death row they wipe your arm with a cotton swab before
administering a lethal injection.
</P>
<P>
   A recitation of Carlin's masterful observations doesn't do them
justice. They must be administered by the man himself as he spits
out a venom of undeniable logic and humor.
</P>
<P>
   And, while he castigates religion, his delivery owes more to
Elmer Gantry than to Bertrand Russell. In fact, if MTV had any
imagination, they'd promote a Celebrity Death Match between Carlin
and Jerry Falwell.
</P>
<P>
   For those who might object to the dozens of words and
expressions not often heard on television: you're missing the
point. The way Carlin sees it, we are a nation asleep _ lulled into
somnolence. To cut through generations of cultural conditioning,
Carlin hauls out the heavy artillery.
</P>
<P>
   This is double-barreled comedy that goes back to the form's
earliest roots _ to poke fun of the rich and powerful. There are no
real jokes. Just a real joker, a guy who brings an uncomfortable
smile to our faces.

WHY NOT ME? 
The Inside Story of the Making and Unmaking of the Franken
Presidency 
By Al Franken 
Delacorte Press, 289 pp., $23.95 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Al Franken used to be a pretty funny comedian.
</P>
<P>
   We got to know him as an adjunct cast member on ``Saturday Night
Live'' who combined great wit with good ideas: the Al Franken
decade, the reporter who wore a satellite dish on his head, and
Stuart Smalley.
</P>
<P>
   But Franken apparently craves more. In addition to his
once-promising sitcom ``Lateline,'' he has taken a second swipe at
Meaningful Political Commentary with ``Why Not Me?,'' the story of
his successful campaign for the presidency in 2000. It is an absurd
conceit, but he makes a case that he can dissemble, lie, and
philander as well as anyone else in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Before any serious candidate can enter the presidential fray, he
or she must issue the personal manifesto, and it is with his,
``Daring To Lead,'' that Franken begins. It makes the usual stops:
</P>
<P>
   --Why he's running: He saw other recent candidates: Lamar
Alexander, Ross Perot, Alan Keyes, and ``tire king Morry Taylor.
When I looked at them I said to myself, `Hey, I can do that!' ''
</P>
<P>
   --His family values: He and wife Franni ``fell in love, blah,
blah, blah,'' and he credits her for views on the sanctity of
marriage ``that I now share in principle.''
</P>
<P>
   --What kind of campaign he'll conduct: After eviscerating the
presumed frontrunner, Al Gore, on all grounds except substance
(concluding with, ``Also, Tipper's no prize''), he assures America
that engaging in personal attacks is not the `` `Franken style.' I
wish I could say that personal attacks are also not a part of the
`Gore style,' but like many Americans, I believe Gore to be willing
to do anything, no matter how dishonest or illegal, to get
elected.''
</P>
<P>
   Having defined himself, Franken moves on to the campaign proper,
which he relates through a series of press releases, TV talk-show
transcripts, and a campaign diary that turns out to have been a
really bad idea. He begins his pursuit, as any serious candidate
does, by returning to his boyhood home, in this case Christhaven,
Minn., where it wasn't easy growing up Jewish. He lays out his
entire platform in one plank: lower ATM fees. It's silly, but not
entirely so _ especially when Y2K turns out to be a bust, except
for automated tellers.
</P>
<P>
   The candidate then heads to New Hampshire, but encounters little
success until he departs again, leaving Franni to stump for him.
Days later he tells his diary: Her ``strategy of listening to
people's problems and promising to do something about them seems to
be working. Food for thought.''
</P>
<P>
   Along the trail, Franken takes every opportunity to mock almost
every media figure (he describes Sam Donaldson, for example, as
``almost unimaginably cruel'' and a ``toupeed blowhard'') and every
media cliche, as when he's a winner in the expectations game
(meaning he's not doing that well but is doing better than pundits
expected).
</P>
<P>
   When financing the campaign becomes a problem,
ubiquitous-policy-wonk-turned-Franken-campaign-manager Norman
Ornstein recruits a well-heeled pal who feels strongly that
insurance companies should be allowed to compete with banks.
Suddenly, Franken is offered $650,000 by the Actuarial Tables Press
of Hartford for publishing rights to ``Daring To Lead.'' The
``downside is that there will be no royalties from sales because
they are not planning to `sell' it, exactly,'' he reports.
</P>
<P>
   For Franken, the fun is in getting to the White House, not
staying there. In his first 100 days, he names an all-Jewish
Cabinet (secretary of the interior: Ralph Lauren), goes bipolar and
barricades himself in the family quarters, and punches Nelson
Mandela in the stomach.
</P>
<P>
   It's funny stuff; the problem is that's all it is. Franken has
done little more than gather together facts already well in
evidence; he has neither revealed nor enlightened nor added to the
public debate.
</P>
<P>
   The best satirists hold up a measuring stick to society; Franken
has delivered mere shtick.

THE TRAUMAS OF BONDAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
RITUALS OF BLOOD 
Consequences of Slavery 
in Two American Centuries 
By Orlando Patterson. Civitas/Counterpoint. 330 pp. 
Illustrated. $29.50. 
 
NO EQUAL JUSTICE 
Race and Class in the American 
Criminal Justice System 
By David Cole. New Press. 218 pp. $25. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In our 350-year conversation about color, power, rights, and
justice in this country, we find consensus on some points and deep
disagreement on others. There is no real doubt that Americans of
African ancestry have made great strides in legal and social
justice, in education, and in economic security in the last 150
years, especially in the last 50. Nor is there doubt, even so, that
as a whole they still have greater ills than Americans of European
background. They are more likely to be poor, inadequately trained
and educated, unemployed, stuck in dangerous neighborhoods; more
likely to be victims of crime and to be incarcerated; and their
life expectancy is lower.
</P>
<P>
   Consensus evaporates, however, over the question of why things
are as they are and what to do about them, and also over who should
take responsibility for which problems. These two books _ Harvard
sociologist Orlando Patterson's rigorously scholarly and
brilliantly written ``Rituals of Blood'' and law professor David
Cole's clear and eloquent ``No Equal Justice'' _ approach different
problems with different answers.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando Patterson is a fearless analyst who hasn't received as
much attention as some other writers about race, perhaps because he
is so independent and individual in his thinking. Born in Jamaica
and educated in Britain, he has written several seminal books,
including ``The Ordeal of Integration'' and ``Freedom in the Making
of Western Culture,'' which won the 1991 National Book Award, as
well as three novels.
</P>
<P>
   This new book consists of three essays. The second, ``Feast of
Blood,'' argues that the grisly history of Southern lynching in the
Jim Crow era should be understood as a system of communal blood
sacrifice consistent with Christian sacramental psychology. The
third, ``American Dionysius,'' deplores the exaltation of
often-mysogynistic sports and entertainment heroes, and the
crowding out of quality culture (such as jazz) by the hip-hop
culture among African-American males. The heart of the book,
though, is the first essay, ``Broken Bloodlines,'' which surveys
and analyzes demographic and survey data with provocative
conclusions about African-American life.
</P>
<P>
   For Patterson, one of the most corrosive and least acknowledged
conflicts affecting Afro-Americans (he rejects ``white'' and
``black'' because of their value associations, and dislikes
``African-American'' because it lays too much stress on Africa and
not enough on America) is not between them and ``Euro-Americans''
but between African-American men and women. Dismissing the idea of
the `` 'hood'' _ informal community bonds in African-American
communities _ Patterson writes, ``There are no ` 'hoods' out there.
. . . the simple, sad truth is that Afro-Amerians are today the
loneliest of all Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   Patterson finds that ``Afro-Americans have the lowest rate of
marriage in the nation, and those who do get married have the
highest rate of divorce of any major ethnic group. . . . The result
is that most Afro-Americans, especially women, will go through most
of their adult lives as single people.''
</P>
<P>
   In his own and others' studies, Patterson finds significant
contrasts between African-American men and women in their attitudes
toward relationship and family. Women give higher importance to
security and stability in marriage, while men place the emphasis on
emotional satisfaction. Women believe in a more shared power
arrangement in marriage, while men are more likely to believe that
the husband should have final say in the home.
</P>
<P>
   While attitudes toward marital infidelity are not permissive
among the majority for either sex, men are much more likely to view
it as tolerable _ for themselves, though not for their women _ and
the rates of infidelity among men are relatively high (as reported
to researchers in a University of Chicago survey that Patterson
calls ``the best and most representative'' study). Patterson
believes that enormous damage is done to marital (and therefore
social) stability by this attitudinal difference, and by other
attitudes and behaviors that studies disclose among many
Afro-American men _ especially lack of responsibility to, and
abandonment of, children.
</P>
<P>
   All of this is volatile stuff, but Patterson believes it must be
talked about and faced within the African-American community. He
attributes these problems not primarily to present-day poverty or
discrimination (though he assuredly does not minimize their
effects) but to the legacy of slavery. We are only a few
generations removed from slavery, he points out, and it existed for
centuries. The essential psychological underpinning of it was the
encouragement of reproduction, coupled with the extinction of
masculinity and of the idea of responsibility among male slaves. He
writes that ``slavery and the slave master decimated the roles of
father and husband and indeed all other significant male roles _
which, by their very nature, were preoccupied with the power and
authority of officeholding, and with honor, status, and dignity. .
. .
</P>
<P>
   ``Afro-Americans, and American society at large (like
Afro-Caribbean and Afro-Latin societies), are still living with the
devastating consequences of this male attitude toward reproduction.
In all of these ex-slave societies, male descendants of slaves
believe that `birth control is a plot to kill the Negro race.' And
in all of them, men bear children whom they have no resources to
support and whom they, in the majority of cases among the lower
classes, simply abandon.''
</P>
<P>
   It should not surprise us, as Patterson sees it, that these
attitudes would be transmitted from one generation to the next, so
that boys and girls learn them from their fathers or other adult
males they know.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Patterson writes that the dominant Euro-American
culture, over the long history of racism since slavery, tended to
reinforce this cultural legacy. Yet he does not pass off the
responsibility for remedying the situation wholly to the world
outside the community. ``Stable co-parenting,'' he writes sternly,
``will not be possible under the present sexual code and behavior
of Afro-American men. . . . The problem and the solution are
overwhelmingly in the hands of Afro-American men. They must
radically alter their ways. . . . This is not a moral plea. It is a
sociological imperative if Afro-Americans hope to have the remotest
chance of ever catching up socioeconomically with other
Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   Changes in attitude among black men are not the solution for the
racial divide in criminal justice, according to David Cole's short
and well-argued book, ``No Equal Justice.'' ``The per capita
incarceration rate among blacks is seven times that among whites,''
he writes. ``African-Americans make up about 12 percent of the
general population, but more than half the prison population. They
serve longer sentences, have higher arrest and conviction rates,
face higher bail amounts, and are more often the victims of police
use of deadly force. . . . If incarceration rates continue their
current trends, one in four young black males born today will serve
time in prison during his lifetime.''
</P>
<P>
   Cole, who teaches at Georgetown University, contends that
unequal treatment throughout the legal system is not just
accidental, but an essential part of the system: ``The rhetoric of
the criminal justice system sends the message that our society
carefully protects everyone's constitutional rights, but in
practice the rules assure that law enforcement prerogatives will
generally prevail over the rights of minorities and the poor.'' He
gives as an example the much more severe sentences, mandated by
Congress, for possession of crack than for powdered cocaine; crack
is far more popular than powder among African-American drug users.
</P>
<P>
   Cole's solutions involve more than changes of heart: He
prescribes more stringent rules governing police searches and
detainments, a more race-sensitive process of jury selection,
provision of counsel at more points along the way in the criminal
system, and community policing. He also advocates strengthening
neighborhood social organizations and striving harder to fight
truancy and improve schools. Probably most difficult to implement
would be his idea of cutting incarceration rates by using
``reintegrative shaming'' penalties _ a kind of de-facto pillory
within the offended community.
</P>
<P>
   Both these books, different as they are in their approaches and
solutions, remind us how deep-seated and tenacious are the
challenges facing African-Americans. And however and by whomever
the problems are addressed, there can be no doubt that
African-Americans' problems are all Americans' problems.

A 26-SONG VALENTINE FROM QUINCY JONES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Record producer, raconteur, and Renaissance man Quincy Jones has
survived long enough to be able to say: ``In our day, we didn't
give a darn about money or fame. We just wanted to be as good as
Miles Davis and Dizzy Gillespie _ and those guys were always broke.
That wasn't what it was about. It wasn't about jet planes and
million-dollar tours back then.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones has since acquired the money and fame, but still has the
soul of a struggling artist who keeps looking ahead. He's never
satisfied, despite towering over not one but many fields. He has
produced the top-selling single of all time (``We Are the World'')
and the top-selling album (Michael Jackson's ``Thriller'').
</P>
<P>
   Jones, 65, also heads a publishing empire that includes Spin
magazine, Vibe, and Blaze, a hip-hop periodical. He has a label
(Qwest Records) and a broadcast company (Qwest Broadcasting) that
owns several TV stations. He has executive-produced the Academy
Awards and coproduced Steven Spielberg's film of Alice Walker's
``The Color Purple,'' plus the hit TV series ``The Fresh Prince of
Bel Air.'' He's working on a musical about Sammy Davis for
Broadway. And he just financed Encarta Africana, a CD-ROM history
of African and African-American culture developed by Henry Louis
Gates Jr. at Harvard University.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just go for things that really move me,'' Jones says from
his home in Los Angeles. ``If you get goose bumps yourself, then
somebody else is going to respond, too.''
</P>
<P>
   But nothing gets Jones more animated than discussing the many
acts he has produced in the studio. More memories are sparked by
the two-CD ``From Q, With Love,'' due this Tuesday, just in time
for Valentine's Day. It compiles 26 love songs that Jones has
produced in the last 40 years _ from the likes of Sinatra, Aretha
Franklin, Barry White, Jackson, and Luther Vandross, to young stars
Tamia, Tevin Campbell, and Brandy. And it has four new tracks by
Patti Austin, El DeBarge, Siedah Garrett, and Cotero.
</P>
<P>
   A tape of the new album's songs was originally made for Jones's
own enjoyment, then as a gift to friend and talk-show host Oprah
Winfrey on her 40th birthday. ``I love Oprah and wanted to share
something with her. So I had this printed up and her picture put on
the front with a warm dedication. Then her friends said, `I'd like
to get some of these.' So, after a while, everybody started
pressuring me to put it out.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   His '80s peak
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Three Jackson songs pop up from his '80s peak, including
``Liberian Girl,'' ``Human Nature,'' and ``The Lady in My Life.''
What was Jackson like in the studio? ``He was a hard worker, a
really hard worker. He would stand there until he got it right,''
says Jones, adding that Jackson also liked to have a small stage
built into the studio. ``He likes to perform with the lights out
and just a single light on the stand. And he likes to do some of
his dances during songs.''
</P>
<P>
   And here's some trivia: The nickname Jones gave Jackson was
``Smelly,'' an abbreviation of Jackson's phrase ``smelly jelly,''
which was his way of saying something was funky.
</P>
<P>
   When it came to recording the love song ``The Lady in My Life''
(on the new CD), Jones recalls, ``On this one I needed Michael to
express an emotion that goes way, way back. I said, `Smelly, I need
you to beg on this. I want a serious beg on this one, which is
convincing the lady that this is the way that she should go.
(Singer) Donny Hathaway was a master of that; and so was Marvin
Gaye. Michael knew exactly what I was talking about. He got all
embarrassed and started to blush. . . . But he did it and then he
ran out of there.''
</P>
<P>
   The quickest artist in the studio, Jones says, was Sinatra,
whose ``Shadow of a Smile'' is featured on the new double CD.
``Working with Sinatra was like a riding a rocket. After the first
time through a song, Frank would say, `That's it.' He was so fast,
it was unbelievable. Later on, when we did other albums, I'd have
to have the whole band rehearsed two sessions before he got it,
because he'd get a good take before they did. You'd have to really
catch him fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frank was also very inclusive. He let me be part of his
family,'' says Jones. ``And I remember going to Hofstra
(University, in New York) last year, where they had a big academic
thing on Sinatra. He would have hated that, man. There were all
these panels talking about every aspect of his life. He'd have been
in the saloon in two minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Praise for Aretha
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As for other artists, Jones says Aretha Franklin was a ``real
pro, an absolute pro.'' And for comic relief, there was nothing
like sessions with Patti Austin and Siedah Garrett. ``You'd end up
with three hours of laughing your butt off, but that's important
too.''
</P>
<P>
   Strangely, in these days of ubiquitous home studios, Jones
doesn't have one and vastly prefers regular outside studios.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never wanted a studio in my home,'' he says. ``A lot of
people have it, but I think a studio is a very sacred place. And I
don't want to be wandering around in my underwear at 3 o'clock in
the morning in there. That's not very sacred.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones's 50-plus years in the business will be described in an
upcoming autobiography (penned with the help of James McBride, a
former reporter who wrote the bestseller ``The Color of Water'').
There are many stories to tell, especially when you realize that
Jones knew jazzmen from Duke Ellington to Charlie Parker. He also
knew Ray Charles as a teenager and first met Jackson, Franklin, and
Stevie Wonder when they were all just 12 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Forget about retirement, however. ``I've seen what happens to
guys when they retire. They just dry up,'' says Jones. ``But I feel
like I'm just starting now. I really do.''

ON THE ROAD FOR `RUSHMORE'

<P>
   BOSTON _ Wes Anderson does not fly.
</P>
<P>
   This was the explanation for the big yellow tour bus parked
recently in front of Boston University's student union building on
a gray, snowy January morning. It was also the reason Anderson
looked like an extra from ``Night of the Living Dead'' _ his eyes
at half-mast, and his body slouched on a hideously upholstered
couch of sorts in the back of the aforementioned bus, one of those
cushy, fully equipped 45-foot things frequented by rock bands and
John Madden.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, and Jason Schwartzman, star of Anderson's offbeat
comedy ``Rushmore,'' arrived in Boston at 6 a.m. after a five-hour
drive from New York fraught with black ice, cops with radar guns,
and precious little sleep. The cross-country bus tour, which began
in Los Angeles Jan. 21 and was scheduled for 11 cities, was
arranged by Disney, parent company of Touchstone Pictures, the
distributor of ``Rushmore.'' Sitting across from Anderson,
Schwartzman was considerably more animated, still stoked from an
appearance on ``The Late Show with David Letterman.'' And he
certainly wasn't too fried to take a jovial poke at Anderson's fear
of the unfriendly skies.
</P>
<P>
   ``So,'' said Schwartzman, smirking at his weary director and
fellow road warrior. ``Do you think you wanna fly now?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like to fly,'' Anderson reiterated. ``Hey, it was
really nice of them to set this whole thing up _ I mean, they've
been really helpful. But none of us realized what it would be like
out here. It's long and lonely.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, this is what one must do when one's film is regarded as
one of the year's best. Spin magazine anointed ``Rushmore'' ``the
best comedy of the year,'' a phrase that, just in case anyone
missed it, is emblazoned on the back of the tour bus. Already, Bill
Murray, who also stars in the film, has picked up a fistful of
critics' awards and has had his name bandied about as a possible
Academy Award nominee.
</P>
<P>
   The film, which opened Friday &UR;  &LR; (Feb. 5), stars Schwartzman as
Max Fischer, a sophomore at prestigious Rushmore Academy who
becomes involved in a would-be love triangle with his 50-year-old
mentor, billionaire Herman Blume (Murray), and a young teacher,
Rosemary Cross (Olivia Williams). It all erupts into an unholy war
of revenge in which no ten-speed bike or Rolls-Royce is sacred. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Where the boys are &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, 28, wrote ``Rushmore'' with Owen Wilson, who also
cowrote and starred in Anderson's 1996 debut, the well-received
``Bottle Rocket.'' Both knew they wanted to do a film set in an
elite boys' school, not unlike St. John's School in Houston _
Anderson's alma mater, and the stand-in for the fictional Rushmore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really enjoyed the school. I didn't do very well in it, but
I enjoyed it as a place to go and work,'' said the lanky,
bespectacled Anderson. ``So I thought it would be a nice place to
do a movie set in the school with this nice atmosphere. The movie
really doesn't have anything to do with school in the end, but we
knew that would be the setting. One of the things that was most
appealing to us was the initial idea of a 15-year-old kid and a
50-year-old man becoming friends and equals.''
</P>
<P>
   And the perfect character for such a setting is the singular Max
Fischer, who is unlike any other teenage boy portrayed in recent
films.
</P>
<P>
   With his glasses, braces, dopey haircut, and high-water,
impossibly wrinkled khakis, Max looks the quintessential nerd, the
kind of geeky guy on whom bullies can practice their wedgie skills.
But looks are deceiving. Max is droll and smart and popular, even a
big man on campus. He's involved in a host of extracurricular
activities _ so many, in fact, he's on the verge of flunking out of
school _ from beekeeping to the French Club to the wrestling team.
He even founded the school's dramatic group, the Max Fischer
Players, for whom he writes edgy plays drawing on such influences
as ``Serpico'' and ``Apocalypse Now.'' As a second-grader, he was
admitted to the school on the strength of a one-act play based on
Watergate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Max isn't a geek. He's cool in his own world, and where he is
is fine,'' Schwartzman said. ``He's not out of time, because he's
not in any time.''
</P>
<P>
   Between 1,500 and 1,800 young actors auditioned for the role of
Max. When Anderson was asked what he looking for, Schwartzman
chimed in, ``Not me.''
</P>
<P>
   Schwartzman, 17, has always wanted to act, feeling ``cosmically
drawn to it.'' That shouldn't be a surprise _ his mother is actress
Talia Shire, best known for her work in the ``Godfather'' and
``Rocky'' films, and his uncle is director Francis Ford Coppola. A
native of Los Angeles, Schwartzman auditioned for lots of roles,
including Tom Hanks's matchmaking son in ``Sleepless in Seattle,''
but he always came up empty. &QL; 
 &QL; 
More Hoffman than Jagger &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Then he attended a dinner party where one of the guests was a
``Rushmore'' casting director.
</P>
<P>
   ``She saw me, started talking to me, and said, `You look like
you could be great for this part in this movie.' I said, `Great,
send me the script.' I thought it was all a joke my brothers were
playing on me. It was a family dinner, so I thought it was like,
`Hey, let's make him think he's being cast in a movie.' ''
</P>
<P>
   It was no joke. Three days later, Schwartzman received the
script. ``I rehearsed all week long, I auditioned for Wes, and it
worked. It worked.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Physically I was picturing Mick Jagger at age 15,'' said
Anderson in describing an actor to play Max. Schwartzman took that
as a cue to strike his best Jagger-esque poses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jason came in, and was nothing like Mick Jagger, but he
reminded me much more of a Dustin Hoffman type,'' Anderson
continued. ``And I started thinking, `Well, that's a way we can do
this.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Think of Hoffman in his star-making role as Benjamin Braddock in
``The Graduate,'' if Braddock had grown up listening to Nirvana's
``Nevermind,'' watching ``South Park,'' and reading The Economist.
</P>
<P>
   Schwartzman has the slouchy, thick-browed looks of Oasis's Liam
Gallagher, and more than his share of snarky wanker whimsy. And,
like Gallagher, Schwartzman is in a band, Phantom Planet, which
released its debut album, ``Phantom Planet Is Missing,'' last year.
For four years, he's been the band's drummer. On the Web site for
Geffen Records, the band's label, Schwartzman's star turn in
``Rushmore'' is mentioned, and there's even a link to the film's
Internet site. For his part, Schwartzman is more reluctant about
cross-promoting his film and band.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a strange thing. As much as I want to plug my band, my
band wouldn't be too happy if I was plugging `Rushmore' during my
band stuff,'' he said. ``That's the way I see it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys in the band are OK with this, but obviously they're a
bit freaked out by it all,'' he said. ``And obviously every time
I'm doing `Rushmore,' I can't be doing Phantom Planet. But they're
happy for me. They wanted to see me do this.''
</P>
<P>
   Schwartzman wants to get back to his band, but is enjoying the
fruits of his first acting gig, such as his Letterman appearance,
which he described as ``freaky and amazing.'' He will again work
with Anderson, on the writer-director's next film, a comedy about a
family of geniuses set in New York.
</P>
<P>
   No word yet on whether that publicity tour will duplicate this
on-the-road-again odyssey set to wind up in Denver Feb. 9 _ if
Anderson can hold out that long. The bus, Schwartzman said, ``is
like a vampire.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If this gets people to go see `Rushmore,' then it's all worth
it. That's why we're doing this, and that's what's important,''
Anderson said, as he stifled a yawn. ``It's been kind of fun, but
I'm really exhausted.''

THE TRUTH IS OUT THERE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ED SIEGEL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the media and political swirl around Bill Clinton and Monica
Lewinsky turned into a maelstrom last year, writer Tim O'Brien
noted, ``It's as if `The Scarlet Letter' had never been written.''
Indeed, the same issues that Nathaniel Hawthorne dealt with in his
19th-century novel are being hashed over today in both the
political and the cultural dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   The political clash is being played out in Congress, with the
Republicans assuming the role of Puritan prosecutors. But they have
been helped along for the past year by the media, which for the
most part posited l'affaire Lewinsky as a simple matter of good and
evil, truth and lies, at least until the populace revolted by
supporting Clinton. The cultural clash extends throughout the arts
_ witness the National Endowment for the Arts controversy and
Republican antipathy for any modern art that smacks of, well,
modernism. But perhaps it's most instructive to look at
contemporary movies and television shows over the last few years,
specifically at the growing acceptance in film for more complex
moral landscapes.
</P>
<P>
   The Hollywood film has long been the bastion of unambiguous
moral dichotomies. From ``The Ten Commandments'' to ``Forrest
Gump,'' life is presented as a matter of good and evil, truth and
lies. These films give their viewers a sense of easy transcendence,
as Mark Edmundson calls it in his book, ``Nightmare on Main
Street.''
</P>
<P>
   The past five years, though, have seen the rise of the
independent film, which presents, almost across the board, a more
complicated moral universe and a less secure sense of truth. Movies
as diverse as ``Hilary and Jackie,'' ``Affliction,'' ``The Sweet
Hereafter,'' ``Eve's Bayou,'' ``Lone Star,'' and ``The English
Patient'' all present a world in which conventional notions of
morality are eventually set on their head. These, of course, are
all ``art films,'' as they're called, and reach an audience much
smaller than that for blockbusters. It may be, though, that their
growing popularity represents a dissatisfaction with the Hollywood
worldview, just as the president's approval ratings reflect a
rejection of the moralism practiced by independent counsel Kenneth
Starr, lead impeachment manager Henry Hyde, and political columnist
David Broder.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, ``Hilary and Jackie,'' the film about musician
Jacqueline du Pre and her sister, plays provocatively with the
audience's notion of truth and morality. When Jackie tells Hilary
she wants to sleep with Hilary's husband, the woman sitting behind
me in the theater gasped ``What a monster!'' and then tsk'd her way
through the rest of the section of the film that tells the story
from Hilary's point of view. But the movie moves on to a segment in
which we go back and live many of the same events from the
cellist's perspective. We may still balk at the menage a trois, but
no longer do Jackie's actions seem the jealous, vengeful acts of a
monstrous woman.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ambiguity on TV
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One finds that same kind of moral ambiguity in many of the best
television programs. One of the trademarks of ``Homicide,'' for
example, is its ability to upset the good-guy/bad-guy underpinnings
of most police shows. On the other hand, ``The X-Files,'' for all
its brooding mystery, makes a point of saying that the world is not
ambiguous _ that ``the truth is out there.'' One only need decode
the conspiracy, much as the House managers believe that they have
decoded Clinton's conspiracy to obstruct justice.
</P>
<P>
   No one upsets this kind of absolutism as deftly as novelist
Russell Banks, and that goes for the two fine films based on his
books, ``The Sweet Hereafter'' (1997) and the new ``Affliction.''
The video release of ``The Sweet Hereafter,'' like the movie's
original posters, uses the slogan ``There's no such thing as the
simple truth.'' Speaking like one of the House impeachment
managers, the lawyer played by Ian Holm says, ``It's now up to me
to ensure the moral responsibility in this country'' in the wake of
a bus accident that took the lives of several children in a small
town. And sounding like a member of the public polled about the
president, a member of the community replies skeptically, ``You
want us to believe you know what's best for us?''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Affliction,'' Nick Nolte's character becomes convinced,
like Agent Mulder of ``The X-Files,'' that a vast conspiracy has
taken over the town and that he, through his moral authority as
sheriff, is going to bring the perpetrators to justice. (Skip the
next sentence if you don't want to know the outcome.) Ultimately,
his conspiracy theory is only half true; the other half is a
symptom of his psychological unraveling.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most haunting movies of recent years have dealt with
the issue of relative vs. absolute truth _ in fact, they derive
their power from showing us the ``truth'' from a variety of
perspectives. In ``Eve's Bayou,'' for example, we think that the
attempted rape of the daughter is what precipitated a family
tragedy, but when we see it from the father's perspective, it's the
daughter who did the seducing. (Shades of Bill and Monica.)
Finally, when a psychic demands to hold the girl's hands, it turns
out that father and daughter kissed simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hatred of relativism
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Devices like this are as old as ``Rashomon,'' but their
acceptance as standard elements of storytelling signals a widening
acceptance of a relativistic morality that drives absolutists on
the left and right bonkers. The hatred of relativism is one of the
reasons Republicans despise much of the art subsidized by the NEA
and that ardent feminists boycott Woody Allen movies.
</P>
<P>
   The same values, though, have crept into the mainstream. Take a
look at ``A Civil Action.'' In a traditional Hollywood movie, the
attorney played by John Travolta would have gone through a moral
transformation, from greedy, bottom-feeding lawyer to champion of
the underdog. But under Steve Zaillian's skillful direction, we're
never quite sure what's motivating this character _ doing the right
thing or playing power games with the legal opponent played by
Robert Duvall. As Travolta himself has explained, the lawyer
himself doesn't know. David E. Kelley has mined this motherlode of
ambiguity on his television legal shows: ``L.A. Law,'' ``Ally
McBeal,'' and ``The Practice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Saving Private Ryan'' gets under one's skin by undermining the
John Wayne-Gary Cooper legacy of World War II as a noble war and
making it as horrific as Vietnam became in the films of Stanley
Kubrick, Michael Cimino, and Oliver Stone. (Alas, ``Ryan'' director
Steven Spielberg backed away from that nightmarish vision in the
easy transcendence of the movie's second half, when it becomes a
celebration of Wayne-like absolutism.)
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, at least those in the House and Senate, seem to be
the last group in America to refuse to accept a complicated moral
landscape. Another, to judge by the best new TV program of the
year, is the Mafia. The head of ``The Sopranos,'' Tony, is no
Michael Corleone. Felled by fainting spells brought on by anxiety
attacks, he's driven to a psychiatrist. Bitterly he laments,
``Whatever happened to Gary Cooper?'' _ Coop never had to worry
about breaking into tears or worrying about the effects of ``a
formidable maternal presence'' in his life. Tony longs for the good
old days, when a code of silence kept gangsters from ratting to the
police; ``nowadays people have no values.''
</P>
<P>
   Tony's lament, meant to be ironic, is mirrored by those who long
for more absolutist days. Cold warrior novelist Tom Clancy recently
complained to USA Weekend (presumably without an ounce of irony)
about the shift from Cooper/Reagan to Travolta/Clinton: ``There are
250 million people whom your decisions will affect _ you better
have a strong sense of what's right and what's wrong.
Unfortunately, we live in a country where that's no longer the
case.''
</P>
<P>
   He's right that it's no longer the case. He's wrong about why.
Most Americans have decided that truth is elusive, particularly in
matters amorous, and that they don't need Tom Clancy, Cokie
Roberts, or Ken Starr to tell them right from wrong.

CANADIANS ON THE BRINK OF REDEFINING `SPOUSAL' BENEFITS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thirty-one years have passed since Canada's justice minister,
Pierre Elliott Trudeau, gave a bit of a start to his staid country
by telling a conference, ``The state has no place in the bedrooms
of the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   The remark helped propel Trudeau into the prime minister's
office. It also heralded criminal-code revisions that removed
penalties against private sexual acts between consenting adults.
</P>
<P>
   Canada is at the brink of making another startling move, one
that many religious conservatives have furiously resisted in the
United States. Federal Cabinet ministers have said the Canadian
government will act to erase all legal differences between
homosexual and heterosexual couples.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Minister Anne McClellan recently announced that the
government will not appeal the so-called Rosenberg ruling, a 1998
court decision in Ontario that ordered that ``spouse'' be redefined
to include gay partners in benefits.
</P>
<P>
   British Columbia already has acted along the same lines for the
province's 225,000 public employees. Last year, it passed
legislation that added same-sex partners to the list of people who
can be designated recipients of pension benefits. In the early
1990s, the city of Vancouver adopted a same-sex benefit policies
for its employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were the first, and we've done two very significant
things,'' said the Rev. Tim Stevenson, a United Church of Canada
minister who represents downtown Vancouver in the B.C. Legislature.
He also is gay and in a long-term relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first was to change the definition of spouse to include
same-sex couples. They are treated the same as heterosexual married
couples and common-law couples who have been together for at least
two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1998, we extended pensions to same-sex couples in the
public service, anyone who in any way works for the provincial
government or crown (government-owned) corporations. We want
private companies to take similar action of their own accord, so we
don't have to bring in legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   In British Columbia, the pension legislation was supported not
only by the ruling, left-leaning New Democratic Party, but also by
a majority of opposition legislators.
</P>
<P>
   Canada's Liberal Party has a majority in Parliament, and
likewise can count on some lawmakers from other parties if it
redefines ``spouse'' and extends pension benefits to same-sex
couples.
</P>
<P>
   But Prime Minister Jean Chretien has hesitated, even after his
Cabinet ministers announced the change. Chretien said he did not
know whether more legislation would be required.
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister's hesitation may relate to Canada's most
outspoken conservative prelate, Vancouver's Catholic Archbishop
Adam Exner.
</P>
<P>
   Exner was vociferous in condemning British Columbia's
redefinition of spouse. He raised the specter of ``special rights''
being extended to homosexuals, and claimed that a same-sex couple
cannot be considered married because ``biologically, such couples
are not equipped to be husband and wife.'' The archbishop warned
that Catholics, to whom he referred as ``our people,'' would make
their voices heard ``when election time comes about.''
</P>
<P>
   Exner took a similar strong position in a Jan. 27 letter to
Chretien. Speaking for Canada's Catholic hierarchy, he wrote: ``We
are deeply concerned that equating homosexual partners with married
and common-law couples could lead to a redefinition of marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Surely the government can think of a way to respond to the
legal challenges it faces from same-sex partners without redefining
terms that millions of Canadians cherish and undermining an
institution that plays a pivotal role in society.''
</P>
<P>
   Exner has also come up with an alternative. Instead of
same-gender couples, he suggested that pension and social benefits
be granted to anyone in a long-term, caring relationship _ such as
elderly siblings caring for each other.
</P>
<P>
   The archbishop is supported by such groups as the Langley,
B.C.-based Citizens Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Its executive director, Kari Simpson, has stumped British
Columbia with a pro-family message reminiscent of the Christian
Coalition in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me that the Canadian way is to let courts rule the
country,'' Simpson said. ``It brings political correctness to a new
height.''
</P>
<P>
   But other major religious groups have taken a different stand.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the United Church, the Anglican Church and the Canadian
Jewish Congress strongly backed the Canadian government when it
outlawed discrimination against gays and lesbians.
</P>
<P>
   The same groups have lined up behind giving social benefits to
same-sex couples. Vancouver's Anglican Bishop Michael Ingham told
the Vancouver Sun that the traditional, heterosexual family is not
threatened by society's decision to recognize a variety of
``long-term relationships.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People's attitudes have changed in our society, and are far
more accepting of equality for gays and lesbians,'' said Stevenson,
the United Church of Christ minister from Vancouver. ``We don't
have the extreme religious right you have to deal with in the
states.''

   &UR; HERBAL MEDICINE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times plans a 2{-page package of stories on the
increased popularity of herbal medicine.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-HERBS (Undated) _ Herbal medicine, the mainstay of
therapeutics for centuries before modern purified drugs relegated
it to the status of near-quackery, has in the last five years
emerged from the fringes of health care with an astonishing
flourish and now shows clear signs of joining the medical
mainstream. Despite many cautionary tales about adulterated and
even dangerous products, herbs formulated as capsules, tinctures,
extracts and teas _ and increasingly as additions to common foods
like potato chips and fruit drinks _ are now routinely used by a
third of American adults seeking to enhance their health or
alleviate their illnesses. By Jane E. Brody. (3000 words)

<P>
   SCI-BRODY-HEALTH (Undated) _ The Personal Health column: Experts
warn that an ill-informed foray into the ever-expanding world of
botanical medicines can end up causing more problems it they
solves. By Jane E. Brody. (1200 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-HERBS-DRUGS (Undated) _ Patients often lose out when a
prescription drug also is available as a supplement. Insurance
companies frequently refuse to pay for such prescriptions because
the same thing is available for sometimes a tenth of the cost. The
problem for consumers is that because supplements are unregulated,
there's no way short of chemical analysis to determine if the
substance actually contains what the label says it does. And,
that's a serious problem for people who rely on the treatment for
potentially lethal diseases. By Gina Kolata. (1100 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-HERBS-FOOD (Undated) _ Dozens of foods are landing on the
market to capitalize on America's soaring enthusiasm for herbal
remedies. No longer content with fortifying products with vitamins
or minerals, food companies are starting to add herb-based
substances that purport to offer particular health benefits,
benefits that in some cases have not yet been proven. At the same
time, companies are reaching to redefine existing foods _ oatmeal
is one _ in terms of their health benefits. By Constance L. Hays.

<P>
   &UR; OTHER SCIENCE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   SCI-COSMOS (Chicago) _ In a kind of summit conference on the
universe, the world's leading cosmologists have assessed their
theories and pronounced them healthy, saying that a wealth of new
research that at first seemed puzzling turns out to strengthen the
intellectual framework that has shaped decades of cosmological
debate. The astonishing discovery last year that the universe's

   SCI-MATH-CRANKS (Undated) _ With nothing more than a pencil and

would-be Ramanujans all over the world to send mathematicians
letter after letter crammed full of diagrams and equations
promising answers to unsolved problems ranging from squaring the
circle or proving (in a simpler way) Fermat's Last Theorem to
revealing, through the wonders of mathematics, the meaning of life.

   SCI-EMBRYO-CELLS (Undated) _ Six years ago, scientists in Canada
published a remarkable paper. In it, they reported that they had
grown entire mice from individual cells that they had plucked from
an mouse embryo. At the time, it was seen by those in the small
world of mouse researchers as a technological tour de force. But
now, as scientists are eyeing human embryo cells as material for
research, the experiment is giving rise to a thorny philosophical
question. If you can grow a mouse from a single embryo cell, you
should, in theory, be able to grow a human from a single human
embryo cell. And if you can grow a human from a single embryo cell,
is that cell the moral equivalent of an entire embryo? Where, in
other words, does the potential for human life lie? By Gina Kolata.

<P>
   &UR; HERBAL MEDICINE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times plans a 2{-page package of stories on the
increased popularity of herbal medicine.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-HERBS (Undated) _ Herbal medicine, the mainstay of
therapeutics for centuries before modern purified drugs relegated
it to the status of near-quackery, has in the last five years
emerged from the fringes of health care with an astonishing
flourish and now shows clear signs of joining the medical
mainstream. Despite many cautionary tales about adulterated and
even dangerous products, herbs formulated as capsules, tinctures,
extracts and teas _ and increasingly as additions to common foods
like potato chips and fruit drinks _ are now routinely used by a
third of American adults seeking to enhance their health or
alleviate their illnesses. By Jane E. Brody. (3000 words)
</P>
<P>
   With graphic.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-BRODY-HEALTH (Undated) _ The Personal Health column: Experts
warn that an ill-informed foray into the ever-expanding world of
botanical medicines can end up causing more problems it they
solves. By Jane E. Brody. (1200 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-HERBS-DRUGS (Undated) _ Patients often lose out when a
prescription drug also is available as a supplement. Insurance
companies frequently refuse to pay for such prescriptions because
the same thing is available for sometimes a tenth of the cost. The
problem for consumers is that because supplements are unregulated,
there's no way short of chemical analysis to determine if the
substance actually contains what the label says it does. And,
that's a serious problem for people who rely on the treatment for
potentially lethal diseases. By Gina Kolata. (1100 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-HERBS-FOOD (Undated) _ Dozens of foods are landing on the
market to capitalize on America's soaring enthusiasm for herbal
remedies. No longer content with fortifying products with vitamins
or minerals, food companies are starting to add herb-based
substances that purport to offer particular health benefits,
benefits that in some cases have not yet been proven. At the same
time, companies are reaching to redefine existing foods _ oatmeal
is one _ in terms of their health benefits. By Constance L. Hays.
(1750 words)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; OTHER SCIENCE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   SCI-COSMOS (Chicago) _ In a kind of summit conference on the
universe, the world's leading cosmologists have assessed their
theories and pronounced them healthy, saying that a wealth of new
research that at first seemed puzzling turns out to strengthen the
intellectual framework that has shaped decades of cosmological
debate. The astonishing discovery last year that the universe's
expansion is not slowing down, as assumed, but seems to be speeding
up jolted theorists of the Big Bang, whose theory for the explosive
beginning and expanding evolution of the universe had ``lived
dangerously for 30 years,'' as Sir Martin Rees of Cambridge
University in England put it. By John Noble Wilford. (2500 words)

would-be Ramanujans all over the world to send mathematicians
letter after letter crammed full of diagrams and equations
promising answers to unsolved problems ranging from squaring the
circle or proving (in a simpler way) Fermat's Last Theorem to
revealing, through the wonders of mathematics, the meaning of life.

FOR FIGHTING CRIME, THE EYES HAVE IT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC BRAZIL  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ When frustrated residents of ``The Hilltop''
neighborhood approached the police in Tacoma, Wash., about
installing video cameras to deter crime, ``we resisted it,''
Officer David Henry said.
</P>
<P>
   But neighborhood activists persevered: In 1992, they got a
$150,000 state grant and pressured the police into accepting it.
Soon seven cameras were mounted in plain view on utility poles.
``Almost immediately, calls from The Hilltop, where we had an
outrageous homicide rate, went down by half,'' Henry said.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of video camera surveillance of streets, subway systems
and parks has taken hold. More than 50 police departments operate
such systems. Elsewhere, cameras are mounted at key intersections
to catch red-light runners.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows exactly how many surveillance and security cameras
there are, but Richard Chace, spokesman for the Security Industry
Association, regards a figure of 2 million as a conservative
estimate. Indeed, in Manhattan alone more than 2,400 cameras record
the behavior of people in public places, according to a recent
survey by the New York Civil Liberties Union.
</P>
<P>
   As public safety trumps privacy in the hierarchy of priorities,
civil libertarians express dismay. Even the secrecy-conscious
security equipment industry is concerned.
</P>
<P>
   The trend toward relying on cameras instead of officers to deter
crime and catch crooks ``is the antithesis of community policing,''
said John Crew, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union
of Northern California.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he said the intrusiveness of video cameras and growing
affordability of surveillance technology should force a
re-examination of the old slogan that there is no expectation of
privacy in a public place. Since people can now be photographed by
a camera that can read small print from a mile away, people ``need
to start thinking about where we want to draw the zone of
privacy,'' Crew said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the explosive growth of the video surveillance business
in the 1990s, ``there is no coherent public policy on the use of
this important crime-fighting tool,'' said Chace, whose Security
Industry Association represents 360 companies around the world that
make or distribute security equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is great technology, it's there and the industry isn't
going to stop (selling) it, but it's getting a little out of
hand,'' Chace acknowledged. Consequently, the association has
scheduled an ``industry summit'' April 8-9 in Washington, D.C., to
develop protocols with input from law enforcement and civil
libertarians.
</P>
<P>
   James Dempsey of the Center for Democracy and Privacy in New
York said his organization sees ``a rising swell of public concern
about privacy generally, which is translating into legislative
concern. I think that (the industry's) self-regulatory efforts are
in many cases likely to be succeeded by legislative efforts.''
</P>
<P>
   Video surveillance systems were first installed in the United
States in the early 1970s to assist in traffic management and deter
bank robbers. In the hands of civic-minded amateurs, the video
camera has proved a useful law enforcement tool. In 1991, one
caught the police beating Rodney King in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the trend, the City Council in Oakland, Calif., killed a
proposed video surveillance pilot project in September 1997 after
the Police Department dropped its support.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no conclusive way to establish that the presence of
video surveillance cameras (results) in the prevention or reduction
of crime,'' Oakland Police Chief Joseph Samuels said.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco Police Chief Fred Lau said that although the
cameras ``can be good tools if properly used, they present a lot of
First Amendment concerns. Something of this magnitude would have to
go through a widespread hearing process. For the department to
become involved in one of these programs, the community would have
to be interested, and that's a big if.''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Such concerns have not stopped Pinole, Calif., a community of
18,000. Forty cameras oversee streets and parking lots in the
Police Department's surveillance network, which started at one
senior center across from a park that had a chronic crime problem.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, cameras have been installed in the new Pinole Vista
shopping center, and in the town's redevelopment areas. Still, no
cameras look over residential streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had groups that say they want the system in our
neighborhoods, but we've resisted that because of privacy issues,''
said Pinole police Lt. John Minor.
</P>
<P>
   As for the effectiveness of the cameras, Minor said: ``The
deterrent effect is a hard animal to track down with any
quantitative measure. But our feeling is that with all the
publicity the system's been getting, the crime has been less than
in other comparable areas. Our incidence of drunkenness and
disorderly conduct and assaults are down in that park. People know
the camera is there and they go elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Although it may be hard to demonstrate the deterrent effect of
video cameras, people believe the devices work. Security 2020, a
company in Nashville, Tenn., that makes an imitation security
camera for $39, reports that business is good.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people use one real one and 10 fake ones,'' Security
2020 President Ron Henry said.
</P>
<P>
   Even the real thing is cheaper than hiring more police officers
or security guards.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore, which reaped national publicity in 1996 with its
``Video Patrol'' program covering the city's high-crime area,
doubled the program's size recently, turning on the cameras along
Charles Street in the heart of downtown.
</P>
<P>
   The cost? Just $80,000, said Richard Cross, spokesman for the
Downtown Partnership, an entity of merchants, a foundation and the
city police and public works departments.

LICENSES MAY BUY MORE THAN THE RIGHT TO DRIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES M. ODATO  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ An Atlanta credit rating company knows if your
eyes are blue or if you need corrective lenses. It also knows when
to send a birthday card.
</P>
<P>
   A similar company in Allen, Texas, knows a lot about the
snowmobiles, motorcycles or boats you own and where you might park
them.
</P>
<P>
   And a Southfield, Mich., auto research firm knows enough about
your buying habits to remind you that the latest model of your
favorite car is about to roll out.
</P>
<P>
   These companies, and thousands more, also may know your date of
birth, address and other personal information New Yorkers provide
on vehicle registration and drivers license applications.
</P>
<P>
   They are among more than 3,500 firms and organizations paying
$49 million to the New York Department of Motor Vehicles each year
for such data. In many cases, the information is shared with
marketing companies, credit providers and insurers and then perhaps
resold.
</P>
<P>
   DMV possesses information from 10.5 million licenses and 10
million vehicle registrations.
</P>
<P>
   All of the registration data is sold in bulk to the highest
bidders. Two such bidders paid about $1.8 million this year
combined for a year's worth of information.
</P>
<P>
   One of the bidders, R.L. Polk, paid $3.2 million to get car
registrations during a two-year period from the state. The Michigan
company collects statistics about the number of cars and trucks
Americans buy each year and sells its research to car dealers and
manufacturers who use it for recalls and sales marketing.
</P>
<P>
   James Miller, a Polk spokesman, said the company finds out
enough about brand-loyal customers it can say ``the last two
vehicles you bought.''
</P>
<P>
   In New York, since 1989, registrants could check a box to opt
out of having their address provided for marketing purposes. About
23 percent do so, according to DMV officials.
</P>
<P>
   Some states don't allow the motor vehicle information to be sold
at all and others _ about a dozen _ only allow aggregate data about
registrations to be sold without names and addresses of
registrants.
</P>
<P>
   New York's license data, sold only on a case-by-case basis at $4
a record, is provided to some 3,500 different companies. The
biggest customers are insurance companies, credit reporting
companies, car rental agencies and driver employment services.
</P>
<P>
   Among the biggest purchasers are Choice Point, an Atlanta credit
rating bureau, and the Insurance Information Exchange of College
Station, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Enterprise Rent-A-Car, Avis, National and Hertz all are top-10
customers, as is State Farm Insurance. Private investigation
companies, insurance agencies, banks, newspaper companies and
charities also purchase the lists.
</P>
<P>
   The individual sales of registration, license and title records,
total about $46 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We treat this information as if everyone has said they don't
want the information released and only the people with permissible
uses get that information,'' said Jennifer Post, a DMV spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   She and other DMV officials said they make sure their bulk sales
customers are eligible according to federal laws created to
frustrate stalkers. The law contains a list of permissible
customers for the state data and DMV applies that list to its
non-bulk sales. The list allows use by marketers.
</P>
<P>
   License information, however, is considered public information
and the state tries to control its dissemination by requiring
companies to make individual requests.
</P>
<P>
   Robert J. Freeman, chairman of the Committee on Open Government,
said that it is important to keep information open on all state
licenses so that a licensee's qualifications can be checked.
</P>
<P>
   ``DMV is doing what it can to provide the broadest possible
access within the framework of the law,'' he said. ``There's a
thousand good reasons to keep it public.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the controls, the license data released provides users
the information individuals share with DMV and more: address,
height, eye color, restrictions, defensive driver course
information, and violation records.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the state's discretion to sell the database information
or not,'' said Linda Lewis, a spokeswoman for the American
Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators. ``Some do, some don't
... This is a revenue generator.''
</P>
<P>
   DMV revenues might have climbed by another $1 million a year or
more had a proposal to sell drivers license images panned out.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, after objections were raised by Sen. Joseph Bruno,
R-Brunswick, the photo sales idea was dropped by Gov. George
Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   The Pataki administration considered selling license pictures of
people who requested the photos be provided to credit card
companies as a security feature.
</P>
<P>
   Image Data, a New Hampshire company that markets a system to
prevent check and bank fraud, has been attempting to contract for
photos with other states. Those contracts have become the subject
of controversy in South Carolina, Colorado and Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``If state agencies are already releasing personal information
without our consent, we must put a stop to it,'' Bruno said when he
heard about the photo sales proposal.

   AMMAN _ Two Jordans buried their king Monday.
</P>
<P>
   There was the formal, westernized nation with its Scottish-style
bagpipers and new, English-accented monarch who invited the world's
statesmen to bury the ``fallen warrior'' on his polished gun
carriage, Hussein's Arab steed _ empty boots reversed in the
stirrups _ clopping obediently behind the coffin.
</P>
<P>
   And what the world saw _ indeed, what the world was supposed to
see _ was the adoration of kings, presidents, prime ministers and
princes: Clinton, Bush, Blair, Assad, Yeltsin, Chirac, Charles,
Shamir, Netanyahu, Mubarak, Weizman, Arafat, Sharon, Carter,
Ford... After all, was this not the man whom the American president
had already consigned to paradise?
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the other Jordan. Outside the gate, sweating and
shrieking to God, smashed back by gun butts, sworn at by the
descendants of Glubb Pasha's Arab Legion as they clawed their way
towards King Hussein's coffin, the other Jordan didn't quite fit in
with the pageantry on the other side of the palace wall.
</P>
<P>
   When the Jordanians broke through the troops and charged in
their thousands towards the gates, they were confronted by hundreds
more armed soldiers. ``In the name of God, help me,'' an old woman
moaned as the crowd stamped her into the mud.
</P>
<P>
   So which was the real Jordan? Was it the nation enshrined just
above the marble floor of the Rhagadan Palace, where the coffin of
the king was honored, prayed to, watched and nodded at by all the
dangerous, untrustworthy allies who had variously loved, hated or
plotted against him?
</P>
<P>
   Such sincerity, such affection they all showed Monday. There was
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who sent his killer
squad into Jordan only a few months ago to assassinate a Hamas
official, bowing stiffly before the coffin.
</P>
<P>
   There was American ex-President George Bush who just eight years
ago regarded Hussein as little more than an enemy agent.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, whose gunmen once sought to
destroy Hussein's kingdom, snapped to attention in his olive
fatigues and kuffiah scarf, twice saluting the flag-draped wooden
box in front of him.
</P>
<P>
   And behind the coffin, scarcely moving, was the studied, often
frowning face of King Abdullah the Second and his two
half-brothers, Crown Prince Hamzeh and Prince Hashem.
</P>
<P>
   They stood there, hands out in prayer from time to time, all
dressed in immaculate suits and ties and all wearing the same kind
of checkered red-and-white kuffiah as Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   It was if they were acting out some kind of unusual ritual, more
like English public schoolboys in an unfamiliar play than Arab
warrior princes, trying to cut a dash among the tall men of the old
Arab Legion _ Hussein renamed them the Jordan Arab Army after he
dismissed Glubb _ who guarded the coffin and its royal standard.
</P>
<P>
   Vulnerable was the word that came to mind. The princes didn't
look old enough or hard enough or cynical enough to handle the
sleek men who passed before them to honor their father.
</P>
<P>
   Some of them gentlemen, others venal dictators, quite a few with
an awful lot of blood on their hands, the harmless and the harmful
one after the other, they paraded before the coffin as if waiting
for group passport pictures.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Carter and Ford and Bush. Snap. Prince Charles and
Blair and Ashdown and Hague. Snap. Netanyahu and Sharon and Barak.
Snap. &QL;

 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I suppose it wasn't surprising that history was being rewritten
for the watching world. On the satellite television channels, the
dead king was being eulogized as the man who freely made peace with
Israel, whose country was praised _ this from CNN _ because it was
now closer to Israel than to many Arab states.
</P>
<P>
   So forget what the king once privately called the ``manacles''
of the Oslo agreement _ which forced Jordan into an unpopular peace
treaty with Israel _ and remember what President Clinton told us on
Sunday: that King Hussein is now in paradise. Which is where we
were told Egyptian President Anwar Sadat had gone after his death _
that being the destiny, it seems, of all Arab leaders who make
peace with Israel at our behest. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As for the crowds, whose voices could be heard baying beyond the
palace gates by the beautifully-groomed kings and presidents
inside, they had somewhat different ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, they loved the king, some of them. But there was less
enthusiasm for Abdullah and much less for Prince Hamzeh, Hussein's
son by his last wife, the half-American Queen Noor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hamzeh was chosen as new crown prince by the United States,''
a girl insisted. She was a Palestinian Jordanian.
</P>
<P>
   Rubbish, I snorted. You shouldn't believe in the ``moammarer,''
the plot, I told her. But then, an hour later, I saw the full list
of dignitaries at the palace and was struck by the list of State
Department men, the boys from the Washington ``peacemaking''
department led by Martin Indyk _ former head of the largest Israeli
lobby group and the man who somehow couldn't manage to persuade
Netanyahu to stop building Jewish settlements on Arab land but
insists that Arafat must ``crack down on terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   So was the real Jordan, then, among the swaying mass of
shabbily-dressed, shouting youth on the highway to the royal
palace, many of them poorly educated, some of them pathetically
adorned with crinkled pictures of the dead king glued to their
shirts and scarves?
</P>
<P>
   If Jordan has a 90 percent literacy rate _ thanks, of course, to
the late king _ then I had come across an oddly unrepresentative
sample of thousands.
</P>
<P>
   They were peasant families, many of them, the old women's faces
covered in tattoos, the men sitting quietly on blankets under the
trees alongside the palace road. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 275 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 975) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But when the king's coffin approached, a kind of ripple, half
sound and half movement, spread through the lines of tired, somehow
broken faces, as if a stone had been thrown into a human pond.
</P>
<P>
   There was no signal from them in advance, no instruction or
indication save perhaps for a line of children who suddenly moved
from the trees into the road. Then en masse the people swarmed
towards the coffin and its jeep-loads of head-scarved Jordanian
troops, tears streaming down their faces, hands outstretched to
touch, even to seize the flag or perhaps the coffin itself.
</P>
<P>
   I remember thinking, before a panicking soldier struck two men
with his rifle and punched me in the chest as the crowd fell on us
that it was like throwing petrol onto a kitchen stove.
</P>
<P>
   It was a strange, frightening kind of hysteria because it
combined both love and fury in almost exactly equal measure,
intense loyalty married to absolute rage.
</P>
<P>
   When I rolled over, I found the soldier lying beside me and
helped him to his feet. He shrugged as the crowd surged past him,
shouldered his rifle and walked after them in resignation.
</P>
<P>
   At the Teheran funeral of Ayatollah Khomeini, the crowds pulled
their Imam's body to the road and tore at his shroud. And if the
Arab Legion's descendants had not shouted in the name of their dead
king, and if the other soldiers had not laid into the first of the
young Jordanians who tried to clamber onto the carriage, it might
have happened in Amman, too. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Violence is portrayed so differently when its progenitors are
behind palace walls.
</P>
<P>
   How, one wondered, did the mass outside feel about the large
presence of Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon in front of their
king's coffin, the very man who sent Israel's Lebanese Phalangist
allies into the Sabra and Chatila Palestinian refugee camps in 1982
to ``hunt down terrorists,'' militiamen who then proceeded to
murder _ Serb-style _ hundreds of Palestinian civilians?
</P>
<P>
   What did they think of the presence of Liamine Zeroual, the
outgoing president of Algeria whose security forces _ in their
battle against ``Islamic'' killers _ have been accused of
systematic torture of men and women?
</P>
<P>
   What did they make of the arrival of President Hafez Assad of
Syria, who ordered his soldiers to ``eliminate'' an Islamic
uprising at Hama in 1982, an operation that left the dead in their
thousands?
</P>
<P>
   Or of former Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres, another of
Clinton's ``champions of peace,'' whose 1996 offensive against
Lebanon culminated in the Israeli massacre of 106 Lebanese
civilians in a U.N. camp at Qana?
</P>
<P>
   In every case, the victims had been Muslims, just as they had in
the war unleashed by the one man who most astonished the world by
turning up in Amman Monday and who may soon end up in a state
similar to the late King Hussein: Boris Yeltsin, whose butchery in
Chechnya is rarely mentioned in the West, waved to the cameras _ I
am alive, I am alive, he was trying to tell us _ and walked
falteringly into the palace. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   There were a few intriguing moments. Clinton paused to talk
briefly to Assad before the Syrian leader took a car to the palace
mosque rather that walk behind the coffin with the others. He
didn't want, I suppose, to be seen with Sharon and Netanyahu and
Shamir.

<P>
   AMMAN _ Two Jordans buried their king Monday.
</P>
<P>
   There was the formal, westernized nation with its Scottish-style
bagpipers and new, English-accented monarch who invited the world's
statesmen to bury the ``fallen warrior'' on his polished gun
carriage, Hussein's Arab steed _ empty boots reversed in the
stirrups _ clopping obediently behind the coffin.
</P>
<P>
   And what the world saw _ indeed, what the world was supposed to
see _ was the adoration of kings, presidents, prime ministers and
princes: Clinton, Bush, Blair, Assad, Yeltsin, Chirac, Charles,
Shamir, Netanyahu, Mubarak, Weizman, Arafat, Sharon, Carter,
Ford... After all, was this not the man whom the American president
had already consigned to paradise?
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the other Jordan. Outside the gate, sweating and
shrieking to God, smashed back by gun butts, sworn at by the
descendants of Glubb Pasha's Arab Legion as they clawed their way
towards King Hussein's coffin, the other Jordan didn't quite fit in
with the pageantry on the other side of the palace wall.
</P>
<P>
   When the Jordanians broke through the troops and charged in
their thousands towards the gates, they were confronted by hundreds
more armed soldiers. ``In the name of God, help me,'' an old woman
moaned as the crowd stamped her into the mud.
</P>
<P>
   So which was the real Jordan? Was it the nation enshrined just
above the marble floor of the Rhagadan Palace, where the coffin of
the king was honored, prayed to, watched and nodded at by all the
dangerous, untrustworthy allies who had variously loved, hated or
plotted against him?
</P>
<P>
   Such sincerity, such affection they all showed Monday. There was
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who sent his killer
squad into Jordan only a few months ago to assassinate a Hamas
official, bowing stiffly before the coffin.
</P>
<P>
   There was American ex-President George Bush who just eight years
ago regarded Hussein as little more than an enemy agent.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, whose gunmen once sought to
destroy Hussein's kingdom, snapped to attention in his olive
fatigues and kuffiah scarf, twice saluting the flag-draped wooden
box in front of him.
</P>
<P>
   And behind the coffin, scarcely moving, was the studied, often
frowning face of King Abdullah the Second and his two
half-brothers, Crown Prince Hamzeh and Prince Hashem.
</P>
<P>
   They stood there, hands out in prayer from time to time, all
dressed in immaculate suits and ties and all wearing the same kind
of checkered red-and-white kuffiah as Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   It was if they were acting out some kind of unusual ritual, more
like English public schoolboys in an unfamiliar play than Arab
warrior princes, trying to cut a dash among the tall men of the old
Arab Legion _ Hussein renamed them the Jordan Arab Army after he
dismissed Glubb _ who guarded the coffin and its royal standard.
</P>
<P>
   Vulnerable was the word that came to mind. The princes didn't
look old enough or hard enough or cynical enough to handle the
sleek men who passed before them to honor their father.
</P>
<P>
   Some of them gentlemen, others venal dictators, quite a few with
an awful lot of blood on their hands, the harmless and the harmful
one after the other, they paraded before the coffin as if waiting
for group passport pictures.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Carter and Ford and Bush. Snap. Prince Charles and
Blair and Ashdown and Hague. Snap. Netanyahu and Sharon and Barak.
Snap. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   I suppose it wasn't surprising that history was being rewritten
for the watching world. On the satellite television channels, the
dead king was being eulogized as the man who freely made peace with
Israel, whose country was praised _ this from CNN _ because it was
now closer to Israel than to many Arab states.
</P>
<P>
   So forget what the king once privately called the ``manacles''
of the Oslo agreement _ which forced Jordan into an unpopular peace
treaty with Israel _ and remember what President Clinton told us on
Sunday: that King Hussein is now in paradise. Which is where we
were told Egyptian President Anwar Sadat had gone after his death _
that being the destiny, it seems, of all Arab leaders who make
peace with Israel at our behest. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As for the crowds, whose voices could be heard baying beyond the
palace gates by the beautifully-groomed kings and presidents
inside, they had somewhat different ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, they loved the king, some of them. But there was less
enthusiasm for Abdullah and much less for Prince Hamzeh, Hussein's
son by his last wife, the half-American Queen Noor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hamzeh was chosen as new crown prince by the United States,''
a girl insisted. She was a Palestinian Jordanian.
</P>
<P>
   Rubbish, I snorted. You shouldn't believe in the ``moammarer,''
the plot, I told her. But then, an hour later, I saw the full list
of dignitaries at the palace and was struck by the list of State
Department men, the boys from the Washington ``peacemaking''
department led by Martin Indyk _ former head of the largest Israeli
lobby group and the man who somehow couldn't manage to persuade
Netanyahu to stop building Jewish settlements on Arab land but
insists that Arafat must ``crack down on terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   So was the real Jordan, then, among the swaying mass of
shabbily-dressed, shouting youth on the highway to the royal
palace, many of them poorly educated, some of them pathetically
adorned with crinkled pictures of the dead king glued to their
shirts and scarves?
</P>
<P>
   If Jordan has a 90 percent literacy rate _ thanks, of course, to
the late king _ then I had come across an oddly unrepresentative
sample of thousands.
</P>
<P>
   They were peasant families, many of them, the old women's faces
covered in tattoos, the men sitting quietly on blankets under the
trees alongside the palace road. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;

<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 275 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 975) &LR;  &QC;

</P>
<P>
   But when the king's coffin approached, a kind of ripple, half
sound and half movement, spread through the lines of tired, somehow
broken faces, as if a stone had been thrown into a human pond.
</P>
<P>
   There was no signal from them in advance, no instruction or
indication save perhaps for a line of children who suddenly moved
from the trees into the road. Then en masse the people swarmed
towards the coffin and its jeep-loads of head-scarved Jordanian
troops, tears streaming down their faces, hands outstretched to
touch, even to seize the flag or perhaps the coffin itself.
</P>
<P>
   I remember thinking, before a panicking soldier struck two men
with his rifle and punched me in the chest as the crowd fell on us
that it was like throwing petrol onto a kitchen stove.
</P>
<P>
   It was a strange, frightening kind of hysteria because it
combined both love and fury in almost exactly equal measure,
intense loyalty married to absolute rage.
</P>
<P>
   When I rolled over, I found the soldier lying beside me and
helped him to his feet. He shrugged as the crowd surged past him,
shouldered his rifle and walked after them in resignation.
</P>
<P>
   At the Teheran funeral of Ayatollah Khomeini, the crowds pulled
their Imam's body to the road and tore at his shroud. And if the
Arab Legion's descendants had not shouted in the name of their dead
king, and if the other soldiers had not laid into the first of the
young Jordanians who tried to clamber onto the carriage, it might
have happened in Amman, too. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Violence is portrayed so differently when its progenitors are
behind palace walls.
</P>
<P>
   How, one wondered, did the mass outside feel about the large
presence of Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon in front of their
king's coffin, the very man who sent Israel's Lebanese Phalangist
allies into the Sabra and Chatila Palestinian refugee camps in 1982
to ``hunt down terrorists,'' militiamen who then proceeded to
murder _ Serb-style _ hundreds of Palestinian civilians?
</P>
<P>
   What did they think of the presence of Liamine Zeroual, the
outgoing president of Algeria whose security forces _ in their
battle against ``Islamic'' killers _ have been accused of
systematic torture of men and women?
</P>
<P>
   What did they make of the arrival of President Hafez Assad of
Syria, who ordered his soldiers to ``eliminate'' an Islamic
uprising at Hama in 1982, an operation that left the dead in their
thousands?
</P>
<P>
   Or of former Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres, another of
Clinton's ``champions of peace,'' whose 1996 offensive against
Lebanon culminated in the Israeli massacre of 106 Lebanese
civilians in a U.N. camp at Qana?
</P>
<P>
   In every case, the victims had been Muslims, just as they had in
the war unleashed by the one man who most astonished the world by
turning up in Amman Monday and who may soon end up in a state
similar to the late King Hussein: Boris Yeltsin, whose butchery in
Chechnya is rarely mentioned in the West, waved to the cameras _ I
am alive, I am alive, he was trying to tell us _ and walked
falteringly into the palace. &QL;

 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   There were a few intriguing moments. Clinton paused to talk
briefly to Assad before the Syrian leader took a car to the palace
mosque rather that walk behind the coffin with the others. He
didn't want, I suppose, to be seen with Sharon and Netanyahu and
Shamir.
</P>
<P>
   But few outside saw more than a glassed-over vision of the men
who rule the world.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting on the pavement by a motorway bridge, the people of the
al-Nuzhah area of Amman just caught the briefest of glimpses of
Clinton's shock of grey hair in the back of a black limousine,
Arafat's frozen, sick features, a gaggle of robed Saudis in their

<TEXT>
<P>
   AMMAN _ As the solemn procession of world leaders walked past
the body of King Hussein Monday, many of them must have remembered
they had attended a similar ceremony sixty miles away across the
Jordan River in Jerusalem just three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   It is an ominous precedent. In 1995 it was King Hussein himself
who was among the leading mourners to stand by the coffin of
Yitzhak Rabin, the assassinated Israeli prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Monday it was his turn to receive the same florid tributes from
President Clinton and the leaders of half the world as a
``visionary and peacemaker.''
</P>
<P>
   Television correspondents spoke piously of Jordan, as they had
of Israel, as ``a nation in mourning.''
</P>
<P>
   One Jordanian, noting the parallel between the two funerals,
said nervously that he hoped King Hussein's political legacy would
last longer than Rabin's.
</P>
<P>
   Six months after the death of their leader, Israelis chose
Benjamin Netanyahu, a man whom Rabin detested, to be their prime
minister. They voted even more decisively for a parliament which
opposed the peace terms with the Palestinians signed by Rabin.
</P>
<P>
   People in Jordan were flattered by the sight of President
Clinton and three former U.S. presidents arriving for the king's
funeral followed by Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president and the
leaders of half the world.
</P>
<P>
   They also noticed that in one of the most politically turbulent
regions of the world there was no threat to their safety. ``It is a
problem of logistics, not security,'' said one Jordanian official.
</P>
<P>
   In the longer term, however, Jordanians have an acute sense of
the vulnerability of their country.
</P>
<P>
   Though the television cameras zoomed in immediately on mourners
in tears as they lined the streets, the real mood of Jordan is of
anxiety about their future as much as grief for the dead king.
</P>
<P>
   Jordanians understand that King Hussein never had much room to
maneuver. He ruled a small country surrounded by more powerful
neighbors. Nobody knew this better than himself.
</P>
<P>
   He was once asked why he had grown a beard. He replied: ``I grew
it because it is one of the few decisions I can take without having
to ask somebody else if it is OK to go ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   His ceaseless diplomatic activity was at bottom a sign of
weakness. He needed to insert himself into every problem in the
Middle East, win for Jordan an influence it could not command
through its own strength and prevent his country from becoming the
victim of events it could not control.
</P>
<P>
   His dilemma was the same as that of Yasser Arafat, though the
king escaped the Palestinian leader's reputation for
untrustworthiness.
</P>
<P>
   Neither man ever had many political cards in his hand. Both
balanced uneasily between the needs of their own people and the
demands of outside powers. Both switched alliances repeatedly. They
cultivated the U.S. but tried to avoid becoming its pawn. Neither
was entirely successful.
</P>
<P>
   The king balanced between Arab nationalism and the need to
conciliate Israel and keep Washington friendly. It was ultimately a
defensive policy. He could not afford to take too many risks.
</P>
<P>
   He needed to ensure that Jordan was not cut out of negotiations
between Israel and the Palestinians, but not to the point where
Palestinians thought he was presenting himself as their sole
leader.
</P>
<P>
   King Hussein's ambivalent policies were not only the result of
the ever-present threats facing Jordan from Israel, Iraq, Syria and
Saudi Arabia. The country itself is a buffer state created by
Britain after the First World War. Some 60 percent of its
population is of Palestinian origin.
</P>
<P>
   A survey carried out by the Center for Strategic Studies at the
University of Jordan several years ago shows that Palestinians
resent the control of most government jobs and all sensitive
military and security posts by citizens of Jordanian origin.
</P>
<P>
   They believe they are under-represented in the cabinet and
parliament and that the bureaucracy discriminates against them.
</P>
<P>
   For their part Jordanians resent Palestinian control of private
business. They fear more Palestinian refugees entering the country;
some 350,000 Palestinians expelled from Kuwait came to Jordan in
1991.
</P>
<P>
   They see Palestinians with Jordanian citizenship as ungrateful
and having dual loyalty to Jordan and the Palestinian leadership.
</P>
<P>
   In Jordan every change in its complicated relations with its
neighbors has the potential to create a crisis at home between the
two main groups in the country. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (275-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There is a further problem. Television commentary Monday
stressed that King Hussein was much loved by his people. This is
true. But the commentators forbore to mention that the king's
popularity in Jordan was at its peak in 1991 when he maintained a
friendly neutrality towards Saddam Hussein and Iraq during the Gulf
war. Official policy and the popular mood were for once at one.
Democratization was at its height.
</P>
<P>
   It could not last. Jordan was diplomatically isolated.
Then-President George Bush would not even see his old friend King
Hussein. James Baker, the U.S. secretary of state, told the king:
``It's a tough row to hoe to repair Jordan's relationship with the
United States.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact it was repaired more quickly than he thought. The U.S.
needed Jordan to deal with Israel and the Palestinians. Jordan
moved back into U.S.-Israeli orbit.
</P>
<P>
   King Hussein signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994. A year
later he broke definitively with Saddam Hussein. He felt, rightly,
that he had no choice. But neither move was popular at home. The
treaty with Israel was commonly called ``the king's peace'' and
seen as an Arab defeat.
</P>
<P>
   An anti-Iraqi and pro-Israeli policy abroad meant less tolerance
of dissent at home. The king responded to riots in 1989 in the
Jordanian heartland in the south of the country by granting greater
freedom of expression and more democracy.
</P>
<P>
   From the mid-1990s these policies went into reverse. In the last
two years a stringent press law and government ownership of part of
the media has meant that Jordanians once again turn to foreign
radios and television for their information. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF 275-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   King Hussein could get away with veering between democracy and
repression, mild though it was by regional standards, because
Jordanians believed at heart that he knew what he was about.
</P>
<P>
   He was personally moderate and skillful at conciliating enemies.
It is by no means clear that King Abdullah, his army officer eldest
son and successor, will have such leeway with Jordanians or
Palestinians to conduct such an unpopular foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan sees itself as surrounded by vultures with those from
Israel and Iraq considered the most predatory. Monday they were on
their best behavior, but both are quick to sense political weakness
and equally merciless in exploiting it. &QL;

   It is an ominous precedent. In 1995 it was King Hussein himself
who was among the leading mourners to stand by the coffin of
Yitzhak Rabin, the assassinated Israeli prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Monday it was his turn to receive the same florid tributes from
President Clinton and the leaders of half the world as a
``visionary and peacemaker.''
</P>
<P>
   Television correspondents spoke piously of Jordan, as they had
of Israel, as ``a nation in mourning.''
</P>
<P>
   One Jordanian, noting the parallel between the two funerals,
said nervously that he hoped King Hussein's political legacy would
last longer than Rabin's.
</P>
<P>
   Six months after the death of their leader, Israelis chose
Benjamin Netanyahu, a man whom Rabin detested, to be their prime
minister. They voted even more decisively for a parliament which
opposed the peace terms with the Palestinians signed by Rabin.
</P>
<P>
   People in Jordan were flattered by the sight of President
Clinton and three former U.S. presidents arriving for the king's
funeral followed by Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president and the
leaders of half the world.
</P>
<P>
   They also noticed that in one of the most politically turbulent
regions of the world there was no threat to their safety. ``It is a
problem of logistics, not security,'' said one Jordanian official.
</P>
<P>
   In the longer term, however, Jordanians have an acute sense of
the vulnerability of their country.
</P>
<P>
   Though the television cameras zoomed in immediately on mourners
in tears as they lined the streets, the real mood of Jordan is of
anxiety about their future as much as grief for the dead king.
</P>
<P>
   Jordanians understand that King Hussein never had much room to
maneuver. He ruled a small country surrounded by more powerful
neighbors. Nobody knew this better than himself.
</P>
<P>
   He was once asked why he had grown a beard. He replied: ``I grew
it because it is one of the few decisions I can take without having
to ask somebody else if it is OK to go ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   His ceaseless diplomatic activity was at bottom a sign of
weakness. He needed to insert himself into every problem in the
Middle East, win for Jordan an influence it could not command
through its own strength and prevent his country from becoming the
victim of events it could not control.
</P>
<P>
   His dilemma was the same as that of Yasser Arafat, though the
king escaped the Palestinian leader's reputation for
untrustworthiness.
</P>
<P>
   Neither man ever had many political cards in his hand. Both
balanced uneasily between the needs of their own people and the
demands of outside powers. Both switched alliances repeatedly. They
cultivated the U.S. but tried to avoid becoming its pawn. Neither
was entirely successful.
</P>
<P>
   The king balanced between Arab nationalism and the need to
conciliate Israel and keep Washington friendly. It was ultimately a
defensive policy. He could not afford to take too many risks.
</P>
<P>
   He needed to ensure that Jordan was not cut out of negotiations
between Israel and the Palestinians, but not to the point where
Palestinians thought he was presenting himself as their sole
leader.
</P>
<P>
   King Hussein's ambivalent policies were not only the result of
the ever-present threats facing Jordan from Israel, Iraq, Syria and
Saudi Arabia. The country itself is a buffer state created by
Britain after the First World War. Some 60 percent of its
population is of Palestinian origin.
</P>
<P>
   A survey carried out by the Center for Strategic Studies at the
University of Jordan several years ago shows that Palestinians
resent the control of most government jobs and all sensitive
military and security posts by citizens of Jordanian origin.
</P>
<P>
   They believe they are under-represented in the cabinet and
parliament and that the bureaucracy discriminates against them.
</P>
<P>
   For their part Jordanians resent Palestinian control of private
business. They fear more Palestinian refugees entering the country;
some 350,000 Palestinians expelled from Kuwait came to Jordan in
1991.
</P>
<P>
   They see Palestinians with Jordanian citizenship as ungrateful
and having dual loyalty to Jordan and the Palestinian leadership.
</P>
<P>
   In Jordan every change in its complicated relations with its
neighbors has the potential to create a crisis at home between the
two main groups in the country. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   There is a further problem. Television commentary Monday
stressed that King Hussein was much loved by his people. This is
true. But the commentators forbore to mention that the king's
popularity in Jordan was at its peak in 1991 when he maintained a
friendly neutrality towards Saddam Hussein and Iraq during the Gulf
war. Official policy and the popular mood were for once at one.
Democratization was at its height.
</P>
<P>
   It could not last. Jordan was diplomatically isolated.
Then-President George Bush would not even see his old friend King
Hussein. James Baker, the U.S. secretary of state, told the king:
``It's a tough row to hoe to repair Jordan's relationship with the
United States.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact it was repaired more quickly than he thought. The U.S.
needed Jordan to deal with Israel and the Palestinians. Jordan
moved back into U.S.-Israeli orbit.
</P>
<P>
   King Hussein signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994. A year
later he broke definitively with Saddam Hussein. He felt, rightly,
that he had no choice. But neither move was popular at home. The
treaty with Israel was commonly called ``the king's peace'' and
seen as an Arab defeat.
</P>
<P>
   An anti-Iraqi and pro-Israeli policy abroad meant less tolerance
of dissent at home. The king responded to riots in 1989 in the
Jordanian heartland in the south of the country by granting greater
freedom of expression and more democracy.
</P>
<P>
   From the mid-1990s these policies went into reverse. In the last
two years a stringent press law and government ownership of part of
the media has meant that Jordanians once again turn to foreign
radios and television for their information. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF 275-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   King Hussein could get away with veering between democracy and
repression, mild though it was by regional standards, because
Jordanians believed at heart that he knew what he was about.
</P>
<P>
   He was personally moderate and skillful at conciliating enemies.
It is by no means clear that King Abdullah, his army officer eldest
son and successor, will have such leeway with Jordanians or
Palestinians to conduct such an unpopular foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan sees itself as surrounded by vultures with those from
Israel and Iraq considered the most predatory. Monday they were on
their best behavior, but both are quick to sense political weakness
and equally merciless in exploiting it. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   AMMAN, Jordan _ Last October, with his efforts to broker an
Israeli-Palestinian peace accord ''about to come apart,'' at a
remote retreat on Maryland's eastern shore, President Clinton
summoned Jordan's King Hussein from his Mayo Clinic sickbed to help
rescue the flagging talks.
</P>
<P>
   Late on a frosty night, his once-sturdy frame left gaunt by the
ravages of a disease that would soon take his life, the ailing
monarch strode into a large dining room where weary negotiators
were picking at plates of fish and veal.
</P>
<P>
   There, Hussein delivered an impassioned plea, summing up with
persuasive eloquence both the challenges and the imperatives for
peace, and helping to prod Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat the last grudging
inches toward what became the Wye River accords.
</P>
<P>
   ''All the icy atmosphere of those tense talks would immediately
disappear when Hussein walk in the room,'' Clinton recalled on
Monday. ''It was almost as if the more frail his body became, the
more powerful the essence of his spirit was.''
</P>
<P>
   During six years of on-again off-again efforts to end half a
century of enmity and bloodshed in the Middle East, Clinton has
known no more steadfast a companion in the peace process than King
Hussein, whose remains were laid to rest here Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Never was that partnership more needed, Clinton said, than
during those difficult days last October, when Hussein offered to
lend his assistance to keeping the negotiations alive.
</P>
<P>
   ''He said, 'Well, I would be willing to come down there if you
think it would help,''' Clinton recalled to a group of U.S. Embassy
personnel here Monday night. ''I said, 'If I think it would help?
This whole thing is about to come apart. Of course it would
help.'''
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the peace process stalled and lurching toward a
potentially disastrous May 4 deadline for the resolution of a
thorny set of outstanding issues between Palestinians and Israelis,
the White House is contemplating the absence of a man National
Security Adviser Samuel E. Berger called, ''the transcendent voice
for war and peace in the Middle East over the past several years.''
</P>
<P>
   One year after Arafat and Yitzhak Rabin, then-prime minister of
Israel, signed their historic peace agreement on the White House
lawn in 1993, Hussein came to the White House to ink Jordan's own
peace treaty with Israel -- a bold move that embittered some of
both his Arab neighbors and his own loyal subjects.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, he has stood by Clinton's efforts to advance peace
eforts ever since, always available by telephone or in person to
provide the advice or diplomatic aid of a polished and widely
revered senior Arab statesman.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein's own long career, after all, depended upon a precision
act of balance between the interests of his U.S. allies, his Arab
neighbors and the Palestinians who make up the majority of Jordan's
4.4 million populous.
</P>
<P>
   Berger said the peace process must survive Hussein's death, as
it has outlived other pioneers for peace in the region, such as
former Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Rabin, both of whom were
assassinated by zealous countrymen who opposed the risks each man
took to make peace.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've lost other towering figures in this peace process,''
Berger said. ''But the process has gone forward ... this is a
region that can ultimately make progress only if there is peace.''
</P>
<P>
   As Hussein's son, King Abdullah, assumed power over the weekend,
Clinton moved quickly to try to shore up the 37-year-old monarch's
position. He announced that he would work with Congress to
accelerate the $300 million -- over three years -- in economic aid
promised to Jordan as part of the Wye accords.
</P>
<P>
   That's in addition to the $225 million in economic and military
aid the United States is to provide Jordan this year, and an equal
amount Clinton has asked Congress for in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also said he would back increased development aid to
Jordan from the World Bank and expanded economic support from its
sister institution, the International Monetary Fund -- more
recognition of the importance he continues to attach to Jordan's
role in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   ''Jordan remains a major part of the equation in how we will get
to a comprehensive peace in the Middle East,'' said National
Security Council spokesman P.J. Crowley. ''Its links with Israel,
its ability to expand trade with Israel, that will be critical to
providing the economic incentive for all of the parties to learn
that they really have no alternative but to live in peace.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   That message faces new tests in the weeks ahead. Under the 1993
Oslo accords, Israelis and Palestinians agreed to complete, by May
4 of this year, negotiations on a final, comprehensive peace
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Such talks would center on some of the most difficult
outstanding issues, including Palestinian statehood and the future
of Jerusalem, parts of which are claimed by both sides.
</P>
<P>
   Those negotiations haven't even begun in earnest, however, and
even the Wye accords -- essentially an agreement by Israel to
withdraw troops from parts of the occupied West Bank and turn over
territory to Palestinian control in exchange for Palestinian
security guarantees -- have been frozen since December amid a
political crisis in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   With Israeli parliamentary elections scheduled for May 17, the
situation is stalled. There's no prospect for meeting the Oslo
deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat has threatened to unilaterally declare a Palestinian
state on May 4 -- with or without a comprehensive peace pact -- and
Israel has said such a move could spark war.
</P>
<P>
   During a brief meeting in Washington last week, Clinton urged
Arafat to be patient in the face of Israeli political ferment.
Privately, U.S. diplomats have their fingers crossed that Arafat
has embraced that message.
</P>
<P>
   As a final tribute to the life and work of King Hussein, the
three surviving principals of the Wye River accords -- Clinton,
Arafat and Netanyahu -- were on hand here Monday when the late
monarch's body was laid to rest.
</P>
<P>
   With the White House caught in the middle, once again, of the
region's enduring strife, observers say Hussein's passing is, for
Clinton, one more Mideast burden to bear.

</P>
<P>
   There was the formal, westernized nation with its Scottish-style
bagpipers and a new, English-accented monarch.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the other Jordan. Outside the palace gate,
sweating and shrieking to God, smashed back by gun butts, sworn at
by the descendants of Glubb Pasha's Arab Legion as they clawed
their way towards King Hussein's coffin, the other Jordan didn't
quite fit in with the pageantry on the other side of the palace
wall.

<P>
   To the end, he was a king.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein ibn Talal had spoken of his own mortality many times,
and his last journey Friday _ six thousand miles from an American
deathbed to the land he ruled for 46 years _ became him. Soldiers
prefer to die at home.
</P>
<P>
   He was an honorable man. He believed that if he trusted enough
in another person, his good faith would be returned; he was cruelly
rewarded...
</P>
<P>
   What king would ever turn up at his own state security jail to
drive his most vociferous political prisoner home?
</P>
<P>
   Leith Shubailath had infuriated the monarch _ he was a man
easily riled _ and was imprisoned for asking why the queen wept at
Yitzhak Rabin's funeral. When the king arrived at the prison,
Shubeilath delayed him ten minutes while he said goodbye to his
fellow inmates. Hussein waited patiently for him.
</P>
<P>
   Would Saddam (who prefers to string his prisoners up) have done
that? Would King Fahd? Would President Mubarak? Would Benjamin
Netanyahu?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it is this which distinguished the king: among the
monsters of the Middle East, he appeared such a reasonable man.
</P>
<P>
   He was, in a very real sense, the region's political Bomb
Disposal Officer, the one man who could be relied on to calm
nerves, order bystanders to open their windows and then gently,
firmly, withdraw the detonator of war.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Arabs and Israelis fear for the future. What are they
going to do now that there is no one to defuse the bombs? &QL;

Hussein's political career was spent playing off his enemies

Jordanians, who are not used to cold, groped their way forward in

   All across the Arab world, age and sickness haunt the lands.

<P>
   Jordan's King Hussein is dead, having succumbed to his toughest
enemy, cancer. Saudi Arabia's King Fahd can barely stand, and
stumbles on the simplest sentences. Yasser Arafat suffers ever more
from the brain tumor inflicted after a near-fatal air crash.
Syria's Hafez Assad suffers from a heart condition, and has lost
his heir-apparent son, Basil, in a road accident. Egypt's Hosni
Mubarak has never appointed a vice-president, let alone a
successor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Succession'': it's the Middle East's unspoken crisis. The
great unmentionable. But it is real.
</P>
<P>
   We in the West, of course, accept the Arab world's odd,
dangerous system of inheritance. Why? Because we like
dictatorships. We know how to do business with the kings and
generals _ how to sell them our arms, fighter-bombers and missiles.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that we, as well as the Arab regimes themselves,
have produced and maintained this archaic drama of crown princes
and beloved sons, of gulf sheikhdoms that are no more than the
private property of individual families... &QL;

   When King Hussein began his initial six months of cancer
treatment at the Mayo Clinic last year, his younger brother Hassan
should have cast his mind back to the day, 43 years earlier, when
another trusted servant of the monarchy believed he was secure in
his job.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein was only 21 but had already argued brusquely with
Lieutenant General Sir John Bagot Glubb, commander of his Arab
Legion and principal military adviser to his majesty.
</P>
<P>
   Persuaded by his own confidants that Glubb Pasha should be
dismissed, and convinced that the British were trying to control
Jordan's armed forces, the king fired the 59-year old British
general. Glubb Pasha was taken to the airport the next morning in
Hussein's own car.
</P>
<P>
   Ignoring this historical precedent, Crown Prince Hassan used his
regency last year to boost his own image, to project his rule in
the Jordanian press and to demand the firing of Hussein's chief of
staff.
</P>
<P>
   To the sick king in Minnesota, his brother Hassan was trying to
take over the army _ just as Glubb was trying to do in 1956.
</P>
<P>
   But Hassan could not be packed off to Amman airport. Instead,
the king came home, disgraced his brother and picked another
Sandhurst graduate as regent _ a man, ironically, of whom Glubb
Pasha would have approved _ Hussein's eldest son, Abdullah... &QL;

are quick to sense political weakness and equally merciless in

   AMMAN _ Two Jordans buried their king Monday.
</P>
<P>
   There was the formal, westernized nation with its Scottish-style
bagpipers and a new, English-accented monarch.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the other Jordan. Outside the palace gate,
sweating and shrieking to God, smashed back by gun butts, sworn at
by the descendants of Glubb Pasha's Arab Legion as they clawed
their way towards King Hussein's coffin, the other Jordan didn't
quite fit in with the pageantry on the other side of the palace
wall.
</P>
<P>
   So which was the real Jordan?... &QL;

</P>
<P>
   To the end, he was a king.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein ibn Talal had spoken of his own mortality many times,
and his last journey Friday _ six thousand miles from an American
deathbed to the land he ruled for 46 years _ became him. Soldiers
prefer to die at home.
</P>
<P>
   He was an honorable man. He believed that if he trusted enough
in another person, his good faith would be returned; he was cruelly
rewarded...
</P>
<P>
   What king would ever turn up at his own state security jail to
drive his most vociferous political prisoner home?
</P>
<P>
   Leith Shubailath had infuriated the monarch _ he was a man
easily riled _ and was imprisoned for asking why the queen wept at
Yitzhak Rabin's funeral. When the king arrived at the prison,
Shubeilath delayed him ten minutes while he said goodbye to his
fellow inmates. Hussein waited patiently for him.
</P>
<P>
   Would Saddam (who prefers to string his prisoners up) have done
that? Would King Fahd? Would President Mubarak? Would Benjamin
Netanyahu?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it is this which distinguished the king: among the
monsters of the Middle East, he appeared such a reasonable man.
</P>
<P>
   He was, in a very real sense, the region's political Bomb
Disposal Officer, the one man who could be relied on to calm
nerves, order bystanders to open their windows and then gently,
firmly, withdraw the detonator of war.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Arabs and Israelis fear for the future. What are they
going to do now that there is no one to defuse the bombs? &QL;

   As the West pays its respects to the memory of King Hussein of
Jordan, it should pause to acknowledge a conundrum.
</P>
<P>
   The King has been a good leader, of his own people and of wider
Arab interests in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   It is to be hoped that the rather Shakespearian deathbed
maneuvers, dashing at the 11th hour his brother's 34-year

Abdullah, will come to good... &QL;

Hussein's political career was spent playing off his enemies

   He played both ends against the middle because he believed
(correctly) that Jordan's weakness _ 4.4 million people and no
natural resources or defenses _ left him no choice.

had just died women braved the driving rain to sob; some fell
fainting to the ground as they waited for the king's body to leave
the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Even more moving than the tears, though, was the way in which
Jordanians, who are not used to cold, groped their way forward in
the white banks of mist to express sorrow for their beloved king.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in Amman, people looked worried more than
grief-striken. King Hussein had always protected them from the dark
forces around Jordan; what will happen to their tiny, vulnerable
kingdom now that he is gone? &QL;

and trucks through the driving rain and thick, ominous mist to
tearfully wait for his body to be removed from the hospital.

closing up as a sign of respect for the beloved king _ and father

<P>
   They look an awful lot like 15-ounce cans of soup. With labels
like ``Chicken Broth and Noodles With Echinacea'' and ``Creamy
Split Pea With St. John's Wort,'' and instructions to ``Heat 'N
Serve,'' what else would they be? But no. The label says: This is a
``Kitchen Prescription Herbal Supplement,'' not a soup.
</P>
<P>
   The soup-style supplements, made by the Hain Food Group of
Uniondale, N.Y., are among dozens of foods, or foodlike products,
landing on the market to capitalize on America's soaring enthusiasm
for herbal remedies.
</P>
<P>
   No longer content with fortifying products with vitamins or
minerals, food companies are starting to add herb-based substances
that purport to offer particular health benefits, benefits that in
some cases have not been proved. Companies also are reaching to
redefine older foods _ even foods as humdrum as ketchup _ in terms
of their health benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers can become confused because such products often fall
into a gray area created by a 1994 federal law governing the
labeling and sale of dietary supplements.
</P>
<P>
   If ``Kitchen Prescription'' was being marketed as a food with a
new additive or a new drug, the Food and Drug Administration could
require Hain to provide a raft of studies before the product got on
the market or put forth any claim of boosting health.
</P>
<P>
   But under the 1994 law, the FDA cannot restrict a dietary
supplement unless the agency receives complaints of harm. As a
result, many companies are deciding to market such products as
supplements, taking their chances with the FDA.
</P>
<P>
   Food companies regard ``functional foods'' _ those that offer
some highlighted health benefit, affecting disease or mood _ as
their biggest opportunity to increase sales since the fat-free
movement of the early 1990s. For an industry that over the last
decade has slogged along, growing just 5 percent in a good year,
the functional-foods business looks especially promising.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was anything that could add a needed dose of growth
to the food industry, this is it,'' said John M. McMillin, a food
analyst for Prudential Securities.
</P>
<P>
   While some experts voice concern about too much St. John's Wort
or calcium's getting into the food supply, others say such
overexposure is unlikely. ``If people consume these foods in
reasonable quantities, then safety is not the issue,'' said Dr.
Maureen Storey, a faculty fellow and assistant research professor
at Georgetown University's Center for Food and Nutrition Policy.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers have started to see a variety of interpretations,
ranging from older foods repackaged with claims on labels, to foods
with substances like herbal extracts added. Herbs like St. John's
Wort, touted as a mild anti-depressant, and ginkgo, advertised as
aiding memory, are turning up in cereals, soups and snacks.
</P>
<P>
   Companies see the interest in herbal medicine as a new way to
sell old products. ``They see it as product positioning,'' said
Clare Hasler, executive director of the functional foods for health
program at the University of Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   ``Companies will use ingredients based on the kinds of claims
they can make,'' said Scott Bass, a lawyer with Sidley &AMP; Austin in
Washington who helped write the 1994 Dietary Supplement Health and
Education Act. ``They will look for claims and then find the
ingredients, not vice versa.''
</P>
<P>
   Some say the FDA has lagged behind the surge in interest in such
foods, which began in earnest about two years ago. The subject is
not specifically addressed in regulations, although certain
substances acceptable in dietary supplements do not meet government
standards for food additives, which must be ``generally recognized
as safe.'' What is left is a large area of uncertainty, into which
companies are launching products like trial balloons.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA has strict regulations governing ``health claims,''
specific claims about a food or ingredient's ability to prevent or
affect disease. Companies are less eager to make health claims,
which require elaborate research and clinical trials to prove.
</P>
<P>
   But some say the FDA has not been specific enough about what
constitutes a ``structure-function claim,'' which purports to
influence certain functions, like those of the heart.
</P>
<P>
   A food that claimed to prevent heart disease would be making a
health claim; one that said it could lower cholesterol, which
affects heart function, could be making either a health claim or a
structure-function claim. Any health claim would require extensive
studies to support it. But for a structure-function claim, the
requirements would be less certain.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   ``The FDA is in the middle of sorting out what's the difference
between a structure claim and a health claim,'' said Steven L. Ink,
director of nutrition for the Quaker Oats Company in Chicago,
which, after a two-year process, got permission to use a health
claim on its oatmeal labels last year.
</P>
<P>
   The Grocery Manufacturers of America, a trade group, has made
clarifying the functional-food definition a priority, said Brian
Sansoni, a spokesman. The group is trying to stop the FDA from
adding regulations, fearing more cost and delay. ``We don't want
them to put functional foods in a special box with special
regulations, because it would be way too difficult for companies to
bring their products to the market,'' Sansoni said.
</P>
<P>
   For now, many companies are taking the easier path of marketing
foods as dietary supplements. ``They need to fit into the
established categories, and people are pushing them into the
dietary-supplement rules,'' Dr. Hasler said.
</P>
<P>
   Companies that are not specific to the drug or natural-food
business have noticed consumer interest in functional foods. In
1997, Campbell Soup Co. introduced a mail-order line of frozen
foods said to combat high blood pressure, high cholesterol and
diabetes, called Intelligent Quisine.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell dropped the line last year after a brief test period
suggested it would not be profitable. H.J. Heinz unveiled an
advertising campaign last month that discusses the benefits of
lycopene, an anti-oxidant found in processed tomatoes, in
``reducing the risk of prostate and cervical cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   Bass and others note that the Dietary Supplement Health and
Education Act steered around regulating foods, because the FDA has
historically been strict about the food supply, fearing the
possible dire side effects of ``overfortification.'' But that
concept has been overridden, he says, by changes in the ways and
reasons people eat.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the days of the fortification law, in 1972, the thinking
was that people eat for nutrition, and that's not why people eat
anymore,'' Bass said. ``People eat because they want to get
nutrition and also want to prevent ill health and stay out of
managed-care hospitals, which is what functional foods are all
about.''
</P>
<P>
   Without better definition of functional foods, the gate is open
for loose interpretations under the supplement law, which was not
its intent. ``It's not valid to have a box of cereal that says
`Dietary Supplement,' '' Bass said.
</P>
<P>
   At Hain, the decision to market supplement soup was made with an
awareness that the supplement law did not cover foods.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were very cautious in our label preparation to follow the
rules as closely as we could,'' said Myron Cooper, the company's
chief researcher and head of product development. ``I'm not saying
that in the eyes of the FDA we are right. We are putting these
supplements into products that are regularly consumed by people on
a moderate basis. There are other people putting it into candies
and snacks, and the FDA is concerned about overconsumption.''
</P>
<P>
   The label says ``Support your immune system(asterick) with a cup
of Kitchen Prescription today!'' The asterisk leads to this
postscript: ``This statement has not been evaluated by the Food and
Drug Administration. This product is not intended to diagnose,
treat, cure or prevent any disease.''
</P>
<P>
   The Quaker Oats Co.'s experience illustrates the financial
impact a health claim can have. In order to jump-start its
hot-cereal business, Quaker executives decided in 1995 to invest
the time and money required to get the FDA's approval for claiming
that its oatmeal contained nutrients that could lower cholesterol.
</P>
<P>
   The process included compiling research and sponsoring human
clinical trials. By 1997, the company had been cleared to add the
cholesterol-lowering claim _ the first specific one the FDA had
approved _ to its packaging, Ink of Quaker said.
</P>
<P>
   Quaker hot-cereal sales had declined in 1994 and 1995. In 1996,
with news of the health benefits circulating, sales rose 5 percent,
he said. The next year, with the claim on the package, sales rose
another 6 percent to 7 percent, he said. ``For a very mature
business, that was a pretty nice gain,'' he said.

WHEELCHAIR-BOUND MAN HELD IN THREE ROBBERIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARIANNE COSTANTINOU  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ They call him the Wheelchair Bandit, a
paraplegic and ex-convict accused of three Chinatown robberies in
recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But to Cuong Vinh Tran, the nickname and the notoriety are
nothing to brag about. He said he was innocent and his arrest was
more damning than any conviction or jail time he might face.
</P>
<P>
   Tran is a convicted felon and former gang member who took a
bullet in his back during a 1991 shootout with a rival gang. But
the Vietnamese refugee gets misty-eyed when he talks about his
elderly mother and the shame his publicized arrest has brought to
his family.
</P>
<P>
   In Asian culture, he said, bringing shame to the family name is
the ultimate crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I disgraced my family and disgraced my mom,'' Tran, 27,
said at the San Francisco County Jail.
</P>
<P>
   His arms and neck are covered with tattoos, some of them
insignias from gang days. The long sleeves of his jailhouse orange
sweat shirt conceal them. But there is no covering the most
prominent one, on his left thumb: MOM.
</P>
<P>
   Since his arrest on Feb. 1, Tran said, his biggest concern has
been his mother, and how worried she must be. ``I don't have the
face or guts to call her right now,'' he said in a jailhouse
interview Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Tran denies that he is the Wheelchair Bandit. But according to
police reports, two victims have identified him from a photo spread
of six young Asian men sporting thin mustaches like his. The third
set of victims, a couple, would not cooperate with the police.
</P>
<P>
   In one of these incidents, on Jan. 26, the bandit brandished a
black semi-automatic handgun, the police said. In the other two
cases, on Jan. 20 and Feb. 1, he warned his victims that he was
going to shoot them.
</P>
<P>
   In all three robberies, the police said, the suspect approached
and fled in a wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
   All of the victims were Chinese, and the bandit spoke to them in
Cantonese.
</P>
<P>
   Two victims described the suspect as speaking with a Vietnamese
accent. It is the same description a victim gave in 1997, according
to a police report at that time, when Tran was arrested and pleaded
guilty to robbing a man of $300 in Chinatown.
</P>
<P>
   In that crime, the suspect was driving a car, and had robbed a
pedestrian he had motioned to his window. Tran said he didn't
commit that crime either, but copped a plea for a shortened jail
sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Tran served eight months in jail for the 1997 robbery, and got
out on Dec. 6, he said. Since then, he has been staying with his
mother.
</P>
<P>
   Tran was a member of the Wah Ching, a Chinese street gang, and
later, the Viet Ching, an offshoot made up of young Vietnamese,
said Inspector Wayne Hom of the San Francisco Gang Task Force.
</P>
<P>
   Hom, who has been with the Gang Task Force since 1980, remembers
when Tran was a gang member.
</P>
<P>
   Tran was a follower, Hom said, a foot soldier who would
dutifully take orders but was neither ambitious enough nor ruthless
enough to be a leader.
</P>
<P>
   Tran stayed with the gang until he was 20. He quit the day he
was shot, on Aug. 29, 1991.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   During a fight with a rival gang, he was shot in the back. The
bullet from the .44-caliber Magnum shattered his spine and pierced
his kidney and colon. For a month he was in the hospital near
death, Tran said, battling infections and high fevers.
</P>
<P>
   When he regained consciousness, he learned he was paralyzed in
both legs and had received a colostomy.
</P>
<P>
   His father was sick with worry _ and anger. He died two years
ago of cancer. Tran is certain that he is the malignancy that
killed his father.
</P>
<P>
   But his mother was always understanding, Tran said. She loved
him, no matter what.
</P>
<P>
   After the shooting, he tried to stay out of trouble. But it was
hard, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although paralyzed, Tran said he still has gruesome pain in his
legs. He said he's taken crack cocaine to soothe the pain and
forget his troubles. He had to quit the habit in jail, but as soon
as he got out, he couldn't stay away.
</P>
<P>
   The police said they found a crack pipe in his wheelchair when
he was arrested Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Tran said friends help him pay for the crack, that he didn't
need to rob people. The three robberies by the Wheelchair Bandit
were not lucrative: $17, $10, $8, and a silver necklace worth $20.
In one of the holdups, the bandit only asked for $10 to get some
food, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   Tran had pledged to his mother to stay off the streets and off
the drugs once he got out of jail, but he couldn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sweet-talk her when I'm in jail. Then I come home, I don't
follow her rules,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But in a wheelchair, with no high school diploma and no job
skills, he couldn't stay home and do nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I just stay home, I just go crazy,'' said Tran, who added
that he would like to become an auto mechanic.

PERSONAL HEALTH: NATURAL? SAFE? DRUG FREE? IT MIGHT BE NONE OF THE
ABOVE  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By JANE E BRODY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Whatever it is you may seek _ a memory boost, weight loss,
stress relief, immune enhancement, mood elevation, sexual
stimulation or therapy for your ailing heart, there is an herb
being sold as the ``natural drug-free'' answer to your prayers. But
experts warn that an ill-informed foray into the ever-expanding
world of botanical medicines can end up causing more problems than
it solves.
</P>
<P>
   Herbal products _ which are sold as dietary supplements, not
drugs _ are virtually unregulated, leaving the fox (in this case,
the manufacturer) to guard the hen house. While many companies are
conscientious about providing high-quality products free of
dangerous contaminants and containing what the label lists _ no
more, no less _ others market cheaply made products that contain
little or none of the stated ingredient or, worse, too much. One
study of 64 ``pure'' ginseng products found that 60 percent of them
were so watered down with cheaper herbs as to be worthless.
</P>
<P>
   Other products on the market are known health hazards. For
example, sassafras, still widely available in health food stores,
contains a carcinogen, safrole, that was banned decades ago by the
Food and Drug Administration from use in foods.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, hundreds of botanical products now sold in the
United States have been tested and found wanting or have never been
adequately tested to determine their effectiveness or safety,
especially if used for more than a few weeks. Although health
claims cannot legally be made on product labels or in
advertisements, hundreds of articles, books, pamphlets and
newsletters attribute all kinds of poorly documented medical
benefits to herbal products. Even without prospect of insurance
reimbursement, herbs sell widely to gullible consumers desperate
for a simple solution to their complex health problems and
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, different parts of a plant or different methods of
preparation can yield different effects. As Consumer Reports on
Health has pointed out, dandelion root acts as a laxative while its
leaves contain a diuretic. An herb prepared as a tea may contain
none of the active ingredients if those ingredients do not dissolve
in water.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, anyone who is considering joining the 70 million
Americans now using herbal products had best learn as much as
possible about the herb's effects, side effects, drug interactions
and conditions in which its use is inadvisable _ as well as check
on the producer's reputation.
</P>
<P>
   This may be the greatest challenge faced by a potential consumer
of medicinal herbs. First, how can you tell what a product may do
for you? By law, labels can state only how an herb may affect
bodily structure or function. It cannot claim any direct medical or
health benefit. Does the statement ``promotes prostate well-being''
mean that the product is useful for men with symptoms of an
enlarged prostate, i.e., the need to urinate frequently and
urgently? Or does it imply that the product may help to prevent
prostate cancer?
</P>
<P>
   Also, because no specific health claims are made, labels are not
required to carry health warnings. Without some independent
research, you may be unable to tell whether it is safe to use a
particular herb if, say, you have heart disease or diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   Because the label is of little help, turn to reliable sources of
information about herbs. I recommend two books by a
university-based pharmacognosist with no financial ties to the herb
industry: ``Tyler's Herbs of Choice'' by Dr. Varro Tyler and James
E. Robbers, and ``Tyler's Honest Herbal'' by Tyler and Steven
Foster, both published by Haworth Press in Binghamton, N.Y. Next,
find a reliable manufacturer. Although there are no guarantees, you
are likely to get the best products from large companies that have
been in business for many years. Ask the proprietor of your
pharmacy or health-food store for recommendations. Don't shop for
bargains, especially for costly herbs like ginseng. You're likely
to pay good money for a bad product.
</P>
<P>
   Although again it is not a guarantee of quality, look for
standardized products that state the amount of active ingredient in
each dose. Avoid dried herbs, as in teas, bulk herbs or powdered
herbs in capsules. They deteriorate rapidly and are likely to be
inactive. The most potent products are made from fresh herbs:
liquid and solid extracts, tinctures and freeze-dried herbs in
capsules. Before you buy any herbal product, check the expiration
date.
</P>
<P>
   If you are thinking of trying an herbal remedy for a known or
suspected health problem, start by obtaining a diagnosis from a
qualified doctor. Do not rely on an herbologist, naturopath,
chiropractor, pharmacist or proprietor in a health food store to
diagnose the problem. Many of the anecdotal reports of effective
use of herbal products come from people who did not have a health
problem in the first place. In other cases, people have unwittingly
self-treated serious diseases with useless herbal products and thus
delayed a correct diagnosis and effective medical care.
</P>
<P>
   Always consult your doctor before you start to use an herbal
product. It may have adverse effects on an underlying health
problem or interact badly with other medication you take. Also, if
a problem develops while you are using an herbal product, stop
taking it right away and see your doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Herbs contain drugs that can cause side effects, allergic
reactions and hazardous drug interactions. For example, garlic,
which acts as an anticoagulant in foods or botanicals, can add to
the activity of a blood-thinning drug and cause excessive bleeding.
Or someone taking medication to control diabetes could experience a
dangerous reduction in blood sugar if ginseng was used.
</P>
<P>
   All suspected adverse reactions to herbal products should be
reported to the Food and Drug Administration, which has a
monitoring program called Medwatch. Call the toll-free number,
(800) FDA-1088, or contact the program on line at
www.fda.gov/medwatch.
</P>
<P>
   Follow dosage recommendations on the label. More is not better;
it may even be lethal. Do not take herbs for longer periods than
experts recommend. And avoid mixtures of herbs; they generally have
not been tested for safety or effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you have no known health problem and have experienced no
known side effects, be sure to tell your doctor about any herbal
products you use. When a routine blood test turns up an abnormal
reading, you could end up having costly tests for a problem caused
by an herb the doctor didn't know you were taking.
</P>
<P>
   Never give herbs to babies or children except under medical
supervision. Also, do not take herbal products if you are pregnant
or trying to become pregnant or if you are breast-feeding; few if
any of these products have been tested for safety during pregnancy
and lactation.

PORN BECOMES TOPIC A IN BAPTIST SUNDAY SCHOOL CLASSES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM JONES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   An X-rated Sunday school lesson? Not exactly. But Southern
Baptists have been talking about the ``secret sin'' of pornography
in their Sunday school classes nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   A Sunday school lesson on ``How to Reject Pornography'' for
young adults and those older says that many church members _
particularly men _ are consumers of pornography.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realize pornography is an issue facing society. And given
the number of users of pornography, we know people in the church
use it, too,'' Ross McLaren of Nashville, a Baptist biblical
studies specialist, said last week. ``Even children have access to
it now, through the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   McLaren quotes a finding from U.S. News &AMP; World Report that 41
percent of men and 16 percent of women purchase erotic materials
each year. He also cites James Lambert's ``Porn in America,''
published in 1997 by Huntington House, which says that pornography
is an $8 billion-a-year business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since men are 90-95 percent of the users of porn ... the
church needs to recognize that many men in our congregations have
the same problems with porn that many outside the church have,''
Lambert wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Pornography is a bigger problem than most people think, the
Sunday school lesson contends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pornography is no longer a back-street industry limited to
inner-city bookstores or sleazy movie theaters,'' it declares. ``It
is available in your local video store, at the convenience store in
your community and on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   The lesson adds: ``Some may still think of porn as the `girlie
magazine' they discovered in junior high school. Others may feel
that pornography is OK if not viewed by children. Still others may
view pornography as harmless entertainment.''
</P>
<P>
   Pornography does seem to be more available to those who don't
normally visit bookstores specializing in erotic materials.
Advertisements for porn sites are showing up on E-mails in the
workplace. People are worried about children calling up
pornographic offerings on home computers.
</P>
<P>
   But discussing pornography in Sunday school?
</P>
<P>
   ``We had teachers who were not comfortable with it,'' said
McLaren, a staff member of Lifeway Resources, formerly the Southern
Baptist Sunday School Board, which published the lesson. The lesson
wasn't presented to Sunday school class embers under 18. But boys
ages 12 and 13 are frequent users of pornography, the lesson says.
</P>
<P>
   The Bible is quoted often in the lesson. One section titled
``Discipline Your Eyes'' quotes Job 31: ``I made a covenant with my
eyes not to look lustfully at a girl. ... Does he not see my ways
and count my every step.''
</P>
<P>
   Pornography is powerful, the writers note, because it builds off
a natural sexual desire.
</P>
<P>
   Baptists, as might be expected, have a broad definition of
pornography, They include so-called soft porn, such as Playboy
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Pornography, the lesson says, is ``any portrayal of the human
body or human behavior that cheapens human sexuality, condones or
encourages sexual immorality, and degrades the God-given value of
men, women and children by identifying them merely as sources of
sexual gratification.''
</P>
<P>
   The messages of pornography listed in the lesson include: ``Sex
anywhere, anytime with anybody is a good thing. Sex has no
consequences. Fidelity is boring.''
</P>
<P>
   The lesson includes an article by John E. Wolf III, a
businessman and civic leader from Oklahoma City, who says his
secret love for pornography almost wrecked his marriage. He tells
of being hooked on pornography as a child and then continuing the
habit as an adult after he became a faithful Baptist churchgoer.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf's article, titled How to Live a Porn-Free Life, says he
conquered the problem through prayer, Bible study and counseling
after his pornography obsession was discovered by his wife. He
urges others fascinated by pornography to follow the same course.
</P>
<P>
   ``My experience is that pornography is one of the biggest secret
sins of the church,'' he said.

ESSAY: A MAJOR FRACAS OVER A SMALL, BUT NOT QUITE MINOR, PLANET 
</HEADLINE>
  (The Science Times) 
(HLW) 
 By MALCOLM W. BROWNE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A rose by any other name would smell as sweet, and Pluto by any
other name (``Minor Planet No. 10,000,'' for instance,) would still
be a no-account little dot in the sky you couldn't see without a
good telescope.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent weeks, astronomers have been partly agog over
rumors that planetary catalogers were plotting to send Pluto back
to the minor leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Pluto, generally acknowledged to be the ninth planet in the
solar system, is the only one discovered by an American (Clyde
Tombaugh in 1930), and American astronomers have been particularly
put out during the past couple of months by suggestions from a
section of the Paris-based International Astronomical Union that
maybe Pluto should be officially listed as No. 10,000 in the roster
of minor planets.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal, which stirred up a hornet's nest of astronomical
politicking, was made by Dr. Brian G. Marsden, an Englishman who
directs the Minor Planet Center of the Harvard-Smithsonian
Astrophysical Observatory in Cambridge, Mass. The center operates
under the aegis of the International Astronomical Association.
</P>
<P>
   The Minor Planet Center, a clearinghouse for all observations
and measurements of minor planets, keeps an official tally of
``Small Objects'' (called either asteroids or minor planets) whose
orbits are precisely known.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, 9,999 such objects are listed (most of them in
the Asteroid Belt between Mars and Jupiter), and the center plans a
ceremony for the designation of No. 10,000. Since Pluto has some of
the characteristics of asteroids, Marsden would like to see it
accorded dual citizenship, as a planet and as No. 10,000 on the
small-object list. Because growing numbers of Pluto-like objects
are being discovered in the outer reaches of the solar system, and
because Marsden expects that eventually objects as large or larger
than Pluto will turn up, he argues that Pluto should be given
special status as first among equals in the Minor Planet league by
assigning it the number 10,000.
</P>
<P>
   His idea was that Pluto's ``Social Security number,'' as he
calls it, could be bestowed on the object as part of a ceremony on
March 2, when the identity of No. 10,000 will be announced.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal caused an uproar.
</P>
<P>
   While some astronomers called it reasonable, others, including
Dr. Donald K. Yeomans of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena,
Calif., deemed the idea an outrage.
</P>
<P>
   The Committee of the Division for Planetary Sciences of the
American Astronomical Society denounced the proposal, saying:
``This action would undoubtedly be viewed by the broader scientific
community and the general public as a reclassification of Pluto
from a major planet to a minor planet. We feel that there is little
scientific or historical justification for such an action.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the anti-10,000 party gained clear ascendancy when
the Secretariat of the International Astronomical Union announced
that its Small Bodies Names Committee of the Division of Planetary
Systems Sciences had ``decided against assigning any Minor Planet
Number to Pluto.''
</P>
<P>
   But Marsden was not giving up without a struggle. A few hours
after the union's announcement from Paris, he issued an appeal to
rank-and-file astronomers who receive official communications from
his organization to help with the designation of No. 10,000. He
invited e-mail responses from ordinary astronomers (as
distinguished, he said, from astronomical bureaucrats) to whether
No. 10,000 should be Pluto, or if not, what other object deserved
the honor.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens, the dispute, which has left bad blood,
involves pigeonholing and semantics, not science.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone agrees that Pluto is like major planets in that it is
spherical, that it is a lot bigger than the garden variety of
``minor planets,'' that it has a thin atmosphere and that it has a
large moon _ traits that distinguish it from common asteroids.
</P>
<P>
   But everyone also agrees that Pluto is much smaller than all the
major planets, that it has a wildly eccentric orbit that tilts far
out of the plane of the solar system and that it is made mostly of
ice _ characteristics that seem to show closer kinship with a
family of ``Trans-Neptunian Objects'' than with the eight main
planets: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and
Neptune. Trans-Neptunian Objects, of which nearly 100 have been
discovered since the first one was found in 1992, are minor planets
beyond the orbit of Neptune.
</P>
<P>
   Some say the current spate of scholarly snarling stems more from
national pride than from scientific issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Pluto had been discovered by a Spaniard or Austrian, I
doubt whether American astronomers would object to reclassifying it
as a minor planet,'' one astronomer privately acknowledged.
``Before he died, Clyde Tombaugh himself said he was reconciled to
the perception of Pluto as one of many Kuiper Belt objects _ minor
denizens of the outer solar system.''
</P>
<P>
   But the dispute also hinges on language. To some people, even
scientists, the qualifying words ``minor'' and ``lesser'' seem to
connote inferiority.
</P>
<P>
   One of the satellite galaxies of our Milky Way used to be called
the ``Lesser Magellanic Cloud,'' but the name apparently sounded
demeaning _ perhaps even politically incorrect _ so it was changed
to ``Small Magellanic Cloud.''
</P>
<P>
   Fans of the English language point out that even ``lesser'' and
``minor'' things can be very good.
</P>
<P>
   In geography, there is nothing inferior about the Lesser
Antilles or the Lesser Caucasus Mountains. The Lesser Sunda
Archipelago is the sole habitat of the Komodo dragon, a monstrous
man-eating lizard much in demand by zoos around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Music lacking minor keys would be impoverished, and minor league
baseball can be more exciting than games played in the overpaid
majors.
</P>
<P>
   Religious processions rooted in ancient Roman tradition that
continued through the Christian era included the Major Rogation,
held on April 25, and the Minor Rogation, on the 37th day after
Easter; who is to say which is the more inspiring parade?
</P>
<P>
   In Swift's Gulliver's Travels, rival parties of midgets battle
over whether an egg should be opened at the broad end or the narrow
end. Disputes over the designation of Pluto, named for the dirty
old god of death and the underworld, seem just as silly.

SALES GIANT SEES TUPPERWARE AS TICKET TO A `NORMAL LIFE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CRAIG MARINE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ There is Tupperware made out of Lexan, the same
stuff used in the windshields of fighter planes and in bullet-proof
glass.
</P>
<P>
   Tupperware is not what it used to be. Just ask Denise Lum-Kan, a
San Francisco woman who has turned her dedication to the kitchen
containers into a near-six-figure salary and two company vans _ not
to mention all the trips to headquarters in Orlando, Fla., and
visits to the Tupperware museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once Tupperware gets into your blood,'' Lum-Kan said, ``it
never leaves it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounds toxic, but given the way the product has transformed her
life in less than three years, she said: ``With Tupperware, you can
have it all.''
</P>
<P>
   Between her Tupperware demonstration skills, her charm, her good
looks and her obvious dedication to the product, it was no surprise
that the company picked her to star in its first infomercial.
</P>
<P>
   Lum-Kan's meteoric rise to Tupperware Goddess began innocently
enough. Always a hustler, she was taking business classes at San
Francisco State University while running her own enterprises. She
decided to host a Tupperware party _ the hostess gets a free set
worth maybe $50 _ and once things were organized, jokingly asked
her Tupperware connection what she was making on Lum-Kan's $300
worth of sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said she would make $100, and I realized I was in the
wrong end of the business,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   With that, she became a ``consultant,'' helping three friends to
host parties while she pocketed more of the profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time, I just figured I would take the money and run,''
she admitted. ``I was still running my other businesses and had no
idea that Tupperware was going to be my ticket out of the rat
race.''
</P>
<P>
   She progressively climbed the ladder _ Tupperware promotion is
based solely on sales and doesn't involve any kind of corporate
approval. Move the goods and move up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great. You don't have to wait for someone to die or
retire to get ahead. That's one of the things I like about it the
most,'' Lum-Kan said.
</P>
<P>
   Before she knew it, she was named to her current position as
senior executive manager. Next, she aspires to diamond crown
manager, and the only rung left after that is an area
distributorship.
</P>
<P>
   So what is the secret to her success? Perhaps the answer comes
when Lum-Kan is asked if her own house is filled floor to ceiling
with Tupperware.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh no,'' she said. ``I hardly have any at all. That's what I
always tell people, not to buy more than they will really use. If
you end up selling them a ton and they never use it, there is a
good chance they will feel resentful. This way, if they are happy,
it makes for much better word-of-mouth references.''
</P>
<P>
   Lum-Kan said the main reason she is so dedicated to the company
is the freedom it gives her. She can set her hours, there is nobody
telling her what to do, and any pressure to succeed is
self-imposed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can lead a normal life. My husband and I are talking about
having kids, and I want to be a stay-at-home mom,'' she said. ``And
there are other parts of my life I've been interested in pursuing,
maybe some modeling or acting, and this gives me the time to have a
life. I really feel incredibly lucky.''
</P>
<P>
   Lum-Kan even has a social theory about what she calls ``the
resurgence of Tupperware'' in the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the '80s people were more wrapped up in themselves, they
were more focused inward, socializing wasn't as important to
them,'' she said. ``In the '90s, people are coming back to being
sociable, so a Tupperware party is a natural extension of that.
That's what's so great about this job _ going to work is like going
to a party.''

 By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ In a kind of summit conference on the universe, the
world's leading cosmologists have assessed their theories and
pronounced them healthy, saying that a wealth of new research that
at first seemed puzzling turns out to strengthen the intellectual
framework that has shaped decades of debate about the origin and
evolution of the universe.
</P>
<P>
   The astonishing discovery last year that the universe's
expansion is not slowing down, as assumed, but seems to be speeding
up jolted theorists of the Big Bang whose concept for the explosive
beginning and expanding evolution of the universe had, as Sir
Martin Rees of Cambridge University in England put it, ``lived
dangerously for 30 years.''
</P>
<P>
   An indispensable corollary, introduced in 1981 and known as
inflation, had breathed new vitality into the theory with a
plausible explanation of how, in its first microseconds, the
universe made the transition from initially featureless conditions
to the ripples out of which mighty galaxies would grow. But
scientists had been short on evidence to support the reality of
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   So, in a six-day meeting that ended here on Wednesday, the
cosmologists were relieved to find their inflationary Big Bang
theory more robust than ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two years ago, we couldn't have had this meeting _ we didn't
have the data,'' said Dr. Michael S. Turner of the University of
Chicago, who organized the Pritzker Symposium and Workshop on the
Status of Inflationary Cosmology. ``Now we do, and the data say we
have a flat universe.''
</P>
<P>
   Flatness is the large-scale geometry for the universe predicted
by the inflation concept. It means that the expanding universe will
not collapse or thin out into infinity, but should maintain a
gravitational balance between the two alternatives through a
coasting expansion.
</P>
<P>
   The cosmologists were also a little surprised by the outbreak of
good feelings over issues that used to provoke intellectual
donnybrooks. No one questioned the Big Bang itself, which would not
have been the case earlier in the decade.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few entered mild objections when Dr. Alan Guth of the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, originator of the first
inflation concept, proclaimed, ``Everything about inflation is
incredibly solid,'' adding, ``It's hard to imagine any
alternative.''
</P>
<P>
   Yielding to this triumphal spirit, some of the bolder theorists
seemed eager to crack even grander cosmic mysteries, like the
possible existence of many more universes. Perhaps believing that
cosmology abhors a vacuum of dispute, these bold ones stunned their
colleagues by recommending the controversial anthropic principle be
applied in determining the nature and properties of forces and
matter in the universe.
</P>
<P>
   In anthropic reasoning, simply put, the physical laws of the
universe must be such that they allow for the existence of humans.
</P>
<P>
   The primordial spurt of inflation would seem to meet the
anthropic standard. Inflation was supposed to leave on space an
imprint of ripples, temperature fluctuations as microwave
signatures of slight density variations.
</P>
<P>
   The Cosmic Background Explorer spacecraft detected these
signatures in 1991, and more detailed observations recently have
convinced scientists that these are the seedbeds of all the large
structure that eventually appeared in the universe, the stars and
galaxies and clusters of galaxies. Without them, there would be no
intelligent life.
</P>
<P>
   Cosmologists had thus traced the ultimate origin of galaxies
back to the first instant after the Big Bang, and inflation, they
said, had passed a critical test.
</P>
<P>
   They also felt they were coming close, or close enough, to
knowing the age of the universe: probably somewhere between 13
billion and 15 billion years old.
</P>
<P>
   Two teams of astronomers still feud over differing calculations,
with Dr. Wendy Freedman of the Carnegie Observatories in Pasadena,
Calif., preparing refined data for a report in June.
</P>
<P>
   But at least new research shows that, contrary to earlier
reported estimates that were paradoxical and highly embarrassing,
the oldest stars are not older than the universe.
</P>
<P>
   All could agree that the evidence of a low-density universe is
overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   There is not enough mass in ordinary matter, the stuff of stars,
planets and people, or even the hypothesized exotic particles
called cold dark matter to stop the universe from expanding
forever.
</P>
<P>
   If standard models of inflationary cosmology are correct, a
universe that does not eventually collapse on itself (a closed
universe) or expand forever into infinity (an open one) should have
a critical density, expressed as omega equals one, and a flat
geometry. The gravity of a critical density should slow expansion
to a kind of coasting equilibrium between collapse and vanishing
infinity.
</P>
<P>
   By most measures reported at the meeting, based on studies of
the light and motions of galaxy clusters, the density of mass in
the universe may be no more than 20 percent to 30 percent or at
most 40 percent of the theorized critical density. Only 5 percent
is in the readily observed form of luminous stars, and perhaps
another 10 percent is composed largely of the interstellar clouds
of hydrogen gas. The rest is presumably mostly cold dark matter,
unknown and so far undetectable.
</P>
<P>
   Even the discovery, reported last year, that pervasive subatomic
particles known as neutrinos have a slight mass does not add enough
to the cosmic density to be significant, scientists said.
</P>
<P>
   This shortfall in matter density has led theorists to revive a
concept that Einstein had entertained and discarded, a kind of
hypothesized vacuum energy known as the cosmological constant. No
one has detected it or been able to explain its properties, except
that the cosmological constant must be evenly distributed energy
that exerts a negative pressure to counteract the restraining
gravity of matter.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of evidence for an accelerating universe, Rees said,
``Stock in the cosmological constant has gone up enormously.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Early last year, two rival astronomy teams reported observations
of supernovas, or exploding stars, both near and far. The measure
of their velocities provided the first direct, if tentative,
evidence of an accelerating expansion of the cosmos.
</P>
<P>
   Turner called this the ``smoking gun'' for something else in the
universe besides matter, ordinary or exotic, and that something
must be the ``missing energy.'' This could be the unvarying
cosmological constant or some other form of repulsive energy in
empty space, like the hypothesized quintessence, which supposedly
varies over time.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the standard model for an all-matter flat universe
is dead _ but lives on among cosmologists as a
matter-plus-exotic-energy flat universe. Still, some scientists
cautioned against writing off the possibility of an open universe _
what if there is not enough vacuum energy to reach critical
density? Though the original inflation models hinged on a flat
universe, theorists have now suggested ways to have an open
universe within the framework of inflation.
</P>
<P>
   With so many important questions still unanswered, Dr. P. James
E. Peebles of Princeton University worried about premature
celebration of a theory triumphant. ``This is a wildly healthy
field, but still in its early days,'' he said. ``We've got a lot to
do yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Comforted by the congruence of data and theory, nonetheless, the
cosmologists took a break one evening for a festive dinner.
Breathtaking manifestations of the current epoch of cosmic
evolution spread about them.
</P>
<P>
   The full moon, an infrequent blue moon, cast a path of
shimmering light on the waters of Lake Michigan, and the sparkling
towers of the city skyline loomed in the distance, perhaps evoking
anthropic speculation.
</P>
<P>
   The after-dinner speaker was an astronomer, one of the searchers
of the sky whose observations inspire or confound the theorists.
This time he brought them to laughter, and a moment of humility.
Even Dr. Stephen W. Hawking of Cambridge University, mute and
paralyzed in a wheelchair nearby, managed a broad grin.
</P>
<P>
   The astronomer, Dr. Allan R. Sandage of the Carnegie
Observatories , was a protege of Edwin P. Hubble, whose 1929
discovery that distant galaxies were moving apart as the entire
universe expanded led eventually to the Big Bang theory. Sandage
reached deeper into history than Hubble in reminding the
cosmologists that at least in broad outline, their scenario of
cosmic history was a lot like St. Augustine's 1,600 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The universe was brought into being in a less than fully
formed state,'' Augustine wrote, ``but was gifted with the capacity
to transform itself from unformed matter into a truly marvelous
array of structures and life forms.''
</P>
<P>
   Though they laughed at hearing how Augustine had anticipated
their work, the cosmologists were not appreciably humbled. They
knew they had at their command instruments of exploration,
telescopes and spacecraft and particle accelerators, to fill in
many of the details of cosmic history unimagined by Augustine. And
they expected to make more progress in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   As in the past, different but complementary styles of practicing
science will be brought to bear in approaching the mysteries of the
universe: the grand pursuit of the big picture and the plodding
collection and evaluation of data.
</P>
<P>
   In one example, Rees of Cambridge divided today's community of
cosmologists and astrophysicists into chess players and mud
wrestlers.
</P>
<P>
   The chess players, many of them particle physicists, practice
fundamental cosmology, trying to define initial conditions and the
origin and nature of the early density perturbations that seeded
all subsequent structure in the universe. They also strive to
characterize the amount and properties of matter and energy shaping
the universe.
</P>
<P>
   The mud wrestlers have what Rees called the messier job of
environmental cosmology. They seek to explain the dynamics of how
and when stars and galaxies and galactic clusters came to be a
billion years or less after the Big Bang.
</P>
<P>
   Rees predicted that in two years the chess players may pin down
the densities of dark matter and ordinary matter in the universe.
Then scientists should be able to concentrate on understanding the
composition of both matter and energy in the universe: what exotic
particles constitute dark matter and whether the vacuum energy
component is in the form of a cosmological constant or something
even more mysterious.
</P>
<P>
   For the mud wrestlers of environmental cosmology, some of their
breakthrough insights may have to await the development of even
more powerful telescopes, like the Hubble Space Telescope's
successor being planned for 2007. So far, telescopes peering deeper
into the observable universe have yet to glimpse the dawn of star
and galaxy formation.
</P>
<P>
   Much is yet to be learned, Rees said in an interview, about the
complex gas dynamics over large scales and feedback processes that
are responsible for matter coalescing into stars and galaxies,
without which there would be no universe as it is known today.
Understanding this is ``like weather prediction,'' he observed,
``and we know how hard that is.''
</P>
<P>
   If Sandage introduced the element of humility, Peebles of
Princeton ended the symposium on a note of introspection about how
successful science, particularly physics, is done. His division of
the community was between classicists and romantics, defining the
two with a musical analogy: Bach was a classicist, inventive but
following a sharply defined paradigm, and Wagner a romantic,
unbounded, soaring from conventional forms.
</P>
<P>
   ``The parallels with our present situation are absolutely
uncanny,'' Peebles said.
</P>
<P>
   The Big Bang, to his way of thinking, ``was discovered in a
romantic way, a brilliant philosophical idea that has been
remarkably successful because it is spectacularly simple.''
</P>
<P>
   Soaring chords of theory were followed by long interludes of
experimentation and observation, the work of classicists. When this
raised sticky questions, the romantics stepped in with new concepts
like inflation and then dark matter.
</P>
<P>
   Even if recent empirical evidence from classicists did seem to
fortify standard inflationary cosmology, Peebles was troubled that
inflation theory was being so readily accepted, without being fully
tested, mainly in the absence of a viable alternative. ``I find
that distasteful,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Peebles' skeptical tone did not seem to upset other
cosmologists. ``He's half enthusiast, half curmudgeon who wants to
keep us honest,'' said Turner of Chicago. ``He wants us to slow
down the train before it goes over some cliff.''
</P>
<P>
   Soaring again above the playing fields of hard-won data and
interpretation, the irrepressible romantics of cosmology gave their
colleagues a start by proposing that serious thought be given to
the anthropic principle and the possibility of countless parallel
universes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The romantics see inflation as a done deal,'' Turner said in
an interview. ``Now they're dreaming about the most expansive
implications of inflation.''
</P>
<P>
   Astrophysicists have generally dismissed the anthropic principle
as unscientific, either obvious and proving nothing or hopelessly
mystical. At the symposium, they greeted some references to it with
mock hissing and hoots and cracked jokes about the A-word. But the
credentials of the advocates guaranteed them a hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking through a computerized voice-synthesizer, Hawking
acknowledged that inflation ``does a good job'' solving some of the
problems with the Big Bang model, but noted that by itself
inflation places no limits on matter, the energy vacuum or the
amplitude of the density fluctuations out of which galactic
structure grew.
</P>
<P>
   ``We might as well use the anthropic principle for fine-tuning
problems of the hot Big Bang,'' he said. ``I doubt very much we
will find a nonanthropic explanation for the cosmological
constant.''
</P>
<P>
   The British cosmologist Dr. Brandon Carter coined the term
anthropic principle in 1974 as astrophysicists began contemplating
the concept. Since life exists in at least one place in the
universe, the physical laws governing the universe, the fundamental
forces and particles and so forth have to be such to account for
the evolution of stars and galaxies or anything else essential to
the emergence of intelligent life.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Andrei Linde of Stanford University, a leading inflation
theorist, cautioned that the principle should be invoked with care,
but that it seemed sensible to assess all cosmic parameters, all
elements brought to bear in support of theories, with one view in
mind, namely, ``what allows us to be here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Only the anthropic principle plus inflation will explain the
universe as we see it,'' Linde concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Both Linde and Guth of MIT have taken another romantic plunge
with the idea of ``eternal inflation.'' If an explosive event like
the Big Bang, followed immediately by a brief phase of rapid cosmic
expansion, happened once, they posit that it could happen an
infinite number of times, and may well have.
</P>
<P>
   Conceiving of an inflation that cannot reproduce bubbles of new
universes many times, Guth said, seemed ``as implausible as
discovering a species of rabbits incapable of reproduction.'' He
paused. ``So universes reproduce like rabbits.''
</P>
<P>
   From the front row, Dr. Rocky Kolb of the University of Chicago
piped up, ``You mean, pull it out of the hat.''
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, I'll look for a different analogy some other time,'' Guth
responded.
</P>
<P>
   If there are parallel universes elsewhere, each would have
started with its own big bang, grown from a separate inflationary
bubble and probably acquired entirely different laws of physics.
Ours may not be a typical universe. Instead of the four dimensions
of space-time in this universe, Linde suggested, other universes
could have as many as 11 dimensions; some could be
dimension-challenged, with only 3. Some universes could be
stillborn or unstable and short-lived, thus lacking the time to
evolve stars and planets where life might emerge.
</P>
<P>
   It could be, invoking anthropic reasoning, that a universe must
have, say, a cosmological constant of precisely the right value and
properties to support intelligent life.

<P>
   The romantics may have outdone themselves with their eternal
inflation and a multiverse instead of a universe. Even if
scientists established sound reasons for their existence, parallel
universes would be discrete and widely separated entities, beyond
communication with each other.
</P>
<P>
   No one in this universe, cosmologists said, would be able to
gain any direct knowledge of other universes, though in time the
theorists might make a persuasive case for their existence.
</P>
<P>
   Human beings would then have discovered the ultimate limit to
their knowing what is out there. They might find solace, though, if
there is anything to the anthropic principle, in thinking that
theirs is a defining presence in the one universe they know and are
trying to comprehend.

WHEN A CELL DOES AN EMBRYO'S WORK, A DEBATE IS BORN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.J., Md., Canada)   (af)  
 By GINA KOLATA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Six years ago, scientists in Canada published a remarkable
paper. In it, they reported that they had grown entire mice from
individual cells that they had plucked from mouse embryos.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, it was seen by those in the small world of mouse
researchers as a technological tour de force. But now, as
scientists are eyeing human embryo cells as material for research,
the experiment is giving rise to a thorny philosophical question.
</P>
<P>
   If you can grow a mouse from a single embryo cell, you should in
theory be able to grow a human from a single human embryo cell. And
if you can grow a human from a single embryo cell, is that cell the
moral equivalent of an entire embryo? Where, in other words, does
the potential for human life lie?
</P>
<P>
   There are no simple answers anymore, ethicists say.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a certain ambiguity or complexity that wasn't
appreciated before,'' said Dr. Thomas Murray, the director of the
Hastings Center, an organization that studies ethical issues.
</P>
<P>
   But even debating the question is a political mine field, some
experts say. The answers can determine whether scientists can go
ahead with experiments on isolated human embryo cells that they
hope will revolutionize medicine or whether they will be required
to treat single human embryo cells with the same sort of restraint
that they treat a human embryo.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who hold a pro-life view regard the human embryo from
the moment of conception as a fully protectable human being,'' said
Dr. Ronald Green, director of the Ethics Institute of Dartmouth
College. And so discussions of whether embryo cells are the
equivalent of embryos or the equivalent of human tissue, like skin
or muscle, are being carried out with the abortion debates looming
in the background. ``That's a tremendous pressure in these
discussion,'' Green said.
</P>
<P>
   The mouse embryo cells that the Canadian scientists studied were
of a special type, known as stem cells, that in theory can grow
into any tissues or organs, although not _ most assumed until the
experiment six years ago _ into an entire healthy mouse.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers have worked with mouse embryonic stem cells for
years, but only recently have scientists been able to isolate human
embryonic stem cells, a result that has profound implications.
Scientists speak of learning to push human embryonic stem cells
along a pathway to become a spongy bone marrow, brimming with red
and white blood cells, or a pancreas that could squirt out insulin
for a person with diabetes or a fresh new layer of skin for a burn
patient.
</P>
<P>
   There is just one problem: the federal government bans the use
of its money for research in which human embryos are destroyed or
discarded. The question was, where does that leave embryo stem
cells?
</P>
<P>
   In a recent decision, lawyers for the Department of Health and
Human Services wrote that human embryonic stem cells were not
included in the research ban. The reason, the National Institutes
of Health wrote in a statement, was that the cells ``are not an
embryo as defined by statute'' and that since human embryonic stem
cells ``do not have the capacity to develop into a human being,
they cannot be considered human embryos consistent with the
commonly accepted or scientific meaning of that term.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonsense, says Dr. Lee Silver, a mouse geneticist at Princeton
University. If what matters, as the government lawyers wrote, is
``the capacity to develop into a human being,'' then human
embryonic stem cells are the moral equivalent of embryos.
``Metaphysically, it's all the same,'' Silver said.
</P>
<P>
   He thinks research with human embryo cells should be permitted
but is offended, he said, by all the winking and nodding by
scientists who do not want to admit the true potential of these
cells to become a baby, if anyone wanted to try.
</P>
<P>
   Silver's position on the nature of stem cells is supported by
Dr. Andras Nagy, the University of Toronto scientist who created
mice out of stem cells six years ago in collaboration with a
colleague, Dr. Janet Rossant. Nagy said that he saw no reason why a
human embryonic stem cell could not become a human being. ``I don't
think there's a theoretical or practical impossibility of creating
a completely stem-cell derived human being, if one wanted to do
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Others drew fine distinctions over what it meant to have a
``capacity'' to develop into a human being. They pointed out that
Nagy and Dr. Rossant had to wrap their embryonic stem cells in a
sort of artificial placenta when they dropped them into a female
mouse's uterus. The ``placenta'' was a clump of genetically
disabled cells that could not grow or become part of the developing
fetus but could temporarily protect the stem cells and help them
attach to the uterine wall.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John Gearhart of the Johns Hopkins University School of
Medicine, who led one of the two research groups that isolated
human embryonic stem cells, said the real question was whether the
stem cells by themselves could grow into a person. ``The bottom
line has to be that these cells in and of themselves are not
capable of doing that,'' he said. He added that the genetically
disabled cells ``are absolutely essential,'' explaining that they
``enable the embryonic stem cells to get through the very early
stages of embryo development.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a real biological difference between an embryonic
stem cell and a fertilized egg,'' said Dr. Brigid Hogan, a mouse
embryonic stem-cell researcher at Vanderbilt University.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, said Green, is that people are still trying to use
biology to draw moral lines in the sand, and biology just does not
suffice anymore. Questions arise with cloning because then any cell
of the body could, in theory, be used to make a new human being,
Green said. And, he added, they arise with stem cells, because they
could become a human being with a lot less laboratory manipulation.
The result, he said, is that ``the lines get very difficult to
draw.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People like to think that the biology is going to tell us
something definitive,'' Green said. But, he added, ``the biology
only poses decisions.''

ENZYME OFFERS HOPE FOR REDUCING DEVASTATION OF STROKES 
</HEADLINE>
  (The Science Times) 
(HLW) 
 By JOHN O'NEIL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The time frame for treating stroke patients with clot-busting
drugs has been doubled, from three hours to six hours, without
significantly raising the risk of hemorrhage, according to a
Cleveland Clinic study of the enzyme prourokinase.
</P>
<P>
   The findings, presented at last week's American Heart
Association stroke conference in Nashville, suggest that more
patients could benefit from treatments that could reduce or reverse
the effects of strokes as they are happening.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1995, most stroke victims have in theory been eligible for
treatment with another clot-dissolving drug, tissue plasminogen
activator, or TPA. Many physicians thought TPA would revolutionize
the field, but its usefulness has proven limited because it is
effective only within three hours of the stroke's onset.
</P>
<P>
   Stroke victims sometimes wait days instead of hours to report
symptoms. In Cleveland, only 19 percent of patients reach hospitals
within three hours, and researchers estimate that only 5 percent of
stroke victims in the United States are receiving the treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to extend the time for using TPA have failed, and three
trials of another enzyme, streptokinase, were halted when they
appeared to be causing more deaths without any clear benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Anthony Furlan, the lead researcher in the prourokinase
study, said that those results ``had a lot of people thinking we
would never get beyond three hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Furlan's research team took a different approach with
prourokinase. They studied only patients with one of the most
serious forms of stroke, blockage of the middle cerebral artery.
Unlike TPA, which is administered intravenously, prourokinase is
injected directly into the artery in the brain close to the site of
the clot. The presence of the clot causes the prourokinase to break
down into the enzyme urokinase, which dissolves the obstruction.
</P>
<P>
   The trial was conducted at 51 medical centers nationwide. Of
12,000 stroke patients, 180 that met the study's narrow criteria
were randomly given either prourokinase or a placebo injection.
</P>
<P>
   Furlan said that subsequent tests showed that 67 percent of the
blocked arteries were cleared by the prourokinase. But the most
important measure of success in stroke treatment is recovery: 40
percent of those treated were judged to have little or no
impairment three months after their stroke compared with 25 percent
of the control group.
</P>
<P>
   The prourokinase treatments did cause slightly more hemorrhaging
than had been found with TPA, Furlan said, but no additional
deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Mark Mayberg, the chief of neurosurgery at Cleveland Clinic
and the chairman of the stroke conference, pointed out one other
limitation of prourokinase: It can be administered only in medical
centers where a type of surgeon called a neuroendovascular
specialist is on hand to insert a catheter into the brain artery.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Mayberg and Furlan said they hoped the new findings
could spur a breakthrough in stroke treatment by giving patients
and emergency medical workers stronger reasons for prompt response.
Their Cleveland survey found 27 percent of stroke victims receiving
treatment within six hours and 34 percent within 12 hours.

COLOMBIA'S REBELS ESPOUSE NEW CAUSE: CONSERVATION

<P>
   SAN VICENTE DEL CAGUAN, Colombia _ After a night of fishing on
the Caguan River, the bottom of Nilson Rojas' wooden skiff was
filled with smallmouth bass and a 30-pound striped catfish with
six-inch whiskers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two years ago, you couldn't catch anything,'' said Rojas, as
he gathered up his nets. ``But since they imposed the new rules,
there has been a lot more fish reproduction. You can catch enough
to make a living.''
</P>
<P>
   Rojas was referring to a series of environmental decrees by the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, Colombia's largest
Marxist guerrilla group. Since the rules took effect about two
years ago, Rojas said, the river has made a comeback.
</P>
<P>
   With forests, rivers, fish and wildlife under siege from an
expanding frontier population, many FARC fighters also act as
gun-toting park rangers.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels have banned such practices as fishing with
explosives, unfettered logging and hunting endangered animals.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts are hesitant to call the rebels ``ecoguerrillas,''
because some of the FARC's own practices have caused environmental
havoc. But here in Caqueta state, a FARC stronghold in southern
Colombia, the rebels' conservation crusade is paying off, experts
say.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guerrillas have played an important role. They have helped
to preserve the natural resources,'' said Octavio Garcia, forestry
engineer in this bustling, cattle-ranching town on the Caguan
River. ``They have stopped 80 percent of the illegal cutting of the
forest.''
</P>
<P>
   The guerrilla's green policy apparently comes from the top.
</P>
<P>
   FARC commander Manuel ``Sure Shot'' Marulanda has lived
clandestinely in the mountains and jungles of Colombia for nearly
50 years and has turned into a nature lover, said a former
government minister.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure Shot is obsessed with protecting the environment. He
really feels it deep in his heart,'' the former official said. ``He
says things like: `See this river? I remember when it was clean.
Now look at it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Colombia's 35-year-old civil war and violent disputes between
peasants and large landowners have led to mass migrations to
Caqueta state and other jungle frontiers. In such remote regions,
there is scant government presence, and environmental rules are
often ignored.
</P>
<P>
   In Caqueta, such abuses led to a ``radical drop'' in the number
of animal species, said Javier Munera, director of CEUDES, a Bogota
research center.
</P>
<P>
   Poachers wiped out much of the deer population. Logging led to
erosion. Rivers filled with silt, making navigation by commercial
barges impossible much of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Fishermen dumped tick poison or tossed sticks of dynamite into
the rivers, then scooped up hundreds of dead fish. Accidents were
common.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of people without arms who live down by the
river,'' said Oscar Tellez, a Roman Catholic Church worker.
</P>
<P>
   To halt the destruction, the FARC ordered people to attend
meetings to discuss the problem and encouraged the formation of
environmental associations.
</P>
<P>
   ``They try to give people a vision and an introduction to the
defense of ecosystems,'' said Miguel Angel Lopez, a city official
in San Vicente del Caguan.
</P>
<P>
   The FARC announced a ban on hunting deer, wild boar, turtles and
five other species. The rebels ordered anglers to use only lines or
small nets to catch fish.
</P>
<P>
   Violators face the possibility of huge fines. But since most
people in the area are poor, the rebels often demand community
service instead. Rojas, the fishermen, said one of his errant
neighbors was forced to carry 200 buckets of sand from the river's
edge to the construction site of an elementary school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never disobey,'' Rojas said. The guerrillas ``are watching
the river. They are watching you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People have listened to us,'' added Camilo Lopez, a FARC
spokesman in San Vicente del Caguan. ``Turtles are reappearing. In
some parts of the mountains, the deer have come back.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics claim that the FARC, which is holding peace talks with
the government, is more concerned with public relations than saving
the Earth. People, they say, comply with the rebels' rules mainly
out of fear.
</P>
<P>
   Leonel Narvaez, a Catholic priest, said the FARC _ which has
come under increasing criticism for financing its war through
kidnappings, extortion and taxes on drug traffickers _ is trying to
attract funds from gullible foreign environmental groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guerrillas have realized that the environment is a good
way to bring in donations and improve their image,'' Narvaez said.
``But you can't expect military men to get involved in such serious
issues.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the civil war has wreaked havoc on the environment.
</P>
<P>
   The guerrillas and right-wing paramilitary groups have carried
out massacres and offensives that have displaced thousands of
people. And though it claims to have given up the practice, the
FARC has sabotaged oil pipelines, contaminating rivers and crops.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to do that,'' Lopez said. ``But now our policy is
totally different.''
</P>
<P>
   Colombia's smaller rebel group, the National Liberation Army,
still targets oil pipelines nearly every week.
</P>
<P>
   But because there are only a handful of government regulators in
Caqueta, officials rely on the rebels to help promote sound
environmental practices, said Omar Garcia, mayor of San Vicente del
Caguan.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is cooperation between the state and the guerrillas,''
Garcia said. ``They contribute. But not as much as they think they
do.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ From the beginning to the final days of the
impeachment follies, the thinking of a majority of voters has been
consistent and clear.
</P>
<P>
   They don't like President Clinton's disreputable behavior but
they do like his policies and don't want him removed from office.
And, significantly, the majority doesn't like the intemperate glee
with which congressional Republicans have pursued him.
</P>
<P>
   The common wisdom now holds that the Republicans have shot
themselves in the foot and are so politically crippled they will
lose the 2000 presidential and congressional elections. Yet those
elections are nearly two years away. Won't voters _ notorious for
having the attention span of a spaniel _ have forgotten all this
nasty impeachment stuff by then?
</P>
<P>
   Certainly Democratic candidates would be foolish to campaign
overtly against hypocritical impeachment overkill lest they seem to
be defending adultery and ignoring the impropriety of the
president's affair and attempted cover-up.
</P>
<P>
   If they bring up the name of Monica Lewinsky, they are as apt to
remind voters of a Democratic president's sexual excesses as of
self-righteous Republican partisanship.
</P>
<P>
   GOP leaders are already muttering about labeling their rivals as
agents of the party of immorality and sin. This could be a potent
weapon in today's tumultuous political climate, buffeted by
competing public concepts of acceptable cultural standards. The
last thing Democrats want is to be seen as ratifying sexual
harassment and lying.
</P>
<P>
   But there are underlying themes here that will influence the
coming campaigns. Questions will persist about the legitimacy of
the impeachment process, independent counsel Kenneth Starr's
inquiries and the duplicative array of congressional probes into
Democratic campaign fund-raising activities.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are in danger of looking as though they have become
the party of intolerant snoops, not only in their drive to oust the
president but also by embracing policies that pry into private
choices about abortion, family planning, religious observance and
child-rearing.
</P>
<P>
   And the Democrats are already portraying congressional
Republicans as so consumed by right-wing plots to bring down the
president that they neglected the nation's business. The
Republicans are charged with ignoring the will of the voters, who
told pollsters in no uncertain terms they would rather hear about
Social Security than Monica.
</P>
<P>
   This approach, however, works only if the GOP devotes this year
to internecine warfare and fails to produce any substantial
legislative achievements. Dropping the interparty hostility and
compiling a record of reaching out across the aisle could wipe out
some bad memories and make everybody look good.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, however, the internal GOP battle over tax cuts _ how
large, and in what form _ has resulted in sending a confused
message, undercutting the party's traditional advantage over
Democrats on that issue. And the religious right is making
ideological demands that moderates cannot accept, forcing party
leaders to espouse strangely schizophrenic policies on such issues
as abortion.
</P>
<P>
   The reality is that while Republicans nominally control both
congressional houses, it is with the smallest House party margin in
44 years and a Senate margin that is not filibuster-proof. They can
no longer afford the arrogant strutting of the Gingrich years. It
is in everybody's interest to bury the hatchet and take up a plow.
</P>
<P>
   One sign that this may actually happen is the fresh working
relationship between Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott and Minority
Leader Tom Daschle, fueled by their astonishing discovery that they
could confidentially level with each other.
</P>
<P>
   Another is that new House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert may soon
eliminate a special fund through which Gingrich financed an
unusually large number of investigations of the Clinton
administration and Democratic political allies, such as labor
unions. That is expected, among other things, to close down Rep Dan
Burton's lengthy, comic and unproductive probe of alleged White
House fund-raising abuses.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of resentment and animosity will linger between the White
House and Congress and between the two parties after the Senate
trial is finally concluded. A great deal of tidying-up is still to
be done. But a new chapter in American politics is about to unfold,
inevitably full of surprises.

DON'T STAY HOME WITHOUT INSURANCE

<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ When Joyce Berger tried to buy individual disability
insurance, she ran into a wall.
</P>
<P>
   Big underwriters, including Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance
Co., rejected Berger because they didn't like the fact that she and
her husband, Allan, were running their business
communications/public relations firm from home.
</P>
<P>
   That's troubling to insurance companies because it's harder for
them to decide when a business owner is really unable to work.
</P>
<P>
   The insurers said that ``with 80 percent of our time spent in
our home office, there was no way they could be sure we were not
able to work within our own home if we claimed we were disabled,''
Allan Berger said.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance companies agree it's tough for home business owners to
buy protection to cover their income when they are physically
unable to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is, we don't really feel comfortable selling to
people in their homes,'' said Kiah Townsend, regional sales manager
in Houston for Provident Life and Accident Insurance Co., the
largest seller of individual disability insurance.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
DISABILITY POLICY HARD TO GET &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Individual disability insurance is hard to get to begin with
because of the huge potential for fraud. It's hard to precisely
determine whether a person is healthy enough to earn a living. It's
also expensive because the claims are high and there are not as
many buyers, so it's harder for underwriters to spread the risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Disability is the most strictly underwritten insurance of all,
in general,'' said Stanley Horn, a certified financial planner at
Investors Mutual Agency in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance companies said there's a simple reason why they're
reluctant to sell disability coverage to self-employed people who
spend most of their work time at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you verify if someone's disabled if they never leave
the house?'' Townsend said.
</P>
<P>
   Proving this can come down to some hair-splitting details.
</P>
<P>
   The deal killer for the Bergers was their telling Northwestern
they worked only 20 percent of the time outside of their home. The
company wanted the couple to spend close to 75 percent of the time
outside their office.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Northwestern Mutual) also told us that if our office were in
our garage as a stand-alone building, or if we had to leave the
non-office part of our home and have to walk around the house in
order to go into our home office through a dedicated outside door,
we would have qualified,'' Allan Berger said.
</P>
<P>
   Northwestern Mutual officials said that was correct.
</P>
<P>
   Insurers are known for often making absurd character judgments
of people based on the most esoteric of details. But the
self-employed are the last people you have to motivate to work
because their economic survival depends on their ability to drum up
business.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
INCREASE THE CHANCES OF COVERAGE &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you run your business from home, there are steps you can take
to increase your chances of getting individual disability
insurance:
</P>
<P>
   _ Keep a detailed log of how much time you spend out of your
home office visiting clients. List names of clients, their company
and the purpose of the visit. That would enable you to prove to an
insurance company that you don't spend most of your time in your
home office.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more information you can give them, the better off you
are,'' said Anne Day, an insurance broker who specializes in
disability insurance at the Shaw Co. in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   _ Keep impeccable business records. Especially important are
contracts that you've signed with clients to show insurance
companies that you have a viable business going and that you have
income to verify.
</P>
<P>
   _ If you're just starting your business, put together a detailed
business plan. State your goals for the business and how your work
experience will enable you to reach them. You want to show
stability.
</P>

THIS IS DENNIS HASTERT'S BIG OPPORTUNITY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM WRIGHT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Let us all wish the best for Dennis Hastert, the new speaker of
the U.S. House of Representatives. He may have taken on the biggest
challenge in Washington today. This 57-year-old former teacher and
restaurateur from Illinois has been handed, quite suddenly, the
daunting task of directing that bitterly divided and increasingly
unmanageable institution.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert has said he wants to restore a friendlier atmosphere in
the House and is willing to work with Democratic leaders toward
this end. Hooray! There are further reports that he is moving away
from one particularly onerous practice attributed to his
predecessor. Newt Gingrich, while speaker, is said to have given
arbitrary political fund-raising goals to House committee chairmen
with jurisdiction over taxes and other matters vital to big
business lobbying interests. If these reports be true, Hastert's
decision is worthy of applause.
</P>
<P>
   There must be absolutely no nexus, real or implied, connecting
public policy responsibilities with campaign contributions, unless
we're prepared to sacrifice even the pretense of being a government
of, by and for the people. Both parties have skated dangerously
near the edge. It's time that someone in authority blew the
whistle. If Hastert has done that, my hat is off to him.
</P>
<P>
   For the good of the country, I want to see Dennis Hastert
succeed as a fair and effective speaker. And I know from experience
some of the sand traps along the fairways.
</P>
<P>
   My advice, for what it's worth, would be to divorce himself
entirely from the partisan quarrels and petty intrigues that have
so disgusted the public during the past two years, both intra-party
and inter-party. Abandon the goal of trying to ``get'' President
Clinton. It's polarizing and counterproductive and helps nobody.
</P>
<P>
   Concentrate instead _ and immediately, I'd advise _ on three or
four carefully chosen legislative goals that fill important needs,
enjoy public backing and can command bipartisan support. Solicit
the cooperation of House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt in
appointing bipartisan task forces, and let Democrats share some
responsibility in drafting and planning these initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   That advice is not really new. But its actual implementation
would be new _ or at least so old that it would seem new.
</P>
<P>
   High above the speaker's dais in the House chamber is a
prominent plaque with these words by Daniel Webster: ``Let us
develop the resources of our land, call forth its powers, build up
its institutions, promote all its great interests and see whether
we also in our day and generation may not perform something worthy
to be remembered.''
</P>
<P>
   Could Webster's ancient admonition be a useful guide for the new
speaker? It might, if undertaken without undue jockeying over who
gets credit. Let the House itself have credit. There are, among
Congress's mound of unfinished business, several national goals
that fit Webster's description.
</P>
<P>
   Those that develop our resources, whether natural or human,
would seem likely candidates for a venture into bipartisanship. In
years past, the interstate highway program and the clean-up of our
streams were roundly embraced by both parties. The first was a
brainchild of President Eisenhower, the second a creation of
Democratic lawmakers. Both parties had a hand in the draftsmanship
of each, and everyone claimed paternity.
</P>
<P>
   There've been a few recent instances _ like welfare reform,
decentralizing government and balancing the budget _ in which
Clinton initiatives co-opted Republican rhetoric. What, except an
obstinate disinclination to see one's political opposition get some
of the credit for a good thing, is to keep Hastert's party now from
sponsoring legislation that carries out such current Democratic
battle cries as improving public education? Or salvaging Social
Security? Or strengthening our infrastructure?
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, the speaker needs to change the focus, if he can,
from the shrill denunciations of the recent past. It's in his own
party's interest, as well as the nation's, to do so.
</P>
<P>
   It won't be easy. Never in modern times has the House been so
angrily divided along sharp-edged partisan lines. Nor has a
majority party had such a razor-thin margin, vulnerable to a
defection of only six votes on any issue. I cannot recall such
deep-seated outrage on either side as each feels now over perceived
unfairness by the other. Or such an apparently insatiable thirst
among members for personal revenge against one another.
</P>
<P>
   Add to this the public backlash against the House itself over
its handling of impeachment, which two-thirds of all Americans
apparently opposed. That this happened in December before the new
speaker was installed is in his favor.
</P>
<P>
   The way to surmount these destructive fixations is by making a
convincing demonstration that Congress can put all that behind it
and produce an agenda of positive, substantive legislation. This is
the speaker's primary responsibility _ and his present opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert begins with a few advantages. He enjoys the respect of
his colleagues, including many Democrats. Although sufficiently
orthodox to satisfy the GOP's conservative wing, he hasn't pursued
personal vendettas against other colleagues or engaged in
mean-spirited harangues. He has expressed a willingness to work
with House Democrats and did not glower and grimace at Clinton
during the State of the Union address. So he starts with a fairly
clean slate. But symbolism goes only so far. Now the public is
demanding substance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Develop the resources of our land,'' advised Webster. The
speaker's task, it seems to me, is to show that the House, though
riven by fracticidal hatreds, can work together this year to
``perform something worthy to be remembered.''

THE CYNIC'S GUIDE TO VALENTINE'S DAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every cynic knows that Valentine's Day is merely a merchandising
campaign run by, to paraphrase the Peanuts characters, a big
eastern syndicate. That doesn't mean that cynics can't find ways to
celebrate.
</P>
<P>
   _ MAKE YOUR OWN ANTI-LOVE-SONG TAPE. For starters, we recommend
ABC's sarcastic ``Valentine's Day''; David Gilmour's ``All Lovers
Are Deranged''; Devo's ``Love Without Anger''; the Who's ``How Many
Friends Have I Really Got''; and Joe Jackson's ``Is She Really
Going Out With Him?''
</P>
<P>
   _ RENT AN ANTI-ROMANTIC MOVIE. You can't beat 1989's dark
divorce comedy ``The War of the Roses.'' Also good: ``In the
Company of Men,'' Neil LaBute's 1997 movie about a misogynistic
duo, and 1994's acid-etched comedy ``The Ref,'' although its ending
might be too happy for a true cynic.
</P>
<P>
   _ MAKE YOUR CYNICISM WORK FOR YOU. SendWine.com
(www.sendwine.com) is sponsoring a Great Valentine's Disaster
Contest. The rules and how to enter are on the Web site, but the
gist is: Send in a brief description of your worst Valentine's Day
experiences, and you're eligible for a Valentine's Day weekend next
year at the Meadowood Resort in Mount Helena, Calif. We know, you
can think of all sorts of reasons this won't work, but try it
anyway. You might even be able to narrow it down to one bad
experience.

FOR JOURNALIST DAVID HALBERSTAM, MICHAEL JORDAN IS JUST THE LATEST
SLAM DUNK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF GUINN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In print, he's ferocious. From the Kennedy/Johnson
best and brightest to the head-in-the-sand leaders of the U.S. auto
industry, too many powerful people to count have been skewered in
print by David Halberstam. Bestselling books and Pulitzer
Prize-winning magazine and newspaper stories decorate Halberstam's
resume like still-dripping scalps.
</P>
<P>
   But at home in his New York City apartment, decked out in white
shirt and dark slacks and the color of pink sweater that gets men
beaten up in biker bars, Halberstam is a 64-year-old pussycat. His
latest book, ``Playing for Keeps: Michael Jordan and the World He
Made'' (Random House, $24.95), has received rapturous reviews and
will top bestseller lists beginning Sunday. At this point in his
storied career, Halberstam can approach any publisher with book
ideas on any subject and walk away with a seven-figure advance.
</P>
<P>
   So on a recent Thursday afternoon he's financially secure, he's
famous and he's really, really sorry that the apartment's kitchen
is being renovated and coffee can't be offered.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years _ ``The Best and the Brightest,'' his first
blockbuster, hit store shelves and ruined political reputations in
1972 _ Halberstam has earned a reputation as a grouch, probably
because he disdains uninformed questions from interviewers who
don't share his dedication to exhaustive research. But on this day
there's been a new, glowing review of ``Playing for Keeps'' in USA
Today. According to its critic, the greatest compliment to Michael
Jordan would be calling him ``the David Halberstam of basketball.''
Despite so much previous acclaim, Halberstam seems delighted by
this latest gush.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more fun than ever,'' he admits, leading the way into a
cluttered study and sweeping unopened mail, CD cases and crumpled
faxes off a battered couch so visitors can sit down. Halberstam
himself plops down into a well-worn chair; he sits in it so often
there are slight indentions on the armrests where he places his
elbows. Whatever negative attributes Halberstam may have,
pretension isn't one of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, what do you want to talk about?'' he asks, and the
afternoon stretches into a long conversational ramble. Having
interviewed so many people himself, Halberstam has mastered the art
of expressing himself colorfully and completely. It's fun to
listen.
</P>
<P>
   _ &QL;
</P>
<P>
   David Halberstam dislikes Robert McNamara, TV pundits and
self-obsessed journalists, probably in that order. When his outrage
with the Vietnam War boiled over from newsprint into ``The Best and
the Brightest,'' McNamara emerged as the book's great villain.
Halberstam never could reconcile the war he witnessed as a foreign
correspondent with the one relayed to the public by the man who was
secretary of defense for John Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm his Darth Vader,'' Halberstam says. ``I won't go away. He
was a liar, he's still a liar and I track him. Diane Sawyer put him
on TV and he cried. I guess that was good TV. Now when he talks
about the war he says, `We couldn't get information.' I document
how he had all the information he needed. He just didn't want to
hear it. For political reasons, he was willing to slay anybody in
his way. But this is an unusual case for me. I don't know anyone
else I feel this way about.''
</P>
<P>
   He uses ``The Best and the Brightest'' to illustrate his writing
philosophy. ``Every nonfiction book should be written to answer a
question, and the question in `The Best and the Brightest' was
this,'' Halberstam says, furrowing his brow. ``The Kennedy
advisers, who went on to serve Johnson, were ostensibly the ablest
group ever to serve in American government. But Vietnam was the
greatest American tragedy since the Civil War. How could that
happen?''
</P>
<P>
   Halberstam's answer was that McNamara, Dean Rusk and company
simply considered Asians inferior to Americans. Without paying
sufficient attention to history, they underestimated North
Vietnam's resolve to win the war at any cost.
</P>
<P>
   Halberstam was already unpopular with the Johnson administration
for his stinging newspaper stories in The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Johnson even called me a traitor to my country,'' Halberstam
says, smiling.
</P>
<P>
   In the decades since, Halberstam has written about many famous,
influential people, often to their detriment. He claims no
animosity toward anyone but McNamara.
</P>
<P>
   And the TV ``talking heads.'' He despises them, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I turned down chances to get on TV as a commentator,'' he
says. ``I don't want one of those TV minds like the Powder River, a
mile wide and an inch deep. People with superegos, the ones who
think they are the story, are the ones on TV. Look at Sam
Donaldson, calling attention to himself all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   The same goes for writing books in the first person; Halberstam
believes the very best journalists, the best writers, try most of
the time to avoid using the word ``I.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I used the phrase `this writer' twice when I
absolutely had to,'' he growls, ``but journalists as people
themselves are usually not interesting. You have never seen and
heard as much as you think you have.''
</P>
<P>
   MORE
</P>
<P>
   _ &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's a sunny afternoon, and the rays cast shadows around
Halberstam's nose and mouth. When he talks, though, you
automatically watch his bushy eyebrows. They're in constant motion:
up, down, seemingly sideways. Halberstam is never still. His hands
wave, his voice rises and falls. He CARES.
</P>
<P>
   This may be what makes his books so special. Halberstam brings
his readers into real-life scenes so thoroughly that the actual
sense of reading is lost. Instead, we are there, right inside the
boardrooms and on the playing fields and behind closed doors in the
Oval Office. No journalist is better at including the small,
telling details than Halberstam. In ``Playing for Keeps,'' one
glittering paragraph about Michael Jordan teaching himself to play
pingpong tells us more about Jordan's unhealthy competitiveness
than dozens of other complete books by lesser writers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything might be important,'' Halberstam explains. ``You've
got to take the time to look.''
</P>
<P>
   And he does. It's rare for a new Halberstam title to appear more
often than once every three or four years. It takes time, he says,
to do the job right.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liken it to graduate school,'' Halberstam says. ``Someone
else goes to grad school for four or five years and leaves as a
doctor or lawyer. I concentrate on some subject for the same amount
of time and at the end of it I have another book. It is a constant
learning process. You have to be curious. You can't assume you
already know everything about your subject. If you pretend to be an
instant expert, you cheat your readers.''
</P>
<P>
   _ &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The afternoon moves on. Halberstam, enjoying himself, makes a
couple of calls to postpone appointments. He feels like talking
about his roots. The son of a doctor and a second-grade teacher,
Halberstam always intended to become a journalist.
</P>
<P>
   World events, and the way they were reported, served as topics
of discussion at the Halberstam dinner table.
</P>
<P>
   ``Journalists like (Edward R.) Murrow were heroes in our home,''
Halberstam notes, rocking back and forth in his chair. ``So that
was my plan, to write like them and eventually take the next step
to writing books.''
</P>
<P>
   At Harvard, Halberstam developed new writing heroes. John
Gunther and Theodore White were writing important books about
Africa and China, not heeding the conventional '40s and '50s
mainstream journalism that avoided placing blame on elected
officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teddy White had guts,'' Halberstam says. ``I loved the fact he
left Time magazine when the editors screwed around with him, that
he went out on his own and wrote great books like `Thunder Out of
China' and `The Making of the President 1960.' He wrote books about
things that had happened where the reader knew how they were going
to end, but they still felt like thrillers. And Gunther is so
underappreciated. A few years ago, the Boston Globe called me our
generation's equivalent of John Gunther and Teddy White. What a
thrill for me.''
</P>
<P>
   After college graduation in 1955, Halberstam followed his career
plan to a newspaper in Mississippi. He didn't last long, getting
fired when his questions and subsequent stories offended
conservative white readers and advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   Halberstam moved to a newspaper in Nashville, and his civil
rights coverage there became the basis for his book ``The
Children.'' In it, Halberstam tracks down the men and women he
initially wrote about as student participants in sit-ins.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Halberstam found his almost inevitable way to New
York and the Times. His reporting from Vietnam earned a Pulitzer
Prize, with dispatches that brilliantly captured the war's
senseless violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``People didn't know or didn't care what was happening,'' he
says. ``The great strength of America, and its greatest weakness,
is we think history isn't important. We think we are a constantly
new society, that we can always reinvent ourselves and leave the
past completely behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, at Harper's magazine, Halberstam was assigned a profile
of a relatively anonymous, but important, member of the Johnson
administration. The idea of presidential advisers controlling
America's destiny began to obsess him. He ended up giving up half
his annual salary (''from $18,000 I went down to $9,000'') to work
part time while writing ``The Best and the Brightest.''
</P>
<P>
   Halberstam's sixth book, published in 1972, was a sensation. It
dominated bestseller lists and party conversation, because
Halberstam painted devastating word portraits of leaders whose
pigheadedness condemned America to pursue an unwinnable war. The
book's success allowed Halberstam to turn his full attention to a
career as an author.
</P>
<P>
   Halberstam's subsequent books, ``The Powers That Be'' and ``The
Reckoning,'' were heavyweight tomes that investigated the media and
the automotive industry, respectively. Other recent Halberstam
forays into complex subjects include ``The Next Century,'' ``The
Fifties'' and ``The Children.'' He claims the last of the three as
his personal favorite among all the books he has written.

   But sports fascinates Halberstam, too. Nearly 15 years ago, he
wrote ``The Breaks of the Game,'' a study of one season of the
Portland Trailblazers pro basketball team. ``The Amateurs,'' one of
the author's favorite books (''No book is perfect, but to the
degree I can do something perfect within the limits of my skills,
`The Amateurs' is it''), is about rowing. ``Summer of '49'' and
``October 1964'' concern baseball. In each case, Halberstam didn't
confine himself to games themselves; he exhaustively examined
sports economics, its fixated fans, the stars who encapsulate the
society that chooses to worship them.

</P>
<P>
   Michael Jordan, then, seems a natural subject for Halberstam,
but he says ``Playing for Keeps'' came out of compromise.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were at a standoff, Random House and I,'' Halberstam says.
``I was finishing up `The Children' and had one book left on a
four-book contract. I wanted to do my next one on the Korean War,
but they weren't ready for that. My former editor there suggested
Jordan because he loves basketball and knows I do, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Halberstam was already acquainted with Jordan; he'd written a
long cover story about him for Sports Illustrated in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yet in 1997, '98, if anyone was written almost too much about,
it was him,'' Halberstam says. ``With Michael Jordan, the question
to answer, the one that hadn't been answered, was not exactly why
he became such a great player, but why the most famous American in
the world became a bald black man who plays basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan first promised to give Halberstam private interviews,
then reneged. But he did follow through on a pledge to allow his
family and closest friends to speak to the author.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't necessarily blame Michael for that,'' Halberstam says.
``How many interviews can one person do? I took on this project at
a time Michael was clearly media-ed out. He's charming, that's for
sure. He is really a modern American prince. But he happened along
at the right time for himself.''
</P>
<P>
   1984, Halberstam believes, was a watershed in American sports
history. Jordan had just joined the Chicago Bulls, but it was also
when fledgling cable network ESPN gained its first real national
prominence; canny marketing genius David Stern became commissioner
of the National Basketball League; and Nike decided it wanted to
build a massive new national advertising campaign around a fresh
new pro basketball face. As skilled in public relations as in
basketball, Michael Jordan took full advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Playing for Keeps'' is, overall, positive in its analysis of
Jordan. The book doesn't spare glimpses of Jordan's nastiness with
teammates or fixation on winning at any cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I haven't heard any reaction from Michael, and I don't
expect to, at least in terms of saying something public,''
Halberstam says. ``He's extremely intelligent. He doesn't do
anything that could end up hurting himself. I certainly appreciate
him. He is special.''
</P>
<P>
   _ &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Halberstam is entering what he calls ``a new stage of my life.''
Besides writing books, it is to include new kinds of culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife and I are going to the opera tonight, my first time at
the opera,'' he says. ``So I've been reading up on opera, trying to
learn some things. The more you learn about almost anything, the
more you want to learn. I guess that's what pleases me, that I
haven't lost my sense of curiosity after all these years. If you
lose that, you're not a journalist anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Halberstam hopes his next book will focus on medical science,
and then there's the Korean War. After those books, he'll think of
some more. The journalistic fire still burns in Halberstam's belly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being older actually helps,'' he says. ``I think I have a
better grasp of scope. Maybe my curiosity about things is more
subtle. And I'm certainly a better listener. Journalists ought to
listen more and talk less.''

   The approval of his peers means a lot, but not so much that he
believes every good thing he hears about himself. Told that an
informal Fort Worth Star-Telegram poll of several dozen prominent
authors named him as the best American writer, he smiles, but
notes, ``My wife finds that kind of thing hard to accept. She
reminds me I'm good at what I do, but so are lots of other
people.''
</P>
<P>
   More than anything, Halberstam wants to remain the kind of
journalist he looked up to as a child.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, I think of myself as one of the journalism infantry
members who was able to tell some stories,'' he concludes. ``My
family has been able to live well, though we're not wealthy. A lot
of the money I make from each book goes into the next one; if I fly
to Chicago for three days to work on the Jordan book, I end up
spending $3,000-$4,000 on plane fare, hotels, meals. People don't
realize that.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I've been able to do what I always wanted to do, and
though I'm not the best writer around, I think I'm in the top
group. You know, it's more fun now than ever. That's what pleases
me most.''

PEBBLE BEACH REIGNS DESPITE THE WEATHER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GWEN KNAPP  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. _ The CBS gang was furiously filling dead
air. The network gave us interviews with Craig Stadler and pro-am
partner Glenn Frey. It gave us panoramic views of gray skies over
the Pacific. It gave us pictures of puddles on the greens at Pebble
Beach. It gave us the Weather Channel without the cool maps.
</P>
<P>
   You would think CBS would have been better prepared, after
repeated dousings on the Monterey Peninsula in recent years. When
rain forced golfers off the course at 9:30 a.m. Sunday, the network
should have been frantically searching for real filler material. A
movie (``Caddyshack''?) would have been nice.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, Jim Nantz could have asked Frey to perform an
old Eagles hit. ``Hotel California'' would have been a natural.
``You can check out any time you like, but you can never leave.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, that would have been more appropriate for last year's
AT&AMP;T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am, which started in January and
ended in August. This time around, the end came quickly and
relatively painlessly. Less than five hours after play was
suspended, the tournament called the 54-hole result a keeper. The
same cannot be said for any tape of the CBS broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   The networks call the shots at so many sporting events, often to
the detriment of athletes. Midnight college basketball games. The
San Francisco 49ers in a playoff on six days' rest, and at 9:30
a.m. body-clock time. But since Mother Nature doesn't collect
rights fees, she doesn't have to cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   At Pebble Beach, three of the last four years, she's thumbed her
nose, done an end-zone dance and slashed a finger across her
throat. She's quickly replacing MCI as AT&AMP;T's biggest adversary.
</P>
<P>
   Payne Stewart, the winner of the abridged tournament, said he
felt sorry for the long-distance moguls who pay so much for
advertising here. Maybe that's why when a reporter's cell phone
rang during his press conference, he said he'd be happy to pause
and let the journalist take the call.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, it turns out, had a little face-to-face chat during
Saturday's storm with an AT&AMP;T executive, an amateur in the
tournament. The champ asked whether the executive had any thoughts
about how to reduce the odds of rainouts.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart said the executive recommended a slight remedy, which
has been suggested in the past. The PGA Tour's West Coast swing
lasts until the end of February, and moving the tournament back by
three weeks would push it closer to the end of the rainy season in
Northern California. The scheduling shift wouldn't lower the risk
substantially, but the tournament is whiffing at a .750 clip on
Sundays since 1995. Any little change is worth exploring.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, a late February date means more daylight, more time for
the greens to dry when the wet stuff does arrive.
</P>
<P>
   There are other options, too. Stewart said that during the long
delay, Stadler had kicked around the idea of coming to Pebble in
July, two weeks after the British Open. Other people have mentioned
swapping tour slots with the Las Vegas Invitational, which brings
players west in October.
</P>
<P>
   The drawback to both of those times? Asking Pebble to shut down
during peak tourist times, when the days are long enough to permit
a generous log of expensive tee-offs.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it may not be worth it to try to outsmart nature.
Although the tournament has taken a beating the last four years,
it's still a strong draw and a great show. The soggy history didn't
keep Bill Murray or Clint Eastwood or Ken Griffey Jr. or Jack
Lemmon away. And CBS, for all its travails, got a lot of mileage
out of them on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The pros don't seem to be turned off, either. For established
players, this is a great event. Spread over three courses, quirky
as the dickens, the AT&AMP;T favors veteran savvy. Stadler and Stewart
both feel that they've had some of their best rounds in years here,
and they've both walked away with well-lined pockets.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the abbreviation has a cost. The gate will be
diminished, and even the most ardent fans may start to question the
prudence of setting aside time and money to visit Pebble Beach. For
the players, frustration would be only natural.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Lickliter, a stroke behind Stewart, had a chance for the
first win of his young career. David Duval, the hottest man on the
tour, eagled the first hole on Sunday and then had to leave the
course. Phil Mickelson, the defending champ, birdied the first two
before he was beckoned indoors. Who knows what these two might have
done?
</P>
<P>
   But Lickliter, no hothouse flower, said he accepted the perils
of playing in the beautiful but finicky environment at Pebble
Beach. ``If you told me it was going to rain here for the next 20
years, I'd still come back every year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That's all the organizers need to hear. And they must believe
that, like an athlete in a slump, they're due for a good run now.

EXPECT `PRIVATE RYAN' TO LEAD THE CHARGE AT THE OSCARS
</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One reason the Golden Globes are so much fun to watch is the
show's cocktail-fueled looseness; the participants couldn't
possibly care less. Everyone's game and irreverent _ the way it's
said the Oscars were in the '30s and '40s, before people began to
take them way too seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Globes, announced in late January, generally give
some indication which way the Academy Award nominations are likely
to go. And when they're announced Tuesday, this year's Oscar bids
are likely to include at least two crowd-pleasing films honored by
the loopier Globes voters _ ``Saving Private Ryan'' and
``Shakespeare in Love.''
</P>
<P>
   Key nominations from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and
Sciences should assuage those ``Ryan'' fans upset that the film was
ignored by every organization that gave out awards last year,
except the Golden Globes. (The ``Ryan'' backlash emerged late last
year, when several critics' groups selected ``The Thin Red Line''
and ``Out of Sight'' over Steven Spielberg's masterful
entertainment.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Shakespeare in Love is the picture most likely to join
``Ryan'' with a pocketful of Oscar nods. The deviously constructed
comedy stars Joseph Fiennes as a brooding, creatively constipated
William Shakespeare and Gwyneth Paltrow as the woman who frees his
talent.
</P>
<P>
   With their long, pale patrician necks, Paltrow and Fiennes are
like a pair of swans flirting with each other. Their rebellious
nuzzling makes up for Fiennes being such an anachronistic actor;
those bright, brimming eyes of his, so close together, make him
look like a handsome ant from ``A Bug's Life.'' Overall, the film
is fluent and self-mocking _ complete with a cameo by its
sharp-witted co-author, Tom Stoppard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ryan'' star Hanks could probably get more competition from
Paltrow in the Best Actor category than he will from Fiennes. The
real threat will come from Ian McKellen, the best _ maybe the only
_ reason to see ``Gods and Monsters.''
</P>
<P>
   The direction is prosaic, but McKellen's reedy, focused job of
playing down the anguish spooned over his character, director James
Whale, is a marvel. Hanks is also likely to feel the breath of Nick
Nolte on his neck. Nolte gives the performance of his career in
Paul Schrader's adaptation of ``Affliction.'' Full of heart and
heartbroken, Nolte's instinctive bellowing as the lost soul is
chief among the elements that give the movie gracefulness.
</P>
<P>
   Both Nolte's and McKellen's performances were noticed by
critics' organizations _ McKellen's by the Los Angeles group and
the National Board of Review, Nolte's by the National Society.
</P>
<P>
   And as usual, there's a surfeit of good actors' work this year.
Nolte has two pictures for which he could be nominated,
``Affliction'' and ``The Thin Red Line.'' It's even possible,
though not probable, that Sean Penn could receive Academy attention
for both ``Line'' and his disharmonious, broken-down casting agent
in ``Hurlyburly.''
</P>
<P>
   But the pickings are so slim for actresses this year that, in an
act of willful perversion, the New York critics' group gave Cameron
Diaz its Best Actress award for ``There's Something About Mary.''
Which means that, somewhere, RuPaul is tearing his wig _ er, hair _
out, thinking that if he'd only done the ``Brady Bunch'' sequel
THIS year, he, too, would have been nominated.
</P>
<P>
   Though she won't directly compete with Hanks, the odds are that
Paltrow will receive a nomination for ``Shakespeare.'' (Though her
best acting this year, and possibly to date, was in the
phenomenally neurotic ``Great Expectations,'' in which she fixed on
a character in a way that she never had.)
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps this is because few roles for women have demanded much
in the way of full emotional extremes. Cate Blanchett, in
``Elizabeth,'' served as a hood ornament _ her head resting on one
of those elegant alabaster necks that are de rigueur in costume
dramas this season. As history swirled around her with more ax
blades than in all of Wes Craven's movies put together, she had not
much more to do than bolt upright and keep her eyes from popping
out of her head. (This may be the year of doubles, as Geoffrey
Rush, who plays Sir Francis Walshingham, the knife in Elizabeth's
right hand, also does fine, knockabout comic work in
``Shakespeare.'')
</P>
<P>
   Then again, Supporting Actor/Actress is almost always the most
fun category _ this year there's Bill Murray in ``Rushmore'' and
Michael Caine in ``Little Voice.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the films, ``Elizabeth'' is a gore-packed melodrama,
although everyone has enough taste to not bleed all over the
Indian-influenced colors _ curry oranges and greens _ that much of
the cast is adorned with.
</P>
<P>
   And there's the low-key lesbianism in ``High Art,'' which is
vaguely tasteful. Or, more to the point, vague and tasteful. Ally
Sheedy's first big splash in the independent film world, as a
tortured gay artist courted by a knowing young acolyte, sounds like
a ripe piece of melodrama. But, in the end, she gets to learn about
herself instead.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the real Oscar surprise will come if ``Life Is
Beautiful,'' Roberto Benigni's swing for the fences, gets a Best
Picture nomination AND a Best Actor nomination. (It's guaranteed a
nomination for Best Foreign Language Film and will undoubtedly win
in that category as well.) His attempt to show the power of comedy
in the most grim situation _ a Nazi concentration camp, where his
family has been interned _ has won him acknowledgement.
</P>
<P>
   And there's Jim Carrey's well-meaning turn in the grindingly
obvious ``The Truman Show,'' another venture to show us the
indomitability of the human spirit. (Although the same thing was
done much more successfully on the old ``Twilight Zone'' and ``The
Prisoner.'')
</P>
<P>
   Since ``Truman's'' director, Peter Weir, received a Director's
Guild Award for the least interesting work in his entire career, we
should assume that the movie has a shot at Best Picture as well.
Which brings the circle back to ``Ryan'' and ``Shakespeare in
Love.'' In the movies as well as everywhere else, what goes around
comes around. And around and around and ...

brother, John Edgar Wideman. One brother in the non-fiction work
was the noted author who had escaped the ghetto. The other was the
street tough who embodied the cycle that claims many young black
males. At 25, Robert Wideman was imprisoned for life with no
possibility of parole after an accomplice fired a fatal shot in a

and historically black medical schools like Morehouse in the face
of waves of new research showing disparities in the health of black
and white Americans. By Peter T. Kilborn.

CLINTON, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENTS PAY TRIBUTE TO HUSSEIN 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMMAN, Jordan _ In a powerful show of U.S. support for this
strategic desert nation, President Clinton and his three
predecessors bowed their heads Monday in tribute to King Hussein
and bid farewell to a partner in peace.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein, who died Sunday at 63 from cancer, was laid to rest
according to Muslim traditions, his body wrapped in a white shroud
and gently lowered into a grave by his loyal Bedouin guards. Cannon
fire echoed throughout this mourning city and fighter jets flew
overhead in dramatic salute.
</P>
<P>
   After a brief meeting, Clinton praised King Abdullah, the
37-year-old new monarch whose youth and inexperience raised
questions about his ability to rule Jordan and to maintain its path
of moderation amid the extremes of the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein's death leaves a void in the region's peace process. The
king helped encourage the beginning of the process in 1991, signed
a peace treaty with Israel in 1994, and left his sickbed to help
salvage talks between Israel and the Palestinian Authority last
October.
</P>
<P>
   ``He clearly understands his mission,'' Clinton said of King
Abdullah during an address to U.S. Embassy workers here.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said in the most moving way, `I and all of my brothers and
sisters have absorbed our father's teaching, we know what we are
supposed to do and I intend to do it.' And he said it in a way that
exuded the quiet, humble confidence that I saw so often in his
father,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Less than two weeks ago, Hussein dumped his brother Hassan as
crown prince and announced the surprise decision to name Abdullah,
the king's oldest son, as heir. Hassan had served as heir for much
of Hussein's 47-year reign.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Berger, Clinton's national security adviser, said the
president and the new king discussed the importance of reassuring
Israel of Jordan's commitment to peace. Berger said that Clinton,
in discussions with other world leaders, also urged them to
continue their support of Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   The United States also is urging other nations to restructure
some of Jordan's debt.
</P>
<P>
   The administration previously announced it would seek an
additional $300 million in aide over three years to help this
country's economy. ``Jordan's biggest problem right now is an
economy that is not strong and needs to grow,'' Berger said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton sent an unmistakable signal of the United States'
support for Jordan and King Abdullah, and its respect for Hussein,
by including former Presidents Bush, Carter and Ford in his
delegation.
</P>
<P>
   Carter and Bush, who also addressed the Embassy personnel, added
their praise for King Abdullah. Carter recalled that King Hussein
asked if his son could attend high-level sessions at the White
House when the boy was 12. ``So I feel that he's well-qualified to
lead this great nation and these great people,'' Carter said.
</P>
<P>
   Added Bush, ``I share President Carter's confidence in the
future of Jordan under your new king. He'll do just fine.'' Bush,
however, did not mention the falling out he had with Hussein over
Jordan's initial support of Iraq's Saddam Hussein after the 1990
invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton hailed Hussein's ability to bring people together. ``We
know that America's interest and America's heart were close to this
king and this country,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Amman was a city in mourning as scraps of black cloth clung to
car antennas, clothes and buildings. A military escort provided the
king's funeral cortege a last trip around the city of seven hills.
But hundreds of mourners overwhelmed the motorcade, tossing flowers
atop the casket and separating the jeep carrying the king's body
from its guards before the motorcade entered Raghadon Palace.
</P>
<P>
   The coffin lay in state in the Throne Room, where all windows
face east toward Mecca. There, scores of world leaders _ kings and
queens, presidents and prime ministers _ passed by, some offering a
salute, some offering a prayer.
</P>
<P>
   Among the mourners was Hussein's sometime nemesis, Syrian
President Hafez Assad, who opened his palms in traditional Islamic
prayer and rubbed his hands down his face in a sign of sorrow.
</P>
<P>
   Assad's delegation was kept at a diplomatic distance from a
large Israeli delegation that included Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu and several candidates seeking his position in the May
elections. It was the first time Assad and Israeli leaders have
ever been at the same location.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq and Libya also sent delegations.
</P>
<P>
   Russian President Boris Yeltsin, appearing bloated and unsteady,
needed aides to help him up the palace stairs. He stayed only
briefly, and, apparently ailing, left the palace immediately to
return to Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat also offered two
salutes to Hussein, who played an instrumental role in helping
initiate Middle East peace talks in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeline Albright stayed in Washington in
deference to Muslim tradition that prohibits women from attending
funeral services.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, Bush, Carter and Ford provided a dramatic moment as
they walked in together, turned toward the coffin and dropped their
heads in prayer. The gathering also provided Clinton with an
opportunity to speak briefly to several heads of state as he
awaited his turn, aides said.
</P>
<P>
   The world leaders joined the family members for the short walk
from the palace to the burial site. A drum and bagpipe band, a
throwback to Jordan's days under British rule, lead the way. A
white Arabian stallion, boots turned backward in the stirrups to
symbolize a fallen rider, pranced along the route.
</P>
<P>
   Only the king's sons and brothers were allowed at the gravesite.
King Abdullah, his head wrapped in the traditional red Bedouin
kaffiyeh, accepted the folded flag from the Hussein coffin.
</P>
<P>
   Queen Noor, Hussein's U.S.-born wife, remained secluded at the
palace where, by tradition, she could not attend the funeral
services. The spouses of other world leaders, including first lady
Hillary Rodham Clinton, met separately with her to offer their
support and condolences.
</P>
<P>
   The grief-stricken queen, dressed in white for mourning, was
seen earlier in the day clutching one of her daughters in a doorway
as the king's cortege left the palace grounds for the parade around
the city. After the ceremony, she left the palace, offering a
comforting kiss to her youngest daughter who was frightened by
camera flashes.
</P>
<P>
   Queen Noor's parents traveled aboard Air Force One with Clinton
to attend the ceremony.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   The letter, dated Christmas Day 1998 and addressed to a
professor at the Niels Bohr Institute in Copenhagen, began
portentously: ``Nowadays, we seek to comprehend our comprehensions
and call that comprehensiveness knowledge in the mistaken belief
that as a science it is immortal. Such omniscience diffuses like
Helium-3 into the penetralia mentis of omnipotent impotency within
any God-head such that any caveat actor is saved. ...''
</P>
<P>
   Within a few sentences, the writer was holding forth on
Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle and ``the concept of nothing''
as the empty set, before launching into speculations involving
number theory: ``And if 1 is excluded from being prime. ... it's
enough to make me conjecture that infinity's prime and Riemann's
Zeta function accounts for fractional charge subatomically just for
the Higg's boson with an involucral matrix of ogdoad parity as
midwife!''
</P>
<P>
   The letter was typed single-spaced with the tiniest of margins
and embellished with hand-drawn diagrams and colored annotations.
Copies were sent to a list that included the linguist Noam Chomsky,
the physicists John Archibald Wheeler, David Deutsch and Stephen
Hawking, and the mathematician John Casti.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has all the hallmarks of a crank,'' said Casti, who is
affiliated with the Technical University of Vienna and the Santa Fe
Institute in New Mexico. ``It's amazing all the stuff you can get
onto a single piece of paper.''
</P>
<P>
   But was it not just possible that couched in the obscure mix of
mathematics, physics and Egyptian mysticism (``ogdoad parity''
refers to four pairs of gods with names like Darkness, Absence and
Endlessness) there lay an important insight? Didn't two Cambridge
University mathematicians dismiss the great self-taught Indian
number theorist Srinvasa Ramanujan as a crackpot when he sent them
long eccentric letters from India early in this century? Only their
colleague G.H. Hardy had the foresight to recognize Ramanujan as a
genius. And didn't the great German mathematician Carl Friedrich
Gauss foolishly throw away unread a ground-breaking paper from his
young Norwegian colleague Niels Heinrik Abel calling it ``another
of those monstrosities''?
</P>
<P>
   Casti was not too worried about the possibility. Though the
stories of Ramanujan and Abel linger in the backs of
mathematicians' minds as they aim the latest unsolicited epistle
toward the wastebasket, most become quickly jaded.
</P>
<P>
   ``After several hundred of these things you get into that
mode,'' said Dr. Ian Stewart, a mathematician at Warwick University
in England. ``It has to do with your self-preservation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The writers of these letters range from pretty good amateur
mathematicians who have made a mistake somewhere or skipped over an
important step to people who are completely mad,'' he said. ``You
get very strange mail in 17 different fonts and 14 colors and with
an idiosyncratic grammar.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the correspondents are intelligent, well-meaning,
indefatigable souls who, in their untrained way, share the
fascination mathematicians feel for the invisible world of numbers.
And many are simply cranks.
</P>
<P>
   The equipment necessary for discovering a subatomic particle in
your own home costs too much and would never fit inside a basement
laboratory or even a very large backyard. But with nothing more
than a pencil and paper, and maybe a compass and straightedge, even
an amateur can explore the mathematical nether world, stumbling
across important new truths.
</P>
<P>
   That, anyway, is the dream or obsession that drives would-be
Ramanujans all over the world to send mathematicians letter after
letter crammed full of diagrams and equations promising answers to
unsolved problems ranging from squaring the circle or proving (in a
simpler way) Fermat's Last Theorem to revealing, through the
wonders of mathematics, the meaning of life.
</P>
<P>
   Physicists get their share of mail from amateurs attempting to
reconcile quantum mechanics and general relativity or to show that
Einstein was wrong. But the greater ease with which one can
speculate about numbers has caused the mathematical crank to become
enshrined in academic folklore.
</P>
<P>
   The phenomenon is even documented in a book called
``Mathematical Cranks'' (Mathematical Association of America,
1992), by Dr. Underwood Dudley, a mathematician at DePauw
University in Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been at this for a decade and still can't pin down
exactly what it is that makes a crank a crank,'' said Dudley, who
has met a few in person. ``They are usually men, old men,'' he
said. ``All are humorless. None of them are fat,'' a characteristic
he attributes to their obsessive personalities. ``It's like
obscenity _ you can tell a crank when you see one.''
</P>
<P>
   With recent films like ``Good Will Hunting'' and ``Pi'' giving
mathematics a romantic sheen and popular new biographies
romanticizing the lives of the eccentric mathematicians Paul Erdos
and John Nash, the flow of crank mail will only increase, predicted
Dr. John Allen Paulos, a mathematician at Temple University in
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Add millennial anxiety, including the Y2K problem, Paulos
speculated, and the time he and his colleagues spend opening and
discarding letters peppered with strange symbols and grand claims
is bound to increase. ``Popular mathematics used to be an
oxymoron,'' he said, ``but happily that's not true anymore.'' The
celebrity, though, has its price.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a real dilemma,'' said Dr. Reuben Hersh, professor
emeritus of mathematics at the University of New Mexico in
Albuquerque. ``Who is going to stroll through pages and pages of
stuff that is very hard to understand when you don't have to do it?
From the point of view of these guys, we are arrogant, unwilling to
reconsider ideas. And why shouldn't they expect a responsible
scientist to look carefully at some new idea that might be
important?
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't just say Ramanujan was a genius and these other guys
were cranks,'' Hersh said. ``With a superficial look, there is
hardly any visible difference. There is not always a sharp line
between eccentric mathematicians and intelligent but maybe obsessed
amateurs.''
</P>
<P>
   Until recently much of the mail contained supposed proofs of
Fermat's Last Theorem, involving a famous puzzle in number theory.
But since Dr. Andrew Wiles of Princeton University recently proved
the theorem, Paulos said, the focus has shifted to disproving
Wiles.
</P>
<P>
   Another favorite diversion is Goldbach's first conjecture, which
holds that all even numbers are the sum of two primes. Though no
one has found a counter example, this would-be theorem remains
unproven, unless the solution has been crumpled up in a math
department wastebasket somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Mathematicians are especially impatient with letters claiming to
have solved one of the three classical problems of Greek
mathematics: trisecting an angle (dividing it into three equal
parts), doubling a cube, or squaring a circle (constructing a
square with the exact same area as a circle) using only a compass
and an unmarked straightedge. The reason for imposing these
restrictions was to see how much mathematics could be derived from
two basic concepts, the line and the circle.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Solving the three classic problems this way has been proved
impossible. In 1882, for example, the German mathematician
Ferdinand Lindemann established that trying to square the circle
was hopeless. The reason is that pi, the ratio of the circumference
of a circle to its diameter, is not only irrational (its infinitely
long string of decimal places never repeats) but a transcendental
(it is not a solution of any polynomial equation with whole number
coefficients).
</P>
<P>
   Amateur attempts at squaring the circle generally amount to
rounding off pi to a close approximation like 22/7 or 355/113. At
best the result is a square that is very close but never exactly
the size of the circle.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people don't know what impossible means,'' Dudley
lamented. ``They think it just means very hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Or the writers do not believe the impossibility proofs. ``They
start by saying they know there is a theorem that says it is
impossible but they've done it anyway, so there must be something
wrong with the theorem,'' Stewart said. ``They are operating in a
conceptual vacuum. It leads to strange things.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the rules mathematicians soon learn is never to answer a
possible crank. The mail often comes with cover letters assuring
that the work has been ``endorsed'' by a certain Harvard or
Stanford professor, say, or even a member of the U.S. Senate. The
attached letters are usually no more than polite brushoffs: ``Thank
you for your interesting letter. ...'' A mathematician who makes a
perfunctory reply can count on its being stapled to the next round
of mailings.
</P>
<P>
   Hersh replied to a letter from an amateur mathematician in
India. ``This guy wrote very well,'' he said, ``in a good
expository style. His penmanship was fine. What he said made enough
sense that I thought I would try to explain and straighten him
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Over several years, Hersh realized that his correspondent had
come to believe that the whole edifice of mathematics was about to
crumble because of a dreadful mistake made centuries ago. Hersh
finally wrote back in exasperation: ``I've done all I can for you.
I can't do anymore.'' The writer answered that he did not consider
himself Hersh's student but rather his opponent in a debate.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, the rise of the Internet has not increased the
amount of mathematical crank mail. Most of the letters still come
typewritten, often on what appear to be manual typewriters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cranks are always about one level of technology behind,''
Dudley said. Casti said he imagined some of his correspondents as
``penniless guys in cold-water flats.'' They save paper and postage
by single-spacing and often type on both sides of the page.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, just sometimes, a mathematician finds that it pays to
answer an unsolicited letter, one that does not have what Stewart
calls ``the strange fairy dusting of lunacy.'' He once received a
clearly written letter from a man in China who believed he had
trisected the angle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew it had to be a fallacy, but it gave me a spur to try
and see where it was wrong,'' Stewart said. ``There were three
points in the diagram that looked as if they were on a straight
line, but actually were not.'' Stewart wrote back and received a
reply thanking him for pointing out the error. ``It is the only
time I've had any success convincing someone like this that they
were wrong,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago Stewart heard from a man in India who had
found a new, simpler proof for an obscure, pointless theorem in
number theory written by Ramanujan and a collaborator. According to
the Ramanujan-Nagell theorem, the only numbers one can square and
add 7 to, yielding an answer that is a power of 2, are 1, 3, 5, 11,
and 181. For example, squaring 3 and adding 7 gives 16, which is
the fourth power (the square of the square) of 2.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart was surprised to realize that the proof was correct, but
it was badly typed on strange paper and cast in an idiosyncratic
style that would have given any journal editor the impression that
the writer was a crank.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart advised the writer to find an Indian number theorist who
could teach him how to present a proper paper. Several years later
the result was published, and soon after came another publication
from the same man. ``It is worth reading these things
occasionally,'' Stewart said.
</P>
<P>
   But only occasionally, Dudley advised. ``There is always that
chance of success, but it is so small,'' he said. ``I've gone
through enough reams of crank stuff to know that the probability is
close to zero.''

`THREE-PEAT' UNLIKELY FOR THE DENVER BRONCOS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN CRUMPACKER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ While the Denver Broncos certainly seem well
stocked to make another run at the Super Bowl, they should know
that it's easy to be seduced by the prospect of a ``three-peat.''
</P>
<P>
   Only two teams in NFL history managed to win three straight
championships, and neither did in the full Super Bowl era.
</P>
<P>
   Green Bay won in 1965-'66-'67, with its first title preceding
Super Bowl I. Before Vince Lombardi's Packers did it, Curley
Lambeau's Packers did it first, winning in 1929-'30-'31, before the
league had a championship-game format.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, the Dallas Cowboys failed to three-peat in 1994
in part because of the split between Jerry Jones and Jimmy Johnson.
That, and a pretty good San Francisco 49ers team that year.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers were poised to three-peat in 1990 _ until Lawrence
Taylor's helmet dislodged the ball from Roger Craig's grasp in the
NFC Championship Game at Candlestick Park.
</P>
<P>
   The great Pittsburgh teams won back-to-back Super Bowls on two
occasions but could not string together a third straight in 1976
because of injuries to Franco Harris and Rocky Bleier and a
resolute Oakland Raiders team.
</P>
<P>
   The point is, something always seems to happen to teams in their
quest for a third straight championship. In today's NFL, two years
is a long time to remain dominant over everybody else; three years
seems to be the breaking point.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that's the lure for Denver. The Broncos are expected
to retain their full coaching staff and most of their offensive and
defensive stalwarts in 1999. Even the commissioner, Paul Tagliabue,
tried to get John Elway jazzed for '99 by saying he could be the
only player named MVP in the Super Bowl in two different centuries.
</P>
<P>
   Precisely 30 teams will spend their offseasons trying to figure
out a way to beat the Broncos. The odds are one team will arrive at
a solution.
</P>
<P>
   For Elway, the decision whether to retire or return is one of
romance vs. history. Few players in any sport manage to go out on
top, on their own terms.
</P>
<P>
   Elway has a chance to make his last game (not counting the Pro
Bowl, the most irrelevant sporting event in America) a Super Bowl
victory.
</P>
<P>
   It's either that or a mad dash tilting at the windmill of
history, with every sweeping blade designed to block a three-peat.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Herbal medicine, the mainstay of therapeutics for centuries
before modern purified drugs relegated it to the status of
near-quackery, has in the last five years emerged from the fringes
of health care with an astonishing flourish and now shows clear
signs of joining the medical mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   Despite many cautionary tales about adulterated and even
dangerous products, herbs formulated as capsules, tinctures,
extracts and teas _ and increasingly as additions to common foods
like potato chips and fruit drinks _ are now routinely used by a
third of American adults seeking to enhance their health or
alleviate their illnesses. Each day the herbal realm wins new
converts, particularly among those who have become disillusioned
with the cost and consequences of traditional drugs, distrustful of
conventional physicians and convinced that ``natural'' equals
``good.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, because herbal products are classified as dietary
supplements, not drugs, and face none of the premarket hurdles
drugs must clear, consumers have no assurance of safety or
effectiveness. Indeed, scores of products sold in the United States
are listed by European and American authorities as ineffective,
unsafe or both, and manufacturing standards to assure high quality
have been proposed but are not yet in force.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, countless consumers are wasting their money on useless
products or jeopardizing their health on hazardous ones. Among the
serious side effects that have been linked to herbal remedies are
high blood pressure, life-threatening allergic reactions, heart
rhythm abnormalities, mania, kidney failure and liver damage. A few
widely available products, including sassafras and comfrey, contain
known carcinogens.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, according to a report last year in the journal
Psychosomatics, unsuspecting consumers ``have used herbal remedies
with good results only to discover that the benefit was actually
derived from the presence of undisclosed medicines,'' including
steroids, anti-inflammatory agents, sedatives and hormones.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lack of quality standards is the No. 1 problem in the
whole industry,'' said Dr. Varro Tyler, emeritus professor of
pharmacognosy (the study of active ingredients in plants) at Purdue
University. Tyler, who has no financial connection to herbal
products and is arguably the nation's leading independent expert on
herbal medicine, said: ``I feel sorry for the typical consumer. How
is he or she to know what is best, what products are reliable and
safe? Even when a label says the product has been standardized, the
consumer has no way to know if it actually meets that standard.''
And even if an herbal product has been reliably made in some
standard dose, it does not mean that scientific studies have shown
it to be effective.
</P>
<P>
   The industry itself is promoting a ``good manufacturing
practices'' doctrine. Annette Dickinson, director of scientific and
regulatory affairs for the Council for Responsible Nutrition, a
trade organization for producers of dietary supplements, said a
consortium of associations submitted a document of manufacturing
standards to the Food and Drug Administration two years ago.
Although such a standard would say nothing about an herb's safety
or effectiveness, it would result in reliable methods that the
industry would have to use to assure the identity and quality of
its products. The agency has issued a notice of proposed rules but
no final ruling as yet.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, botanicals _ as herbal products are more accurately
known _ are enjoying an annual retail market approaching $4
billion, up from $839 million in 1991 and growing about 18 percent
a year. Hundreds of products formulated with virtually no
government oversight are crowding shelves of health food stores,
food markets and pharmacies nationwide. Supplements are also widely
sold by marketers like Amway, through catalogs and on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Now, even major pharmaceutical companies like Warner Lambert,
American Home Products, Bayer and SmithKline Beecham are
introducing herbal products, adding respectability to this
marginalized market.
</P>
<P>
   Some herbs _ like echinacea, goldenseal, American ginseng and
wild yam _ have become so popular that their continued supply from
natural sources is in danger. As the plants become scarcer and more
expensive, products containing them are increasingly likely to be
adulterated and may even contain none of the herb listed on the
label. Peggy Brevoort, president of East Earth Herb Inc., a company
in Eugene, Ore., that produces botanicals, said the demand for St.
John's wort, used for mild depression, and kava, a calmative said
to reduce anxiety, now exceeds their supply, introducing the
``danger of adulteration'' by ``unscrupulous dealers.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, two major new publications _ a 1,244-page
Physicians' Desk Reference for Herbal Medicines, produced by the
same company that publishes the Physicians' Desk Reference, and an
English-language edition of Germany's therapeutic guide to herbal
medicines, The Complete German Commission E Monographs _ have been
issued to help educate physicians, pharmacists and interested
consumers about the known uses, proper dosages and safety concerns
of more than 600 botanicals now sold in this country. The
evaluations in both books are based on studies, most done in
Germany and reviewed by teams of experts.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the National Institutes of Health began listing on
the Internet international bibliographic information on dietary
supplements, including herbal products. The address is
www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/IBIDS/.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a few medical and pharmacology schools have
recently introduced courses in phytomedicine, the study of
botanicals. And next month the American Pharmaceutical Association
will conduct a two-day program on herbal medicine as part of its
annual meeting. Still, most doctors remain wary of botanicals,
especially when patients choose self-medication with plant extracts
over established medical remedies.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The very act of Congress that has fostered this growth _ the
1994 Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act _ has also
permitted chaos to reign in the botanical marketplace, with no
mechanism to assure that products are safe or effective. Pushed
heavily by Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, the home base of
many supplement makers, and passed over the objections of the FDA,
the law created a new product class, the dietary supplement, that
was not subject to regulations applied to drugs. Now any substance
that can be found in foods, regardless of amount or action and
including substances that act as hormones or toxins, can be
produced and sold without any premarket testing or agency approval.
</P>
<P>
   Marketed as neither a food nor a drug, herbal products are not
obliged to meet any established standards of effectiveness or
safety for medicinal products, which require extensive laboratory
and clinical trials before approval. As with other substances
classified as dietary supplements, the FDA can restrict the sale of
an herbal product only if it receives well-documented reports of
health problems associated with it. The agency took four years, and
more than 100 reports of life-threatening symptoms and 38 deaths,
to act against ephedra, often sold as the Chinese herb ma huang, a
stimulant that can prove disastrous to people with heart problems.
</P>
<P>
   With FDA authority limited by the 1994 law, the Federal Trade
Commission, which monitors advertising, has taken a more active
role in monitoring supplement makers.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC last year took legal action against seven manufacturers
that had broken rules requiring advertising be truthful and
verifiable. The companies were selling remedies or purported
cure-alls for ailments like impotence, cancer and obesity.
</P>
<P>
   The commission also sent e-mail warnings to 1,200 Internet sites
that it said had made ``incredible claims'' for drugs, devices and
supplements, including herbal remedies that would supposedly ward
off AIDS. Also, the commission late last year issued its first set
of advertising guidelines aimed specifically at the supplement
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the current regulations have created a quagmire of
consumer confusion and set up potential health crises that even
industry officials say could ultimately hurt producers as well as
users of herbal products. Under the 1994 law, consumers have no
assurance that an herbal product contains what the label says it
does or that it is free from harmful contaminants. Independent
analyses of some products, particularly those containing costly or
scarce herbs, revealed that some have little or none of the
purported active ingredient listed on the label.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the confusion is that botanical makers are allowed to
describe products only in terms of their effects on the structure
or function of the body, not their potential health benefits. Thus,
a product label might say ``promotes cardiac function'' but it
cannot say ``lowers cholesterol.''
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, although the law does allow health warnings on the
label, most manufacturers have yet to include them.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers are warned, however, that federal drug safety
officials are not watching the store. All botanicals must display a
disclaimer on the label following the description of the product's
structural or functional role: ``This statement has not been
evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration. This product is not
intended to diagnose, treat, cure or prevent any disease.'' To
which Tyler commented, ``If that is true, why on earth would anyone
use it?''
</P>
<P>
   The seeds of the modern herbal market were sown in the '60s when
``green, organic and natural became buzzwords,'' Tyler said. But
they did not mature until the '90s with the growing consumer
interest in ``self-care and controlling one's destiny,'' he said.
Many turned to herbs as a gentler way to treat health problems and
a potential tool for preserving mental and physical health.
</P>
<P>
   The interest has spawned scores of Internet sites and hundreds
of books on various herbs. But much of the literature is replete
with poorly documented health claims and, with few exceptions
(among them, Tyler's books), advocacy prevails over objectivity.
</P>
<P>
   Because plants contain a mixture of relatively diluted
chemicals, they naturally tend to have milder actions, both in
their therapeutic benefits and side effects, than the concentrated,
single chemicals in most drugs. Thus, botanicals generally take
longer to act than regular pharmaceuticals and few have the potency
of a prescription, the one possible exception being saw palmetto,
which a well-designed study indicated may be as helpful for an
enlarged prostate as the more expensive and riskier drug, Proscar.
</P>
<P>
   The combination of chemicals in botanicals is potentially both a
plus and a minus. When two or more chemicals enhance one another's
activity, the therapeutic benefit could theoretically exceed that
of an isolated substance formulated as a drug. Mark Blumenthal, who
heads the American Botanical Council, noted that the herb St.
John's wort, widely used in Germany and increasingly in the United
States to counter mild depression, is standardized for a substance
called hypericin. But, he explained, ``hypericin is not directly
linked to its antidepressant activity.'' Rather, other substances
in the herb seem to have diverse actions on brain chemicals, all of
which work together to counter depression.
</P>
<P>
   Equally possible, though, when using an herb with two or more
active chemicals, is that one will cancel the benefits of another
or introduce a hazard. Without careful chemical tests and large,
well-controlled clinical trials such actions are often hard to
detect.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer confidence in herbal medicine is bolstered by the
common but erroneous assumption that ``natural'' equals ``safe''
and the public's failure to realize that many plants contain
chemicals that are potent drugs or outright poisons. Natural
laxatives like the herb Cascara sagrada are just as habit-forming
and harmful to the colon as laxatives sold as drugs.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, one quarter of prescription drugs and hundreds of
over-the-counter products were originally isolated from plants.
Ephedra, for example, contains a natural stimulant that is approved
for use as a decongestant and bronchial dilator in some
pharmaceutical products. However, when used in uncontrolled dosages
or by people with certain underlying health problems, it can cause
a dangerous rise in blood pressure and, in its herbal form, has
been responsible for serious adverse reactions and dozens of
deaths, mainly among people who inappropriately used it as a
stimulant or diet aid.
</P>
<P>
   Complicating the safety issue is the fact, shown in several
recent surveys, that most patients fail to tell their physicians
they use herbal supplements and thus sometimes risk dangerous drug
interactions or endure costly tests or treatments when an herb
causes an unrecognized side effect. Experts say many patients
withhold information about herbal drug use because they fear being
ridiculed by their doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Although all German physicians must take courses on herbal
remedies, only a handful of American medical and pharmacology
schools offer courses in this field.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, the President's Commission on Dietary Supplement
Labels recommended that the FDA appoint a committee to evaluate the
safety and effectiveness of herbal products. ``This could be the
most important step in the United States toward legitimizing herbal
medicine,'' Tyler said.
</P>
<P>
   However, the agency responded that it lacked the budget to
support such an effort. American physicians have completed and
published only a few well-designed studies of some popular
botanicals. Among them were studies showing that saw palmetto can
shrink an enlarged prostate and ginkgo biloba can improve memory in
patients with early Alzheimer's disease.
</P>
<P>
   The Office of Dietary Supplements at the National Institutes of
Health is helping to finance a three-year multicenter study of St.
John's wort as a treatment for clinical depression and a study of
plant-based estrogens as a preventive for postmenopausal health
problems.
</P>
<P>
   However, thousands of studies of botanicals have been completed
abroad _ mainly in Germany _ that strongly suggest a
health-promoting role for more than 200 plant products. Germany's
Commission E evaluated 380 botanicals, approving 254 as safe and
reasonably effective and disapproving 126 as ineffective, unsafe or
both.
</P>
<P>
   The Germans use a different criterion to assess an herb's
benefits _ a doctrine of ``reasonable certainty'' that the herb has
the desired effect and is safe, Blumenthal said. Whereas standard
testing of a drug for approval by the FDA can cost as much as $500
million per product _ a prohibitive amount for companies to spend
on botanicals that cannot be patented _ tests to establish
``reasonable certainty'' would cost only $1 million to $2 million,
Tyler estimated.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1996, Dr. Robert Temple, director of medical policy for
the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation, suggested that, rather than
subjecting botanicals to the extensive tests required for drugs,
the agency might consider applying less stringent criteria to
assess an herb's effects, at least when a product is to be used
only for a short time. He said, ``A long history of safe use might
provide sufficient safety information for products that are
intended for short-term use.''
</P>
<P>
   More than four dozen botanicals or botanical formulations have
been submitted to the agency as investigational new drugs. If any
meet the agency's criteria for safety and effectiveness and are
eventually approved as drugs, they would be allowed to carry direct
health claims _ instead of just structure and function statements _
on labels and in advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Dr. Joerg Gruenwald, medical director of a German
phytomedicine company and primary editor of the new Physicians'
Desk Reference for Herbal Medicines, said professionals can rely on
that volume for current, documented information about botanicals.
The volume, to be issued annually, updates the Commission E reports
and adds several hundred other products sold in the United States,
listing effects, side effects and conditions in which their use is
inadvisable.

GETTING THE LEAD OUT  
 SPYING ON THE SOLAR WIND  
 FOSSIL DATES LAND BRIDGE 
</HEADLINE>

   For years, leaded gasoline was an environmental bad boy, blamed
for high atmospheric lead levels in urban areas. The introduction
of no-lead at the pump in the 1970s and its eventual universal use
were thought to be responsible for declines in levels of the metal
in the atmosphere and in the blood of urban residents.
</P>
<P>
   But a new study shows the knock on leaded gasoline might not
have been wholly deserved. The work, by scientists from Columbia
University, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and the New York State
Department of Environmental Conservation, suggests that, in the New
York area at least, the burning of garbage, not gasoline, spewed
most of the lead into the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers examined core samples from the bottom of Central
Park Lake and ended up with a record of heavy-metal pollutants
beginning in the 1860s that showed lead levels reaching their peak
from the late 1930s to the early 60s. This was before the heyday of
leaded gasoline, and corresponded with a rise in incinerator
construction and use in the New York area.
</P>
<P>
   The peak use of leaded gasoline in the late 60s and early 70s
added only a relatively small fraction to the lead deposits.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers, whose study appears in the journal
Environmental Science and Technology, noted that the use of waste
incinerators declined in the New York area as environmental laws
were passed in the mid-1960s. &QL;

   The origin of the solar wind is no mystery. But not much has
been known about precisely how the wind _ the high-speed stream of
electrically charged gas that can interfere with electronic
instruments on and above Earth _ emanates from the Sun. It has long
been thought to originate from open magnetic fields, called coronal
holes.
</P>
<P>
   New observations using instruments aboard the Solar and
Heliospheric Observatory spacecraft, which sits a million miles out
from Earth with an unobstructed view of the Sun, have helped flesh
out the picture.
</P>
<P>
   The observations, reported in the journal Science by a team of
researchers from five countries, show that the wind flows outward
through these coronal holes, along magnetic field lines surrounding
cells in the chromosphere, the part of the Sun's atmosphere just
below the corona.
</P>
<P>
   In this way the Sun is a little like a pasta machine that makes
ziti by extruding dough around a circular die. The magnetic field
lines in the chromosphere delineate many such ``dies,'' with the
``dough,'' the solar wind, emanating from around them. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Forget about that bridge to the 21st century. Of greater
interest to scientists is a land bridge that existed millions of
years ago, when Eurasia and North America were joined across what
is now the Bering Strait, allowing terrestrial animals and plants
on the continents to mix, while marine organisms were segregated
between the Arctic-North Atlantic and the Pacific oceans.
</P>
<P>
   The date the bridge first disappeared _ through tectonic shifts
or rising sea levels _ is important because the situation suddenly
was reversed. A fossil found in southern Alaska has put the date of
the first opening as at least 4.8 million years ago, and perhaps as
much as 7.3 million years ago, which is up to 4 million years
earlier than previously thought.
</P>
<P>
   The fossil, described by American and Russian scientists in a
recent issue of Nature, is of a type of mollusk, called Astarte,
that had been known to exist only in the Arctic and North Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers noted that the mollusk appeared in the Pacific
much earlier than Pacific mollusks show up in the Arctic and North
Atlantic. They speculate that the flow through the opened strait
may at first have been predominantly southward, from the
Arctic-Atlantic to the Pacific. Then about a million years later,
when the isthmus of Panama closed, the flow reversed to bring
Pacific organisms to the Atlantic. &QL;

   CLINTON-HUSSEIN _ AMMAN, Jordan _ During six years of on-again
off-again efforts to end half a century of enmity and bloodshed in
the Middle East, Clinton has known no more steadfast a companion in
the peace process than King Hussein, whose remains were laid to
rest here Monday. Now, with the peace process stalled and lurching
toward a potentially disasterous May 4 deadline for the resolution
of a thorny set of outstanding issues between Palestinians and
Israelis, the White House is contemplating the abscence of a man
National Security adviser Samuel Berger called, ''the transcendent

years.'' (Deans, Cox News Service)

   It is hard not to feel like a child in Blake Mays' recess class
at Crunch Fitness in New York City. While doing jumping jacks
during a game of Simon Says, heaving a ``hot potato'' and
kickboxing a Weeble-Wobble-like clown beanbag, participants are
transported back to the grade-school playground. At the end of
class, everyone gets a gold star in the form of a red apple.
</P>
<P>
   What is the goal of all this playful activity? ``Recess is about
having fun, getting a great cardiovascular workout and toning and
sculpting the body,'' Mays said as he blew a shrill Daffy Duck
whistle, signaling that it was time to switch to leapfrogging over
step platforms, jumping on small trampolines and hopscotching
through the hula hoops of an obstacle course. ``It's play time
without the bully,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other fitness clubs around the country are offering similar
kinds of classes, hoping that this trend of play as exercise can
make fitness more fun and entice people into the gym. ``Health
clubs are striving to bring back a carefree spirit of exercise in
their classes, and most of us look back on our childhood days in
gym class as just that,'' said Cathy Masterson McNeil, spokesman
for the International Health, Racquet and Sports Club Association,
a trade organization for health clubs based in Boston. ``Children
don't view exercise as an obligation, and that's the challenge of
many health clubs _ making people see fitness as taking a break and
not as a burden.''
</P>
<P>
   On the West Coast, Gorilla Sports, a health club in San
Francisco, offers a version of play time called speed camp.
``Working out should be entertaining and physically challenging,
not something you have to force yourself to get through,'' said
Dave Fox, founder of the gym and speed camp's instructor. This
two-hour class includes stretching and conditioning drills during
the first half, all in preparation for the second part of class,
``game hour.'' Dodge ball, the 40-yard dash, broad jumps and
suicide runs (running to the middle of a basketball court, then
back to the baseline, then all the way to the end of the court and
back to baseline) are designed to increase speed and agility, Fox
said.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, on Saturdays in Chicago, people line up for PE 101 at
the East Bank Club. ``This class runs the gamut of calisthenics,
athletic drills and races using medicine balls, jump ropes and
slide mats to do relay races, crab crawls and play dodge ball _
basically, all the things you did in PE,'' said Nancy Fudacz, the
instructor of the class and director of exercise programs at the
club.
</P>
<P>
   In the Kids at Heart class at Sportslife Fitness in Atlanta,
leap frog, double-dutch jump rope, freeze tag and wheelbarrow and
potato sack races are standard activities. ``The members really get
into it,'' said Melissa Layne, instructor and executive director of
Group Fitness.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the motivational factor, these kinds of classes
offer undeniable fitness benefits. ``In an hour-long class that's
focused on cardiovascular activity, your heart rate is going to be
elevated for at least 20 minutes, and you'll easily burn 150
calories,'' said Dr. Michele S. Olson, an associate professor of
exercise science at Auburn University in Montgomery, Ala. ``Your
heart doesn't care whether it's stimulated by treadmill jogging,
playing hopscotch or running relays,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Thayer, 41, the operations manager for an Atlanta job
recruitment firm, agrees: ``At first the group I work out with at
the gym thought Kids at Heart would be a joke. Then we got there
and were surprised to find just how out of shape we really were.''

 &HT;    WORLD LEADERS PAY TRIBUTE, AS KING HUSSEIN IS LAID TO REST
 &HT;    With HUSSEIN-JORDAN-0209; CLINTON-HUSSEIN-0209;
HUSSEIN-PRESIDENTS-0209.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMMAN, Jordan _ Hailing the late King Hussein as a symbol of
history and a man of peace, President Clinton headed an
extraordinary array of world leaders on Monday who helped this
desert kingdom lay to rest the monarch that led it through nearly
five rocky decades in the troubled heart of the fractious Middle
East.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton called on those leaders, collectively and individually,
to build on Hussein's legacy by working to bring an end to half a
century of enmity and war across an ancient and blood-stained
region that gave birth to three of the world's great religions.
</P>
<P>
   After a 25-minute meeting with Hussein's son and successor, King
Abdullah, Clinton said he had ''great confidence,'' in the
37-year-old monarch's ability to guide this nation of 4.4 million
and maintain its close military, political and economic ties to the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was joined by former U.S. Presidents Ford, Carter and
Bush, in a symbol, Clinton said, of the importance Americans attach
to their relationship with Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   ''America's interests and America's heart were close to this
king and this country,'' Clinton told a couple hundred U.S. Embassy
personnel gathered here Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have great confidence in the young king of Jordan,'' Clinton
said. ''He clearly understands his mission.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made his remarks after attending a day of funeral
services, condolence sessions and casual, off-the-cuff
conversations with dozens of heads of state that came here to pay
their last respects to Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   They joined hundreds of thousands of grief-stricken Jordanians
who lined up five people deep along narrow streets and broad
boulevards, as Hussein's funeral procession wound through more than
12 miles of this low-rise capital of sandstone and marble.
</P>
<P>
   Dignitaries in dark suits and Jordanians from all walks of life,
their red and white checkered keffiyeh (head scarves) streaming
from their heads, turned out on a chilly but sun-splashed day to
watch Hussein's body pass by, borne in a small wooden coffin draped
with the red, white, green and black flag of Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Bedouin soldiers paid full military honors to Hussein, who died
Sunday of cancer at the age of 63, after ruling this country for 47
often tumultuous years.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he was laid to rest in a simple cotton shroud amid
the cypress and pine trees in the hilltop family cemetery where his
grandfather, Abdullah, and his father, Talal, are buried, only a
small cadre of Muslim men were nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and other foreign dignitaries were kept a respectful
distance from the gravesite, and women, including Hussein's
American-born wife, Queen Noor, were forbidden to come near, in
accordance with Islamic tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after dark, the haunting tones of the nightly Islamic
call to prayer boomed out from loudspeakers and echoed across the
stark but immaculately kept palace grounds.
</P>
<P>
   The most gripping public moment occurred, however, when Queen
Noor stepped through the cream-colored columns of the ornate
Raghadan Palace, with her two daughters Iman and Rayah and
Hussein's daughter by an earlier marriage, Haya, at her side, all
draped in dark flowing mourning garb, their heads covered with
matching white shawls.
</P>
<P>
   Sensing that her younger daughter, Rayah, was shaken by the
event and a sudden crush of cameras, the Queen leaned over and gave
the child a spontaneous kiss on her forehead, ushered the girls
into a metallic blue Mercedes, hopped into the driver's seat and
wheeled off into the night.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, who had
been meeting with the queen while Clinton met with Abdullah,
stepped into the polished marble palace foyer, greeted the grieving
young king, then walked out into a starlit night with the president
and into a waiting presidential limousine.
</P>
<P>
   If it was a day of grieving the loss of Hussein, however, it was
also a day of casual diplomacy for Clinton, who found himself
surrounded by some 50 heads of states from every continent and
every corner of the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
   No major successes were claimed, but the sheer variety of
leaders present offered Clinton a unique opportunity to burnish his
personal relationship with a remarkable array of his counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know whether there has ever been such a large
delegation of leaders from around the world for the funeral of any
leader,'' said Clinton's National Security Adviser, Samuel
``Sandy'' Berger. ''The kaleidoscope of the world was here.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the international showing was a tribute to
Hussein's ability to bring together leaders with disparate goals
and unite them in common purpose.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was really a beautiful sight, people coming from all around
the world, countries that are at each other's throats, here meeting
in peace and friendship and the sanctity of the umbrella of this
great man,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to
discuss the stalled Israeli-Palestinian peace process.
</P>
<P>
   He chatted with British Prime Minister Tony Blair and French
President Jacques Chirac about ongoing efforts to end bloodshed in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Russian President Boris Yeltsin greeted Clinton with a hearty
greeting, hollering out ''Beeel Cleenton,'' in ''his big bear
voice,'' as Clinton walked into a large tent that served as a
meeting place for foreign dignitaries, said Berger.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also met one-on-one with Syrian President Hafez
al-Assad, who led an attack on Jordan in 1970 in a purported effort
to aid the members of the Palestine Liberation Organization living
in Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   ''The president said, you know, 'I want you to, I hope you will
support Jordan,''' Berger recounted to reporters. ''And he (Assad)
said, 'Yes.' But I mean, you know, I couldn't see in his heart.''
</P>
<P>
   The funeral also brought Clinton together with three of his four
surviving predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   The presidents, who all flew over aboard the presidential
aircraft, Air Force One, spent much of their time together
recalling their own efforts to bring about peace in the Middle
East.
</P>
<P>
   ''They've literally spent the whole day together,'' said White
House spokesman Joe Lockhart. ''Throughout the day they have walked
as a group, joined each other's conversations,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''For President Clinton, it's been a great opportunity to draw
upon the vast knowledge and expertise that this group has.''

   AMMAN, Jordan _ Grief washed across the crowded streets of this
downcast capital in waves Monday. The waves swelled with the cries
of ``God is Great'' as a motorcade bearing the casket of Jordan's
King Hussein slowly approached waiting crowds. And they crested in
the sobs of the old and young, farmers and Yuppies, as their
familiar leader passed for the last time.
</P>
<P>
   Among the hundreds of thousands(CQ) lining the streets and
overpasses, many had trouble letting go of their king. Hundreds
tried to run along side of the slow-moving military Land Rover that
carried him. Thousands swarmed the vehicle as it approached the
gates of his palace grounds. They were barely held back by
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Along the route, the stern soldiers lined the roads wielding
M-16 rifles. But, by the time Hussein's motorcade passed, carrying
its wave of emotion, even many of them were in tears.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein, who died of cancer Sunday at the age of 63 and after 46
years as king, was carried to his resting place in the royal
cemetery where his father and grandfather are buried.
</P>
<P>
   He was escorted by red military Land Rovers with mounted machine
guns. His vehicle was khaki, and his coffin, draped in the
Jordanian flag, sat amid a bed of white flowers.
</P>
<P>
   Awaiting him at his destination were dozens of the world's
leaders, some of them officially enemies with each other. They had
come together to honor a man who had built his tiny country into
the centerpiece of Middle Eastern stability and worked tirelessly
for peace.
</P>
<P>
   But, on the streets of Amman, the attachment was personal and
spiritual, rather than political.
</P>
<P>
   Bystanders tossed flowers toward Hussein's casket and longed for
other ways to touch their fallen monarch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to reach out to his coffin and take his hand and kiss
it,'' said Jordanian Marlene Khoury, 42. She and her two daughters
were dressed in black and sobbed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like an orphan,'' said daughter Jan Khoury, 26.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein holds an almost demi-God status with his people.
</P>
<P>
   Old women with black flags wailed their mournful chants -- ``I
wish it were my brother or father instead of him!'' People called
him their brother and father and glorified his bloodline's direct
descent from the Moslem prophet Mohammad.
</P>
<P>
   Although Jordan's economy is a shambles and, under Hussein, the
country has lost wars and had bread riots, he was held largely
blameless. His people remember him for keeping the vulnerable
country together and in relative peace while conflagrations have
raged around it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not like in America, where you blame everything on the
president,'' said Sulieman Nader, a 20-year-old Jordanian who
attends the Michigan Technological College. ``We all know how hard
it is for Jordan to exist in this volatile region.''
</P>
<P>
   Nader held the red, green, black and white Jordanian flag and
gazed at a glossy billboard-sized picture of Hussein. In it, the
King's face glows against a red sunset. In the foreground is the
needle nose of a shiny jet fighter -- evocative of the dashing
leader's hobby as a pilot infatuated with fast airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still in a state of shock,'' Nader said. ``I'm only 20
years old. Unfortunately, the youth here didn't get our share of
King Hussein. It's not fair.''
</P>
<P>
   Unable to mingle with the dignitaries behind the gates of the
palace, bystanders gave personal, roadside eulogies. They talked
about nephews who received special medical treatment after requests
for help from Hussein's palace, or widows that received salaries
from him.
</P>
<P>
   Those touches of personal generosity -- from a king who also
loved the high-life of sports cars and European palaces -- cemented
his peoples' loyalty. A large portion of the population had met the
king personally.
</P>
<P>
   Adnan Kosmar remembered a previous time he encountered the king
on this city's roads. During a rare snowstorm in 1992, Kosmar's car
got stuck on a median strip. He was astonished to see Hussein pull
over and personally help push his Oldsmobile back onto the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``He smiled at me,'' Kosmar said. ``And I kissed him.''
</P>
<P>
   Hussein's greatest feat was unity, sewing together a country
from a mix of varied and displaced people. Those demographics were
visible on the roadsides Monday.
</P>
<P>
   There were Bedouin vegetable farmers with their faces covered in
red-and-white head scarves -- a sign of mourning. There were trendy
Palestinians, in leather jackets and loafers looking at the king
who integrated their people after they lost their homes in what is
now Israel. There were wealthy Jordanians with Armani sunglasses.
</P>
<P>
   Nervous about their country's future, they welcomed the
dignitaries behind the gate of the castle -- even U.S. President
Bill Clinton, who is often criticized on Jordan's streets for his
bombardments of neighboring Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who respect our king, respect us. We respect them,''
Mohammad Al-Boty, a stocky, 47-year-old accountant. He was composed
and analytical until Hussein passed. Then he started sobbing.

 &HT;    THE AIR FORCE ONE CLUB: EX-PRESIDENTS SHARE TALES, ADVICE ON
FLIGHT TO JORDAN
 &HT;    With HUSSEIN-FUNERAL-0209.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service

<P>
   AMMAN, Jordan _ It was, by any measure, a night to remember
aboard Air Force One.
</P>
<P>
   For gathered in the cabin devoted to senior White House staff
were the most senior such officials imaginable -- Presidents
Clinton, Bush, Carter and Ford, spinning tales from their
respective administrations and batting around global issues deep
into the night, as the Carolina blue 747 soared high above the
Atlantic Ocean en route to this Middle East capital.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was a very friendly, serious, substantive discussion of
the Middle East peace process, Kosovo, Russia,'' said National
Security Adviser Samuel Berger, who participated in the two-hour
senior seminar. ''It was really quite an extraordinary, a very
interesting discussion.''
</P>
<P>
   What brought the elite leadership club together was the funeral
here Monday of King Hussein, who ruled Jordan for 47 years until
his death from cancer on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The irony wasn't lost on the presidential group.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hussein really did bring people together,'' said Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ''Here we are, two Democrats, two Republicans,'' Clinton said.
''We've agreed on many things, we've disagreed on a thing or two
over time.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing the men all agreed on, though, was the the loss of
Hussein's statesmanship in pursuit of Mideast peace was a blow to
global diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think I've ever seen a greater outpouring of the
world's appreciation and the world's love for a human being that
I've seen today,'' said Carter, speaking with his presidential
peers to a group of U.S. Embassy personnel here Monday night.
''It's a true expression of what King Hussein has meant to all of
us personally.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter's own efforts to bring about Mideast peace -- efforts he
worked closely with Hussein on -- stretch back to the earliest days
of his presidency, in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   He'd only been in office two weeks, Carter recalled, when
Hussein's third wife, Alia, was killed in a helicopter crash.
</P>
<P>
   That spring, Hussein came to visit Carter in the White House,
primarily to urge the new president to take on a bold pursuit of
Mideast peace, an initiative that would eventually lead to Carter
brokering the Camp David accords between Israel and Egypt in
September, 1978.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was a peanut farmer who had never met a king,'' Carter
recalled, explaining how he had worked with his daughter Amy, then
nine, about how to address His Majesty the king.
</P>
<P>
   ''And when we met the royal family the first thing Amy shouted
was, 'Hi Prince,''' Carter said, kicking off what was to become an
enduring personal relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Carter also recalled during that visit standing on the Truman
Balcony with Hussein and gazing out across the South Lawn one
evening, watching the airplanes take off and land from what is now
Reagan National Airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``He began to tell me about his recent tragic loss, and he began
to weep,'' Carter said. ''He said he was just exhausted from his
sorrow and from the duties on his shoulders. And I suggested that
he spend a couple of weeks in Georgia.''
</P>
<P>
   King Hussein did go, taking a vacation near Brunswick.
</P>
<P>
   ''He hunted and fished and swam,'' said Carter. ''And I gave
him, without asking anybody's permission, since I was the
commander-in-chief, a helicopter to fly around in. And I think he
enjoyed it.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Cloudy skies and a few snow showers will mark the passage of a
cold front in western New England. Only a few clouds along with
shifting winds will be noted along the North Atlantic coast. It
will be blustery and cool in the northern and eastern Great Lakes
as high pressure builds over the upper Mississippi Valley.
</P>
<P>
   A large fair weather system in the southwest Atlantic will
circulate unusually mild air into the Southeast. Sunshine will be
dimmed by some clouds away from the coast, but temperatures will
rise to near record levels in many sections. Florida will stay
balmy with ample sunshine and gentle winds.
</P>
<P>
   Showers will develop in the lower Mississippi and Tennessee
Valleys as humid air flowing northward from the Gulf of Mexico is
acted on by a jet stream disturbance. Fog will be dense in some
sections of the South. A couple of strong thunderstorms may form in
eastern Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   Mild weather will dominate the central and northern Plains
despite limited sunshine. A cold front will approach from the
Rockies late in the day. Increasing winds from the south should
scour out pockets of gelid air in the eastern Dakotas.
</P>
<P>
   Much colder air from the North Pacific will surge across the
Northwest. Snow levels in the northern Cascades will reach near the
surface in Washington. A disturbance on the front will cross
central and southern California producing heavy rain and chilly
winds. Showers will reach into the deserts late. Snow levels will
decrease substantially in the southern Sierra.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Southeast Simmers
</P>
<P>
   The mercury rose to a record 80 degrees on Sunday afternoon in
Columbia, S.C. This reading was just a few degrees shy of the
all-time February maximum. A few weeks ago, Asheville, N.C.,
reached 80 degrees, setting a new all-time January record. Since
the frigid weather left the northern tier of the nation in the
middle of January, a ridge of high pressure has dominated the
Southeast. This atmospheric feature has prevented the development
of northeasters. However, a surge of chilly air will reach the
Southeast this weekend, perhaps reversing the recent trend.

   Q. (italics)How do archeologists estimate past populations?(end
italics)
</P>
<P>
   A. There are some rules of thumb for estimates for a limited
area, but estimates for whole countries or the world are ``just
guesstimates,'' said Tony Wilkinson, a research associate at the
Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   What archeologists tend to do, he explained, is to find and
count all the formerly inhabited sites in a study area; make an
educated guess about which ones were occupied at a certain period,
usually based on pottery of a certain age found on the surface, and
then from the total occupied area make a rough estimate. Evidence
from aerial photos and satellite images may also be used.
</P>
<P>
   ``From modern village studies,'' he said, ``we can say about 100
or 200 people occupy a hectare of a modern settlement, and apply
this estimate to the past.'' (A hectare, an area of 100 meters by
100 meters, is about two and a half acres.)
</P>
<P>
   There are tremendous variations and uncertainties in such
estimates. For example, big sites covered with the pottery of one
period may indicate big cities, Wilkinson said, and some, like old
Damascus and old Jerusalem, show evidence of densities of 500 to
600 people per hectare.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a specific area, we can justify our approximations, but as
soon as we go to an area larger than the study area, there are
problems,'' he said. He said estimates might typically be made for
areas of 500 square kilometers up to 2,000 square kilometers, large
areas but not country-sized. &QL;

CANADIANS ON THE BRINK OF REDEFINING `SPOUSAL' BENEFITS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thirty-one years have passed since Canada's justice minister,
Pierre Elliott Trudeau, gave a bit of a start to his staid country
by telling a conference, ``The state has no place in the bedrooms
of the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   The remark helped propel Trudeau into the prime minister's
office. It also heralded criminal-code revisions that removed
penalties against private sexual acts between consenting adults.
</P>
<P>
   Canada is at the brink of making another startling move, one
that many religious conservatives have furiously resisted in the
United States. Federal Cabinet ministers have said the Canadian
government will act to erase all legal differences between
homosexual and heterosexual couples.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Minister Anne McClellan recently announced that the
government will not appeal the so-called Rosenberg ruling, a 1998
court decision in Ontario that ordered that ``spouse'' be redefined
to include gay partners in benefits.
</P>
<P>
   British Columbia already has acted along the same lines for the
province's 225,000 public employees. Last year, it passed
legislation that added same-sex partners to the list of people who
can be designated recipients of pension benefits. In the early
1990s, the city of Vancouver adopted a same-sex benefit policies
for its employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were the first, and we've done two very significant
things,'' said the Rev. Tim Stevenson, a United Church of Canada
minister who represents downtown Vancouver in the B.C. Legislature.
He also is gay and in a long-term relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first was to change the definition of spouse to include
same-sex couples. They are treated the same as heterosexual married
couples and common-law couples who have been together for at least
two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1998, we extended pensions to same-sex couples in the
public service, anyone who in any way works for the provincial
government or crown (government-owned) corporations. We want
private companies to take similar action of their own accord, so we
don't have to bring in legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   In British Columbia, the pension legislation was supported not
only by the ruling, left-leaning New Democratic Party, but also by
a majority of opposition legislators.
</P>
<P>
   Canada's Liberal Party has a majority in Parliament, and
likewise can count on some lawmakers from other parties if it
redefines ``spouse'' and extends pension benefits to same-sex
couples.
</P>
<P>
   But Prime Minister Jean Chretien has hesitated, even after his
Cabinet ministers announced the change. Chretien said he did not
know whether more legislation would be required.
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister's hesitation may relate to Canada's most
outspoken conservative prelate, Vancouver's Catholic Archbishop
Adam Exner.
</P>
<P>
   Exner was vociferous in condemning British Columbia's
redefinition of spouse. He raised the specter of ``special rights''
being extended to homosexuals, and claimed that a same-sex couple
cannot be considered married because ``biologically, such couples
are not equipped to be husband and wife.'' The archbishop warned
that Catholics, to whom he referred as ``our people,'' would make
their voices heard ``when election time comes about.''
</P>
<P>
   Exner took a similar strong position in a Jan. 27 letter to
Chretien. Speaking for Canada's Catholic hierarchy, he wrote: ``We
are deeply concerned that equating homosexual partners with married
and common-law couples could lead to a redefinition of marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Surely the government can think of a way to respond to the
legal challenges it faces from same-sex partners without redefining
terms that millions of Canadians cherish and undermining an
institution that plays a pivotal role in society.''
</P>
<P>
   Exner has also come up with an alternative. Instead of
same-gender couples, he suggested that pension and social benefits
be granted to anyone in a long-term, caring relationship _ such as
elderly siblings caring for each other.
</P>
<P>
   The archbishop is supported by such groups as the Langley,
B.C.-based Citizens Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Its executive director, Kari Simpson, has stumped British
Columbia with a pro-family message reminiscent of the Christian
Coalition in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me that the Canadian way is to let courts rule the
country,'' Simpson said. ``It brings political correctness to a new
height.''
</P>
<P>
   But other major religious groups have taken a different stand.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the United Church, the Anglican Church and the Canadian
Jewish Congress strongly backed the Canadian government when it
outlawed discrimination against gays and lesbians.
</P>
<P>
   The same groups have lined up behind giving social benefits to
same-sex couples. Vancouver's Anglican Bishop Michael Ingham told
the Vancouver Sun that the traditional, heterosexual family is not
threatened by society's decision to recognize a variety of
``long-term relationships.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People's attitudes have changed in our society, and are far
more accepting of equality for gays and lesbians,'' said Stevenson,
the United Church of Christ minister from Vancouver. ``We don't
have the extreme religious right you have to deal with in the
states.''

IN NEPAL, ARRANGED MARRIAGE GIVES WAY TO COURTSHIP BY MISSIVE

   They are deeply felt and extravagantly phrased: ``To my dear, my
dearest, dearest love,'' a 22-year-old man writes to an 18-year-old
woman, ``from your lover who is always, always drowning in your
love and remembrances, I send love and remembrances forever that,
like a river, can never dry up and break.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Life is an infinite circle,'' writes another man, 21. ``I'm
offering you an invitation to love. If you are capable of accepting
it, then accept; otherwise, in this my time of suffering and life's
last moment, please return this revealing letter.''
</P>
<P>
   Written in New York or Paris, such avowals of affection may be
dismissed as adolescent passion, and stowed safely in a bottom
dresser drawer. But in the small Nepalese village 100 miles
southwest of Katmandu where these words were laboriously penned, a
love letter is much more than just a love letter: It is a hand
reaching out to grab the future, ready or not.
</P>
<P>
   The letters exchanged between young village residents, often as
a prelude to elopement, are reweaving the fabric of a centuries-old
culture, gradually changing everything from kinship bonds to the
basic definitions of love and matrimony, said Dr. Laura Ahearn, a
University of South Carolina anthropologist who for the past 17
years has been studying marriage practices in the village. ``They
are fundamentally reshaping village life,'' Dr. Ahearn said.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, the majority of marital unions in ``Junigau'' _
a fictional name used by Dr. Ahearn, who wishes to protect the
village from curious tourists _ were arranged by parents. Marriage
traditionally has been seen as the joining of two families, and the
suitability of a match has been decided largely on the basis of
complicated kinship and caste relationships: Marriage between
certain types of cousins, for example, is deemed highly desirable,
while marriage to ``the wrong type of cousin,'' is frowned upon,
Dr. Ahearn said. Becoming espoused to someone from a caste below
the Magars, who make up the bulk of village residents, is out of
the question.
</P>
<P>
   In arranged marriages, husband and wife sometimes speak for the
first time on their wedding day. It is not uncommon for a bride to
wail piteously throughout the marriage ceremony, and for the
stunned groom to perform his part of the rituals _ including
anointing the part in his bride's hair with red powder in a
symbolic deflowering _ with grim resignation.
</P>
<P>
   And the bride, who moves in with her husband's family, looks
forward to an immediate decrease in status as the newest
daughter-in-law _ a family position that by tradition lands her
with the worst chores and the heaviest labor.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, a wife also washes her husband's feet every
morning and drinks the wash water _ though some women have stopped
the practice.
</P>
<P>
   In the past 15 years, the outside world has begun to make itself
felt in this settlement of thatched-roof huts, nestled in a valley
three hours' walk from Tansen, the district center. Electric lights
came to Junigau in 1996; television sets and CD players will not be
far behind.
</P>
<P>
   And, as in other parts of Nepal, literacy, education and
exposure to media like music and film are all on the increase: Many
village young people, including women, attend college in Tansen,
and even those not in college rarely miss an opportunity to see the
Hindi romances at the cinema hall there.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, a growing number of young men are eschewing
the subsistence farming, which has traditionally supported the
village, in favor of careers with the British or Indian armies as
Gurkha soldiers, jobs that take them away from Junigau for extended
periods but also make them less financially dependent on their
families.
</P>
<P>
   The impact of such changes is inevitable, and nowhere is it felt
more keenly than in the realms of love and marriage. Between 1963
and 1983, 73 percent of all first marriages in Junigau were
arranged, with elopements accounting for only 15 percent, according
to a survey conducted by Dr. Ahearn. But between 1983 and 1993, the
number of elopements jumped to 35 percent of all first marriages
and arranged marriages dropped to 54 percent. Since 1993, nine of
10 marriages have been elopements, Dr. Ahearn said. Villages in
other parts of Nepal show similar increases in self-initiated
unions.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Since dating is still taboo in the village, and meetings between
young men and women are viewed as inappropriate, the courtship that
precedes these self-initiated unions is often carried out in love
letters. The correspondence is begun by the man, who prevails upon
a messenger _ often a younger sibling or young relative who is
sworn to secrecy _ to deliver a declaration of his undying love to
the woman he has chosen.
</P>
<P>
   Suitors put great effort into the crafting of these letters.
``It's a distinctive genre,'' said Dr. Ahearn, ``very different
from spoken Nepali and from written Nepali.'' Stores in Tansen and
Katmandu sell how-to books, although no one the anthropologist
spoke to in Junigau admitted to having used one. Tips on what to
say _ and what not to say _ are passed among friends.
</P>
<P>
   Many young men sprinkle their letters with English or Hindi
expressions, or with references to well-known figures, in an effort
to impress. ``Love is the sort of thing that anyone can feel _ even
a great man of the world like Hitler loved Eva, they say,'' asserts
one letter. ``And Napoleon, who with bravery conquered the `world,'
united it, and took it forward, was astounded when he saw one
particular widow.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the ideal of romantic love expressed in most Junigau love
letters differs substantially from the notion of romance familiar
to most Americans, Dr. Ahearn said. Not only are the letters more
serious from the start, but they view love as inextricably entwined
with economic development, progress and appearing educated and
modern. A suitor may explain to his beloved, for example, that
their love equals ``life success.''
</P>
<P>
   For a young woman, the path of romance is considerably more
tricky than for the man who courts her. If she answers a suitor's
letter, she is all but committed to marrying him, though he may be
someone she does not know or knows only slightly. If the courtship
becomes public knowledge and the woman does not marry her
correspondent, she will be disgraced, her courtship life over.
``There's a lot at stake for a young woman,'' Dr. Ahearn said.
</P>
<P>
   Both lovers are likely to make attempts to check one another
out, making furtive inquiries among acquaintances, or sending out
feelers in the letters themselves, a collection of which Dr. Ahearn
has studied. Without face-to-face contact, misunderstandings
frequently occur: ``Why did you beg forgiveness from me? What have
we done wrong?'' asks one young woman of her petitioner.
</P>
<P>
   And trustworthiness and honesty are topics that recur
repeatedly: ``Let's neither of us engage in deceitful actions,''
writes one young man. ``My true thoughts are none other than
that.''
</P>
<P>
   If the correspondence goes well, a wedding plan is agreed upon.
The couple elopes, and a brief ceremony is performed by a Brahmin
priest at the house of the groom's family _ providing his parents
accept the marriage. If the marriage goes against caste or kinship
restrictions, the bride's parents may refuse to accept the couple,
a father telling his daughter, ``Don't come crying `Daddy, Daddy'
to me if something goes wrong,'' Dr. Ahearn said. But often, the
bride's parents come to accept the union, inviting her back to
their house for a feast, and allowing her to visit when she wishes.
</P>
<P>
   Still, few members of Junigau's older generation applaud the
practice of choosing a marriage partner out of love, and many long
for the days when they had more control of their children.
Elopement, they say, shows a lack of respect, and the marriages are
often inappropriate _ playing havoc with traditional notions of
kinship and caste.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ahearn, too, said she believed that the decline in arranged
marriages would ultimately end in ``hierarchies flipped on their
head, shaking the society to its core.'' In Junigau, after all,
kinship not only determines marriage partners, but dictates who
repairs the roof and who comes to family celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is connected in this village,'' she said.

`WEREWOLVES IN THEIR YOUTH': MARRIAGE AND OTHER THINGS THAT CAN GO
WRONG 
</HEADLINE>
   (Publication notes at end of review)  
 (HLW)  
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are no happy families in ``Werewolves in Their Youth'' _
just different varieties of marital distress, filial rage, paternal
disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   In his earlier work (``The Mysteries of Pittsburgh,'' ``A Model
World''), the talented Michael Chabon has tended to focus on boys
trying to come to terms with their fathers, children trying to make
sense of their parents' fractured lives. Though there are stories
in this disappointing volume that do just that _ both the title
story and ``The Harris Fetko Story'' concern sons, sorting through
the emotional wreckage of their fathers' mistakes _ most of these
tales are about marriages in disarray.
</P>
<P>
   ``House Hunting'' concerns an angry young couple looking for a
new home for their deteriorating marriage. ``Son of the Wolfman''
depicts another disaffected couple, whose marriage unravels when
the wife is raped and decides to give birth to the rapist's baby.
And ``That Was Me'' portrays a husband and wife trying in vain to
pick up strangers in a local bar.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Chabon's characters cherish the idea of control. The
quarterback renowned for his ``serene, arctic blankness''; the
little boy trying to remake reality with his fantasy games; the
couple who diligently save all their receipts and subscribe to
Consumer Reports _ all would like to find some way to ward off
chaos and disaster, but find themselves submitting to the gathering
disorder in their lives.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Green's Book,'' a family therapist known for his kindness
and reliability not only sees his own marriage come to an end but
also finds himself reliving a long-ago night when he molested a
young girl. And in ``Mrs. Box,'' a bankrupt optometrist fleeing his
ruptured marriage and failed business visits his ex-wife's
grandmother and contemplates stealing her jewelry.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, Chabon writes with enormous fluency in these pages,
captivating the reader with his descriptive and metaphoric powers.
He's able to give us vivid snapshots in a phrase or two, showing us
a man's ``brushed-aluminum hair'' or making us hear the ``Eeyore
voice'' of an annoying boy's annoying mother. He likens a group of
Little League players sitting clumped along the bench to ``pigeons
on the arm of a statue'' and describes a football coach's cologne
as smelling like ``the tiny red cardboard pine trees that dangle
from the rearview mirrors of taxicabs.''
</P>
<P>
   When Chabon turns to more emotional matters, however, his prose
tends to grow labored, prolix and self-conscious. He describes
marriage, for instance, as ``a container for the madness between
men and women,'' ``a fragile hedge against it, as religion was to
death, and the laws of physics to the immense quantity of utter
emptiness of which the universe was made''; it was ``a doubtful
enterprise, a voyage in an untested craft, across a hostile ocean,
with a map that was a forgery and with no particular destination
but the grave.''
</P>
<P>
   A similar problem afflicts the stories as a whole. Just as many
of his characters are control freaks, so Chabon, as a writer, tends
to overmanage their fates. He is constantly pushing his narratives
into neatly packaged, O. Henryesque shapes, decking out his ironies
with neon lights, and festooning his symbols with glitter and
tinsel.
</P>
<P>
   It's not enough in ``Son of the Wolfman'' for a woman to get
pregnant with a rapist's child; Chabon has to add that the woman
and her husband were trying, in vain, to have a child for years.
It's not enough in ``Mrs. Box'' for the hero to try to steal the
jewelry of his ex-wife's grandmother; he has to be punished for
this act by having his own car stolen. It's not enough in ``House
Hunting'' for a couple to be having sexual difficulties; while
touring a house with a real estate agent, they have to find a
sexual aid that solves their particular problem.
</P>
<P>
   In ``In the Black Mill'' _ a horror story supposedly written by
August Van Zorn, a character in Chabon's last novel, ``Wonder
Boys'' _ an archeologist researching an ancient tribe of cannibals
just happens to stumble across evidence that a modern cult with
equally bloody habits has taken over a town. And in ``Spikes,'' a
man whose marriage has unraveled after the death of his baby son
skips a meeting with his wife's divorce lawyer to play father to a
neighbor's 11-year-old boy.
</P>
<P>
   The reader cannot help wondering why Chabon is trying so hard.
Indeed, these stories recall many of the weaker aspects of his
first book, ``The Mysteries of Pittsburgh'' (1988), a charming but
mannered novel that was eclipsed by the lucid and wonderfully
nuanced Nathan Shapiro stories in ``A Model World'' (1991) _
stories that demonstrated Chabon's ability to write about love and
loss with precision and wisdom, and without the sort of contrivance
that mars this latest collection.

PLAYING DOCTOR, AND CHEATING 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JOHN O'NEILL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Devices that let people measure their blood pressure at home are
inexpensive and simple. But there is a problem: A recent German
study found that about half the patients using the devices cheated
when it came to writing down the results.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, patients who are given the increasingly popular
devices are asked to record their blood pressures in logbooks their
physicians review periodically. These results can give a more
comprehensive picture of hypertension than single measurements in
an office visit can, and avoid ``white coat hypertension'' _ high
blood pressure caused by the anxiety of seeing a doctor.
</P>
<P>
   In a study published recently in the American Journal of
Hypertension, researchers at the University Clinic in Bonn came up
with a simple method of checking on the accuracy of the
self-monitoring routine: They gave 30 randomly selected patients
devices that contained a memory chip that was recording the results
as well.
</P>
<P>
   Not everybody fudged: 11 patients, in fact, wrote down their
pressure readings faithfully. The other patients generally strayed
by recording results only part of the time. ``The measurements most
prevalently left off were the high readings,'' Dr. Michael A.
Weber, an editor of the journal, said in a telephone interview.
``People would decide they had gotten a high reading because they
were nervous or upset or that it wasn't the `right time' for a
reading. So they would leave it out, or go back and repeat the test
until they got a lower reading.''
</P>
<P>
   This kind of distortion is based on a misunderstanding, said
Weber, the head of medicine at Brookdale University Hospital in
Brooklyn and president of the American Society of Hypertension.
``It's perfectly appropriate to have high blood pressure from time
to time, say after a conflict with your boss, or readings that are
falsely low, like after a large lunch,'' he said. ``The point of
the monitoring should be to present a patient's full range as well
as the average.''
</P>
<P>
   Weber said that physicians and researchers could not rely on the
head-in-the-icebox-feet-in-the-fire averages indicated by the
study. ``It's important to remind doctors that ultimately it is
their own measurements that have to guide them,'' he said.

   Given a choice, all leaders would prefer the kind of trial Mr.
Clinton has faced than the one that just removed King Hussein from
office.
</P>
<P>
   _ (Bill Tammeus, The Kansas City Star)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; QUOTABLES FROM 'WEEKEND UPDATE' ON NBC's 'SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill and Hillary are upset about a cover story on their
daughter Chelsea in the new 'People' magazine. They say they'd give
up on the press altogether if it wasn't for the good, decent people
at 'Hustler' magazine.''
</P>
<P>
   ``While on a ski trip this week, New Jersey Governor Christie
Whitman broke her leg. Wait a second: she's from New Jersey and
three days after the Super Bowl she ends up with a broken leg? Ski
trip my ass. Sounds to me like somebody went a little bit too heavy
on the Falcons.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In a rare moment of bipartisanship this week, Senate Democrats
withdrew their opposition to the Republican proposal for a tax cut.
The Senate Democrats originally complained that the cuts were only
going to help the rich, but the they remembered that they were the
rich.''
</P>
<P>
   ``According to an interview in 'Daily Variety,' Farrah Fawcett
is eager to go back to work, and is considering all offers to get
her career back on track. Well Farrah, I would like to offer you a
role in my next movie. I'm shooting it in my apartment and it's
called 'I've wanted to do this since 1975.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Celeste Wisniewski, a Monica Lewinsky look-alike, has been
standing outside Monica's hotel hoping to attract the attention
that Monica was avoiding. This is good news for society. Now
stalkers have stalkers. What I can't figure out is, who's prouder:
the father of the girl who performed oral sex on the President, or
the father of the girl who wants people to believe she's the girl
who performed oral sex on the President.''
</P>
<P>
   ``CIA Director George Tenet warned this week that Saudi
terrorist Osama bin Laden is preparing to launch another attack
against U.S. facilities. And. how about where, George?''
</P>
<P>
   ``An aide to Washington, D.C. mayor Anthony Williams was forced
to resign because he used the word 'niggardly,' which actually
means 'stingy' or 'miserly,' but sounds like a racial slur. In a
related story, NBC announced it will not longer use the words David
Spade.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Israel's National Parks Authority has authorized a private
contractor to build a submerged bridge into the Sea of Galilee that
would allow tourists to simulate Jesus' miraculous walk on water.
Yeah, I think Jesus would appreciate a data input technician on
vacation from Tom's River, mimicking one of his greatest feats:
'Hey, look, kids! Daddy is moon walking across the lake just like
our Lord and Savior did back in the 1800s.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``American warplanes attacked newly installed Iraqi anti-ship
missile launchers along the Persian Gulf. An enraged Saddam Hussein
scolded his troops saying, 'You see, this is why we can't have nice
things!'''
</P>
<P>
   ``A female chimp in the Los Angeles Zoo gave birth this week,
but of the six possible fathers in the exhibit with her, three had
vasectomies, two are too young and one is too old to have fathered
the baby. Confused scientists don't know whether the birth is the
result of a genetic miracle or the worst case of beer goggles in
history.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Last week at the Super Bowl, when Cher came out to sing the
national anthem, she was escorted onto the field by a young boy who
seemed to be terrified. He didn't know it was Cher. He thought it
was Marilyn Manson.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CITY STREETS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   It was an unusually messy day, with piles of ice, slush and
pools of water. I got to a street corner where an elderly blind
woman with a white cane waited uncertainly. I described the
situation to her and offered my arm to guide her around the most
dangerous spots. She accepted and we navigated slowly and
carefully.
</P>
<P>
   When we were less than halfway across, the traffic light
changed. Before panic could begin to set in, a long stretch
limousine moved into the intersection and simply stopped, thereby
blocking the two lanes of cars and preventing them from bearing
down on us. Not one car honked its horn!
</P>
<P>
   When we reached the safety of the far curb, I turned and waved
vigorously, trying to thank all those courteous drivers, especially
the one in the limo. The blind woman never knew what happened, but
I was very proud of New York City that day.
</P>
<P>
   _ MILDRED A. TALBOT
</P>
<P>
   I love to meditate, and do so as often as I can during the
workday _ before work, at lunchtime and in the evening. Last year I
discovered the quiet but musty solitude of St. Bartholomew's
Church. Not only was the place deserted _ there was rarely anyone
else around _ but the church actually encouraged meditation and had
a sign outside inviting people to feel free to use the space for
``quiet reflection and meditation.'' I thought this was amazing!
</P>
<P>
   As I walked in, I saw beds stretched out along the corridor, and
I thought, ``How incredible, how Zen-like!'' Not only do they
encourage meditation but they also have beds in which to do it.
``I've discovered an oasis,'' I thought.
</P>
<P>
   One lunch hour, I lay down, closed my eyes and tried to drift
off out of Manhattan. I was quickly jolted back to reality by two
very unhappy homeless men who were shaking me: ``Yo, Goldie, wake
up ... and who's been sleeping in my bed?'' They both began to
laugh as the second man added: ``Hey, Jack, make sure she didn't
eat the porridge, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The beds have since moved to a less public location, but the
church is still an oasis for meditation.

   The worst time in Manhattan is a rainy cold winter day at rush
hour in midtown trying to get home. But last week, because of a bus
driver, I felt like a tourist just enjoying the Big Apple.

<P>
   The crosstown M42 bus was packed with tired commuters. People
were growing irritated at the slow traffic and being squeezed into
inches of space. The bus driver picked up the microphone to
announce what we thought would be the next stop.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, his announcement went something like this: ``Fifth
Avenue is the next stop. Look out the window. It's the magnificent
Fifth Avenue with everything your heart desires. Go up to see the
one and only Central Park and enjoy Museum Mile with the best
museums in New York and in this world, from the Metropolitan Museum
to MOMA, from ancient Egyptian arts to contemporary paintings. Now
turn to your left and you will find the beautiful New York Public
Library. Farther down is the famous Empire State Building and the

   Given a choice, all leaders would prefer the kind of trial Mr.
Clinton has faced than the one that just removed King Hussein from
office.
</P>
<P>
   _ (Bill Tammeus, The Kansas City Star)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; QUOTABLES FROM 'WEEKEND UPDATE' ON NBC's 'SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill and Hillary are upset about a cover story on their
daughter Chelsea in the new 'People' magazine. They say they'd give
up on the press altogether if it wasn't for the good, decent people
at 'Hustler' magazine.''
</P>
<P>
   ``While on a ski trip this week, New Jersey Governor Christie
Whitman broke her leg. Wait a second: she's from New Jersey and
three days after the Super Bowl she ends up with a broken leg? Ski
trip my ass. Sounds to me like somebody went a little bit too heavy
on the Falcons.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In a rare moment of bipartisanship this week, Senate Democrats
withdrew their opposition to the Republican proposal for a tax cut.
The Senate Democrats originally complained that the cuts were only
going to help the rich, but the they remembered that they were the
rich.''
</P>
<P>
   ``According to an interview in 'Daily Variety,' Farrah Fawcett
is eager to go back to work, and is considering all offers to get
her career back on track. Well Farrah, I would like to offer you a
role in my next movie. I'm shooting it in my apartment and it's
called 'I've wanted to do this since 1975.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Celeste Wisniewski, a Monica Lewinsky look-alike, has been
standing outside Monica's hotel hoping to attract the attention
that Monica was avoiding. This is good news for society. Now
stalkers have stalkers. What I can't figure out is, who's prouder:
the father of the girl who performed oral sex on the President, or
the father of the girl who wants people to believe she's the girl
who performed oral sex on the President.''
</P>
<P>
   ``CIA Director George Tenet warned this week that Saudi
terrorist Osama bin Laden is preparing to launch another attack
against U.S. facilities. And. how about where, George?''
</P>
<P>
   ``An aide to Washington, D.C. mayor Anthony Williams was forced
to resign because he used the word 'niggardly,' which actually
means 'stingy' or 'miserly,' but sounds like a racial slur. In a
related story, NBC announced it will not longer use the words David
Spade.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Israel's National Parks Authority has authorized a private
contractor to build a submerged bridge into the Sea of Galilee that
would allow tourists to simulate Jesus' miraculous walk on water.
Yeah, I think Jesus would appreciate a data input technician on
vacation from Tom's River, mimicking one of his greatest feats:
'Hey, look, kids! Daddy is moon walking across the lake just like
our Lord and Savior did back in the 1800s.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``American warplanes attacked newly installed Iraqi anti-ship
missile launchers along the Persian Gulf. An enraged Saddam Hussein
scolded his troops saying, 'You see, this is why we can't have nice
things!'''
</P>
<P>
   ``A female chimp in the Los Angeles Zoo gave birth this week,
but of the six possible fathers in the exhibit with her, three had
vasectomies, two are too young and one is too old to have fathered
the baby. Confused scientists don't know whether the birth is the
result of a genetic miracle or the worst case of beer goggles in
history.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Last week at the Super Bowl, when Cher came out to sing the
national anthem, she was escorted onto the field by a young boy who
seemed to be terrified. He didn't know it was Cher. He thought it
was Marilyn Manson.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CITY STREETS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   It was an unusually messy day, with piles of ice, slush and
pools of water. I got to a street corner where an elderly blind
woman with a white cane waited uncertainly. I described the
situation to her and offered my arm to guide her around the most
dangerous spots. She accepted and we navigated slowly and
carefully.
</P>
<P>
   When we were less than halfway across, the traffic light
changed. Before panic could begin to set in, a long stretch
limousine moved into the intersection and simply stopped, thereby
blocking the two lanes of cars and preventing them from bearing
down on us. Not one car honked its horn!
</P>
<P>
   When we reached the safety of the far curb, I turned and waved
vigorously, trying to thank all those courteous drivers, especially
the one in the limo. The blind woman never knew what happened, but
I was very proud of New York City that day.
</P>
<P>
   _ MILDRED A. TALBOT
</P>
<P>
   I love to meditate, and do so as often as I can during the
workday _ before work, at lunchtime and in the evening. Last year I
discovered the quiet but musty solitude of St. Bartholomew's
Church. Not only was the place deserted _ there was rarely anyone
else around _ but the church actually encouraged meditation and had
a sign outside inviting people to feel free to use the space for
``quiet reflection and meditation.'' I thought this was amazing!
</P>
<P>
   As I walked in, I saw beds stretched out along the corridor, and
I thought, ``How incredible, how Zen-like!'' Not only do they
encourage meditation but they also have beds in which to do it.
``I've discovered an oasis,'' I thought.
</P>
<P>
   One lunch hour, I lay down, closed my eyes and tried to drift
off out of Manhattan. I was quickly jolted back to reality by two
very unhappy homeless men who were shaking me: ``Yo, Goldie, wake
up ... and who's been sleeping in my bed?'' They both began to
laugh as the second man added: ``Hey, Jack, make sure she didn't
eat the porridge, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The beds have since moved to a less public location, but the
church is still an oasis for meditation.

   Penny Kemp and Linda Falk had trekked out to Southern California
for the Rose Bowl. On the drive to Malibu for a pregame party, they
spotted a car with the vanity plate ``OYGRWUP.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, Linda, look! That license plate says, `Oy, Grow up,' Ms.
Kemp exclaimed.

<P>
   ``We're in California, not New York,'' Ms. Falk retorted. ``It
says, `Oh, why grow up?'''

   The worst time in Manhattan is a rainy cold winter day at rush
hour in midtown trying to get home. But last week, because of a bus
driver, I felt like a tourist just enjoying the Big Apple.
</P>
<P>
   The crosstown M42 bus was packed with tired commuters. People
were growing irritated at the slow traffic and being squeezed into
inches of space. The bus driver picked up the microphone to
announce what we thought would be the next stop.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, his announcement went something like this: ``Fifth
Avenue is the next stop. Look out the window. It's the magnificent
Fifth Avenue with everything your heart desires. Go up to see the
one and only Central Park and enjoy Museum Mile with the best
museums in New York and in this world, from the Metropolitan Museum
to MOMA, from ancient Egyptian arts to contemporary paintings. Now
turn to your left and you will find the beautiful New York Public
Library. Farther down is the famous Empire State Building and the
World Trade Center. Now you are here _ Fifth Avenue, Fifth Avenue,
everyone who wants to get off, please use the rear door.''

   Michael Antonoff was standing inside the door of a pizzeria in
the theater district, awaiting the arrival of his lunch date. A
deliveryman walked in, carrying two bags of Chinese food. The
maitre d'hotel shook her head, suggested that the food must be for
the office upstairs and pointed to the next door.
</P>
<P>
   After the deliveryman insisted that he had the right address,
the maitre d' checked with the kitchen. A minute later, the cook
emerged, took possession of the food and disappeared back into the
kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   Antonoff couldn't help but exclaim, ``It's a bad omen.''

 &HT;    ENLISTMENTS SAGGING, AIR FORCE PLANS FIRST TV RECRUITING ADS
 &HT;    By SCOTT MONTGOMERY and TIMOTHY R. GAFFNEY
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For the first time in its history, the Air Force
will buy television time to run recruiting ads in hopes of
reversing enlistment declines caused by an enticing job market and
the increasingly hectic military life, officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning with NCAA basketball games at the end of this month,
the Air Force Recruiting Service will pour $17 million into
big-market TV buys using ads that previously ran on donated time as
off-hour public service announcements.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the Air Force is in the early phase of
developing a brand-new ad campaign that will open with the fall
television schedule with another $37 million to spend.
</P>
<P>
   The sudden change in philosophy, and the influx of cash to
advertising accounts, follows poor recruiting performance in the
first months of this fiscal year. Starting in October, when the
federal budget for 1999 began, the Air Force has failed to meet
enlistment goals in three of the past four months, raising the
specter that the service could miss year-end goals for the first
time since 1979.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel our competition is with local corporations and
colleges,'' said Tech Sgt. Jeff Bowser, who runs the Air Force
recruiting office in Dayton, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is twofold: the robust economy has given potential
recruits lots of alternatives to military service, and those who
opt to serve find the work pace difficult to take because the armed
forces have been shrinking at the same time that worldwide
peacekeeping missions have increased.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, the quality of life for military service members has
been highlighted in Washington as all branches of the military have
seen enlistment and re-enlistment figures sag. President Clinton
proposed a 4.4 percent pay raise for all military personnel in his
2000 budget, and last October the Air Force set up an enlistment
bonus program offering up to $9,000 for prize recruits.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's announcement follows years of holding steady on the Air
Force advertising budget, which hasn't been raised to accommodate
higher media costs since 1990. The $17 million and $37 million
allotments for broadcast time will be spent in addition to the Air
Force's regular $16 million advertising budget, which already was
boosted by $6 million this year. The extra money was made available
by the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   One reason why the Air Force is struggling with recruiting is
because many people only enlist to learn skills such as computer
programming, then leave after four years.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of folks do use the Air Force as a stepping stone,''
Bowser said.

   Given a choice, all leaders would prefer the kind of trial Mr.
Clinton has faced than the one that just removed King Hussein from
office.

   _ (Bill Tammeus, The Kansas City Star)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; QUOTABLES FROM 'WEEKEND UPDATE' ON NBC's 'SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill and Hillary are upset about a cover story on their
daughter Chelsea in the new 'People' magazine. They say they'd give
up on the press altogether if it wasn't for the good, decent people
at 'Hustler' magazine.''
</P>
<P>
   ``While on a ski trip this week, New Jersey Governor Christie
Whitman broke her leg. Wait a second: she's from New Jersey and
three days after the Super Bowl she ends up with a broken leg? Ski
trip my ass. Sounds to me like somebody went a little bit too heavy
on the Falcons.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In a rare moment of bipartisanship this week, Senate Democrats
withdrew their opposition to the Republican proposal for a tax cut.
The Senate Democrats originally complained that the cuts were only
going to help the rich, but the they remembered that they were the
rich.''
</P>
<P>
   ``According to an interview in 'Daily Variety,' Farrah Fawcett
is eager to go back to work, and is considering all offers to get
her career back on track. Well Farrah, I would like to offer you a
role in my next movie. I'm shooting it in my apartment and it's
called 'I've wanted to do this since 1975.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Celeste Wisniewski, a Monica Lewinsky look-alike, has been
standing outside Monica's hotel hoping to attract the attention
that Monica was avoiding. This is good news for society. Now
stalkers have stalkers. What I can't figure out is, who's prouder:
the father of the girl who performed oral sex on the President, or
the father of the girl who wants people to believe she's the girl
who performed oral sex on the President.''
</P>
<P>
   ``CIA Director George Tenet warned this week that Saudi
terrorist Osama bin Laden is preparing to launch another attack
against U.S. facilities. And. how about where, George?''
</P>
<P>
   ``An aide to Washington, D.C. mayor Anthony Williams was forced
to resign because he used the word 'niggardly,' which actually
means 'stingy' or 'miserly,' but sounds like a racial slur. In a
related story, NBC announced it will not longer use the words David
Spade.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Israel's National Parks Authority has authorized a private
contractor to build a submerged bridge into the Sea of Galilee that
would allow tourists to simulate Jesus' miraculous walk on water.
Yeah, I think Jesus would appreciate a data input technician on
vacation from Tom's River, mimicking one of his greatest feats:
'Hey, look, kids! Daddy is moon walking across the lake just like
our Lord and Savior did back in the 1800s.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``American warplanes attacked newly installed Iraqi anti-ship
missile launchers along the Persian Gulf. An enraged Saddam Hussein
scolded his troops saying, 'You see, this is why we can't have nice
things!'''
</P>
<P>
   ``A female chimp in the Los Angeles Zoo gave birth this week,
but of the six possible fathers in the exhibit with her, three had
vasectomies, two are too young and one is too old to have fathered
the baby. Confused scientists don't know whether the birth is the
result of a genetic miracle or the worst case of beer goggles in
history.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Last week at the Super Bowl, when Cher came out to sing the
national anthem, she was escorted onto the field by a young boy who
seemed to be terrified. He didn't know it was Cher. He thought it
was Marilyn Manson.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CITY STREETS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   It was an unusually messy day, with piles of ice, slush and
pools of water. I got to a street corner where an elderly blind
woman with a white cane waited uncertainly. I described the
situation to her and offered my arm to guide her around the most
dangerous spots. She accepted and we navigated slowly and
carefully.
</P>
<P>
   When we were less than halfway across, the traffic light
changed. Before panic could begin to set in, a long stretch
limousine moved into the intersection and simply stopped, thereby
blocking the two lanes of cars and preventing them from bearing
down on us. Not one car honked its horn!
</P>
<P>
   When we reached the safety of the far curb, I turned and waved
vigorously, trying to thank all those courteous drivers, especially
the one in the limo. The blind woman never knew what happened, but
I was very proud of New York City that day.
</P>
<P>
   _ MILDRED A. TALBOT
</P>
<P>
   I love to meditate, and do so as often as I can during the
workday _ before work, at lunchtime and in the evening. Last year I
discovered the quiet but musty solitude of St. Bartholomew's
Church. Not only was the place deserted _ there was rarely anyone
else around _ but the church actually encouraged meditation and had
a sign outside inviting people to feel free to use the space for
``quiet reflection and meditation.'' I thought this was amazing!
</P>
<P>
   As I walked in, I saw beds stretched out along the corridor, and
I thought, ``How incredible, how Zen-like!'' Not only do they
encourage meditation but they also have beds in which to do it.
``I've discovered an oasis,'' I thought.
</P>
<P>
   One lunch hour, I lay down, closed my eyes and tried to drift
off out of Manhattan. I was quickly jolted back to reality by two
very unhappy homeless men who were shaking me: ``Yo, Goldie, wake
up ... and who's been sleeping in my bed?'' They both began to
laugh as the second man added: ``Hey, Jack, make sure she didn't
eat the porridge, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The beds have since moved to a less public location, but the
church is still an oasis for meditation.

   Penny Kemp and Linda Falk had trekked out to Southern California
for the Rose Bowl. On the drive to Malibu for a pregame party, they
spotted a car with the vanity plate ``OYGRWUP.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, Linda, look! That license plate says, `Oy, Grow up,' Ms.
Kemp exclaimed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in California, not New York,'' Ms. Falk retorted. ``It
says, `Oh, why grow up?'''

<P>
   The worst time in Manhattan is a rainy cold winter day at rush
hour in midtown trying to get home. But last week, because of a bus
driver, I felt like a tourist just enjoying the Big Apple.
</P>
<P>
   The crosstown M42 bus was packed with tired commuters. People
were growing irritated at the slow traffic and being squeezed into
inches of space. The bus driver picked up the microphone to
announce what we thought would be the next stop.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, his announcement went something like this: ``Fifth
Avenue is the next stop. Look out the window. It's the magnificent
Fifth Avenue with everything your heart desires. Go up to see the
one and only Central Park and enjoy Museum Mile with the best
museums in New York and in this world, from the Metropolitan Museum
to MOMA, from ancient Egyptian arts to contemporary paintings. Now
turn to your left and you will find the beautiful New York Public
Library. Farther down is the famous Empire State Building and the
World Trade Center. Now you are here _ Fifth Avenue, Fifth Avenue,
everyone who wants to get off, please use the rear door.''
</P>
<P>
   Thank you, sir.

   Michael Antonoff was standing inside the door of a pizzeria in
the theater district, awaiting the arrival of his lunch date. A
deliveryman walked in, carrying two bags of Chinese food. The
maitre d'hotel shook her head, suggested that the food must be for
the office upstairs and pointed to the next door.
</P>
<P>
   After the deliveryman insisted that he had the right address,
the maitre d' checked with the kitchen. A minute later, the cook
emerged, took possession of the food and disappeared back into the
kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   Antonoff couldn't help but exclaim, ``It's a bad omen.''

 A JOB WITH NEW MEANING: UPDATING THE DICTIONARY
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CECELIA GOODNOW  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As a snapshot of our times, a word can be worth a thousand
pictures _ especially if you're in the dictionary biz.
</P>
<P>
   Just think of the difference between, say, ``flower power'' and
``power suit.''
</P>
<P>
   Jump ahead to the '90s, a time so filled with ambivalence that
we have both ``casual Fridays'' and the non-stop work ethic implied
by the expression ``24/7.''
</P>
<P>
   These new twists of phrase haven't escaped the notice of
lexicographers. At this very moment, an army of word sleuths is
scouring pop lyrics, movies, trade journals, billboards and even
grocery coupons for new words and usages.
</P>
<P>
   A mere handful will end up in the Oxford dictionaries,
considered by some to be the last word on language.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you're doing in a dictionary is trying _ at one given
time _ to take a picture (of the language),'' says Frank Abate,
editor-in-chief of U.S. Dictionaries, Oxford University Press.
</P>
<P>
   Oxford has been studying the spread of global English for 50
years and claims to have the world's most ambitious language
research program.
</P>
<P>
   Its army of paid and volunteer readers throughout the
English-speaking world collects an average of 18,000 new words and
meanings every month. These go into an electronic database that
provides the raw material for dictionary revisions.
</P>
<P>
   Only a small fraction of new words make the cut. Abate,
(pronounced Uh-BOT-ay) said the decision is based on the word's
history, how frequently it pops up in conversation or writing and
how much staying power it has.
</P>
<P>
   The size of the dictionary is another factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the words on the list are amusing, but they won't make
it into smaller dictionaries,'' said Abate, speaking from his
office in Old Saybrook, Conn. ``There is a bit of the
lexicographer's intuition involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Recent Americanisms that Oxford is tracking include ``24/7,''
``duh!'', ``plus size,'' ``slamming'' (the illicit switching of
someone's long-distance phone service), ``laser pointer'' and
``mouthfeel'' (used to describe the texture of food in the mouth).
</P>
<P>
   Oxford is still reserving judgment about some coinages that have
been around a lot longer. They include ``class act,'' ``designated
driver,'' ``fat city,'' ``hissy fit,'' ``nowheresville,
``time-out'' (a discipline approach for young children) and ``worst
nightmare,'' (a threat that typically begins, ``I am your ... etc.,
etc.'')
</P>
<P>
   E-mail not only speeds the spread of new words, it also helps
lexicographers stay abreast of global trends.
</P>
<P>
   As Abate said, ``We can contact colleagues all over the world
and say, `Do you guys use this word or not?'''
</P>
<P>
   Oxford has begun publishing separate editions of its dictionary
to reflect regional idioms such as ``Asianization,'' a new buzz
word in Australia; and ``blackwater rafting,'' a New Zealand term
for riding the rapids of dark, underground waterways.
</P>
<P>
   As with so many trends, however, fashionable words more often
spread from the United States to the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Abate said pop culture and electronic technology spawn a huge
amount of inventive language. There's been a virtual explosion of
words that begin with the letter ``e'' or the prefix ``cyber.''
</P>
<P>
   Medical technology and health care are bigger issues in the
United States than in Britain, he said, and ``it's reflected in our
dictionaries.'' He cites ``eldercare'' as a typical Americanism.
</P>
<P>
   In the high-tech arena, he notes that the word ``computer'' has
become universal except for France, where the language purists of
the Academie Francaise insist on calling it an ``ordinateur.''
</P>
<P>
   Compared to carefully guarded French, he said, ``English just
does its thing and comes out however it comes out.''
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't flinch at the results, even when he encounters a
linguistic car wreck like ``irregardless.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people roll over and retch when they hear it,'' Abate
said. ``What we've done in our dictionary is say, OK, there's a
word, `irregardless.' It's in the i's. But we also give advice. We
recommend people avoid the word.''
</P>
<P>
   Abate said the same guideline applies to offensive words such as
ethnic slurs. If the terms are widely used, they're listed, along
with an admonition that the words are considered derogatory.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel that we're reporters of the language and how the
language is being used,'' Abate said. ``But we don't try to
legislate. We don't really feel it's ours to take a moral
position.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the biggest change in modern word coinage is the
influence of movies, TV, commercials and other forms of popular
culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm 47,'' Abate said. ``When I was a kid, rock music was
considered, by my parents, some kind of side thing that kids did.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now it's mainstream. So it's much easier for pop terms to come
into the language. It's more democratic now, I guess.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's a sample of some of the new words and usages that turned
up in Oxford's global sieve in 1998. While only a handful will
become dictionary entries, they offer a fascinating glimpse of
society in the past year.

Australian ``One Nation'' party, opposed to immigration and the
``Asianization'' of Australia.
</P>
<P>

to the illegal stockpiling of staple foodstuffs, made scarce in
1998 by failed harvests in India.
</P>
<P>
   irritainment: Highly irritating but nonetheless compulsive
viewing.
</P>
<P>

up on the press altogether if it wasn't for the good, decent people
at 'Hustler' magazine.''

   ``While on a ski trip this week, New Jersey Governor Christie
Whitman broke her leg. Wait a second: she's from New Jersey and
three days after the Super Bowl she ends up with a broken leg? Ski
trip my ass. Sounds to me like somebody went a little bit too heavy
on the Falcons.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In a rare moment of bipartisanship this week, Senate Democrats
withdrew their opposition to the Republican proposal for a tax cut.
The Senate Democrats originally complained that the cuts were only
going to help the rich, but the they remembered that they were the
rich.''

<P>
   ``According to an interview in 'Daily Variety,' Farrah Fawcett
is eager to go back to work, and is considering all offers to get
her career back on track. Well Farrah, I would like to offer you a
role in my next movie. I'm shooting it in my apartment and it's
called 'I've wanted to do this since 1975.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Celeste Wisniewski, a Monica Lewinsky look-alike, has been
standing outside Monica's hotel hoping to attract the attention
that Monica was avoiding. This is good news for society. Now
stalkers have stalkers. What I can't figure out is, who's prouder:
the father of the girl who performed oral sex on the President, or
the father of the girl who wants people to believe she's the girl
who performed oral sex on the President.''
</P>
<P>
   ``CIA Director George Tenet warned this week that Saudi
terrorist Osama bin Laden is preparing to launch another attack
against U.S. facilities. And. how about where, George?''
</P>
<P>
   ``An aide to Washington, D.C. mayor Anthony Williams was forced
to resign because he used the word 'niggardly,' which actually
means 'stingy' or 'miserly,' but sounds like a racial slur. In a

Spade.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Israel's National Parks Authority has authorized a private
contractor to build a submerged bridge into the Sea of Galilee that
would allow tourists to simulate Jesus' miraculous walk on water.
Yeah, I think Jesus would appreciate a data input technician on
vacation from Tom's River, mimicking one of his greatest feats:
'Hey, look, kids! Daddy is moon walking across the lake just like
our Lord and Savior did back in the 1800s.'''

result of a genetic miracle or the worst case of beer goggles in
history.''

<P>
   ``Last week at the Super Bowl, when Cher came out to sing the
national anthem, she was escorted onto the field by a young boy who
seemed to be terrified. He didn't know it was Cher. He thought it
was Marilyn Manson.''

<P>
   &UR; CITY STREETS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   It was an unusually messy day, with piles of ice, slush and
pools of water. I got to a street corner where an elderly blind
woman with a white cane waited uncertainly. I described the
situation to her and offered my arm to guide her around the most
dangerous spots. She accepted and we navigated slowly and
carefully.
</P>
<P>
   When we were less than halfway across, the traffic light
changed. Before panic could begin to set in, a long stretch
limousine moved into the intersection and simply stopped, thereby
blocking the two lanes of cars and preventing them from bearing
down on us. Not one car honked its horn!
</P>
<P>
   When we reached the safety of the far curb, I turned and waved
vigorously, trying to thank all those courteous drivers, especially
the one in the limo. The blind woman never knew what happened, but
I was very proud of New York City that day.
</P>
<P>
   _ MILDRED A. TALBOT
</P>
<P>
   I love to meditate, and do so as often as I can during the
workday _ before work, at lunchtime and in the evening. Last year I
discovered the quiet but musty solitude of St. Bartholomew's
Church. Not only was the place deserted _ there was rarely anyone
else around _ but the church actually encouraged meditation and had
a sign outside inviting people to feel free to use the space for
``quiet reflection and meditation.'' I thought this was amazing!
</P>
<P>
   As I walked in, I saw beds stretched out along the corridor, and
I thought, ``How incredible, how Zen-like!'' Not only do they
encourage meditation but they also have beds in which to do it.
``I've discovered an oasis,'' I thought.
</P>
<P>
   One lunch hour, I lay down, closed my eyes and tried to drift
off out of Manhattan. I was quickly jolted back to reality by two
very unhappy homeless men who were shaking me: ``Yo, Goldie, wake
up ... and who's been sleeping in my bed?'' They both began to
laugh as the second man added: ``Hey, Jack, make sure she didn't
eat the porridge, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The beds have since moved to a less public location, but the
church is still an oasis for meditation.

 &HT;    Girl hurt while playing on city park slide; methane gas may have
caused injury
 &HT;    By Carlos Campos
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A southeast Atlanta playground remains closed while
city officials try to find out how 8-year-old Delores Norman was
burned on her arms and hands in what appears to be a freak accident
involving methane gas.
</P>
<P>
   Delores and other children playing at D.L. Stanton Park in the
Peoplestown community Jan. 18 said they heard a loud bang and then
a hissing sound, like escaping steam, come from the ground near the
plastic slide.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sliding board just popped up,'' said Delores at her home
within walking distance of the park. The pig-tailed second-grader
was treated at Hughes Spalding Children's Hospital for second and
third-degree burns on her left forearm and right hand, said her
mother, Michelle Norman. Norman doesn't expect Delores' injuries to
leave permanent damage. Another 8-year-old girl was also slightly
injured.
</P>
<P>
   Norman said she's frustrated because she doesn't know how her
daughter was burned, and claims the city has been short on answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I looked at her arms I wondered how could this happen on
a sliding board,'' said Michelle Norman. ``They're not telling me
everything. I want to know what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Gary, acting commissioner of parks, said it's possible
methane gas _ generated by decomposing organic matter such as
discarded food _ was trapped between the top and bottom levels of
the one-piece, plastic spiral slide. Gary said a testing company
has confirmed dangerous levels of methane gas underground at the
playground.
</P>
<P>
   Gary said city records don't show there was ever a landfill on
the site, but he and community residents say the area may have been
used as an illegal dumping ground many years ago. Gary said static
electricity produced by the friction of children on the slide may
have created the spark necessary for an explosion.
</P>
<P>
   The state Environmental Protection Division will review the
city's report on the matter, and help if needed, said Christy
Easter, a geologist in the solid waste management division.
</P>
<P>
   Easter said it is uncommon, but not impossible, for an explosion
of methane gas to occur outdoors, because the gas is easily
dispersed. She said it's possible the slide could have provided a
place for the methane to build up to explosive levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would have to have some way to concentrate that gas,''
Easter said. ``And I just don't know how that happened with those
little girls. It's something I've never heard of in this scenario,
but strange things happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Community activist Columbus Ward said he's trying to organize an
informational meeting on the matter this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obviously one of the most unusual events that has
happened that I'm aware of,'' said Councilwoman Debi Starnes, who
represents the area. ``And we're doing everything we can to
investigate what caused it.''
</P>
<P>
   The playground is closed off by plastic webbing, and tape that
reads ``Hazardous Area Keep Out.''

 &HT;    Cash-poor hopefuls take on well-heeled Isakson
 &HT;    By Steve Visser
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If TV ads mark the start of a political campaign, the
race for the 6th District congressional seat has officially
started.
</P>
<P>
   But the only one on the air is Johnny Isakson.
</P>
<P>
   That's just one example of how the campaign to replace Newt
Gingrich in Washington has become a two-week sprint that pits one
``have'' against seven ``have-nots.''
</P>
<P>
   Isakson, chairman of the state school board who has financed two
previous statewide races, claims a war chest of about $1.5 million.
He expects to spend at least $470,000 on television, cable, radio
and direct mail ads for the special election Feb. 23.
</P>
<P>
   Of the other seven candidates who hope to drag him into a March
runoff, only one has raised a tenth as much as Isakson _ Christina
Jeffrey, a 51-year-old Kennesaw State University professor.
</P>
<P>
   Some are spending nothing except the $4,100 qualifying fee.
Others are digging into their life savings and investments _
deeply, considering the odds stacked against them. ``It's hard to
sell your wife on spending $10,000 that you need,'' said Marco
Longo, a 27-year-old salesman who has never before run for office.
``We needed that 10 grand. But we're young.''
</P>
<P>
   When they get their messages out, the conversation is likely to
dwell on close-to-home issues _ nothing like the futuristic visions
Gingrich used to thrill voters. Most candidates, including Isakson,
are talking taxes, the federal surplus, Social Security, and
education.
</P>
<P>
   But while this is a nonpartisan race, the 6th District remains
heavily Republican. And several candidates will be testing whether
abortion, an issue that has proved fatal to Isakson in the past,
still has the power to determine the outcome in what is likely to
be a low-turnout contest.
</P>
<P>
   For cash-poor candidates, the effort to get a message out
cheaply and quickly has resulted in several innovations, including
reliance on the Internet. At least four of the eight candidates
have put up Web sites, and others are hoping the cheap, strategic
use of cable TV, direct mail or yard signs will provide the magic
bullet.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal is to get into a runoff with Johnny,'' said Leigh
Baier, a 57-year-old attorney. ``I plan to get there with 50 cents
a vote and I figure Johnny is going to get there at $100 a vote.''
He's personally set aside $50,000 for the race.
</P>
<P>
   But breaking into the public consciousness will be hard. Even
``free media,'' what some people might call news, will be scarce.
The 6th District candidates are competing for attention with a new
governor trying to put a forceful, early mark on his
administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things we think we know is that voters aren't
likely to vote for candidates that they don't know anything
about,'' said Charles Bullock, a political scientist at the
University of Georgia. ``Most of the people haven't done anything
that gives them name recognition.''
</P>
<P>
   At least three forums featuring all candidates are scheduled
between now and Election Day. One of them, sponsored by the Atlanta
Press Club, will be televised Feb. 21.
</P>
<P>
   Of seven candidates on the ballot and one write-in, Isakson is
by far the best known. The 54-year-old president of Northside
Realty ran for the U.S. Senate in 1996 and for governor in 1990. He
served 17 years in the Legislature representing Georgia's Cobb
County, which provides half the voters of the 6th District.
</P>
<P>
   Isakson's television ads take the homey, soft-sell approach of
depicting him as a pro-business supporter of eduction who also
favors a 10-percent tax cut. He doesn't back away from his past
support for a woman's right to an abortion, but now emphasizes his
opposition to partial birth abortions and his support for parental
notification and informed consent requirements.
</P>
<P>
   By budgeting only a third of his treasury for advertising,
Isakson will have a reserve to respond to any attack ads.
``Obviously we have a large cushion there,'' said Heath Garrett,
campaign manager for Isakson. ``If Christina Jeffrey goes negative,
we can respond.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey, too, is a name many Republicans recognize. She was
named House historian by Newt Gingrich in one of his first acts as
House Speaker, and was quickly fired by him, too, over a
misinterpretation of some comments she made about the Holocaust.
Her campaign says she's raised $200,000, some of it through the
Internet via e-mail appeals to pro-gun groups. Alan Keyes, the
former U.N. ambassador and conservative commentator, will appear at
a fund-raiser for her Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign manager Tom Campbell expects to start TV ads this week,
but the campaign may save its biggest punch for the final days.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is plenty of time to get our message out,'' Campbell
said. ``I think typically a lot of people make up their mind late
even in a normal election.'' And she does plan to attack, on
abortion and on Isakson's leadership role in the Cobb County
campaign for a sales tax to build schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``Christina is unashamedly pro-life and it's going to be an
important issue. . .We have to say that Johnny Isakson is
campaigning as a Reagan Republican, when his record is of a
tax-and-spend liberal.''
</P>
<P>
   Barry Doublestein, the 44-year-old GOP chairman for the 11th
District, is emphasizing his anti-abortion stance in his fliers and
on his Web site. He brings to the race a core of Gwinnett County,
Ga. voters.
</P>
<P>
   Gary ``Bats'' Pelphrey, the only declared Democrat in the race,
also may linger in the minds of voters. He ran against Gingrich in
November, getting 29 percent of the vote. His advertising budget is
nearly zero, except for some campaign stickers. But he has the most
sophisticated Web site of any candidate _ and is the only one whose
site includes Internet links to the other candidates, so that
voters can comparison shop.
</P>
<P>
   Pelphrey is trying to circumvent his cash disadvantage by
encouraging forums and town meetings. He rented a theater on Monday
night for a town meeting under the Gingrich-like theme, ``The
Challenges of Maturing America.''
</P>
<P>
   The other two candidates are Andrew Naples, a 46-year-old
electrical engineer and businessman, who said he has budgeted about
$70,000 in personal money for the race, and write-in candidate
Kelly Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the 6th District candidates, particularly those with no
campaign experience, are trying to figure out where to spend their
scarce _ and often hard-earned _ dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The Web sites offer the cheapest way of advertising the
candidate's views to the public _ but they reach a limited
audience. Candidates can't target their message to likely voters
or, more importantly, use it to push likely supporters to go to the
polls. Bullock noted that candidates still had to advertise their
Web sites to the public to make them semi-helpful.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't reach the vast hundred of thousands of people who
live in that district by word of mouth,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Perdue is a longtime Georgia political consultant who
specializes in the campaigns of conservative candidates. His
advice? Those trying to defeat Isakson would be best served by a
direct-mail campaign. Cable television and radio are the next-best
mediums for reaching the anti-Isakson voters, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``For my money, direct mail is the most potent use of your
resources,'' he said. ``A small, dedicated base can swing that
election. And you don't get to that dedicated base by television
that goes all over. You go directly into their homes.''

   The crosstown M42 bus was packed with tired commuters. People
were growing irritated at the slow traffic and being squeezed into
inches of space. The bus driver picked up the microphone to
announce what we thought would be the next stop.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, his announcement went something like this: ``Fifth
Avenue is the next stop. Look out the window. It's the magnificent
Fifth Avenue with everything your heart desires. Go up to see the
one and only Central Park and enjoy Museum Mile with the best
museums in New York and in this world, from the Metropolitan Museum
to MOMA, from ancient Egyptian arts to contemporary paintings. Now
turn to your left and you will find the beautiful New York Public
Library. Farther down is the famous Empire State Building and the

HITTING HOME BASE FROM A FISHING BOAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TOM STIENSTRA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Dusty Baker reared back with his fishing rod,
then sailed a long, seamless cast into the murky flows of the San
Francisco Bay. It was a dark, rainy day, and few others were out on
the water, figuring there was no hope. But Dusty smiled at what
that cast might bring.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was 23 on the Braves, Luke Appling took me aside and
told me, `To be lucky, you've got to think lucky,''' he said.
``That goes for anything. If you don't think lucky in fishing, you
don't catch any fish. Am I lucky? It's true, I'm lucky. If you
think you're lucky, that's what you get.''
</P>
<P>
   He was in a state of relaxed focus on the boat, poising his
fishing rod in his hands, ready to set the hook on a rare bite from
a sturgeon the same way he once awaited a rare fastball in the
batter's box. Baker not only believes in himself, you quickly
discover, but he's a believer in the hope that every day can bring.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as I can remember, the outdoors is where everything
has started for me,'' Baker said. ``My dad is 74 years old, and I
love him, and I really love him for turning me on to fishing when I
was a kid. We fished almost every weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   For quite a while, Dusty and I have been talking about putting a
fishing trip together, and every time the subject comes up, the
conversation always turns to sturgeon _ the often elusive prize
fish that can grow to hundreds of pounds, capable of 200-yard power
runs and pirouetting, whale-like jumps. So we hooked up at Loch
Lomond Harbor in San Rafael, aboard the custom charter boat
Imagine, then headed south, under the Richmond Bridge, anchoring in
20 feet of water.
</P>
<P>
   And there the fun started. As he settled in, waiting for his
bite, he explained on one recent trip he contracted a new ailment
called ``fishing elbow.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I went up on the Columbia River, and got together with Trevor
Wilson and Tom Lampkin, who live up there,'' Baker said, referring
to players now with the San Francisco Giants and the Seattle
Mariners, respectively. ``We fished 4 1/2 hours and caught (and
released) 28 sturgeon. Next morning I was so sore, and it hit me, I
had `fishing elbow' for the first time in my entire life.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he grinned, and you don't know if he's putting you on or
not. But that's fishing. And that's Dusty.
</P>
<P>
   You discover there are two sides to him, and they aren't even
friends. On one side is this tough-love guy with an all-consuming
drive to build the Giants into a perennial big winner, a guy who
takes no guff from anyone, including Barry Bonds, and whose concept
of presence is to lead, follow or get the hell out of his way. On
the other side, though, is this relaxed, playful character who
fishes to blow off steam and to have fun, often sharing his
adventures with players.
</P>
<P>
   Put the two together and you have a man with a straight-ahead
approach, a man with both smarts and a sense of magic about him.
The qualities have made the Giants manager one of the most popular
leaders in San Francisco Bay sports history among both fans and
players.
</P>
<P>
   Many Giants, past and present, often join him on fishing trips.
The best known are Mike Jackson, Darren Lewis, Robby Thompson, Kirt
Manwaring, Matt Williams, Steve Reed and batting coach Gene Clines,
heading out with one of Baker's best friends, Armand Castagna, a
professional skipper who owns and operates the Imagine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Armand's looking forward to the new stadium where he can come
and pick me up at the dock right at the park,'' Baker said with a
smile. ``Especially with a 12:30 game, you could be out of there by
4 or 4:30, hopefully with a victory, then fish four or five hours
until dark. I mean, that is awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   Castagna grinned. ``We already got it planned.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going for the grand slam of fishing in the Bay,
sturgeon, halibut, striped bass and salmon,'' Baker added. ``We get
three of them, but we always seem to miss one.''
</P>
<P>
   The outdoors teaches how hope can be rewarded, and Baker learned
his most memorable lesson on a late summer evening off the Marin
coast, on a trip with Castagna, Lewis, Manwaring and Galen Onizuka,
a longtime fieldscout.
</P>
<P>
   As Castagna tells it, Baker hooked a big salmon at 6:45 p.m. off
Stinson Beach, and battled that fish past sunset and into darkness.
Over and over, the fish surged off on runs and power drives in a
fight that spanned 2 1/2 miles of water, all the way to Muir Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``At dusk, Bake had it close enough to the boat to see its tail,
and it was like 12 inches across, a 50-pounder for sure,'' Castagna
said.
</P>
<P>
   At 8:30 p.m., as darkness was taking over, the big salmon
suddenly powered off on a big run straight into the surf, made it
to some rocks, and was able to break the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole thing was unbelievable,'' Dusty remembered.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, `The Old Man and the Sea' was one of my favorite
books, because I didn't know whether I was pulling for the old man
or the fish,'' he said, referring to the book by Ernest Hemingway.
``That day that fish got me, took me in the rocks, and he won. You
want to win all the time, but you have to tip your hat to the
opposition. I didn't lose. He beat me. There's a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   He smiled, baited his hook, then cast out again, ready for
whatever the day might bring.

 &HT;    Southern Co. plans to invest thwarted
 &HT;    By Matthew C. Quinn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Plans by Southern Co. to invest in a state-owned
Chinese power company were set back Monday when Shandong
International Power Development Co. withdrew an overseas stock
sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are disappointed that we are not able to make a strategic
investment in the company at this time,'' said Southern spokesman
Chuck Griffin. ``We hope the market will rebound quickly and give
Shandong an opportunity to complete the offering.''
</P>
<P>
   Shandong, uneasy about the Chinese economy, said it shelved
plans for an initial public offering on the Hong Kong Stock
Exchange ``after considering the recent highly volatile market
conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co., had been handling the sale of 25 percent
of the regional power entity to raise $285 million. Southern was
expected to buy 40 percent of the shares being sold for $114
million. That would have given the Atlanta-based company a 9.9
percent stake in Shandong.
</P>
<P>
   Shandong became third major Chinese firm in one month to cancel
a stock offering amid growing concerns by foreign investors about
the Chinese economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The withdrawal reflects investors' caution toward emerging
markets worldwide,'' said Peter Rose, a Goldman Sachs spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Shandong International owns 13 electric power plants in Shandong
province, which is 300 miles north of Shanghai on the Yellow Sea
coast. It plans to build more.
</P>
<P>
   Griffin said Southern will continue to look for opportunities to
expand its Chinese holdings. Southern operates one power plant in
Guangdong Province and is part of a joint venture that plans to
build another unit in Shanxi Province.

ANTARCTICA ISN'T ORLANDO, BUT CROWDS ARE A WORRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Feb. 14)  
(mk) 
 By EDWIN McDOWELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite Antarctica's ice, snow, isolation, high winds and raging
seas (and for hardy types, precisely for these reasons), the
continent will be visited by an estimated 11,200 people this
tourist season, all but about 130 of them on cruise ships.
</P>
<P>
   While that total is only about 400 more than the number of
visitors last season (mid-November through February), it is 70
percent higher than the 6,585 visitors during the 1992-93 season.
Some Antarctica watchers, including Neil Plimmer, a past president
of the Pacific Asia Travel Association, are concerned about its
environment have warned there could be 14,000 annual Antarctic
visitors by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of Antarctic cruises can easily reach $20,000 a person,
and the average 14-day cruise is a still-hefty $6,000 to $7,000,
plus round-trip air fare to Ushuaia, Argentina, in Tierra del
Fuego, from which 90 percent of the trips depart. But while
Antarctica appears insulated from tourist hordes because of cost
and its formidable geography and climate, some environmentalists
contend that it may already have reached its capacity to absorb
tourists without suffering lasting ecological damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``People should have an opportunity to see Antarctica's beauty,
but there should be a cap on the number of visitors and a ban on
any new sites,'' said Beth Clark, director of the Antarctic
Project, the Washington-based secretariat for more than 200
conservation organizations in more than 40 countries. ``It's true
that once people visit Antarctica they come back committed to its
conservation, but the downside is that there are so many visitors
and Antarctica is so fragile that there's a danger they're loving
it to death.''
</P>
<P>
   A major concern of Ms. Clark, who favors a limit of 6,000
visitors a year, is that most tourists visit the same few places on
the 800-mile-long Antarctic Peninsula, which has the continent's
biggest concentration of penguins, seals and birds. Though tour
groups setting foot on land rarely exceed 100 visitors at a time,
``The animals don't get much rest between visits and don't have
much time to get food for themselves or their young,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Science doesn't yet know whether this will have long-term
impact,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Among the concerns are that tourists will touch plants and leave
garbage behind.
</P>
<P>
   Darrel Schoeling, executive director of the 8-year-old
International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators, whose 16
members account for most of the visitors, said those operators are
also concerned about the long-term impact on the environment. He
said that most of them are environmentalists and that it is in
their long-term financial interest to protect the continent.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why when visitors go ashore, there are large and
experienced staffs to insure they have minimal impact,'' he said,
``and why the tour operators adhere to the guidelines for visitors
adopted by the Antarctic Treaty System.''
</P>
<P>
   That series of agreements includes the 1959 Antarctic Treaty,
since signed by 43 nations, plus an environmental protocol that
since Jan. 14, 1998, has banned mining and oil drilling and
provided other environmental safeguards, including fishing limits.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the tour association, which is based in New York,
voluntarily adopted the 100-person limit for shore visits, for
which they use motorized rubber boats called Zodiacs, and wrote
into their bylaws a 400-passenger limit on cruise ships.
</P>
<P>
   The eight U.S. members of the association are Abercrombie &AMP;
Kent, Clipper Cruise Line, Quark Expeditions, Mountain Travel
Sobek, Society Expeditions, Travel Dynamics, Zegrahm Expeditions
and Special Expeditions. Also, Radisson Seven Seas is one of 13
associate members offering occasional Antarctic cruises.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of the 15 vessels in Antarctica this season, nine fly Russian
flags,'' said Schoeling, who explained that the breakup of the
Soviet Union made a number of small ships available to tour
operators like the ones in his group. Those ships, including an
icebreaker and several other vessels whose hulls were hardened
against ice, carry from 40 to 80 passengers.
</P>
<P>
   The Marco Polo (known as the Aleksandr Pushkin while still a
Russian ship) can carry 800. But even after its owner, Orient
Lines, was acquired last year by Norwegian Cruise Line (which does
not belong to the tour association), the Marco Polo has continued
to limit passengers to 500, and otherwise complies with the tour
association's self-imposed limits.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, though, concern about Antarctica's environment
persists. ``It's possible that in the future, we'll look back and
say, `No problem, we worried about it needlessly,''' said Ms. Clark
of the Antarctic Project. ``But until science comes up with the
answers, we owe it to Antarctica and to ourselves to put limits on
our travels there.''

 &HT;    MICROSOFT: NETSCAPE CAUSED ITS OWN WOES
 &HT;    Moving in (f) financial and (w) Washington queues
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Netscape's reversals in its browser wars with
Microsoft stemmed from a shortsighted business strategy that sought
to ``gouge'' Internet service providers, according to the antitrust
testimony of a key Microsoft Corp. executive released Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Cameron Myhrvold, who is due to take the stand at the landmark
federal case Tuesday, contends that Netscape Communications Corp.
``sought to charge (providers) very high prices for distributing
Netscape's Web browsing software,'' called Navigator.
</P>
<P>
   Myhrvold's direct attack against Netscape marks a shift of
strategy on the part of the Microsoft defense team in the trial,
which has entered its 15th week.
</P>
<P>
   The government contends that Microsoft launched a predatory
attack against rival Netscape by cutting illegal deals.
Specifically, the government alleges, Microsoft gave its browsing
technology away as it sought to leverage its huge Windows market
power into a commanding position in the newly booming realm of
cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seeking to gouge (the providers) was shortsighted and
encouraged them to explore alternatives,'' Myhrvold wrote in 57
pages of direct testimony. Myhrvold, 37, is a Microsoft vice
president charged with managing the software giant's business
relationships with firms that operate public networks.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape's browser prices were set when the high-flying company
had ``a commanding 80-90 percent usage share, and Netscape did not
adjust its prices downward until (providers) refused to pay them
any longer,'' Myhrvold maintained.
</P>
<P>
   Turning the government's argument on its head, Myhrvold said it
was Microsoft that came to the industry's rescue when Internet
providers ``were no longer forced to agree to (Netscape's) price
when alternatives appeared on the scene that were equal (or
superior) to Navigator.''
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, on the witness stand, William Poole, senior director
of business development for Windows, defended the Microsoft
practice, since abandoned, of signing contracts that obliged
Windows-based software developers to break their promotional ties
to Netscape when joining the Microsoft camp.
</P>
<P>
   For example, under a 1997 accord, Intuit Inc. got a ``platinum''
deal to appear in the business portion of the so-called Channel Bar
on the Windows 95 desktop.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds to me like you're trying to give us the impression
that Intuit came to you and said 'We'd like to use your browser,'''
David Boies, the lead government attorney told Poole.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not implying that,'' Poole replied, ``It's true.''
</P>
<P>
   Boies then pulled out a stack of internal Microsoft e-mails that
appeared to refute that claim. In one of them, Microsoft chairman
Bill Gates said Intuit could get favorable placement in the Windows
operating system only by agreeing to use its browser.
</P>
<P>
   That approach goes to the heart of the government's charge that
Microsoft used unfair tactics to compete against Netscape.
</P>
<P>
   Later, in the courthouse plazas, Boies, recounting
previously-introduced testimony, referred to a $1 million payment
from Microsoft to Intuit proposed by Gates in his message as a
``bribe.'' But Microsoft spokesman Mark Murray said the payment,
had it been made, would have served merely as compensation for
``sunken costs'' that Intuit had incurred when it switched to
Internet Explorer, the Microsoft browser.

<P>
   ``When my time comes,'' King Hussein said, ``I hope it will be
like my grandfather's _ and like Yitzhak Rabin's.
</P>
<P>
   It was November 1995 at the funeral of my husband, Yitzhak, and
this was the first time since the death of his grandfather that
King Hussein had set foot in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   His bold comment reflected the personal history of the family of
the king. In July 1951, when he was just 16, King Hussein saw his
grandfather, King Abdullah, gunned down at the Al-Aqsa mosque in
Jerusalem by an Arab assassin who feared the king was trying to
make peace between the Arabs and Israel.
</P>
<P>
   For my husband's funeral, 87 heads of state had landed at
Ben-Gurion Airport. President Bill Clinton and former Presidents
George Bush and Jimmy Carter also attended the funeral. Most of the
leaders wore yarmulkes, but King Hussein wore a traditional
Jordanian red-checkered kaffiyeh.
</P>
<P>
   So moving were the king's words: ``My sister, Mrs. Leah Rabin,
my friends, I had never thought the moment would come like this
when I would grieve the loss of a brother, a colleague and a friend
_ a man, a soldier whom we respected as he respected us.
</P>
<P>
   ``You lived as a soldier,'' His Highness continued, ``you died
as a soldier of peace, and I believe it is time for all of us to
come out, openly, and to speak our piece, here today and for all
the times to come ... Let's hope and pray that God will give us all
guidance, each in his respective position, to do what he can for
the better future that Yitzhak Rabin sought with determination and
courage ...
</P>
<P>
   After the burial service, everyone filed past us. I shook hands,
I kissed them as they came to console us, sharing our unspeakable
pain.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Only two years earlier, in October 1994, just before the final
peace agreement between Jordan and Israel was signed in the Arava
Desert, on the Israeli-Jordanian border, my husband Yitzhak was
sitting with King Hussein in the Hashemiyah Palace in Amman. The
two were having a tete-a-tete dinner to finalize the treaty
details.
</P>
<P>
   Yitzhak had mentioned Col. Fawaz Maher, a dashing Jordanian
officer, who used to drive a flashy sports car, and was a friend to
King Hussein when he was an 18-year-old student attending the Royal
Military Academy at Sandhurst. In years to come, that acquaintance
grew into one of great warmth.
</P>
<P>
   Col. Maher and his Turkish wife had a daughter, about one year
old, and they were expecting their second child. News traveled
around the staff college that when Mrs. Maher gave birth to a
second daughter, the colonel wouldn't even visit her at the
hospital, he so deeply wanted a son. He held her responsible.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Maher was anguished over her situation. I said to her that
it was wonderful that she had a second daughter and she would
surely have a son later.
</P>
<P>
   We didn't see the colonel for about 40 years. In the papers we
would occasionally read about his steady advancement. He became
vice chief of staff of the Jordanian army and then chief of staff,
then ambassador to Taiwan, the Soviet Union and Turkey. After that
news we completely lost track of him.
</P>
<P>
   And so, in 1994, Yitzhak said to the king, ``I know that he was
your friend. Whatever became of him?''
</P>
<P>
   ``He still is my friend,'' said King Hussein with a broad smile.
</P>
<P>
   Half an hour later, Maher was standing in the doorway. In fact
he had been quite sick and now walked with a cane. Later, at the
hotel reception, we hugged as though we had always been close
friends. I wanted to find out what had happened since the birth of
their second daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``After our second child, my wife had two more daughters,'' he
explained. ``Then I said to my wife, `My dear, if the fifth time it
is another daughter, you will be fired. That very week I'll take
another wife.'''
</P>
<P>
   I know for sure that he would never have thrown her out, they
loved each other so much. In any event, their fifth and last child
was a son.
</P>
<P>
   Later, on a visit to the Ukraine in 1995, we heard in Kiev that
Maher had suffered a stroke. His Majesty King Hussein sent Maher to
Jerusalem's Hadassah Hospital _ a Jewish hospital _ in his own
helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   Later that week, I entered Maher's hospital room and found his
wife and the fabled fifth child, Maher's son. The son, Ali, was 35.
Ali was every bit as handsome as his father had been _ and, very
interested in modern art, he had become head of the cultural center
of Amman.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On one occasion in 1970, at a holiday reception, I encountered
Andrew Mossbacher, chief of protocol in the U.S. Department of
State. We were at the home of a Nebraska congressman, and
Mossbacher told me he was invited that night to a dinner in honor
of King Hussein of Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Two months earlier, in September 1970 _ ``Black September'' _
the Jordanian army had clashed with PLO guerillas in Jordan. Many
PLO leaders _ but not Yassir Arafat _ were advocating the overthrow
of King Hussein and the establishment of a Palestinian state inside
Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   King Hussein decided to strike back decisively. Meanwhile Syria
threatened to send tanks into Jordan, and the United States was
concerned that the king's government would fall. The United States
wanted to rally support for King Hussein. Israel was the conduit to
send a preemptive warning to Syria to keep their tanks out of
Jordan, but eventually Jordan did all this by itself.
</P>
<P>
   I told Mossbacher, ``Please tell King Hussein that you and I met
at a cocktail party and I asked you to give him my regards, and to
say that we Israelis very much admire his courage and determination
in his struggle with the PLO.'' Perhaps it wouldn't do any good,
but it certainly could do no harm.
</P>
<P>
   Very early the next morning, Mossbacher phoned to say, in his
deep voice, ``Mrs. Rabin, we all have our problems. Perhaps King
Hussein has more than we do. You made the man happy last night. He
was so excited that, when I escorted him to his car, he repeated,
`Please don't forget to give the Rabins my heartfelt thanks and
best wishes.'''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In January 1985, about four months after taking office, Yitzhak
presented his plan for a phased withdrawal of Israeli troops from
Lebanon to take place over five to six months. By June 1985, the
withdrawal from Lebanon was complete.
</P>
<P>
   As the Lebanon resolution moved forward, Yitzhak turned his
focus to Jordan. In March 1985, he held secret talks with King
Hussein in London. He presented the king with an Israeli-made Galil
assault rifle in a beautiful case made from olive wood.
</P>
<P>
   It was well known that Yitzhak had met with King Hussein several
times before they ``officially'' made contact in Washington in
1994. The first of these private meetings dated back to 1975 or
1976. I went with him to Eilat; from there, he left for an
undisclosed location _ it may have been at sea or in the desert.
</P>
<P>
   The press got wind that something was going on. In an Israeli
newspaper, a cartoon appeared depicting Yitzhak in Eilat and King
Hussein in Aqaba playing tennis across the Red Sea. From Eilat you
can see the lights of Aqaba, and vice versa. By car, the two cities
are only 10 minutes apart, but at that time, they were still worlds
away.
</P>
<P>
   Yitzhak had always liked King Hussein greatly and he invariably
came home from their meetings with the same comment: ``It was
delightful, but there were no results.'' The reason why was simple.
The king kept saying: Everything or nothing. And so things stayed
at the point of nothing, until years later, during Yitzhak's second
term as prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On July 25, 1994, a very hot and humid day, King Hussein,
President Clinton and Yitzhak signed, on the White House lawn, a
declaration that ended an official state of war between Israel and
Jordan. Just before the signing ceremony, I met King Hussein and
his wife, Queen Noor al-Hussein, for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   I was standing beside Vice President Gore's wife, Tipper, when
the queen and I were introduced. The Princeton-educated queen, the
daughter of an American airline executive, struck me as both
articulate and surprisingly down-to-earth.
</P>
<P>
   (I was even more impressed when Yitzhak and I were guests of the
king and queen of Jordan, and Queen Noor personally served us at
the table as a special gesture of respect.)
</P>
<P>
   Resolving the agreement with Jordan meant that soon Jews from
all over could at long last visit Petra _ the dream of many young
people who literally risked being killed just for a glimpse of the
spectacular red rock formations.
</P>
<P>
   I couldn't wait to see it. ``Your Majesty, are you aware how
much Israelis always wanted to visit Petra?'' I remember saying to
Queen Noor at this first meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``And, do you know how worried we are already?'' she replied.
She was making reference to the Israeli reputation for ``storming''
tourist sites. Months later, before the opening of an important
bridge between our countries, Queen Noor sent me the most beautiful
gold pin with a relief of the red rock of Petra.
</P>
<P>
   King Hussein and Yitzhak addressed the U.S. Congress on July 26.
In his speech Yitzhak noted, ``Only a 70-minute journey separates
these cities, Jerusalem and Amman _ and 46 years.''
</P>
<P>
   That afternoon, Yitzhak was invited to meet King Hussein alone
at his hotel. Shortly before the meeting, an unexpected message was
delivered: Would Mrs. Rabin please join us? Of course I came along,
figuring that Yitzhak and the king would talk while the queen and I
would spend time together, but I was surprised when His Majesty
asked me to join the three of them. They were to discuss the
financial implications of the Israeli-Jordanian treaty. I quickly
realized that the queen was totally aware of the issues, and I was
pleasantly surprised.
</P>
<P>
   We spent an amiable hour together. The Friday night after we'd
returned from our trip, we were sitting in the living room of our
Tel Aviv apartment when the phone rang. It was the king calling
from his airplane, en route from Washington to London, thanking
Yitzhak for his insight and his friendship.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of the Israeli Day of Independence in May 1995,
Israeli television presented a dialogue between King Hussein and
Yitzhak in Aqaba. Before the interview, we at last visited Petra.
We were a large group, including our children, and Petra was even
more magnificent than I expected.
</P>
<P>
   One walks down the narrow path between sheer red rock faces. The
limestone cliffs surrounding you almost obscure the sky, their
fantastic shapes rich in pinks, reds and grays. At the end of the
path is a clearing with a marvelous temple carved out of the pink
limestone.
</P>
<P>
   But the real excitement was to be found in what God, not man,
made. Yitzhak enjoyed the monumental scenery of Petra, but he may
have savored more the implication of Israelis now being able to see
Petra freely for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   On June 8, 1995, Yitzhak appeared on Larry King's television
show on CNN, along with President Clinton, King Hussein, Shimon
Peres and Yassir Arafat. The interview reflected the rapport these
men now shared.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As Yitzhak walked off the speaker's platform at the rally of
Nov. 4, 1995, he heard the love and blessings of hundreds of
thousands of voices, young and old, too long silent, now ringing
out as one, urging him forward in the name of peace. Descending the
stairs to his waiting car, I am sure his thoughts, as always,
turned to the hard work of the days ahead _ to Syria and beyond.
But a nobody with a 9mm Beretta and a mind littered with hate
interrupted the song of his life _ and my world, our world, was
never to be the same.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the months following Yitzhak's death, the nation paid tribute
by naming many structures and facilities in his memory. On Jan. 6,
the trauma unit of Tel Aviv's Ichilov Hospital was renamed the
Rabin Trauma Unit. King Hussein attended; it was his first visit to
Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
   I expressed my thanks to the whole trauma unit team, who had
been by Yitzhak's side that fateful night of Nov. 4 from the first
moment he was brought there to the very last, when they realized
they could do no more. The shock had been enormous _ to have the
prime minister brought in in critical condition, trying everything
possible to save him, and then having to make the decision to take
him off life support and declare him dead.
</P>
<P>
   I should have thanked them that night in November for their
efforts, but I was dazed _ I just was not thinking at all. Finally,
in a clearer moment, I expressed my gratitude for King Hussein's
presence by quoting scripture: ``Blessed be he by coming and by
leaving us on his way home.''

<P>
   ``When my time comes,'' King Hussein said, ``I hope it will be
like my grandfather's _ and like Yitzhak Rabin's.
</P>
<P>
   It was November 1995 at the funeral of my husband, Yitzhak, and
this was the first time since the death of his grandfather that
King Hussein had set foot in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   His bold comment reflected the personal history of the family of
the king. In July 1951, when he was just 16, King Hussein saw his
grandfather, King Abdullah, gunned down at the Al-Aqsa mosque in
Jerusalem by an Arab assassin who feared the king was trying to
make peace between the Arabs and Israel.
</P>
<P>
   For my husband's funeral, 87 heads of state had landed at
Ben-Gurion Airport. President Bill Clinton and former Presidents
George Bush and Jimmy Carter also attended the funeral. Most of the
leaders wore yarmulkes, but King Hussein wore a traditional
Jordanian red-checkered kaffiyeh.
</P>
<P>
   So moving were the king's words: ``My sister, Mrs. Leah Rabin,
my friends, I had never thought the moment would come like this
when I would grieve the loss of a brother, a colleague and a friend
_ a man, a soldier whom we respected as he respected us.
</P>
<P>
   ``You lived as a soldier,'' His Highness continued, ``you died
as a soldier of peace, and I believe it is time for all of us to
come out, openly, and to speak our piece, here today and for all
the times to come ... Let's hope and pray that God will give us all
guidance, each in his respective position, to do what he can for
the better future that Yitzhak Rabin sought with determination and
courage ...
</P>
<P>
   After the burial service, everyone filed past us. I shook hands,
I kissed them as they came to console us, sharing our unspeakable
pain.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Only two years earlier, in October 1994, just before the final
peace agreement between Jordan and Israel was signed in the Arava
Desert, on the Israeli-Jordanian border, my husband Yitzhak was
sitting with King Hussein in the Hashemiyah Palace in Amman. The
two were having a tete-a-tete dinner to finalize the treaty
details.
</P>
<P>
   Yitzhak had mentioned Col. Fawaz Maher, a dashing Jordanian
officer, who used to drive a flashy sports car, and was a friend to
King Hussein when he was an 18-year-old student attending the Royal
Military Academy at Sandhurst. In years to come, that acquaintance
grew into one of great warmth.
</P>
<P>
   Col. Maher and his Turkish wife had a daughter, about one year
old, and they were expecting their second child. News traveled
around the staff college that when Mrs. Maher gave birth to a
second daughter, the colonel wouldn't even visit her at the
hospital, he so deeply wanted a son. He held her responsible.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Maher was anguished over her situation. I said to her that
it was wonderful that she had a second daughter and she would
surely have a son later.
</P>
<P>
   We didn't see the colonel for about 40 years. In the papers we
would occasionally read about his steady advancement. He became
vice chief of staff of the Jordanian army and then chief of staff,
then ambassador to Taiwan, the Soviet Union and Turkey. After that
news we completely lost track of him.
</P>
<P>
   And so, in 1994, Yitzhak said to the king, ``I know that he was
your friend. Whatever became of him?''
</P>
<P>
   ``He still is my friend,'' said King Hussein with a broad smile.
</P>
<P>
   Half an hour later, Maher was standing in the doorway. In fact
he had been quite sick and now walked with a cane. Later, at the
hotel reception, we hugged as though we had always been close
friends. I wanted to find out what had happened since the birth of
their second daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``After our second child, my wife had two more daughters,'' he
explained. ``Then I said to my wife, `My dear, if the fifth time it
is another daughter, you will be fired. That very week I'll take
another wife.'''
</P>
<P>
   I know for sure that he would never have thrown her out, they
loved each other so much. In any event, their fifth and last child
was a son.
</P>
<P>
   Later, on a visit to the Ukraine in 1995, we heard in Kiev that
Maher had suffered a stroke. His Majesty King Hussein sent Maher to
Jerusalem's Hadassah Hospital _ a Jewish hospital _ in his own
helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   Later that week, I entered Maher's hospital room and found his
wife and the fabled fifth child, Maher's son. The son, Ali, was 35.
Ali was every bit as handsome as his father had been _ and, very
interested in modern art, he had become head of the cultural center
of Amman.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   On one occasion in 1970, at a holiday reception, I encountered
Andrew Mossbacher, chief of protocol in the U.S. Department of
State. We were at the home of a Nebraska congressman, and
Mossbacher told me he was invited that night to a dinner in honor
of King Hussein of Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Two months earlier, in September 1970 _ ``Black September'' _
the Jordanian army had clashed with PLO guerillas in Jordan. Many
PLO leaders _ but not Yassir Arafat _ were advocating the overthrow
of King Hussein and the establishment of a Palestinian state inside
Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   King Hussein decided to strike back decisively. Meanwhile Syria
threatened to send tanks into Jordan, and the United States was
concerned that the king's government would fall. The United States
wanted to rally support for King Hussein. Israel was the conduit to
send a preemptive warning to Syria to keep their tanks out of
Jordan, but eventually Jordan did all this by itself.
</P>
<P>
   I told Mossbacher, ``Please tell King Hussein that you and I met
at a cocktail party and I asked you to give him my regards, and to
say that we Israelis very much admire his courage and determination
in his struggle with the PLO.'' Perhaps it wouldn't do any good,
but it certainly could do no harm.
</P>
<P>
   Very early the next morning, Mossbacher phoned to say, in his
deep voice, ``Mrs. Rabin, we all have our problems. Perhaps King
Hussein has more than we do. You made the man happy last night. He
was so excited that, when I escorted him to his car, he repeated,
`Please don't forget to give the Rabins my heartfelt thanks and
best wishes.'''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   In January 1985, about four months after taking office, Yitzhak
presented his plan for a phased withdrawal of Israeli troops from
Lebanon to take place over five to six months. By June 1985, the
withdrawal from Lebanon was complete.
</P>
<P>
   As the Lebanon resolution moved forward, Yitzhak turned his
focus to Jordan. In March 1985, he held secret talks with King
Hussein in London. He presented the king with an Israeli-made Galil
assault rifle in a beautiful case made from olive wood.
</P>
<P>
   It was well known that Yitzhak had met with King Hussein several
times before they ``officially'' made contact in Washington in
1994. The first of these private meetings dated back to 1975 or
1976. I went with him to Eilat; from there, he left for an
undisclosed location _ it may have been at sea or in the desert.
</P>
<P>
   The press got wind that something was going on. In an Israeli
newspaper, a cartoon appeared depicting Yitzhak in Eilat and King
Hussein in Aqaba playing tennis across the Red Sea. From Eilat you
can see the lights of Aqaba, and vice versa. By car, the two cities
are only 10 minutes apart, but at that time, they were still worlds
away.
</P>
<P>
   Yitzhak had always liked King Hussein greatly and he invariably
came home from their meetings with the same comment: ``It was
delightful, but there were no results.'' The reason why was simple.
The king kept saying: Everything or nothing. And so things stayed
at the point of nothing, until years later, during Yitzhak's second
term as prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On July 25, 1994, a very hot and humid day, King Hussein,
President Clinton and Yitzhak signed, on the White House lawn, a
declaration that ended an official state of war between Israel and
Jordan. Just before the signing ceremony, I met King Hussein and
his wife, Queen Noor al-Hussein, for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   I was standing beside Vice President Gore's wife, Tipper, when
the queen and I were introduced. The Princeton-educated queen, the
daughter of an American airline executive, struck me as both
articulate and surprisingly down-to-earth.
</P>
<P>
   (I was even more impressed when Yitzhak and I were guests of the
king and queen of Jordan, and Queen Noor personally served us at
the table as a special gesture of respect.)
</P>
<P>
   Resolving the agreement with Jordan meant that soon Jews from
all over could at long last visit Petra _ the dream of many young
people who literally risked being killed just for a glimpse of the
spectacular red rock formations.
</P>
<P>
   I couldn't wait to see it. ``Your Majesty, are you aware how
much Israelis always wanted to visit Petra?'' I remember saying to
Queen Noor at this first meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``And, do you know how worried we are already?'' she replied.
She was making reference to the Israeli reputation for ``storming''
tourist sites. Months later, before the opening of an important
bridge between our countries, Queen Noor sent me the most beautiful
gold pin with a relief of the red rock of Petra.
</P>
<P>
   King Hussein and Yitzhak addressed the U.S. Congress on July 26.
In his speech Yitzhak noted, ``Only a 70-minute journey separates
these cities, Jerusalem and Amman _ and 46 years.''
</P>
<P>
   That afternoon, Yitzhak was invited to meet King Hussein alone
at his hotel. Shortly before the meeting, an unexpected message was
delivered: Would Mrs. Rabin please join us? Of course I came along,
figuring that Yitzhak and the king would talk while the queen and I
would spend time together, but I was surprised when His Majesty
asked me to join the three of them. They were to discuss the
financial implications of the Israeli-Jordanian treaty. I quickly
realized that the queen was totally aware of the issues, and I was
pleasantly surprised.
</P>
<P>
   We spent an amiable hour together. The Friday night after we'd
returned from our trip, we were sitting in the living room of our
Tel Aviv apartment when the phone rang. It was the king calling
from his airplane, en route from Washington to London, thanking
Yitzhak for his insight and his friendship.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of the Israeli Day of Independence in May 1995,
Israeli television presented a dialogue between King Hussein and
Yitzhak in Aqaba. Before the interview, we at last visited Petra.
We were a large group, including our children, and Petra was even
more magnificent than I expected.
</P>
<P>
   One walks down the narrow path between sheer red rock faces. The
limestone cliffs surrounding you almost obscure the sky, their
fantastic shapes rich in pinks, reds and grays. At the end of the
path is a clearing with a marvelous temple carved out of the pink
limestone.
</P>
<P>
   But the real excitement was to be found in what God, not man,
made. Yitzhak enjoyed the monumental scenery of Petra, but he may
have savored more the implication of Israelis now being able to see
Petra freely for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   On June 8, 1995, Yitzhak appeared on Larry King's television
show on CNN, along with President Clinton, King Hussein, Shimon
Peres and Yassir Arafat. The interview reflected the rapport these
men now shared.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As Yitzhak walked off the speaker's platform at the rally of
Nov. 4, 1995, he heard the love and blessings of hundreds of
thousands of voices, young and old, too long silent, now ringing
out as one, urging him forward in the name of peace. Descending the
stairs to his waiting car, I am sure his thoughts, as always,
turned to the hard work of the days ahead _ to Syria and beyond.
But a nobody with a 9mm Beretta and a mind littered with hate
interrupted the song of his life _ and my world, our world, was
never to be the same.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the months following Yitzhak's death, the nation paid tribute
by naming many structures and facilities in his memory. On Jan. 6,
the trauma unit of Tel Aviv's Ichilov Hospital was renamed the
RabinTrauma Unit. King Hussein attended; it was his first visit to
Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
   I expressed my thanks to the whole trauma unit team, who had
been by Yitzhak's side that fateful night of Nov. 4 from the first
moment he was brought there to the very last, when they realized
they could do no more. The shock had been enormous _ to have the
prime minister brought in in critical condition, trying everything
possible to save him, and then having to make the decision to take
him off life support and declare him dead.
</P>
<P>
   I should have thanked them that night in November for their
efforts, but I was dazed _ I just was not thinking at all. Finally,
in a clearer moment, I expressed my gratitude for King Hussein's
presence by quoting scripture: ``Blessed be he by coming and by
leaving us on his way home.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Q In my performance review a few weeks ago, my
manager told me to come up with some goals for myself. We just had
a meeting to go over them, and he said he was disappointed that my
goals were so vague and poorly thought out. We are supposed to meet
again, but I am not sure my goals are going to be any different.
What am I supposed to do? A.K. &QL; 
A In a word, it sounds like one of your goals is to come up with
better goals. Although it would have been nice for your manager to
be less vague in terms of what he expects, the fact is that the
goals at work do need to be rather specific.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if you indicated to your manager that your goal is
to be a more productive employee, it is possible for your manager
to indicate that this is not a goal. Rather, this type of statement
is better called a hope or a wish.
</P>
<P>
   If your goal is to be more productive, you need to include the
specifics. For example, you should spell out the actions you will
take to improve your productivity, the priorities and deadlines,
and how you will measure the productivity increases.
</P>
<P>
   When you are establishing work goals for yourself, it is
important to look at each and be able to answer the questions of
who, what, where, when, why and how. Wishes, hopes and dreams are
important, but if you want to make them come true, they need to be
recast as goals. &QL; 
Q Many companies in this area have ``casual Fridays'' where the
employees can dress more casually. Our company does not do this,
and I am annoyed about it, and so are many of my fellow employees.
We have talked to management, and they adamantly refuse to change.
Do you have any suggestions? S.F. &QL; 
A The only suggestion at this point is that you should not go out
and stock up on casual attire. This change has to come from
management, and it sounds like management is not interested in
changing policies or changing clothes.
</P>
<P>
   It may be helpful to look back at the strategy you used in your
meeting with management. For example, if you used more of a
complaint mode than a sales mode, it is not surprising that
management responded with an inflexible mode. It is important to
let management see the advantages and benefits associated with
casual Fridays. You can even suggest that they be implemented on a
trial basis.
</P>
<P>
   In trying to determine how to approach management from this
point, it will be helpful for you to understand whether the refusal
to budge is a reflection of corporate rigidity, emphasis on
tradition, refusal to follow the herd, or any other number of
factors. You should tailor a presentation with such factors in mind
and revisit management, remembering that management often strives
to make decisions that wear well with the employees. &QL; 
Q Our human resources specialist just sent me the new application
blanks we are now supposed to use. This new form she developed is
very bland and does not ask the kinds of questions that are
important to us. None of us want to use it. What do you think we
should do now? E.C. &QL; 
A Since you feel that your application blank is better described as
an application bland, you should meet with the human resources
specialist to discuss your concerns. Every change that she made may
be warranted, but what is unwarranted is her lack of communication
associated with the development and introduction of the new form.
</P>
<P>
   One reason why you may not like the new application blank is
that all of the questions are job related, just as the law
requires. However, these questions can generate a wide range of
very important information. Through a well-designed application
blank, you can get a picture of the applicant's work history, along
with insight into his or her training, skills and abilities that
relate to the job, and this is highly predictive data.
</P>
<P>
   You can also learn something about an applicant through the way
that he or she completes the application blank. After all, this is
the first work assignment. Did the applicant approach it thoroughly
and carefully?
</P>
<P>
   If there are job-related or technical questions that you would
like to see included in the application blank, be sure to mention
these to the human relations specialist. But, if the questions you
would like to add include issues such as race, religion, sex, age,
national origin, or any other issues that have nothing to do with
the job, the human relations specialist is going to have questions
about you. &QL;

 &HT;    ACC considers taking SEC to court after Auburn cancels football
game
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Angered over Auburn's decision to buy its way out of its Sept. 2
football game at Florida State, the Atlantic Coast Conference has
threatened to take the SEC school to court and to discourage its
members from playing Auburn in any sport in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Auburn athletics director David Housel informed Florida State on
Friday night that the school would exercise a $500,000 buyout
clause in its contract to play in the Thursday-night ESPN game in
Tallahassee, Fla. But in a strongly worded letter to Housel, ACC
commissioner John Swofford said that the cancellation would create
other costs and that the ACC would use the courts to recoup them.
</P>
<P>
   Florida State athletics director Dave Hart did not learn of
Auburn's decision until he returned from dinner with his wife
Friday night and found a voice-mail message from Housel. Saturday
morning the two men had what was described as an ``intense''
conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was unacceptable behavior and told him that in no
uncertain terms,'' Hart said. ``In a way, I feel sorry for David,
because it's obvious this decision was made above his head.''
</P>
<P>
   Contacted Monday, Housel responded to Hart's claim by simply
saying it was an ``institutional decision'' for Auburn to buy its
way out of the Florida State game and replace it with a home
contest against Division I-AA Appalachian State on Sept. 4. Housel
reiterated his position that Auburn opted out of the game because
of the controversy that would have surrounded it in light of Terry
Bowden's forced resignation at Auburn on Oct. 23, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Florida State is coached by Bobby Bowden, Terry Bowden's father,
and the state's media already were labeling the game as a chance
for revenge by the elder Bowden.
</P>
<P>
   ``Playing Florida State is not the issue. We would still like to
play Florida State, but in the future,'' Housel said. ``We can
either take the controversy now or take it all summer. We chose to
take it now. We know it is a debatable decision, but we've made it,
and now it's time to move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Moving on might not be so simple for Auburn. In fact, the
negative fallout between Auburn and the ACC has just begun:
</P>
<P>
   _ Auburn's decision probably will cost Florida State and the ACC
one of their nationally televised games. The conference not only
loses that exposure but also a strong non-conference game that
could help Florida State in the BCS standings. And by contract, the
ACC might have to compensate ESPN $850,000 for the loss of that
Thursday night game. Swofford's letter makes it plain that the ACC
will sue Auburn for that money. Auburn does not believe it is
legally responsible for compensating ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our position is we had a contract with Florida State and that
we satisfied the terms of that contract,'' Housel said.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if he is concerned about a possible lawsuit by the
ACC, Housel said, ``Our attorneys will handle it if it needs to be
handled.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Both parties agree that Auburn's actions on the 1999 game mean
that the meeting scheduled for 2000 in Auburn also will not take
place. Florida State believes it should be compensated an
additional $500,000 for that game. Housel said the contract is not
clear on that point.
</P>
<P>
   _ The ACC athletics directors are scheduled to meet in Marco
Island, Fla., this weekend, and among the items on the agenda will
be a discussion of how the conference should react to this
situation. It is possible, according to Swofford's letter, that ACC
school's no longer will schedule Auburn in any sports.
</P>
<P>
   A part of that discussion will also be about the viability of
future football contracts between Auburn and its league members.
Clemson has a four-game contract with Auburn set to begin in 2005.
Georgia Tech has a three game-deal with Auburn that begins in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be surprised if we made a change, because we've been
trying to get Auburn back on the schedule for a long time,'' Tech
athletics director Dave Braine said. ``But I'll go down there and
listen to what everybody has to say.''

 &HT;    Bulls' home opener not as much cause for celebration as in years
pastBy Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ At one point Friday in the Chicago Bulls'
opening-night game at Utah, Ron Harper sensed his team about to
drop out of contention and needing help.
</P>
<P>
   As he told the story later, Harper looked around for Scottie
Pippen and Michael Jordan and at that moment realized he was
staring at the rest of his basketball career without them. ``Oh,
God,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If Chicago's fans haven't accepted that already, the new state
of the Bulls will be brought home tonight when they play their home
opener against the Atlanta Hawks. The game is sold out, but
attendance is not compulsory.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the '90s, the home opener has been an evening of
celebration for the Bulls. This is the evening in which they handed
out the rings that represented five other championships won the
previous spring. Then they raised another banner and started
another championship quest.
</P>
<P>
   That won't happen, because four principal architects of the
Bulls' sixth championship in eight years have departed the stage,
and neither chairman Jerry Reinsdorf nor general manager Jerry
Krause wants to face a hostile audience since allowing the team to
be torn apart after Michael Jordan retired last month.
</P>
<P>
   But for the banner, it will be a routine opening night, and the
Hawks will walk out to see rival players who evoke the memories of
David Greenwood, Dave Corzine and Orlando Woolridge, featured
players on mediocre Bulls teams of the '80s. Already, the Bulls are
being treated as just another mediocre team. Sunday night in the
Los Angeles Sports Arena, they barely held on to beat the Clippers
before an announced 6,118.
</P>
<P>
   A chance for a little revenge? Steve Smith was asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yep. I'd rather play against Mike and Scottie because you want
to compete against the best, but it won't bother me if we beat 'em
by 30,'' Smith said. ``They used to do it to everybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   Apart from Toni Kukoc and Ron Harper, key figures in recent
years, the Bulls who will labor on your television screens tonight
are journeymen.
</P>
<P>
   Starting center Andrew Lang, cast off by Milwaukee to open
salary-cap room, started his career in Phoenix and also has served
stints in Philadelphia, Atlanta and Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Starting power forward Mark Bryant played off the bench in
Portland and Phoenix. He was a throw-in to the sign-and-trade deal
that allowed center Luc Longley to join the Suns.
</P>
<P>
   The one bright light new to the team is Brent Barry, who came
aboard as a free agent, much sought after he decided he would never
again play for Pat Riley in Miami. But this is his third team in
four seasons. A clever passer, Barry, with a frame that is all
skin, bone and sinew, plays Jordan's position, but he is neither a
particularly good shooter nor physically strong enough to defend
well.
</P>
<P>
   Again, none of that will disturb the Hawks.
</P>
<P>
   Five times, Jordan &AMP; Co. knocked the Hawks or Lenny Wilkens'
Cleveland teams out of the playoffs. That cannot happen again.
``They had a great run,'' the coach said, implying that now it is
someone else's turn.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawks, 2-1, would like to be that someone. They have
completed their single assignment of three games in three nights
and now can settle into a schedule that is merely arduous, no
longer ludicrous.
</P>
<P>
   Leave it to the Knicks to face three sets of three in a row and
others to do it at least twice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It made me mad we had to start the season like that,'' Dikembe
Mutombo said. ``It was ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   If so, then having the opportunity to face a weakened Bulls team
takes the Hawks to the opposite circumstance: the sublime.

 &HT;    Browns look to rebuild franchise with big-name veterans
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The resurrection of one of the NFL's most storied franchises
moves another significant step forward this afternoon when
Cleveland Browns officials are expected to acquire 30 to 35 veteran
players in the NFL's special expansion draft.
</P>
<P>
   While the pool of 150 available players includes several
high-profile performers, most notably all-time sack leader Reggie
White, the only connection between players selected by the Browns
and the Hall of Fame is that the lottery is being conducted at the
pro football shrine in Canton, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our plan is toward (taking) younger players, guys we can build
with and who should be able to help us two or three years down the
road,'' Browns general manger Dwight Clark said Monday. ``There are
several players who fit that description and who excite us.''
</P>
<P>
   The rules of the expansion draft stipulate that the Browns can
select between 30 and 42 veterans or expend 38 percent of the
projected $58 million salary cap, about $22 million. Officials said
Monday the club won't come close to the $22 million mark in cap
designations for the players taken today. In the most recent
``mock'' draft, the Browns took 30 to 33 players, at an aggregate
cap total of about $15 million, a team official acknowledged
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The league's free-agent signing period begins Friday, and the
Browns are expected to pursue some of the better-known unrestricted
veterans ardently.
</P>
<P>
   When Carolina and Jacksonville entered the NFL in 1995, they
took 35 and 31 players, respectively. Only 15 of those players made
the Panthers roster in '95 and just one, wide receiver Mark
Carrier, still is with the team. The Jaguars kept 22 veterans from
the expansion draft on the roster, but only three remain now.
</P>
<P>
   High on the Browns list are safety Charles Mincy (Tampa Bay);
offensive linemen Todd Rucci (New England), Jeff Buckey (Miami) and
Jerry Reynolds (N.Y. Giants); and defensive linemen Ferric Collons
(New England), Jose White (Jacksonville) and Marcus Jones (Tampa
Bay).

 &HT;    Daytona debut disappointing for Jones and crew
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ The life of a rookie on NASCAR's Winston
Cup circuit is tough enough, but Buckshot Jones of Tucker, Ga. has
had more than his share of obstacles in preparing for Sunday's
Daytona 500.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, a University of Georgia graduate who now lives in
Spartanburg, S.C., decided not to participate in second-round
qualifying for Thursday's Gatorade 125 twin races, which determine
positions 3 through 30 of the Daytona 500 field.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, 28, also won't drive his No. 00 Pontiac in today's
third-round qualifying, so he'll stand on his speed from Saturday,
which was 44th out of 57 drivers at 189.641 mph. That means Jones
will start one of the 125s near the back row.
</P>
<P>
   And Jones will have to finish in the top 14 of his qualifier to
make the field for his first Daytona 500. Jones pulled out of
qualifying after another slow practice time on Monday. Now, his
crew will have two additional days to dissect the car's problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Monday's practice) was worse,'' Jones said. ``We thought that
maybe we were really doing something wrong. That's why we got the
people from Hendricks Motorsports (which owns Jeff Gordon's team)
to look at our car. We kind of got a setup from them, and we went
back out, but the car actually ran a little bit slower.
</P>
<P>
   ``That just leaves us to believe that we've got a serious
problem with the chassis or the body somewhere. The thing that's
frustrating is that I don't think you could bring in an expert and
he could tell you exactly what's wrong with our car.''
</P>
<P>
   Daytona's Speed Weeks have been a disappointing start for Jones,
the most popular driver on NASCAR's Busch Series last season. After
finishing ninth in points and winning one Busch race, Jones thought
his Buckshot Racing team was ready for the jump to Winston Cup.
</P>
<P>
   But Jones already has faced a number of obstacles, including the
car's problems and his team's inability to pick up a primary
sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to have sponsors in Winston Cup,'' Jones said. ``In
Busch, you could get by for a while. It's not just the money
aspect. I think the guys on the team feel better when there's a
sponsor (logo) on their jackets.''
</P>
<P>
   Buckshot Racing is owned by Billy Jones, the driver's father and
owner of Crown Fiber Communications, a Norcross-based fiber-optic
construction company. The team moved its headquarters to a new $3
million facility in Spartanburg in November.
</P>
<P>
   Buckshot Racing enters this season with Crown Fiber as the car's
primary sponsor. Billy Jones spent much of the offseason
negotiating a sponsorship with United Parcel Service but never
reached an agreement. Jones denies a widespread rumor on the
circuit that UPS axed the deal after he shipped contracts back to
UPS using Federal Express.
</P>
<P>
   ``If UPS would have sent me that contract, they would have never
had to worry about it being shipped back by UPS or Federal
Express,'' Jones said. ``I would have hand-delivered it. Even if I
had made that mistake, UPS isn't the type of company that would
have killed the contract for that kind of mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Buckshot Jones will be fighting for more than a sponsor and a
spot in the Daytona 500 when he drives in Thursday's qualifiers. He
also will be trying to shed his label as an aggressive, and
sometimes reckless, driver. He earned that reputation during his
much-publicized feud with driver Randy LaJoie on the Busch Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect the good with the bad,'' Jones said. ``I think a lot
of the stuff came from me and Randy. . . . I am aggressive. But
there's a difference between being aggressive and reckless.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll put the bumper to somebody. If you're running in the
back, no, you don't need to be aggressive. But if I'm behind you
and I bump you a little bit because I'm faster, that's racing.''
</P>
<P>
   Tracks on the Winston Cup series can be lonely for rookies, as
veterans often are reluctant to draft or drive side by side with
new drivers. Some veterans are waiting for Jones to prove himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did a lot of Busch races for ESPN as a commentator,''
veteran driver Kyle Petty said. ``I saw some of the stuff that's
gone on on the race track with Buckshot. Some of the stuff, I'm
going to tell you, has been his fault.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm still willing to give him the benefit of the doubt on
a lot of it, because with a lot of things that have happened and a
lot of the things that he's been blamed for, he was white as the
driven snow. It was not his fault, but everybody instantly went,
`Buckshot.' He's got that reputation, but he's got an opportunity
to come here and start all over. Hopefully, he'll make the best of
it and not put himself in that position.''
</P>
<P>
   Before his team's struggles at Daytona, Billy Jones predicted
that his son would win a Winston Cup points championship in three
years. Buckshot Jones predicted he'd win rookie of the year over
Elliott Sandler and Tony Stewart, who are driving for more
established teams.''
</P>
<P>
   With his car struggling, Jones will get a shot Thursday at
proving his driving ability _ and an opportunity to earn the trust
of NASCAR veterans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always though Buckshot was the minus on our team,'' Billy
Jones said. ``Right now, our car is the minus on our team. We just
can't figure it out. We're getting outside help, and we can't
figure it out. But when it comes to racing, Buckshot can race with
the best of them. He's our plus in this deal right now. This won't
be the first time he's started in the back.''

 &HT;    Auburn could make history in game against Ole Miss
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   An Auburn basketball that has gone where no other SEC team had
gone before could add another historic accomplishment to its resume
tonight when the Tigers host Mississippi at 9:30 p.m. (ESPN).
</P>
<P>
   Auburn (22-1, 10-1 SEC) already has earned distinction as the
first SEC team to win 20 games by the end of January. Mighty
Kentucky won 19 games before February four times, but it never hit
the 20 mark.
</P>
<P>
   With Cincinnati, Stanford, and Kentucky all losing last week,
Auburn enters tonight's game ranked No. 3 behind Duke and
Connecticut. It is Auburn's highest ranking since 1959, when the
Tigers started 19-0 and were ranked No. 2 for one week. The next
week they lost to Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   If Auburn can get by Ole Miss (17-7, 7-4) tonight, it will be
the first team in school history to post 23 victories. Sonny
Smith's teams in 1985 and 1986 were 22-12 and 22-11, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``To tell you the truth, we're really not talking about all that
kind of stuff,'' said Cliff Ellis, now getting some support for
national coach of the year. ``It's good for the fans, but I'm not
sure it's healthy for the players to get caught up in all that
stuff. When you get on a ride like this, it's really important to
just focus on one game at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellis doesn't want to look ahead, but the Auburn fans can't
resist. Starting tonight, the Tigers play their next three games at
home, where they have won 13 in a row. Auburn then finishes the
regular season with road games at Arkansas (16-7) and Mississippi
State (16-8).
</P>
<P>
   It is not inconceivable that Auburn could run the table and
then, barring an early exit in the SEC Tournament in Atlanta, they
could grab yet another piece of history: A No. 1 seed in the NCAA
Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   The odds are in Auburn's favor. After a three-game suspension
for violating team rules, junior Chris Porter came off the bench
Saturday night to score 23 points and pull down 12 rebounds in an
80-54 thumping of LSU. Included in those 23 points was a putback
dunk that will make everybody's highlight reel.
</P>
<P>
   Porter will be back in the starting lineup tonight, which can't
be good news for the Rebels, who are fighting to get an NCAA bid.
Mississippi has won five of its last six, including Saturday's
79-68 upset of Florida in Gainesville, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   MISSISSIPPI AT AUBURN
</P>
<P>
   When: 9:30 p.m. today.
</P>
<P>
   Where: Beard-Eaves Memorial Coliseum, Auburn, Ala.
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    Inside pro tennis: Chang, Gambill sign on for AT&AMP;T
 &HT;    By Todd Holcomb
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Michael Chang and Jan-Michael Gambill are the first
players confirmed for the AT&AMP;T Challenge, April 26-May 2 at Atlanta
Athletic Club.
</P>
<P>
   Chang, who bypassed Atlanta last year, is a two-time AT&AMP;T
champion (1994-95) who suffered through wrist and knee injuries
last year, resulting in his worst campaign of the decade. The
former No. 2 player is now at No. 26.
</P>
<P>
   Chang, who will turn 27 later this month, showed signs he can
still be a top-10 player at the Australian Open, where he took
Goran Ivanisevic five sets before losing 7-5 in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Gambill, ranked No. 37, is the best young American player on
tour and had wins last year over Andre Agassi, Alex Corretja, Tim
Henman and Mark Philippoussis.
</P>
<P>
   Not his best on clay, Gambill made his Atlanta debut last year
and lost in the second round. He beat Mariano Zabaleta in the first
round after trailing 6-0, 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   ProServ, which owns the AT&AMP;T Challenge, is still pursuing
defending champion Pete Sampras and Boris Becker.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras back on court
</P>
<P>
   Sampras makes his 1999 debut this week in San Jose, Calif. and
has an easy draw to the semifinals, where he could face
Philippoussis. Sampras' 10-week break was his longest since he
returned to finish the 11th grade in 1988. Sampras last week
officially declared himself unavailable for the first-round Davis
Cup match in Great Britain. Expect the U.S. to field a lineup of
Gambill and Todd Martin, perhaps Vince Spadea, against the Brits'
Henman and Greg Rusedski. ``I'm not going to enjoy the criticism,''
Sampras said, ``but at what price are you going to sacrifice your
goals? . . . I can't finish the year No. 1 and play Davis Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   Loose points
</P>
<P>
   Martina Hingis is No. 1 again, as of Monday's new WTA Tour
rankings. Lindsay Davenport had ended Hingis' 75-week reign at the
U.S. Open. Hingis is 14-1 this year, including last week's
tournament title in Tokyo. . . . The decision by the Czech Republic
to ban Petr Korda from playing in his home country won't have any
practical effect, because Korda wasn't likely to play there,
anyway. He wasn't planning on playing Davis Cup.

 &HT;    Majority blames IOC for current Olympics scandal
 &HT;    (EDS: Moving in (a) general news and (s) sports categories.)
 &HT;    By Melissa Turner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The ongoing Olympic bribery scandal appears to be
taking a toll on the public's perception of the Games as the
embodiment of success, high standards and fair play.
</P>
<P>
   The Games now are all about ``big business and money,'' say more
than half of 200 Americans surveyed in an independent study on the
public's attitudes about the Olympics since the influence-peddling
scandal surrounding the 2002 Winter Games in Salt Lake City broke
late last year.
</P>
<P>
   And about four of 10 respondents said their overall impression
of the Games has been lessened by the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   The survey was conducted Feb. 1-5 by Performance Research of
Newport, R.I.
</P>
<P>
   Not only are the Games tainted by the stain of commercialism,
but more than half of the public now says it thinks they are
``becoming just like big professional sports events filled with
strikes and controversies.''
</P>
<P>
   Although negative impressions about the Olympic ideals have been
created, the public mostly blames the International Olympic
Committee rather than the cities that compete aggressively to host
the Games.
</P>
<P>
   And corporate sponsors, who are paying the billions to stage the
sporting extravaganzas, generally are forgiven. Fewer than
one-fourth of the respondents said they were less likely to support
Olympic sponsors because of the controversy.
</P>
<P>
   ``In general, for all the sort of beauty and altruism associated
with the Olympic ideal, people recognize there is a cost associated
with that,'' said Susan Rosenberg, spokeswoman for Atlanta-based
United Parcel Service, a worldwide sponsor of the Games. ``And in
the United States, that cost is not going to be borne by the
government.''
</P>
<P>

   ``Frankly, I don't think the taint will be removed until

 &HT;    Majority blames IOC for current Olympics scandal
 &HT;    (EDS: Moving in (a) general news and (s) sports categories.)
 &HT;    By Melissa Turner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The ongoing Olympic bribery scandal appears to be
taking a toll on the public's perception of the Games as the
embodiment of success, high standards and fair play.
</P>
<P>
   The Games now are all about ``big business and money,'' say more
than half of 200 Americans surveyed in an independent study on the
public's attitudes about the Olympics since the influence-peddling
scandal surrounding the 2002 Winter Games in Salt Lake City broke
late last year.
</P>
<P>
   And about four of 10 respondents said their overall impression
of the Games has been lessened by the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   The survey was conducted Feb. 1-5 by Performance Research of
Newport, R.I.
</P>
<P>
   Not only are the Games tainted by the stain of commercialism,
but more than half of the public now says it thinks they are
``becoming just like big professional sports events filled with
strikes and controversies.''
</P>
<P>
   Although negative impressions about the Olympic ideals have been
created, the public mostly blames the International Olympic
Committee rather than the cities that compete aggressively to host
the Games.
</P>
<P>
   And corporate sponsors, who are paying the billions to stage the
sporting extravaganzas, generally are forgiven. Fewer than
one-fourth of the respondents said they were less likely to support
Olympic sponsors because of the controversy.
</P>
<P>
   ``In general, for all the sort of beauty and altruism associated
with the Olympic ideal, people recognize there is a cost associated
with that,'' said Susan Rosenberg, spokeswoman for Atlanta-based
United Parcel Service, a worldwide sponsor of the Games. ``And in
the United States, that cost is not going to be borne by the
government.''
</P>
<P>
   But just under half would join in the resounding call for the
resignation of IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch. Nearly six in
10 placed blame for the scandal on the IOC.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, I don't think the taint will be removed until

most notably the leaders of Syria and Israel, a tribute in death to

   Y2K-PANIC (Undated) _ The early fears about the Year 2000
computer problem featured all sorts of machines driven haywire by
their inability to read dates in the new year. That was before tens
of billions of dollars were spent on computer repairs and upgrades.
Now a chorus of regulators, Year 2000 project managers and other
authorities warn that Americans fearing for the worst may end up
inflicting more serious damage on themselves, their neighbors and
the economy than anything the computers do. Some of the concerns
are almost humorous. But planning experts are taking seriously a
wide range of Year 2000 disaster scenarios starring humans,
including bank runs, hoarding of food and gasoline, fires caused by
misuse of newly acquired wood stoves and generators, and a rise in
gun violence stemming from the surge in firearm sales to those
fearing civil unrest. By Barnaby J. Feder. 2,000 words.

   OBIT-MURDOCH (Undated) _ Iris Murdoch, one of the most

weeks in a nursing home in Oxford, England. She was 79 and had been
suffering from the effects of Alzheimer's disease. Her struggle was

emerged from the fringes of health care with an astonishing
flourish and now shows clear signs of joining the medical
mainstream. Despite many cautionary tales about adulterated and
even dangerous products, herbs formulated as capsules, tinctures,
extracts and teas _ and increasingly as additions to common foods
like potato chips and fruit drinks _ are now routinely used by a
third of American adults seeking to enhance their health or
alleviate their illnesses. By Jane E. Brody. (3000 words)

 &HT;        PENNSYLVANIANS FLOOD SENATORS WITH CALLS, AS IMPEACHMENT
TRIAL WRAPS UP   By Lisa Fine  
 &HT;    c. 1999 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Feb. 8 -- Of the thousands of Pennsylvanians who
have called their Senators, most say they've had enough of
President Clinton's impeachment trial. But they are split on
whether he should be convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Since the House voted to impeach Clinton in December, Sen. Rick
Santorum's office received 40,000 responses from constituents.
About 70 percent of the calls, e-mails, and letters have been in
favor of a speedy end to the trial. ``The calls have swung back and
forth on whether to convict,'' said Robert Traynham, a spokesman
for Santorum, R-Pa. ``It's like a pendulum ... One day they run
way, and the next it's the other way.''
</P>
<P>
   Staffers for Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., report half the calls
he's received are for conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Senate impeachment trial is expected to end this
week, calls to the Senators' offices have not picked up, their
staff members said.
</P>
<P>
   Specter's office received ``tens of thousands'' of calls since
the trial began, said his spokesman John Ullyot.
</P>
<P>
   At the start of the trial, Specter's office received about 300
calls a day, but the average has since dropped to about 100. ``But
the feelings have been just as intense as from the beginning of the
trial,'' Ullyot said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The E-commerce pioneer Amazon.com strives for a clean look for
its online bookstore. That is why executives consider it
unnecessary to clutter its World Wide Web pages and pithy book
recommendations with notices that publishers are starting to pay to
have titles featured as ``New and Notable'' or ``Destined for
Greatness.''
</P>
<P>
   The rapidly growing company began charging publishers modest
fees last summer in a limited experiment. But this year, Amazon
increased the offerings to publishers so that now $10,000 is the
price tag for a premium package for a newly released computer book
_ consideration that includes the top slot on the computer home
page, an author profile or interview and ``complete Amazon.com
editorial review treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   The practice _ which involves using money from publishers called
cooperative advertising allowances _ is a sign of Amazon's growing
power in the book industry, which appears eager to pay tribute to
promote titles ranging from John Grisham's new novel, ``The
Testament,'' to Roy Blount Jr.'s photo book of canine poetry, ``If
Only You Knew How Much I Smell You: True Portraits of Dogs.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a rather delicate move for Amazon, which has distinguished
itself with its thoughtful editorial voice and its staff of
editors, whose recommendations are featured prominently in terse,
one-paragraph blurbs on its home pages for a variety of topics.
From its crowded Seattle offices, Amazon has sought to create a
community of book lovers, who have responded to the bookseller's
advice about ``What We're Reading'' with grateful testimonials
lauding the company for avoiding hype.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon's executives insist that their virtual territory is not
for sale because the company reserves the right to reject books for
the program that do not meet their standards of quality. And they
stress that they still feature a majority of titles without charge,
frequently turning down submissions from publishers. However,
several participating publishers said that the titles backed with
advertising dollars were rarely rejected.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't take real estate on our home page and sell it,'' said
Mary Morouse, Amazon's vice president for purchasing. ``I can't
just let anybody believe that you give us a check and we're going
to put it up there.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the new program has evoked a variety of responses from
publishers. Some are reluctant to discuss the blurring line between
editorial and advertising. Others view the practice as an exciting
new opportunity that is no different from the terrestrial custom of
selling display space in bookstore chains and supermarkets. And
then there are the doubting publishers who view Amazon's move as an
ominous signal that the David in the competitive Internet book wars
is starting to lumber like Goliath.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amazon does have this kind of karma, as if it were a big
independent store and now they're putting that at risk,'' said
Daniel Simon, publisher of Seven Stories Press in Manhattan.
``They're booksellers, but in some respects they're like a book
review, with people turning to them to see what's good. They have a
very special relationship with their readers and you think they
should recognize that they're putting it up for sale.''
</P>
<P>
   Amazon's fierce No.2 competitor, Barnesandnoble.com, is also
preparing to offer cooperative advertising this year to publishers
although it has not publicly released any details. Its new chief
executive, Jonathan Bulkeley, promises clear distinctions between
editorial material and advertising, possibly by graphically
separating advertising from editorial text.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are areas of editorial that are never for sale at any
price,'' Mr. Bulkeley said, adding that Amazon is ``messing with
the consumer's brains if they're trying to play both sides, but
maybe they can execute it.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it will always be a question in my mind: Is this `destined
for greatness' or is this paid for?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At Amazon, there was considerable discussion about how to design
the program that the company labels ``E-merchandising.'' Mrs.
Morouse said that a critical concern ``was that we might have a
perception that we're selling placement,'' but she said that the
company believed it had resolved that issue by giving editors the
power to reject books that were nominated by publishers. The
company is also experimenting with a cooperative advertising
program for videos and compact disks, which it also sells online.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to list the specific benefits available to publishers,
Mrs. Morouse declined, saying that the material is ``confidential''
for competitive reasons.
</P>
<P>
   However, internal price documents obtained by The New York Times
indicate that Amazon has increased the scope and price of its
cooperative advertising program since it started offering
opportunities in June.
</P>
<P>
   The company does not accept advertising dollars for its basic
listings of books, which include information about the price and
various reviews from critics and readers. With its expanded
merchandising program, it offers packages that include a wide
variety of features such as its E-mail alerts to customers about
not-yet-published books or placement in the ``What We're Reading''
slots of category pages for cooking or mysteries and thrillers.
</P>
<P>
   In the early experimental stages of its cooperative advertising
program, Amazon listed a price of $500 to put a title on a list
labeled ``What We're Reading'' for two to three days. With its new
price list for the first half of the year, it can cost as much as
$5,000 a title to promote a children's book in the program, which
offers coverage in the ``Destined for Greatness'' slot on a Web
page devoted to best sellers or a top position in Amazon's Kids
Superstore home page.
</P>
<P>
   For a popular adult trade book, $10,000 is the price of a ``Tier
1'' premium package that among other things includes an author
profile, feature coverage in the ``Destined for Greatness''
category and announcements on the home page touting the book's
on-sale date.
</P>
<P>
   Simon &AMP; Schuster sought such treatment for its marquee author
Stephen King, whose novel of haunted love, ``Bag of Bones,'' was
also promoted as part of the package with ``Best Sellers Delivers''
E-mail alerts to thousands of customers. Typically, publishers are
more generous with money for well-known authors because they have
larger marketing budgets to spend on best-selling, brand-name
writers like King and Grisham. In coming months, John le Carre's
new novel, ``Single &AMP; Single,'' will be featured in a similar
fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Such promotions do not contain any notice or visual clue to
indicate that publishers have backed the recommendations with
advertising dollars.
</P>
<P>
   During the development of its merchandising program, Amazon
decided not to include tags because executives believed that they
could provide adequate protection for customers through screening
of books by experienced editors, who specialized in particular
subject categories and often signed their names to E-mail messages
suggesting worthy books.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it would be more distracting to have a book tagged,''
Amazon's Mrs. Morouse said. ``I think that would clutter it up. The
customer experience is really clean and I want to keep it clean.''

</P>
<P>
   Thus far, Amazon's advertising opportunity has been limited to
about 20 to 50 publishers, many of them large companies like Random
House, Simon &AMP; Schuster, Penguin Putnam, HarperCollins, IDG and
Warner Books. But Amazon has plans to expand its offerings to the
next tier of 500 publishers with efforts planned to promote the
program at the book industry's annual trade convention in April.
</P>
<P>
   The program is as much of an experiment for publishers, who are
also trying to determine the effectiveness of this approach.
</P>
<P>
   IDG Books Worldwide, in Foster City, Calif., is so pleased with
the results of its participation that it is increasing its online
marketing. For $2,500, it placed its ``Tax Guides for Dummies'' on
a special seasonal tax center Web page and watched its sales
increase 56 percent after it was posted Jan. 15 and highlighted in
the ``Amazon.com Recommends'' feature, which lauded the title as
one of a handful of ``bellwether'' guides. The Dummies tax guide
also appeared in the ``New and Notable'' category of Amazon's
business and investing Web page.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a virtual world, placement is critical,'' said Steven
Berkowitz, president of IDG, who said the company had paid to
feature at least 20 titles and would continue to do so. The program
works well, he said, because customers feel ``the titles are
recommended.''
</P>
<P>
   Warner Books and its sister company, Little, Brown &AMP; Co., are
still evaluating the best strategies for advertising online after
promoting more than 15 books through the program, according to
Sarah Ford, who manages online accounts for Warner.
</P>
<P>
   They paid to feature Roy Blount Jr.'s book of puppy poetry
(``What does that mean `expensive shoe?' I ate it because it
smelled like you.'' ) in Amazon's gift center during the holiday
season and saw sales soar to 1,000 copies a week from about 100.
Amazon's reviewer had advised readers, ``You'll never be able to
resist this entertaining and affectionate look at our canine
friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ford said results were also significant for an online
promotion of ``Spyder Web,'' a techno-thriller from Warner Books
that appeared in the ``What We're Reading'' and ``New and Notable''
slots of Amazon's mystery and thriller home page.
</P>
<P>
   In its review, Amazon lauded ``Spyder Web,'' for its ``cool,
careful structure'' and the promise of its first-time author, Tom
Grace, who may represent ``the next generation of Tom Clancys.''
Other critics were more reserved; Kirkus Reviews, which also
appeared on an Amazon listing, labeled the book ``a spirited if
clunky techno-thriller.''
</P>
<P>
   Amazon's reviewers also praised other books placed by Warner and
Little, Brown. They called Michael Connelly's ``Angels Flight''
``another masterwork'' and featured it on its mystery and thriller
page under the heading ``Amazon.com Recommends.'' They also
commended ``Toyer,'' a featured title placed by Little, Brown, as a
``driving (sometimes melodramatic) suspense novel.'' The New York
Times Book Review panned the same title, about a lunatic who
disabled a series of female victims with a gruesome surgical
procedure, as a ``macabre first novel'' that was ``stunning at
first glance, but hollow at the core.''
</P>
<P>
   The merchandising of featured books can come at a cost, but
Amazon stresses that there are still books worthy of highlighting
without charge. For example, it gave prominent placement free to
``Careless Love,'' the second volume of Peter Guralnick's biography
of Elvis Presley, and the novel ``Amy and Isabelle'' by Elizabeth
Strout.
</P>
<P>
   ``With our home page, the overwhelming majority of featured
books in a given month do not have co-op dollars behind them,''
said Bill Curry, a spokesman for Amazon, who noted that Amazon's
list of top 20 titles last Friday contained at least nine that were
featured without advertising support.
</P>
<P>
   That assurance, though, is not entirely comforting to smaller
publishers who lack large advertising budgets to back their books.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's terrible, because I've been in love with Amazon,'' said
John Oakes, the publisher of Four Walls Eight Windows in New York.
``They're very efficient. They really do a good job. You can't tell
me that they would pick the same books. If they went to people and
said, `We've chosen these books,' there's obviously no independent
publisher who's going to pay 12 grand.''

FUNERAL OF KING HUSSEIN OF JORDAN ATTRACTS EXTRAORDINARY ARRAY OF
DIGNITARIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (See related stories: JORDAN-SCENE, JORDAN-CLINTON,
JORDAN-PALESTINIANS) 
(fe) 
 By DOUGLAS JEHL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMMAN, Jordan _ United in loss and grief, an extraordinary array
of presidents, prime ministers and princes gathered here on Monday
to accompany King Hussein on his final journey, as his body was
buried in a humble white shroud.
</P>
<P>
   The mourners included Jordan's allies and some who remain bitter
foes, including the leaders of Syria and Israel. That turnout paid
tribute in death to a king who in life, over nearly a
half-century's reign, had sought to mend even the most rancorous of
disputes.
</P>
<P>
   ``God, make him among the people who rest in paradise,'' an imam
prayed at the graveside, as the newly crowned King Abdullah, the
late king's eldest son, stood cloudy-eyed but ramrod straight, at
the head of the funeral proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with Muslim tradition, there were no eulogies, no
songs and no speeches during the male-only ceremonies, as the
king's body was driven through the chilly streets of Amman on
Monday and then was borne on a gun carriage to his grave. But even
without speeches, the spectacle was nonetheless remarkable.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, the scene in Jordan was an eerie echo of Jan. 19,
the day when Hussein returned to Jordan after six months of cancer
treatment in the United States. He had pronounced himself ``fully
recovered,'' and tens of thousands of Jordanians lined the streets
and slaughtered sheep to welcome him home.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the crowds were about the same size _ hundreds of
thousands of people pouring out their sorrow. But instead of
banners, they clutched black flags of mourning. Those who succeeded
in surging through police lines to chase after the motorcade could
hope not to touch a king, but only his coffin. In a courtyard of
Raghadan Palace, so many leaders _ representing 75 countries _
flocked to Jordan to pay their respects that they ended up
shoulder-to-shoulder, dark suits abutting Arab robes.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, where the late king lay in state, surrounded by four
Circassian guards, they entered the room one by one to pause before
his coffin _ Muslims, Christians, Jews, each according to his
traditions. The dignitaries included President Clinton and three
former American presidents, who inclined their heads in prayer;
Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, who bid farewell with a slow
bow and a military salute; and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of
Israel, at the head of a delegation that included Israel's chief
rabbis.
</P>
<P>
   There were surprise guests at the funeral: President Boris
Yeltsin of Russia, frail and seemingly disoriented, having left
from his own sickbed for the occasion; and President Hafez Assad of
Syria, a critic of Jordan's peace with Israel, who had never before
attended an event at which Israeli officials were present.
</P>
<P>
   There was no sign on Monday that Assad's attendance marked a new
approach to Middle East peace. He seemed determined to avoid
contact with the Israelis, and their delegations were separated by
many minutes at any events at which their paths might have crossed.
Assad chose not to join the other leaders who followed in a foot
procession as the late king's body was carried from the palace, to
the strains of bagpipes played by Arab Legionnaires, and followed
by a riderless stallion.
</P>
<P>
   But even as so many others bade farewell to the late king, Assad
did seem intent on making a personal peace despite his bitter
political differences with Hussein over Israel. As he stood before
the coffin, he held out his palms and whispered words of prayer and
then raised his hands to his face, in a pious Muslim gesture of
mourning.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu said later: ``We all admired him deeply.'' His country
fought wars with Jordan in 1948 and 1967 before making peace in
1994.
</P>
<P>
   Arab Muslim tradition calls for funerals to be segregated by
sex, so for most of the day, the king's widow, Queen Noor; his
sister, Princess Basma; and his six daughters, by four wives, were
nowhere in sight. They were seen only as the day began, at the door
of the family home, Beb al-Salam, wearing white head scarves of
mourning.
</P>
<P>
   King Abdullah, Crown Prince Hamzah and their three other
brothers bade the women farewell at the family home and left for
the proceedings, each wearing a dark suit and a bright red
kaffiyeh.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   From the streets to the palaces, the gestures on Monday were of
gratitude and respect for Hussein, whose long service and
commitment to peace may have made him better known than the small
country he ruled for more than 46 years. Many people also clearly
offered their hands in support to Abdullah, who is just 37, and may
well have a difficult time stepping into his father's shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Saudi Arabia, which, after the Persian Gulf war in 1991, turned
a cold shoulder to Jordan as punishment for its tilt toward Iraq,
was represented here on Monday by Crown Prince Abdullah, the
country's effective leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jordan has always been dear to us, and now Jordan will be
dearer and dearer,'' the Saudi crown prince said. A statement
issued by the Saudi cabinet in Riyadh asserted that ``Saudi Arabia
stands by Jordan in these critical times.''
</P>
<P>
   For 90 minutes after the funeral, the new king and his brothers,
including the new crown prince, Hamzah, stood to accept handshakes
and kisses from visitors, who represented all manner of political
stripes. These ranged from Prince Charles, the buttoned-down heir
to the British throne, to Omar al-Bashir, the turban-clad president
of Sudan, a country ostracized by the West for its alleged support
of terrorism and the target last summer of an American
cruise-missile attack.
</P>
<P>
   Not since the funeral of the slain Israeli prime minister,
Yitzhak Rabin, in November 1995, has the world seen a gathering of
leaders that even approached Monday's, either in diversity or
emotion. And by almost any measure, Monday's was more remarkable,
because it seemed to bridge so many divides.
</P>
<P>
   The guests included both Khaled Meshal, a leader of the militant
Islamic group Hamas who was the target of a 1997 assassination
attempt in Amman, and Efraim Halevy, director of the Israeli
intelligence service Mossad, the agency that carried out the
bungled attack.
</P>
<P>
   An Iraqi vice president, Taha Moheiddin Maruf, was welcomed to
Jordan, even though his country's leader, President Saddam Hussein,
lashed out last month at those he called ``throne dwarves'' _ a
clear reference to Hussein's short stature.
</P>
<P>
   Nayef Hawatmeh, the leader of a radical Palestinian group that
rejects peace with Israel, managed to greet and shake hands with
Israel's president, Ezer Weizman, prompting immediate protests from
Israeli conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Israeli delegation itself spanned a spectrum so wide
that, though united for a day in admiration of the late king, most
gave the impression that they would have preferred not to be in the
same room. The group included Ehud Barak, the Labor leader, who is
Netanyahu's chief rival for prime minister in elections that are to
take place in May; Yitzhak Mordechai, who until last month was
Netanyahu's defense minister and is now another election rival; and
two former prime ministers, Shimon Peres and Yitzhak Shamir, who in
the world of Israeli politics occupy very different poles.
</P>
<P>
   From the United States, the delegation headed by Clinton
included the former presidents George Bush, Jimmy Carter and Gerald
Ford, who had ties of varying warmth with Hussein. It was a
bipartisan tribute to the late king, whose political and financial
ties to the United States began decades ago, and who, in his final
years as the monarch, became a trusted ally of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was said to have exchanged greetings with a number of
leaders, including Assad; Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain;
President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt; and the representatives of
Turkey, Kuwait and many other countries.
</P>
<P>
   But the Americans kept a pointed distance from the vice
president from Iraq as well as another controversial guest _ the
son of the Libyan leader, Moammar Gadhafi, whose name is Saadi. He
had to fly to Jordan from Tunisia because U.N. sanctions bar
flights to and from his country.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin, the ailing 68-year-old Russian leader, has visited the
Kremlin only three times this year. His decision to travel to
Jordan _ reportedly against the advice of his doctors _ left many
among the delegations taken aback.
</P>
<P>
   Russia, along with the United States, was among the co-sponsors
of a Middle East peace conference in Madrid in 1991, a fact that
Yeltsin may have hoped to impress again on other world leaders. But
Yeltsin could barely take a step without someone holding his arm,
and at one point, he seemed not to know where he was. He left the
palace after paying his respects and did not stay for the funeral
itself.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   If the scene on the street was some times frenzied, the one
inside the palace grounds was elegant in its simplicity. From the
palace, the scene of the last respects, the king's body was carried
to the royal mosque, about 300 yards away, for funeral prayers.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, the body was moved again, to the Hashemite family
gravesite, and a site adjoining the tombs that house the late
king's grandfather, King Abdullah, and his father, King Talal.
</P>
<P>
   The body had already been washed in accord with Islamic
practice, scented with musk and wrapped in the white shroud. It was
removed from the casket and slowly lowered into the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Abdullah stood in silent tribute to his father for three minutes
before flagstones were lowered over the grave, the Last Post was
sounded, and Bedouin guards fired a 15-gun salute.

ELECTRONIC TOLLS PICK UP SPEED  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 14) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By BETSY WADE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's nothing more annoying than waiting in line, unless it's
waiting in line to pay a toll,'' said Kimberlee Poulton,
spokeswoman for the Florida Department of Transportation, operator
of Florida's Turnpike and other toll roads.
</P>
<P>
   Driving this turnpike its entire 314 miles from Wildwood,
northwest of Orlando, to Florida City in the southeast costs $16.65
in tolls, mostly in 25- and 50-cent bites. Last month, Ms. Poulton
said, the agency began testing Sunpass, an electronic toll-paying
device, on windshields of 5,000 cars using part of this road. By
the summer of 2000, the state hopes to have electronic readers on
all toll roads.
</P>
<P>
   Toll-taking probably predates coins: Herd your flock across my
land, give me a sheep. Comes now the postcoin era: Drive over the
bridge and our zapper will bill you. State and interstate agencies
are moving this way. Florida, New York, Oklahoma, New Jersey,
Pennsylvania, Delaware, Massachusetts, Georgia, Illinois,
Louisiana, Colorado, California and others have electronic systems
either in place or in the works. Not all are compatible with those
of neighboring states, but some are working on a seamless system.
</P>
<P>
   Electronic systems are demonstrably faster: According to the
Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which uses the E-Z Pass
at its six interstate crossings, a human can collect tolls from 350
cars an hour; the electronic scanner can process up to 1,000 an
hour.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, the New York Metropolitan Transportation Authority
had its smoothest Thanksgiving Day ever on the Bronx-Whitestone
Bridge, according to Frank Pascual, the agency spokesman: On a
holiday where delays of an hour in toll plazas have been common, he
said, traffic was held up only a minute or so in the morning, and
no more than 10 minutes in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The big change was the E-Z Pass. Pascual says his agency is the
largest electronic toll collector in the world, with 1.5 million
E-Z Passes going through its nine bridges and tunnels. He said the
passes were used by 68 percent of cars using these crossings on
weekdays and 58 percent on weekends.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the speed, the electronic pass in some cases is cheaper:
The Port Authority and the Bridges and Tunnels Division of the New
York Metropolitan Transportation Authority, among others, provide
discounts to electronic toll-payers. It also reduces petty
annoyances: No need to fumble with cash, drive a precise distance
from the collection window or wait for a receipt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Truckers think Pikepasses are better than sliced bread,'' Jim
Beach, a spokesman for the Oklahoma Turnpike Authority, said of
that state's version. Thirty-eight percent of commercial vehicles
on the 10 state toll roads use them. Some of these roads have no
collection gates at all, only sensors on poles that read the
electronic gadgets, or transponders, as vehicles whip by at 75
miles an hour, the legal limit.
</P>
<P>
   While technophobes and others who fear state intrusion into
their lives may stay forever in the slower lane, MTA figures
indicate that New York area commuters grasp the lesson upon seeing
cars backed up in the cash lane. The agency reports it is still
sending out 7,000 transponders a week.
</P>
<P>
   This means the bulk of ``others'' are those who have come a long
distance to get to New York and are now trapped in the cash lane on
the Henry Hudson Bridge or the Lincoln Tunnel, and those in taxis
traveling over a bridge or through a tunnel, probably to get to an
airport.
</P>
<P>
   In both areas, help is on the way.
</P>
<P>
   All the E-Z Pass agencies in the Northeast say the goal is a
seamless journey: ``One tag, one account.'' This requires
compatible technology: The Florida Sunpass, for example, will not
work in New York, nor will the E-Z Pass in Florida. But the 12
agencies in the E-Z Pass Interagency Group, which come from six
Northeast states _ New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware,
Maryland and Massachusetts _ have set mid-2000 as the time to have
all their toll roads electronic.
</P>
<P>
   The E-Z Pass came to life in 1993 on the New York State
Thruway's Tappan Zee Bridge after an arbitrator rejected an appeal
by toll-takers worried about their safety. A five-mile speed limit
was set in the plaza. The pass is now in use all along the New York
Thruway; on Hudson River crossings; on toll-charging water
crossings into New York City; on the Atlantic City Expressway; on
I-95 in Delaware; on the Massachusetts Turnpike Extension east of
Route 128 around Boston, and in the two Boston Harbor tunnels.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Last month Delaware increased tolls on I-95, to $2 from $1.25.
But the E-Z Pass toll, by legislative act, remains at $1.25,
according to Michelle Ackles, a spokeswoman for the State
Transportation Department.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts Turnpike Authority, according to James J.
Kerasiotes, the chairman, expects to have the rest of the turnpike
collecting electronic tolls by late June. The transponder is the
same one used in New York, the Mark IV made in Amherst, N.Y., but
it is called the Fastlane there.
</P>
<P>
   In Maryland, compatible electronic readers are being installed
on bridges. The New Jersey Turnpike Authority and the Garden State
Parkway have set completion dates for 2000 but are grappling with
difficulties in meeting the deadlines.
</P>
<P>
   But beyond Massachusetts, there's Maine, which has put in
noncompatible technology. Rena Barta, program director of the
Interagency Group, said that right now the group was concentrating
on ``intraoperability'' among its own members. But Lynn J. Fleeger
of the New Jersey Turnpike Authority, spokeswoman for the group,
said it had ``heard from'' Virginia and New Brunswick, Canada,
about possibly joining.
</P>
<P>
   If Virginia came in, the squeeze would eventually be on the
bistate authority that operates the Delaware Memorial Bridge, which
connects the New Jersey Turnpike to Delaware.
</P>
<P>
   A special case is posed by those who ride in New York City's
12,187 medallion taxis. Yellow cab fleet owners have had no way to
keep track of how many tolls were paid electronically each day or
which cabbie was on duty at the time.
</P>
<P>
   The city's taxi and limousine commissioner, Diane McGrath
McKechnie, said passengers in hired cars had voiced such distaste
for the cash lane that almost all owners of private livery cars had
installed E-Z Pass devices.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McKechnie said that talks were soon to resume with the MTA
about modifying the recording system to help taxi fleet owners get
the daily accounting of tolls paid that they need. She said the
matter should be cleared up this year.
</P>
<P>
   Some people carry Mark IV transponders with them to hold up at
the windshield so the taxi, rental car or friend's car can use the
E-Z Pass lane. If you use a credit card to get it and keep $25 in
your account to pay tolls with, the gadget is free, just as it is
for car-owners who meet the same criteria.
</P>
<P>
   The number to get an E-Z Pass is (800) 333-8655. If the
expectation of Neil Schuster, executive director of the
International Bridge, Tunnel and Turnpike Association, is correct,
you may one day be able to charge your McDonald's fajita on the
turnpike to your E-Z Pass.

<TEXT>
<P>
   John Kovarik got a rude shock one day last year when he went to
his pharmacy to fill a prescription: His insurance company refused
to pay for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was flabbergasted,'' said Kovarik, a lawyer in South Palm
Beach, Fla., with a life-threatening genetic disorder known as
Wilson's disease. To fight its symptoms, Kovarik needs an effective
treatment to keep copper from accumulating in his body and
destroying his vital organs.
</P>
<P>
   He had been taking a drug that could have caused irreversible
and sometimes lethal side effects. So, Kovarik said, he negotiated
the maze of his health maintenance organization to find a doctor
who would prescribe a newer and safer drug, Galzin.
</P>
<P>
   But when his insurance company, Humana Inc., refused to pay for
Galzin, Kovarik angrily called the company from the pharmacy
counter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was telling them that I have this life-threatening
disease,'' Kovarik said, ``and that this drug is life sustaining. I
told them that the drug I was using was having deleterious side
effects. I told them that Galzin is FDA approved.'' Later, he wrote
letter after letter, to no avail.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that Galzin is zinc acetate, and zinc acetate is
sold both as a prescription drug and over the counter as a food
supplement. The supplement and the drug are supposed to be the
same, but the supplement is not licensed by the Food and Drug
Administration, so its manufacture is not regulated and there is no
guarantee that the dose on the package is correct.
</P>
<P>
   Humana questioned why it should pay for a prescription drug when
the supplement was available. A month's supply of Galzin costs $95,
Kovarik said. If he bought the supplement, it would cost $10 to
$15, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not cover nutritional supplements,'' said Valerie
Kennedy, a Humana spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   But cost is not the crucial issue, said officials at Teva
Pharmaceuticals U.S.A. of Sellersville, Pa., which makes Galzin.
``The real issue here is the safety of the patient,'' said Dr.
Carole Ben-Maimon, a senior vice president. ``The patients taking a
prescription product know what they are getting and how it was
made.''
</P>
<P>
   A product can be a drug if a company tests it for safety and
efficacy, receives approval from the FDA and makes the product
according to federal standards. But many of the same products can
be sold as supplements if they do not make drug claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``The boundary between food and drugs is by no means clear and
sharp,'' said Dr. John Hathcock, the director of nutritional and
regulatory science for the Council for Responsible Nutrition, which
represents the supplement industry. ``It is perfectly legal and, I
believe, also legitimate for some products to be on the market both
as supplements and drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Patients who need products to treat diseases can take the drugs
if their doctors prescribe them, Hathcock said, others can buy the
supplements.
</P>
<P>
   But patients, their advocates and companies that try to sell
drugs like zinc acetate say it is not that simple. Because a
substance sold as a supplement is not regulated by the FDA, there
is no guarantee that it will contain the product on its label or
that the dosage stated on the label is accurate.
</P>
<P>
   Although only a few products are sold as both drugs and
supplements, some are vital to patients, especially those with rare
disorders who must take them regularly and in fixed amounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big problem,'' said Abbey Meyers, the executive
director of the National Organization for Rare Disorders, an
advocacy group based in Fairfield, Conn. ``If your life depends on
one of these products, you can't take a chance on buying an
over-the-counter supplement that may contain no ingredient or half
the ingredient or two or three times more of the ingredient.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Meyers said her group financed a study in which Duke
University scientists analyzed over-the-counter L-carnitine
supplements from a variety of companies. They found that doses
varied markedly, even in pills coming from the same bottle, with
some pills containing no carnitine, others containing more than the
label specified and most providing less than 60 percent of the dose
promised on the label.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, said Lynn McHenry Morgan of Concord, Calif., when she
changed insurance companies last February, her new insurer, Blue
Shield, told her it would not pay for prescription L-carnitine for
her two children, who need the drug to treat a rare and
debilitating disorder involving the mitochondria, which provide
energy to cells.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Morgan said she lobbied Blue Shield for three months before
the company agreed to pay.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Nancy Stalker, the director of pharmacy services at Blue
Shield of California, said the company wanted patients to get the
care they needed, but had a policy restricting payments for drugs
that also were nutritional supplements.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors who treat patients in similar circumstances say they
often end up imploring insurance companies to pay for the
prescription drugs. Dr. Susan Winters, a geneticist who treats
children with rare metabolic disorders, said she aggressively
fought for insurance coverage for drugs like L-carnitine, but said
she did not always win.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Meyers said that drug companies realized that testing a drug
and getting the FDA's approval to market it might not be worthwhile
if the drug could also be sold as a supplement. With zinc acetate,
she said, her group actively sought a company to sell the product
as a drug. ``Nobody would do it,'' Ms. Meyers said. ``Who wants to
put the money into making a pharmaceutical grade zinc when you can
buy zinc over the counter?'' Finally, she said, Teva agreed to do
it.
</P>
<P>
   But the situation can be different when a drug is not urgently
needed for patients with an otherwise lethal disease. Dr. Richard
J. Wurtman, a co-founder of Interneuron, a small drug company, in
Lexington, Mass., was convinced that melatonin worked as a sleeping
pill if the dose was correct. He wanted to test and market it as a
drug. But when he urged this course on his company, he said, he was
met with `` absolutely zero interest.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is convincing a company in this country to invest
the tens of millions of dollars to get the drug on the market and
then have it come out and compete with a supplement,'' Wurtman
said. ``As long as something is available as a dietary supplement,
no company will invest in it.''
</P>
<P>
   And so Interneuron joined the supplement makers. It is marketing
melatonin as a supplement that can induce sleep, through a
subsidiary called InterNutria.

SOUTHWEST TEXAS STUDENT, 21, DIES IN BEATING 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ALLAN TURNER 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A 21-year-old Southwest Texas State University sophomore from
the Houston area died Monday of injuries he suffered in a beating
at a San Marcos fraternity house.
</P>
<P>
   San Marcos police said Nicholas George Armstrong of Baytown was
found unconscious at 3:15 a.m. Sunday in the Tau Kappa Epsilon
house a short distance from the university campus.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong's murder is the first for the Central Texas community
in 1999 and the first death associated with fraternities in at
least 24 years. More than 20,000 students attend Southwest Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Police Chief Steve Griffith said authorities are looking for two
of four men, alleged ``party crashers,'' who had been involved in a
fight at the fraternity house late Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Dean of Students John Garrison said the violence occurred as Tau
Kappa Epsilon and 11 other fraternities that comprise the
Interfraternity Council were holding their acceptance night
festivities. Those parties cap a weeklong alcohol-free ``rush'' or
recruitment period.
</P>
<P>
   The dozen fraternities, some of which were accused of permitting
under-age drinking during the Saturday event, have been suspended,
pending investigation, Garrison said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the groups will be allowed to continue philanthropic
activities, but will not be permitted to recruit members.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the university suspended the Sigma Phi Epsilon
fraternity because of alcohol infractions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're calling a halt to it,'' Jim Studer, vice president for
student affairs, told The Associated Press. ``We have a systemic
problem here, and we have to address it as it is.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a history. We've had problems in the past. We
talked with each of the fraternity presidents (last week) to tell
them to make sure they had things under control.''
</P>
<P>
   Garrison said no alcohol-related problems were reported at Tau
Kappa Epsilon. Fraternity chapter president Jonathan English could
not be reached for comment Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Garrison said university staffers joined by campus police
visited a number of fraternity houses early Sunday to ensure
alcohol policies were being observed.
</P>
<P>
   Garrison said they found one underage student at the local
hospital as a result of drinking; several other students were cited
for underage drinking. About 12:30 a.m., he said, authorities
decided to end the parties.
</P>
<P>
   When they arrived at the Tau Kappa Epsilon house, they were told
that four men, unknown to fraternity members and pledges, had
attempted to crash the party. When they were asked to leave, a
fight broke out and police were called.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong reportedly was not involved in that altercation.
Garrison said after officers left, the student went to sleep on a
sofa. Few if any fraternity members reside in the building full
time, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Officers responding to the second call at 3:15 a.m. found
Armstrong badly beaten on the head. An unidentified witness told
police he had seen two of the earlier intruders in the building
about 15 minutes before Armstrong was found.
</P>
<P>
   The suspects were described as being about 18 years old. One was
about 5-feet-8, weighing about 170 pounds. He had a shaved head,
dark eyes and a severe stutter. The second man was described as
being about 6-feet. He was clean-shaven and had blond hair.
</P>
<P>
   Griffith said officers are interested in reviewing videotapes or
photographs made during the party.

NEW KOSOVO TALKS A EUROPEAN PRODUCTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Last week, Hubert Vedrine, the French foreign minister
known more for his candor than discretion, said that the United
States must stop unilaterally imposing its will on the rest of the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Ensconced at Rambouillet, a chateau 35 miles southwest of Paris,
Vedrine now has the opportunity to put his words into action.
</P>
<P>
   While the framework document for a settlement being circulated
among the warring factions in Kosovo is largely a product of US
envoy Christopher Hill, the ability to sell the settlement and then
police it will be primarily a European challenge.
</P>
<P>
   The peace talks at Rambouillet are fundamentally different from
those that ended the war in Bosnia in 1995, not simply because the
French chateau is as luxurious as the US air base in Dayton, Ohio,
was spartan. While the Dayton peace deal was led primarily by
Americans, the initiative to end the war in Kosovo is being driven
by the Europeans _ a change that US officials find pleasing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If what Vedrine was saying is that Europeans should take more
responsibility for problems in their own back yard, I don't think
we're going to have a problem with that,'' an American diplomat
said on Saturday, hours before the talks began.
</P>
<P>
   Since the end of World War II, when American troops and money
led the reconstruction of Europe, Washington has refused to allow
US troops to serve under the command of European generals. But the
White House has signaled it is prepared to end this rule to keep
the US troop commitment in Kosovo to a minimum.
</P>
<P>
   If mediators, including Hill, are able to persuade ethnic
Albanian and Serb negotiators to allow Kosovo limited autonomy
while keeping the province part of Serbia, the Europeans will then
have primary responsibility to implement the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Britain and France, who are sponsoring the talks at Rambouillet,
would provide the bulk of the 30,000-member peacekeeping force sent
into Kosovo if a deal is reached. German troops would also be
deployed there, marking the first time since the end of World War
II that they have been stationed beyond their borders. American
involvement would be minimal _ between 2,000 and 4,000 troops _
compared with some 8,000 British soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Vedrine has not been alone in his blunt calls for new limits on
American power. For the last few months, Jacques Chirac, the
conservative French president, and Lionel Jospin, the socialist
French prime minister, have complained that the United States has
become more than a superpower.
</P>
<P>
   Vedrine describes the United States as a ``hyperpower,''
dominating the world economically, militarily, and culturally. As
bad as the Cold War was, the French say, the emergence of a
hyperpower could be worse, as America arrogantly imposes its
self-interest on the rest of the globe.
</P>
<P>
   But Europeans are divided on the merits of Vedrine's campaign to
dilute American power. While many of his counterparts elsewhere on
the continent agree that Americans can be arrogant, some think
Vedrine has gone too far.
</P>
<P>
   Joschka Fischer, the German foreign minister who as the former
leader of the Green Party has been sharply critical of American
positions on nuclear power, environmental protection, and the
military, took issue with the French. Fischer said that if American
unilateralism exists, it does so because Europeans have been
reluctant to assume responsibility for their own region.
</P>
<P>
   Dominique Moisi, deputy director of the French Institute for
International Relations, considers anti-Americanism in Europe to be
part of an inferiority complex. He believes the new single European
currency and the pledge by France and Britain to forge a united
defense policy will lead to a more confident Europe, which will be
good for all concerned.
</P>
<P>
   The talks at Rambouillet present Europeans with the opportunity
to assert themselves against the Americans. If a deal is reached,
Europeans will for the first time lead Americans and prove to the
rest of the world that the European Union is an entity of
substance.

FUNERAL A CHANCE FOR CLINTON TO MAKE POLICY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMMAN, Jordan _ Surrounded by three of his White House
predecessors, President Clinton bade farewell Monday to King
Hussein, praising the world leader for his ability to bring sworn
enemies together.
</P>
<P>
   The funeral created a rare opportunity for Clinton to spend some
time with the former presidents.
</P>
<P>
   As former Presidents George Bush, Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter
shared the stage in a hotel ballroom, Clinton said, ``Here we are,
two Democrats, two Republicans. We've agreed on many things, we've
disagreed on a thing or two over time. But we know that America's
interest and America's heart were close to this king and this
country.''
</P>
<P>
   The four presidents flew here together on Air Force One, with
Clinton coming back into their cabin for 2 1/2 hours to discuss
foreign policy in the Middle East, Kosovo and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   They were close to one another Monday, standing in line outside
Raghadan Palace, waiting to pay their respects. Once inside, they
paused in front of Hussein's flag-drapped casket and bowed their
heads almost in unison.
</P>
<P>
   After the funeral, the four, joined by Hillary Rodham Clinton
and four members of Congress, addressed a group of Jordanian and US
Embassy officials at a hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Recalling the funeral, Clinton said, ``Hussein really did bring
people together.'' He said he could ``hardly believe my eyes'' when
he looked up and saw the Israeli delegation.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the candidates for prime minister were there. They were
all walking together. I don't know if they talk at home, but they
were all talking here,'' Clinton said with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, it was as if Hussein was hugging them all, you
know? Clinton recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein's rule began in 1952, when Harry Truman was president,
had he has known US presidents since Dwight D. Eisenhower.
</P>
<P>
   Former Secretary of State James A. Baker III, in his 1995 book,
``The Politics of Diplomacy,'' wrote that Bush's relationship with
Hussein was strained when Hussein became the only major Arab leader
who sided with Iraq during the Persian Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
   Baker wrote that Bush viewed Hussein's behavior then as a
``personal betrayal.'' When Hussein came to the United States to
mend fences after the war, Bush kept him waiting more than three
hours, then saw him only briefly.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Bush did not speak of his personal feelings about
Hussein. Instead, he kept his comments more general, mentioning the
``outpouring of affection in our country for your king.''
</P>
<P>
   Hussein had forged the closest bond with Clinton. The two talked
frequently by phone. They visited a few weeks ago when Hussein and
his wife, Queen Noor, were in the United States for the king's
cancer treatment at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton, who met with the queen Monday at the palace, said
the friendship ``between our families on a personal level and
between our countries is very, very deep.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton recounted his conversation with Hussein last fall when
he asked him to jump-start the stalled Israeli-Palestinian peace
talks at the Wye Plantation in Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein, who was frail and ailing, told Clinton, ``I would be
willing to come down there if you think it would help,'' the
president said, quoting Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said if I think it would help? This whole thing is about to
come apart; of course it would help. I said, if you come down, they
won't have the courage to walk away here without an agreement. And
so he did,'' recalled Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   In the emotional White House celebration that followed the Wye
accord, Hussein told Clinton that of all the presidents he has
known ``on the subject of peace, the peace we are seeking, I have
never _ with all due respect and all the affection that I held for
your predecessors _ have known someone with your dedication,
clear-headedness, focus and determination to help resolve this
issue in the best possible way.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. President,'' Hussein continued, ``permit me to say what I
feel _ I was mentioning it more than once in the last few days. You
have the tolerance and the patience of Job, and you are the subject
of our admiration and respect.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hussein not only helped Clinton move along the Wye accord
peace process, he also was boosting the presidency as the House
Judiciary Committee was moving to adopt articles of impeachment
against Clinton, and the November congressional elections were just
weeks away.
</P>
<P>
   And so it was Monday. Hussein's funeral fell on the day the
Senate heard closing arguments in the president's impeachment
trial. Two senators, Patrick J. Leahy, a Democrat of Vermont and
Ted Stevens, a Republican of Alaska, joined Clinton for the
funeral.
</P>
<P>
   Leahy told reporters that sitting on Air Force One exchanging
rememberances about Hussein was better than sitting in the
impeachment trial. ``I was so tired of that trial,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton met briefly with about 50 heads of state who traveled
here for the funeral. National Security Adviser Samuel R. Berger
quoted Clinton as saying the delegations represented ``the
kaleidoscope of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   When Russian President Boris Yeltsin saw Clinton enter a room in
the palace, he said in a loud, booming voice, ``Bill Clinton!''
according to Berger.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also met for 25 minutes with King Abdullah, the
37-year-old son of Hussein and his successor. ``He clearly
understands his mission,'' Clinton said afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said in the most moving way. . . . `I and all of my
brothers and sisters have absorbed our father's teaching. We know
what we are supposed to do, and I intend to do it,' '' Clinton
said. ``And he said it in a way that exuded the quiet, humble
confidence that I saw so often in his father.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton left no doubt that he would always treasure his
relationship with Hussein: ``He made us all a little better, and he
always will.''

GEORGIA LEGISLATORS APPROVE BILL TO BLOCK SUITS AGAINST GUN MAKERS
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: La., Fla., Ill., Conn.)   (fe) 
 By DAVID FIRESTONE 
c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Gun manufacturers and their supporters began a long
and expensive counterattack on Monday on the growing number of
lawsuits that cities are filing against the gun industry by
successfully pushing the Georgia Senate to pass the first bill in
the nation intended to block such suits.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's governor, Roy Barnes, who was endorsed by the National
Rifle Association in his recent campaign, is expected to sign the
bill this week, which was passed by the House late last month and
moved through the Legislature at high velocity. Although Atlanta
joined other cities across the country by filing suit against the
gun industry in state court last Thursday, the bill contains
language that would explicitly quash all pending gun litigation by
Georgia cities, as well as any in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Pro-gun lobbyists were delighted at the strong show of support,
saying the Georgia effort marks the beginning of a campaign against
city gun lawsuits that gun makers and the NRA intend to fight in
dozens of state capitals. With their conservative traditions and
easy access for lobbyists, statehouses have traditionally been the
stronghold of the industry, with nearly 40 states, including
Georgia, already having laws that prohibit their cities from
enacting any form of gun control.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the beginning of a long, arduous process that we wish
we didn't have to engage in, but we are going to devote a lot of
time and resources to it,'' said James Baker, director of the NRA's
lobbying arm, the Institute for Legislative Action. ``In the next
year, I think we can probably get 25 or 30 more states to do the
same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The next stop, he said, is Louisiana, where the organization
plans to have a bill filed the first day the state Legislature
opens in March.
</P>
<P>
   New Orleans was the first of several cities to file lawsuits
against the gun industry, seeking millions of dollars to reimburse
local treasuries for the cost of the police and hospital services
required because of gun violence. Other cities that filed such
suits include Miami, Chicago and Bridgeport, Conn., and many others
are preparing or contemplating such litigation, modeled after
similar successful efforts against the tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's suit, brought against 14 manufacturers and three trade
groups, accuses the companies of failing to install safety devices
or provide adequate warnings of the dangers of guns. It seeks
unspecified damages to compensate the city for the cost of mopping
up after gun violence. Mayor Bill Campbell, who has championed the
suit in defiance of the Legislature, vowed on Monday to fight the
industry's bill on constitutional grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Having watched the tobacco industry first fight and then
eventually settle liability lawsuits around the country, the
far-less-prosperous gun industry has vowed not to let the same
thing happen to its members. But without many friends in the White
House or in city halls, the firearms lobby is concentrating on
statehouses like the one here, targeting legislators who have used
NRA endorsements as badges of anti-crime toughness. With about
90,000 active members in the state, the NRA contributes heavily to
Georgia politicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``This goes back to when I was driving in my car back in
December, and I heard something on the radio about the Chicago
suit,'' said state Rep. Curtis Jenkins, a Democrat from rural
Forsythe, who introduced the bill. ``It crossed my mind that
Atlanta might look at this, and I had a talk with the NRA, which
has been a great help with this bill. They had all kinds of
suggestions as we were drafting it.''
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins and other legislative leaders said lawmakers voted for
the bill because they believe the lawsuits are a backdoor form of
gun control, trying to restrict access to guns by putting gun
manufacturers out of business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Georgia is a strong Second Amendment state,'' said Sen. Eric
Johnson, the Republican minority leader from Savannah. ``People
here see any attempt to sue gun manufacturers as an attempt to
restrict the citizen's right to keep and bear arms.'' Both houses
passed the bills with strong bipartisan majorities, the Senate
voting 44-11, the House 146-25. Barnes has not commented publicly
on the bill, but legislative leaders said they have been assured by
his office that he will sign it.
</P>
<P>
   Many lawmakers were particularly annoyed that Atlanta filed its
suit while the gun industry's largest trade show, known as the Shot
Show, was entertaining 30,000 visitors at the Georgia World
Congress Center here. The industry has pulled next year's show out
of New Orleans because of that city's suit.
</P>
<P>
   Baker, the NRA lobbyist, said he knew there are many states,
including Illinois, where the lobby will not be nearly as
successful. But by undermining lawsuits in friendly states like
Georgia and Louisiana, he said, the industry will be able to narrow
the playing field and concentrate on the 20 or so states posing the
greatest threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're trying to prove that the firearms industry is
responsible for the criminal misuse of firearms,'' he said. ``It's
ludicrous _ totally outside the realm of existing product liability
law. They're trying to do with the court system what they've been
unable to do with state legislatures.''
</P>
<P>
   Anti-gun lobbyists say the NRA will probably be successful in
several state capitals but predicted that enough city lawsuits
would go forward unimpeded to keep the industry busy in court. Many
of the cities that have filed suit are being guided by a group of
the same private lawyers who brought the original suit against the
tobacco companies, and the lawyers say they are ready for the NRA.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be working with cities to fight these bills on
constitutional grounds,'' said Daniel Abel, a partner in the New
Orleans firm of Gauthier, Downing, LaBarre, Beiser &AMP; Dean, which
helped originate the tobacco litigation and drafted New Orleans'
suit against the gun industry. ``These bills violate the right to
self-determination of a city, many of which have home-rule
charters. You'll be seeing a lot of constitutional scholars come
out and address this issue.''

CLINTON'S IMPEACHMENT TRIAL HEADS TOWARD SECRET DELIBERATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL, JUDY HOLLAND And JENNIFER CORBETT DOOREN   
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate impeachment trial of President Clinton
headed Monday toward secret deliberations and an expected vote for
acquittal that left Senate Democrats scrambling for a way to
censure the chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Many Senate Democrats, led by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif.,
have been working to craft a bipartisan censure resolution to
condemn Clinton's conduct in part to offset the political
repercussions of their expected votes to acquit the president on
two articles of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   However, some Republicans oppose the censure effort, contending
that the Constitution only gives the Senate two choices _ acquit
the president or convict and remove him from office.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of a GOP filibuster against censure threatens to
keep the censure issue alive long past the week-long congressional
recess that starts this weekend..
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Republican House prosecutors made their final,
sometimes impassioned appeals to the Senate to convict and remove
Clinton from office for perjury and obstruction of justice for a
13-month sex-and-cover-up scandal involving former White House
intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., urging senators not to be
``fooled by the president's excuses and spin control,'' warned that
the impact would be ``felt for generations to come'' if the
president evaded the consequences of his actions.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., urged the senators to disregard national
public opinion polls showing Clinton's high popularity. ``Your
duty, which I know you recognize today, is and must be based not on
polls or politics, but on law and the Constitution _ in other
words, on principle,'' Barr said.
</P>
<P>
   White House counsel Charles Ruff countered demands for Clinton's
ouster by acknowledging ``the pain the president has caused'' the
nation, but insisting that Clinton's transgressions fall short of
the threshold for impeachable offenses.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans have focused on ``retribution,'' with a case
built to ``achieve partisan ends'' rather than serving the needs of
the nation, Ruff said.
</P>
<P>
   House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill., leader of
the 13 House prosecutors, had the last word. Noting that the nation
was ``blessedly coming to the end of this melancholy procedure,''
Hyde appealed to the Senate to convict and remove a popularly
elected president for the first time in American history rather
than acquit and turn to a resolution of censure.
</P>
<P>
   ``And now let us all take our place in history on the side of
honor and, oh yes, let right be done!'' Hyde implored.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde had earlier conceded the likely failure of House
Republicans garnering the 67 Senate votes needed to convict and
remove the chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always am hopeful that logic, the facts, the law will change
people's minds,'' Hyde said somewhat ruefully. ``I think you have
to wait until the Fat Lady sings.''
</P>
<P>
   Senators said they expected the Senate to reject a proposal on
Tuesday to open up the final deliberations to public scrutiny. Sen.
Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, said that she had only about 60 of
the 67 votes needed to overturn Senate rules to permit public
debate.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., agreed: ``It's certainly still uphill.''
said
</P>
<P>
   Plans called for the 100 senators to meet behind closed doors
Tuesday and Wednesday, with each to speak for between 10 minutes
and 15 minutes before casting their votes on the two articles of
impeachment in public session as early as Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Senators seeking Senate action on a post-trial resolution of
censure condemning Clinton's conduct also were encountering
problems.
</P>
<P>
   If the impeachment trial ends Thursday or Friday as expected,
backers of censure will not have enough time to bring the
resolution up before the Senate recesses for a week.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., said the threat of a
filibuster by Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, to block Senate action on a
censure resolution before the Senate's scheduled recess may force
Senate Democrats to seek to attach the censure resolution to
legislation in the months ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our view is that the sooner we can get this done, the
better,'' Daschle said. ``Our preference would be to get it done
this week, but if that isn't to be, we will certainly get it done
this spring.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., warned that if a censure
resolution was not adopted later this week, it probably would not
happen because there is so much legislative action ``waiting in the
wings.''
</P>
<P>
   Echoed Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J.: ``The way to censure is a
really difficult trail.''

<P>
   House prosecutors, who had once weighed asking the Senate to
hear live testimony from as many as eight witnesses, tried once
again to expand the scope of the trial to admit sworn testimony
from journalist Christopher Hitchens, his wife Carol Blue and
journalist R. Scott Armstrong who have challenged the veracity of
sworn testimony last week by White House staffer Sidney Blumenthal.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde, in a letter to the Senate leadership, said the new
evidence indicated that Blumenthal ``may have testified falsely
before the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republican leader Trent Lott tried to introduce two
affidavits at the outset of Monday's proceedings that sought to
challenge a portion of Blumenthal's testimony. But Daschle, the
Senate Democratic leader, blocked Lott's effort.

OCTUPLETS FATHER GETS PROBATION AFTER PLEADING NO CONTEST IN
ATTACK 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE BREWER 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The father of the seven surviving Houston octuplets
was placed on two years deferred-adjudication probation Monday and
ordered to undergo a psychological evaluation after pleading no
contest to a charge he attacked his mother-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   Iyke Paul Louis Jr., 42, will have to enroll in whatever kind of
counseling program that is recommended for him and he will also
have to pay the rest of Janet Chukwu's medical bills.
</P>
<P>
   Harris County Criminal Court-at-Law Judge Michael A. Peters did
not fine Louis, who is also known as Iyke Louis Odobi, or order him
to do community service.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your community service is that you be a good father and role
model for those seven children,'' Peters told Louis, who was
flanked by his wife, her mother and his attorney.
</P>
<P>
   As he left court, Louis referred all comment to his lawyer
except to say he was going to see his children in the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   One child was born Dec. 8 and seven others Dec. 20. The smallest
baby died of heart and lung failure a week later. Currently, four
of the babies remain in critical condition and three others have
been upgraded to serious condition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were able to resolve this case without a terrible tragedy
happening in that courtroom, which would have been to line
everybody up against everybody and watch the accusations fly,''
defense attorney Rick Castleberry said.
</P>
<P>
   According to police reports, Louis was arrested early Sept. 22
and charged with misdemeanor assault after officers were called to
his home in Southwest Houston about 11:25 p.m. Sept. 21.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Louis assaulted Janet Chukwu, who lives at the home
with Louis and his then-pregnant wife, Nkem Chukwu, 29.
</P>
<P>
   Louis told police he and his wife were arguing when she began to
nag and pinch him. Janet Chukwu became involved in the argument, he
said, and began hitting and biting him.
</P>
<P>
   Louis told officers he defended himself by hitting and biting
her, then hitting her with a chair.
</P>
<P>
   Janet Chukwu told police a different story.
</P>
<P>
   She said Louis threatened to break his wife's hands and kick
her. When Janet Chukwu told her daughter to get away, Louis got
angry, according to police. Janet Chukwu said he then cracked a
chair over her head and began to beat and bite her.
</P>
<P>
   In court Monday, Janet Chukwu told Peters through an interpreter
that Louis has since apologized and that she was satisfied with
that apology.
</P>
<P>
   Castleberry pointed out later that the apology was ``for the
incident'' and that Louis' plea of no contest did not mean he was
admitting to any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Janet Chukwu still lives with the couple and Peters suggested
the family get counseling together, but he also had a warning for
Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be watching you like a hawk in this case because these
kids need to be raised in a family unit, not in an environment
where you are at odds with each other,'' Peters told Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of deferred adjudication, Louis was not found
guilty and thus will have no felony conviction on his record if he
lives up to the probation terms and stays out of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor Pat McNelis said he agreed to the deal only after
Janet Chukwu approved and only after he felt sure she would be safe
in the home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking he's got seven kids coming into this house and
does not have a prior criminal record and I wanted to consider her
safety and wanted also to consider the needs and safety of his
family,'' McNelis said.
</P>
<P>
   The needs of the family and the demands seven children will
place on the parents were cited as the reasons McNelis agreed not
to ask Peters to impose a fine or community service on Louis.
</P>
<P>
   State law allows Peters to waive such punishments, which are a
usual adjunct to probation, in extraordinary circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   McNelis said he also accepted the deal because Louis' case will
be handled by probation officers who deal with domestic violence
officers. That means he will be under more intense supervision than
the average probationer.
</P>
<P>
   Peters accepted the plea on the day the case was set for trial.
That is also a deviation from his normal policy, but McNelis said
the exception was made because the judge was briefed on the deal
last week.
</P>
<P>
   Also Monday, hospital officials said the first born of the
infants received her first series of immunizations and that two of
the other babies are now completing full bottles at feeding time.

 CHRON - CAR AUCTION  
 Online Auction for Used-Car Dealers  &HT;     By Jamie Beckett 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR; Autobytel.com, the Internet car-buying service for consumers,
plans to enter the online business-to-business market by offering
the first online auctions for used-car dealers.
</P>
<P>
   The Irvine (Orange County) company now operates a Web site,
 &LR; www.autobytel.com,  &LR; that lets consumers get information about car
performance, ratings, features and pricing, then hooks shoppers up
with nearby dealers to make a purchase. It said it will launch a
new site,  &LR; www.wholesale.autobytel.com,  &LR; this spring to be used for
transactions between car wholesalers and the 2,700 car dealers
associated with Autobytel.com.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, these transactions involve at least one middleman.
Autobytel.com said it will let dealers save money by dealing
directly with the wholesalers.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Lorimer, Autobytel.com president and chief executive
officer, said dealers could cut costs by as much as $2,000 on some
transactions by using an online auction.
</P>
<P>
   The company previewed the site at the National Association of
Auto Dealers convention in San Francisco over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Vernon Keenan, a San Francisco Internet analyst, said
wholesalers frequently sell cars via ``real world'' auctions, but
that he didn't know of an Internet car auction other than that to
be offered by Autobytel.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just moving that business to the Internet,'' Keenan
said. ``Autobytel.com is attempting to use the Internet to take the
place of the middleman.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Autobytel.com does most of its business with consumers,
business-to-business e-commerce is actually a much larger market _
nearly 10 times consumer online retail spending, according to
analysts.
</P>
<P>
   The new site will be a sort of car dealer's version of eBay, the
popular online person-to-person auction site, and will offer many
of the same features, including photos of the cars, descriptions
and seller profiles.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Autobytel.com revived plans for an initial stock
offering. The company, formerly known as Auto-by-tel Corp.,
initially planned to go public in January 1997, selling 4 million
shares at between $9.50 and $11 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Now sporting a ``.com'' as part of its name, the company plans
to raise about $72 million by selling 4.5 million shares for an
estimated $16 apiece. The public offering is planned for next
month.

 By   WILLIAM GLABERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ Robert Wideman's part in a 1975 killing might have
been forgotten by now except by the family of a 24-year-old man who
was shot in the back on that November night.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the crime became one of the enduring literary images of
black America, as a subject of an acclaimed 1984 book, ``Brothers &AMP;
Keepers,'' by Mr. Wideman's brother, John Edgar Wideman.
</P>
<P>
   One brother, the author, had escaped the ghetto; the other was
the street tough who embodied the cycle that claims many young
black men. At 25, Robert Wideman was imprisoned for life without
parole after an accomplice fired a fatal shot in a failed street
swindle.
</P>
<P>
   And now Robert Wideman's case is no longer alive only in
literature. Surprisingly, it is alive again in the courts, not only
reopening old wounds here, but also altering a story that has been
portrayed around the world as representative of the fate of black
men in America.
</P>
<P>
   In November, a county court judge, James R. McGregor, ordered a
new trial for Wideman, who has been in prison for 23 years. A
second chance is warranted, the judge ruled, because new evidence
showed that the victim would not have died if he had received
proper medical care after an ambulance took him to a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somewhere I knew,'' Wideman said in a recent long conversation
in the prison visiting room, ``that I was going to make the system
see: `Listen, I am not that bad.' Isn't there a point when you say,
isn't there a second chance?''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because John Wideman's writing made Robert Wideman's
story seem larger than life, the debate set off by McGregor's
ruling has been outsized as well. Angry prosecutors are appealing.
Questions about the effect of race and fame on justice have been
mixed with fury. And McGregor has asserted that politics have been
injected into the case by a heated Democratic primary for district
attorney.
</P>
<P>
   To some residents, the new trial ruling showed that the cycle of
hopelessness born on the streets can be broken. To others, the
decision showed only that infamous people can get special
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``If my son wouldn't have been shot in the back, he wouldn't
have needed that medical care,'' said 68-year old Clara Morena, the
mother of Nichola Morena, who died that night in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, the Allegheny County District Attorney, Stephen
A. Zappala Jr., said McGregor's ruling had been based on ``an
absurd theory.'' Zappala said he would fight to see that Wideman
serves his life sentence. `` `Life' is life,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wideman was convicted in 1976 of second-degree murder. If he is
retried with the new evidence, lawyers say, he could be convicted
of a lesser crime. If so, he would have already served more than
any sentence he could receive, and he would walk free.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Wideman was one of three armed men who told Morena and
two friends that November day long ago that they had 10 television
sets for sale. There were no television sets.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Wideman's supporters have contended without solid
evidence that Morena was a ``fence'' for stolen property who had
been preparing to cheat Wideman and his friends by taking their
television sets and not delivering the $800 they had promised to
pay. Mrs. Morena said she was offended by the accusations.
</P>
<P>
   At the least, the evidence of years ago suggested, Morena and
his associates had reason to suspect that the television sets they
had been offered would not have been from a legitimate source.
McGregor suggested as much in his order granting Wideman a new
trial. ``On Nov. 15, 1975, six men were committing a felony,'' the
judge wrote.
</P>
<P>
   When the two groups confronted each other, Morena ran. According
to trial testimony, Wideman shouted, ``Get him'' or, ``He's getting
away,'' and one of his associates fired.
</P>
<P>
   For the Morena family, a painful fact of the latest turn in the
case is that the family's own lawyers gathered the information that
could free Wideman. In a civil suit in 1981, the family said that
Morena died in part because the hospital emergency room to which he
had been taken had been inadequately supplied and lacked a chest
surgeon.
</P>
<P>
   The suit charged that doctors did not perform standard treatment
for chest injuries and ambulance crews delayed in transferring
Morena to a suitable hospital. Two of the doctors settled the case
for $100,000. Years later, said Mark D. Schwartz, one of Robert
Wideman's lawyers, Wideman learned about that civil case.
Prosecutors have suggested Wideman knew about the civil case much
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, new lawyers for Wideman, financed by his brother,
investigated the Morenas' suit. Last fall, they presented testimony
before McGregor.
</P>
<P>
   One witness who testified for Wideman was the coroner here, Dr.
Cyril H. Wecht. ``He would have lived,'' Wecht said of Morena in an
interview, ``if competent, appropriate, timely medical care had
been rendered to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts on criminal law say McGregor's ruling relies on
established legal principles. But they also say that appeals courts
resist reopening long-closed cases. One factor courts weigh is
whether the delay would unfairly disadvantage prosecutors. In
Wideman's case, the prosecutors say witnesses are gone, memories
hazy and files lost.
</P>
<P>
   Wideman was convicted of murder, even though he did not pull the
trigger, under centuries' old ``felony murder'' rules that say if
someone dies in the commission of a felony, all the participants in
the felony can be responsible for murder.
</P>
<P>
   Wideman's accomplice who fired the fatal shot was also convicted
of murder and is serving a life sentence. He is seeking a new trial
based on the information Wideman's lawyers presented. The third
accomplice, convicted of a lesser degree of homicide, served 20
years and was freed.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Wideman, now 48, said he long ago accepted that his own
bad choices led him to be there when Morena was shot. He said he
was sorry. But he said he was not a killer.
</P>
<P>
   Both Wideman brothers said they had a special understanding of
the loss suffered by Mrs. Morena. Robert Wideman's son was killed
in revenge after a Pittsburgh bar fight. John Wideman has a son who
is serving 25 years to life for stabbing to death a fellow summer
camper when he was a teen-ager.
</P>
<P>
   John Wideman, 58, said their mother, who still lives in
Pittsburgh, had suffered, too. ``If Mrs. Morena carries a burden
because of a lost son,'' he said, ``my mother has lost many sons _
literally and figuratively _ as an African-American mother in
Pittsburgh.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In any murder case, jurors must decide whether the defendants'
actions caused the death, said David Rudovsky, a criminal law
professor at the University of Pennsylvania Law School. He said
that if a shooting causes injury, but something else, like poor
medical care, actually caused death, a jury could conclude the
defendant did not cause the murder.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors say they are confident Pennsylvania appeals
courts will agree that Wideman should not have a new trial. Death,
they say, is one foreseeable consequence of a shot in the back.
``They wanted to murder that man,'' Zappala said. ``They shot him
and left him for dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Zappala himself has become an issue, as he opposes a retrial
while running for his first full term as district attorney. The son
of a prominent justice of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, he was
selected by the county judges to fill an unexpired term last fall,
despite having little experience in criminal law.
</P>
<P>
   On his first day on the job, Zappala dismissed his chief
homicide prosecutor, W. Christopher Conrad, who had sought the
appointment himself.
</P>
<P>
   Conrad, who is now running against Zappala in a Democratic
primary, said he had been ``absolutely shocked'' when Zappala was
named to the post. Conrad has sat with the Morena family in court
while publicly criticizing Zappala as too lenient in at least one
other case.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan.14, after a series of battles with the district
attorney's office over the Wideman case, McGregor said from the
bench that most prosecutors confronted with the new evidence would
agree that fairness dictated a new trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``The manner in which your office has approached this case has
everything in the world to do with the race for district attorney
of Allegheny County,'' said McGregor, a Republican who was once
proposed for a federal judgeship by President Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without Chris Conrad attacking him for being soft on crime,''
the judge said, the case against Wideman would be closed as a
result of a plea deal. Zappala angered McGregor particularly by
blocking an order by the judge that would have freed Wideman on
bail. An appeals court later overturned McGregor's order.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Zappala said he was offended by suggestions
that he was making decisions on the case for political reasons. He
said the judge had been influenced by the Wideman family's view of
the case.
</P>
<P>
   Wideman, the convict, said that his family's fame was ``a
blessing and a curse.'' A blessing, he said, because his brother's
success as a writer meant he had the means to help him. It is a
curse, he added, ``that because of the fame, Zappala feels a need
to make a stand.''
</P>
<P>
   Wideman, the writer, said the case illustrated what he called
the bias of the justice system, a theme in many of his books, which
describe the toll of life in Pittsburgh's black Homewood section.
His brother, he said, had changed in prison, overcoming a drug
problem, earning the equivalent of a junior college degree, and
teaching other inmates. But the prosecutors' resistance to a new
trial showed they were unwilling to see him as an individual.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ironically,'' John Wideman said in a recent interview in his
comfortable suburban home in Amherst, Mass., ``here we are a
quarter of a century later and we have a situation where Robby
Wideman, whoever he is, whatever he has accomplished, is not up in
front of the court. What's up in front of the court is a black male
who committed a crime.''

US CITES SCHOOL, HOSPITAL FOR PSYCHOSIS RESEARCH FLAWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DOLORES KONG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mount Sinai Medical School in New York and an affiliated
Veterans Affairs hospital did not properly protect the mentally ill
in research conducted in the 1980s and 1990s, leading to ``at least
some short-term harm'' in one psychosis-inducing study, a federal
agency has found.
</P>
<P>
   The Office for Protection from Research Risks, which monitors
US-funded research, documented a series of violations, ranging from
the failure to adequately inform subjects of the risks and nature
of the research, to the deliberate exacerbation of psychotic
symptoms among patients who had been stable.
</P>
<P>
   The agency, part of the National Institutes of Health and known
as OPRR, issued its determination in a January 28 letter to Mount
Sinai and Bronx Veterans Affairs Medical Center, which was obtained
by The Boston Globe Monday.
</P>
<P>
   One of the studies _ which withheld antipsychotic medications
from stabilized schizophrenia patients and gave them L-dopa, known
to induce psychosis in the mentally ill _ was cited in a four-part
series that ran in the Globe three months ago, highlighting
psychiatric research abuses.
</P>
<P>
   OPRR found that while that study, published in 1987, resulted in
no long-term adverse effects, people ``suffered at least some
short-term harm or discomfort as evidenced by documentation of
schizophrenia relapse in all 28 patients.''
</P>
<P>
   For instance, one of the patients in that study, after being off
medication for four weeks, ``became violent and struck a doctor.
Another patient. . .expressed suicidal ideation; and another
patient's symptoms worsened significantly after only one day of
being off medication . . . ,'' according to OPRR, citing documents
it reviewed as part of its investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The study was led by Dr. Kenneth L. Davis, according to the OPRR
letter. Davis is Mount Sinai's chairman of psychiatry.
</P>
<P>
   OPRR's finding comes five years after a New York-based mental
health advocate first filed a complaint with OPRR about the 1987
study and raised concerns in the media.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really am questioning why it took them so long. What kind of
obstacles were there that prevented them from investigating it and
determining it sooner?'' said Vera Hassner Sharav, president and
co-founder of Citizens for Responsible Care in Psychiatry and
Research.
</P>
<P>
   The nine-page OPRR letter also found violations of federal
regulations to protect human subjects of research in two other
now-completed studies of schizophrenia, both of which began in the
early 1990s and were led by Dr. Michael Davidson. The violations
primarily concerned informed consent procedures.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Monday, Mount Sinai School of Medicine said it
has already addressed concerns now being outlined in the OPRR
letter.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1994, when a news report raised questions concerning
certain studies that had been conducted in previous years, Mount
Sinai immediately and voluntarily conducted an in-depth evaluation
of the manner in which that research was conducted, and voluntarily
implemented appropriate corrective actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are gratified that in the assessment that it has just
completed, the Office for Protection from Research Risks has
acknowledged Mount Sinai's immediate response to the issues when
they were raised, recognized the corrective actions that Mount
Sinai implemented four years ago, and praised Mount Sinai for its
`commitment...to the protection of human research subjects,' ''
according to the statement.
</P>
<P>
   OPRR acknowledged that the studies in question ``have been
completed for at least several years,'' and that both Mount Sinai
and the Bronx VA conducted their own evaluations and ``instituted a
number of corrective actions,'' requiring no further action on the
agency's part.
</P>
<P>
   But, according to the letter by Dr. Michael A. Carome, acting
chief of the compliance oversight branch for OPRR's division of
human subject protections, the agency must be informed of any new
information that could lead to future OPRR action. In addition, he
wrote, the agency will be visiting the institution to make sure the
corrective actions are being implemented adequately.
</P>
<P>
   Carome and other OPRR officials did not return phone calls
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Hassner Sharav said that while she was glad to see OPRR document
the violations in its determination letter, she criticized the
agency for failing to do more.

<P>
   For Internet companies, the past few months have been like the
week before the big prom.
</P>
<P>
   Once the homecoming king and queen _ AOL and Netscape _
announced that they were an item, everybody else had to scramble to
get a partner before there were none left.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone's been talking to everyone else,'' said George Bell,
CEO of Excite.
</P>
<P>
   America Online's announcement in November that it would take
over Netscape Communications for $4.2 billion set off a chain of
other Internet mergers. AtHome decided to buy Excite for $6.7
billion, which prompted Yahoo to offer $4.6 billion for GeoCities
last month.
</P>
<P>
   Industry wags say the mating frenzy will continue until there
are no major Web sites left to buy, which might not take long.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 15 most popular Web sites, the only ones that are
still independent are Lycos, a Waltham, Mass., search engine, and
Xoom.com, a San Francisco e-commerce company. Odds are that they'll
be gobbled up by this spring.
</P>
<P>
   The Industry Standard, a trade magazine, reported last week that
NBC is close to a deal to buy Lycos.
</P>
<P>
   What's behind the trend? Internet companies are trying to build
the biggest audience they can as fast as they can. And the quickest
way to do that is to use their inflated stocks to buy other
companies.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The potential payoff: billions of dollars in advertising and
e-commerce deals.
</P>
<P>
   AOL-Netscape ``was the starting gun,'' Bell said. ``It's a
version of hyper musical chairs, and when music stops, the
companies left sitting'' will have more power than the three major
TV networks.
</P>
<P>
   The information superhighway is following the same path as the
car industry, which narrowed from 200 automakers to the Big Three
between the 1940s and 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Both industries went through massive periods of innovation,
followed by consolidation and specialization.
</P>
<P>
   Although the car industry took decades to boil down into three
companies, the fast-moving Internet by the end of next year
probably will be dominated by just four major portals _
AOL/Netscape, Yahoo, Microsoft's MSN and AtHome/Excite.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller players like Cnet, ESPN.com and E Online, will provide
specialized content.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  ``Businesses go through cycles, and the Internet is going through
its consolidation cycle,'' said Barry Schuler, president of AOL
Interactive Services. ``The smaller companies, which develop
specific features, are being bought up by the bigger players, who
are running full-fledged companies.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Lycos and Xoom.com, possible takeover targets
include Cnet, the San Francisco online news organization, and
Theglobe.com, a New York operator of Web communities.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner, NBC and Microsoft are the most frequently mentioned
suitors for these companies and others.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Xoom.com Chairman Chris Kitze said his company is not for sale
but that he's obligated to consider all offers. ``As long as the
market keeps going crazy and some Internet companies pick up $5
billion in market value overnight, you are going to see them put
their stock to use before it burns a hole in their pocket,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Companies with inflated shares, like AOL, Yahoo and AtHome, have
a more potent currency than companies whose shares are more
reasonably priced. For example, Ford Motor Co. acquired Volvo AB
for $6.25 billion the same week AtHome paid $6.75 billion in stock
for Excite.
</P>
<P>
   However the wheeling and dealing shakes out, the pace will be
dizzying.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the rest of the world, this must be pretty amazing
stuff,'' Bell marveled. ``How is it that a guy who is 25 and owns
only two pairs of shoes and used to eat noddles out of a bowl is
worth millions within a couple of years? That's the Internet for
you.''

PUTTING LUSK, WYO., ON MAP: &QL; 
The hinterlands have met high tech in a series of Microsoft
national TV ads promoting the technical savvy of Lusk (population
1,600), a rural ranching community near the Nebraska border. In one
spot, bespectacled 13-year-old Dan Henry Hansen uses the Internet
to study dung beetles; in another, Margy Brown relies on software
to operate a beeswax hand-cream business from home.
</P>
<P>
   ``A town like Lusk, and a state government, couldn't afford this
type of publicity,'' Lusk Mayor Mark Lohr said. ``The town is
getting calls and e-mail from all over the country from people and
businesses who would like to move here and lead a rural life.''
</P>
<P>
   Why Lusk, a stark outpost on the plains where cows outnumber
people 100 to 1?
</P>
<P>
   Eric Koivisto, Microsoft's director of advertising, said the
software giant became aware of Lusk after reading about its bid to
establish a fiber-optic connection for faster Internet access to
City Hall, the school district and library. &UR;  &LR; ``It fit the profile
of a community using technology in amazing ways to improve people's
lives,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A Microsoft spokeswoman declined to say how many millions of
dollars it has spent on the commercials. The people of Lusk didn't
get anything other than a free marketing campaign from perhaps the
greatest marketing company on the planet.

CENSUS SHOWS REBOUND IN HUMPBACK WHALE NUMBERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT ALLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Humpback whales, whose dramatic leaps and dives have made them
the star attractions for New England's whalewatching industry, are
more numerous _ and possibly less endangered _ than biologists
previously believed, according to the results of a new six-year
study.
</P>
<P>
   Using sophisticated photography and genetic analysis, an
international team of researchers estimated that 10,600 humpbacks
inhabit the waters stretching from the West Indies in the south to
Norway in the north _ almost twice the 1980s estimate of 5,505.
</P>
<P>
   But biologists called it premature to conclude that the
endangered species is finally recovering from a legacy of whaling
and other human-induced injuries. The higher estimate may largely
reflect better whale-counting techniques, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new population estimate is the first step in a long and
careful process of assessing the population before we can decide if
the species is out of the woods,'' said study co-author David
Mattila of the Center for Coastal Studies in Provincetown, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the improved humpback count is a bright spot in a field
where bad news is more the norm. David Morin, a biologist at the
Cetacean Research Unit in Gloucester, Mass., said the number of
humpbacks in the North Atlantic has almost certainly increased
after decades of protection from whale hunters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fortunately, it's better rather than worse news,'' added Teri
Frady of the National Marine Fisheries Service, which oversees
protection of endangered whales. She said the agency must learn
more about the overall well-being of humpbacks before it could
consider removing the animal from the endangered species list.
</P>
<P>
   The new study, the results of a six-nation effort called the
Years of the North Atlantic Humpback project, marks the most
elaborate attempt to count a tough-to-track animal that thinks
nothing of traveling hundreds of miles in a day.
</P>
<P>
   Originally conceived at the Center for Coastal Studies, the
study took researchers to the whales' West Indies breeding ground
as well as five major feeding areas such as the Gulf of Maine.
During 666 days at sea in 1992 and 1993, the team got pictures of
4,207 whale flukes as well as 2,327 skin samples.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the researchers need to figure out how rapidly the whale
population is growing and the severity of threats such as
entanglement in fishing gear, collisions with ships, and water
pollution. Mattila of the Center for Coastal Studies said an
overview of the humpback's health could be done next year.
</P>
<P>
   If the whale numbers have increased enough, the National Marine
Fisheries Service could list the humpback as a ``threatened''
rather than ``endangered'' species, giving the animal less
protection. However, it would still be protected from killing and
harassment under the Marine Mammal Protection Act.
</P>
<P>
   Though North Atlantic humpback population estimates of the past
are unreliable, researchers believe that the whales reached their
lowest point in the early 1900s after more than a century of
whaling. Since then, their numbers have increased, making them a
fairly common sight for New England whalewatchers.

SOMBER JORDANIANS LINE STREETS TO BID FAREWELL TO KING HUSSEIN 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DEBORAH HORAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMMAN, Jordan _ Issam Abu Shannab and his two small sons slowly
made their way Monday to the wide boulevard on which King Hussein's
casket was to pass in a few hours. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Abu Shannab held one end of a black flag, as the small hands of
his 5-and 7-year-old sons gripped the other.
</P>
<P>
   Around them, grieving Jordanians were coming from all
directions.
</P>
<P>
   Gesturing toward his children, who were bundled in ski jackets
and knitted hats to fend off the cold, Abu Shannab said, ``I've
been telling them that (King Hussein) is dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they just don't believe it,'' he said. They say, `Just a
few days ago, he was here.'''
</P>
<P>
   As world leaders gathered at Raghdan Palace to pay homage to a
ruler hailed by many as a peacemaker, an estimated 800,000
Jordanians lined the streets of Amman. Some stood in somber
silence. Many recounted fond memories of a king who, they said, was
more like a member of their family than a lofty monarch.
</P>
<P>
   Emad Hamaydeh, a 20-year-old law student, recalled the time he
was sitting with a friend at Mount Nebo, the desert mountain where
many people believe Moses is buried. The king and his sister,
Princess Haya, showed up without bodyguards.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein ``sat down on the stone next to us and talked to us
about being young,'' said Hamaydeh, waving his hand in the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told us how lucky we were to have our youth and said he
never felt like he had (experienced) his youth, because he was
always working,'' Hamaydeh said. ``It was something special.''
</P>
<P>
   That personal touch, many Jordanians say, was the secret to
Hussein's enduring popularity during nearly five decades of rule.
</P>
<P>
   Many people said Monday they still cannot believe the king, who
died at the age of 63 on Sunday of complications stemming from
lymphatic cancer, is really gone. Even as they waited for his
casket to pass, they spoke of Hussein in the present tense.
</P>
<P>
   ``The king touches people,'' said Basel Qubain, a 31-year-old
software engineer. ``You know a king is approaching by the aura
around him but, when he talks to you, you feel you are talking to
an ordinary human being.
</P>
<P>
   ``In other countries, you cannot approach a ruler,'' Qubain
continued. ``He is shielded by bodyguards, or he extends his hand
to be kissed. When King Hussein comes to you, he calls you `sidi'
(my master), even though it should be the other way around.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people placed bouquets of flowers in front of a mural
showing Hussein standing next to his royal jet. Others crouched on
the cold pavement and hung their heads in their hands.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the funeral procession appeared. Thousands of young
men ran alongside the cortege, trying to get a glimpse of the
casket perched on a beige army jeep and draped with a Jordanian
flag.
</P>
<P>
   ``Allahu akbar!'' people shouted. ``God is great!''
</P>
<P>
   The women in the crowd of mostly men began to sob. Men covered
their faces with their red headdresses. Soldiers standing guard
wiped their eyes with their red berets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love King Hussein,'' said 11-year-old Mohammed Hilu with
tears in his eyes. ``I cried when he died. My teacher cried when he
died.''
</P>
<P>
   But soon, the procession was gone. The king's casket arrived at
Raghdan Palace, where President Clinton and other world leaders
paid their last respects.
</P>
<P>
   Streets opened to traffic, and the people who had converged for
a few brief hours to say good-bye to their king went home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We belong to God, to God we return,'' said Qubain, reciting an
Islamic prayer. ``This is the way people console themselves. They
say, `He sacrificed his life for us.'''

PERSONAL HEALTH: NATURAL? SAFE? DRUG FREE? IT MIGHT BE NONE OF THE
ABOVE  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating to correct middle initial in byline)   By JANE E. BRODY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Whatever it is you may seek _ a memory boost, weight loss,
stress relief, immune enhancement, mood elevation, sexual
stimulation or therapy for your ailing heart, there is an herb
being sold as the ``natural drug-free'' answer to your prayers. But
experts warn that an ill-informed foray into the ever-expanding
world of botanical medicines can end up causing more problems than
it solves.
</P>
<P>
   Herbal products _ which are sold as dietary supplements, not
drugs _ are virtually unregulated, leaving the fox (in this case,
the manufacturer) to guard the hen house. While many companies are
conscientious about providing high-quality products free of
dangerous contaminants and containing what the label lists _ no
more, no less _ others market cheaply made products that contain
little or none of the stated ingredient or, worse, too much. One
study of 64 ``pure'' ginseng products found that 60 percent of them
were so watered down with cheaper herbs as to be worthless.
</P>
<P>
   Other products on the market are known health hazards. For
example, sassafras, still widely available in health food stores,
contains a carcinogen, safrole, that was banned decades ago by the
Food and Drug Administration from use in foods.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, hundreds of botanical products now sold in the
United States have been tested and found wanting or have never been
adequately tested to determine their effectiveness or safety,
especially if used for more than a few weeks. Although health
claims cannot legally be made on product labels or in
advertisements, hundreds of articles, books, pamphlets and
newsletters attribute all kinds of poorly documented medical
benefits to herbal products. Even without prospect of insurance
reimbursement, herbs sell widely to gullible consumers desperate
for a simple solution to their complex health problems and
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, different parts of a plant or different methods of
preparation can yield different effects. As Consumer Reports on
Health has pointed out, dandelion root acts as a laxative while its
leaves contain a diuretic. An herb prepared as a tea may contain
none of the active ingredients if those ingredients do not dissolve
in water.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, anyone who is considering joining the 70 million
Americans now using herbal products had best learn as much as
possible about the herb's effects, side effects, drug interactions
and conditions in which its use is inadvisable _ as well as check
on the producer's reputation.
</P>
<P>
   This may be the greatest challenge faced by a potential consumer
of medicinal herbs. First, how can you tell what a product may do
for you? By law, labels can state only how an herb may affect
bodily structure or function. It cannot claim any direct medical or
health benefit. Does the statement ``promotes prostate well-being''
mean that the product is useful for men with symptoms of an
enlarged prostate, i.e., the need to urinate frequently and
urgently? Or does it imply that the product may help to prevent
prostate cancer?
</P>
<P>
   Also, because no specific health claims are made, labels are not
required to carry health warnings. Without some independent
research, you may be unable to tell whether it is safe to use a
particular herb if, say, you have heart disease or diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   Because the label is of little help, turn to reliable sources of
information about herbs. I recommend two books by a
university-based pharmacognosist with no financial ties to the herb
industry: ``Tyler's Herbs of Choice'' by Dr. Varro Tyler and James
E. Robbers, and ``Tyler's Honest Herbal'' by Tyler and Steven
Foster, both published by Haworth Press in Binghamton, N.Y. Next,
find a reliable manufacturer. Although there are no guarantees, you
are likely to get the best products from large companies that have
been in business for many years. Ask the proprietor of your
pharmacy or health-food store for recommendations. Don't shop for
bargains, especially for costly herbs like ginseng. You're likely
to pay good money for a bad product.
</P>
<P>
   Although again it is not a guarantee of quality, look for
standardized products that state the amount of active ingredient in
each dose. Avoid dried herbs, as in teas, bulk herbs or powdered
herbs in capsules. They deteriorate rapidly and are likely to be
inactive. The most potent products are made from fresh herbs:
liquid and solid extracts, tinctures and freeze-dried herbs in
capsules. Before you buy any herbal product, check the expiration
date.
</P>
<P>
   If you are thinking of trying an herbal remedy for a known or
suspected health problem, start by obtaining a diagnosis from a
qualified doctor. Do not rely on an herbologist, naturopath,
chiropractor, pharmacist or proprietor in a health food store to
diagnose the problem. Many of the anecdotal reports of effective
use of herbal products come from people who did not have a health
problem in the first place. In other cases, people have unwittingly
self-treated serious diseases with useless herbal products and thus
delayed a correct diagnosis and effective medical care.
</P>
<P>
   Always consult your doctor before you start to use an herbal
product. It may have adverse effects on an underlying health
problem or interact badly with other medication you take. Also, if
a problem develops while you are using an herbal product, stop
taking it right away and see your doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Herbs contain drugs that can cause side effects, allergic
reactions and hazardous drug interactions. For example, garlic,
which acts as an anticoagulant in foods or botanicals, can add to
the activity of a blood-thinning drug and cause excessive bleeding.
Or someone taking medication to control diabetes could experience a
dangerous reduction in blood sugar if ginseng was used.
</P>
<P>
   All suspected adverse reactions to herbal products should be
reported to the Food and Drug Administration, which has a
monitoring program called Medwatch. Call the toll-free number,
(800) FDA-1088, or contact the program on line at
www.fda.gov/medwatch.
</P>
<P>
   Follow dosage recommendations on the label. More is not better;
it may even be lethal. Do not take herbs for longer periods than
experts recommend. And avoid mixtures of herbs; they generally have
not been tested for safety or effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you have no known health problem and have experienced no
known side effects, be sure to tell your doctor about any herbal
products you use. When a routine blood test turns up an abnormal
reading, you could end up having costly tests for a problem caused
by an herb the doctor didn't know you were taking.
</P>
<P>
   Never give herbs to babies or children except under medical
supervision. Also, do not take herbal products if you are pregnant
or trying to become pregnant or if you are breast-feeding; few if
any of these products have been tested for safety during pregnancy
and lactation.

computer problem featured all sorts of machines driven haywire by

dollars were spent on computer repairs and upgrades. Now a chorus
of regulators and authorities warn that Americans fearing for the
worst may end up inflicting more serious damage on themselves,
their neighbors and the economy than anything the computers do.
Some of the concerns are almost humorous. But planning experts are
taking seriously a wide range of Year 2000 disaster scenarios

gasoline, fires caused by misuse of newly acquired wood stoves and

   SCI-HERBS (Undated) _ Herbal medicine, the mainstay of
therapeutics for centuries before modern purified drugs relegated
it to the status of near-quackery, has in the last five years
emerged from the fringes of health care with an astonishing
flourish and now shows clear signs of joining the medical
mainstream. Despite many cautionary tales about adulterated and
even dangerous products, herbs formulated as capsules, tinctures,
extracts and teas _ and increasingly as additions to common foods
like potato chips and fruit drinks _ are now routinely used by a
third of American adults seeking to enhance their health or
alleviate their illnesses. By Jane E. Brody. (The story has moved

<P>
   AMMAN, Jordan _ In a cold winter mist, with tears and prayers
and anxiety about their future, Jordanians lined the streets Monday
for a last fleeting look at their fallen king.
</P>
<P>
   The convertible desert-camouflage jeep bearing King Hussein's
flag-draped coffin moved quickly across town to the Rhagadan Palace
compound, where past and present heads of state attended the
closed-door burial. Breaking through barricades into the streets,
people thronged after the hearse as it slowly accelerated out of
reach.
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of the route, a crowd had begun gathering long
before, waiting for the royal motorcade to emerge from Beb
al-Salam, the ``house of peace'' that had been the king's family
home. The crowd was a small cross-section of modern Jordan: factory
workers and taxi-drivers earning $200 a month, wealthy bankers from
the exclusive neighborhood across the street, married women in
traditional robes and single secretaries in smart skirts and
jackets.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all were dressed in black, and most had been crying.
Students from the Al-Yobeal High School had been standing for hours
in the fog and wind beneath their silver-scripted black banner:
``We are alone without you, King Hussein.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the final moment of waiting for a nation that had been
anticipating the end of the Hussein era with grief and disbelief
for many days.
</P>
<P>
   With hovering helicopters kicking up dust, the parade of silver
Mercedes town cars and open red military Land Rovers suddenly
pulled around the corner, their royal passengers and military
chauffeurs resplendent in scarlet kaffiyehs.
</P>
<P>
   The car with the king's coffin was almost last. ``Did you see my
king? I lost my king!'' a sobbing man yelled out as it passed.
</P>
<P>
   Judging from conversations in the waiting crowd Monday, many
people here were trying to adjust to the prospect of Jordan without
Hussein, and wondering how this would affect their daily lives.
</P>
<P>
   Though the overwhelming emotion Monday was deep sadness, the
sorrow was laced with fear that a vulnerable Jordan had lost an
irreplaceable guardian. For others, there was inchoate anger at a
world they felt had consigned them to undeserved poverty, despite
the late king's good works.
</P>
<P>
   And there were complaints about rising crime, taxes and food
costs _ often combined with the suggestion that had Hussein lived,
he might have found a way to resolve these problems.
</P>
<P>
   The pain of loss was leavened with pride, however. The king's
death put this small desert country of 4 million at least briefly
at the center of world attention. The four-hour state funeral was
broadcast overseas by foreign cable networks, and _ of greater
significance to many here _ by state television in most of the
divided Middle East, from Syria to Egypt to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have more foreign leaders here than for the Kennedy
funeral,'' one man at the roadside said as he waited for the coffin
to pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than for Churchill,'' a friend added.
</P>
<P>
   There was an almost poignant hope that this moral support would
translate into the financial aid that Jordanians say they need and
deserve. The outpouring of international affection for the late
king was seen as a testimonial to Jordan's support of Middle East
peace, and many Jordanians say they paid too steep a price for the
king's policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peace killed our economy,'' said Ghazi Imraish, a 33-year-old
businessman who now lives in Dallas, but returned ``to see my king
one last time.''
</P>
<P>
   His is a common view here, though a better case can be made for
war as the cause. It was Iraq's invasion of Kuwait that ultimately
led to the punishing loss of Jordan's Iraqi trade and of billions
of dollars from expatriate Jordanians working in the Persian Gulf
who fled back to Jordan during the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   But Jordan's support for peace has reaped it few countervailing
rewards. Per capita income has stagnated at $1,500, below the level
of the Palestinian West Bank. Unemployment is 15 percent and
climbing. Steep food prices have triggered riots. And the country
is burdened by an $8 billion foreign debt, bigger than its gross
domestic product.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is hard to find work here _ too hard,'' said Abed Yusef,
47, a stocky one-time oil worker in Kuwait who came home to years
of unemployment. ``We are looking to the leaders of the world to
stand beside Jordan, to help Jordan.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton was spontaneously praised for the recent
near-tripling of American military and economic aid, with Jordan
slated to get $225 million in 1999 and $325 million next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the United States will help us,'' said Hana Taufik, a
34-year-old taxi driver.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton's friendship with the king was a very special
relationship. You could tell from the speech he gave on television
last night,'' he added, referring to the president's eulogy Sunday
from the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Businessmen in the crowd said they welcomed a Saudi Arabian
offer to shore up Jordan's foreign reserves with short-term loans.
Still, with banks closed and currency trading suspended during this
national week of mourning, investors will be watching nervously
when the markets reopen on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   People interviewed on the street here Monday were spontaneously
and uniformly critical of the U.N. sanctions against Iraq, which
the government says has cost Jordan $3 billion in lost transport
and tariff revenue alone since 1990. All seemed to view the
sanctions issue as an integral part of the regional peace efforts,
contending that the Western powers punishing Iraq should compensate
Jordan for lost income.
</P>
<P>
   ``King Hussein taught us how to survive our many difficulties,''
said Kamal Ali, a 35-year-old cement-factory worker. ``But we still
have a problem, because of the siege of Iraq.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A successful merchant, elegantly attired in a three-piece suit
and flowing kaffiyeh, spoke with moist eyes of his admiration for
the late king as the coffin passed by.
</P>
<P>
   A breath later, he said the death and royal succession had been
very bad for business. ``I haven't sold a thing in 15 days,'' he
said, and he faced the prospect of shuttering his small chain of
clothing shops for the coming week for the official mourning
period.
</P>
<P>
   Later, over tea inside his spacious home, he said he might be
forced to close two or three of the six stores he had opened with
high hopes in 1991, after returning home from a successful retail
career in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until 1993, things were all right, but since then it has been
very difficult,'' said the businessman, who spoke on the condition
of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of the downturn was no coincidence, in his view. The
1994 peace treaty with Israel failed to generate expected business
opportunities in Israel and the West Bank, and it alienated other
Jordanian trading partners in the region, he said.
</P>
<P>
   His most serious business problem, he said, was the embargo
against Iraq, which once imported billions of dollars in consumer
goods through and from Jordan. He said he hoped that the new
American aid would help restore economic confidence.
</P>
<P>
   His wife rolled her eyes. ``You hear these figures on
television, like $300 million, but the people won't see any of
it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have people whose meals are tea and bread. The new king
needs to prove that that he can make the economy better, and he
needs to do it soon.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   SARASOTA, Fla. _ Clowns wept. The ringmaster actually sobbed. A
thousand roustabouts, aerialists and equestrians began looking for
work. When ``The Greatest Show on Earth'' played under canvas for
the final time on July 16, 1956, it was a front-page story in
newspapers across the land.
</P>
<P>
   But here in the city that was its winter home from 1927 to 1959,
the Ringling Brothers and Barnum &AMP; Bailey Circus has raised its
tent for the first time in 42 years.
</P>
<P>
   In a parking lot at the Sarasota Fairgrounds right off Ringling
Drive, flameproof polyvinyl has superseded canvas. Traditional
circus fare like popcorn and cotton candy will be supplemented by
designer sandwiches and cappuccino. And the new show will be
performed in but one 38-foot-wide circus ring.
</P>
<P>
   This is not intended to replace the three-ring extravaganza that
shed its tents and began performing in air-conditioned arenas after
the circus regrouped in 1957. The year before, the tented show was
a victim of television, red ink, labor difficulties and bad
weather.
</P>
<P>
   And instead of being the greatest show on earth, the new show
will qualify as one of the coziest: an intimate, upscale circus in
a million-dollar custom-made Italian tent, tentatively titled
``Barnum's Kaleidoscape: The Magical One-Ring Experience From
Ringling Brothers.'' Previews begin here on Feb. 26.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a sure thing,'' said Greg Parkinson, a circus
historian who is the executive director of the Circus World Museum
in Baraboo, Wis. ``In a tent of this size they'll have to have a
high percentage of sales to break even. And there will be
competitors.''
</P>
<P>
   One of them, Paul Binder, the founder and artistic director of
the Big Apple Circus, warned that ``the economics of a one-ring
tent are tight and very nasty.'' Nevertheless, Parkinson said,
``it's a historic moment for this circus, given the words of John
Ringling North,'' referring to the statement by North, then the
show's president and board chairman, from his private railroad car
in 1956 that ``the tented circus as it now exists is in my opinion
a thing of the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Paraphrasing those words, Kenneth Feld, Ringling's producer and
chief executive, said that for his show, ``tented entertainments
will be a thing of the future.'' He added: ``Ringling's statement
was valid in its time, but the tent now gives us the ability to
practically deliver circus to the door of people who ordinarily
can't, or won't, come to arenas. We want to reach new suburban and
exurban communities.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ringling also seems to be trying to capitalize on the
growing audience for one-ring circuses, ``a large market as
demonstrated by the popularity of the Cirque du Soleil and the Big
Apple Circus,'' said Parkinson. Feld acknowledged that ``it's hard
to say that we've ignored Cirque du Soleil,'' adding, ``If a market
is out there, we feel we should get more of our fair share.''
</P>
<P>
   Feld estimated the new show's initial production costs to be $8
million, but several circus veterans put them closer to $10
million.
</P>
<P>
   It is quite a gamble.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's scary to put such a big bet on the power of circus to
move people in an era of virtual entertainment,'' said Tim Holst,
the Ringling vice president for talent and production.
</P>
<P>
   Another risk is that the new show could cannibalize demand for
Ringling's traditional three-ring extravaganza, which will continue
to crisscross the country with its two separate touring units. ``We
see the shows as complementary,'' said Feld, ``and we think the new
circus will augment our basic business,'' which brought revenues of
$500 million last year into his privately held company.
</P>
<P>
   In 1872 P.T. Barnum's circus went to two rings. (His three rings
came along in 1881; the Barnum and Ringling troupes became a single
show in 1919.) ``In the 1920s Ringling had five rings,'' Parkinson
said, adding that with the new show Ringling was trying to upgrade
the circus in a different way, countering negative preconceptions
about ``the traditional carnival or tent show.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, as Holst said, ``We want this show to be the balsamic
vinegar of circus.''
</P>
<P>
   And so ``Kaleidoscape'' is attempting to lure an affluent
audience of mall mavens into its new champagne-colored tent with
its red stars and stripes, free of obstructed views and offering
the comfort of roomy crushed-velvet padded seats with backs. To
protect audience members' shoes from mud, the tent will have
red-carpeted hardwood flooring. The traditionally seedy, disheveled
ticket takers and part-time ushers will be replaced by fresh-faced,
costumed full-timers who will travel with the show.
</P>
<P>
   And because market research showed that ticket holders at artsy
tent circuses are dismayed by the porta-potty experience, Ringling
has designed two sleek bathroom trailers that will be staffed with
attendants.
</P>
<P>
   Feld said he would be targeting 30-year-old parents who were
more affluent than the typical audience at its mass-market
three-ring shows. Feld estimated that premiere ``couch'' seating
would be in the $40 range, and other ticket prices would average in
the mid-$20 range.
</P>
<P>
   It was to Sarasota that the silver, 80-car Ringling train _
forever dubbed by circus folk ``the funeral train'' _ returned 42
years ago with its folded tent and grieving cargo of circus
veterans after the circus had ended its annual run four months
early.
</P>
<P>
   But these days an international company of 48 performers is
rehearsing the new tent's 2-hour 15-minute show, with an 8-member
band performing in highly stylized red-and-gold Art Deco-ish sets.
The show is a potpourri of trapeze flyers, acrobats, variety
performers and animals _ including 27 geese, 10 horses, four ducks
and two foxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an all-star show, and we hope it will create a
sensation in the world of the circus,'' said Alex Petrov, a
26-year-old second-generation wire walker.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The intimacy of the single ring, said Parkinson, the historian,
``enables audiences to focus on one act at a time, and to better
identify with performers who are human beings doing extraordinary
things.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For two hours we want to throw a party for the audience,''
said Raffaele DeRitis, 32, the show's Italian director, who has
created circuses, theatrical productions, operas and magic shows in
Europe. The show is a narrative that introduces the audience to a
group of ``ordinary'' people who become performers in the ring
before the ticket holders' eyes. They appear again as ordinary
people who bid the audience farewell after the show's finale. ``And
we want to encourage the audience to wonder about what happens
behind the scenes, to imagine the characters in the show, their
romances and their hatreds.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Barnum's Kaleidoscape'' was coined by Feld, 50, a kaleidoscope
collector who wanted to build a quirky show about a circus that was
a tribute to P.T. Barnum. The name is also a reference to ``an
escape from everyday reality,'' Feld said.
</P>
<P>
   David Larible, 41, the new show's featured performer, said,
``The audience will get to meet me as a person, before the show,
then witness my transformation to David the Clown in the ring.''
Larible has spent eight years as the star clown on the Ringling Red
Unit, one of the circus' two touring shows that crisscross the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, the new show is ``a breakthrough for a generation of
seasoned American circus people who have never performed in a tent,
or even a one-ring circus, like me,'' said Jon Weiss, 36, a former
clown and juggler who spent seven years being shot from a Ringling
cannon, always in an arena. He is now not only a manager of the
show but also will play himself, as the manager.
</P>
<P>
   One creator of the new show is a living link to the old tent. In
1955, as an 11-year-old in Butte, Mont., Brian Liddicoat, now the
show's general manager, was hired with dozens of other boys as a
day laborer to help put up the 12,000-seat, three-ring Ringling
tent in Stodden Park.
</P>
<P>
   His fee? ``A free pass to see the show,'' he said with a laugh.
``I'll never forget how thrilling it was to be part of that.''
</P>
<P>
   After its Sarasota debut, the circus will head to Austin, Texas,
and then to Irvine Meadows in California. If it proves to be a
critical and financial success, Ringling hopes to re-create it
around the country and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Ringling's largest competitor in the tented world was
magnanimous toward the interloper. ``We wish them a lot of luck,
and we respect them as serious people,'' said Jean David, vice
president for marketing at Cirque du Soleil, which has become the
worldwide one-ring phenomenon to which Ringling aspires. ``But you
know, I think Cirque du Soleil competes more with `The Phantom of
the Opera' than with other circuses.''
</P>
<P>
   But a smaller competitor was less sanguine about the increased
competition. ``My sense is that Ringling will borrow more from us
than from the Cirque du Soleil, and that Kenneth's show will appeal
more to family audiences, like our show does,'' said Binder of the
Big Apple Circus, which began in 1977 in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Kenneth decides he wants to come into our markets, there
will be a competitive situation,'' Binder added. ``Audiences will
have to decide, `Which one do I go to?'''
</P>
<P>
   If Cirque du Soleil provides Ringling with a business model for
one-ring success, it has demonstrated that the rewards can be
immense. Since 1984 more than 18 million people have bought a
ticket to one of Cirque du Soleil's productions (there are
currently six worldwide), and the company has founded an empire of
multimedia souvenir merchandising. Published reports have estimated
that the privately held Montreal company's revenue exceeds $119
million, with profit averaging 15 to 20 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   Cirque du Soleil's tents seat 2,500 people with an average
ticket price of more than $50, selling out 93 percent of the time.
Big Apple has an average ticket price of $23 during its multistate
tour in a 1,980-seat tent (except at Lincoln Center, where the
average ticket costs $36.)
</P>
<P>
   Since many circus performers live permanently in Sarasota, there
has been tremendous interest here in the new show. All the
curiosity was rewarded on a recent Sunday, when passers-by
witnessed a sight no American has seen for four decades: a Ringling
crew putting up a tent.
</P>
<P>
   Ten workers, including performers like Weiss and Petrov, toiled
where once 200 strained to ``fly,'' or raise, a three-ring tent.
And instead of work elephants, electric winches whined as they
ratcheted the new tent upward on four 60-foot steel masts.
</P>
<P>
   As roustabouts leaped to install the tent poles, Weiss surveyed
his handiwork. Smiling triumphantly, he said, ``I think Ringling's
back in the tent business again.''

 When you lust for nuts and all you get is cremes ...   By Holly Ocasio Rizzo 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
O n Sunday, Valentines will turn the 35 million lovely heart-shaped
candy boxes expected to be sold this year into wrecks of cockeyed
paper frills and half-bitten, poked-at chocolates.
</P>
<P>
   Where's the caramel, and which one's the champagne truffle? If
only we had X-ray vision.
</P>
<P>
   Without a map, not even experts can be sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have boxes and boxes of chocolates here, and we're forever
guessing what's inside each candy,'' says Karen Louie, a publicist
for the American Boxed Chocolate Manufacturers in New York City.
``You see people in the office biting into them, shaking their
heads and saying, `No, that's not it.'''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't always such a guessing game. In the not-distant past
when chocolates were handmade, it was easy to tell which was which.
</P>
<P>
   ``To a certain extent, there are traditional patterns,'' says
Terry Richardson of Hayward, a British-trained chocolate
technologist and candy-industry consultant. ``English toffee, for
example, is chocolate-coated and rolled in nuts. If the candy had a
lemon-cream center, the candy maker would traditionally mark it
with an `L' on top. Raspberry was an `R.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Some small-scale chocolate makers who make everything by hand,
still mark their candies in this way, he says, and vestiges of the
code crop up in some mass-made boxes: a curl like a ``C'' on a
round cherry cordial or a square caramel, for example.
</P>
<P>
   But mass-marketers using candy-coating machines (the first ones
were developed in the 1920s to keep up with increasing consumer
demand for chocolate) can't re-create the marks. Instead, many use
locator maps tucked into the boxes _ an idea pioneered by Whitman
Co. (now owned by Russell Stover) in 1912. After Whitman's first
map, imitators quickly surfaced, giving rise to the myth that candy
makers secretly code their chocolates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember as a kid seeing a diagram with squiggles and marks,
a chart that maybe came out of a box, to tell what was inside a
chocolate candy,'' says Beth Klein, librarian at the California
Culinary Academy in San Francisco. She searched the school's
extensive library for a similar key but came up dry.
</P>
<P>
   She's not alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a call recently from the people working on reviving the
TV game show `I've Got a Secret' who had thought, `What a great
idea if we could crack the See's candy code,' '' says Richard Van
Doren, vice president of marketing for See's in South San Francisco
and Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   It's no dark secret: See's includes a photo guide to its candies
in the back of its mail-order booklets. The pictures are side views
of sliced-open chocolates; they don't show the top markings, which
are specified in fat three-ring binders of candy measurements See's
executives keep in their offices.
</P>
<P>
   The specs call for particular marks: caramel, ``smooth with 1
mark''; buttercream, ``smooth''; cherry, ``4 marks''; orange,
``smooth with O mark.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When it was all done by hand, the candy makers would dip the
chocolate and put a mark on it with a piece of copper wire,'' Van
Doren says. See's now makes few marks by hand. Most are applied by
machinery that lightly touches the sticky tops of the candies after
they've passed through a sheet of liquid chocolate. Then the
candies move by conveyor belt through a cooling tunnel that
solidifies the marks.
</P>
<P>
   However, many chocolate companies long ago gave up the handmade
look. They make candy by coating molds with chocolate, pressing
fillings into the coatings, then sealing the backs with more
chocolate. The result: shiny identical shells, starfish, dollar
signs, hearts and other shapes. The advantage: a lot more perfect
chocolates turned out of molds a lot quicker.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of BONBON 2 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  The only way to tell what's inside is to bite.
</P>
<P>
   And that's what chocoholics do.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent survey for Russell Stover Candies, customers 'fessed
up to surprising filling-detection techniques: 43 percent decide
based on a candy's shape; 30 percent eat whatever they touch; 27
percent nibble before taking for keeps; and 14 percent scratch or
poke the surface to try the filling. Because of that high
willingness to destroy pretty chocolates, this year the company
puts a candy map in boxes of its Russell Stover line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bet I can figure out half the box, but that's no better than
most people,'' says Tim Moriarty, features editor at Chocolatier
magazine, aimed at amateur chocolate makers. In each issue, the
magazine takes the lid off a box of molded chocolates, photographs
it and identifies the filling in each piece.
</P>
<P>
   Many companies are devising similar chocolate IDs. Laderbach, a
Swiss company whose chocolates sell for $50 a 15.2-ounce box,
prints a guide inside the lid. Joseph Schmidt Confections, of San
Francisco, puts its guide on box tags. Bernard Callebaut
Chocolaterie of Calgary, Alberta, includes a tiny photo guide in
its mail-order brochures. Brown &AMP; Haley, in Tacoma, Wash., just
moved its photo guide from the bottom to inside the lid after
customers complained about having to pick up the box to see it.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps such guides won't be needed for long _ not since Mike
Bursk of San Clemente started selling the Sneak-Peek Candy Sampler.
The 31/2-inch-long device, sold by mail order, is made of nickel
and resembles a pogo stick.
</P>
<P>
   Bursk, a charter fishing boat operator, was inspired by a dinner
party at which he encountered a box of chocolates with all the
bottoms poked and scratched. ``My wife and I laughed about it, and
finally I decided to make something that would take a more
surgically clean sample,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   One method is even more sanitary. ``Usually you can tell by the
shape and size,'' says Carole Bloom, author of ``All About
Chocolate'' (Macmillan, 1998).
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's not foolproof.''

ATTEMPTS TO CENSURE CLINTON INTENSIFY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Efforts to censure President Clinton for his
conduct in the Monica Lewinsky affair intensified Monday as it
became increasingly clear that House prosecutors will not be able
to muster the 67 votes they need in the Senate to convict and
remove the president from office.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with the prospect of letting Clinton off without being
punished at all, Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., said
he hopes to introduce a resolution of censure as early as Thursday
that would make ``a historical statement of record'' condemning the
president's conduct.
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, has threatened to filibuster any
censure motion, contending that it would be unconstitutional for
the Senate to take any action against Clinton other than voting to
convict or acquit him of the charges of perjury and obstruction of
justice filed against him by the House.
</P>
<P>
   It takes 60 votes to overcome a filibuster in the Senate.
Daschle told reporters Monday that he needs support from at least
20 Republicans, because ``four or five'' of the 45 Senate Democrats
agree with Gramm that it would be unconstitutional to do anything
else in the case other than to vote for or against conviction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously we need 20 Republicans to join with Democrats.
Democrats, I don't think, will be united on censure,'' Daschle
said.
</P>
<P>
   If Gramm succeeds in holding off a vote on censure during the
trial, which is scheduled to end Friday, Daschle said he would try
to bring it up in late February when the Senate returns from a
10-day recess to resume its regular business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that Phil Gramm has the 40 votes to sustain his
position. But if he does, we will just look for appropriate
(legislative) vehicles when we come back and keep amending those
vehicles so long as it takes to (pass) the censure,'' Daschle said.
</P>
<P>
   But some lawmakers who would probably vote to censure Clinton
are concerned that members will lose interest in it after a long
recess.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really doubt if people are going to want to turn to this
again,'' said Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, who has tried to win
support for his own idea of adjourning the impeachment trial for a
brief period to allow senators to adopt a censure resolution, and
then resuming the trial again.
</P>
<P>
   Sens. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., and Robert Bennett, R-Utah,
have been leading an effort to fashion a bipartisan censure
resolution that would condemn Clinton's behavior. But it has failed
to attract widespread support because it does not say that Clinton
actually lied about his relationship with Lewinsky and tried to
hide it.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., the lead prosecutor for the House, said
in his closing arguments Monday that he was ``dumbfounded'' by some
of the drafts of the censure proposals being circulated.
</P>
<P>
   ``They sound tougher than the articles of impeachment,'' he told
the senators.
</P>
<P>
   But he warned senators that if they vote for censure it would in
effect amount to a dereliction of their constitutional duty.

THREE MEMBERS OF TEXAS PRISON GANG SENTENCED TO LIFE IN INMATE'S
DEATH 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ALLAN TURNER 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Three members of the white Aryan Circle prison gang have been
sentenced to life in prison for murdering a rival white gang member
with a 6-inch-homemade knife during an attack at Livingston's
Terrell Unit.
</P>
<P>
   The three were the first of nine to face charges in the Oct. 6,
1997, attack on Ryan Osgood, a 20-year-old member of the White
Knights.
</P>
<P>
   Osgood had been serving a life sentence for the 1994 capital
murder of Houston convenience store clerk An Phu Le, 38. Le was
shot in the back after he refused to give money to Osgood and
another robber.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually white gangs attack other races,'' said A.P. Merillat,
an investigator with the Texas Department of Criminal Justice's
Special Prosecution Unit. ``Here you have two white supremacist
groups going after one another. That's somewhat unusual.''
</P>
<P>
   Merillat said the attack on Osgood was motivated by revenge over
earlier conflicts between the groups. Merillat said both groups,
though relatively small, have cells inside and outside state
prisons. Like other prison gangs, he said, the two white groups
compete to control the penitentiary market for tobacco, drugs and
sex.
</P>
<P>
   Prison authorities said the White Knights bear no link to the
White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan other than sharing some beliefs
and symbolism.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in 1997, witnesses testified in last week's trial, Aryan
Circle vice president Terry Rayborn obtained a master key to
inmates' lockers, using it to ``plant'' homemade weapons in those
assigned to members of the White Knights.
</P>
<P>
   In September 1997, Merillat said, Osgood retaliated by attacking
Rayborn with a sharpened piece of wire in the prison dining hall.
Rayborn was only slightly injured, but his Aryan Circle responded
by ordering ``hits'' on Osgood.
</P>
<P>
   Osgood was attacked as he and a cellmate, fellow White Knights
member Marc Ashbrook, left their cell for the dining hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``That cellblock had been under lockdown for several weeks,''
Merillat said. ``This was the first meal they were to eat in the
chow hall.''
</P>
<P>
   Merillat said two groups of Aryan Circle members attacked the
men. Ashbrook successfully fought off his attackers, but Osgood was
fatally beaten and stabbed with a 6-inch knife made of Plexiglas
near the third-floor showers.
</P>
<P>
   Guards used tear gas to disperse the combatants.
</P>
<P>
   Osgood was taken to Hermann Hospital in Houston, where he
lingered 13 days on life support before dying. Merillat said the
weapon was broken in half. Part was thrown from a prison window; an
unsuccessful attempt was made to flush the other half down a
toilet.
</P>
<P>
   Sentenced for the murder in Livingston state district court were
Thomas Armstrong, serving 10 years for a Travis County burglary;
Stephen Brumfield, 15 years for aggravated assault with a deadly
weapon in McLennan County; and Robert Campbell, 40 years for
attempted capital murder in Tarrant County.
</P>
<P>
   Merillat said no date has been set for trial of the remaining
defendants.

 &HT;    Vote on open deliberations may give way to written statements
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senators pushing a bipartisan plan to open the
Senate deliberations on President Clinton's fate say they don't
have the votes to overturn a 131-year-old rule keeping them secret.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate is scheduled to vote on the motion to open the
deliberations today when it reconvenes at 1 p.m. to begin the final
phase of the impeachment trial. The bid to open the closed session
lost ground Monday when Majority leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.) said
through his spokesman that he opposed changing Senate rules to open
the deliberations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Senate at this moment is as close to a jury as it gets,''
said Lott spokesman John Czwartacki. ``In 2600 years of trials,
jury deliberations have not been open.''
</P>
<P>
   While Lott and other key Republican leaders remain opposed to
opening the deliberations, several Republican senators said there
is a growing willingness to release a transcript of the closed-door
session after the impeachment trial is over.
</P>
<P>
   But making the transcript public, a departure from impeachment
precedent, would also require a vote of the Senate and that vote
may not come for several weeks, said Sen. Larry Craig (R-Idaho), a
member of Lott's leadership team.
</P>
<P>
   In place of opening the deliberations, Lott and other leaders
are pushing an alternative that would simply allow senators to
introduce into the impeachment record written statements on why
they voted for or against the impeachment articles.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Paul Wellstone (D-Minn.), a Democratic backer of the open
deliberations proposal, said he believes no more than one of the 45
Senate Democrats will vote against opening the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it doesn't get opened, it will be because Republicans voted
against it,'' said Wellstone.
</P>
<P>
   The impeachment rules adopted in the 1868 impeachment trial of
President Andrew Johnson stipulate that a two-thirds vote of the
Senate is required to add a new rule to open the deliberations.
About two dozen Republicans say they will vote for the motion to
open deliberations, but backers are still about seven votes short
of the 67 needed to change the rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is historic,'' said Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-Texas),
a GOP backer of the proposal. ``I cannot imagine that we would
impeach or not impeach the president of the United States in a
closed session. It's too important to our country, and I think it
is a precedent that needs to be set for the future that we were
open in our final deliberations.''
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison noted that there is no record of the deliberations in
Johnson's impeachment. ``I think that is a loss for history,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to Johnson's impeachment, Senate deliberations were open.
Critics of the plan to reverse the Johnson precedent note that Sen.
Robert Byrd (D-W.Va.) and then-majority leader Bob Dole revised the
impeachment rules in 1986 and did not change the clause on closed
deliberations.
</P>
<P>
   Critics also point to the two-closed door sessions the Senate
has already had, praising the open and candid discussions that took
place outside the public eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do feel that a closed deliberations creates a frankness and
a clarity to the debate,'' Craig said. ``If it's open, then it
really becomes the final speeches of senators prior to their vote.
That's not a deliberation. That would be two and a half or three
days of political statements.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders are also worried that the open deliberations
would offer Democrats one last opportunity to attack House
prosecutors and Independent Counsel Ken Starr.
</P>
<P>
   ``We risk a very high profile partisan debate and I think to
date we've avoided that,'' Craig. ``I think some of my colleagues
on the other side might be drawn to that flame.''

AMERICAN AIRLINES TRIMS FLIGHTS IN PILOT DISPUTE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX PHAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   American Airlines was forced to call off 16 percent of its 2,250
flights Monday in a dispute with its 9,200 pilots.
</P>
<P>
   American officials, who said they were flooded by public
inquiries, referred all media questions to a recorded message that
said American was shuffling its passengers into later flights or
onto other airlines.
</P>
<P>
   ``American Airlines sincerely regrets that a disagreement
between the company and the Allied Pilots Association has impacted
our customers, and we apologize for the inconvenience,'' said
airlines spokesman Tim Smith on the recording. ``We remain
optimistic that this situation can be settled promptly.''
</P>
<P>
   The recording provided passengers with a toll-free number to
call to check the status of their flights. A customer service
representative who answered the phone reported that, as of Monday
 &UR; afternoon &LR; , none of Tuesday flights had been canceled.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Jones, an American Airlines passenger whose flight to Lima
from Boston's Logan International Airport was canceled Monday, said
he didn't buy that message. The airline Monday shifted his travel
to a Delta Air Lines flight leaving Boston three hours after his
original flight was supposed to depart and gave him a $15 dinner
voucher.
</P>
<P>
   But that did not persuade Jones, a computer consultant from
Middleton, to keep his Thursday return flight to Boston on
American. After switching his return flight to Continental
Airlines, Jones said: ``I'm not sure these guys will have it
straightened out by Thursday.''
</P>
<P>
   An American Airlines ticket agent said rescheduling passengers
was not a problem Monday because of relatively slow travel traffic.
But, he added, if problems persist into next week, passengers could
face havoc finding alternative flights during the busy school
vacation week.
</P>
<P>
   American was forced to cancel flights throughout the weekend as
pilots called in sick or refused to work overtime to register their
unhappiness with AMR Corp., the Fort Worth-based parent company of
American.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Allied Pilots Association, which represents
American Airlines pilots, said the pilots' dispute centers around
American's refusal to give equal pay to pilots of Reno Air, a West
Coast carrier purchased by AMR late last year. Pilots of Reno Air
earn roughly half of the $150,000 average annual salary of American
pilots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our fondest hope is that we get things resolved quickly,''
said Gregg Overman, aunion spokesman. ``We don't like to see our
passengers caught in the middle of the dispute.''
</P>
<P>
   Overman, however, said the airline has not responded to the
union's overtures to negotiate a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of AMR Corp. fell 2 15/16 Monday to close at 57.

   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton will bang no bongo drum.
</P>
<P>
   When his impeachment trial ends _ probably later this week and
almost certainly in acquittal _ Clinton will not surround himself
with grinning Democrats and declare himself exonerated, his aides
say.
</P>
<P>
   And, notwithstanding any past exuberance by this serial
political escapist, count on this: He will not be glimpsed in
public over the weekend chewing a cigar.
</P>
<P>
   With Republican Congressmen fretting that Clinton will ballyhoo
the outcome of his trial, his aides have begun debating whether he
should say anything at all after the Senate votes on two articles
of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   That debate is a proxy for a broader discussion over how Clinton
should act in public _ and govern _ after the trial ends, but while
the cloud of impeachment, lies and proven caddishness lingers.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Lockhart, the president's spokesman, has declared the White
House a ``gloat-free zone,'' and he insisted no one would feel
jolly, only relieved.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing to celebrate here,'' Paul Begala, the
president's counselor, said Monday. ``Saying that you win this is
like saying you win an earthquake. You survive it and you
rebuild.''
</P>
<P>
   But some Clinton advisers are bemoaning two trips the president
plans to make shortly after the expected vote _ first to Mexico
(``All right, tequila!'' declared one Clinton adviser, doing a
passable Clinton imitation) and then to New Hampshire to rally
Democrats. No matter what the president says or does, some aides
believe, critics will complain that he does not seem contrite
enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``What can he do?'' one senior aide asked, insisting that
Clinton recognized the error of his ways. ``It's almost as if
people want him to curl up in a ball and be catatonic.''
</P>
<P>
   Another aide, speaking on condition of anonymity, said: ``We're
just going to get pounded. There's nothing we can do about it. And
we're probably going to drop in the polls, too, because a lot of
the people who are for us now just hate what's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   The image of Clinton as snickering scapegrace, reveling like
Bugs Bunny in the flummoxing of his pursuers, has become embedded
not only in Congress but also in the popular culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a gloating dance!'' an actor portraying Clinton
insisted last weekend on the NBC program ``Saturday Night Live,''
as a comedian playing his secretary, Betty Currie, boogied in the
Oval Office. ``It is a serious dance of soul-searching and
contrition.''
</P>
<P>
   As usual, Clinton has no one to blame but himself, or his
Republican critics, depending on one's point of view.
</P>
<P>
   Last April, after a federal judge threw out Paula Corbin Jones'
sexual misconduct lawsuit against the president, he was
photographed through a hotel window in Dakar, Senegal, with an
unlighted cigar in his mouth and a bongo drum in his hands.
</P>
<P>
   The president was just examining native wares as he did some
private shopping, aides said. But the drum has become a metaphor,
often invoked these days on Capitol Hill, for Clintonian gloating.
</P>

<P>
   Senate Republicans and even some Democrats also complain about
what they call Clinton's ``pep rally'' on the White House lawn
after he was impeached on Dec. 19. Clinton stood before two
busloads of applauding Democratic members of Congress to say that
he accepted ``responsibility for what I did wrong in my personal
life'' but that he intended to serve ``until the last hour of the
last day of my term.''
</P>
<P>
   The event's tone was actually fairly somber. The conservative
American Spectator editorialized this month that it was ``more like
a wake where sadness was diluted by consternation owing to the
corpse's insistence that he be allowed to mix with the bereaved.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was trying to underscore the partisan nature of the
split impeachment vote in the House of Representatives. He also
wanted to demonstrate that he had political support against the
argument that because he had been impeached, he should resign.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's aides claim that Republicans are misrepresenting the
lawn event as a pep rally so they can build support for a strong
censure resolution, even though some Democrats have taken the same
view.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans have been using this for political cover,''
Lockhart said. ``It's an easier argument than saying, `We have to
punish him because we like to punish him.'''
</P>
<P>
   Some of Clinton's advisers are also interested in punishment.
Indeed, besides exhaustion, one emotion that is likely to snuff
elation is the anger some feel toward House Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not on the forgive-and-forget battalion,'' said James
Carville, Clinton's one-time campaign manager. ``I'll go ahead and
let the true visionaries move on to the next millennium. I have
some unfinished business in this one.''
</P>
<P>
   Carville cautioned that the end of the trial did not mean the
end of the controversy surrounding Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``It ain't over till it's over, that's No. 1,'' he said, ``and
No. 2, it'll never be over.''

BRUINS HOPE WESTWARD SWING WILL BE REFRESHING

 c.1999 The Boston Globe

<P>
   EDMONTON, Alberta _ Last fall, when the Bruins left town with a
goal of taming the West, it was nearly a three-week journey that,
because of the Olympics, combined what is normally two trips, in
October and February.
</P>
<P>
   Their 6-2-0 showing set them up favorably for the rest of the
regular season.
</P>
<P>
   This year, with a normal schedule, the Bruins are hoping to use
a three-game swing to turn their fortunes around.
</P>
<P>
   This area has been rather prosperous for the Bruins in the
1990s. Beginning with the 1990-91 season, Boston has played 21
games in Edmonton, Calgary, and Vancouver and has gone 12-7-2,
including a mark of 7-2-0 over the last three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   After winning just one game in their last nine (1-6-2), the
Bruins were looking forward to heading out on the road. Life is
simpler, there are no distractions, and they don't feel compelled
to put on a show. That's the home team's job.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very big,'' said right wing Rob DiMaio, who hails from
Calgary. ``These are three solid road games we have to put
together. It could do a lot for our confidence if we come back
successful from this road trip and gain some ground as opposed to
losing ground on some teams. I think everyone understands how
important it is.''
</P>
<P>
   The last couple of weeks has been a grueling stretch for the
Bruins, who arrived here Monday after playing four games in six
days. Beginning with Tuesday night's contest against the Oilers,
the Bruins will play three games in five nights before heading
home.
</P>
<P>
   After going winless in eight, Boston has a modest unbeaten
streak going _ 1-0-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three out of four points on the weekend is good,'' said Ray
Bourque, referring to a 2-2 tie with Philadelphia and a
heart-in-your-mouth 3-2 victory over the Rangers. ``It wasn't an
easy win. We were in pretty good shape, up, 2-0, and then Brian
Leetch scores a nice goal and then they get a fluky bounce and then
it's a tie game. It was nice to see Joe (Thornton) score the winner
and things break our way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're looking forward to the challenge. We're all
aware of where we are right now at this time in the standings.
Going on the road can be a good thing for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Thornton has stepped up his play a great deal lately. That has
coincided with the top line of Jason Allison, Sergei Samsonov, and
Dmitri Khristich getting back on track after a significant period
of struggling.
</P>
<P>
   If there remains a weak point with the Bruins, it's the
inability to hold a lead. Last year, the club was remarkably
reliable when ahead going into the third period. This year, it's
been one adventure after another.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, it's like you don't feel you have a big enough lead
at any time in the game,'' said Bourque. ``We're up, 2-0 (against
the Rangers), then it's 2-1 and we were thinking, `Come on, let's
get that third one and make it a little bit easier on ourselves.'
Then they tie it up but you've got to try to stay positive and
believe things are going to go your way and they did.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the record hasn't shown it, Bourque said the turnaround
has been coming for a while.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at the last 10 days where we did play well _ the New
Jersey game (a 2-0 loss), the Carolina game (a 0-0 tie), the
Colorado game (a 3-2 loss) and in Philly, and they were all games
where we stuck to basics and did the little things really well and
especially away from the puck,'' he said. ``(Against New York), we
played pretty well, but their first goal, it was a mis-coverage and
a point guy jumps in.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to be focused, you've got to be on, you've got to
be aware of what's going on at all times. When we're sharp, we pick
up those guys. We don't give up any real quality chances. The games
I mentioned, we did that really well, so by doing that you give
yourself a good chance to win. Obviously, you have to score goals
to capitalize on playing that way, but the goals are going to
come.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been times _ too many _ when one group of players
might be performing well on a given night but others have had an
off-night. The games in which everyone plays together for the whole
contest have been very few and far between.
</P>
<P>
   The talent on offense has proven thin, and the defense, partly
because of age and injury, has been even thinner at times. So
Thornton stepping up would give the Bruins a sorely needed
dimension. Because he's still only 19, it's unrealistic to think he
can do it every night, but if he does it more often than not, the
team will breathe much easier.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a good player,'' said DiMaio. ``When he has the
confidence, he can do a lot of good things. It was good to see. I'm
sure he likes to be in that situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Bourque was impressed with the youngster Sunday, both on his
winning goal and with the way he played against Wayne Gretzky in
the first period while Tim Taylor was taking stitches for a facial
laceration.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's matured a lot and his game has matured a lot,'' Bourque
said. ``He's doing a lot of little things consistently well. He's
taking charge out there a lot more than he did last year. He wants
it. He was into it, you could see it. He wanted to make a
difference and he went out and certainly did that.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether Sunday's finish is the beginning of a positive trend
will better be answered Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's turning a little bit now for us,'' said DiMaio. ``Things
are getting better.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Iris Murdoch, a prodigiously inventive and idiosyncratic British
writer whose 26 novels offered lively plots, complex characters and
intellectual speculation, died Monday at a nursing home in Oxford,
England. She was 79 and had Alzheimer's disease.
</P>
<P>
   Her struggle with Alzheimer's was documented recently in ``Elegy
for Iris,'' a memoir by her husband, the critic and novelist John
Bayley, who was at her bedside when she died.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Murdoch's first novel was published in 1954 and in a career
that lasted for more than four decades, her fiction received many
honors, including the Booker Prize for ``The Sea, the Sea,'' the
Whitbread Literary Award for Fiction for ``The Sacred and Profane
Love Machine'' and the James Tait Black Memorial Prize for ``The
Black Prince.'' Although she was made a Dame of the British Empire,
she rarely garnered the attention given to gaudier contemporaries.
She spent much of her career quietly teaching and writing, away
from lecture tours, prize committees and television appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Along with novels, she produced a half a dozen works on
philosophy, several plays, critical writing on literature and
modern ideas and poetry.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Murdoch had a background in philosophy _ she knew and wrote
about Jean-Paul Sartre, studied with Ludwig Wittgenstein and was a
lecturer in philosophy at Oxford University _ and her fiction
grappled with such questions as the nature of good and evil. This
led many who knew her work superficially to assume that her novels
were philosophical explorations of the origins of morality and
behavior and too esoteric or intellectually rigorous for a general
audience.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, many of Miss Murdoch's novels are exuberantly
melodramatic, offering bemused records of romantic or erotic
follies, as well as more somber battles between individuals
representing moral good and its opposite. Her characters, drawn
largely from the middle class, are described with loving exactitude
and in such depth that their struggles to define what it means to
live a good life take on dramatic force.
</P>
<P>
   Far from viewing fiction as another and lesser way of dealing
with philosophical questions, Miss Murdoch argued that literature
was meant ``to be grasped by enjoyment,'' and that the art of the
tale was ``a fundamental form of thought'' in its own right. The
ideal reader, she told one interviewer, was ``someone who likes a
jolly good yarn and enjoys thinking about the book as well, about
the moral issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Her belief in literature had its inception in her happy and
book-filled childhood. Jean Iris Murdoch was born in Dublin,
Ireland, on July 15, 1919, the only child of Anglo-Irish parents.
When she was a year old her family moved to London, where her
father, Wills John Hughes Murdoch, joined the civil service. In
interviews, she remembered that as a child she had existed ``in a
perfect trinity of love.'' Her mother, the former Irene Alice
Richardson, who had trained as an opera singer, was a ``beautiful,
lively, witty woman with a happy temperament.''
</P>
<P>
   Her father began discussing books with her early on and
encouraged her to read widely. She progressed rapidly from Lewis
Carroll (one of her favorites) and Robert Louis Stevenson to more
adult fare. Her great pleasure in reading, and her early attempts
to write stories led to the conviction, which she formed as a
child, that she would become a writer.
</P>
<P>
   She attended boarding school in Bristol, and in 1938 entered
Somerville College, a women's college at Oxford, where she studied
the classics, ancient history and philosophy. She graduated with
honors in 1942 and immediately took a job with the Treasury. In
1944, she began working for the U.N. Relief and Rehabilitation
Administration, which helped Europeans displaced by World War II.
The somber experiences of the war had a profound impact on her
thinking. Close friends died while in service, and her work, often
on the front lines, with poor and elderly refugees was hard but
instructive.
</P>
<P>
   If her childhood had been mostly idyllic, there was, she later
noted, at least one shadow falling across her memories of those
years: Her family members were largely ``wanderers,'' cut off from
their Irish relations and their roots. Working with refugees led
her to reflect further on the place of the exile in modern society,
as well as on the sources of evil, raising questions that she would
pursue in many novels.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving the United Nations, Miss Murdoch took up further
study in philosophy at Cambridge University, where she worked with
Wittgenstein. While she expressed no lasting allegiance to his
school of thought, she said her studies with him spurred her
development as a writer.
</P>
<P>
   In 1948, she became a fellow and tutor at St. Anne's College at
Oxford, where she remained for 15 years as a lecturer in
philosophy. It was a particularly heady time for anyone concerned
with the study and application of philosophical thought; new
schools of philosophy were contending for primacy and often
combative works were being produced to define these emerging
disciplines.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Murdoch had met Sartre, the most visible proponent of
existentialism, while working with refugees in Belgium.
Existentialism, with its focus on individual will, appealed to her,
but she found its emphasis on the primacy of the self disturbing.
Her first published work, ``Sartre: Romantic Rationalist'' (1953),
was a serious, clear explanation of existentialism and its place in
contemporary thought. While it was balanced, it was not uncritical:
Miss Murdoch felt that existentialism encouraged an almost hermetic
focus on the self, ignoring the corrosive implications of such an
perspective on society.
</P>
<P>
   Her study paid special attention to Sartre's fiction. She had
already written and discarded several novels, but now she had
become absorbed with how fiction expressed ideas and the ways
fiction and ideas could best be blended. ``Under the Net,'' her
first published novel, appeared to generally positive reviews. It
focused on the picaresque adventures of a free-spirited Irishman
making the rounds of some of the more raffish areas of London and
Paris. A reviewer in the Times Literary Supplement said the work
seemed to announce the emergence of ``a brilliant talent.''
</P>
<P>
   The novel signaled the beginning of an industrious and prolific
career. Miss Murdoch published, on average, a novel every two years
for the next four decades. Her work, while varied in setting and
tone, rarely moved far from several central preoccupations and
themes.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Murdoch lived for many years in the small village of
Steeple Aston, close to Oxford, in a house crowded with books and
paintings. The quiet life there, and in the house in Oxford to
which she moved in 1986, has been described memorably by her
husband, an Oxford don and respected literary scholar, in ``Elegy
for Iris,'' his memoir of their lives together.
</P>
<P>
   John Bayley fell in love with Iris Murdoch when he was in his
late 20s and she was in her early 30s; she passed his window on a
bicycle. ``I indulged the momentary fantasy that nothing had ever
happened to her; that she was simply bicycling about, waiting for
me to arrive,'' he wrote. ``She was not a woman with a past or an
unknown present.''
</P>
<P>
   They were married in 1956; he is her only close survivor.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Miss Murdoch first encountered existentialist writings while
working with refugees, and she drew deeply from her fascination
with those experiences in her second novel, ``Flight From the
Enchanter'' (1956). It concerns the well-intentioned,
conventionally liberal Rose Keep, who attempts to offer solace to
two Polish brothers, refugees from the war. Her efforts founder
because she cannot see the brothers as something more than symbols
of displaced, wounded humanity.
</P>
<P>
   The double-edged nature of love figures often in Miss Murdoch's
fiction. True love, she asserted in the essay ``The Sublime and the
Good,'' was perhaps the best way to overcome isolation and the
absorption with one's crippled and constricted self. ``Love is the
extremely difficult realization that something other than oneself
is real,'' she argued.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the figures in her fourth novel, ``The Bell'' (1958),
are crippled by their inability to clearly see, and thus to truly
love, those around them. ``The Bell'' reached a new level of
sophistication for Miss Murdoch, displaying elements that would
become hallmarks of her fiction: effortless shifting between the
grim and the humorous; deft marshaling of a large, varied cast of
characters and numerous subplots, and creation of fables or myths
that could suggest the struggle between true and diminished forms
of love.
</P>
<P>
   In many of Miss Murdoch's novels, romantic disasters, suicides
and even murder are set in motion by a character who is brilliant
and ferociously self-absorbed. Such figures, usually men, often go
beyond egotism into evil. In ``A Fairly Honorable Defeat'' (1970),
a biologist who helps create biological weapons sets out to destroy
those around him. But goodness, Miss Murdoch suggests, while
imperiled, is also resilient.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Sacred and Profane Love Machine'' (1974), the only
character who comes close to true altruism is destroyed. But the
novel suggests that her death may have opened the hearts of those
around her to a better, more responsible life.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sea, the Sea'' (1978), which received the Booker Prize, is
considered one of Miss Murdoch's best novels. Its protagonist is
not so much evil as simply self-absorbed and dangerously certain of
his limited view of the world. In ``A Severed Head,'' Miss Murdoch
balanced the demands of telling a story with the even more urgent
need to examine the ways in which the truth of a fleeting
individual life reflects the larger, permanent truths of existence.
``The Red and the Green'' charts the fates of two friends who find
themselves on opposite sides during Ireland's 1916 Easter rebellion
against British rule. ``The Nice and the Good'' follows the efforts
of a decent man to uncover the reasons for a colleague's suicide
and extricate himself from the seamy web of blackmail and the
occult which he uncovers. ``The Italian Girl'' traces the struggle
of a young man to liberate himself from the corrosive effects of
family secrets and a shallow, destructive image of love.
</P>
<P>
   The tension generated by this iconoclastic approach to fiction
has made Murdoch's novels both unique and controversial. Her
determination to create fiction that could sustain both the usual
elements of a tale, including distinct, varied and convincing
characters, a succession of vivid events, and climactic resolutions
and revelations, as well as a sustained, sophisticated inquiry into
such things as the defining characteristics of true goodness, the
nature of morality, the place of faith in everyday life, and the
conflict between spiritual and carnal love all worked to give her
fiction a distinctive texture and vigor.
</P>
<P>
   When most other writers were content to dwell on the heated
specifics of individual lives or to simply offer a catalogue of
society's ills, Miss Murdoch dared to suggest that fiction should
be a means of dealing with life's largest and most basic issues,
and a way to learn from that exploration what moral behavior should
be.
</P>
<P>
   This quest ``for a passion beyond any center of self,'' as David
Bromwich noted in The New York Times Book Review, made her fiction
unlike that of any other contemporary Western writer. It also let
her in for both considerable acclaim and criticism. Harold Bloom,
while praising her ``formidable combination of intellectual drive
and storytelling exuberance'' in a review of her novel ``The Good
Apprentice,'' in The New York Times, and noting her ``mastery'' in
``representing the maelstrom of falling in love,'' also found that
her narrative voice often lacked authority, ``being too qualified
and fussy.''
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Burgess, while noting the highly original ``synthesis of
the traditional and revolutionary'' in her work and praising her
talent for creating stories that were ``both thoroughly realistic
yet at the same time loaded with symbols,'' also argued that her
characters were too often ``caught up in a purely intellectual
pattern.'' In a memorable phrase, he contended that, while Miss
Murdoch had a rare ability ``to dredge that world of the strange
and mysterious'' which rested ``on the boundary of the ordinary,''
her work rarely offered a convincing portrait of the more common
realms of life.
</P>
<P>
   In a body of work so large, both admirers and critics were bound
to find material to advance their arguments, and this was true as
well in her later novels, such as ``The Message to the Planet''
(1989) and ``The Green Knight'' (1994).
</P>
<P>
   But neither criticism nor praise seemed much to affect her. She
said that she never read her reviews. She rarely read modern
writers, preferring the British and European novelists of the 19th
century (Jane Austen, Charles Dickens, George Eliot, Henry James,
Tolstoy and Dostoyevsky) with whom she felt a special affinity,
describing them as ``moralistic writers who portray the complexity
of morality and the difficulty of being good.''

</P>
<P>
   The novelist Mary Gordon, reviewing ``Elegy for Iris,'' touched
on their relationship. ``Radical privacy, sealing compartments of
her life off from each other, was always a condition of Iris
Murdoch's selfhood, and anyone who married her had to deal with
that. From the beginning, she had friendships that she kept from
Bayley, and love affairs that he was meant to understand had
nothing to do with him. There are some hints that this was not
always easy, but Bayley rose to the challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In early days, I always thought it would be vulgar _ as well
as not my place _ to give any indications of jealousy,'' he wrote,
``but she knew when it was there, and she soothed it just by being
the self she always was with me, which I soon knew to be wholly and
entirely different from any way that she was with other people.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, she told an interviewer that she was experiencing
severe writer's block, noting that the struggle to write had left
her in ``a hard, dark place.'' In 1996 Bayley announced that she
had Alzheimer's disease. If ``Elegy for Iris'' offers a moving
evocation of a great love story, it also provides a grim record of
watching the personality of a loved one gradually dwindling under
the burden of fear, bafflement and grief.
</P>
<P>
   She was, Miss Murdoch confided to one of her friends, ``sailing
into the darkness.'' Bayley's descriptions of his struggle to
understand his wife's suffering, to find ways to ameliorate it, and
to come to grips with both the physical demands of his new
responsibilities and to understand the conflicting emotions aroused
in him by the experience are exact, penetrating and unsparing. Miss
Murdoch became like ``a very nice 3-year-old,'' her husband said,
and she needed to be fed, bathed and changed.
</P>
<P>
   The note on which the book concludes, however, is one of
reconciliation, and of a painfully won serenity. ``Every day,''
Bayley wrote of their lives together in Iris Murdoch's last years,
``we are physically closer. ... She is not sailing into the dark:
The voyage is over, and under the dark escort of Alzheimer's, she
has arrived somewhere. So have I.''

NEW US ANTIDRUG STRATEGY HIT BY CRITICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LOUISE D. PALMER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The White House, unveiling its latest antidrug
strategy Monday, promised a new approach, a novel vision, and more
money _ $17.8 billion _ but critics charged it is a repackaging of
failed policies of the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must mount an all-out effort to banish crime, drugs and
disorder and hopelessness from our streets once and for all,'' said
Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Health policy advocates said they supported the effort _ and the
overall thrust of the adminstration's five-part strategy _ but they
criticized the administration's attempt to make it seem
significantly more money is being dedicated to drug abuse
prevention and treatment.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Clinton administration proposed spending the same
two-thirds of the drug control budget on domestic and international
law enforcement efforts this year as it did last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a betrayal of what the White House says it's doing,
promising a balanced strategy when it is lopsided,'' said Eric
Sterling, former counsel to the House Judiciary Committee and
president of the Criminal Justice Policy Foundation, a Washington
research group.
</P>
<P>
   Sterling said the government was ignoring its own research,
citing a Rand Corp. study that showed prevention and treatment
were, dollar for dollar, the best way to cut down drug abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Coinciding with the administration's announcement was the
release of a Boston University School of Public Health survey of
1,500 community leaders working to reduce substance abuse around
the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The study found that those surveyed, while supporting a strong
law enforcement presence, called for a change in federal policies
and reversal of spending priorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a disconnect between what leaders see as necessary to
help their communities and what they see coming out of
Washington,'' said David L. Rosenbloom, director of Join Together,
BU's anti-substance abuse initiative.
</P>
<P>
   It is easier and more effective to focus on preventing and
curing drug abuse rather than on halting the flow of drugs into the
country or on criminalizing substance abuse, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said the new strategy would give a boost to programs that
worked and repair those that didn't by establishing new standards
to measure successs and failure. Another cornerstone of the
strategy is the $195 million anti-drug advertising campaign
launched this year, as well as a program to funnel more money into
drug treatment in prisons.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's plan involves a five-prong approach:
educating children, decreasing the addicted population, breaking
the cycle of drugs and crime, securing the nation's borders from
drugs and reducing the drug supply.
</P>
<P>
   The blend of strategies is aimed at reducing the use and
availability of drugs by 25 percent by 2002 and 50 percent by 2007.
</P>
<P>
   Additional goals for the period ending in 2007 are to reduce by
30 percent the rate of crime associated with drug trafficking and
use, and cutting the health and social costs associated with drugs
by 25 percent. As of 1995, the social costs of drug use were
estimated at $110 billion, a 64 percent increase over 1990.
</P>
<P>
   White House drug policy director Barry McCaffrey also lauded the
administration's success in the war against drugs, noting that
cocaine crop production had fallen in South America and drug use by
adults is at half what it was in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   National surveys, however, show drug use among youth aged 12-18
has climbed steadily since 1992, and only began to level off last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Not all avocates were critical of the plan. Arthur T. Dean,
president of the Community Anti-Drug Coalitions of America, which
represents 4,000 groups around the nation, said the new budget
shows the administration is starting to listen to advocates who
work to battle drug addiction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very pleased with this truly comprehensive approach,
which laid out prevention and treatment as well as supply
reduction,'' he said. ``I see a shift and a recognition that demand
reduction is the key element in the strategy.''

 &HT;    Computer Generation Inc. gets Bahrainian investor
 &HT;    By Maria Saporta
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A Middle East investment bank has acquired a
``substantial interest'' in Computer Generation Inc., and the
infusion of capital will fuel an aggressive acquisition program for
the Atlanta telecommunications company.
</P>
<P>
   Crescent Capital Investments Inc., the Atlanta-based subsidiary
of Bahrain-based First Islamic Investment Bank, paid about $175
million for an unspecified stake in Computer Generation. Jackie
Ward, CEO, said she remains the largest individual shareholder in
Computer Generation, but ``as a group, they will own more.'' Ward
said she will continue as CEO, a position she has held since 1970.
</P>
<P>
   Ward is one of the few women in Georgia to head a major company
and in 1997 she became the only woman to serve as chairman of the
Metro Atlanta Chamber of Commerce. She is a director of BankAmerica
Corp., Premier Technologies Inc., Equifax Inc., SCI Systems, TRIGON
(Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Virginia and Matria Healthcare.
</P>
<P>
   Computer Generation, founded in 1968, makes telecommunications
hardware and software, primarily for the telephone industry. The
company had estimated 1997 revenue between $75 million and $99
million, according to a list of privately held firms compiled last
fall for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution by Arthur Anderson LLP.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jackie will continue to be the strategic leader of the
company,'' said David Crosland, president of Crescent Capital and
an executive of First Islamic Investment Bank. ``This is her
company of 30 years, and the most important thing to Jackie was the
well-being of her employees.''
</P>
<P>
   The business combination will allow Computer Generation to
inaugurate a stock option plan for employees. Ward said the option
program ``will help CGI grow by enabling the company to retain and
recruit personnel.''
</P>
<P>
   Ward said she agreed to the transaction so that Computer
Generation would have the capital to embark on an aggressive
acquisition program. ``We are in an acquisition mode _ domestically
and internationally,'' Ward said. ``We don't want capital
restraints in our quest of putting together the organization that
will be the leader in our markets.''
</P>
<P>
   Ward said Crescent Capital and Computer Generation are
``evaluating several intriguing acquisitions'' that would expand
the company's products and presence in its markets.
</P>
<P>
   First Islamic was founded in June 1997 by prominent individuals
in the Middle East, who initially invested $100 million in the
bank. This is the second major transaction for Crescent Capital,
which purchased Watermark, a kayak and canoe manufacturer, in July
1998 for $40 million. Crosland met Ward at an Atlanta Chamber event
and explained that he was interested in joining with companies run
by founding shareholders. Ward and Crosland started exploratory
talks last March.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are focused on doing transactions in the Southeast,''
Crosland said. ``We are looking to do transactions in the middle
market _ $50 million to $300 million.''

   Canada Wants to Speed Airport Clearance &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   International travelers passing through some of Canada's major
airports to the United States may soon have fewer bureaucratic
hurdles to jump.
</P>
<P>
   Under a recently introduced Canadian bill called the
Preclearance Act, which would expand the scope of existing law, air
travelers would no longer be required to clear Canadian customs for
connecting flights to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation is awaiting a vote in the Senate and would then
have to be considered by the House of Commons, but it is widely
expected to gain government approval this spring.
</P>
<P>
   It is based on a one-year pilot project at Vancouver
International Airport that enabled more than 70,000 passengers
bound for the United States to bypass Canadian customs and
immigration checks and proceed directly to American officials at
that airport.
</P>
<P>
   The streamlined process makes it faster and easier for a
traveler returning to the United States from Asia to land in
Vancouver and catch a connecting flight. He only needs to show his
passport to American officials before boarding.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, some non-Americans even needed a Canadian visa just
to walk to the boarding gate.
</P>
<P>
   Pearson International Airport in Toronto and the Aeroport de
Montreal (Dorval) expect to implement the program this year, once
the legislation is passed. Airports in Calgary, Edmonton, Ottawa
and Winnipeg would be eligible for this so-called preclearance
after 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement is expected to be reciprocal in the United
States, once inconsistencies in American immigration and Customs
laws are worked out. Then Canadian officials at United States
airports could ease entry into Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The creation of preclearance facilities in San Francisco and
Anchorage are being discussed by officials of the two nations.

   On the Las Vegas Strip, Luxury but No Casino &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With 3,000-room casino hotels sprouting up along the Strip in
Las Vegas, a new 424-room hotel with no gambling areas in this
valley of the giants might seem curious. But the Four Seasons, a
luxury hotel scheduled to open March 2 on Las Vegas Boulevard,
isn't what it seems to be at first glance. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it is a small luxury hotel with no casino, but it shares a
building with the new 3,000-room Mandalay Bay casino hotel. The
Four Seasons' rooms occupy the 35th through the 39th floors, which
will be served by three elevators accessible only with Four Season
room keys. And the Four Seasons will have its own entrance, lobby,
restaurants, spa, meeting rooms and pool (with free cold towels and
spritzing service).
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if the spirit moves, the Mandalay Bay's gambling den
is just down the hall from the Four Seasons' elevators. But the
Mandalay Bay will not give high rollers free lodging in Four
Seasons rooms. Just to make the distinction between the hotels
absolutely clear, the Four Seasons will avoid another favorite
policy of casino hotels: changing the room rates based on demand.
Rooms cost from $200 to $700 a night, suites $400 and up, and those
prices will stay in place all year. &QL;
</P>

Office Box 98881, Las Vegas, Nev. 89193; (877) 632-5200, fax (702)

   Sargent's Elegant World Unfolds in Washington  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The largest retrospective of the work of John Singer Sargent
since 1926, the year after his death, will go on view at the
National Gallery of Art in Washington next Sunday. It brings
together more than 100 paintings and watercolors from museums and
private collections to show his full range: portraits, landscapes,
Impressionist works and figure sketches.
</P>
<P>
   Born in 1856 to American parents living in Florence, Sargent
spent winters in places like Nice and Rome and summers in the Alps
or cities like Biarritz. Sargent studied art in Florence, Dresden,
Berlin and Paris, and his works chronicle the elegance of his age.
</P>
<P>
   He is best known for his portraits, both boldly experimental and
classically formal. Rich and prominent personalities on both sides
of the Atlantic clamored to sit for him. Sargent was acclaimed for
capturing their physical presence, social position and
psychological state.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the notorious ``Madame X,'' the exhibit includes a 1906
self-portrait and a group of works depicting Sargent's illustrious
American contemporaries, like Henry James, John D. Rockefeller and
Frederick Law Olmsted.
</P>
<P>
   Sargent knew most of the Impressionists, and he briefly
experimented with Impressionism in the 1880s. A gallery is devoted
to this period, with works like ``Claude Monet Painting at the Edge
of a Wood'' and ``Paul Helleu Sketching With His Wife.''
</P>
<P>
   Inspired by his extensive travels in Europe, North America and
the Middle East, Sargent painted many landscapes. Among those on
view are ``Corner of the Church of San Stae, Venice'' and ``The
Rialto, Venice.''
</P>
<P>
   Sargent made watercolors mostly for his own amusement, never
trying to sell them. He nevertheless gained fame in the medium when
the Brooklyn Museum and Museum of Fine Arts in Boston made large
purchases in 1909 and 1912, represented here by examples like ``On
the Grand Canal'' and ``Graveyard in the Tyrol.''
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition remains at the National Gallery's West Building
until May 31, then travels to the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston
June 23 to Sept. 26.
</P>
<P>
   The National Gallery of Art, Constitution Avenue, N.W., between
Third and Seventh Streets, is open Monday to Saturday 10 a.m. to 5
p.m., and Sunday 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission is free.

SPORTS COLUMN: TOUGH TIGHTROPE FOR TOM THE TUTOR  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVE ANDERSON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Tom Seaver was back where he belonged, in Shea
Stadium. He wasn't where he really belonged, of course, on the
mound. But at age 54, he was finally working for the Mets again.
And now, in the Diamond Club upstairs, he was being formally
introduced as the Mets' new part-time broadcaster, part-time
marketing ambassador and part-time professor of pitching.
</P>
<P>
   Other than to say, ``Criticism in the booth goes along with
being positive when the team is doing well ... there's a difference
between being a network and hometown broadcaster,'' and ``Tim
McCarver is a darn good broadcaster, a fans' favorite and a good
guy,'' he hardly talked about how he hoped to succeed McCarver in
the Mets' television booth.
</P>
<P>
   And if he has a marketing plan, he didn't mention it.
</P>
<P>
   But the more the Hall of Famer once known as Tom Terrific talked
Monday, the more he sounded as if he hoped to be known primarily to
these Mets, especially their young and impressionable pitchers, as
Tom the Tutor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be involved in the pitching,'' he said. ``I get a
joy out of it. I want to be available to help them. I loved what I
did, and I was darned good at it. One of the responsibilities we
have is to pass along our knowledge.''
</P>
<P>
   It could be a tough tightrope to walk. He's not the manager;
Bobby Valentine is. He's not the pitching coach; Bob Apodaca is.
He's not the minor league pitching coach; Al Jackson is.
</P>
<P>
   But he's Tom Seaver, who won 311 games with a career 2.86 earned
run average and 3,640 strikeouts, who was voted three Cy Young
awards, who had a 25-7 record in 1969 when those Miracle Mets won
the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   So he knows what he'll be talking about. He also knows he'll be
talking to his baseball descendants _ Mets pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wouldn't work if I tried to do this with the San Francisco
Giants; there's no bond there,'' he said. ``I will be forever
etched in New York City. I will be forever etched with the New York
Mets. You go to the Hall of Fame because of what you did in a
certain city with a certain organization. That organization is
tattooed to your heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Seaver knows the tightrope is there. But as an ex-Marine, he
professes to understand the chain of command.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm not on the same page as the manager and the pitching
coach,'' he said, ``I'll only confuse the kid.''
</P>
<P>
   He knows there's more to pitching in the big leagues than a good
fastball or slider. He remembered the late Gil Hodges, then the
Mets' manager, teaching him that in 1968 after the Mets had held on
for a 7-6 victory after he had nearly blown a 7-0 lead against
Willie Mays, Willie McCovey and the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gil was huge, with those big hands; he could really put the
fear of God in you,'' Seaver said. ``He called me into his office
and told me, `Close the door.'
</P>
<P>
   ``He was sitting behind his desk, and he told me, `You acted
very unprofessional in your approach to this game.' To use my
mother's phrase, I had gotten too big for my britches. Then he
said, `For the rest of your career, I don't care if there's 5,000
or 50,000 people in the ball park, if it's Tuesday in Los Angeles
or Saturday in Wrigley Field, if we've got a 19{-game lead or a
half-game lead, your effort on the field should be exactly the
same.'''
</P>
<P>
   Seaver added: ``I benefited from that lesson for 19 years. I
learned from that. That's a huge issue with me. Everybody makes
mistakes. It's when you don't learn from your mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Seaver passed that lesson along to a young member of the Chicago
White Sox, whom he declined to identify, after the Mets lost their
most famous pitcher in the 1984 free-agent compensation pool draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``This young player had acted very unprofessional on the
field,'' he recalled. ``In the runway to the clubhouse, I
confronted him. I picked him up by his jersey, slammed him against
the wall and told him, `Don't you ever conduct yourself on the
field like that again.' He hasn't. And every time he sees me, he
gives me a big hug.''
</P>
<P>
   But as merely a part-time pitching professor, would Seaver be
able to be that harsh with a young Mets pitcher?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' he said, quickly and firmly. ``If you see a gem of a
player, if you don't do that, it's a disservice to that young man
not to get him back on track.''
</P>
<P>
   Spoken like Tom the Tutor.

HOUSE PROSECUTORS WRAP UP CASE AMID BITTERNESS, FRUSTRATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For weeks, the House managers in President
Clinton's impeachment trial have straddled the line between being
both politicians and prosecutors. But Monday, as they took their
last shot at Clinton in closing statements, their political
frustration seemed to boil over as it looked inevitable they would
lose their case.
</P>
<P>
   Victoria Toensing, a former deputy assistant attorney general in
the Reagan administration, said she became convinced during the
trial that Clinton obstructed justice and should be convicted. But
she said Monday's arguments by the House managers were ineffective
because they seemed more personal than legal.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was all their personal reasons'' for convicting the
president, she said. ``You could see they were expressing their
frustration.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Toensing said, the House managers made a strategic
error by allowing 13 lawmakers to deliver the closing argument,
making it difficult for senators to ``bond'' with a single
prosecutor, an effect lawyers strive for with their most powerful
closing statements. While many of the House managers made
effective, if familiar, arguments, some used their time to complain
about the restrictions imposed on them or the way television
commentators dismissed them.
</P>
<P>
   The task was easier for the lone attorney closing for the White
House, Charles F. C. Ruff, who had every reason to believe he was
about to win the case because the Senate would fall short of the
two-thirds vote necessary to convict the president. Speaking calmly
from his wheelchair, Ruff rebutted the prosecution using charts and
videotape, including the most favorable clip from the Monica S.
Lewinsky testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Ruff spun a series of physical analogies, telling senators that
the prosecution's case was carried in ``empty pots'' and was made
up of ``pillars'' that, he pronounced, the defense had succeeded in
turning into dust.
</P>
<P>
   Laurence Tribe, professor of constitutional law at Harvard Law
School, said before the trial began that Clinton should not be
impeached because the alleged crimes of perjury and obstruction of
justice did not amount to impeachable offenses. But having watched
the trial, Tribe said, he concluded the case was even weaker than
he had thought. Tribe said the White House defense arguments
convinced him that Clinton did not commit perjury, ``although he
came incredibly close,'' and did not obstruct justice.
</P>
<P>
   The managers went into the trial believing they had to clear two
hurdles to win conviction of the president. First, they had to
prove Clinton committed perjury and obstructed justice. Second,
they had to demonstrate that such acts were ``high crimes and
misdemeanors,'' which under the Constitution would lead to a vote
to convict and remove the president.
</P>
<P>
   But Monday, the managers found that the much-esteemed Senator
Robert C. Byrd, the West Virginia Democrat, had added a third
hurdle. Byrd said in an interview aired Sunday that he had ``no
doubt'' Clinton committed high crimes and misdemeanors, but the
issue is whether the president should be removed from office.
</P>
<P>
   ``That . . . does not square with the Constitution or the law,''
an exasperated Representative Stephen Buyer, the Indiana
Republican, told the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Even Tribe, who opposes conviction, said he was dismayed by
Byrd's statement. ``He would violate his constitutional oath if he
were to believe that the president were guilty of these charges,
and these charges were high crimes and misdemeanors,'' and yet vote
against conviction, Tribe said.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the managers' frustration was the growing perception
that a number of Republicans would join Democrats in voting against
the article accusing Clinton of perjury.
</P>
<P>
   As for the obstruction of justice charge, it is unclear whether
at least a majority will back it.
</P>
<P>
   The frustration was most evident when Representative Chris
Cannon, a Utah Republican, used his closing statement to explain
why the managers were likely to lose their case.
</P>
<P>
   ``The managers had to cut very important portions of our limited
case,'' Cannon said. ``We had a limited number of witnesses,
limited videotape appearances.'' Then Cannon went on to blame the
``new media environment, the Internet with its immediate and often
unvetted content, and cable television with its perpetual talking
heads.''
</P>
<P>
   As if to prove Cannon's point, one of those talking heads,
Michael Gerhardt, a College of William and Mary constitutional law
specialist, promptly said on CNN that he noticed ``self-pity on the
part of the managers. Their case lacks a certain coherence today.''

COMMENTARY: BLINDED BY RIGHTEOUSNESS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By ANTHONY LEWIS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Rep. Lindsey Graham's voice trembled as he ended the
Republican prosecutors' presentation of evidence. ``For God's
sake,'' he told the Senate, ``figure out what kind of person we
have here in the White House.''
</P>
<P>
   Why the trembling emotion? Frustration, I think. Graham and the
other Republican managers are true believers. They believe that an
evil president is about to be acquitted of the impeachment charges,
and they cannot understand why.
</P>
<P>
   If they could only see it, one reason is their very certainty:
their absolute conviction that they are right. Most Americans do
not want to be governed by men who know they are always right. We
believe that life has to have room in it for uncertainty, for
change, for mercy.
</P>
<P>
   Americans are wise to be uncomfortable with absolutism. Sir
Isaiah Berlin, the great British historian-philosopher, showed us
that certainty about everything has been the hallmark of
totalitarian movements.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican managers did not understand how their zealotry
troubled their audience. As Philip Stephens of The Financial Times
put it, they were ``blinded by their moral righteousness.''
</P>
<P>
   An uninformed person who wandered into the Senate gallery and
heard the managers excoriating President Clinton might have thought
they were prosecuting him for mass murder. That is how far their
heightened rhetoric was from the reality here: that the president
tried to conceal illicit sex.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans made the same mistake that they and Kenneth
Starr did in videotaping Clinton's Aug. 17 grand jury testimony and
playing it to the country. They thought Americans would be outraged
at the president's sexual misbehavior. Instead they were offended
at the prurient, invasive effort to make a legal mountain out of
his folly. People could imagine themselves in the hands of
relentless partisan prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   There was a moment in Monica Lewinsky's deposition, not much
noticed, that showed how out of touch the Republican managers were
with reality. Rep. Ed Bryant asked her why she wanted to avoid
testifying in the Paula Jones case about her relationship with the
president. Her answer, devastating in its obviousness, was:
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, I thought it was nobody's business. Second of
all, I didn't want anything to do with Paula Jones or her case.''
</P>
<P>
   The managers dripped with sympathy for Ms. Lewinsky. The
president ``threw her life on the ash heap,'' Rep. James Rogan
said. Yes, if Clinton had had the sense to turn away when she first
flirted with him, he would have done himself and her a great favor.
But it was Starr and the House Republicans who made her life into a
public spectacle.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Hyde repeatedly sneered that the Democrats had called
``professors'' to testify, a piece of anti-intellectual demagoguery
worthy of George Wallace. He never mentioned the five career
prosecutors, Democratic and Republican, who said they would never
have prosecuted such a case.
</P>
<P>
   That goes to the heart of the Republican failure here. The
extremists on the House Judiciary Committee insisted that the
president had committed crimes, and that removal from office must
follow. They would not even allow the House to consider the penalty
that would have fit the character of the offense, a censure motion.
</P>
<P>
   The charges of perjury and obstruction of justice are supported
by nothing but surmise and conjecture. As White House counsel
Charles Ruff said, neither charge would survive a motion to dismiss
in any court. But the managers kept saying that they were just
doing their constitutional duty _ as if the Constitution required
them to press a partisan case for impeachment on flimsy grounds.
</P>
<P>
   If the Republican Party wants to win national elections, it is
going to have to do something about the party elements, in and out
of Congress, that took the country into this endless impeachment
process. As the Duke of Wellington said when he looked at some of
his own forces, ``I don't know what effect these men will have on
the enemy, but by God they terrify me.''

   ATLANTA _ Attempts by Atlanta's Olympic insiders to keep their
financial records secret are becoming less and less defensible.
</P>
<P>
   Olympic insiders claim that hundreds of boxes of Olympic files
dating back to the late 1980s cannot be exposed to public scrutiny
because they are still too disorganized.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Payne and his associates also insist that Atlanta's
Olympic bidders did not go over the line in doling out gifts to
members of the International Olympic Committee who voted in 1990 to
award the '96 Games to Atlanta. Presumably, the financial records
would shed some light on such assertions _ but the records are
supposedly too confused for us to look at.
</P>
<P>
   After I wrote last week that such stonewalling seemed outrageous
in light of the fact that other cities evidently have bribed the
IOC, I've learned that the records are better organized than
Olympic insiders have been claiming.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, hundreds of the standard white storage boxes that I
wasn't allowed even to look at from a distance have been cataloged
in an elaborate inventory prepared by Payne's own Olympic
organization.
</P>
<P>
   That organization, remember, had a librarian and an archivist in
addition to many clerks. Of course it's possible that some files
were lost, destroyed or taken home by their authors. Yet hundreds
of boxes of these files (which are said to be owned by the Georgia
Amateur Athletics Foundation and which are now locked up at the
Atlanta History Center) contain folders with ordinary labels and
dates on them. Moreover, these folders are mentioned in detailed
inventories that were originally stored in Olympic computers.
</P>
<P>
   Box No. 1, for example, is said to contain 38 folders from
Payne's files dealing with the Georgia Amateur Athletics Foundation
and the Atlanta Organizing Committee in 1987 and 1988, when Atlanta
was actively bidding for the Games. The inventory of Box No. 1
covers more than one typed page. Inventories of similar boxes cover
hundreds more pages.
</P>
<P>
   Other easily accessible folders contain financial records and
correspondence on topics such as a ``budget summary'' for 1987-91;
a trip to Georgia's Callaway Gardens in 1988; a golf trip to
Augusta, Ga. in 1988 and ``gifts'' in 1989 and 1990.
</P>
<P>
   There was a time, years ago, when the Atlanta Historical Society
(organizational parent of the Atlanta History Center) offered to
store and catalog the whole growing mountain of Olympic records. On
June 17, 1991, the society's acting director, Katharine Farnham,
wrote to Payne's Olympic aide, Ginger Watkins, proposing to
finalize an agreement concerning the records. Farnham also offered
to ``restrict access'' to some of the files. ``Your staff,''
Farnham wrote to Watkins, ``should not feel obligated in any way to
straighten files or weed materials. We will provide this service.''
</P>
<P>
   According to a copy of a related document, Watkins scribbled the
following note to Payne about Farnham's letter:
</P>
<P>
   ``WPP (William Porter Payne) _You started this project. My
discussion with them is that they catalog it _ not release one
paper to the public or anything to the public until after your book
_ But it needs to be cataloged. They will sign confidentiality
agreement and/or will not send over sensitive materials. This is
general history _ rewrite it the way you want it. But someone has
to catalog all the AOC files.''
</P>
<P>
   Below that, Payne has evidently scribbled a response to Watkins:
</P>
<P>
   `` . . . No way _ you must be crazy or drunk. Total files must
be reviewed by us first.''
</P>
<P>
   Payne said Monday that he had ``no recollection'' of this memo.
Watkins did not return a request to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's Olympians have been rather secretive about information
for a long time. Now it's time to make those secret records
generally accessible.
</P>
<P>
   I think it would also be prudent for someone to lock the records
up more securely _ so that even their supposed ``owners'' (the
Georgia Amateur Athletics Foundation) and their lawyers stop
fiddling with them until the principle of public access is
established.

 &HT;    Delta makes on-timely jump to No. 3 in industry
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Call it a worst-to-third performance.
</P>
<P>
   Delta Air Lines jumped from last to third place in on-time
performance among the 10 major carriers in 1998, according to
figures from the U.S. Department of Transportation.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta-based Delta posted a 79.6 percent on-time rate, up from
74.1 percent in 1997. On-time flights are defined as those arriving
within 15 minutes of the scheduled time.
</P>
<P>
   Southwest and American airlines led the industry for the year.
Replacing Delta at the back of the pack was America West, tumbling
from sixth place a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Major airlines collectively posted a 77.2 percent on-time rate,
almost unchanged from 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, airline passengers were angrier, the DOT figures
suggest. Consumer complaints to the agency about the major U.S.
carriers totaled 5,808, or 1.08 per 100,000 passengers, up from
4,550, or 0.86, in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Delta had a complaint rate of 0.79, third-lowest for the second
year in a row. Southwest and Alaska airlines had the lowest rates,
while Northwest brought up the rear with a rate of 2.21.
</P>
<P>
   Delta improved one notch in mishandled baggage, placing fourth
with a rate of 4.27 mishandled bags per 1,000 passengers. In 1997,
it was fifth. America West had the best bag-handling performance,
while United was worst with a rate of 7.79.
</P>
<P>
   The industrywide rate of mishandled bags rose to 5.16 from 4.96.
</P>
<P>
   Delta's new management team promised better on-time performance
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman Bill Berry said one key is a more intense focus on
getting early morning flights out on time, reducing the domino
effect when they run late.
</P>
<P>
   Berry also acknowledged Delta has added time to flight schedules
on some routes. The airline's executives defend the tactic by
saying it's better to extend the schedule than to publish arrival
times that aren't usually met.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Does a people, stymied by prejudice, perpetuate that prejudice
within its own community? Yes, says Lawrence Otis Graham's new
book, ``Our Kind of People: Inside America's Black Upper Class,''
which traces the creation of a separate black elite to slavery
days, and discovers, unsurprisingly, that African-Americans can
still be just as class conscious as white people. U.S. News &AMP; World
Report ($2.95) excerpts the book, in which we meet black Americans
who celebrate such distinctions, and others who seem chagrined, or
at least ambivalent, by the infighting. An Atlanta surgeon claims
he prefers to be referred to as ``working class'' because he
doesn't want to draw the enmity of the larger black population.

other non-musical recording artists such as William Shatner and
Leonard Nimoy, Chopra also lets on that he's done a hip-hop album

MAJORITY LEADER OPPOSES OPENING SENATE DELIBERATIONS ON CLINTON'S
FATE
</HEADLINE>
  (See related stories: IMPEACH-TRIAL, IMPEACH-PERJURY,
IMPEACH-CENSURE, IMPEACH-SCENE, IMPEACH-CLINTON) 
(fe) 
 By FRANK BRUNI  
 
c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority
leader, came out on Monday against opening the Senate's final
deliberations over the charges against President Clinton, virtually
guaranteeing that senators' speeches in the climactic hours of the
trial will be made behind closed doors.
</P>
<P>
   Even before Lott's spokesman, John Czwartacki, announced the
majority leader's position Monday afternoon, proponents of an open
debate acknowledged they were more than a half dozen votes short of
the 67 they needed. They said they had hoped to draw some undecided
Republicans to their side, but Lott's stance made this highly
unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   The vast majority of Democrats support opening the
deliberations, which are expected to begin on Tuesday and last for
two to three days. Most Republicans favor keeping the discussion
closed, and many say they see no reason to let Democrats use oral
condemnations of the president to reduce the political risk of
voting to acquit.
</P>
<P>
   A similar political motive was in play as the effort to reach
agreement on a strong censure resolution faltered. Some Republicans
assailed it as an effort to find political cover, and their threats
of a filibuster and other procedural complications became clearer,
even as the number of senators expressing support for a censure
resolution seemed to grow.
</P>
<P>
   Czwartacki said Lott had decided to oppose opening the
deliberations because he wanted the Senate to adhere to
longstanding rules governing impeachment trials and to an even
longer tradition of allowing juries to hash out the facts _ and
their feelings about them _ in private.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lott has fought to keep as much of this trial in the open as
possible,'' Czwartacki said. ``But now he feels that the Senate
must act like any jury.''
</P>
<P>
   Several Democrats, however, said the Senate is not like a real
jury, a viewpoint that resurrected previous arguments over the
precise roles that senators, as both triers of fact and elected
officials entrusted to safeguard the nation's interests, are
supposed to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't been sequestered in the Hilton Hotel for the last
month and a half,'' said Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn. ``It's kind
of a false argument that we are a jury and these are
deliberations.''
</P>
<P>
   The next phase of the trial, whether open or not, is not
expected to be a free-wheeling, informal back-and-forth between a
panel of peers sifting through the evidence and searching their own
souls. It will probably take the form of a series of formal
speeches, limited to 15 minutes apiece, in which senators state
their views and foreshadow how they will vote on the two articles
of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The final phase _ in which senators cast those votes without
explanation _ will be open.
</P>
<P>
   As the dispute between Republicans and Democrats over
deliberations heated up in the last few days, it was fueled in part
by pure political gamesmanship.
</P>
<P>
   By seeking to open the deliberations, Democrats were looking for
a way to make sure they had a public forum for stating their
disapproval of Clinton's actions.
</P>
<P>
   By seeking to keep the discussion closed, Republicans were
trying to thwart that effort and to prevent Democrats from using
the deliberations for a public attack on the House managers and
their case.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans were far from unified in their views on the
deliberations. One of the most vocal and persistent advocates for
opening the discussion was a Republican, Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison
of Texas, who maintained that the trial was simply too important to
be concluded in secrecy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is historic,'' Mrs. Hutchison said on Monday after
leaving a two-hour Republican caucus devoted almost entirely to a
discussion of the issue. ``I cannot imagine that we would impeach
or not impeach the president of the United States in a closed
session.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Hutchison said she had suggested that the maximum time
allotted for each senator's remarks by reduced to 5 or 10 minutes
from 15. This proposal was intended to allay the concerns of some
fellow Republicans hat open deliberations would prolong the
proceeding because senators would try to maximize their time in the
spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   But she said that, according to her arithmetic, she still had
just 60 supporters in all. Because opening the debate would require
suspending Senate rules, a two-thirds majority, or 67 senators,
would have to vote for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's going to be a high hurdle,'' Mrs. Hutchison said.
</P>
<P>
   Twice during the Senate impeachment trial, senators have moved
to open debates over procedural motions, and twice they have
failed, with most Republicans favoring closed sessions and most
Democrats favoring open ones.
</P>
<P>
   Several Republicans said on Monday that it was partly because
those closed sessions were so productive _ and so free of the
posturing and preening that occur when reporters and television
cameras are in attendance _ that they did not want to open this
final phase. They also noted that opening it would violate
tradition and create a new precedent.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``What I want to do is maintain the sanctity of the interplay
and the discussion,'' said Sen. Larry Craig, R--Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats and some Republicans like Mrs. Hutchison said most
senators, if not all, know how they are going to vote, so the
remarks they make are less important for each other than for the
public.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., noted the cynicism that many Americans
feel about government and said that keeping the discussion closed
``is going to feed the fires of frustration.''
</P>
<P>
   To address many senators' concerns that a closed debate would
leave the formal trial record bereft of explanations about
lawmakers' reasons for their votes, senators suggested a variety of
remedies.
</P>
<P>
   Some senators said they were studying the possibility of a vote,
after the verdict, about making the transcript of their
deliberations public.
</P>
<P>
   Alternately, Czwartacki said that Lott would make a motion,
probably immediately after senators vote, to allow them to submit
written explanations of their decisions to be put into the trial
record. Similar explanations were published after the Senate voted
to acquit Andrew Johnson in 1868.

 &HT;    Daily blackouts cause down time
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The revisions looked right, the spelling had been
checked and double-checked, the whole thing was ready to go.
</P>
<P>
   Move the mouse to print, click once and it was finished. He was
doing just that when, without warning, it disappeared from his
screen. Gone in an instant. Vaporized.
</P>
<P>
   For an 11-year-old, Max Flick is articulate and composed, but
his mother will tell you he wasn't his calm self when the power
went off _ again.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was near tears,'' Beth Flick of Sandy Springs (GA.) says.
</P>
<P>
   Grown men have been awash in them, and not because the Super
Bowl suddenly was something they were going to have to read about
the next day. In some parts of metro Atlanta, momentary power
interruption is a regular occurrence, so regular that many folks
have been keeping logs.
</P>
<P>
   In Debi Schneider's kitchen is a calendar crowded with the usual
reminders _ a Brownies field trip, an appointment with the dentist,
another with the vet, an appliance repairman coming by.
</P>
<P>
   But the most common notations are these:
</P>
<P>
   Jan 10. ``10:20 p.m.''
</P>
<P>
   Jan. 19. ``Sev x.''
</P>
<P>
   Jan. 22. ``Ga. Power (while out)''
</P>
<P>
   Jan. 27. ``1:13 p.m.''
</P>
<P>
   Jan. 31. ``12:19 blink.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And there were a lot I didn't even record,'' Schneider says.
``There were six in one day once.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many these days, Schneider works out of her home, spending
much of her time on a computer and on the Internet. She traces a
person's whereabouts _ an old high school boyfriend, a biological
parent, someone a client knew two marriages and three jobs back.
``One day,'' she says, ``I was on the Internet _ you know how you
have to go through a bunch of steps when you're not sure what
you're looking for _ and I thought I found something. I said, `Oh,
this is good. I've got a lead.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Zap! Off went the power, for just a second but enough to cancel
everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know lightning will strike and a car's going to hit a pole
now and then _ I don't have a problem with that,'' Schneider says.
``I have a problem when it's an almost daily occurrence.''
</P>
<P>
   At Georgia Power's substation in Alpharetta (Ga.), engineer Doug
Bailey has been hearing from people who wonder why the power fails
so often when the skies couldn't be bluer and there's not a storm
within 300 miles.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to realize that a problem for you is not necessarily
a problem for us,'' Bailey says, not quite meaning what his words
suggest.
</P>
<P>
   He means only that an interruption is one thing to Georgia Power
and another to customers. Even so, there are people who are
surprised _ to say the least _ by an explanation like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's outrageous,'' says Janice Levetan, a media specialist
at Spalding Drive Elementary School in Sandy Springs. ``I've talked
with Georgia Power and I don't think they understand how bad the
situation is. Last year we had multiple power failures almost every
single day.''
</P>
<P>
   But she especially remembers one day last month. It was Jan. 19,
a teacher workday. ``We had seven (interruptions) in a row. It kept
going off and on, off and on. Every time it happens we have to
physically remount the servers. The county sent electricians out
last year and they inspected this place with a fine-toothed comb.
The problem's not in the school.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Rivers, a pharmacist at Wender &AMP; Roberts drugstore in the
North Springs Shopping Center, recalls a recent week when ``it went
off almost every day. When it goes down, we can't write
prescriptions. It takes our computer 10 or 15 minutes to reboot.
The insurance guy next door, his takes 45 minutes to reboot. He's
furious.''
</P>
<P>
   To Georgia Power's customers, it's cold comfort to hear that
it's proof that the system is working, the big circuit breakers
functioning according to design. A tree limb is blown onto a power
line and the breakers open. A squirrel ventures where it shouldn't
and again they open, bringing headache for humans and calamity for
a squirrel.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Georgia Power says almost a third _ 31 percent _ of all
interruptions cannot be attributed to weather, to squirrels, to
contractors cutting underground cable or to drivers hitting power
poles. But Bailey and John Gay, a senior engineer, suspect many
interruptions in the unknown category were caused by wind-blown
limbs that briefly touched a power line and then sprang back into
place.
</P>
<P>
   A public utility has easement rights that allow it to trim trees
whose limbs are too close to power lines. But there are a lot of
trees in Atlanta and only so many trimmers. Not only that, but
residents complain loudly. ``A lady told me once, `I don't mind the
blinks, just don't cut my trees,' '' Bailey says.
</P>
<P>
   And if her beautiful trees cause interruptions for others _
well, that's their problem. In the northern suburbs, it's become a
silent civil war. No one's crying ``Power to the People,'' but many
are beyond the tears.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they know what the problem is,'' Schneider says.
``When I called Georgia Power, a guy told me he might find the
cause tomorrow or he might find it five years from now. I don't
think he saw it as a big deal.''

 &HT;    PBS' `The Execution' has few signs of life
 &HT;    By Drew Jubera
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Frontline'' correspondent Alan Austin spent three years
burrowing around the life of death row inmate Clifford Boggess.
Austin believed his digging would take him ``into the heart of the
death penalty in America.'' Austin wanted to learn everything he
could about Boggess and his crime, to finally see ``if it still
made sense to kill him.''
</P>
<P>
   But the result, tonight's well-done but nowhere-leading
90-minute PBS documentary ``The Execution'' (10 p.m. on WGTV ),
never takes us anywhere we haven't been before. The only epiphany
is that there is no epiphany. By the end, there's only the profound
sadness of the victims' survivors, a sadness that makes Austin's
existential musings _ ``Did it make sense to execute Clifford
Boggess? . . . Had the execution actually punished this killer?'' _
feel like a profoundly flimsy copout.
</P>
<P>
   The day after Boggess is executed in Texas by lethal injection,
Austin phones one victim's 97-year-old brother. Austin asks this
man, who'd earlier sobbed at the memory of finding his dead brother
with his chest caved in and his throat cut, what he thinks of
Boggess' execution. The brother is almost disbelieving. ``What do I
think about it?'' he says. ``I think it was OK, don't you? He was
entitled to what he got . . . (it was) too easy compared to what he
did to my brother.''
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to locate the point of ``The Execution,'' other than
the evergreen fascination we have with staring into the face of
this sort of evil _ evil that can paint and play the piano and look
a lot like us.
</P>
<P>
   Austin first finds in Boggess that rare death row inmate willing
to admit his guilt. In 1986, Boggess needed some cash, so he walked
into a store in his hometown of St. Jo, Texas, with a knife he
meant to use, grabbed a few hundred dollars from the cash register,
and cut the throat of the old man he knew working there. He told
his girlfriend about the murder, and she recalls how it made
Boggess ``enjoy sex more. Talking about the sound of the blood; the
feeling of the warm blood.''
</P>
<P>
   Boggess liked it so much, he murdered another elderly shopkeeper
three weeks later. After bragging about it, he was arrested,
convicted and sent to death row.
</P>
<P>
   Austin meets Boggess there and finds him a willing specimen for
inspection. Boggess details the murders. (``I said, `This is it,
Frank.' As I grabbed him around the throat with my arm he said,
`Ooooo.' There was pain in the sound of it that only an old man can
make.'') Austin finds family members who speak of Boggess' abusive
mother, an adoptive mother who regrets her divorce, an uncle who
saw something ``crazy'' in Boggess' eyes early on.
</P>
<P>
   He also speaks to the victims' survivors, who talk of their
lives being shattered forever. When the granddaughter of one victim
writes Boggess and asks him to explain himself, Boggess details his
crime, then lectures her on the nature of forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's in death row and he's preaching to me?'' she exclaims.
</P>
<P>
   Austin is always thorough, always thoughtful. But it's his
journalistic conceit here never to be visceral, and he winds up
seeming as detached from this story's real horror as Boggess was.
So he leaves us empty, let down and feeling a little used.

well: mix comedy and drama at a breakneck pace.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight's ``Sports Night'' (9:30) does move with feverish
adrenaline. It's a tale of love lost and love won as Dana and Casey

once more to snag the pretty woman he's after.

   ``I will not be the subject of your mockery,'' Dan asserts.

 &HT;    Falcons wide receiver indicted by Miami federal court, could
face NFL action
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Atlanta Falcons wide receiver Tony Martin faces severe
disciplinary action from NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue, including
possible banishment from the league, if found guilty of
money-laundering and conspiracy indictments brought against him
Monday in a federal court in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Under investigation by at least three federal agencies for more
than six months, Martin was charged in U.S. District Court for
Southern Florida with five counts of laundering drug-related
revenues for longtime friend and twice-convicted drug trafficker
Rickey Brownlee. Martin, who caught five passes for 79 yards for
the Falcons in Super Bowl XXXIII nine days ago,also was indicted on
one conspiracy charge. He is not accused of any direct involvement
in Brownlee's alleged drug-distribution ring.
</P>
<P>
   The money-laundering charges each carry a maximum sentence of 20
years.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta Journal-Constitution first reported Oct. 21 that
Martin, who came to Atlanta in a June 3 trade with San Diego for a
second-round pick in this year's draft, was under federal
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   While it is unlikely that the league would take any action until
due process is followed in the case, NFL vice president of public
relations Greg Aiello acknowledged that the matter is a serious
one. ``This has been under scrutiny by league security people for
some time now, and we continue to monitor the situation,'' Aiello
said.
</P>
<P>
   Citing several pertinent segments from the NFL Policy Manual for
Players, which was distributed to players before the start of the
1998 season, Aiello conceded that Tagliabue will have wide-ranging
punitive options if Martin is convicted or pleads guilty. According
to the manual, the commissioner ``may impose fines or other
appropriate discipline for conduct detrimental to the integrity of
(the league) or loss of public confidence in the NFL.'' Among the
specific charges that could put Martin under the purview of
Tagliabue is ``improper use or circulation of drugs or other
drug-related misconduct.''
</P>
<P>
   Even his continued association with a known felon could result
in Martin being disciplined by the NFL, Aiello said. Depending on
the resolution of the case, that punishment could be as benign as a
fine or as severe as immediate banishment from the league.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, 33, surrendered early Monday morning to federal officers
in Miami, culminating the grand jury's lengthy investigation into
Brownlee's activities. A nine-year NFL veteran, Martin entered the
courtroom of U.S. Magistrate Judge Barry Garber quietly and in
manacles. He was fingerprinted and photographed before being
released on $250,000 bond. Referring in court to Martin's ``large
salary,'' Assistant U.S. Attorney Ron DeWaard had requested that
bond be set at $1 million. ``There needs to be some bond with bite
in it,'' DeWaard told Garber.
</P>
<P>
   Martin earned a base salary of $1.45 million in 1998 and is
scheduled to make $1.5 million in 1999. The Falcons must pay Martin
a roster bonus of $400,000 on March 1 to retain his services for
1999. It is ancitipated that the Falcons will pay the roster bonus.
</P>
<P>
   The federal indictments allege that Brownlee, currently in the
Miami Federal Detention Center awaiting trial on seven counts of
trafficking dating to 1986, funnelled the drug money to Martin, who
then used it to lease luxury automobiles. The 16-page indictment of
Brownlee, Martin and other associates lists at least three cars
leased by Martin and kept under his registration while being used
by Brownlee.
</P>
<P>
   Brownlee was driving one of those automobiles, a Mercedes
SL-500, when arrested by federal authorities in January of 1998.
The indictment also alleges, citing a March 5 call by Brownlee from
jail, that Martin used drug money to cover a check for $175,000
that he wrote to help fund his friend's defense.
</P>
<P>
   That check was written to Milton Hirsch, then the attorney for
Brownlee. After federal officials subpoenaed Martin's financial
records, he stopped payment on the check, and Hirsch filed sued for
the $175,000. Hirsch dropped the suit when he was forced by the
government to withdraw as Brownlee's counsel.
</P>
<P>
   ``They claimed there was a conflict (of interest) because I
witnessed the alleged act of money-laundering by accepting the
check (from Martin),'' said Hirsch, who expects to be called as a
witness in the case. ``Let's face it, the government is out to nail
a big name here. They want a high-profile guy, and (Martin)
qualifies.''
</P>
<P>
   Brownlee's new attorney, Ed O'Donnell, recently predicted Martin
would never do jail time, implying that the wide receiver would
testify against Brownlee in return for reduced charges.
</P>
<P>
   Brownlee, 41, is known in the area as ``The Mayor of Opa-locka''
and he owns several businesses there, including a restaurant and
car-wash that Martin has conceded frequenting. He often gave Martin
money while the player was in college, dated Martin's aunt for a
time and remained a close friend. Convicted twice in the 1980s for
trafficking in cocaine, he has served seven years in jail. Brownlee
reportedly moved 80 to 100 kilos of cocaine weekly but authorities
had difficulty tracing the profits.
</P>
<P>
   Upon his release Monday morning, Martin and recently retained
attorney Roy Black insisted that the player will be acquitted at
trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm well-known in this community,'' said Martin, a Miami
native who grew up in the blighted Liberty City section and was
befriended by Brownlee while in high school. ``I am not guilty of
anything. This whole thing is ludicrous. After this trial is over,
I will be cleared.''
</P>
<P>
   Black said that ``by no stretch, none whatsoever,'' did his
client's actions constitute money-laundering.
</P>
<P>
   Black is a renowned defense attorney and an associate of Johnnie
Cochran. On Monday, the attorney announced that a web site would be
created to keep Martin's fans apprised of developments in the case
and also issued a statement. In that statement, he lauded Martin as
``loyal and loving'' to his family and friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tony never imagined providing financial assistance to a
neighborhood friend could be construed as a crime,'' Black said in
the statment. ``He vigorously denied the accusation.'' Black did
not return several telephone messages.
</P>
<P>
   During the Falcons' week of Super Bowl XXXIII preparations,
Martin had referred to the October reports as''garbage'' and told
reporters the situation was ``resolved'' and ``over with.'' He
jokingly chalked up the investigation to ``a miscommunication.'' At
that time, however, federal authorities were seeking an interview
with Martin.
</P>
<P>
   That same week, representatives from two of the three agencies
investigating Martin confirmed to the Journal-Constitution that the
player still was the subject of a grand-jury investigation. Both
agencies denied, though, that charges were imminent.
</P>
<P>
   Falcons coach Dan Reeves said Monday that federal authorities
had agreed to wait until after the team's Super Bowl appearance to
take action.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of it is IRS-related,'' said Reeves, who noted that
Martin was interviewed formally last week, on Monday. ``His dad
kept me informed. We've just got to allow the law to run its
course. There's nothing to be done (now). He is being investigated
by a grand jury, and we have to let things play out legally. . . .
Tony has cooperated the whole way.''
</P>
<P>
   Before being jailed on contempt-of-court charges last month, Sam
Wilson, a friend of Brownlee and Martin, suggested federal
authorities ``want Tony bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Terrance Smith, a friend of Martin, agreed Monday with that
assessment and insisted that the player will be cleared of all the
charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he got out of (Miami), he cleaned himself up really
good,'' Smith said. ``Tony liked the good life, but this stuff _
there's no way he did it.''

IN DEATH, KING BRINGS A DAY OF PEACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMMAN, Jordan -- As world leaders descended on this small desert
nation Monday to mourn King Hussein, the Middle East's most bitter
enemies suspended their differences for a day.
</P>
<P>
   In his death as in his life, the monarch brought hostile
countries like Israeli and Syria, the United States and Iraq,
together and reminded them of the need for a lasting peace in the
region.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein's funeral was a somber and extraordinary gathering of
nearly 50 heads of state and hundreds of dignitaries and
delegations from 75 nations who came to honor a man who ruled this
pivotal nation through a half century of turmoil, conflict and
tenuous peace before dying of cancer Sunday at the age of 63.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps not since the death in 1965 of French President Charles
de Gaulle has a funeral bound together so many nations.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, who bowed in prayer along with three former
American presidents, later commented on the unique, if emphemeral,
harmony of the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really a beautiful sight,'' he said. ``People coming
from all around the world -- countries that are at each other's
throats -- here meeting in peace and friendship and the sanctity of
the umbrella of this great man.''
</P>
<P>
   Male leaders and dignitaries were invited under that umbrella.
According to Islamic custom, only men attend funeral ceremonies.
While there were a few exceptions Monday, US Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright did not attend for this reason. Even some female
heads of state, such as Ireland's President Mary McAleese, mourned
with Queen Noor along with her female relatives, the wives of heads
of state and female dignitaries in a gathering in a separate room
in Raghdan palace.
</P>
<P>
   The day was drenched in ceremony and symbolism. Hussein's
casket, draped in the Jordanian flag, was carried on the flat bed
of a Range Rover that slowly wound its way through Amman from the
king's palace, Baab el Salaam, or ``Gate of Peace,'' named after
the historic peace agreement with Israel that may be the king's
most historic legacy.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of thousands of Jordanians holding posters of the king
and black mourning flags flanked the route. Most wept and murmured
prayers as the cortege moved toward the Raghdan Palace, which is
used for official functions.
</P>
<P>
   Walid Abaddi, 15, held back tears and waved a black flag that he
had fashioned out of a curtain rod and one of his mother's scarves
as the cortege passed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a father to us, and a teacher,'' said Abaddi. ``He made
this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the cortege arrived at the Raghdan Palace, military pall
bearers carried the casket into a polished brown marble foyer where
it was placed on a platform facing Mecca in the Throne Room.
</P>
<P>
   Then the long line of mourners clad in costumes from around the
world filed past. There was the basic black suit of the West, long
Arab robes trimmed in gold, and military uniforms with black arm
bands. There also was a panoply of headdress: fez, turbin, beret,
red-and-white checked kaffiyeh, Jewish skull cap, the tall hat of
Eastern Orthodox Christian clerics, and the red felt cap of Islamic
scholars.
</P>
<P>
   From the palace, the casket was towed behind a cannon chariot
festooned in white flowers down a hillside to the royal cemetery,
led by the bagpipes and slow pounding drums of a military band.
Following along the cortege was a white Arabian horse named
``Amre,'' the king's favorite, and in the tradition of a fallen
leader, the king's riding boots faced backward in the stirrups. The
horse will never be ridden again.
</P>
<P>
   Under a green canvas tent, the casket, now draped in a simple
white shroud, was lowered into the ground. The sound of the slow,
mournful chanting of the Koran mingled with the roar of Jordanian
Royal Air Force fighters overhead.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, enemies shared common ground. Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu and Syrian President Hafez al-Assad stood in the
same line, albeit 40 minutes apart. This marked the first time that
the leaders of the two opposing states had ever attended the same
public event.
</P>
<P>
   The delegation led by Iraqi Vice President Tahaa Marouf kept its
distance from Clinton and George Bush, the two American presidents
who have fought Iraqi aggression.
</P>
<P>
   The Crown Princes of Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, the oil-rich Arab
countries that had shunned Jordan for years because of its lack of
support in the 1991 Persian Gulf War were also there. Their warm
embrace of the new King Abdullah, Hussein's oldest son to whom the
crown of the Hashemite dynasty passed upon his father's death, was
a significant sign that the rift was healing.
</P>
<P>
   In a surreal moment, Netanyahu, flanked by body guards, milled
briefly in the same outdoor crowd that included Khaled Mashal, the
political leader of Hamas, the militant Islamic group. Netanyahu's
intelligence agency had ordered Mashal's assassination in the fall
of 1997. The operation was botched, causing a deep rift between
Netanyahu and Hussein. The incident came dangerously close to
unraveling the historic peace agreement the two nations signed in
1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all admired him deeply,'' said Netanyahu of Hussein,
despite the fact that Israel fought wars with Jordan in 1948 and
1967.
</P>
<P>
   Even Israel's vitriolic political debate was quieted, albeit
briefly, as Netanyahu, and Labor Party and Centrist Party rivals
arrived in three separate intervals to offer condolences. But the
bitter squabbling resumed by the time their helicopters had
traversed the short stretch of desert back into Israeli territory.
</P>
<P>
   Upon landing in Israel, Netanyahu lashed out at Israeli
President Ezer Weizman for shaking the hand of Nayef Hawatmeh, a
notorious underground leader of a Palestinian guerrilla faction. In
1974 Hawatmeh's men commandeered a school in the Israeli village of
Maalot. The hostage operation left 24 Israelis dead and shaped the
attitudes of a generation about the Palestinian leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Libya's Moammar Gadhafi, accused of plotting a failed
assassination attempt in 1983 of King Hussein, sent his son Saadi,
who had to fly from Tunisia because U.N. sanctions bar flights from
Libya. The new Jordanian king Abdullah is said to have met with
Saadi recently -- yet another sign that new generations in the
Mideast can move beyond the past.
</P>
<P>
   The funeral had the feel of a watershed, the beginning of an end
of an era in the Middle East. The region's ailing and aging leaders
will soon quite the scene, leaving the future open. Syria's Assad,
who is reportedly ailing, was feeling faint, according to a palace
source, and his 68 years were showing. The hands and lips of
69-year-old Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat trembled as he saluted
and then bowed to King Hussein's casket. Arafat is believed to be
suffering from Parkinson's disease. Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak looked fit at 71, but the lines of age on his face have
deepened.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the polite diplomacy of the gathering, there were
some problems with etiquette in the funeral's reception line.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of pushing,'' according to one palace
official. ``It's very hard to get that many people together and
have everyone behave, especially when there are no women there to
remind them.''

 &HT;    Daytona notebook: Chevy waits for NASCAR to approve new Monte
Carlo
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ Chevrolet hoped to introduce its Monte
Carlo Winston Cup car at the Coca-Cola 600 in Charlotte May 30.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it appears that NASCAR fans and Chevy teams might have to
wait until next season to see the car in competition.
</P>
<P>
   Winston Cup director Gary Nelson, who oversees the garage area,
said Monday the car still hasn't been approved by NASCAR and that
Chevy's goal of getting the Monte Carlo on the tracks by May might
be unrealistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's process to approve a car . . . requires much more
data, plus a crystal ball that tells you if we approve a car on a
(particular) date, by the time it hits the racetrack, how much
better is it going to be after they've built the thing?'' Nelson
said. ``We have to look at that steep learning curve that's going
to take place.''
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR officials are trying to avoid a situation similar to last
year, when Ford replaced the Thunderbird with its Taurus. After
placing five cars in the top 10 at the season-opening Daytona 500 a
year ago, Ford followed with six top-10 finishers at Rockingham the
following week.
</P>
<P>
   After Ford dominated the Las Vegas 400 on March 1, placing nine
cars among the top 10, NASCAR officals cut back the Taurus' spoiler
about 1 inch and raised the car's front-valence heighth to equalize
the car's downforce with the Chevys and Pontiacs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were cutting their spoilers because they were
aerodynamically better,'' Nelson said. ``We're trying to avoid
that. The more data we can collect, the better decision we can
make. . . . We want a car that fits what's on the race track now.
We just have to get to a point where we have enough information to
say it's going to run side by side when it debuts.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Chevrolet teams, including two-time defending Cup champion
Jeff Gordon and the No. 24 car, have said they'd be apprehensive
about changing cars in midseason, especially if they're involved in
another points race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't even seen the thing, let alone sat in one,'' Gordon
said earlier this year. ``We're excited about the car coming out,
but it definitely is a concern for it to be coming out when it is.
I think we'd rather have been working on it over the offseason and
bring it out at the first of the year, but at the same time, we're
pretty comfortable with our current Monte Carlo.''
</P>
<P>
   Hendrick Motorsports, which owns Gordon's team and two other
teams, is developing the superspeedway version of the Monte Carlo,
which will run at Daytona and Talladega. Richard Childress Racing,
which owns Dale Earnhardt's team, is preparing the ``downforce''
model, which will run at the remaining Cup tracks.
</P>
<P>
   The car reportedly has been tested at Talladega Superspeedway
and Miami-Dade Motorsports Complex and also has made several trips
to the wind tunnel for anerodynamics tests.
</P>
<P>
   Provisional qualifier changes
</P>
<P>
   After veteran driver Darrell Waltrip used 20 provisionals to
enter races he did not qualify for last season, NASCAR changed its
provisional rules. In 1999, a past-champion provisional will count
toward the season maximum of eight provisionals per car owner.
</P>
<P>
   A past-champion provisional, which is the last position to start
in the 43-car field, is available to the most recent Winston Cup
champion who was unable to make the field on time, provided that
his owner hasn't used the maximum number of provisionals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, it has become a real source of aggravation to me,''
Waltrip said. ``Quite frankly, I don't know why they don't just
start the 43 fastest cars and be done with it. But if you did that,
then there are people, and my self included, who would miss the
race. It would be people who run all of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then you'd have people showing up occasionally, who only run
every now and then, who knock out people who run every week. I
think there has to be some loyalty by NASCAR to the people who run
every week, and there certainly has to be some loyalty by NASCAR
champions who are still out here.''
</P>
<P>
   Rules changes?

   Nelson says NASCAR is close to a decision whether to implement
new air-dam and spoiler-size rules beginning with the North
Carolina 400 on Feb. 21 at Rockingham.
</P>
<P>
   The changes, which would give all three car makes -- Chevy, Ford
and Pontiac -- the same air-dam clearance and change the spoiler
size in non-restrictor-plate races, were first used in the Nov. 8
race at Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   According to Nelson, NASCAR got positive reactions from most
teams. Teams were told by NASCAR to use both sets of rules during
testing at Rockingham last week. Nelson said NASCAR would evaluate
the teams' test results in making its final decision.
</P>
<P>
   Second-round qualifying
</P>
<P>
   Only eight teams participated in Monday's second-round
qualifying, meaning that the remaining qualifying field, except
front-row sitters Gordon and rookie Tony Stewart, will stand on
Saturday's times.
</P>
<P>
   Derrike Cope, who leased an engine from owner Felix Sabates for
his No. 30 Pontiac, had the biggest improvement, covering the lap
nearly four-tenths of a second faster. Dave Marcis and the No. 71
Chevy, running with Mike Skinner's qualifying engine, improved by
more than two-tenths.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The engine) definitely picked us up,'' Cope said. ``That's
four-tenths better on what's a worse day, I think. We're 30th or so
in the overall speed category, which is not great. We'll do the
best we can.''
</P>
<P>
   Veteran Dick Trickle, who didn't run in first-round qualifying
because of mechanical problems, covered the track in 47.075
seconds, an average speed of 191.184. That would have placed him
34th on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we had a little too much bottoming out, trying that
last-minute effort,'' Trickle said. ``We didn't get to qualfy on
the first day, so we just had to get a lap in so we could get the
car ready to go racing now. Our speed isn't good at all, so we're
just going to have to get our way into the race through the
(qualifiers on Thursday).''
</P>
<P>
   Ain't life grand
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR president Bill France Jr. says NASCAR officals were
contacted by Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas about serving as
grand mashal of Sunday's Daytona 500.
</P>
<P>
   France Jr. says that NASCAR and Thomas share the same law firm
in Washington, D.C., and that stock-car racing wasn't using Thomas'
appearance solely as an opportunity to attract African-American
fans to the sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``From what I understand, he's a big NASCAR fan,'' France Jr.
said. ``Anytime, you've got a Supreme Court justice who's
interested in doing something like this, of course you're going to
be interested.''
</P>
<P>
   MoonPies for rookies
</P>
<P>
   Chattanooga Bakery, which produces MoonPie marshmallow
sandwiches, announced Monday that it's introducing a ``MoonPie
Rookie Dash for Cash,'' which will award both rookie drivers and
consumers for every Winston Cup, Busch and Craftsman Truck race won
by a rookie driver.
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR fans will enter the contest by mailing in an entry form
found on MoonPie cartons. Every time a rookie wins, a random
drawing will held.

DOLE PRESENTS HERSELF AS UNIFYING FORCE IN POLITICS 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ Elizabeth Dole, inching toward a presidential
run, Monday night described herself as a refreshingly different
Washington leader: one who could restore confidence and integrity
in the White House, return civility to national politics, and build
consensus where there is now ``a cacophony of conflicting voices.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've spent most of my life trying to bring people together,''
Dole told a sellout audience of 1,200 at the annual dinner of the
Greater Manchester Chamber of Commerce. ``I have never confused
civility with weakness, nor do I mistake the pursuit of consensus
for surrender. Quite simply, I would rather bridge differences than
exploit them.''
</P>
<P>
   The speech was Dole's first since she left her post as head of
the American Red Cross Jan. 4 to ``seriously consider'' running for
the Republican presidential nomination, and it was billed by aides
in this first-in-the-nation primary state as a major, political
overture to a possible campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it not only touched on issues Dole would be likely to
stress in a campaign _ improving public schools, strengthening the
national defense, reducing illicit-drug use, and lowering taxes _
but it also articulated the theme that she has the common sense and
moral character to bring Washington to its senses and restore trust
in government.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is one overriding theme to my 30-plus years in public
life, it lies in placing service over politics, to try consensus
before confrontation, and to count on the deep desire of my fellow
countrymen to do what is right,'' Dole said. ``In what is sometimes
a cacophony of conflicting voices, I have tried to raise mine in a
call to our better nature, always sure that America would
respond.''
</P>
<P>
   Dole, 62, is a two-time Cabinet secretary and married to former
Senator Bob Dole, the GOP's 1996 presidential candidate. She told
reporters Monday night she is still ``talking and listening'' to
supporters to determine if she will form a presidential exploratory
committee. So far, she said, the response has been ``very
encouraging. A number of people have called to volunteer,'' Dole
said, ``and money is coming in.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, not since former New York Representative Geraldine
Ferraro was tapped for the second spot on the Democratic ticket in
1984 has a woman with high political ambitions generated as much
interest in the country and excitement in the GOP. Polls among
Republicans show she already has bolted to the top tier of
Republican presidential hopefuls, and a survey last week by the Los
Angeles Times has both Dole and Texas Governor George W. Bush
beating Vice President Al Gore in head-to-head races.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Dole, noting she is methodical and controlled, say they
do not expect her to announce intentions until next week at the
earliest, after Dole assesses the political and financial support
in New Hampshire. Tuesday Dole will meet with nearly 100 backers at
a breakfast in Bedford before returning to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``She doesn't want to run just to go through the motions,'' a
senior Dole adviser said Monday. ``She has done that too many times
already,'' referring to former senator Dole's unsuccessful national
campaigns in 1996 and 1988. ``She wants to know that she can win.''
</P>
<P>
   To that end, Dole has opened an office in the Watergate complex,
where she and her husband live, and she has hired both New
York-based political consultant Kieran Mahoney and pollster Linda
DiVall to run a campaign. Later this week, Dole visits Texas,
Bush's home territory. Over the weekend, she will be in Colorado
and then travels to Iowa, where the first GOP caucuses will be held
next year. Aides could not immediately explain Dole's remarks about
raising money; candidates are not allowed to do that before an
exploratory committee has been set up.
</P>
<P>
   Dole, who has never held elective office but has served as both
Labor and Transportation secretary, has long, strong ties to the
Republican establishment. As a born-again Christian, she is also
popular among social conservatives. Her message Monday night was
that she could bridge the differences that frequently divide the
GOP while sidestepping the hot-button issues such as abortion,
affirmative action and school vouchers _ she did not mention any of
them _ that polarize the electorate and have hurt the party in
general elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most Americans prefer solutions to soundbites,'' Dole said.
``This makes us naturally suspicious of what I call either/or
politics. Liberal versus conservative. Public schools versus
private school. Us versus them.''
</P>
<P>
   Dole came into the state with local polls showing her name
recognition at more than 90 percent, her favorability rating at
more than 70 percent, and her ``negatives'' at 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mrs. Dole is a phenomenon,'' said Toni Pappas, a GOP activist
in Manchester who heads a committee in New Hampshire to draft Dole.
``I have not spoken to a single person who isn't interested and
doesn't want her to run.''

CENSURE RESOLUTION GAINS SUPPORT BUT STILL FACES SERIOUS OBSTACLES

 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Support among senators for a bipartisan rebuke of
President Clinton increased on Monday, but in a uniquely Senate
twist, the chances the measure will pass this week, or ever, dimmed
because of procedural roadblocks thrown up by opponents.
</P>
<P>
   The bill's two main sponsors, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif.,
and Sen. Robert Bennett, R-Utah, worked furiously by phone and in
corridors and private Senate dining rooms to buttonhole their
colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Both senators said interest in a sharply worded rebuke was
growing as it became clear the Senate may not only acquit Clinton,
but could fail to get even a simple majority for either of the two
impeachment articles. It would take two-thirds of the Senate, or 67
votes, to remove the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``More people are telling me they are now open to it, and they
were previously closed to it,'' Bennett said. ``It's a very fluid
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republicans, many of whom voice concern that Clinton will
gloat if he is acquitted without a reprimand, will debate the
censure resolution at a caucus meeting on Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Censure supporters not only are trying to build bipartisan
support but are doing so under a Friday deadline. After voting on
the impeachment articles, the Senate is scheduled to go into a
one-week recess, and opponents and supporters alike say that
momentum for a rebuke will diminish greatly after that.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to see a White House with a much different
attitude about censure if the president is in fact acquitted on
both articles,'' said Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, who rejects
censure. ``Within a week, they'll have a majority on their side who
would be opposed to censure.''
</P>
<P>
   Censure supporters say they can count on about 40 of the 45
Democrats. The resolution requires a simple majority, 51 votes. But
under Senate rules, it would take 60 votes to break a filibuster
that Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, is vowing to wage. That means that
at least 20 of the 55 Republicans would have to back the measure to
bring it to a vote.
</P>
<P>
   Such tactics are a staple of the Senate's legislative diet. But
the filibuster threat is even more potent now with the Senate
recess looming, and senators eager to move on to regular
legislative business when they return.
</P>
<P>
   To circumvent Gramm's filibuster and sustain support for censure
through the break, Sen. Tom Daschle, the Democratic leader, on
Monday set in motion a chain of procedural votes, which if approved
after senators dispense with the impeachment articles, would allow
them to go directly to the censure resolution itself.
</P>
<P>
   But for this parliamentary manuever to get off the ground, 67
senators would have to agree to suspend the rules of the Senate.,
which normally requires consent from all 100 senators to proceed to
a specific bill. Debate on the actual resolution could start as
early as this week, but because of the filibuster, might have to be
put until after the recess.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, the procedural votes would become test votes on
support for censure, especially among Republicans. Proponents
conceded on Monday that the tactic was a long-shot. But if
successful, it could pave the way for senators to approve a censure
resolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we're simply doing now is trying to make an historic
statement of record about our views of the president's actions,''
Daschle told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., who is working closely
with Feinstein, said the fate of censure this week rests largely
with Sen. Trent Lott, the majority leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Trent Lott wants to do it, we'll do it, Moynihan said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   But Lott and his aides have said repeatedly that it is
``premature and inappropriate'' to discuss censure before senators
vote on the impeachment articles.
</P>
<P>
   Off the Senate floor, however, many Republicans were mulling
over censure. ``It's something that people would be well served to
keep among their options,'' said Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   Many others, including Sens. Susan Collins and Olympia J. Snowe
of Maine, Connie Mack of Florida, and Ben Nighthorse Campbell of
Colorado, said in interviews they were still open to the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm and his allies, including Sen. Don Nickles of Oklahoma,
the majority whip, were also out in force to defeat what they said
was an unconstitutional motion that would give Democrats political
cover for their likely acquittal votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This sets a constitutional precedent that when we disagree
with a President Truman in the future who fires MacArthur, we
censure him,'' Gramm said.
</P>
<P>
   The battle over censure, while fierce, was not all-out war.
Hardly anything ever is in the Senate, where, unlike the House,
collegiality keeps the place running.
</P>
<P>
   In the subway tunnel between the Capitol and the Senate office
buildings on Monday morning, Feinstein spotted Gramm. The two sat
next to each other on a Sunday talk show, and exchanged acid
remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Any ill will seemed forgotten, or at least forgiven, when
Feinstein called out to her antagonist with a smile, ``Hey, tough
guy!'' Gramm grinned and blew her kisses.

SPORTS COLUMN: HINGIS NEEDS A TALKING-TO ON DIVERSITY  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By HARVEY ARATON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Billie Jean King grimaced when she heard that Martina Hingis
wasn't so sorry about the Amelie Mauresmo uproar after all, when
she was told that in Hingis' grand view from the top of the tennis
world, there is just so much public affection that a
racquet-wielding lesbian should show.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's young,'' King said one recent morning over coffee,
before remembering that Hingis, at 18 and carrying the
responsibility of being No. 1, isn't that young. ``What, if you're
straight and you bring your husband, you're not allowed to hold his
hand? I'm going to have to talk to Chris.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Evert, King said, counsels Hingis as part of a mentoring
program on the women's tour. King had better talk to Evert and
Evert to Hingis before the Swiss Miss mismanages another news media
session and again comes across as the spokeswoman for homophobia.
</P>
<P>
   ``If she grew up with that, that's unfortunate, but that's where
someone like Chris has to step up,'' King said. ``Sometimes, when
you're No. 1, you think you can get away with anything. Martina has
to learn to say to herself, `What's the right thing to do?'''
</P>
<P>
   What Hingis did, with an unintentional assist from Lindsay
Davenport, was turn an inspiring Australian Open run late last
month by the relatively unknown Mauresmo into a distasteful
referendum on the Frenchwoman's sexuality, played out sensationally
in the Australian tabloids.
</P>
<P>
   After telephoning Davenport, to whom she is close, King was
certain that the American was sorry for her clumsy language in
discussing Mauresmo's power and physique after their semifinal
match. First of all, there are women on the tour _ Venus Williams
and Mary Pierce, to name two _ more sculpted than Mauresmo. Second,
before she whipped herself into better shape, Davenport understood
that people snickered about her weight. She, of all people, should
have known better.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably good for them because now they know they need to
be careful with what they say,'' King said. ``When I talked to
Lindsay, she said, `Billie, I felt so bad, like I was walking on
eggshells.'''
</P>
<P>
   Davenport sent Mauresmo a heartfelt letter before the final, won
by Hingis, who then apologized to her vanquished opponent for
saying in an interview that Mauresmo is ``half a man; she's here
with her girlfriend.'' Mauresmo, 19, told Hingis, ``I hope you
really mean this.'' Hingis apparently did not.
</P>
<P>
   The following day, she told Tim Layden of Sports Illustrated
that she ``wasn't regretting'' what she had said. Much worse, she
added, of Mauresmo and her companion, Sylvie Bourdon, ``Everyone
makes her own choices, but ... they are hugging and kissing all the
time, and I'm just, `OK, there's a limit.'''
</P>
<P>
   King, one of a handful of star-quality female athletes who have
acknowledged a lesbian life style, sighed and said: ``Am I shocked
she said this? Why would I be? I lived this. Martina Navratilova
lived this. It just tells me there's still homophobia on the
tour.''
</P>
<P>
   And now, of all times, when the men's draw at a Grand Slam
tournament is the rough equivalent of the jayvee game. King, the
mother of the women's pro circuit, a rebel to the core, said, if
anything, that women should not even play Australia until it offers
equal prize money. Or the French Open and Wimbledon, for that
matter. ``This is the moment, the window,'' she said, adding that
the chances of a united women's movement are slim.
</P>
<P>
   There is always the next purse to win, another endorsement to
earn. At the root of Hingis' revulsion to Mauresmo is most likely
the old-school belief that she will somehow be mislabeled,
stigmatized. Hingis' ideal female tennis icon, judging from her
recent rash of showy magazine shoots, is obviously Anna Kournikova,
the tour's reigning boys' locker room pinup.
</P>
<P>
   This uninformed, regressive attitude negates the leaps and
bounds of women's sports, and misses the spiritual triumph of a
leveling playing field. A generation of schoolgirls is finally
being encouraged to compete, to sweat, without having to worry
about sexuality being factored into their personal scouting report.
</P>
<P>
   It shouldn't matter and, to increasing audiences and consumers,
it doesn't matter. Everyone makes their own choices, as Hingis put
it, and Evert or someone should teach her to respect them. ``The
tour has so many different personalities now,'' King said.
``Celebrate the differences.''
</P>
<P>
   Next Monday night, King will receive the Arthur Ashe Award for
Courage at the ESPY Awards at Radio City Music Hall. Here is some
sound mentoring advice for Martina Hingis: Call up Chris Evert and
find out why.

STUDY LOOKS AT BEST WAYS TO READ TO CHILDREN 
</HEADLINE>
  (The Science Times) 
(mk) 
 By ERICA GOODE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A mother pulls her 4-year-old daughter onto her lap, opens the
book ``Madeline'' and begins to read. ``Do you see the 12 little
girls in a line?'' she asks, pointing at the picture.
</P>
<P>
   At preschool, the teacher takes a different approach: She reads
the book all the way through, then asks the children, ``Did the
little girls like Miss Clavel?''
</P>
<P>
   Which style of interactive reading is most likely to increase a
child's vocabulary skills? According to a study by New Zealand
researchers, it depends on the child.
</P>
<P>
   Children whose vocabulary skills are already fairly advanced
seem to benefit most from a more demanding ``performance-oriented''
interactive style, said Dr. Elaine Reese of the University of Otago
in Dunedin, a co-author of the study. In this format, Dr. Reese
said, the adult introduces the book _ explaining what it is about
and asking the child to predict what will happen in it _ then reads
through the pages, and afterward poses a series of questions that
explore the book and relate to the child's own life.
</P>
<P>
   Less advanced children, on the other hand, seem to profit more
from a less demanding ``describer'' style of reading, Dr. Reese
said, in which the adult interrupts the narrative frequently,
pointing to and labeling pictures and commenting on the story.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-eight New Zealand 4-year-olds, recruited from state-run
preschools, participated in the study, which was published in a
recent issue of the journal Developmental Psychology. Adults read
the boys and girls 32 books over a six-week period using one of
three different reading styles. Researchers tested the children's
vocabulary skills at the beginning and the end of the study.
</P>
<P>
   Children who entered the study with higher initial scores on the
vocabulary test showed greater gains when adult readers used the
performance-oriented interactive style. Those with lower initial
vocabulary scores gained most from the describer style of
interaction.
</P>
<P>
   A third reading style, called ``comprehender'' by the
researchers, in which the adult interrupted the reading to ask the
child higher-level questions, was not as beneficial as the other
two styles.

 &HT;    Impeachment trial winds down as Lott opts against open
deliberations
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman and Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A yawning, fidgeting Senate heard the last words
from both sides in President Clinton's impeachment trial Monday at
the beginning of the final week of the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   With senators all but certain to keep Clinton in office, the 13
House prosecutors delivered one last appeal to oust the president
for lying under oath and obstructing justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Infidelity is private and non criminal. Perjury and
obstruction are public and criminal,'' said Rep. Henry Hyde
(R-Ill.), the lead prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. James Sensenbrenner (R-Wis.), another prosecutor, offered a
plea that seemed intended as much for the viewing public as the
Senate. ``The rule of law should apply to everyone. Senators, don't
be fooled by the president's excuses and spin control.''
</P>
<P>
   But White House counsel Charles Ruff was equally emphatic in
denying that Clinton's conduct merits his removal from office.
</P>
<P>
   Repeating the defense team mantra that the prosecutors want to
win too much, Ruff said their vision is ``more focused on
retribution, more designed to achieve partisan ends.''
</P>
<P>
   Paraphrasing baseball great Yogi Berra, Ruff alluded to the
repetitive nature of Monday's closing arguments, which saw senators
in both parties unable to stifle yawns after a lengthy Saturday
session and four weeks of the trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's deja vu all over again and all over again and all over
again,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The trial resumes at 1 p.m. today with an expected vote on
whether to conduct the Senate's final deliberations in public.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.) dealt a setback to
proponents of open deliberations when he came out Monday for
closed-door sessions.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of Republican senators also worked Monday with
Democrats to draft a censure resolution that would be acceptable to
a couple of dozen GOP senators. Lott has not made known his
position on censure.
</P>
<P>
   But prosecutors and some GOP senators, hoping to keep pressure
on their colleagues, want to squelch talk of censure, at least for
the time being. Their fear is that giving senators the middle
ground of censure as an option would reduce the number of votes to
convict Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you really cleanse the office as provided in the
Constitution or do you use the Air Wick of a censure resolution?''
Hyde said at the end of a long afternoon of lawyerly rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde also asked for a delay in the trial to present evidence
that White House aide Sidney Blumenthal ``testified falsely''
before the Senate when he denied telling reporters that Lewinsky
was a ``stalker'' who had set up the president.
</P>
<P>
   Affidavits from journalist Christopher Hitchens and his wife,
Carole Blue, allege that Blumenthal referred to Lewinsky as a
stalker during a March 1998 lunch. Blumenthal has denied the
contention.
</P>
<P>
   Senators from both parties said they oppose delaying the trial.
Several suggested that the affidavits be turned over to the Justice
Department or independent counsel Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Lott tried to insert the affidavits into the Senate record
Monday, but Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) objected.
</P>
<P>
   For much of the last week, the House prosecutors have been
relentless in their argument that the president is not fit to be
president _ well after it became clear that they would not win the
67 votes required forcibly remove him.
</P>
<P>
   And their finale was no different.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's second impeachment trial, the prosecutors argued,
is not about the president's adulterous affair with former White
House intern Monica Lewinsky. The trial is about what the president
did to conceal that affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obstruction of justice and perjury must not be allowed to
stand,'' said Rep. Bob Barr (R-Ga.) ``Perjury and obstruction
cannot stand alongside the laws and the Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   Barr struck a theme that was repeated again and again in the
prosecutors' three-hour presentation, urging senators to ignore
polls and public relations and instead act according to their
conscience.
</P>
<P>
   Looking sternly at the senators, Barr asked if the principles
embodied in the Constitution would be affirmed or whether they
would left in the ``pallid hands of pollsters and pundits and the
swarm of theorists surrounding these proceedings?''
</P>
<P>
   Hyde spoke of death threats, hate mail and ``insults shouted in
public,'' as he quoted from Saul Bellow, Gibbon and Shakespeare to
portray the prosecution team as a ``band of brothers,'' in the
words of Henry V.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing but ``tumult'' has followed since the House voted to
impeach the president on Dec. 19, Rep. George Gekas (R-Pa.) said.
</P>
<P>
   But he suggested that senators try to shut out the noise and
focus on one question: Did the president utter falsehoods under
oath? If so, he said, he must be removed.
</P>
<P>
   ``To violate the oath as a witness in a civil case or a criminal
case . . . smashes against the integrity of our system of
government,'' Gekas said .
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Steve Chabot (R-Ohio) made an effort to undermine the
Clinton team's contention that the president is contrite.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all know the president's behavior has been reprehensible,''
Chabot said. ``President Clinton, however, refuses to admit what
all of us know is true. To this day, he continues to deny and
distort. He continues to dispute the undeniable facts that are
before the Senate and before the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   When it came time for the White House closing argument, Ruff sat
in his wheelchair in the well of the Senate and spoke for 1 and 3/4
hours in an unstinting critique of the prosecutors' case.
</P>
<P>
   The White House defense has all along not conceded one point of
the House case against Clinton, and Ruff was no different on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   About as much as Ruff would acknowledge is that Clinton behaved
poorly in conducting his affair with Lewinsky and then trying to
conceal it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has asked for forgiveness from his family and the American
public,'' Ruff said. ``And he has asked for the opportunity to earn
back their trust.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruff asked senators if leaving Clinton in office ``would put at
risk the liberties of the people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can honestly say it would not,'' he continued, ``then
you must vote to acquit.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruff took frequent, pointed jabs at the prosecutors, saying the
allegations are ``moving targets'' and ``empty pots.''
</P>
<P>
   Noting that he previously called the charges against the
president ``empty vessels,'' Ruff said, ``That's much too
flattering. It might even suggest they have the capacity to float,
which they don't.''

AS KOSOVO TALKS CONTINUE, NATO TROOP PLAN LAGS BADLY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: France, Great Britain)  (mk) 
 By JANE PERLEZ

<P>
   RAMBOUILLET, France _ As peace talks in the Kosovo conflict
entered a second session here, the plans for using NATO troops _ a
key element of an agreement _ were lagging far behind, Clinton
administration and NATO officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   How a NATO force would be deployed and discussions over what
authority it would have in Kosovo were far from final even though a
two-week deadline has been set for the talks, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The slowness in deciding the shape of a NATO force mostly
reflected France's unsuccessful effort to have a force in Kosovo
report to the ``contact group'' of nations, the officials said. The
contact group, which consists of the United States, four Western
European countries and Russia, is running the peace talks here.
</P>
<P>
   Giving the group power over NATO forces would be similar to the
kind of ``dual key'' situation created by the Bosnia peace accord.
In that agreement, the United Nations could veto NATO action,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Such a dilution of NATO authority would be intended to make the
force in Kosovo more inviting to Russia, which is taking part in
the Kosovo talks, and to the Yugoslav leader, Slobodan Milosevic,
who is under pressure to accept NATO troops as part of a deal, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of decisiveness on how NATO forces would operate in
Kosovo, even as the peace talks are under way, contrasts sharply
with the strategy during the Dayton negotiations that ended the war
in Bosnia in 1995. There, the warring parties were presented with a
NATO military plan, which gave the NATO commander huge powers in
Bosnia, as soon as they entered the talks.
</P>
<P>
   Nine days ago, France, the host to the talks here, insisted at a
meeting of the 16 NATO members that the contact group should have
oversight over any NATO air strikes against Serbia. But after 10
hours of debate, France lost its case. At the meeting, NATO
authorized air strikes against Serbia if Milosevic failed to
support a peace accord that negotiators are trying to forge now
between the Serbs and the ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   France, Britain and the United States have said that to buttress
a peace agreement involving political autonomy for Kosovo, foreign
troops are necessary.
</P>
<P>
   France and Britain have announced that they will send troops to
Kosovo on condition that a peace agreement is reached. President
Clinton has been less definitive, saying he was ``seriously
considering'' sending a contingent of American soldiers that would
be smaller than any European contingent. But other NATO nations
have not committed themselves to contributing troops.
</P>
<P>
   Other uncertainties involve the actual operations of a NATO
force. Military specialists describe the mission as a ``tricky''
situation that could be more dangerous than that of the
peacekeeping force in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   A draft of a military annex to the proposed peace agreement
ascribes much greater powers to an international group of unarmed
monitors than NATO military experts want. This draft military annex
has not been presented here but is under discussion at NATO
headquarters, officials said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The annex states that during the three years that the peace
agreement is expected to run, the Serbian security police, who have
been suspected in most of the atrocities against ethnic Albanian
civilians, would be under the control of the Kosovo Verification
Mission, which is made up of unarmed monitors run by the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   According to the draft, the Serbian security forces would be
required to reduce their numbers to 2,500 and would carry out
``only normal policing duties at the direction'' of the head of the
verification mission. The security forces now number about 11,000,
in violation of a 10,021 ceiling set in October, a NATO military
official said. The Yugoslav army has about 15,000 soldiers in
Kosovo, a province of Serbia, which together with Montenegro makes
up Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   One of the many unanswered questions, a NATO diplomat said, was
how the security police would be disarmed and their units sent out
of Kosovo. It was clear, he said, that unarmed monitors of the
verification mission would not be capable of taking heavy weapons
from the security police. ``I fail to see how the OSCE could
control the Serbian security forces without NATO help,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And it was unlikely, the diplomat said, that nations
contributing to a NATO force would want their soldiers working on
such a potentially dangerous assignment unless NATO had undisputed
military command.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem facing a NATO contingent in Kosovo was how to
disarm the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army, which has become skilled
at classic guerrilla hit-and-run tactics.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo is potentially a much messier situation for NATO,
officials said. Unlike Bosnia, which is a sovereign country that
NATO could essentially control, Kosovo will remain part of Serbia
during the three-year peace agreement that is envisioned in the
talks. Kosovo's borders would still be patrolled by the Yugoslav
army, giving NATO much less control.

TOO MUCH CONCERN ABOUT YEAR 2000 COMPUTER PROBLEMS COULD BE BAD AS
TOO LITTLE

c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The early fears about the Year 2000 computer
problem featured all sorts of machines driven haywire by their
inability to read dates in the new year: computer networks that
control power, water and phone systems might freeze; railroads,
airlines and trucks might be idled as dispatch and traffic safety
systems crash, and the financial universe, from stock markets to
payroll systems to automated teller machines, might go on the
blink.
</P>
<P>
   That was before tens of billions of dollars were spent on
computer repairs and upgrades. Now, a chorus of regulators, Year
2000 project managers and other authorities warn that Americans
fearing the worst may end up inflicting more serious damage on
themselves, their neighbors and the economy than anything the
computers do.
</P>
<P>
   Planning experts say those scenarios could include bank runs,
hoarding of food and gasoline, fires caused by misuse of newly
acquired wood stoves and generators, and a rise in gun violence
stemming from the surge in firearm sales to those fearing civil
unrest.
</P>
<P>
   ``As it becomes clear our national infrastructure will hold,
overreaction becomes one of the biggest remaining problems,'' said
John Koskinen, chairman of the President's Commission on Year 2000
Conversion. The challenge is to keep the computer repair work going
and prudent preparations for disruptions on track while calming the
most nervous citizens.
</P>
<P>
   While surveys show most Americans do not expect their lives to
be severely disrupted, a significant minority say they are planning
big investments of time or money to protect themselves. And the
American Red Cross advises the public, as a precaution, to have
enough food and other staples on hand to endure disruptions of
several days to a week.
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting here on Monday, the Year 2000 project committee of
the National Retail Federation, endorsing the Red Cross
recommendation, called for retailers and manufacturers to develop
campaigns aimed at getting consumers to stock up gradually rather
than trying to do so in the last few days of 1999. But the group
declined to provide any examples of the kind of supplies it thought
citizens should stock, fearing that being so specific would be too
alarming.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody wins if the public freaks out,'' said Cathy Hotka, the
information technology specialist at the federation, a Washington
trade group that includes virtually every major retailing company
and trade association except Wal-Mart, the nation's largest
retailer. ``If the public reacts badly, you could take a
potentially minor situation and make it a nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   Some sectors, like the banking industry, began addressing public
fears months ago. The Federal Reserve, which supplies cash to the
banking system, took the lead by announcing its intention to print
$50 billion in extra currency _ lifting the total in circulation to
$200 billion _ to assure consumers that banks will have plenty of
paper for those who want to have extra cash on hand before the end
of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Individual banks and industry associations have sponsored a wide
variety of advertising suggesting that shifting money to the
mattress leaves customers wide open to losing it to theft, fires
and scam artists, not to mention the temptation to fritter it away
on unnecessary luxuries.
</P>
<P>
   Some symbolic gestures have already been announced as well. Jane
F. Garvey, head of the Federal Aviation Administration, has
promised to be flying on New Year's Eve as a show of faith in the
air traffic control system. British Airways announced that nearly
all of its senior executives would also be aloft.
</P>
<P>
   Surveys show that almost half the nation's local governments
have not started on Year 2000 repairs and contingency planning and
that many small businesses lag just as badly. Multinational
companies are bracing for disruptions in Russia and a number of
Asian countries where Year 2000 work has been a low priority. Where
the work has been done, at home or abroad, testing remains crucial
because experience shows that computer system repairs inevitably
introduce unforeseen glitches.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, President Clinton's only remarks on Year 2000 in his State
of the Union address homed in on the need to keep working to reduce
the risks. Koskinen says complacency is still at least as big a
concern as overreaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some people, a certain amount of panic would help,''
Koskinen said.
</P>
<P>
   The growing questions about behavior management highlight a
paradox that computer programmers were among the first to realize:
the Year 2000 computer problem, also known as the Millennium Bug
and Y2K, probably should have been called something like the Pogo
Syndrome after the old comic strip that observed, ``We have met the
enemy, and he is us.''
</P>
<P>
   After all, humans seeded the Year 2000 problem into the
technology landscape by using just two digits in programming dates,
such as 99 for 1999, to save expensive memory in the 1960's and
1970's. Early on, computer workers began warning that some machines
and software would malfunction because they would read 00 as 1900
instead of 2000 or as no date at all. But all too human foibles
like sloth, greed and unfounded optimism that someone else _ or new
intelligent machines _ would take care of the Year 2000 problem
allowed it to grow into an expensive, potentially deadly global
challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the race to minimize the risk enters its last months,
the Year 2000 glitch may test people's trust in one another as much
as the reliability of their machines. Do they believe that the
repair work has been sound and that most of what is left to be done
will be finished? Will workers have the skills and dedication to
overcome whatever computer malfunctions do occur? Will citizens be
neighborly, rather than selfish? Will political and business
leaders step in effectively at the right moments?
</P>
<P>
   A tiny minority is already investing heavily in the belief that
the answer to these questions is mostly no. Year 2000 alarmists,
religious groups that see the computer problem as a preordained
divine punishment and survivalists fleeing for rural fortresses are
producing measurable bounces in the sale of dehydrated foods,
wood-burning stoves, home power generators and other goods at the
fringes of the normal economy.
</P>
<P>
   More telling though is the number of Americans saying they are
considering moves that would clearly be unnecessary if the nation's
computer networks end up being as reliable as regulators and
industry leaders are projecting. Polls show that around 10 percent
of citizens expect to withdraw most or all of their money from
banks. A Gallup poll in December found that 17 percent expected to
buy either a generator or a wood stove.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Some consultants involved in community preparedness groups say
those numbers are likely to rise sharply.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's reasonable to assume the population will get very
nervous,'' said Douglass Carmichael, a Washington-based consultant
who lectures community groups that public information on Year 2000
progress is too unreliable to justify putting off building
substantial food stockpiles and other ``safety nets.''
</P>
<P>
   Dealing with mass nervousness is more art than science.
Consultants and government officials preach that the best way to
calm nerves is to make sure that customers and consumers are
inundated with the details of the work being done to reduce risks.
And many of those organizing on the community level agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``Statements have to be out there for people to jump on and
research,'' said Margo King, one of a group of organizers who have
helped make Boulder, Colo., a pacesetter in local preparedness
planning.
</P>
<P>
   But John Steiner, Ms. King's husband, adds that even with more
information, many people will retain doubts that could prime them
for panic. ``On Vietnam, we listened to the people in charge for a
long time and everything was going well, and then it wasn't,''
Steiner said. ``The question is what is appropriate contingency
planning if things don't turn out as we hope.''
</P>
<P>
   While those like Steiner and Ms. King crave more details about
repairs, most people are apparently not worried enough to listen.
Chase Manhattan Bank officials say consumer fears about the banking
system leveled off at about 25 percent in the bank's monthly
surveys in the last half of 1998, convincing them that it was too
soon to publish extensive information about its Year 2000 work _
lest it be interpreted as an ominous sign rather than reassurance.
</P>
<P>
   One way to head off nervousness may be to encourage those most
likely to be worried later this year to go ahead and acquire now
the supplies that would make them comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's sufficient information for people to say there's a
substantial risk of disruption,'' said Charles Halpern, president
of the Nathan E. Cummings Foundation, a New York-based foundation
that has been providing funds for community preparedness efforts
and lobbying other foundations to get involved in Year 2000 work.
Halpern wants leaders from President Clinton on down to talk more
often and more forcefully about Year 2000 risks.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Overreaction now is so much preferable to overreaction in
November that it's a risk worth running,'' Halpern said. ``People
who want to lay in supplies of canned vegetables can do it now
without disrupting anything.''
</P>
<P>
   The drumbeat for early, locally based preparation to minimize
risks and head off panic is coming from community groups, many of
which have gone far beyond advocating stockpiling of necessities.
Some suggestions have been ignored, as when Year 2000 organizers in
Spokane, Wash., called for a ``practice'' day last month on which
families were to do without such basics as electricity and running
water to learn more about what they need to cope with worst-case
scenarios.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we were the only people who did it,'' one of the
Spokane organizers, Larry Shook, said of himself and his wife, Judy
Laddon. Even other members of the organizing group ended up
deciding they were ``too busy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But such organizers have been building links to local officials
in some communities that could lead to broad preparedness efforts.
Shook has been hired by Global Action Plan of Woodstock, N.Y., a
nonprofit consultant to cities and towns on environmental and
social issues, to write a manual on how cities can help citizens
prepare for two-day, two-week and two-month disruptions.
</P>
<P>
   The manual, which is financed by the Cummings Foundation, is
being developed in cooperation with the city of Portland, Ore.,
which hopes to distribute it to all the city's households this
spring. It will also be available on the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   Federal authorities are cautiously encouraging community groups
like those in Spokane and Boulder, although they fear some of them
may end up creating more alarm than preparation. Many have become
distribution channels for planning materials such as those
developed by the Red Cross and the Federal Emergency Management
Agency, which expects to publish by the end of this month new
advice tailored to the Year 2000 problem rather than to natural
disasters.
</P>
<P>
   ``People ultimately have a lot of common sense, so the real goal
is to give them all the information we have,'' Koskinen said.

SHARES MAKE ORDERLY RETREAT IN LIGHTEST TRADING OF 1999 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stock prices were mixed Monday as bellwether
technology issues rebounded after falling last week, but blue-chip
securities and shares in small companies, including Internet
stocks, slid.
</P>
<P>
   Traders and analysts said the market's performance was
impressive in light of the sharp run-up in prices since October and
several new pressures that could lead to a sharp selloff.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a pretty orderly way to digest a good run,'' said
Michael Clark, head of U.S. stock trading at Credit Suisse First
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still believe that while inflows are fairly strong, a bit
more attention is being paid to valuation, so people are starting
to take some profits,'' he said. ``I think this is a healthy way to
slowly let a little of the air out of the market.''
</P>
<P>
   On the New York Stock Exchange, a big drop in United
Technologies helped to push the Dow Jones industrial average down
13.13 points, or a tenth of a percent, to 9,291.11. But the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index, led by rebounds in the
technology giants Microsoft and Intel, gained 4.37, or nearly
four-tenths of a percent, to 1,243.77.
</P>
<P>
   Led by technology companies, the Nasdaq composite index rose
31.30, or 1.3 percent, to 2,404.92. The Russell 2000 index of
smaller companies fell 1.39, or 0.3 percent, to 411.33. And
Thestreet.com's index of 20 Internet companies slumped 26.67, or
5.2 percent, to 504.85.
</P>
<P>
   Volume on the Big Board was 705.4 million shares, the slowest
day so far this year. On the Nasdaq, just fewer than 883 million
shares changed hands.
</P>
<P>
   Clark and others suggested that the threat of higher interest
rates and a spate of new and secondary stock offerings would most
likely constrain market indexes for some time.
</P>
<P>
   ``New supply will hold the market back,'' said Michael Molnar, a
managing director in retail sales and trading at Salomon Smith
Barney.
</P>
<P>
   ``But interest rates are clearly the biggest deterrent'' to
higher prices, he said. ``If the Fed were to pop the liquidity
bubble by either tightening monetary policy or changing their bias
toward tightening, that could do it. No one has questioned the
interest rate environment for months.''
</P>
<P>
   Among individual stocks, Microsoft was the biggest gainer in the
S&AMP;P 500, rising 5 1/4, to 165 1/4, after it said it would develop
wireless Internet services with British Telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
   Intel, which was hammered last week, rebounded Monday, rising 4
7/16, to 132. United Technologies was the biggest loser of the Dow
stocks, falling 5, to 120.
</P>
<P>
   But big bank stocks also sustained losses. J.P. Morgan, a Dow
stock, fell 2 7/8, to 99 1/4. And Chase Manhattan dropped 3 5/16,
to 73 1/8.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Internet-related companies and online brokerage firms
also fell. America Online dropped 5, to 159. Yahoo lost 14 1/8, to
158 5/8. And Amazon.com declined 6 3/4, to 109 1/8.
</P>
<P>
   Ameritrade Holding fell 15 1/2, to 80, after its Internet and
touch-tone trading services crashed for nearly half an hour Monday
morning. J.B. Oxford Holdings, another online broker, fell 3 9/16,
to 8 3/16. And Siebert Financial fell 7 5/8, to 27 1/2.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, Executive Risk, a specialty insurer, rose 21 1/8, to
65 1/8, after Chubb announced that it would buy the company for
$71.71 a share. Chubb, the nation's 14-largest property and
casualty insurer, fell 2 5/8, to 55 7/16.
</P>
<P>
   AMR, the parent of American Airlines, fell 2 15/16, to 57. The
airline was forced to cancel 22 percent of its flights Monday after
pilots failed to show up for work in a dispute over AMR's purchase
of Reno Air.
</P>
<P>
   And Boeing fell 11/16, to 36 3/8, after it was reported that
China had ordered a freeze on new aircraft purchases and postponed
aircraft deliveries.

OUSTED MALAYSIAN TALKS DARKLY OF POLITICAL FOES  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By MARK LANDLER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia _ Five months after he was ousted and
jailed on corruption and sex-related charges, Malaysia's former
deputy prime minister, Anwar Ibrahim, finally took the stand in his
defense Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Under questioning by his lead lawyer, Anwar depicted himself as
the victim of a political conspiracy sanctioned by his former
mentor, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I have political foes who would stop at nothing to
achieve their agenda,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The government has accused Anwar of quashing a police
investigation of charges that he had illicit sexual relations with
women and men. But Anwar testified that he encouraged the police to
look into the allegations, even though they were made in letters
that he said were written by his enemies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't have done that if I had the slightest worry or
suspicion as regards the truth of the allegations,'' Anwar said.
</P>
<P>
   In a trial that has mesmerized this Southeast Asian nation and
become a referendum on its government, the central player emerged
as a relaxed witness, smiling easily and sprinkling his comments
with sardonic observations about the police, high society figures
and even his own plight. When the judge asked Anwar, 51, to run
through his resume, he listed a series of increasingly powerful
government posts that culminated in the No. 2 job under Mahathir.
Then Anwar switched from Malay to English to add a wry coda, ``Now
jobless.''
</P>
<P>
   The comment drew laughs from the gallery, which included foreign
journalists, diplomats and members of human-rights organizations.
If Anwar seemed to be playing to the gallery, political analysts
here said that reflected how this trial had become as much a
political battle as a criminal case.
</P>
<P>
   Mahathir dismissed Anwar in September after the two feuded
bitterly over Malaysia's economic policy. After removing his
protege, Mahathir imposed strict controls on Malaysia's currency
and foreign investment, which effectively cut the country off from
the global economy.
</P>
<P>
   Anwar's ouster galvanized people, who took to the streets
calling for Mahathir to resign. Vice President Al Gore drew world
attention to the unrest in a speech at an economic summit meeting
here in November, when he praised the protesters and chided
Malaysia for suppressing political freedom.
</P>
<P>
   The political nature of the trial was underscored Monday when
Malaysia's attorney general turned up unexpectedly to lead the
prosecution team. The attorney general, Mohtar Abdullah, had not
appeared during the prosecution phase of trial because he was named
by the defense as a potential witness. But after Anwar's lawyers
did not call him, he promptly took charge.
</P>
<P>
   Mohtar wasted no time in scoring a political point against
Anwar. When Anwar began answering questions in English, he said,
``May I just note that the champion of Bahasa is electing to speak
in English.'' Bahasa Malaysia is the formal name of the Malay
language.
</P>
<P>
   Anwar came to prominence as a Muslim student leader who pressed
for his country to cast off its British colonial roots, in part by
using its native language. But most of Anwar's lawyers were trained
in Britain and they are more comfortable speaking English. Despite
desultory efforts to conduct the trial in Malay, the judge and the
defense lawyers typically lapse into English.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, though, Anwar was on the offensive. As head
of a Cabinet committee on government management, he testified, he
heard lots of incriminating details about high-level officials. He
implied that those officials would have ample reason to engineer
his ouster.
</P>
<P>
   Anwar also set out to rebut accusations that he interfered in an
investigation of his alleged sexual affairs. The prosecution
asserted that he had misused his power to force his former driver,
Azizan Abu Bakar, to retract an affidavit stating he had been
sodomized by his boss. But Anwar said Azizan recanted on his own,
and later begged for forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   The judge, Augustine Paul, dealt Anwar a setback two weeks ago
when he approved a motion to amend the corruption charges so that
the government does not have to prove Anwar had illicit sex. That
means Anwar's lawyers cannot contest the sexual evidence already
laid out. As a result, they say, they cannot clear their client's
reputation.

INSTEAD OF MAKING THEIR OWN, TOY MAKERS NOW PREFER TO BUY RIVALS

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When a hot toy hits the market, frantic parents rush to buy one
while it is still on the shelf. Toy makers, it seems, are adopting
a similar shopping strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Ever on the lookout for top-selling toys to add to their mix,
industry giants like Mattel and Hasbro are increasingly looking not
to their own workshops but to their smaller rivals. If they did not
come up with the latest plaything to catch the eye of those fickle
4-year-olds, they simply buy the company that did.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our industry thrives on new products, and where that comes
from is not necessarily always going to be from the big
companies,'' said David Miller, president of the Toy Manufacturers
of America, the trade group, which this week is putting on the 96th
annual American International Toy Fair in New York.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Mattel, maker of Barbie and Hot Wheels, will soon
be the biggest producer of consumer software behind Microsoft, but
it is paying $3.8 billion do so by acquiring the Learning Co. And
Hasbro, known for G.I. Joe dolls and Tonka trucks won the latest
toy war with Furby, but only after it bought Furby's maker, Tiger
Electronics, last year for $335 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is something out there that we think can add to our
brand portfolio,'' said Wayne Charness, a spokesman for Hasbro,
``we do everything we can to go get it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the fiercely competitive and cyclical toy business,
manufacturers and retailers have long struggled with how to achieve
the consistent revenues and earnings growth that investors demand.
By buying rivals, they hope to minimize the risk of wild earnings
swings from new toys that fizzle fast or classics that lose their
luster. And snapping up a competitor's expertise or best-selling
brands enables manufacturers to respond more rapidly to
ever-evolving consumer demands.
</P>
<P>
   That is just what has happened with electronic games and
multimedia software, which have become increasingly important to
the industry. While the overall industry had flat results last
year, with $15.2 billion in wholesale shipments to retailers, a $41
million decline, the total market for video game software grew a
third, to $2.8 billion, while the market for electronic games grew
20 percent, to $456 million, according to the toy industry group.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to achieve such gains with a wider array of educational
and interactive toys, Hasbro and Mattel have been trolling for
companies that would give them more of an edge. Last year, Hasbro
bought Microprose Inc., Tiger Electronics and the Atari video game
division of the JTS Corp. Mattel, not to be outdone, followed with
the largest deal in the industry in recent years by announcing that
it would acquire the Learning Co. The deal is expected to close by
the end of April.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mattel recognizes enormous opportunity in Learning Company's
relationships with schools and hot specialty stores like Zany
Brainy,'' said Eric Johnson, a professor at Vanderbilt University's
Owen Graduate School of Management. Zany Brainy is a fast-growing
specialty retailer that sells multimedia educational products.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to gaining even greater visibility at such specialty
toy sellers, ``Mattel can now leverage its distribution and brands
to grow the Learning Company's products, while integrating
education and multimedia into its own line of toys and games,''
Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers are likely to benefit, too. For one thing, toys that
once required jaunts to specialty stores will now be more widely
available at places like Kmart and Toys ``R'' Us. And economies of
scale usually generated from these transactions often produce cost
savings for the manufacturers that, in theory, could mean cheaper
prices at the check out lane.
</P>
<P>
   Money managers and analysts said they expected the consolidation
to continue as toy makers look to diversify not just through
international expansion and internal creativity but also through
shopping sprees that combine the creative talents of smaller, niche
operators with the huge distribution and other resources of the
industry giants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historically this has been a very fragmented industry,'' said
Timothy Ghriskey, a senior portfolio manager at the Dreyfus Corp.,
which owned 190,000 shares of Mattel last year but has since sold
its stake. ``There is ease of entry, and it is driven by the
creative types. Along with all of corporate America, the toy
industry is beginning to benefit from consolidation and the
benefits of size, especially with the retail channel consolidating
into a couple of very strong hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, without the marketing resources and the influence to
secure coveted shelf space at Wal-Mart and Toys ``R'' Us, one-hit
wonders risk being shut out of the game no matter how hot their
products may be. And for larger manufacturers, paying for new
talent is often more cost-effective than waiting for the next
Cabbage Patch doll to come from within.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good for the acquired company because they often get a
good price and they lower the risk of having a one-shot item,''
Ghriskey said. ``And it's good for the acquirer because they can
fold it right into their existing structure, with few if any
additional costs other than the purchase price.''
</P>
<P>
   That is the thinking behind a string of mergers the last two
years. Besides the Learning Company and Tiger Electronics, other
transactions include Radica Games Ltd.'s acquisition last year of
Kid Active and the merger in 1997 of Leapfrog and Knowledge Kids
Enterprises, a unit of Knowledge Universe LLC..
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition by Radica gave the manufacturer of hand-held
casino theme games the Girl Tech line of electronic products for
girls. Radica also got Kid Active's Girl Tech Web site, which
broadened the company's marketing capabilities because it can now
promote directly to youngsters who visit the site. And the Leapfrog
transaction combined Knowledge Kids' financial resources with
Leapfrog's award-winning educational products, like Word Wizard, an
interactive system that teaches word recognition and reading
comprehension.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, there are still plenty of independent niche
companies left, like Ty Inc., maker of the wildly popular Beanie
Babies. But for many others, giving up some autonomy is a small
price for the potential these deals provide to make the most of
their products.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   In fact, Roger Shiffman, Tiger's president, said that had it not
been for the sale of his company to Hasbro last year, Tiger would
have been unable to capitalize fully on Furby's potential. Tiger
obtained the rights to Furby from the inventor in October 1997 and
rushed to get a rough prototype ready for last year's toy fair.
Retailers' interest was greater than the company expected, and
Tiger soon found itself trying to fill orders in eight months for a
million Furbys, whih would typically take about two years.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger supplied the concept for Furby, and Hasbro provided the
computerized drafting, mechanics, working samples and ultimately
the production operations to create the finished product. ``They
made things happen faster for us and helped us get the product out
because of how late we were,'' Shiffman said. The Furby frenzy
reflects just how these deals are designed to work _ teaming an
entrepreneurial company's risk-taking with a large company's might
to push the toy into the marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond Furby, ``We are going to benefit from their international
sales, and that is an area in which we were underperforming.,''
said Shiffman, who now runs Tiger for Hasbro. And, he said,
Hasbro's marketing resources and licensing agreements gave Tiger
the ability to create products tied to properties it would
otherwise not have access to, like Barney and toys tied to the new
Star Wars movie coming out in May.
</P>
<P>
   Mattel, too, has made several recent acquisitions that it says
have increased its competitiveness. In its case, Mattel was looking
for companies with established brands that also provided strategic
benefits. ``We've both benefited from the competencies we are
seeking and acquired related brands,'' said Glenn Bozarth, a
spokesman for Mattel.
</P>
<P>
   Through its purchase of Tyco Inc. in 1996, for example, Mattel
snagged the Fisher-Price line, which is popular with preschoolers.
The line includes Blue's Clues and Sesame Street plush products as
well as classics like Magna Doodle and View-Master. Then the
purchase last year of the Pleasant Co. gave the company the popular
American Girl dolls, plus some strategic advantages.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, while Barbie is popular with girls between about 3
and 8, the American Girl line expands the age spectrum to girls in
their early teens. And the American Girl line is sold primarily
through catalogs, allowing Mattel to use the Pleasant Co.'s
expertise in direct-to-consumer distribution to sell its other
brands. If successful, the approach would enable the company to be
less dependent on key retailers, an increasingly important factor
for toy makers, whose business suffered mightily last year when
Toys ``R'' Us slashed its orders to cut costs.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Mattel's recent disappointing financial performance,
including a 69 percent earnings decline in the fourth quarter of
1998, highlights the need for toy makers to further consolidate in
an attempt to reduce their dependence on few powerful retailers as
well as the whims of often finicky consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Toys are an inherently risky business,'' said Johnson of
Vanderbilt. ``The only way to insure stable earnings growth and the
kinds of things the Wall Street guys look for in a consumer product
company is through acquisition _ to buy successful products and
brands to keep diversifying all that massive risk they face.''

GENZYME LICENSES FOLKMAN ANTI-CANCER PROTEIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Genzyme Molecular Oncology Monday said it has licensed a
cancer-fighting protein developed by Dr. Judah Folkman, director of
the surgical research laboratories at Children's Hospital, which it
hopes to start testing in humans next year.
</P>
<P>
   Although financial terms of the Genzyme-Children's Hospital
agreement were not disclosed, Genzyme Molecular Oncology president
Gail Maderis said the protein is essentially the ``next
generation'' of Folkman's earlier controversial research.
</P>
<P>
   ``What excites us is that we have the capability to produce the
protein in one of our facilites,'' said Maderis.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Maderis nor Children's would reveal any details about
the new protein except to add that Dr. Michael S. O'Reilly, a
research fellow at Children's who co-discovered the protein, will
consult to Genzyme Molecular Oncology. Both researchers are
expected to publish their initial preclinical findings, she added.
</P>
<P>
   The paucity of information did not deter Wall Street, as Genzyme
Molecular Oncology shares closed at 3 1/2, up 5/8 in heavy trading
_ nearly four times its average daily volume. Shares of Genzyme
Corp., its parent company, closed at 53 up 1n 1/16.
</P>
<P>
   Folkman gained worldwide attention last spring when Folkman's
group said that two other compounds the reserchers had developed,
endostatin and angiostatin, could make cancerous tumors in mice
shrink and disappear by stopping the flow of blood to the growths.
A controversy arose when other researchers tried and failed to
reproduce Folkman's results. However, last month a new independent
research group confirmed that the endostatin protein halted the
growth of kidney tumors in mice.
</P>
<P>
   Both endostatin and angiostatin, which were first discovered in
1994, were licensed by Children's to EntreMed Inc., a small
biotechnology company in Bethesda, Md., which is planning to launch
human testing later this year with its corporate partner,
Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.
</P>
<P>
   Maderis said the two EntreMed drugs pose no conflict with the
new Genzyme licensed protein, although both companies would compete
against each other if the drug compounds are successful in clinical
trials and obtain US Food and Drug administration marketing
approval.

FINAL DELIBERATIONS LIKELY TO BE SECRET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After days of haggling, and despite powerful
arguments about public accountability, the Senate Monday night
appeared poised to hold its final impeachment deliberations behind
closed doors.
</P>
<P>
   Members of both parties had been pushing a ``sunshine plan'' for
nearly a week, and at first it seemed to be building momentum.
Several Republicans who rejected similar plans earlier in the
proceedings _ including Senator Chuck Hagel of Nebraska _ said they
believed the Senate should cast open its doors for the final debate
over whether to oust the president.
</P>
<P>
   But Monday, Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas, a Republican
sponsor of the plan, said she could find only 60 votes _ seven shy
of the two-thirds majority needed to change the century-old rules
governing the impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are mixed and torn,'' Hutchison said after the morning
GOP caucus, in which senators spent nearly an hour debating the
proposal.``I think it's going to be hard.''
</P>
<P>
   At the core of the opposition are conservative Republicans,
including Senators Phil Gramm of Texas and Orrin Hatch of Utah, who
for days have cited precedent and constitutionality as reasons why
the deliberations must stay shut.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott told members of the party
Monday that he would oppose opening the debate, creating an
obstacle that most senators admitted would be nearly impossible to
overcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you right now, we're not going to open the
proceedings,'' Gramm said after the caucus meeting. ``We have
public witnesses and closed jury deliberations every day in every
town in America. Why wouldn't we want to do it that way?''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the impetus to open the proceedings could
overpower Lott's opposition, Senator John F. Kerry said flat-out:
``No.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's not likely to happen,'' said Kerry, who strongly
supports open deliberations along with nearly all the Democrats.
``But I think it's a great shame.''
</P>
<P>
   Senator Edward M. Kennedy also said prospects for an open
deliberation process were grim, predicting ``a close vote'' on the
issue. But Senator Tom Harkin, a Democrat from Iowa and a sponsor
of the motion, held out hope that ``Lott would let people vote
their conscience.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hoping that Republicans will think deeply about why we are
closing the deliberations,'' Harkin said.
</P>
<P>
   Rules governing impeachment, which date back to the 19th
century, were reviewed and revised in 1986 by Senator Robert C.
Byrd, a West Virginia Democrat, and then-Senator Bob Dole, a Kansas
Republican. They decided at that time to keep the closed-door
deliberation provision intact.
</P>
<P>
   Lott cited those rules and historic precedent in making his
decision, and the ``sense was that the precedent was preserved then
(in 1986) and should be preserved now,'' said a spokesman for the
senator.
</P>
<P>
   But the majority leader, according to the spokesman, was also
mulling a way to address one of the Democrats' biggest concerns:
public accountability. Once the impeachment trial is concluded,
Lott is likely to file a motion that would allow senators to
discuss their remarks made behind closed doors. He also might file
a motion to add all the deliberations, which will be recorded, into
the public record at a later date.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison said she discerned serious opposition during the GOP
caucus, although she was joined publicly by Republican Senators
Olympia Snowe, Susan Collins, both of Maine; Arlen Specter of
Pennsylvania and Hagel in publicly supporting the measure, as well
as by Senator Thad Cochran of Mississippi, who said he was
``inclined to support it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The most sincere argument is that some people have not made up
their minds and that there would be no deliberations if it were in
open session. It would be 100 speeches,'' Hutchison said. ``Some
people feel that if you have more authority to talk back and forth,
perhaps it would make a difference in the decisions people make.''
</P>
<P>
   But there were far more cynical objectors, among them Senator
John H. Chafee, a Rhode Island Republican, who said open
deliberations would encourage senators to use up their allotted 15
minutes to talk before the television cameras, instead of striving
to finish the trial as quickly as possible. Senator Conrad Burns, a
Republican from Montana, agreed, saying the ``Senate operates much
better in closed session.''
</P>
<P>
   For Kennedy, that was precisely the point. The public should be
allowed to see senators at their best, he said, particularly ``if
we're going to expect the American people to accept the outcome.''
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, he said, ``We had two closed meetings. There
wasn't a word during those two closed meetings that the American
people couldn't have listened to or understood.''
</P>
<P>
   And on that point, at least, Kennedy had support from Republican
Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. Asked whether the public
should be allowed to see the deliberations, McConnell cracked:
``The public's not going to miss anything.''

KERNAN MASTERS BIRDS OF PREY TO TAKE WORLD ALPINE LEAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY CHAMBERLAIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   VAIL, Colo. _ Had it been another downhill at the Alpine World
Championships here Monday, Switzerland and Norway would be crowing
about keeping skiers from the Austrian juggernaut off the top-3
podium.
</P>
<P>
   But the downhill on the fearsome Birds of Prey track on Beaver
Creek was part one of a two-leg race that combines a slalom with
the speed race _ an event for skimeisters adept at both the
technical and speed ends of the sport.
</P>
<P>
   Swiss ace Bruno Kernen smoked down Birds of Prey, holding a high
line, nailing the tough turns and long 150-foot jumps, to put in
the fastest run of the day at 1 minute 13.40 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   His time was enough to knock Norwegian Andre Kvetjil Aamodt out
of the lead by 12 hundredths of a second and push teammate Lasse
Kjus into 3d, another six hundredths back. Tuesday at Vail, the
slalom end of the race will be run down the International course
that finishes in a stadium at Vail village, where some 20,000 fans
have gathered to cheer the world's best skiers. Crowds here,
according to race officials, have been the largest to watch live
ski racing in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for US fans, their best hope, 23-year-old Bode
Miller of Franconia, N.H., a product of Maine's Carrabassett Valley
Academy, spun off course in a spectacular crash after skiing nearly
the entire run in top-10 time.
</P>
<P>
   Had he finished, Miller would have been a strong contender for a
top-10 combined finish. Even as he finished, Miller, whose
strengths are in the technical end of racing, thought he would
still be eligible to race the slalom end of the race for a combined
time.
</P>
<P>
   But the jury ruled that Miller had missed a gate duing his fall
and disqualified Monday's run. He is still eligible and, at this
point, healthy enough to race in the slalom and GS competitions
coming up later in the week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really bummed,'' said Miller, who, in his best event,
GS, has beaten the vaunted Austrian Hermann Maier in two runs this
year on the World Cup. ``I just got back a little, and my ski
delaminated. But that's how this sport goes.''
</P>
<P>
   Kernen's run was the first ray of light for the Swiss men's team
at these games, though he has yet to negotiate the slalom course he
will face Tuesday on International. ``I think if I will ski safe,''
said Kernan, ``I can have a good result. The Vail course is much
tougher than the (Worlds combined course) at Sestriere (Italy).''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Kernen's slight lead, Tuesday's odds-on favorites are
the two Norwegians, Kjus and Aamodt _ the first champion to clinch
medals in all five alpine disciplines (When Jean Claude Killy won
all the Olympic races at Grenoble, there was no Super-G or
combined, events Aamodt has medalled in.) Aamodt is the reigning
combined champion from the 1997 Worlds in Sestriere.
</P>
<P>
   Aamodt and Kjus are products of a Norwegian training philosphy
that focuses on technical racing, which makes them better turners
on technical downhil courses and gives them the flexibility to ski
GS and slalom. The Austrians also hold to this philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   After Tuesday's slalom, the women's GS will run Thursday,
followed by the men's GS Friday, then women's slalom Saturday, and
mens' slalom Sunday to close the games.

 &HT;    Student charged with armed robbery alleged to have connections
to gang
 &HT;    By Wes Hills

<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ A Wright State University student, charged Monday
with committing an armed bank robbery with a university vehicle,
was associated with a gang that committed seven armed bank
robberies in the Columbus, Ohio area, according to federal agents.
</P>
<P>
   William Bolling, a senior in biological sciences, is charged in
the Nov. 12 armed robbery of Star Bank, 7560 Reading Road,
Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Magistrate Judge Michael R. Merz in Dayton ordered Bolling,
who faces a maximum 20-year prison term if convicted, bound over to
authorities in Columbus.
</P>
<P>
   In a sworn statement attached to Bolling's arrest warrant, FBI
Special Agent Kevin R. Horan described the robbery scheme.
</P>
<P>
   Two masked men, each with a handgun, entered Star Bank, screamed
obscenities and ordered everyone to the floor, Horan said. The pair
escaped with $26,942.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the robbery, Horan said, the FBI was
investigating three men wearing Halloween masks involved with seven
armed bank robberies in the Columbus area between August 1997 and
October 1998. Eyewitnesses described the robbers as black because
of ``voice characteristics, language and mode of dress,'' according
to Horan's statement.
</P>
<P>
   The three suspects in these robberies were Michael Kadunc, Shane
Connors and Michael Magliocca, Horan states. All three are white.
Kadunc was arrested in the robberies Oct. 30. Magliocca was picked
up on other charges, then bonded out.
</P>
<P>
   After Magliocca was arrested again Dec. 5, charged with robbing
the Star Bank in Cincinnati with Bolling, he provided information
regarding eight bank robberies.
</P>
<P>
   According to Horan:
</P>
<P>
   Magliocca said he came to Dayton to stay with Bolling after he
bonded out of jail in Columbus.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, Magliocca and Bolling were driving around in
Bolling's car and Magliocca complained he was broke and had no
vehicle because the FBI had taken his possessions when he was
arrested Oct. 30 .
</P>
<P>
   ``Bolling said he had always wanted to rob a bank but did not
want to do it alone or could never find the right person to do it
with,'' Horan said. Bolling also said he had stolen the keys to a
WSU car that they could use as a getaway vehicle, Horan said.
</P>
<P>
   Bolling and Magliocca bought ``Scream'' and ``Alien'' Halloween
masks, two semiautomatic pellet guns, matching grey hooded
sweatshirts and two blue duffel bags.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 11, Magliocca and Bolling went to Cincinnati to case
banks.
</P>
<P>
   After returning to Dayton, Bolling and Magliocca went to the WSU
motor pool lot and stole a Pontiac Grand Am, using keys provided by
Bolling.
</P>
<P>
   Bolling was no stranger to the neighborhood where the bank was
located.
</P>
<P>
   While he and Magliocca were parked near the bank to put on their
robbery gear, a man walked beside their car, recognized Bolling and
asked him what he was doing in his old neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Bolling told the man he was visiting his mother.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses to the Star Bank heist described the robbers as being
black based on their voice characteristics, Horan said. Bolling is
black.
</P>
<P>
   After the robbery, Magliocca and Bolling divided the money, and
Magliocca went to Greenville, N.C., where he was arrested Dec. 5,
Horan said.
</P>
<P>
   The WSU Grand Prix was recovered at the Wyoming Hills Apartments
in Dayton.

MICROSOFT REORGANIZATION TO STRESS CUSTOMERS OVER PRODUCTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By ANDREW POLLACK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Microsoft Corp. is moving to reorganize itself into
divisions focused on different customer groups rather than on
products, analysts and people close to the company said Monday.
Such a change would be a big shift in orientation for a company
that has long emphasized engineering over marketing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It clearly signals a refocusing on the customer rather than on
the technology,'' said Rob Enderle, an analyst at Giga Information
Group.
</P>
<P>
   Marianne Allison, a spokesman for Microsoft, said the company
periodically reorganized, but she insisted that no decision had
been made on a move this time.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Allison declined to either confirm or deny an article in The
Seattle Times that first reported a coming reorganization. She said
that any change ``wouldn't be for weeks or months from now.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft is now organized around different product areas. One
division, for instance, deals with the Windows operating system,
while another deals with applications and another with online
services.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposed reorganization, one group would focus on big
corporate customers and another on consumers. Other groups would
focus on knowledge workers, meaning small-business users and mobile
professionals, while a fourth would focus on software developers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have always viewed their technology as generic _ anybody
can use it,'' said Andrew C. Brosseau, an analyst with SG Cowen.
The reorganization, he said, ``is a recognition by them that the
customer they are serving has become more varied,'' ranging from
consumers to big corporations. Still, he said, the reorganization
sounds ``more evolutionary than revolutionary.''
</P>
<P>
   One consequence would be that responsibility for Windows could
end up being split between the corporate group, which would
concentrate on Windows NT for corporations, and the consumer group,
which would inherit Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   That could make it more difficult for the company to divest
itself of its operating-system business if the federal government
prevails in its antitrust suit against the company and the court
orders such a move. Ms. Allison, the Microsoft spokesman, said the
possible reorganization ``has nothing to do with the lawsuit.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a reorganization might also signal a delay in the company's
announced intention to unify the core software of Windows 2000, the
program for large corporations once known as Windows NT, and the
consumer version of Windows for personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   The reorganization is being led by Steven Ballmer, who was named
president last year and given responsibility for day-to-day
operations by Bill Gates, the company's chairman. Ballmer, whose
background is in sales and marketing rather than programming, has
been intensively reviewing operations.
</P>
<P>
   To head the consumer group, Microsoft is seeking to lure back
Brad Silverberg, who led the development of Windows 95 and Internet
Explorer, the Web browser. Silverberg, 44, has been on leave from
the company since June 1997, though he has consulted for it
occasionally and has attended some company retreats.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Allison said the company had been talking to Silverberg and
others about leading the existing interactive media division, which
focuses on online services. The position has been vacant since the
former head of the division, Pete Higgins, resigned in November.
</P>
<P>
   Presumably, because of Silverberg's background, that division
would be expanded in the reorganization to have responsibility also
for Windows and other software for consumer personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   When he was at Microsoft, Silverberg favored making the
company's Internet Explorer browser compatible with all computers,
not just those running Windows. He argued that the company had to
prepare for the time when the Internet might displace Windows as
the locus of personal computing.
</P>
<P>
   His view was opposed by James Allchin, who contended that
Windows should remain the core of the company. Gates backed
Allchin, and Internet Explorer was integrated into Windows.
Silverberg went on leave and Microsoft was revamped into the
current structure.

WEARY BUT ATTENTIVE, THE SENATE LISTENS TO FINAL ARGUMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (See related stories: IMPEACH-TRIAL, IMPEACH-PERJURY,
IMPEACH-DEBATE, IMPEACH-CENSURE, IMPEACH-CLINTON) 
(sw) 
 By FRANCIS X. CLINES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The senator sighed and asked that his name not be
published as the price for candor. In return, he expressed the
common sense of perseverance triumphant on what he characterized as
this ``Much Ado'' day _ the closing round of arguments in the
national ordeal of President Clinton's impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they're telling us today is basically `Much Ado About
Nothing' because we've heard everything they have to say many times
over,'' said the senator, a Republican whose final impeachment
verdict is far from clear. He then went on into the chamber and,
far from idly cruising through the familiar, proceeded to take very
careful notes throughout the day's argumentation, repetitious as it
all was.
</P>
<P>
   The sheer attentiveness of the Senate impeachment court has been
noteworthy through the weeks of the trial. And on Monday, it seemed
exemplary as the vying lawyers proceeded through the oft-told tale
of the president and the intern, down through all those details:
the gifts, the affidavit, the fleeting White House sex, the
denials, and, even, videotaped appearances of Monica Lewinsky and
the president in his mid-summer recantings that confirmed his
misbehavior.
</P>
<P>
   At the Capitol steps, a few outlandish incidents took place. A
man in his underwear played the guitar; another intruder put on a
gorilla mask and actually managed to have his picture taken with
two passing senators who looked taken by surprise in their
weariness.
</P>
<P>
   Any excitement in the air seemed related to the simple fact that
the Senate court finally was rounding onto the promised closing
date of Friday. Under the circumstances, after the year-long
scandal's erosion of the nation's patience, the actual approach of
``closure,'' as therapists would have it, seemed a stunning
novelty, as if Dickens could be rewritten and his interminable tale
of the Jarndyce vs. Jarndyce lawsuit in ``Bleak House'' could
actually be ended.
</P>
<P>
   Out in the corridors, the prosecutors were spreading fresh
affidavits, claiming new evidence, but there seemed no appetite for
11th-hour tangents in the chamber. Senators were dutifully jotting
down summary notes, leaning forward to measure the final
performances of the lawyers, and keeping their own counsel.
</P>
<P>
   By the closing hours, the sense of weariness was being conceded
even by some of the Republican prosecutors, all 13 of whom took
this final opportunity to address the Senate and the nation beyond.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost like we're performing and every day we get a
review,'' Rep. Ed Bryant complained of the attention of the news
media. Actually, the Tennessee lawmaker, like his colleagues, shied
not all from copious television time, especially on the Sunday talk
shows, in arguing far beyond the Senate court for the president's
banishment.
</P>
<P>
   By the end, some senators were literally slouching toward Friday
at their desks. A dozen or more took the unusual posture of
standing up and moving discreetly about the chamber during one
midafternoon bout of argumentation, as if fearing some fresh
scandal of drowsiness.
</P>
<P>
   The White House defense lawyers, their argument time done, could
only sit as mute as the senators while the prosecutors reserved two
final hours for denunciations of the president.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton lawyers looked spent. They sat stonily as one
prosecutor visited for one more time a familiar area of allegation
(``I did not touch those parts...''). They looked near glassy-eyed
as Rep. Charles Canady's summation approached a Johnny Cochran
couplet (``There was no way to explain away the DNA''). They failed
to appreciate the back-handed compliment to their lawyering from
the chief prosecutor, Rep. Henry Hyde of Illinois. (``You may dress
the shepherd in silk, but he will still smell of the goat.'')
</P>
<P>
   The senators were exhorted to ``muster their courage'' to remove
the president. Hyde himself mustered a veritable Bartlett's
Familiar Quotations in offering his last impassioned plea for
conviction. ``We happy few,'' he said, turning in Shakesperean
tribute to his fellow House Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Quoting the 18th-century historian, Edward Gibbon, Hyde acidly
denounced the president by comparing him to a corrupt Roman
emperor, Septimius Severus: ``Severus promised, only to betray; he
flattered, only to rule; and however he might occasionally bind
himself by oath and treaty, his conscience, obsequious to his
interest, always released him from the inconvenient obligation.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus, with a final burst of the grinding passion that marked the
past year of scandal investigation, the case against the president
was completed at 6:35 p.m. before the Senate court.
</P>
<P>
   Senators left quickly, looking eager to at last break their
silence and deliberate Clinton's fate. No one claimed this day
proved crucial.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the extent that any senator's mind will be moved one way or
another on the final votes,'' said Sen. John Warner, R-Va., ``That
could only take place behind closed doors in a full deliberation of
all 100, listening carefully to one another.''
</P>
<P>
   He smiled at that looming duty. ``No TV, no newspapers,'' he
continued rather happily, moving toward Friday as if toward
deliverance.

HMO PLANS AGREE TO HELP PAY MEMBERS' COSTS IN CLINICAL TRIALS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Minn.)  (mk) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After years of resistance, health maintenance
organizations have agreed to help pay the costs of care for members
who enroll in clinical trials evaluating new drugs and medical
procedures.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, thousands of patients could receive promising new
treatments they were denied in the past.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, ``for support of clinical trials,'' was
negotiated over the last year by the National Institutes of Health
and the American Association of Health Plans, the trade group of
the managed care industry, but has not yet been announced.
</P>
<P>
   For years, patients and federal officials have complained that
HMOs refused to help cover the costs of clinical trials. Many
patients have successfully sued HMOs that refused to pay for
certain treatments on the ground that they were experimental.
</P>
<P>
   With about half of all Americans now in some type of managed
care, this refusal threatened to become a major hindrance to
biomedical research, even as scientists said they were entering a
golden age of medical discovery, with many new therapies on the
horizon. Dr. Harold Varmus, director of the National Institutes of
Health, pushed for the new agreement as a way to bring the fruits
of basic research to bear on medical practice.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, managed care plans will try to increase the
number of their patients who participate in clinical trials
approved and financed by the National Institutes of Health. The
institutes subsidize hundreds of research projects to study the
effectiveness of new treatments, preventive measures and diagnostic
techniques for cancer, heart disease, AIDS, arthritis and dozens of
other ailments.
</P>
<P>
   Knowledgeable patients often want to participate in clinical
research to gain access to promising new medications long before
the drugs are approved for the market. But many managed care plans
have refused to pay even the routine medical costs for people who
enroll in such trials.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new agreement, the American Association of Health
Plans says, it will encourage managed care plans to ``reimburse the
routine patient-care costs associated with NIH-sponsored clinical
trials, provided those costs are not substantially higher than the
costs a plan would incur in the course of standard treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   Researchers contend that the costs of care for people in
clinical trials are essentially the same as those for patients
receiving standard therapies, but that is a question to be studied
in trials that will now be enrolling HMO patients.
</P>
<P>
   United Healthcare Corp., a big managed care company based in
Minnetonka, Minn., said it would start by covering the costs of
care for cancer patients in clinical trials. ``Only 2 percent of
eligible cancer patients across the nation are enrolled in clinical
trials,'' said Dr. Lee Newcomer, chief medical officer at United.
``There may be many reasons for that, but we are removing the
payment barrier.''
</P>
<P>
   United, with 13 million members in 32 states, has agreed to pay
for any of its members who enroll in clinical trials sponsored by
the Coalition of National Cancer Cooperative Groups, which consists
of six nationwide networks with a total of 12,000 cancer
researchers supported by the NIH.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Robert Comis, president of the coalition, said: ``So often
patients and their physicians do not consider entering a clinical
trial for treatment because most managed care organizations and
health care insurers typically do not pay the costs. United
Healthcare is helping to change that.''
</P>
<P>
   Under pressure from Congress, Medicare officials are also
re-examining their policy.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare's stated policy is to deny payment for services that
are not reasonable and necessary for the diagnosis and treatment of
illness or injury. The purpose of clinical trials is, by
definition, to test treatments that are unproven, so they are
generally excluded from coverage, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The National Academy of Sciences is studying whether Medicare
should cover some of the costs of clinical trials and, if so, what
the criteria should be.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Medicare officials have said they do not want to pay for
treatments in poor-quality trials, and they are also reluctant to
pay research costs beyond the costs of routine patient care. The
extra costs may result from the purchase of new technology, the
additional monitoring needed for patients in research studies, and
the work of compiling and analyzing data, though typically it is
the sponsors of clinical trials that pay these costs.
</P>
<P>
   Newcomer, of United Healthcare, said he doubted that his
company's new policy on cancer trials would increase costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``My intuition, my guess, is that this will not add to our
costs,'' he said, ``but that's the reason we are doing these
studies, to find out whether there are added costs.''
</P>
<P>
   Comis, the president of the coalition of cancer research groups,
said, ``There is growing evidence that the costs of care for people
in clinical trials are essentially the same as the costs for
patients receiving standard therapies.''
</P>
<P>
   In a report to Congress last year, Dr. Richard Klausner,
director of the National Cancer Institute, said the reluctance of
HMOs to help pay for the care of people in clinical trials had
become ``a serious barrier to progress'' in cancer research.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the legitimate responsibility of the insurance
industry,'' he said, ``to reimburse the costs of routine medical
care of cancer patients in all phases of high-quality research
trials.''

FIGURE SKATING RULES ARE RIFE WITH PROS AND CONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ The cards and letters have been coming in for
weeks now. (itals)``Best of luck . . . I know you'll have a
wonderful pro career.''(unitals) ``I'm like, what? You think I'm a
professional?'' Michelle Kwan says.
</P>
<P>
   She may be the world pro figure skating champion, but Kwan is
also the amateur champion. Or, as they say around the International
Skating Union, she's both the eligible and ineligible champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't that weird?'' says Kwan, who's in town this week to
defend her US amateur/eligible crown. ``It does confuse people. It
confuses the skaters, too.''
</P>
<P>
   In sport's ``open'' era, which is open some of the time to some
of the skaters, amateurs and pros can compete against each other
today but not tomorrow, here but not there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's, like, chaos,'' Kwan says.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, TV viewers watched Russia's Maria Butyrskaya skate
under one set of rules in the European championships in the
afternoon and another set of rules in the Japan Open in the
evening. And neither event was live.
</P>
<P>
   Skating now is like tennis used to be, and nobody seems very
happy about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's absolute confusion as to what it all means,'' says
James Disbrow, president of the US Figure Skating Association.
</P>
<P>
   Olympic champion Tara Lipinski turned pro and didn't compete at
all this season. Todd Eldredge and Ilya Kulik stayed amateur but
didn't skate in amateur events. Kwan skipped the Grand Prix but
will compete in the World Championships. And Alexei Yagudin
competed in everything.
</P>
<P>
   The post-Olympic year is usually unsettled, as skaters stay
amateur (i.e. eligible for ISU events), turn pro (ineligible), or
take a breather to sort out options. But this season has been more
turbulent than ever since the ISU sanctioned 10 open events in
addition to its Grand Prix series for eligible skaters.
</P>
<P>
   That meant that Kwan and Yagudin, the world amateur titlists,
could compete against the likes of Oksana Baiul and Kurt Browning
in the World Professional Championships. What it doesn't mean is
that skating will follow ice hockey and basketball and tennis and
open the Olympics to all comers.
</P>
<P>
   Once you've crossed the threshold into the ineligible funhouse
of made-for-TV exhibitions, you're on the wrong side of Olympus.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot work for Coca-Cola and sell Pepsi-Cola,'' says ISU
president Ottavio Cinquanta. ``This is life.''
</P>
<P>
   The only reason the ISU let its top stars perform in pro events
was to entice them to stay eligible. After watching Baiul and
Lipinski cash in their gold medals shortly after the Games, the ISU
wanted to make sure it kept its marquee names on board for 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not so stupid to lose another talent like Lipinski,''
says Cinquanta. ``Do you think I want Kwan to leave?''
</P>
<P>
   The ISU couldn't care less about the pros, whom it views as
defectors, and sees no reason to let them opt back in when the
Olympic year comes around.
</P>
<P>
   ``They left intentionally,'' says Cinquanta. ``We are not
available to temporarily enhance every four years their
reputations. This is not a supermarket.''
</P>
<P>
   Why should the pros be allowed to skate in glorified exhibitions
judged by ``Cindy Crawford and Mr. Schwarzenegger,'' Cinquanta
argues, and still be eligible for the Games? If they want an
admission ticket to Olympus, the ISU says, let them play by
eligible rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want a Harvard or a Yale degree, you cannot say: `I
have studied in Japan. I want a diploma,' '' muses Cinquanta.
``They take you to the mental hospital in an ambulance.''
</P>
<P>
   An open Olympics is probably a moot point, anyway. When the ISU
allowed pros to compete in Lillehammer in 1994, they won the pairs
(Ekaterina Gordeeva and Sergei Grinkov) and took a bronze in the
dance (Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean), but were soundly
thwacked in the individual events. Viktor Petrenko and Brian
Boitano, the previous champions, finished out of the medals, as did
two-time gold medalist Katarina Witt. Even if the ISU threw the
Games open next time, few pros would probably opt in.
</P>
<P>
   Fact is, skating is the only sport in which the amateurs not
only usually beat the pros but also make more money.
</P>
<P>
   ``The terms professional and amateur have no financial
meaning,'' concedes Cinquanta. ``When they say the professional is
Mr. Boitano, I laugh. He may make less money than Mr. Kulik.''
</P>
<P>
   The pros and amateurs may mix it up in the opens but they might
as well be living in different universes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the entertainers versus the competitors,'' says Disbrow.
</P>
<P>
   The amateurs skate much more difficult technical routines _ a
quadruple-triple combination is standard in the short program and a
quad (or two) and seven or eight triples are all but mandatory in
the long. The pros, many of whom are over 30, skate more artistic,
interpretive programs with limited jumps.
</P>
<P>
   The opens are a stylistic compromise. Even so, the idea of
skating more demanding programs against younger amateurs in front
of ISU judges was enough to keep several pros _ most notably
Boitano and Kristi Yamaguchi _ on the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   As expected, the amateurs dominated the opens and Kwan and
Yagudin breezed to the US Pro titles, which merely added to the
confusion and infuriated ABC, which is paying the ISU $100 million
for a 10-year TV package that includes the Grand Prix circuit and
the World Championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expected to be the exclusive eligible-skater network,''
says Robin Stratton Rivera, ABC's sports programming director.
``But you could see it eroding with the opens.''
</P>
<P>
   Though some eligible skaters like Yagudin and Nicole Bobek
performed in both Grand Prix and open events, most opted for the
opens, which were less taxing and involved far less travel.
Virtually all of the opens were held in the US; the Grand Prix
circuit had skaters hopscotching from North America to Europe to
Asia back to Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Eldredge, the five-time US champ who's abdicating his throne
this week and giving up a chance to regain his world title, stuck
to the opens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Normally, I'd be counting down the days until Nationals,'' he
says. ``But I'm really enjoying this year. I've competed against
the same guys I would have competed against _ just under different
rules. They've kept it so open that you could do whatever you
wanted. It was fantastic.''
</P>
<P>
   It may have been fantastic for Eldredge, whom the ISU considers
to be on ``active rest,'' but it was frustrating for Kwan, who was
kept from defending her Skate America title because she wouldn't
commit to the Grand Prix circuit. And it was bewildering for the
skating public, which isn't sure who can skate when against whom
and for what anymore. Not even in boxing can someone hold both the
amateur and pro titles.
</P>
<P>
   It may be that skating has morphed into such a hybrid of sport
and show biz (Kwan has a Disney contract) that competitive clarity
is both impossible and irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Except for the Olympics, I don't think you watch skating to
really care about who's coming out where,'' muses ABC analyst Dick
Button, who directs the World Pro Championships. ``It's really an
exhibition with the extra added attraction of having someone win.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the post Nancy-and-Tonya era, with TV channels glutted
with a mishmash of live and taped competitions and exhibitions, the
spectator can no longer be sure who's winning what _ or whether
anyone's winning at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``The customer is confused,'' says Disbrow. ``We need to
identify what it is that the customer is going to see. What are the
skaters competing in and how do they qualify for it?''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody wants a repeat of this season, when the ISU seemed to
change its mind every other week about whether it wanted opens.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very bumpy path,'' says Button, who directed four of
the events.
</P>
<P>
   So when next month's Grand Prix final and amateur world
championships are done, the ISU and the USFSA and the pros and the
networks hope to sit down and hash out a system everyone can live
with _ and recognize.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in the restaurant business for 16 years,'' says
Disbrow. ``And the bottom line has always been: What do the
customers want and how can I bring it to them?''

RAINIER BEER BRAND SOLD, FATE OF SEATTLE BREWERY UNCERTAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BILL VIRGIN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Stroh Brewery Co. said Monday it is selling the
Rainier beer brand _ but not the Seattle plant that makes it _ to
Pabst Brewing Co.
</P>
<P>
   Pabst already owns the Olympia brewery at Tumwater, Wash., and
is expected to move production of the Rainier brand, one of the
best selling in this region, there.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves the fate of the Rainier brewery, with its landmark
red R visible along Interstate 5 just south of downtown Seattle,
and its 230 employees in doubt. Stroh said it would look for a
buyer for the plant, as well as for Portland's Blitz-Weinhard
brewery; the Henry Weinhard brand made there is being sold to
Miller Brewing Co.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not clear yet who in an industry marked by overcapacity
and little sales growth might want the Seattle plant.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's really no need for any more capacity at this point,''
said Tim Swanson, an analyst at A.G. Edwards &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Stroh itself only said it would sell the Seattle plant as an
operating brewery or ``for alternative use.''
</P>
<P>
   Stroh spokeswoman Lacey Logan said the deal won't close for 60
days, pending Justice Department approval. After that, Stroh
expects to sign nine-month contracts to make beer for Pabst until
the conversion is complete.
</P>
<P>
   For Rainier employees, the limited prospects for a buyer means
that ``as of January 2000, they don't have jobs,'' said Lee Watson,
business representative and treasurer for Operating Engineers Local
286 in Renton.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit-based, family-owned Stroh said it is selling its
portfolio of brands including Stroh, Rainier, Old Milwaukee,
Schlitz, Schaefer, Old Style, Schmidt's and Lone Star to Pabst, but
just one brewery, in Pennsylvania. It is selling Weinhard and
Mickey's to Miller; Pabst in turn is selling its Hamm's and Olde
English 800 brands to Miller. Stroh doesn't have buyers yet for its
breweries in Seattle, Portland, Texas, North Carolina and
Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   Stroh is the nation's fourth largest brewer in an industry that
may have room for a few national players such as Anheuser-Busch,
Coors, Miller and a consolidator like Pabst. Stroh had hoped to be
one of those consolidators _ someone who buys brand names and shuts
excess production capacity, often contracting out production to
others _ but said the state of the beer industry and the offer from
Pabst and Miller made it a good time to get out of the business.
</P>
<P>
   The big problem for the industry is that Americans aren't
drinking enough beer. There's been little growth in overall beer
consumption _ ``You could make a case that there's not been growth
since the 1970s,'' said Paul Shipman, chief executive officer of
Seattle-based Redhook Ale Brewery Inc.
</P>
<P>
   That means the popularity of microbrews and specialty or craft
beers like Redhook came at the expense of the major national brews,
and even in the specialty category sales growth has stalled and
brewers are suffering financially.
</P>
<P>
   Swanson said it's a telling point that Miller, the nation's
second-biggest brewer, has enough excess capacity that as part of
this latest deal it agreed to expand its contract brewing for
Pabst.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually the beer business is going look like other American
industries, such as banking, which are characterized by giant
national players and some small local companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Either you're a real small specialty (brewer) or you're real
big and have the marketing muscle,'' said George Hancock, chief
executive of Seattle's Pyramid Breweries. ``We don't see anyone in
the middle.''
</P>
<P>
   Rainier Beer dates back to 1878, when German imigrant Andrew
Hemrich founded Seattle Brewing &AMP; Malting. After prohibition,
Canadian brewers Fritz and Emil Sick licensed the name, which had
been sold to a California company, and eventually acquired full
ownership. For a time Sicks' Breweries Ltd. was a part of Canadian
beer giant Molson; later it was a publicly traded company which
included the Robert Mondavi winery.
</P>
<P>
   Rainier Beer became a part of the Pacific Northwest cultural
landscape not only through the Sicks' community involvement (a
Seattle baseball park bore the name and was home to the
minor-league Rainiers and major-league Seattle Pilots). The brand
was also featured in some of the region's quirkiest and popular
advertising, such as the running of the RainBeers (basically a herd
of bottles with legs sticking out of them) and a motorcycle whose
gears shifted to the whine of the product's name.
</P>
<P>
   Rainier Brewing was bought by G. Heileman in 1977, which in turn
was bought by Australian financier Alan Bond in 1987. Overloaded
with Bond's debt, Heileman filed for bankrupcy court protection in
1991. Dallas investment firm Hicks, Muse &AMP; Co. bought Heileman and
Rainier in 1993; Stroh bought Heileman in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Watson said the latest in a string of sales for the Seattle
brewery was another example of ``corporate America taking the money
and running.''
</P>
<P>
   Pabst, headquartered in San Antonio, owns such brands as
Olympia, Falstaff, Ballantine, Lucky Lager and Pearl.

FOR THIRD DAY, AMERICAN CANCELS FLIGHTS IN DISPUTE WITH PILOTS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Donald J. Carty took over as chairman and chief executive
of the AMR Corp. in May, he said that his first priority was to
improve the bitter labor relations at American Airlines, the
country's second-largest carrier, that had developed under his
combative predecessor, Robert L. Crandall.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Carty is learning just how big a challenge that is.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, American was forced to cancel 22 percent, or 500, of
its 2,250 daily flights as scores of pilots called in sick for the
third day in a row. The pilots are angry about American's plans to
integrate Reno Air, a small Western carrier it bought in December,
into its larger network.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute has inconvenienced thousands of passengers and
threatens to disrupt the coming President's Day holiday weekend,
when flights all over the country will be full. But before that
happens, Carty hinted strongly at a news conference on Monday,
American would seek a court injunction ordering the pilots to stop
their job action.
</P>
<P>
   That the airline is facing such difficulty came as a surprise to
executives at other carriers and to Wall Street analysts. Shares of
AMR, American's parent company, fell $2.9375 a share Monday to
close at $57 on the first day of trading since the disruption
began.
</P>
<P>
   ``This should never have happened,'' said Samuel C. Buttrick, an
industry analyst with Paine Webber in New York. ``Other airlines in
the past have worked out pilot-integration issues on much larger
mergers without this unnecessary disruption to operations.'' He
estimated the impact on AMR's earnings this quarter around 5 cents
a share.
</P>
<P>
   Carty expressed dismay Monday, asserting: ``It is hard for me to
believe that this is really about the Reno acquisition. I wish I
knew what it was. But I think it is clearly about more than that.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that American was willing to reopen talks at any time
with the Allied Pilots Association, the independent union that
represents American's 9,200 pilots. The union has said the same
thing, though no new talks have been scheduled since negotiations
broke off on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Gregg Overman, an association spokesman, said Monday that the
disruption was a ``grass-roots initiative'' that was not led by the
union.
</P>
<P>
   For the past two weeks, union leaders had debated asking members
to refuse to fly voluntary overtime if an agreement with the
company could not be reached. That would have taken several days
before it began seriously affecting American's operations. But
after negotiations ended without a resolution on Friday night,
scores of pilots apparently took it upon themselves to call in sick
beginning Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would really like to see a more collegial and cooperative
atmosphere established at American Airlines,'' Overman said. ``I
guess it is fair to say that we look at this negotiation as an
opportunity to see where the rubber meets the road, and it doesn't
seem to be happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the pilots current anger can be traced back to their
abortive strike two years ago, which was ended only minutes after
it began when President Clinton, exercising his executive powers,
ordered the pilots back to work. An agreement was later worked out
under the auspices of an emergency board appointed by Clinton, but
even though a majority of the pilots voted in favor of it, many
felt it was imposed on them.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a feeling that our pilots didn't have the say that
they should have in the process,'' Overman said.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, several members of a group of hardline pilots that
was instrumental in the defeat of a tentative contract between
American and the union that preceded the strike have been elected
to the union's 18-person board of directors.
</P>
<P>
   Reno Air, which has 300 pilots and 25 jets, has been a sensitive
issue with the pilots union because the airline was founded soon
after American scaled back its operations on the West Coast in 1992
and laid off 610 pilots. Reno Air, which pays its pilots roughly
half the average salary at American, picked up many of the recently
abandoned routes and entered into a marketing partnership with
American.
</P>
<P>
   Carty said Monday that he decided to buy Reno partly to
eliminate the resentment felt by the pilots. The acquisition, he
added, would allow American pilots to rise to captain's rank faster
and would offer new flying opportunities in the West.
</P>
<P>
   But the pilots say that Carty's plan to take up to 18 months to
integrate Reno into American's operations violates their contract.
And they are eager to set a precedent in case American acquires a
much larger airline, such as US Airways or Alaska Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Carty said that the union's integration proposal would cost and
additional $40 to $50 million a year, greatly inflating Reno's $124
million purchase price.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Railway Labor Act, the law that governs labor
relations in the airline business, job actions such as a partial
strike are severely proscribed. Carty implied that he would seek a
court order ending the job action if the disruptions continued. But
it is not clear whether the pilots would continue to call in sick,
citing their right under federal rules not to fly if they do not
feel physically fit.
</P>
<P>
   That does not bode well for happier relations between labor and
management at American, but Carty is still hopeful. ``Our objective
is to be the airline with the best labor relations in the
industry,'' he said. ``We obviously have some ways to go.''

ADVERTISING: MERCEDES-BENZ OF NORTH AMERICA DISMISSES AD AGENCY
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The fraying ties between Mercedes-Benz of North
America and its agency since November 1993, Lowe &AMP; Partners/SMS in
New York, finally snapped Monday when Lowe and two affiliates were
dismissed, effective April 30.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to dismiss Lowe, part of the Lowe Group unit of the
Interpublic Group of Companies, set off an acrimonious dispute that
included a statement from Lowe describing agency executives as
``appalled.''
</P>
<P>
   The dismissal also puts up for grabs a marquee-name automotive
account with billings estimated at $125 million. Mercedes-Benz
joins a growing list of large marketers, particularly in
competitive consumer product categories, to have recently dismissed
or changed agencies; others include Dell Computer, Gateway,
Mastercard and Sprint.
</P>
<P>
   Mercedes-Benz will initially concentrate its search for a
successor shop at two giant agency companies that work for its
parent, DaimlerChrysler AG. One is the Omnicom Group, with agencies
handling brands like Dodge, and the other is True North
Communications, with agencies handling brands like Chrysler, Jeep
and Plymouth.
</P>
<P>
   The dismissal of Lowe had been expected since last week, when
this columnist reported that Mercedes-Benz executives had met with
Lowe officials to express concerns about issues deemed detrimental
to continuing their relationship. One concern centered on changes
in top management at the agency, the executives said, and the other
centered on potential conflicts stemming from the work performed
for a major DaimlerChrysler rival, the General Motors Corp., by
Lowe sibling agencies under the Interpublic umbrella like
McCann-Erickson Worldwide Advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``The unhappiness with Lowe dates back well into 1998,'' said
Michael Jackson, president and chief executive at Mercedes-Benz in
Montvale, N.J. ``And it became clear that the situation was
becoming more difficult, not better.''
</P>
<P>
   The dismissal seems puzzling because Lowe's campaigns for
Mercedes-Benz have been among the most honored in advertising and
sales have increased substantially since the agency gained the
account. Lowe did outstanding work, achieved results in the market
_ yet will soon be on the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did not lose the account because of the quality of the work
or the quality of service we provided to Mercedes-Benz,'' said Lee
Garfinkel, chairman and chief creative officer at Lowe. In addition
to Lowe, the affiliates losing Mercedes-Benz business are Lowe Fox
Pavlika, which has handled direct marketing accounts, and Diamond
Promotion Group, the promotional agency.
</P>
<P>
   There had been persistent speculation that Mercedes-Benz
executives were miffed about the retirement of Marvin Sloves, who
until Dec. 31 had served as chairman at Lowe along with Garfinkel.
Sloves had been particularly close to executives at Mercedes-Benz
since his previous agency, Scali, McCabe, Sloves in New York, was
awarded the auto marketer's account in 1992. The account _ and
Sloves _ came to Lowe in November 1993 when Scali, McCabe was
acquired and merged into Lowe.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson acknowledged that there were ``a lot of factors
involved'' in the dismissal, primarily ``concerns about the
business process and the creative process,'' and ``Marvin is one of
them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we had a relationship with the agency that I would
call incredible,'' Jackson said, ``resulting from a tremendous
investment on both sides starting with Marvin.''
</P>
<P>
   Garfinkel said that ``the only concerns Michael Jackson ever
expressed to me'' about the account ``were about Marvin leaving,''
which were meant to be addressed by a two-year contract for Sloves
to serve as a consultant to Lowe.
</P>
<P>
   A telephone call to Sloves on Monday was not returned. Monday
was two months to the day that Sloves announced his retirement from
Lowe.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Draznin, a spokesman for Lowe, said that the agency was
``considering its position, including the pursuit of legal
remedies.'' Lowe sued five top executives of a predecessor to Lowe
Fox after they left in October 1996 to start their own agency; the
suit was settled out of court.
</P>
<P>
   Two advertising trade publications, Frohlinger's Marketing
Report and Adweek, reported last month that Sloves was talking to
executives at other agencies about joining them along with the
Mercedes-Benz account.
</P>
<P>
   However, Jackson said that Sloves ``is not part of this
process'' in searching for a successor to Lowe, adding, ``Marvin
does not enter into the equation whatsoever.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Eberhardt, vice president for marketing at Mercedes-Benz,
said that the search ``will not start with discussions with
individual agencies,'' but rather with the parents.
</P>
<P>
   If that does not yield a new agency, he added, ``we are also
prepared to go into a review.''
</P>
<P>
   Omnicom agencies working for DaimlerChrysler include
Clemenger/BBDO in Australia and BBDO Detroit, units of BBDO
Worldwide; Pentacom; Rapp Collins Worldwide, and GFMO.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within Omnicom, there are probably a number of options,'' said
John Wren, president and chief executive in New York. ``I have to
sit and listen to the client first before I speculate about where
the account should go.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never met nor have I ever spoken with Marvin,'' he
added, ``which some people find amazing.'' Wren did, however,
disclose that ``I have a Mercedes; that's what I'm driven around in
every day.''
</P>
<P>
   True North agencies working for DaimlerChrysler include Bozell
Worldwide. Bruce Mason, chief executive at True North in Chicago,
referred inquiries to David Bell, president and chief executive at
Bozell in New York, who was out of the country. Trade publications
have suggested that Mercedes-Benz could be handled by the other
worldwide True North agency network, Foote, Cone &AMP; Belding.
</P>
<P>
   About 65 of the estimated 450 employees at Lowe are assigned to
the Mercedes-Benz account. ``We are evaluating the situation as we
move forward,'' Draznin said, adding, ``obviously, we have to
service the account for the next 84 days.'' That service includes a
campaign for the new models of the S-Class Mercedes-Benz, due early
next month.

LEFTIST OPPOSITION PARTY IN MEXICO WINS TWO GOVERNORS' RACES  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By JULIA PRESTON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Elections for governor in two states over the
weekend, the nation's first major voting this year, demonstrate the
continuing growth of a left-of-center party that has capitalized on
dissension in the governing party.
</P>
<P>
   The challenger, the Party of the Democratic Revolution, won the
top post in Baja California Sur, which includes Los Cabos and other
beach resorts that Americans visit. Its candidate, Leonel Cota
Montano, trounced his opponent from the governing Institutional
Revolutionary Party, or PRI, 55 percent to 36 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Cota built his coalition with the help of disgruntled members of
the governing party who had hoped to be the party's candidate or to
help choose the candidate. They bolted to the Party of the
Democratic Revolution when their views were disregarded.
</P>
<P>
   The voting on Sunday was uneventful, with few irregularities
reported. The PRI did not challenge Cota's victory.
</P>
<P>
   Since July 1997, the Party of the Democratic Revolution has won
three gubernatorial posts. In Zacatecas and Tlaxcala, the party
also achieved statehouse victories last year by winning disaffected
leaders from the governing party.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the political leader of the party, Cuauhtemoc
Cardenas Solorzano, won the powerful office of mayor of Mexico
City, with official stature equal to a governor.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago the party, which criticizes market-oriented
policies and favors a strong role for the state in the economy and
politics, labored under the image of a scrappy opposition that was
good at organizing street protests but not at governing.
</P>
<P>
   In the election on Sunday in the troubled southwestern state of
Guerrero, the two parties battled to a photo finish. According to
official results, with 98 percent of the vote counted at midday
Monday, the PRI candidate, Rene Juarez Cisneros, was leading, with
48 percent of the vote, ahead of Felix Salgado Macedonio of the
Party of the Democratic Revolution, who had 46.
</P>
<P>
   Although the governing party celebrated, the president of the
Party of the Democratic Revolution, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador,
rejected the results as a ``government-engineered fraud.'' He
announced that his party would seek to overturn the results and
seek a recount.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez Obrador accused Interior Minister Francisco Labastida
Ochoa, a member of the governing party, of rigging the election.
Opposition poll watchers in many precincts contended that stalwarts
from the governing party had handed out food and bags of cement in
exchange for votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The PRI once again trafficked on the poverty of the voters by
distributing presents in return for their votes,'' Lopez Obrador
said.
</P>
<P>
   In the early hours of the count, the opposition led by a
substantial margin. That vanished in the final hours of the tally.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the Party of the Democratic Revolution said 17,000
votes had been annulled statewide because of alleged
irregularities, enough to tip the count away from their party.
</P>
<P>
   For decades Guerrero was dominated by the Figueroa family, the
autocratic political dynasty. Ruben Figueroa Alcocer, who was
elected governor in 1993, was forced to resign in 1996 because of
suspicions that he masterminded a cover-up of the killing by state
police in 1995 of 22 farm workers who supported the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   President Ernesto Zedillo has sent confusing signals to his
party over his role in choosing candidates for the presidential
election next year.

FOR QUEEN NOOR, A DELICATE BALANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMMAN, Jordan _ Dressed in all black and a white veil as is the
custom of mourning in Islam, Queen Noor stood far off to the side
of the burial ceremony for her husband King Hussein Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Women are not permitted to attend funerals or burial services in
the Muslim religion, so she watched from a distance as her sons and
the rest of the men of the Hashemite clan lowered the casket and
said their final goodbyes.
</P>
<P>
   The American-born, Princeton-educated queen who has worked
tirelessly for women's rights was in that moment delicately
balancing her own grief, her strong Western views, and her respect
for Jordan's very traditional and religious society, say palace
sources and women who know her.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has handled this very difficult time with grace and poise.
I think the Jordanian people have grown closer to her through the
last few days. The mourning has brought them together,'' said a
female palace official close to the royal family.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing captured this new bond more than when the king lay dying
on Saturday and Noor ventured out into a chilly rain to greet the
throngs of Jordanians who had gathered at the hospital. She thanked
them for their concern. And she never left the king's side through
his final seven-month battle against cancer.
</P>
<P>
   But for most of her reign, Noor, a high-school cheerleader who
also protested the Vietnam War in the early 1970s, has had a
strained relationship with the traditional clans and Muslim
clerical order in Jordan. They see her as too American, too
outspoken, and too enthralled with her life among the glitteratti.
</P>
<P>
   There was even sniping against her in the late 1980s for
spending the kingdom's wealth on jewels and designer clothes on
shopping sprees in Europe and America. She has always denied the
allegations, and insists she is much more likely to shop out of
catalogues than fly off to Fifth Avenue boutiques.
</P>
<P>
   The 47-year-old mother of four, who was married to Hussein for
more than 20 years, faces an uncertain future in the palace,
although most royal watchers believe she will retain her title as
queen.
</P>
<P>
   Born Lisa Halaby to a Christian Arab-American family, she took
the name Noor al-Hussein -- ``the light of Hussein'' -- when she
converted to Islam and married the monarch on June 15, 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein's passion for flying brought the couple together. Noor,
an aspiring architect, was working on an airport project in Jordan.
The king was immediately smitten.
</P>
<P>
   Her beauty and charm and ease with the limelight make her the
babyboomer's answer to another American who married royalty, Grace
Kelly. Others thought the way she comforted a bereaved nation
Saturday, dressed modestly in a scarf, was an Arab version of the
widowed First Lady Jackie Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   The new King Abdullah, 37, is not her son. He is the king's
oldest son from his second marriage to Princess Muna, which ended
in divorce. Some Jordanians quietly grumbled that Noor was pushing
Hussein, in the final stages of his cancer, to name their
18-year-old son Hamzah as the heir to the throne. Abdullah Sunday
made Hamzah Crown Prince.
</P>
<P>
   Noor and Hussein had three other children: Hashim, 17; and
daughters, Iman, 15, and Raiyah, 12.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, on the steps of Raghdan Palace she stood surrounded by
all of the women of the Hashemite clan and watched the men make the
procession to the grave. Noor received condolences in a chamber of
the palace where she was gathered with her female relatives, the
wives of heads of state, and women dignitaries.
</P>
<P>
   They included First Lady Hillary Clinton, the widow of slain
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, and the wife of Palestinian
President Yasser Arafat. As is the tradition, the women sat in
chairs and drank bitter coffee.
</P>
<P>
   For a woman who has campaigned against land mines and supported
environmental protection and ecotourism, the strictures of Islam
might seem confining. But women who know her say that she has found
many ways in which Islam also empowers women and creates bonds
between them in a way that Western culture often does not.
</P>
<P>
   Salwa Al-Sukhon, 31, who works with a women's cooperative funded
by the Queen Noor Foundation, said that Noor often travels into the
remote Bedouin villages and poor Palestinian refugee camps to see
first-hand how she can help better their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has done so much to empower women,'' she said. ``I think
women are counting on her to continue her work.''

 By R.W. APPLE Jr. 
 
c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With the acquittal of President Clinton all but
assured, the chief prosecutor demanded Monday night that the Senate
``cleanse the office'' by convicting him rather than resorting to
``the Air-Wick of a censure resolution.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Hyde of Illinois, the last of 13 Republican
prosecutors or ``managers'' to speak, concluded their case by
accusing the defense of resorting to ``a theater of distraction and
misdirection.'' He said his side's ``most formidable opponent'' had
been cynicism _ ``the widespread conviction that all politics and
all politicians are by definition corrupt and venal.''
</P>
<P>
   In his closing statement, the main White House counsel, Charles
F.C. Ruff, urged the senators to focus not upon the minutiae of the
lawyers' arguments but upon ``voices of greater eloquence than any
of us can muster, the voices of Madison and Hamilton and the others
who met in Phildelphia 212 years ago, and the voices of the
generations since, and the voices of the American people now, and
the voices of generations to come.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruff concluded as he had begun on Jan. 19: ``William Jefferson
Clinton is not guilty of the charges that have been brought against
him. He did not commit perjury. He did not commit obstruction of
justice. He must not be removed from office.''
</P>
<P>
   Seemingly drained of emotion and resigned to defeat, Hyde ended
with the words, ``And now let us all take our place in history on
the side of honor, and, oh, yes, let right be done.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate will begin its deliberations on Tuesday, probably
behind closed doors. The votes on the two articles of impeachment,
charging Clinton with perjury and obstruction of justice in an
effort to conceal his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky, are
scheduled for Thursday or Friday. Consideration of a censure
resolution could follow.
</P>
<P>
   For all the historical rarity of Monday's session _ only once
before, in the case of Andrew Johnson in 1868, has a presidential
impeachment proceeding reached this stage _ there was little drama
in the chamber. Having gone over the same ground so often, most
recently on Saturday, the lawyers could offer little but reheated
evidentiary and rhetorical leftovers. And the outcome has been
taken for granted for several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Ruff and Hyde conceded that they, too, like the senators and the
nation at large, were weary of it all.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are taking the last steps along a path that for most of us
has seemed to be unending,'' Ruff commented, and more than three
and a half hours later, Hyde echoed, ``We are blessedly coming to
the end of this melancholy procedure.''
</P>
<P>
   The session was filled with allegations, exhortations and
complaints, lots of complaints, mainly from the prosecutors drawn
from Republican members of the House of Representatives but from
Ruff, too, about the trial procedures and about the nonstop
coverage provided by television.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Republicans, there was a certain fatalistic self-pity.
Hyde spoke bitterly of indignities he said he and his colleagues
had endured, enumerating ``the media condemnations, the patronizing
editorials, the hate mail, the insults hurled in public, the
attempts at intimidation, the death threats and even the
disapproval of our colleagues, which cuts the worst.''
</P>
<P>
   The Illinois legislator compared his team of managers to Henry
V's ``band of brothers'' at Agincourt, and he dipped deep into his
oratorical reservoir for quotations from Charles de Gaulle and
Terence Rattigan, Septimius Severus and Horace Mann, Edward Gibbon
and Saul Bellow.
</P>
<P>
   He compared the text of one of the proposed censure resolutions
with that of the impeachment articles and said, ``We aren't half as
tough on the president.'' But he continued to express strong
opposition to censure, which is favored by most Democrats and some
Republicans as a means short of conviction to put the Senate on
record as condemning Clinton's actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``A failure to convict will make the statement that lying under
oath, while unpleasant and to be avoided, is not all that
serious,'' Hyde declared. ``We have reduced lying under oath to a
breach of etiquette, but only if you are the president.''
</P>
<P>
   A recent poll, as several of the lawyers observed, showed that
more than half of Americans thought the president guilty but did
not wish him removed from office. The defense drew comfort from
this, and the prosecutors expressed frustration at it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I doubt there are many people on the planet who doubt the
president has repeatedly lied under oath and has obstructed
justice,'' Hyde said. ``The real issue doesn't concern the facts
but what to do about them.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Barr of Georgia, who was the first House member to
introduce an impeachment resolution (over the president's campaign
fund raising), lectured the senators about polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Polls played no part in the great and glorious decisions,
decisive decisions, that made America a nation and kept it free and
strong,'' Barr asserted. ``Will the principles embodied in our
Constitution and our laws be reaffirmed, wrested from the pallid
hands of pollsters and pundits and the swarm of theorists
surrounding these proceedings?''
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans devoted relatively little time on Monday to the
details of the case. Instead, they flung swords of words at the
president and his defenders. Rep. Bill McCollum said angrily,
``William Jefferson Clinton is not a king.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Floridian, Rep. Charles Canaday, warned senators they
were about to set ``a pathetic, low standard of integrity.'' Rep.
Lindsey Graham of South Carolina heaped scorn on the defense
contention that President Clinton had been ``truthful but
misleading.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How can you be both?'' he demanded, his voice dripping
contempt.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   One of the last Republicans to speak before Hyde was Rep. James
Rogan of California, a former Democrat whose district leans
Democratic. His leading role in the drive for conviction has
convinced some politicians his seat is in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   ``So be it,'' he said on Monday, in one of several attempts by
Republicans to demonstrate that principle, not politics, motivated
their behavior. ``That revelation produces for me no flinching. I
can live with the concept of not serving in Congress. I cannot live
with the idea of remaining in Congress at the expense of doing what
I believed to be right.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruff was the only speaker on the president's side, and he
stopped well short of his three-hour limit.
</P>
<P>
   But he went methodically through his arguments on the two
articles and on the larger point that he has consistently pressed:
even if the senators were to find Clinton had committed the offense
charged, this by itself would not justify their voting to convict
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is only one question before you, albeit a difficult one,
one that is a question of fact and law and constitutional theory,''
Ruff said. ``Would it put at risk the liberties of the people to
retain the president in office? Putting aside partisan animus, if
you can honestly say that it would not, that those liberties are
safe in his hands, then you must vote to acquit.''
</P>
<P>
   He was sarcastic in his treatment of the managers' case. ``Nice
try, no facts,'' he commented at one point. And at another, only
moments later, ``Somebody's been watching too many reruns of the
X-Files.''
</P>
<P>
   But at the end, after discussing Blackstone and Sidney
Blumenthal, perjury and obstruction, after pointing at charts with
a long wand and cuing up videotape clips, he entered a general
defense of Clinton's conduct of his office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Manager Hyde questioned whether this president can represent
the interests of our country in the world,'' he said. ``Go to
Ireland and ask that question. Go to Israel and Gaza and ask that
question. If you doubt whether he should here at home continue in
office, ask the parent whose child walks safer streets, or the men
and women who go off to work in the morning at good jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   And then he said this: ``We are together, I think, weavers of a
constitutional fabric in which all of us now are clothed and
generations will be clothed for millenia to come. We cannot leave
even the smallest flaw in that fabric, for if we do, one day
someone will come along and pull a thread, and the flaw will
grow.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the classic summation of a defender. Do no unnecessary
harm to a man and a system, Ruff was contending, if both of them
work.

OLYMPICS WATCHERS AWAIT ETHICS REPORT 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ The second wave of fallout from the Olympic
payoff controversy will hit the beleaguered Salt Lake Organizing
Committee Tuesday morning when its ethics panel releases a detailed
internal report.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's top two officers, Frank Joklik and Dave Johnson,
have already stepped down amid the most embarrassing scandal in
modern Olympic history. Others may follow if the panel finds that
they knew about nearly $1 million in inappropriate gifts and cash
provided to International Olympic Committee members before and
after the Utah capital landed the 2002 Winter Games in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the committee reportedly hopes to name a new chief
executive when its board meets Thursday. Though Mitt Romney, the
Belmont, Mass. venture capitalist and former US Senate candidate,
is the top contender, others are being considered. Madison Square
Garden chief Dave Checketts, the former Utah Jazz president who was
approached for the SLOC job two years ago, spoke with Utah Gov.
Mike Leavitt last week.
</P>
<P>
   Though a source close to Romney said Monday that Romney had not
yet been offered the job, his name is expected to be proposed to
the SLOC board Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   If Romney takes the position, he will be working with an larger
board (from 33 to 50) that will have been reduced to advisory
status and an expanded executive committee (from 12 to 20) that
will focus on tighter management. Both of those reforms were urged
last week by Leavitt and SLOC board chairman Robert Garff, who
believed that the board needed to be more diverse and the executive
committee more hands-on.
</P>
<P>
   Leavitt and Mayor Deedee Corradini are expected to name 17 new
board members Tuesday. On Thursday, the board will add eight new
committee members, some of whom may be state legislators.
</P>
<P>
   Though a new Deseret News poll found that 60 percent of Utahans
still want Salt Lake City to host the Games, fewer than a quarter
want any more public money used. The state is already contributing
nearly $60 million of SLOC's $1.45 billion budget.
</P>
<P>
   Though the ethics panel report has been anxiously awaited here,
it is only one of five inquiries into the payoffs. The IOC
investigation, completed last month, resulted in the resignation or
expulsion of nine members. The US Olympic Committee will complete
its own probe by the end of the month, and investigations by the US
Department of Justice and the state attorney general are ongoing.
</P>
<P>
   Though former chief executive Tom Welch has charged that
Leavitt, Corradini, and other bid committee members were aware off
the payoffs, sources said that the ethics panel (which does not
have subpoena power) will report that a small number of SLOC
members were involved.

their neighbors and the economy than anything the computers do.
Some of the concerns are almost humorous. But planning experts are
taking seriously a wide range of Year 2000 disaster scenarios

SBC SET TO BECOME FIRST BELL TO INVEST IN A LONG-DISTANCE CARRIER
</HEADLINE>
  (nk)  
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Trying to become a national communications provider, SBC
Communications Inc. on Monday said it would buy up to 10 percent of
the Williams Companies Inc.'s communications unit, which is
building a coast-to-coast fiber-optic network.
</P>
<P>
   The deal between SBC, the No. 2 local phone company, and
Williams could be worth as much as $500 million and would be the
first significant investment in a long-distance carrier by one of
the Bell local phone giants. While none of the Bells _ Ameritech,
Bell Atlantic, BellSouth, SBC and US West _ are allowed to sell
long-distance service in their core markets, the Telecommunications
Act of 1996 allows them to own up to 10 percent of a long-distance
operator.
</P>
<P>
   But SBC would get more out of the deal than an investment.
Williams has agreed to meet all of SBC's long-distance needs once
SBC is allowed into the long-distance market, and at favorable
prices. Williams' roughly 1,000 salespeople would sell
long-distance service under the SBC brand.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, none of the Bells have had the gumption, or perhaps
the motivation, to invest in a long-distance carrier, a move that
could be described in regulatory terms as aggressive, if not
provocative. This is, however, SBC, which since the 1996 act's
passage has consistently been the most aggressive, if not
provocative, member of the Bell family. And quite often, SBC's
cheek has paid off.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, SBC, known to many consumers as Southwestern Bell,
became the first Bell to acquire another Bell (Pacific Telesis
Group, known to many customers as Pacific Bell). The same year, SBC
tried to negotiate a merger with the AT&AMP;T Corp. before that concept
was shot down by regulators. After SBC's first long-distance
petition was rejected, the company sued to invalidate the act's
cornerstone provision and won, though that judgment was later
reversed. And last October, SBC became the first Baby Bell to
acquire a big independent phone company (the Southern New England
Telecommunications Corporation, which serves most of Connecticut).
</P>
<P>
   ``We've said all along that we want to be a global
telecommunications player and we're a regional player now,'' Edward
E. Whitacre Jr., SBC's chairman, said in an interview. Referring to
SBC's pending acquisition of the Ameritech Corp., he added: ``Along
with the acquisition of Ameritech, the alliance with Williams gives
us the line to connect all these dots.''
</P>
<P>
   But for now SBC cannot fully exploit Williams' long-distance
lines, because SBC is not allowed to sell long-distance service to
its core local phone customers. Each of the Bells, however, may
sell long-distance calls in connection with its wireless telephone
business. The Bells are allowed to sell long-distance calls with
their wireless offerings because they have not historically held a
monopoly in the wireless business.
</P>
<P>
   Until this year, SBC had a wholesale long-distance deal with the
Sprint Corp. That deal contained a provision that allowed SBC to
terminate the agreement if SBC had not won entry to the
long-distance market by the beginning of 1999, executives close to
the agreement said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   By investing in Williams, which plans an initial public offering
of shares in its communications unit in the second quarter, SBC can
exert more control over the product development plans of its
long-distance supplier than it could over Sprint.
</P>
<P>
   The other Bells, however, remain linked to long-distance giants.
Once Bell Atlantic enters the long-distance market, it has agreed
to primarily use Sprint. BellSouth has a deal with AT&AMP;T. Ameritech
has pacts with both AT&AMP;T and MCI Worldcom Inc. and U S West is set
to use AT&AMP;T (though U S West now uses the Frontier Corp. to carry
most of its wireless traffic).
</P>
<P>
   Once SBC wins long-distance approval from the Federal
Communications Commission in one state, SBC will take a seat on the
board of Williams' communications unit. SBC would also then almost
surely become Williams' biggest customer.
</P>
<P>
   The deal between SBC and Williams allows SBC to terminate the
agreement and move its traffic to another carrier if Williams is
taken over by another company. SBC executives said they had other
rights that would help prevent Williams from falling into the hands
of a competitor, but they refused to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's part of a number of conditions that we're not going to
wake up to see that Williams has been acquired by Worldcom or
AT&AMP;T,'' said James S. Kahan, SBC's senior vice president for
corporate development.
</P>
<P>
   As the stock in the communications unit is initially offered to
the public, SBC will receive 10 percent or $500 million worth of
the operation, whichever is worth less. If SBC's stake is less than
10 percent, it will not be able to increase its investment until a
later public stock offering.
</P>
<P>
   SBC said Monday that the deal would not require regulatory
approval. Some federal and state regulators agreed, citing SBC's
apparent compliance with the 10 percent limit. They added, however
that the deal could raise concerns if it already included
arrangements for SBC to increase its stake after it wins
long-distance approval across its region.
</P>
<P>
   Even though SBC would be allowed to increase its stake after
winning long-distance permission, the regulators said that if such
an arrangement existed now, it could push SBC over the 10 percent
limit.
</P>
<P>
   Whitacre said that under the deal SBC would not hold options for
additional Williams stock. But referring to the possibility of
SBC's increasing its investment in Williams, he added: ``We have a
path where that probably could be done.''
</P>
<P>
   He refused to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   SBC's shares rose 43.75 cents, to $51.375, Monday while shares
of Williams rose $1.6875, to $36.625. Shares of IXC Communications
Inc., another new long-distance company, which seems ripe for a
deal similar to that of Williams, rose 75 cents, to $46.25.

 Company Giving Out Free PCs  &HT;       
 By David Einstein 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
A Southern California company said yesterday it will give free
Compaq personal computers and Internet access to users who accept
continuous targeted advertising on their screens.
</P>
<P>
   The offer, by Free-PC Inc., marks the first attempt to subsidize
computers in return for revenues generated from advertising. As
prices for PCs continue to tumble, cable and telephone companies
are expected to start giving away computers or charging almost
nothing for them in order to get users to pay for high-speed
Internet and other services.
</P>
<P>
   Free-PC, which is operated by closely held IdeaLab of Pasadena,
said it will ship its first 10,000 computers this spring. It began
taking online applications for the PCs yesterday, and by
midmorning, its Web site  &LR; (www.free-pc.com) &LR;  was swamped and could
not be accessed.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers applying for a free PC are asked to fill out a
detailed questionnaire providing the company with demographic
information such as age, income and family status, personal tastes
and interests.
</P>
<P>
   The information will be used to determine which consumers will
get free PCs. The company said it wants consumers who will appeal
to advertisers, but eventually, it hopes to give a PC to anyone who
wants one.
</P>
<P>
   People who receive the free PCs _ Compaq Presarios with 15-inch
monitors _ will be required to go online at least 10 hours a month.
They also must sign a contract agreeing to have the Free-PC
advertising on their screens for three years. After that, they'll
be able to keep the PC free and clear.
</P>
<P>
   Free-PC's targeted ads will appear in a frame surrounding the
work area of Windows. Ads will be shipped on the hard drive of each
computer, so they can be displayed continuously, even when the user
is offline. When the user goes online, ads will be automatically
updated.
</P>
<P>
   Don LaVigne, chief executive of Free-PC, said the new concept
would benefit both consumers and advertisers. ``By providing us
with information about themselves, consumers will not only get a
free computer, it will also allow us to customize their experience
by delivering the most relevant content and advertising directly to
their desktop,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He also said the concept ``represents the first real opportunity
for advertisers to reach a mass audience via the computer.'' The
company said advertisers may include Disney, ESPN and Autobytel, an
Internet car-buying service.
</P>
<P>
   Users will get free dial-up Internet access from NetZero, a
Thousand Oaks (Los Angeles County) Internet service provider in
which IdeaLab is an investor.
</P>
<P>
   Free-PC said safeguards will be built into the computers to
prevent users from erasing the programming that displays the free
ads. In addition, the company will be able to monitor online
connections to make sure users are getting the ads.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't expect a lot of fraud, and we're going to do our best
to avoid it,'' LaVigne said.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts expressed cautious optimism about Free-PC's plans.
``It's an interesting experiment, one that represents an
interesting new channel of distribution,'' said Scott Miller of
Dataquest. ``But it's not clear to me that advertising alone can
support this kind of model.''
</P>
<P>
   Another thing that's unclear is how giant Microsoft will react
to Free-PC's idea. Historically, the software giant has fought
companies that usurp the real estate of the Windows desktop.

MARKETPLACE: NEW RULES ARE PROPOSED FOR BETTER ACCOUNTING
OVERSIGHT
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By MELODY PETERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Reacting to a string of high-profile cases of accounting fraud
and other abuses of financial reporting rules, a panel created by
the leading stock exchanges and markets recommended a series of
rules Monday that would strengthen the role of audit committees at
public companies.
</P>
<P>
   Directors sitting on audit committees are expected to provide an
independent check of companies' financial controls. But recent
cases, in which companies like Cendant Corp. and Livent Inc. have
announced that past financial statements included major errors,
left many investors wondering why audit committee members had not
discovered the problems earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The panel's recommendations include prohibiting audit committee
members from having ties to the company or its executives that
might harm the members' ability to make independent decisions or to
question management's actions. For example, an audit committee
member could not be an immediate relative of the company's top
executives. The member also could not receive any compensation from
the company other than for work done as a director.
</P>
<P>
   Another recommendation would require audit committee members to
have enough knowledge of finance and accounting to be able to read
and understand the company's financial statements.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the New York Stock Exchange and at the National
Association of Securities Dealers, which oversees the Nasdaq stock
market and the American Stock Exchange, said Monday that they would
review the proposals and determine whether public companies should
be forced to follow the rules. Federal regulators may also change
regulations to enforce the proposals. Most of the new rules would
apply only to public companies with a market value of more than
$200 million.
</P>
<P>
   In the next few months, public companies will be allowed to
comment on the proposals.
</P>
<P>
   But Arthur Levitt, chairman of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, called on public companies to adopt the proposals now.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a time for bold action,'' Levitt said at a news
conference in Manhattan on Monday. ``Qualified, committed,
independent and tough-minded audit committees represent the most
reliable guardians of the public interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, Levitt had sought the creation of the panel. He said
he was concerned about the growing number of companies announcing
accounting problems. One of the most controversial recommendations
may be a proposal that the company's outside auditors discuss with
the audit committee whether the auditors believe that the company
is bending accounting rules too far.
</P>
<P>
   Federal regulators have said recently that they are worried many
companies use aggressive accounting techniques to help them meet
the earnings levels expected by analysts. The aggressive accounting
may be within the letter of the rules, the regulators have said,
but it results in companies improperly reporting their financial
results.
</P>
<P>
   Under the panel's proposal, the auditors and the audit committee
would be required to discuss just how aggressive or conservative
the company's accounting is.
</P>
<P>
   The panel also proposed that the audit committee include at
least three members. The committee would also be required to write
an annual letter to shareholders discussing whether or not it was
comfortable with the company's accounting.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   While both the New York Stock Exchange and NASD require
companies to have independent audit committees, the current rules
are weak.
</P>
<P>
   And, in the last year, some companies that announced accounting
problems had audit committee members with possible conflicts of
interest.
</P>
<P>
   For example, questions were raised about financial ties between
Walter A. Forbes, the former chairman of Cendant, and at least one
member of the company's audit committee. Cendant said last year
that it had discovered accounting irregularities that included more
than $500 million of fictitious pretax income.
</P>
<P>
   And, at the Boston Scientific Corp., a member of the audit
committee, N.J. Nicholas Jr., is the brother of Pete M. Nicholas,
the company's chairman and chief executive. In November, the
company said that its Japanese unit had improperly inflated revenue
by tens of millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The panel that announced the recommendations Monday included
regulators, corporate executives, accountants, lawyers and other
experts on corporate governance. Members included Ira M. Millstein,
a partner at the New York law firm of Weil, Gotshal &AMP; Manges; John
C. Whitehead, a former deputy secretary of state and retired
partner at Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co.; and Charles A. Bowsher, a former
U.S. comptroller general.

nothing but zero-coupon Treasury bonds this year.
</P>
<P>
   Although novice investors &LR;   &LR; may believe that the stock market
can only go up, O'Higgins points out that there have been many
years when the combined price appreciation and interest from
Treasury bills or bonds has exceeded the investment gains from
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   He expects that to happen this year.
</P>
<P>
   He believes that stocks, which have vaulted a phenomenal 150
percent during the past four years, as measured by the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index, are on the brink of a terrible crash that will
eradicate at least 50 percent of their current market values.
</P>
<P>
   At present, the S&AMP;P 500 is selling at more than 30 times
earnings for the latest 12 months and nearly seven times book
value. Those valuations, O'Higgins notes, are more than twice the
historical norms.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, he says, stocks will ``regress to the mean.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Higgins has outlined his latest investment method in the new
book ``Beating the Dow with Bonds'' (HarperCollins, New York, $24).
The title harks back to his ``Beating the Dow'' (1991), in which he
spelled out his Dogs of the Dow theory.
</P>
<P>
   With the new strategy, investors must decide once a year whether
stocks, zero-coupon Treasury bonds or one-year Treasury bills offer
the best value. They then invest 100 percent of their assets in
whichever of those investments looks best and hold on for the next
12 months.
</P>
<P>
   O'Higgins says that zero-coupon Treasury bonds look like the
best investment now, even though they are yielding only a bit more
than 5 percent annually _ near their historic lows.
</P>
<P>
   He expects deflationary pressures to drive interest rates
significantly lower, causing long-term bond prices to rise sharply.
(Bond prices move in the opposite direction from interest rates.)
</P>
<P>
   Zero-coupon bonds do not pay interest as other bonds do. They
are priced at a large discount to their face value, and investors
earn a profit by redeeming them at full face value when they
mature.
</P>
<P>
   The prices of zeros tend to fluctuate broadly, rising sharply
when interest rates decline _ and vice versa. They can be bought
through brokers, but not through the federal government. Zeroes are
more volatile and hence riskier than regular Treasuries.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the validity of his new theory, O'Higgins is correct in
predicting that it will be greeted with skepticism.
</P>
<P>
   It would be ``a fairly risky bet'' to shift all your money out
of the stock market, warns money manager Craig Litman, with
Litman/Gregory in Larkspur. ``His basic premise boils down to
market timing, which does not make sense for the typical
investor.''
</P>
<P>
   Litman acknowledges that stocks are risky now. But he notes that
the market has gone up year after year while market timers
continually predicted impending doom. ``The typical investor would
be better served by deciding on a mix of assets, not by trying to
guess market movements,'' he observes.
</P>
<P>
   O'Higgins claims that his new strategy would have returned 23.8
percent annually from the start of 1972 through last September _
significantly better than his Dogs of the Dow theory, which would
have returned 18.0 percent. The overall Dow gained 11.7 percent per
year during the same period.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its long-term success, the Dogs strategy has been a dog
recently, failing to beat the overall Dow the past four years in a
row.
</P>
<P>
   ``The strategy has become so popular that it no longer works as
a contrarian strategy,'' O'Higgins explained in an interview. He
estimates that investors worldwide have sunk $20 billion into the
Dow dogs.
</P>
<P>
   With the Dogs strategy, you compare the dividend yields and
market prices of all 30 Dow industrial stocks once a year. You then
buy the five lowest-price stocks among the 10 with the highest
yields.
</P>
<P>
   Using the new O'Higgins strategy, investors wouldn't have even
bothered to buy stocks in 23 of the past 30 years. They would have
held them only from the start of 1974 to the end of 1980.
</P>
<P>
   The new strategy is more complicated than the old, but it is
still simple _ or perhaps the word is simplistic _ requiring less
than an hour of research per year.
</P>
<P>
   First, you determine whether to put your money into stocks or
Treasuries. If the choice is Treasuries, you then must decide
whether to choose 30-year zero-coupon bonds or one-year bills.
</P>
<P>
   O'Higgins provides worksheets in his book that let you make
these decisions automatically, using data from the Market Week
section of Barron's, the weekly investment newspaper. The data also
is available on the Web site of O'Higgins' firm, O'Higgins Asset
Management, at  &LR; www.ohiggins.com &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   The worksheets, which occupy only two pages out of 267, are the
essential part of the book. Much of the rest is devoted to the
logic behind the new strategy, and there also is a lot of padding _
for example, more than 60 pages devoted to profiles and price
charts of all 30 Dow stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The first step is to find what O'Higgins calls the ``earnings
yield'' of the 380-stock Standard &AMP; Poor's industrial index. This
is calculated by dividing 1 by the index's price-earnings ratio for
the latest 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   Next, you find the yield to maturity of the most recently issued
T-bond expiring 10 years from now. You then add 0.3 to that figure
and compare the total with the S&AMP;P earnings yield.
</P>
<P>
   If the earnings yield is higher, stocks are relatively
undervalued, O'Higgins figures. He suggests that you load up on
stocks, using the Dogs of the Dow method.
</P>
<P>
   If the bond yield is higher _ as it is currently, by a
substantial two-plus percentage points _ you would buy Treasuries.
</P>
<P>
   To determine which type of Treasury, you compare the price of
gold a year ago with the current price.
</P>
<P>
   ``The change in the price of gold has been a wonderful predictor
of interest rates in the following year'' O'Higgins explains. ``It
has predicted the course of interest rates in 28 of the past 29
years.''
</P>
<P>
   If the price of gold is higher than it was a year ago, that
could signify an inflationary trend that could drive interest rates
higher, O'Higgins says.
</P>
<P>
   In that case, he urges investors to put their money in one-year
T-bills, so they can take advantage of possibly higher yields when
the T-bills expire.
</P>
<P>
   If the price of gold is lower than it was a year ago _ as is now
the case _ there is supposedly no need to fear inflation, so you
would buy the 30-year zero-coupon Treasuries.
</P>
<P>
   O'Higgins has created a new no-load mutual fund, the O'Higgins
Fund, which follows his new strategy and is fully invested in
zero-coupon Treasuries. It has attracted $3 million in assets so
far.

 Internet2 Ready to Enter Cyberspace  &HT;       
 By Jon Swartz 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Backers of Internet2 _ a faster, more powerful sequel to the
Internet _ are launching the online system nationwide this month.
</P>
<P>
   A coalition of universities and high-tech companies yesterday
announced that a key technological piece of the private research
network _ dubbed the Abilene project _ will connect 70 college
campuses, including Stanford University, the University of
California at Berkeley and Harvard University, as well as major
corporate sponsors Cisco Systems, Qwest Communications and Nortel.
</P>
<P>
   When operational on February 24, the 13,000-mile, 2.4
gigabits-per-second network will be 100 to 1,000 times faster than
the commercial Web. &UR;  &LR; But it will be available to far fewer people:
Only researchers and employees at the colleges and corporate
sponsors can use it and it will not be offered to consumers. Some
140 universities that have financially contributed to Internet2
should have access to the new network by 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers will eventually be able to use cutting-edge
applications developed on Internet2, but only after they have been
developed and sold by Internet2 members for commercial purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday's rollout was ``like driving in the final golden spike
on the transcontinental railroad,'' said Stephen Wolff, executive
director of advanced Internet initiatives at Cisco Systems in San
Jose. ``After pieces of the network have run for a few months, the
full-fledged national network is operational.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Cisco, in fact, is providing a ``golden router'' as the final
technology piece to tie together the network, according to
Internet2 organizers.
</P>
<P>
   Regional segments of Internet2, including California, have been
in use since last year. The high-speed fiber-optic network, which
serves as a virtual university for students and professors, can
transmit a 30-volume encyclopedia in less than two seconds.
</P>
<P>
   The Abilene project, based in Washington, D.C., would link
together the disparate geographical segments. It will enable
educators and government officials across the country to perform
ultra-fast online research and develop real-time visual and sound
applications that are not possible over the Internet today.
</P>
<P>
   ``This Internet is not restricted by bandwidth,'' said Internet2
spokesman Greg Wood, who predicts the new Net will be a breeding
ground for 21st century applications for the research, education
and consumer markets.
</P>
<P>
   Engineers in different states could design products together in
3-D environments. Hospitals would be able to collaborate on
diagnosing diseases by using computer-generated images broadcast
over the Net. And college professors and students could mine vast
databases of information from ``digital libraries'' at more than
100 universities nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of INTERNET () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR;  &LR; Internet2 and a similar project, the government-backed Next
Generation Internet, are modeled after the original Internet _
except they'll use fiber-optic circuits instead of standard
telephone lines and more sophisticated software. Both projects plan
only limited links to the Internet.

 What AOL's Split Means For Merger  &HT;       
 By Arthur M. Louis  
 c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; Question: &LR;  I am a Netscape Communications shareholder. As you
probably know, the company is being acquired in an exchange of
stock by America Online. The terms announced in November call for
0.45 shares of America Online to be exchanged for each share of
Netscape, with the deal to be completed this spring. However, I
noticed that AOL has since announced that it is splitting its stock
2-for-1 during February. Does that mean the stock I get will be
worth only half as much when the merger takes place?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Answer: &LR;  No way! That would be pretty outrageous, and
Netscape's board of directors certainly wouldn't stand for it.
</P>
<P>
   The exchange ratio will be adjusted to take the AOL stock split
into account. After the split, you will be entitled to 0.9 of the
new AOL shares for each share of Netscape you hold.
</P>
<P>
   Based on AOL's presplit closing price of $159 yesterday, you
would get $71.55 worth of AOL stock per Netscape share. That is
nearly 80 percent more than the $40 per share the deal was worth
when it was announced less than three months ago. So far, you are a
very fortunate shareholder.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, you can't rule out the possibility that AOL will
split its stock again before the merger date. It splits about as
often as rabbits have babies. The coming 2-for-1 split will be
AOL's third in less than a year.
</P>
<P>
   Trading Process
</P>
<P>
   Q: You've discussed online and other discount brokers several
times in your column. I know that some discount brokers offer
``no-frills'' trades _ that is, less or no telephone contact,
little or no investment advice, etc. But what about the trading
process? Do full-service brokerage houses have the ability to
execute trades more quickly? Or is it pretty much even among
brokers? Also, are there any qualitative differences in terms of
how the trade is accomplished?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  A: I hesitate to reply to your question just now, because
online brokers are having a lot of technical problems these days,
thanks largely to the tremendous surge in Internet trading.
Investors are sometimes being forced to wait many minutes to gain
access to broker Web sites. Once they gain access, they may
experience delays in getting to the trading page. Sometimes they
get signed off inadvertently instead. When they finally do enter a
trade, there may be still more delays before it goes through.
</P>
<P>
   These problems may or may not be temporary. If they persist,
then online investors who require rapid execution may want to
consider using a full-service broker like Merrill Lynch, or perhaps
an online broker that handles transactions by telephone, such as
Charles Schwab or Fidelity Investments.
</P>
<P>
   When everyone's technology is working just fine, market experts
say there is no significant advantage in speed and quality of
executions from one broker to another. Some brokers that charge
relatively high commissions like to hint vaguely about their
execution advantage. But when pressed to prove it, they back down.

   Mixed Roth IRAs
</P>
<P>
   Q: Early in 1998, I converted my traditional Individual
Retirement Account to a Roth IRA. Later that year, I made a $2,000
annual contribution to the new Roth account. The broker that
administers the account said this was OK, but I've done some
reading on the subject and I'm not so sure. The rules are
confusing, but I get the impression that I should have opened a
separate account for the $2,000 contribution. Please tell me
whether what I did was legal, and if not, how I can rectify the
situation.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  A: Relax. What you did was legal, but it's easy to
understand why you are perplexed. Initially, many financial
institutions _ although not your broker _ required customers to
open separate and distinct Roth accounts for conversions and
contributions.
</P>
<P>
   The Roth program took effect at the beginning of 1998, but the
Internal Revenue Service never issued guidelines spelling out how
withdrawals from mixed Roth accounts should be taxed. The financial
institutions that administered Roths feared that mixed accounts
would produce an accounting nightmare, sowing hopeless confusion
among their customers at tax time.
</P>
<P>
   But last summer, Congress passed a law containing a clear set of
guidelines, and now the financial institutions know exactly what to
tell their Roth account-holders in their year-end statements.
</P>
<P>
   Congress established a pecking order for withdrawals from a
mixed Roth account. The first money you withdraw consists of your
contributions to the account, which can amount to no more than
$2,000 per year. Next in line is the money you converted from your
traditional IRA. After that, all that's left is your earnings from
the account.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinarily, withdrawals from Roth accounts are tax-free.
However, they are subject to tax if you withdraw investment gains
within five years after opening the account or before you reach age
591/2.

EXPERTS FIND NO ARMS CHEMICALS AT BOMBED SUDAN PLANT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.)  (mk) 
 By JAMES RISEN and DAVID JOHNSTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Chemists who examined soil, sludge and debris
samples from a Sudanese pharmaceutical plant destroyed in August by
American cruise missiles found no traces of chemical weapon
compounds, according to a scientist hired by the owner of the
plant.
</P>
<P>
   The findings, though prepared privately for lawyers for the
owner, who is now seeking redress from the United States, raise new
questions about the government's reliance on tests of soil samples
from the site obtained clandestinely by the CIA. American officials
had said the samples contained traces of Empta, a precursor used in
the production of deadly VX nerve gas.
</P>
<P>
   The United States attacked the Al Shifa pharmaceutical plant in
Khartoum and suspected terrorist training camps near Khost,
Afghanistan, on Aug. 20 in an effort to curb the activities of the
Saudi exile Osama bin Laden after the bombings of two American
embassies in East Africa. American officials have said the bin
Laden terrorist network was behind the bombings of the diplomatic
missions in Kenya and Tanzania. Bin Laden has denied any role in
the bombings.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the new evidence are 13 carefully cataloged
samples taken from the wrecked plant and its grounds late in
October. The sampling project was designed and supervised by Thomas
Tullius, chairman of the chemistry department at Boston University.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point of what we did was to carefully and scientifically
collect samples from a variety of locations and have them analyzed
by one of the top laboratories in the world for this kind of
work,'' Tullius said in an interview. ``What they found was that in
those samples, to the practical limits of scientific detection,
there was no Empta or Empa, its breakdown product.''
</P>
<P>
   In response to the new findings, Clinton administration
officials said they stood by their decision to strike the plant.
The officials dismissed the findings of chemists working on behalf
of the plant's owner, Salih Idris, noting that their soil samples
were taken long after the United States obtained its soil from the
site and long after the bombing and rains could have dispersed
incriminating evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, while they acknowledged that they did not know that
Idris owned the plant at the time of the attack, other American
officials say they now have strong evidence linking him to bin
Laden.
</P>
<P>
   ``We stand by our evidence indicating the presence of a chemical
weapons precursor at this plant,'' said P.J. Crowley, a spokesman
for the National Security Council at the White House. ``We stand by
our evidence linking this plant to Osama bin Laden's network. We
continue to believe that this was an appropriate action to pre-empt
Osama bin Laden from further attacks against the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Several ground locations at the plant were surveyed, along with
interior sites in the plant that were covered by debris and partly
protected from rain. One location, a septic tank, was found intact
and provided what Tullius said was a historical record of the
chemicals flushed through the plant drains.
</P>
<P>
   The lab analysis found that none of the samples contained
detectable levels of Empta, nor did they find Empa, the subsidiary
compound into which Empta rapidly breaks down. Empta, Tullius said,
breaks down within days, but Empa remains in the soil, and even in
small quantities would be detectable for weeks or months after
contact with the ground.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the evaluation of the new soil samples, an
international security company, Kroll Associates, was hired by
Idris' lawyers to conduct a detailed review of the Shifa
controversy. In their report, made available to The New York Times,
Kroll Associates found no evidence of a direct link between Idris
and bin Laden.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The scientists and investigators were hired by the law firm of
Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer &AMP; Feld, which represents Idris, a
Sudanese-born Saudi businessman. The law firm has a long-held
reputation of influence in Democratic circles with partners like
Robert Strauss, the former Democratic Party chairman, and Vernon
Jordan, a close friend of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But its credentials have not benefited Idris. The firm's lawyers
have been flatly rebuffed in their efforts to present their
findings to the White House, National Security Council or the
Justice, Treasury and Defense Departments.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been confronted with the problem of proving a series of
negatives that there was no Empta at the plant and that Idris was
not a terrorist,'' said Mark MacDougall, a partner at the law firm.
``We think we've done that with evidence that can be admitted in
court. But to date responsible officials, including at the White
House, have flatly refused to look at the facts. We're sorry about
that.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers have not yet decided whether they will sue the
government, in what would probably be complex litigation with an
uncertain outcome. Nevertheless, MacDougall said Idris wanted to
clear his name and unfreeze millions of dollars in bank accounts at
the Bank of America that the Treasury Department's office of
foreign-assets control blocked after the Shifa attack. In addition,
Idris is seeking millions of dollars to replace the plant.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews with Western consultants to the factory, employees
and others, the Kroll investigators said they had found no evidence
that the plant had been heavily guarded or that there had been
secret areas in the factory off-limits to outsiders, where chemical
weapons might have been produced or stored. The report concluded
that the plant produced only veterinary medicines and
pharmaceuticals for human consumption. While Al Shifa did export to
Iraq, Kroll found no evidence of a chemical weapons link to
Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   But the Kroll investigation did provide new details about Idris
and confirmed his commercial links to Sudan's Military Industrial
Corp., the government entity that produces weapons for the Sudanese
army. The United States charged that the industrial corporation was
also responsible for chemical weapons production in the country,
and that bin Laden had provided financing for the agency.
</P>
<P>
   The Kroll report determined that Idris had links to the military
corporation through his other business interests in Sudan, but not
through Al Shifa. Kroll investigators said the industrial
corporation was a powerful military-based organization that reaches
into many parts of the Sudanese economy, including Idris' business
empire.

ELIZABETH DOLE DESCRIBES HERSELF AS FIRM BUT GOOD-HEARTED
CONSERVATIVE  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD L. BERKE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ In her first speech as a possible contender
for the Republican presidential nomination, Elizabeth Dole on
Monday night recalled her three decades of public service as proof
that she is a good-hearted but firm conservative who could restore
integrity to American government.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a little speculation that I might run for
president,'' Mrs. Dole said to an overflow crowd of 1,200 at a
dinner here of the Greater Manchester Chamber of Commerce. ``And if
I run, this will be an important reason why: Because the United
States of America deserves a government worthy of her people.''
</P>
<P>
   Addressing critics who contend that she has never had to stake
out stands on issues, Mrs. Dole said improving public education was
her top priority and cast herself as Reagan-style Republican who
favored lower taxes, returning control to local government and
strengthening the military.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reagan conservatism wore a smile and it was contagious,'' said
Mrs. Dole, who resigned as president of the American Red Cross last
month to explore running for president. ``It imagined the good in
everyone, and brought out the best in millions. It was optimistic,
futuristic, and inclusive. If we remember Reagan, we will find our
course again.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounding the mainstream Republican principles that she said
would sum up her goals in the White House, Mrs. Dole declared,
``Whoever the next president may be, he _ or she _ that individual
should see to it that your taxes are cut, our defense is rebuilt,
drugs are reviled and our schools are put back in the control of
parents.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because Mrs. Dole is no Washington outsider, her message
was leavened with some sympathy for the federal role. ``The answer
is not reflexive hostility to government at all levels,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In a play for both moderates and conservatives, Mrs. Dole shied
away from specifics and avoided controversial issues like abortion,
which her advisers said she was decidedly opposes, and did nothing
to needle her potential rivals. Her advisers explained that what
set her apart in the speech, and what would be a centerpiece of a
presidential campaign, was that she did not agree with those who
assert that the nation suffers from moral decay. Instead, they said
she would focus on moral leadership. ``At a time when the
presidency has been tarnished, when words have been devalued and
institutions have squandered respect, our confidence in leaders is
shaken. But we can rebuild it,'' Mrs. Dole said to an spirited
crowd in the state that traditionally holds the first presidential
primary.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Dole has begun assembling a campaign organization and her
advisers said that in a matter of weeks she would probably announce
formation of an exploratory committee as the first step toward
running for president. ``It's very encouraging,'' she told
reporters of the response here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is go in terms of all the signals,'' said one of
Mrs. Dole's closest advisers, Mari Maseng Will, who helped write
tonight's speech.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Dole's first solo foray into presidential politics _ she
was last on the stump when she campaigned for her husband, Bob
Dole, the Republican nominee in 1996 _ created something of a
political sensation. She drew a clutch of reporters so large that
it was reminiscent of the height of primary season. Chamber of
Commerce officials said that for the first time they had to turn
away more than 100 people. And polls in this state show Mrs. Dole
is even with or a close second to another well-known figure who has
not yet campaigned here, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Steve Duprey, the state Republican chairman, warned that
the enthusiasm could diminish if Mrs. Dole becomes an actual
candidate. ``I don't think any activists in New Hampshire knows
where Mrs. Dole stands on issues yet,'' he said after the dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond being the only woman in the field and having served as
secretary of labor and secretary of transportation, Mrs. Dole's
advisers said her appeal was that she comes off as less threatening
than other contenders.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to underscore that Monday night, Mrs. Dole said, ``If
there is an overriding theme to my thirty-plus years in public life
_ and I think there is _ it lies in placing service over politics,
to try consensus before confrontation and to count on the deep
desire of my fellow countrymen to do what is right. In what is
sometimes a cacophony of conflicting voices, I have tried to raise
mine in a call to our better nature, always sure that American
would respond.''
</P>
<P>
   In an appeal to Republicans of every stripe, she added, ``Most
Americans prefer solutions to sound bites. This makes us naturally
suspicious of what I call either/or politics. Liberal vs.
conservative. Public school vs. private school. Us vs. them. As far
as I'm concerned, America needs leaders, not labels.''
</P>
<P>
   Even some of Mrs. Dole's supporters, citing her well-known
tendency to constantly rehearse and try to control situations, said
they fear she may lack the spontaneity needed to successfully seek
the presidency. On Monday, it was clear she had not shed those
traits. Chamber of Commerce officials said they had never seen a
politician come in and set strict ground rules that limit access
reporters could have to participants at the dinner. ``It was her
request not to be exposed to the media,'' said Bill Hamilton, a
vice president of the Chamber of Commerce.

 NEWS ANALYSIS: PERJURY CHARGE IS WEAKEST ELEMENT IN CASE AGAINST
CLINTON  (See related stories: IMPEACH-TRIAL, IMPEACH-DEBATE,(sw) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With a final plea that ``obstruction of justice and
perjury must not be allowed to stand,'' House prosecutors on Monday
brought their case against President Clinton to a close. But the
senators sitting in judgment were not treating the two charges
equally. Contrary to what was expected just two months ago, the
article on perjury now looks like it may not even draw a majority.
</P>
<P>
   The distinction senators are making between the two articles of
impeachment against Clinton will not affect the fate of the
president. With the Senate's 45 Democrats almost solidly against
Clinton's conviction, neither article is expected to draw the 67
votes required to remove the president from office.
</P>
<P>
   But the shift in sentiment over the two months since the House
gave the perjury charge the most votes when it voted to impeach
Clinton illuminates a number of points about this monthlong trial
of the president. It touches on senators' views of what kinds of
actions warrant removal of a popular president, and reflects the
battles the House prosecutors chose to fight and those they did
not.
</P>
<P>
   It shows the strange position the prosecutors were left in when
the House threw out one perjury article stemming from Clinton's
original deposition in the sexual harassment case brought against
him by Paula Jones, when he denied having sexual relations with
Monica Lewinsky. And perhaps most fundamentally, it displays the
continuing lack of agreement on a point the Constitution leaves
opaque: What standard should be used to impeach and convict a
president?
</P>
<P>
   On this last question the House prosecutors have sometimes
seemed to want it both ways. At one point on Monday, Rep. Asa
Hutchinson, R-Ark., told the Senate how a jury sitting in a
criminal obstruction of justice case would be instructed. Just last
month, another manager, by contrast, told senators to disregard the
standards of proof required in a criminal case.
</P>
<P>
   ``The criminal standard of proof, i.e., beyond a reasonable
doubt, is inappropriate in an impeachment trial,'' Rep. Steve
Buyer, R-Ind., said in January. ``Senators, you are to be guided by
your conscience in your own decision.''
</P>
<P>
   But that has left some senators with the uneasy feeling that the
House prosecutors were trying to use a lower threshold for
impeachment than for a criminal case.
</P>
<P>
   And a number of senators made clear that they were applying the
perjury law _ with its requirement that the intent to lie be proved
and not just that someone did not tell the truth _ to the article
of impeachment charging Clinton with perjury.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes to proving perjury, they say you've got to prove
state of mind,'' said Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa. ``That's very
hard. That's hard to prove beyond a reasonable doubt.'' Sen. Larry
Craig, R-Idaho, said, ``I think too many of our lawyers are being
lawyers and they are using the technical definition of perjury.''
</P>
<P>
   This same issue has been debated since the House Judiciary
Committee began considering impeachment. Two months ago, Charles
F.C. Ruff, the White House counsel, conceded to the committee that
``reasonable people'' might decide that the president had lied in
the Paula Jones deposition and in grand jury testimony about his
affair with Ms. Lewinsky. ``But in his mind _ and that's the heart
and soul of perjury _ he thought and he believed that what he was
doing was being evasive but truthful,'' Ruff said.
</P>
<P>
   The House, by a vote of 228-206, approved an article of perjury
nonetheless in the case of Clinton's grand jury testimony. It then
rejected an article of impeachment based on perjury in the Jones
case. That was because enough Republicans agreed with Democrats
that a perjury case would never be brought in a civil case that had
been thrown out of court. But it had the odd effect of removing
from the case the supposed lie that has been at its core.
</P>
<P>
   The article on obstruction of justice squeaked by the House,
221-212, only because of doubts the prosecutors had proved the
case.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, the House prosecutors chose to focus most
particularly on their obstruction case, in part to shore it up and
in part because senators were indicating that if this case, with
its overtones of Watergate, were proven it would be a serious
enough abuse of state power to warrant removal.
</P>
<P>
   So the three witnesses that the House prosecutors called _ Ms.
Lewinsky, Vernon Jordan and Sidney Blumenthal _ were questioned
most particularly about the elements of the obstruction case: why
Clinton's secretary, Betty Currie, picked up gifts from Ms.
Lewinsky; why Jordan was looking for a job for Ms. Lewinsky; why
Ms. Lewinsky filed a false affidavit.
</P>
<P>
   To many Republicans, the prosecutors indeed assembled a
troubling set of facts. ``Even though it's more complicated, it
seems stronger,'' Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., said on Monday in
distinguishing the obstruction of justice article from the one on
perjury.
</P>
<P>
   But to convict the president, the Republicans would have had to
win over all 55 Republicans and 12 Democrats. And Democrats in
particular said they did not think the Republican prosecutors had
gone beyond a strong circumstantial case on the obstruction charge.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard Durbin, D-Ill., said that he had been disturbed by
the president's actions last January when he called in Mrs. Currie
on a Sunday and started asking her whether he had been alone with
Ms. Lewinsky. But he said the House Republicans lost the
possibility of obtaining his vote when they did not call Mrs.
Currie as a witness. ``You have to have Currie,'' he said. ``You
cannot prove this without Currie.''
</P>
<P>
   And while Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., said he thought the House
prosecutors had done a good job ``of assembling circumstantial
evidence'' of obstruction, ``I've got to get beyond reasonable
doubt. And I still have reasonable doubt.''

PREVIEW THE SWIMSUIT EDITION ON CNNSI.com 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOMMY CUMMINGS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   That soft clicking you'll hear at 5 p.m. Tuesday will probably
be the sound of swimsuit enthusiasts all over the 'Net clicking
their mice to configure their monitor to show a swimsuit model as
wallpaper.
</P>
<P>
   Yep, it's time for Sports Illustrated's annual swimsuit edition.
</P>
<P>
   Before the magazine hits newstands Wednesday, CNNSI.com _ the
24-hour sports site operated jointly by Cable News Network and
Sports Illustrated _ plans to post photo galleries of the models at
its site. As a sneak preview Monday night, the magazine cover was
unveiled on CNNSI.com and Yahoo! conducted a live chat with Rebecca
Stamos, this year's cover model.
</P>
<P>
   It's the second consecutive year that CNNSI.com has posted an
exclusive online preview of the magazine cover.
</P>
<P>
   CNNSI.com also plans an online gallery of more than 100 photos
of this year's models and behind-the-scenes video clips from a
Turner Network Television special on the swimsuit edition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We put stuff online that can't fit in the magazine,'' said
Hart Hooton, general manager of CNN/SI Interactive. ``The editors
have about 70,000 photos to go through. So what we do is take some
of the great photos that swimsuit editors don't get in the
magazine.''
</P>
<P>
   It isn't all sexist hyperbole. Tuesday, CNNSI.com also plans to
unveil its ``Hits and Mrs'' section, which is a collection of
images of athletes with their spouses. It includes more than 100
photos, some of which are from the magazine and others exclusive to
CNNSI.com.
</P>
<P>
   Swimsuit '99 on CNNSI.com will also link to three previous
online editions of the swimsuit issue, featuring more than 250
additional photos.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no concern that what we're doing online will
cannibalize what we're doing in the magazine,'' Hooton said.
``Newstand sales are incredibly strong.''
</P>
<P>
   The magazine is an institution and people want to buy it, Hooton
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, photography on print is better than photography on the
computer screen,'' he said. ``People who see the online site will
still want to buy the magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a win-win situation.''
</P>
<P>
   FROM THE HOME OFFICE ...: Sport Magazine's March edition rates
the top 40 sports sites, according to navigation, content, design
and unobtrusive advertising. No. 1 is not ESPN.com or CBS
SportsLine. Total Sports (www.totalsports.com), described by
editors as ``low on glitz; high on substance'' is the top choice.
The rest of the top five: hockey site In The Crease
(www.inthecrease.com), Athlete Daily (www.athletedaily.com),
CNNSI.com and CBS SportsLine. ESPN is No. 13.
</P>
<P>
   FROM THE NBA WITH LOVE: The courting of fans continues for the
NBA. Beginning this week, NBA.com, as part of a league-wide
Valentine's Day promotion, plans to send out 400,000 electronic
Valentine's Day cards to fans worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   GARAGE-CAM: NASCAR Online (www.nascar.com) plans a

THREE MORE JOURNALISTS ARRESTED IN ZIMBABWE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By SUZANNE DALEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ Two days after President Robert
Mugabe of Zimbabwe went on national television threatening ``very
stern measures'' against the independent press, three more
journalists were arrested Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The arrests come just weeks after the detention and reported
torture of two journalists for writing about an alleged coup plot
within the military.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's arrests began when detectives took Grace Kwinje from
the offices of the weekly Zimbabwe Mirror, apparently to question
her about an article she wrote in October on the return of bodies
from Congo. Some 8,000 Zimbabwean troops are there, backing
President Laurent Kabila in his fight against rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kwinje's article described how the family of one Zimbabwean
soldier had been given only his head to bury. The military denied
the report.
</P>
<P>
   Later, police returned to The Mirror and arrested the news
editor, Fernando Goncalves, and another editor, Farai Mungazi.
</P>
<P>
   The two journalists arrested last month, Mark Chavunduka and Ray
Choto from The Sunday Standard, said they were stripped, beaten and
tortured with electric shocks before they were finally released.
The paper obtained a court order for their release, but the
military repeatedly ignored it.
</P>
<P>
   The episode set off an outcry among human rights advocates and
journalists. On Jan. 25, three members of the Supreme Court wrote
Mugabe asking him to ``confirm that the rule of law is accepted as
a necessary ingredient of a democratic Zimbabwe.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter also asked that he confirm that the army had no power
to arrest civilians and that the government would not tolerate
torture, and to reassure the judiciary that the government would
act in accordance with Zimbabwe's constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Mugabe took to the airwaves Saturday night and attacked
the ``impudence'' of the judiciary. He suggested that the members
of the Supreme Court resign, attacked independent newspapers and
warned of stern measures against ``acts of sabotage'' by opponents.

MICROSOFT EXECUTIVE DROPS FEW BOMBS IN TESTIMONY 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ At the Microsoft trial Monday, the biggest news was
what did not happen: For the first time since the company began
presenting its defense against federal antitrust charges last
month, a major company witness did not leave the courtroom with his
head on a platter.
</P>
<P>
   All through the government's presentation of its case against
the Microsoft Corp. last year, company executives counseled
patience. When their time came, they promised, they would present a
robust, effective defense.
</P>
<P>
   But David Boies, the government's lead trial lawyer, has managed
to force the first three significant Microsoft witnesses to make
damaging statements or to admit embarrassing mistakes, throwing
serious credibility questions before Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson,
who is hearing the case without a jury.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's witness _ William Poole, senior director of business
development for the company's Windows operating system _ managed to
hold his own, though Boies did leave him mumbling and stammering
and even backpedaling a few times.
</P>
<P>
   When Poole returns on Tuesday, he will try to hold his ground
while Boies tries to push him back even further.
</P>
<P>
   Poole oversaw the negotiation of contracts in which Microsoft
required Internet companies to limit business dealings with the
Netscape Communications Corp., maker of Navigator, the Web browser
that is the chief competitor to Microsoft's Internet Explorer
browser. In exchange, Microsoft awarded the companies advertising
space on Windows' opening desktop screen.
</P>
<P>
   Under questioning, Poole acknowledged that Microsoft had
estimated in 1996 that it could earn about $100 million a year by
selling that advertising space but decided to charge nothing.
Instead, the companies had to sign binding contracts to promote
Internet Explorer and to cease all significant dealings with
Netscape.
</P>
<P>
   Poole said one major company, Intuit Inc., maker of the popular
personal finance program Quicken, had approached Microsoft ``and
asked us to let them use our browser'' instead of Netscape's.
Quicken uses links to Web pages for many of its services.
</P>
<P>
   But that testimony contradicted earlier testimony of Intuit's
chief executive, William H. Harris. And Boies displayed an internal
Microsoft e-mail from 1996 that told another story.
</P>
<P>
   In it, Bill Gates, Microsoft's chairman, summarized for Brad
Chase, another senior executive, a conversation with Intuit's
chairman at the time, Scott Cook.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was quite frank with him that if he had a favor we could do
for him that would cost us something like $1 million, to do that in
return for switching browsers in the next few months, I would be
open to doing that,'' Gates wrote. But Cook was reticent, he said.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks later, Chase reported back to Gates: ``I talked to
them again today. I just don't think they are prepared to jump this
hurdle. I suggested that at least they ship both browsers.''
</P>
<P>
   Poole said he had never seen the e-mail exchange, even though it
was entered into evidence in the trial many weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your lawyers didn't show this to you?'' Boies asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't remember seeing it,'' Poole said.
</P>
<P>
   A Microsoft spokesman later said the company had issued a new
and improved version of Internet Explorer between the time Gates
negotiated with Intuit and when Poole worked out a contract.
</P>
<P>
   With some help from the judge, Boies also got Poole to admit
that the restrictive contracts with Intuit and others were not
standard practices for the company or the industry, as Poole had
asserted in his direct, written testimony.
</P>
<P>
   After Boies repeatedly posed the question, only to get rambling
off-point responses, Jackson finally interrupted, shaking his head
as Poole set off again, saying: ``No, No, No. Try to answer, Mr.
Poole. Yes, no or I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Boies was in the middle of asking his final question as court
ended for the day, challenging Poole's assertion that ``only 4.7
percent of users surveyed stated that they first became aware of a
Web site that they now frequently visit through a pre-configured
browser setting or start page.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue is important because Microsoft and Netscape both ship
their browsers with links already pre-loaded to important,
money-earning Web pages.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson adjourned court before Poole could find the reference he
needed in the survey data.
</P>
<P>
   Poole will complete his testimony on Tuesday. The next witness,
Cameron Myhrvold, a Microsoft vice president in the Internet
Customer Unit division, stated in written testimony that Netscape
has thrived despite competition from Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact,'' Myhrvold wrote, ``Microsoft has acted as a
pro-competitive force in restoring competition'' in the browser
business.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Todd Oldham said Monday that he had sold his
trademark to Jones Apparel Group, making him perhaps the only
designer of his generation to set up a viable structure that could
position his signature as a major brand in the next millennium. The
purchase price was not disclosed, but Oldham will receive income
based on the profitability of his labels.
</P>
<P>
   Jones Apparel, a public company and one of Seventh Avenue's most
successful businesses, produces Todd Oldham jeans and two of Ralph
Lauren's lower-priced collections, Polo Ralph Lauren jeans and
Lauren by Ralph Lauren, all under license. The company took over
the Todd Oldham jeans business last year when it purchased Sun
Apparel, which had held the license.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new agreement, Jones Apparel will have the right to
use the Oldham name for all fashions and fragrances for men and
women worldwide. It will also get the designer's two stores, one in
SoHo, the other in South Beach, Miami Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Oldham, through his design studio, will oversee creative aspects
for the brand, from design to advertising. He retains ownership of
his name for all other endeavors, like architecture, film, video
direction and interior design, all of which he has already been
involved in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have so many other interests,'' Oldham said. ``I don't want
to be more involved than I am, working on designing. We'll continue
to supply design in all the areas.''
</P>
<P>
   Designers who followed Halston were loathe to give up their
names after Halston saw his cachet drop precipitously when he sold
his name to the mass market. Rather than being forlorn about
selling his signature, Oldham says that doing so will let him have
the kind of market reach he has always wanted. ``You can't ever do
this alone,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jones Apparel, which is better known for collections that cut
with the dull edge of the fashion knife, like Jones New York and
Lauren, plans to go after a younger crowd, said Eric Rothfeld, the
president of the company's Sun Apparel division. ``Our focus is to
build Todd Oldham Jeans into a mega brand,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The deal may well give Oldham the wherewithal to reintroduce his
top line, which he closed last year. But he said that that was
unlikely. ``I don't ever go back,'' he said. ``When it's done, it's
done.''
</P>
<P>
   ACTRESS TO TOUT MEN'S WEAR
</P>
<P>
   There may be no more appropriate time to announce a men's-wear
advertisement featuring a woman than this week, when the combined
New York men's and women's shows commence. Mondo di Marco, an
Italian men's-wear company, has signed the actress Ellen Barkin to
appear in print advertisements for its fall campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The advertisements, to be photographed next month, will be
created by the Laspata/DeCaro Studio.
</P>
<P>
   ``Immediately when it was brought to our attention, we had
visions of sexiness, of someone everybody knows, someone everybody
likes,'' Warren Katz, the president of Mondo Inc., said, referring
to Ms. Barkin's appropriateness for a men's-wear promotion.
</P>
<P>
   Advertisements, which will include a male model, may provide a
nice segue into Mondo's first foray into women's wear, scheduled to
be in stores in the fall. Ms. Barkin will not wear Mondo women's
clothing in the ads, however, because the collection will not be
ready in time for photography, Katz said. In fact, Katz could not
say whether Ms. Barkin, known for her steamy portrayals in movies
like ``Sea of Love,'' would be wearing anything at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``She may not be wearing much,'' Katz said.
</P>
<P>
   With Ms. Barkin on board, the campaign may also help raise
Mondo's low profile. The company last year had about $60 million in
worldwide sales, Katz said, and is carried in stores like
Bloomingdale's and Saks Fifth Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Plans are to expand the company's advertising beyond the usual
men's magazines to include publications like Vanity Fair and In
Style. ``We've been advertising in men's magazines a lot, and I
never thought we got the recognition we deserved,'' he said.

FOR THE EYES, COOL GEOMETRY

   NEW YORK _ Oversized glasses, like oversize jewelry, look rather
passe. Chic men and women today tend to favor small frames not only
for reading, but also for all corrective lenses and for tinted
glasses (except, of course, when they are out in bright sunlight
and require maximum protection).
</P>
<P>
   Oval shapes had their moment. Now, the coolest people choose
horizontal rectangles and other geometric shapes that just cover
the eyes, baring the brows, says Robert Marc, who owns five
fashionable optical stores in Manhattan. The lines he carries
include Lunor, Proksch and Retro Specs. The glasses may be rimless
or have very thin frames of gold or platinum or of colored acetate
or buffalo horn. The buffalo horn comes in shades from pale blond
to almost black, while the acetate can be a solid color or subtly
layered with a second tone. Lenses may be tinted many colors,
including cobalt, yellow, rose, olive, mint, orange or violet.

VATICAN CLOSES BOOK ON KILLING OF SWISS GUARDS COMMANDER 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Nine months after the commander of the Swiss Guards was
killed inside the Holy See, the Vatican closed the case Monday,
concluding that the church investigators' initial hypothesis _ that
he was killed by a disgruntled subordinate _ was correct.
</P>
<P>
   On May 4, only a few hours after he was appointed to lead the
Vatican army that has guarded popes since the 16th century, Alois
Estermann and his wife, Gladys Meza Romero, were found shot dead in
their Vatican apartment. The body of a 23-year-old Swiss guard,
Cedric Tornay, was discovered nearby.
</P>
<P>
   ``The conclusion has been reached that the Estermanns were
killed by Vice Cpl. Cedric Tornay, who then took his own life with
the same ordnance pistol,'' the report concluded.
</P>
<P>
   After the shootings, the Vatican moved uncharacteristically fast
to debunk rumors that the killings were a crime of passion or a
result of some other internal scandal, assigning two investigators,
Gianluigi Marrone and Nicola Picardi, to the case that night. The
next day, the Vatican announced that preliminary evidence showed
that Tornay, resentful over a recent reprimand by his commanding
officer, had opened fire in a ``fit of madness.''
</P>
<P>
   In Monday's report, the Vatican refined its definition of
Tornay's state of mind, reporting that drugs and mental illness may
have also played a part in the murders. The autopsy, the report
said, revealed traces of cannibis in his urine, as well as a cyst
``the size of a pigeon egg'' in the left frontal lobe of his brain
that could have severely impaired his judgment.
</P>
<P>
   In Switzerland, Tornay's mother, Muguette Baudat, told an
Italian newspaper on Sunday that she did not believe the Vatican.
She repeated her assertions that her son was murdered and made a
scapegoat in a broader plot.
</P>
<P>
   ``A mother's pain is understandable and must be respected,'' the
Vatican spokesman, Joaquin Navarro-Valls, told reporters Monday.
``But a very detailed investigation leaves no room for an
alternative hypothesis.''

GEORGIA LEGISLATORS APPROVE BILL TO BLOCK SUITS AGAINST GUN MAKERS
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Gun manufacturers and their supporters began a long
and expensive counterattack on Monday on the growing number of
lawsuits that cities are filing against the gun industry by
successfully pushing the Georgia Senate to pass the first bill in
the nation intended to block such suits.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, which has moved rapidly through the Legislature,
was passed by the House last month, and Georgia's governor, Roy
Barnes, who was endorsed by the National Rifle Association in his
recent campaign, is expected to sign the bill this week.
</P>
<P>
   Although Atlanta joined four other cities in filing suit against
the gun industry in state court last Thursday, the bill contains
language that would explicitly quash all pending gun litigation by
Georgia cities, as well as any in the future. The city has vowed to
fight the measure on constitutional grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Pro-gun lobbyists were delighted at the strong show of support,
saying the Georgia effort marks the beginning of a campaign against
city gun lawsuits that gun makers and the NRA intend to fight in
dozens of state capitals. With their conservative traditions and
easy access for lobbyists, statehouses have traditionally been the
stronghold of the industry, with nearly 40 states, including
Georgia, already having laws that prohibit their cities from
enacting any form of gun control.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the beginning of a long, arduous process that we wish
we didn't have to engage in, but we are going to devote a lot of
time and resources to it,'' said James Baker, director of the NRA's
lobbying arm, the Institute for Legislative Action. ``In the next
year, I think we can probably get 25 or 30 more states to do the
same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The next stop, he said, is Louisiana, where the organization
plans to have a bill filed the first day the state Legislature
opens in March.
</P>
<P>
   New Orleans was the first of several cities to file lawsuits
against the gun industry, seeking millions of dollars to reimburse
local treasuries for the cost of the police and hospital services
required because of gun violence. Other cities that filed such
suits include Miami, Chicago and Bridgeport, Conn., and many others
are preparing or contemplating such litigation, modeled after
similar successful efforts against the tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's suit, brought against 14 manufacturers and three trade
groups, accuses the companies of failing to install safety devices
or provide adequate warnings of the dangers of guns. It seeks
unspecified damages to compensate the city for the cost of mopping
up after gun violence. Mayor Bill Campbell, who has championed the
suit in defiance of the Legislature, vowed on Monday to fight the
industry's bill on constitutional grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Having watched the tobacco industry first fight and then
eventually settle liability lawsuits around the country, the
far-less-prosperous gun industry has vowed not to let the same
thing happen to its members. But without many friends in the White
House or in city halls, the firearms lobby is concentrating on
statehouses like the one here, targeting legislators who have used
NRA endorsements as badges of anti-crime toughness. With about
90,000 active members in the state, the NRA contributes heavily to
Georgia politicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``This goes back to when I was driving in my car back in
December, and I heard something on the radio about the Chicago
suit,'' said state Rep. Curtis Jenkins, a Democrat from rural
Forsythe, who introduced the bill. ``It crossed my mind that
Atlanta might look at this, and I had a talk with the NRA, which
has been a great help with this bill. They had all kinds of
suggestions as we were drafting it.''
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins and other legislative leaders said lawmakers voted for
the bill because they believe the lawsuits are a backdoor form of
gun control, trying to restrict access to guns by putting gun
manufacturers out of business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Georgia is a strong Second Amendment state,'' said Sen. Eric
Johnson, the Republican minority leader from Savannah. ``People
here see any attempt to sue gun manufacturers as an attempt to
restrict the citizen's right to keep and bear arms.'' Both houses
passed the bills with strong bipartisan majorities, the Senate
voting 44-11, the House 146-25. Barnes has not commented publicly
on the bill, but legislative leaders said they have been assured by
his office that he will sign it.
</P>
<P>
   Many lawmakers were particularly annoyed that Atlanta filed its
suit while the gun industry's largest trade show, known as the Shot
Show, was entertaining 30,000 visitors at the Georgia World
Congress Center here. The industry has pulled next year's show out
of New Orleans because of that city's suit.
</P>
<P>
   Baker, the NRA lobbyist, said he knew there are many states,
including Illinois, where the lobby will not be nearly as
successful. But by undermining lawsuits in friendly states like
Georgia and Louisiana, he said, the industry will be able to narrow
the playing field and concentrate on the 20 or so states posing the
greatest threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're trying to prove that the firearms industry is
responsible for the criminal misuse of firearms,'' he said. ``It's
ludicrous _ totally outside the realm of existing product liability
law. They're trying to do with the court system what they've been
unable to do with state legislatures.''
</P>
<P>
   Anti-gun lobbyists say the NRA will probably be successful in
several state capitals but predicted that enough city lawsuits
would go forward unimpeded to keep the industry busy in court. Many
of the cities that have filed suit are being guided by a group of
the same private lawyers who brought the original suit against the
tobacco companies, and the lawyers say they are ready for the NRA.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be working with cities to fight these bills on
constitutional grounds,'' said Daniel Abel, a partner in the New
Orleans firm of Gauthier, Downing, LaBarre, Beiser &AMP; Dean, which
helped originate the tobacco litigation and drafted New Orleans'
suit against the gun industry. ``These bills violate the right to
self-determination of a city, many of which have home-rule
charters. You'll be seeing a lot of constitutional scholars come
out and address this issue.''

   HMOS AGREE TO HELP PAY MEMBERS' DRUG TRIAL COSTS
</P>
<P>
   After years of resistance, health maintenance organizations have
agreed to help pay the costs of care for members who enroll in
clinical trials evaluating new drugs and medical procedures. As a
result, thousands of patients could receive promising new
treatments they were denied in the past. The agreement was
negotiated over the last year by the National Institutes of Health
and the American Association of Health Plans, the trade group of
the managed care industry, but has not yet been announced.

   SELLING MUSIC VIA THE INTERNET
</P>
<P>
   Major recording companies will begin marketing albums as digital
information transmitted over the Internet. A new system to be
tested this spring is intended to sell authorized recordings in a
medium where most of the music now circulates for free.
</P>
<P>
   TECHNOLOGY SHARES REBOUND
</P>
<P>
   Stock prices were mixed as bellwether technology issues such as
Microsoft and Intel rebounded after falling last week, but
blue-chip securities and shares in small companies, including
Internet stocks, slid in value. Traders and analysts said the
market's performance was impressive in light of the sharp run-up in
prices since October and several new pressures that could lead to a
sharp sell-off.
</P>
<P>
   Bond prices snapped a five-day decline, ending little changed
ahead of a Treasury refunding auction. The 30-year bond yield fell
to 5.34 percent from 5.35.
</P>
<P>
   ANOTHER YEAR 2000 PROBLEM
</P>
<P>
   Year 2000 project managers and other authorities are warning
that Americans fearing the worst may end up inflicting more serious
damage on themselves, their neighbors and the economy than anything
their computers do. Planning experts say those scenarios could
include bank runs, hoarding of food and gasoline, fires caused by
misuse of newly acquired wood stoves and generators and a rise in
gun violence stemming from the surge in firearm sales to those
fearing civil unrest.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA RESTRAINS AIRLINE GROWTH
</P>
<P>
   Chinese authorities asked suppliers of commercial aircraft to
delay deliveries to the nation's airlines, which have been
expanding aggressively. Fare wars and half-empty flights, unknown
in China until recently, are now common among China's two-dozen
airlines. It now seems unlikely that any new orders will be made
this year _ bad news for Boeing and Airbus, which compete for
China's business.
</P>
<P>
   Shandong International Power Development shelved a $285 million
initial public offering, the third major Chinese company in a month
to call off an overseas stock sale.
</P>
<P>
   CABLE COMPANIES TALK WITH AT&AMP;T
</P>
<P>
   Mediaone Group, Comcast and Cox Communications, the third-
through fifth-largest cable providers in the United States, joined
forces in talks with AT&AMP;T regarding local telephone-service
joint-ventures.
</P>
<P>
   3 EXCHANGES PLAN VENTURE
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the Bourse in Paris and the
Singapore International Monetary Exchange signed an agreement that
would allow futures and options to be traded as part of a global
electronic network that would operate around the clock.
</P>
<P>
   BMW SHARES RISE DESPITE TURMOIL
</P>
<P>
   Shares of BMW rose 8.6 percent on the possibility of a sale,
despite a bitter board room dispute over the company's strategy
that led to the ouster of BMW's top two executives and losses at
its Rover subsidiary. Ignoring speculation that it would be taken
over by a larger rival, the company said again that it intended to
stay independent.
</P>
<P>
   NEW RULES FOR INTERNET ADDRESSES
</P>
<P>
   Companies wanting a piece of the lucrative business of issuing
Internet addresses will need at least $100,000 in the bank,
$500,000 in liability insurance and a proven computer
infrastructure, under requirements proposed by the nonprofit
corporation that has been tapped to take over administration of the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   STRENGTHENED AUDIT RULES PROPOSED
</P>
<P>
   A panel created by the leading stock exchanges and markets
recommended rules that would strengthen the role of audit
committees at public companies.

<P>
   The bear that resides in San Francisco's Marini Plaza, the
triangular park at Columbus Avenue and Union Street, has not gone
to Florida for the winter. It's recovering from an act of nature
and an act of vandals, and it's being restored deliberately slowly
by conservator  &UR; Genevieve Baird &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   The sculpture, made of cast metal with a concrete interior,
received a nasty concussion when a tree limb fell on it; shortly
thereafter, its feet were messed up when vandals ripped it from its
concrete pedestal and threw its in the plaza pool.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for the pace of Baird's work is that _ despite the
preponderance of gold leaf elsewhere in town _ the city monuments
fund doesn't have the estimated $5,000 for the repair. Baird, who
has worked closely before with the Art Commission's monuments
expert,  &UR; Debra Lehane &LR; , agreed to work on the job between other
jobs until the community came up with the money. Lehane drove the
bear to the conservator's workshop in the foothills of the Sierra.
</P>
<P>
   Jars placed in North Beach stores and bars have so far collected
$1,000, including a $100 bill left in one jar after the makers of
``EDtv'' used the jar as a prop. Another $1,000 was collected at a
fund-raiser at Little City in January. Several restaurateurs have
kicked in, but community organizers are disappointed that the most
obvious ones have not.

 Exit23b's E-Mail Promise of Free Stock Sounds Like a Dead End  &HT;       
 By Mark Veverka  
 c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
You get what you pay for.
</P>
<P>
   So don't be surprised if e-mail spam promising free shares of an
Internet stock you never heard of doesn't materialize into riches
beyond your wildest digital dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps you are among the scores of computer users who have
received unsolicited e-mails promoting Exit23b, a Web page at
 &LR; www.exit23b.com  &LR; whose seemingly invisible parent company intends
on going public.
</P>
<P>
   It certainly isn't the first time free stock has been promoted
via the World Wide Wait, but this particular electronic-mail offer
is multiplying faster than rabbits.
</P>
<P>
   Judging by the half-dozen or so versions that have crossed our
screens at Street Smarts, this alleged Exit23b cyberstock giveaway
has been disseminated as far as Boston, Chicago and Washington,
D.C.
</P>
<P>
   What appears to be giving this e-mail a creepy Amway-like life
of its own is the mere mention of the search directory Yahoo.
</P>
<P>
   One of the e-mail letters goes like this:
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  For those of you who follow stocks, Yahoo (YHOO) eclipsed &LR; 
 &LR; $400 a share a few weeks ago. When this company was just &LR; 
 &LR; starting out, they gave away stock as a promotional item.  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Nice to have been a part of that, right? Well here's your &LR; 
 &LR; chance because I'm letting you in on the scoop. The new company &LR; 
 &LR; is ..Exit23b.. (and) they will be going public in March. They &LR; 
 &LR; will be an online store for electronics, interactive games, &LR; 
 &LR; music and videos. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  ``To celebrate their launch, (Exit23b) is giving away &LR; 
 &LR; 100,000 shares of their pre-IPO (to be split among) 10 lucky &LR; 
 &LR; winners _ 10,000 shares each. You will receive no junk mail, &LR; 
 &LR; just an announcement of the site launch with the drawing rules &LR; 
 &LR; and regulations. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   There is much that is troublesome about this e-mail beyond its
rather poorly written and incomplete text. The most bothersome of
which is the fact that it's spreading false information.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of STREET09 (93125 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  ``We never, ever gave away free shares of stock,'' says Yahoo
Chief Financial Officer Gary Valenzuela.
</P>
<P>
   Valenzuela would not comment on what actions the company might
take in response to the apparently fraudulent use of Yahoo's name.
</P>
<P>
   Still, that very sticky wicket aside, is this a legitimate
offer? Is there a real company behind the Exit23b Web site?
</P>
<P>
   Who knows? But judging by a cursory look at the available
evidence, this operation smells awfully foul. First of all, the Web
page provides very little information about Exit23b and what the
people behind the page intend to do with the names and e-mail
addresses that it is has been amassing.
</P>
<P>
   It states that Exit23b will launch some kind of operation in
March, and it describes how people who register for the chance to
win free stock get credit for an additional entry each time they
refer someone else to the site. (And that explains why this offer
has proliferated like a chain letter.)
</P>
<P>
   According to Internic.com, an Internet domain registrar, Exit23b
is headquartered in Redmond, Wash. Telephone calls to the number
listed by Internic were answered by a recording, which identified
itself as Exit23b but would not accept recorded messages.
</P>
<P>
   There is no company registered with the Washington secretary of
state with the name Exit23b. Of course, a company registered with a
different name could operate a Web site called Exit23b. But what
kind of business is this anyway if it can't be readily found?
</P>
<P>
   If that isn't persuasive enough to stay away, it sounds by its
own company description as if Exit23b has picked the wrong niche.
The last time I checked, a few major booksellers were duking it out
with online music-sellers in this very crowded retailing segment.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 2 of STREET09 (93125 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Finally, what kind of company gives stock away? Probably not one
worth owning.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for the record, it is not necessarily illegal to give
away stock for free over the Internet. A Securities and Exchange
Commission spokesman would not comment on the legitimacy of Exit23b
or whether it is investigating the stock offer. However, he
provided copies of published letters from the SEC to companies that
wanted to give away free securities.
</P>
<P>
   At least one of those letters indicated that issuing securities
``in consideration of a person's registration on or visit to an
issuer's Internet site'' would constitute a sale under SEC laws.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, those shares essentially are being sold, which
seems to mean that Exit23b would need to meet all regulatory
requirements for a public stock offering.
</P>
<P>
   Something tells us this isn't likely to happen.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; UNVEILED &LR; : It's official.
</P>
<P>
   W.R. Hambrecht, the new investment bank founded by financier
Bill Hambrecht, is open for business.
</P>
<P>
   The bank's electronic auction for securities offerings, OpenIPO,
has begun accepting bids for its first initial public offering:
Ravenswood Winery of Sonoma.
</P>
<P>
   As first reported in Street Smarts, the online underwriter wants
to level the playing field by making IPOs accessible to a wider
group of investors via the Internet. Using a Dutch auction system,
Hambrecht also hopes that companies going public will fetch
offering prices closer to share prices paid on the open market,
says W.R. Hambrecht President Ian Zwicker, who once helped his new
boss build Hambrecht &AMP; Quist into a full-service investment bank
and brokerage.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's different, of course, is that we price and allocate
differently than anyone before,'' says Zwicker, who left Donaldson
Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette to join W.R. Hambrecht.
</P>
<P>
   Zwicker noted that Wall Street's established investment banks
aren't going to take lightly this latest challenge to their clubby
system. ``They're not going to cede market share willingly,''
Zwicker says.

 Former BofA Exec Says Bank Does Back Women  &HT;       
 By Sam Zuckerman 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
One of the seven top female executives who quit BankAmerica after
North Carolina's NationsBank took it over said the new bank is
serious about promoting women and minorities.
</P>
<P>
   In the first public comment by one of the seven senior women who
left, Mary Wikstrom, the former executive vice president who ran
BofA's telephone service centers, praised the new bank for a new
diversity initiative. The plan includes several measures Wikstrom
suggested before she resigned in December.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  ``The bank quite frankly is moving on the path I, as well as
other people, recommended,'' Wikstrom said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   The disclosure two months ago that six of BofA's top 10 female
executives quit after NationsBank bought the bank touched off a
furor in California. The departures included Vice Chairman Kathleen
Burke, who was the bank's human resources chief and highest-ranking
woman.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco and state officials demanded investigations and
asked pointedly whether the mass exodus was caused by NationsBank
bias against women.
</P>
<P>
   Wikstrom thought otherwise. In a memo obtained by The Chronicle,
she described the resignations of the six top-ranking BofA women as
``an unintended situation,'' not the result of discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Wikstrom sent the memo to Kenneth Lewis, the bank's No.2
executive, December 10, a week after a Chronicle story disclosed
the departures of senior women.
</P>
<P>
   In the memo, Wikstrom proposed a four-point program to make sure
women rose to positions of power, eventually filling the vacuum
created by the departures.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after drafting her proposal, Wikstrom herself resigned,
becoming the seventh top-level woman to leave.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Wikstrom, who was offered a job combining the two banks'
telephone operations, said she left for personal reasons. Wikstrom
was eligible for a severance package that included more than a year
of salary and bonus.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the right time for me to make a career switch,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of BOFA09 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  In her memo, Wikstrom wrote that she wanted to shift attention
away from press coverage of the female executive departures to what
could be done to fix the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not have a `problem' in terms of the organization's
sincere support of ... promoting our female management talent. What
we have is ... an unintended situation that emerged as a result of
management selection decisions. Those decisions produced an
unfortunate result _ a reduction in ... female line senior managers
by 80 percent. It is our problem. We intend to remedy it,'' she
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Wikstrom's proposal called on the bank to fill 30 percent of its
top management slots with women within two years, create a
diversity task force reporting to Chief Executive Officer Hugh
McColl, set specific women and minority hiring goals for all senior
managers and build ties to outside women's advocacy groups.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few weeks, the bank has adopted a diversity plan
incorporating several of Wikstrom's ideas.
</P>
<P>
   BofA Chairman and CEO McColl set up a council chaired by
Northern California retail banking chief Barbara Desoer to oversee
the bank's programs for promoting women and minorities. And he
instructed the bank's top executives to develop plans in each of
their business units for advancing women and minorities to
senior-level jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The bank rejected Wikstrom's two-year, 30-percent target for
female managers companywide, though it committed itself to
year-over-year increases in the percentages of top jobs held by
those groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the points that Mary articulated are up and running in
the new company,'' said Lorraine Stimmel, who heads BofA's
diversity programs.
</P>
<P>
   Desoer, the new head of the bank's diversity council, was one of
three top women at the old BofA to stay with the bank after
NationsBank took over.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview, Desoer said the departures of her female
colleagues reflected individual decisions and didn't reflect
discrimination by NationsBank.
</P>
<P>
   ``My perception was the former NationsBank team was more diverse
than the old BofA,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 2 of BOFA09 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  BofA's top management included 10 women and 34 men when
NationsBank bought the bank and took its name in September. The new
bank won't say how many of the men quit, but the proportion is
apparently lower than the seven of 10 women who left.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With the acquittal of President Clinton all but
assured, the chief prosecutor demanded Monday night that the Senate
``cleanse the office'' by convicting him rather than resorting to
``the Air Wick of a censure resolution.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Hyde of Illinois, the last of 13 Republican
prosecutors or ``managers'' to speak, concluded their case by
accusing the defense of resorting to ``a theater of distraction and
misdirection.'' He said his side's ``most formidable opponent'' had
been cynicism _ ``the widespread conviction that all politics and
all politicians are by definition corrupt and venal.''
</P>
<P>
   In his closing statement, the main White House counsel, Charles
F.C. Ruff, urged the senators to focus not upon the minutiae of the
lawyers' arguments but upon ``voices of greater eloquence than any
of us can muster, the voices of Madison and Hamilton and the others
who met in Phildelphia 212 years ago, and the voices of the
generations since, and the voices of the American people now, and
the voices of generations to come.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruff concluded as he had begun on Jan. 19: ``William Jefferson
Clinton is not guilty of the charges that have been brought against
him. He did not commit perjury. He did not commit obstruction of
justice. He must not be removed from office.''
</P>
<P>
   Seemingly drained of emotion and resigned to defeat, Hyde ended
with the words, ``And now let us all take our place in history on
the side of honor, and, oh, yes, let right be done.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate will begin its deliberations on Tuesday, probably
behind closed doors. The votes on the two articles of impeachment,
charging Clinton with perjury and obstruction of justice in an
effort to conceal his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky, are
scheduled for Thursday or Friday. Consideration of a censure
resolution could follow.
</P>
<P>
   For all the historical rarity of Monday's session _ only once
before, in the case of Andrew Johnson in 1868, has a presidential
impeachment proceeding reached this stage _ there was little drama
in the chamber. Having gone over the same ground so often, most
recently on Saturday, the lawyers could offer little but reheated
evidentiary and rhetorical leftovers. And the outcome has been
taken for granted for several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Ruff and Hyde conceded that they, too, like the senators and the
nation at large, were weary of it all.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are taking the last steps along a path that for most of us
has seemed to be unending,'' Ruff commented, and more than three
and a half hours later, Hyde echoed, ``We are blessedly coming to
the end of this melancholy procedure.''
</P>
<P>
   The session was filled with allegations, exhortations and
complaints, lots of complaints, mainly from the prosecutors drawn
from Republican members of the House of Representatives but from
Ruff, too, about the trial procedures and about the nonstop
coverage provided by television.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Republicans, there was a certain fatalistic self-pity.
Hyde spoke bitterly of indignities he said he and his colleagues
had endured, enumerating ``the media condemnations, the patronizing
editorials, the hate mail, the insults hurled in public, the
attempts at intimidation, the death threats and even the
disapproval of our colleagues, which cuts the worst.''
</P>
<P>
   The Illinois legislator compared his team of managers to Henry
V's ``band of brothers'' at Agincourt, and he dipped deep into his
oratorical reservoir for quotations from Charles de Gaulle and
Terence Rattigan, Septimius Severus and Horace Mann, Edward Gibbon
and Saul Bellow.
</P>
<P>
   He compared the text of one of the proposed censure resolutions
with that of the impeachment articles and said, ``We aren't half as
tough on the president.'' But he continued to express strong
opposition to censure, which is favored by most Democrats and some
Republicans as a means short of conviction to put the Senate on
record as condemning Clinton's actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``A failure to convict will make the statement that lying under
oath, while unpleasant and to be avoided, is not all that
serious,'' Hyde declared. ``We have reduced lying under oath to a
breach of etiquette, but only if you are the president.''
</P>
<P>
   A recent poll, as several of the lawyers observed, showed that
more than half of Americans thought the president guilty but did
not wish him removed from office. The defense drew comfort from
this, and the prosecutors expressed frustration at it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I doubt there are many people on the planet who doubt the
president has repeatedly lied under oath and has obstructed
justice,'' Hyde said. ``The real issue doesn't concern the facts
but what to do about them.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Barr of Georgia, who was the first House member to
introduce an impeachment resolution (over the president's campaign
fund raising), lectured the senators about polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Polls played no part in the great and glorious decisions,
decisive decisions, that made America a nation and kept it free and
strong,'' Barr asserted. ``Will the principles embodied in our
Constitution and our laws be reaffirmed, wrested from the pallid
hands of pollsters and pundits and the swarm of theorists
surrounding these proceedings?''
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans devoted relatively little time on Monday to the
details of the case. Instead, they flung swords of words at the
president and his defenders. Rep. Bill McCollum said angrily,
``William Jefferson Clinton is not a king.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Floridian, Rep. Charles Canaday, warned senators they
were about to set ``a pathetic, low standard of integrity.'' Rep.
Lindsey Graham of South Carolina heaped scorn on the defense
contention that President Clinton had been ``truthful but
misleading.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How can you be both?'' he demanded, his voice dripping
contempt.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   One of the last Republicans to speak before Hyde was Rep. James
Rogan of California, a former Democrat whose district leans
Democratic. His leading role in the drive for conviction has
convinced some politicians his seat is in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   ``So be it,'' he said on Monday, in one of several attempts by
Republicans to demonstrate that principle, not politics, motivated
their behavior. ``That revelation produces for me no flinching. I
can live with the concept of not serving in Congress. I cannot live
with the idea of remaining in Congress at the expense of doing what
I believed to be right.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruff was the only speaker on the president's side, and he
stopped well short of his three-hour limit.
</P>
<P>
   But he went methodically through his arguments on the two
articles and on the larger point that he has consistently pressed:
even if the senators were to find Clinton had committed the offense
charged, this by itself would not justify their voting to convict
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is only one question before you, albeit a difficult one,
one that is a question of fact and law and constitutional theory,''
Ruff said. ``Would it put at risk the liberties of the people to
retain the president in office? Putting aside partisan animus, if
you can honestly say that it would not, that those liberties are
safe in his hands, then you must vote to acquit.''
</P>
<P>
   He was sarcastic in his treatment of the managers' case. ``Nice
try, no facts,'' he commented at one point. And at another, only
moments later, ``Somebody's been watching too many reruns of the
X-Files.''
</P>
<P>
   But at the end, after discussing Blackstone and Sidney
Blumenthal, perjury and obstruction, after pointing at charts with
a long wand and cuing up videotape clips, he entered a general
defense of Clinton's conduct of his office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Manager Hyde questioned whether this president can represent
the interests of our country in the world,'' he said. ``Go to
Ireland and ask that question. Go to Israel and Gaza and ask that
question. If you doubt whether he should here at home continue in
office, ask the parent whose child walks safer streets, or the men
and women who go off to work in the morning at good jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   And then he said this: ``We are together, I think, weavers of a
constitutional fabric in which all of us now are clothed and
generations will be clothed for millenia to come. We cannot leave
even the smallest flaw in that fabric, for if we do, one day
someone will come along and pull a thread, and the flaw will
grow.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the classic summation of a defender. Do no unnecessary
harm to a man and a system, Ruff was contending, if both of them
work.

JUDGE DENIES BAIL TO SUSPECT IN EMBASSY BOMBINGS CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (ATTN: Texas)  
(See also SUDAN-BOMBING) (sw) 
 By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A federal judge in Manhattan refused on Monday to
grant bail to a suspect in the investigation of the U.S. Embassy
bombings in Africa in August, finding that prosecutors had made
``an overwhelming case'' that the man was dangerous and might flee
if released on bond.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect, Wadih el Hage, a naturalized American citizen, has
been described by the authorities as the former personal secretary
to Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile believed by the government to
be behind the deadly attacks.
</P>
<P>
   El Hage, 38, who last lived in Arlington, Texas, has been
charged with conspiracy to kill Americans abroad and with lying to
government investigators. El Hage is imprisoned in the Metropolitan
Correctional Center.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, el Hage's lawyer, Bruce McIntyre, told Judge Leonard
B. Sand of Federal District Court in Manhattan that his client was
a devout family man who ``categorically denies'' being a member of
any terrorism group. He said that el Hage had worked only as a
secretary in bin Laden's legitimate commercial enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has never been any tie to show that el Hage had anything
to do with any violence,'' McIntyre said, ``or any of the other
crimes which have been attributed to bin Laden.''
</P>
<P>
   But prosecutors cited evidence that el Hage was a critical
operative in the terrorist conspiracy who was able to travel freely
with an American passport. They said he used codes to communicate
with suspected bombers and lied to agents from the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   ``In short, Your Honor, el Hage has served as a front man for
the bin Laden organization for years,'' Patrick J. Fitzgerald, a
federal prosecutor, told the judge.
</P>
<P>
   During the hearing, both sides offered new details about el Hage
and the government's investigation into bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   McIntyre revealed that his client had come to the United States
in 1997 _ about a year before the bombings in Tanzania and Kenya _
after he was warned by the FBI in Africa that he or his family
might be in danger.
</P>
<P>
   The government disagreed with part of that account. But outside
court, McIntyre said el Hage had been warned by the FBI that he
might be in danger because of his knowledge of bin Laden's
enterprises, which if revealed could harm bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   Disputing the defense arguments, Fitzgerald gave new details
that he said linked el Hage to ``both violence and violent
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgerald said that el Hage admitted to investigators that he
had met about 10 years ago with Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, the
Egyptian cleric who is serving a life prison term for his
conviction in 1995 in a conspiracy to blow up the United Nations
and other New York City landmarks.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgerald also publicly asserted for the first time that there
was a link between bin Laden and a Muslim leader, Moataz Al-Hallak
of Arlington, Texas, who has been described as a supporter of el
Hage. Last week, McIntyre told Sand that his client wanted to call
Al-Hallak, the imam at the Islamic Society of Arlington, the mosque
where el Hage was a member.
</P>
<P>
   But on Monday, Fitzgerald portrayed Al-Hallak as more than a
religious leader. ``Moataz Al-Hallak has served as a contact
between members of the bin Laden organization,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Without elaborating, Fitzgerald said, ``This is a case about
murder and conspiracy to murder, not about religion.''
</P>
<P>
   Al-Hallak, reached by phone on Monday night, said he had no idea
what the prosecutor was talking about.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very strange,'' he said, reiterating what he said in
an interview last week, that his mosque is educational and
religious and that he condemns violence.
</P>
<P>
   McIntyre said after the hearing that he was disappointed in the

   JERUSALEM _ The Palestinian men chatting in the clothing store
Monday on East Jerusalem's main shopping thoroughfare were no fans
of King Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   Down the street, a store displayed a black-bordered picture of
the late monarch. Another shopkeeper put out a large framed picture
of the king. But there wasn't much sympathy for him in the clothing
shop.
</P>
<P>
   One of the men, when asked about feelings, said, ``It would be
better if we didn't say anything.'' Still, the conversation rambled
on and resentment sputtered out.
</P>
<P>
   ``What has he done for his people?,'' asked another man, who
said he had relatives in Jordan and refused to be named.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many can barely afford bread, and he sent his Bedouin troops
against them when they protested. He sold out the West Bank to the
Israelis in the 1967 war. He comforted Israeli parents whose girls
were killed by a Jordanian soldier, but did he ever visit
Palestinians who lost children in the intifada? Like all Arab
leaders he looked out for himself, and he did the bidding of the
Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   In another store, Fayez Natsheh said he would never forget how
the king unleashed his army against PLO guerrillas in Jordan in
1970, killing hundreds and driving them out of his kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   ``History can't be erased,'' Natsheh said.
</P>
<P>
   Yasser Arafat saluted the king Monday as his body lay in state,
but conversations with ordinary Palestinians showed mixed feelings
toward the monarch, who had a long and checkered relationship with
the Palestinian national movement.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan lost the West Bank in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, and for
decades afterward, Jordan and the PLO competed for influence in the
area.
</P>
<P>
   For a long while the king cultivated religious and
administrative links to the territory. Tracing his descent from the
prophet Muhammad, he saw himself as the guardian of the Islamic
holy places in East Jerusalem. He paid salaries to religious
functionaries there and other civil servants in the West Bank, and
supported newspapers and institutions sympathetic to his rule.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1988, after the outbreak of the Palestinian uprising and
in recognition of Palestinian claims to the West Bank, King Hussein
formally cut administrative and legal ties to the territory, and
stopped payments to civil servants.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, he relinquished his claim to the territory and
consistently supported Palestinian demands for an independent state
in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
   Yet strong links remain between both banks of the Jordan. Many
people in the West Bank have relatives in Jordan, where
Palestinians form the majority of the population. The king financed
the re-gilding of the Dome of the Rock shrine in Jerusalem's Old
City in 1994, and his peace agreement with Israel ensures that
Jordan's role as protector of Muslim holy places in Jerusalem will
be given ``high priority'' in any agreement with the Palestinians
on the future of East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Other issues to be negotiated between Israel and the
Palestinians, such as water, refugees and borders are considered
vital national interests in Jordan, and it is certain to seek a
role in any future agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian officials say that they expect continued strong
support for their cause from King Abdullah, the new monarch,
reflecting a continuity of policy that transcends individual
personalities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jordan is a state of institutions,'' said Tayeb Abdel Rahim, a
close aide to Arafat. ``The relations between Jordan and the
Palestinian Authority are solid and will remain stable. We are one
family.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the officials concede that the commanding authority of King
Hussein will be sorely lacking in the peace effort.
</P>
<P>
   That sense of loss was evident Monday in the Palestinian press,
which reported sympathetically on the death. ``We have lost a
guide,'' said the Al Quds newspaper in an editorial.
</P>
<P>
   As he read over a newspaper down the street, Iyad al-Qaisi, a
Palestinian, said that the Palestinians' troubled history with King
Hussein was now a thing of the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``When someone dies all that is forgotten,'' he said. ``God have
mercy on him.''

USA NETWORKS AND LYCOS IN A COMPLEX MERGER DEAL
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.)  (nk) 
 By GERALDINE FABRIKANT and SAUL HANSELL 
  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   USA Networks Inc. has agreed to exchange its home-shopping
operations for control of Lycos Inc., the fourth most popular
network of Internet sites, people close to the deal said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The complex deal, which is expected to be announced Tuesday,
would create a company valued at $18 billion called USA Lycos. It
would combine Lycos, which offers Internet search services,
information and online communities, with USA Networks' companies
that sell goods on line, on television and over the telephone.
These include the Home Shopping Network, Ticketmaster Online,
Citysearch and ISN First Auction.
</P>
<P>
   The transaction is a bet that the best way to profit from the
huge audience that sites like Lycos have built is not by selling
advertising, as they have done so far, but to sell goods directly
to Internet users.
</P>
<P>
   As users of Lycos search for information about fashion, they
will see cubic zirconium offered by the Home Shopping Network,
local news will be accompanied by nearby concert ticket offerings
from Ticketmaster, and so on.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a new convergence of entertainment, information and
direct selling,'' said a person close to the deal. For USA, the
deal moves its shopping properties that mostly do business over the
telephone rapidly into the Internet age.
</P>
<P>
   ``Electronic commerce has enormous wind at its back,'' this
person said. ``And notwithstanding what people say about the crazy
valuations, over the next two or five years, we will find something
that has a very real base.''
</P>
<P>
   Until late last week, Lycos had been in negotiations to sell a
stake to NBC in return for on-air promotion. However several people
close to the discussions said that the talks had begun to falter.
Talks between Robert J. Davis, the chief executive of Lycos, and
Barry Diller, the chairman of USA Networks, began in earnest last
week, and Lycos was negotiating with both companies for a while
before striking the deal with USA.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is unusually complex because USA has spun off a partial
interest in its Ticketmaster/Citysearch unit to the public. Thus
Lycos will acquire the part of Ticketmaster that USA does not own
for 8.5 percent of the shares of the combined company. And Lycos
will trade a 61.5 interest in return for the Home Shopping Network,
ISN First Auction, and USA's stake in Ticketmaster. USA will have
about 96 percent of the voting rights in the new company.
</P>
<P>
   Lycos and Ticketmaster shareholders will also receive warrants
that would give them the right to increase their stake in the
company by 6.25 percent, but only if its stock market value soars
to the astronomical level of $45 billion. Based on Lycos' closing
share price of $127.25 on Monday, the new company would have a
market value of $18 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Seagram Corp. owns 45 percent of USA and could have
blocked the deal, its three board members voted for it.
</P>
<P>
   One of several sites that started by helping people search the
Internet, Lycos has moved to keep its audience from surfing away by
offering ever more services from news to chat rooms to electronic
mail. Now known as portal sites _ because they serve as gateways to
all sorts of Internet activities _ Lycos and its competitors Yahoo,
Excite, Infoseek and others have become attractive to big media
companies.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Last year, the Walt Disney Co. bought half of Infoseek and
incorporated it into its new Go portal. NBC bought a stake in Snap,
a small portal. And so far this year, Excite was bought by At Home,
a service that offers high speed Internet access over cable
television wires. And Yahoo, the leading portal, bought Geocities,
the largest collection of personal home pages.
</P>
<P>
   Lycos has been on an aggressive acquisition spree, buying a
series of smaller Internet sites to expand its audience. In
December, Lycos was the fourth most popular network of Internet
sites, reaching 26 million people, according to Media Metrix. The
most visited was America Online, followed by Microsoft and Yahoo.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Davis, the chief executive of Lycos, has said that the
company wanted to sell a partial interest to a media company in
order to receive the sort of promotion that Disney is providing to
Infoseek.
</P>
<P>
   USA has also been on an aggressive acquisition binge over the
last two years, merging with Ticketmaster in 1997 in a deal valued
at $800 million. It subsequently merged online operations with
Citysearch, an online city guide, and sold 40 percent to the
public. The Ticketmaster online business has a market
capitalization of $4 billion. Last year, the company also swapped
45 percent of its equity for Seagram's Universal Television, USA
Networks and the Sci-fi Channel in a deal valued at $4.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   USA is effectively spinning off assets that represent 62 percent
of its sales and retaining in the existing company USA Network, the
Sci-fi Channel, Universal Television and the company's 16
television stations.
</P>
<P>
   The businesses contributed by USA represent sales of $1.5
billion and cash flow of $562 million. Lycos had 1998 sales of $56
million. In general, media companies have moderate to high debt
levels, while Internet companies have no debt. The newly combined
entity is a hybrid in that it will have earnings, unlike may
Internet companies, but will carry no debt.
</P>
<P>
   Though Davis will give up effective control of the company, he
will have a new five year contract and the company will keep its
headquarters in Boston.

 &HT;    American Airlines cancels flights in wake of disagreement with
pilots
 &HT;    By Peter Donald
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ A dispute between American Airlines and
its pilots led to the cancellation of 16 percent of the airline's
flights Monday and stranded some passengers at Palm Beach
International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   The work slowdown started on Saturday, forcing the cancellation
of nearly 100 flights nationally. On Sunday, 240 flights were
cancelled and the number had climbed to 360 by Monday, airline
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   American Airlines spokesman Tim Smith said the company normally
operates about 2,250 flights each day.
</P>
<P>
   By mid-afternoon Monday at PBIA's Gate C9, Dick and Ann Travis
stretched out in chairs near an American ticket counter,
exasperated at their lack of progress since 7:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been trying to get American on the phone since last
night,'' Dick Travis said. ``I've got to get back to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Their 11:15 a.m. flight to New York's LaGuardia Airport was
cancelled, they'd been bumped from alternative flights and they
were hoping to get on a 5:30 p.m. flight.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Waters of the Palm Beach County Department of Airports said
two flights that were supposed to arrive at PBIA Monday morning _
one from LaGuardia and one from Dallas-Fort Worth _ were scrapped.
As a result, two return flights _ Flight 1328 to LaGuardia and
Flight 483 to Dallas-Fort Worth _ were also cancelled. Waters said
that the four cancelled flights had a combined total of 556 seats.
</P>
<P>
   On a normal day, eight American flights leave from PBIA, airline
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   American was trying to place passengers on later flights or
other airlines.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for American Airlines said that 45 of its 188
flights from Miami Monday were called off, as were two of the 15
flights leaving Fort Lauderdale.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute is over American's acquisition of Reno Air Inc. and
how Reno's 300 pilots will be absorbed into the pilot pool at
American. American's parent company, AMR, closed a deal at the end
of 1998 to purchase Reno Air for $124 million.
</P>
<P>
   American's 9,400 pilots are represented by the Allied Pilots
Association, or A.P.A. The union says its contract specifies that
only A.P.A. pilots can fly American planes, and that American is
trying to create an airline within an airline that will effectively
lower pilots' salaries.
</P>
<P>
   Reno pilots _ represented by another union called the Air Line
Pilots Association _ were making half of what their American
counterparts earn, American officials said.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, union and management negotiators broke off their
discussions.
</P>
<P>
   A recorded message by President Rich LaVoy on an A.P.A. hotline
urged pilots not to fly if they don't feel physically or mentally
up to the task.
</P>
<P>
   An American pilot dressed in shorts and a T-shirt who was
picking up a parking permit at PBIA covered his I.D. badge on
Monday and explained that he had the flu. He said the slowdown was
not a strike, but that lots of pilots were calling in sick or not
volunteering to work extra hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's just a lot of unhappiness,'' the pilot said.

 &HT;    Life is forever changed for lucky lottery winners
 &HT;    By Eliot Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIGHTHOUSE POINT, Fla. _ It's tough enough being Broward
County's first female police chief, mother of a 7-year-old, and a
widow too soon.
</P>
<P>
   But Kim Tierney's luck changed suddenly when she and five of her
officers won a $23.6 million piece of a $67 million Lotto jackpot.
</P>
<P>
   The six had one of three winning tickets for Saturday night's
jackpot, the fifth largest in the lottery's 11-year history. The
others were bought in North Miami Beach and Tampa.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll just be easier to get out of bed knowing our bank
accounts are a little more plump,'' Tierney, 43, told reporters
Monday morning at Town Hall as city employees and residents
applauded.
</P>
<P>
   The six: Tierney, with 18 years at the department and chief
since June; Sgt. Jack Vaccaro, Commander Michael Oh, and Detectives
Alan Nestor, Joseph Tavares, and Larry Hawkins. All have worked
there for at least seven years.
</P>
<P>
   The group hasn't decided whether to take annual payments or a
lump sum, but Tierney said she didn't anticipate a squabble. Before
taxes, they could each get $130,000 a year for 30 years _ a total
of $3.9 million each _ or one payment of $1.95 million each.
</P>
<P>
   All said they plan to keep working for the 2.5-square-mile
oceanfront town of about 10,500 east of Pompano Beach, although
some said their spouses might quit their jobs. Nestor said his wife
gave notice Monday at the Boca Raton apartment complex where she's
a leasing manager.
</P>
<P>
   Tierney, 43, now earns about $68,000 a year. But she faced
financial challenges after her husband, Thomas Richow, a detective
sergeant, died of cancer at 41 in August.
</P>
<P>
   After she won, she said, her 7-year-old daughter Ashley asked,
``Can we buy Nintendo instead of renting it?''
</P>
<P>
   Other officers' shopping lists include a new car for Nestor and,
for his 6-year-old, ``The biggest Lego he can get;'' a new pickup
truck for Hawkins, another one for his father, and a new Pontiac
Firebird for his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Tavares said he'd pay off some bills. And Oh: ``I'm going to
Disney World!'' He meant it.
</P>
<P>
   Nestor organized the pool two weeks ago. Each person threw in
$2.
</P>
<P>
   At first, the chief took a pass. Then, she said, she told the
group, ``If you guys win I don't want to be alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Nestor bought 12 tickets last week. The officers said they did
not remember if they picked their own numbers or let the computer
do it. The winning numbers were 4-12-20-32-42-47.
</P>
<P>
   None of the six watched the drawing at 11 p.m. Saturday. Nestor
checked the newspaper Sunday morning. He called Tierney.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't be playing games with me,'' Tierney told Nestor.
</P>
<P>
   Town officers had done pools in the past and hit five of six a
few years ago, and another group of officers had a pool for
Saturday's big drawing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish everyone had won,'' Tierney said. ``It would make
contract negotiations easier.''
</P>

<P>
   OXFORD, England, Dec. 29 _ Iris Murdoch, the celebrated author
of 26 rigorously intellectual novels, stood uncertainly in the
doorway of her living room, her face frozen in the blank expression
that is a sure badge of Alzheimer's disease. It was only when she
saw her husband, the critic, professor and novelist John Bayley,
that a flicker of comprehension sparked in her eyes. But it was
gone, as quickly as it came.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hello, darling,'' Bayley said tenderly, as if speaking to a
beloved child. ``Wouldn't you like to come and sit down?''
</P>
<P>
   It felt at first like a terrible intrusion, being in the house
with the couple. It was unbearably sad to see the once-brilliant
Miss Murdoch, 79, shuffle slowly into the room, sit stiffly and
then do nothing but stare intently ahead. And it was unbearably sad
when Bayley began explaining in his un-self-pitying, slightly
quizzical way what life is like now that Alzheimer's has his wife
firmly in its grasp.
</P>
<P>
   But Bayley and Miss Murdoch, whose relationship began more than
40 years ago when he saw her bicycling past his window in Oxford
and fell instantly in love, have never had an ordinary
relationship. And by the end of a morning with them, it was
impossible not to believe that _ however odd it may seem _ they
have made their peace, and are alone together in a world that
somehow suits them.
</P>
<P>
   Bayley, who at 73 seems like a wholly sweet and slightly
eccentric uncle, dressed in indifferently fitting, indifferently
laundered clothes with a few strands of fluffy white hair flowing
from the back of his otherwise bald head, makes a passionate case
for this view in his new memoir, ``Elegy for Iris.'' The book,
which is being published in the United States by St. Martin's
Press, has drawn glowing reviews, as both a lyric description of
the arc of a singular marriage and as an unflinching account of the
frustrations of Alzheimer's.
</P>
<P>
   There were slight rumblings in the British news media about
Bayley's motives for writing the book. Wasn't it cruel to expose
Miss Murdoch this way, they asked? But Bayley is not embarrassed by
his wife's state, and neither should anyone else be, he said.
``When something like this happens, you lose all sense of shame and
privacy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the beginning, Bayley said, stuttering as he does when he
speaks quickly, he fought and raged against his wife's descent into
unknowingness. But he is past that now, and his anger has given way
to acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life is no longer bringing the pair of us 'closer and closer
apart,' in the poet's tenderly ambiguous words,'' he writes, in a
typically graceful passage. ``There is a certain comic irony _
happily, not darkly comic _ that after more than 40 years of taking
marriage for granted, marriage has decided it is tired of this and
is taking a hand in the game. Purposefully, persistently,
involuntarily, our marriage is now getting somewhere. It is giving
us no choice _ and I am glad of that.''
</P>
<P>
   The book is divided into two parts. The first, ``Then,'' tells
how Bayley, a young and spectacularly unworldly scholar, was
smitten from the moment he glimpsed her. But Miss Murdoch, a
brilliant rising star who was then teaching philosophy at St.
Anne's College, Oxford, proved elusive. When they embraced for the
first time, speaking in a childish shorthand, ``with arms around
each other, kissing and rubbing noses,'' he writes, he began to
understand that she needed him as much as he needed her.
</P>
<P>
   Deciding not to have children, they both went on to have
glittering careers, although Miss Murdoch's was the more public
success. As she was producing novel after novel and being made a
Dame of the British Empire, Bayley was making his own mark, as a
teacher (he retired several years ago as the Warton Professor of
English Literature at Oxford), reviewer and literary critic whose
many books include studies of Thomas Hardy, Jane Austen and Henry
James, as well as four novels. ``Elegy for Iris'' is studded with
literary references _ it is clear that he has found solace in
literature _ but in conversation Bayley is so self-effacing that it
is easy to forget his formidable intellect.
</P>
<P>
   To him and his wife, marriage has always meant a refuge from
alone-ness, a secure haven that allows them their independence
together. In an odd way, Bayley said, this has helped him deal with
the constraints of the present. He looks forward to the end of the
day, when his wife is safely asleep and he can pour himself a drink
and revisit the comforts of one of his favorite books, typically a
well-worn novel by Barbara Pym or Austen.
</P>
<P>
   ``A solitary life is splendid, provided you can lead it with
someone else,'' he said. ``That's paradoxical, but it's extremely
true in our case. We've always had that sort of life; she had her
life, and I had mine. And now one can have that same sort of thing.
I do have that solitary life because she's there, and I couldn't
have it on my own. It would simply disappear.''
</P>
<P>
   Bayley says he would not consider putting Miss Murdoch in a
nursing home unless she became completely unmanageable and no
longer recognized him. She grows agitated when he is away, and he
loses his purpose when he is alone. ``I don't know what to do by
myself when she's not there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now,'' the second part of the book, takes up their story in
the mid-1990's, when the first signs of Alzheimer's manifested
themselves. It is a chilling account. Miss Murdoch cannot find her
words during a question-and-answer session in Israel. She sets off
for London and returns three hours later, having forgotten where
she was going.
</P>
<P>
   She has trouble writing, for the first time ever (the novel she
is working on, ``Jackson's Dilemma,'' turned out to be her last,
and Murdoch aficionados were puzzled by the inconsistencies in
character and plot). Later, when a doctor asks her who the Prime
Minister is, she is stymied. ``She had no idea but said to him with
a smile that surely it didn't matter,'' Bayley writes.
</P>
<P>
   `Very Incurious' About Her Own Life
</P>
<P>
   Mercifully, Miss Murdoch didn't seem aware of what was happening
and didn't rebel against it, partly because she never had much of a
sense of self, anyway, Bayley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She didn't have a great deal of consciousness of her own,'' he
said. ``Coleridge mentioned the distinction between writers who
live entirely in their selves and writers like Shakespeare who seem
to live a complex external life inside their creations. Iris was
like that. She was extremely sociable and liked to hear about other
people's lives, but she was very incurious about her own.''
</P>
<P>
   When Bayley finished the book a year ago, Miss Murdoch could
have occasional conversations. Very rarely, she still shows
flickers of her old self, but her condition is much worse now. He
has to lock the front door so she won't wander down the street. He
can't take her swimming in the river they have always loved, for
fear that she will suddenly forget how. One of the high points of
their days together is when ``Teletubbies,'' a children's
television show, comes on.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Murdoch is like ``a very nice 3-year-old,'' her husband
says, and she needs to be fed, bathed and changed. And there is the
constant strain of meals to be prepared, of dishes to be done, of a
house to keep clean. The couple have always been careless
housekeepers, at best, and now Bayley admits that he has all but
given up. Indeed, their house is shockingly untidy. Coats are piled
high on the kitchen floor, dirty dishes cover the breakfast table,
and the living room is a hodgepodge of books, old coffee cups,
plants in various stages of decrepitude and what looks like a
lifetime's worth of detritus.
</P>
<P>
   But friends say that Bayley is a classically eccentric Oxford
don, one of a breed who have always been famously indifferent to
their surroundings. And Bayley is adamant that he doesn't want, or
need, any help.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I would get fussed and bothered if someone came and
did it,'' he said. ``For one thing, they'd want to do it according
to much higher standards.'' He chuckled. ``I really don't see any
point in trying to clear it all up.''
</P>
<P>
   `It's Partly A Good Thing'
</P>
<P>
   Strangely enough, Bayley said, he feels the Iris of today _ the
shuffling, uncomprehending Iris _ is the same Iris he knew before,
the one of the sparkling conversation and the endlessly questioning
mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel it's not only the same person, but it's always been the
same person,'' he explained. ``Though I have a very good memory _ I
can remember where we went and what we did _ I can't remember the
feel of it, you see, the sensation of a person who was completely
normal. It's partly a good thing, because she seems perfectly
normal to me at present.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in their long life together, he says, they
are completely entwined, entirely symbiotic. It is a sensation he
relishes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day, we are physically closer,'' Bayley writes in
``Elegy for Iris. ``And Iris's little 'mouse cry,' as I think of
it, signifying loneliness in the next room, the wish to be back
beside me, seems less and less forlorn, more simple, more natural.
She is not sailing into the dark. The voyage is over, and under the
dark escort of Alzheimer's, she has arrived somewhere. So have I.''
</P>
<P>
   What does he mean? He tries to explain, as a visitor gets up to
leave and is rewarded by the sudden, sweet flash of a smile across
Miss Murdoch's face and a delighted mumble during a goodbye
embrace. ``You feel that they can't do anything else to you, so to
speak,'' he explained. ``It's a loss of fear.''

 &HT;    Gift makes Norton 'a force in photography'
 &HT;    By Gary Schwan
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Palm Beach Post Art Writer
</P>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ When Christina Orr-Cahall was curator at
the Norton Museum of Art in the '70s, she asked the board for
$100,000 to acquire photography.
</P>
<P>
   She was turned down. Two decades later, she's the Norton's
director and just got her photographs _ for free.
</P>
<P>
   Norton officials announced Monday the gift of 670 photographs
from Jeane Wahl von Oppenheim, a German baroness who winters in
Palm Beach, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   The donation more than quadruples the museum's collection of
roughly 150 images.
</P>
<P>
   Calling the collection one of the leading in Europe, Orr-Cahall
said the gift ``catapults the Norton into a force in the field of
photography.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials declined to reveal the collection's appraised value.
</P>
<P>
   The Norton plans to organize an exhibition for late next year,
and then send it to other museums. They also plan to publish a book
of the pictures.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly two-thirds of the works are by European photographers,
and the rest by Americans. Noted artists include Berenice Abbot,
Henri Cartier-Bresson, Walker Evans, Man Ray, Edward Steichen,
Robert Mapplethorpe and Andre Kertesz. The earliest photos date
from the 1890s.
</P>
<P>
   The collection also includes works by Germans better known as
painters or conceptual artists, such as Joseph Beuys, Sigmar Polke
and Gerhard Richter. Von Oppenheim is an American who married Baron
Alfred von Oppenheim in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   Trained in art history, she said she began ``accumulating''
photographs at antiquarian bookshops and flea markets in Europe,
refining her taste and befriending many artists.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority
leader, came out on Monday against opening the Senate's final
deliberations over the charges against President Clinton, virtually
guaranteeing that senators' speeches in the climactic hours of the
trial will be made behind closed doors.
</P>
<P>
   Even before Lott's spokesman, John Czwartacki, announced the
majority leader's position Monday afternoon, proponents of an open
debate acknowledged they were more than a half-dozen votes short of
the 67 they needed to amend Senate impeachment rules, which call
for closed deliberations.
</P>
<P>
   They said they had hoped to draw some undecided Republicans to
their side, but Lott's stance made this highly unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   The vast majority of Democrats support opening the
deliberations, which are expected to begin on Tuesday and last for
two to three days. Most Republicans favor keeping the discussion
closed, and many say they see no reason to let Democrats use oral
condemnations of the president to reduce the political risk of
voting to acquit.
</P>
<P>
   A similar political motive was in play as the effort to reach
agreement on a strong censure resolution faltered. Some Republicans
assailed it as an effort to find political cover, and their threats
of a filibuster and other procedural complications became clearer,
even as the number of senators expressing support for a censure
resolution seemed to grow.
</P>
<P>
   Czwartacki said Lott had decided to oppose opening the
deliberations because he wanted the Senate to adhere to
longstanding rules governing impeachment trials and to an even
longer tradition of allowing juries to hash out the facts _ and
their feelings about them _ in private.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lott has fought to keep as much of this trial in the open as
possible,'' Czwartacki said. ``But now he feels that the Senate
must act like any jury.''
</P>
<P>
   Several Democrats, however, said the Senate is not like a real
jury, a viewpoint that resurrected previous arguments over the
precise roles that senators, as both triers of fact and elected
officials entrusted to safeguard the nation's interests, are
supposed to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't been sequestered in the Hilton Hotel for the last
month and a half,'' said Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn. ``It's kind
of a false argument that we are a jury and these are
deliberations.''
</P>
<P>
   The next phase of the trial, whether open or not, is not
expected to be a free-wheeling, informal back-and-forth between a
panel of peers sifting through the evidence and searching their own
souls. It will probably take the form of a series of formal
speeches, limited to 15 minutes apiece, in which senators state
their views and foreshadow how they will vote on the two articles
of impeachment: perjury and obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   The final phase _ in which senators cast those votes without
explanation _ will be open to public view.
</P>
<P>
   As the dispute between Republicans and Democrats over
deliberations heated up in the last few days, it was fueled in part
by pure political gamesmanship.
</P>
<P>
   By seeking to open the deliberations, Democrats were looking for
a way to make sure they had a public forum for stating their
disapproval of Clinton's actions while voting against convicting
and removing him from office.
</P>
<P>
   By seeking to keep the discussion closed, Republicans were
trying to thwart that effort and to prevent Democrats from using
the deliberations for a public attack on the House managers and
their case.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans were far from unified in their views on the
deliberations. One of the most vocal and persistent advocates for
opening the discussion was a Republican, Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison
of Texas, who maintained that the trial was simply too important to
be concluded in secrecy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is historic,'' Mrs. Hutchison said on Monday after
leaving a two-hour Republican caucus devoted almost entirely to a
discussion of the issue. ``I cannot imagine that we would impeach
or not impeach the president of the United States in a closed
session.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Hutchison said she had suggested that the maximum time
allotted for each senator's remarks by reduced to 5 or 10 minutes
from 15. This proposal was intended to allay the concerns of some
fellow Republicans that open deliberations would prolong the
proceeding because senators would try to maximize their time in the
spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   But she said that, according to her arithmetic, she still had
just 60 supporters in all. Because opening the debate would require
suspending Senate rules, a two-thirds majority, or 67 senators,
would have to vote for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's going to be a high hurdle,'' Mrs. Hutchison said.
</P>
<P>
   Twice during the Senate impeachment trial, senators have moved
to open debates over procedural motions, and twice they have
failed, with most Republicans favoring closed sessions and most
Democrats favoring open ones.
</P>
<P>
   Several Republicans said on Monday that it was partly because
those closed sessions were so productive _ and so free of the
posturing and preening that occur when reporters and television
cameras are in attendance _ that they did not want to open this
final phase. They also noted that opening it would violate
tradition and create a new precedent.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``What I want to do is maintain the sanctity of the interplay
and the discussion,'' said Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats and some Republicans like Mrs. Hutchison said most
senators, if not all, know how they are going to vote, so the
remarks they make are less important for each other than for the
public.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., noted the cynicism that many Americans
feel about government and said that keeping the discussion closed
``is going to feed the fires of frustration.''
</P>
<P>
   To address many senators' concerns that a closed debate would
leave the formal trial record bereft of explanations about
lawmakers' reasons for their votes, senators suggested a variety of
remedies.
</P>
<P>
   Some senators said they were studying the possibility of a vote,
after the verdict, about making the transcript of their
deliberations public.
</P>
<P>
   Alternately, Czwartacki said that Lott would make a motion,
probably immediately after senators vote, to allow them to submit
written explanations of their decisions to be put into the trial
record. Similar explanations were published after the Senate voted
to acquit Andrew Johnson in 1868.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOCHINVER, Scotland _ ``Haste ye back,'' the road signs say as
you pass by the stony villages along this coast where the grass is
bent sideways by the ceaseless wind. But the hearty Scots summons
has rung hollow for many people from here for centuries.
</P>
<P>
   This wilderness area was where hundreds of thousands of settlers
were driven off their properties to make way for profitable sheep
farming by rapacious landlords in the infamous Highland
``clearances.''
</P>
<P>
   They were burned out of their thatched cottages and off their
fields, and packed onto ships bound for the colonies or forced into
servitude under Scotland's medieval feudal land-owning system on
small patches of land called crofts along the infertile rocky
seaside.
</P>
<P>
   Although these convulsive events happened in the early part of
the 19th century, for the descendants who still live on this
unforgiving land they are as fresh as yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aye, it's a deeply ingrained feeling here, you must never lose
sight of that,'' said Allan MacRae, 59, whose great-grandfather was
among those evicted. ``There is a deeply rooted resentment.''
</P>
<P>
   Jumbles of piled rocks called cairns are all that remain of the
cottages of the displaced, but the feudal land-owning system is
more than a memory. It still exists.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was set up in the 12th century to impose some order on, you
know, the mad Scots, and it has not changed since,'' said Daniel
Morgan, a doctoral student of the subject at Edinburgh University.
</P>
<P>
   Now, 900 years later, change is being proposed. Scotland gets a
new Parliament in May, and Donald Dewar, Britain's secretary for
Scotland, announced in January that its first order of business
would be reforming the ancient land-holding structure.
</P>
<P>
   On his mind as he spoke was a community of 13 hamlets next to
Lochinver that six years ago bought itself from its owner, a
Swedish businessman, and set up its own cooperative
self-government. It is called the Assynt Crofters' Trust, named
after the loch that runs along one side of the 178-square-mile
estate and the hardscrabble farmers who have become at once
individual tenants and collective shareholding landlords, or
lairds.
</P>
<P>
   Half of Scottish land in private hands belongs to just 350
people, and 1,500 private estates account for 80 percent of the
country. Among the lairds are aristocrats, reclusive foreign
investors, pop stars, offshore companies and wealthy people from
London's financial sector who live distant from Scotland and treat
their properties as commodities to be traded on foreign markets or
use them as hunting and fishing retreats.
</P>
<P>
   For generations, residents have had their land sold out from
under them with no knowledge of the transaction or the new laird to
whom they owe their feus, or land fees. Some cottage dwellers
recognize their absentee owner only by his bank account number.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty years ago Assynt ended up being the wedding present of an
English duke to his son-in-law. The Knoydart peninsula, south of
here, typically has had seven lairds in 50 years, among them a Nazi
sympathizer, an English businessman jailed for fraud, the head of
an English soccer team, and a condominium developer from the London
suburbs. James Hunter, an author of books on Highland culture,
said, ``We're alone in Europe in giving local communities virtually
no say in how land is used.''
</P>
<P>
   Between 1811 and 1823, more than 15,000 people were driven from
their homes in Assynt and surrounding areas. ``Where today there
are vast areas without a single human inhabitant, 200 years ago,
every strath and glen was home to many families,'' said John
MacKenzie, 61, an Assynt leader, using the Scottish words for river
and mountain valleys.
</P>
<P>
   The land the Assynt crofters now own is desolately beautiful,
with hillsides of mossy green peat sweeping down through seaside
mists to cliffsides and crescents of dark sand beaches. The gray
sea is choppy from the never ceasing blustery wind, and rain and
snow career across the shoreline at a slant. There is water
everywhere, cascading down the rock faces, burbling through the
boggy pasture land in ``burns,'' or brooks, or lying serenely in
the 70 lochs on the estate.
</P>
<P>
   Wet and acidic, with its topsoil blown away by the salty winds,
the ground is despairing to farm. ``It's broken land, marginal
land, poor land,'' said MacRae, who raises 20 Highland cattle on
his croft and works a second job unloading hefty deep-water fish
from trawlers in Lochinver harbor. ``You can't live off of crofting
alone,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plans laid out by Dewar, local communities would gain
the right to buy estates at market value and be able to tap
National Lottery money to help raise the purchase price. In cases
where lairds tried to sell land secretly, through share dealing,
for example, or consistently disregarded the interests of the local
people, the government could make the purchase by the community
compulsory.
</P>
<P>
   Crofters in Scotland gained secure tenure of their land by law
in 1886 and they improved their lot with amendments in 1974, but
they are still blocked by their lairds from building on their own
properties or developing common resources like fishing, game,
woodlands, tourism, mineral rights or hydroelectric power that
would help remote communities survive. ``This land can't depend on
agriculture alone,'' MacRae said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, the Assynt crofters learned they were for sale when
they noticed a number of low-level flyovers by prospective buyers
in small aircraft. They found out that their Swedish owner had gone
bankrupt and was trying to maximize his profit by dividing them
into seven parcels. They also discovered to their irritation that
the sale brochure portrayed the estate as a wild place ``that
serves to emphasize that man himself is perhaps the alien element
in the landscape.''
</P>
<P>
   To fight back, they had to overcome generations of supine
acceptance of outside control. ``When we suggested buying the land
ourselves, people thought it was ridiculous and far-fetched,'' said
Aileen Kinnaird, now the trust's secretary. ``Everybody accepted
the old way.''
</P>
<P>
   The trust was formed with MacRae as its chairman, and a
fund-raising campaign drew support from sympathizers around
Scotland and from descendants abroad of people chased off the land
180 years ago. The Assynt Crofters Trust collected the necessary
$500,000, and on Feb. 1, 1993, took possession.
</P>
<P>
   Listing the trust's accomplishments during the last six years,
MacKenzie mentioned a survey of housing needs, woodlands projects
to reforest the denuded land, a computerized environmental
management project, the stocking of lochs with brown trout, and a
new contract for a micro hydroelectric project that will feed power
into the national grid.
</P>
<P>
   The living-room window of his house on a promontory at Culkein
overlooks the slate waters of Clashnessie Bay and a hillside cairn
left by family members forced to the edge of the sea by the
clearances.
</P>
<P>
   Staring at the site, he said: ``We have, I believe, here in
Assynt, changed the perception and the course of land tenure in the
Highlands of Scotland forevermore.''

MAN PURSUED BY IRS WINS $75,000 TO PAY HIS LAWYER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Okla.)  (mk) 
 By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two years ago, the government indicted Richard Gardner on 21
counts of tax and bankruptcy fraud, after a raid in which armed
agents of the IRS seized all the computers and files at his
income-tax preparation business in Tulsa, Okla.
</P>
<P>
   But in January of last year, the Justice Department withdrew the
charges, which Gardner described as ``unlawful actions designed to
punish me for having the temerity to exercise my constitutional
rights'' as a way of delaying payment of back taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Now Gardner has become the first person to have his legal
defense fees paid by the Justice Department under a 1997 law
intended to curb prosecutions that are ``vexatious, frivolous or in
bad faith.'' Without admitting wrongdoing, the department last week
paid $75,000 to Gardner's lawyer, R. Thomas Seymour, for the cost
of the case. The two men had sought $102,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Gardner case was extraordinary because once an indictment is
handed up in a tax matter, the Justice Department routinely insists
on either going to trial or obtaining a guilty plea to at least one
charge. Elliot Kajan, a prominent criminal tax lawyer in Beverly
Hills, Calif., said that ``there must have been other cases in
which all charges were withdrawn in a tax case, but it is so rare
that I have never heard of them.''
</P>
<P>
   The payment for Gardner followed a finding in his favor last
July by Judge Sven Erik Holmes of the U.S. District Court in Tulsa.
Ruling on the effort to show that the prosecution had been
frivolous, Holmes held that given the withdrawal of all charges,
Gardner had ``prevailed.''
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department then began negotiating how much it would
pay under the 1997 law, which expanded to frivolous criminal
prosecutions the provisions of the Equal Access to Justice Act that
already applied to civil cases.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department officials had no comment Monday. The IRS,
whose discussion of tax cases is limited by law, also declined to
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Gardner is the sixth-largest income-tax preparer in Oklahoma and
also runs a store selling used books and comics. By his own
account, he was chronically late turning over income and Social
Security taxes withheld from the paychecks of his seven employees.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1994, court records show, an IRS collection agent
demanded $20,000 that was overdue. Gardner said he would pay in a
few weeks, after receiving expected payments from clients. The
collection agent, the court records show, then threatened a
``jeopardy assessment,'' in which cash, bank accounts and property
can be seized. Gardner replied that he could place his two
businesses in bankruptcy, which would stall the IRS collection
efforts for 90 days.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later Gardner did indeed place his two businesses in
bankruptcy. Only days after that, he paid the overdue taxes and
canceled the bankruptcy actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The local IRS officials,'' said his lawyer, Seymour, ``took
this lawful, routine business action, this exercising of a
constitutional right, as a personal affront and set out to destroy
Richard's business.''
</P>
<P>
   In March 1995, armed agents raided Gardner's tax preparation
office, seizing records as clients scattered. That night, Gardner
said, he bought new computers, and the next morning was back in
business when Bob Walter, an IRS criminal agent, telephoned.
According to court records, Walter said: ``I'm surprised you're
open. We thought we'd put you out of business.''
</P>
<P>
   Gardner says two things have changed since the raid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not late paying my taxes anymore,'' he said. ``And my
business is doing better than ever, because my customers stood by
me and told others about me.''

`SHOOTING STARS: THE PAPARAZZI': SYMBIOSIS YES, LOVE NO 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Broadcast notes are at end of review. Time and station are

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If the creators of ``Shooting Stars: The Paparazzi'' set out to
present their subjects as a bunch of tiresome whiners, they
succeeded. Tuesday night's installment of ``Inside Story'' on A&AMP;E
follows three of New York's celebrity photographers as they mix
street talk and street stalk. The stentorian voice-of-history
narration by Bill Kurtis, contrasting so dramatically with the
photographer's own self-serving gripes, gives the hour a
tongue-in-cheek air that may be unintended but is certainly
entertaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day is a fight for access to stars who shun them to get
pictures for a public that hates them,'' Kurtis intones. But then
the paparazzi hate the public, too. They hate security guards,
public relations people and the drivers who clog Manhattan streets.
They're not too crazy about one another, and they're at best
ambivalent about the big-name entertainers they pursue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The average person only gets to see a celebrity on TV or in a
movie,'' says R.J. Capak, one of the program's featured
photographers. ``I get to see them in real life.'' If hanging
around for hours outside some club or ballroom is your idea of real
life. All that waiting gives a guy time to think. And Capak has
come to the conclusion that the stars are ``no better than us,''
and that ``they're not gods.'' He adds, ``The only thing I see
above their heads is dollar signs.''
</P>
<P>
   Kurtis adds the numbers after the dollar signs. One of the
paparazzi's pictures can bring $100 to $100,000, ``for a scandalous
photo of a top star.'' That kind of golden image is neither shown
nor described.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Capak, the documentary trains its own camera
primarily on David Allocca, a self-described ``inside guy'' who is
hired by publicity agents to shoot premieres, parties and other
events, and Steve Sands, another dedicated outsider who fiercely
jostles for space just beyond the police barricades. ``I used to be
in it for the art,'' Sands says.
</P>
<P>
   These three professionals and a lynch mob of their peers descend
on the premiere of the film ``Celebrity,'' where they capture the
likes of Kenneth Branagh, Lauren Bacall, Wynona Ryder and Uma
Thurman. But their prime objective is Leonardo DiCaprio, who is
notoriously uncooperative.
</P>
<P>
   A few days before, Capak says, he was attacked by members of
``Leonardo DiCaprio's posse,'' who took his camera so he could not
shoot the actor. This time, Capak says, ``we're going to hunt him
down like the dog he is.''
</P>
<P>
   Will the poor, abused photographers get the kind of thrilling
pictures of DiCaprio that will win them big checks from People
magazine? If not this time, they'll keep trying. That's what they
do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a thinking person wouldn't do this,'' says Sands. You
think so?

 house managers make their last stand 
(For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Facing imminent defeat, President Clinton's
accusers Monday made their last stand in the impeachment trial,
clamoring in their closing arguments for the Senate to summon the
``political courage'' to defy overwhelming public opinion and oust
Clinton from office.
</P>
<P>
   The House Republican managers, portrayed by one of their number
as ``13 angry men,'' unloaded bursts of frustration, indignation,
and resignation as they pleaded with senators to convict Clinton on
two articles of impeachment arising from his affair with Monica S.
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The three-hour appeal, and a summation by White House lawyers,
cleared the way for the Senate to begin deliberating Tuesday
whether Clinton should suffer the disgrace of being the first
president removed from office for ``high crimes and misdemeanors.''
</P>
<P>
   The deliberations are expected to last until Thursday, when the
Senate is tentatively scheduled to cast the first impeachment votes
on a president since 1868.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no denying the fact that what you decide will have a
profound effect on our culture as well as our politics,'' said
Representative Henry J. Hyde of Illinois, the lead manager, in the
House team's last words in the monthlong trial.
</P>
<P>
   In a scathing denunciation of Clinton's actions, Hyde said the
impeachment has become the main battlefield in a national struggle
over respect for the law and morality. Clinton is charged with
lying under oath to a federal grand jury and obstructing justice to
cover up his affair with Lewinsky and thwart a sexual harassment
lawsuit filed against him by Paula Corbin Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wonder if, after this culture war is over that we're engaged
in, an America will survive that is worth fighting to defend,''
said Hyde, who was representing at least 211 House colleagues who
had voted for one or both of the impeachment charges.
</P>
<P>
   White House counsel Charles F. C. Ruff assailed the closing
statements by the House managers as the last blow of a partisan
attack aimed at undoing the 1996 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe their vision to be too dark, too little attuned to
the needs of the people, too little sensitive to the needs of our
democracy,'' Ruff said of the managers. ``I believe it to be a
vision more focused on retribution, more designed to achieve
partisan ends, more uncaring about the future we face together.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost every senator has indicated that Clinton is likely to be
cleared of the impeachment charges when the final roll is called. A
two-thirds majority, or 67 votes, is required to convict a
president, and each article may receive as little as a simple
majority, or 51 votes.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of the Senate deliberations, prospects for opening
the session to public scrutiny diminished Monday, as the Senate
majority leader, Trent Lott, announced his opposition to open
deliberations. Longtime impeachment rules call for each senator to
speak up to 15 minutes behind closed doors during the
deliberations, although Lott and the Senate minority leader, Thomas
A. Daschle, were poised to recommend reducing each senator's time
to 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   At that rate, the deliberations would end by Thursday, setting
up a final vote the same day, and leaving Friday for a possible
debate on a censure resolution, whose outcome remains highly
uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   The House managers, defiant to the end, asked the Senate to
pursue new evidence in the case by authorizing subpoenas to
determine if White House adviser Sidney Blumenthal lied under oath
last week when he denied spreading to the news media a Clinton
assertion that Lewinsky was a ``stalker.''
</P>
<P>
   In affidavits last week, two journalists, Christopher Hitchens,
and his wife, Carol Blue, said Blumenthal related the ``stalker''
reference several times to them last year in describing Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde, in a letter to Lott and Daschle, asserted that if
Blumenthal lied about the ``stalker'' allegation, ``it would reveal
that the White House as an institution may have been used by the
president to obstruct justice for his legal and political
benefit.'' He continued, ``We hope that you do not choose to ignore
this important information.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott made a motion before the closing arguments began Monday to
permit the affidavits to be submitted into the trial record. But
the rules required Lott to obtain unanimous consent, and Daschle
objected.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there was little bipartisan agreement during the
session, as one House manager after another unleashed parting shots
at Clinton, and Ruff returned the fire.
</P>
<P>
   The arguments unfolded five months after the independent
counsel, Kenneth W. Starr, effectively began the impeachment
process by delivering to Congress the results of his eight-month
investigation into the Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is still the truth and a lie is still a lie, and the
rule of law should apply to everyone,'' said Representative F.
James Sensenbrenner Jr. of Wisconsin, one of the managers.
``Senators, don't be fooled by the president's excuses and spin
control.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as they spoke, however, the managers acknowledged the
futility of the exercise. Launching an early autopsy on their
expected defeat, some managers criticized the Senate for
restricting their ability to present their case. Others blamed
public cynicism, the news media, raw partisanship, and other
factors.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde said the managers had endured ``the media condemnations,
the patronizing editorials, the hate mail, the insults hurled in
public, the attempts at intimidation, the death threats, and even
the disapproval of our colleagues, which cuts the worst.''
</P>
<P>
   A few managers questioned the character of the senators
themselves, as Representative Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas invoked
President John F. Kennedy's book, ``Profiles in Courage,'' and
Representative Bob Barr of Georgia sought to put the senators'
characters in question.
</P>
<P>
   Barr said the final impeachment votes ``will tell us in this
nation whether these seats in this chamber will continue to be
occupied by true statesmen.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyde also had harsh words for Clinton's lawyers. ``This entire
saga has been a theater of distraction and misdirection,
time-honored defense tactics when the law and the facts get in the
way,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ruff lashed back, countering the managers' assertion that the
White House had presented a ``so-what'' defense, that the charges
were not serious enough to warrant an impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to see so-what in action, look elsewhere,'' Ruff
said. ``So what if the House Judiciary Committee didn't quite do
their constitutional job if they took the independent counsel's
referral and added a few frills and washed their hands of it. So
what if the House approved articles that wouldn't pass muster in
any court in the land. So what if the managers have been creating
their own theories of impeachment as they go along.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyde also blasted the censure initiative as a weak alternative
to convicting Clinton. ``Do you really cleanse the office as
provided in the Constitution, or do you use the Air Wick of a
censure resolution?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Several Republican senators praised Hyde's speech as a powerful
final chapter of the House presentation. ``I've been a censure
supporter, and I agree that Hyde's comments didn't help us,'' said
Senator John H. Chafee, a Rhode Island Republican.

FOLLOWING TRADITION, FUNERAL WAS AN AFFAIR FOR MEN ONLY
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   AMMAN, Jordan _ The funeral of King Hussein on Monday was almost
entirely a male affair, in keeping with what the royal palace
called an Arab Muslim tradition that mourning occasions be
segregated by sex.
</P>
<P>
   The tradition is followed rigorously in Jordan, which behind its
pro-Western image is a deeply conservative Arab society. It meant
that Queen Noor, widow to the late king, stayed at home, with other
female relatives, to accept condolences from female visitors,
including Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said in Washington that
she had stayed away from the funeral in deference to Muslim
traditions.
</P>
<P>
   Some women did break with the tradition by paying last respects
to the king, as his body lay in state at Raghadan Palace. They
included Rima Khalaf, a member of the Jordanian senate who had been
invited in that capacity, and Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands and
President Mary McAleese of Ireland, in their capacities as heads of
state.
</P>
<P>
   At least two other women filed past the king's body, but they
could not be identified.
</P>
<P>
   A palace official said women had not been barred from paying of
respects, but had been encouraged to respect Jordan's traditions.
Heads of state were an exception, a protocol official said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, no women were seen later at the king's gravesite, in
apparent deference to the tradition that burials in particular are
moments so weighty that they should be single-sex affairs. The
tradition is rooted in Muslim teachings that discourage the mixing
of unrelated men and women. Even Arab Muslims who ordinarily attend
mixed-sex gatherings say they draw the line at funerals, on the
ground that it would be unwise at such an occasion to give offense
to God.
</P>
<P>
   Once a man is buried, the established practice in Jordan is that
women should visit his grave separately, usually the day after the
funeral.
</P>
<P>
   A royal palace official said that Queen Noor and the king's
daughters would probably visit his grave for the first time on
Tuesday.

CLINTON LAUDS KING HUSSEIN AS MAN OF VISION AND SPIRIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (See related stories: JORDAN-FUNERAL, JORDAN-SCENE,
JORDAN-PALESTINIANS)

<P>
   AMMAN, Jordan _ President Clinton came here Monday to bury King
Hussein of Jordan and to praise his son Abdullah, the new king.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton led an American delegation including three former
presidents to this grieving and gloomy capital. He met briefly with
King Abdullah Monday evening in the king's office at the Raghadan
Palace after his father was buried.
</P>
<P>
   The president offered American moral and financial support as
the new king begins his reign facing domestic economic trouble and
recurrent strains in efforts to fashion a lasting Middle Eastern
peace.
</P>
<P>
   The president and Hillary Rodham Clinton also paid a condolence
call on King Hussein's widow, the American-born Queen Noor, before
returning to Washington late Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spoke in public only once Monday, delivering brief
remarks to American Embassy employees Monday evening at a local
hotel. He said of King Hussein: ``He really was driven not by the
title he had, but by the responsibilities it bore. And he was
ennobled not by the title, but by the strength of his own character
and his vision and his spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton described the new king as embodying the strength and
humility of his father. And he spoke of King Abdullah's commitment
to domestic development and regional peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``He clearly understands his mission,'' Clinton said. ``He said
in the most moving way: `I and all of my brothers and sisters have
absorbed our father's teaching. We know what we are supposed to do,
and I intend to do it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Former presidents Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter and George Bush
accompanied Clinton aboard Air Force One to pay their respects. The
four presidents filed into the throne room of the Raghadan Palace
just after 2 p.m. and paused in tribute for about seven seconds
before Hussein's coffin.
</P>
<P>
   Kings and queens, presidents and prime ministers flew into Amman
Monday in a dramatic display of respect for the late king. Israeli
and Syrian leaders came to the same place for the same purpose for
the first time in memory, senior American officials said. Iran and
Libya sent delegations, as did Iraq and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Carter said, ``I don't think I have ever seen a greater
outpouring of the world's appreciation and the world's love for a
human being than I've seen today.''
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli delegation, led by President Ezer Weizman and Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, was itself a study in how the death of
one man can serve, for a day at least, as a unifying force: all
major factions of Israeli politics were represented.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could hardly believe my eyes,'' Clinton said with a laugh,
describing the Israeli entourage. ``All the candidates for prime
minister were there. They were all walking together. I don't know
if they talk at home, but they were all talking here. I thought it
was as if Hussein was hugging them all, you know?
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really a beautiful sight: people coming from all around
the world, countries that are at each other's throats, here meeting
in peace and friendship and the sanctity of the umbrella of this
great man.''
</P>
<P>
   The presence of the current and former American presidents was
intended as ``an extremely strong statement to the people of Jordan
that America stands with them during this difficult period,'' said
Samuel R. Berger, Clinton's national security adviser.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the fact that three of the four former presidents
chose to come here,'' Berger said, ``and that four American
presidents will be standing together should be a powerful statement
to the Jordanian people about how strongly we feel about the
relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Also in the American delegation were two senators, Ted Stevens,
R-Alaska, and Patrick J. Leahy, D-Vt. In Washington Monday, the
rest of the Senate heard closing arguments in the impeachment trial
of the president.
</P>
<P>
   Leahy said the king's funeral provided a welcome relief from the
trial, now entering its fifth week of detailed and redundant
testimony. ``I was so tired of that trial,'' Leahy said.
</P>
<P>
   The president's party also included two House members, Benjamin
A. Gilman, R-N.Y., and David E. Bonior, D-Mich.
</P>
<P>
   Najeeb and Doris Halaby, Queen Noor's parents, also traveled
with the president.
</P>
<P>
   The funeral provided an occasion for Clinton to meet briefly
with a rare gathering of world leaders, including Netanyahu, Yasser
Arafat, the Palestinian leader, and President Hafez Assad of Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the meetings had been brief and had not involved
extended substantive discussions of the stalled Middle East peace
negotiations. But in each, Clinton asked that Jordan's neighbors
provide help during a time of transition, Berger said.
</P>
<P>
   To Assad, the president said: ``I'm glad you're here. I hope
you'll help Jordan,'' Berger said. Assad replied enigmatically,
according to Berger: ``He sort of said yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also greeted Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain,
President Jacques Chirac of France, Queen Beatrix of the
Netherlands, Crown Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia, President Hosni
Mubarak of Egypt, King Juan Carlos of Spain, Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder of Germany and Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi of Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also met briefly with President Boris Yeltsin of Russia,
whom American officials had not expected to attend the funeral
because of failing health. Yeltsin needed assistance to climb the
stairs of the palace where Hussein's body lay in state before
burial and left quickly, accompanied by aides who appeared to be
carrying bags of medical equipment.
</P>
<P>
   But Yeltsin rose when Clinton approached him, bellowing, ``Bill
Clinton!'' presidential aides said. He embraced Clinton, but
without the bearlike strength of heartier times.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's obviously very ill,'' a senior American official said.
</P>
<P>
   Berger said the president was confident that King Abdullah would
remain engaged in the Arab-Israeli peace negotiations, even as he
tries to consolidate his power and address serious domestic
economic issues.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spent considerable time with his predecessors, both on
Air Force One and during the daylong funeral observances. Aides
said the four men had spoken for 90 minutes aboard the aircraft,
sharing reminiscences about King Hussein and discussing the Middle
East, Kosovo and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Aides said the subject of Clinton's impeachment trial had not
come up.

INQUIRY INTO POLICE SHOOTING DRAWS THE GAZE OF GUINEA 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By KEVIN FLYNN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As friends and family made funeral arrangements on
Monday for an unarmed street peddler shot dead by New York City
police, a diplomat from the victim's homeland of Guinea in West
Africa said his countrymen were concerned that the four officers
involved had not been arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Aboubacar Dione, the first consul of Guinea's permanent mission
to the United Nations, said the police shooting of Amadou Diallo,
who was killed Thursday in a barrage of 41 bullets, has drawn
considerable attention in his country, a nation beset by desperate
poverty and convulsed by eight months of civil war.
</P>
<P>
   ``People back home _ the entire African continent _ is following
this case. They don't understand why these four are still free,''
Dione said at the mission's four-story town house on East 39th
Street. As he spoke, he received a call from Guinea's minister of
foreign affairs, one of many he said he gets about the case each
morning from officials in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Dione said Guinean officials hope that justice will be done in
the case, which has led critics of the Police Department to
question whether New York's much-lauded crackdown on crime has
created a climate that fosters police brutality.
</P>
<P>
   To reassure Diallo's family, the Bronx district attorney, Robert
Johnson, met Monday afternoon for 30 minutes with six of the dead
man's relatives and friends, including his uncle, Mamadou Diallo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very good meeting,'' said Kyle Watters, a lawyer for
the Diallo family. ``The district attorney assured us he was doing
everything he can to see that justice is done. He told us that an
investigation was going forward and that they were interviewing
potential witnesses today.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's office is expected to begin presenting evidence and
witnesses to a grand jury later this week. Since there were
apparently no eyewitnesses, aside from the four officers,
prosecutors are likely to begin any presentation with a series of
witnesses who would establish the broad circumstances of Diallo's
death, such as the fact that he was hit by 19 of the bullets fired
at him as he stood unarmed in the vestibule of his Bronx apartment
building.
</P>
<P>
   The officers, who were searching for a rape suspect, have not
spoken to investigators. But their lawyer, Stephen Worth, has said
they thought Diallo had a gun.
</P>
<P>
   Worth has said he will probably allow the officers _ Edward
McMellon, 26, Sean Carroll, 35, Kenneth Boss, 27, and Richard
Murphy, 26 _ to testify without immunity before a grand jury if
certain conditions are met. As of Monday, he said, he had not begun
those negotiations with prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Diallo's father and mother were scheduled to arrive in New York
on Tuesday, and the family is planning to hold a memorial prayer
service on Friday at the Islamic Cultural Center of New York on
East 96th Street. The family is then expected to arrange to fly the
body of Diallo home to Guinea, which he left for New York two years
ago. Before leaving, the family is expected to meet with Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani, according to city officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one wants to lose a child,'' Giuliani said at a news
conference Monday, ``and the idea of even talking to the father and
talking to him about his losing his son in a foreign country is a
terrible, terrible thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Preparations were also being made for a rally at noon Tuesday
outside U.S. District Court in Manhattan. A rally was held Sunday
outside the Wheeler Avenue apartment building where Diallo, 22, was
killed.
</P>
<P>
   The four officers involved in the case have been removed from
patrol but three returned to administrative assignments Monday,
according to their lawyer. The fourth called in sick, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor spent two hours at City Hall Monday with members of
the United African Congress, his second meeting in as many days
with representatives of New York's West Africans. Giuliani told
reporters later that he had tried to explain the slow pace of
careful justice. ``Investigations, as you know, take longer than
anybody expects,'' he said. The mayor urged all parties to await
the outcome of the investigation, although he said it would not
support the contention of some critics that the force routinely
brutalized citizens.
</P>
<P>
   `I feel terrible about what happened,'' he said. ``We're working
very, very hard to assist the family and everyone in the community
to understand it. But I am not going to subscribe to a notion that
the police officers in New York City as some general matter are
acting improperly.''

COURT-MARTIAL BEGINS FOR MARINE PILOT IN SKI LIFT CABLE DEATHS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By MATTHEW L. WALD    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. _ A year after an electronic warfare jet
severed a ski lift's cables in the Italian Alps, leading to the
deaths of 20 people, a Marine Corps jury Monday began hearing
arguments about how much of the blame should fall on the pilot.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution has charged the pilot, Capt. Richard J. Ashby,
with 20 counts of negligent homicide, which could carry a prison
sentence of 200 years, saying that he broke rules on altitude and
speed.
</P>
<P>
   The defense says that the Marines were poorly trained, poorly
equipped and misinformed by the squadron, and that Captain Ashby
was only the last in a chain of people who made tragic errors.
</P>
<P>
   Ashby, 31, sat between his lawyers in a spare military courtroom
here as experts began a public dissection of his troubled squadron
and of his own actions. Nearby, 29 civilian witnesses were waiting
to testify about what they saw from the ground, while a roomful of
Belgian and German families of the victims watched over
closed-circuit television, with simultaneous translation.
</P>
<P>
   Ashby was ``a good stick,'' a good pilot, said Lt. Col. Carol
Joyce, head of the prosecution team, and he knew the rules that
would have kept him safe. ``Whether it's because he was
overconfident in his ability or whether he was just plain cocky,
Ashby chose to breach those rules and regulations,'' she told the
jury of eight officers.
</P>
<P>
   Colonel Joyce also said that a crew member in the back seat of
the jet would testify that Ashby put the plane through a barrel
roll, which is against regulations, before it hit the cables.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Jon Shelburne, a defense lawyer, said that the crew
members were ``professional in the conduct of this flight, and they
were professional in the planning of this flight, and they were
just doing their jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an accident, and as you'll see, it was an accident
waiting to happen,'' Shelburne said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that almost no one in the squadron knew that the minimum
legal altitude in the area was 2,000 feet above ground level. The
ski lift cables were at 360 feet. He also said that the cable, then
31 years old, was not marked on American maps.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the government is trying to show is that information that
nobody in that squadron knew, Captain Ashby should have known, and
therefore he's guilty,'' Shelburne said.
</P>
<P>
   Ashby faces 10 years in military prison for each of 20 counts of
involuntary manslaughter, a crime that requires a finding of
culpable negligence. But he could be found guilty of negligent
homicide, a lesser crime. In July a hearing officer who conducted a
seven-day inquiry into the case against all four crew members of
the plane found ``substantial doubt'' that the men could be
convicted, because of failures by others in the squadron and
elsewhere in the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   And a month later, the commander of Marine Forces in the
Atlantic relieved the squadron commander of his command and
inserted a letter of reprimand in the file of the squadron's safety
director. The men acknowledged that the papers they maintained for
the navigators to use in flight planning were out of date and
inaccurate.
</P>
<P>
   Charges against two officers in the rear cockpit have been
dropped, leaving only Ashby and his navigator and flight planner,
Capt. Joseph P. Schweitzer, still facing charges. Schweitzer is to
be tried next month.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday afternoon, a topographic expert presented two
large-scale models of the valley where the accident occurred. One,
a diorama of the mountain slope, showed the streams, some buildings
and the ski lift. It also showed the 1,000-foot altitude that the
crew believed was the lowest allowed, rendered as a yellow line on
a plexiglass sheet at the side of the model. The cables, at about
360 feet, were obviously far below.
</P>
<P>
   The crew members deny having intended to fly under 1,000 feet.
One of the tasks for the defense is to convince the jury that
knowing how to fly low and at high speed is essential for pilots of
such a plane, an EA-6B Prowler. The plane carries missiles for
destroying radar sites, but no other armament. The jury includes
one helicopter pilot and two cargo plane pilots but no combat
pilots.
</P>
<P>
   Ashby and Schweitzer also face charges of obstruction of
justice. Prosecutors say they hid or destroyed a videotape that
they used to record portions of the flight before the leg on which
the accident occurred.
</P>
<P>
   The families of some of the victims spoke to reporters at court
on Monday. ``We don't expect that it must be the pilot who has to
be convicted,'' said Rita Wunderlich, whose husband of 20 years,
Jurgen, was killed when the cable car fell. ``We expect that the
ones who were responsible in the end will be convicted.''

<P>
   The New York Times says in an editorial on Tuesday, Feb. 9: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the movies, a fusillade of 41 bullets is nothing, a
Schwarzenegger second. In real life, the storm of police gunfire
that killed an unarmed West African immigrant last week was a
brutal human tragedy that has left a Bronx neighborhood shaken and
angry about the aggressive Street Crimes Unit that is supposed to
be making their community a safer place to live.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting occurred shortly after midnight last Thursday when
four plainclothes officers from the Street Crimes Unit saw a man in
the vestibule of a Bronx apartment building. For reasons that are
still unclear, they suddenly emptied their guns at Amadou Diallo, a
22-year-old street merchant from Guinea. Diallo, who spoke halting
English and had no police record, died at the scene.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for the policemen told journalists that ``fair-minded
people'' would recognize that ``this shooting, although tragic, was
proper.'' He said that the four had been seeking a serial rapist
who resembled Diallo, and that they thought he was acting
suspiciously and was reaching for a weapon. They found only a
wallet and a beeper in his pockets.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. attorney's office is reviewing the case, which is under
investigation by the Bronx district attorney. One police official
told The New York Times that ``it looks as though one guy may have
panicked and the rest followed suit.'' What makes that disturbing
is that while the city says that more than 90 percent of New York's
police officers never fire their guns, three of the four officers
in this case have been involved in shootings before, with two found
to have acted properly and one incident still under review by the
Brooklyn district attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has wisely counseled New Yorkers not to
rush to judgment, and he has offered assistance to Diallo's family
through the city's Community Assistance Unit. The mayor has also
assured African diplomats including the Guinean ambassador that the
case is being investigated properly. That is a good start, but the
mayor must find a way to assure the city's immigrants and
minorities that policemen from outside their neighborhoods do not
reflexively suspect a person of color and resort to force too
readily.
</P>
<P>
   Despite efforts by the mayor and the police commissioner to
encourage community relations and hold precinct commanders
responsible for complaints, there is a long history of suspicion
that makes it difficult for many to forgive the fusillade as a
simple ``mistake.'' It is critically important that city and
federal investigators find answers as quickly as possible to the
troubling questions raised by this case.

ALBERT BACK IN THE BASKETBALL BOOTH  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD SANDOMIR    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The voice sounded as if it had never disappeared into exile. The
staccato rhythm, the familiar phrases, the completeness of the
play-calling and the wisecracking were in midseason form Sunday
when Marv Albert called his first basketball game in 20 months and
his first Knicks radio game in 13 years.
</P>
<P>
   Although Albert has been host of ``MSG SportsDesk'' since
September, his comeback _ from pleading guilty to a misdemeanor
assault charge that caused him to lose his MSG Network and NBC jobs
_ seemed incomplete until he described which team was shooting at
the Eighth Avenue end of Madison Square Garden, questioned why
Patrick Ewing shot a layup rather than kick the ball for a
3-pointer with seconds left and teased his sidekick, John
Andariese.
</P>
<P>
   ``Definitely, this completed it,'' Albert said Monday. ``What
was nice was the reaction from the people, which was great. Some of
it was even heartwarming. I'm around here all the time, but I
haven't been in that type of situation. Kids were waving. It was a
great reaction.''
</P>
<P>
   For a week before the Heat-Knicks game, Albert listened to some
of his radio calls from the 1970s ``to hear the rhythm and the
phrases.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I've always loved radio. It's so different. In TV,
you have time to breathe. Radio's a completely different
mind-set.'' For part of Sunday's first half, the action was so
intense, Albert had little time to catch his breath. ``It was like
a hockey game, with end-to-end rushes.''
</P>
<P>
   In the first quarter, Andariese begged for a foul merely to say
something. ``I'm here, Marv,'' he said. ``I thought I'd say that.''
Said Albert, ``I want you to know that sometime in the second
quarter, we'll expect some analysis.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the layoff, Albert remains extremely confident about his
ability to call basketball. Sunday's game was more a chance to
release pent-up anxiety than to wonder whether he still possessed
the verbal aptitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not to be overconfident, but once the game started, I didn't
think it would be a problem,'' he said. ``Just going through the
process was what the anxiety was about. It was a wonderful day. It
felt like old times, with John.''
</P>
<P>
   If not for his legal problems, he might have been at courtside
for NBC calling the game. ``I've come to grips with that,'' Albert
said. ``I was too focused to think about it. It didn't strike me
that I could have been calling the game on TV.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; GIFFORD NEXT? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   With Dan Dierdorf gone from ``Monday Night Football,'' ABC
Sports is considering downsizing to a two-in-the-booth setup with
Al Michaels and Boomer Esiason. But Esiason is not ready to fly
solo. ABC should shift Paul Maguire from ESPN's Sunday night
National Football League booth to recreate the role he played
beside Phil Simms on NBC's No. 1 football team.
</P>
<P>
   Maguire is smart, funny and generous; he would help nurture
Esiason's development, and would fit in better than ESPN's Sterling
Sharpe, whose name has been mentioned as a successor to Dierdorf,
but who has never called a pro game.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, it looks as if Frank Gifford will not return to the
almost inconsequential role he played on the Monday night pre-game
show last season. His contract expires in June.

NORMAN GLENN, MAGAZINE PUBLISHER, DIES AT 89

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Norman R. Glenn, the publisher of two advertising and
broadcasting trade magazines, died on Friday in New York City. He
was 89.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was complications from a stroke, said his wife,
Roberta.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1930s, Glenn worked in executive positions at WLS, a
Chicago radio station. In 1946, he founded Sponsor magazine, which
covered advertising on radio and television.
</P>
<P>
   After selling Sponsor, he started Media Decisions in 1966, a
publication dealing with the planning and placement of
advertisements in communications media. He sold that publication in
1984.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, he founded Community Action Network, a nonprofit
group in New York City that provided information on urban problems.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, Glenn is survived by two children from
his first marriage, Robin Day Glenn, of Rancho Santa Margarita,
Calif., and Geoffrey, of Myrtle Beach, S.C.; two stepchildren,
Robin Okun, of Zurich, and Todd Brewster, of Dallas; and five
grandchildren.

3 MARKETS JOIN IN ELECTRONIC OPTIONS TRADING 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DAVID BARBOZA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ In yet another signal that technology and
globalization are changing the way that financial markets operate,
three large financial exchanges said Monday that they would form an
alliance to offer electronic trading in futures and options across
three continents.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the Bourse in Paris, which
operates Matif, the French derivatives exchange, and the Singapore
International Monetary Exchange said they had signed an agreement
that would allow futures and options to be traded as part of a
global electronic network that would operate around the clock in
Asia, Europe and North America.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement is the latest effort by big markets to find
cheaper and more efficient ways to trade stocks, bonds and
derivatives in an increasingly electronic financial world.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, several large exchanges have merged or formed
alliances as a way to share in the cost of developing new
technology and to offer customers a broader range of financial
products. The exchanges also aim to create technology platforms
that may some day supplant the traditional ``open outcry'' system,
where traders shout out bids on a cluttered trading floor.
</P>
<P>
   The new venture that was announced in Paris Monday is being
called the Globex Alliance, after the electronic trading system
called Globex, which was founded in 1992 by the Chicago Merc and
Matif.
</P>
<P>
   The vast majority of trading here in Chicago is still done in
trading pits. But electronic trading of derivatives, like futures
on interest rates and currencies, is growing on the periphery of
that activity, and many of those financial products already trade
after hours on the electronic Globex system.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the three exchanges _ which expect to begin trading
together in the third quarter _ said they might ask other markets
to join the alliance, while also looking at alliances independent
of one another.
</P>
<P>
   M. Scott Gordon, chairman of the Chicago Merc, said his exchange
had been in partnership and alliance talks with just about every
other major market, particularly with regard to technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just can't do this alone; it's too costly to build a
proprietary system in a world that wants connectivity,'' Gordon
said. ``Given that we are going to expand our electronic platforms,
it's important we have partners. This is all about creating
efficiencies and lower costs for our customers.''

BROWNS CHOOSE FROM EXPANSION LISTS TUESDAY  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANK LITSKY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the last three seasons, there has been no Cleveland Browns
team because the club with that name moved to Baltimore and became
the Ravens.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the new Cleveland Browns, who will start playing in
the fall, will become more of a reality when they choose 30 to 42
players in an expansion draft.
</P>
<P>
   The 30 other National Football League teams have exposed five
players each (no kickers or punters allowed). Some, like Reggie
White, are about to retire. Some, such as Neil Smith (with a salary
of $3.5 million), Michael Jackson ($3.2 million), Antonio Langham
($3 million), Tito Wooten ($2 million) and Mike Fox ($1.8 million),
may be too highly paid to be selected. Some are well past their
prime. Some are fringe players.
</P>
<P>
   The Browns must spend almost $22 million, which represents at
least 38 percent of their salary cap, on the salaries of the
players they choose on Tuesday. The team will get most of its
players through free agency and the college draft.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland can choose experienced quarterbacks in Glenn Foley,
Gus Frerotte and Heath Shuler. The Browns are more likely to turn
to offensive linemen such as Andy Heck, Todd Rucci and Jim Pyne.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I initially looked at the list it didn't blow me away,''
General Manager Dwight Clark of the Browns said. ``Some of the
players I had not been that familiar with. Ultimately, you start
digging in and finding more information about them. That's when you
start getting excited about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Browns made one move Monday, signing Ray Perkins as the
tight ends coach. The 57-year-old Perkins had been an assistant
coach with Oakland and spent four years as head coach of the Giants
(1979-82) and four as head coach of Tampa Bay (1987-90).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ARENA FOOTBALL UP FOR GRABS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The National Football League is expanding, more or less. Monday,
it acquired an option to buy up to 49.9 percent of the Arena
Football League within the next three years.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL said it would decide in the next 12 to 24 months whether
to exercise the option, which would give it a voice in the
operation of the Arena League. Such a move by the NFL would take a
three-quarters vote of its club owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to support football at all levels,'' Paul
Tagliabue, the NFL commissioner, said.
</P>
<P>
   He and others said there was no plan for the Arena league to
become part of an NFL farm system.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; GIANTS DROP MILLER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In his eight years with the Giants, five of those years as a
starter, Corey Miller became a solid strongside linebacker,
especially against the run. But his relationship with Coach Jim
Fassel turned acrimonious last year.
</P>
<P>
   Miller failed a recent physical examination, and Monday the
Giants terminated his contract, which had a year to run at a salary
of $1.8 million. If Miller does not sign with another team, the
Giants must pay him an injury settlement of $200,000.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; $5 MILLION RAISE, OF SORTS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The National Football League salary cap was officially set
Monday at $57.288 million, up some $5 million from last season. The
setting of the salary cap now allows teams to move forward with
free-agent plans and the signings of their own players.

CHINA SEEKS DELAYS IN AIRCRAFT DELIVERIES
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By SETH FAISON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANGHAI, China _ The Chinese authorities announced Monday that
they were asking suppliers of commercial aircraft to delay
deliveries to the nation's airlines.
</P>
<P>
   After years of breakneck growth that could barely keep up with
surging demand, China's airlines now suffer from serious
overcapacity. Fare wars and half-empty flights, unknown in China
until recently, are now common headaches for China's two dozen
airline companies.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, China's official media reported Monday, the
authorities are taking several steps to limit growth in airline
capacity. With 43 new commercial aircraft scheduled to be delivered
this year, about 40 older planes will be sold, leased or taken out
of service.
</P>
<P>
   An unspecified number of aircraft scheduled to be delivered in
2000 and 2001 will be delayed, Wang Zhi, a senior official at the
Civil Aviation Administration of China, told China Daily. Although
Wang did not say so explicitly, it seems unlikely that any new
orders will be made this year.
</P>
<P>
   The delays are bad news for Boeing and Airbus Industrie, the
world's leading aircraft makers, which eagerly compete for business
in China. Executives at each company seemed surprised, even
skeptical, of the announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Dong Yuguo, a spokesman for Airbus China, referred to Monday's
report as he said, ``You could say we're very curious.''
</P>
<P>
   Just two years ago, Boeing projected that China would spend $140
billion on more than 2,000 aircraft by 2014. Yet now, China's
economy is gradually slowing, and the deeply uncertain economic
outlook that hangs over Asia makes it impossible to project
aviation growth accurately.
</P>
<P>
   Aviation executives often complain that their business, with
such enormous price tags on each aircraft, is particularly
vulnerable to shifting politics, domestic and international.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, large orders for aircraft are often timed to
coincide with visits by American or European leaders. Of the orders
for 57 aircraft Boeing has received from China over the last two
years, 27 deals were formally ordered during President Clinton's
visit to Beijing last June.
</P>
<P>
   With China's economic growth rate slowing, Chinese officials
wrestling with how to deal with overcapacity in today's airline
market are balking at all the orders already made for new aircraft.
Planned expansions in Chinese airports are also being scaled back.
</P>
<P>
   Liu Jianfeng, director of the General Administration of Civil
Aviation of China, announced in January that China would cut in
half its planned spending on airport renovation, aviation equipment
and new aircraft in 1999, to roughly $1.5 billion from nearly $3
billion.
</P>
<P>
   China's aviation traffic grew by more than 30 percent in 1994
and 1995. In 1996, the growth rate slowed to 12 percent, then to
7.5 percent in 1997 and to 6.3 percent last year, Wang said. Yet
capacity grew faster than that, creating an oversupply of passenger
seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Setbacks last year taught Chinese aviation a lesson,'' Wang
was quoted as saying. ``In a sense, it is a good thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The 43 passenger aircraft scheduled for delivery this year
include 15 Boeing 737's, 3 Boeing 757's, 19 Airbus 320's, a Boeing
747 and 2 Boeing 777's, China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines will try to sell or lease some of their aircraft, Wang
said. They will also shift air routes to try to improve passenger
loads. Meanwhile, some old passenger aircraft will be converted
into freight carriers, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If any foreign buyers want to buy airplanes from Chinese
airlines, these airplanes will be sold,'' Wang said.

SPRINTERS PROVE THEY CAN ALSO RUN OFF AT THE MOUTH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Running is the no-frills way to fly. You don't
have to have a ball in your hands, a helmet on your head, pads on
your shoulders or even shoes on your feet.
</P>
<P>
   Sprinting, in particular, can be as uncomplicated as a child.
You lift your knees, pump your arms and the next thing you know
you're soaring like a human glider. And if one day you become a
Concorde, that's when you learn the paradox of winged feet:
</P>
<P>
   The swifter you are, the more bogged down you get.
</P>
<P>
   Take Maurice Greene and Jon Drummond. They love to fly and it
shows. When they sprint, their feet land on the track like
snowflakes. They barely make a sound when they're in motion, but at
rest they are loud and proud.
</P>
<P>
   Greene and Drummond _ along with their HSI training partner Ato
Boldon _ not only can run with the best of them, they can run their
mouths like a young Muhammad Ali. Left to their own devices, they
could talk up a ton of interest in track and field.
</P>
<P>
   So why is it the sport is on the wane in the U.S.? The answer
lies partly in the awkward situation that presented itself the
other day at an arranged press conference at UCLA's Drake Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Greene, 24, and Drummond, 30, are bringing their
fierce-yet-friendly rivalry to the Sports Arena on Saturday for the
39th L.A. Invitational. They were eager to talk about it, not least
of all because it kept them from having to join a manic Monday
training session in progress. They had ample motivation and an
attentive audience. There was just one thing missing. Fifteen
minutes after the press conference was scheduled to start, the
assembled audience learned what it was.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you wait until my manager gets here?'' Greene cried out
from the track.
</P>
<P>
   Greene was only doing what he was told. But it bears noting that
not once during Super Bowl week did Denver quarterback John Elway
wait until his agent was around to answer any questions. And a lot
of us would never know what Shaquille O'Neal was thinking if we had
to get Leonard Armato's permission to approach him.
</P>
<P>
   If track and field completely collapses in the U.S., it surely
will be under the weight of the athletes' entourages, which have
grown in proportion to the sport's over-the-table purses.
</P>
<P>
   The L.A. Invitational is proof that the fast lane is paved in
gold. It is the second of four indoor meets on the Golden Spike
series, which was initiated this year to stem the migration of this
country's best athletes to Europe for the winter's lucrative indoor
season.
</P>
<P>
   As they did last week at the Millrose Games in New York, Greene
and Drummond will make money simply for showing up. They can
collect more cash for finishing among the top six in the evening's
featured event.
</P>
<P>
   They are scheduled to run the 50 meters. But L.A. meet
organizers Al and Don Franken sounded amenable to setting up a
60-meter course so the runners can secure a 50 split and still
challenge Greene's indoor world record of 6.39 in the 60.
</P>
<P>
   At Madison Square Garden this past Friday, Greene, the reigning
world champion in the 100, overcame a slow start and pulled away
from Drummond in the last 10 meters to prevail in the 60, 6.51 to
6.54. After the race, an ebullient Greene blanketed the crowd with
T-shirts that had a single word silk-screened on them:
</P>
<P>
   Phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   Greene, who lives in Woodland Hills, came by his superstardom
honestly. He has sweated endlessly for it, relocating from his
hometown of Kansas City three years ago to train under coach John
Smith and alongside Drummond and Boldon.
</P>
<P>
   In an age when the top sprinters regularly go to great lengths
to avoid competing head-to-head, Greene, Drummond and Boldon boldly
put their egos on the line every day. It's at once a great and
grating way to measure their progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe me, there are a lot of days when you don't feel that
great,'' Greene said. ``Then you see one of your teammates run a
good time in practice and you say, `Dang, now I have to do that.'
''
</P>
<P>
   Joined in Drummond, ``You have to have a thick skin to be part
of the group. Because if you mess up, we'll talk about you. You'll
be the brunt of jokes for the whole week.''
</P>
<P>
   Greene and Drummond professed not to care which one of them wins
Saturday, as long as they finish 1-2.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not afraid to compete against each other,'' Drummond
said.
</P>
<P>
   They're not averse to being affable, either. Their quick wit and
fast-twitch muscles could be an unbeatable combination for USA
track. But only if the people around the runners are willing to let
go a little. Build a rapport with the public and they'll come to
the track. That's something Drummond seems to recognize even if his
handlers sometimes need a gentle reminder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody loves watching people run,'' Drummond said. ``The
problem has been they haven't had a reason to come out. In the
past, sprinters were stone-faced. They'd run their race and leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to show that we have emotions. We laugh. We cry. We
get disappointed. Entertainment-wise, we want people to say,
`Forget basketball, let's go to a track meet because those guys are
real.''
</P>
<P>
   As opposed to just really fast.

LEADING RECORDING COMPANIES TO TEST ON-LINE DIGITAL SALES
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (nk)

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The five major recording companies said Monday that
they would, for the first time, begin to test selling albums as
digital information transmitted over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   A new system to be tested this spring is intended to sell
authorized recordings in a medium where most of the music,
legitimately copied and otherwise, is now available free.
</P>
<P>
   The system was announced Monday in New York by IBM, which
created the software, and the five major recording companies _
Sony, Time Warner, the Universal unit of the Seagram Co., EMI Group
and Bertelsmann Music Group. The system would let consumers pay for
an album by credit card, download it with a cable modem in less
than 10 minutes, and play it back through computer speakers or
record it on tape, digital minidisks, recordable compact disks or
other devices now on the drawing board.
</P>
<P>
   A booklet would also be downloaded, to be printed on a color
printer.
</P>
<P>
   The test, to begin between April and June, will involve 1,000
subscribers to Time Warner's Roadrunner cable modem service in San
Diego. Initially, 1,000 album titles and several hundred singles
will be available, the companies said; the number of selections is
to more than double in the six to nine months the test will be
conducted. The companies have not announced their pricing for the
digital products.
</P>
<P>
   A growing number of music recordings are already available on
the Internet free, as files that have been copied without
permission from CD's in a format called MP3. Music companies have
scrambled to find a way to sell legitimate copies of their products
on line in what they call a ``secure'' format.
</P>
<P>
   In this test, they will employ a digital watermark containing
information on where the music came from and who owns the rights;
the data will be encrypted so that only a legitimate user can play
it back.
</P>
<P>
   The music companies also want the online music to be ``copy
protected,'' enabling them to determine the number of digital
copies a consumer could make.
</P>
<P>
   In December, recording and technology companies said they would
collaborate on the Secure Digital Music Initiative, a uniform
standard for codes to be included with music transmitted digitally.
The San Diego test does not supplant the initiative, which is
intended to set standards for a new generation of digital players.
</P>
<P>
   The MP3 files now found on the Internet can be copied freely,
but are of unpredictable quality.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you compete with something that's free?'' said Larry
Kenswil, executive vice president of the Universal Music Group.
``Obviously you can't compete on price. Instead, you have to offer
higher quality, customer service and ease of use.''
</P>
<P>
   The recording industry is counting on the spread of cable modems
and other high-speed, or ``broadband,'' connections, because
conventional dial-up modems receive information too slowly to make
digital distribution practical. Kenswil predicted that in five
years, 20 percent of American homes would have broadband
connections. In fact, he said, digital distribution of music would
be an incentive for consumers to subscribe to cable modem systems.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Vidich, executive vice president of Warner Music Group,
said that the industry ``most enthusiastic about this, second only
to the music industry, is the cable industry.''
</P>
<P>
   The recording companies have no intention of abandoning plastic
disks. They plan to announce specifications soon for DVD Audio, a
CD-sized disk that will offer multichannel sound and be encoded to
prevent digital copying. DVD audio disks will hold considerably
more music than audio CD's, making them very hard to transmit over
the Internet even at today's fastest speeds.

TOP NEW YORK JUDGE CALLS FOR EASING SOME DRUG LAWS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ALAN FINDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ New York state's chief judge, Judith Kaye,
proposed several changes to the state's drug laws Monday that would
reduce sentences for some defendants found guilty of selling or
possessing narcotics.
</P>
<P>
   New York's drug laws, commonly called the Rockefeller drug laws
and enacted in 1973 under Gov. Nelson Rockefeller, carry some of
the stiffest sentences in the country. For years, critics have
contended that the laws were too harsh, but the
Republican-controlled state Senate has resisted change. Someone
convicted of selling more than two ounces of cocaine, heroin or
other controlled substances _ or possessing more than four ounces _
must be sentenced to a minimum of 15 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Kaye proposed legislation that would permit state
appellate judges to reduce the 15-year sentence, on a case-by-case
basis, when the judges believed that such a long minimum sentence
would represent a ``miscarriage of justice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The proposed statute would require the Appellate Division to
consider the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history
and character of the defendant and public safety concerns in
determining whether an injustice has occurred,'' Judge Kaye said in
an annual speech on the state's judicial system delivered in the
ornate courtroom of New York's highest court, the Court of Appeals,
in Albany.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposal, the appellate courts could reduce the
minimum sentence to no less than five years in prison. Judge Kaye
said only a limited number of defendants would have their sentences
adjusted. She noted that in wading into a highly disputed area of
the criminal law, she was not asking the state Legislature for
broad revisions in the drug laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not presume to take on the larger policy issues,'' Judge
Kaye said. ``But we do seek to address aspects of the law that can
work unjustly, and to supplement the law with some of the lessons
we in the courts have learned over the past decade on effective
responses to drug-based crime.''
</P>
<P>
   The chief judge also proposed expanding experimental court
programs that allow nonviolent, drug-addicted defendants accused of
low-level drug violations to defer prosecution or to defer serving
a prison sentence by entering and completing drug-treatment
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Under her plan, people accused of possessing or selling very
small amounts of narcotics would be eligible for drug treatment
instead of prison terms, provided that both the trial judge and the
prosecutor agreed. As many as 10,000 low-level drug defendants a
year could be permitted to defer prosecution or jail time if the
proposal became law, court officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George Pataki called the proposal thoughtful and
intelligent. ``I'm not at this point prepared to endorse it, but
it's certainly one that warrants further review,'' the governor
said.
</P>
<P>
   John McArdle, a spokesman for the Senate majority leader, Joseph
Bruno, said Bruno was open to discussing the chief judge's ideas
but in the context of other proposed changes to the justice system,
including expansion of state prisons.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Lynch, a spokesman for the Assembly speaker, Sheldon
Silver, declined to comment. The Assembly, controlled by the
Democrats, traditionally has been the branch of the Legislature
most critical of the Rockefeller drug laws.

LEADERS IN ALBANY BACK NEW ADOPTION AND FOSTER CARE RULES 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CLIFFORD J. LEVY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Seeking to comply with federal law, Gov. George
Pataki and state legislative leaders agreed Monday night on a bill
that would overhaul regulations governing adoptions and foster care
in New York, including requiring criminal background checks for
prospective parents.
</P>
<P>
   The bill is intended to help speed up adoptions and to give the
authorities more tools for removing children from abusive parents.
It signals a shift in the way the government supervises the
adoption and foster care systems. Instead of focusing on reuniting
children with their birth parents, even if the parents have harmed
them, the authorities are now supposed to make decisions based on
what is in the best interests of the child.
</P>
<P>
   Congress told the states in 1997 that they had to adopt these
changes in order to continue receiving certain federal grants, and
had Albany balked, it would have jeopardized nearly $600 million in
annual disbursements from Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children are New York's most valuable resource,'' Pataki said
in a statement, ``and we need to do everything we can to insure
children live in the safe, caring environment they deserve.''
</P>
<P>
   The Assembly approved the legislation Monday night, 148-0, and
the Senate is expected to do so on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Pataki administration and lawmakers had been negotiating the
legislation for several months, but had repeatedly hit snags over
the scope of when it would be permissible to remove a child from a
parent's care. Democrats, who have generally supported an emphasis
on keeping families intact, had fought to narrow the circumstances
under which a parent's rights would be terminated. Pataki and
Republican lawmakers had sought to give the authorities more
leeway.
</P>
<P>
   Under the legislation, the state would no longer have to
consider preserving and reuniting families if a parent had
subjected the child to severe _ including sexual _ abuse, or if the
parent had been convicted of murder, assault or other serious
felonies.
</P>
<P>
   The bill requires all prospective foster and adoptive parents to
undergo criminal background checks before children can be placed in
their homes. Parents would be rejected if they had been convicted
of certain felonies.
</P>
<P>
   All people older than 18 residing in the home of a person
applying to adopt a child or take care of a foster child would also
be required to undergo criminal background checks.
</P>
<P>
   To insure that children do not languish in foster care, the
authorities would have to terminate parental rights after a child
had been in a foster home for 15 of the previous 22 months _ and
almost immediately if there was evidence of severe abuse or if the
child had been abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   The bill includes some provisions that are not required by
Congress, including rewriting the definition of severe abuse, which
had been so narrowly defined under state law that local authorities
had rarely been able to use it to end a parent's legal rights to a
child. The bill expands the definition to include sexual abuse
against the child and several other felony offenses.

 &HT;    Senate OKs bill to kill gun suit
 &HT;    By Peter Mantius
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Legislation to block Atlanta's liability lawsuit
against gun manufacturers won approval Monday after Georgia Senate
leaders narrowly overcame Republican stalling tactics.
</P>
<P>
   The bill backed by the National Rifle Association that
originated in the House now returns to that chamber for approval of
minor Senate changes. House approval and Gov. Roy Barnes' signature
are considered mere formalities.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Bill Campbell predicted the bill would be overturned in
court as unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   The key Senate vote Monday came on a motion to revive the bill
after it had been tabled Friday by a coalition of Republicans and
Atlanta-area Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   It passed 28-26 after seven senators _ four from metro Atlanta _
changed their minds and voted to bring the bill to a vote. Lt. Gov.
Mark Taylor acknowledged calling several of the switchers, and
Senate Majority Leader Charles Walker (D-Augusta) lobbied Democrats
to support the bill early Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. David Scott (D-Atlanta) criticized Democrats for caving in
to the NRA at the expense of Atlantans who were instrumental in
electing Barnes, Taylor and other Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``To turn around and stab (those voters) in the heart by taking
away their constitutional right to sue is abominable,'' said Scott,
chairman of the powerful Senate Rules Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor disagreed. ``That (Atlanta) constituency is not speaking
to the state Senate on that issue,'' he said. ``David's
representing himself. He's a fanatic on gun control.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor said Republicans stalled the bill ``as a payback to the
NRA'' for endorsing Democrats Taylor, Barnes and Attorney General
Thurbert Baker in their campaigns last fall. Taylor claimed
Congressman Bob Barr (D-Ga.) was orchestrating the maneuvering by
Senate Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   House Minority Leader Eric Johnson (R-Savannah) called that
theory ``pure fantasy.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson acknowledged he'd called Barr, an NRA board member,
Sunday night to explain plans Senate Republicans had to try to
amend the bill Monday morning to cover not only gun manufacturers,
but all manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson stressed that 21 of 22 Senate Republicans had always
supported the bill to block Atlanta's lawsuit. But they wanted
more, and his call to Barr was a courtesy to prevent any
misunderstanding with the NRA, Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   An amendment by Sen. Bart Ladd (R-Doraville) to ban liability
lawsuits against all manufacturers (except for product defects)
lost by 33-22 Monday. After that, all Republicans except Sen. Mike
Egan (R-Atlanta) voted for the original House bill, with minor
amendments. It passed 44-11.
</P>
<P>
   Six of the seven Democrats who voted to revive the House bill
voted against it, including Sen. Connie Stokes (D-Decatur). ``I
didn't want to let it linger most of the session,'' Stokes said.
``We have a lot of other work to do.''

NHL TO LOOK INTO FIGHT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The NHL will take a closer look today at an
incident Saturday involving the Los Angeles Kings' Mattias Norstrom
and Rob Blake, and San Jose's Brantt Myhres. As a result, the
Sharks may be without their enforcer for a while.
</P>
<P>
   Myhres was suspended for the Sharks' game Monday night in
Phoenix for leaving the bench to start an altercation during San
Jose's 2-0 loss to the Kings at the Forum. A hearing is scheduled
for today to determine whether Myhres will receive a longer
sentence.
</P>
<P>
   It all started in the first period Saturday, when Myhres stepped
off his bench and went after Norstrom, who was stepping onto his
bench moments after leveling San Jose's Alex Korolyuk with a hard,
clean check. Myhres smacked the butt end of his stick above
Norstrom's right eye, opening a cut that took several stitches to
close. Blake, who was on the bench, then duked it out with Myhres.
Both players were given game misconducts.
</P>
<P>
   As for Blake's role in the scrap, Kings coach Larry Robinson
said, ``All he was doing was standing up for his teammate, who was
being pummeled on the bench. When a guy comes after you on the
bench, what are you supposed to do, kiss him?''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he was paying close attention to how long a suspension
Myhres would receive, Norstrom said, ``Not really. It's a tough
situation for him. He's there to stick up for his teammates. I
still feel my check was a clean check. There was nothing dirty
about it.... I won't change the way I play. That's my style, to
play physical and hit guys. I know once in a while I'll tick people
off. That comes with it. If I want to run around a little bit, I've
got to keep my head up.''
</P>
<P>
   Even when he's off the ice, though?
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you're on the bench,'' Norstrom admitted, ``you kind of
let your guard down.''
</P>
<P>
   Loose pucks: Winger Glen Murray, who is recovering from a knee
injury, will travel with the Kings for their game in Phoenix on
Wednesday but isn't expected to play. ``I'm going so I can skate
with the team,'' Murray said. ``I'm not going to get in any good
skating by myself.'' ... Defenseman Mark Visheau has a urinary
tract obstruction that will require surgery, and is sidelined
indefinitely.... When they arrived at practice Monday, Blake, Luc
Robitaille, Ray Ferraro and Stephane Fiset were told by Robinson
they had the day off from on-ice activities so they could rest. The
Kings begin a stretch of three games in four nights Wednesday....
Jamie Storr is expected to start in goal at Phoenix, and the Kings
are hoping Fiset can play at home the next night against
Philadelphia. Fiset suffered stiffness in his chronically ailing
groin Saturday, so the Kings are being careful with him. ``We're
trying to be as cautious as possible,'' Robinson said. ``Setbacks
are not what we need at this point. We're trying to get everybody
healthy, get everybody going.''

PATAKI AGAIN URGES CONFINING SEX OFFENDERS AFTER PRISON
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., Kan.)  (nk) 
 By CLIFFORD J. LEVY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Gov. George Pataki on Monday renewed his call for
a law that would allow the state to confine violent sex offenders
in mental hospitals after they have served their criminal
sentences.
</P>
<P>
   The measure would give New York officials the power to forcibly
commit people who are deemed mentally abnormal and likely to carry
out violent sex crimes if they are released from custody. Several
states, including New Jersey, have adopted such laws over the
objections of some civil liberties groups, which contend that
involuntary commitments amount to unfair extensions of punishment.
The U.S. Supreme Court has generally upheld the laws.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki proposed similar legislation last year, but it died in
the Assembly, which is controlled by Democrats. This year, though,
the governor has garnered support from the state's new attorney
general, Eliot L. Spitzer, a Democrat who has long promoted tougher
criminal justice measures and who pledged to try to get the
Assembly majority to agree to the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sexual violent predators must be kept off our streets,''
Spitzer said at a news conference held with Pataki. ``Our society
and our children, who are so often the victims of sexual violent
predators, must be protected. This is, of course, the first
obligation of our society.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Carrier, a spokesman for the Assembly speaker, Sheldon
Silver, a Manhattan Democrat, declined to say whether the Assembly
majority would back the legislation. ``We'll take a look at it,''
Carrier said.
</P>
<P>
   The state Senate, controlled by Republicans, is expected to
approve the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's proposal is modeled after one passed in Kansas, which
has been at the forefront of the movement among states to confine
sex offenders. It would allow the attorney general of New York to
request that a sex offender be sent to a mental hospital if the
state can prove at a civil hearing that the person meets the legal
definition of mentally abnormal or has another disorder that
suggests a likelihood of committing sexual violence again.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal applies only to people convicted of one of a list
of serious sex crimes, including forcible rape or sodomy. There
would be periodic reviews of the person's condition to determine
whether the confinement should continue.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ From a fashion point of view, which is the only one
on Seventh Avenue, the autumn shows taking place this week and next
on the tented lawn at Bryant Park are already two sandwiches shy of
a picnic. It isn't that anyone expects to have fun: there are more
than 75 men's and women's shows on the official roster, some 25
others in SoHo and Chelsea, and that means ... what? ... 8,000
outfits to be absorbed before all the hoopla ends a week from
Friday. As Michael Kors said the other day in a tone heavy with
fatigue: ``I feel like the Dunkin' Donut man. Time to make the
fashions.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, what really keeps the spectacle from being a glamorous
event _ full of models, clothes, celebrities, editors racing around
like Shriners _ is the question of whether anyone will make money.
That has always been the unabashed, undisguised goal of Seventh
Avenue, making money. But these days, with Isaac Mizrahi out of
business, fashion stocks in the dumps and pink slips at Ralph
Lauren, it is almost a taboo subject.
</P>
<P>
   As one department store executive said last week, speaking on
condition of anonymity, ``There is very little money being made,
and that's a problem for designers whose core business is
fashion.'' The executive went on to say he thought the shows
themselves were becoming increasingly irrelevant and existed mainly
to affirm the status and opinions of a few. ``It's the fashion
world talking to itself,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Well, the shows might be poor indications of who's making money
and who might be going to make money. Nonetheless, the sound of
designers yammering, in the inimitable language of Seventh Avenue,
can still produce a noise you can't ignore. In the hectic days
before the shows begin, a journey through the workrooms of
designers, famous and unknown, found a surprising chaos so close to
fashion's show time.
</P>
<P>
   Donna Karan, the head of a multimillion public company, still
had designed only a handful of looks last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the entire fall collection,'' she told a visitor,
sweeping an arm toward uncut bolts of fabric leaning against a wall
in her studio in 550 Seventh Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Karan designs by draping fabric on her fitting model. ``I
would say this is probably the toughest season I've ever had,'' she
said. ``Nothing is as it is. And it gets harder. What can I do to
make a difference?''
</P>
<P>
   Alex de Betak, a producer of fashion shows for John Bartlett,
Donna Karan and Michael Kors, was also working down to the wire.
``To be honest, the only thing I've seen are sketches,'' said de
Betak, who casts models and helps choose music for his clients.
``Nobody has a piece of clothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, de Betak was utterly serene. Each morning when he
arrived at his Greene Street office, there was usually a fax from
Bartlett, who was working in Italy, imparting some new thought
about his New York show, which will be seen on Saturday night. ``In
Italy, especially, because I don't sleep,'' Bartlett said later,
``I just write everything in a fax to him, and that makes me go to
sleep. I just write about all these things _ whether it's a song or
about hair or a model.''
</P>
<P>
   On his return to New York, Bartlett was in his studio, a big
loft on West 15th Street, with his dog, Sweetie, and a couple of
assistants. ``The inspiration this season is a very Midwestern,
`steel town' thing,'' he said. ``That, and Alfred Stieglitz and
Georgia O'Keeffe _ their relationship, New York and the
Southwest.''
</P>
<P>
   Up at KCD, the fashion production and publicity company, which
is in Bartlett's building, Ed Filapowski, a partner, was
auditioning models and going over seating for the Marc Jacobs show,
which will be seen on Monday night. KCD receives 5,000 requests for
seats to the shows it handles for Jacobs, Richard Tyler, Calvin
Klein and others.
</P>
<P>
   Filapowski and several colleagues were studying a large seating
chart for Jacobs' show. When an invited guest RSVP'd, a colored dot
with his or her name was stuck onto a seat on the chart _ orange
for the designer's friends, another color for celebrities. But few
of the celebrities had responded yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not into celebrities or anything,'' Marybeth Schmitt of
KCD said dryly, holding up sheets of dots with names of celebrities
invited on behalf of Jacobs, including Marilyn Manson, Courtney Cox
and Matt Dillon. ``Every celebrity there possibly is, we have a dot
for.''
</P>
<P>
   Even more than in past seasons, it seems, a flood of unknown
young designers are vying for the attention. On Friday, Harper's
Bazaar will be host for a store opening for Christine Ganeaux, 34,
on Crosby Street. The magazine sent out 650 invitations, but when
word got out that the magazine was touting a new designer, 150
extra requests for tickets came in. ``I mean, we're always sitting
around at Bazaar saying, `Are we going to wait for Bernard Arnault
to discover the next new talent?''' said Annemarie Iverson, fashion
and beauty director of Bazaar.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ganeaux, a former makeup artist, has captivated the
magazine's editors by creating what they consider the perfect pair
of shapely, hip-hugging pants.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sort of similar to how Daryl K started,'' Ms. Iverson
said. ``Christine changed the pattern like 40 times before she got
it right. It's hard to find a trouser that makes your butt look
good. And isn't that what defines a trouser right now?''

 NEW YORK: right now?''

   Sandy Dalal, who won an award for new talent in men's wear last
year from the fashion industry's trade group, was shuttling between
a midtown garment factory and his design headquarters, in the
apartment he grew up in on West 58th Street. Unlike some of Seventh
Avenue's biggest names, Dalal had nearly all of his samples done _
trousers and shirts in old-school fabrics like Harris tweed, loden
and waxed cotton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I live to be in the factory,'' said Dalal, a young man of 22
with a ponytail. ``Men traditionally _ forever, I think _ are just
not used to showing who they are. They just like stones. They're
just there, until you get to know them. I like my clothes to
express the same sentiment.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, on West 39th Street, at the headquarters of Calvin
Klein, the designer was looking at a fitting model in different
women's trousers _ mostly narrow, low in the waist, with a felted
feel, which is turning up so many places this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all felted,'' Klein said. ``We've been felted for a
while.''
</P>
<P>
   He got to talking about Gwyneth Paltrow, whom he had dressed in
a much-photographed silvery skirt with a strapless black top and
cardigan for the Golden Globes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking the Golden Globes is probably, like, a suit,''
he said. ``I didn't think it was that dressy, because I never watch
those things.''
</P>
<P>
   But the actress had fallen for the skirt. ``I was showing her
that possibility for later, but nobody wants to hear `later,''' he
said. ``She said, `No, I want to wear it now.' And now, all of a
sudden, we're getting stores saying they want it. Gwyneth is as
modern as they come.''
</P>
<P>
   Back at 550 Seventh, the garment district's most prestigious
address, Oscar de la Renta was in his studio, staring at a pair of
tobacco-brown pants and a little cropped sweater on his fitting
model. de la Renta believes in making the kind of clothes that
women wear. Last month, after his couture collection for Balmain in
Paris, the house sold 64 pieces the next day. ``Apparently, it was
like a basement sale,'' said de la Renta, who returned to New York
with a cold.
</P>
<P>
   A few floors higher in the building, Bill Blass, who had a mild
stroke in December, seemed to be back to his former grumpy self.
``You don't have a cigarette do you, kid?'' he asked a visitor, who
didn't. Blass, who will skip this month's fashion week and show in
April, has been told by his doctors to quit smoking, but he wasn't
entirely reformed. ``It tastes so much better when you sneak
them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On the 15th floor, Ms. Karan, draping fabric on a model last
Friday night, still seemingly far from having a collection ready,
nonetheless predicted that she will, once again, be ready when the
lights go up on Feb. 19.
</P>
<P>
   She looked at a piece of crinkled off-white cotton. ``Now, this
is how the whole collection started, off this piece,'' she said.
``This is the original inspiration. So we are just playing.'' She
smiled wryly. ``It's about a lot of cotton. The big `C' _ cotton,
cashmere and candles.''

FINANCIER ACCUSED OF FRAUD ADMITS LYING TO INVESTIGATORS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By LESLIE EATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a surprising admission from the witness stand,
Patrick R. Bennett, who stands accused of orchestrating one of the
biggest financial frauds in American history, said Monday that he
had lied under oath and conspired to thwart a federal investigation
into his company, the Bennett Funding Group of Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett was testifying in his own defense in federal District
Court in Manhattan, where he has been on trial for two months on
charges that he defrauded hundreds of investors and banks of
roughly $700 million. His lawyers said the day's admissions did not
affect Bennett's plea of not guilty to the more serious allegations
in the case, including dozens of charges of securities fraud, money
laundering and mail fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett was chief financial officer of Bennett Funding, which
purported to be in the business of financing leases of office
equipment like copiers and faxes; it also invested in hotels and
various gambling businesses. But prosecutors contend that the
company was fooling investors into believing that they were making
a profit while it diverted the money to themselves.
</P>
<P>
   About 10,000 people, many of them from New York and New Jersey
and most of them retirees looking for a safe place to put their
money, invested in Bennett Funding before the company collapsed in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   In what lawyers watching the trial called a highly unusual
admission, Bennett said that he had lied to the Securities and
Exchange Commission, which began its investigation in 1993, looking
into his company's financial statements and some of the securities
it sold to investors. He fabricated documents and persuaded those
who helped him to lie to investigators, too, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I just admitted to was wrong, and I realize it was
wrong,'' Bennett said. ``I'll explain some reasons, what went on,
but it was a very bad thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The admission by Bennett, who was flushed and teary eyed, also
prompted tears from his wife, Gwen, who was sitting in the front
row of the courtroom. With her were her parents and siblings, as
well as her father-in-law, Edmund Bennett, who founded the Bennett
Funding Group but has not been charged in the case. Chief Judge
Thomas P. Griesa called a short recess to allow Bennett to compose
himself.
</P>
<P>
   When his testimony resumed, Bennett, responding to questions
from his lawyer, David B. Levitt, said his reason for lying about
his activities was not an intention to hide any fraudulent
activities. Rather, he said, he had lied and fabricated documents
to give the impression that his company had sound business
practices. He did not think that investigators would believe the
truth, that he had done business ``with not much more than a
handshake and a couple of documents,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Several other people, including Bennett's brother Michael, have
already pleaded guilty to charges of perjury and obstruction of
justice.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett's unusual admission concluded what had been a day of
mostly dry testimony, which Bennett delivered in a gravelly
monotone. His testimony was expected to continue Tuesday, when
prosecutors are also likely to begin their cross-examination.
</P>
<P>
   Describing himself early as a ``country bumpkin'' with little
education or business experience whose company grew too quickly,
Bennett said that he had relied on others for legal and accounting
advice.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyer, Levitt, continued to raise questions about Kenneth
Kasarjian, an associate of Bennett's who has already pleaded guilty
to criminal charges and testified against Bennett. The prosecution
presented 31 witnesses, and jurors received nine volumes of
exhibits relating to Bennett's complex financial transactions.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Bennett case has angered investors, who have been
known to demand his blood at public meetings, few of them have
attended the trial. Only one, who declined to give his name but
said he had lost money investing with the Bennetts, appeared
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Other observers at the trial included lawyers from the
Securities and Exchange Commission, a lawyer who is supervising
Bennett's personal bankruptcy, and a lawyer for Richard C. Breeden,
the former chairman of the commission who is serving as
court-appointed trustee for the bankrupt Bennett companies and is
trying to recover money for investors.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett himself helped with that effort Monday, his lawyers
said, by turning over to prosecutors 1.2 million shares of a
company called Equivest, which is a public company owned mostly by
the Bennett enterprises. At Monday's market price, the shares are
worth more than $6.5 million. Bennett happened to find the shares
while going through a box, his lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   The shares are to be turned over to Breeden, who has said he
intends to sell them to the public.

EDITORIAL: THE CASE GOES TO THE SENATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Feb. 9: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now that the closing arguments are over and the prosecution and
defense teams have retired to the sidelines, the Senate is called
to its appointment with history. The issue entrusted to it is not
solely whether Bill Clinton should be removed from office, but
whether the senators in their final actions on this case can
satisfy the nation's yearning for a fair and just conclusion to the
Monica Lewinsky affair. The country will long remember how Trent
Lott and Tom Daschle handle their leadership duties this week, and
how the Senate acquits itself.
</P>
<P>
   The first requirement is an open debate on the two articles of
impeachment. It seems inconceivable that in 1999 the Senate would
hold a secret debate on whether to overturn a presidential
election, one of the gravest decisions it is ever asked to make.
The closed-door rules that prevailed 131 years ago in the
impeachment trial of President Andrew Johnson, before the principle
of open government proceedings was firmly established, have no
place in the modern Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The latest argument for secrecy _ that it would speed the debate
and leave time for consideration of a censure resolution before the
holiday recess begins at the end of the week _ is feeble. If each
senator is allotted 10 minutes instead of 15, the debate can be
completed by Wednesday evening. A bipartisan majority of the
Senate, led by a Democrat, Tom Harkin, and a Republican, Kay Bailey
Hutchison, is ready to jettison the old rule as final deliberations
begin. Lott's resistance is a disservice to the Senate and the
principles of American democracy. Without his support, Harkin and
Ms. Hutchison will be hard pressed to find the 67 votes required to
change the rule.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the week, there will not be 67 votes to convict Clinton
and end his presidency. That outcome is right, for Clinton's
misconduct, as reprehensible as it was, does not warrant his
removal. But the anguish of Robert Byrd and many other senators is
understandable as they consider how to vote. The constitutional
standard for expelling a president has not been met, but Clinton
should not be allowed to spend his retirement years arguing that it
was a political vendetta rather than his own conduct that got him
in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to avoid that is for Republicans and Democrats to
unite behind a strong censure resolution and to overcome the
filibuster threatened by their pugnacious colleague Phil Gramm.
Finding precisely the right language has not proved easy, but with
moderate Republicans like John Chafee and Olympia Snowe now eager
for the Senate to approve a formal rebuke of Clinton, appropriately
stern language can be found in the next few days. The nation will
give thanks this week if a year of turmoil ends with eloquent and
open debate and calmly reasoned decisions in the Senate.

 &HT;    Air Force to advertise on TV to boost recruiting
 &HT;    By Scott Montgomery and Timothy R. Gaffney
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For the first time in its history the Air Force
will begin buying television time to run recruiting ads in hopes of
reversing enlistment declines caused by an enticing job market and
an increasingly hectic military life.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning with a college basketball game at the end of the
month, the Air Force Recruiting Service will pour $17 million into
big-market TV buys using ads that previously ran on donated time as
public service announcements. At the same time, officials said
Monday, the Air Force is in the early phase of developing a
brand-new ad campaign that will open with the fall television
schedule and involve another $37 million in spending.
</P>
<P>
   The sudden change in philosophy and influx of cash to
advertising accounts follows poor recruiting performance in the
first months of this fiscal year. Starting in October, when the
federal budget for 1999 began, the Air Force has failed to meet
enlistment goals in three of the last four months, raising the
specter the service could miss year-end goals for the first time
since 1979.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel our competition is with local corporations and
colleges,'' said Tech Sgt. Jeff Bowser, who runs Dayton, Ohio's Air
Force recruiting office.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is twofold: The robust economy has given potential
recruits lots of alternatives to military service, and those who
opt to serve find the work pace difficult to take because the armed
forces have been shrinking at the same time that worldwide
peace-keeping missions have increased.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, the quality of life for military service members has
been highlighted in Washington as all branches of the military have
seen enlistment and re-enlistment figures sag. President Clinton
proposed a 4.4 percent pay raise for all military personnel in his
2000 budget, and last October the Air Force set up an enlistment
bonus program offering up to $9,000 for prize recruits.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force advertising budget hasn't been raised to
accommodate higher media costs since 1990. The $17 million and $37
million allotments for broadcast time announced Monday will be
spent in addition to the Air Force's regular $16 million
advertising budget, which already was boosted by $6 million this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Bowser, a 20-year veteran, said the Dayton office usually meets
its recruiting goals, though it has been difficult.
</P>
<P>
   One reason the Air Force is struggling with recruiting is that
many people only enlist to learn skills such as computer
programming, then leave after four years.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of folks do use the Air Force as a stepping stone,''
Bowser said.
</P>
<P>

Daily News, Dayton, Ohio.

NEW YORK GETS WINDFALL FROM U.S. WELFARE-MONEY SURPLUS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The Pataki administration has quietly built up a
$500 million surplus in federal welfare money over the last two
years as a result of the dramatic decline in the number of people
on public assistance, and expects that sum to grow to $1.4 billion
in the next budget year.
</P>
<P>
   The administration acknowledged the existence of the surplus in
the text of the budget that Gov. George Pataki proposed two weeks
ago, but it went largely unnoticed by the Legislature. The budget
called for spending $1 billion of the welfare money on a range of
programs to help people make the transition from public assistance
to work. It also proposed keeping nearly $400 million in a reserve
fund to hedge against a downturn in the economy.
</P>
<P>
   The $500 million in federal welfare money that the state has
already stockpiled means that the state's current budget surplus is
not $2 billion, as had been widely estimated, but $2.5 billion. The
revelation of this pot of money is likely to touch off a fierce
battle in the Legislature over how to use it.
</P>
<P>
   The amount that has piled up in New York's coffers dwarfs that
of neighboring states. In Connecticut, for example, state officials
have used almost all of its $534 million in federal welfare grants
over the last two years on child care and other programs for the
poor. In New Jersey, officials have a welfare surplus of $280
million for the two years but plan to use about $60 million of that
total to provide child care for the poor and to pay for
administrative costs associated with running poverty programs. The
rest will be kept in a rainy-day fund.
</P>
<P>
   The savings that New York has accumulated stems from extensive
changes that the federal government made to its welfare program in
1996. Under those changes, the government ceased paying states
according to the number of welfare recipients they have. Instead,
it provides states with block grants based on years when their
caseloads were high.
</P>
<P>
   Because most states have reduced their welfare caseloads in
recent years, the grants provide them with a financial windfall. In
the case of New York, where the welfare rolls have dropped
dramatically over the last four years, state officials receive
about $2.33 billion a year from the federal government. The money
can only be used to pay benefits or to establish programs that help
welfare recipients find work _ from job training to child care.
</P>
<P>
   Of the roughly $4.6 billion that New York has received over the
last two years, it has spent all but $500 million.
</P>
<P>
   The savings that the state has on hand, along with the $900
million it expects to save next year from its federal block grant,
places New York in a strong position to expand programs intended to
help recipients enter the work force. Advocates for the poor say
such programs are critically important now that the federal
government has set strict limits on the amount of time that people
are allowed to receive public assistance grants.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Karen Schimke, the executive director of the State Communities
Aid Society, an advocacy group for the poor, said the need to
expand such programs was particularly pressing because many of
those people who remained on the welfare rolls had inadequate
education and other problems that have made them difficult to
employ.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are people who are going to need lots of extra support
and services,'' she said. ``This money could be invaluable to
helping many recipients find and retain jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   New York's welfare rolls have dropped by roughly 500,000 people
over the last four years, to about 978,000. Many experts credit the
decline to increased job opportunities that have come with a
booming economy.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for the poor have been urging the state to use this
time of prosperity to rechannel money it is saving in decreased
welfare benefits to expand programs that will help poor people find
and keep jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal the governor submitted in his budget represents a
major commitment to that end, his aides said. But advocates for the
poor assert that the state should have already been investing that
money in such programs, instead of salting it away. Of the $1.4
billion that the state expects to save from its federal welfare
grant, the administration intends to spend $388 million next year
for a variety of programs that would provide additional day care
for poor parents.

CLOSING ARGUMENTS GIVEN AS SENATE DELIBERATIONS TO BEGIN 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Struggling to revive their flagging impeachment
case during final arguments Monday, House prosecutors repeated
their plea to ``cleanse the office,'' by removing President
Clinton, then asked Senate leaders to extend the trial and consider
new evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Mindful that the historic proceeding is likely to end this week,
White House lawyers countered by again poking holes in the
impeachment case, saying Republicans who want ``to win too badly''
are pushing the charges to ``achieve partisan ends.''
</P>
<P>
   Senators sitting in judgment of the president are set Tuesday to
begin deliberating, probably behind closed doors, whether to
convict Clinton on the charges contained in either of the two
articles of impeachment, which deal with perjury and obstruction of
justice.
</P>
<P>
   With the odds against two-thirds of the senators voting to
convict and remove the president, negotiations were under way among
Republicans and Democrats on a resolution to censure or condemn the
president for his affair with former White House intern Monica
Lewinsky and his admitted effort to keep it secret.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to making their final plea to convict the president,
frustrated House prosecutors complained to senators about being
barred from presenting a full-blown case and challenged senators to
ignore the polls and Clinton apologists.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you decide will have a profound effect on our culture and
our politics,'' said Illinois Rep. Henry Hyde, the lead House
prosecutor, as he ridiculed senators' private discussions of a
censure resolution before voting on the articles of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, do you really cleanse the office as provided in the
Constitution? Or do you use the Air Wick of a censure resolution?''
Hyde asked.
</P>
<P>
   In a last-ditch effort to keep the case against Clinton alive,
Hyde wrote to Senate leaders Trent Lott, R-Miss., and Tom Daschle,
D-S.D., asking them to allow prosecutors to investigate whether
White House aide Sidney Blumenthal committed perjury in videotaped
testimony shown Saturday on the Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde pressed the two leaders to have the Senate subpoena three
journalists who have submitted sworn statements claiming that
Blumenthal lied under oath when he testified that he never passed
on to reporters the president's claim that Lewinsky was a stalker.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, journalist Christopher Hitchens and his wife,
Carol Blue, signed affidavits stating that Blumenthal told them
that the former White House intern was a stalker. Journalist Scott
Armstrong signed an affidavit Monday saying that he was told by
Hitchens and Blue about their conversation with Blumenthal and the
``stalker'' comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president may have engaged in an intimidation campaign''
against Lewinsky in January 1998 and Blumenthal ``may have
testified falsely before the Senate,'' Hyde wrote, adding that it
could indicate a pattern by the Clinton White House of ``devising
schemes to undermine'' the credibility of potential witnesses
against the president.
</P>
<P>
   Daschle, who successfully blocked Lott's effort Monday to add
the Hitchens and Blue affidavits to the trial record, said
Democrats are prepared to object if any GOP senator seeks approval
of Hyde's request.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't need additional witnesses,'' Daschle said.
</P>
<P>
   With deliberations to begin Tuesday in only the second
presidential impeachment trial, a move to allow the public to
observe the proceedings faded Monday when Lott announced his
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, who is working with
Democrats to open the debate, said ``it's going to be hard to meet
the two-thirds'' vote requirement to suspend a rule requiring
impeachment deliberations to be conducted in secret.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be difficult, but I have not given up hope,''
Hutchison said.
</P>
<P>
   The roll call votes on the two articles of impeachment _ which
Senate leaders say will be held no later than Friday _ will be in
public session.
</P>
<P>
   During almost six hours of closing arguments, Hyde's prosecutors
and White House counsel Charles F.C. Ruff debated the fine points
of the charges against Clinton and whether the allegations, if
true, rise to the ``high crimes and misdemeanors'' standard for
removing a president as outlined in the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill McCollum, a Florida Republican and House prosecutor,
challenged senators to run counter to the polls that show that most
Americans want Clinton to stay in office although they believe
Clinton lied under oath and obstructed justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are the consequences of failing to remove this president
from office if you believe he's committed the crimes of perjury and
obstruction of justice?'' McCollum asked. ``Your vote to acquit
under these circumstances may well mean that no president in the
future will ever be impeached or removed for perjury or obstruction
of justice. Is that the record that you want?''
</P>
<P>
   Another prosecutor, Rep. Steve Chabot, R-Ohio, asked senators
how they want to be remembered by history. ``Will the final chapter
say that the Senate turned its back on perjury and obstruction of
justice by the president?'' Chabot asked. ``Or will it say that the
Senate took a principled stand and told the world that no person,
not even the president, stands above the law?''
</P>
<P>
   Ruff, a former federal prosecutor and law professor, argued that
removing Clinton on the evidence presented by House prosecutors
would debase the intentions of the Founding Fathers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would it put at risk the liberties of the people to retain the
president in office?'' he asked. ``Putting aside partisan animus,
if you can honestly say that it would not, that those liberties are
safe in his hands, then you must vote to acquit.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the Republicans who have argued for Clinton's removal, Ruff
said: ``I believe their vision to be too dark, a vision too little
attuned to the needs of the people. I believe it to be a vision
more focused on retribution, more designed to achieve partisan
ends, more uncaring about the future we face together.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to evidence and testimony that contradicts the
prosecutors' allegations and inferences, Ruff said: ``The stubborn
facts will not budge, nor will the stubborn denials by every
participant in their mythical plot.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyde, who had the last word in the debate, defended his team of
Republican prosecutors. None of them ``has committed perjury nor
obstructed justice nor claimed false privileges; none of us has
hidden evidence under anyone's bed nor encouraged false testimony
before the grand jury,'' Hyde said, referring to actions Clinton
allegedly instigated.
</P>
<P>
   Public opinion polls show Americans growing tired of the
impeachment saga which grew out of a sex-and-lies scandal almost 13
months ago. Ruff and Hyde conceded that they too have grown weary.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are taking the last steps along a path that for most of us
has seemed to be unending,'' Ruff said.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde, his voice betraying his resignation to the president's
impending acquittal, said: ``We are blessedly coming to the end of
this melancholy procedure.''

EDITORIAL: PATAKI RETREATS ON EARLY EDUCATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Feb. 9: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George Pataki asserts that his budget for early-childhood
programs will give local school districts more flexibility in
spending. In fact, his budget would dismantle New York state's
fledgling universal pre-kindergarten program and harm efforts to
reduce class sizes statewide, with the worst impact on New York
City schools. Legislation passed in 1997 would have provided about
$245 million for several key programs, including pre-kindergarten
for 4-year-olds, smaller classes in the early grades and school
building maintenance. Pataki will trim that to $200 million.
</P>
<P>
   New York City's loss would be particularly painful. The $140
million it would otherwise have received will drop to $77 million
under Pataki's plan. The city has undertaken a tremendous effort to
create a citywide pre-kindergarten program that is now serving
about 14,000 children. It had hoped to receive increased state
support to serve 28,000 children next year, and to serve all
112,000 4-year-olds in the city by 2002, a goal set by the state's
1997 universal pre-K law. The Pataki cuts wipe out the possibility
of expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki insists that the city will not see any less money. He
says he can use $100 million in new federal class-size-reduction
money to substitute for the loss of state funds. But the federal
government may not allow that to happen. The federal law clearly
says that federal money may be used only to supplement state and
local aid, not supplant them. Even using both state and federal
class-size money, New York City will not be able to reduce class
sizes in kindergarten through third grade from an average of 27 to
20 until 2007.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the worst aspect of Pataki's plan is that it would
replace the various early-education programs with a general block
grant. That would eliminate all state leadership in those reforms,
and make it likely that districts will pull back on those programs
and simply use the block grants to fill holes in their budgets.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the governor boasted of the state's efforts to expand
pre-kindergarten to all children. Investing in early education and
smaller classes returns high dividends in academic achievement. He
has a few weeks to amend his budget. He needs to reverse course and
make good on those commitments now.

 &HT;    Citrus canker feared in Hendry
 &HT;    By Sanjay Bhatt
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Asian citrus canker, lethal to citrus
trees but harmless to people and animals, might have struck the
state's largest citrus-growing county for the first time, officials
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The suspected infection of 200 grapefruit trees in a 300-acre
commercial grove in Hendry County, just west of Palm Beach County,
could compromise a state plan to halt the spread of the disease.
The only way to stop the disease is to destroy infected trees.
</P>
<P>
   Agriculture officials are expected back in the Hendry County
grove today to conduct more tests.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, state officials had proposed spending $18
million for uprooting about 54,000 citrus trees and creating a
mile-wide buffer zone in Broward County from the Atlantic Ocean to
the Everglades. The idea was to keep canker, which already has been
found in Miami-Dade and southern Broward counties, from spreading
northward.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're going to have to reevaluate the tactic,'' said
Ron Hamel, general manager of the Gulf Citrus Growers Association,
which represents 181 citrus growers.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's discovery marked the first time canker has been found
in Hendry County, Hamel said.
</P>
<P>
   Once canker infects a tree, it spreads rapidly, causing fruit to
drop prematurely and lesions to appear on the leaves, stems and
fruit.
</P>
<P>
   Canker also might have infected about 80 properties in Broward
County over a 3-square-mile area in southeast Coral Springs, state
agricultural officials said Monday. A district plant inspector
initially found signs of canker in a single grapefruit tree in a
residential yard during routine inspections.
</P>
<P>
   Plant pathologists with the state's Department of Agriculture
and Consumer Services made the canker diagnosis during the weekend
and will return to the Hendry County grove today to confirm their
suspicions, said Jack Neitzke, a spokesman for the eradication
project in Immokalee.
</P>
<P>
   Growers express concern
</P>
<P>
   If the grove is infected with canker, a quarantine area will be
established and movement of workers, citrus and equipment will be
restricted, Neitzke said. After a canker infection in Collier
County last July, officials set up a quarantine zone covering 27
square miles.
</P>
<P>
   The bacteria could have been carried to the grove by grass
clippings, leaves, equipment, people or rain from an infected area,
Neitzke said.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Florida in Gainesville, U.S. Department of
Agriculture and a private Indiana laboratory also are conducting
tests to confirm the findings, state officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Following news of the outbreak Monday, industry officials urged
state officials to spend $166 million during the next 3 1/2 years
for more canker-eradication efforts. Reports of the disease could
force trading partners to reject shipments of Florida citrus, they
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The virulent bacterial disease could wipe out the industry,
which generates an economic impact of $8.55 billion, employs
121,000 people and covers 845,260 acres,'' said Andy LaVigne,
executive vice president of Florida Citrus Mutual, the state's
largest citrus grower organization, with 12,000 members.
</P>
<P>
   In the early to mid-1980s, the state's largest outbreak of
canker forced agriculture officials to destroy 20 million citrus
trees in nurseries throughout the state.

DRIVER WILL FACE MURDER CHARGES IN CRASH THAT KILLED 3 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JOHN T. McQUISTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIVERHEAD, N.Y. _ As part of an emerging statewide trend toward
tougher prosecution of drunken drivers, the Suffolk County district
attorney filed second-degree murder charges Monday against a
36-year-old motorist for the deaths of three people in a fiery
crash on the Long Island Expressway on New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
   Edwin Rodriguez of Medford, N.Y., a jail guard in New York City,
was arraigned in a 21-count indictment in Suffolk County Criminal
Court here Monday morning and was ordered held without bail in the
Suffolk County jail by Judge Louis Ohlig.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, drunken drivers who killed people in accidents have
been charged with vehicular homicide. Under New York law, that
means they showed a ``reckless disregard'' for life. But in a
series of independent decisions by prosecutors, drunken drivers
have recently been charged with second-degree murder, which
requires proof of a ``depraved indifference to human life.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeanine Pirro, the Westchester County district attorney and
president-elect of the New York State Association of District
Attorneys, said Monday that ``an automobile is essentially as
dangerous as a knife or a gun if it is used with depraved
indifference to human life.''
</P>
<P>
   If convicted of the second-degree murder charges, Rodriguez
could be sentenced to a maximum of 25 years to life in prison. A
charge of vehicular homicide carries a sentence of 5 to 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses have told investigators that Rodriguez was speeding,
possibly going as fast as 90 miles an hour, and was weaving across
the expressway when his 1997 Kia rammed a Chevrolet Chevette in the
rear about 11:40 p.m. The impact cut fuel lines in the Chevette,
which burst into flames, killing three of the people inside the car
and critically injuring a fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, who pleaded not guilty, had been on his way home from
work at Rikers Island, investigators said. When tested several
hours after the accident, they said, his blood alcohol level
measured .13 percent, above the level of .10 percent at which a
driver is legally intoxicated in New York State.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Pirro and James M. Cattertson, the Suffolk County district
attorney, are urging district attorneys throughout the state to
consider a similar upgrading of charges against drunken drivers
involved in vehicular homicides.
</P>
<P>
   Maureen Fisher Riccardella, the president of the New York State
chapter of MADD, or Mothers Against Drunk Driving, said there had
been five prosecutions and convictions for second-degree murder
statewide in cases involving drunken drivers since 1997. She said
the convictions indicated that juries were willing to support the
tough charges.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald L. Kuby, a Manhattan trial and civil rights lawyer,
likened ``depraved indifference'' to firing a gun into an occupied
building. ``Similarly, this could be applied to someone who is
drunk who gets behind the wheel of a car and drives at a high rate
of speed,'' he said. ``There does not have to be an intent to kill,
just a conscious disregard of the risk, knowing it's wrong but
doing it anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   More than a dozen family members and friends of the Long Island
victims attended Monday's arraignment. They said they were pleased
with the tough charges brought against Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not an accident. It was murder,'' said the Rev. James
Trent, the grandfather of one of the victims, Pascal Lee Trent, 16,
of Riverhead.
</P>
<P>
   The other two people who died in the crash were Matthew
Marcotrigiano, 21, of Wading River, N.Y., and Norma Vestal, 17, of
Riverhead.

STREAK HAS PROVEN IT'S A FLYERS' MARKET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Of course, if they bomb once again in the
playoffs, none of what the Philadelphia Flyers have done in the
past two months will matter much at all.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, however, it's getting a little scary.
</P>
<P>
   The Flyers visit the Anaheim Mighty Ducks on Wednesday and the
Los Angeles Kings the next night, and right now they are the
hottest team in hockey, and that includes the Colorado Avalanche,
12-game winning streak and all.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're intimidating by their skill,'' Kings center Ray
Ferraro said of the Flyers, who are 16-1-7 in their past 24 games.
``You know if you don't play very well against them, they're going
to hand it to you. You have to respect them. But you can't give
them any more room than anyone else. If you do, they're better than
most teams and they'll shove it down your throat.''
</P>
<P>
   The Flyers have been shoving it down people's throats since this
remarkable stretch began with a victory at Toronto on Dec. 12.
Philadelphia began a 15-game unbeaten streak that night, lost at
home to the Maple Leafs on Jan. 16, and are unbeaten in eight games
since then.
</P>
<P>
   Impressive as it is that Eric Lindros is second in scoring with
70 points and that teammate John LeClair is tied for third with 66,
what is even more significant is that in terms of scoring at even
strength, Lindros and LeClair are first and second in the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   They have plenty of help in a deep lineup, and goalie John
Vanbiesbrouck has been everything Philadelphia hoped he would be
when the Flyers signed him last summer as a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I see,'' said Kings coach Larry Robinson, whose team lost
4-2 to the Flyers eight days ago, ``is that they've gone from being
a team that used to go into buildings and try to intimidate you
with big forwards, who could bang but weren't that gifted, to a
team with four balanced lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key to them is still Lindros and LeClair. You have to
respect that. But if you contain that line, you still have to worry
about their other players. You've got to be at the top of your game
against them. They don't have a lot of weaknesses.''
</P>
<P>
   Jolted bolts: Tampa Bay's miserable season hit a new low last
week when the Lightning allowed eight second-period goals in a 10-1
loss at Washington. The Capitals had 25 shots on goal in the period
and scored five of their goals in a 3:54 span.
</P>
<P>
   Jacques Demers, the Lightning's coach and general manager, had
the good fortune to miss the game because he was attending GM
meetings in Palm Springs. Associate coach Rick Paterson served as
the interim coach, a role in which he has posted a perfectly
horrible record of 0-10 over the past two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even know what to say anymore,'' said the Lightning's
Mikael Andersson. ``It's getting old. I've been here since the
beginning _ seven years _ and I can't ever remember it being this
bad. It was an embarrassment.''
</P>
<P>
   Iron Man: Detroit's Larry Murphy, who began his career with the
Kings in 1980-81, surpassed late Toronto great Tim Horton for games
played by a defenseman when he appeared in his 1,447th game last
week. He's missed only 26 games in his 19-year career.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no secret to it, I promise,'' Murphy said. ``I've been
through some injuries, but it's either been over the All-Star break
or something like that. It's always worked out where I haven't
missed too much. I've just been extremely fortunate.''
</P>
<P>
   Murphy has played seven seasons in which he didn't miss a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be that durable for that amount of time in this league is
very special,'' Boston defenseman Ray Bourque said. ``I know how
tough it is to keep your health in this game when you're getting
hit left and right and the wear and tear of the schedule and the
grind of things and what it takes to go out and compete every
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Murph has played one less year than I have and has played more
games than me, and I haven't missed all that many. To be where he
is now and the amount of years he's played is pretty scary.''
</P>
<P>
   Sitting Ducks: The Mighty Ducks have two marquee players in Paul
Kariya and Teemu Selanne. The Kings are still looking for one,
since Luc Robitaille for some strange reason doesn't seem to
qualify.
</P>
<P>
   There's been much talk about the Kings making a move to acquire
a gate attraction and little talk of the Ducks making a move, even
though their record isn't much better than the Kings'. But it
doesn't sound as if the Ducks are likely to make a significant
transaction before the March 23 trading deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ``For 365 days a year we try to improve the club,'' general
manager Pierre Gauthier said. ``I tell you today, patience is very
important. It's also a very tough thing _ patience _ because I have
emotions, too. I want to do something. But what can I do today that
can make the team better? A lot of times the best thing to do is
nothing.`
</P>
<P>
   Loose pucks: Buffalo's Matthew Barnaby has been the subject of
numerous trade rumors, and the No.1 rumormonger has been Barnaby
himself. He is likely to be traded, but perhaps not quite as
quickly as he'd like. Chicago, Detroit and Calgary are believed to
be among the interested.... The Sabres claim they are on pace to
lose $15 million this season and are looking to restructure their
lease at their county-owned arena.... Former Calgary Flame Hakan
Loob, who returned to his native Sweden in 1989 at age 28 only a
year after a 50-goal season, has a 17-year-old son, Henrik, who is
eligible for this year's draft.

TROUBLE IS NOTHING NEW AT A ROVER AUTO PLANT IN BRITAIN
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By ALAN COWELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONGBRIDGE, England _ If Rover Group PLC's sprawling auto
assembly plant here had a middle name, it would probably be
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   One of Britain's oldest auto plants, the factory first produced
a car in 1906. In more recent years, it has consistently failed to
surpass its annual production record. Sales of the midrange models
built here _ the Rover 200 and 400 _ have been hobbled by the
strength of the British pound, which makes exports more expensive
abroad and gives a competitive edge to imported rivals.
</P>
<P>
   With their collars turned up against gusting snow at the factory
gate Monday, some of the workers here said they had no idea how
long they would have jobs. The workers, a labor leader said, ``must
be dizzy with despondency.''
</P>
<P>
   The cause of their malaise is simple: Longbridge, situated on
430 acres on the outskirts of Birmingham in the English Midlands,
is the leader in losses among Rover's three assembly plants, and
its failure to turn a profit has turned into a crisis both for the
people who work here and those who own the plant, BMW AG in
Germany.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, a bitter boardroom dispute over Rover's losses and
BMW's strategy for its future led to the ouster of BMW's top two
executives, a move that stunned the usually staid world of German
business. One of those forced out was Bernd Pischetsrieder, BMW's
top executive, who had gambled and lost on being able to turn Rover
around.
</P>
<P>
   The ousters ignited speculation that BMW would be taken over by
a larger rival, but the company said Monday that it intended to
stay independent. BMW said the controlling Quandt family had
assured executives of its commitment to the company. Investors,
however, drove shares of BMW up 8.6 percent on the possibility of a
sale.
</P>
<P>
   BMW's multibillion-dollar investment here highlights the paradox
of investing in Britain: When times are good, foreign investment is
seen as a triumph for flexible, cheap labor, but when times turn
tough, the outsiders may be tempted to lead the retreat, as Siemens
AG did last fall when it closed a semiconductor plant.
</P>
<P>
   And when investment is trimmed, so are jobs, bringing
politicians and labor unions into the discussion.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Tony Blair is said to have raised the Longbridge
matter with Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder of Germany. Stephen Byers,
Britain's Trade and Industry Minister, called BMW executives in
Munich over the weekend before traveling here Monday to talk to the
local management about possible government aid worth $330 million _
the price BMW is seeking to develop a successor to the 200-400
models at Longbridge rather than at a cheaper plant in Hungary.
</P>
<P>
   British labor union representatives petitioned BMW to use
Longbridge for a new midrange car, and with so much political
artillery in play, they were ``reasonably optimistic'' that
Longbridge would be chosen, said John Partridge, a labor
representative for the Transport and General Workers Union.
</P>
<P>
   BMW is more reticent. The company declined to comment Monday on
reports that it had given itself two weeks to decide among various
options, including the continuing development at Longbridge of a
midrange successor to the 200 and the 400, a quest for a partner to
share the burden or a scaling back of its commitment.
</P>
<P>
   Few would say, though, that the plant could look forward to an
easy ride. Some analysts say Longbridge will ultimately shed 5,000
more jobs from its work force of 12,000 before the cost-cutting
ends.
</P>
<P>
   Late last year, Rover workers agreed to 2,500 job cuts among the
work force of 35,000 at all three plants as part of a deal to adopt
more flexible working hours in return for job security. Now they
wonder whether that accord was only a beginning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone's down,'' said one worker who, like others outside
the Longbridge plant Monday, spoke on the condition of anonymity.
``We had an agreement. Now we don't know if it's worth anything.''
</P>
<P>
   In part, the crisis has highlighted the patchiness of Rover's
record: While its successes in niche markets include sport utility
vehicles, Minis and MG sports cars, its mass-market 200 and 400
models have been poor performers. Its newest executive-range sedan,
the Rover 75 _ the first model designed and produced under BMW
ownership _ has just been introduced to generally good reviews but
at precisely the moment Rover's losses have forced BMW to scale
back its profit expectations.
</P>
<P>
   With Rover's losses thought to exceed $500 million in 1998, BMW
says its profit for the year will be less than its 1997 profit of
about $722 million, despite record sales of its high-margin 3-, 5-
and 7-series cars.
</P>
<P>
   So the question is: What went wrong with Pischetsrieder's plans
to make Rover a success?
</P>
<P>
   BMW bought Rover from British Aerospace PLC for $1.2 billion in
1994. The idea was to acquire one of the world's best-known sport
utility brands and extend BMW's range into cheaper market segments,
using Rover to penetrate where the upscale BMW brand would have
been diluted.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to some expectations, however, BMW was far less pushy
with its management of the British company.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the main problem,'' said Stephen Reitman, an auto
industry analyst at Merrill Lynch in London. ``They took too
hands-off an approach because they were too keen to preserve local
autonomy.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the bulk of BMW's investment, about $800 million a
year, went to a new design center and to plants in Oxford and
Solihull where Rover produces the new 75 and its Land Rover models,
including the remodeled Defender, the Range Rover and the smaller
Freelander, the most recent sport utility vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Very little of the investment, Reitman said, went to Longbridge,
which produces Minis, MG's and the 200-400 models, first introduced
in 1995. A new version of the Mini is scheduled to be introduced
next year and, according to Brian Johns, a Rover spokesman, ``it
will be produced at Longbridge; that hasn't altered.'' But the
question of what else will be built here is still unresolved.
</P>
<P>
   Rover's productivity, measured as vehicles produced per worker
each year, is one of the lowest in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to increase our productivity, and that's what the new
working arrangement is supposed to do,'' Johns, the Rover
spokesman, said, but he disputed the way productivity is measured
in other companies as ``misleading.''
</P>
<P>
   The stakes at Longbridge go higher than its work force. Some
50,000 jobs in the West Midlands components industry are said to
depend on the aging plant. ``It's the uncertainty that's killing
people at the moment,'' said Partridge, the union official. If the
plant closed, he said, `'it would be absolutely catastrophic.''

 &HT;    Cleveland to stock its team in today's expansion draft
 &HT;    By Chick Ludwig
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CANTON, Ohio _ It's the NFL's version of an archeological find
and Cleveland Browns Coach Chris Palmer is ready to do some heavy
excavating.
</P>
<P>
   His goal is to uncover some gems among the 150 veterans left
unprotected by their clubs when the Browns expansion draft unfolds
at 4 p.m. today at the Canton Civic Center.
</P>
<P>
   As the next step in the rebirth of pro football in Cleveland,
the Browns _ who make their NFL return Aug. 9 against Dallas in the
Hall of Fame game here _ must select between 30 and 42 players with
total salaries not to exceed 38 percent of the estimated $58
million salary cap. An existing club can recall one player from its
five-man list after one of its players is selected. After a second
player is selected from a club, that club can pull back both of its
remaining players.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer gave every indication that he may pass on most of the
high-priced players _ whose contracts the Browns would inherit _
and take younger, hungrier and cheaper talent as he stockpiles his
roster for the 1999 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The expansion draft is not going to give you anyone you're
going to write home about,'' Palmer said. ``The talent level will
not be what we want to start with. They're giving someone up, so
there is a problem there.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there are diamonds in the rough. We just have to be lucky
and hit on those guys. If they come in here, see an opportunity and
are treated right, they'll want to be part of the situation and
they'll step forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmer warned Browns fans not to get too excited about an
expansion list that includes nine players who have been selected to
a total of 32 Pro Bowls, and 13 former first-round draft picks. He
said he'd be happy to draft five guys who could make an impact in
'99.
</P>
<P>
   ``My message to those guys will be: `You're going to prove that
somebody made a mistake putting you on that board or they were
right,''' Palmer said. ``That's my job as a motivator. It's not
going to be a long message, but it's going to be to the point. You
can prove that team wrong, or prove them right.''
</P>
<P>
   The ex-Pro Bowlers on the list are Washington's trio of tailback
Terry Allen, cornerback Cris Dishman and quarterback Gus Frerotte;
Seattle center Kevin Glover; Dallas fullback Daryl Johnston; Green
Bay's kick returner Roell Preston and defensive end Reggie White;
Pittsburgh guard Will Wolford; and Denver defensive end Neil Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Denver cornerback Darrien Gordon, who had two interceptions in
the Broncos' 34-19 victory over Atlanta in Super Bowl XXXIII, and
White _ a 13-time Pro Bowler and the NFL's career sacks leader _
top the list of former first-round picks.
</P>
<P>
   The others are Seattle tailback Steve Broussard, Oakland's
defensive end Aundray Bruce and wide receiver Desmond Howard,
Jacksonville defensive back Deon Figures, Cincinnati linebacker
James Francis, Chicago.

 &HT;    Stewart set to impress in WC debut
 &HT;    By Ron Ware
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ Five days still remain before Tony Stewart
officially makes his NASCAR Winston Cup debut in the biggest race
on the schedule. But he's already learning exactly what it's like
spending life in the fast lane.
</P>
<P>
   And if he needed any reminding, there it was the other day in
the pages of the Charlotte Observer, his adopted hometown
newspaper. In a story previewing the Daytona 500 and the coming
season, the paper decided that unless the 27-year-old wins rookie
of the year honors, ``whispers of overrated might start.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart reacted in the same way anyone who has ever see him
hustle a midget around a Midwestern dirt track might expect, which
is to say his jaw jutted, a glint appeared in his eyes and you
half-wondered if he was going to take off after the writer right
then, a la A.J. Foyt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just gives me something to shoot for,'' he responded, the
words coming in a rush. ``I know I have to prove myself. There's a
lot of people in this part of the country that don't know a lot
about me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just have to go out and do what I've done in every other
series I've been in.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't bother me.''
</P>
<P>
   So there. If you don't like him, fine, cram it up your tailpipe.
But keep those stopwatches handy.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, the 1997 Indy Racing League champion, promises to do
every he can to win friends and influence people in Sunday's 41st
Daytona 500 (12:15 p.m., CBS-TV). He surprisingly qualified on the
outside of the front row at 194.599 mph, alongside none other than
Jeff Gordon, flashing the talent former NFL coach Joe Gibbs spotted
when he hired him to drive his No. 20 Home Depot Pontiac as a
teammate to Bobby Labonte.
</P>
<P>
   But Stewart, whose brash confidence often is mistaken for
arrogance, knows he still has a lot to learn, especially in driving
a 3,400-pound stock car in the draft. Gordon warned him that
drivers like Dale Earnhardt will be trying to ``school him,'' and
he quickly agreed, joking that he was trying to figure out how to
mount a pad and pencil in the car so that he can take notes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need to take this first season to gain as much knowledge as
I can,'' Stewart said. ``I don't want to be the guy who causes the
20-car pileup on Sunday. I'm going to need to be real patient. If
that means going to the back and coming back up later in the race,
I'll do that if I have to. I want to be around at the end of the
race.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that he'll be driving like the typical Floridian.
</P>
<P>
   ``I might be a rookie in Winston Cup racing,'' said Stewart, who
started out in go-karts and won four USAC national championships on
the way up, ``but this is my 20th year. When they drop the green
flag, I'll go.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart is one of six drivers who'll chase rookie honors this
season. His chief rivals are Elliott Sadler, 23, who's with the
fabled but fading Wood Brothers, and Roy ``Buckshot'' Jones, 28,
driving for a team assembled by his father, Billy, who's already
poured an astonishing $14 million into his career.
</P>
<P>
   None of the others qualified better than 29th for Sunday's race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I'm the underdog to Stewart, honestly,'' Sadler
said. ``He's done amazing things in his IRL career and in midgets
and so forth. I'm a big Tony Stewart fan.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really think until you get a couple races in that
you'll have a favorite (for the rookie award),'' Jones said. ``But
Tony, coming right out of the box like that, he's sure to be the
fan favorite.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he plans to compete again this year in the Indianapolis
500 _ he'll also race the same day in the Coca-Cola 600 at
Charlotte _ Stewart intends to spent the rest of his career in
Winston Cup.
</P>
<P>
   As much as he wants to impress on Sunday, he also wants to earn
the respect of his fellow drivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spent a lot of time working my way up to this point,'' he
said. ``This is the best series in the world, and I plan to be here
a long time. This is where I want to spend the next 20-30 years.''

 &HT;    NASCAR NOTES: Marcis improves Daytona chances
 &HT;    By Ron Ware
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ Of all the current streaks in big-time
stock car racing _ from Jeff Gordon's two straight titles to
Michael Waltrip's 394-race winless drought _ one of the most
remarkable has sprung from one of the least likely sources.
</P>
<P>
   For 31 consecutive years, Dave Marcis, now 57 and still
virtually broke, has qualified for the Daytona 500. And after
Tuesday's second round of time trials for the 41st edition of
NASCAR's premier event, there's a much better chance the streak
won't go bust.
</P>
<P>
   Marcis, driving the No. 71 Team Realtree Chevrolet that he owns,
jumped to 23rd overall after turning a lap of 192.794 mph at
Daytona International Speedway, moving up nine spots. Under the
unique qualifying format used here, that likely will be good enough
to earn him a spot in Sunday's 12:15 p.m. race, even if he falters
in Thursday's Twin 125s.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something I want to continue if I can,'' said Marcis,
whose streak becomes even more remarkable considering he qualified
for only 13 of 33 Winston Cup races last season. ``My goal is just
to get (the car) better if I can.''
</P>
<P>
   Only Jeff Gordon and Tony Stewart, who qualified 1-2 in
Saturday's first round, have clinched their starting positions. All
other drivers faced a choice of standing on their time or
forfeiting it and requalifying Tuesday or today. The speeds
determine the starting order for Thursday's qualifying races, with
the top 14 finishers in each filling positions 3-30 on Sunday. The
remainder of the 43-car lineup will consist of the six fastest
qualifiers who otherwise didn't make it, plus seven provisionals,
based on 1998 car owner points.
</P>
<P>
   Marcis, who won five Winston Cup races between 1975-82, picked
up 2/10ths of a second over his first-round speed of 191.955 but
was looking for more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I doubt that that's good enough, but it could be,'' he said,
erring on the side of caution. ``It depends on how clean the 125s
are.''
</P>
<P>
   Eight drivers participated in second-round qualifying, with
Steve Park inching up one spot to 25th and Derrick Cope moving up
six places to 31st after leasing an engine from Team Sabco. Making
insignificant progress were Robert Pressley, Dick Trickle, Ted
Musgrave, Jim Sauter (in Marcis' backup car) and Norm Benning.
</P>
<P>
   STRAIT SHOOTING: Bob Strait's spirits were sagging following
Sunday's ARCA race, but they may be getting a boost. He said it's
``90 percent certain'' that he'll attempt to make his Winston Cup
debut in the April 25 DieHard 500 at Talladega, driving a car
fielded by ARCA veteran Mark Thompson. His brother, Don, is co-crew
chief for Thompson's team.
</P>
<P>
   Strait, who drives for Harmony's Jack Bowsher on the ARCA
circuit, owns 14 career wins in that series and finished 11th in
the NASCAR Truck standings in 1995. But he's never driven in a
Winston Cup race.
</P>
<P>
   ``That'd be pretty neat at my age, wouldn't it?'' said Strait,
who'll turn 50 two weeks before the Talladega race. ``I drove in
the Twin 125s here one year (1992), but I've driven been in a
Winston Cup points race.''
</P>
<P>
   Dick Trickle could serve as Strait's inspiration. He was 48 when
he won Winston Cup rookie of the year honors in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ON TO ATLANTA: Josh Baltes has found his sugar daddy _ in his
own household.
</P>
<P>
   The Dayton, Ohio native's season was in doubt following his
crash in practice for Sunday's ARCA race, but his father, Terry,
said the cash-strapped team definitely would compete March 12 at
Atlanta Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of their season remains in doubt, however, unless
sponsorship is secured.
</P>
<P>
   Baltes, who relocated to Mooresville, N.C., in December, was the
1997 ARCA rookie of the year but is still searching for his first
ARCA victory. He's driving for a new team headed by Tom Sokolosky,
who guided Tim Steele to two of his three series titles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you how thrilled and excited I am to be a part of
this organization,'' said Baltes, grandson of Eldora Speedway owner
Earl Baltes. ``They're kind of going out on a limb with me. (I)
haven't proved a lot in this series.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think now I've got the team to do it with.''

CRITERIA PROPOSED FOR ISSUING OF INTERNET ADDRESSES
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va., Calif.)  (nk) 
 By JERI CLAUSING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Companies wanting a piece of the lucrative business
of issuing Internet addresses will need at least $100,000 in the
bank, $500,000 in liability insurance and a proven computer
infrastructure, under minimum requirements proposed Monday by the
nonprofit corporation that has been tapped to take over
administration of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, ``domain registration,'' as the issuing of Internet
addresses is known, has been the government-sanctioned monopoly of
Network Solutions Inc., a Virginia-based company that grew rich on
the business.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentally, Network Solutions priced a new stock offering
Monday. In the more than a year that it has taken the Clinton
administration and the nonprofit Internet Corporation for Assigned
Names and Numbers to open the business to competition, Network
Solutions has set up an international network of partners to
administer its domain registration business around the world.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed guidelines were announced just as Network Solutions
completed what is expected to be the largest secondary stock
offering ever by an Internet company. The offering of 4.58 million
shares was priced Monday by J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co. to open Tuesday on
Nasdaq at $170 a share. The sale is expected to bring in about $780
million for Network Solutions' parent company, the Science
Applications International Corp., which will reduce its ownership
in the company to 45 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1993, Network Solutions, based in Herndon, Va., has had
the exclusive worldwide right to assign Internet addresses that end
in .com, .net and .org, charging $70 to register a domain name for
two years. The result has been phenomenal growth, with net income
in the first nine months of 1998 growing threefold, to $7.5
million. Although 1998 revenues have not yet been reported,
analysts have predicted they could hit $90 million, compared with
$6 million, $18 million and $45 million, respectively, in the
previous three years.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, the nonprofit corporation, known as Icann, also posted
competing sets of proposed bylaws for the supporting organization
being formed to help the nonprofit corporation decide when and how
to add new ``top-level domains'' _ the three-letter suffixes of
Internet addresses, like the popular .com.
</P>
<P>
   The guidelines and bylaws have been posted for public comment.
Final versions are expected to be approved by Icann's board of
directors at its next meeting, to be held in Singapore March 2
through 4.
</P>
<P>
   Icann's initial goal is to introduce five competitors to Network
Solutions by the end of April. That test is expected to last about
two months. Then Icann plans to let an unlimited number of
companies around the world participate in the registry.
</P>
<P>
   But the board first must decide a number of other issues,
including how it will pick the first five companies and how much
they will have to pay Network Solutions for its operating of the
main registry, the worldwide list of addresses that directs
Internet traffic around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Esther Dyson, interim chairman of Icann, said the
board would likely hold an international lottery to pick the five
test companies. That option, however, is being reconsidered because
of opposition from a number of groups, including the European
Union, which fears that domain registration will not be
geographically balanced.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dyson said the board wanted to insure that the first five
included a variety of big and small companies from different parts
of the world.
</P>
<P>
   The guidelines say the primary criteria for selecting
participants for the test phase ``would be the applicant's
technical and business capabilities to support the test and its
willingness to commit the resources and to collaborate closely.''
</P>
<P>
   Secondary considerations ``include the extent to which the
applicant's participation would promote early robust competition,
wide geographic availability of domain name registration services,
and accommodation of alternative business models and types.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposed guidelines are outlined by Icann in a 30-plus page
document posted on its Web site after the stock markets closed
Monday. In addition to minimum technical, operational and financial
issues, the criteria also deal with protections against fraud and
infringement of intellectual property rights; data security,
privacy and special technical requirements to protect Internet
stability and operational integrity.
</P>
<P>
   Icann has proposed that applicants who want to compete in the
test phase pay a $2,500 application fee. That would drop to $1,000
when competition is opened to an unlimited number of competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Companies would then be required to pay an additional $3,000 to
$6,000 accreditation fee, and would give Icann $1 a year for each
domain name registered. Network Solutions last year registered
about 1.9 million new domain names.
</P>
<P>
   The monetary requirements are likely to raise protests from
smaller Internet groups who fear that Icann is being driven by
large corporate interests. However, Ms. Dyson said that the board
was trying to ``make it pretty easy to be one of these people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We recognize that implementing changes in the domain name
system will be a contentious issue,'' she said. ``The point is to
make the transition fair and the results fair. As long as everyone
knows the rules and can play on the same terms, we will have
achieved that. As the initial board considers comments on the
guidelines, we will work hard with the Internet community to
develop guidelines that strike everyone as reasonable, sound and
transparent.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Bura, president of Alldomains.com, a Pleasant Hill,
Calif., company that plans to apply to be a test registrar, said
the guidelines and capital requirements looked ``doable.''

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Feb. 9: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In death, King Hussein was able to do once more what he often
did while living _ draw together divided men. On Monday, in Amman,
Jordan, men whom the most pressing diplomacy could scarcely gather
passed one after another before the king's coffin, acknowledging,
even in their differences, the power of the peacemaking man. The
Syrian president, Hafez Assad, paused at the coffin, as did the
Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu; the president of Egypt,
Hosni Mubarak; Bill Clinton, and three former American presidents.
Boris Yeltsin, weakened by illness, paid a brief visit. Behind a
military band and an honor guard, that extraordinary group walked
together through the cold, bleached light of Amman. They did not
succeed in giving the funeral pomp. They were captured instead by
its silent, eloquent modesty, more powerful in its way than pomp
could ever be.
</P>
<P>
   What mattered in Amman was the keen emotion of the moment, and,
no less, the spectacle of seeing such an unrivaled array of
powerful faces. It was instructive too to watch those men in the
receiving line where King Abdullah accepted their condolences. Some
approached with a deep courtesy that was nonetheless informal,
kissing Abdullah on both cheeks, grasping his forearm or his
shoulder while they shook hands and talked. Others seemed to equate
the ceremony of death with an almost bankerly sense of formality.
</P>
<P>
   None of this, perhaps, was done in quite the way the women would
have done it, who were required by Islamic law to mourn in private.
The custom the men enforced is an ancient one. But as the
procession moved through Amman, it was impossible not to think of
Queen Noor, standing silently as the body of her husband was borne
away. Archaic as the separation of the sexes in mourning seems to
Westerners, it also captured the pure archaism of death. Someone
had been left behind, and for a moment we witnessed her
acknowledgment of that fact.

Monday for President Clinton in the Senate impeachment trial, so it
is understandable that his performance moved her to hyperbole and
tears. ``I think he has a sense of drama that's extraordinary,''
she said. ``Laurence Olivier couldn't do it any better.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Carson does understand dramatic flair. She was Leonard
Bernstein's longtime press agent, which is what they called them
before the word publicist walked in on high heels. But when she was
called the other day for an interview about her son and her life,
she declined at first. ``I'll just be a maternal bore,'' she said.
With cajoling, she relented. Mrs. Carson turned out to be maternal,
but not a bore.
</P>
<P>
   The most interesting thing she said, before we get to how she
raised a White House counsel, was that Theodore Dreiser once made a
pass at her. It was the mid-1940s, Mrs. Carson was handling the
press for the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters,
and Dreiser, who was in his 70s, the author of ``An American
Tragedy'' and ``Sister Carrie,'' was there for an award. He took an
instant liking to Mrs. Carson, who was in her 30s and sharp.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was so cornball, I can't tell you,'' Mrs. Carson said. ``He
wrote me the corniest letter, and made the corniest pass at me.
Clumsy, I should say, rather than corny. But we girls knew how to
take care of that in those days. We didn't call it sexual
harassment. But you know something? He made a pass at everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Carson, 87, is now a consultant to Amberson, the Bernstein
production company, and still represents conductor Michael Tilson
Thomas. ``My other genius,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In the New York music world, people call her a force of nature.
``Somewhat larger than life,'' said her son, Ruff, on Sunday. Mrs.
Carson was also the press representative for the Metropolitan Opera
under Edward Johnson and Sir Rudolf Bing, and so took her son to
see ``Aida,'' his first opera, when he was 5. ``I got to spend my
Saturday afternoons behind the scenes at the Met,'' Ruff said.
</P>
<P>
   It comes as no surprise to his mother that Ruff, in a passing
mention in the Senate to Linda Tripp on Jan. 19, wickedly referred
to Iago's use of a handkerchief to betray Desdemona.
</P>
<P>
   ``My friends called and said, `I see Chuck is quoting
Shakespeare,' '' Mrs. Carson said. ``I said that I didn't think he
was referring to Shakespeare. I think he was referring to Verdi.
Because he knows the opera `Othello.' ''
</P>
<P>
   (Ruff said his reference ``encompassed both,'' but that his
pronunciation of Desdemona was from the play rather than from the
Italian opera. Then he said, ``but this gets too fancy.'')
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Carson spoke in her Upper East Side apartment, which is
filled with Japanese screen paintings and dreamy pictures of a
young Leonard Bernstein. She wore a sweater with tigerlike stripes
of taupe and black, had a theatrical manner and looked good.
``Thanks, I need that,'' she said when told. ``My memory's fine and
dandy, but I can't see very well.'' She has macular degeneration, a
progressive eye disorder. She loves music and musicians _ ``they're
hearty and lusty'' _ but is private about her own life.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a sketchy outline. She was born in Salt Lake City, where
her father owned a small department store; moved to Ohio when she
was 9, majored in political science at the University of Toledo and
received a master's degree in social administration at Ohio State.
She married and was divorced from Charles Carson, a reporter and
editor in Cleveland; found work as a press agent in New York, then
married and was divorced from Carl N. Ruff, also a press agent who
died last year. She has two children: Charles Ruff, 59, who is the
son of Carson but was adopted by Carl Ruff, and Carla, her daughter
with Carl Ruff.
</P>
<P>
   Bringing up Charles was easy. ``Chuck read at an early age, and
that was the blessing of all time,'' Mrs. Carson said. She saw to
his education, got a good housekeeper and did not feel guilty about
working. Ruff started out in public school on the Upper East Side
in the 1940s and by 12 was at boarding school at Phillips Academy
in Andover, Mass. He went on to Swarthmore College and Columbia
University School of Law. He knew Leonard Bernstein from childhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lenny used to come over to the apartment and play the piano,
and play Chopin, and Debussy, and then jazz,'' Mrs. Carson said.
``He was wonderful. And he was wonderful with my son.''
</P>
<P>
   It was in 1965, while teaching in Africa, that Ruff, by then
married and awaiting the birth of his first child, came down with a
poliolike virus that has left him in a wheelchair ever since. ``He
was taken to a hospital in the wilds of Liberia,'' Mrs. Carson
said. ``I learned of it through a ham operator on Long Island.''
</P>
<P>
   Her reaction was maternal. ``I did a couple of things,'' she
said. ``I went to woodworking class, which was physical labor. And
I took up golf, which is hitting a ball very hard against the wall.
It makes a big noise.'' A pause. ``Which is better than hitting
people.'' Another pause. ``He's handled it extremely well. Better
than I.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Carson has been spellbound watching her son's professorial,
emotional and at times sarcastic performances in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say you must be very proud,'' she said. ``I'm bursting
with it.''

ETHICS PANEL WILL REPORT ON OLYMPIC PAYMENTS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By JERE LONGMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ Three years from the start of the 2002 Winter
Games, local Olympic officials Monday prepared for a watershed week
in which they will detail improprieties involved in securing the
Olympics and perhaps name a leader who can begin to repair the
tarnished image of their Games.
</P>
<P>
   A lengthy report by the local Olympic organizing committee's
internal ethics panel is scheduled for release on Tuesday morning.
According to Olympic officials who have been told about the report,
it was expected to say that there was limited knowledge among Salt
Lake City officials about improper cash payments, tuition aid,
medical treatment, jobs and lavish gifts provided to members of the
International Olympic Committee and their families.
</P>
<P>
   An official who saw the report said Monday that it would
primarily target two top officials of the bid committee, Tom Welch
and Dave Johnson, and accuse them of hidden payments and deceptive
practices that kept other members of the committee from knowing
what was going on.
</P>
<P>
   Such a conclusion was foreshadowed last week by Utah Gov.
Michael O. Leavitt. Without naming names, the Governor portrayed
the payment of improper inducements as a ``pattern of deception''
by a small group of rogue officials of the bid committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had to hide it, because I didn't see it and I don't know
at this point of anybody else who did,'' Leavitt said at a news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   Leavitt has also acknowledged that the report would not provide
a complete picture of the corruption scandal. The five-person
ethics panel, headed by Gordon R. Hall, a former chief justice of
the Utah Supreme Court, did not have subpoena power, and some top
Olympic officials, including the bid committee's chief
administrative officer, declined to testify.
</P>
<P>
   Welch was president of the bid committee and Johnson head of its
international relations. Both Welch and Johnson have resigned, but
they have denied wrongdoing and have said that details of the
aggressive campaign to win the Games were widely known. Welch has
said that Leavitt, Salt Lake City Mayor Deedee Corradini and Frank
Joklik, the chairman of the bid committee, were all aware of at
least some aspects of the extravagant efforts to secure the Games.
</P>
<P>
   Documents of the Salt Lake bid committee have shown that
programs for tuition aid and grants to national Olympic committees
were detailed in open budget documents. Leavitt has acknowledged
giving out expensive gifts to IOC members. But he also said he did
not know of rules limiting the price of gifts or that the bid
committee had made cash payments or paid for scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times reported last week that Joklik and another
member of the board of trustees of the bid committee wrote letters
seeking employment for the husband of an international committee
member from Finland.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to say Welch and Johnson were off the
reservation, but it's going to be hard to say that no one had any
idea what was going on and they engaged in a cover-up,'' said
Stephen Pace, who heads a group called Utahans for Responsible
Public Spending and who has been a longtime critic of the Salt Lake
City bid process.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the IOC and the U.S. Olympic Committee scrambled
Monday to obtain advance notice of the contents of the ethics
panel's report. Richard Pound, the Montreal attorney who is
handling the investigation of the IOC's involvement in the scandal,
said that he would not conclude his investigation until the Salt
Lake City report is issued.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen international committee members have so far been
implicated in the scandal. Six have been expelled, three have
resigned, three remain under investigation, one has been issued a
warning and one has died. The cost for lavish favors, as well as
legitimate travel and accommodation expenses, may have reached $3
million.
</P>
<P>
   Of the three members remaining under investigation, the most
powerful is Kim Un Yong of South Korea, a member of the IOC's
executive board who has often been mentioned as a possible
successor as president to Juan Antonio Samaranch.
</P>
<P>
   Kim's future is now in jeopardy and a stinging rebuke of his
actions by the Salt Lake City ethics panel could lead the IOC to
try to expel him. Kim is not likely to go quietly, and his
departure could lead to political infighting and charges and
countercharges of further improper conduct.
</P>
<P>
   It has previously been reported that Kim's son was employed by a
local satellite communications company, which was reimbursed for
his salary by the Salt Lake City bid committee.
</P>
<P>
   David Simmons, the former chairman of Keystone Communications,
which has since been sold, said Monday that the bid committee paid
about $45,000 of the $75,000 salary that Kim's son received for a
year's work and that the rest was covered by other local companies.
The amounts were first reported Monday by USA Today.
</P>
<P>
   The ethics panel report is also expected to deal with subjects
such as other jobs provided for relatives of international
committee members; whether money intended for tuition aid was used
for other purposes; whether money was pocketed from airline-ticket
reimbursement schemes; the extent of lavish gift-giving, and
conflicts of interest that existed among members of the bid
committee.
</P>
<P>
   The appearance of conflicts were underscored by an outside audit
performed last August by Deloitte &AMP; Touche. The audit showed out
that approximately $50 million of a $68.3 million commitment for
construction and professional services is with entities controlled
by individuals who are, or who have officers who are, members of
the organizing committee's board of trustees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prevailing opinion is that the report will implicate
people we already know about, under the theory that if you get rid
of them, you solve the problem,'' said one investigator, speaking
on the condition of anonymity. ``But that doesn't solve the
systemic problem. The IOC is set up in a structure of quid pro quo
and patronage. There are no controls in place, no accountability.
That is what really has to change.''
</P>
<P>
   Also this week, the Salt Lake Organizing Committee is expected
to undergo structural changes designed to increase representation
by community members and athletes, to reduce secrecy and to create
more reliable oversight. The organizing committee is expected to be
expanded from 33 to 50 or 51 members, though some officials have
complained that its size will make the committee too unwieldy.
</P>
<P>
   A new president of the organizing committee could also be named
this week. Joklik resigned on Jan. 8, but is remaining in the
position until a successor can be found. The leading candidate is
Mitt Romney, 51, the son of the former Michigan governor George W.
Romney and a political aspirant himself who lost a U.S. Senate race
to Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   But anyone who takes over the organizing committee must be
prepared for further buffeting. The U.S. Justice Department is also
investigating the scandal, and its results are not expected for
five or six months. If criminal wrongdoing is found, Salt Lake City
would suffer another blow to its image, public confidence could
wane and sponsors would become even more nervous than they are now.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Museum of the City of New York hung a painting of
Andrew Foster Esq. on Monday morning with an unusual amount of
fanfare, considering that the mid-19th-century portrait is a lot
like 100 or so others owned by the museum. Several visitors, two
photographers and the museum's director, Robert R. Macdonald, were
on hand when workers placed the portrait in a light blue gallery on
the second floor. It was too early for Champagne, but there was
coffee, breakfast rolls and speeches.
</P>
<P>
   When Foster was last seen, in July 1997, he was homeless. The
painting _ worn, punctured and loose on its stretcher _ had been
rescued six months earlier from a trash pile on East 65th Street by
John W. Nichols, the director of museum services for the American
Federation of the Arts, a nonprofit group that organizes art
exhibitions.
</P>
<P>
   Nichols had noticed, inscribed on the back, Foster's name, the
date 1848 and the mark of the renowned portrait studio of Samuel
Lovett Waldo and William Jewett (many of whose works are owned by
museums, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art). When he
researched Foster, he discovered that he was one of the wealthiest
New Yorkers of his era.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Nichols found no takers when he tried to sell the work at
auction or donate it to several museums, including the Museum of
the City of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated, he mentioned his story to a reporter for The New
York Times, which ran an article about it. At the time, Barbara
Ball Buff, a curator at the Museum of the City of New York, said:
``It's one of the more beautiful Waldo and Jewett paintings. Sadly,
we can't take anything in that condition.''
</P>
<P>
   No one wanted to spend the cost of conservation, estimated to be
at least $3,000.
</P>
<P>
   But Foster got another chance to become a museum piece when
Margaret Holben Ellis, chairwoman of the Conservation Center at the
Institute of Fine Arts at New York University, read the article.
``I remember thinking it would be perfect for the Museum of the
City of New York,'' she said. ``I have very loyal feelings for that
museum. I had worked there when I was in college.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ellis called Jan Ramirez, the museum's deputy director for
programs and collections. She volunteered to have a student repair
the painting, free, if Nichols would agree to donate it to the
museum.
</P>
<P>
   He did, and Elise Effmann, a third-year graduate student, got to
work. She carefully repaired the tears, stabilized the paint to
prevent further flaking, filled in the areas where paint had been
lost and added new canvas to the painting's edges so it could be
restretched.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Ms. Buff and others at the museum were doing
research. They found that Foster had lived in a house on Bowling
Green in lower Manhattan near Stephen Whitney, a cotton trader
whose American Empire-style furniture is on display at the museum.
</P>
<P>
   They also discovered that although Bowling Green had only about
dozen houses at the time, the museum owns a Waldo and Jewett
portrait of another neighbor, Peter Remsen.
</P>
<P>
   Foster's portrait now hangs around the corner and down the hall
from the Whitney period alcove; Remsen's likeness, now in storage,
will be hung near Foster's. ``It's a reassembling of the
neighborhood,'' Ms. Ramirez said. ``The painting was destined to be
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Macdonald, who was furious when he learned that his staff had
initially rejected the painting, was buoyant Monday as he thanked
Nichols with a seal created for the museum's 75th anniversary and a
catalog of Berenice Abbott's photographs of New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the years a lot of things have been abandoned on the
streets of New York, including people,'' he said. ``But this was a
great moment of being able to save a painting of some consequence.
And it is a great example of collaboration among institutions and a
testament to the importance of conservators to museums.''
</P>
<P>
   Nichols, who visited the conservators several times, marveled at
Foster's new appearance. ``So much was revealed by their work,'' he
said, pointing out the initials on Foster's cane, the veins in his
hand and the column behind him.
</P>
<P>
   To the museum, the story seems so compelling, in fact, that it
is constructing an exhibition on its Web site about the painting's
history. It is set to be available on Friday at www.mcny.org under
``Behind the Scenes.'' Part 2 of the story, illustrating the
portrait's conservation, will go up later this year.

IMMIGRANT'S DEATH IN DETENTION PROMPTS NEW CRITICISM
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By MIRTA OJITO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The death of a Dominican man last month at a
detention center in lower Manhattan has prompted advocates for
immigrants to raise questions once again about the conditions in
which immigrants are held in the New York region and elsewhere in
the country.
</P>
<P>
   After a month of tests, the authorities revealed last week that
Miguel A. Valoy-Nunez, a seemingly healthy 40-year-old awaiting
deportation, died of pneumonia and a viral infection two days after
he first complained of chest pain and a consistent cough. Nurses at
the immigration detention center on Varick Street treated him as if
he had a cold and he was never checked by a doctor, federal health
officials have said.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Valoy-Nunez's death _ the first at an immigration
detention center _ was from a treatable disease prompted advocates
to renew their complaints against not only the way the Immigration
and Naturalization Service treats detainees but also the practice
of detention itself.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers and advocates for immigrants have been particularly
concerned with detention issues since a federal law that mandates
the detention of all noncitizens who commit deportable crimes went
into effect last fall. Since then, jails and detention centers have
been filled to capacity and, sometimes, beyond.
</P>
<P>
   Overcrowding has become such an issue for the INS that
immigration officials said last week that some of the immigrants
who were convicted of less serious crimes were likely to be
released soon to free up space.
</P>
<P>
   Those who are released will await deportation at home, and
immigration officials acknowledged that some of them may flee.
Although the releases are contrary to the law, the agency's hands
are tied, said Russell A. Bergeron, an INS spokesman in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are only mandated to do what we can do with the resources
we have,'' he said. ``We simply don't have the space to detain all
the criminal immigrants we encounter.''
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, 93 percent of the beds the INS uses for the
detention of immigrants are occupied. In the Eastern region, which
includes New York and New Jersey, 100 percent are occupied,
Bergeron said.
</P>
<P>
   Overcrowding has resulted in a host of problems for the INS. In
the last few months alone, well over 100 detainees at various
immigration centers in the New York region have staged hunger
strikes, several have attempted suicide, and a few have had
confrontations with guards.
</P>
<P>
   The increasing number of detainees has not led the authorities
to assign more medical personnel to detention centers in the New
York region, said Ada Rivera, medical director for the U.S. Public
Health Service's division of immigration health service, which
cares for immigrants in detention.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The center on Varick Street, where Valoy-Nunez was taken, is
staffed with registered nurses around the clock, plus a doctor, a
physician's assistant and a pharmacist during office hours. After
office hours and on the weekends, doctors are on call and at least
one nurse remains in the clinic per shift. That number of employees
is adequate for up to 450 detainees, Rivera said. The Varick
center's maximum average daily population in the last three years
has never topped 195; last week there were 155 detainees, 10 more
than its capacity.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time that concerns have been raised about
the Varick Street center. A 1992 study of the facility by the
American Civil Liberties Union in New York found medical care there
deficient.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is, what kind of system is there in place to
avoid this sort of thing from happening again?'' said Judy
Rabinovitz, an ACLU lawyer. ``Does someone have to die for us to
see some kind of reaction?''
</P>
<P>
   Valoy-Nunez, a legal resident of the United States since 1980,
arrived at Varick Street on Dec. 28 after serving seven months on
Rikers Island on a misdemeanor drug conviction. In September 1997,
the police found a tiny amount of heroin in his home, according to
his lawyer, Sanford Talk. Valoy-Nunez's crime rendered him
deportable under new federal laws that make the possession of
drugs, except for a small amount of marijuana, a deportable crime
for noncitizens.
</P>
<P>
   Five days after arriving at the detention center, Valoy-Nunez
developed a fever and a severe cough. Two days later he was dead.
His widow, Anna Valoy-Nunez, blames neglect. Had he been taken to a
hospital, as the couple had repeatedly asked his jailers to do, he
would have lived, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't get the right treatment, that's all,'' Mrs.
Valoy-Nunez, 41, said, drying her tears in the dining room of her
apartment in the Borough Park section of Brooklyn. ``He belonged in
a hospital and they refused to listen.''
</P>
<P>
   Health officials deny that Valoy-Nunez's death was caused by
lack of medical care. The Public Health Service is investigating
the case, and has found no wrongdoing so far, according to Dr. Gene
Migliaccio, director of the division of immigration health
services. His death, Migliaccio said, has baffled the staff.
</P>
<P>
   On the weekend before his death, Valoy-Nunez was checked 10
times during 36 hours by nurses who gave him over-the-counter cold
medicines. On Monday, Jan. 4, during regular clinic hours, a
physician's assistant thought he heard an unusual noise in
Valoy-Nunez's lungs and ordered blood work and an X-ray. But it was
too late; Valoy-Nunez died shortly afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors at the Public Health Service say they do not know
whether Valoy-Nunez's life could have been saved if a doctor had
actually checked him when he first complained of feeling ill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hindsight is 20-20,'' Rivera said. ``Could he be alive today
if a doctor had seen him? That's an impossible question.''
</P>
<P>
   But that is the question that keeps Mrs. Valoy-Nunez awake at
night, staring at the urn next to her bed where she keeps her
husband's ashes. Because deportation to the Dominican Republic
seemed inevitable before Valoy-Nunez's death, the family had
already made plans to move there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We dreamed of a house in the capital and opening a business, a
hair salon,'' she said. ``We would have followed him.''

MOISO FEELING ROUGHED UP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Bruins face their most difficult challenge of
the season Thursday at Stanford with one of their best players in
poor form and poor health.
</P>
<P>
   Jerome Moiso is beaten up and it shows.
</P>
<P>
   A 6-foot-10 freshman from Guadeloupe who attended high school in
France, Moiso has a skinny frame and a finesse game. The Pac-10's
rugged schedule and physical play have left him bruised and
battered. He has developed tendinitis in his right foot and felt a
few twinges in his left foot, as well.
</P>
<P>
   The effects are apparent: After scoring 68 points in a four-game
span (USC, Louisville and the Washington schools) Moiso scored just
11 points last weekend against the Oregon schools.
</P>
<P>
   Limited practice time has disrupted his conditioning and timing.
His shooting accuracy has suffered. His decisions are wrong.
Everything is a struggle. The game has suddenly gotten difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thinking about (the foot) too much and that's taking me
out of my game,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Can he get it back? For UCLA to maintain its current pace and
thrive in the NCAA Tournament, he'd better. When in sync, Moiso is
a nearly impossible matchup for opponents: He has the wingspan of a
7-footer, the athleticism of a small forward and the jump shot of a
guard.
</P>
<P>
   It's no coincidence the Bruins' best games _ Kentucky, Arizona,
Louisville _ were also Moiso's best games. If he struggles
Thursday, if he's timid and does not shoot well, if he falters on
defense and refuses to rebound, his team might struggle, as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope to be ready,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So do the Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   __ In reserve: The injuries to Moiso and center Dan Gadzuric
(knee tendinitis) are not as crippling as they would have been in
recent years when the Bruins had a thin bench. This season, Travis
Reed and Matt Barnes provide adequate depth.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, this is UCLA's deepest team since 1995, when the Bruins
won the national title.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I like is I don't feel we're going to get blown out by
48,'' coach Steve Lavin said. ``I don't feel like the bottom is
going to fall out if the Scotch tape breaks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not one player, one foul-out, or one suspension from
getting blitzed by 38 or 40.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Coming home: It's a big weekend for freshman guard Ray Young,
an Alameda native who considered Stanford and Cal before choosing
UCLA. Young expects to have 40 to 50 friends and family members at
the Cal game Saturday at the Coliseum Arena in Oakland, a few miles
from his house.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking forward to seeing my family,'' he said. ``Even the
older guys talk about how they like to go home.''

WIN FOR DUNN ENDS NIGHTMARE RUN
</HEADLINE>

 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   POMONA, Calif. _ Mike Dunn's racing nightmare is over.
</P>
<P>
   The La Mirada native, who hadn't won a NHRA national event in
more than two years, ended a 54-race losing streak by winning the
rain-delayed 39th Winternationals on Monday afternoon before a
small crowd at Pomona Raceway.
</P>
<P>
   Dunn, who set a national record for elapsed time during Sunday's
eliminations, easily defeated defending champion Larry Dixon with a
4.522-second pass at 313.88 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Dixon, who hadn't run slower than 4.57 during the first three
rounds of eliminations, smoked his tires before the 60-foot marker
and coasted to a 13.595.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Pedregon, who won two events in 1998, defeated veteran Gary
Densham in the Funny Car final. Jeg Coughlin beat brother Troy in
Pro Stock and Randy Daniels bested Brad Jeter in Pro Stock Truck.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been a while since we tasted victory, and this one is
even sweeter,'' said Dunn, who hadn't won since the 1996 Penzoil
Nationals. ``To qualify No. 1, set the national (elapsed time)
record (4.503) and win the race all in the same weekend is as good
as it gets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We probably should have had two or three wins last year. The
car was that good. But you learn from your mistakes. We changed our
attitude. Last year, we probably would have backed it down and been
on the trailer second round.''
</P>
<P>
   That showed as Dunn, who opened qualifying with a 4.63 on
Friday, made six runs in the 4.50s, including the final's 4.522.
</P>
<P>
   ``The front end came up and carried the front wheels over 100
feet past the starting line,'' said Dunn, who now owns the three
quickest runs in NHRA history. ``I had to grab the brake a little
bit to keep from getting too high.''
</P>
<P>
   Dixon, who qualified sixth, was trying to become the first
driver to win the Winternationals back-to-back.
</P>
<P>
   Dunn, who had a slight disadvantage on the start, was way ahead
when his engine blew just past 1,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Pedregon, coming off a 4.88 pass in the semifinals, felt the
same after his 4.970 at 311.49 mph beat Densham's 5.047 at 282.13
mph.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did my whole procedure like it was a Sunday,'' said
Pedregon, who was not concerned about being one of the first pair
of cars on a cold track. ``I wanted to run when it was sprinkling.
I know the conditions are just the same as the next guy and you got
Gary Densham, who has over 25 years more experience than me, but I
felt confident that my crew chief (John Medlin) was going to tune
the car close to the conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   Densham was seeking his first national event victory in six
final rounds and had a slight advantage at the eighth-mile mark
before Pedregon drove around him to take the win light.
</P>
<P>
   In the Pro Stock final, Jeg Coughlin, who finished second in
points last season, drove his Oldsmobile Cutlass to a 6.969 pass.
He easily defeated Troy Coughlin, who slipped out of the groove
before the 60-foot mark and slowed to a 11.667.
</P>
<P>
   Daniels, of Grantsboro, N.C., earned his first national event
victory in any category with a 7.652 in Pro Stock Truck. Jeter, who
won the Winston Finals here in November, had a 7.705 pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm tickled to win it (Monday) as much as Sunday,'' Daniels
said. ``It's just a great feeling. I waited so long for this.''

MOISO FEELING ROUGHED UP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGLELES _ The Bruins face their most difficult challenge of
the season Thursday at Stanford with one of their best players in
poor form and poor health.
</P>
<P>
   Jerome Moiso is beaten up and it shows.
</P>
<P>
   A 6-foot-10 freshman from Guadeloupe who attended high school in
France, Moiso has a skinny frame and a finesse game. The Pac-10's
rugged schedule and physical play have left him bruised and
battered. He has developed tendinitis in his right foot and felt a
few twinges in his left foot, as well.
</P>
<P>
   The effects are apparent: After scoring 68 points in a four-game
span (USC, Louisville and the Washington schools) Moiso scored just
11 points last weekend against the Oregon schools.
</P>
<P>
   Limited practice time has disrupted his conditioning and timing.
His shooting accuracy has suffered. His decisions are wrong.
Everything is a struggle. The game has suddenly gotten difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thinking about (the foot) too much and that's taking me
out of my game,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Can he get it back? For UCLA to maintain its current pace and
thrive in the NCAA Tournament, he'd better. When in sync, Moiso is
a nearly impossible matchup for opponents: He has the wingspan of a
7-footer, the athleticism of a small forward and the jump shot of a
guard.
</P>
<P>
   It's no coincidence the Bruins' best games _ Kentucky, Arizona,
Louisville _ were also Moiso's best games. If he struggles
Thursday, if he's timid and does not shoot well, if he falters on
defense and refuses to rebound, his team might struggle, as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope to be ready,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So do the Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   In reserve: The injuries to Moiso and center Dan Gadzuric (knee
tendinitis) are not as crippling as they would have been in recent
years when the Bruins had a thin bench. This season, Travis Reed
and Matt Barnes provide adequate depth.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, this is UCLA's deepest team since 1995, when the Bruins
won the national title.

<P>
   ``What I like is I don't feel we're going to get blown out by

   Northern Ireland: No Invitation for Mitchell
</P>
<P>
   BELFAST _ Political leaders rejected a proposal to ask former
Sen. George Mitchell to return to Belfast to try to advance the
stalled peace effort. Mitchell supervised talks between Protestants
and Roman Catholics that led to approval last year of an agreement
to end sectarian violence. The proposal was made by Mary Harney,
the Irish deputy prime minister.

</P>
<P>
   PARIS _ Farmers protesting planned changes in the European
agricultural system and proposed French taxes on pesticides broke

<P>
   LONDON _ Jurors in Britain's first full-scale Nazi war crimes
trial will be sent to Belarus, where Anthony Sawoniak, now 77, is
said to have murdered four Jews in 1942, to examine the scenes of
the reported crimes. Sawoniak, who lives in southern London, denies
the charges. He was a police officer in Domachevo, then under
German occupation, at the time of the killings.

WHITMAN HOBBLES BACK TO WORK
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ Walking with aluminum crutches and a pronounced
limp, Gov. Christie Whitman returned to the New Jersey State House
on Monday for her first public appearance since breaking a leg on
Jan. 31 while skiing in Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Whitman was attending the World Economic Forum in Davos,
and was skiing with her husband during a break between meetings
when she caught the edge of her ski in hard snow and lost control,
she said. Mrs. Whitman swerved uphill, twisted and fell, snapping
both bones in her lower right leg.
</P>
<P>
   The break was so severe that Swiss surgeons used seven metal
screws to attach a titanium rod to steady her tibia, the larger
bone, as it heals. Mrs. Whitman had to cancel her trip to visit
NATO troops in Stuttgart, Germany, and a speaking engagement before
the New Jersey Chamber of Commerce at its annual excursion to
Washington last Thursday. She returned to the United States on
Thursday night and worked from her home on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Whitman, an avid skier and gifted athlete who appeared
slightly abashed by the accident, said she was resuming her normal
schedule, with a few minor adjustments to her wardrobe and speaking
style.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to see a lot more pant suits and very short
speeches,'' she said. ``It hurts to stand in one place too long.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Whitman's leg did not require a cast, but her private
physician, Dr. Robert D'Agostini, said he had urged her not to
place more than 20 percent of her weight on the leg to allow the
bone to heal. D'Agostini, flanked by before-and-after X-rays of the
governor's broken bones, said she could probably resume many of her
athletic activities in six weeks, but he said the titanium rod
would not be surgically removed for a year or two.
</P>
<P>
   The governor is scheduled to make another public appearance at
the State House on Tuesday, to sign an energy deregulation bill
into law.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman plans to stick to her busy schedule of business travel
as she recuperates. This weekend, she is to fly to Florida for a
Republican leadership event, and later this month is to attend the
National Governors' Association conference in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Next month, Whitman is to conduct a three-country swing through
South America in an attempt to strengthen trade relations between
New Jersey businesses and Latin America.

UPSETS BECOME THE RULE AS WESTMINSTER OPENS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., Fla.)  (nk) 
 By ROBIN FINN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Upsets and upstarts sent shock waves through the
rarefied air of this champions-only canine competition Monday when
the 123rd annual Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show got under way at
Madison Square Garden. It was amateur hour in the Working and
Terrier groups when the first two of the seven finalists eligible
to compete for Best-in-Show were identified.
</P>
<P>
   Seasoned troopers like Ch. Toledobes Serenghetti, the Doberman
who has been among the top five success stories on the all-breeds
list for the past three years, and Ch. Sweetsound's King O' Rock N
Roll, the West Highland white terrier who was top terrier in the
nation in 1998, found themselves in the doghouse instead of their
accustomed penthouse.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Sera, the sleek red Dobe, she was evicted from
the Garden by a three-year-old Bernese mountain dog, Ch. Mentmore's
Windy Meadow, in the Working group last night. The 3-year-old
Windy, a 95-pound smiler who sleeps with her handler, Diane Kiester
of Warrenton, Va., has 15 group victories, but none as vaunted as
this one.
</P>
<P>
   Although Windy plays second fiddle at home and on the road to
Kiester's bossy Chesapeake retriever, ``She's No. 1 tonight,'' said
the handler, who termed Windy a slow starter in show business.
``She had some issues; she was a little shy, but now she's feeling
right at home with it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Elvis, the Westie who was expected to take center
stage in the Terrier group, comeuppance descended in the form of a
total tenderfoot, the two-year-old, 18-pound Welsh terrier, Ch.
Sunspryte's Just in Thyme. One of a phalanx of top prospects owned
by Bill Cosby and Jean Heath, Moxie, as the terrier is known
informally, is at the beginning of her show career: this was her
third group victory in her first real season on the campaign trail,
and her handler, Doug Carlson, had never been at the other end of
her leash before. He was filling in for Cosby's main trainer, Clay
Coady, who handled Cosby's Lakeland terrier Ch. Revelry's Awesome
Blossom, the fourth-place finisher.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding Moxie, the judge of the Terrier group, Elaine Rigden,
admitted that she experienced something akin to love at first
sight: ``She was just so exciting to watch. I thought she showed
her heart out.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the breed ring at the Garden is every incumbent's
Armageddon, where the reputation you made for yourself last year
can be shattered in an instant by a judge who prefers novelty to
nostalgia, 90 breed winners from 1998 returned to tempt fate by
attempting a repeat. And the breed judges, too, pointed their
fingers in some unexpected directions Monday, particularly among
the pint-size toy contingent.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest upset occurred in the Maltese ring, where 17 lapdogs
pitter-pattered through their paces for judge Gilbert Kahn, who
then instigated something of a family drama when he homed in on a
two-year-old novice, Ch. Merri Bentley, at the expense of the
four-year-old incumbent, Ch. Ta-Jon's Tickle Me Silly. Silly, as
she's known when she's off-duty, which has not been often in the
last two years of hard campaigning, didn't much feel like living up
to her nickname after being knocked off her pedestal by her own
nephew.
</P>
<P>
   ''We beat Aunt Silly, and she's not too happy about it,'' said
Bentley's ebullient 28-year-old handler, Jason Hoke of East Berlin,
Pa. According to Hoke, Bentley simply presented Kahn with a more
refined silhouette than his celebrated aunt.
</P>
<P>
   The silky white Maltese bitch, who has accumulated nearly 100
bests-in-show to her nephew's none, was fourth overall on the
all-breeds list in 1998 and came into Westminster semiretired due
to impending motherhood. Still, Silly, who belongs to Sam and
Marion Lawrence of Orlando, Fla., owners of Westminster's
Best-in-Show wire fox terrier in 1992, had been touted as a
potential favorite to defend her breed title and also claim the Toy
group. Instead, she settled for being the runner-up to Bentley, who
seemed oblivious to the insult he had dealt his aunt and her human
support squad.
</P>
<P>
   While Silly stewed, Bentley trotted back to his crate for a
reunion with his favorite toy, a stuffed rat. And Hoke explained
why he didn't really feel like a rat for ousting Aunt Silly: ``I'd
never shown him against her before; we kind of feel like she had
her time, and now it's his turn in the spotlight.'' Hoke spent
three hours fine-tuning Bentley's white coat for the competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a pretty lively guy, so he messes his hair up more than
the calm ones do,'' Hoke said of Bentley, who earned his champion
status 10 shows ago and has accumulated three group victories.
</P>
<P>
   Hoke added: ``They're a hard breed to show; you have to keep
their hair wrapped. It's a lot of work and a lot of time spent on a
five-pound dog; that's why people hate to lose. Keeping white dogs
white is a real job.''
</P>
<P>
   Propriety reigned in the poodle ring once the breed competition
switched to the Standard size: Ch. Lake Cove That's My Boy, the
55-pound beauty who captured the Non-Sporting group here last year
and finished 1998 as the top dog all-breeds, endured five hours of
primping on his white pompadour before floating into the breed ring
and reprising his performance from last year. Tre-son, as the
poodle is known, owns 110 career bests, defeated 95,723 canines in
1998, and will call this show his swan song should he manage to
emerge top dog from the 2,500 champions who entered.
