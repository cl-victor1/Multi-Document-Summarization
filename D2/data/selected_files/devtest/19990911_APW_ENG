<HEADLINE> Coroner Would Welcome Waco Inquiry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WACO, Texas (AP) -- As an independent probe prepares to look into  
the government's role in the 1993 Branch Davidian standoff, a 
medical examiner says he'd like to look again into the deaths of 
sect members who died from gunshot wounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a feeling that one should go back and reevaluate,''  
said Dr. Nizam Peerwani, the Tarrant County medical examiner. ``The 
focus at the time was not whether the FBI was doing the shooting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 80 people died after a fire ravaged the group's compound  
10 miles east of Waco. 
</P>
<P>
	Peerwani said he wants to reexamine the deaths of 23 Davidians  
who died of bullet wounds. It may be possible to determine whether 
they were shot by someone outside the compound building, he told 
the Waco Tribune-Herald for today's editions. 
</P>
<P>
	Did the bullets go through an ``intermediary target, like a wall  
or door, before striking these people?'' he asked. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have sufficient photographs and other materials for us to  
review these issues. I have not started this, but I would certainly 
do so if asked by the proper authorities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A Justice Department spokesman declined comment on Peerwani's  
statements. 
</P>
<P>
	``All I can say is the attorney general certainly wants answers  
to the questions being raised,'' Myron Marlin said. ``That's why 
she appointed a special counsel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney General Janet Reno ordered the independent  
investigation after revelations that the FBI used 
potentially-flammable tear-gas canisters -- allegations previously 
denied by the government -- in the April 19, 1993, raid. 
</P>
<P>
	The government maintains the Davidians set fire to the compound.  
</P>
<P>
	Justice of the Peace David Pareya, one of four McLennan County  
justices who ordered the autopsies, told the newspaper he has 
lingering questions about some of the deaths. 
</P>
<P>
	Pareya said he had no choice but to rule the cause of death for  
many Davidians as unknown because the FBI would not supply him with 
the results of the ballistics tests. 
</P>
<P>
	``The thing that always stayed in my mind was if they were  
afraid some of the ordnance or ballistics could be matched up with 
their weaponry,'' Pareya said. 
</P>
<P>
	Peerwani acknowledged there would be limits to what he could  
investigate. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, I can say if a bullet went through an intermediary  
target and things like that. Beyond that, things have to stop,'' he 
said. ``Deciding who shot whom is absolutely part of a criminal 
investigation, and it falls outside the purview of a medical 
examiner's duties.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers in a wrongful-death suit against the federal government  
told the Fort Worth Star-Telegram that they have been unable to 
fully explore the deaths of the Branch Davidians because many of 
their bodies liquefied when a cooler failed at the Tarrant County 
morgue. 
</P>
<P>
	Kirk Lyons, who is representing three Davidian survivors of the  
fire and relatives of 23 dead sect members, said he has been told 
that ``somebody accidentally pulled the plug, and the bodies turned 
to soup.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The cooler failed weeks after Peerwani performed autopsies on  
members of the religious sect, including spiritual leader David 
Koresh, the newspaper reported in today's editions.

<HEADLINE> Apple Growers Struggling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PUTNEY, Vt. (AP) -- The long row of packing equipment is  
gathering dust at Green Mountain Orchards this autumn. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers used to swarm around the machinery at harvest time,  
especially with an apple crop as good as this year's. But changing 
economics have caught up with the third-generation apple farm that 
brothers Evan and Matt Darrow run. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of packing their own and squeezing a few extra cents'  
profit out of each bushel, the Darrows faced the fact that they 
could not afford new equipment and now send their fruit up the road 
to be sorted and packed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought we'd give up apple growing before we gave up apple  
packing,'' Evan Darrow said, staring off toward the back of the 
giant warehouse at the edge of the orchard that once gave his 
operation a competitive edge. 
</P>
<P>
	Like much of agriculture, apple farming is becoming an  
increasingly difficult way of life -- not just in Vermont but across 
the country. New labeling demands by retailers and stiff 
competition from China are combining with stagnant prices, flat 
domestic consumption and always fickle weather to endanger another 
farming way of life. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is growing increasingly difficult for small growers who  
can't achieve the economies of scale to compete,'' said Julia Daly, 
spokeswoman for the U.S. Apple Association. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a result we're going to lose some small farms,'' she said.  
``The challenge is going to be whether or not they can find a niche 
into which they can fit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Large orchards that cater to wholesale markets and small  
orchards that rely on farm stands or pick-your-own operations seem 
to be doing well. But medium-sized orchards that try to do both are 
feeling pressure, said Judy Dimock, co-owner of North Star Orchard 
in Madison, Maine. 
</P>
<P>
	That's partly what's happened at Green Mountain, one of  
Vermont's largest orchards. The 250-acre farm with 30,000 trees is 
a study in the challenges and changes in the American apple 
industry. Besides closing its packing operation, it has cut trees 
and sold off land to cut expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last fall we realized this was a sinking ship,'' Darrow said.  
``If this is what we want to do with our lives, what do we do?'' 
</P>
<P>
	By packing its own crop, Green Mountain was able to improve its  
profit margin slightly. But that changed when retailers began 
demanding that each piece of fruit get a sticker with a four-digit 
code, which makes it easy for checkout clerks to punch in the 
price, but also makes packing more expensive. 
</P>
<P>
	Where once Green Mountain's packing line could box up to 1,100  
bushels a day, the pace dropped to only 700 bushels a day. The 
Darrows decided their best option was to send their apples to 
Vermont Apple, which has the new packing and sticker technology. 
</P>
<P>
	``We always felt we could get an extra 50 cents a bushel out of  
packing our own,'' Darrow said. ``Then it started costing us 75 
cents (a bushel) to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chinese competition is another factor. China has cornered the  
market on so-called processing apples, those that are made into 
cider, juice and concentrate. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. industry accuses the Chinese of dumping excess apple  
concentrate in the United States at a loss, falsely depressing 
prices. In 1995, processing apples sold for $153 a ton. That fell 
to $93 a ton in 1997 and just last year dropped to $55 a ton. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. International Trade Commission ruled this summer that  
the U.S. industry was being injured and now the Commerce Department 
is considering possible tariff penalities. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the Chinese have not made a dent in the fresh apple  
market, their inroads into processing have hurt that sector also. 
``The processing apple prices set the stage or trend for prices 
throughout our industry for fresh apples,'' Daly said. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the U.S. Agriculture Department, farmers got 24  
cents a pound for fresh market apples in 1995. That has fluctuated 
to 20.8 cents in 1996, 22.1 cents in 1997 and plummeted to 17.1 
cents last year. 
</P>
<P>
	So Darrow does what he can on his hillside farm, adding such  
things as a 10-acre blueberry patch to boost business. But whether 
it will work for him and hundreds like him is uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm optimistic about the changes we have made,'' Darrow said,  
``but there is an apple market out there that I have no control 
over.''

	U.N. Calls for Indonesia Peace Force  
</P>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The Security Council today condemned  
Indonesia for allowing a U.N.-organized vote on independence in 
East Timor to deteriorate into an orgy of violence. ``The scale of 
the violence, death and destruction has been far beyond what any 
international observers anticipated,'' said Secretary-General Kofi 
Annan. Portuguese Ambassador Antonio Monteiro said failure to 
authorize an international force would destroy the credibility of 
the United Nations in future referendums. President Clinton today 
suspended more than $100 million in American arms sales and 
insisted that Jakarta accept international help. 

</P>
<P>
	Clinton, Jiang Disagree on Taiwan  
</P>
<P>
	AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) -- President Clinton and Chinese  
President Jiang Zemin ordered a swift resumption of frozen trade 
talks today but ran into sharp differences over China's threats 
against Taiwan. Jiang said China reserves the right to use force to 
thwart any independence move by Taiwan, 100 miles offshore from the 
mainland. Clinton expressed sympathy with China's irritation at 
Taiwan but warned Beijing would face ``grave consequences'' if 
force were used. 

</P>
<P>
	Militants Returning to Puerto Rico  
</P>
<P>
	SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- Hailing pardoned prisoners as  
national heroes, hundreds of Puerto Ricans welcomed home the 
nationalists freed by President Clinton in a controversial 
clemency. Waving Puerto Rican flags and singing nationalist songs, 
supporters greeted the first of 11 prisoners yesterday. The hero's 
welcome for Chicago-born Edwin Cortes will be repeated today when 
six more prisoners are expected. All but one of the released 
belonged to a group responsible for 130 bombings between 1973 and 
1984, killing six and maiming dozens. 

</P>
<P>
	Clinton Announces Violence Grants  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With Americans increasingly concerned about  
school violence, the government today awarded 54 school districts 
$106 million to put into practice plans to make classrooms safe. 
Children in two of the districts -- Jonesboro, Ark., and 
Springfield, Ore. -- know firsthand the horror of random gun attacks 
in their schools. President Clinton, who announced the grants in 
his weekly radio address, said the program comes as the nation's 
largest and most diverse student population ever starts the new 
school year. 

</P>
<P>
	Lott: Tax Cut Will Be GOP Centerpiece  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans frustrated by President Clinton's  
promised veto of their tax package intend to make tax cuts a 
campaign centerpiece next year, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott 
said today. ``It looks as if real tax relief will have to wait 
until a Republican president can join your Republican Congress in 
enacting it into law,'' Lott, R-Miss., said in the GOP's weekly 
radio address. With Clinton's promised rejection, GOP leaders have 
indicated their 10-year, $792 billion tax plan is dead for the 
year.

	Six Saved From Alaskan Glacier  
</P>
<P>
	JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) -- Five cruise ship passengers and their  
sightseeing pilot were airlifted into Juneau today after a downed 
helicopter forced them to spend the night on Herbert Glacier in 
snow, wind and freezing temperatures. The six people suffered no 
major injuries and no ill effects from their night on the ice, the 
coast guard said. A nine-person rescue team reached them before 
midnight yesterday with tents, food and cold-weather survival gear. 

</P>
<P>
	Diners Squirm As Snakes Slither By  
</P>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Diners screamed in terror and leapt on tables  
as snakes suddenly slithered across the floor during lunch in a 
Chinese restaurant, Hong Kong newspapers reported today. About 100 
customers were in the restaurant yesterday when several men, 
believed to be debt-collectors, released the snakes and some 
grasshoppers from two bags, the papers said. Police had to call a 
snake handler, who rounded up 28 nonpoisonous snakes. 

</P>
<P>
	Twins' Milton No-Hits Angels  
</P>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Eric Milton pitched a no-hitter for the  
Minnesota Twins today, overpowering an Anaheim lineup full of 
late-season callups in a 7-0 victory against the Angels. Milton 
struck out a career-high 13, fanning rookie Jeff Davanon with a 3-2 
fastball for the final out. Milton, acquired in February 1998 from 
the New York Yankees in a trade for Chuck Knoblauch, walked two. He 
retired the final 18 batters. 

</P>
<P>
	Martin Routs Pioline, Reaches Final  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Todd Martin easily defeated Cedric Pioline 6-4,  
6-1, 6-2 today to move into the U.S. Open men's championship match. 
Martin, playing in his second Grand Slam tournament final, will 
play the winner of today's second semifinal currently tied one set 
apiece between second-seeded Andre Agassi and No. 3 Yevgeny 
Kafelnikov of Russia. ``Super Saturday'' will be capped by the 
women's championship match between Martina Hingis and Serena 
Williams.

<HEADLINE>  UN Leaders Tour East Timor Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DILI, Indonesia (AP) -- Members of the U.N. Security Council  
toured the blackened ruins of East Timor's capital Saturday, 
eliciting from Indonesia's defense minister a vague commitment to 
allow foreign troops into the troubled province. 
</P>
<P>
	Gen. Wiranto, commander of Indonesia's army, told U.N. delegates  
he'd seriously consider quick deployment of international 
peacekeepers, but then backtracked hours later. 
</P>
<P>
	From the Vatican to Washington, foreign leaders have showered a  
barrage of criticism on the Indonesian government for its failure 
to halt the savage slaughter sweeping East Timor. President Clinton 
was among those turning up the heat, halting $100 million in arms 
sales to Jakarta. 
</P>
<P>
	In the provincial capital of Dili, entire neighborhoods were  
burned to the ground and no pro-independence supporters appeared to 
be left. Numerous soldiers patrolled the streets, and some 
pro-Indonesia militiamen roamed about carrying automatic weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	In other spots, houses and shops appeared to have been destroyed  
in a more selective manner with untouched buildings often flying 
the red-and-white Indonesian flag. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses gave horrific accounts of the last week, during which  
machete-wielding militias aided by Indonesian troops went on a 
rampage after a U.N.-organized referendum showed that four-fifths 
of East Timor's 800,000 people favored breaking from Indonesia. 
</P>
<P>
	In one of the most shocking reports, Australian Isa Bradridge  
said in an interview in the Sydney Morning Herald that his wife saw 
``thousands of bodies'' piled in a large jail cell in the police 
station in Dili. 
</P>
<P>
	``Stacks of bodies up to the roof,'' Bradridge was quoted as  
saying. ``I know it is hard to believe, but it is absolutely true. 
My wife saw arms and legs dripping blood.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aid agencies estimate that anywhere between 600 and 7,000 people  
have been killed and 100,000 driven into West Timor or to other 
islands, and 200,000 more chased from their homes. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, the U.N. Security Council publicly demanded that  
the Jakarta government allow an international peacekeeping force to 
be immediately deployed to the former Portuguese colony. 
</P>
<P>
	Portugese Ambassador Antonio Monteiro warned that the violence  
could destroy the credibility of the United Nations in organizing 
other referendums around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	The European Union finance ministers said they will demand a  
suspension of International Monetary Fund aid to Indonesia if the 
bloodshed is not halted within the next two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF has already frozen talks with Indonesia on releasing the  
rest of $12.3 billion loan package meant to help the country 
recover from an economic crisis suffered in 1997-98. Indonesia 
received a $460 million IMF loan in August and another installment 
was expected in November. 
</P>
<P>
	Carlos Belo, East Timor's Roman Catholic Bishop and joint winner  
of the 1996 Nobel Peace Prize, urged pro-independence supporters to 
use arms to defend themselves against the violence, a Portuguese 
newspaper said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Belos said a decision by East Timor's separatist guerrillas not  
to respond to attacks by the militia was ``too benevolent,'' 
according to daily paper Publico. 
</P>
<P>
	``If others kill with weapons, why can't people defend  
themselves with weapons? There is self-defense, which even morals 
allow,'' said Belo, who is considered East Timor's spiritual 
leader. 
</P>
<P>
	Jose Ramos Horta, an activist who shared the 1996 Nobel Peace  
Prize with Belo, also appealed for urgent action from Auckland, New 
Zealand, where a summit of Pacific rim nations is being held. 
</P>
<P>
	Hopes for an end to the violence rose Saturday when Gen. Wiranto  
told a delegation of five ambassadors from the U.N. Security 
Council who were touring Dili that he would inform President B.J. 
Habibie that Indonesia should consider allowing a peacekeeping 
mission soon. 
</P>
<P>
	But just hours later Wiranto backtracked, telling reporters he'd  
look at ``security cooperation,'' omitting the crucial reference to 
peacekeepers. 
</P>
<P>
	If peacekeepers were allowed into the territory, the only  
country ready to go at a moment's notice is Australia, which has 
come under intense criticism in Indonesia for alleged meddling in 
East Timor's affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	Other countries would mostly likely need at least several weeks  
to pull a credible force together. The United States is virtually 
certain to keep its soldiers out of the conflict, but Clinton has 
offered logistical assistance. 
</P>
<P>
	Pat Burgess, a U.N. official, estimated that up to 200,000 East  
Timorese have taken refuge in the mountains. Some 30,000 were in a 
camp at Dare, some six miles south of Dili. 
</P>
<P>
	He said these people were reduced to living off root plants, as  
there was little else available at the height of the dry season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unless there is urgent and widespread humanitarian aid there  
will be a disaster. This cannot happen unless security situation is 
under control,'' Burgess said. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesia invaded East Timor in 1975 as the Portuguese were  
making a quick exit from their troubled colony. More than 200,000 
people are estimated to have died in the quarter-century since then 
in one of the world's most ignored conflicts.

<HEADLINE>  UN Leaders Tour East Timor Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DILI, Indonesia (AP) -- Members of the U.N. Security Council  
toured the blackened ruins of East Timor's capital Saturday, 
eliciting from Indonesia's defense minister a vague commitment to 
allow foreign troops into the troubled province. 
</P>
<P>
	Gen. Wiranto, commander of Indonesia's army, told U.N. delegates  
he'd seriously consider quick deployment of international 
peacekeepers, but then backtracked hours later. 
</P>
<P>
	From the Vatican to Washington, foreign leaders have showered a  
barrage of criticism on the Indonesian government for its failure 
to halt the savage slaughter sweeping East Timor. President Clinton 
was among those turning up the heat, halting $100 million in arms 
sales to Jakarta. 
</P>
<P>
	In the provincial capital of Dili, entire neighborhoods were  
burned to the ground and no pro-independence supporters appeared to 
be left. Numerous soldiers patrolled the streets, and some 
pro-Indonesia militiamen roamed about carrying automatic weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	In other spots, houses and shops appeared to have been destroyed  
in a more selective manner with untouched buildings often flying 
the red-and-white Indonesian flag. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses gave horrific accounts of the last week, during which  
machete-wielding militias aided by Indonesian troops went on a 
rampage after a U.N.-organized referendum showed that four-fifths 
of East Timor's 800,000 people favored breaking from Indonesia. 
</P>
<P>
	In one of the most shocking reports, Australian Isa Bradridge  
said in an interview in the Sydney Morning Herald that his wife saw 
``thousands of bodies'' piled in a large jail cell in the police 
station in Dili. 
</P>
<P>
	``Stacks of bodies up to the roof,'' Bradridge was quoted as  
saying. ``I know it is hard to believe, but it is absolutely true. 
My wife saw arms and legs dripping blood.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aid agencies estimate that anywhere between 600 and 7,000 people  
have been killed and 100,000 driven into West Timor or to other 
islands, and 200,000 more chased from their homes. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, the U.N. Security Council publicly demanded that  
the Jakarta government allow an international peacekeeping force to 
be immediately deployed to the former Portuguese colony. 
</P>
<P>
	Portugese Ambassador Antonio Monteiro warned that the violence  
could destroy the credibility of the United Nations in organizing 
other referendums around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	The European Union finance ministers said they will demand a  
suspension of International Monetary Fund aid to Indonesia if the 
bloodshed is not halted within the next two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF has already frozen talks with Indonesia on releasing the  
rest of $12.3 billion loan package meant to help the country 
recover from an economic crisis suffered in 1997-98. Indonesia 
received a $460 million IMF loan in August and another installment 
was expected in November. 
</P>
<P>
	Carlos Belo, East Timor's Roman Catholic Bishop and joint winner  
of the 1996 Nobel Peace Prize, urged pro-independence supporters to 
use arms to defend themselves against the violence, a Portuguese 
newspaper said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Belos said a decision by East Timor's separatist guerrillas not  
to respond to attacks by the militia was ``too benevolent,'' 
according to daily paper Publico. 
</P>
<P>
	``If others kill with weapons, why can't people defend  
themselves with weapons? There is self-defense, which even morals 
allow,'' said Belo, who is considered East Timor's spiritual 
leader. 
</P>
<P>
	Jose Ramos Horta, an activist who shared the 1996 Nobel Peace  
Prize with Belo, also appealed for urgent action from Auckland, New 
Zealand, where a summit of Pacific rim nations is being held. 
</P>
<P>
	Hopes for an end to the violence rose Saturday when Gen. Wiranto  
told a delegation of five ambassadors from the U.N. Security 
Council who were touring Dili that he would inform President B.J. 
Habibie that Indonesia should consider allowing a peacekeeping 
mission soon. 
</P>
<P>
	But just hours later Wiranto backtracked, telling reporters he'd  
look at ``security cooperation,'' omitting the crucial reference to 
peacekeepers. 
</P>
<P>
	If peacekeepers were allowed into the territory, the only  
country ready to go at a moment's notice is Australia, which has 
come under intense criticism in Indonesia for alleged meddling in 
East Timor's affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	Other countries would mostly likely need at least several weeks  
to pull a credible force together. The United States is virtually 
certain to keep its soldiers out of the conflict, but Clinton has 
offered logistical assistance. 
</P>
<P>
	Pat Burgess, a U.N. official, estimated that up to 200,000 East  
Timorese have taken refuge in the mountains. Some 30,000 were in a 
camp at Dare, some six miles south of Dili. 
</P>
<P>
	He said these people were reduced to living off root plants, as  
there was little else available at the height of the dry season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unless there is urgent and widespread humanitarian aid there  
will be a disaster. This cannot happen unless security situation is 
under control,'' Burgess said. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesia invaded East Timor in 1975 as the Portuguese were  
making a quick exit from their troubled colony. More than 200,000 
people are estimated to have died in the quarter-century since then 
in one of the world's most ignored conflicts.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Castro Exiles Block Cuban Band </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- The first Miami concert scheduled by a popular  
dance band from Cuba was canceled after complaints from anti-Castro 
Cuban exiles, including the city's Cuban-American mayor. 
</P>
<P>
	The private company that runs the concert hall decided on Friday  
to cancel the band Los Van Van's Oct. 9 show after a flurry of 
complaints. 
</P>
<P>
	After the band's concert was announced Wednesday,  
Spanish-language radio stations urged listeners to flood City Hall 
with complaints. Local leaders also urged residents to oppose the 
show. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the official Communist band of Fidel Castro,'' said  
Miami Mayor Joe Carollo. 
</P>
<P>
	The band's New York label, Havana Caliente, plans to go to court  
Monday to reschedule the concert. ``We won't sit still and take 
it,'' said label president Maria Zenoz. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no Miami exception to the First Amendment,'' said John  
de Leon, an attorney who heads the American Civil Liberties Union's 
Miami office. 
</P>
<P>
	The politics of Cuban exiles have influenced local events  
before, including the prevention of a Pan-American Games in the 
county and the cancellation of a MIDEM Americas music industry 
party last year because Cuban musicians were to have played. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami Beach promoter Debbie Ohanian said the cancellation  
surprised her because she had complied with all city requirements, 
getting extra insurance, metal detectors and extra security at the 
hall, and a marine patrol on the Miami River. 
</P>
<P>
	Los Van Van, fearing potential protests, haven't played in Miami  
during previous U.S. tours. But band leaders thought the political 
temperature had cooled enough to schedule the show at the end of 
its current 26-date tour.

<HEADLINE> Fusion 2, Revolution 1, SO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Brian Kamler's goal in the fourth  
round of the shootout gave the Miami Fusion a 2-1 victory over the 
New England Revolution on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Paulo Dos Santos was the Revolution's final chance at tying the  
shootout, but his shot went left, giving the Fusion a 3-2 advantage 
in the shootout. 
</P>
<P>
	Dos Santos' errant shot culminated a bizarre shootout in which  
the Revolution blew a two-goal lead and backup goalkeeper Jeff 
Causey was ejected by referee Tim Weyland for fouling Welton of the 
Fusion during his second-round attempt. 
</P>
<P>
	Causey, who replaced starter and New England head coach Walter  
Zenga with two minutes remaining in regulation for the shootout, 
was replaced by forward Joe-Max Moore. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore just could not stop the Fusion's next three shots, from  
Welton, Saul Martinez and Kamler. 
</P>
<P>
	Giovanni Savarese and Johnny Torres scored New England's  
shootout goals. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory snapped a four-game losing streak for the Fusion  
(11-17) and their 23 points moved them into fourth place in the MLS 
Eastern Conference. New England (10-18) is one point behind in the 
standings and the top four teams in each conference qualify for the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	A scoreless second half led to the fourth shootout in as many  
matches between the teams this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami took a 1-0 lead on the 29th minute, with Welton scored his  
seventh goal of the season. The lead lasted a minute as the 
Revolution tied it on Savarese's header from 6 yards.

<HEADLINE>  Coleman To Resign As NL President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Angry with proposals to strip his job of nearly  
all authority, National League president Len Coleman plans to 
resign at the end of the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	Coleman, baseball's highest-ranking black official, has headed  
the NL since March 1994. He had been resisting the efforts of 
commissioner Bud Selig to switch control of umpires from the league 
presidents to Sandy Alderson, hired last year as Selig's executive 
vice president of baseball operations. He also has fought with 
Selig over baseball's failure to hire more minorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a plan baseball owners may vote on when they meet  
Wednesday and Thursday in Cooperstown, N.Y., the job of league 
president would become a figurehead, several senior baseball 
officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	If approved, the distinctions between the American and National  
leagues would decrease, following the pattern under Selig, who led 
the push for interleague play and advocates radical realignment. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the plan, player discipline and the making of the schedule  
would be shifted from the leagues to the commissioner's office, 
subject to the approval of the players' association. Without these, 
the job of league president becomes merely ceremonial. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would seem ludicrous to have somebody there just to sign  
the baseballs. If that's all you have to do, I'll apply,'' said 
umpires' union head Richie Phillips, who has fought the plan to 
switch control of his members to Alderson. 
</P>
<P>
	The timing of the resignation plan, according to several  
high-ranking officials who spoke on the condition they not be 
identified, was precipitated by next week's owners' meeting. 
Coleman, however, had not intended to make an announcement today 
and was surprised that news leaked out Friday morning to ESPN, 
several baseball officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	While many baseball votes are conducted among each league  
separately, under the restructuring league meetings would disappear 
and decisions would be made by all owners of both leagues meeting 
together. 
</P>
<P>
	Coleman, whose annual salary is thought to be in the $600,000  
range, had been negotiating settlement of his contract with Selig's 
staff for some time but had largely kept his plans private until 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a complete shock to me,'' Atlanta Braves president Stan  
Kasten said. 
</P>
<P>
	Coleman declined comment, as did Selig's spokesman, Rich Levin.  
</P>
<P>
	AL president Gene Budig has been much more amenable to  
Alderson's increasing role. Coleman has fought with Alderson and 
others in the commissioner's office, refusing to issue directives 
to umpires they drafted in his name. 
</P>
<P>
	``Coleman has too much pride to allow himself to continue to be  
used. They stamp his name to stuff he refuses to sign,'' Phillips 
said. ``I believe that Gene Budig's exit will be close on the heels 
of Coleman's, and I don't believe it will be by resignation. Gene's 
job will be not only diminished, but extinguished.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gene Orza, the No. 2 official of the players' association, said  
there would have to be negotiations before the union approves any 
changes in player discipline. 
</P>
<P>
	``To the extent that they want to come down harder on umpires,  
there might be a psychological impulse to come down harder on 
players when they have confrontations with umpires,'' Orza said. 
``We're going to want some assurances that is not the case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball's restructuring began shortly after Selig, who had been  
acting commissioner since September 1992, was voted to a full 
five-year term in July 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Last September, he hired three executive vice presidents who  
report to Paul Beeston, baseball's chief operating officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Alderson, the former president and general manager of the  
Oakland Athletics, was put in charge of operational matters. Bob 
DuPuy, Selig's longtime lawyer, was made baseball's chief legal 
officer and put in charge all of administrative matters. Rob 
Manfred, a labor lawyer whose firm represented baseball for more 
than a decade, was put in charge of labor and human resources. 
</P>
<P>
	Beeston, DuPuy, Alderson and Manfred had directed the owners'  
strategy in dealing with the umpires' threat to resign in en masse. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the dissident umpires held a telephone conference  
call Friday and decided to start the process of collecting 
signatures to organize a new union. 
</P>
<P>
	``We started the process of creating an organizing committee,''  
said AL umpire Davey Phillips, a leader of the dissidents. ``The 
campaign started officially today.''

<HEADLINE> Girl Dies After Fake Carjacking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMBRIDGE, Md. (AP) -- A man who originally told police he was  
carjacked on Maryland's Eastern Shore faces two murder counts in 
the deaths of his young children, who were shot at point-blank 
range in their car seats, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Spicknall II was ordered held in the Talbot County jail  
without bond Friday. Maryland state police say he confessed to the 
shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	Destiny Array Spicknall, 3, died Friday afternoon in a Baltimore  
hospital, one day after she and her 2-year-old brother, Richard 
Spicknall III, were found by construction workers in the car, 
parked behind an unfinished home. 
</P>
<P>
	The children were found at about 8 a.m. Thursday. Both had been  
shot in the chest. The boy died Thursday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Spicknall, 27, underwent 16 hours of questioning Thursday after  
police found him dripping wet by a payphone at the foot of a 
fishing pier over the Choptank River. Police say he gave them a 
phony story about how his children were abducted by an armed 
hitchhiker after he was thrown into the river. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said he confessed to the shootings after about six hours  
of questioning. Court papers show Spicknall confessed about an hour 
after workers found the Jeep Wrangler, parked a half-mile from the 
payphone where Spicknall made his 911 call. 
</P>
<P>
	At a bond hearing in Easton Friday, Spicknall's lawyer called  
the confession ``suspicious'' and said he would request a 
psychiatric evaluation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Outside of the allegations, the defendant is basically an  
All-American young man,'' said defense attorney Michael Belsky.

<HEADLINE> Cockpit Has Supercomputer `Brain' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	One of the keys to the F-22 cockpit electronics is a central  
``brain,'' technically called a common integrated processor that is 
equivalent in computing power to two Cray supercomputers. 
</P>
<P>
	It integrates many functions and simplifies the way in which  
information is presented to the pilot. The goal: make identifying 
an enemy aircraft and firing a missile at the plane as easy as 
moving a cursor on a computer screen. 
</P>
<P>
	After an initial run through laboratory tests, the F-22 avionics  
software is tested aboard what Boeing calls a ``flying test bed,'' 
a modified 757 jetliner with an F-22 nose section fused onto its 
front and a set of F-22 wings mounted atop the 757's fuselage. In 
that configuration, and with dozens of computers and technicians 
aboard, the plane can test software for the F-22's radar and other 
sensors. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have really narrowed down the funnel of problems'' by using  
the modified 757 before the software is put to full-scale flight 
testing, said Gherry Bender, deputy manager of Boeing's F-22 
avionics work.

<HEADLINE> Pact on Nuclear Wastes Signed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Governors from four states have signed an  
agreement with the Department of Energy to clean up nuclear wastes 
after Energy Secretary Bill Richardson acknowledged the federal 
government has not done a good job. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are beginning a new era of cooperation between the  
Department of Energy and the states to clean up the lingering 
legacy of the Cold War,'' Richardson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement, signed Friday, includes goals and deadlines, many  
of which depend on funding that hasn't been committed by Congress. 
Governors of Colorado, South Carolina, Tennessee and Washington 
promised to work with Richardson to get the needed funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Previously, the Energy Department worked with each state  
individually on the cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
	Notably missing from Friday's meeting was the governor of New  
Mexico, host of the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant where much of the 
waste will be shipped. Richardson promised to work with New Mexico 
and other states, including Idaho, on similar agreements. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not a session getting the governors together to lobby  
Congress. It's how we, the federal government, the Department of 
Energy and the states can work together. We haven't done that 
well,'' Richardson said after a signing ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	Agreement on common issues included completing the cleanup of  
nuclear weapons plants as expeditiously as possible, and complying 
with state and federal regulations. They also pledged to seek 
``predictable and adequate funding'' for the cleanup, and a promise 
to protect the environment. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson said the states will be asking for nearly $7 billion  
through 2001. He said he's already obtained a commitment of $5.6 
billion from the Office of Management and Budget through next year.

	Clinton Announces Violence Grants  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With students nationwide returning to class,  
President Clinton today announced $100 million in grants aimed at 
reducing youth violence. The grants are part of the Safe 
Schools/Healthy Schools Initiative, a joint effort of the 
departments of Education, Justice and Health and Human Services to 
develop methods to identify troubled youths and prevent violence. 
They were awarded to 54 communities which applied for help in 
developing locally tailored programs. The grantees included 
Jonesboro, Ark., where two students killed four others and a 
teacher in March 1998.

	Indonesia May Accept Peacekeepers  
</P>
<P>
	DILI, Indonesia (AP) -- Indonesian army commander Gen. Wiranto  
said he would be willing to accept international peacekeepers to 
help quell the violence in East Timor, U.N. officials said today, 
but hours later he appeared to backtrack, speaking only of 
``security cooperation'' and omitting the crucial reference to 
peacekeepers. It is unclear how the matter would be resolved. 
Indonesia had previously ruled out allowing foreign troops into the 
province to restore order. Aid agencies estimate that anywhere 
between 600 and 7,000 people have been killed, 100,000 driven into 
West Timor or to other islands, and 200,000 more chased from their 
homes.

	Iran Denies Long-Range Missile Plan  
</P>
<P>
	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) -- Iran rejected today a CIA  
report alleging it could be able to hit the United States with an 
intercontinental missile within 15 years. The official Islamic 
Republic News Agency quoted Iranian Defense Ministry spokesman 
Keyvan Khosravi as saying the CIA report about Iran trying to make 
intercontinental missiles was ``an absolute lie.'' A CIA report 
released Thursday alleged that North Korea, Iran and Iraq were 
trying to produce intercontinental ballistic missiles.

	Floyd Poses No Immediate U.S. Threat  
</P>
<P>
	THE VALLEY, Anguilla (AP) -- Hurricane Floyd skimmed north of the  
Caribbean's Leeward Islands today, packing 105 mph winds and 
prompting islanders to board up their houses. Forecasters warned 
that Puerto Rico and the Virgin islands could be hit by flooding 
tomorrow and Monday, although the storm will pass well north of the 
islands. ``All we can say at this point in time is that (people) 
along the U.S. southeast ... should closely monitor the storm this 
weekend. But it's not going to threaten any land anywhere over the 
weekend,'' said Stacy Stewart, a meteorologist at the National 
Hurricane Center.

	Father Held in Kids' Deaths

	CAMBRIDGE, Md. (AP) -- A man who originally told police he was  
carjacked on Maryland's Eastern Shore faces two murder counts in 
the deaths of his young children, who were shot at point-blank 
range in their car seats, police said. Richard Spicknall II was 
ordered held in the Talbot County jail without bond yesterday. 
Spicknall, 27, underwent 16 hours of questioning after police found 
him dripping wet by a payphone at the foot of a fishing pier over 
the Choptank River. Police said he confessed to the shootings after 
about six hours of questioning.

	Sri Lankans Accused of Torture

<P>
	COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) -- Amnesty International accused the Sri  
Lankan authorities today of torturing three Tamils arrested for 
allegedly killing a top moderate Tamil politician. ``The three 
young Tamil men have been severely tortured in police custody in 
the capital, Colombo. All three may be in urgent need of medical 
attention,'' the London-based human rights group said in a letter 
to President Chandrika Kumaratunga. There was no immediate 
government comment.

	HONG KONG (AP) -- Diners screamed in terror and leapt on tables  
as snakes suddenly slithered across the floor during lunch in a 
Chinese restaurant, Hong Kong newspapers reported today. About 100 
customers were in the restaurant yesterday when several men, 
believed to be debt-collectors, released the snakes and some 
grasshoppers from two bags, the papers said. Police had to call a 
snake handler, who rounded up 28 nonpoisonous snakes.

	Serena Williams, Hingis in Finals

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Two years after beating a Williams for her first  
U.S. Open women's singles title, Martina Hingis will take on the 
other half of the family for the same prize. The women's 
championship match will cap today's ``Super Saturday,'' which will 
start with both men's singles semifinals. Todd Martin will faceoff 
against Cedric Pioline before Andre Agassi and Yevgeny Kafelnikov 
fight it out to determine who's No. 1 among the men. Hingis 
overcame Venus Williams 6-1, 4-6, 6-3 last night, spoiling a family 
affair championship. Serena Williams beat Lindsay Davenport 6-4, 
1-6, 6-4.

	Clinton Offers East Timor Support  
</P>
<P>
	AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) -- President Clinton on Sunday opened  
the door to U.S. involvement in East Timor. Clinton said that 
during in his discussions with foreign leaders about the 
violence-torn territory, he asserted there could be a limited U.S. 
presence in East Timor to support a peacekeeping mission. The 
president stressed no decisions would be made without consulting 
lawmakers. Clinton also demanded that a defiant Indonesia invite an 
international force to restore security to tiny East Timor. But 
Indonesia insisted outside help was not needed now.

	Puerto Rico Welcomes Pardoned Militants  
</P>
<P>
	SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- A group of pardoned Puerto Rican  
prisoners received a big welcome home at San Juan airport today. 
Eleven were freed yesterday after about 20 years behind bars. Some 
objected to the condemnation in the United States of President 
Clinton's offer of clemency for 16 pro-independence militants. Two 
prisoners rejected the offer, one accepted a deal to serve five 
more years and two who had already served out jail sentences were 
forgiven outstanding fines. The prisoners were convicted of 
sedition and illegal possession of weapons in connection with 130 
bombings in the 1970s and 1980s that killed six people and maimed 
dozens.

	German Party Faces Test in Election  
</P>
<P>
	BERLIN (AP) -- Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder faced a new tough  
test Sunday in the eastern state of Thuringia, a week after a 
stinging defeat for his party in two state elections. Polls showed 
the chancellor's Social Democrats losing ground in the state, 
putting the conservative Christian Democrats within reach of a 
majority that would allow them to end their alliance with the 
Social Democrats there and govern alone. Schroeder's center-left 
coalition lost its safe majority in the upper house last February 
when the Social Democrats lost the Hesse state government.

	Guard Praised by Police Arrested  
</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- An armored car guard who was once praised as  
a hero is now being called a crook. In a 1997 shootout, David 
Campbell helped drag wounded police officers to safety. But today, 
he was behind bars for allegedly helping to rob his own truck of 
$500,000. Police say the 36-year-old was driving an armored 
transport truck hijacked by two gunmen on Sept. 3 in suburban Van 
Nuys. The thieves tied up Campbell and another guard and fled with 
the money.

	Second E. coli Outbreak Sickens 140  
</P>
<P>
	PETERSBURG, Ill. (AP) -- In the nation's second major E. coli  
outbreak in two weeks, more than 140 people were sickened with a 
deadly strain of the bacteria after partying in a cow pasture last 
weekend. Two people have died in New York State and more than 600 
others who attended a county fair there have E. coli symptoms. New 
York health officials say as many as 1,000 people may have been 
infected, which would make it the worst E. coli outbreak in U.S. 
history. No deaths have been linked to the Illinois outbreak, but a 
health official said today that 18 people had been hospitalized, 
127 had reported E. coli symptoms and those numbers were expected 
to rise.

	Clinton Chats With U.S. Open Champ  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- President Clinton called Serena Williams to  
congratulate her on winning the U.S. Open singles title tonight. 
Williams' conversation with the president was arrestingly devoid of 
protocol. The 17-year-old frequently interrupted him, asking 
questions about the number of time zones between New York and 
Auckland, New Zealand, where the president was meeting with 
Asia-Pacific leaders. Williams was flabbergasted to learn that he 
was watching from New Zealand as she beat Martina Hingis of 
Switzerland 6-3, 7-6 (7-4).

	CHICAGO (AP) -- Dave Burba won his sixth straight decision,  
Richie Sexson homered and the Cleveland Indians overcame the loss 
of major league RBI leader Manny Ramirez to beat the Chicago White 
4-3 tonight. Ramirez, who has 144 RBIs, left in the first inning 
with a bruised right knee after being hit by a pitch from Jim 
Parque. The AL Central champions said his status is day-to-day. 
David Justice replaced Ramirez, putting runners and first and 
second with two outs. Sexson then hit a three-run homer, his 28th 
of the season, to give Burba an early cushion.

<HEADLINE> Class of 2000 Facing Hopes, Fears </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The Cold War was over before they were 10. They think the stock  
market goes nowhere but up. They know all about sex, but also about 
AIDS. Their schools have computers in the classroom, but metal 
detectors by the front door. They wear studs in their tongues and 
pagers on their belts. 
</P>
<P>
	They are the Class of 2000, more than 3 million young Americans  
now starting their senior year in high school, and like every 
generation of teens, they dare their parents to understand them. 
</P>
<P>
	But more than parents are watching these Y2K youth. Apart from  
their symbolic status as standard-bearers into the next millennium, 
they form the leading edge of a teen population bulge that will 
surpass even the baby boom at its peak. 
</P>
<P>
	Courted by advertisers, fretted over by politicians, the Class  
of 2000 inherits an era of prosperity but also one of alienation, 
as families grow more fractured and strange new perils surface with 
each day's news. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're out here alone as a generation,'' says Kim Blair, a  
senior at Columbine High in Littleton, Colo. One day last April, 
she watched her safe, suburban school become a killing grund, and 
she realized her class would have to learn how to take care of 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
	``In my parents' generation, they didn't have a lot of teen  
violence or gang problems,'' Blair says. ``They didn't have the Y2K 
bug; they barely had computers. I think it's hard for parents to 
keep up with the kids. We're learning so many things, so much 
quicker than they are.'' 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	By many social measures, the Class of 2000 differs little from  
any other teen generation deemed by society to be headed to hell in 
a handbasket -- which is to say every generation in recent memory, 
from pot-smoking '60s hippies (now hand-wringing parents 
themselves) to slacker Gen Xers (now running their own Internet 
companies). 
</P>
<P>
	Some comfort can be found in recent statistics:  
</P>
<P>
	Teen-age smoking and illegal drug use climbed during most of the  
'90s but appear to have stabilized or dropped slightly in the last 
few years. The teen pregnancy rate has dropped 17 percent since 
1990. The teen abortion rate has fallen 31 percent since 1986. 
Violent crime committed by teens has dropped steadily since 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Beyond the numbers, however, there's a troubling sense that the  
Class of 2000 is coming of age in a harsher, more confusing era. 
</P>
<P>
	A modern teen, it has been estimated, is exposed to more  
information in a single day than a medieval peasant was in a 
lifetime. But the flood of data hardly equals wisdom, which today's 
youth will need in balancing the curses and blessings of their 
high-tech future. 
</P>
<P>
	The easy exchange of personal information over the Internet  
carries the threat of a world without privacy. Genetic engineering, 
whether of plants, sheep, or human embryos, poses ethical 
quandaries that can only grow more acute as the Class of 2000 
matures. 
</P>
<P>
	The uncertainties are enough to make Keith Poertner, 17, sound  
almost nostalgic for the Cold War, when two superpowers stared each 
other down with the mutual threat of nuclear annihilation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, all the small countries have nukes and just anybody can  
push the button,'' says Poertner, of Traverse City, Mich. ``And 
you've got terrorists and germ warfare and everything. You never 
know where the threat's going to come from.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Today's teens are freer than ever to follow their own paths,  
beyond the reach of parents. In the '60s, when music came on black 
vinyl disks instead of silvery plastic CDs, baby boomers forged a 
generational identity with loud and annoying rock 'n' roll. Today's 
youth, by contrast, listen to all sorts of loud and annoying music: 
rap, reggae, hip-hop, punk, techno. 
</P>
<P>
	Even high-school cliques are more splintered. Jocks, nerds and  
preps still roam the corridors, but so do punks, Goths, skaters, 
stoners and gangstas. 
</P>
<P>
	It's hard for terrified parents to swallow the argument that  
Marilyn Manson's profane and violent lyrics are merely this 
generation's version of Elvis Presley's gyrating hips. But it's 
equally hard for youths to accept the suggestion that they can be 
corrupted by a pop song or video game. 
</P>
<P>
	Frank Bitetto, 17, a punk-rock drummer with a partially shaved  
head, enjoys standing out from the crowd, but he says that hardly 
makes him a menace. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure if I went out and shot somebody right now it would  
probably make the news that I listen to Marilyn Manson and Nine 
Inch Nails. But it wouldn't make the news that I have Aerosmith 
albums,'' says Bitetto, who also works at Wal-Mart and serves as 
president of his high-school drama club in Franklin, N.H. 
</P>
<P>
	The Class of 2000 is more racially diverse than any before it.  
Thirty-three percent of U.S. teens belong to minorities, compared 
to 28 percent of Americans of all ages. By the time these kids 
retire -- if such a thing is still allowed in the mid-21st century -- 
minorities will nearly add up to a majority of the U.S. population. 
</P>
<P>
	Teens increasingly face cultural conflicts, sometimes within  
their own household. 
</P>
<P>
	Kauxiong Yang, a Hmong refugee from Laos, lives in the  
Minneapolis suburb of Brooklyn Park. She flips through Vogue and 
Glamour magazines, listens to pop stars Jewel and Alanis 
Morrisette, and wears Gap jeans with the seams torn just so at the 
bottom. 
</P>
<P>
	She also happens, at 17, to be married -- common in Hmong culture  
but odd enough here that she initially kept it a secret from 
classmates after moving last year from California. She lives with 
her 22-year-old husband and his family, who expect her to be 
obedient and industrious. She yearns to be a typical American teen. 
</P>
<P>
	``I keep lying to myself to a point where I don't even know who  
I am,'' Yang says. ``The minute I step into the house, I'm 
pretending to be someone I'm not.'' 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Corporate America has tuned in to the Class of 2000, which is  
riding the front of an unprecedented teen-age wave. The 12-to-19 
age bracket has increased each year since 1992 and is expected to 
reach 35 million by 2010, an ``echo boom'' larger than the baby 
boom at its peak. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're spending a huge amount of money,'' says Michael Wood,  
vice president of Teenage Research Unlimited, a Chicago-based 
market research firm. He estimates last year's teen purchases at 
$141 billion, up 16 percent over 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike their parents, who rebelled against corporate America,  
the children proudly wear its advertising. At the moment, the 
``coolest'' brands among teens are Nike, Adidas, Tommy Hilfiger, 
Sony and Nintendo, according to surveys done by Wood's firm. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cool'' can equal big profits. Puff Daddy isn't just a rap  
musician. He's also a producer and entertainment company CEO, he's 
in publishing and fashion, and he made the cover of Forbes Magazine 
for his $53 million in earnings last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Ask teens what it takes to be considered cool, ``and the No. 1  
and 2 answers have always been good looks and being funny,'' Wood 
says. 
</P>
<P>
	But he notes one big change: ``Teens today say it's very  
difficult to be rebellious, because pretty much everything has been 
done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If mass marketers know how to bend a generation's attitudes and  
behavior, social engineers are catching on as well. Researchers 
credit renewed education efforts -- more nuanced than the ``Just Say 
No'' campaigns of the '80s -- for the recent halt in the rise of 
teen smoking and drug abuse. 
</P>
<P>
	Education can even have a tempering effect on hormones.  
Awareness of AIDS and more knowledge about contraceptives have 
helped reduce the teen-age pregnancy rate. By graduation, some 60 
percent of the Class of 2000 will have had sexual intercourse, a 
rate that researchers say appears to be declining, partly due to 
sex education encouraging abstinence. In some circles, virginity is 
cool. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think (sex) belongs inside marriage,'' says Jason  
Hartbarger, 17, a home-schooled senior in Cary, N.C., who has had a 
girlfriend for nearly two years. ``It's not something that I have 
any interest in. I think there are other ways to be serious in a 
relationship and to make things last.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While sex and drugs tend to worry parents, many teens bridle at  
what they consider adult misconceptions. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a lot of us out here who have get-up-and-go, who  
want to accomplish things,'' says Brad Lambrecht, 17, of Lisbon, 
N.D. 
</P>
<P>
	He plans to leave the family farm to pursue a career in music,  
making him one of many in the Class of 2000 with a clear vision for 
the future: 
</P>
<P>
	-- In New York City, Lakecia Benjamin, 16, practices up to four  
hours a day on her alto saxophone, playing gospel, jazz and funk at 
the Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music &AMP; Art and Performing 
Arts. Her cheeks puff up until her dimples vanish, and she looks 
off to the side, ecstatic and absorbed, as mellow notes dance in 
the air. ``I practice forever, just to get that one sound,'' she 
says. 
</P>
<P>
	-- A baseball diamond defines the universe of Jim Olds, 17, in  
Lafayette, Ind. Muscular and confident, he dreams of playing 
professional ball and fills his life with the game, rhapsodizing 
about the intensity of the face-off between batter and pitcher: 
``You just look him in the eye and you compete, he does his best, 
and whoever comes out on top comes out on top. I suppose the best 
thing about baseball is there's always tomorrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- At the private Menlo School in the Silicon Valley town of  
Atherton, Chris Niederauer, 17, has his own Web site 
(www.ccntech.com), 15 e-mail addresses and two powerful computers. 
Skinny and pale, with soft hands and blue eyes, he'd be happier if 
he could spend more than his usual 45 hours a week on the computer. 
``Nerds around here, we don't have a bad reputation,'' Neiderauer 
says. ``Lots of the jocks are trying to learn programming, so they 
turn to us for help.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One might expect a healthy geek factor in Silicon Valley, but  
high technology has transformed the Class of 2000 nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	In Gallup, N.M., Navajo student Aaron LeMaster tinkers with his  
computer and builds gadgets using parts from old VCRs. He dreams of 
starting his own electronics company, and his mother, awed by her 
son's technical knowledge, doesn't doubt his potential. 
</P>
<P>
	``He learned it all on his own, just by taking things apart,''  
says Lenora LeMaster. ``He's very self-driven.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About two-thirds of the Class of 2000 will attend college next  
fall. Their economic outlook is excellent, with the playing field 
more level than ever for young women, who now outnumber males in 
college enrollment. 
</P>
<P>
	But the outlook is darker for those who don't pursue higher  
education, and darker still for the 4 percent of high schoolers who 
drop out before graduation. Experts predict a widening gulf between 
haves and have-nots in America's increasingly information-based 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Poertner, in Traverse City, hopes to graduate next spring but  
admits that his record of cutting classes means he'll have to 
``work my patootie off.'' His mom is a housewife. His dad is a 
diesel mechanic who digs graves for extra money. Lanky, goateed 
Poertner hasn't made any plans for himself. 
</P>
<P>
	``They say by the end of next year I'm supposed to decide what  
the heck I'm supposed to do with the rest of my life,'' he says. 
``Well, I just don't care to. Nothing's really popped up in my 
face.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For others, even those with few advantages, the American Dream  
still glimmers. 
</P>
<P>
	Oswaldo Mendoza, 17, born in Mexico City, now lives with his  
family in Reno, Nev. He works after school as a busboy at a casino, 
saving his minimum-wage pay for college. ``That's why we came to 
the United States -- to get a better way of life for me and my 
brother and sister,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	Angela Ford attends a Chattanooga, Tenn., school founded in 1865  
to educate former slaves. Most students live in nearby public 
housing. Administrators battle poor attendance and a high dropout 
rate with inspirational posters about ``Great Expectations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ford takes those posters to heart. A striking young woman with  
almond eyes, she has never met her father but says she doesn't feel 
deprived, nurtured instead by her mother, grandmother and aunts. 
With a near-perfect 3.95 GPA, she plans to pursue college degrees 
in electrical engineering and business. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like I can do this,'' Ford says. ``My mother gave me a  
lot of educational guidance. She made it fun. She said hard work 
would pay off later.'' 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	The headlines often serve up polarized views of the Class of  
2000, casting its members either as savvy denizens of the dot.com 
decade or as victims adrift in a cultural sea of sex and violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Spend time with these teens, however, and you discover a new  
generation with old-fashioned concerns: friends, romance, money 
and, above all, family. 
</P>
<P>
	``All teen-agers need at least one adult in their life who  
really cares about them,'' says Laurence Steinberg, a psychology 
professor at Temple University and author of ``You and Your 
Adolescent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yet the traditional family is becoming less common, with 28  
percent of children under 18 now living with just one parent, 
according to census figures. 
</P>
<P>
	Not that having both parents under the same roof guarantees good  
parenting. Steinberg says studies suggest that about 30 percent of 
parents, from drug-addicted dads in the slums to dual-career 
professional couples, have ``checked out'' of their teens' lives. 
</P>
<P>
	``They don't know who their kids' friends are,'' Steinberg says.  
``They don't know what their kids are doing after school. They may 
live in the same house, but they have no meaningful relationship 
with their kids.'' 
</P>
<P>
	How important is family? Ask Tyler Ray, 18.  
</P>
<P>
	He attends Chattanooga's private McCallie School, an elite  
Christian school for boys that counts Ted Turner and Pat Robertson 
among its alumni. A three-year letterman in tennis and president of 
the school's National Honor Society, Ray got perfect 800s on his 
SATs and has spent part of his last three summers building houses 
for the poor in Ecuador and Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet even a young man of purpose and privilege cannot escape the  
hardships of his era. Ray was depressed for months after his 
parents divorced three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I went through a period where I thought that I could do it, I  
could get them back together,'' he says. ``I was praying every 
night to God to give me the strength to get them back together. 
When I realized I wasn't going to be able to do that, I completely 
quit praying. I didn't want to talk to God for two or three 
months.'' 
</P>
<P>
	How important is family? Ask Brad Lambrecht, the North Dakota  
farm boy who wants to be a musician. 
</P>
<P>
	He says his father would love it if he stayed on the farm, which  
has been in the family for five generations. They've talked about 
it for hours and hours, and Lambrecht knows it won't be easy to 
leave. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet he will leave, he's sure of that now, and he'll go knowing  
his parents are proud of him. Like his Y2K classmates across 
America, Lambrecht stands somewhat uncertainly at the edge of 
adulthood, eager for freedom but still reaching, if ever so 
quietly, for the familiar security of home. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got the greatest parents I could ask for,'' Lambrecht  
says. ``But don't ever tell them that.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	DILI, Indonesia (AP) -- Members of the U.N. Security Council  
toured the blackened ruins of East Timor's capital Saturday, 
eliciting from Indonesia's defense minister a vague commitment to 
allow foreign troops into the troubled province. 
</P>
<P>
	But hours later, the minister -- Gen. Wiranto -- backtracked,  
omitting the crucial reference to peacekeepers. And at a United 
Nations meeting, an Indonesian representative said Indonesia will 
not allow a foreign peacekeeping force for now. 
</P>
<P>
	From the Vatican to Washington, foreign leaders have showered a  
barrage of criticism on the Indonesian government for its failure 
to halt the savage slaughter sweeping East Timor. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton was among those turning up the heat: He halted  
$100 million in arms sales to Jakarta and said for the first time 
that the United States might provide support -- including limited 
U.S. technical and intelligence personnel -- if a U.N. peacekeeping 
force is formed. 
</P>
<P>
	In the provincial capital of Dili, entire neighborhoods were  
burned to the ground and no pro-independence supporters appeared to 
be left. Numerous soldiers patrolled the streets, and some 
pro-Indonesia militiamen roamed about carrying automatic weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	In other spots, houses and shops appeared to have been destroyed  
in a more selective manner, with untouched buildings often flying 
the red-and-white Indonesian flag. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses gave horrific accounts of the last week, during which  
machete-wielding militias aided by Indonesian troops went on a 
rampage after a U.N.-organized referendum showed that four-fifths 
of East Timor's 800,000 people favored breaking from Indonesia. 
</P>
<P>
	In one of the most shocking reports, Australian Isa Bradridge  
said in an interview in the Sydney Morning Herald that his wife saw 
``thousands of bodies'' piled in a large jail cell in the police 
station in Dili. 
</P>
<P>
	``Stacks of bodies up to the roof,'' Bradridge was quoted as  
saying. ``I know it is hard to believe, but it is absolutely true. 
My wife saw arms and legs dripping blood.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aid agencies estimate that anywhere between 600 and 7,000 people  
have been killed and 100,000 driven into West Timor or to other 
islands, and 200,000 more chased from their homes. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, the U.N. Security Council publicly demanded that  
the Jakarta government allow an international peacekeeping force to 
be immediately deployed to the former Portuguese colony. 
</P>
<P>
	Portuguese Ambassador Antonio Monteiro warned that the violence  
could destroy the credibility of the United Nations in organizing 
other referendums around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	But Indonesian Ambassador Makarim Wibisono ruled out any  
multinational force for the half-island territory for now, saying 
Indonesia's imposition of martial law on Tuesday was already 
helping improve the security situation in the territory. 
</P>
<P>
	``While fully understanding the willingness of a number of  
countries to provide security assistance, Indonesia does not 
foresee the need for the introduction of a multinational or 
peacekeeping force at this stage,'' he told an open council 
meeting. ``Such an operation may well exacerbate the situation and 
be counterproductive, however well-intentioned it may be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The European Union finance ministers said they will demand a  
suspension of International Monetary Fund aid to Indonesia if the 
bloodshed is not halted within the next two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF has already frozen talks with Indonesia on releasing the  
rest of $12.3 billion loan package meant to help the country 
recover from an economic crisis suffered in 1997-98. Indonesia 
received a $460 million IMF loan in August and another installment 
was expected in November. 
</P>
<P>
	Carlos Belo, East Timor's Roman Catholic Bishop and joint winner  
of the 1996 Nobel Peace Prize, urged pro-independence supporters to 
use arms to defend themselves against the violence, a Portuguese 
newspaper said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Belo said a decision by East Timor's separatist guerrillas not  
to respond to attacks by the militia was ``too benevolent,'' 
according to daily paper Publico. 
</P>
<P>
	``If others kill with weapons, why can't people defend  
themselves with weapons? There is self-defense, which even morals 
allow,'' said Belo, who is considered East Timor's spiritual 
leader. 
</P>
<P>
	Hopes for an end to the violence rose Saturday when Gen. Wiranto  
told a delegation of five ambassadors from the U.N. Security 
Council who were touring Dili that he would inform President B.J. 
Habibie that Indonesia should consider allowing a peacekeeping 
mission soon. 
</P>
<P>
	But just hours later Wiranto backtracked, telling reporters he'd  
look at ``security cooperation,'' omitting the crucial reference to 
peacekeepers. 
</P>
<P>
	If peacekeepers were allowed into the territory, the only  
country ready to go at a moment's notice is Australia, which has 
come under intense criticism in Indonesia for alleged meddling in 
East Timor's affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	Other countries would mostly likely need at least several weeks  
to pull a credible force together. The United States is virtually 
certain to keep soldiers out of the conflict, but Clinton has 
offered logistical assistance, including airlift, intelligence and 
communications support. 
</P>
<P>
	Pat Burgess, a U.N. official, estimated that up to 200,000 East  
Timorese have taken refuge in the mountains. Some 30,000 were in a 
camp at Dare, some six miles south of Dili. 
</P>
<P>
	He said these people were reduced to living off root plants, as  
there was little else available at the height of the dry season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unless there is urgent and widespread humanitarian aid there  
will be a disaster. This cannot happen unless security situation is 
under control,'' Burgess said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mary Robinson, the U.N. high commissioner for human rights,  
called off a Sunday trip to Dili to see for herself the extent of 
human rights violations there. Her office gave no reason. It was 
not clear if the trip had been postponed or canceled. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesia invaded East Timor in 1975 as the Portuguese were  
making a quick exit from their troubled colony. More than 200,000 
people are estimated to have died in the quarter-century since then 
in one of the world's most ignored conflicts.

<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- Waving Puerto Rican flags, singing  
nationalist songs and banging madly on leather ``pandereta'' drums, 
supporters welcomed home ``as a king'' the first of 11 prisoners 
granted a controversial pardon by President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	The hero's welcome for Chicago-born Edwin Cortes on Friday night  
was repeated today, when six more prisoners are expected -- living 
symbols of a nationhood many here believe in and cherish after a 
century of U.S. rule. Two more are to arrive Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope to follow the examples (of) Nelson Mandela, Gerry Adams  
and Yasser Arafat, who were also labeled as criminals and 
terrorists but in the minds of their people were patriots,'' 
Cortes, 44, said upon his release earlier Friday. ``Today, they are 
considered international statesmen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This week's clemency deal brought renewed censure upon the  
president and underscored Washington's complicated relationship 
with this Spanish-speaking Caribbean island, which some still call 
a colony. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics said Clinton was soft on terrorism: All but one of the  
released belonged to a group responsible for 130 bombings between 
1973 and 1984, killing six and maiming dozens. Puerto Ricans have 
argued that the sentences against them -- from 35 to 90 years -- were 
excessive for people convicted of sedition but not the actual 
bombings. Still, the attacks stopped after the arrests. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands marched in San Juan two weeks ago to demand the  
prisoners' release, which many here considered a humanitarian 
cause. But only a couple hundred people showed up at the airport 
today, reflecting the miniscule support for their campaign for 
independence -- less than 3 percent in a December referendum -- after 
101 years of U.S. rule that have brought a measure of prosperity 
and stability. 
</P>
<P>
	But the tremendous sympathy for the returning prisoners was  
evident in the group who waited hours -- some screaming with joy -- 
for a delayed flight to greet Cortes, who had served 16 1/2 years of 
his 90-year sentence in jail in Lewisburg, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	People banged drums, frantically shook maracas, waved posters of  
the ex-prisoners and belted out nationalist songs in Spanish. 
Singing the nationalist version of the unofficial Puerto Rican 
anthem, they replaced the line promoting ``Puerto Rico -- the island 
of the sea and the sun'' with ``Puerto Rico -- the land of freedom, 
freedom, freedom.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mary Cortes hailed ``a great victory'' and said she couldn't  
wait to hug and kiss the brother she has not seen for 16 years, and 
``serve him as a king.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cortes -- like many of his fellow ex-prisoners -- has never lived  
on the island where, despite sympathy for his cause, the 
overwhelming majority favor either maintaining the status quo or 
upgrading ties to the United States and becoming the 51st state. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the current ``commonwealth'' arrangement, the island of  
3.8 million is a semi-autonomous U.S. territory whose people do not 
pay federal taxes but receive more than $10 billion annually in 
federal aid. They are citizens but cannot vote for president and 
are eligible for the draft. Thousands served in Vietnam, including 
one prisoner awarded the bronze star of valor who turned down the 
clemency offer on principle. 
</P>
<P>
	Their sole representative in Congress doesn't have a vote.  
</P>
<P>
	That representative, Carlos Romero Barcelo, a Republican who has  
always been against pardoning the prisoners, warned Friday that 
their release and its embrace by islanders have further damaged 
Puerto Ricans' image in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, there's an impression in the United States that  
Puerto Ricans support terrorism,'' he told Telemundo television. 
``There will be repercussions for people who work (in the United 
States), people who are looking for employment and the Puerto Rican 
community in general.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, instead of helping heal resentments, the clemency seemed  
to deepen rifts. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's act of forgiveness prompted charges he was trying to  
promote his wife's nascent effort to run for the Senate by helping 
her with the 1.3 million Puerto Ricans in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton initially herself has distanced herself from the  
clemency. But as the first of the nationalists was set free, she 
admitted she may have been hasty in reaching her decision to oppose 
their release. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a number of Hispanic advisers and ... I have to admit  
that the consultation process was not what it should have been and 
that will never happen again,'' Hillary Rodham Clinton told over 
300 Hispanic, black and Asian women leaders on Friday in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Several law enforcement agencies opposed the release and on  
Thursday, the House of Representatives condemned the clemency offer 
on a 311-41 vote that included many Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the prisoners' supporters resented the conditions  
attached: Beyond renouncing violence, the prisoners must avoid 
meeting with other convicted felons, which if applied broadly could 
seriously hinder their plans to work together for independence -- or 
even celebrate their release. 
</P>
<P>
	The first four to arrive today -- sisters Alicia and Ida Luz  
Rodriguez, Dylcia Pagan and Carmen Valentin -- remained in a transit 
lounge at the airport for hours because of a technicality that 
allows them to be together there without breaking parole. 
</P>
<P>
	A planned massive party to welcome them might turn into ``nine  
huge parties'' because of the parole conditions, spokesman Luis 
Nieves Falcon said. Probation officers might have given permission 
for them to be together, but the parole office in San Juan has been 
closed since Tuesday and the director is attending a seminar off 
the island, Falcon said. 
</P>
<P>
	The releases propelled family members into the kitchen to  
prepare long-anticipated treats not savored in two decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Pagan said after she was released Friday that she ``can't wait  
to taste bacalaitos fritos,'' fritters of the dried codfish that 
were a staple of slaves and still are much favored in Puerto Rico.

	This week's clemency deal brought renewed censure upon the  
president and underscored Washington's complicated relationship 
with this Spanish-speaking Caribbean island, which some still call 
a colony. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics said Clinton was soft on terrorism: All but one of the  
released belonged to a group responsible for 130 bombings between 
1973 and 1984, killing six and maiming dozens. Puerto Ricans have 
argued that the sentences against them -- from 35 to 90 years -- were 
excessive for people convicted of sedition but not the actual 
bombings. Still, the attacks stopped after the arrests. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands marched in San Juan two weeks ago to demand the  
prisoners' release, which many here considered a humanitarian 
cause. But only a couple hundred people showed up at the airport 
today, reflecting the miniscule support for their campaign for 
independence -- less than 3 percent in a December referendum -- after 
101 years of U.S. rule that have brought a measure of prosperity 
and stability. 
</P>
<P>
	But the tremendous sympathy for the returning prisoners was  
evident in the group who waited hours -- some screaming with joy -- 
for a delayed flight to greet Cortes, who had served 16 1/2 years of 
his 90-year sentence in jail in Lewisburg, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	People banged drums, frantically shook maracas, waved posters of  
the ex-prisoners and belted out nationalist songs in Spanish. 
Singing the nationalist version of the unofficial Puerto Rican 
anthem, they replaced the line promoting ``Puerto Rico -- the island 
of the sea and the sun'' with ``Puerto Rico -- the land of freedom, 
freedom, freedom.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mary Cortes hailed ``a great victory'' and said she couldn't  
wait to hug and kiss the brother she has not seen for 16 years, and 
``serve him as a king.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cortes -- like many of his fellow ex-prisoners -- has never lived  
on the island where, despite sympathy for his cause, the 
overwhelming majority favor either maintaining the status quo or 
upgrading ties to the United States and becoming the 51st state. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the current ``commonwealth'' arrangement, the island of  
3.8 million is a semi-autonomous U.S. territory whose people do not 
pay federal taxes but receive more than $10 billion annually in 
federal aid. They are citizens but cannot vote for president and 
are eligible for the draft. Thousands served in Vietnam, including 
one prisoner awarded the bronze star of valor who turned down the 
clemency offer on principle. 
</P>
<P>
	Their sole representative in Congress doesn't have a vote.  
</P>
<P>
	That representative, Carlos Romero Barcelo, a Republican who has  
always been against pardoning the prisoners, warned Friday that 
their release and its embrace by islanders have further damaged 
Puerto Ricans' image in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, there's an impression in the United States that  
Puerto Ricans support terrorism,'' he told Telemundo television. 
``There will be repercussions for people who work (in the United 
States), people who are looking for employment and the Puerto Rican 
community in general.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, instead of helping heal resentments, the clemency seemed  
to deepen rifts. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's act of forgiveness prompted charges he was trying to  
promote his wife's nascent effort to run for the Senate by helping 
her with the 1.3 million Puerto Ricans in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton initially herself has distanced herself from the  
clemency. But as the first of the nationalists was set free, she 
admitted she may have been hasty in reaching her decision to oppose 
their release. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a number of Hispanic advisers and ... I have to admit  
that the consultation process was not what it should have been and 
that will never happen again,'' Hillary Rodham Clinton told over 
300 Hispanic, black and Asian women leaders on Friday in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Several law enforcement agencies opposed the release and on  
Thursday, the House of Representatives condemned the clemency offer 
on a 311-41 vote that included many Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the prisoners' supporters resented the conditions  
attached: Beyond renouncing violence, the prisoners must avoid 
meeting with other convicted felons, which if applied broadly could 
seriously hinder their plans to work together for independence -- or 
even celebrate their release. 
</P>
<P>
	The first four to arrive today -- sisters Alicia and Ida Luz  
Rodriguez, Dylcia Pagan and Carmen Valentin -- remained in a transit 
lounge at the airport for hours because of a technicality that 
allows them to be together there without breaking parole. 
</P>
<P>
	A planned massive party to welcome them might turn into ``nine  
huge parties'' because of the parole conditions, spokesman Luis 
Nieves Falcon said. Probation officers might have given permission 
for them to be together, but the parole office in San Juan has been 
closed since Tuesday and the director is attending a seminar off 
the island, Falcon said. 
</P>
<P>
	The releases propelled family members into the kitchen to  
prepare long-anticipated treats not savored in two decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Pagan said after she was released Friday that she ``can't wait  
to taste bacalaitos fritos,'' fritters of the dried codfish that 
were a staple of slaves and still are much favored in Puerto Rico.

<HEADLINE>  Unmasked Soviet Spy Has No Regrets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- An elderly woman exposed as an important,  
long-serving Soviet spy says that she would do it all again, 
because of her belief in communism. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did what I did, not to make money, but to help prevent the  
defeat of a new system which had at great cost given ordinary 
people food and fares which they could afford, good education and a 
health service,'' Melita Norwood said, reading a statement Saturday 
outside her home in suburban Bexleyheath. 
</P>
<P>
	The 87-year-old was quoted in Saturday's editions of The Times  
as saying: ``In the same circumstances, I know that I would do the 
same thing again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The opposition Conservative Party demanded a statement from the  
government on Mrs. Norwood's case and on The Times' report that 
prosecution for espionage was ruled out last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Home Office said Saturday that Home Secretary Jack Straw was  
not involved in any decision to block prosecution. ``Decisions on 
prosecutions in such matters are made by law officers and the 
prosecuting authorities and never by the home secretary,'' it said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Norwood reportedly had access to British atomic secrets  
through her office job at the British Non-Ferrous Metals Research 
Association, which was involved in metallurgical research 
associated with the bomb project, The Times said. 
</P>
<P>
	The extent of Mrs. Norwood's access to British secrets has not  
been determined, The Times said. ``It wasn't much,'' she told the 
newspaper, and she denied its report that she had received the 
Order of the Red Banner, said to be the KGB's highest honor. 
</P>
<P>
	Her work was disclosed in ``The Mitrokhin Archive,'' a new book  
by Christopher Andrew, professor of modern and contemporary history 
at Cambridge University. The Times began serializing excerpts in 
Saturday's editions. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew's work reportedly was based on files supplied by Vasili  
Mitrokhin, a former archivist for the KGB, the Soviet intelligence 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
	The British Broadcasting Corp. said Mrs. Norwood had also  
cooperated in the preparation of a television documentary, ``The 
Spying Game,'' scheduled for broadcast in Britain on Sept. 19. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew said Mrs. Norwood -- identified in The Times only by her  
codename, Hola -- began working at the British Non-Ferrous Metals 
Research Association in 1932, when she was 20. 
</P>
<P>
	``Despite her comparatively lowly position, she was later to  
gain access to important scientific and technological 
intelligence,'' he wrote in The Times. 
</P>
<P>
	``In 1935, Hola was recommended to the NKVD (the predecessor of  
the KGB) by Andrew Rothstein, one of the founders of the British 
Communist Party. By 1937 she was a fully recruited agent,'' Andrew 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Her KGB file described her as a ``committed, reliable and  
disciplined agent, striving to be of the utmost assistance,'' 
Andrew said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Personally, I only worked in the general office, and am not  
technical. I thought that perhaps some of what I had access to 
might be useful in helping Russia to keep abreast of Britain, 
America and Germany,'' Mrs. Norwood said in her statement to 
reporters Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``In general I do not agree with spying against one's country.  
My late husband did not agree with what I did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She refused to answer questions, muttering ``no, no, no'' after  
a reporter shouted, ``Any regrets?'' It wasn't clear whether she 
was answering the question or indicating that she wouldn't answer. 
</P>
<P>
	In her statement, she complimented Winston Churchill for  
cooperating with the Soviet Union in the war against Germany, and 
said she had made a contribution to Mrs. Churchill's ``aid Russia 
fund.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Norwood was sincerely committed to Soviet ideals despite  
the gross abuses of Josef Stalin's regime, Andrew said. 
</P>
<P>
	``But it was not the reality of this monstrous regime that she  
saw, but a myth image of the first state run by and for working 
people in which they, unlike British workers in the 1930s, didn't 
have to suffer the horrors of mass unemployment and were not part 
of a society which suffered from excruciating class snobbery,'' 
Andrew said.

<HEADLINE> German Utility Giants May Merge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERLIN (AP) -- German utility giants Veba and Viag have worked  
out a merger proposal and expect to complete the deal within weeks, 
according to media reports Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Both companies' chairmen have drafted a roughly 20-page accord  
that would merge their energy and chemical businesses and also 
include Viag's telecommunications unit, the weekly Der Spiegel 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bavarian governor Edmund Stoiber, whose state owns 25.1 percent  
of Viag, was quoted in the Welt am Sonntag newspaper as saying that 
the merger talks are ``very far advanced'' and he expected them to 
wrap up within weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Bavaria must approve the proposal. The state government has said  
it wants to sell its Viag stake by 2003 but also wants to protect 
the 20,000 jobs Viag has in Bavaria. The merger also requires the 
approval of German antitrust authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies' proposal calls for shareholders to vote on the  
merger early next year so the new conglomerate can start business 
by mid-2000, Der Spiegel said. 
</P>
<P>
	Company officials could not be reached for comment Saturday.  
</P>
<P>
	Veba and Viag are the second- and third-largest German energy  
companies, respectively, in terms of sales. Combined, they would 
move into the top spot in the country with total 1998 sales of 
$10.9 billion, but they would still trail Electricite de France.

<HEADLINE> F-22 Fighters Cost $185M Apiece </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Some keys features of the F-22 Raptor, the new-generation Air  
Force fighter that some in Congress want to slow down or cancel: 
</P>
<P>
	--Cost: At a projected total cost for 339 planes of about $63  
billion, including research and development, each plane would cost 
about $185 million. This year's defense budget includes $2.4 
billion for the F-22, and the administration is requesting another 
$3.1 billion in the fiscal 2000 budget. 
</P>
<P>
	--Air speed: Mach 2, or twice the speed of sound.  
</P>
<P>
	--Mission: To defeat an enemy's air defenses in order to  
establish U.S. superiority in the air battle, clearing the way for 
air-to-ground fighters and bombers to attack with impunity. Also, 
to protect slower-moving support planes in the battle area, such as 
refuelers, communications planes and surveillance aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
	--Schedule: The Air Force is to begin operating the first unit of  
F-22s in 2005. The last of the fleet is to be delivered by 2013.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Film Tops Venice Festival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VENICE, Italy (AP) -- Spurned by Cannes, the Chinese film ``Not  
One Less,'' directed by Zhang Yimou, took the top prize at the 56th 
edition of the Venice Film Festival Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury's special prize went to ``The Wind Will Carry Us,'' by  
Iranian director Abbas Kiarostami. 
</P>
<P>
	Best acting honors went to French actress Nathalie Baye for ``A  
Pornographic Liaison,'' the unpornographic story of a couple's 
weekly hotel-room trysts by Belgian director Frederic Fonteyne, and 
to Britain's Jim Broadbent for his role as the Gilbert half of the 
operetta team Gilbert and Sullivan in Mike Leigh's ``Topsy-Turvy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another Chinese director, Zhang Yuan, won the special prize for  
directing for ``Seventeen Years,'' the story of a family split by 
murder. The award for an emerging actor or actress went to Nina 
Proll in the Austrian film about generational angst, ``Nordland,'' 
directed by Barbara Albert. 
</P>
<P>
	The festival also awarded a prize for the first time this year  
to the best first film by a director. It went to Italy's Giovanni 
Davide Maderna for ``This is the Garden,'' the story of a young 
couple in love. 
</P>
<P>
	American comedian Jerry Lewis was also honored with a lifetime  
achievement award. It was presented by director Martin Scorsese, 
who praised Lewis as a ``genuine American artist'' who ``created a 
truly modern kind of physical comedy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zhang Yimou's previous hits include ``Raise the Red Lantern.''  
His ``Not One Less'' features a cast of non-actors, most of them 
children. It tells the story of a 13-year-old schoolgirl who is 
recruited as a substitute teacher in a Chinese village when the 
real teacher has to leave to go see his sick mother. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope all children can have a happy childhood,'' said the  
director of ``Not One Less,'' which the Cannes Film Festival 
rejected for official competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Chinese films employ a naturalistic narrative style that  
stood in stark contrast to some of the popular favorites of the 
festival, such as the surreal American comedy ``Being John 
Malkovich,'' which screened out of competition. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our way of directing is very simple,'' said Zhang Yimou, whose  
film was financed by Columbia Tristar. ``But it's a way that shows 
the humanity of the people in our films.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like ``Not One Less,'' ``The Wind Will Carry Us'' also deals  
with village life, in this case a little Kurdish hamlet where life 
suddenly upset by the arrival of a group of strangers from Tehran 
whom the villagers mistakenly think are searching for treasure.

<HEADLINE> German Party Faces Test in Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERLIN (AP) -- A week after a stinging defeat for his party in  
two state elections, Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder faced a new tough 
test Sunday in the eastern state of Thuringia. 
</P>
<P>
	Polls showed the chancellor's Social Democrats losing ground in  
the state, putting the conservative Christian Democrats within 
reach of a majority that would allow them to end their alliance 
with the Social Democrats there and govern alone. 
</P>
<P>
	Thuringia's four votes in the 69-seat upper house then would  
swing solidly to the opposition camp. That would make it even 
harder for Schroeder to pass his legislation, including a 
three-year government austerity plan. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the Social Democrats were bracing for losses in  
voting for local councils in North Rhine-Westphalia, the western 
industrial heartland that has been one of the party's strongholds 
for decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Schroeder's center-left coalition lost its safe majority in the  
upper house last February when the Social Democrats lost the Hesse 
state government. Their position weakened further after losing last 
Sunday in Saarland and Brandenburg states. 
</P>
<P>
	A year after his election, Schroeder's popularity has slid to an  
all-time low -- the result of bruising policy fights in the 
coalition, proposals to cut Germany's social safety net and 
unemployment that remains stuck above 10 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The chancellor tried to rally his party Saturday at an event  
with local Social Democrat functionaries in Emden in his home state 
of Lower Saxony. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must not lose our self-confidence,'' he told the meeting.  
``We have to mobilize our will to fight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He again defended his austerity budget against critics --  
including leftists in his own party -- who say it's unfairly harsh. 
</P>
<P>
	Schroeder's attempts to steer his party toward the political  
center have alienated many traditional left-wing voters, while 
centrist voters who lifted him into the chancellery seem to have 
increasingly lost confidence in his leadership. 
</P>
<P>
	In Thuringia, polls show the Social Democrats, led by state  
Interior Minister Richard Dewes, coming in at 22 percent, down 
about eight points from 1994. Governor Bernhard Vogel's Christian 
Democrats were up about two points from the last election, at 45 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The far-right German People's Union, which entered the  
Brandenburg state parliament for the first time last weekend, took 
its anti-immigrant campaign to Thuringia. But polls indicated the 
extreme right vote would be split between several parties, 
preventing them from winning seats in the state legislature.

<HEADLINE> CNN Details Atlanta Olympic Papers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Cable News Network says it obtained documents of  
Atlanta Olympics bid organizers indicating that they thought some 
members of the International Olympic Committee could be bribed into 
voting for the city as the site of the 1996 Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The documents are among eight boxes of records turned over to  
congressional investigators, but were not among some 6,000 boxes 
made available to the public earlier this year, CNN reported 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It appears as though there was a concerted effort to figure  
out how they might be able to buy votes for Atlanta. A dossier, 
maybe on most, if not all, of the voting members,'' Rep. Fred 
Upton, who chairs the subcommittee leading the investigation, told 
CNN. 
</P>
<P>
	Sources told The Associated Press a month ago that records under  
review by a House Commerce subcommittee contain ``several 
references to scholarships'' for relatives of IOC members, along 
with non-Olympic travel for some. 
</P>
<P>
	CNN said a memo written by a lawyer who worked to win the 1996  
Games for Atlanta described inside information he researched about 
IOC members, and named those members who ``can be bought.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another document in the files describes some IOC members'  
tastes, noting that for one of them ``gifts are OK. Gift of female 
OK.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another reported ``will sell his vote, and will do so openly''  
but added the caution, ``Do not waste your time on him. To cave in 
to his wishes will get Atlanta into trouble.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yet another memo described how an IOC official ``likes the good  
life, wine, women (some say men, as well) and song. Visit to 
Atlanta should be low key with press but an all-out orgy, ...'' the 
network reported. 
</P>
<P>
	An Atlanta Games spokesman told CNN the confidential memos were  
prepared simply to gather information about the Olympic bidding 
process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Although language in the memos may sound somewhat  
sensational,'' spokesman Lee Echols said, ``that was the language 
of others, not ours.'' 
</P>
<P>
	CNN said it found no evidence that bribes were paid.  
</P>
<P>
	Sources close to the congressional investigation have told the  
AP that the documents also mention several gifts worth well over 
$1,000 not previously acknowledged by the local organizers. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no indication whether the scholarships or gifts were  
accepted by IOC members, said the sources, who refused to give 
further details.

<P>
	AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) -- Nobel laureate Jose Ramos Horta  
appealed Saturday for urgent action to prevent mass slaughter and 
starvation in his homeland of East Timor. 
</P>
<P>
	Tens of thousands more East Timorese could die unless a  
peacekeeping force and humanitarian aid are sent to the region, 
said Horta, in Auckland, New Zealand, where the annual meeting of 
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum is being held. 
</P>
<P>
	``World leaders, wherever they are, cannot pretend to be locked  
up in the hotels, discussing only trade statistics when the houses 
around them are burning down,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton announced the U.S. would halt military sales  
to Indonesia to pressure its government to allow international 
peacekeeping troops into the troubled territory. 
</P>
<P>
	Dili, the provincial capital, has been ravaged by fire, and  
militiamen have reportedly killed hundreds since East Timorese 
voted in favor of independence from Indonesia in a U.N.-sponsored 
referendum. Some 200,000 East Timorese have fled their homes in the 
last week, aid agencies estimate. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesia's government has refused to accept U.N. peacekeepers  
to help quell violence, although Defense Minister Wiranto on 
Saturday made a vague commitment to consider allowing foreign 
troops into the province. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton suggested that turning up the pressure on Indonesia  
could help ``persuade the Indonesians to support a United Nations 
operation to go in and help to end the violence and secure the 
safety of the people there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we're making good headway,'' he added. ``I think  
you'll see a development here in the next couple of days.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said Clinton's order  
could affect military deals involving hundreds of millions of 
dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramos Horta, 50, who shared the 1996 Nobel Peace Prize with East  
Timor's spiritual leader, Bishop Carlos Belo, said his sources in 
East Timor estimate that at least 1,000 people have been killed in 
the last week alone. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday night, Ramos Horta cheered on about 500 demonstrators who  
marched to the APEC media center calling for independence for East 
Timor. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramos Horta said he will meet with Clinton on Monday to seek his  
support. The East Timorese activist has already met in Auckland 
with New Zealand Prime Minister Jenny Shipley and Australian 
Foreign Minister Alexander Downer. 
</P>
<P>
	On his way to Auckland, Clinton spent much of the long flight  
talking with U.S. military and political leaders about the chaos in 
East Timor. 
</P>
<P>
	Australian Prime Minister John Howard said Saturday that  
Australia, New Zealand, Britain, Canada, Portugal, Malaysia and the 
Philippines had offered to provide peacekeepers to an international 
force. 
</P>
<P>
	He hinted that in his discussions with Clinton in the last 24  
hours, the United States might be willing to join the peacekeeping 
force. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, no nation appeared ready to join a peacekeeping force  
without an invitation from Jakarta. 
</P>
<P>
	``You really have to wait for an Indonesian request and it has  
to go through the United Nations,'' said Philippine Foreign 
Secretary Domingo Siazon, who is also attending the APEC meetings. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unless you're prepared to get into a major war with the  
Indonesian army, you don't invade East Timor. If you do invade East 
Timor, you end up with what you are trying to prevent, and maybe 
worse.''

<HEADLINE> Bradley Sees March 'Takeoff Point' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JOHNSTON, Iowa (AP) -- Former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley  
predicted his bid for the Democratic presidential nomination will 
experience a ``takeoff point'' during a heavy round of primaries 
March 7. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think that I'd be in this race if I couldn't see my  
way through to 270, the number of electoral votes you need to win 
the presidency, which also means I can see my way through to 
getting the nomination,'' Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore has the backing of much of the Democratic  
establishment and leads in many early polls, but Bradley, in Iowa 
for a television appearance, professed not to be worried. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have to do better than expected in Iowa. I then have to do  
well in New Hampshire,'' said Bradley. ``Then the takeoff point is 
March 7, when 50 percent of the delegates will be selected.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On that day, giant states like California and New York, as well  
as much of New England and big Midwestern states like Ohio hold 
primaries. And Bradley predicted success in several. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to win a number of places on March 7,'' said Bradley.  
</P>
<P>
	Bradley noted his home state of Missouri votes that day. Also,  
he represented New Jersey in the Senate for 18 years and was a 
basketball star in New York before that, which give him high name 
recognition in the Northeast. 
</P>
<P>
	His description of the region: ``My media market for 30 years.''  
</P>
<P>
	Although he is not talking about it, Bradley also is seeking  
voters tired of the scandals that have dogged President Clinton, 
problems that spill over to Gore in what has been described as 
``Clinton fatigue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's a delicate issue for Bradley, because direct attacks on  
Clinton could backfire with many party regulars. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no calculation to take advantage of how people may or  
may not feel about the president,'' said Bradley. ``This is an 
attempt to turn the page and move on to a new time in our 
politics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley conceded he faces long odds in seeking to deny the  
nomination to a sitting vice president. ``I'm up against 
establishment power,'' said Bradley. ``I'm up against tremendous 
resources.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He rejected suggestions that history was running against him  
because sitting vice presidents who want their party's nomination 
almost always have been chosen. 
</P>
<P>
	``The point is, historical analogies are basically irrelevant  
here one way or the other,'' said Bradley. ``Every election is new. 
Every election is shaped by the dynamics of that time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Success in early primaries will move pragmatists to his  
campaign, Bradley argued. 
</P>
<P>
	``You find that a lot of congressman who are in swing districts  
are at this moment becoming a little concerned because of the 
negatives the vice president has,'' Bradley said after the TV 
taping. ``Success in the early primaries can ameliorate what seems 
now to be a disadvantage.''

<HEADLINE> Chinese Film Tops Venice Festival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VENICE, Italy (AP) -- Spurned by Cannes, the Chinese film ``Not  
One Less,'' directed by Zhang Yimou, took the top prize at the 56th 
edition of the Venice Film Festival Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury's special prize went to ``The Wind Will Carry Us,'' by  
Iranian director Abbas Kiarostami. 
</P>
<P>
	Best acting honors went to French actress Nathalie Baye for ``A  
Pornographic Liaison,'' the unpornographic story of a couple's 
weekly hotel-room trysts by Belgian director Frederic Fonteyne, and 
to Britain's Jim Broadbent for his role as the Gilbert half of the 
operetta team Gilbert and Sullivan in Mike Leigh's ``Topsy-Turvy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another Chinese director, Zhang Yuan, won the special prize for  
directing for ``Seventeen Years,'' the story of a family split by 
murder. The award for an emerging actor or actress went to Nina 
Proll in the Austrian film about generational angst, ``Nordland,'' 
directed by Barbara Albert. 
</P>
<P>
	The festival also awarded a prize for the first time this year  
to the best first film by a director. It went to Italy's Giovanni 
Davide Maderna for ``This is the Garden,'' the story of a young 
couple in love. 
</P>
<P>
	American comedian Jerry Lewis was also honored with a lifetime  
achievement award. It was presented by director Martin Scorsese, 
who praised Lewis as a ``genuine American artist'' who ``created a 
truly modern kind of physical comedy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zhang Yimou's previous hits include ``Raise the Red Lantern.''  
His ``Not One Less'' features a cast of non-actors, most of them 
children. It tells the story of a 13-year-old schoolgirl who is 
recruited as a substitute teacher in a Chinese village when the 
real teacher has to leave to go see his sick mother. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope all children can have a happy childhood,'' said the  
director of ``Not One Less,'' which the Cannes Film Festival 
rejected for official competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Chinese films employ a naturalistic narrative style that  
stood in stark contrast to some of the popular favorites of the 
festival, such as the surreal American comedy ``Being John 
Malkovich,'' which screened out of competition. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our way of directing is very simple,'' said Zhang Yimou, whose  
film was financed by Columbia Tristar. ``But it's a way that shows 
the humanity of the people in our films.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like ``Not One Less,'' ``The Wind Will Carry Us'' also deals  
with village life, in this case a little Kurdish hamlet where life 
suddenly upset by the arrival of a group of strangers from Tehran 
whom the villagers mistakenly think are searching for treasure.

<HEADLINE> Pardoned Militants Return As Heroes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- Waving Puerto Rican flags, singing  
nationalist songs and banging madly on leather ``pandereta'' drums, 
supporters welcomed home ``as a king'' the first of 11 prisoners 
granted a controversial pardon by President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	The hero's welcome for Chicago-born Edwin Cortes on Friday night  
was repeated today, when six more prisoners are expected -- living 
symbols of a nationhood many here believe in and cherish after a 
century of U.S. rule. Two more are to arrive Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope to follow the examples (of) Nelson Mandela, Gerry Adams  
and Yasser Arafat, who were also labeled as criminals and 
terrorists but in the minds of their people were patriots,'' 
Cortes, 44, said upon his release earlier Friday. ``Today, they are 
considered international statesmen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This week's clemency deal brought renewed censure upon the  
president and underscored Washington's complicated relationship 
with this Spanish-speaking Caribbean island, which some still call 
a colony. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics said Clinton was soft on terrorism: All but one of the  
released belonged to a group responsible for 130 bombings between 
1973 and 1984, killing six and maiming dozens. Puerto Ricans have 
argued that the sentences against them -- from 35 to 90 years -- were 
excessive for people convicted of sedition but not the actual 
bombings. Still, the attacks stopped after the arrests. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands marched in San Juan two weeks ago to demand the  
prisoners' release, which many here considered a humanitarian 
cause. But only a couple hundred people showed up at the airport 
today, reflecting the miniscule support for their campaign for 
independence -- less than 3 percent in a December referendum -- after 
101 years of U.S. rule that have brought a measure of prosperity 
and stability. 
</P>
<P>
	But the tremendous sympathy for the returning prisoners was  
evident in the group who waited hours -- some screaming with joy -- 
for a delayed flight to greet Cortes, who had served 16 1/2 years of 
his 90-year sentence in jail in Lewisburg, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	People banged drums, frantically shook maracas, waved posters of  
the ex-prisoners and belted out nationalist songs in Spanish. 
Singing the nationalist version of the unofficial Puerto Rican 
anthem, they replaced the line promoting ``Puerto Rico -- the island 
of the sea and the sun'' with ``Puerto Rico -- the land of freedom, 
freedom, freedom.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mary Cortes hailed ``a great victory'' and said she couldn't  
wait to hug and kiss the brother she has not seen for 16 years, and 
``serve him as a king.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cortes -- like many of his fellow ex-prisoners -- has never lived  
on the island where, despite sympathy for his cause, the 
overwhelming majority favor either maintaining the status quo or 
upgrading ties to the United States and becoming the 51st state. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the current ``commonwealth'' arrangement, the island of  
3.8 million is a semi-autonomous U.S. territory whose people do not 
pay federal taxes but receive more than $10 billion annually in 
federal aid. They are citizens but cannot vote for president and 
are eligible for the draft. Thousands served in Vietnam, including 
one prisoner awarded the bronze star of valor who turned down the 
clemency offer on principle. 
</P>
<P>
	Their sole representative in Congress doesn't have a vote.  
</P>
<P>
	That representative, Carlos Romero Barcelo, a Republican who has  
always been against pardoning the prisoners, warned Friday that 
their release and its embrace by islanders have further damaged 
Puerto Ricans' image in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, there's an impression in the United States that  
Puerto Ricans support terrorism,'' he told Telemundo television. 
``There will be repercussions for people who work (in the United 
States), people who are looking for employment and the Puerto Rican 
community in general.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, instead of helping heal resentments, the clemency seemed  
to deepen rifts. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's act of forgiveness prompted charges he was trying to  
promote his wife's nascent effort to run for the Senate by helping 
her with the 1.3 million Puerto Ricans in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton initially herself has distanced herself from the  
clemency. But as the first of the nationalists was set free, she 
admitted she may have been hasty in reaching her decision to oppose 
their release. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a number of Hispanic advisers and ... I have to admit  
that the consultation process was not what it should have been and 
that will never happen again,'' Hillary Rodham Clinton told over 
300 Hispanic, black and Asian women leaders on Friday in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Several law enforcement agencies opposed the release and on  
Thursday, the House of Representatives condemned the clemency offer 
on a 311-41 vote that included many Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the prisoners' supporters resented the conditions  
attached: Beyond renouncing violence, the prisoners must avoid 
meeting with other convicted felons, which if applied broadly could 
seriously hinder their plans to work together for independence -- or 
even celebrate their release. 
</P>
<P>
	The first four to arrive today -- sisters Alicia and Ida Luz  
Rodriguez, Dylcia Pagan and Carmen Valentin -- remained in a transit 
lounge at the airport for hours because of a technicality that 
allows them to be together there without breaking parole. 
</P>
<P>
	A planned massive party to welcome them might turn into ``nine  
huge parties'' because of the parole conditions, spokesman Luis 
Nieves Falcon said. Probation officers might have given permission 
for them to be together, but the parole office in San Juan has been 
closed since Tuesday and the director is attending a seminar off 
the island, Falcon said. 
</P>
<P>
	The releases propelled family members into the kitchen to  
prepare long-anticipated treats not savored in two decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Pagan said after she was released Friday that she ``can't wait  
to taste bacalaitos fritos,'' fritters of the dried codfish that 
were a staple of slaves and still are much favored in Puerto Rico.

<HEADLINE> Rescue Stranded on Alaskan Glacier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) -- A rescue team reached a small group of  
cruise ship passengers stranded near the 4,500-foot level of the 
Herbert Glacier, but efforts to remove them from the icefield were 
hampered by bad weather, the Coast Guard said. 
</P>
<P>
	A total of 10 people were stranded Friday after three private  
tour helicopters went down on the icefield, said Petty Officer 
Roger Wetherell. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have to set up camp overnight, stay warm and survive  
their situation till we can get crews to take those people out of 
there'' after daybreak, Wetherell said. ``They're in a pretty bad 
situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tour operator Temsco Helicopters dispatched four employees in  
two helicopters on a search mission after a sightseeing flight 
carrying a pilot and five tourists didn't return at noon Friday as 
scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
	After the search helicopters didn't return, Temsco called the  
Coast Guard. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coast Guard was able to send in a nine-member rescue team  
with food, tents and cold-weather survival gear Friday night. The 
team climbed 600 feet onto a plateau and hiked three miles through 
snow, wind and freezing temperatures before spotting a light that 
led them to the original helicopter, Wetherell said. 
</P>
<P>
	The male pilot and the five cruise ship passengers, three men  
and two women ranging in age from 40 to 72, weren't seriously 
injured. 
</P>
<P>
	The four other Temsco employees were together more than a mile  
away from the main rescue, but had ample survival equipment. One of 
the helicopters crashed onto the glacier about 20 miles north of 
Juneau, but nobody was seriously injured, Wetherell said. 
</P>
<P>
	All 10 people were forced to remain on the glacier overnight  
because of darkness and poor weather that included falling snow, 
freezing temperatures and winds up to 20 mph, Wetherell said. 
</P>
<P>
	The tourists were from the cruise ship Crown Princess.  
Helicopter tours are a popular diversion for the thousands of 
cruise ship tourists who pass through Juneau each summer.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Offers East Timor Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) -- President Clinton offered Sunday to  
provide American personnel ``in a limited way'' for an 
international peacekeeping force in violence-torn East Timor after 
he accused the Indonesian government of abetting militia violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, backed up by the United Nations General Assembly,  
demanded that a defiant Indonesia invite an international force to 
restore security to tiny East Timor. But Indonesia insisted outside 
help was not needed now. 
</P>
<P>
	The president, reviewing Asian trouble spots in an earlier  
speech to business leaders, also urged China and Taiwan to resolve 
their differences peacefully and called on North Korea to abandon 
suspected missile tests. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said that his discussions with foreign leaders about  
East Timor have been based on the idea that Australia would provide 
the bulk of manpower, but that there could also be a limited U.S. 
presence in East Timor to support a peacekeeping mission. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the United States was being asked about ``providing some  
of the things that only we can provide, probably like extensive air 
lift support to bring troops from other countries, primarily in 
Asia, into the theater.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said the United States could also provide ``other  
logistical support -- intelligence, communications, some things 
which require our presence in a limited way'' in East Timor. 
</P>
<P>
	The president said he had spoken with nearly a dozen  
congressional leaders about the crisis. Secretary of Defense 
William Cohen and White House Chief of Staff John Podesta consulted 
with others. 
</P>
<P>
	``No final decisions have been made, nor could they be until  
I've had extensive congressional consultations,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton spoke a day after the United States froze upwards of  
$100 million in military deals with Indonesia in an effort to 
pressure Jakarta into allowing the U.N. to help stem the chaos in 
East Timor. 
</P>
<P>
	However, minutes after Clinton concluded his address,  
Indonesia's ambassador to the United Nations ruled out any 
multinational force for now, saying his country's imposition of 
martial law on Tuesday was already restoring security. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said Indonesia did the right thing in allowing East  
Timor to stage an independence vote, which overwhelmingly called 
for a break with Jakarta. ``Now it is clear, however, that the 
Indonesian military has aided and abetted militia violence in East 
Timor in violation of the commitment of its leaders to the 
international community,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has allowed the militias to murder innocent people, to  
send thousands fleeing for their lives, to attack the United 
Nations compound,'' said the president. He said that beyond 
suspending military cooperation, ``I have made clear that my 
willingness to support future economic assistance from the 
international community will depend upon how Indonesia handles the 
situation from today forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The Indonesian government and military must not only stop what  
they are doing but reverse course,'' he said. ``They must halt the 
violence not just in Dili but throughout the nation. They must 
permit humanitarian assistance and let the U.N. mission do its job. 
They must allow the East Timorese who have been pushed from their 
homes to return safely. They must implement the results of the 
balloting. And they must allow an international force to help 
restore security.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After a fence-mending meeting Saturday with Chinese President  
Jiang Zemin, Clinton said he hoped Beijing and Washington could 
swiftly reach a market-opening trade deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also said he urged a peaceful solution to inflamed  
tensions with Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
	``These peoples have too much at stake in a peaceful future,  
benefiting all their children, to let the present difficulties 
deteriorate into a confrontation in which in the end all would 
suffer,'' the president said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also met with South Korean President Kim Dae-jung and  
Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi to discuss North Korea's 
apparent preparations for a long-range missile test. 
</P>
<P>
	``The people of North Korea need food and opportunities,'' the  
president said. ``They need engagement with the South, and the 
chance for a brighter future. They do not need new weaponry that 
threatens the security of the region and the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president also met with Russia's new prime minister,  
Vladimir Putin, on the heels of allegations of corruption in the 
Kremlin and reported money laundering of billions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton told the business leaders that Asia is rebounding from  
the crisis that swept the region and threw a dark cloud last year 
over the annual summit of Asia-Pacific leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	``Economies that were going downhill then now seem to be clearly  
on the road to recovery,'' the president said. As an example, he 
cited South Korea, where industrial production is up 30 percent and 
its economy is expected to grow at least 6.5 percent this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``All over the region key stock markets are now above pre-crisis  
levels,'' Clinton said. ``Currencies are stronger, workers are 
going back to work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The hour-long meeting Saturday with Jiang was viewed as a  
success by both sides after months of tensions over trade and the 
accidental bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia. The 
president's national security adviser, Sandy Berger, said relations 
between the two nations were ``back on track.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and Jiang ordered aides to resume market-opening  
negotiations aimed at allowing China to achieve its long-sought bid 
to join the World Trade Organization, the influential body that 
sets the rules for global trade. A White House aide said China's 
entry to the WTO could occur by year's end. 
</P>
<P>
	Differences over Taiwan proved the most contentious issue.  
</P>
<P>
	Jiang sharply criticized Taiwan's president, Lee Teng-hui, who  
stirred concern in Beijing and Washington by his retreat from a 
long-standing formula underpinning eventual unification between 
China and Taiwan.

<HEADLINE> Big Jag Wins at Bay Meadows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN MATEO, Calif. (AP) -- Big Jag's reputation for consistency  
was taking a beating -- until Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-year-old used a powerful move in deep stretch to  
accelerate past the leaders and win Saturday's $200,000 Bay Meadows 
Breeders' Cup Sprint at Bay Meadows. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today, he showed us he's back,'' said Jose Valdiva Jr., who  
rode Big Jag to his latest victory, which was worth $110,000 to 
owner Julius H. Zolezzi. ``I got him to the outside, and he just 
came on rolling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	From August 1998 to April, Big Jag was regarded as probably the  
West's top sprinter, putting together a run that saw him win nine 
of 10 races, including three straight Grade II stakes. 
</P>
<P>
	But he hadn't been the same since returning from a three-month  
layoff, running poorly in two stakes races at Del Mar over the last 
two months before reasserting himself against a quality-laden 
six-horse field Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The last week or so, he's been training great,'' Zolezzi said.  
``And we knew he was feeling better because he started biting 
people. When he gets to nipping like that, we know he's getting 
back to being his old self.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Big Jag, registering his 11th victory in 21 career starts,  
covered the six furlongs in 1:08.87, finishing three-quarters of a 
length in front of Men's Exclusive. Favored Lexicon ran third. 
</P>
<P>
	Dixie Dot Com, racing for the first time since sustaining a  
stress fracture in the left front cannon bone while winning the 
Grade II San Fernando Breeders' Cup, finished a fast-closing 
fourth. 
</P>
<P>
	Big Jag trailed the field for most of the race before rallying  
between horses at the top of the stretch. At midstretch, with Big 
Jag still behind Lexicon and Men's Exclusive, Valdiva swung him 
outside and Big Jag zoomed to the front. 
</P>
<P>
	``This horse has always run better when you get him into the  
clear,'' Valdiva said. ``He was running well in traffic but he just 
wasn't making enough headway. I thought, `Let me give him a clear 
run and see what he's got.' It was do or die. We had to go for it, 
and he just exploded. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was happy for the horse because some people had given up on  
him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trainer Tim Pinfield said Big Jag is being pointed for the $1  
million Breeders' Cup Sprint at Gulfstream on Nov. 6. The horse 
will likely run one more time before then, either in the California 
Sprint Championship on Oct. 2 at Bay Meadows or the Ancient Title 
Handicap on Oct. 17 at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything's going according to plan now,'' said Pinfield,  
adding it took Big Jag longer than expected to get back into racing 
shape after the layoff. ``He wasn't 100 percent for his races at 
Del Mar but he improved with each one. He's rounding into top form 
at the right time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	William Morey Jr., trainer of the comebacking Dixie Dot Com,  
said the horse came out of the race well and still may run in the 
Breeders' Cup, only it probably would be a mile on the turf. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not disappointed with the race,'' he said. ``We were  
happy with the way he finished. He didn't get tired. We wanted to 
make sure he didn't get fatigued because that's when the injury 
could flare up again.''

<HEADLINE> Cubans Allege Pan Am Conspiracy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- The Cuban representative at a  
regional sports convention on Saturday accused officials of the Pan 
American Games and the International Boxing Association of a 
conspiracy against Cuban athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	Ciro Perez Hebra, treasurer of Cuba's Olympic Committee,  
reiterated his government's claim that high jumper Javier 
Sotomayor, who was stripped of his gold medal at last month's Pan 
American Games in Canada when he tested positive for cocaine use, 
was a conspiracy victim. 
</P>
<P>
	Perez Hebra attacked the international sports organizations for  
what he called its ``lies, fraud and victimization of Cuban 
athletes'' while speaking at the Central American Sports 
Organization general assembly. 
</P>
<P>
	He also rejected the Pan American Games committee's charges that  
three Cuban weightlifters who failed drug tests at the Pan American 
Games and said his government had begun a process to clear their 
names. 
</P>
<P>
	He verbally attacked the International Boxing Association for  
its judges ``unjust'' decisions at the world championships in 
Houston last month and referred to ``the mafia that runs it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Cuban government has been calling for an investigation into  
disputed bouts. After one match, the association suspended four 
judges for irregularities after giving a Russian fighter a victory 
over a Cuban. The decision was reversed and the Cuban was given the 
gold medal. 
</P>
<P>
	The vice president of the boxing association, Ricardo Contreras  
of Mexico, sharply told Perez Hebra that his mafia comment was out 
of line and that the assembly meeting was not the proper forum.

<P>
	SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- Crowds waving flags and chanting  
nationalist hymns hailed a group of pardoned prisoners at San Juan 
airport Saturday, as some leaders warned that the controversy 
surrounding their release could hurt the island. 
</P>
<P>
	``These people are not terrorists. They are heroes, and we  
support them 100 percent,'' said Leonore Munoz Gomez, 59, objecting 
to the widespread condemnation in the United States of President 
Clinton's offer of clemency for 16 pro-independence militants. 
</P>
<P>
	Eleven were freed Friday after some 20 years behind bars. Two  
prisoners rejected the offer, one accepted a deal to serve five 
more years and two who had already served out jail sentences were 
forgiven outstanding fines. 
</P>
<P>
	The act invited new criticism of Clinton, jeopardized his wife's  
nascent run for the Senate and underscored the complicated 
relationship between Washington and the island some still call a 
U.S. colony. Critics have said Clinton was being soft on terrorism: 
The prisoners were convicted of sedition and illegal possession of 
weapons in connection with 130 bombings in the 1970s and 1980s that 
killed six people and maimed dozens. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine of those freed have opted to live in Puerto Rico, and seven  
had arrived by Saturday. Two more were expected Sunday. The other 
two chose to return to families in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bienvenidos a casa!'' -- ``Welcome home!'' -- supporters yelled  
at the airport, even though only one of the arrivals was born on 
the island. The others were born in the U.S. mainland, where about 
2 million Puerto Ricans live, compared to nearly 4 million here. 
</P>
<P>
	The ex-prisoners met for several hours in an airport transit  
lounge, exploiting a technicality allowing them to be together 
there without violating parole conditions that forbid them to 
associate with convicted felons, including each other. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, they came out one by one.  
</P>
<P>
	``Viva Puerto Rico!'' the crowd screamed as Ida Luz Rodriguez  
walked out and thanked them ``for all your work and for bringing us 
home.'' When she left, her sister Alicia came forward to announce 
simply: ``Here I am.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A beaming Carmen Valentin told the crowd she felt ``intense  
happiness'' to ``put my feet on this sacred ground.'' Dylcia Pagam, 
the fourth, said she was ``very anxious to integrate myself into my 
community.'' Adolfo Matos said the probation constrictions had 
``converted my cell to invisible bars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They left in separate cars. Plans for a big party were scratched  
because of the parole conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	Last to arrive was Elizam Escobar, a graphic artist from New  
York City, who said they would fight for the release of three 
remaining Puerto Rican prisoners and for independence. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the prisoners accepted the clemency deal as ``the most  
beneficial to the struggle for independence and that, despite the 
onerous conditions imposed on us, we are going to do everything 
possible ... to build a new front for the struggle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hilton Fernandez -- a former member of the Macheteros guerrilla  
group who did prison time for the $7.1 million robbery of a Wells 
Fargo armored truck in Connecticut in 1983 -- said the parole 
conditions were ``for criminals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The released prisoners said they saw themselves differently.  
</P>
<P>
	Edwin Cortes, a Chicago-born nationalist who arrived Friday  
night, had said he hoped ``to follow the examples (of) Nelson 
Mandela, Gerry Adams and Yasser Arafat, who were also labeled as 
criminals and terrorists, but in the minds of their people were 
patriots ... Today, they are considered international statesmen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters at the airport Saturday banged on leather  
``pandereta'' drums, furiously shook maracas and belted out 
nationalist songs in the drizzling rain. They waved the lone-star 
flag of Puerto Rico and pictures of the ex-prisoners. A bright 
yellow banner stood out in the gray morning with a simple 
proclamation: ``Liberty!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jose Vega, 43, brought his 8-year-old daughter, Marena, to meet  
Alicia Rodriguez, whom he had visited in prison after hearing her 
mother speak about her case. ``Aside from all the politics, this is 
an act that helps unite us as a people,'' Vega said of the clemency 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, only a minuscule number of Puerto Ricans support  
independence for the island, which has grown prosperous under 101 
years of U.S. rule. Most favor either the status quo as a 
semiautonomous territory or becoming the 51st U.S. state. 
</P>
<P>
	As a ``U.S. commonwealth,'' Puerto Ricans do not pay federal  
taxes but receive $11 billion annually in federal aid. They are 
U.S. citizens but cannot vote for the U.S. presidents who have 
drafted islanders into the army. Their sole representative in 
Congress doesn't have a vote. 
</P>
<P>
	That representative, Carlos Romero Barcelo, warned Friday that  
the prisoners' release, and their embrace by islanders, could 
further damage Puerto Ricans' image in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, there's an impression in the United States that  
Puerto Ricans support terrorism,'' he told Telemundo television on 
Friday. ``There will be repercussions (in the United States) for 
people who work, people who are looking for employment and the 
Puerto Rican community in general.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another leader warned it could scare away American tourists.  
</P>
<P>
	``We have to remember that these people belonged to groups that  
have promoted their ideal through violence,'' said Jorge Davila, a 
former chief of the government's tourism agency who is now 
secretary-general of the pro-statehood New Progressive Party. 
</P>
<P>
	But many see the prisoners are symbols of a much-cherished  
nationhood. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very happy for these guys,'' said janitor Hector Rivera,  
watching the chaotic airport proceedings apart from the crowd. 
``They are a symbol of Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
	``For me, they are like family.''

U.S. colony. Critics have said Clinton was being soft on terrorism: 
The prisoners were convicted of sedition and illegal possession of 
weapons in connection with 130 bombings in the 1970s and 1980s that 
killed six people and maimed dozens. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine of those freed have opted to live in Puerto Rico, and seven  
had arrived by Saturday. Two more were expected Sunday. The other 
two chose to return to families in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bienvenidos a casa!'' -- ``Welcome home!'' -- supporters yelled  
at the airport, even though only one of the arrivals was born on 
the island. The others were born in the U.S. mainland, where about 
2 million Puerto Ricans live, compared to nearly 4 million here. 
</P>
<P>
	The ex-prisoners met for several hours in an airport transit  
lounge, exploiting a technicality allowing them to be together 
there without violating parole conditions that forbid them to 
associate with convicted felons, including each other. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, they came out one by one.  
</P>
<P>
	``Viva Puerto Rico!'' the crowd screamed as Ida Luz Rodriguez  
walked out and thanked them ``for all your work and for bringing us 
home.'' When she left, her sister Alicia came forward to announce 
simply: ``Here I am.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A beaming Carmen Valentin told the crowd she felt ``intense  
happiness'' to ``put my feet on this sacred ground.'' Dylcia Pagam, 
the fourth, said she was ``very anxious to integrate myself into my 
community.'' Adolfo Matos said the probation constrictions had 
``converted my cell to invisible bars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They left in separate cars. Plans for a big party were scratched  
because of the parole conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	Last to arrive was Elizam Escobar, a graphic artist from New  
York City, who said they would fight for the release of three 
remaining Puerto Rican prisoners and for independence. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the prisoners accepted the clemency deal as ``the most  
beneficial to the struggle for independence and that, despite the 
onerous conditions imposed on us, we are going to do everything 
possible ... to build a new front for the struggle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hilton Fernandez -- a former member of the Macheteros guerrilla  
group who did prison time for the $7.1 million robbery of a Wells 
Fargo armored truck in Connecticut in 1983 -- said the parole 
conditions were ``for criminals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The released prisoners said they saw themselves differently.  
</P>
<P>
	Edwin Cortes, a Chicago-born nationalist who arrived Friday  
night, had said he hoped ``to follow the examples (of) Nelson 
Mandela, Gerry Adams and Yasser Arafat, who were also labeled as 
criminals and terrorists, but in the minds of their people were 
patriots ... Today, they are considered international statesmen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters at the airport Saturday banged on leather  
``pandereta'' drums, furiously shook maracas and belted out 
nationalist songs in the drizzling rain. They waved the lone-star 
flag of Puerto Rico and pictures of the ex-prisoners. A bright 
yellow banner stood out in the gray morning with a simple 
proclamation: ``Liberty!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jose Vega, 43, brought his 8-year-old daughter, Marena, to meet  
Alicia Rodriguez, whom he had visited in prison after hearing her 
mother speak about her case. ``Aside from all the politics, this is 
an act that helps unite us as a people,'' Vega said of the clemency 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, only a minuscule number of Puerto Ricans support  
independence for the island, which has grown prosperous under 101 
years of U.S. rule. Most favor either the status quo as a 
semiautonomous territory or becoming the 51st U.S. state. 
</P>
<P>
	As a ``U.S. commonwealth,'' Puerto Ricans do not pay federal  
taxes but receive $11 billion annually in federal aid. They are 
U.S. citizens but cannot vote for the U.S. presidents who have 
drafted islanders into the army. Their sole representative in 
Congress doesn't have a vote. 
</P>
<P>
	That representative, Carlos Romero Barcelo, warned Friday that  
the prisoners' release, and their embrace by islanders, could 
further damage Puerto Ricans' image in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, there's an impression in the United States that  
Puerto Ricans support terrorism,'' he told Telemundo television on 
Friday. ``There will be repercussions (in the United States) for 
people who work, people who are looking for employment and the 
Puerto Rican community in general.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another leader warned it could scare away American tourists.  
</P>
<P>
	``We have to remember that these people belonged to groups that  
have promoted their ideal through violence,'' said Jorge Davila, a 
former chief of the government's tourism agency who is now 
secretary-general of the pro-statehood New Progressive Party. 
</P>
<P>
	But many see the prisoners are symbols of a much-cherished  
nationhood. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very happy for these guys,'' said janitor Hector Rivera,  
watching the chaotic airport proceedings apart from the crowd. 
``They are a symbol of Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
	``For me, they are like family.''

<HEADLINE> NYC Battles Encephalitis Outbreak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Workers on foot began spraying pesticide  
Saturday in Manhattan in the city's war on mosquito-borne 
encephalitis that has killed three people. 
</P>
<P>
	Six other cases of the potentially deadly virus since Sept. 2  
have been confirmed and 89 cases are suspected. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Rudolph Giuliani urged people not to be alarmed by the  
increased aerial and ground spraying, expected to continue at least 
through Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a lot of misconceptions and people are frightened  
more than they should be,'' he said. ``This is an infinitesimally 
small amount of people who are affected or will be affected.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eight of the confirmed infections were in Queens and one in  
Brooklyn. All three people who died were at least 58 years old. 
</P>
<P>
	Symptoms of St. Louis encephalitis range from a low fever and  
headaches to a high fever, stiff neck, disorientation and tremors. 
Because it is a virus, there is no vaccine available to prevent it, 
but the symptoms can be treated. 
</P>
<P>
	City Health Commissioner Neal Cohen says residents should stay  
indoors for two or three hours after their neighborhoods are 
sprayed. The pesticide used, malathion, is one of the least toxic 
pesticides that effectively kills adult mosquitoes, but it can 
cause eye irritation, rashes and respiratory problems. 
</P>
<P>
	The city has set up a Web site and telephone hotline for  
residents to check on spraying schedules. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents also have been advised to wear insect repellent when  
going outside.

<HEADLINE> Abalone Poaching Ring Smashed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBION, Calif. (AP) -- State game wardens, capping a six-month  
undercover probe of abalone poaching, arrested 16 people and seized 
$10,000 in cash in dawn raids along the foggy Mendocino coast and 
in the San Francisco area. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators said Friday the arrests targeted a poaching ring  
that sold abalone on the black market for $60 each, or more. 
</P>
<P>
	Two divers, their pouches stuffed with abalone taken just  
minutes before, were arrested after they changed from their wet 
suits and were returning to a car parked in a field along the sheer 
cliffs overlooking Dark Gulch inlet, just south of the scenic 
Heritage House complex. 
</P>
<P>
	They were accused of conspiracy and possession, and each faces  
up to five years in prison and $40,000 in fines. 
</P>
<P>
	The raids by Fish and Game Department agents followed months of  
round-the-clock surveillance on the suspects' homes in San 
Francisco and Oakland and along isolated coastal nooks. The 
investigation was prompted by an anonymous tip to a state hotline. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators say the poached abalone was sold to individuals,  
restaurants and wholesale fish dealers in the San Francisco Bay 
area. The shellfish, a delight to seafood fanciers, sold for about 
$40 apiece to illicit wholesalers and up to $60 apiece or more on 
the street. 
</P>
<P>
	To protect California's dwindling abalone population, especially  
along the craggy, majestic North Coast where the valued ``reds'' 
are found, the state has banned commercial abalone fishing. The 
last open commercial zone was closed two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	It's legal to dive for abalone from April through June and  
August through November, but the limit is four per day.

<P>
	SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- Crowds waving flags and chanting  
nationalist hymns hailed a group of pardoned prisoners at San Juan 
airport Saturday, as some leaders warned that the controversy 
surrounding their release could hurt the island. 
</P>
<P>
	``These people are not terrorists. They are heroes, and we  
support them 100 percent,'' said Leonore Munoz Gomez, 59, objecting 
to the widespread condemnation in the United States of President 
Clinton's offer of clemency for 16 pro-independence militants. 
</P>
<P>
	Eleven were freed Friday after some 20 years behind bars. Two  
prisoners rejected the offer, one accepted a deal to serve five 
more years and two who had already served out jail sentences were 
forgiven outstanding fines. 
</P>
<P>
	The act invited new criticism of Clinton, jeopardized his wife's  
nascent run for the Senate and underscored the complicated

<HEADLINE>  Greece Quake Death Toll at 106 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- Signs of exhaustion were everywhere four  
days after a deadly earthquake north of Athens forced tens of 
thousands of people from their wrecked homes. 
</P>
<P>
	As the death toll from the magnitude 5.9 quake reached 106 on  
Saturday, relatives of 26 people believed still buried in rubble 
stood silently among reporters and cameramen as tireless rescue 
workers from Greece and six other countries tunneled into collapsed 
buildings hoping for a miracle. 
</P>
<P>
	``We still hope everyone is alive,'' said Fire Chief Nikos  
Kotsioris, who said rescue work had ended at all but four sites. 
``It is a very difficult operation. The weight of the rubble is 
great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cranes were used to lift slabs of concrete off a collapsed  
five-story household products factory in the remote chance that 
anyone trapped in the levels below had survived. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 50,000 people have been forced outdoors in the blue  
collar neighborhoods and towns of Menidi, Metamorfosi, Nea 
Philadelphia and Ano Liosia, where the mayor's home was destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said enough tent space was now available at  
settlements to accommodate the homeless. But many victims 
determined to stay near their damaged homes and belongings were 
still scrambling for basic provisions. 
</P>
<P>
	About 8,000 policemen and 3,000 soldiers are patrolling streets  
with evacuated buildings to stamp out looting and a fast-emerging 
black market, providing everything from tents to mobile phones. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of aftershocks and frequent rainfall have added to the  
prevailing scene of fear and misery. At a damaged building in 
central Athens, two religious icons sit on a ledge split open by a 
giant crack. 
</P>
<P>
	Crews of engineers chiseled plaster off walls to check if cracks  
endangered concrete supports. They have marked more than 2,000 
buildings for demolition, including homes, schools and even a 
soccer stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Government officials said all damaged homes would be inspected  
by Monday. Banks remained open Saturday to hand out emergency 
government grants for $660. 
</P>
<P>
	As rescue operations were scaled back, fresh damage caused by  
the quake was discovered. Defense official said a large army 
communications base north of Athens faced demolition after 
suffering extensive damage. 
</P>
<P>
	And at least ten patients who fled a psychiatric hospital in  
Athens after the quake are still missing. Five buildings at the 
hospital complex were seriously damaged and about 300 patients had 
to be moved to other facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	News reports said nearly 100 civil engineers, building  
contractors and low-ranking town planning officials were under 
investigation as part of a criminal probe into deaths caused by 
alleged substandard structures flattened by the quake. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will be penalties,'' Premier Costas Simitis said Friday,  
repeating promises of swift justice. 
</P>
<P>
	But legal experts cautioned that the investigation could be time  
consuming and that punishment would only affect people who erected 
buildings after 1995, when tougher construction laws were 
introduced.

	An estimated 50,000 people have been forced outdoors in the blue  
collar neighborhoods and towns of Menidi, Metamorfosi, Nea 
Philadelphia and Ano Liosia, where the mayor's home was destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said enough tent space was now available at  
settlements to accommodate the homeless. But many victims 
determined to stay near their damaged homes and belongings were 
still scrambling for basic provisions. 
</P>
<P>
	About 8,000 policemen and 3,000 soldiers are patrolling streets  
with evacuated buildings to stamp out looting and a fast-emerging 
black market, providing everything from tents to mobile phones. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of aftershocks and frequent rainfall have added to the  
prevailing scene of fear and misery. At a damaged building in 
central Athens, two religious icons sit on a ledge split open by a 
giant crack. 
</P>
<P>
	Crews of engineers chiseled plaster off walls to check if cracks  
endangered concrete supports. They have marked more than 2,000 
buildings for demolition, including homes, schools and even a 
soccer stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Government officials said all damaged homes would be inspected  
by Monday. Banks remained open Saturday to hand out emergency 
government grants for $660. 
</P>
<P>
	As rescue operations were scaled back, fresh damage caused by  
the quake was discovered. Defense official said a large army 
communications base north of Athens faced demolition after 
suffering extensive damage. 
</P>
<P>
	And at least ten patients who fled a psychiatric hospital in  
Athens after the quake are still missing. Five buildings at the 
hospital complex were seriously damaged and about 300 patients had 
to be moved to other facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	News reports said nearly 100 civil engineers, building  
contractors and low-ranking town planning officials were under 
investigation as part of a criminal probe into deaths caused by 
alleged substandard structures flattened by the quake. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will be penalties,'' Premier Costas Simitis said Friday,  
repeating promises of swift justice. 
</P>
<P>
	But legal experts cautioned that the investigation could be time  
consuming and that punishment would only affect people who erected 
buildings after 1995, when tougher construction laws were 
introduced.

<HEADLINE> Second E. coli Outbreak Sickens 140 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PETERSBURG, Ill. (AP) -- More than 140 people were sickened with  
a potentially deadly strain of E. coli after partying in a cow 
pasture last weekend, and state health officials were scrambling to 
reach more than 1,800 others who were there. 
</P>
<P>
	It is the second major E. coli outbreak in two weeks.  
</P>
<P>
	In New York state, two people have died and more than 600 others  
who attended a county fair have E. coli symptoms. New York health 
officials estimate as many as 1,000 people may have been infected, 
which would make it the worst E. coli outbreak in U.S. history. 
</P>
<P>
	The worst outbreak was in 1993 when 700 patrons of Jack in the  
Box restaurants in Washington state were sickened by E. coil 
bacteria linked to undercooked hamburger and four died. 
</P>
<P>
	No deaths have been linked to the central Illinois outbreak, but  
Health Department spokesman Tom Schafer said Saturday that 18 
people had been hospitalized, 127 had reported E. coli symptoms and 
those numbers were expected to rise. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sept. 4 party was a free gathering for family and friends of  
members of eight bands who rarely get to hear them play, said Tom 
Baird, who has held ``Cornstock'' in his pasture for the past four 
years. He said he doesn't plan to hold it again. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are kids, grandmas, aunts and uncles ... it's a family  
thing,'' he said. The guests came from across Illinois, Florida, 
Hawaii, Kentucky, Michigan, Missouri and Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	Baird said he donated a steer for the party, but it was prepared  
off-site, and he said he cleaned the pasture of manure before the 
party. 
</P>
<P>
	The E. coli strain, found in the feces and intestines of cattle,  
is the same strain blamed for the outbreak at the Washington County 
fairgrounds in New York, Illinois health officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The fairgrounds, in Greenwich, N.Y., are shut down and events  
canceled while researchers poked through cow manure and take water 
samples to pinpoint the origin of the 0157:H7 E. coli outbreak. 
</P>
<P>
	Late last week, they said tests had confirmed the presence of E.  
coli in an unchlorinated well not far from cow barns on the 
fairgrounds. But the water was tested several days after the fair 
ended, and while it is from the same well, it is not the same water 
people drank at the fair. 
</P>
<P>
	Complicating matters, health officials said they confirmed more  
than two dozen cases of campylobaceteriosis among the fairgoers. 
Its symptoms and means of transmission mirror those of E. coli. 
</P>
<P>
	The first E. coli victim, 3-year-old Rachel Aldrich of Malta,  
N.Y., was buried Friday. The second, 79-year-old Ernest L. Wester 
of Gansevoort, N.Y., died the same day. Wester's granddaughter, 
Brandy Wester, said he initially thought he had the flu. 
</P>
<P>
	The typical incubation period for the illness is three to eight  
days, but can be longer. Symptoms include bloody diarrhea and 
severe abdominal cramps.

<HEADLINE> Pardoned Militants Return As Heroes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- Crowds waving flags and chanting  
nationalist hymns hailed a group of pardoned prisoners at San Juan 
airport Saturday, as some leaders warned that the controversy 
surrounding their release could hurt the island. 
</P>
<P>
	``These people are not terrorists. They are heroes, and we  
support them 100 percent,'' said Leonore Munoz Gomez, 59, objecting 
to the widespread condemnation in the United States of President 
Clinton's offer of clemency for 16 pro-independence militants. 
</P>
<P>
	Eleven were freed Friday after some 20 years behind bars. Two  
prisoners rejected the offer, one accepted a deal to serve five 
more years and two who had already served out jail sentences were 
forgiven outstanding fines. 
</P>
<P>
	The act invited new criticism of Clinton, jeopardized his wife's  
nascent run for the Senate and underscored the complicated 
relationship between Washington and the island some still call a 
U.S. colony. Critics have said Clinton was being soft on terrorism: 
The prisoners were convicted of sedition and illegal possession of 
weapons in connection with 130 bombings in the 1970s and 1980s that 
killed six people and maimed dozens. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine of those freed have opted to live in Puerto Rico, and seven  
had arrived by Saturday. Two more were expected Sunday. The other 
two chose to return to families in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bienvenidos a casa!'' -- ``Welcome home!'' -- supporters yelled  
at the airport, even though only one of the arrivals was born on 
the island. The others were born in the U.S. mainland, where about 
2 million Puerto Ricans live, compared to nearly 4 million here. 
</P>
<P>
	The ex-prisoners met for several hours in an airport transit  
lounge, exploiting a technicality allowing them to be together 
there without violating parole conditions that forbid them to 
associate with convicted felons, including each other. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, they came out one by one.  
</P>
<P>
	``Viva Puerto Rico!'' the crowd screamed as Ida Luz Rodriguez  
walked out and thanked them ``for all your work and for bringing us 
home.'' When she left, her sister Alicia came forward to announce 
simply: ``Here I am.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A beaming Carmen Valentin told the crowd she felt ``intense  
happiness'' to ``put my feet on this sacred ground.'' Dylcia Pagam, 
the fourth, said she was ``very anxious to integrate myself into my 
community.'' Adolfo Matos said the probation constrictions had 
``converted my cell to invisible bars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They left in separate cars. Plans for a big party were scratched  
because of the parole conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	Last to arrive was Elizam Escobar, a graphic artist from New  
York City, who said they would fight for the release of three 
remaining Puerto Rican prisoners and for independence. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the prisoners accepted the clemency deal as ``the most  
beneficial to the struggle for independence and that, despite the 
onerous conditions imposed on us, we are going to do everything 
possible ... to build a new front for the struggle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hilton Fernandez -- a former member of the Macheteros guerrilla  
group who did prison time for the $7.1 million robbery of a Wells 
Fargo armored truck in Connecticut in 1983 -- said the parole 
conditions were ``for criminals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The released prisoners said they saw themselves differently.  
</P>
<P>
	Edwin Cortes, a Chicago-born nationalist who arrived Friday  
night, had said he hoped ``to follow the examples (of) Nelson 
Mandela, Gerry Adams and Yasser Arafat, who were also labeled as 
criminals and terrorists, but in the minds of their people were 
patriots ... Today, they are considered international statesmen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters at the airport Saturday banged on leather  
``pandereta'' drums, furiously shook maracas and belted out 
nationalist songs in the drizzling rain. They waved the lone-star 
flag of Puerto Rico and pictures of the ex-prisoners. A bright 
yellow banner stood out in the gray morning with a simple 
proclamation: ``Liberty!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jose Vega, 43, brought his 8-year-old daughter, Marena, to meet  
Alicia Rodriguez, whom he had visited in prison after hearing her 
mother speak about her case. ``Aside from all the politics, this is 
an act that helps unite us as a people,'' Vega said of the clemency 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, only a minuscule number of Puerto Ricans support  
independence for the island, which has grown prosperous under 101 
years of U.S. rule. Most favor either the status quo as a 
semiautonomous territory or becoming the 51st U.S. state. 
</P>
<P>
	As a ``U.S. commonwealth,'' Puerto Ricans do not pay federal  
taxes but receive $11 billion annually in federal aid. They are 
U.S. citizens but cannot vote for the U.S. presidents who have 
drafted islanders into the army. Their sole representative in 
Congress doesn't have a vote. 
</P>
<P>
	That representative, Carlos Romero Barcelo, warned Friday that  
the prisoners' release, and their embrace by islanders, could 
further damage Puerto Ricans' image in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, there's an impression in the United States that  
Puerto Ricans support terrorism,'' he told Telemundo television on 
Friday. ``There will be repercussions (in the United States) for 
people who work, people who are looking for employment and the 
Puerto Rican community in general.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another leader warned it could scare away American tourists.  
</P>
<P>
	``We have to remember that these people belonged to groups that  
have promoted their ideal through violence,'' said Jorge Davila, a 
former chief of the government's tourism agency who is now 
secretary-general of the pro-statehood New Progressive Party. 
</P>
<P>
	But many see the prisoners are symbols of a much-cherished  
nationhood. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very happy for these guys,'' said janitor Hector Rivera,  
watching the chaotic airport proceedings apart from the crowd. 
``They are a symbol of Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
	``For me, they are like family.''

<HEADLINE> Microphone Used in Missing Baby Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Investigators used a high-powered microphone  
to listen in on the conversations of a couple indicted in the 
disappearance of their 5-month-old daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	Hillsborough Circuit Chief Judge F. Dennis Alvarez gave State  
Attorney Harry Lee Coe III permission to use the device at the home 
of Marlene and Steven Aisenberg, starting on Dec. 12, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge allowed the eavesdropping microphone to remain in  
place for 90 days, according to court records. The alleged 
conversations are included in a federal indictment issued Thursday 
against Marlene and Steven Aisenberg. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Aisenberg allegedly blamed husband Steven for killing baby  
Sabrina. She's quoted as saying: ``The baby's dead and buried! It 
was found dead because you did it,'' according to the indictment. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities have not recovered the baby's body but fear she is  
dead and accuse the Aisenbergs of faking her kidnapping on Nov. 24, 
1997, to cover up the slaying. 
</P>
<P>
	The Aisenbergs have not been charged with murder or kidnapping  
but allegedly talked about what to tell authorities and faking a 
kidnapping, according to the indictment. 
</P>
<P>
	The Aisenbergs' told authorities Sabrina vanished from her crib  
as they slept. 
</P>
<P>
	Aisenberg was heard telling his wife: ``I wish I hadn't harmed  
her. It was the cocaine,'' prosecutor Rachelle Des Vaux Bedke said. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple's attorney, Barry Cohen, said Aisenberg is not a drug  
user. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen said he plans to file a request for any affidavits  
reviewed by Alvarez before the judge authorized the secret 
recordings. 
</P>
<P>
	The Aisenbergs now live in Bethesda, Md. They posted $25,000  
bail each Friday.

<HEADLINE>  Venice Honors 'King of Comedy' Film </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VENICE, Italy (AP) -- Silly, according to Jerry Lewis, is  
something that can be understood in any language. In a testament to 
this belief and to the man who personifies it, the Venice Film 
Festival on Saturday honored Lewis with a Golden Lion lifetime 
achievement award. 
</P>
<P>
	The 73-year-old Lewis, still recovering from a bout with viral  
meningitis, was recognized both as a comedian and as a filmmaker 
who has directed 11 movies, all but one starring himself. 
</P>
<P>
	European audiences and critics have long regarded Lewis as one  
of the great comic innovators and feel he is undervalued in the 
United States, where his main claim to fame now is the annual Labor 
Day telethon which has raised hundreds of millions of dollars to 
fight muscular dystrophy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jerry Lewis introduced original and explosive surreal elements  
acting as a critical comment on contemporary American society,'' 
festival director Alberto Barbera said when the award was 
announced. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis may also be undervalued as a savvy businessman.  
</P>
<P>
	In 1958, he negotiated a deal for the sales and distribution  
rights to six of films to revert to him in 30 years. Lewis has 
begun to cash in, selling the rights for remakes and getting a cut 
of the profits in the process. The remake of ``The Nutty 
Professor'' has raked in more than $270 million worldwide since its 
1996 release, according to Premiere Magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	He began directing his own films after the breakup of his  
immensely successful, 10-year partnership with the whiskey-voiced 
crooner Dean Martin, a smooth foil to Lewis' frantic, antic clown. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis, who is Jewish, made one film which was never released and  
which he refuses to discuss: ``The Day the Clown Cried.'' It is the 
tale of a clown that leads children into the gas chamber at 
Auschwitz. An Italian film, Roberto Benigni's ``Life is 
Beautiful,'' echoes the idea and was a huge success last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis praised Benigni lavishly at his news conference, calling  
him ``extraordinary and one of the best to come around for many 
years,'' but he rebuffed questions about ``The Day the Clown 
Cried.'' Lewis abandoned the project in 1972 and didn't appear in 
another movie until Martin Scorsese's dark drama ``King of Comedy'' 
in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	In tribute to Lewis, his 1960 movie, ``The Bellboy,'' was  
screened on the closing day of the festival. Lewis chose it for 
Venice because it was the first film he directed. He also wrote the 
screenplay and produced the movie.

<HEADLINE>  E.Timor Talk Dominates Trade Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) -- Nobel laureate Jose Ramos Horta  
appealed Saturday for urgent action to prevent mass slaughter and 
starvation in his homeland of East Timor. 
</P>
<P>
	Tens of thousands more East Timorese could die unless a  
peacekeeping force and humanitarian aid are sent to the region, 
said Horta, in Auckland, New Zealand, where the annual meeting of 
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum is being held. 
</P>
<P>
	``World leaders, wherever they are, cannot pretend to be locked  
up in the hotels, discussing only trade statistics when the houses 
around them are burning down,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Sunday, President Clinton told reporters the United States  
might provide support services to a U.N. peacekeeping team -- and 
that could involve U.S. personnel. 
</P>
<P>
	He also announced Saturday that the U.S. would halt military  
sales to Indonesia to pressure the Southeast Asian country to allow 
international peacekeeping troops into its troubled territory. 
</P>
<P>
	White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said Clinton's order  
could affect military deals involving hundreds of millions of 
dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	Dili, the provincial capital, has been ravaged by fire, and  
militiamen have reportedly killed hundreds since East Timorese 
voted in favor of independence from Indonesia in a U.N.-sponsored 
referendum on Aug. 30. Some 200,000 East Timorese have fled their 
homes in the last week, aid agencies have estimated. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesia has refused to accept U.N. peacekeepers to help quell  
violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramos Horta, 50, who shared the 1996 Nobel Peace Prize with East  
Timor's spiritual leader, Bishop Carlos Belo, said his sources in 
East Timor estimated that at least 1,000 people have been killed 
just in the last week. 
</P>
<P>
	He cheered on about 500 demonstrators who marched to the APEC  
media center calling for East Timor's independence. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday night, he called for a tourism boycott of the  
Indonesian resort island of Bali, which he said helps fund the 
militiamen terrorizing East Timor. And on Sunday, he again called 
for a war crimes tribunal to punish those guilty of genocide in 
East Timor. 
</P>
<P>
	``The situation is at such a point where you have women  
committing suicide because they know they will be raped in front of 
their husbands and children,'' he told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramos Horta said he would meet with Clinton on Monday to seek  
his support. He had already met in Auckland with New Zealand Prime 
Minister Jenny Shipley and Australian Foreign Minister Alexander 
Downer. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton led a speech to business leaders on Sunday by again  
pressuring Indonesia to invite U.N. peacekeepers into East Timor. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Indonesian government and military must not only stop what  
they are doing but reverse course,'' Clinton said. ``They must halt 
the violence not just in Dili but throughout the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	``They must permit humanitarian assistance and let the U.N.  
mission do its job. They must allow the East Timorese who have been 
pushed from their homes to return safely. They must implement the 
results of the balloting. And they must allow an international 
force to help restore security,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Australian Prime Minister John Howard said Saturday that  
Australia, New Zealand, Britain, Portugal, Malaysia and the 
Philippines had offered to provide peacekeepers to an international 
force. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said the United States would be willing to provide  
``some of the things that only we can provide,'' including 
``logistical support'' such as intelligence and communications. 
Providing some of these services might include the limited use of 
U.S. personnel, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Howard had said Canada was ready to commit peacekeeping troops,  
but Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien said the country had not 
yet decided how it would help the effort in Timor. 
</P>
<P>
	But no nation appeared ready to join a peacekeeping force  
without an invitation from Jakarta. 
</P>
<P>
	``You really have to wait for an Indonesian request,'' said  
Philippine Foreign Secretary Domingo Siazon. ``Unless you're 
prepared to get into a major war with the Indonesian army, you 
don't invade East Timor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, Indonesia's U.N. ambassador, Makarim Wibisono, ruled  
out any international force for East Timor, saying on Saturday 
night that Indonesia's imposition of martial law was improving 
security in the territory.

	Dili, the provincial capital, has been ravaged by fire, and  
militiamen have reportedly killed hundreds since East Timorese 
voted in favor of independence from Indonesia in a U.N.-sponsored 
referendum on Aug. 30. Some 200,000 East Timorese have fled their 
homes in the last week, aid agencies have estimated. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesia has refused to accept U.N. peacekeepers to help quell  
violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramos Horta, 50, who shared the 1996 Nobel Peace Prize with East  
Timor's spiritual leader, Bishop Carlos Belo, said his sources in 
East Timor estimated that at least 1,000 people have been killed 
just in the last week. 
</P>
<P>
	He cheered on about 500 demonstrators who marched to the APEC  
media center calling for East Timor's independence. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday night, he called for a tourism boycott of the  
Indonesian resort island of Bali, which he said helps fund the 
militiamen terrorizing East Timor. And on Sunday, he again called 
for a war crimes tribunal to punish those guilty of genocide in 
East Timor. 
</P>
<P>
	``The situation is at such a point where you have women  
committing suicide because they know they will be raped in front of 
their husbands and children,'' he told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramos Horta said he would meet with Clinton on Monday to seek  
his support. He had already met in Auckland with New Zealand Prime 
Minister Jenny Shipley and Australian Foreign Minister Alexander 
Downer. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton led a speech to business leaders on Sunday by again  
pressuring Indonesia to invite U.N. peacekeepers into East Timor. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Indonesian government and military must not only stop what  
they are doing but reverse course,'' Clinton said. ``They must halt 
the violence not just in Dili but throughout the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	``They must permit humanitarian assistance and let the U.N.  
mission do its job. They must allow the East Timorese who have been 
pushed from their homes to return safely. They must implement the 
results of the balloting. And they must allow an international 
force to help restore security,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Australian Prime Minister John Howard said Saturday that  
Australia, New Zealand, Britain, Portugal, Malaysia and the 
Philippines had offered to provide peacekeepers to an international 
force. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said the United States would be willing to provide  
``some of the things that only we can provide,'' including 
``logistical support'' such as intelligence and communications. 
Providing some of these services might include the limited use of 
U.S. personnel, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Howard had said Canada was ready to commit peacekeeping troops,  
but Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien said the country had not 
yet decided how it would help the effort in Timor. 
</P>
<P>
	But no nation appeared ready to join a peacekeeping force  
without an invitation from Jakarta. 
</P>
<P>
	``You really have to wait for an Indonesian request,'' said  
Philippine Foreign Secretary Domingo Siazon. ``Unless you're 
prepared to get into a major war with the Indonesian army, you 
don't invade East Timor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, Indonesia's U.N. ambassador, Makarim Wibisono, ruled  
out any international force for East Timor, saying on Saturday 
night that Indonesia's imposition of martial law was improving 
security in the territory.

<HEADLINE> Air Force Backs New Jet Fighter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Inside a Boeing Co. laboratory chock-full of  
computer terminals and projection screens, teams of technicians are 
``flying'' the F-22, a next-generation warplane whose future is 
clouded by a fierce debate over whether America needs the most 
expensive fighter jet ever built. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boeing lab, with a fully fitted F-22 cockpit sitting front  
and center, is working out the bugs in nearly 2 million lines of 
computer code. They give the airplane, nicknamed Raptor, a 
sophisticated electronic ``brain'' that distinguishes it from every 
fighter now in the sky or on the drawing board. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a dramatic step forward'' for U.S. air power, says Bob  
Barnes, Boeing's top overseer of the project. 
</P>
<P>
	Some on Capitol Hill are less enthusiastic: The House this  
summer voted to withhold $1.8 billion that had been earmarked to 
begin Raptor production, surprising the Air Force and F-22 
contractors led by Lockheed Martin Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	The fate of the $63 billion project may be decided in  
House-Senate negotiations starting this month on whether to release 
the $1.8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Skeptics ask: What is so special about the F-22 that the Air  
Force cannot live without it, especially because the plane it would 
replace, the F-15 Eagle, already is acknowledged as the best 
fighter in the world? 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Force gives a two-part answer: the aviation electronics,  
or avionics, that Boeing is developing, and the Raptor's 
radar-evading stealth and unique ability to ``cruise'' at 
supersonic speeds without using afterburners. Combined, they give 
Raptor pilots an edge in ``situational awareness'' -- seeing the 
``big picture'' in the air battle better than the enemy does. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, critics want to know why the Air Force needs this extra  
advantage, and whether the country can afford it, given the money 
pinch that is limiting modernization in other areas of the 
military. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to rethink our ideas on what our requirements are in a  
changed world. Who are our enemies?'' says Rep. Jerry Lewis, 
R-Calif. He is leading the charge in the House to force a ``pause'' 
in the F-22 program. The Air Force says such a delay effectively 
would kill the program. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis, who visited Boeing to see its avionics work during  
Congress' August recess, says he is impressed at the technology. 
But he believes the Air Force is sinking too much into the F-22 at 
the expense of other less glamorous requirements such as buying 
more aerial refuelers and designing a new bomber. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Force says the F-22 is prudent insurance against  
potential new air threats in the 21st century. The Air Force's 
argument is that while the F-15 is the best in the world today, it 
is beginning to lose its edge to new European and Russian fighters 
that one day could be exported in large numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Force wants to build 339 F-22s to replace the F-15 in a  
combat role the Air Force calls ``air superiority.'' That means the 
plane is supposed to defeat an enemy's air defenses -- in the air 
and on the ground -- in order to shield more vulnerable 
ground-attack planes like bombers and other fighters, and slow 
movers like AWACS radar warning planes, aerial refuelers and 
surveillance planes. 
</P>
<P>
	The F-22's avionics are designed to allow a pilot to identify,  
target and kill enemy aircraft well beyond visual range. Flying 
alone, the pilot can pull together navigational, surveillance, 
targeting and other vital information in an easy-to-use format that 
frees him to concentrate more fully on the air battle. 
</P>
<P>
	The avionics technologies are blamed by some, however, for early  
delays and cost increases. 
</P>
<P>
	The General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of  
Congress, said in a report in March that the schedule for 
completing development of Boeing's cockpit electronics appeared 
overly ambitious. The GAO also questioned the wisdom of allowing 
the Air Force to start F-22 production before even one of the test 
aircraft has flown equipped with the Boeing-made avionics. 
</P>
<P>
	The avionics flight testing is scheduled to start next summer,  
and the final version of the avionics is not expected to be ready 
until September 2003 -- barely two years before the first F-22s are 
to enter the Air Force. 
</P>
<P>
	The flight tests so far have been geared toward verifying the  
plane's aerodynamics, speed and maneuverability. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing says it is confident the avionics will work as  
advertised, although it acknowledges feeling pressure to deliver on 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	``The hill we have to climb on that is a difficult one, but I  
believe we can do it,'' says Barnes. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing also fell behind in early manufacturing of the F-22's  
wings but says it is now back on course. Boeing makes the rear 
section of fuselage that holds the engines made by Pratt &AMP; Whitney. 
Lead contractor Lockheed Martin makes the rest of the fuselage, the 
stabilizers, the radar and the communications and navigation 
system. Final assembly is at Lockheed's Marietta, Ga., plant. 
</P>
<P>
	Technical issues aside, what troubles the F-22's skeptics most  
is that this is not even the most expensive fighter program in the 
Pentagon's budget; there are three new fighters in various stages 
of development. If all three types are built in the numbers now 
planned the bill is likely to exceed $330 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't afford them all,'' Lewis said in an interview.  
</P>
<P>
	Besides the F-22, the Pentagon has its Joint Strike Fighter  
program, which would build about 3,000 fighters at a projected cost 
of $220 billion for the Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps, plus 
Britain's Navy and Air Force. 
</P>
<P>
	The third fighter program under way is the Navy's F/A-18E Super  
Hornet, which is a new version of the existing F/A-18 strike 
aircraft made by Boeing. The Navy intends to buy about 548 of the 
new planes for $46 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Air Force's battle to save the F-22 it asserts that only  
this aircraft can assure U.S. dominance of the air in the decades 
ahead. And yet the Navy, in extolling the value of its new Super 
Hornet, says it can ``totally dominate'' any fighter in world today 
or projected to exist in the next 20 years.

<HEADLINE> HIV Cases in Russia Soar 70 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- The number of HIV-positive cases registered in  
Russia jumped by 70 percent in the first eight months of 1999 as 
the disease spread rapidly among drug addicts, a news report said 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Health Minister Yuri Shevchenko said the majority of new HIV  
cases were registered among Moscow drug users, according to the 
Interfax news agency. 
</P>
<P>
	``Residents of Moscow and the Moscow region account for the  
unprecedented growth in HIV infection,'' he said. ``HIV hit the 
circle of the capital's drug users and the infection skyrocketed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although he said cases were up 70 percent, Shevchenko did not  
give any figures for how many people in Russia have HIV, the virus 
that causes AIDS. But the Health Ministry said in early July that 
the country had 15,819 HIV cases. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian officials warn that the actual number of HIV cases may  
be up to 10 times higher than reported. The country has been slow 
to implement comprehensive diagnostic and treatment programs and is 
focusing on more immediate economic problems.

<HEADLINE> Boston's Gordon Pitches One Inning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NORWICH, Conn. (AP) -- Boston Red Sox relief ace Tom Gordon  
pitched one scoreless inning for the Double-A Trenton Thunder on 
Saturday in his first rehab outing since going on the disabled list 
in June. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon, trying to come back from a strained right elbow, started  
the Thunder's playoff game against New York Yankees' affiliate, the 
Norwich Navigators. 
</P>
<P>
	He was scheduled to leave after 20 pitches. He threw 15, six of  
them for strikes. Gordon gave up one hit, walked one and struck out 
one. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon went on the 60-day disabled list June 12 and had only  
thrown batting practice before Saturday's game, which Trenton lost 
5-2. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston, 4 1/2 games behind New York in the AL East, has used  
several relievers in the late innings since losing Gordon.

<HEADLINE> Burn 1, Clash 0 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- The Dallas Burn clinched a fourth consecutive MLS  
playoff berth when Jason Kreis kicked in a teammate's misfire for 
the only goal in a 1-0 victory over the San Jose Clash on Saturday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	A crowd of 15,584 at the Cotton Bowl saw two teams aided by  
relatively mild weather move up and down the field but remain 
scoreless through 78 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Ted Eck chipped a ball over one San Jose defender, then set his  
sights for what could have been a hard-charging volley shot from 18 
yards. But he misjudged the flight of the ball and saw it bounce 
innocently off his right knee. 
</P>
<P>
	Clash defender Jimmy Conrad was standing next to Kreis as Eck's  
misfire rolled toward them. Kreis used his body to shield Conrad as 
the pair clutched and fought for position before the Burn forward 
fired from 8 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Kreis has a goal or assist in 13 of Dallas' 15 victories this  
year. His fifth game-winning goal this season -- and 15th of his 
career -- leaves him one shy of the club record he set last year and 
ties him for second in the league in that category. 
</P>
<P>
	Goalkeeper Matt Jordan added to his MLS season record for  
shutouts, posting his 10th. 
</P>
<P>
	The win officially eliminated the Clash, which will be a  
postseason no-show for a third consecutive year. 
</P>
<P>
	With five games to play, the fourth-place Burn (15-13)  
technically can still finish first.

<HEADLINE> Six Saved From Alaskan Glacier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) -- A hovering Coast Guard helicopter hoisted  
five tourists and their pilot safely off a glacier Saturday after 
they spent part of a blustery night huddled with their rescuers in 
a makeshift igloo. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no major injuries, said Steve Lewis, the head of a  
search team that packed tents, food and cold-weather survival gear 
through blowing snow to help the tourists make it through the 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	What began as a routine sightseeing flight over Juneau's  
spectacular glaciers and ice fields on Friday morning turned into a 
full-blown search for three downed helicopters in gathering 
darkness. 
</P>
<P>
	The tourist helicopter, owned by Temsco Helicopters of Juneau,  
flipped over in flat light that can make distinguishing the glacier 
from the sky almost impossible. 
</P>
<P>
	``Up there, it's just so white and so flat, you can't tell where  
the ground is,'' Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
	When the hour-long flight failed to return, the company sent out  
four people in two helicopters to search. But both wound up flipped 
on their sides more than a mile from the stranded tourists, who 
were about 20 miles north of Juneau and 4,500 feet up the Herbert 
Glacier. 
</P>
<P>
	Temsco called the Coast Guard, and a nine-member search and  
rescue team was dropped onto the glacier about 7:30 p.m. Friday 
well below the crash site. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Bartholemew of Capital City Fire and Rescue and the rest of  
the team hiked three hours across the ice in snow and gusty winds, 
using headlamps to see as darkness fell. 
</P>
<P>
	``You could see maybe 50 feet,'' he said. ``We were shouting for  
them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The high-pitched yell of a woman led the team to the upside-down  
helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
	The tourists and all 13 rescuers wound up huddled together in  
two tents after the makeshift igloo began to melt. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was still wet and cold and somewhat miserable, but  
everybody was in wonderful spirits,'' Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
	When Saturday's daylight arrived, the glacier was still shrouded  
with fog, clouds and snow, but a Coast Guard helicopter hovered 
above the site and lowered a basket to hoist the six people from 
the original helicopter about 6 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	Worsening weather kept the helicopter from returning, so the  
rescue team and the four Temsco employees hiked a short distance 
down the glacier, where a Coast Guard helicopter and three civilian 
helicopters picked them up starting about 10 a.m. By 11 a.m., all 
19 of the people who spent the night on the glacier were back in 
Juneau, the Coast Guard said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis praised the tourists' staying power.  
</P>
<P>
	``Tourists is almost derogatory for these people,'' Lewis said,  
recalling the scene as his crew approached the upside-down 
helicopter turned into an ice shelter. ``These people were 
survivalists. It had snow blocks built around it like a big 
igloo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Temsco referred all questions to the Coast Guard. Petty Officer  
Mark Hunt said the Federal Aviation Administration and the National 
Transportation Safety Board were investigating. 
</P>
<P>
	The six people from the tourist helicopter were taken to  
Bartlett Regional Hospital, where they were treated mostly for cuts 
and bruises. One tourist, Deborah Morgan, 42, of Placentia, Calif., 
had a broken ankle. 
</P>
<P>
	The others were: Rhoneel Zell, 51, and Richard Zell, 53, both of  
Novato, Calif.; William McIntyre, 72, and his son, William, 40, 
both of Irvine, Calif. The pilot's name was not available. 
</P>
<P>
	The tourists were visiting Alaska aboard the cruise ship Crown  
Princess. All refused comment when they left the hospital escorted 
by officials of Princess Cruises. 
</P>
<P>
	Helicopters sightseeing is a popular diversion for thousands of  
cruise ship passengers who visit Juneau each year, but Southeast 
Alaska's always uncertain weather becomes stormier as the tourist 
season winds down in September. 
</P>
<P>
	In June, six passengers and a pilot were killed when a  
helicopter crashed into the Herbert Glacier.

<HEADLINE> Williams Beats Hingis in First Set </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Serena Williams, spraying winners along with a  
slew of unforced errors, struggled with nerves before winning the 
first set of the U.S. Open women's championship match against 
top-seeded Martina Hingis, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams pulled to her second set point with her seventh ace of  
the match, then finally closed out the set when Hingis rapped a 
backhand into the net. 
</P>
<P>
	The 17-year-old Williams dominated the 37-minute set, forcing  
the action and usually ending the point with either a winner or an 
error. Hingis, who won her only U.S. Open two years ago when she 
beat Williams' older sister, Venus, hit only one winner in the 
first set. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams opened the match by winning the first three games,  
breaking Hingis at 30 in the second. Hingis evened the set by 
breaking back in the seventh game from deuce, but then dropped her 
own serve again when Williams rifled a backhand down the line. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't easy, but Williams finally held from deuce to close  
out the set.

<HEADLINE> APEC Must Narrow Poor, Rich Gap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) -- Pacific Rim nations must renew  
their commitment to narrowing the gap between rich and poor 
countries in the region, New Zealand Prime Minister Jenny Shipley 
said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Shipley, host of this year's Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation  
summit, said many APEC members have forgotten that reducing the gap 
was the reason the 21-member organization agreed to remove trade 
and investment barriers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now is the time to urgently lift the pace of our progress,''  
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Business groups have criticized APEC's pace in lifting trade and  
investment restrictions, saying it is unlikely to meet the goal it 
set in 1994 of free trade by 2010 for its developed members and 
2020 for its poorer members. 
</P>
<P>
	Other APEC critics, however, say unbridled free trade would  
instead hurt the poor because small businessmen and farmers in 
developing countries would be overwhelmed by powerful competitors 
from abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	Shipley rejected that view, calling free trade a ``highway to  
development and success.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to challenge those who claim the moral high ground to  
come down from their protectionist pedestal,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	In meetings Thursday and Friday, APEC trade ministers agreed  
that all agricultural export subsidies should be eliminated and 
said they will ask the World Trade Organization to consider tariff 
reductions on eight categories of goods when it meets for a new 
round of global trade talks in November. 
</P>
<P>
	APEC, however, failed itself last year to reach agreement on the  
eight sectors because of Japan's refusal to open up its fisheries 
and forestry markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Thailand's commerce minister, Supachai Panitchpakdi, who will  
lead the WTO for three years beginning in 2002, acknowledged 
progress with the eight sectors will be a challenge. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks difficult because it was already under certain  
intensive debate by APEC economies,'' Supachai said. 
</P>
<P>
	Proponents, he said, hope to win support by tying the sectors  
into a broader package with other trade proposals at the WTO. 
</P>
<P>
	The eight sectors are fisheries, forestry, chemicals, gems and  
jewelry, medical equipment, energy, environmental goods and 
services, and toys. 
</P>
<P>
	APEC reaches all its decisions by consensus and all its  
agreements are voluntary. This year's summit is APEC's first since 
it was joined by Russia, Peru and Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
	APEC's opposition to agricultural export subsidies is likely to  
set up a head-on trade collision with the European Union. 
</P>
<P>
	APEC says the subsidies make it harder for other countries to  
compete and harm Third World farmers. The 15-member EU is ``the 
only significant entity advocating the continuing use of such 
measures,'' APEC said.

<HEADLINE> Harleys for Kids To Be Sold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Small children will soon be able to cruise  
their neighborhoods in style -- on miniature electric Harleys, 
complete with saddlebags and side exhaust pipes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Power Wheels Harley-Davidson, unveiled Saturday by  
Milwaukee-based Harley Davidson and toy maker Fisher-Price, even 
make the same sound as the real thing, courtesy of sound boxes. 
</P>
<P>
	The cycle actually rides on four wheels, with two well-disguised  
outrigger wheels supplying the power, and is powered by two 
six-volt rechargeable batteries. Parents can adjust the cycle's 
speed to either 2 1/2 mph or 5 mph, depending on the size of the 
child. 
</P>
<P>
	The standard bright red model will sell for $200 to $225.  
Company officials said it would be available next month.

<HEADLINE> 9 Prison Guards Injured in Melee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RAIFORD, Fla. (AP) -- Nine guards were injured in a short riot at  
a Florida prison on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Inmates rampaged after guards chased down and tackled a prisoner  
who was masturbating near the exercise yard at Union Correctional 
Institution, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	The inmate was handcuffed by five or six officers in view of  
many of the 300 inmates gathered in the yard. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of those inmates who were observing the incident ... took  
advantage of that incident as a means for them to assault the 
correctional officers,'' prison Superintendent Dennis O'Neill said. 
``We believe there were 20 or 25 inmates involved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Inmates threw chunks of concrete and two-way radios they had  
grabbed from the guards. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight guards were treated at Shands Hospital at Starke and one  
was treated at the prison's medical clinic. 
</P>
<P>
	The prison 35 miles northeast of Gainesville was locked down and  
12 inmates were sent to solitary confinement.

<HEADLINE>  Mayweather Finds Good Life in Boxing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Floyd Mayweather is proof that winning an  
Olympic gold medal is not the only way to boxing riches. 
</P>
<P>
	The $500,000 Mayweather gets to defend his 130-pound title  
against Carlos Gerena tonight is $50,000 more than David Reid got 
to defend his 154-pound title two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Reid, of course, won the only American gold medal in the 1996  
Olympics. Mayweather, one of his teammates, was beaten in a 
controversial fight in the semifinals and had to settle for a 
bronze. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Olympics were just a growing experience,'' Mayweather  
said. ``You've got to realize I was very young. Since then, I've 
taken my time and settled down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At just 22 years old, Mayweather has already matured into a  
formidable champion, one who figures to get very rich in the ring. 
</P>
<P>
	He also has other plans for a career he hopes will be talked  
about for a long time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I plan on being a champion for 10 years,'' Mayweather said.  
``I plan on being in the history books by the time I'm done 
boxing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mayweather defends his WBC super featherweight title tonight  
against Gerena in a fight in which he is a heavy favorite. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to be America's champion,'' Mayweather said. ``I want  
to be the next Sugar Ray Leonard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mayweather appears to have the potential to be just that. His  
uncle, Jeff Mayweather, one of the fighting Mayweathers who helps 
train his nephew, thinks so. 
</P>
<P>
	``He does have the destiny to become great,'' Jeff Mayweather  
said. ``One day he's going to be great. Twenty years from now, 
people will be talking about him. He's going to be a legend.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mayweather brings a 21-0 record, with 16 knockouts, into the  
fourth defense of the title he won last Oct. 3 in a devastating 
performance against Genaro Hernandez. 
</P>
<P>
	He also brings dreams of ring greatness and a career outside the  
ring that didn't seem possible only a few years ago when he was a 
shy amateur who struggled just to make the U.S. Olympic team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm like Sugar Ray Leonard in the fact we both speak well, are  
flashy, and have good looks,'' Mayweather said. ``Plus, we're both 
good fighters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Mayweather's future world, he will be filling up the  
12,000-seat arena at the Mandalay Bay where Oscar De La Hoya meets 
Felix Trinidad next week instead of fighting in a temporary 
convention area. 
</P>
<P>
	To do that, he plans to keep fighting often on HBO, and putting  
his face in public as much as possible. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to be in the entertainment world. I want to commentate  
on HBO, I want to be on a Chris Rock special,'' Mayweather said. 
``I want to be on Oprah.'' 
</P>
<P>
	First, though, he'll simply be fighting, defending his title  
against Gerena (34-2, 28 knockouts), a member of the 1992 Puerto 
Rican Olympic team who is ranked No. 7 by the WBC. 
</P>
<P>
	Oddsmakers don't figure it will be much of a fight, making  
Mayweather an 18-1 favorite to retain the title. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's mainly just a good boxer,'' Mayweather said. ``I've got a  
lot of tricks in my bag, but I don't know if I'll have to use any 
of them in this fight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also on the card is Freddie Norwood, who will defend his WBA  
featherweight title against Mexico's Juan Manuel Marquez. 
</P>
<P>
	Norwood, dubbed ``Little Hagler'' for his resemblance to former  
middleweight champion Marvelous Marvin Hagler, is 34-0-1 with 20 
knockouts. Marquez hasn't lost since his pro debut.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton, Jiang Differ on Taiwan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) -- Trying to stabilize troubled  
relations, President Clinton and Chinese President Jiang Zemin 
ordered a swift resumption of frozen trade talks Saturday but ran 
into sharp differences over China's threats against Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
	Jiang said China reserves the right to use force to thwart any  
independence move by Taiwan, 100 miles offshore from the mainland. 
Clinton expressed sympathy with China's irritation at Taiwan but 
warned Beijing would face ``grave consequences'' if force were 
used. 
</P>
<P>
	Attending a summit of Asia-Pacific leaders, Clinton also  
increased pressure on Indonesia to invite U.N. peacekeepers to 
restore security in violence-wracked East Timor. Clinton 
underscored his point by suspending more than $100 million in arms 
deals with Indonesia. 
</P>
<P>
	Other trouble spots awaited Clinton on Sunday before the opening  
of the annual meeting of the 21-member Asia-Pacific Economic 
Cooperation forum. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was to meet with South Korean President Kim Dae-jung and  
Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi to discuss North Korea's 
possible test of a new long-range missile. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also was to see Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin  
about allegations of corruption, as well as economic and 
arms-control issues. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, at a 
dinner with Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov, urged Moscow to 
cooperate fully with American efforts to fight money-laundering by 
Russian organized crime, a U.S. official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Opening the first New Zealand visit by an American leader since  
Lyndon Johnson in 1966, Clinton immediately went on a shopping 
spree with his daughter, Chelsea, and mother-in-law, Dorothy 
Rodham. Shaking hands with well-wishers as he walked, the president 
stopped in a chocolate store, a glass gallery and an outdoors 
store, where he bought a sweater that Chelsea helped him pick. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and Jiang met for more than an hour in their first  
face-to-face talks in 15 months. Smiling, they shook hands at the 
suggestion of photographers. 
</P>
<P>
	Reporting on the talks, the president's national security  
adviser, Sandy Berger, said the two leaders, after 6 1/2 years, ``have 
learned to deal with each other through good times and bad. And as 
a result, I would consider the relationship between our countries 
now back on track with, of course, many challenges still facing 
us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and Jiang ordered aides to resume market-opening  
negotiations aimed at allowing China to achieve its long-sought bid 
to join the World Trade Organization, the influential body that 
sets the rules for global trade. 
</P>
<P>
	The trade talks were suspended in April when Clinton rejected a  
package of Chinese concessions as insufficient. Tensions were 
inflammed further by the accidental NATO bombing of the Chinese 
embassy in Yugoslavia on May 7. 
</P>
<P>
	Berger said the bombing came up in the talks only once -- when  
Jiang mentioned it as having been an obstacle to trade talks -- and 
that Clinton ``did not raise it or speak to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gene Sperling, chairman of Clinton's National Economic Council,  
said China's entry entry to the WTO could occur by year's end, 
although he stressed: ``There was no time line set. But I think 
through the discussions was a serious recognition that sooner is 
better than later.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jiang cautioned Clinton not to ask for too much from China.  
</P>
<P>
	``China is universally recognized as a developing country. We  
can never accept terms that exceed our economic capacity or 
prejudice the national interest,'' Jiang said. 
</P>
<P>
	Differences over Taiwan proved the most contentious issue.  
</P>
<P>
	Jiang sharply criticized Taiwan's president, Lee Teng-hui, who  
stirred concern in Beijing and Washington by his retreat from a 
long-standing formula underpinning eventual unification between 
China and Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
	Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao said Jiang called  
Lee ``a troublemaker'' and ``the stumbling-block in the improvement 
to China-U.S. relations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Berger said Clinton said Lee ``had made things more difficult  
for both China and the United States'' and reafffirmed the United 
States' ``one-China'' policy, which does not recognize Taiwan as an 
independent nation. But he warned Jiang against using force, urging 
him instead to pursue a peaceful settlement through dialogue. 
</P>
<P>
	Jiang told Clinton he wanted a peaceful solution but that Lee  
``had made that more difficult,'' Berger said. Jiang urged Clinton 
to discontinue U.S. arms sales to Taiwan but the president said he 
would continue to provide defensive weapons on a case-by-case 
basis. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jiang ended this by saying, `You know I'm not someone who  
likes war but 1.2 billion Chinese people are concerned about what 
has happened in Taiwan,'' Berger said.

<HEADLINE> Ohio St. Says It Complied With NCAA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Ohio State athletics director Andy Geiger  
made it clear Saturday night that the school's marketing department 
did not violate NCAA rules when it allowed the image of running 
back Michael Wiley to be put on a bank check. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no violation,'' Geiger said before the kickoff of Ohio  
State's home opener against UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
	Starting running back Michael Wiley's image is printed on a new  
check issued by Huntington National Bank, said Mark Krumel, a 
graphic designer with Columbus-based Rickabaugh Graphics. 
</P>
<P>
	Krumel said he was asked to blur the photos and to alter the  
picture of Wiley. On the check, Wiley's No. 5 was replaced with a 
zero to make the image appear generic, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A commercial entity is not permitted to use a student-athlete's  
name or picture to endorse a product or service, said Athena 
Yiamouyiannis, director of membership services for the National 
Collegiate Athletic Association. 
</P>
<P>
	But Geiger said the university contacted the NCAA and was  
granted permission. From his jacket pocket, he pulled an ``NCAA 
Interpretation Request'' mailed back from the NCAA on July 22. It 
permits Ohio State to use Wiley's image. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is permissible to use a current athlete if he or she is not  
identifiable and their current number has been changed or 
altered,'' Geiger said. 
</P>
<P>
	He added that the Wiley picture would not be used now, since he  
had been identified in an article in The Columbus Dispatch on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``So there's no issue involving Michael,'' Geiger said. ``His  
eligibility was never in jeopardy. We'll talk with the NCAA person 
on Monday, but I'm sure there's no problem because we did 
everything we were supposed to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An athlete and university usually can clear themselves in such  
cases if neither had knowledge of the photo's use. But if Ohio 
State provided the photograph, the university ``would definitely 
need to report it to the NCAA as a rules violation,'' Yiamouyiannis 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	She did not indicate what the penalties could be for the use of  
Wiley's image. 
</P>
<P>
	Maria Koob, director of advertising for Huntington, said Ohio  
State provided the photo, but she did not know whether the photo 
was of Wiley. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio State spokesman Gerry Emig said in a statement Saturday  
that the Big Ten conference allowed use of the image, as long as 
the athlete was not identifiable. 
</P>
<P>
	But now that he has been identified, it will not be used on the  
check series, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear whether Wiley was aware his image was used on the  
Huntington checks, the newspaper said. He could not be reached for 
comment Saturday because his home telephone number could not be 
found. 
</P>
<P>
	A similar incident happened in June 1983, when former Ohio State  
quarterback Mike Tomczak appeared in a Lazarus print ad. The 
university declared him ineligible, but the NCAA reinstated him a 
month later because Tomczak donated the $40 modeling fee to 
charity. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ohio State men's basketball team, including a large photo of  
guard Scoonie Penn, appears on the cover of the Ameritech Yellow 
Pages. Smith said the cover was approved by the Big Ten and the 
NCAA, which demonstrates that there are gray areas in the rules 
regarding player promotion. 
</P>
<P>
	Huntington started on Friday what it calls Buckeye Banking -- a  
checking account that includes pictures of Ohio State sports 
figures on its checks and debit cards. 
</P>
<P>
	Huntington's checks feature four photographic images: the  
marching band's Script Ohio formation and action shots from 
football, men's basketball and women's basketball. There is an OSU 
logo on the checkbook cover, and the debit card features a picture 
of a former Ohio State running back in action.

his face in public as much as possible. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to be in the entertainment world. I want to commentate  
on HBO, I want to be on a Chris Rock special,'' Mayweather said. 
``I want to be on Oprah.'' 
</P>
<P>
	First, though, he'll simply be fighting, defending his title  
against Gerena (34-2, 28 knockouts), a member of the 1992 Puerto 
Rican Olympic team who is ranked No. 7 by the WBC. 
</P>
<P>
	Oddsmakers don't figure it will be much of a fight, making  
Mayweather an 18-1 favorite to retain the title. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's mainly just a good boxer,'' Mayweather said. ``I've got a  
lot of tricks in my bag, but I don't know if I'll have to use any 
of them in this fight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also on the card is Freddie Norwood, who will defend his WBA  
featherweight title against Mexico's Juan Manuel Marquez. 
</P>
<P>
	Norwood, dubbed ``Little Hagler'' for his resemblance to former  
middleweight champion Marvelous Marvin Hagler, is 34-0-1 with 20 
knockouts. Marquez hasn't lost since his pro debut.

<HEADLINE> Statistics on Class of 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	They're doing less drugs and having fewer babies. They spend  
more hours on the Internet and more dollars at the mall. Here's a 
by-the-numbers look at the Class of 2000, and teens in general: 
</P>
<P>
	SMOKING: Last year, 22.4 percent of high-school seniors said  
they had smoked cigarettes daily in the previous month -- a slight 
decrease from 1997 but still above a 1992 low of 17.2 percent, says 
the University of Michigan's Institute for Social Research. 
</P>
<P>
	DRUGS: In 1980, 37 percent of seniors said they had used illegal  
drugs in the previous month. In 1992, that number hit a low of 14.4 
percent, then rose steadily to 26.2 percent by 1997. Last year 
marked the first decline in years, to 25.6 percent, says the 
Institute for Social Research. 
</P>
<P>
	ALCOHOL: The number of high-school seniors saying they have  
consumed alcohol in the past month remained fairly steady in the 
1990s -- 52.7 percent in 1997, according to the National Institute 
on Drug Abuse. 
</P>
<P>
	BABIES: For every 1,000 U.S. women ages 15 to 19, there were  
97.3 pregnancies in 1996, a decline of 17 percent from 117.1 per 
1,000 in 1990, according to the Alan Guttmacher Institute. The 
abortion rate was 29.2 per 1,000 teen-age women, a 31 percent 
decline since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	DROPOUTS: The Census Bureau says 4.3 percent of high school  
students dropped out in 1997, down from 5.4 percent in 1995 and 6.7 
percent in 1979. The 1997 dropout rate was 4.2 percent for whites, 
4.8 percent for blacks, and 8.6 percent for Hispanics. 
</P>
<P>
	YOUNG CRIMINALS: In the 1980s, the number of serious violent  
crimes committed by youths ages 12 to 17 fluctuated between 29 and 
40 per 1,000 youths. It peaked in 1993 at 52 crimes per 1,000 
youths, but dropped steadily to 31 per 1,000 in 1997, says the U.S. 
Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
	YOUNG VICTIMS: In 1997, 2.7 percent of youth ages 12 to 17  
reported being victims of serious violent crime such as aggravated 
assault, rape or robbery, the Justice Department says. In the 1980s 
the rate fluctuated between 3.4 percent and 4.3 percent. Still, 
youths are nearly three times more likely than adults to be victims 
of violent crime. 
</P>
<P>
	WHAT THEY SAY: According to surveys by Teenage Research  
Unlimited, a market research firm, here (in the order of their 
choice) is what teens dislike most about being teens: peer 
pressure, adults not taking them seriously, lack of money, age 
restrictions and parental pressure. What they like about being 
teens: close friends, boyfriend or girlfriend, freedom, partying. 
Their top social concerns: AIDS, education, child abuse, drinking 
and driving, racism. Their biggest everyday worries: grades, money, 
appearances, the future, getting along with parents. 
</P>
<P>
	CYBERSPACE: Eighty-three percent of teens say they've gone on  
line, and more than one-third own a computer, says Teenage Research 
Unlimited. 
</P>
<P>
	SPENDING: Teens spent about $141 billion in 1998, an increase of  
16 percent over 1997, according to Teenage Research Unlimited. They 
earned about $121 billion last year, making up the $20 billion gap 
mostly with money from their parents.

<HEADLINE> Pact on Nuclear Wastes Signed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Governors from four states have signed an  
agreement with the Department of Energy to clean up nuclear wastes 
after Energy Secretary Bill Richardson acknowledged the federal 
government has not done a good job. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are beginning a new era of cooperation between the  
Department of Energy and the states to clean up the lingering 
legacy of the Cold War,'' Richardson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement, signed Friday, includes goals and deadlines, many  
of which depend on funding that hasn't been committed by Congress. 
Governors of Colorado, South Carolina, Tennessee and Washington 
promised to work with Richardson to get the needed funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Previously, the Energy Department worked with each state  
individually on the cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
	Notably missing from Friday's meeting was the governor of New  
Mexico, host of the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant where much of the 
waste will be shipped. Richardson promised to work with New Mexico 
and other states, including Idaho, on similar agreements. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not a session getting the governors together to lobby  
Congress. It's how we, the federal government, the Department of 
Energy and the states can work together. We haven't done that 
well,'' Richardson said after a signing ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	Agreement on common issues included completing the cleanup of  
nuclear weapons plants as expeditiously as possible, and complying 
with state and federal regulations. They also pledged to seek 
``predictable and adequate funding'' for the cleanup, and a promise 
to protect the environment. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson said the states will be asking for nearly $7 billion  
through 2001. He said he's already obtained a commitment of $5.6 
billion from the Office of Management and Budget through next year.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Warns Russia on Corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) -- President Clinton warned Sunday  
that corruption and money-laundering ``could eat the heart out of 
Russian society'' unless the government forcefully combats the 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton raised the warning in a meeting with Russia Prime  
Minister Vladimir Putin before they both attended the opening of 
the annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum. 
</P>
<P>
	The two leaders also discussed arms-control issues, Russia's  
economic woes and the battle by Russian forces against Islamic 
rebels in the southern republic of Dagestan. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton assured Putin that the United States ``would continue to  
support the direction of democracy in the form in Russia that he 
has supported for the last 6 1/2 years,'' National Security Adviser 
Sandy Berger said. 
</P>
<P>
	For his part, Putin said corruption was a matter of concern, but  
suggested ``there were some political dimensions to it,'' Berger 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``But he acknowledged that money-laundering problems exist in  
Russia, as in other countries, and that we must develop a 
cooperative approach of dealing with the problem,'' Berger said. A 
team of Russian experts is due in the United States to meet with 
FBI officials on the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Berger said it was significant that Putin recognized the  
money-laundering problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Several Russians have been linked to an alleged money-laundering  
scheme at the Bank of New York, where $10 billion or more may have 
passed through accounts illegally, according to U.S. newspaper 
reports. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Swiss and Russian prosecutors have been  
investigating whether the Swiss firm Mabetex paid millions of 
dollars in kickbacks in connection with a contract to renovate the 
Kremlin. According to newspaper reports, a senior Kremlin official 
received more than $1 million, and subsequently made the money 
available to President Boris Yeltsin and his family. The Kremlin 
has said that Yeltsin did nothing wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	Putin said Yeltsin was prepared to sign a law to combat  
money-laundering if it corrected ``constitutional deficiencies'' 
that prompted him to veto an earlier measure. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president said he wants to see this problem dealt with,  
hopes that Russia will deal with it, because it could eat the heart 
out of Russian society, if the problem of corruption is not dealt 
with,'' Berger said. ``He said he wants Russia to be strong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On arms control, Putin bluntly said that ratification of the  
long-stalled START II arms-reduction treaty ``would be difficult'' 
but that he said ``we're trying our best,'' Berger said. For years, 
Yeltsin and other officials have spoken optimistically about the 
treaty's chances, but it has remained sidelined. 
</P>
<P>
	``He thought there was some wavering among the opposition to  
START II and that we should continue our discussions on START III 
(a proposed treaty for even deeper nuclear cuts) which would 
facilitate ratification of START II,'' Berger said. 
</P>
<P>
	At Clinton's urging, the United States and Russia are discussing  
possible changes in the landmark AntiBallistic Missile Treaty which 
limits both countries from developing anti-missile systems. Clinton 
argues that a limited missile defense system is needed to protect 
against possible attack by rogue nations or terrorists. 
</P>
<P>
	Putin said he underestands Clinton's concerns but that they must  
be addressed in a way that takes into acccount the security 
concerns of other countries. Russia has opposed development of an 
American anti-missile program.

<HEADLINE> Browns, Steelers Renew Rivalry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Browns defensive end Joe ``Turkey'' Jones  
wrapped both arms around Steelers quarterback Terry Bradshaw, 
hoisted him up and spiked him headfirst into the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	As Bradshaw lay flat on his back after one of the most flagrant  
fouls in NFL history, his legs twitched grotesquely and yellow 
penalty flags landed near his feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Browns fans danced in the Cleveland Stadium aisles. Bradshaw was  
flown to Pittsburgh strapped to his seat for fear of a broken neck. 
</P>
<P>
	Kind of sick, huh? Well, when you're talking Browns vs.  
Steelers, virtually anything goes. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 23 years after that play on Oct. 10, 1976, the most  
intense rivalry in the league lives on, even if it includes the 
NFL's newest team, the reborn Browns. 
</P>
<P>
	Oh, sure, Washington vs. Dallas has had its moments. So has  
Chicago vs. Green Bay and Kansas City vs. Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
	But in terms of sheer hatred for the other side, longevity and  
hitting in the stands that's been as ferocious as what's happened 
on the field, Cleveland vs. Pittsburgh stands alone. 
</P>
<P>
	And when the Browns usher in a new era of pro football following  
a three-season exile Sunday night, they'll have their new stadium 
christened with a game against their neighbor from Pennsylvania, 
the dreaded Steelers. 
</P>
<P>
	``You personally learned to hate the guy across from you when  
you played Pittsburgh,'' said Doug Dieken, a 14-year offensive 
tackle for Cleveland and current radio analyst for the Browns. 
</P>
<P>
	``I played against Dwight White for eight years. You know how  
after the game you shake another player's hand? I didn't shake his 
once. Not one time. Jack Lambert's, either. But you never wanted to 
shake Lambert's hand. He'd kick your grandmother's cane away from 
her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pittsburgh and Cleveland are about 120 miles apart. The cities  
share much more than an exit off the Ohio Turnpike, though. They're 
both industrial towns built by blue-collar workers who share the 
same values and passion for football. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is so much tradition in this game with these cities,''  
said Steelers coach Bill Cowher, who has a unique perspective on 
the rivalry because he also played for the Browns. ``They are so 
identical with the people and the passion and the way they identify 
with sports teams.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And if the Browns are to be welcomed back, Cowher figures, who  
better to do it than the gold and black. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's appropriate,'' he said. ``At the end of the first day of  
the NFL season, we are the last game of the day. It's great that 
football is back in Cleveland. It really is. It belongs there. It's 
just like if you would take football out of Pittsburgh it wouldn't 
seem right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Browns and Steelers have taken turns dominating the series.  
Between 1950 and 1970, Cleveland won 32 of 42 games. 
</P>
<P>
	But after moving into Three Rivers Stadium in '70, the Steelers  
went from NFL laughingstock to powerhouse and beat the Browns 16 
straight times at home. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bad luck, and they had good people,'' Dieken said, referring  
to reasons the Browns had problems in Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	During that streak, the Browns tried everything they could to  
break the supposed Three Rivers Jinx. 
</P>
<P>
	``We stayed in different hotels,'' he said. ``We took airplanes.  
We took buses. We tried it all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Sam Rutigliano once made an audiovisual presentation  
before the game that ended with a fake front page of the Cleveland 
Plain Dealer that said: ``Browns beat Steelers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That didn't work, either, Dieken said.  
</P>
<P>
	This week, Browns coach Chris Palmer hasn't needed any aides to  
get his team fired up for the Steelers. Cleveland's first NFL 
regular-season game since 1995 is big enough, but just to make sure 
the team's younger players understand the rivalry, tackles Orlando 
Brown and Jerry Ball have been giving them a crash course in Hating 
Pittsburgh 101. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown, who also played in Cleveland before the team left in '96  
for Baltimore, once had to be schooled, too. During Steelers Week, 
the Browns would bring in former players like Jim Brown, Ozzie 
Newsome and Hanford Dixon to fire up the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I get really hyped up for it,'' Orlando Brown said. ``I ain't  
going to lie. I hate Pittsburgh. I really hate Pittsburgh. I go out 
there and play ball. Anything yellow and black, I hit it. That's 
how they brought me up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer got his first taste of Browns vs. Steelers this spring  
when the teams took turns playing host at Grudge Luncheons to 
rekindle the rivalry. As Palmer quickly learned, there was no need 
to stoke the fires in either city despite the layoff. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is city on city here,'' he said. ``With this one, records  
don't mean that much. That's what football is all about.

	Clinton Urges Peacekeepers in E. Timor  
</P>
<P>
	AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) -- President Clinton on Sunday  
demanded that Indonesia allow an international force to restore 
peace in East Timor. He also accused Jakarta's military of aiding 
and abetting militia violence that has killed hundreds if not 
thousands of people. Minutes after Clinton concluded his address at 
an annual summit of Asia Pacific business leaders, Indonesia's 
ambassador to the United Nations ruled out any mulitnational force 
for now, saying his country's imposition of martial law on Tuesday 
was already restoring security.

	SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- A group of pardoned Puerto Rican  
prisoners received a big welcome home at San Juan airport today. 
Eleven were freed yesterday after some 20 years behind bars. Two 
prisoners rejected the offer, one accepted a deal to serve five 
more years and two who had already served out jail sentences were 
forgiven outstanding fines. The prisoners were convicted of 
sedition and illegal possession of weapons in connection with 130 
bombings in the 1970s and 1980s that killed six people and maimed 
dozens.

rains and flooding in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. But 
meteorologists said the hurricane was likely to pass well north of 
the islands. Floyd was expected to intensify, and it was unlikely 
to hit land soon. At 5 p.m. today, Floyd was centered about 335 
miles northeast of Puerto Rico's capital, San Juan and was expected 
to move west-northwest at 12 mph.

largest and most diverse student population ever starts the new

	Second E. coli Outbreak Sickens 140  
</P>
<P>
	PETERSBURG, Ill. (AP) -- In the second major E. coli outbreak in  
two weeks, more than 140 people were sickened with a deadly strain 
of the bacteria after partying in a cow pasture last weekend. Two 
people have died in New York State and more than 600 others who 
attended a county fair there have E. coli symptoms. New York health 
officials say as many as 1,000 people may have been infected, which 
would make it the worst E. coli outbreak in U.S. history. No deaths 
have been linked to the Illinois outbreak, but a health official 
said today that 18 people had been hospitalized, 127 had reported 
E. coli symptoms and those numbers were expected to rise.

Campbell helped drag wounded police officers to safety. But today, 
he was behind bars for allegedly helping to rob his own truck of 
$500,000. Police say the 36-year-old was driving an armored 
transport truck hijacked by two gunmen on Sept. 3 in suburban Van

the money.

the U.S. Open title today at age 17 in only her second year as a 
pro. Williams, 17, put on a spectacular display of mature tennis 
with an all-court attack to become the first black woman to win a 
Grand Slam title since Althea Gibson in 1958. Hingis beat Serena 
Williams' older sister, Venus, two years ago on this same court to 
win her only U.S. Open title. In other Open action today, Andre 
Agassi beat Yevgeny Kafelnikov and will face Todd Martin in the 
men's final tomorrow.

Francisco Giants beat the Atlanta Braves 3-2. Kirk Rueter allowed 
six hits in eight strong innings and struck out three and walked 
two. But the Braves helped Rueter with some poor baserunning. Robb 
Nen pitched the ninth and held on for his 33rd save in 42 
opportunities. The loss snapped the Braves' four-game winning 
streak.

<HEADLINE> Qualifier Canceled After Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTEREY, Calif. (AP) -- In a symbolic and eerie tribute to  
Gonzalo Rodriguez, a rookie driver killed in a crash earlier 
Saturday, the pit lane and track at Laguna Seca Raceway remained 
silent during the afternoon qualifying period. 
</P>
<P>
	CART flagman Jim Swintell stood in the stand overlooking the  
main straightaway, silently holding a green flag over the track as 
the clock ticked away the final round of time trials for Sunday's 
Shell 300. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just unbelievable what happened this morning,'' said CART  
owner-driver Robby Gordon. ``Out of respect for Gonzalo and his 
family, the drivers stuck together and decided to have an afternoon 
of silence. It's the least we can do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez, hoping to qualify for his second CART FedEx Series  
start, died instantly when his Penske Racing Lola crashed during 
the morning practice. 
</P>
<P>
	His car went off course and sped over a gravel pit designed to  
slow the cars. It slammed through a tire barrier and into a 
concrete wall before flipping high in the air, clearing a fence and 
landing upside down on a grassy hillside. 
</P>
<P>
	The 27-year-old from Uruguay was pronounced dead after being  
taken by ambulance to a nearby hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	The practice session was immediately halted and it took several  
hours for the damage to the concrete barrier to be repaired. It was 
estimated that Rodriguez hit the wall at more than 140 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	CART officials met with the drivers, who requested that the  
qualifying session be canceled out of respect for Rodriguez and his 
family. But it was also decided to go on with the race as 
scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no immediate answers to questions about the cause of  
the fatal accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Initially, it was speculated that the throttle stuck open, but a  
Mercedes spokesman said telemetry from the car showed the throttle 
was working as expected when the accident occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, our initial reaction was to work on driver-related  
issues,'' said Andrew Craig, president and CEO of CART. ``CART has 
impounded the car, which is our standard procedure, and we will, of 
course, be looking at the telemetry and working closely with the 
team to identify the cause of this accident.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first driver fatality in CART since Jeff Krosnoff was killed  
during a race in Toronto in July 1996 cast a pall over the 
picturesque Monterey Peninsula track on warm, sunny day. 
</P>
<P>
	It was reported that several of the drivers were crying during  
the meeting following the fatal crash. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a terrible tragedy,'' said two-time Laguna winner Michael  
Andretti. ``Our hearts go out to his family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Andretti, Scott Pruett, president of the Championship Drivers  
Association, and pole-winner Bryan Herta went together to inspect 
the accident site as additional impact-absorbing materials and a 
second tire barrier were added to the area and repairs were made to 
the cracked concrete wall. 
</P>
<P>
	The 2.238-mile, nine-turn track reopened for a Toyota-Atlantic  
practice and race after a four-hour delay. 
</P>
<P>
	Except for the Penske team, which withdrew its entry for the  
cars driven by Rodriguez and Al Unser Jr., the teams and drivers 
had to begin thinking about the 83-lap, 185.8-mile race. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very hard to think about racing now,'' said a CART  
driver, who asked not to be identified. ``But we have a race to run 
and we'll all do our jobs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Friday's qualifying determining the starting positions,  
Herta, the defending champion, will start from the pole for the 
third straight year, with Tony Kanaan alongside. 
</P>
<P>
	Juan Montoya, the series points leader who struggled with his  
car's handling on Friday, will start 16th -- his worst qualifying 
effort of the season.

<HEADLINE> Lott: Major Tax Cut Will Wait </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A major tax cut will likely have to wait until  
Americans return a Republican Congress and a GOP president to the 
nation's capital in the 2000 elections, Senate Majority Leader 
Trent Lott said today. 
</P>
<P>
	In the weekly Republican radio address, Lott said he expects  
President Clinton to seek a deal on a smaller tax cut and more 
spending after the president vetoes the 10-year, $792 billion tax 
relief package passed in August by Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans, Lott said, should resist that temptation.  
</P>
<P>
	``He'll agree to some throw-away tax fixes in return for a  
massive hike in spending for all his pet projects,'' said Lott, 
R-Miss. ``It would be impolite to call that blackmail, but we've 
been through this routine before, and we know where it ends up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``That's why it looks as if real tax relief will have to wait  
until a Republican president can join your Republican Congress in 
enacting it into law,'' Lott added. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, a limited tax measure Congress must pass this year could  
provide a last-ditch opportunity for compromise tax relief. 
</P>
<P>
	The must-pass measure -- called the ``extenders'' package on  
Capitol Hill -- would renew several already-expired tax credits 
favored by business, including a research and development credit 
popular with high-tech companies and manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP leaders say it is highly unlikely Congress will pass a  
second major tax cut bill this year after Clinton's veto, expected 
as early as next week. But they unanimously support extension of 
the business credits, as do most Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	``The extenders are something that we're going to have to work  
on,'' said House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill. ``That's nuts and 
bolts stuff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Over 10 years, the doomed $792 billion bill would reduce all  
income tax rates by 1 percentage point, ease the marriage penalty 
on many two-income couples, eliminate estate taxes and the 
alternative minimum income tax, reduce capital gains taxes, expand 
pension and 401(k) laws and provide numerous business tax breaks. 
</P>
<P>
	It also would renew the business credits, which Congress extends  
only a year or so at a time in part to ensure there will be an 
annual engine to drive the tax debate. The credits, which expired 
June 30, include those that encourage businesses to hire former 
welfare recipients and exempt certain foreign finance operations 
from taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	The question is whether that modest package will move alone in  
this congressional session's final weeks or if other, broader tax 
cuts might be attached. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Republicans want to capitalize on what they insist is a  
shift in public opinion toward tax relief caused by their August 
publicity campaign. But they don't want a dark-of-night deal with 
Clinton and the Democrats that trades tax cuts for sharp government 
spending increases. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope we will be able to work with the president,'' said Sen.  
Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas. ``I believe, in the end, we will 
have a tax cut.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats, meanwhile, are talking more about a tax cut  
compromise now that GOP leaders have declared the issue all but 
dead for this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Before leaving for an economic conference in New Zealand,  
Clinton said his ``door is open'' to tax negotiations and that 
failure to try would indicate the GOP always intended to use taxes 
as a 2000 campaign issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whether there is a bill, of course, is up to them,'' the  
president said. ``They can control what bills come up. But if 
they're saying, well, 'It's our way or no way,' then that is 
evidence that this has been pretty much about politics all along.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer, R-Texas,  
said the tax bill is not merely a political document and he wants 
to see ``as much tax relief as possible for the American people'' 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	But even if Republicans do negotiate with the president, Archer  
said it will be difficult to resolve philosophical differences on 
tax relief. The GOP, he said, wants to cut income taxes for people 
who pay them -- middle- and upper-class taxpayers -- while Clinton 
favors a variety of credits geared toward working classes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to see tax relief go to the people who pay the taxes,''  
Archer said in an interview. ``They want tax relief targeted to 
people who aren't paying income taxes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, the White House has argued that the $792 billion tax  
cut's benefits were unfairly divided, with 60 percent going to 
people in the top 10 percent income brackets. But Republicans, 
noting that some 48 million lower-earning Americans paid no income 
taxes last year, say actual taxpayers deserve a break. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration contends that roughly $250 billion of the GOP  
bill fits Clinton's goal of tax relief for the middle class, 
providing a chance for compromise if spending and Medicare reform 
are also addressed. 
</P>
<P>
	``It sounds to us like they're giving up too early,'' Office of  
Management and Budget Director Jack Lew said Friday of the GOP. 
``We're not ready to quit in terms of putting a package together.''

<HEADLINE> Cubans Allege Pan Am Conspiracy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- The Cuban representative at a  
regional sports convention on Saturday accused officials of the Pan 
American Games and the International Boxing Association of a 
conspiracy against Cuban athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	Ciro Perez Hebra, treasurer of Cuba's Olympic Committee,  
reiterated his government's claim that high jumper Javier 
Sotomayor, who was stripped of his gold medal at last month's Pan 
American Games in Canada when he tested positive for cocaine use, 
was a conspiracy victim. 
</P>
<P>
	Perez Hebra attacked the international sports organizations for  
what he called its ``lies, fraud and victimization of Cuban 
athletes'' while speaking at the Central American Sports 
Organization general assembly. 
</P>
<P>
	He also rejected the Pan American Games committee's charges that  
three Cuban weightlifters who failed drug tests at the Pan American 
Games and said his government had begun a process to clear their 
names. 
</P>
<P>
	He verbally attacked the International Boxing Association for  
its judges ``unjust'' decisions at the world championships in 
Houston last month and referred to ``the mafia that runs it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Cuban government has been calling for an investigation into  
disputed bouts. After one match, the association suspended four 
judges for irregularities after giving a Russian fighter a victory 
over a Cuban. The decision was reversed and the Cuban was given the 
gold medal. 
</P>
<P>
	The vice president of the boxing association, Ricardo Contreras  
of Mexico, sharply told Perez Hebra that his mafia comment was out 
of line and that the assembly meeting was not the proper forum.

<HEADLINE> Actress Ruth Roman Dead at 75 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAGUNA BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- Ruth Roman, who starred opposite  
Gary Cooper and Errol Flynn and survived the Andrea Doria wreck at 
sea, has died. She was 75. 
</P>
<P>
	Roman died Thursday in her sleep at her Laguna Beach home, said  
her son, Richard Hall. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1956, she and her son -- then 3 -- were returning from Italy  
aboard the luxury passenger liner Andrea Doria when it was struck 
by another ship. More than fifty people died and 760 survived after 
the ship went down. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boston-born actress got her start in community plays at age  
9. She attended drama school and later moved to Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
	Roman appeared in some minor films before her big break in  
Stanley Kramer's 1949 ``Champion,'' which featured Kirk Douglas as 
an unscrupulous boxer. Following the film, Warner Bros. offered 
Roman a contract and she starred in nine films in less than two 
years opposite Cooper, Flynn and James Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
	Roman also appeared in ``Beyond the Forest'' with Bette Davis,  
``Three Secrets'' with Patricia Neal and ``Mara Maru'' with Flynn. 
Her other films included ``The Far Country'' with Stewart, ``Bitter 
Victory'' with Richard Burton and ``Dallas'' with Cooper. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, Roman appeared in more than 30 movies, most of them in  
the 1950s, and a number of television shows in the 1960s and 1970s, 
including ``Naked City,'' ``Knots Landing'' and ``Murder She 
Wrote.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Roman once told The New York Times of her shipwreck experience  
that she never feared she would or her son would die. She said she 
was dancing on board the Andrea Doria when, ``We heard a big 
explosion, like a firecracker.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When it became clear the ship was sinking, passengers began  
piling into lifeboats. With her son, she climbed down a rope ladder 
to one of the boats, but it pulled away before they could hop on. 
Soon they were put on another lifeboat.

<HEADLINE> German Utility Giants May Merge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERLIN (AP) -- German utility giants Veba and Viag have worked  
out a merger proposal and expect to complete the deal within weeks, 
according to media reports Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Both companies' chairmen have drafted a roughly 20-page accord  
that would merge their energy and chemical businesses and also 
include Viag's telecommunications unit, the weekly Der Spiegel 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bavarian governor Edmund Stoiber, whose state owns 25.1 percent  
of Viag, was quoted in the Welt am Sonntag newspaper as saying that 
the merger talks are ``very far advanced'' and he expected them to 
wrap up within weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Bavaria must approve the proposal. The state government has said  
it wants to sell its Viag stake by 2003 but also wants to protect 
the 20,000 jobs Viag has in Bavaria. The merger also requires the 
approval of German antitrust authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies' proposal calls for shareholders to vote on the  
merger early next year so the new conglomerate can start business 
by mid-2000, Der Spiegel said. 
</P>
<P>
	Company officials could not be reached for comment Saturday.  
</P>
<P>
	Veba and Viag are the second- and third-largest German energy  
companies, respectively, in terms of sales. Combined, they would 
move into the top spot in the country with total 1998 sales of 
$10.9 billion, but they would still trail Electricite de France.

<TEXT>
<P>
	Some keys features of the F-22 Raptor, the new-generation Air  
Force fighter that some in Congress want to slow down or cancel: 
</P>
<P>
	--Cost: At a projected total cost for 339 planes of about $63  
billion, including research and development, each plane would cost 
about $185 million. This year's defense budget includes $2.4 
billion for the F-22, and the administration is requesting another 
$3.1 billion in the fiscal 2000 budget. 
</P>
<P>
	--Air speed: Mach 2, or twice the speed of sound.  
</P>
<P>
	--Mission: To defeat an enemy's air defenses in order to  
establish U.S. superiority in the air battle, clearing the way for 
air-to-ground fighters and bombers to attack with impunity. Also, 
to protect slower-moving support planes in the battle area, such as 
refuelers, communications planes and surveillance aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
	--Schedule: The Air Force is to begin operating the first unit of  
F-22s in 2005. The last of the fleet is to be delivered by 2013.

<HEADLINE> Wust Wins Tour of Spain 4th Stage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEON, Spain (AP) -- German Marcel Wust inched ahead of the pack  
in the final strides Saturday for his fourth stage win in the Tour 
of Spain, while defending champion Abraham Olano retained the 
overall lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Wust, who won the second, third and fourth stages, covered the  
135-mile seventh stage between Salamanca and Leon in 4 hours, 39 
minutes, 35 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	In a photo finish, Wust, riding for Festina, was awarded the  
victory while nearest contender Robbie McEwen of Australia was 
given second place and Italy's Mario Traversoni third. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm the strongest in the tour,'' Wust said. ``When was the  
last time someone won three stages consecutively? You'll have to 
check the books.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wust, who led the tour in winning the other three stages earlier  
this week, is at No. 119 after poor performances in the fifth and 
sixth stages. 
</P>
<P>
	During Saturday's race, U.S. rider Bobby Julich had to be taken  
to a hospital for concussion after he fell 12 miles into the race. 
He was released later in the day with a neck brace and numerous 
bruises.

                            *Alfredo Gil    	
</P>
<P>
	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Alfredo ``El Guero'' Gil, the last surviving  
member of the original romantic trio Los Panchos, died Friday in 
Mexico City. He was 84 and had been suffering from pulmonary 
emphysema. 
</P>
<P>
	Gil was born in the central state of Puebla and became a  
professional musician at age 15. In 1944, he was in New York when 
he linked up with two other musicians -- Chucho Navarro and Hernando 
Aviles of Puerto Rico -- to form Los Panchos, in which Gil played 
the ``requinto,'' a small guitar. 
</P>
<P>
	The trio was known for its soft harmonics, particularly in the  
romantic bolero. Its emotional interpretations of ``Besame Mucho'' 
(Kiss Me), ``Quizas, Quizas, Quizas'' (Perhaps, Perhaps, Perhaps) 
and ``Sin Ti'' (Without You) propelled them to international fame. 
The band appeared in more than 50 films during Mexico's ``Golden 
Era'' of cinema. 
</P>
<P>
	With Gil's death Friday night, Mexico City radio stations  
devoted much of their programming to Los Panchos' songs. 
</P>
<P>
	Gil is survived by his wife, Guadalupe Bedoy, and five children.  
Funeral services were held Saturday. 

</P>
<P>
                            *Beau Jocque    	
</P>
<P>
	KINDER, La. (AP) -- Beau Jocque, an accordian player who helped  
revitalize Louisiana's zydeco music, is dead of an apparent heart 
attack. He was 45. 
</P>
<P>
	Jocque, whose given name was Andrus Espre, performed Thursday  
night in New Orleans, then drove 177 miles home to Kinder. His wife 
found him collapsed in the shower Friday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Jocque worked as a welder before picking up his father's  
piano-key accordion. In his version of zydeco, he combined 
rhythm-and-blues, hip-hop beats, funk and Texas blues-rock. 
</P>
<P>
	He was credited with bringing zydeco, a mix of old-time cajun  
music and rhythm-and-blues, to contemporary audiences, filling 
halls in Lafayette, Lawtell, New Orleans and other cities where he 
often played with his band, the Zydeco Hi-Rollers. He also played 
overseas, and on the David Letterman and Conan O'Brien shows. 
</P>
<P>
	When the 6-foot-6 Jocque played one of his big hits, ``Give Him  
Cornbread,'' audiences would pelt him with pieces of cornbread. 
</P>
<P>
	Jocque is survived by his wife, Shelly Espre, and two sons.  

</P>
<P>
                            *John Molloy    	
</P>
<P>
	OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- John Molloy, an Irish actor and novelist,  
died Sept. 2 after a long illness. He was 70. 
</P>
<P>
	Born in Dublin, Molloy ran away from home at 14 to join a troupe  
of actors that roamed the country performing in small towns, and 
later worked with Marcel Marceau in Paris and with the Gate and 
Abbey theatres in Dublin. At the Abbey, he specialized in the works 
of Samuel Beckett. 
</P>
<P>
	Molloy appeared in some 60 movies and played Broadway in his own  
two-man show, ``Double Dublin,'' in 1963-64. He wrote 39 revues, 
two musicals, many TV and radio plays and a best-selling novel, 
``Alive, Alive-O.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He is best known in the San Francisco Bay area for his one-man  
show, ``Molloy,'' a hit of the San Francisco International Theatre 
Festival in 1981, but worked through the 1980s with a series of 
local solo shows. 
</P>
<P>
	Molloy is survived by his nine children: five sons and four  
daughters. 

</P>
<P>
                            *Ruth Roman    	
</P>
<P>
	LAGUNA BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- Ruth Roman, who starred opposite  
Gary Cooper and Errol Flynn and survived the Andrea Doria wreck at 
sea, died in her sleep Thursday. She was 75. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1956, she and her 3-year-old son were returning from Italy  
aboard the luxury passenger liner Andrea Doria when it was struck 
by another ship. More than fifty people died and 760 survived after 
the ship went down. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boston-born actress got her start in community plays at age  
9. She attended drama school and later moved to Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
	Roman appeared in some minor films before her big break in  
Stanley Kramer's 1949 ``Champion,'' which featured Kirk Douglas as 
an unscrupulous boxer. Following the film, Warner Bros. offered 
Roman a contract and she starred in nine films in less than two 
years opposite Cooper, Flynn and James Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
	Roman also appeared in ``Beyond the Forest'' with Bette Davis,  
``Three Secrets'' with Patricia Neal and ``Mara Maru'' with Flynn. 
Roman appeared in more than 30 movies, most of them in the 1950s, 
and a number of television shows in the 1960s and 1970s. 

</P>
<P>
                    *Eugene ``Frenchy'' Schwartz    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Eugene ``Frenchy'' Schwartz, a fixture at  
racetracks as a clocker of thoroughbreds for nearly 50 years died 
Wednesday following a long illness. He was 97. 
</P>
<P>
	Schwartz began his career at Omaha in 1933 and went on to time  
horses during workouts at tracks in New Orleans, Ohio and at 
Hollywood Park in California before working at New York tracks in 
1949. He retired his clocker's watch in January 1982, but remained 
a familiar sight at racetracks.

<HEADLINE> Statistics on Class of 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	They're doing less drugs and having fewer babies. They spend  
more hours on the Internet and more dollars at the mall. Here's a 
by-the-numbers look at the Class of 2000, and teens in general: 
</P>
<P>
	SMOKING: Last year, 22.4 percent of high-school seniors said  
they had smoked cigarettes daily in the previous month -- a slight 
decrease from 1997 but still above a 1992 low of 17.2 percent, says 
the University of Michigan's Institute for Social Research. 
</P>
<P>
	DRUGS: In 1980, 37 percent of seniors said they had used illegal  
drugs in the previous month. In 1992, that number hit a low of 14.4 
percent, then rose steadily to 26.2 percent by 1997. Last year 
marked the first decline in years, to 25.6 percent, says the 
Institute for Social Research. 
</P>
<P>
	ALCOHOL: The number of high-school seniors saying they have  
consumed alcohol in the past month remained fairly steady in the 
1990s -- 52.7 percent in 1997, according to the National Institute 
on Drug Abuse. 
</P>
<P>
	BABIES: For every 1,000 U.S. women ages 15 to 19, there were  
97.3 pregnancies in 1996, a decline of 17 percent from 117.1 per 
1,000 in 1990, according to the Alan Guttmacher Institute. The 
abortion rate was 29.2 per 1,000 teen-age women, a 31 percent 
decline since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	DROPOUTS: The Census Bureau says 4.3 percent of high school  
students dropped out in 1997, down from 5.4 percent in 1995 and 6.7 
percent in 1979. The 1997 dropout rate was 4.2 percent for whites, 
4.8 percent for blacks, and 8.6 percent for Hispanics. 
</P>
<P>
	YOUNG CRIMINALS: In the 1980s, the number of serious violent  
crimes committed by youths ages 12 to 17 fluctuated between 29 and 
40 per 1,000 youths. It peaked in 1993 at 52 crimes per 1,000 
youths, but dropped steadily to 31 per 1,000 in 1997, says the U.S. 
Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
	YOUNG VICTIMS: In 1997, 2.7 percent of youth ages 12 to 17  
reported being victims of serious violent crime such as aggravated 
assault, rape or robbery, the Justice Department says. In the 1980s 
the rate fluctuated between 3.4 percent and 4.3 percent. Still, 
youths are nearly three times more likely than adults to be victims 
of violent crime. 
</P>
<P>
	WHAT THEY SAY: According to surveys by Teenage Research  
Unlimited, a market research firm, here (in the order of their 
choice) is what teens dislike most about being teens: peer 
pressure, adults not taking them seriously, lack of money, age 
restrictions and parental pressure. What they like about being 
teens: close friends, boyfriend or girlfriend, freedom, partying. 
Their top social concerns: AIDS, education, child abuse, drinking 
and driving, racism. Their biggest everyday worries: grades, money, 
appearances, the future, getting along with parents. 
</P>
<P>
	CYBERSPACE: Eighty-three percent of teens say they've gone on  
line, and more than one-third own a computer, says Teenage Research 
Unlimited. 
</P>
<P>
	SPENDING: Teens spent about $141 billion in 1998, an increase of  
16 percent over 1997, according to Teenage Research Unlimited. They 
earned about $121 billion last year, making up the $20 billion gap 
mostly with money from their parents.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Chides Indonesia's Military </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) -- President Clinton demanded Sunday  
that a defiant Indonesia allow an international force to restore 
peace in East Timor, saying Jakarta's military has ``aided and 
abetted militia violence'' that has killed hundreds if not 
thousands of people. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Indonesian government and military must not only stop what  
they are doing but reverse course,'' Clinton said in his toughest 
words yet about the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Reviewing Asian trouble spots in a speech to business leaders,  
the president also urged China and Taiwan to resolve their 
differences peacefully and called on North Korea to abandon 
suspected missile tests. 
</P>
<P>
	After a fence-mending meeting with Chinese President Jiang  
Zemin, Clinton said he hoped Beijing and Washington could swiftly 
reach a market-opening trade deal. ``I hope we can make it happen 
soon,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton spoke a day after the United States froze upwards of  
$100 million in military deals with Indonesia in an effort to 
pressure Jakarta into allowing the U.N. to help stem the chaos in 
East Timor. 
</P>
<P>
	However, minutes after Clinton concluded his address,  
Indonesia's ambassador to the United Nations ruled out any 
mulitnational force for now, saying his country's imposition of 
martial law on Tuesday was already restoring security. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said Indonesia did the right thing in allowing East  
Timor to stage an independence vote, which overwhelmingly called 
for a break with Jakarta. ``Now it is clear, however, that the 
Indonesian military has aided and abetted militia violence in East 
Timor in violation of the commitment of its leaders to the 
international community,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has allowed the militias to murder innocent people, to  
send thousands fleeing for their lives, to attack the United 
Nations compound,'' said the president. He said that beyond 
suspending military cooperation, ``I have made clear that my 
willingness to support future economic assistance from the 
international community will depend upon how Indonesia handles the 
situation from today forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He warned that ``the present course of action is imperiling  
Indonesia's future as well as that of the individual East 
Timorese.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The Indonesian government and military must not only stop what  
they are doing but reverse course,'' he said. ``They must halt the 
violence not just in Dili but throughout the nation. They must 
permit humanitarian assistance and let the U.N. mission do its job. 
They must allow the East Timorese who have been pushed from their 
homes to return safely. They must implement the results of the 
balloting. And they must allow an international force to help 
restore security.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reporting on his talks Saturday with the Chinese president,  
Clinton said he urged a peaceful solution to inflamed tensions with 
Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
	``These peoples have too much at stake in a peaceful future,  
benefiting all their children, to let the present difficulties 
deteriorate into a confrontation in which in the end all would 
suffer,'' the president said. 
</P>
<P>
	Later in the day, Clinton was meeting with South Korean  
President Kim Dae-jung and Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi to 
discuss North Korea's apparent preparations for a long-range 
missile test. 
</P>
<P>
	``The people of North Korea need food and opportunities,'' the  
president said. ``They need engagement with the South, and the 
chance for a brighter future. They do not need new weaponry that 
threatens the security of the region and the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president also was to meet with Russia's new prime minister,  
Vladimir Putin, on the heels of allegations of corruption in the 
Kremlin and reported money laundering of billions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton told the business leaders that Asia is rebounding from  
the crisis that swept the region and threw a dark cloud last year 
over the annual summit of Asia-Pacific leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	``Economies that were going downhill then now seem to be clearly  
on the road to recovery,'' the president said. As an example, he 
cited South Korea, where industrial production is up 30 percent and 
its economy is expected to grow at least 6.5 percent this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``All over the region key stock markets are now above pre-crisis  
levels,'' Clinton said. ``Currencies are stronger, workers are 
going back to work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The hour-long meeting Saturday with Jiang was viewed as a  
success by both sides after months of tensions over trade and the 
accidental bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Reporting on the talks, the president's national security  
adviser, Sandy Berger, said the two leaders, after 6 1/2 years, ``have 
learned to deal with each other through good times and bad. And as 
a result, I would consider the relationship between our countries 
now back on track with, of course, many challenges still facing 
us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and Jiang ordered aides to resume market-opening  
negotiations aimed at allowing China to achieve its long-sought bid 
to join the World Trade Organization, the influential body that 
sets the rules for global trade. A White House aide said China's 
entry to the WTO could occur by year's end. 
</P>
<P>
	Differences over Taiwan proved the most contentious issue.  
</P>
<P>
	Jiang sharply criticized Taiwan's president, Lee Teng-hui, who  
stirred concern in Beijing and Washington by his retreat from a 
long-standing formula underpinning eventual unification between 
China and Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
	Berger said Clinton said Lee ``had made things more difficult  
for both China and the United States'' and reaffirmed the United 
States' ``one-China'' policy, which does not recognize Taiwan as an 
independent nation. But he warned Jiang against using force, urging 
him instead to pursue a peaceful settlement through dialogue.

<HEADLINE>  Book Makes Cold War-Era Claims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- A new book based on long-secret KGB archives makes  
a number of shocking Cold War-era claims -- that the KGB planted 
rumors that the CIA assassinated John F. Kennedy and that J. Edgar 
Hoover was gay, and that Soviet spies buried booby-trapped 
explosives in the United States and Europe, according to news 
reports. 
</P>
<P>
	The book, being published this month, also reveals that an  
87-year-old British woman was a long-serving Soviet spy and that a 
former Scotland Yard officer served as a messenger for the Soviet 
spy agency in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	The book is based on thousands of copies of KGB papers brought  
out of the Soviet Union by Vasili Mitrokhin, an archivist for the 
Soviet intelligence service, when he defected to the West in 1992. 
Its contents were reported by The Sunday Times in London and a BBC 
television interview being broadcast on Sunday by CBS' 60 Minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitrokhin, who reportedly copied thousands of pages from secret  
KGB files over a 12-year period and handed them over to the West, 
said the agency forged documents to pin the blame for JFK's 
assassination on a CIA and right-wing conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
	In its attempt to establish a link between Kennedy's  
assassination and the CIA, the KGB secretly bankrolled the first 
book published in America about the incident, ``Oswald: Assassin or 
Fallguy,'' 60 Minutes reports. 
</P>
<P>
	The KGB also falsified a letter supposedly written by Lee Harvey  
Oswald to Howard Hunt, a former CIA officer. The letter looked so 
real that it even fooled Oswald's widow, the news program says. 
</P>
<P>
	KGB agents reportedly also mailed forged letters to major U.S.  
newspapers to support rumors that Hoover, then the FBI director, 
was a homosexual. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Mitrokhin, KGB spies in the 1960s and 1970s also  
surveyed potential sabotage targets in the United States and 
Western Europe and buried booby-trapped arms caches near the sites. 
Explosives remain buried today, 60 Minutes reports, though there 
was no information on exactly where they might be buried. 
</P>
<P>
	There were conflicting reports on the name of the new book by  
historian Christopher Andrew. The Sunday Times said it will be 
called ``The Mitrokhin Archive,'' but other reports referred to it 
as ``The Sword and the Shield.'' The book's publishers -- Basic 
Books in the United States and Penguin Books in Britain -- could not 
be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitrokhin, a former KGB archive official, said he started  
copying the agency's secret documents in 1972, after growing 
disillusioned with the agency's crackdown on dissidents. He said he 
smuggled the documents out, hidden in his shoes and pockets. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitrokhin told the BBC that it was ``his public duty to humanity  
and as a Russian patriot'' to reveal Soviet espionage against 
America. 
</P>
<P>
	The papers reveal that former police officer John Symonds left  
Britain in 1969 under suspicion of corruption and was recruited by 
the KGB, early editions of the Sunday Times reported. The newspaper 
said Symonds gave the Soviets names of police he knew to be corrupt 
and undertook a number of missions as a messenger. 
</P>
<P>
	Symonds returned to Britain in 1980, gave himself up and served  
a two-year sentence on corruption charges, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Times of London, sister newspaper of The Sunday Times, is  
serializing ``The Mitrokhin Archive.'' It reported Saturday that a 
British woman, code-named Hola, had given the Soviets information 
important to the development of their nuclear weapons since the 
1930s. 
</P>
<P>
	Hola -- a.k.a. Melita Norwood of suburban Bexleyheath --  
reportedly had access to British atomic secrets through her office 
job at the British Non-Ferrous Metals Research Association, which 
was involved in metallurgical research associated with the bomb 
project, The Times said. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew said Mrs. Norwood began working at the research  
association in 1932, when she was 20. 
</P>
<P>
	``Despite her comparatively lowly position, she was later to  
gain access to important scientific and technological 
intelligence,'' Andrew wrote in The Times. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Norwood on Saturday said she would do it all again because  
of her belief in communism. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did what I did, not to make money, but to help prevent the  
defeat of a new system which had at great cost given ordinary 
people food and fares which they could afford, good education and a 
health service,'' Mrs. Norwood said, reading a statement outside 
her home. 
</P>
<P>
	The opposition Conservative Party demanded a statement from the  
government on Mrs. Norwood's case and on The Times' report that her 
prosecution for espionage was ruled out last year.

	HATAOKA, Japan (AP) -- About 1,700 Japan Self-Defense Force  
soldiers participated in live fire drills Saturday at the foot of 
Mount Fuji in Japan's only large-scale military exercises open to

<HEADLINE> Pardoned Militants Return As Heroes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- Waving Puerto Rican flags, singing  
nationalist songs and banging madly on leather ``pandereta'' drums, 
supporters welcomed home ``as a king'' the first of 11 prisoners 
granted a controversial pardon by President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	The hero's welcome for Chicago-born Edwin Cortes on Friday night  
was repeated today, when six more prisoners are expected -- living 
symbols of a nationhood many here believe in and cherish after a 
century of U.S. rule. Two more are to arrive Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope to follow the examples (of) Nelson Mandela, Gerry Adams  
and Yasser Arafat, who were also labeled as criminals and 
terrorists but in the minds of their people were patriots,'' 
Cortes, 44, said upon his release earlier Friday. ``Today, they are 
considered international statesmen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This week's clemency deal brought renewed censure upon the  
president and underscored Washington's complicated relationship 
with this Spanish-speaking Caribbean island, which some still call 
a colony. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics said Clinton was soft on terrorism: All but one of the  
released belonged to a group responsible for 130 bombings between 
1973 and 1984, killing six and maiming dozens. Puerto Ricans have 
argued that the sentences against them -- from 35 to 90 years -- were 
excessive for people convicted of sedition but not the actual 
bombings. Still, the attacks stopped after the arrests. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands marched in San Juan two weeks ago to demand the  
prisoners' release, which many here considered a humanitarian 
cause. But only a couple hundred people showed up at the airport 
today, reflecting the miniscule support for their campaign for 
independence -- less than 3 percent in a December referendum -- after 
101 years of U.S. rule that have brought a measure of prosperity 
and stability. 
</P>
<P>
	But the tremendous sympathy for the returning prisoners was  
evident in the group who waited hours -- some screaming with joy -- 
for a delayed flight to greet Cortes, who had served 16 1/2 years of 
his 90-year sentence in jail in Lewisburg, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	People banged drums, frantically shook maracas, waved posters of  
the ex-prisoners and belted out nationalist songs in Spanish. 
Singing the nationalist version of the unofficial Puerto Rican 
anthem, they replaced the line promoting ``Puerto Rico -- the island 
of the sea and the sun'' with ``Puerto Rico -- the land of freedom, 
freedom, freedom.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mary Cortes hailed ``a great victory'' and said she couldn't  
wait to hug and kiss the brother she has not seen for 16 years, and 
``serve him as a king.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cortes -- like many of his fellow ex-prisoners -- has never lived  
on the island where, despite sympathy for his cause, the 
overwhelming majority favor either maintaining the status quo or 
upgrading ties to the United States and becoming the 51st state. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the current ``commonwealth'' arrangement, the island of  
3.8 million is a semi-autonomous U.S. territory whose people do not 
pay federal taxes but receive more than $10 billion annually in 
federal aid. They are citizens but cannot vote for president and 
are eligible for the draft. Thousands served in Vietnam, including 
one prisoner awarded the bronze star of valor who turned down the 
clemency offer on principle. 
</P>
<P>
	Their sole representative in Congress doesn't have a vote.  
</P>
<P>
	That representative, Carlos Romero Barcelo, a Republican who has  
always been against pardoning the prisoners, warned Friday that 
their release and its embrace by islanders have further damaged 
Puerto Ricans' image in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, there's an impression in the United States that  
Puerto Ricans support terrorism,'' he told Telemundo television. 
``There will be repercussions for people who work (in the United 
States), people who are looking for employment and the Puerto Rican 
community in general.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, instead of helping heal resentments, the clemency seemed  
to deepen rifts. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's act of forgiveness prompted charges he was trying to  
promote his wife's nascent effort to run for the Senate by helping 
her with the 1.3 million Puerto Ricans in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton initially herself has distanced herself from the  
clemency. But as the first of the nationalists was set free, she 
admitted she may have been hasty in reaching her decision to oppose 
their release. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a number of Hispanic advisers and ... I have to admit  
that the consultation process was not what it should have been and 
that will never happen again,'' Hillary Rodham Clinton told over 
300 Hispanic, black and Asian women leaders on Friday in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Several law enforcement agencies opposed the release and on  
Thursday, the House of Representatives condemned the clemency offer 
on a 311-41 vote that included many Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the prisoners' supporters resented the conditions  
attached: Beyond renouncing violence, the prisoners must avoid 
meeting with other convicted felons, which if applied broadly could 
seriously hinder their plans to work together for independence -- or 
even celebrate their release. 
</P>
<P>
	The first four to arrive today -- sisters Alicia and Ida Luz  
Rodriguez, Dylcia Pagan and Carmen Valentin -- remained in a transit 
lounge at the airport for hours because of a technicality that 
allows them to be together there without breaking parole. 
</P>
<P>
	A planned massive party to welcome them might turn into ``nine  
huge parties'' because of the parole conditions, spokesman Luis 
Nieves Falcon said. Probation officers might have given permission 
for them to be together, but the parole office in San Juan has been 
closed since Tuesday and the director is attending a seminar off 
the island, Falcon said. 
</P>
<P>
	The releases propelled family members into the kitchen to  
prepare long-anticipated treats not savored in two decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Pagan said after she was released Friday that she ``can't wait  
to taste bacalaitos fritos,'' fritters of the dried codfish that 
were a staple of slaves and still are much favored in Puerto Rico.

<HEADLINE> Silverbulletday Wins at Belmont </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Silverbulletday put on a show, and show bettors  
were delighted -- and relieved. 
</P>
<P>
	So sure were bettors that the 1-5 favorite would finish at least  
third in the Gazelle Handicap at Belmont Park on Saturday that out 
of the show pool of $1,014,359, $976,257 was bet on 
Silverbulletday. 
</P>
<P>
	She, of course, finished first for her 11th straight victory  
over fillies. 
</P>
<P>
	After swerving a bit at the start, Jerry Bailey took her off the  
rail to keep the 3-year-old filly out of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had no concern,'' trainer Bob Baffert said. ``Once I knew  
she broke and Jerry was still up, I was relaxed. I was worried 
about a stumble or something like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Silverbulletday took the lead with about a quarter-mile left and  
won by 1 3/4 lengths over Queen's Word. She paid $2.50 ($202,270 was 
bet on her to win), $2.20 and $2.10. There was a minus show pool of 
$180,107.52. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gazelle preceded the Man o'War, a 1 3/8-mile race on the turf  
in which Val's Prince won by 4 1/2 lengths over Single Empire. Favored 
Honored Glide finished last the seven-horse field. 
</P>
<P>
	Silverbulletday carried 124 pounds, from nine to 12 pounds more  
than any of her five rivals, and was timed in in 1:47 3-5 for her 
eighth win in nine starts this year and 14th in 16 career outings. 
The $120,000 first money from a $200,000 purse boosted her career 
bankroll to $2,821,750. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory was Silverbulletday's third since she finished  
seventh in the Belmont Stakes on June 5 in her only start against 
males. 
</P>
<P>
	Bailey said he thought the filly's problems at the start -- she  
left from the No. 1 post -- was the fact that she was not used to 
starting from a chute. At Belmont Park 1 1/8-mile races at Belmont are 
only one-turn races, and the field runs an eighth of a mile before 
getting to the main track. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was stuff back there that many horses never see, and I  
don't think she realized that she was in a race,'' Bailey said. 
``She got her mind on running, and she picked it up down the 
backside. We were three-wide on the turn, but I knew I had the best 
horse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Silverbulletday was fourth going into the turn and first coming  
out of it. Once in the lead, Bailey hand rode her home. 
</P>
<P>
	Queen's Word closed to finish second, two lengths ahead of Awful  
Smart, who was a length ahead of Gold From the West. Queen's Word, 
ridden by Pat day, paid $5.20 and $2.10, while Awful Smart returned 
$2.10. 
</P>
<P>
	Val's Prince, ridden by Jorge Chavez, took the lead from Fahris  
with about a quarter-mile to go and won the Man o'War in 2:15 3-5 
on a soft turf course. Each starter carried 126 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Val's Prince paid $11.80, $5.40 and $4.30 and earned $300,000  
from a $500,000 purse for his first win in three starts this year 
and his 11th victory in 44 career races.

<HEADLINE> Shore Confident Career Will Continue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Pauly Shore hit it big on MTV and in movies,  
then faded away. But, he says, his acting career may not be over 
yet. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just want to creep back, I have experience, and I believe in  
myself again, and I'm passionate about my work and what I'm 
doing,'' Shore says in the October issue of Spin magazine. ``And if 
I can keep thinking like that, then I'm going to be better than I 
was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not really a kid anymore at 31, Shore went from his own show on  
MTV to a string of film comedies including ``Encino Man,'' ``Jury 
Duty'' and ``In the Army Now.'' His 1997 TV series ``Pauly'' was a 
flop, ending after five episodes. 
</P>
<P>
	Trying to break out of the comic stereotype he created for  
himself, Shore auditioned for dramatic roles with directors 
including Oliver Stone, Brian de Palma and Francis Ford Coppola. 
</P>
<P>
	``They all liked me,'' Shore said. ``They just didn't give me  
the role.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shore currently is studying acting and making a comedic  
documentary called ``Spooge,'' which charts his outlandish 
encounters with subjects including Australian male strippers and 
female prison inmates.

<P>
	TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- Edward Keonjian, a University of Arizona  
electrical engineer and early leader in the field of low-power 
electronics, died Monday. He was 90. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1954, Keonjian designed the world's first solar-powered,  
pocket-sized radio transmitter. That transmitter is now displayed 
at the Smithsonian Institution's Museum of American History. 
</P>
<P>
	Keonjian, an Armenian who earned a doctorate in electrical  
engineering from the Leningrad Institute of Electrical Engineering 
in 1932, had been left for dead in a mass grave during World War 
II. He later escaped from a German slave labor camp with his wife 
and son, coming to the United States in 1947 and working for 
General Electric. 
</P>
<P>
	Keonjian ultimately had more than 100 publications and 27 U.S.  
and foreign patents to his name. 
</P>
<P>
	At Grumman Aircraft, Keonjian worked with astronaut Neil  
Armstrong as chief of failure analysis on the Apollo 11 project. He

	MADRID, Spain (AP) -- Alfredo Kraus, a Spanish opera singer who  
spurned popularity to become one of the world's great lyric tenors, 
died Friday after a long illness. He was 71. 
</P>
<P>
	Kraus fell into a severe depression and rarely performed after  
the death of his wife, Rosa, in 1977. Hospitalized for a time in 
June, the Canary Island-born tenor never revealed his illness, 
although news reports said he had pancreatic cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	He had a special elegance on stage and a beautiful softness of  
voice that won him praise in the opera world. The Grove Dictionary 
of Opera called him ``the best-liked lyric tenor of his 
generation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kraus was a frequent performer in prestigious opera houses  
around the world, including those of New York, Vienna and Berlin 
for his performances in such classics as ``Rigoletto,'' 
``Traviata,'' ``Lucia'' and ``Werther.'' He attributed his 
longevity on the opera scene to his technique, selective choice of 
repertoire and good health resulting from regular exercise.

<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Robert Musel, a journalist who covered wars,  
politics, crime and royal weddings across Europe for more than four 
decades, died Wednesday. He was 90. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's covered at least one major story in every country in  
Europe, most of those in Africa, and there were few places in the 
U.S. he hasn't been on a story,'' said United Press International, 
the company he joined as a copy boy. 
</P>
<P>
	Musel was born in New York in 1909 and joined United Press --  
which later became United Press International -- in 1927 as a copy 
boy. He remained a UPI senior editor long past normal retirement 
age. 
</P>
<P>
	Musel moved to London in 1943 as a war correspondent and  
remained there for the rest of his life. He covered the weddings of 
the present Queen Elizabeth II, her sister Princess Margaret, and 
Grace Kelly's to Prince Rainier of Monaco, as well as funerals for 
King George VI, Winston Churchill, Charles de Gaulle and the Duke 
of Windsor. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to his work as a journalist, Musel was a song  
lyricist, author of the words of the hit ``Band of Gold,'' and was 
senior European consultant of Broadcast Music Inc., an American 
performing rights society. In 1993 BMI established the Robert Musel

</P>
<P>
	After the war, he remained in the service three more years, just  
for the opportunity to fly the new jets. He became an Air Force

<HEADLINE> Crime Threatens All Africa Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALEXANDRA, South Africa (AP) -- Angolan team trainer Emanuel  
Mendes, standing at the entrance of the All Africa Games village, 
gazes beyond coils of razor wire and gun-toting security forces at 
the ramshackle homes of a black township on a nearby hillside. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were told not to go there. It's too dangerous,'' Mendes  
said as he waited with other athletes for a shuttle bus to one of 
the Games venues, spread throughout the Johannesburg area. 
</P>
<P>
	South African officials are so nervous that the estimated 5,000  
athletes competing in Africa's biggest sports event -- which 
officially opened Friday -- will fall victim to the country's crime 
wave that they have put them in what appears to be a military camp 
rather than an athlete's village. 
</P>
<P>
	The nearby township of Alexandra, where carjackings, murders and  
rapes are all too common, has been declared a no-go area. 
</P>
<P>
	``You'd be crazy to go there,'' said one of dozens of police  
officers lounging near the gate to the athletes' village. A truck 
full of soldiers wearing camouflage fatigues and bearing assault 
rifles bounced past on a dusty track. A reporter suggested he'd be 
safe with a couple of policemen along. 
</P>
<P>
	``No, you'd need a hundred of them,'' the officer said with a  
laugh. 
</P>
<P>
	An exaggeration obviously, but those who ignore warnings about  
Alexandra's dangers often become victims. Even war-hardened 
journalists are reluctant to venture to the township east of 
Johannesburg without protection or a local guide. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, there have been no reported incidents in Alexandra  
involving athletes and Games officials. 
</P>
<P>
	But in Soweto township south of Johannesburg, a Mercedes Benz  
with two information technology officials was carjacked Friday, 
Games chief executive officer Danie Malan said. Neither official 
was injured. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, police were escorting vehicles carrying athletes  
and officials. 
</P>
<P>
	The athletes' village, which accommodates 6,000 people, will be  
handed over to poor Alexandra families after the Games end on Sept. 
19. But with a population of some 500,000 people, many of them 
crammed into shanties made of cardboard and tin, the village will 
be scarcely noticeable in Alexandra. 
</P>
<P>
	The handover underscores the momentous task facing President  
Thabo Mbeki's government, which is trying to reverse decades of 
discrimination in which whites had homes and land but the black 
majority had next to nothing. 
</P>
<P>
	In the five years since apartheid ended with the nation's first  
all-race elections, 3 million people have moved into new 
government-funded homes, but 10 million still live in shacks or on 
land they neither own nor rent. 
</P>
<P>
	Local media this week expressed hopes that the athletes' village  
would somehow transform Alexandra and alleviate its crime problem. 
There was even talk of tours being organized, so outsiders could 
visit a house where Nelson Mandela lived in the 1940s, as well as 
churches dating to the early part of this century, restaurants and 
shebeens -- taverns featuring home-brewed beer. 
</P>
<P>
	But then, tourists may not want to visit a squalid township,  
where sewage runs in the streets and where the crime risk is high. 
</P>
<P>
	Among residents, little optimism is evident.  
</P>
<P>
	Sizwe Sotobe was hired to help direct cars to a parking lot  
outside the athletes' village. He will lose the job -- and his 
$9.50-a-day salary -- on Sept. 20, a day after the All Africa Games 
ends. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he figured any changes to Alexandra from the games would  
be about as short-lived.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Announces Violence Grants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With Americans increasingly concerned about  
school violence, the government Saturday awarded 54 school 
districts $106 million to put into practice plans to make 
classrooms safe. 
</P>
<P>
	Children in two of the districts -- Jonesboro, Ark., and  
Springfield, Ore. -- know firsthand the horror of random gun attacks 
in their schools. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton, who announced the grants in his weekly radio  
address, said the program comes as the nation's largest and most 
diverse student population ever starts the new school year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a time of hope and excitement for students, parents and  
teachers alike,'' he said. ``But in many communities, it's also a 
time of concern -- concern that when our children walk through the 
schoolhouse door they won't be safe from the threat of violence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the increased number of shootings in the past two years  
makes clear the need to address youth violence. The administration 
has worked for tougher gun laws and launched a grass-roots 
anti-violence campaign, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``These steps have made our schools safer, more disciplined,  
better learning environments,'' Clinton said. ``But when it comes 
to protecting our children we must do more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The grants are part of the Safe Schools/Healthy Schools  
Initiative, a joint project of the departments of Education, 
Justice and Health and Human Services to develop methods to 
identify troubled youths and prevent violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. J.C. Watts Jr., R-Okla., chairman of the House Republican  
Conference, commended Clinton ``for highlighting this important 
issue'' but disagreed with the president's renewed demand for 
stricter gun-control laws. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, Watts said he just led a tour ``to see firsthand  
what educators are doing to teach our children and make our schools 
safer.'' He said local officials pressed on him a need ``for more 
freedom and flexibility from federal regulations -- not more laws 
and new government bureaucracies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 54 communities awarded grants are among hundreds that  
applied for help in developing local programs to attack youth 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
	At Jonesboro, two pupils at Westside Middle School killed four  
others and a teacher and wounded 10 other people in March 1998. 
Jonesboro plans to offer in-home counseling for families with 
children deemed vulnerable to violent behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	A troubled 15-year-old in Springfield pulled a rifle from his  
trench coat in May 1998 and killed two students and wounded 22 
other people. Clinton said that city's grant is to build on strong 
relations that developed between its schools and law enforcement in 
the aftermath of the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the face of terrible loss, the good people of these towns  
have pulled together to protect their children,'' Clinton said. 
``They're an inspiration for all of us.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Calls U.S. Open Champ </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- President Clinton called Serena Williams to  
congratulate her on winning the U.S. Open singles title Saturday 
night, then handed the phone over to daughter Chelsea so the two 
kids could gab about everything except the boys they met at the 
malt shop. 
</P>
<P>
	With the innocence of two teen-agers making plans for the  
weekend, the two teen-agers made plans for the weekend: Chelsea, 
19, said she would show Serena, 17, around the Stanford University 
campus next week after Williams plays in the Federation Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sure, if I'm around,'' Williams said before she caught herself  
and said, ``I'm sure I'll be around.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams also quizzed Chelsea about her major. (It's history.)  
</P>
<P>
	``That's definitely a tough subject. I don't think I would be  
able to do that,'' Williams said. ``I excel in athletics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You most certainly do,'' Chelsea said.  
</P>
<P>
	Williams' conversation with the president was also disarmingly  
devoid of protocol. She frequently interrupted him, asking 
questions about the number of time zones between New York and 
Auckland, New Zealand, where the president was meeting with 
Asia-Pacific leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, whose victory was witnessed in person by former  
President Jimmy Carter, said she didn't know that Clinton was a 
tennis fan. And she was flabbergasted to learn that he was watching 
from New Zealand as she beat Martina Hingis of Switzerland 6-3, 7-6 
(7-4). 
</P>
<P>
	``So you follow tennis? I never knew,'' Williams said. ``I'm  
glad you guys were watching. I hope you guys were cheering for me. 
If not, that's OK.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the president assured her that he was, she simply said,  
``Wow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After clearing up the fact that it was 16 hours later in New  
Zealand, Williams dropped a couple more ``Wows'' and told him, ``I 
didn't really think my day could get any better. And then I hear 
that the president wants to call. Pretty stoked.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton invited Williams and her family -- her sister Venus lost  
to Hingis in the Open semifinals -- to the White House for a 
personal tour. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wow, I'm so excited,'' Williams said. ``We're definitely going  
to make a trip this year, then.''

<HEADLINE> Ramsey Grand Jury Nears 1 Year Mark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOULDER, Colo. (AP) -- Nearly a year after a grand jury began  
looking into the murder of JonBenet Ramsey, there's no indication 
it's any closer to resolution of the case, frustrating both 
residents and city leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're at the point where they either have to say they have  
something or they don't,'' said Brian Greenman, a shopkeeper who 
lives near the Boulder County Justice Center. 
</P>
<P>
	The 12-member jury, which began its work on Sept. 15, 1998, has  
heard testimony from police officers, friends and relatives of the 
Ramsey family, and technicians who examined thousands of pieces of 
forensic evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	But the panel, whose term expires next month, has not met since  
May 25. 
</P>
<P>
	Denver attorney Scott Robinson, who has followed the case, said  
jurors may be awaiting forensic test results, still following leads 
or waiting for attorneys to work out a deal for JonBenet's parents 
to testify. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman for District Attorney Alex Hunter declined  
comment, citing a state law that requires grand juries to operate 
in secret. 
</P>
<P>
	In finishing its term, the grand jury may issue indictments,  
draft a report or simply adjourn without so much as a 
recommendation. It will then be up to Hunter to decide whether to 
pursue any jury recommendation or empanel another group to start 
anew. 
</P>
<P>
	JonBenet, 6, was found beaten and strangled in the basement of  
the family's home on Dec. 26, 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	John Ramsey found his daughter's body about eight hours after  
his wife, Patsy Ramsey, told police she had discovered a ransom 
note seeking money in exchange for JonBenet's safe return. 
</P>
<P>
	Police have said the Ramseys are under suspicion, but the couple  
has repeatedly proclaimed innocence. The family left Boulder two 
years ago and moved to the Atlanta area with their 12-year-old son. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, almost three years after the slaying, the only arrests have  
resulted from evidence leaks to the news media. 
</P>
<P>
	City spokeswoman Jennifer Bray said the end of the grand jury's  
work won't come quickly enough for city officials, who believe the 
case has given Boulder a black eye. 
</P>
<P>
	Boulder residents also want some closure, Ms. Bray said.  
</P>
<P>
	``In October, the grand jury has got to end. They expect some  
resolution at that point, whether that's the ending point or not,'' 
she said.

<HEADLINE> Cheese Blintzes Recalled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Government officials are warning the public  
that cheese blintzes manufactured by a small New York company may 
be contaminated with salmonella, which can cause serious infections 
in certain people. 
</P>
<P>
	Ratner's Retail Foods decided to voluntarily recall frozen  
cheese blintzes sold in 10 states after two New Yorkers became ill 
with salmonella, the Food and Drug Administration and New York 
officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The blintzes -- cheese, blueberry-cheese and cherry-cheese -- were  
sold in 13-ounce packages in stores in California, Colorado, 
Connecticut, Florida, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New 
Jersey, New York and Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers who purchased the blintzes are urged to return them to  
the store of purchase for a refund, the FDA said. 
</P>
<P>
	Symptoms of salmonella include diarrhea, fever, abdominal pain  
and vomiting. Healthy people typically recover in a few days, but 
salmonella can cause serious, even life-threatening infections in 
young children, the elderly and people with weak immune systems. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Department of Health said anyone who purchased  
Ratner's cheese blintzes within the past six months may be at risk 
of infection.

<HEADLINE> Puerto Ricans Glad To Be Free </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Ricardo Jimenez left the federal penitentiary near Terre Haute,  
Ind., in style, riding through the gates in a gold Mercedes-Benz. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm elated that I'm free, here with my family,'' said Jimenez,  
one of 11 Puerto Rican nationalists granted clemency by President 
Clinton and freed from prison Friday amid a political furor. 
</P>
<P>
	Freed from his 75-year prison sentence, Luis Rosa, 39, lost  
scant time returning to the cause of Puerto Rican independence. He 
left the U.S. Penitentiary in Leavenworth, Kan., on Friday 
afternoon and headed home to Chicago, where he joined two other 
newly freed Puerto Rican nationalists at a rally. 
</P>
<P>
	``Freedom for Puerto Rico. Freedom for Puerto Rico,'' Rosa said,  
leading a chant as 10 relatives and supporters surrounded him. 
</P>
<P>
	And Chicago-born Edwin Cortes arrived to a hero's welcome Friday  
night in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Waving flags, singing nationalist 
songs and banging madly on leather ``pandereta'' drums, supporters 
welcomed the 44-year-old Cortes home ``as a king.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The welcome was expected to grow into a massive party today with  
the planned arrival of another eight freed prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the nationalists were members of FALN, the Puerto Rican  
independence group responsible for 130 bombings in the late 1970s 
and early 1980s that left six people dead and scores wounded. 
</P>
<P>
	They were serving sentences of up to 90 years in prisons from  
California to Connecticut on charges of seditious conspiracy and 
possession of weapons and explosives. 
</P>
<P>
	None of those offered clemency was directly responsible for  
deaths or injuries, and they were required to renounce violence and 
stay away from each other as a condition for receiving clemency. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's offer outraged law enforcement officials and victims  
of FALN violence, and complicated his wife's bid to win a Senate 
seat from New York, which has a large Puerto Rican population. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, the U.S. House condemned the clemency offer on a  
311-41 vote that was little more than symbolic, since Clinton holds 
exclusive power over clemency. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has said his offer was not intended to help his wife's  
campaign for the Senate, and that his decision was influenced by 
several leaders, including South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu 
and former President Carter. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton ended up opposing the clemency offer, saying the  
FALN members took too long to decide whether to renounce violence. 
</P>
<P>
	But Friday, she said she may have been hasty in making that  
decision. ``I have a number of Hispanic advisers and ... I have to 
admit that the consultation process was not what it should have 
been,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton offered clemency to 16 nationalists in all. U.S. Bureau  
of Prisons spokesman Dan Dunne said two had their sentences 
reduced, two had already been released and one had not signed the 
clemency offer and remained in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Dunne said all nine who said they wanted to live in Puerto Rico  
were given permission by the Federal Parole Commission. Without it, 
they would have been forced to return to the cities where they 
lived at the time of their arrests. 
</P>
<P>
	In Oklahoma City, Elizam Escobar walked through Will Rogers  
World Airport on a journey toward a new phase in his life after 
spending 19 years in an El Reno prison. 
</P>
<P>
	The 50-year-old painter and former art teacher expressed regret  
for the bombings, but said before boarding his flight that ``with 
all conflicts, there are people who get injured. 
</P>
<P>
	``As part of the independence movement, we have sustained many  
casualties over the years,'' he said. ``I don't like violence. 
Nobody likes it when people get hurt.''

<HEADLINE> Venice Honors 'King of Comedy' Film </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VENICE, Italy (AP) -- Silly, according to Jerry Lewis, is  
something that can be understood in any language. In a testament to 
this belief and to the man who personifies it, the Venice Film 
Festival on Saturday honored Lewis with a Golden Lion lifetime 
achievement award. 
</P>
<P>
	The 73-year-old Lewis, still recovering from a bout with viral  
meningitis, was recognized both as a comedian and as a filmmaker 
who has directed 11 movies, all but one starring himself. 
</P>
<P>
	European audiences and critics have long regarded Lewis as one  
of the great comic innovators and feel he is undervalued in the 
United States, where his main claim to fame now is the annual Labor 
Day telethon which has raised hundreds of millions of dollars to 
fight muscular dystrophy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jerry Lewis introduced original and explosive surreal elements  
acting as a critical comment on contemporary American society,'' 
festival director Alberto Barbera said when the award was 
announced. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis may also be undervalued as a savvy businessman.  
</P>
<P>
	In 1958, he negotiated a deal for the sales and distribution  
rights to six of films to revert to him in 30 years. Lewis has 
begun to cash in, selling the rights for remakes and getting a cut 
of the profits in the process. The remake of ``The Nutty 
Professor'' has raked in more than $270 million worldwide since its 
1996 release, according to Premiere Magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	He began directing his own films after the breakup of his  
immensely successful, 10-year partnership with the whiskey-voiced 
crooner Dean Martin, a smooth foil to Lewis' frantic, antic clown. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis, who is Jewish, made one film which was never released and  
which he refuses to discuss: ``The Day the Clown Cried.'' It is the 
tale of a clown that leads children into the gas chamber at 
Auschwitz. An Italian film, Roberto Benigni's ``Life is 
Beautiful,'' echoes the idea and was a huge success last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis praised Benigni lavishly at his news conference, calling  
him ``extraordinary and one of the best to come around for many 
years,'' but he rebuffed questions about ``The Day the Clown 
Cried.'' Lewis abandoned the project in 1972 and didn't appear in 
another movie until Martin Scorsese's dark drama ``King of Comedy'' 
in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	In tribute to Lewis, his 1960 movie, ``The Bellboy,'' was  
screened on the closing day of the festival. Lewis chose it for 
Venice because it was the first film he directed. He also wrote the 
screenplay and produced the movie.

<HEADLINE> Son of Clippers Own in Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- A fight between the son of Los  
Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling and a friend ended in 
gunfire when one youth shot the other in the legs. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott Ashley Sterling, 19, told investigators that his friend  
Phillip Scheid Jr., 19, attacked him with a knife about 12:30 a.m. 
Saturday, Beverly Hills Police Sgt. John Edmundson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sterling said he then fired the shotgun at Scheid in self  
defense, Edmundson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The mansion at North Beverly Drive where the shooting took place  
belongs to the Clippers owner, according to broadcast reports. 
Sterling was not home at the time of the shooting, Edmundson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Phone messages left at the Clippers offices were not immediately  
returned. 
</P>
<P>
	Another friend, who was not identified, drove Scheid to  
Cedars-Sinai Medical Center for treatment of ``minor wounds to his 
lower legs,'' Edmundson said, adding Scheid's wounds were not 
considered life-threatening. 
</P>
<P>
	The hospital did not release any information about the victim.  
</P>
<P>
	The cause of the shooting was still under investigation late  
Saturday. No arrests were made, Edmundson said.

<HEADLINE> Report: Doctor Wanted Wife To Die </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- A doctor was convicted of attempted  
homicide and sentenced to 6 1/2 years in jail for not telling his wife 
that she had breast cancer, Taiwanese newspapers reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Chien Chih-hung, 40, told his wife a lump he discovered on her  
breast in 1995 was harmless because he wanted her to die so he 
could marry his mistress, the China Times quoted the judge as 
saying. 
</P>
<P>
	The doctor's wife, Tang Hsiu-pin, was finally diagnosed with  
breast cancer in early 1997, too late for her to seek treatment, 
the United Daily News said. Tang, whose age was not given, is still 
alive. 
</P>
<P>
	Chien, who practiced in the central city of Chiayi, said he  
believed the lump was ``innocuous.'' He said he will appeal.

<HEADLINE> Investors Said Taken for $115M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Thousands of investors entrusted  
their money -- one man handed over $3 million -- to companies that 
promised it would be used for lucrative life insurance policies for 
the terminally ill. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, a federal indictment unsealed Friday alleges the duped  
investors turned over more than $115 million that was then used to 
support lavish lifestyles, including resort homes, luxury cars and 
helicopters. 
</P>
<P>
	As many as 6,000 people, many elderly, could be victims of what  
federal agents called one of the largest fraud schemes in recent 
memory, said Assistant U.S. Attorney Ellen Cohen. 
</P>
<P>
	A meager $6 million of the $115 million was used to buy  
legitimate policies, according to the indictment. 
</P>
<P>
	Frederick Brandau, 54, of Davie; an in-house attorney; a nurse  
and two of Brandau's companies -- Financial Federated Title &AMP; Trust 
Inc. and Asset Security Corp. -- were charged with 44 counts of wire 
and mail fraud, money laundering and conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
	The indictment, returned Aug. 13, was unsealed Friday, hours  
after federal agents arrested Brandau at Miami International 
Airport. FBI officials said Brandau was denied entry into Bogota, 
Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
	``For two years, the defendants preyed upon investors who were  
naive, unsophisticated and in many instances senior citizens who'd 
invested their life savings,'' said FBI senior supervisory agent 
Alan Sadowski. 
</P>
<P>
	Brandau's lawyer, Thomas Sclafani, did not immediately return a  
telephone message seeking comment Friday, but previously has said 
his client was not running a scam.

	Indonesia Says No Foreign Force  
</P>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Indonesian Ambassador Makarim Wibisono on  
Sunday ruled out any multinational force for East Timor for now, 
saying Indonesia's imposition of martial law was already helping 
improve the security situation in the territory. The refusal came 
after 50 ambassadors publicly aired their criticism of Indonesia 
for failing to live up to its obligations to maintain peace in East 
Timor. On Aug. 30, a majority of East Timorese approved 
independence in a U.N.-supervised referendum. Since then, 
anti-independence militias with the support of Indonesia's military 
and police have since waged a campaign of terror against the 
territory's people and U.N. staff. 

</P>

	Clinton Chides Indonesia's Military  
</P>
<P>
	AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) -- President Clinton on Sunday stepped  
up pressure on Indonesia to invite U.N. peacekeepers into

will of the people overturned by violence and intimidation.'' His 
comments came as he addressed business leaders of the largest 
Asia-Pacific region's largest companies following a fence-mending 
meeting with Chinese President Jiang Zemin. He also called on China 
and Taiwan on Sunday to resolve their differences peacefully and 
urged North Korea to halt suspected missile tests.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Serena Williams captured the U.S. Open women's  
singles championship today by beating top-ranked Martina Hingis 
6-3, 7-6 (7-4). Williams put on a spectacular display of mature 
tennis with an all-court attack to become the first black woman to 
win a Grand Slam title since Althea Gibson in 1958. Serena Williams 
is the 17-year-old younger sister of Venus, the woman Hingis beat 
two years ago on this same court to win her only U.S. Open title. 
Meanwhile, Andre Agassi beat Yevgeny Kafelnikov today and will face 
Todd Martin in the men's final tomorrow.

	Pakistan Arrests Opposition Backers  
</P>
<P>
	KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) -- Police said they arrested about 500  
activists of several opposition parties today, including former 
prime minister Benazir Bhutto's. The opposition, particularly Ms. 
Bhutto's party, says that as many as 6,000 of their workers were 
arrested. The crackdown was enforced to prevent opposition 
supporters from staging an anti-government rally in the violent 
port city of Karachi on Saturday. The opposition accuses Pakistani 
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif of massive corruption, undermining the 
constitution and usurping the rights of three smaller provinces in 
favor of his home province of Punjab, home to 60 percent of 
Pakistan's 140 million people.

<HEADLINE> Former Falcon Faces Old Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- When defensive end John Burrough found the  
small package in his locker, he quickly scooted outside the 
Minnesota Vikings' locker room. 
</P>
<P>
	Inside the box was his NFC championship ring from his old team,  
the Atlanta Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
	The only teammate who got a peek at the hardware, which features  
a diamond setting with a black Falcons logo, was long-snapper and 
newfound friend Mike Morris. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said as soon as he came here, he would let me see MY  
ring,'' Morris cracked. ``It may have a falcon on it, but it was 
supposed to be mine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Burrough spent his first four seasons with Atlanta, helping the  
Falcons reach the Super Bowl last year in their monumental upset at 
the Metrodome. 
</P>
<P>
	In February, Burrough joined the Vikings, who were searching for  
pass rushers after gathering just 24 sacks by defensive linemen in 
1998, 7 1/2 by Derrick Alexander, who left as a free agent. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Dennis Green liked Burrough's versatility and mobility,  
``and he's got a motor like John Randle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Is there any other way to play?'' Burrough said. ``That's the  
only way I know how.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Burrough happened to be at the Falcons' complex packing his gear  
this spring when the NFL released its schedule, featuring Minnesota 
at Atlanta on the opening weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``Man, it was like a rabid pack of wolves on me,'' Burrough  
recounted. 
</P>
<P>
	Burrough is the only participant from the conference  
championship who has the peculiar perspective of winning the game 
and seeking revenge for it. 
</P>
<P>
	He just sees it as ``a great test out of the gate. Atlanta's a  
great team, a team that's going to be vying to go back to the Super 
Bowl. The Minnesota Vikings, we are a great team. I think we'll be 
vying for the Super Bowl.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Burrough can't wait for his homecoming, however.  
</P>
<P>
	``I have a lot of guys on that team that are great friends of  
mine. I've gone to dinner with them, I've held their kids,'' he 
said. ``It's going to be a great experience going back and playing 
against them in what was my home for four years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One thing he's not looking forward to is any new dance steps in  
the end zone from his former teammate Jamal Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can honestly say I've never done the `Dirty Bird' and I'm  
proud of that,'' Burrough said. ``The D-line in Atlanta, we refused 
to be caught up in that and we never did. No member of the D-line 
ever did the `Dirty Bird' in Atlanta for fear of stiff fines and 
penalties.''

<HEADLINE> Bears Release Kicker Jeff Jaeger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAKE FOREST, Ill. (AP) -- Jeff Jaeger, one of only six kickers to  
connect on at least 80 percent of his field-goal attempts the past 
three years, was released by the Chicago Bears on Saturday after 
missing nearly all of training camp because of a hip injury. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bears signed kicker Brian Gowins off their practice squad.  
The former Northwestern placekicker will handle the kicking chores 
in Sunday's season opener against the Kansas City Chiefs. 
</P>
<P>
	Jaeger made 61 of 75 field goals and led the Bears in scoring  
the past three seasons. He scored 90 points last year, three times 
as many as wide receiver Bobby Engram, who was second on the team. 
</P>
<P>
	He injured his left hip in the first full week of training camp  
and missed the next three weeks. He was supposed to return for the 
Bears' final preseason game at Cleveland two weeks ago, but hurt 
the hip again before the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Gowins was 17-for-24 on field goals for Northwestern last season  
and hit all 21 extra-point attempts. He signed with the Detroit 
Lions as an undrafted free agent and connected on his only 
point-after and field-goal attempts before he was cut Aug. 17. 
</P>
<P>
	Gowins kicked a 29-yard field goal and three extra points for  
the Bears in the preseason game at Cleveland. He was cut Aug. 31, 
but re-signed to the practice squad on Sept. 6.

<HEADLINE> Big Jag Wins at Bay Meadows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN MATEO, Calif. (AP) -- Big Jag's reputation for consistency  
was taking a beating -- until Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-year-old used a powerful move in deep stretch to  
accelerate past the leaders and win Saturday's $200,000 Bay Meadows 
Breeders' Cup Sprint at Bay Meadows. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today, he showed us he's back,'' said Jose Valdiva Jr., who  
rode Big Jag to his latest victory, which was worth $110,000 to 
owner Julius H. Zolezzi. ``I got him to the outside, and he just 
came on rolling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	From August 1998 to April, Big Jag was regarded as probably the  
West's top sprinter, putting together a run that saw him win nine 
of 10 races, including three straight Grade II stakes. 
</P>
<P>
	But he hadn't been the same since returning from a three-month  
layoff, running poorly in two stakes races at Del Mar over the last 
two months before reasserting himself against a quality-laden 
six-horse field Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The last week or so, he's been training great,'' Zolezzi said.  
``And we knew he was feeling better because he started biting 
people. When he gets to nipping like that, we know he's getting 
back to being his old self.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Big Jag, registering his 11th victory in 21 career starts,  
covered the six furlongs in 1:08.87, finishing three-quarters of a 
length in front of Men's Exclusive. Favored Lexicon ran third. 
</P>
<P>
	Dixie Dot Com, racing for the first time since sustaining a  
stress fracture in the left front cannon bone while winning the 
Grade II San Fernando Breeders' Cup, finished a fast-closing 
fourth. 
</P>
<P>
	Big Jag trailed the field for most of the race before rallying  
between horses at the top of the stretch. At midstretch, with Big 
Jag still behind Lexicon and Men's Exclusive, Valdiva swung him 
outside and Big Jag zoomed to the front. 
</P>
<P>
	``This horse has always run better when you get him into the  
clear,'' Valdiva said. ``He was running well in traffic but he just 
wasn't making enough headway. I thought, `Let me give him a clear 
run and see what he's got.' It was do or die. We had to go for it, 
and he just exploded. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was happy for the horse because some people had given up on  
him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trainer Tim Pinfield said Big Jag is being pointed for the $1  
million Breeders' Cup Sprint at Gulfstream on Nov. 6. The horse 
will likely run one more time before then, either in the California 
Sprint Championship on Oct. 2 at Bay Meadows or the Ancient Title 
Handicap on Oct. 17 at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything's going according to plan now,'' said Pinfield,  
adding it took Big Jag longer than expected to get back into racing 
shape after the layoff. ``He wasn't 100 percent for his races at 
Del Mar but he improved with each one. He's rounding into top form 
at the right time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	William Morey Jr., trainer of the comebacking Dixie Dot Com,  
said the horse came out of the race well and still may run in the 
Breeders' Cup, only it probably would be a mile on the turf. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not disappointed with the race,'' he said. ``We were  
happy with the way he finished. He didn't get tired. We wanted to 
make sure he didn't get fatigued because that's when the injury 
could flare up again.''

<HEADLINE> Bayer Aspirin Pulls Plug on Cotton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Don't worry about getting that wad of cotton  
out of the aspirin bottle: It's not there anymore. 
</P>
<P>
	Without any fanfare, Bayer Corp. in Pittsburgh removed the  
cotton from its Genuine Bayer bottles early this year, ending 
forever the frustrating practice of picking it out to get at the 
tiny headache-stopping tablets. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a change in tradition that went largely unnoticed -- The  
Wall Street Journal first reported it in an article Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The practice of shoving cotton into aspirin bottles dates back  
to around 1914 or 1915, about the time Bayer began compressing 
aspirin powder into tablets, said Anne Coiley, a company 
spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not a simple decision to make, according to corporate  
officials. Before Bayer decided to tamper with a time-proven 
product, it had to test the integrity of cotton-less bottles, 
making sure the tablets would hold up without the extra packing and 
running marketing surveys to determine if it would hurt sales. 
</P>
<P>
	``We concluded there really wasn't any reason to keep the cotton  
in except tradition,'' said Chris Allen, Bayer's vice president of 
technical operations. ``It's hard to get out.''

<HEADLINE> Altered Crops New U.S. Farmer Worry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Already battered by low corn and soybean  
prices, farmers now fear the loss of overseas markets for the 
genetically altered crops that now make up a hefty percentage of 
U.S. production. 
</P>
<P>
	Europeans were the first to balk at buying biotech crops, which  
wary Britons have dubbed ``Frankenfoods.'' Now the baby-food makers 
Gerber and H.J. Heinz are turning them down, as are two Japanese 
brewers. In Mexico, a major tortilla maker is avoiding altered 
corn. 
</P>
<P>
	One U.S. processor has announced plans to pay a premium for  
conventional grain, while another company has told its suppliers to 
start separately storing conventional and biotech grain. Some 
growers and analysts fear the moves will lead to price cuts on 
biotech grain, if not this fall then next year, and a shortage of 
conventional seed next spring. 
</P>
<P>
	``Farmers are in real despair right now,'' said Nebraska farmer  
Keith Dittrich, who grows 1,300 acres of soybean, most of them 
genetically modified. ``Issues like this can just infuriate them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Half the soybeans that U.S. farmers are growing this year were  
engineered to withstand a popular weedkiller, and a third of the 
corn crop is biotech, having been altered to produce its own 
pesticide. There are also genetically modified tomatoes, melons and 
potatoes, though in much smaller amounts. 
</P>
<P>
	Biotech ingredients are all over the grocery store, in  
everything from tortilla chips to baby formula and drink mixes, 
according to a study in this month's issue of Consumer Reports. 
</P>
<P>
	For farmers, the crops mean higher yields, which are badly  
needed at a time when profit margins are thin or nonexistent. 
Dittrich figures the high-tech soybeans save him $10 an acre. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. regulators say there is no scientific evidence that the  
crops pose any danger to humans or livestock, and American 
consumers have so far indicated little concern about them. In 
Europe, however, the crops have become a symbol of globalization 
and growing American dominance in food production. 
</P>
<P>
	In Great Britain, some supermarkets are refusing to carry food  
with biotech ingredients, and activists repeatedly have destroyed 
seed test plots. The European Union's approval process for new 
hybrids has come to a virtual standstill this year, according to 
industry officials, and labeling requirements for food are under 
consideration. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no question we're more cautious than the United  
States,'' said EU spokeswoman Ella Krukoff. 
</P>
<P>
	Gerber and Heinz announced this summer they would rid their baby  
food of genetically modified ingredients, though they believe they 
are safe, and then Japanese brewers Kirin and Sapporo said they 
would switch to traditional corn. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan also is requiring labels on biotech foods, and U.S.  
farmers are signing contracts with Japanese buyers to guarantee 
them a supply of conventional soybeans. Japan is expected to 
purchase 700,000 metric tons of conventional American soybeans this 
year, twice as much as in 1998 and about 17 percent of its total 
U.S. soybean imports. 
</P>
<P>
	The anti-biotech momentum forced Archer Daniels Midland Inc. to  
announce Aug. 31 that its suppliers needed to start separating 
conventional and genetically modified crops. A day later 
Consolidated Grain and Barge Co. announced that it would start 
paying premium prices for traditional crops. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly the firestorm of controversy in Europe has spread  
around the world,'' said biotech analyst Sano Shimoda, president of 
BioScience Securities Inc. of Orinda, Calif. ``The sparks of the 
firestorm have landed in the U.S. The problem is that the 
production of major crops is a global business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers eventually could be forced to sell biotech crops at a  
discount, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Industry optimists play down the impact of the developments in  
Euope and Japan and say it is going to mean higher prices for 
farmers who grew conventional crops this year. The American Soybean 
Association expects traditional soybeans to fetch as much as 40 
cents a bushel more than the biotech variety. 
</P>
<P>
	A key question is whether the Europeans, who buy a fourth of the  
U.S. soybean crop each year, can be induced to pay more for the 
conventional variety. ``We don't want to give up that market,'' 
said Bob Callanan, a spokesman for the soybean group. 
</P>
<P>
	At best, the recent developments have introduced new uncertainty  
into the farm economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Corn Growers Association, in an informal survey of  
250 grain elevators, found few planned to heed ADM's suggestion for 
separate storage of conventional and biotech crops, primarily 
because they are not equipped to do it. At least one Illinois 
elevator is advising farmers not to plant genetically engineered 
crops at all next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Iowa farmer Ed Wiederstein, who grows both altered corn and  
soybeans, says he is not concerned about finding a place to sell 
them -- this year, at least -- but he is watching the markets. 
</P>
<P>
	``If nobody wants it, I'll definitely change. There is going to  
be a real scramble for seed if that does occur,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Announces Violence Grants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With Americans increasingly concerned about  
school violence, the government Saturday awarded 54 school 
districts $106 million to put into practice plans to make 
classrooms safe. 
</P>
<P>
	Children in two of the districts -- Jonesboro, Ark., and  
Springfield, Ore. -- know firsthand the horror of random gun attacks 
in their schools. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton, who announced the grants in his weekly radio  
address, said the program comes as the nation's largest and most 
diverse student population ever starts the new school year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a time of hope and excitement for students, parents and  
teachers alike,'' he said. ``But in many communities, it's also a 
time of concern -- concern that when our children walk through the 
schoolhouse door they won't be safe from the threat of violence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the increased number of shootings in the past two years  
makes clear the need to address youth violence. The administration 
has worked for tougher gun laws and launched a grass-roots 
anti-violence campaign, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``These steps have made our schools safer, more disciplined,  
better learning environments,'' Clinton said. ``But when it comes 
to protecting our children we must do more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The grants are part of the Safe Schools/Healthy Schools  
Initiative, a joint project of the departments of Education, 
Justice and Health and Human Services to develop methods to 
identify troubled youths and prevent violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. J.C. Watts Jr., R-Okla., chairman of the House Republican  
Conference, commended Clinton ``for highlighting this important 
issue'' but disagreed with the president's renewed demand for 
stricter gun-control laws. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, Watts said he just led a tour ``to see firsthand  
what educators are doing to teach our children and make our schools 
safer.'' He said local officials pressed on him a need ``for more 
freedom and flexibility from federal regulations -- not more laws 
and new government bureaucracies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 54 communities awarded grants are among hundreds that  
applied for help in developing local programs to attack youth 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
	At Jonesboro, two pupils at Westside Middle School killed four  
others and a teacher and wounded 10 other people in March 1998. 
Jonesboro plans to offer in-home counseling for families with 
children deemed vulnerable to violent behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	A troubled 15-year-old in Springfield pulled a rifle from his  
trench coat in May 1998 and killed two students and wounded 22 
other people. Clinton said that city's grant is to build on strong 
relations that developed between its schools and law enforcement in 
the aftermath of the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the face of terrible loss, the good people of these towns  
have pulled together to protect their children,'' Clinton said. 
``They're an inspiration for all of us.''

<HEADLINE> Class of 2000 Facing Hopes, Fears </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The Cold War was over before they were 10. They think the stock  
market goes nowhere but up. They know all about sex, but also about 
AIDS. Their schools have computers in the classroom, but metal 
detectors by the front door. They wear studs in their tongues and 
pagers on their belts. 
</P>
<P>
	They are the Class of 2000, more than 3 million young Americans  
now starting their senior year in high school, and like every 
generation of teens, they dare their parents to understand them. 
</P>
<P>
	But more than parents are watching these Y2K youth. Apart from  
their symbolic status as standard-bearers into the next millennium, 
they form the leading edge of a teen population bulge that will 
surpass even the baby boom at its peak. 
</P>
<P>
	Courted by advertisers, fretted over by politicians, the Class  
of 2000 inherits an era of prosperity but also one of alienation, 
as families grow more fractured and strange new perils surface with 
each day's news. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're out here alone as a generation,'' says Kim Blair, a  
senior at Columbine High in Littleton, Colo. One day last April, 
she watched her safe, suburban school become a killing grund, and 
she realized her class would have to learn how to take care of 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
	``In my parents' generation, they didn't have a lot of teen  
violence or gang problems,'' Blair says. ``They didn't have the Y2K 
bug; they barely had computers. I think it's hard for parents to 
keep up with the kids. We're learning so many things, so much 
quicker than they are.'' 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	By many social measures, the Class of 2000 differs little from  
any other teen generation deemed by society to be headed to hell in 
a handbasket -- which is to say every generation in recent memory, 
from pot-smoking '60s hippies (now hand-wringing parents 
themselves) to slacker Gen Xers (now running their own Internet 
companies). 
</P>
<P>
	Some comfort can be found in recent statistics:  
</P>
<P>
	Teen-age smoking and illegal drug use climbed during most of the  
'90s but appear to have stabilized or dropped slightly in the last 
few years. The teen pregnancy rate has dropped 17 percent since 
1990. The teen abortion rate has fallen 31 percent since 1986. 
Violent crime committed by teens has dropped steadily since 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Beyond the numbers, however, there's a troubling sense that the  
Class of 2000 is coming of age in a harsher, more confusing era. 
</P>
<P>
	A modern teen, it has been estimated, is exposed to more  
information in a single day than a medieval peasant was in a 
lifetime. But the flood of data hardly equals wisdom, which today's 
youth will need in balancing the curses and blessings of their 
high-tech future. 
</P>
<P>
	The easy exchange of personal information over the Internet  
carries the threat of a world without privacy. Genetic engineering, 
whether of plants, sheep, or human embryos, poses ethical 
quandaries that can only grow more acute as the Class of 2000 
matures. 
</P>
<P>
	The uncertainties are enough to make Keith Poertner, 17, sound  
almost nostalgic for the Cold War, when two superpowers stared each 
other down with the mutual threat of nuclear annihilation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, all the small countries have nukes and just anybody can  
push the button,'' says Poertner, of Traverse City, Mich. ``And 
you've got terrorists and germ warfare and everything. You never 
know where the threat's going to come from.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Today's teens are freer than ever to follow their own paths,  
beyond the reach of parents. In the '60s, when music came on black 
vinyl disks instead of silvery plastic CDs, baby boomers forged a 
generational identity with loud and annoying rock 'n' roll. Today's 
youth, by contrast, listen to all sorts of loud and annoying music: 
rap, reggae, hip-hop, punk, techno. 
</P>
<P>
	Even high-school cliques are more splintered. Jocks, nerds and  
preps still roam the corridors, but so do punks, Goths, skaters, 
stoners and gangstas. 
</P>
<P>
	It's hard for terrified parents to swallow the argument that  
Marilyn Manson's profane and violent lyrics are merely this 
generation's version of Elvis Presley's gyrating hips. But it's 
equally hard for youths to accept the suggestion that they can be 
corrupted by a pop song or video game. 
</P>
<P>
	Frank Bitetto, 17, a punk-rock drummer with a partially shaved  
head, enjoys standing out from the crowd, but he says that hardly 
makes him a menace. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure if I went out and shot somebody right now it would  
probably make the news that I listen to Marilyn Manson and Nine 
Inch Nails. But it wouldn't make the news that I have Aerosmith 
albums,'' says Bitetto, who also works at Wal-Mart and serves as 
president of his high-school drama club in Franklin, N.H. 
</P>
<P>
	The Class of 2000 is more racially diverse than any before it.  
Thirty-three percent of U.S. teens belong to minorities, compared 
to 28 percent of Americans of all ages. By the time these kids 
retire -- if such a thing is still allowed in the mid-21st century -- 
minorities will nearly add up to a majority of the U.S. population. 
</P>
<P>
	Teens increasingly face cultural conflicts, sometimes within  
their own household. 
</P>
<P>
	Kauxiong Yang, a Hmong refugee from Laos, lives in the  
Minneapolis suburb of Brooklyn Park. She flips through Vogue and 
Glamour magazines, listens to pop stars Jewel and Alanis 
Morrisette, and wears Gap jeans with the seams torn just so at the 
bottom. 
</P>
<P>
	She also happens, at 17, to be married -- common in Hmong culture  
but odd enough here that she initially kept it a secret from 
classmates after moving last year from California. She lives with 
her 22-year-old husband and his family, who expect her to be 
obedient and industrious. She yearns to be a typical American teen. 
</P>
<P>
	``I keep lying to myself to a point where I don't even know who  
I am,'' Yang says. ``The minute I step into the house, I'm 
pretending to be someone I'm not.'' 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Corporate America has tuned in to the Class of 2000, which is  
riding the front of an unprecedented teen-age wave. The 12-to-19 
age bracket has increased each year since 1992 and is expected to 
reach 35 million by 2010, an ``echo boom'' larger than the baby 
boom at its peak. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're spending a huge amount of money,'' says Michael Wood,  
vice president of Teenage Research Unlimited, a Chicago-based 
market research firm. He estimates last year's teen purchases at 
$141 billion, up 16 percent over 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike their parents, who rebelled against corporate America,  
the children proudly wear its advertising. At the moment, the 
``coolest'' brands among teens are Nike, Adidas, Tommy Hilfiger, 
Sony and Nintendo, according to surveys done by Wood's firm. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cool'' can equal big profits. Puff Daddy isn't just a rap  
musician. He's also a producer and entertainment company CEO, he's 
in publishing and fashion, and he made the cover of Forbes Magazine 
for his $53 million in earnings last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Ask teens what it takes to be considered cool, ``and the No. 1  
and 2 answers have always been good looks and being funny,'' Wood 
says. 
</P>
<P>
	But he notes one big change: ``Teens today say it's very  
difficult to be rebellious, because pretty much everything has been 
done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If mass marketers know how to bend a generation's attitudes and  
behavior, social engineers are catching on as well. Researchers 
credit renewed education efforts -- more nuanced than the ``Just Say 
No'' campaigns of the '80s -- for the recent halt in the rise of 
teen smoking and drug abuse. 
</P>
<P>
	Education can even have a tempering effect on hormones.  
Awareness of AIDS and more knowledge about contraceptives have 
helped reduce the teen-age pregnancy rate. By graduation, some 60 
percent of the Class of 2000 will have had sexual intercourse, a 
rate that researchers say appears to be declining, partly due to 
sex education encouraging abstinence. In some circles, virginity is 
cool. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think (sex) belongs inside marriage,'' says Jason  
Hartbarger, 17, a home-schooled senior in Cary, N.C., who has had a 
girlfriend for nearly two years. ``It's not something that I have 
any interest in. I think there are other ways to be serious in a 
relationship and to make things last.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While sex and drugs tend to worry parents, many teens bridle at  
what they consider adult misconceptions. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a lot of us out here who have get-up-and-go, who  
want to accomplish things,'' says Brad Lambrecht, 17, of Lisbon, 
N.D. 
</P>
<P>
	He plans to leave the family farm to pursue a career in music,  
making him one of many in the Class of 2000 with a clear vision for 
the future: 
</P>
<P>
	-- In New York City, Lakecia Benjamin, 16, practices up to four  
hours a day on her alto saxophone, playing gospel, jazz and funk at 
the Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music &AMP; Art and Performing 
Arts. Her cheeks puff up until her dimples vanish, and she looks 
off to the side, ecstatic and absorbed, as mellow notes dance in 
the air. ``I practice forever, just to get that one sound,'' she 
says. 
</P>
<P>
	-- A baseball diamond defines the universe of Jim Olds, 17, in  
Lafayette, Ind. Muscular and confident, he dreams of playing 
professional ball and fills his life with the game, rhapsodizing 
about the intensity of the face-off between batter and pitcher: 
``You just look him in the eye and you compete, he does his best, 
and whoever comes out on top comes out on top. I suppose the best 
thing about baseball is there's always tomorrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- At the private Menlo School in the Silicon Valley town of  
Atherton, Chris Niederauer, 17, has his own Web site 
(www.ccntech.com), 15 e-mail addresses and two powerful computers. 
Skinny and pale, with soft hands and blue eyes, he'd be happier if 
he could spend more than his usual 45 hours a week on the computer. 
``Nerds around here, we don't have a bad reputation,'' Neiderauer 
says. ``Lots of the jocks are trying to learn programming, so they 
turn to us for help.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One might expect a healthy geek factor in Silicon Valley, but  
high technology has transformed the Class of 2000 nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	In Gallup, N.M., Navajo student Aaron LeMaster tinkers with his  
computer and builds gadgets using parts from old VCRs. He dreams of 
starting his own electronics company, and his mother, awed by her 
son's technical knowledge, doesn't doubt his potential. 
</P>
<P>
	``He learned it all on his own, just by taking things apart,''  
says Lenora LeMaster. ``He's very self-driven.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About two-thirds of the Class of 2000 will attend college next  
fall. Their economic outlook is excellent, with the playing field 
more level than ever for young women, who now outnumber males in 
college enrollment. 
</P>
<P>
	But the outlook is darker for those who don't pursue higher  
education, and darker still for the 4 percent of high schoolers who 
drop out before graduation. Experts predict a widening gulf between 
haves and have-nots in America's increasingly information-based 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Poertner, in Traverse City, hopes to graduate next spring but  
admits that his record of cutting classes means he'll have to 
``work my patootie off.'' His mom is a housewife. His dad is a 
diesel mechanic who digs graves for extra money. Lanky, goateed 
Poertner hasn't made any plans for himself. 
</P>
<P>
	``They say by the end of next year I'm supposed to decide what  
the heck I'm supposed to do with the rest of my life,'' he says. 
``Well, I just don't care to. Nothing's really popped up in my 
face.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For others, even those with few advantages, the American Dream  
still glimmers. 
</P>
<P>
	Oswaldo Mendoza, 17, born in Mexico City, now lives with his  
family in Reno, Nev. He works after school as a busboy at a casino, 
saving his minimum-wage pay for college. ``That's why we came to 
the United States -- to get a better way of life for me and my 
brother and sister,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	Angela Ford attends a Chattanooga, Tenn., school founded in 1865  
to educate former slaves. Most students live in nearby public 
housing. Administrators battle poor attendance and a high dropout 
rate with inspirational posters about ``Great Expectations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ford takes those posters to heart. A striking young woman with  
almond eyes, she has never met her father but says she doesn't feel 
deprived, nurtured instead by her mother, grandmother and aunts. 
With a near-perfect 3.95 GPA, she plans to pursue college degrees 
in electrical engineering and business. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like I can do this,'' Ford says. ``My mother gave me a  
lot of educational guidance. She made it fun. She said hard work 
would pay off later.'' 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	The headlines often serve up polarized views of the Class of  
2000, casting its members either as savvy denizens of the dot.com 
decade or as victims adrift in a cultural sea of sex and violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Spend time with these teens, however, and you discover a new  
generation with old-fashioned concerns: friends, romance, money 
and, above all, family. 
</P>
<P>
	``All teen-agers need at least one adult in their life who  
really cares about them,'' says Laurence Steinberg, a psychology 
professor at Temple University and author of ``You and Your 
Adolescent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yet the traditional family is becoming less common, with 28  
percent of children under 18 now living with just one parent, 
according to census figures. 
</P>
<P>
	Not that having both parents under the same roof guarantees good  
parenting. Steinberg says studies suggest that about 30 percent of 
parents, from drug-addicted dads in the slums to dual-career 
professional couples, have ``checked out'' of their teens' lives. 
</P>
<P>
	``They don't know who their kids' friends are,'' Steinberg says.  
``They don't know what their kids are doing after school. They may 
live in the same house, but they have no meaningful relationship 
with their kids.'' 
</P>
<P>
	How important is family? Ask Tyler Ray, 18.  
</P>
<P>
	He attends Chattanooga's private McCallie School, an elite  
Christian school for boys that counts Ted Turner and Pat Robertson 
among its alumni. A three-year letterman in tennis and president of 
the school's National Honor Society, Ray got perfect 800s on his 
SATs and has spent part of his last three summers building houses 
for the poor in Ecuador and Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet even a young man of purpose and privilege cannot escape the  
hardships of his era. Ray was depressed for months after his 
parents divorced three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I went through a period where I thought that I could do it, I  
could get them back together,'' he says. ``I was praying every 
night to God to give me the strength to get them back together. 
When I realized I wasn't going to be able to do that, I completely 
quit praying. I didn't want to talk to God for two or three 
months.'' 
</P>
<P>
	How important is family? Ask Brad Lambrecht, the North Dakota  
farm boy who wants to be a musician. 
</P>
<P>
	He says his father would love it if he stayed on the farm, which  
has been in the family for five generations. They've talked about 
it for hours and hours, and Lambrecht knows it won't be easy to 
leave. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet he will leave, he's sure of that now, and he'll go knowing  
his parents are proud of him. Like his Y2K classmates across 
America, Lambrecht stands somewhat uncertainly at the edge of 
adulthood, eager for freedom but still reaching, if ever so 
quietly, for the familiar security of home. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got the greatest parents I could ask for,'' Lambrecht  
says. ``But don't ever tell them that.''

<HEADLINE>  Whoa, Nellie! Keith Jackson's Back </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) -- Keith Jackson, whose booming voice was a  
signature of ABC-TV's college football coverage until his 
retirement last year, returned to the booth Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Some eight months after quitting, the 70-year-old broadcaster  
did play-by-play for the network's regional telecast of the 
California-Nebraska game with longtime partner Bob Griese. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel just like a rookie today,'' Jackson said two hours  
before kickoff. ``I had no thought of doing this again. I was 
turned off. We were going a totally different direction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson, in his 33rd year with ABC, was talked into returning by  
ABC Sports president Howard Katz. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson, who turns 71 in October, said his contract is for three  
years ``or as long as I want, I guess.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel good and healthy,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	With the exception of Saturday's game, Jackson will do only West  
Coast Pac-10 games to minimize travel from his Los Angeles home. 
</P>
<P>
	He did the California-Nebraska game because he had planned to be  
in Lincoln for the dedication of Nebraska's new $36 million press 
box and luxury skybox. 
</P>
<P>
	The pressbox was named after Jackson's longtime friend Don  
Bryant, who retired as Nebraska's sports information director in 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant had a hand in naming the bathroom in the television  
portion of press box ``The Keith Jackson Toilet Facility,'' which 
drew recurring chuckles from Griese. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every stop we made last year, they'd bring him all these gifts  
because he was retiring -- they didn't bring me a damn thing,'' 
Griese said. ``And now he gets a bathroom named after him for 
coming out of retirement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the record, Jackson claimed that he never has uttered the  
phrase ``Whoa, Nellie!'' during a broadcast. He said the phrase, 
often attributed to him, was originated by comedians doing 
impersonations of him. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just got tagged onto me,'' Jackson said. ``There's nobody  
in our family named Nellie, I'll guarantee ya.''

<HEADLINE> Abalone Poaching Ring Smashed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBION, Calif. (AP) -- State game wardens, capping a six-month  
undercover probe of abalone poaching, arrested 16 people and seized 
$10,000 in cash in dawn raids along the foggy Mendocino coast and 
in the San Francisco area. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators said Friday the arrests targeted a poaching ring  
that sold abalone on the black market for $60 each, or more. 
</P>
<P>
	Two divers, their pouches stuffed with abalone taken just  
minutes before, were arrested after they changed from their wet 
suits and were returning to a car parked in a field along the sheer 
cliffs overlooking Dark Gulch inlet, just south of the scenic 
Heritage House complex. 
</P>
<P>
	They were accused of conspiracy and possession, and each faces  
up to five years in prison and $40,000 in fines. 
</P>
<P>
	The raids by Fish and Game Department agents followed months of  
round-the-clock surveillance on the suspects' homes in San 
Francisco and Oakland and along isolated coastal nooks. The 
investigation was prompted by an anonymous tip to a state hotline. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators say the poached abalone was sold to individuals,  
restaurants and wholesale fish dealers in the San Francisco Bay 
area. The shellfish, a delight to seafood fanciers, sold for about 
$40 apiece to illicit wholesalers and up to $60 apiece or more on 
the street. 
</P>
<P>
	To protect California's dwindling abalone population, especially  
along the craggy, majestic North Coast where the valued ``reds'' 
are found, the state has banned commercial abalone fishing. The 
last open commercial zone was closed two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	It's legal to dive for abalone from April through June and  
August through November, but the limit is four per day.

<HEADLINE> Girl Scouts Move Beyond Suburbs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOLLISTER, Calif. (AP) -- While migrant workers pick garlic and  
peppers in the fields of the Southside Labor Camp, their young 
daughters' giggling voices can be heard rising from a small park 
nearby. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yo me esforzare a ser honrada y justa, cordial y servicial,  
considerada y compasiva. ...'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Girl Scout promise.  
</P>
<P>
	The Girl Scouts have been promoting wholesome American girlhood  
for nearly a century. In recent years, the group has pushed beyond 
America's suburbs and small towns into nontraditional communities -- 
homeless shelters, gatherings of jail inmates' children and the 
fields of migrant camps like Southside. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole purpose ... is to provide the benefits of Girl  
Scouts to an audience that would not normally have access to 
them,'' Girl Scouts of the U.S.A. spokeswoman Lori Arguelles said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two hours each week, the girls of Southside, about 90 miles  
southeast of San Francisco, gather at the park to play games, sing 
and work on civic projects for badges to sew into their Girl Scout 
uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
	As the girls began straggling into the camp park on a recent  
sweltering afternoon, past the trees that double as kickball bases, 
they giggled and shoved each other. The youngest wore used Brownie 
shirts and jumpers, the oldest were in jeans and borrowed T-shirts 
stamped with the Girl Scout logo. 
</P>
<P>
	They'll meet there through November, when Southside closes and  
the families scatter to harvest or plant crops from Arizona to 
Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	In some cases, the girls will pick up where they left off in  
their new states, singing and playing with another group of friends 
in another Girl Scout chapter. 
</P>
<P>
	It's all part of what the Girl Scouts call the Border  
Initiative, an effort to target Hispanic and migrant girls and keep 
the continuity of scouting even when their families move from job 
to job. 
</P>
<P>
	About 10,000 girls have participated in the program since it  
began three years ago. Scout leaders don't ask their status, though 
officials acknowledge some may be in the United States illegally. 
</P>
<P>
	Yuma, Ariz., program manager Sylvia Martinez-Flores said the  
Girl Scouts are starting to draw more parents into the program as 
well. Recently, the Yuma group teamed up with Chicanos Por La 
Causa, which teaches the girls' parents to read while they work 
with their children on Girl Scout projects. 
</P>
<P>
	The Girl Scouts' membership has grown from 2.41 million in 1989  
to 2.67 million in 1998. During that period, Hispanic membership 
has risen from 3.9 percent to 5.7 percent, and officials credit 
much of the increase to the Border Initiative. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just looking at demographic and immigration patterns,  
increasing numbers of girls are coming from new immigrant 
communities,'' said Marsha Johnson-Evans, Girl Scouts national 
executive director in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	In migrant communities like Southside, persuading parents to  
enroll their children in Girl Scout troops can be one of the 
biggest hurdles for Scout leaders. Unlike the Boy Scouts, Girl 
Scouts does not exist in Mexico, and many rural Mexican parents 
have never heard of it. 
</P>
<P>
	And for some parents, the notion of active girls who play sports  
and go on camp-outs simply doesn't square with their traditional 
image of docile, protected, stay-at-home girlhood. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our parents' obligation was to put a roof over our heads and  
give us clothes and food. It was not up to them to entertain us,'' 
said Linda Valenzuela, membership director for the Imperial Valley 
Girl Scouts near San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	For many parents, the program is changing their thinking about  
American clubs like the Scouts. Some say they wish they had had the 
chance to be Girl Scouts when they were children. 
</P>
<P>
	``I see my daughter and I think it would have been neat,'' said  
Maria Franco, 42, a longtime Southside worker. ``For us, it was 
always work, work, work in the summer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's real cool,'' said Melissa de la Cruz, 11, whose family  
splits its time between California and Arizona. ``They teach you 
stuff you don't know, like macrame. We made anklets and

<HEADLINE> Pitt-Penn State Rivals After All </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STATE COLLEGE, Pa. (AP) -- Maybe Pitt-Penn State is a rivalry  
after all. 
</P>
<P>
	Pittsburgh, 34-point underdogs, gave No. 2 Penn State a scare on  
Saturday for the second straight year. Travis Forney kicked a 
tiebreaking 24-yard field goal with 1:20 left and LaVar Arrington 
blocked a 52-yard field goal with 4 seconds remaining to preserve a 
20-17 victory for the Nittany Lions. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they didn't make a statement that this is a rivalry,''  
Arrington said, ``then I don't know what a rivalry is. It was too 
close, but we still came through.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Penn State coach Joe Paterno was glad to see his team tested  
after two blowouts. 
</P>
<P>
	``We knew a game like this would come for us because things have  
come so easy for us,'' he said. ``You've got to be able to win a 
game like this if you've got aspirations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eric McCoo had a 7-yard TD run and Mike Cerimele caught an  
11-yard TD pass for Penn State (3-0), which visits No. 8 Miami next 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Penn State started the winning drive on its own 16-yard line.  
Kevin Thompson's 51-yard pass to Eddie Drummond put Penn State on 
Pitt's 11, setting up Forney's go-ahead field goal. 
</P>
<P>
	Hank Poteat ran the kickoff to the 50 and John Turman hit Latef  
Grim for a 25-yard gain, but David Fleischhauer sacked Turman and 
Nick Lotz's field goal attempt was blocked by Arrington. 
</P>
<P>
	``I should have thrown it away,'' Turman said of the sack on  
third down. ``It's tough, but the whole team showed a spark. Now we 
know we can play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pittsburgh (1-1) lost to Penn State for the seventh straight  
time, but thanks to great defensive line play, stuck with the Lions 
for the second year in a row. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was an old-fashioned bar fight out in the back alley,''  
Cerimele said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Penn State narrowly beat their long-standing rival  
20-13, but that didn't lead the two schools to sign a new contract. 
The 107-year-old series has turned lopsided over the past decade, 
prompting debate about whether it should continue. 
</P>
<P>
	Their last scheduled meeting is next September.  
</P>
<P>
	Penn State had just 65 yards rushing and Kevin Thompson threw  
two interceptions, first to defensive end Bryan Knight, then to 
defensive tackle Nigel Neal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Doggone it, look at the pound-per-man size comparison,'' said  
coach Walt Harris, whose starting linemen gave up 29 pounds a man 
to Penn State's offensive line. ``Our guys played their butts 
off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Turman was 19-of-35 for 316 yards and threw two touchdowns,  
including a 42-yarder to Julius Dixon to make it 17-17 with 4:34 
left. 
</P>
<P>
	On that drive, Turman had three passes nearly picked off. Two of  
them bounced off Arrington's hands, and Latef Grim snared the 
second pass and took it 45 yards. The TD pass went through 
cornerback David Macklin's hands. 
</P>
<P>
	McCoo's touchdown run put Penn State ahead 17-10 with 14:15  
left. The big play on the 78-yard drive was Eddie Drummond's 
37-yard gain on Thompson's screen pass. 
</P>
<P>
	On Pittsburgh's next series, Arrington picked off a pass and  
returned it to the 8-yard line, but Neal intercepted Thompson's 
pass over the middle and Penn State came away empty-handed. 
</P>
<P>
	Pittsburgh trailed 10-7 at the half, but tied the game with 5:55  
left in the third on Lotz's 35-yard field goal. Knight set it up 
with his interception at the Penn State's 17. 
</P>
<P>
	Pittsburgh held the Lions to 22 yards rushing. Penn State,  
usually content to stay on the ground, passed early and often. 
Thompson was 17-of-29 for 232 yards and Casey 4-of-5 for 88 yards 
as Penn State outgained Pittsburgh 385 yards to 373. 
</P>
<P>
	Casey led the Lions to their only first-half TD, finding  
Cerimele for the score one play after he scrambled to his left and 
hit Tony Stewart for a 47-yard gain. 
</P>
<P>
	Turman led Pittsburgh right back with a 16-yard TD pass to  
Antonio Bryant. Forney's 43-yard field goal gave the Lions the 10-7 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Arrington drew two personal foul penalties on one play in the  
second quarter, hitting punter Greg DeBolt, then laying on top of 
him. After the first flag, he jumped up and, with referees in his 
face, shoved DeBolt a second time. 
</P>
<P>
	DeBolt, who wrestles at 185, said he gave Arrington what  
wrestlers call the ``low single,'' a shot to the shins with his 
shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were Big East officials. Maybe that's why,'' Arrington  
said of the flags. 
</P>
<P>
	The display didn't seem to upset Paterno, either, who left  
Arrington in the game after calmly discussing the incident with 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't have to nitpick all of the time. He should have  
walked away, but it was a good lesson for him,'' Paterno snapped. 
</P>
<P>
	Courtney Brown broke Penn State's record with his 46th and 47th  
career tackles for losses. 
</P>
<P>
	Grim caught eight passes for 127 yards for Pitt.

<HEADLINE> Agassi, Martin in All-U.S. Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Andre Agassi took aim at Yevgeny Kafelnikov's  
weak backhand as if throwing darts at a bull's eye to reach his 
third straight Grand Slam final at the U.S. Open, an all-American 
affair against a rejuvenated Todd Martin. 
</P>
<P>
	Bouncing back from a wild start, Agassi exploited Kafelnikov's  
backhand with brutal shots to that side, wearing him down and 
breaking his spirit on the way to a 1-6, 6-3, 6-3, 6-3 victory 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Agassi, winner of the French Open and runner-up at Wimbledon  
this summer, regained the No. 1 ranking as he advanced to the title 
match against Martin, the new No. 4 after a 6-4, 6-1, 6-2 romp over 
Cedric Pioline. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm so happy for Todd, the way he's been playing,'' said  
Agassi, who won the U.S. Open in 1994 and is seeking a fifth major 
title. ``It's good to see another American in the final. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a great year for me, and I'm hoping to make it a  
little bit better tomorrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The all American final will be only the fifth here in the Open  
era, which began in 1968, and the first since Pete Sampras beat 
Michael Chang in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Agassi and Martin are both 29 and have known each other since  
rising through the junior ranks. Agassi holds a 9-5 advantage in 
their pro matches. Though virtual opposites in personality, the 
flamboyant Agassi and the scholarly Martin speak of the tremendous 
respect they have for each other. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet, Agassi knows he's better off playing Martin than another  
final against Sampras, who beat him at Wimbledon two months ago and 
in the U.S. Open finals in 1990 and 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a little bit easier going to sleep thinking about Todd  
Martin than Pete,'' Agassi said. ``But you still have a job to do. 
... My state of mind is very much on the business at hand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Agassi came out a little too pumped up against Kafelnikov,  
trying to dictate play with deep groundstrokes but more often 
clubbing shots long and wide while the Russian played well enough 
to take advantage. Kafelnikov won 12 of 13 points in one stretch, 
from 2-1 to 5-1, in that set and put it away in just 21 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	But just as he did in the French final after a slow start,  
Agassi raised the level of his game as he mercilessly went after 
Kafelnikov's backhand. The shot of the match was not one 
spectacular point but a series of overpowering backhands crosscourt 
by Agassi that Kafelnikov sprayed outside the lines or into the net 
with his two-handed backhand. 
</P>
<P>
	Agassi also began holding serve easily, dropping only two points  
in his first three service games of the second set. He got the 
break he needed at 3-1 when Kafelnikov netted a backhand, and he 
set the pattern for the rest of the match. 
</P>
<P>
	``I played to his backhand because I was a half-step behind,''  
Kafelnikov said. ``He was dictating play. I never had time to 
prepare for my shot to go up the line. I had to create something. 
But it wasn't there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kafelnikov said that in earlier matches, he had ``tons of time''  
to prepare for his shots. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today, I never had the time,'' he said. ``I admire when he's  
really on top of his game, the power he presents to other players 
from the baseline. That's what makes him so special.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Agassi broke him three times in the second set, each of those  
games ending with a backhand error by Kafelnikov. After that, 
Kafelnikov never posed a threat. 
</P>
<P>
	Seeded No. 7, Martin will be ranked a career-high No. 4 after  
the tournament, a huge comeback from 1997 when elbow and shin 
injuries caused him to miss nearly seven months and he sank as low 
as No. 82. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were a few moments that I wondered if I'd play again,  
and a lot of moments where I definitely questioned whether I would 
be able to play the way I liked to play,'' Martin said. ``Those 
thoughts stuck with me for another six months to a year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Runner-up to Sampras at the 1994 Australian Open, Martin will be  
playing in only his second Grand Slam final. 
</P>
<P>
	``It feels great, but it doesn't necessarily feel better than  
the first time,'' said Martin. ``I don't feel I'm as good an 
athlete, mainly because of my health. I'm relying more on other 
attributes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It'll be a great challenge for me. There's nothing I'd rather  
do than play in a Grand Slam final against one of the world's best 
players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martin's overall game is more polished than five years ago, a  
more thoughtful blend of groundstrokes, net attacks and 
chip-and-charge returns. Even more significant, perhaps, is the way 
Martin has learned to handle tight situations in matches and to get 
the most out of his body when he's feeling depleted. 
</P>
<P>
	He showed those characteristics even in defeat two months ago in  
a gutsy, inspired Davis Cup match against Patrick Rafter. And 
Martin showed the same determination to persevere in several 
matches this tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin's path to the final was a bumpy one, though he had  
several strokes of luck. He played grueling five-setters in the 
first round against a qualifier, and in the fourth round against 
No. 9 Greg Rusedski. 
</P>
<P>
	But Martin had to play only one set in the third round before  
Magnus Larsson quit with an injury. And he avoided possible 
confrontations with Sampras in the quarters and with Rafter in the 
semis because of their injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin didn't have to work too hard against Pioline, who looked  
flat just two days after an exhausting victory over No. 5 Gustavo 
Kuerten that included three long tiebreakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin could rely on his serve -- he had 14 aces -- and a nice  
blend of groundstrokes and volleys to beat the error-prone and 
weary Pioline in just 96 minutes.

<HEADLINE> Bengals Give Pickens $23M Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Receiver Carl Pickens signed a five-year  
contract extension Saturday, two days after he dropped his vow 
never to play for the Cincinnati Bengals again. 
</P>
<P>
	The five-year deal would pay Pickens $23.25 million, making him  
one of the highest-paid receivers in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	The contract signing capped a strange week for Pickens and the  
Bengals, who were at an impasse since the end of last season. The 
Bengals designated Pickens as their franchise player, but he held 
out and demanded a trade, saying he wanted to go to another team. 
</P>
<P>
	Pickens, the team's career receiving leader, came to Cincinnati  
and met with general manager Mike Brown on Thursday. They reached 
agreement on a one-year deal, began discussing a long-term contract 
and signed the new deal Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	In only two days, Pickens went from holding out to signing on as  
part of the franchise's future. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's bizarre,'' his agent, Steve Zucker said. ``This is the  
strangest I can remember.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bengals added Pickens to their roster Saturday, a day before  
their season opener in Tennessee. It was unclear whether Pickens 
would play against the Titans. 
</P>
<P>
	Offensive tackle Mike Doughty went on injured reserve with a  
sprained foot to clear a roster spot for Pickens. Receiver James 
Hundon took Doughty's spot on the inactive list for Sunday's game. 
</P>
<P>
	Pickens, 29, signed a one-year deal for $3.5 million on  
Thursday. His new contract replaces that one and runs through 2003. 
</P>
<P>
	Pickens will receive salaries of $8 million this season, $3  
million in 2000, $3.5 million in 2001, $4.3 million in 2002 and 
$4.45 million in 2003. The Bengals had plenty of room under the 
salary cap this year, allowing them to pay Pickens so much in the 
first year of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Zucker said that when he and Pickens arrived in Cincinnati to  
meet Brown on Thursday, the team significantly sweetened its offer. 
</P>
<P>
	``From the initial offer, I've never seen a negotiation go so  
fast so far in such a short time,'' Zucker said.

<HEADLINE> Lott: Major Tax Cut Will Wait </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A major tax cut will likely have to wait until  
Americans return a Republican Congress and a GOP president to the 
nation's capital in the 2000 elections, Senate Majority Leader 
Trent Lott said today. 
</P>
<P>
	In the weekly Republican radio address, Lott said he expects  
President Clinton to seek a deal on a smaller tax cut and more 
spending after the president vetoes the 10-year, $792 billion tax 
relief package passed in August by Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans, Lott said, should resist that temptation.  
</P>
<P>
	``He'll agree to some throw-away tax fixes in return for a  
massive hike in spending for all his pet projects,'' said Lott, 
R-Miss. ``It would be impolite to call that blackmail, but we've 
been through this routine before, and we know where it ends up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``That's why it looks as if real tax relief will have to wait  
until a Republican president can join your Republican Congress in 
enacting it into law,'' Lott added. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, a limited tax measure Congress must pass this year could  
provide a last-ditch opportunity for compromise tax relief. 
</P>
<P>
	The must-pass measure -- called the ``extenders'' package on  
Capitol Hill -- would renew several already-expired tax credits 
favored by business, including a research and development credit 
popular with high-tech companies and manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP leaders say it is highly unlikely Congress will pass a  
second major tax cut bill this year after Clinton's veto, expected 
as early as next week. But they unanimously support extension of 
the business credits, as do most Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	``The extenders are something that we're going to have to work  
on,'' said House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill. ``That's nuts and 
bolts stuff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Over 10 years, the doomed $792 billion bill would reduce all  
income tax rates by 1 percentage point, ease the marriage penalty 
on many two-income couples, eliminate estate taxes and the 
alternative minimum income tax, reduce capital gains taxes, expand 
pension and 401(k) laws and provide numerous business tax breaks. 
</P>
<P>
	It also would renew the business credits, which Congress extends  
only a year or so at a time in part to ensure there will be an 
annual engine to drive the tax debate. The credits, which expired 
June 30, include those that encourage businesses to hire former 
welfare recipients and exempt certain foreign finance operations 
from taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	The question is whether that modest package will move alone in  
this congressional session's final weeks or if other, broader tax 
cuts might be attached. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Republicans want to capitalize on what they insist is a  
shift in public opinion toward tax relief caused by their August 
publicity campaign. But they don't want a dark-of-night deal with 
Clinton and the Democrats that trades tax cuts for sharp government 
spending increases. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope we will be able to work with the president,'' said Sen.  
Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas. ``I believe, in the end, we will 
have a tax cut.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats, meanwhile, are talking more about a tax cut  
compromise now that GOP leaders have declared the issue all but 
dead for this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Before leaving for an economic conference in New Zealand,  
Clinton said his ``door is open'' to tax negotiations and that 
failure to try would indicate the GOP always intended to use taxes 
as a 2000 campaign issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whether there is a bill, of course, is up to them,'' the  
president said. ``They can control what bills come up. But if 
they're saying, well, 'It's our way or no way,' then that is 
evidence that this has been pretty much about politics all along.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer, R-Texas,  
said the tax bill is not merely a political document and he wants 
to see ``as much tax relief as possible for the American people'' 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	But even if Republicans do negotiate with the president, Archer  
said it will be difficult to resolve philosophical differences on 
tax relief. The GOP, he said, wants to cut income taxes for people 
who pay them -- middle- and upper-class taxpayers -- while Clinton 
favors a variety of credits geared toward working classes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to see tax relief go to the people who pay the taxes,''  
Archer said in an interview. ``They want tax relief targeted to 
people who aren't paying income taxes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, the White House has argued that the $792 billion tax  
cut's benefits were unfairly divided, with 60 percent going to 
people in the top 10 percent income brackets. But Republicans, 
noting that some 48 million lower-earning Americans paid no income 
taxes last year, say actual taxpayers deserve a break. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration contends that roughly $250 billion of the GOP  
bill fits Clinton's goal of tax relief for the middle class, 
providing a chance for compromise if spending and Medicare reform 
are also addressed. 
</P>
<P>
	``It sounds to us like they're giving up too early,'' Office of  
Management and Budget Director Jack Lew said Friday of the GOP. 
``We're not ready to quit in terms of putting a package together.''

<HEADLINE> Goodman Turns Down Maryland Offer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLLEGE PARK, Md. (AP) -- Tamir Goodman, the high school student  
whose basketball prowess won him an oral commitment for a 
basketball scholarship at the University of Maryland in his junior 
year, turned down the offer, newspapers reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The (Baltimore) Sun said Goodman, an Orthodox Jew, cited  
friction with the Maryland coaching staff over his refusal to play 
on the Jewish Sabbath. Goodman met Sept. 2 with Maryland coach Gary 
Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was very discouraging,'' Goodman, 17, told The Sun. ``It  
would have been better off if they would have said in January `we 
would love to have you as a player, but I'm not sure the Sabbath 
can be worked out.' I would have said `thank you' and moved on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If it comes to playing basketball or the Sabbath, I'm going to  
go with the Sabbath,'' Goodman said. ``It's not even close. I'm 
never going to change my mind. Maybe they thought I'd change my 
mind once I got there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NCAA rules prohibit college coaches from commenting on  
prospective student-athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodman's mother, Chava, who accompanied her son to the meeting  
with Williams and assistant coach Billy Hahn, said the coaches 
warned Goodman that he might have difficulty earning playing time 
at Maryland because he would be available only six days a week. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel they're punishing him because he's religious,'' Chava  
Goodman told The Sun. ``Based on what Gary told me in the meeting, 
if he does not play or practice on the Sabbath, he will sit on the 
bench. He makes Tamir not being at practice equal to another kid 
who doesn't show up. I said to him, `Tamir has been religious from 
the beginning. He hasn't changed.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The Washington Post cited sources at Maryland as saying that the  
university intended to keep its scholarship commitment and was 
prepared to sign Goodman during the early signing period in 
November for 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-3, 159-pound Goodman averaged 35.4 points a game last  
year for the Talmudical Academy, a Jewish day school near Baltimore 
that has an enrollment of only 72 students. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodman transferred to Takoma Academy, a Seventh-day Adventist  
school in Takoma Park, for his senior year. 
</P>
<P>
	An unidentified friend of Williams told The Post that the  
Maryland coaching staff was concerned about Goodman's play during 
the summer, but ``didn't have a problem'' with accommodating his 
religious practices. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodman and his mother told The Sun that the coaches expressed  
dismay over his play this summer, and suggested that he consider 
attending a smaller college. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodman was hampered by a minor knee injury this summer and  
didn't play up to expectations in two major camps. He has played 
only once since Aug. 3. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was hurt,'' Goodman told the Sun in an interview from  
Queens, N.Y. ``I couldn't move my leg. Instead of saying `it's 
admirable for the kid to play,' people were saying `he can't face 
up to the competition.' There were so many things going on, I don't 
know if anybody could play to the level they were capable of if 
they had to deal with all the stuff I was dealing with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't live up to the goals I set for myself. Instead of  
going out and having fun, basketball felt like a job for the first 
time,'' Goodman said.

<HEADLINE> Sound System Alarms Opera Purists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Purists say a new sound system at the New York  
State Theater threatens to turn every performance of the New York 
City Opera into a tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you put in microphones, you're altering the basic premise  
of someone who buys a ticket to hear voices such as God and the 
voice teacher made them,'' said Rudolph Rauch, editor of Opera News 
magazine. ``Pretending that this important principle is not being 
violated is immoral.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The theater's new Dutch-designed sound system -- with two dozen  
microphones around the stage and orchestra and more than 100 
speakers tucked away in walls and under balconies -- makes its debut 
tonight at the season-opening performance of Puccini's ``Madama 
Butterfly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The change places the New York City Opera among the first major  
American musical companies to boldly cross the line between art and 
technology. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at the 2,700-seat auditorium say the system is  
necessary because the 35-year-old State Theater was originally 
designed for ballet performances, which require stage acoustics 
that muffle the noise of feet. But that also deadens voices, 
forcing young opera singers to struggle to be heard well. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not an amplification system -- it's an enhancement  
system!'' insists Susan Woelzl, a spokeswoman for the theater, 
which also is home to the New York City Ballet. 
</P>
<P>
	In a music industry filled with electronic processors and  
megawatts, the natural, unamplified human voice is still sacred in 
opera. Few who once heard Leontyne Price's pianissimo high notes in 
``Aida'' float up to the cheapest seats of the Metropolitan Opera 
will forget the unearthly beauty, unenhanced. 
</P>
<P>
	Lincoln Center chairman Beverly Sills became a star soprano at  
the New York State Theater and was later City Opera's general 
director. 
</P>
<P>
	She hopes the new system is ``temporary,'' telling The New York  
Times: ``I would not like it to become a way of life.'' Instead, 
she says, the theater's acoustics should eventually be improved 
through structural changes inside the hall. 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast, across the plaza at the rival Met, the acoustics  
naturally highlight the singing. On the other hand, ballet slippers 
can make a loud pitter-patter on that stage. 
</P>
<P>
	The State Theater realized that it would cost tens of millions  
of dollars to revamp the hall to improve the acoustics, while the 
sound enhancement runs only hundreds of thousands. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of theaters around the world have quietly gone for  
``sound enhancement,'' including the Brooklyn Academy of Music, 
where critics have offered no negative reviews of the technology. 
The system also is used at the Houston Grand Opera and the German 
State Opera in Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
	``Natural acoustics are the best experience available to  
listeners. That's our goal,'' says Scott Pfeiffer, one of the 
acoustical consultants overseeing installation of the system. ``But 
we can't make the State Theater into the Met.''

<HEADLINE> Hakkinen Wins Pole for Italian GP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONZA, Italy (AP) -- Defending world champion Mika Hakkinen  
outpaced his top rivals in Saturday's qualifying for the Italian 
Grand Prix, setting a lap record of 157.463 mph and making a strong 
bid for his fifth season victory. 
</P>
<P>
	The 30-year-old Finn clinched his 11th season pole in a  
McLaren-Mercedes, leaving his closest championship contender, 
Ferrari's Eddie Irvine, 1.33 seconds behind. 
</P>
<P>
	Hakkinen edged Heinz-Harald Frentzen's Jordan by 0.494 seconds  
to earn a front row start in Sunday's race, the 13th in the World 
Championship series. 
</P>
<P>
	Hakkinen is seeking his first-ever victory in the Italian GP to  
gain crucial points for back-to-back championship titles. 
</P>
<P>
	Britain's David Coulthard, Hakkinen's teammate, finished third  
ahead of Italian Alex Zanardi, who had his best qualifying session 
this year by finishing fourth in his Winfield Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	Coulthard trailed Hakkinen by 0.745. Zanardi, a former Indy  
champion, had a gap of one second flat. 
</P>
<P>
	Ralf Schumacher, the fastest driver in Friday's free practice,  
placed fifth, in another Winfield Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a bad day for home team Ferrari, as Finland's Mika Salo  
finished sixth and Britain's Eddie Irvine eighth. Irvine was also 
preceded by Brazilian Rubens Barrichello, the Stewart-Ford driver 
who will replace him at Ferrari next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Ferrari is without its No. 1 driver, two-time world champion  
Michael Schumacher, sidelined with a broken leg from a crash at the 
British Grand Prix in July. He also is expected to miss the 
European GP at Nurburgring, Germany, on Sept. 26. 
</P>
<P>
	Hakkinen, who enters Sunday's race with a one-point edge over  
Irvine in the championship standings, turned his fastest lap in 1 
minute, 22.432 seconds at the 3.585-mile Monza circuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Hakkinen's best lap was 0.468 seconds faster than the previous  
record set in 1997 qualifying by Jean Alesi, in a Benetton. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was a little bit surprised that I was able to bang out that  
time,'' Hakkinen said. ``The development of aerodynamics and engine 
helped me to beat Alesi's record.'' 
</P>
<P>
	```It's really a good and most enjoyable day for me,'' added  
Hakkinen, who clinched his sixth consecutive pole and equaled 
Michael Schumacher's career total of 21. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can look toward the race with confidence. I have no real  
worries, although the Monza start is always a bit tricky.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hakkinen is seeking his fifth season victory at Monza.  
</P>
<P>
	Asked about Irvine, his top pursuer who trailed him by 1.3  
seconds in qualifying, Hakkinen said, ``Eddie is far behind in the 
starting grid but you never know what can happen in the race. 
</P>
<P>
	``I often made the podium starting from behind, thus I'll have  
to keep my eyes open.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Our car is not improving ... and we look out of contention for  
victory in Monza. I should hope for McLaren's bad luck to keep my 
title hopes alive,'' Irvine said. 
</P>
<P>
	Coulthard blamed yellow flags, signaling drivers to slow down,  
for his failed efforts to beat his teammate and Frentzen. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mika was really fast, but I still could have a good start  
(from the second row) in the race and have quick pit stops,'' said 
Coulthard, who trails Hakkinen by 14 points in the world standings. 
</P>
<P>
	Coulthard, who beat Hakkinen in the previous Grand Prix in  
Belgium and won at Monza in 1997, said Friday he still could catch 
the Finn in the remaining four championship races. 
</P>
<P>
	Frentzen, winner of the French GP, said braking problems and  
traffic in the final qualifying minutes ruined his attempts for the 
pole. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have high hopes for the race,'' the German said.

<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- Cobi Jones scored with five minutes to  
play Saturday night and the Los Angeles Galaxy solidified their 
lead in the MLS Western Conference with a 1-0 victory over the 
second-place Chicago Fire. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones took Clint Mathis' pass, sprinted past Chicago's defense,  
eluded goalkeeper Zack Thornton's slide tackle and took a shot that 
deflected off Fire midfielder Jesse Marsch and into the net for his 
sixth goal of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	In a matchup of the league's two best defensive teams, Galaxy  
goalkeeper Kevin Hartman made four saves for his ninth shutout of 
the season, tying Dallas' Matt Jordan for the league lead. Thornton 
made five saves. 
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles led 15-13 in shots and 6-4 in shots on goal.  
</P>
<P>
	The victory was Los Angeles' third straight, seventh in last  
eight matches, and improved its record to 18-9. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago fell to 15-12 after its three-match winning streak  
ended. 
</P>
<P>
	The Galaxy has 48 points, while Chicago had 43, tied with  
Colorado for second place.

<HEADLINE> Shore Confident Career Will Continue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Pauly Shore hit it big on MTV and in movies,  
then faded away. But, he says, his acting career may not be over 
yet. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just want to creep back, I have experience, and I believe in  
myself again, and I'm passionate about my work and what I'm 
doing,'' Shore says in the October issue of Spin magazine. ``And if 
I can keep thinking like that, then I'm going to be better than I 
was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not really a kid anymore at 31, Shore went from his own show on  
MTV to a string of film comedies including ``Encino Man,'' ``Jury 
Duty'' and ``In the Army Now.'' His 1997 TV series ``Pauly'' was a 
flop, ending after five episodes. 
</P>
<P>
	Trying to break out of the comic stereotype he created for  
himself, Shore auditioned for dramatic roles with directors 
including Oliver Stone, Brian de Palma and Francis Ford Coppola. 
</P>
<P>
	``They all liked me,'' Shore said. ``They just didn't give me  
the role.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shore currently is studying acting and making a comedic  
documentary called ``Spooge,'' which charts his outlandish 
encounters with subjects including Australian male strippers and 
female prison inmates.

<HEADLINE> Martin's a Step Away From Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- He didn't have to play Pete Sampras or Patrick  
Rafter. His third-round opponent withdrew after one set. Saturday's 
semifinal against Cedric Pioline was a breeze. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, it wouldn't be entirely accurate to say Todd Martin had  
an easy path to the U.S. Open finals. 
</P>
<P>
	The 29-year-old American beat Pioline 6-4, 6-1, 6-2 in the  
semifinals, taking just 96 minutes to earn the chance to play Andre 
Agassi, who beat Yevgeny Kafelnikov 1-6, 6-3, 6-3, 6-3 later in the 
day. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a rare cakewalk for Martin, who had taken five sets and  
three tiebreakers to get past qualifier Stephane Huet in the first 
round. 
</P>
<P>
	``As much as anything, it gives me some confidence. I played a  
very solid three sets of tennis,'' he said. ``I'm certainly not 
going to suffer from having less court time today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Suffering is something Martin knows a little bit about.  
</P>
<P>
	He was so weakened by dehydration during a Davis Cup match  
against Australian Lleyton Hewitt this summer that he lost 10 of 
the last 11 games to drop their opening singles match. 
</P>
<P>
	Warming up for reverse singles against Rafter on another  
broiling day, Martin felt weak and tried to withdraw; when a doctor 
wouldn't OK it, Martin blew a two-set lead to lose the match. He 
needed intravenous fluids again after coming back from a two-set 
deficit to beat Greg Rusedski in the fourth round on Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	And that's just this year.  
</P>
<P>
	Other Martin collapses -- both literal and figurative -- include  
fainting from the heat on the steps of the U.S. Capitol during the 
1997 Davis Cup draw. There was also a loss to MaliVai Washington in 
the 1996 Wimbledon semifinals despite serving for the match with a 
5-1 lead in the fifth set. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think, if I do my job right, I learn and better myself from  
every match,'' he said. ``Those two matches (in the Davis Cup) 
certainly were opportunities for me to learn some things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for Wimbledon, ``I won't tell you that I don't think about it  
once in a while. I think about a lot of matches; that's one of 
them,'' he said. ``But most of my memories are good from the '96 
Wimbledon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He'll have even better memories from this year's U.S. Open --  
only the second time he has reached the finals of a Grand Slam 
event. Sampras beat him in straight sets to win the 1994 Australian 
Open. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin caught a bit of a break when Sampras and Rafter -- winners  
of six U.S. Open titles between them, including the last four -- 
withdrew from the tournament because of injuries. Both would have 
been in Martin's path to the finals. 
</P>
<P>
	But don't expect any sympathy from Martin. He's had more than  
his share of injuries, including elbow surgery that sidelined him 
for most of 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were a few moments that I wondered if I'd play again,  
and a lot of moments where I definitely questioned whether I would 
be able to play the way I like to play,'' he said. ``Those thoughts 
stuck with me for another six months to a year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martin and Pioline struggled to six deuces in their first game  
before Martin won it. He broke Pioline in the fourth game of the 
match, but lost his serve in the ninth to put the opening set back 
on serve. Martin came right back and broke to win the first set 
6-4. 
</P>
<P>
	``I squeaked through a tough first game. From there, I think I  
started to get a little bit of a rhythm,'' Martin said. ``And I 
think he lost his.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The next two sets posed no such drama. After making 11 unforced  
errors in the first set, he made only 10 in the next two and took 
only 54 minutes more to finish off the Frenchman. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he's about to play that way tomorrow,'' Pioline said, ``I  
think he has a good chance to win.''

<HEADLINE> New Black Church Pastor Praised </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- After having their last leader go to prison  
for using his position to steal millions of dollars, the nation's 
largest black religious denomination says it is headed for a 
change. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're in the ministry you damn sure better be honest,''  
said the Rev. Archie LeMone. And honesty is what the Rev. William 
Shaw, the new leader of the National Baptist Convention U.S.A., is 
known for, LeMone and others said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shaw, a former president of the Pennsylvania State Baptist  
Convention, beat a field of nine candidates at Thursday's vote in 
Tampa, Fla., to succeed the Rev. Henry J. Lyons, who is now 
imprisoned. Shaw ran on a campaign with the acronym VISA: vision, 
integrity, structure and accountability. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who know him say it was a campaign fitting for a man who  
made it a mission to implement a centralized accounting and 
budgeting system when he was president of the Pennsylvania 
convention from 1978-84 and executive director of the federal 
Opportunities Industrialization Center. 
</P>
<P>
	``The National Convention right now needs fiscal  
effectiveness,'' LeMone said. ``He handled millions of dollars for 
the federal government, and he was not audited one time; all the 
books were clean. If you want to know where your money is, and how 
it's spent, you better get William J. Shaw.'' 
</P>
<P>
	LeMone, now associate director of the National Council of  
Churches in Washington, D.C., served under Shaw from 1962 to 1966, 
when LeMone was associate pastor at Philadelphia's White Rock 
Baptist Church. Shaw, 65, has been White Rock's pastor for 43 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	It also could be a refreshing change for the  
three-million-member organization still recovering from the scandal 
of Lyons, the folksy eloquent preacher and pastor of a St. 
Petersburg, Fla., congregation who resigned as president in March. 
He subsequently pleaded guilty to federal tax evasion and fraud 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Not known for glad-handing or backslapping, Shaw is praised more  
for his intellect and commitment for change. 
</P>
<P>
	As a president and board member of the council in the mid-1990s,  
Shaw worked tirelessly for reform, including bringing greater 
inclusion among the different denominational and racial groups, 
said the Rev. C. Edward Geiger, executive director of the 
Metropolitan Christian Council of Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	``He does not speak without thinking, and when he speaks, he has  
something to say,'' Geiger said. ``He is clearly committed to 
strategies and efforts to change the church.''

	U.S. Help Offered in E. Timor  
</P>
<P>
	AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) -- President Clinton on Sunday offered  
a limited U.S. presence in violence-torn East Timor to support a 
peacekeeping mission in the violence-torn territory. ``No final 
decision are made nor could they be until I've had extensive 
congressional consultations,'' Clinton said following a speech to 
Asia-Pacific business leaders. East Timor deteriorated into chaos 
after 75 percent of the territory's residents voted for 
independence from Indonesia in a U.N.-supervised referendum on Aug. 
30. Anti-independence militias with the active support of 
Indonesia's military and police have since waged a campaign of 
terror against the territory's people and U.N. staff. 

</P>
<P>
	E. Timor Dominates Trade Summit  
</P>
<P>
	AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) -- Nobel laureate Jose Ramos Horta  
appealed Saturday for urgent action to prevent mass slaughter and 
starvation in his homeland of East Timor. Tens of thousands more 
East Timorese could die unless a peacekeeping force and 
humanitarian aid are sent to the region, said Horta, in Auckland, 
New Zealand, where the annual meeting of Asia-Pacific Economic 
Cooperation forum is being held. But Indonesia's U.N. ambassador 
ruled out any international force for East Timor, saying that 
Indonesia's imposition of martial law was improving security in the 
territory.

	German Party Faces Test in Election

<P>
	BERLIN (AP) -- Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder faced a new tough  
test Sunday in the eastern state of Thuringia, a week after a 
stinging defeat for his party in two state elections. Polls showed 
the chancellor's Social Democrats losing ground in the state, 
putting the conservative Christian Democrats within reach of a 
majority that would allow them to end their alliance with the 
Social Democrats there and govern alone. Schroeder's center-left 
coalition lost its safe majority in the upper house last February 
when the Social Democrats lost the Hesse state government.

	End to Afghanistan Aid Sought

<P>
	KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) -- A United Nations representative warned  
today that Afghanistan's war and human rights violations will 
continue unless outside military aid is stopped. Kamal Hossein, 
U.N. Special Rapporteur on Human Rights, said in the Afghan capital 
that the situation for the thousands who have been displaced by the 
fighting was desperate. The ruling Taliban has said Iran, Russia 
and some Central Asian countries have been financing its 
northern-based opponents and sending them military supplies. The 
anti-Taliban opposition, meanwhile, has accused Pakistan of sending 
military aid, as well as soldiers, to help the Taliban.

	JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) -- A Coast Guard helicopter hoisted five  
tourists and their pilot off a glacier today after they spent part

reported. The ordeal began yesterday when a sightseeing chopper 
with five tourists was forced down by bad weather. Two rescue 
choppers also were forced to land. A Coast Guard team eventually 
made it to the site, but couldn't immediately evacuate the tourists 
because of bad weather.

Chinese restaurant, Hong Kong newspapers reported today. About 100 
customers were in the restaurant on Friday when several men, 
believed to be debt-collectors, released the snakes and some 
grasshoppers from two bags, the papers said. Police had to call a 
snake handler, who rounded up 28 nonpoisonous snakes.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- President Clinton called Serena Williams to  
congratulate her on winning the U.S. Open singles title tonight. 
Williams' conversation with the president was arrestingly devoid of 
protocol. The 17-year-old frequently interrupted him, asking 
questions about the number of time zones between New York and 
Auckland, New Zealand, where the president was meeting with 
Asia-Pacific leaders. Williams was flabbergasted to learn that he 
was watching from New Zealand as she beat Martina Hingis of 
Switzerland 6-3, 7-6 (7-4).

	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Doug Jones recorded his 300th save  
with help from defensive replacement Jason McDonald and the Oakland 
Athletics kept pace in the AL wild-card race tonight with a 5-4 
victory over the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. Matt Stairs and Jason Giambi 
hit two-run doubles as Oakland remained three games behind Boston, 
which beat New York 11-10. The Athletics have won three straight 
for the first time since sweeping Toronto on Aug. 13-15.

<HEADLINE> Forbes Attacks Clemency Offer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) -- President Clinton's release of Puerto  
Rican nationalists from prison was a ``terrorists-for-votes deal'' 
to help his wife win a Senate seat, Republican Steve Forbes said 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP presidential contender said the clemency was part of a  
``pattern of abuse and arrogant disregard for the rule of law'' by 
the Clinton administration, and challenged Vice President Al Gore 
to say where he stands on it. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other Republicans campaigning in New Hampshire, Gary Bauer  
was endorsed by leaders of the state's Right to Life anti-abortion 
group, and Arizona Sen. John McCain signed copies of his new 
memoirs, ``Faith of My Fathers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some law enforcement officials and Republicans say Clinton  
offered the clemency to 16 pro-independence militants to help his 
wife in her expected Senate race in New York, home to 1.3 million 
Puerto Ricans. 
</P>
<P>
	But Hillary Rodham Clinton angered some Puerto Rican activists  
by saying she opposed her husband's offer. She and the president 
said they did not discuss the matter beforehand. 
</P>
<P>
	The prisoners, convicted of sedition and illegal possession of  
weapons, were part of a movement responsible for bombings that 
killed six people and maimed dozens in the 1970s and 1980s. Eleven 
left prison Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	None was directly responsible for deaths or injuries, officials  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes tried to use the matter to put Gore on the spot in the  
vice president's campaign for the Democratic presidential 
nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	``Where does Vice President Gore stand on President Clinton's  
terrorists-for-votes deal?'' Forbes asked.

<HEADLINE> Waco Copes With Renewed Furor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WACO, Texas (AP) -- Penny Jacko says she no longer admits to  
being from Waco, the focus of world attention during a 1993 federal 
raid on the rural headquarters of an obscure religious sect known 
as Branch Davidians. 
</P>
<P>
	``People were always asking: `Did you know David Koresh?''' Ms.  
Jacko says. ``I just hate that people know of Waco because of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Local officials are aware of the plight of people like Ms.  
Jacko, and are trying to erase a possibly-indelible stain on the 
image of their history-rich city, once known as the ``Athens of 
Texas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Built at the site of an ancient Indian village near the  
confluence of two major rivers, Waco became a major agricultural 
and trade center and the home of Baylor University. 
</P>
<P>
	There's more to the city of 109,000 than the bloody standoff  
that has resulted in embarrassment for the FBI and a massive 
lawsuit set for trial next month. 
</P>
<P>
	And city spokesman Larry Holze is trying to get the message out.  
Holze is meeting with city and business leaders to develop a 
strategy for dealing with the attention. 
</P>
<P>
	``The most important thing for us to recognize is that this  
whole thing could've happened anywhere,'' he says. ``It's just like 
those events in Jasper, Littleton and Oklahoma City.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Former Mayor Bob Sheehy says: ``You can't change what happened.  
All you can do is offer help and information. Some of the media are 
going to write ugly things about you. They did us. But if you stay 
the course, they'll probably say some nice things about you before 
they leave.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1993, residents have had to endure unending questions  
about the FBI assault on the Davidians' Mount Carmel, wisecracks 
about the ``wackos in Waco,'' and countless tourist requests for 
directions to the site northeast of the city limits where Koresh 
and about 80 of his followers died. 
</P>
<P>
	The attention is now likely to intensify with the independent  
investigation by former Sen. John Danforth and the start next month 
of a multimillion-dollar wrongful-death trial blaming the 
government. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously it's difficult for the citizens of Waco because this  
is reopening the wound,'' Holze says. ``It's like a wound that has 
healed over, but opens up every time you flex a muscle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For a few years after towering orange flames consumed the  
Davidians' home, Waco reported a downturn in business and 
conventions. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Kelly, a Baylor University economics professor, says he  
believes the notoriety helped the city at least as much as it might 
have hurt it. He says economic development officials kind of ``used 
it as an ice breaker.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Just because people have heard of Waco, it is positive for the  
community,'' Kelly said.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Leader To Avoid Fights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) -- Despite longtime bitterness over  
nuclear issues and new tensions over lamb exports, New Zealand's 
prime minister is looking to avoid any fights with President 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, who meets Prime Minister Jenny Shipley today, is only  
the second U.S. president ever to visit New Zealand, following a 
1966 trip by Lyndon Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	His visit -- to attend a summit of Asian-Pacific leaders -- comes  
amid a slow process of trying to improve the two countries' 
relations, which fell apart in 1985 when New Zealand barred all 
nuclear-armed or -powered ships from entering its waters. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the two countries are locked in a trade dispute after  
Washington imposed steep tariff on New Zealand lamb imports to 
protect local producers. 
</P>
<P>
	Shipley said her talks with Clinton over the lamb dispute would  
be limited to ``an expression of disappointment.'' She also said 
she expects no resolution of their differences over New Zealand's 
ban on U.S. warships. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will be discussing issues of mutual interest, like  
environmental matters and ... trade liberalization,'' Shipley said. 
</P>
<P>
	One reason for backing away from trouble spots: Shipley's  
conservative government is falling in polls ahead of November 
elections. Hobnobbing with Clinton and other world leaders at the 
summit could boost her support. 
</P>
<P>
	After the 1985 ban -- part of a massively popular anti-nuclear  
policy -- the United States downgraded its diplomatic, political and 
military contacts with New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
	The key defense alliance of Australia, New Zealand and the  
United States, which had begun in 1952, splintered. 
</P>
<P>
	Relations between the United States and New Zealand have begun  
to improve recently, helped by New Zealand sending support ships 
during the Gulf War, and diplomatic support for NATO in the Kosovo 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Shipley also visited the White House early this year.  
</P>
<P>
	But that was before the new trade dispute.  
</P>
<P>
	After the United States imposed its tariffs on lamb, Shipley's  
government complained to the World Trade Organization, demanding 
the tariff be lifted. Lamb exporters in New Zealand -- where sheep 
outnumber humans 12 to 1 -- said the tariffs would cost them $12 
million over three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Since coming to power 20 months ago, Shipley has not tried to  
lift the ban on nuclear-armed or -powered ships, even though her 
government is far more conservative than the leftist one that began 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	The policy simply remains too popular among New Zealanders.

<HEADLINE> Guard Praised by Police Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- An armored car guard proclaimed a hero after  
he helped drag wounded police officers to safety during a 1997 
shootout was behind bars Saturday for allegedly helping rob his own 
truck of $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``He went from a hero to a zero,'' police Lt. Otis Dobine said  
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	David Campbell, 36, was driving an armored Transport truck  
hijacked by two gunmen on Sept. 3 in suburban Van Nuys. The thieves 
tied up Campbell and another guard and fled with $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Campbell, however, ``was part of the plan,'' Dobine said.  
</P>
<P>
	The five-year veteran guard came under investigation because of  
discrepancies in his account and because he violated company safety 
policies by allowing the two gunmen into the bullet-resistant 
truck, Dobine said. 
</P>
<P>
	Campbell and another guard were praised by authorities after a  
1997 gun battle in North Hollywood between two heavily armed 
robbers and police. Ten officers and four other people were 
wounded. The gunmen were fatally shot. 
</P>
<P>
	The guards moved their armored truck into the gun battle zone,  
helped move civilians and wounded officers to safety, and drove 
SWAT officers to the scene. 
</P>
<P>
	Campbell was among six arrested in the recent holdup. A seventh  
suspect was at large.

<HEADLINE> Ramirez Out After Pitch Hits Him </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Manny Ramirez, leading the majors with 144 RBIs,  
was forced to leave Cleveland's game in the first inning Saturday 
night after being hit in the right knee by a pitch from Chicago's 
Jim Parque. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramirez sustained a bruise, and his status was day-to-day.  
</P>
<P>
	Ramirez, batting .337 with 39 home runs, bent over at the waist  
for a couple of minutes after being hit. He walked gingerly off the 
field with a trainer and manager Mike Hargrove. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the 12th time this season Ramirez has been hit by a  
pitch. 
</P>
<P>
	Ray Durham of the White Sox was hit by Dave Burba leading off  
the bottom of the first, and plate umpire Ted Barrett warned both 
dugouts against further trouble.

<HEADLINE> Bradley Sees March 'Takeoff Point' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JOHNSTON, Iowa (AP) -- Former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley  
predicted his bid for the Democratic presidential nomination will 
experience a ``takeoff point'' during a heavy round of primaries 
March 7. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think that I'd be in this race if I couldn't see my  
way through to 270, the number of electoral votes you need to win 
the presidency, which also means I can see my way through to 
getting the nomination,'' Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore has the backing of much of the Democratic  
establishment and leads in many early polls, but Bradley, in Iowa 
for a television appearance, professed not to be worried. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have to do better than expected in Iowa. I then have to do  
well in New Hampshire,'' said Bradley. ``Then the takeoff point is 
March 7, when 50 percent of the delegates will be selected.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On that day, giant states like California and New York, as well  
as much of New England and big Midwestern states like Ohio hold 
primaries. And Bradley predicted success in several. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to win a number of places on March 7,'' said Bradley.  
</P>
<P>
	Bradley noted his home state of Missouri votes that day. Also,  
he represented New Jersey in the Senate for 18 years and was a 
basketball star in New York before that, which give him high name 
recognition in the Northeast. 
</P>
<P>
	His description of the region: ``My media market for 30 years.''  
</P>
<P>
	Although he is not talking about it, Bradley also is seeking  
voters tired of the scandals that have dogged President Clinton, 
problems that spill over to Gore in what has been described as 
``Clinton fatigue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's a delicate issue for Bradley, because direct attacks on  
Clinton could backfire with many party regulars. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no calculation to take advantage of how people may or  
may not feel about the president,'' said Bradley. ``This is an 
attempt to turn the page and move on to a new time in our 
politics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley conceded he faces long odds in seeking to deny the  
nomination to a sitting vice president. ``I'm up against 
establishment power,'' said Bradley. ``I'm up against tremendous 
resources.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He rejected suggestions that history was running against him  
because sitting vice presidents who want their party's nomination 
almost always have been chosen. 
</P>
<P>
	``The point is, historical analogies are basically irrelevant  
here one way or the other,'' said Bradley. ``Every election is new. 
Every election is shaped by the dynamics of that time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Success in early primaries will move pragmatists to his  
campaign, Bradley argued. 
</P>
<P>
	``You find that a lot of congressman who are in swing districts  
are at this moment becoming a little concerned because of the 
negatives the vice president has,'' Bradley said after the TV 
taping. ``Success in the early primaries can ameliorate what seems 
now to be a disadvantage.''

<HEADLINE> EU Confronts Tax Tussle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TURKU, Finland (AP) -- European Union finance ministers today  
followed up a buoyant assessment of the bloc's economic prospects 
with tough negotiations on how to shut down tax loopholes. 
</P>
<P>
	On the second day of their meeting in this Baltic Sea port,  
British Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown set out to defend 
London's lucrative international bond market against plans for a 
new EU-wide tax. 
</P>
<P>
	Britain fears that a proposal supported by most other EU nations  
for a 20 percent tax on interest from savings will hit the Eurobond 
market -- worth some $3 trillion a year -- which is mostly based in 
London. 
</P>
<P>
	On the eve of the meeting, Brown sent his fellow ministers a  
plan designed to spare Eurobonds from the new tax, which other 
nations say is necessary for stopping cross-border tax evasion 
within the 15-nation bloc. 
</P>
<P>
	Although details of Brown's proposals were not released, first  
reaction from ministers suggested the debate would be complicated. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not a serious basis for discussion,'' Austrian Finance  
Minister Rudolf Edlinger told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Chances of agreement in Turku were almost nil, but the ministers  
were aiming to wrap up a tax deal by a December summit in Helsinki. 
The intensified tax debate reflects the drive for greater economic 
coordination between the EU nations since 11 of them launched the 
euro as their shared currency on Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	The tax spat dampened the generally upbeat mood caused by signs  
of an economic upturn and the euro's summer recovery from its 
steady decline against the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	``The assessment is good,'' said Spanish Finance Minister  
Rodrigo Rato. ``Most countries that were delaying their recovery, 
like Germany and Italy, now have good data.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ahead of the meeting, European Central Bank Governor Wim  
Duisenberg said growth in the euro-zone nations would likely 
surpass forecasts of 2 percent this year and 2.5 percent in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``In 2000, it seems we'll have more growth than the Americans,''  
said EU Finance Commissioner Yves-Thibault de Silguy. ``There's 
more reason for optimism now than we've seen for a long time in 
Europe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	De Silguy said EU governments were pledged to using revenues  
generated from the stronger-than-expected growth to cut taxes and 
reduce budget deficits rather than increasing public spending. 
</P>
<P>
	Also today, de Silguy presented the ministers an estimate for  
the cost of reconstructing Kosovo: around $2.12 billion next year 
to rebuild homes and the shattered economy. 
</P>
<P>
	He told reporters the EU had already earmarked $530 million for  
Kosovo in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	International donors are scheduled to meet next month at EU  
headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, to discuss Kosovo's 
reconstruction.

<HEADLINE> Bengals Give Pickens $23M Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Receiver Carl Pickens signed a five-year  
contract extension Saturday, two days after he dropped his vow 
never to play for the Cincinnati Bengals again. 
</P>
<P>
	The five-year deal would pay Pickens $23.25 million, making him  
one of the highest-paid receivers in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	The contract signing capped a strange week for Pickens and the  
Bengals, who were at an impasse since the end of last season. The 
Bengals designated Pickens as their franchise player, but he held 
out and demanded a trade, saying he wanted to go to another team. 
</P>
<P>
	Pickens, the team's career receiving leader, came to Cincinnati  
and met with general manager Mike Brown on Thursday. They reached 
agreement on a one-year deal, began discussing a long-term contract 
and signed the new deal Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	In only two days, Pickens went from holding out to signing on as  
part of the franchise's future. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's bizarre,'' his agent, Steve Zucker said. ``This is the  
strangest I can remember.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bengals added Pickens to their roster Saturday, a day before  
their season opener in Tennessee. It was unclear whether Pickens 
would play against the Titans. 
</P>
<P>
	Offensive tackle Mike Doughty went on injured reserve with a  
sprained foot to clear a roster spot for Pickens. Receiver James 
Hundon took Doughty's spot on the inactive list for Sunday's game. 
</P>
<P>
	Pickens, 29, signed a one-year deal for $3.5 million on  
Thursday. His new contract replaces that one and runs through 2003. 
</P>
<P>
	Pickens will receive salaries of $8 million this season, $3  
million in 2000, $3.5 million in 2001, $4.3 million in 2002 and 
$4.45 million in 2003. The Bengals had plenty of room under the 
salary cap this year, allowing them to pay Pickens so much in the 
first year of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Zucker said that when he and Pickens arrived in Cincinnati to  
meet Brown on Thursday, the team significantly sweetened its offer. 
</P>
<P>
	``From the initial offer, I've never seen a negotiation go so  
fast so far in such a short time,'' Zucker said.

<HEADLINE> Ohio State May Have Violated Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Ohio State's football program may have  
violated NCAA rules because a player's image appears on a bank 
check, The Columbus Dispatch reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Starting running back Michael Wiley's image is printed on a new  
check issued by Huntington National Bank, said Mark Krumel, a 
graphic designer with Columbus-based Rickabaugh Graphics. 
</P>
<P>
	Krumel said he was asked to blur the photos and alter the  
picture of Wiley. On the check, Wiley's No. 5 was replaced with a 
zero to make the image appear generic, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A commercial entity is not permitted to use a student athlete's  
name or picture to endorse a product or service, said Athena 
Yiamouyiannis, NCAA director of membership services. 
</P>
<P>
	An athlete and university usually can clear themselves in such  
cases if neither had knowledge of the photo's use. But if Ohio 
State provided the photograph, the university ``would definitely 
need to report it to the NCAA as a rules violation,'' Yiamouyiannis 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	She did not indicate what the penalties could be for the use of  
Wiley's image. 
</P>
<P>
	Maria Koob, director of advertising for Huntington, said Ohio  
State provided the photo, but she did not know whether the photo 
was of Wiley. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Smith, Ohio State's associate athletics director, did not  
say the photograph was of Wiley, but said the university sent all 
the images to the Big Ten Conference office before allowing 
Huntington to use them. 
</P>
<P>
	``All this was approved by the Big Ten office,'' Smith said.  
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear whether Wiley was aware his image was used on the  
Huntington checks, the newspaper said. He could not be reached for 
comment on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	A similar incident happened in June 1983, when former Ohio State  
quarterback Mike Tomczak appeared in a Lazarus print ad. The 
university declared him ineligible, but the NCAA reinstated him a 
month later because Tomczak donated the $40 modeling fee to 
charity. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ohio State men's basketball team, including a large photo of  
guard Scoonie Penn, appears on the cover of the Ameritech Yellow 
Pages. Smith said the cover was approved by the Big Ten and the 
NCAA, which demonstrates that there are gray areas in rules 
regarding player promotion. 
</P>
<P>
	Huntington started on Friday what it calls Buckeye Banking -- a  
checking account that includes pictures of Ohio State sports 
figures on its checks and debit cards. 
</P>
<P>
	Huntington's checks feature four photographic images: the  
marching band's Script Ohio formation and action shots from 
football, men's basketball and women's basketball. There is an OSU 
logo on the checkbook cover, and the debit card features a picture 
of a former Ohio State running back in action.

<HEADLINE> Weather Hampers NYC Mosquito Battle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- After being hampered by bad weather, helicopters  
and planes were expected to fly today to spray insecticide in the 
city's continued battle against an outbreak of encephalitis. 
</P>
<P>
	The mosquito-borne disease has left three people dead and six  
others with confirmed infections. Health officials have identified 
62 other possible cases of the St. Louis strain. 
</P>
<P>
	No new cases have been confirmed in New York City over the past  
two days, but health officials on Long Island and in Westchester 
County have reported several possible cases and are awaiting test 
results. 
</P>
<P>
	Sections of Brooklyn, Queens, the East Bronx, Staten Island and  
northern Manhattan have been targeted for spraying today. Rain and 
fog grounded an airplane and two of three helicopters scheduled to 
spray on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The planes and helicopters will be coming Saturday and will be  
ready to go up Saturday evening,'' said Jerome Hauer, the director 
of the city's Office of Emergency Management. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, there have been nine confirmed cases of the disease in  
the city. Eight are in northeast Queens and one is in Brooklyn. 
</P>
<P>
	The three fatalities were all senior citizens, who are  
particularly vulnerable to the virus. 
</P>
<P>
	Symptoms include fever, headaches and lethargy. Severe cases can  
cause seizures and paralysis. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., urged President Clinton to sign an  
executive order to free funds in order to help the city to contain 
the outbreak. He said the effort could cost more than $6 million. 
</P>
<P>
	For the past two days, helicopter spraying of the pesticide  
malathion, which attacks the nervous system of mosquitoes, has been 
halted due to bad weather. 
</P>
<P>
	City officials had initially predicted the entire city would be  
sprayed by Sunday evening, but ``We have to readjust the whole 
schedule now,'' said Hauer.

<P>
	The Class of 2000 has its opinions on Big Issues such as  
terrorism, AIDS and school violence, but everyday worries are more 
personal: college plans, parents' divorce, getting a date.

<P>
	On fathers:  
</P>
<P>
	``I've never had a father figure. It's common, so it wasn't a  
problem. I think with me being female, if I had to have just one 
parent, it was more important for me to be with my mother.''

	On divorce:  
</P>
<P>
	``I went through some pretty tough times when my parents  
divorced. I went through a period where I thought that I could do 
it, I could get them back together. I was praying every night to 
God to give me the strength to get them back together. When I 
realized I wasn't going to be able to do that, I completely quit 
praying. I didn't want to talk to God for two or three months.''

	On violent movies:  
</P>
<P>
	``I went and saw `The Matrix' a few days before (the Columbine  
High shootings). It was pretty realistic. But we're so used to 
seeing violence, it doesn't click. We're so used to seeing guns go 
off, people shooting each other. With me, it didn't hit until my

	``I was never confirmed. I was supposed to be Catholic, I just  
didn't want to be. I said I don't want to be confirmed because I 
don't believe what you're telling me. It's hard for me to just have 
blind faith in this.... Most of the friends I hang out with are 
like that as well. Most of our parents haven't been the most

`Well, she has some nice shoes on her feet, she's got a nice outfit

<HEADLINE> No. 9 Wisconsin 50, Ball St. 10 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MADISON, Wis. (AP) -- One of Ron Dayne's biggest obstacles in his  
quest for a national rushing record might be teammate Nick Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	Dayne moved 158 yards closer to Ricky Williams' NCAA  
major-college record, and Davis returned a kickoff for a touchdown 
as No. 9 Wisconsin rolled over Ball State 50-10 Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis' dazzling kickoff and punt returns are shortening the  
field for the Badgers almost every time he touches the ball. He has 
two touchdowns on kick returns already this season, and he nearly 
broke a third against the Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
	That means less time on the field for Dayne, who needs 1,424  
yards in Wisconsin's nine remaining games to beat the mark of 6,279 
set by the Texas Heisman Trophy winner last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``To get points and set up field position, to be threats every  
time we get the ball kicked to us, that's impressive,'' Wisconsin 
coach Barry Alvarez said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dayne finished with 31 carries that included a 2-yard rush for a  
touchdown, his fourth of the season, in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to break one, but I just kept plugging away, and I  
felt fine with that,'' Dayne said. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis racked up 227 yards on kick returns, pass receptions and  
rushes. Davis, who had a 76-yard touchdown punt return last week 
against Murray State, made a beautiful 77-yard TD run on the free 
kick following a second-quarter safety. 
</P>
<P>
	He also started at wide receiver in place of injured junior  
Chris Chambers and had four catches for 91 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's good to take some pressure off Ron, because Ron can't  
carry the whole team,'' Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dayne carried nine times for 57 yards on Wisconsin's opening  
drive, but saw the ball just 11 more times in the first half for a 
total of 98 yards. He sat out the fourth quarter and needs 321 
yards to pass Ohio State's Archie Griffin as the Big Ten 
Conference's leading career rusher. 
</P>
<P>
	Dayne, who was 14th on the NCAA's career rushing list entering  
the game, moved to 11th with 4,856 yards. He passed Ed Marinaro of 
Cornell, Nebraska's Mike Rozier and Steve Bartalo of Colorado 
State. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's so big and strong that if you don't get his ankles, you  
just bounce off him,'' Cardinals safety Jade Winchell said. ``He's 
as big as some of our linemen, so he wears you down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Badgers' offensive performance wasn't as smooth as the final  
score might suggest. Wisconsin didn't score an offensive touchdown 
in the first half despite having more than 20 minutes of 
possession, twice stalling inside the Cardinals' 20. 
</P>
<P>
	Thanks in part to two penalties, the Cardinals (0-2) lost 20  
yards in three plays on their first possession of the game. Nose 
tackle Eric Mahlik and several Badgers swarmed Quavis Tate in the 
end zone for a safety. 
</P>
<P>
	``We could not run the ball a lick,'' Ball State coach Bill  
Lynch said. ``Not many people can run the ball on them. With our 
running game, my No. 1 priority (is) don't play Wisconsin again. We 
couldn't block them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the ensuing kickoff, Davis wowed the Camp Randall Stadium  
crowd of 75,807 with a graceful kickoff return, three times dodging 
potential trouble and outrunning the field into the end zone. It 
was the Badgers' first kickoff return for a touchdown since 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Senior linebacker Chris Ghidorzi returned a tipped pass 25 yards  
for a touchdown early in the second quarter, staking Wisconsin to a 
19-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after halftime, Scott Kavanagh hit fullback Chad Kuhns  
with a 6-yard touchdown pass. Wisconsin's last TD came on a 2-yard 
run by Michael Bennett with eight seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
	Ball State had 21 rushing yards on 27 attempts as Wisconsin's  
oversized front line showed no openings. The Badgers, who play at 
Cincinnati next week before their Sept. 25 showdown with Michigan, 
allowed just 93 rushing yards to Murray State last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Wisconsin's two-headed quarterback strategy again had mixed  
results, with starter Kavanagh and freshman Brooks Bollinger making 
mistakes. Kavanagh overthrew Davis late in the first quarter when 
Davis was open, prompting a crutch-throwing tantrum by Alvarez. 
</P>
<P>
	Wisconsin's coach watched the game on crutches because of a  
persistent knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Bollinger erred as well, wildly tossing a pitch past Dayne on an  
option play inside the Ball State 20. The fumble was returned 23 
yards by Marion Llewellyn, and Ball State then went on a 59-yard 
drive capped by Brian Conn's 5-yard touchdown pass to Billy Lynch 
with 2:15 left in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
	Bollinger had a 32-yard keeper two plays later to set up Vitaly  
Pisetsky's 53-yard field goal, third-longest in Wisconsin history, 
34 seconds before halftime. Pisetsky missed a 27-yarder earlier in 
the half.

<HEADLINE> Floyd May Miss Caribbean Islands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	THE VALLEY, Anguilla (AP) -- Hurricane Floyd on Saturday whirred  
away from the Caribbean's Leeward Islands, but forecasters warned 
that Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands could be hit by heavy rains 
and flooding. 
</P>
<P>
	The hurricane itself was likely to pass well north of the  
islands, meteorologists said. Floyd was expected to intensify, and 
it was unlikely to hit land soon. 
</P>
<P>
	It posed no immediate threat to the United States coast. Still,  
it was recommended that people along the U.S. southeast monitor the 
storm's course this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``But it's not going to threaten any land anywhere over the  
weekend,'' said Stacy Stewart, a meteorologist at the National 
Hurricane Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Five Caribbean islands canceled tropical storm watches Friday  
night as Floyd, packing winds of 110 mph, moved further out to sea, 
the National Hurricane Center in Miami reported. 
</P>
<P>
	At 5 p.m. Saturday, Floyd was centered about 335 miles northeast  
of Puerto Rico's capital, San Juan, at latitude 22.7 north and 
longitude 63.5 west. It was expected to move west-northwest at 12 
mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Hurricane-force winds extended about 105 miles from the storm's  
center, and tropical storm force winds extended another 175 miles. 
</P>
<P>
	In Anguilla, the government closed schools Friday and residents  
put up hurricane shutters, in case the storm veered in their 
direction. Ports and airports remained open. 
</P>
<P>
	``Based on what I saw, the people are taking this thing serious.  
They are shopping mostly for dry foods and batteries, which are 
essential during a hurricane,'' said Lee Brooks, manager of a 
supermarket in The Valley, capital of the British island. 
</P>
<P>
	It was too early to tell if the storm would threaten the  
Bahamas, which lie far north of other Caribbean islands. Floyd was 
expected to be east of the Bahamas in about three days.

<HEADLINE> Cheese Blintzes Recalled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Government officials are warning the public  
that cheese blintzes manufactured by a small New York company may 
be contaminated with salmonella, which can cause serious infections 
in certain people. 
</P>
<P>
	Ratner's Retail Foods decided to voluntarily recall frozen  
cheese blintzes sold in 10 states after two New Yorkers became ill 
with salmonella, the Food and Drug Administration and New York 
officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The blintzes -- cheese, blueberry-cheese and cherry-cheese -- were  
sold in 13-ounce packages in stores in California, Colorado, 
Connecticut, Florida, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New 
Jersey, New York and Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers who purchased the blintzes are urged to return them to  
the store of purchase for a refund, the FDA said. 
</P>
<P>
	Symptoms of salmonella include diarrhea, fever, abdominal pain  
and vomiting. Healthy people typically recover in a few days, but 
salmonella can cause serious, even life-threatening infections in 
young children, the elderly and people with weak immune systems. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Department of Health said anyone who purchased  
Ratner's cheese blintzes within the past six months may be at risk 
of infection.

<HEADLINE> Uruguayan Driver Dies in Calif. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTEREY, Calif. (AP) -- Rookie driver Gonzalo Rodriguez was  
killed Saturday when his car smashed into a concrete wall at about 
140 mph during practice for the Shell 300 at Laguna Seca Raceway. 
</P>
<P>
	The 27-year-old Uruguayan died of massive head and neck  
injuries, said Dr. Steve Olvey, director of medical affairs for the 
CART FedEx Series, 
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez was pronounced dead at 10:10 PDT at Community Hospital  
of the Monterey Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
	He was the first driver fatality in the CART series since Jeff  
Krosnoff was killed in a crash during a race in Toronto in July 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez was approaching the famed Corkscrew turn on the road  
course when his brakes locked and his car hurtled off the track and 
through a gravel trap without losing speed. 
</P>
<P>
	The car struck a tire barrier and slammed into the concrete wall  
behind the tires. The open-wheel car flipped about 30 feet, flying 
over a wall of advertisements and landing upside down on a grassy 
hill. 
</P>
<P>
	The practice was flagged to a stop as safety workers removed  
Rodriguez from the car. He was taken by ambulance to the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for Mercedes said telemetry records from the car  
proved the accident was not caused by a stuck throttle as initially 
speculated. There was no other immediate report on the cause of the 
accident from Mercedes, the Penske team or CART. The car was 
impounded by CART for inspection. 
</P>
<P>
	Team owner Roger Penske immediately withdrew his team, including  
veteran driver Al Unser Jr., from the event. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew Craig, chairman and CEO of CART, said Penske and  
representatives of his team had contacted Rodriguez's parents in 
Uruguay. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest of the day's activities at the track, including the  
final round of qualifying for Sunday's Shell 300, were canceled. 
</P>
<P>
	``At our drivers' request, and a request that we absolutely  
support, there will be no qualifying this afternoon,'' Craig said. 
``The cars will run but the cars will not leave the pit lane.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 27 remaining cars will line up Sunday based on the  
qualifying speeds from Friday's time trials. 
</P>
<P>
	This was the first serious CART accident at Laguna Seca since  
the series first came here in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	Three spectators were killed by debris from a crash during a  
CART race at Michigan Speedway in July 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez was a regular in the European Formula 3000 series,  
where he is second in the season points after finishing third last 
year. In his only previous CART race, he started 16th and finished 
12th in the Penske car in August at the Detroit Grand Prix. 
</P>
<P>
	He began racing in karts at 13 and also raced in Formula 3 and  
Formula Fords.

<HEADLINE> Whoa, Nellie! Keith Jackson's Back </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) -- Keith Jackson, whose booming voice was a  
signature of ABC-TV's college football coverage until his 
retirement last year, returned to the booth Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Some eight months after quitting, the 70-year-old broadcaster  
did play-by-play for the network's regional telecast of the 
California-Nebraska game with longtime partner Bob Griese. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel just like a rookie today,'' Jackson said two hours  
before kickoff. ``I had no thought of doing this again. I was 
turned off. We were going a totally different direction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson, in his 33rd year with ABC, was talked into returning by  
ABC Sports president Howard Katz. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson, who turns 71 in October, said his contract is for three  
years ``or as long as I want, I guess.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel good and healthy,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	With the exception of Saturday's game, Jackson will do only West  
Coast Pac-10 games to minimize travel from his Los Angeles home. 
</P>
<P>
	He did the California-Nebraska game because he had planned to be  
in Lincoln for the dedication of Nebraska's new $36 million press 
box and luxury skybox. 
</P>
<P>
	The pressbox was named after Jackson's longtime friend Don  
Bryant, who retired as Nebraska's sports information director in 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant had a hand in naming the bathroom in the television  
portion of press box ``The Keith Jackson Toilet Facility,'' which 
drew recurring chuckles from Griese. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every stop we made last year, they'd bring him all these gifts  
because he was retiring -- they didn't bring me a damn thing,'' 
Griese said. ``And now he gets a bathroom named after him for 
coming out of retirement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the record, Jackson claimed that he never has uttered the  
phrase ``Whoa, Nellie!'' during a broadcast. He said the phrase, 
often attributed to him, was originated by comedians doing 
impersonations of him. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just got tagged onto me,'' Jackson said. ``There's nobody  
in our family named Nellie, I'll guarantee ya.''

<HEADLINE> Memo: IOC Members' Kids Got Perks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Atlanta officials bidding for the 1996 Olympics  
offered perks to children of members of the International Olympic 
Committee, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported in its Sunday 
editions. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta organizers helped the sons and daughters of IOC members  
get into Georgia colleges, offered to help them find jobs and paid 
for trips to New York and Disney World, the newspaper reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Documents detailing the perks were found among three dozen boxes  
of records examined by the newspaper. They contained no evidence 
that Atlanta gave out scholarships or cash to IOC members as did 
organizers of Salt Lake City's successful bid for the 2002 Winter 
Games. 
</P>
<P>
	CNN, meanwhile, reported it obtained documents indicating that  
Atlanta organizers thought IOC members could be bribed into voting 
for the city. 
</P>
<P>
	The documents are among eight boxes of records that were turned  
over to congressional investigators, CNN said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It appears as though there was a concerted effort to figure  
out how they might be able to buy votes for Atlanta. A dossier, 
maybe on most, if not all, of the voting members,'' Rep. Fred 
Upton, R-Mich., who chairs the subcommittee leading the 
investigation, told CNN. 
</P>
<P>
	A memo written by a lawyer who helped Atlanta win the 1996 Games  
described inside information he researched about IOC members and 
identified those who ``can be bought.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another document in the files describes some IOC members'  
tastes, noting that for one of them ``gifts are OK. Gift of female 
OK.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another reported ``will sell his vote, and will do so openly''  
but added the caution, ``Do not waste your time on him. To cave in 
to his wishes will get Atlanta into trouble.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yet another memo described how one IOC official ``likes the good  
life, wine, women (some say men, as well) and song. Visit to 
Atlanta should be low key with press but an all-out orgy,'' the 
network reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee Echols, spokesman for Atlanta Olympic officials, said the  
memos were merely part of an early effort by the bid team to learn 
as much about the IOC and its members as possible. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have not seen these memos, but I can tell you that the  
sensational nature of some of those comments is merely that. It 
makes for good gossip and that's about it,'' Echols told The 
Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact that we received information about IOC members does  
not in any way suggest that we did anything wrong with those IOC 
members,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about the perks reported by the Atlanta newspaper, Echols  
reiterated that Atlanta organizers did not pay for scholarships to 
IOC members' children. 
</P>
<P>
	``We made some mistakes, but we were not abusive by any stretch  
of the imagination,'' Echols said, adding that Atlanta organizers 
will submit a revised report on their bidding practices to Congress 
next week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Atlanta newspaper reported Atlanta officials arranged for  
Raj Ruhee, son of IOC member Rampaul Ruhee of Mauritius, to enroll 
at Georgia Tech in the fall of 1990. They also helped him settle 
into an apartment, with leased furniture and rent paid five months 
in advance, the newspaper reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The bid team presented Ruhee, who dropped out after one term,  
with a list of expenses it had incurred. But the records did not 
indicate whether he reimbursed the organizers. 
</P>
<P>
	The records also showed there were dozens of times the Atlanta  
bid team violated IOC rules allowing members one trip for two 
people to a candidate city. 
</P>
<P>
	Many IOC members made several trips with their wives and  
children in tow. Their first-class tickets cost as much as $7,000 
apiece. 
</P>
<P>
	After IOC member Pirjo Haeggman of Finland visited with her  
husband and two young children in 1989, Atlanta Olympics chief 
Billy Payne wrote to invite her family to return soon. 
</P>
<P>
	Payne wrote he would be ``delighted to make all your  
arrangements including a visit to Disney World as a guest of one of 
the members of the organizing committee.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta organizers also paid for a Disney trip for IOC member  
Seiuli Paul Wallwork of Samoa and his wife and daughter in 1989. 
Total air fare for the family's visit was $19,828. 
</P>
<P>
	Haeggman and Wallwork were among 10 IOC members who either were  
expelled or forced to resign as a result of the Salt Lake City 
scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Documents also show that Payne was willing to help when IOC  
members had children looking for jobs. He was turned down by German 
member Walther Troger, whose daughter wanted a teaching job after a 
divorce. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know your daughter is reluctant for any help with  
universities in our area,'' Payne wrote. ``We certainly do not want 
to interfere with the process, but we would like to help if 
possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also appears to have helped the son of Russian Vitaly Smirnov  
get a job at a ski resort in Colorado, according to a letter Payne 
wrote to George Gillett Jr., chairman of Vail Associates. 
</P>
<P>
	``As you probably know, Mr. Smirnov came to us and wanted us to  
find an opportunity for his son where we would work him tirelessly, 
teach him English and most importantly, give him some parental care 
and advice,'' Payne wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Echols has said Payne would not comment on the records until  
Atlanta officials submit an amended report to congressional 
investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	In February, Payne said: ``We acted honorably. Everybody in  
Atlanta and Georgia and indeed the world can feel good about the 
integrity with which we won the games.''

<HEADLINE>  Gypsies Outsiders in Greece Quake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- They find shelter beneath plastic sheeting  
or in trucks parked near their cracked, leaning homes. They say 
they can't even get tents because of rumors that they're selling 
them in a roaring black-market trade. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gypsies of Ano Liosia, one of the poorest areas around  
Athens, say Tuesday's earthquake, which killed more than 100 
people, has pushed them even further to the margins of Greek 
society. 
</P>
<P>
	While people of all backgrounds rallied together amid the  
quake's wreckage, Gypsies say they were generally regarded with 
suspicion. Some of their neighbors openly derided Gypsies as 
thieves and swindlers. 
</P>
<P>
	Vying for the attention of relief coordinators, Gypsies say they  
felt mute and ignored. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't count for them. We're not Greeks to them,'' said a  
Gypsy woman, Vasiliki Dalipis. 
</P>
<P>
	Gypsies -- who often prefer to be called Roma -- are marginalized  
in Greece, where only recently have immigrants begun to gain any 
acceptance. Stereotypes of the Roma -- that they are petty thieves, 
beggars and general lawbreakers -- are rarely challenged by local 
media or public officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Ano Liosia's deputy mayor insists there is no discrimination in  
assistance provided to its nearly 1,000-member Gypsy community, 
which rarely mingles with the mainstream Greek population. 
</P>
<P>
	Although some Gypsies still maintain a traditional nomadic  
lifestyle, many of Greece's estimated 160,000 to 200,000 Gypsies 
have settled into permanent communities such as Ano Liosia, about 
10 miles northwest of central Athens and close to the quake 
epicenter. 
</P>
<P>
	Gypsies who settle in some communities get some government  
assistance and access to authorities. But critics call the 
assistance attempts at isolating the group. 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	An old woman sat on the damp ground outside her condemned house,  
a bandage around her foot. Young children played in the grass 
nearby. 
</P>
<P>
	``They said they would bring us tents, but they still haven't  
come,'' said her son, Giorgos Tsakiris. ``They said the Gypsies 
take the tents and sell them. But we didn't do anything like that. 
Look at where we're living.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The only shelter they have from the rain is the back of his  
small truck, now lined with carpets salvaged from his 
quake-battered home. 
</P>
<P>
	Even at an aid distribution point in the shadow of a large  
church under construction, resentment and fear of the Gypsies were 
apparent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Look at what we've come to,'' a woman with tears in her eyes  
as she waited for food and water said on condition of anonymity. 
``We were homemakers, and now we're waiting for handouts along with 
the Gypsies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But other problems soon surfaced among the group of largely  
Gypsies. Some grabbed loaves of bread and sandwiches by the 
armload; others got nothing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Leave something for the others. You can't possibly need all  
that bread!'' Kyriaki Kondopidis yelled at one group of men. She 
and her husband tried to ensure that the food was distributed 
fairly. 
</P>
<P>
	Just then, a pickup truck skidded to a halt. A young Gypsy woman  
jumped out, filled her arms with loaves of bread and left with two 
bottles of water as well. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gypsies were cursed as they left.  
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	In the days since the deadly magnitude-5.9 quake, reports have  
abounded that scores of tents and other aid were carried off and 
sold for exorbitant prices on the black market or hoarded in case 
of another quake. 
</P>
<P>
	``There have been incidents of disorder or even looting,'' said  
government spokesman Dimitris Reppas. ``Many took tents which they 
won't even use. Some will use them later for a different purpose. 
Others may sell them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The government has said it will no longer give tents to  
individuals, and is providing shelter in hotel rooms, cruise ships 
and camps in stadiums. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although we have at our disposal a large number of beds and  
areas, they are not being used to the extend which they could be, 
exactly because everyone prefers to remain in their neighborhood,'' 
Reppas said. 
</P>
<P>
	But many of the local Gypsies say they were never told they had  
such options.

<HEADLINE> Security Beefed Up at Africa Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) -- All vehicles carrying athletes  
and officials from the All Africa Games received police escorts 
Saturday after a car with two officials was hijacked. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither of the two information technology officials was injured  
in the carjacking of the Mercedes Benz, which occurred Friday night 
in Soweto township south of Johannesburg, games chief executive 
officer Danie Malan said. 
</P>
<P>
	About 5,000 police and soldiers have been deployed to protect  
the estimated 5,200 athletes amid South Africa's notorious crime 
wave. 
</P>
<P>
	On an icy day that had swimmers wearing gloves and coats before  
plunging into the water and spectators wrapped in blankets, South 
Africa claimed seven gold medals Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really cold. I couldn't feel my hands,'' said Charlene  
Wittstock of South Africa, who won the gold in the 100-meter 
freestyle, the South African Press Association reported. ``It's 
actually nice and warm in the pool. I didn't want to get out after 
my race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Problems continued to plague the games, which began Thursday and  
end Sept. 19. 
</P>
<P>
	Weightlifting went ahead in an empty auditorium while officials  
turned away locals who said they couldn't afford the $2 entrance 
fee. 
</P>
<P>
	But in baseball, officials let spectators in free because they  
had run out of tickets. Lesotho beat Ghana 18-14, recovering from 
its 43-0 loss to South Africa on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities, meanwhile, were investigating what caused about 600  
children who were to participate in Friday's opening ceremony to 
contract food poisoning. 
</P>
<P>
	Games committee chairman Mtobi Tyamzashe said the services of  
the caterer would not be suspended. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have not been found guilty,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The 20 children who were hospitalized overnight were released  
Saturday.

<HEADLINE> 9 Prison Guards Injured in Melee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RAIFORD, Fla. (AP) -- Nine guards were injured in a short riot at  
a Florida prison on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Inmates rampaged after guards chased down and tackled a prisoner  
who was masturbating near the exercise yard at Union Correctional 
Institution, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	The inmate was handcuffed by five or six officers in view of  
many of the 300 inmates gathered in the yard. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of those inmates who were observing the incident ... took  
advantage of that incident as a means for them to assault the 
correctional officers,'' prison Superintendent Dennis O'Neill said. 
``We believe there were 20 or 25 inmates involved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Inmates threw chunks of concrete and two-way radios they had  
grabbed from the guards. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight guards were treated at Shands Hospital at Starke and one  
was treated at the prison's medical clinic. 
</P>
<P>
	The prison 35 miles northeast of Gainesville was locked down and  
12 inmates were sent to solitary confinement.

<HEADLINE> Girl Scouts Move Beyond Suburbs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOLLISTER, Calif. (AP) -- While migrant workers pick garlic and  
peppers in the fields of the Southside Labor Camp, their young 
daughters' giggling voices can be heard rising from a small park 
nearby. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yo me esforzare a ser honrada y justa, cordial y servicial,  
considerada y compasiva. ...'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Girl Scout promise.  
</P>
<P>
	The Girl Scouts have been promoting wholesome American girlhood  
for nearly a century. In recent years, the group has pushed beyond 
America's suburbs and small towns into nontraditional communities -- 
homeless shelters, gatherings of jail inmates' children and the 
fields of migrant camps like Southside. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole purpose ... is to provide the benefits of Girl  
Scouts to an audience that would not normally have access to 
them,'' Girl Scouts of the U.S.A. spokeswoman Lori Arguelles said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two hours each week, the girls of Southside, about 90 miles  
southeast of San Francisco, gather at the park to play games, sing 
and work on civic projects for badges to sew into their Girl Scout 
uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
	As the girls began straggling into the camp park on a recent  
sweltering afternoon, past the trees that double as kickball bases, 
they giggled and shoved each other. The youngest wore used Brownie 
shirts and jumpers, the oldest were in jeans and borrowed T-shirts 
stamped with the Girl Scout logo. 
</P>
<P>
	They'll meet there through November, when Southside closes and  
the families scatter to harvest or plant crops from Arizona to 
Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	In some cases, the girls will pick up where they left off in  
their new states, singing and playing with another group of friends 
in another Girl Scout chapter. 
</P>
<P>
	It's all part of what the Girl Scouts call the Border  
Initiative, an effort to target Hispanic and migrant girls and keep 
the continuity of scouting even when their families move from job 
to job. 
</P>
<P>
	About 10,000 girls have participated in the program since it  
began three years ago. Scout leaders don't ask their status, though 
officials acknowledge some may be in the United States illegally. 
</P>
<P>
	Yuma, Ariz., program manager Sylvia Martinez-Flores said the  
Girl Scouts are starting to draw more parents into the program as 
well. Recently, the Yuma group teamed up with Chicanos Por La 
Causa, which teaches the girls' parents to read while they work 
with their children on Girl Scout projects. 
</P>
<P>
	The Girl Scouts' membership has grown from 2.41 million in 1989  
to 2.67 million in 1998. During that period, Hispanic membership 
has risen from 3.9 percent to 5.7 percent, and officials credit 
much of the increase to the Border Initiative. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just looking at demographic and immigration patterns,  
increasing numbers of girls are coming from new immigrant 
communities,'' said Marsha Johnson-Evans, Girl Scouts national 
executive director in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	In migrant communities like Southside, persuading parents to  
enroll their children in Girl Scout troops can be one of the 
biggest hurdles for Scout leaders. Unlike the Boy Scouts, Girl 
Scouts does not exist in Mexico, and many rural Mexican parents 
have never heard of it. 
</P>
<P>
	And for some parents, the notion of active girls who play sports  
and go on camp-outs simply doesn't square with their traditional 
image of docile, protected, stay-at-home girlhood. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our parents' obligation was to put a roof over our heads and  
give us clothes and food. It was not up to them to entertain us,'' 
said Linda Valenzuela, membership director for the Imperial Valley 
Girl Scouts near San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	For many parents, the program is changing their thinking about  
American clubs like the Scouts. Some say they wish they had had the 
chance to be Girl Scouts when they were children. 
</P>
<P>
	``I see my daughter and I think it would have been neat,'' said  
Maria Franco, 42, a longtime Southside worker. ``For us, it was 
always work, work, work in the summer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's real cool,'' said Melissa de la Cruz, 11, whose family  
splits its time between California and Arizona. ``They teach you 
stuff you don't know, like macrame. We made anklets and 
keychains.''

<HEADLINE> Cockpit Has Supercomputer `Brain' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	One of the keys to the F-22 cockpit electronics is a central  
``brain,'' technically called a common integrated processor that is 
equivalent in computing power to two Cray supercomputers. 
</P>
<P>
	It integrates many functions and simplifies the way in which  
information is presented to the pilot. The goal: make identifying 
an enemy aircraft and firing a missile at the plane as easy as 
moving a cursor on a computer screen. 
</P>
<P>
	After an initial run through laboratory tests, the F-22 avionics  
software is tested aboard what Boeing calls a ``flying test bed,'' 
a modified 757 jetliner with an F-22 nose section fused onto its 
front and a set of F-22 wings mounted atop the 757's fuselage. In 
that configuration, and with dozens of computers and technicians 
aboard, the plane can test software for the F-22's radar and other 
sensors. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have really narrowed down the funnel of problems'' by using  
the modified 757 before the software is put to full-scale flight 
testing, said Gherry Bender, deputy manager of Boeing's F-22 
avionics work.

<HEADLINE> McCain's Campaign Book Unusual </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Campaign biographies tend to be tedious books.  
John McCain's is not. 
</P>
<P>
	The usual formula is a sermon on the virtues of the candidate, a  
catalogue of proposals, chapters that read like campaign speeches. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain's newly published ``Faith of My Fathers'' includes one  
paragraph on his public career, now as senator from Arizona, and 
none about his campaign for the 2000 Republican presidential 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	It isn't a political story, it is a personal and family memoir,  
and his account of 5 1/2 years as a prisoner of war in North Vietnam, 
of beatings so savage that he contemplated suicide, and did sign a 
stilted confession to ``black criminal behavior'' as a Navy pilot 
bombing Hanoi. It sounds harmless but haunts him nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many guys broke at one time or another,'' he writes. ``I doubt  
anyone ever gets over it entirely. There is never enough time and 
distance between the past and the present to allow one to forget 
his shame.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he also writes that the ordeal taught him lessons of  
service, commitment, self-confidence, and purpose -- after a 
``misspent youth'' of rowdy, rebellious, sometimes drunken 
episodes. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the front-running Republican  
candidate, admits youthful indiscretions. McCain recounts some of 
his -- no illicit drugs, the question Bush won't answer -- but too 
many drinks too many times. He tells of a drunken fall through a 
date's screen door, a fling with an exotic dancer called ``Marie, 
the Flame of Florida'' as a young pilot. 
</P>
<P>
	Then Vietnam, as a volunteer for raids on Hanoi, until the one  
on Oct. 26, 1967, when a North Vietnamese missile blew off his 
plane's right wing, and he parachuted into captivity. 
</P>
<P>
	Both arms and his right knee were broken when he landed in a  
shallow lake in the middle of the city. ``An escape attempt would 
have been challenging,'' he writes. 
</P>
<P>
	That understated style is typical as he writes of two years in  
solitary confinement, his unhealing injuries, the beatings and 
bindings he suffered for his defiance of his captors and 
questioners, fellow prisoners who, by his account, suffered far 
worse than he. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vietnamese offered to release him in 1968; he refused,  
writing that he knew they wanted a propaganda spectacle because his 
father was an admiral -- and assumed command of U.S. forces in the 
Pacific the day he said no, although he didn't know it. 
</P>
<P>
	The book, written with Mark Salter, his top Senate aide, is  
being published -- and promoted -- as McCain begins an autumn 
campaign push to raise his profile in the field of nine Republican 
candidates led by Bush. McCain will be out promoting it this month 
and next, on a candidate's book tour, financed, tellingly, by his 
campaign, not his publisher. 
</P>
<P>
	So it fits the quest it does not explicitly promote. Indirection  
may be more effective anyhow; McCain's is a heroic story, and its 
retelling in a succession of televised interviews about the book 
could be his way up in a campaign in which character will be a 
factor. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am a public figure now, and my public profile is  
inextricably linked to my POW experiences,'' McCain writes. 
``Whenever I am introduced at an appearance, the speaker always 
refers to my war record first. Obviously, such recognition has 
benefit my political career, and I am grateful for it... 
</P>
<P>
	``But I have tried hard to make what use I can of Vietnam and  
not let the memories of war encumber the rest of my life's 
progress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There's a small but growing library of 2000 presidential  
campaign books, most of them concentrating on political agendas. 
</P>
<P>
	There will be one on Bush later, described by his aides as an  
anecdotal biography. 
</P>
<P>
	Pat Buchanan has just published ``A Republican, Not an Empire,''  
on the foreign policy he advocates. Steve Forbes' is titled ``A New 
Birth of Freedom, and catalogues his campaign agenda, including a 
half-page sample of the postcard tax form he says would be the rule 
if his flat income tax plan became law. Dan Quayle came out with 
``Worth Fighting For'' earlier this summer, advocating a 30-percent 
tax cut, term limits, an abortion ban and other campaign proposals, 
and saying that he wants to restore traditional values. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain's is personal -- and timed for political impact.

<HEADLINE> Brown Acquitted on Threat Charge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Football Hall of Famer Jim Brown faces a  
maximum sentence of six months in county jail after a jury 
convicted him of vandalizing his wife's car, but acquitted him of 
threatening to kill her. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors on Friday said because domestic violence was  
involved, other conditions could be imposed at his scheduled Sept. 
23 sentencing. Those include probation, restitution and domestic 
violence counseling. 
</P>
<P>
	Municipal Court Judge Dale Fischer presided over the case in  
which a jury of eight men and four women returned their verdict 
after two days and 10 1/2 hours of deliberation. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown's attorneys, who told jurors he was the victim and wife  
Monique Brown was a crazy, lying, delusional woman who called 
police because she felt rejected, and prosecutors, who claimed she 
was badgered to recant, both claimed victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown, one of the greatest running backs in football history,  
and his wife were flanked by several supporters in the courtroom 
when the verdicts were read, but none of them showed any reaction 
to the decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown was charged with making a terrorist threat against his  
25-year-old wife and vandalizing her car by smashing the windows. 
Both were misdemeanor counts. 
</P>
<P>
	``I take full responsibility for all of this,'' Brown told  
reporters later. 
</P>
<P>
	``On the main charge I was found not guilty,'' he said. ``The  
other charge was a technicality based on ownership. There was never 
any word on my part that I did not break the windows of the car. I 
said that to the police that night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also said when he gets angry in the future, ``I should take  
10 steps back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown, 63, has a history of domestic violence charges, but had  
never been convicted. Testimony during the seven-day trial focused 
on the couple's relationship and a 911 call Mrs. Brown made on June 
15, reporting her husband threatened to kill her and there was a 
gun in the house. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Brown later recanted her allegations, but the city  
attorney's office decided to prosecute without her cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown lashed out at prosecutors after the verdicts were  
returned, saying ``I think they ruthlessly took advantage of my 
wife.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown also told reporters: ``I'd like to thank my wife for being  
strong and being with me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Brown took the stand during the trial, testifying she lied  
to the 911 operator and suggesting she was looking for a way to 
push her husband's buttons. Or, she said, she may have been driven 
by premenstrual syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown said his wife did not want to talk after the verdicts were  
read, although ``maybe in a couple of days we'll have a press 
conference.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During closing arguments, defense attorney William Graysen  
called Mrs. Brown a mentally disturbed, unstable woman who liked to 
create ``firestorms of drama.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Graysen said he was glad the jury found that Brown never  
threatened his wife. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy City attorney Grace Kim Lee said Mrs. Brown was  
browbeaten into recanting claims that he threatened to kill her. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee said: ``I am very pleased with the verdict because it  
clearly shows the jury found the defendant guilty of a crime of 
domestic violence against his wife.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During the trial, Graysen relied heavily on the testimony of a  
psychiatrist who said Mrs. Brown suffered from a ``borderline 
personality disorder'' which would cause her to falsely accuse her 
husband. 
</P>
<P>
	Graysen accused her of ``crazy, outrageous behavior'' and called  
her allegations fabricated and sensational. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy City Attorney Del San Juan claimed Mrs. Brown was trying  
to save her life when she fled her home, ran to a neighbor's house 
and called for help. 
</P>
<P>
	``For that brief moment, she didn't care about humiliation or  
what might happen to Jim. For that brief moment, she was herself,'' 
the prosecutor said. ``She was thinking for once about herself.''

<HEADLINE> Forbes Attacks Clemency Offer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) -- President Clinton's release of Puerto  
Rican nationalists from prison was a ``terrorists-for-votes deal'' 
to help his wife win a Senate seat, Republican Steve Forbes said 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP presidential contender said the clemency was part of a  
``pattern of abuse and arrogant disregard for the rule of law'' by 
the Clinton administration, and challenged Vice President Al Gore 
to say where he stands on it. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other Republicans campaigning in New Hampshire, Gary Bauer  
was endorsed by leaders of the state's Right to Life anti-abortion 
group, and Arizona Sen. John McCain signed copies of his new 
memoirs, ``Faith of My Fathers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some law enforcement officials and Republicans say Clinton  
offered the clemency to 16 pro-independence militants to help his 
wife in her expected Senate race in New York, home to 1.3 million 
Puerto Ricans. 
</P>
<P>
	But Hillary Rodham Clinton angered some Puerto Rican activists  
by saying she opposed her husband's offer. She and the president 
said they did not discuss the matter beforehand. 
</P>
<P>
	The prisoners, convicted of sedition and illegal possession of  
weapons, were part of a movement responsible for bombings that 
killed six people and maimed dozens in the 1970s and 1980s. Eleven 
left prison Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	None was directly responsible for deaths or injuries, officials  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes tried to use the matter to put Gore on the spot in the  
vice president's campaign for the Democratic presidential 
nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	``Where does Vice President Gore stand on President Clinton's  
terrorists-for-votes deal?'' Forbes asked.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Calls U.S. Open Champ </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- President Clinton called Serena Williams to  
congratulate her on winning the U.S. Open singles title Saturday 
night, then handed the phone over to daughter Chelsea so the two 
kids could gab about everything except the boys they met at the 
malt shop. 
</P>
<P>
	With the innocence of two teen-agers making plans for the  
weekend, the two teen-agers made plans for the weekend: Chelsea, 
19, said she would show Serena, 17, around the Stanford University 
campus next week after Williams plays in the Federation Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sure, if I'm around,'' Williams said before she caught herself  
and said, ``I'm sure I'll be around.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams also quizzed Chelsea about her major. (It's history.)  
</P>
<P>
	``That's definitely a tough subject. I don't think I would be  
able to do that,'' Williams said. ``I excel in athletics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You most certainly do,'' Chelsea said.  
</P>
<P>
	Williams' conversation with the president was also disarmingly  
devoid of protocol. She frequently interrupted him, asking 
questions about the number of time zones between New York and 
Auckland, New Zealand, where the president was meeting with 
Asia-Pacific leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, whose victory was witnessed in person by former  
President Jimmy Carter, said she didn't know that Clinton was a 
tennis fan. And she was flabbergasted to learn that he was watching 
from New Zealand as she beat Martina Hingis of Switzerland 6-3, 7-6 
(7-4). 
</P>
<P>
	``So you follow tennis? I never knew,'' Williams said. ``I'm  
glad you guys were watching. I hope you guys were cheering for me. 
If not, that's OK.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the president assured her that he was, she simply said,  
``Wow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After clearing up the fact that it was 16 hours later in New  
Zealand, Williams dropped a couple more ``Wows'' and told him, ``I 
didn't really think my day could get any better. And then I hear 
that the president wants to call. Pretty stoked.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton invited Williams and her family -- her sister Venus lost  
to Hingis in the Open semifinals -- to the White House for a 
personal tour. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wow, I'm so excited,'' Williams said. ``We're definitely going  
to make a trip this year, then.''

<HEADLINE> U.N. Timor Exodus Described </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DARWIN, Australia (AP) -- It seemed like a normal day for jittery  
East Timor, just some bursts of automatic gunfire outside the U.N. 
compound. 
</P>
<P>
	But then came the black smoke from burning houses, stinging our  
eyes and stifling our breath. 
</P>
<P>
	I looked at the anxious faces of hundreds of refugees who  
weren't going to the airport to be evacuated with most of the 
foreigners. Their faces were strained with fear that they might 
soon die. 
</P>
<P>
	Before I left, the ragtag militias fiercely loyal to Indonesia  
ran through the compound, shooting weapons, waving machetes and 
grenades, smashing vehicles, and chasing those refugees they could 
find. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we asked the (Indonesian) military why they had not shot  
at the militia to stop them, they told us that they had no orders 
to do that,'' said a senior political analyst in the compound, on 
customary anonymity. ``The guarantees of the military at this stage 
are worthless.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, the day before I left, I spoke with Indonesian  
soldiers stationed next to the U.N. compound. They had set up razor 
wire barricades outside the entrance and then another 200 yards up 
the road. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't go up there, mister. There are militia there, and  
they'll kill you,'' said a soldier from Kostrad Battalion 502 
pointing to the final barricade. ``The militia want to come in here 
and steal the cars. If you go there you'll be wounded at least. 
They have guns.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He pointed ominously at the figures in the street beyond the  
barricade. 
</P>
<P>
	Dressed in black T-shirts and red-and-white bandanas, they were  
loading up a military truck with furniture from a nearby house and 
shooting the government-issue weapons they were carrying. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are not militia,'' said one refugee. ``They are just  
Indonesian soldiers from the same battalion as this one around 
us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most likely, the soldiers had simply swapped their uniforms for  
militia gear and were looting in their off-duty hours. Fringe 
benefits of their tour of duty. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the military liaison officers at the compound believe  
the campaign to oust the remaining several dozen U.N. staff will be 
stepped up in the next few days. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be grenades and rocket-propelled grenades into the  
compound,'' one Australian said. ``We can only make preparations 
and take cover -- but it won't be long until the situation could be 
down to a hot extraction under fire.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For me, it was easier. I got out on an Australian air force  
evacuation flight.

<HEADLINE>  Aristide Supporters Rally in Haiti </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) -- Eleven years after thugs burned  
down the church where former President Jean-Bertrand Aristide once 
preached, hundreds commemorated the anniversary Saturday and 
clamored for his re-election. 
</P>
<P>
	The peaceful rally took place in downtown Port-Au-Prince, amid  
the ruins of St. Jean Bosco Catholic church. 
</P>
<P>
	It was at that church in 1988 that army-backed thugs interrupted  
a mass celebrated by Aristide, who was a priest before he became 
president. They shot and hacked to death at least 12 worshippers 
and set the building on fire. 
</P>
<P>
	Aristide, dressed in black, made a brief appearance at  
Saturday's commemoration. He saluted the crowd, but said nothing. 
</P>
<P>
	Photos of victims were pasted to the charred walls of the  
church, which has never been rebuilt. None of the perpetrators of 
the St. Jean Bosco massacre were ever brought to trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Since mid-April -- when an Aristide partisan was shot and killed  
in an altercation -- sporadic, sometimes vandalistic, pro-Aristide 
street demonstrations have wracked the capital. 
</P>
<P>
	Aristide, Haiti's first freely elected president, served for a  
year until he was ousted by the army in September 1991. U.S. troops 
restored him to power in September 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	He stepped down in February 1996, when his successor and  
disciple, current President Rene Preval, was inaugurated. Preval 
briefly visited St. Jean Bosco church early Saturday morning.

<HEADLINE> Albright, Russian Talk Arms Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine  
Albright has urged Russia to cooperate fully with American efforts 
to fight money-laundering by Russian organized crime, a U.S. 
official said today. 
</P>
<P>
	At a dinner meeting Friday, Albright and Russian Foreign  
Minister Igor Ivanov also discussed arms control, part of 
accelerating contacts to resolve a disagreement over amending a key 
27-year-old missile treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	Two Russian multiagency task forces -- one on arms control, the  
other on international financial crimes -- are due in Washington 
next week to further the process, the senior administration 
official told reporters on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright and Ivanov, in Auckland to attend an annual Pacific Rim  
free-trade forum, also discussed a meeting planned Sunday between 
President Clinton and the newly appointed Russian Prime Minister 
Vladimir Putin. 
</P>
<P>
	With a U.S. investigation into alleged money-laundering by the  
Russian mob through the Bank of New York and allegations swirling 
in Moscow media about high-level corruption, Albright urged Ivanov 
to get his government to show it ``is actually addressing the 
problems,'' the official said. 
</P>
<P>
	She asked for and received from Ivanov a pledge of cooperation,  
the official said. 
</P>
<P>
	On arms control, both sides appeared less cooperative. Albright  
restated the case for amending the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile 
Treaty to allow for a limited defense system to guard against a few 
missiles launched by ``rogue states.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The United States argues that the system would not harm the  
strategic balance because it would be ineffective against the kind 
of large-scale attack Russia could launch, even if it reduces its 
arsenals to levels envisioned under another arms treaty under 
negotiation. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright expressed condolences for the deaths of the more than  
70 killed in an explosion Thursday in Moscow -- possibly set by 
terrorists. She said the tragedy showed how fighting terrorism is a 
common concern. 
</P>
<P>
	Ivanov warned of the dangers of tinkering with the 1972 treaty,  
known as ABM. 
</P>
<P>
	``ABM represents the cornerstone of strategic stability. Should  
that cornerstone be disrupted then strategic stability will be,'' 
too, Ivanov told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. and Russian arms control negotiators have held two rounds  
of discussions so far. Their most recent talks, in Moscow this 
week, ended with no reported progress.

naturalized U.S. citizen from Belarus and his Russian partner with 
attempting to purchase and smuggle sensitive U.S.-made avionics to 
a customer in Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	The two men were arrested Thursday night in Chicago, a Customs  
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The avionics, used to warn fighter pilots that their aircraft  
have been illuminated by enemy radar, are manufactured by an 
American company and are approved for export only to Japan and 
Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
	``They (the avionics) are unique to the Japanese and Tawainese  
military,'' spokesman Dennis Murphy said late Friday night. ``We 
know these people were trying to get them out of the United States 
but what they were going to do once they got them out of the United 
States, at this point, is still speculative.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But another Customs official went a step further.  
</P>
<P>
	``There's no concrete evidence, but based on everything we've  
seen, the Chinese government is the ultimate buyer here,'' 
spokesman Pat Jones told The Washington Post. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter M. Leitner, a senior strategic trade adviser at the  
Defense Threat Reduction Agency, said Russian buyers of avionics 
made specifically for Japan and Taiwan ``suggests they've got 
either a Chinese or a North Korean customer.'' Neither Japan nor 
Taiwan, he said, ``poses a threat to Russia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Customs officials identified the two men as Edward A. Batko, of  
Buffalo Grove, Ill., a naturalized U.S. citizen from Belarus, and 
Mikhail Romanovich Press, a Russian national in the United States 
on a temporary visa. 
</P>
<P>
	Batko was released on bail after putting up a $500,000 house he  
bought last year in a cash transaction as collateral, customs 
officials said. Press remained in custody. 
</P>
<P>
	Both men are scheduled to appear in U.S. District Court in  
Alexandria, Va. If convicted of violated the Arms Export Control 
Act, they could be fined up to $1 million each and sentenced up to 
10 years in prison.

<HEADLINE> Diners Squirm As Snakes Slither By </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Diners screamed in terror and leapt on tables  
as snakes suddenly slithered across the floor during lunch in a 
Chinese restaurant, Hong Kong newspapers reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	About 100 customers were in the restaurant on Friday when  
several men, believed to be debt-collectors, released the snakes 
and some grasshoppers from two bags, the papers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police had to call a snake handler, who rounded up 28  
nonpoisonous snakes. 
</P>
<P>
	One woman was so scared that she had to be carried out weeping  
on the back of a fellow patron. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said they did not know who threw the reptiles or what was  
their motive.

<HEADLINE> 2 Deaths in N.Y. Blamed on E. Coli </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MALTA, N.Y. (AP) -- An E. coli outbreak at a county fair claimed  
its second life as New York health officials said the outbreak 
could become the worst such contamination in U.S. history. A second 
large outbreak of the bacteria was reported in Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, the same day that 3-year-old Rachel Aldrich, the  
first victim of the outbreak, was buried, Ernest Wester of 
Gansevoort, N.Y., died at the Stratton Veterans Administration 
Medical Center Hospital in Albany. 
</P>
<P>
	Tests confirmed that Wester died of E. coli contamination. He  
attended the Washington County Fair Aug. 28 and 29 and had been 
hospitalized since Sunday, hospital spokeswoman Linda Blumenstock 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wester, 79, was believed to have become sick after drinking  
contaminated coffee. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Friday, Wayne and Lori Aldrich held a graveside memorial  
for their 3-year-old daughter, then headed back to the hospital 
where their younger daughter, 2-year-old Kaylea, also is still 
struggling with kidney failure. Kaylea shared a glass of 
contaminated water with her sister Aug. 28 at the county fair. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 600 suspected cases of contamination have been  
reported from the fair, held 30 miles north of Albany, making it 
New York state's largest E. coli outbreak ever and one of the 
largest in U.S. history. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Antonia Novello, the state health commissioner, said Friday  
the number of cases could exceed 1,000 once the outbreak runs its 
course. That would make it worse than the 1993 E. coli outbreak 
that sickened 700 patrons of Jack in the Box restaurants in 
Washington state and killed four. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, in Illinois, state health officials were trying to  
reach about 1,800 people who attended a party in a cow pasture that 
now is linked to an E. coli outbreak there. The Illinois Department 
of Public Health said today that more than 100 people have become 
ill and at least seven have been hospitalized. No deaths were 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The party was held Sept. 4 in a cow pasture near Petersburg,  
about 25 miles northwest of Springfield. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, rain runoff is believed to have washed the  
potentially deadly E. coli bacteria from cow manure at a nearby 
cattle barn into the fair's underground water supply. 
</P>
<P>
	After a memorial service underneath a thick canopy of pine trees  
at a cemetery in Malta, Ms. Aldrich described Rachel as ``happy, 
vivacious, full of fun and compassion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Almost two weeks earlier, the family had spent a carefree day at  
the fair. It was a day of merry-go-rounds, games and petting zoo 
animals. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we were at the fair, there were balloons released,'' the  
girl's father said. ``Rachel asked why and at the time I didn't 
know, but today I was inspired. Sometimes things you love just slip 
away from you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The girls became sick a day later. A week later, Rachel was dead  
because of hemolytic uremic syndrome, which can result in kidney 
failure. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, the Aldriches learned Kaylea wouldn't need to be on  
dialysis, the first time in three days, and that it appeared she 
was recovering. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight other children from the fair remained on dialysis Friday  
at Albany Medical Center Hospital as doctors tried to filter toxins 
from their blood. Two other children and one adult also remained 
hospitalized.

<HEADLINE> Browns, Steelers Renew Rivalry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Browns defensive end Joe ``Turkey'' Jones  
wrapped both arms around Steelers quarterback Terry Bradshaw, 
hoisted him up and spiked him headfirst into the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	As Bradshaw lay flat on his back after one of the most flagrant  
fouls in NFL history, his legs twitched grotesquely and yellow 
penalty flags landed near his feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Browns fans danced in the Cleveland Stadium aisles. Bradshaw was  
flown to Pittsburgh strapped to his seat for fear of a broken neck. 
</P>
<P>
	Kind of sick, huh? Well, when you're talking Browns vs.  
Steelers, virtually anything goes. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 23 years after that play on Oct. 10, 1976, the most  
intense rivalry in the league lives on, even if it includes the 
NFL's newest team, the reborn Browns. 
</P>
<P>
	Oh, sure, Washington vs. Dallas has had its moments. So has  
Chicago vs. Green Bay and Kansas City vs. Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
	But in terms of sheer hatred for the other side, longevity and  
hitting in the stands that's been as ferocious as what's happened 
on the field, Cleveland vs. Pittsburgh stands alone. 
</P>
<P>
	And when the Browns usher in a new era of pro football following  
a three-season exile Sunday night, they'll have their new stadium 
christened with a game against their neighbor from Pennsylvania, 
the dreaded Steelers. 
</P>
<P>
	``You personally learned to hate the guy across from you when  
you played Pittsburgh,'' said Doug Dieken, a 14-year offensive 
tackle for Cleveland and current radio analyst for the Browns. 
</P>
<P>
	``I played against Dwight White for eight years. You know how  
after the game you shake another player's hand? I didn't shake his 
once. Not one time. Jack Lambert's, either. But you never wanted to 
shake Lambert's hand. He'd kick your grandmother's cane away from 
her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pittsburgh and Cleveland are about 120 miles apart. The cities  
share much more than an exit off the Ohio Turnpike, though. They're 
both industrial towns built by blue-collar workers who share the 
same values and passion for football. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is so much tradition in this game with these cities,''  
said Steelers coach Bill Cowher, who has a unique perspective on 
the rivalry because he also played for the Browns. ``They are so 
identical with the people and the passion and the way they identify 
with sports teams.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And if the Browns are to be welcomed back, Cowher figures, who  
better to do it than the gold and black. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's appropriate,'' he said. ``At the end of the first day of  
the NFL season, we are the last game of the day. It's great that 
football is back in Cleveland. It really is. It belongs there. It's 
just like if you would take football out of Pittsburgh it wouldn't 
seem right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Browns and Steelers have taken turns dominating the series.  
Between 1950 and 1970, Cleveland won 32 of 42 games. 
</P>
<P>
	But after moving into Three Rivers Stadium in '70, the Steelers  
went from NFL laughingstock to powerhouse and beat the Browns 16 
straight times at home. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bad luck, and they had good people,'' Dieken said, referring  
to reasons the Browns had problems in Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	During that streak, the Browns tried everything they could to  
break the supposed Three Rivers Jinx. 
</P>
<P>
	``We stayed in different hotels,'' he said. ``We took airplanes.  
We took buses. We tried it all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Sam Rutigliano once made an audiovisual presentation  
before the game that ended with a fake front page of the Cleveland 
Plain Dealer that said: ``Browns beat Steelers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That didn't work, either, Dieken said.  
</P>
<P>
	This week, Browns coach Chris Palmer hasn't needed any aides to  
get his team fired up for the Steelers. Cleveland's first NFL 
regular-season game since 1995 is big enough, but just to make sure 
the team's younger players understand the rivalry, tackles Orlando 
Brown and Jerry Ball have been giving them a crash course in Hating 
Pittsburgh 101. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown, who also played in Cleveland before the team left in '96  
for Baltimore, once had to be schooled, too. During Steelers Week, 
the Browns would bring in former players like Jim Brown, Ozzie 
Newsome and Hanford Dixon to fire up the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I get really hyped up for it,'' Orlando Brown said. ``I ain't  
going to lie. I hate Pittsburgh. I really hate Pittsburgh. I go out 
there and play ball. Anything yellow and black, I hit it. That's 
how they brought me up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer got his first taste of Browns vs. Steelers this spring  
when the teams took turns playing host at Grudge Luncheons to 
rekindle the rivalry. As Palmer quickly learned, there was no need 
to stoke the fires in either city despite the layoff. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is city on city here,'' he said. ``With this one, records  
don't mean that much. That's what football is all about.

<HEADLINE> Michigan Too Strong for Rice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) -- No. 6 Michigan was simply too much for  
Rice. The Wolverines were bigger, stronger, faster and deeper, 
especially at quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	Drew Henson, perhaps gaining a step in Michigan's quarterback  
race, scored one touchdown and passed for another in a 37-3 romp 
over the Owls on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Anthony Thomas ran for 87 yards and two touchdowns and Jeff Del  
Verne, a walk-on who received a scholarship earlier in the week, 
kicked three field goals for Michigan (2-0). 
</P>
<P>
	Rice (0-2), giving away nearly 40 pounds per man, never had the  
ball in Michigan territory until late in the fourth quarter when 
the Owls drove 56 yards for Derek Crabtree's 33-yard field goal 
with 30 seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no way to prepare for their size and defensive  
talent,'' Rice coach Ken Hatfield said. ``You just can't prepare 
for size like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Owls, who lost their opener 28-3 to Houston, have yet to  
score a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our offense needs to get it done, and right now we just  
aren't,'' right tackle Aaron Sandoval said. ``That's our foremost 
concern as a team. The offense has just got to pick it up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan rolled up 356 yards, while holding the Owls to 157.  
</P>
<P>
	Henson, a gifted sophomore who spends his summers playing third  
base in the New York Yankees' farm system, has battled fifth-year 
senior Tom Brady for the job since the start of training camp. 
Brady, who started and played three quarters in the opener against 
Notre Dame, started against the Owls, too. 
</P>
<P>
	Brady completed 10 of 15 passes for 115 yards, while Henson was  
8-of-14 for 109 yards. But it was Henson who got the Wolverines in 
the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
	Henson entered the game with 34 seconds left in the first  
quarter and, rolling to his left, fired a 34-yard strike to David 
Terrell on his first snap. That gave Michigan a first down at the 
Rice 30 and appeared to be the spark the lackluster Wolverines 
needed. Seven plays later, Henson dove into the end zone from 1 
yard out for a 10-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Late the second quarter, Henson completed 3 of 4 passes for 41  
yards, capping an eight-play, 53-yard drive with a 14-yard 
touchdown toss to Terrell for a 20-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, coach Lloyd Carr -- who has said all along he doesn't want  
a two-quarterback system -- wasn't tipping his hand. 
</P>
<P>
	``Well, I like the way they both played,'' Carr said. ``If you  
look at their stats, they were about even. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know, Ken Hatfield has been in the game 22 years, and he  
talked to me before the game. He said, `Lloyd, you've got a 
wonderful situation there.' And, indeed, I do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rice, which lost five of eight fumbles in an opening loss to  
Houston, was hurt by more mistakes against the Wolverines, giving 
up two interceptions and a blocked punt, along with losing one of 
four fumbles. 
</P>
<P>
	``Turning the ball over really upsets me,'' Hatfield said. ``We  
simply can't do that and win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Grady Brooks came up with Chad Richardson's fumble early in the  
third quarter. Nine plays later, Thomas scored on an 11-yard run 
for a 27-0 Michigan lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Marquise Walker blocked a punt by Rice's Travis Hale a few  
minutes later and Brandon Williams returned it eight yards to the 
Owls' 4. Thomas punched it in on the next play for a 34-0 Michigan 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Del Verne accounted for the rest of the scoring with field goals  
of 24, 38 and 30 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan, almost flawless in the opener against Notre Dame,  
couldn't maintain the same intensity for the Owls. 
</P>
<P>
	``We knew what we had to do,'' flanker Marquise Walker said.  
``There was a little downfall, but I think everybody got up at game 
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Wolverines, who drew only four penalties for 29 yards  
against Notre Dame, were flagged four times in the first quarter 
alone. Three were for false starts on offense and one for an 
illegal block that wiped out DiAllo Johnson's 16-yard punt return. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was unhappy with the penalties,'' Carr said. ``That's a lack  
of concentration. We played hard, but there wasn't a lot of emotion 
in the football team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson had a 21-yard return spoiled by a penalty in the second  
quarter, but the Wolverines overcame that mistake with Henson's 
scoring pass to Terrell. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wolverines also had trouble finishing off drives at times,  
settling for field goals instead of touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	Brady drove them to the Rice 22, where the Wolverines went for  
it on fourth-and-3, but Thomas gained only one yard on an 
off-tackle dive. On his second drive, Brady drove Michigan 54 yards 
to the Rice 7, but a third-down pass was incomplete and the 
Wolverines settled for Del Verne's first field goal. 
</P>
<P>
	A 29-yard interception return by Cato June gave Michigan the  
ball at the Rice 16 early in the fourth quarter. But the Wolverines 
passed on a field goal attempt and failed to make a first down. 
</P>
<P>
	This was the 150th consecutive game with more than 100,000 fans  
in Michigan Stadium. The crowd of 110,501 was the largest ever for 
Rice. The largest crowd to see the Owls before this was 93,479 at 
Ohio Stadium in 1996.

	Clinton: No Arms Sales To Indonesia  
</P>
<P>
	AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND (AP) -- President Clinton has suspended  
arms sales to Indonesia in an effort to ``persuade the Indonesians 
to support the United Nations operation'' to help end the violence 
in East Timor. Clinton on Saturday announced his move at the 
opening meeting here with Chinese President Jiang Zemin on the eve 
of a summit Asia-Pacific leaders. The turmoil in East Timor has 
emerged as a major topic at this 21-member conference. ``He's 
stepping up the pressure on Indonesia to restore order and 
security,'' said White House press secretary Joe Lockhart, 
elaborating on Clinton's announcement.

	U.S. Works To Improve China Relations  
</P>
<P>
	AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) -- In a face-to-face meeting with the  
Chinese leader, President Clinton said that U.S. policy toward 
Taiwan, a sore spot with China, ``has not and will not change.'' He 
said the United States will maintain ``a one-China policy,'' which 
does not recognize Taiwan as an Independent nation. Clinton met 
Saturday with Chinese President Jiang Zemin and also said he was 
eager to repair troubled relations and achieve an elusive trade 
deal with Beijing. Clinton and Jiang met on the eve of a summit 
Asia-Pacific leaders, after months of worsening tensions between 
the United States and China over the bombing of the Chinese embassy 
in Belgrade.

	10 Stranded on Alaskan Glacier

<P>
	JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) -- Ten people were stranded Friday at the  
4,500-foot level of the Herbert Glacier after three private tour 
helicopters went down on the icefield, a Coast Guard spokesman 
said. It wasn't immediately known whether the helicopters crashed 
or were forced to make emergency landings because of deteriorating 
weather conditions, spokesman Roger Wetherell said. Limited 
communications with the helicopters indicated the 10 people, 
including five cruise ship passengers, suffered some minor scrapes 
and bruises but no serious injuries.

	Coroner Would Welcome Waco Inquiry

<P>
	WACO, Texas (AP) -- A medical examiner said Friday he would  
welcome the chance to reopen the investigation into how David 
Koresh and his Branch Davidian followers died in the raid of their 
complex six years ago. Dr. Nizam Peerwani, the Tarrant County 
medical examiner, headed the team that performed autopsies on about 
80 people who died after a fire ravaged the group's compound 10 
miles east of Waco. In the wake of revelations that the FBI used 
potentially-flammable tear-gas canisters in the April 19, 1993, 
raid -- allegations previously denied by the government -- Peerwani 
said he would like to reexamine the deaths of 23 Davidians who died 
of bullet wounds. It may be possible to determine whether they were 
shot by someone outside the compound building, he told the Waco 
Tribune-Herald.

	Los Alamos Officials Disciplined

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Three officials of the Los Alamos nuclear  
weapons lab were disciplined Friday for their part in the China 
espionage investigation. The University of California, which 
operates the lab for the Energy Department, announced the 
disciplinary actions. It refused to identify the three officials. 
Sources said the most severe actions included a letter of 
reprimand, a salary freeze and other restrictions. The discipline 
was the first in the widely criticized three-year China spy 
investigation that has focused on the Los Alamos lab in New Mexico.

	Plan Introduced To End Iraq Sanctions  
</P>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- China, France and Russia have introduced a  
plan to suspend sanctions against Iraq if it cooperates with a new 
commission to monitor its banned weapons programs. Britain and the 
Netherlands are pushing an alternate resolution, supported by the 
United States, that would lift only the oil embargo against Iraq if 
key remaining questions about its weapons programs are answered. 
That proposal has already been rejected by the Iraqi government. 
Iraq was placed under sweeping economic sanctions by the U.N. for 
its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.

	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- A federal judge Friday ordered an end to  
busing and other means of achieving racial balance in 
Charlotte-Mecklenburg, the school system that pioneered urban 
busing in the United States after a landmark Supreme Court ruling 
30 years ago. It was the latest in a series of court rulings 
against plans that aimed to desegregate school systems. The 1997 
lawsuit challenged all of the school district's 
classroom-assignment policies, including busing.

<HEADLINE> Girl Dies After Fake Carjacking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMBRIDGE, Md. (AP) -- A man who originally told police he was  
carjacked on Maryland's Eastern Shore faces two murder counts in 
the deaths of his young children, who were shot at point-blank 
range in their car seats, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Spicknall II was ordered held in the Talbot County jail  
without bond Friday. Maryland state police say he confessed to the 
shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	Destiny Array Spicknall, 3, died Friday afternoon in a Baltimore  
hospital, one day after she and her 2-year-old brother, Richard 
Spicknall III, were found by construction workers in the car, 
parked behind an unfinished home. 
</P>
<P>
	The children were found at about 8 a.m. Thursday. Both had been  
shot in the chest. The boy died Thursday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Spicknall, 27, underwent 16 hours of questioning Thursday after  
police found him dripping wet by a payphone at the foot of a 
fishing pier over the Choptank River. Police say he gave them a 
phony story about how his children were abducted by an armed 
hitchhiker after he was thrown into the river. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said he confessed to the shootings after about six hours  
of questioning. Court papers show Spicknall confessed about an hour 
after workers found the Jeep Wrangler, parked a half-mile from the 
payphone where Spicknall made his 911 call. 
</P>
<P>
	At a bond hearing in Easton Friday, Spicknall's lawyer called  
the confession ``suspicious'' and said he would request a 
psychiatric evaluation. 
</P>

	``Outside of the allegations, the defendant is basically an  
All-American young man,'' said defense attorney Michael Belsky.

	SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- In one gesture, President Clinton  
accomplished what years of effort by Puerto Rican leaders couldn't: 
compel the U.S. Congress to act on Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
	But it didn't happen the way Puerto Ricans had imagined. Instead  
of resolving the colonial status of 4 million Puerto Ricans, an 
angry Congress is asking why Clinton offered clemency to 16 
nationalists, who are widely considered terrorists in the U.S. 
mainland and beloved freedom fighters in their Caribbean homeland. 
</P>
<P>
	Murderers or martyrs: the case underscores the tortured  
relationship the semiautonomous U.S. territory endures with 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``As long as this problem isn't solved permanently, we will  
continue having this kind of confrontation,'' said Puerto Rico Gov. 
Pedro Rossello, who favors making the Spanish-speaking island the 
51st U.S. state. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want a free country. There will always be people who will  
fight for it,'' said Rafael Cancel Miranda, a Puerto Rican 
nationalist imprisoned for 25 years for a 1954 shooting attack on 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Puerto Rico's people are U.S. citizens, serve in the U.S.  
military and receive $11 billion a year in federal funds, though 
they pay no federal taxes. But they can't vote for president or 
Congress, so their political destiny is given short shrift by U.S. 
politicians. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, on the centennial of Puerto Rico's capture by the  
United States, Rossello tried in vain to persuade Congress to 
authorize a vote on statehood, independence or the status quo. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Puerto Rico held its own, nonbinding, vote. Only 3  
percent opted for independence, 46 percent for statehood, and 50 
percent for the commonwealth position the island currently enjoys. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the paltry support for independence, there was  
tremendous sympathy for the imprisoned nationalists -- 14 of whom 
accepted the clemency offer and were released. On Friday and 
Saturday, hundreds of people waving the island's lone-star flag and 
banging leather ``pandereta'' drums welcomed those who decided to 
return to Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
	``These people are not terrorists. They are heroes, and we  
support them 100 percent,'' said one man in the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	The contradictions and indecision within Puerto Rico have helped  
relegate it until now to the congressional back burner. 
</P>
<P>
	But in the highly charged atmosphere of this election season, at  
least three congressional panels are expected to examine the 
clemency offer. On Thursday, a resolution condemning Clinton for 
offering clemency sailed through the House of Representatives by a 
vote of 311-41. 
</P>
<P>
	``This action is more than misguided. It is more than wrong. It  
is a very real threat to the safety and security of the American 
people,'' said Rep. Thomas Reynolds, a Republican. 
</P>
<P>
	The furor generated by Clinton's offer -- and New York senatorial  
hopeful Hillary Rodham Clinton's appeal to withdraw it -- has now 
become a campaign issue. Presidential contenders George W. Bush and 
Bill Bradley criticized the decision; Al Gore said he wouldn't 
``second-guess'' it. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Americans remember the terror inflicted by 130 bombings of  
government offices, department stores and police stations by the 
Armed Forces of National Liberation between 1974 and 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	The bombings killed six people, wounded dozens and caused  
millions in property damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Those accepting clemency weren't involved in any killings,  
officials say, but they were serving time for sedition and related 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics point to the 1975 firebombing of New York City's  
Fraunces Tavern, where Gen. George Washington once bade farewell to 
his own independence-minded officers. The explosion killed four 
people and wounded 60. 
</P>
<P>
	They point to Rocco Pascarella, a former New York City police  
officer who lost his left leg on New Year's Eve 1982 to a bomb 
outside police headquarters. Two other officers were maimed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very discouraged. Disgusted, really,'' Pascarella said.  
``These people are terrorists.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The prisoners' supporters have their own roll call of terrorist  
acts. 
</P>
<P>
	Cancel Miranda's parents were nearly gunned down during a 1937  
massacre of 19 nationalists and wounding of nearly 100 others by 
police in Ponce, Puerto Rico. Independence advocates held Blanton 
Winship, Puerto Rico's U.S. governor at the time, responsible; it 
became a rallying cry for generations of nationalists. 
</P>
<P>
	They point to a sometimes-ruthless suppression of independence  
figures over the years and a restaurant bombing in Mayaguez -- two 
weeks before the Fraunces Tavern bombing -- that killed two 
independence advocates and a child and injured 10. The FALN blamed 
the CIA. 
</P>
<P>
	The prisoners were serving sentences of 35 to 90 years, largely  
because they didn't recognize U.S. jurisdiction and refused to 
defend themselves in court. 
</P>
<P>
	Fernando Martin, vice president of Puerto Rico's Independence  
Party, argued that, by design or accident, the way the clemency 
issue has been handled bungled a rare chance for reconciliation. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was an opportunity to dramatize the end of an era,''  
Martin said. ``The times when the United States saw the 
independence movement as a threat to its vital security interests -- 
those times are gone. They went with the Cold War.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, the prisoners' release means celebration for  
some, more pain for others. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have paid our debt to society. We really have,'' said  
Dylcia Pagan, among those who accepted clemency. 
</P>
<P>
	New York City Police Detective Anthony Senft, blinded in one eye  
by an FALN bomb, could say the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a life sentence,'' Senft said.
