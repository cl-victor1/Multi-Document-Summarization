Kingdom wins hurdles with his season's best time

<TEXT>
	   HOLMDEL, New Jersey (AP) _ Any notions that two-time Olympic
champion Roger Kingdom's career was at an end were dispelled
Thursday night.
	   The 35-year-old Kingdom, running his fastest race of the year,
won the 110-meter hurdles at the Holmdel International track and
field meet in 13.38 seconds.
	   ``Nobody believes in me anymore,'' the 1984 and 1988 gold
medalist said.
	   Because Kingdom has not won a major international title since
1989, when he was World Cup champion, he has been dismissed as
finished.
	   He had difficulty getting equipment from shoe companies and he
was not invited to many international meets.
	   ``Now I can forget about all those people who think I'm done,''
he said. ``It's been hard to get into meets. I see guys running
13.50s and 13.60s, and they're in. The promoters say they want the
young guys, but they invite Jack Pierce, Courtney Hawkins and Terry
Reese, while I have the credentials and the hardware to get a spot.
	   ``Who blackballed me? Why are they so negative about me? What
did I do?
	   ``I'm bitter, but I'm not going to leave the sport yet. I might
not compete that much longer, but I'm going to stick around in the
sport because I think we need a voice and I want to be that
voice.''
	   Kingdom, the former world record-holder and now co-American
record-holder at 12.92, will chase his sixth national title at New
Orleans next week. He won his last title in 1995, the same year he
was the Pan American Games champion and the bronze medalist at the
World Championships. In 1996, he finished fifth at the U.S. Olympic
trials, and last year he failed to get past the semifinals of the
USA Championships.
	   Pierce, the 1992 Olympic bronze medalist, finished second
Thursday night at 13.54 and Hawkins, the Millrose Games champion,
was fourth at 13.59.
	   Hawkins was impressed by Kingdom.
	   ``He's a competition junkie,'' he said. ``He's the dog you
always like to kick, but he's still got some bite. He bit us
tonight.''
	   Meanwhile, 1996 Olympic high jump champion Charles Austin used
the meet as a tuneup for next week's USA Championships at New
Orleans, where he will be seeking his fourth straight national
title.
	   Bothered by the cold, damp weather, a soft jumping area and the
long wait before competing, Austin, the American record-holder at 7
feet, 10 1/2 inches, cleared only 7-0 1/2 before missing three
times at 7-6 1/2.
	   ``I was a little stiff because of the cold weather,'' Austin
said. ``I should have made it (7-6 1/2). I guess I was just a
little wimp because of the weather.
	   ``I'm in great shape. I was just trying to work the kinks out. I
was pleased with what I did, but I also was not pleased because I
wanted to break the meet record (7-5).''
	   Despite the low winning height, Austin said he would be ready to
extend his winning streak at the national championships.
	   ``I don't want to just win it. I want to win it big,'' he said.
	   Ireland's Marcus O'Sullivan, the three-time world indoor
champion at 1,500 meters, won the ``men's mile'' by about 20 meters
in 4:00.77, just missing breaking the four-minute barrier for the
102nd time in his career.
	   ``I felt sluggish,'' O'Sullivan, 36, said. ``My legs felt dead.
I felt tired.
	   ``Considering how bad I felt, I'm pretty happy with my time. I
know I can run 3:54.''
	   Debbie Marshall was a double winner, taking the women's 800 in
2:05.54 and the 1,500 in 4:18.14.
	   Meredith Raieny Valmon, the 1996 Olympic trials champion at 800
meters, won the 400 in 53.71.

	   DETROIT (AP) _ If the Washington Capitals had any doubts, the
Detroit Red Wings showed them why they are the Stanley Cup
champions.
	   Kris Draper scored with 4:36 left in the first overtime period
as the Red Wings, down two goals in the third period, came back for
a 5-4 victory to take a lead in the Stanley Cup final on Thursday
night.
	   Since the best-of-7 format was introduced, only three NHL teams
have rallied to win the Cup after losing the first two games of the
finals. Montreal was the last in 1971.
	   The series now shifts to Washington for Games 3 and 4 on
Saturday and Tuesday.
	   Steve Yzerman scored twice and Martin Lapointe and Doug Brown
once, with Brown capping a late two-goal rally with the game-tying
goal with 4:14 to play in regulation.
	   Peter Bondra, Chris Simon, Adam Oates and Joe Juneau scored for
Washington.
	   The game winner, which snapped a Washington string of four
straight overtime victories, came on a play on which Brendan
Shanahan got control of the puck in the right corner and feathered
it to Lapointe. He seemed to see Draper cruising in front of the
net and goaltender Olaf Kolzig and centered the puck across the
slot. Draper redirected it past the defenseless Kolzig, who seemed
to be expecting a shot from the circle.
	   The goal capped an outstanding game in which the teams scored
nine goals and took 93 shots, with the 60th by Detroit being the
game-winner.

	   DETROIT (AP) _ If the Washington Capitals had any doubts, the
Detroit Red Wings showed them why they are the Stanley Cup
champions.
	   Kris Draper scored with 4:36 left in the first overtime period
as the Red Wings, down two goals in the third period, came back for
a 5-4 victory to take a lead in the Stanley Cup final on Thursday
night.
	   Since the best-of-7 format was introduced, only three NHL teams
have rallied to win the Cup after losing the first two games of the
finals. Montreal was the last in 1971.
	   The series now shifts to Washington for Games 3 and 4 on
Saturday and Tuesday.
	   Steve Yzerman scored twice and Martin Lapointe and Doug Brown
once, with Brown capping a late two-goal rally with the game-tying
goal with 4:14 to play in regulation.
	   Peter Bondra, Chris Simon, Adam Oates and Joe Juneau scored for
Washington.
	   The game winner, which snapped a Washington string of four
straight overtime victories, came on a play on which Brendan
Shanahan got control of the puck in the right corner and feathered
it to Lapointe. He seemed to see Draper cruising in front of the
net and goaltender Olaf Kolzig and centered the puck across the
slot. Draper redirected it past the defenseless Kolzig, who seemed
to be expecting a shot from the circle.
	   The goal capped an outstanding game in which the teams scored
nine goals and took 93 shots, with the 60th by Detroit being the
game-winner.
	   The Capitals seemed on the verge of tying the series after
building a 4-2 lead with less than 12 minutes to play and Kolzig
playing great in goal.
	   However, the Red Wings increased their intensity and attacked at
every chance in a period in which they had 20 shots.
	   Lapointe narrowed the margin to 4-3 by one-timing a great
backhand cross-ice pass by Igor Larionov past Kolzig with 11:52
left in regulation.
	   Esa Tikkanen missed an open net that could have iced the game
for Washington about two minutes later and Brown eventually tied
the game with 4:14 left with a shot from in close after
intercepting a clearing pass around the boards.
	   Both teams had great chances to win in the closing minutes of
regulation. Goalie Chris Osgood stopped Brian Bellows in close with
about two minutes left, and Kolzig had to make at least three good
saves.
	   Bondra, Simon and Oates scored in a nine-minute second-period
span to stake the Capitals to a 3-1 lead.
	   A shorthanded goal by Yzerman cut the margin to 3-2 midway
through the third period. Facing a two-goal deficit, the Red Wings
rallied like champions and tied the game in the final 11:52 on
goals by Lapointe and Brown in close.
	   The Capitals has seemingly taken control early in the second
period when Bondra scored a somewhat controversial goal.
	   Defenseman Jeff Brown shot the puck from his own faceoff circle
across the Red Wings goal line. Bondra raced in, got the puck and
beat Osgood from the left circle on a play in which the Detroit
goaltender seemed to relax, thinking linesman Kevin Collins was
going to whistle either an offside or icing.
	   Collins didn't make the call because Andrei Nikolishin barely
touched the puck at center ice, negating the two-line pass. When
Bondra got to the puck first and thus the offside was wiped out.
	   Washington capitalized on two mistakes after that with Simon
scoring his first goal of the playoffs on a rebound at 6:11 and
Oates tallying on a breakaway at 11:03 after Nicklas Lidstrom
failed to handle a puck at his own blue line.
	   Yzerman, who had at least a half-dozen good scoring chances,
woke up the Detroit offense by scoring on a 2-on-1 shorthanded
breakaway at 6:37.
	   Juneau scored from the slot 37 seconds later to tie the game.
	   Holmstrom, who set up both Red Wings goals in Game 1, got the
Red Wings going again in Game 2 by setting up Yzerman at 7:49.
Kolzig stopped Yzerman's initial shot from the left circle, but the
Red Wings captain got the rebound and flipped it home.
	   Vladimir Konstantinov and Sergei Mnatsakanov, injured in a
limousine accient just six days after the Red Wings won the Stanley
Cup last year, attended their second playoff game at Joe Louis
Arena in less than two weeks.

Japanese doomsday cult member sentenced to 17 years for murder
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A former member of a Japanese doomsday cult was
sentenced to 17 years in prison Friday for his role in the murder
of seven people in a central Japanese city, a court official said.
	   Takashi Tomita, 40, was sentenced for his involvement in the
June 27, 1994, nerve gas attack by the Aum Shinri Kyo cult against
a dormitory for court officials in the city of Matsumoto. Seven
died in the attack and 144 others were injured.
	   Tomita was also sentenced for his involvement in the mass
production of the deadly sarin nerve gas at the cult's compound at
the foot of Mount Fuji.
	   Aum members have admitted using the gas in an attack on Tokyo
subways in March 1995 that killed 12, sickened thousands and
shocked a nation that had taken its low crime rate for granted.
	   Friday's ruling was the first convicted in connection with the
1994 attack. Six other cult members, including its guru Shoko
Asahara, still stand trial.
	   Presiding Tokyo District Court judge Toshikazu Ohbuchi told the
court that Tomita committed the ``cruel crime'' in conspiring with
Asahara.
	   In previous court sessions, Tomita admitted that he drove a
vehicle equipped with a nerve-gas spraying device to the scene, but
he insisted he did not know that the gas was lethal.
	   The prosecution told the court that Tomita had been told by
other cult members of the deadly gas before the attack.
	   Cult guru Asahara, 43, is being tried separately on charges of
masterminding the subway attack, the attack in Matsumoto and dozens
of other crimes, apparently part of his plan for a global war that
would leave him ruler of the world.
	   Last month, a cult doctor was sentenced to life in prison for
his role in the Tokyo subway attack.
	   The cult also has been implicated in the near-fatal shooting of
Japan's top police official and the deaths of a lawyer and his two
family members.
	   More than 100 members have already been convicted on various
lesser charges. The cult has been legally disbanded, but local news
media have reported some members still meet.

Yen's slide drags down Asian, world stock markets
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PRISCILLA CHEUNG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Stock markets in Japan, South Korea and Hong
Kong opened lower once again Friday, as Asia reeled in the face of
more bad news about the yen's weakness, Japan's economy and the
performance of bourses in Europe and the United States.
	   And fears that the weakening yen _ which fell to a nearly
eight-year low against the U.S. dollar Friday morning _ would force
China to devalue its yuan have spilled over to Wall Street and
Europe, raising fears that Asia's protracted financial crisis would
lead to a worldwide slump.
	   A cheaper yuan would also feed Chinese inflation and trigger a
wave of regional devaluations, weakening key economies such as Hong
Kong's and spreading as far as Russia, analysts suggested.
	   ``It's all about the yen,'' said Michael Lim, the head of the
treasury department at Standard &AMP; Chartered Bank in Jakarta.
``Nobody can stand a strong dollar.''
	   The yen tumbled further Friday as traders interpreted comments
by U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin overnight in Washington as
meaning that a coordinated effort by central banks to boost the
falling yen was unlikely.
	   In early trading, the dollar bought 144.21 yen, up 2.53 yen from
late Thursday in Tokyo and also above its late New York rate of
143.79 yen overnight.
	   At one point, the dollar moved as high as 144.75 yen in Tokyo,
matching its most recent previous high on August 30, 1990.
	   Rubin, testifying before the Senate Finance Committee on
Thursday, reiterated that Japan must revive its ailing economy,
warning that ``Japan's economic difficulties and weak currency are
having substantial adverse impact on the East Asian countries.''
	   Rubin also said it will be up to Japan to halt the yen's slide.
	   Tokyo stocks also fell to their lowest levels since Jan. 14. The
benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 148.06 points, or
0.99 percent, to 14,865.98 points at the close of the morning
session, adding to Thursday's 2.12-percent loss.
	   Tokyo and other Asian stocks fell Friday morning on losses on
Wall Street and in European markets.
	   The Dow Jones Industrial Average slumped 1.8 percent to close at
8,811.77 Thursday. Bourses in London, Paris, and Zurich also fell
between 1.6-2.2 percent Thursday.
	   Market participants in Asia were also waiting for the release of
Japan's quarterly gross domestic product data Friday afternoon,
which is expected to show the first annual contraction in the
economy since 1974.
	   In Seoul, the key Korea Composite Stock Price Index was down
17.01 points, or 5.2 percent, to close the morning session at
311.69.
	   Shares in Hong Kong were down by 1.7 percent at the open, but
clawed back slowly later in the morning session as most blue chips
were trading at or near all-time lows.
	   In Kuala Lumpur, the benchmark index opened down 2.3 percent,
while shares in Singapore, Bangkok and Taiwan also opened lower.
	   Shares in New Zealand fell for the 12th consecutive session,
closing 11.5 points lower at 1,997.63.
	   Australian shares also fell for the ninth straight session, with
the key index down 0.8 percent Friday morning.
	   Bucking the trend, Jakarta stocks opened higher on buying in
some state-owned companies, boosted by speculation that the
government may have already found strategic investors for its
divestment plan, dealers said.
	   But the rupiah fell against the U.S. currency early Friday,
trading at 14,250 to the dollar, down from 13,750 late Thursday.

Mitsubishi Motors welcomes settlement in sexual harassment case
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With US-Mitsubishi-Harassment &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Mitsubishi Motors Corp. said Friday it supports its
U.S. subsidiary's agreement to pay dlrs 34 million to settle the
United States' largest ever sexual harassment lawsuit.
	   ``We think an early resolution was desirable and welcome the two
sides having reached an agreement,'' Katsuhiko Kawasoe, president
of Mitsubishi Motors, said in a statement.
	   Mitsubishi's subsidiary, Mitsubishi Motor Manufacturing of
America Inc., agreed to pay the money to settle charges that it
ignored widespread sexual harassment of female assembly line
workers at its Normal, Illinois plant.
	   The settlement, pending approval by a federal judge, was
announced Thursday by Mitsubishi and the U.S. Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission.
	   ``Our company supports the agreement as a correct business
decision for MMMA to move forward,'' Kawasoe said.
	   Mitsubishi Motors will also back the implementation of various
measures agreed upon between the subsidiary and the commission,
Kawasoe said.
	   In April 1996, the EEOC sued Mitsubishi's North American
division, alleging that the automaker allowed women at the Normal
plant to be groped and subjected to lewd jokes and behavior in a
manner that was ``repeated, routine, generalized, serious,
pervasive and known to and supported by management.''
	   The settlement, however, contained no admission of wrongdoing by
the company.
	   The consent decree requires Mitsubishi to offer mandatory sexual
harassment training to employees, revise its sexual harassment
policy as necessary and investigate allegations of harassment
within three weeks as a ``zero tolerance'' policy.
	   Mitsubishi said some 20 workers were fired in 1997 for sexual
harassment and several others were disciplined.

	   DETROIT (AP) _ If the Washington Capitals had any doubts, the
Detroit Red Wings showed them why they are the Stanley Cup
champions.
	   Kris Draper scored with 4:36 left in the first overtime period
as the Red Wings, down two goals in the third period, came back for
a 5-4 victory to take a 2-0 lead in the Stanley Cup finals on
Thursday night.
	   Since the best-of-7 format was introduced, only three NHL teams
have rallied to win the Cup after losing the first two games of the
finals. Montreal was the last in 1971.
	   The series now shifts to Washington for Games 3 and 4 on
Saturday and Tuesday.
	   Steve Yzerman scored twice and Martin Lapointe and Doug Brown
once, with Brown capping a late two-goal rally with the game-tying
goal with 4:14 to play in regulation.
	   Peter Bondra, Chris Simon, Adam Oates and Joe Juneau scored for
Washington.
	   The game winner, which snapped a Washington string of five
straight overtime victories, came on a play on which Brendan
Shanahan got control of the puck in the right corner and feathered
it to Lapointe. He seemed to see Draper cruising in front of the
net and goaltender Olaf Kolzig and centered the puck across the
slot. Draper redirected it past the defenseless Kolzig, who seemed
to be expecting a shot from the circle.
	   The goal capped an outstanding game in which the teams scored
nine goals and took 93 shots, with the 60th by Detroit being the
game-winner.
	   The Capitals seemed on the verge of tying the series after
building a 4-2 lead with less than 12 minutes to play and Kolzig
playing great in goal.
	   However, the Red Wings increased their intensity and attacked at
every chance in a period in which they had 20 shots.
	   Lapointe narrowed the margin to 4-3 by one-timing a great
backhand cross-ice pass by Igor Larionov past Kolzig with 11:52
left in regulation.
	   Esa Tikkanen missed an open net that could have iced the game
for Washington about two minutes later and Brown eventually tied
the game with 4:14 left with a shot from in close after
intercepting a clearing pass around the boards.
	   Both teams had great chances to win in the closing minutes of
regulation. Goalie Chris Osgood stopped Brian Bellows in close with
about two minutes left, and Kolzig had to make at least three good
saves.
	   Bondra, Simon and Oates scored in a nine-minute second-period
span to stake the Capitals to a 3-1 lead.
	   A shorthanded goal by Yzerman cut the margin to 3-2 midway
through the third period. Facing a two-goal deficit, the Red Wings
rallied like champions and tied the game in the final 11:52 on
goals by Lapointe and Brown in close.
	   The Capitals has seemingly taken control early in the second
period when Bondra scored a somewhat controversial goal.
	   Defenseman Jeff Brown shot the puck from his own faceoff circle
across the Red Wings goal line. Bondra raced in, got the puck and
beat Osgood from the left circle on a play in which the Detroit
goaltender seemed to relax, thinking linesman Kevin Collins was
going to whistle either an offside or icing.
	   Collins didn't make the call because Andrei Nikolishin barely
touched the puck at center ice, negating the two-line pass. When
Bondra got to the puck first and thus the offside was wiped out.
	   Washington capitalized on two mistakes after that with Simon
scoring his first goal of the playoffs on a rebound at 6:11 and
Oates tallying on a breakaway at 11:03 after Nicklas Lidstrom
failed to handle a puck at his own blue line.
	   Yzerman, who had at least a half-dozen good scoring chances,
woke up the Detroit offense by scoring on a 2-on-1 shorthanded
breakaway at 6:37.
	   Juneau scored from the slot 37 seconds later to tie the game.
	   Holmstrom, who set up both Red Wings goals in Game 1, got the
Red Wings going again in Game 2 by setting up Yzerman at 7:49.
Kolzig stopped Yzerman's initial shot from the left circle, but the
Red Wings captain got the rebound and flipped it home.
	   Vladimir Konstantinov and Sergei Mnatsakanov, injured in a
limousine accient just six days after the Red Wings won the Stanley
Cup last year, attended their second playoff game at Joe Louis
Arena in less than two weeks.

Yen's slide drags down Asian, world stock markets
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Leads with 14 grafs to UPDATE with the currencies of
Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand opening lower.
 &UR; By PRISCILLA CHEUNG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Stock markets in Japan, South Korea and Hong
Kong opened lower once again Friday, as Asia reeled in the face of
more bad news about the yen's weakness, Japan's economy and the
performance of bourses in Europe and the United States.
	   Fears that the weakening yen _ which fell to a nearly eight-year
low against the U.S. dollar Friday morning _ would force China to
devalue its yuan also spilled over to Wall Street and Europe,
raising fears that Asia's protracted financial crisis would lead to
a worldwide slump.
	   A cheaper yuan would feed Chinese inflation and trigger a wave
of regional devaluations, weakening key economies such as Hong
Kong's and spreading as far as Russia, analysts suggested.
	   ``It's all about the yen,'' said Michael Lim, the head of the
treasury department at Standard &AMP; Chartered Bank in Jakarta.
``Nobody can stand a strong dollar.''
	   The yen tumbled further Friday as traders interpreted comments
by U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin overnight in Washington as
meaning that a coordinated effort by central banks to boost the
falling yen was unlikely.
	   In early trading, the dollar bought 144.21 yen, up 2.53 yen from
late Thursday in Tokyo, and above its late New York rate of 143.79
yen overnight.
	   At one point, the dollar moved as high as 144.75 yen in Tokyo,
matching its most recent previous high on August 30, 1990.
	   Rubin, testifying before the Senate Finance Committee on
Thursday, reiterated that Japan must revive its ailing economy,
warning that ``Japan's economic difficulties and weak currency are
having substantial adverse impact on the East Asian countries.''
	   Rubin said it will be up to Japan to halt the yen's slide.
	   In early trading in Asia on Friday, Southeast Asian currencies
fell sharply lower against the U.S. dollar.
	   The Singapore dollar was the most severely affected. The U.S.
dollar was quoted at 1.7455 Singapore dollars, up steeply from
1.7360 in late trading in Asia on Thursday.
	   Malaysia's currency, the ringgit, also was lower, trading at
4.0000 ringgit per U.S. dollar, up from 3.9750 the previous day.
	   The baht, Thailand's currency, was down in early action, with
the U.S. currency trading at 43.3750 baht, up from 43.1000.
	   In Japan, Tokyo stocks fell to their lowest levels since Jan.
14. The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 148.06
points, or 0.99 percent, to 14,865.98 points at the close of the
morning session, adding to Thursday's 2.12-percent loss.
	   Tokyo and other Asian stocks fell Friday morning on losses on
Wall Street and in European markets.
	   The Dow Jones Industrial Average slumped 1.8 percent to close at
8,811.77 Thursday. Bourses in London, Paris, and Zurich also fell
between 1.6 percent and 2.2 percent Thursday.
	   Market participants in Asia were waiting for the release of
Japan's quarterly gross domestic product data Friday afternoon,
which was expected to show the first annual contraction in the
economy since 1974.
	   In Seoul, the key Korea Composite Stock Price Index was down
17.01 points, or 5.2 percent, to close the morning session at
311.69.
	   Shares in Hong Kong were down by 1.7 percent at the open, but
clawed back slowly later in the morning session as most blue chips
were trading at or near all-time lows.
	   In Kuala Lumpur, the benchmark index opened down 2.3 percent,
while shares in Singapore, Bangkok and Taiwan opened lower.
	   Shares in New Zealand fell for the 12th consecutive session,
closing 11.5 points lower at 1,997.63.
	   Australian shares fell for the ninth straight session, with the
key index down 0.8 percent Friday morning.
	   Bucking the trend, Jakarta stocks opened higher on buying in
some state-owned companies, boosted by speculation that the
government may have already found strategic investors for its
divestment plan, dealers said.
	   But the rupiah fell against the U.S. currency early Friday,
trading at 14,250 to the dollar, down from 13,750 late Thursday.

Expos end Yankees' winning streak; Mets down Marlins
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES Pettitte's status in Yankees-Expos capsule &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MONTREAL (AP) _ The New York Yankees' nine-game winning streak
ended Thursday night when the Montreal Expos took advantage of Andy
Pettitte's sudden exit because of a hip problem and rallied for
seven runs in the seventh inning for a 7-5 victory.
	   Vladimir Guerrero began the Expos' outburst with a double and
capped it with a three-run double. Montreal came back against five
pitchers, making the Yankees the last team in the majors to lose an
interleague game this season.
	   Pettitte took a 5-0 lead into the seventh. But Guerrero led off
with a double and scored when Rondell White followed with a double,
with second baseman Chuck Knoblauch mishandling the relay for an
error.
	   Yankees manager Joe Torre immediately came to the mound and,
after a brief discussion with Pettitte, took out the left-hander.
Reliever Mike Stanton gave up a walk and a single to load the
bases, and pinch-hitter Jose Vidro had a sacrifice fly that made it
5-2. The Expos went on to score five more runs, including Brad
Fullmer's two-run double off Jeff Nelson (3-3).
	   Pettitte left after feeling a twinge in his hip, but said he
felt better after the game.
 &UR; Mets 5, Marlins 3 &QC; 
	   In Miami, Bobby Jones won his fifth straight decision, Mike
Piazza homered and Edgardo Alfonzo drove in the go-ahead run as the
New York Mets beat the Florida Marlins.
	   Jones (6-3) allowed three runs and seven hits in seven innings,
and John Franco pitched the ninth for his 14th save.
	   Alfonzo's RBI single in the seventh broke a 3-3 tie, and Brian
McRae added a solo homer in the ninth as the the Mets won for the
16th time in 22 games.
	   Piazza, who played five games with the Marlins before being
traded to the Mets on May 22, tied the game 3-3 with a solo homer
in the fifth. It was Piazza's third homer for the Mets and 12th of
the season.

Connors defeats Mayer at BTI Champions
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Connors win. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   RALEIGH, North Carolina (AP) _ Top-seeded Jimmy Connors defeated
Gene Mayer 6-3, 6-2 Thursday in the quarterfinals of the dlrs
150,000 BTI Champions senior tennis tournament at the Raleigh
Racquet Club.
	   The victory was Connors' third in three meetings against fellow
American Mayer, who was once ranked as high as fourth in the world.
	   ``It's challenging to play Gene because he has such an all-court
game,'' Connors said. ``He disguises his shots well and he's so
strong off both sides that sometimes I feel like I've got to go for
a little bit too much.''
	   The win advanced Connors to Saturday's semifinals where he will
meet the winner of Friday's match between John Lloyd and Mansour
Bahrami of France.
	   In a first-round match Thursday, Mel Purcell trounced fellow
American Tim Wilkison 6-1, 6-2 and Bahrami beat Australia's John
Fitzgerald 3-6, 7-5, 10-6.
	   Purcell's win advanced him to the quarterfinals against
second-seeded Johan Kriek.
	   The BTI Champions is the second event on the 1998-1999 Nuveen
Tour.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ More than 1,000 East Timorese
protesters invaded Indonesia's Foreign Ministry on Friday,
demanding a referendum on independence and the release of an
imprisoned rebel leader.
	   Witnesses said they arrived in buses chanting slogans and waving
banners. Some then entered its main building unchallenged and sat
in the lobby.
	   Later their numbers swelled outside. Hundreds of protesters
waved outlawed black, gold, red and white rebel flags. The compound
gardens were cluttered with protest banners.
	   Several senior officials were expected to meet the group.
Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas was not in the country.
	   Dozens of police and soldiers, armed with automatic weapons,
were at the scene but took no action.
	   ``Referendum yes. Integration no,'' the demonstrators chanted.
	   The demonstration is the latest in a series of rallies and
marches in the capital.
	   Former President Suharto resigned last month after a wave of
protests and riots. Protests have flared again since his successor
B.J. Habibie promised sweeping reforms, but at a moderate pace.
	   Indonesia invaded the former Portuguese colony in 1975 and
annexed it a year later as its 27th province.
	   Since then separatists have staged a guerrilla war against
Indonesian troops who have been accused of human rights abuses.
	   The spotlight went back on the future of the disputed territory
when Suharto quit. The former autocrat, who ruled Indonesia for 32
years and who ordered the 1975 invasion, had refused to make
concessions toward East Timor despite calls from the international
community.
	   Earlier this week new head of state Habibie said East Timor must
remain an integral part of Indonesia. However, he was willing to
grant special status to the half-island territory in exchange for
peace.
	   Habibie also announced that the government would release a dozen
East Timorese political prisoners. They left a prison in the
troubled territory's capital Dili on Friday.
	   Habibie has said jailed guerrilla commander Xanana Gusmao must
remain behind bars.
	   Separatists regard Gusmao, who is serving a 20-year sentence in
Jakarta's Cipinang Prison, as a freedom fighter. However, Indonesia
has branded him a violent criminal.
	   ``Our demand is the release of Xanana and a referendum for East
Timor future,'' said Jervasio Sarmento, 22, an East Timorese who
studies at a university on Indonesia's main island of Java.
	   ``No matter if we have to suffer. the important thing is that we
have to determine our own fate.''
	   On Wednesday several thousand East Timorese staged a rally
rejecting Habibie's peace offering and demanded that a referendum
be held on the question of independence.

India says test ban must be multilateral
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HEMA SHUKLA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India, which weeks ago announced a
moratorium on nuclear tests after last month's explosions, showed
little interest Friday in neighbor and rival Pakistan's offer not
to test again.
	   Indian foreign ministry spokesman K.C. Singh would say little
more than that India would stand by its decision not to conduct
further tests.
	   Pakistan had responded to India's claim of five tests by setting
off what it said were six tests of its own. Last month's
tit-for-tat tests raised concerns the long-standing tension between
predominately Hindu India and officially Islamic Pakistan _ which
have fought three wars in the last 50 years _ could result in
nuclear war.
	   Pakistan announced a unilateral moratorium on nuclear testing
Thursday, and offered fresh talks aimed at easing tensions with
India, particularly over the Kashmiri border region they both
claim. Both sides have repeatedly offered talks in recent weeks,
but there is little evidence they are making real progress toward a
meeting.
	   Pakistan's foreign ministry released a statement suggesting a
no-test pact with India as a ``confidence-building'' measure. But
``moratoriums are not bilateral,'' said Singh.
	   Despite the conciliatory statement from his ministry, Pakistani
Foreign Minister Gohar Ayub expressed deep distrust of India in an
interview with The Associated Press. Several rightist members of
India's main governing party, the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya
Janata Party, followed up the nuclear tests with warnings to
Pakistan to back down on Kashmir.
	   ``Where there is such a threats from the Hindu fundamentalists
you can expect a nuclear launch and a nuclear escalation'' of a
conflict between the two countries, Ayub said.
	   Kashmir has been the flash point of two of the three
Indo-Pakistani wars, and clashes between the two nations' armies
still regularly break out in the region. The two countries fought a
third war in 1971 that resulted in what was then East Pakistan
breaking away from Pakistan to become independent Bangladesh.
	   The U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan welcomed Pakistan's
unilateral moratorium, saying he would like to see both Pakistan
and India sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.
	   Kashmir was split between India and Pakistan after the Asian
subcontinent gained independence from Britain in 1947.
	   Pakistan is demanding that Kashmiris on both sides of the
disputed border be allowed to vote on whether a united Kashmir
should go to Pakistan or India. India has rejected such a vote,
saying its sovereignty is non-negotiable.
	   India's only Muslim-dominated state is Jammu-Kashmir. India has
accused Pakistan of arming and training Muslim militants there who
have been waging a bloody secessionist battle since 1989.
	   Islamabad says it gives only moral support to Kashmiri
militants.

Greenpeace floats ``anti-nuclear'' balloon over Indian monument
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; AP Photos &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   AGRA, India (AP) _ Greenpeace anti-nuclear campaigners chose
India's most recognizable monument _ the Taj Mahal _ as the site of
a protest Friday.
	   The activists said they floated an Earth-shaped hot-air balloon
draped with banners declaring ``Nuclear Disarmament Now'' about 200
meters (yards) from the 345-year-old tomb known around the world as
a monument to love.
	   Greenpeace, which has campaigned against nuclear weapons since
it was formed in 1971, has sharply criticized last month's
tit-for-tat nuclear testing by India and neighboring Pakistan. The
environmental group is known for having demonstrators spend nearly
two days suspended on ropes from a bridge to protest ``factory''
fishing in Washington state and sailing its Rainbow Warrior into
France's South Pacific nuclear testing sites.
	   The Taj Mahal is in Agra, 200 kilometers (125 miles) south of
New Delhi and 600 kilometers (375 miles) east of India's test site,
but Greenpeace organizers said they wanted to stage their protest
at a place the world would recognize as Indian.
	   ``Becoming a nuclear weapons state should be an embarrassment to
every citizen,'' Simon Carroll, who led the Greenpeace balloon
protest, said in a statement. He also called on the traditional
nuclear powers _ Britain, China, France, Russia and the United
States _ to destroy their stockpiles of nuclear weapons.

India says test ban must be multilateral

	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India, which weeks ago announced a
moratorium on nuclear tests after last month's explosions, showed
little interest Friday in neighbor and rival Pakistan's offer not
to test again.
	   Indian foreign ministry spokesman K.C. Singh would say little
more than that India would stand by its decision not to conduct
further tests.
	   Pakistan had responded to India's claim of five tests by setting
off what it said were six tests of its own. Last month's
tit-for-tat tests raised concerns the long-standing tension between
predominately Hindu India and officially Islamic Pakistan _ which
have fought three wars in the last 50 years _ could result in
nuclear war.
	   Pakistan announced a unilateral moratorium on nuclear testing
Thursday, and offered fresh talks aimed at easing tensions with
India, particularly over the Kashmiri border region they both
claim. Both sides have repeatedly offered talks in recent weeks,
but there is little evidence they are making real progress toward a
meeting.
	   Pakistan's foreign ministry released a statement suggesting a
no-test pact with India as a ``confidence-building'' measure. But
``moratoriums are not bilateral,'' said Singh.
	   Despite the conciliatory statement from his ministry, Pakistani
Foreign Minister Gohar Ayub expressed deep distrust of India in an
interview with The Associated Press. Several rightist members of
India's main governing party, the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya
Janata Party, followed up the nuclear tests with warnings to
Pakistan to back down on Kashmir.
	   ``Where there is such a threats from the Hindu fundamentalists
you can expect a nuclear launch and a nuclear escalation'' of a
conflict between the two countries, Ayub said.
	   Kashmir has been the flash point of two of the three
Indo-Pakistani wars, and clashes between the two nations' armies
still regularly break out in the region. The two countries fought a
third war in 1971 that resulted in what was then East Pakistan
breaking away from Pakistan to become independent Bangladesh.
	   The U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan welcomed Pakistan's
unilateral moratorium, saying he would like to see both Pakistan
and India sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.
	   The Indian and Pakistani tests prompted worldwide condemnation.
The international environmental group Greenpeace staged a protest
Friday at India's most recognizable monument, floating an
Earth-shaped hot air balloon draped with anti-nuclear slogans near
the Taj Mahal.
	   Kashmir was split between India and Pakistan after the Asian
subcontinent gained independence from Britain in 1947.
	   Pakistan is demanding that Kashmiris on both sides of the
disputed border be allowed to vote on whether a united Kashmir
should go to Pakistan or India. India has rejected such a vote,
saying its sovereignty is non-negotiable.
	   India's only Muslim-dominated state is Jammu-Kashmir. India has
accused Pakistan of arming and training Muslim militants there who
have been waging a bloody secessionist battle since 1989.
	   Islamabad says it gives only moral support to Kashmiri
militants.

Expos end Yankees' winning streak; Mets down Marlins
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with late games. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MONTREAL (AP) _ The New York Yankees' nine-game winning streak
ended Thursday night when the Montreal Expos took advantage of Andy
Pettitte's sudden exit because of a hip problem and rallied for
seven runs in the seventh inning for a 7-5 victory.
	   Vladimir Guerrero began the Expos' outburst with a double and
capped it with a three-run double. Montreal came back against five
pitchers, making the Yankees the last team in the majors to lose an
interleague game this season.
	   Pettitte took a 5-0 lead into the seventh. But Guerrero led off
with a double and scored when Rondell White followed with a double,
with second baseman Chuck Knoblauch mishandling the relay for an
error.
	   Yankees manager Joe Torre immediately came to the mound and,
after a brief discussion with Pettitte, took out the left-hander.
Reliever Mike Stanton gave up a walk and a single to load the
bases, and pinch-hitter Jose Vidro had a sacrifice fly that made it
5-2. The Expos went on to score five more runs, including Brad
Fullmer's two-run double off Jeff Nelson (3-3).
	   Pettitte left after feeling a twinge in his hip, but said he
felt better after the game.
 &UR; Mets 5, Marlins 3 &QC; 
	   In Miami, Bobby Jones won his fifth straight decision, Mike
Piazza homered and Edgardo Alfonzo drove in the go-ahead run as the
New York Mets beat the Florida Marlins.
	   Jones (6-3) allowed three runs and seven hits in seven innings,
and John Franco pitched the ninth for his 14th save.
	   Alfonzo's RBI single in the seventh broke a 3-3 tie, and Brian
McRae added a solo homer in the ninth as the the Mets won for the
16th time in 22 games.
	   Piazza, who played five games with the Marlins before being
traded to the Mets on May 22, tied the game 3-3 with a solo homer
in the fifth. It was Piazza's third homer for the Mets and 12th of
the season.
 &UR; Athletics 5, Mariners 2 &QC; 
	   In Oakland, California, Mike Oquist's bid for his first career
shutout was spoiled by Ken Griffey Jr.'s 26th homer, but Oquist
still got his fourth straight win as the Athletics defeated
Seattle.
	   Oquist had a shutout until two outs in the eighth, when Griffey
slammed a two-run homer to left-center. It was the seventh homer in
10 games for Griffey, who leads the AL in home runs.
	   Oquist (4-3) allowed two runs and eight hits in 7 2-3 innings.
He struck out six and didn't walk a batter.
	   Rickey Henderson had an RBI double and stole two bases as the
A's broke a two-game losing streak and knocked the Mariners into
last place in the AL West, a game behind Oakland. Seattle has lost
five of six.
 &UR; Angels 10, Diamondbacks 5 &QC; 
	   In Phoenix, Dave Hollins homered twice and Darin Erstad also
homered and had four hits as Anaheim beat Arizona.
	   Hollins and Matt Walbeck homered to key a five-run first inning
for the Angels, who have won 10 of their last 11 games. Garrett
Anderson homered later for Anaheim.
	   Erstad, who also tripled, went 10-for-13 in the three-game
series. He scored five runs and drove in four in the set.
	   Jay Bell and Karim Garcia hit home runs for the Diamondbacks,
who have lost six of their last eight games.

Twelve East Timorese political prisoners leave jail

<TEXT>
	   DILI, Indonesia (AP) _ Shouting pro-independence slogans and
clutching their belongings in plastic bags, a dozen pardoned
political prisoners walked out of a jail Friday in the
Indonesian-controlled territory of East Timor.
	   ``Viva East Timor,'' they chanted, vowing to continue their
quest for a country independent from Indonesia, which invaded the
former Portuguese colony in 1975 and annexed it a year later.
	   In Jakarta, the Indonesian capital, about 1,000 East Timorese
protesters demanding a vote on self-determination, arrived in buses
at the foreign ministry, chanting and waving banners.
	   Some then entered its main building unchallenged and sat in the
lobby. Later their numbers swelled outside, where hundreds of
protesters waved outlawed black, gold, red and white rebel flags.
	   President B.J. Habibie, who is pursuing an agenda of democratic
reform, signed a decree for the release of the political prisoners
earlier this week. Many are students who were arrested last year
for demonstrating against Indonesian authority.
	   ``This freedom (is) good for our struggle. It's a victory for
us,'' said Tomas Augusto Correia, a 33-year-old municipal worker
who was among the detainees.
	   On Thursday, the prisoners refused to leave Becora prison on the
outskirts of Dili, the capital of East Timor, saying they also
wanted freedom for Xanana Gusmao, the jailed separatist rebel
chief.
	   But they agreed to leave after regaling wardens with a litany of
complaints, ranging from the poor quality of prison food to
military repression. Most were serving one- or two-year sentences,
and some were due to leave jail in coming days.
	   In a brief ceremony in a cramped prison office, the warden shook
hands with one of the prisoners and handed him his release form to
a smattering of applause.
	   In silence, the inmates then unveiled a banner with slogans
denouncing the presence of the Indonesian military in East Timor
and demanding the release of Gusmao.
	   Arrested in 1992, Gusmao is serving a 20-year sentence in
Cipinang jail in Jakarta, 2,240 kilometers (1,400 miles) west of
East Timor.
	   The government has yet to give a clear signal on how it plans to
handle the charismatic Gusmao. He is beloved by thousands of East
Timorese who see him as a symbol of resistance, but the Indonesian
military has said he is a criminal, not a political prisoner.
	   The Indonesian military has been accused of widespread abuses in
East Timor, bringing international condemnation. At the same time,
the government has pumped resources into the development of the
poor and rugged half-island territory of 800,000 people.
	   A justice ministry official told the newly released prisoners
that the government was committed to releasing more political
detainees but warned them that as free men, they were not above the
law.
	   Filing through the prison door, the prisoners said they planned
to resume their political activities.
	   ``We want total independence,'' 20-year-old Bendito Amoral said
before catching a bus.

Singapore dollar falls, stocks level
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Following the lead of the Japanese yen and most
Asian currencies, the Singapore dollar fell further Friday. The
stock market was slightly up by the midday close.
	   Traders have said the Singapore dollar is easy to sell because
of its liquidity and higher local interest rates, although those
rates have been dropping as the currency loses value against the
U.S. dollar.
	   The Singapore currency hit 1.75 to the U.S. dollar in early
trading, but recovered slightly to 1.743. Its value has been
steadily decreasing over the past few months and is 21.6 percent
lower against the U.S. dollar than last July 1, the day before the
Asian economic crisis began.
	   Singapore's benchmark Straits Times Industrial Index dipped 21
points, or 2 percent, immediately after the market opened. By the
midday closing it had regained the losses and was up 3 points, or
.3 percent.
	   However, the index has lost 891 points, or 45 percent of its
value, since last July 1.

	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India, which weeks ago announced a
moratorium on nuclear tests after last month's explosions, showed
little interest Friday in neighbor and rival Pakistan's offer not
to test again.
	   Indian foreign ministry spokesman K.C. Singh would say little
more than that India would stand by its decision not to conduct
further tests.
	   Pakistan had responded to India's claim of five tests by setting
off what it said were six tests of its own. Last month's
tit-for-tat tests raised concerns the long-standing tension between
predominately Hindu India and officially Islamic Pakistan _ which
have fought three wars in the last 50 years _ could result in
nuclear war.
	   Pakistan announced a unilateral moratorium on nuclear testing
Thursday, and offered fresh talks aimed at easing tensions with
India, particularly over the Kashmiri border region they both
claim. Both sides have repeatedly offered talks in recent weeks,
but there is little evidence they are making real progress toward a
meeting.
	   Pakistan's foreign ministry released a statement suggesting a
no-test pact with India as a ``confidence-building'' measure. But
``moratoriums are not bilateral,'' said Singh.
	   Despite the conciliatory statement from his ministry, Pakistani
Foreign Minister Gohar Ayub expressed deep distrust of India in an
interview with The Associated Press. Several rightist members of
India's main governing party, the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya
Janata Party, followed up the nuclear tests with warnings to
Pakistan to back down on Kashmir.
	   ``Where there is such a threats from the Hindu fundamentalists
you can expect a nuclear launch and a nuclear escalation'' of a
conflict between the two countries, Ayub said.
	   Kashmir has been the flash point of two of the three
Indo-Pakistani wars, and clashes between the two nations' armies
still regularly break out in the region. The two countries fought a
third war in 1971 that resulted in what was then East Pakistan
breaking away from Pakistan to become independent Bangladesh.
	   The U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan welcomed Pakistan's
unilateral moratorium, saying he would like to see both Pakistan
and India sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.
	   The Indian and Pakistani tests prompted worldwide condemnation.
The international environmental group Greenpeace staged a protest
Friday at India's most recognizable monument, floating an
Earth-shaped hot air balloon draped with anti-nuclear slogans near
the Taj Mahal.
	   Kashmir was split between India and Pakistan after the Asian
subcontinent gained independence from Britain in 1947.
	   Pakistan is demanding that Kashmiris on both sides of the
disputed border be allowed to vote on whether a united Kashmir
should go to Pakistan or India. India has rejected such a vote,
saying its sovereignty is non-negotiable.
	   India's only Muslim-dominated state is Jammu-Kashmir. India has
accused Pakistan of arming and training Muslim militants there who
have been waging a bloody secessionist battle since 1989.
	   Islamabad says it gives only moral support to Kashmiri
militants.

Darryl Strawberry sued for allegedly failing to pay legal bills
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ New York Yankees outfielder Darryl Strawberry
is being sued for allegedly failing to pay dlrs 100,000 in legal
fees in 1994.
	   Attorney Robert Shapiro filed the lawsuit in Los Angeles federal
court, claiming the player had failed to pay him for negotiating a
settlement of Strawberry's contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers.
	   Strawberry, 36, was in Montreal, where the Yankees lost to the
Expos 7-5 Thursday. The Yankees were traveling back to New York on
Thursday night and Strawberry could not be reached for comment.
	   Shapiro claims he had an oral contract with Strawberry, who
allegedly agreed to pay the attorney a flat dlrs 100,000 fee to
represent the player in negotiations to become a free agent.
	   ``No part of said sum has been paid,'' the lawsuit said.
	   Shapiro, who helped represent O.J. Simpson during his criminal
trial, is seeking dlrs 100,000, plus 10 percent interest for each
year since February 1995, and court costs.
	   Strawberry also has played for the San Francisco Giants and the
New York Mets, leading the team to the World Series title in 1986
and an NL East championship in 1988. But his long career has been
marred by a federal conviction on tax charges, a 60-day suspension
following a positive drug test, and more trips to court over
spousal support payments.
	   The Dodgers released him in 1994 because of drug and alcohol
problems.

Philippines marks centennial of declaration of independence

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ As brass bands played, President
Fidel Ramos jubilantly waved a Philippine flag from a balcony
Friday in a re-enactment of the country's declaration of
independence from Spain 100 years ago.
	   Church bells pealed throughout the country and government
offices offered free food as Filipinos commemorated the climax of
Asia's first revolution against Western colonial rule.
	   Ramos urged the nation to use its hard-won independence as an
inspiration in overcoming the impact of the current Asian financial
crisis.
	   ``We have successfully won back the dignity of our race and
respect for our country,'' said Ramos, whose term ends June 30.
``We have begun to make our own future.''
	   Ramos waved the flag from the balcony of a house in Kawit town
in Cavite province, south of Manila, where revolutionary leader
Gen. Emilio Aguinaldo proclaimed independence on June 12, 1898.
	   The Philippines was a Spanish possession for 333 years, from
1565 to 1898.
	   More than 30 countries sent representatives to join the
celebration in Kawit and at Manila's Rizal Park, named after
national hero Jose Rizal, who was shot by the Spanish for
advocating equality.
	   The festivities also included a parade depicting the country's
struggle against Spanish colonialism and a massive fireworks
display Friday night over Manila Bay.
	   Leftist groups under the New Patriotic Alliance, however,
planned an ``alternative'' celebration with a protest parade to the
U.S. Embassy.
	   Leaders of the alliance said they are celebrating the end of
Spain's rule in 1898 but also highlighting the United States'
subsequent takeover of the Philippines, which they claimed was
downplayed in the government-sponsored festivities.
	   Ramos, elected in 1992, dismantled monopolies and deregulated
many industries, allowing Filipinos to enjoy economic progress
after years of stagnancy. The reforms helped shield the Philippines
from the worst effects of the regional currency crisis.
	   ``Inspired by the sacrifices of our heroes and fortified by
their values, we the Filipinos of the present generation are
courageously facing the future, confident that we, too, will win
our own battles and triumph over whatever challenge,'' Ramos said
in a speech in Kawit.
	   In 1892, Filipino nationalists established a secret society
called the Katipunan, which prepared for armed rebellion against
Spain.
	   The revolt erupted four years later and spread rapidly through
much of the country.
	   A month before the declaration of independence, U.S. naval
forces destroyed a Spanish armada in Manila Bay in fighting that
followed the outbreak of the Spanish-American war.
	   Spain, still unwilling to hand over power to the Filipino
revolutionaries, ceded the country to the United States for dlrs 20
million in December 1898.
	   The following year, hostilities broke out between Filipino
revolutionaries and American forces sent to occupy the new U.S.
colony. The brief but brutal Philippine-American war is considered
by some historians as the ``first Vietnam'' of the United States.
	   The United States formally granted the Philippines independence
in 1946, but American influence remains strong.

Howard: Victory for Hanson will not damage Australia's image
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALAN THORNHILL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Prime Minister John Howard said
Friday success for Pauline Hanson's right-wing populist One Nation
party at a weekend state election will not damage Australia's
reputation in Asia.
	   Hanson has been controversial in Australia and Asia for
advocating policies to cut Asian migration and investment and halt
special welfare payments to Aborigines.
	   ``The only thing that would really be detrimental to Australia's
international standing would be if people overseas thought the
government of Australia held views that were hostile to them,''
Howard said in a radio interview in Melbourne.
	   Recent polls have predicted Hanson's forces have weakened the
governing conservatives in Queensland state so much that the
opposition Labor Party will win the majority in Parliament, and
government, at the Saturday poll.
	   If the conservatives lose Queensland, partly because Hanson's
ultra-rightist party has cut into their appeal, it is a bad omen
for Howard. He has to call a federal election by March and faces
the same problems with Hanson on a national scale.
	   Howard said Friday he did not want One Nation to win seats
anywhere in Australia and condemned its policies.
	   ``They are totally unacceptable to me,'' he said on Radio 3AW.
	   Howard played down the potential impact of the Queensland
election result on the timing of the national election, due by
March 1999.
	   Howard has been criticized for not refuting Hanson's policies
earlier and more vigorously than he did.
	   But he insisted Friday that he had not made a mistake on the
issue.
	   ``I feel that if I had gone in much harder and the beginning, it
probably would have given her much more prominence and the results
would not have been much different,'' he said.

Two former aides to chief minister face graft charge
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Two senior aides of a former chief
minister facing corruption charges were arraigned Friday for
allegedly misusing their office to favor a company in a huge real
estate deal.
	   One of the officials is alleged to have accepted a bribe of 1.2
million ringgit (dlrs 300,000) to facilitate the 20 million ringgit
(dlrs 5.2 million) deal.
	   The former private secretary and press secretary are accused of
asking the then chief minister of Selangor state, Muhammad Taib, in
1989 to clear the application for land by a company in which the
two had interests, the national news agency Bernama reported.
	   Muhammad, 52, a prominent member of Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad's United Malays National Organization party, is himself
facing trail for not declaring his assets that include properties
overseas.
	   On May 29, a court in Brisbane declared him innocent of
violating Australian laws by carrying more than a million dollars
in foreign currency in his hand luggage during a trip to Australia
in December 1996.
	   On Friday, Murad Ibrahim, 46, and Shamsuddin Merin, 54, pleaded
not guilty to charges and were released on bail. But the court
asked them to hand over their travel documents.
	   If convicted, they face a maximum penalty of 14 years
imprisonment or a fine of 20,000 ringgit (dlrs 5,000) or both.

The yen keeps falling, but Japan may not move to support it
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; TOK101 &QL; 
 &UR; By TODD ZAUN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The yen just keeps plunging against the dollar,
threatening to deepen Asia's economic crisis, deliver a crippling
blow to Japan's ailing banks and force China into a currency
devaluation of its own.
	   But Tokyo's puzzling response _ watch, and wait.
	   The reason, say analysts and traders, is that despite long-term
dangers, the currency's decline has a big short-term benefit: yen
weakness translates directly into higher profits for Japan's export
companies.
	   And with the Japanese public growing increasingly concerned
about the state of their economy, policymakers seem likely to opt
for the quick fix.
	   ``The immediate benefit for the Japanese economy of a falling
yen is actually quite positive,'' said Ken Okamura, a strategist at
Dresdner Kleinwort Benson (Asia) Ltd.
	   ``But there is a fundamental question of whether this going to
spark off a series of problems in other places,'' he said.
	   Japan's currency sank more than two yen-per-dollar Thursday in
U.S. and European markets as traders interpreted comments by U.S.
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin as meaning therre would be no U.S.
support for the sagging yen.
	   It fell further in Tokyo on Friday _ to as low as 144.75 yen to
the dollar _ as traders reasoned that if U.S. officials weren't
worried, Japan was unlikely to do much to stop the fall either.
	   Comments from Japan's policymakers on Friday did little to
change their minds.
	   While Finance Minister Hikaru Matsunaga said he was ready to
take ``decisive action'' to stop the yen from falling too far,
there was no indication such action would come soon.
	   ``When the dollar was at the 130-yen-level, I said I had strong
concern,'' Matsunaga said. ``I am still watching it with strong
concern.''
	   Another influential economic official said he wasn't worried
about yen weakness at all.
	   ``I don't see a negative effect of the weak yen on the Japanese
economy,'' said Koji Omi, Director General of Japan's Economic
Planning Agency, at a regular press conference Friday.
	   Omi suggested that if a weak yen was causing problems elsewhere
that ``leaders of the world economy in Asia, U.S. and Europe should
do whatever is necessary.''
	   The yen's decline has already helped the giant exporters that
power Japan's economy. Honda Motor Co., Canon Inc., and Nintendo
Co. all recently reported double-digit profit growth for the year
ended in March. The profits were due, in large part, to the
dollar's gain against the yen last year.
	   A rising dollar and falling yen helps exporters by making their
products cheaper, and therefore more popular, in overseas markets.
Even if they don't lower prices in foreign markets, profits earned
there become more valuable in terms of the home currency when the
yen falls.
	   But economists say that further yen weakness would make Japan's
exporters so competitive that they'll begin to clobber exporters
from elsewhere in Asia and China, which has so far avoided a
currency devaluation.
	   If yen weakness forces China to lower the value of its yuan,
market watchers worry they'll see a whole new round of devastating
devaluations sweep through Asia as countries knock down the value
of their currencies to keep their exporters competitive.
	   Stocks in South Korea and Hong Kong sank once again Friday as
such concerns spread. The day before, China's Foreign Ministry
spokesman Zhu Bangzao warned that the weakening yen could
destabilize still shaky financial markets around the region.
	   The falling yen also creates dangers closer to home.
	   Japanese banks, already struggling with mountains of bad
real-estate loans at home, are the biggest foreign lenders in Asia
and could be severely hurt if economies there sink further,
analysts said.

Report: Police say opposition gatherings are seditious
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with opposition comment

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysian police have said that
public gatherings by opposition groups are not permitted because
they would discuss seditious issues and question the nation's
judiciary, a newspaper reported Friday.
	   A meeting of the main opposition group, the Democratic Action
Party, was disbanded by police Wednesday night because some
speakers had ridiculed the judiciary, Police Spokesman Ghazali Amin
was quoted as saying by Friday's Star newspaper.
	   ``The police view cases under the Sedition Act very seriously as
the existence of this act is to prevent any hostility and disorder
in a multi-racial society like Malaysia,'' he said.
	   ``The issues raised also discredited the integrity of the
judiciary. The issues have a seditions tendency and can be
classified under Section 3(1)(c) of the Sedition Act 1948,'' said
another police official, Yaacob M. Amin.
	   Despite the police ban, Malaysia's main opposition party has
vowed to press ahead with meetings. A meeting in the southern town
of Johor was held Thursday night without problems because it had a
previous police clearance, said party chief Lim Kit Siang.
	   Four party leaders, including deputy secretary general Lim Guan
Eng, were briefly arrested at Wednesday's dinner meeting.
	   The gathering was organized to generate sympathy for Lim, who
recently received two concurrent 18-month jail sentences for
sedition and violating a publishing act. He is appealing against
the convictions.
	   If police view expression of support for Lim Guan as sedition
then ``it is a sad day for Malaysia,'' said Lim Kit Siang, the
convicted leader's father.
	   Dubbing demands for reform as sedition would make many
Malaysians guilty of the offense, he said.
	   It was the fourth time in two weeks that police have broken up
opposition gatherings, prompting accusations of a clampdown on free
speech.
	   But authorities have denied there was a blanket ban saying these
meetings were not permitted because they could have jeopardized
public peace and security.

Economist: Give up tariff protection to help ride out Asian crisis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Warning that Australia is yet to feel
the worst of the Asian financial crisis, a leading economist Friday
urged the government to implement tariff cuts and other domestic
reforms.
	   With more than half of all exports going to Asia, the regional
downturn will have a drastic impact on Australia, Prof. David
Robertson of the Melbourne Business School said.
	   ``The outlook for Australian trade, at this stage, is bleak,''
he told a business seminar. ``It's bleak for goods, for services
and for tourism.''
	   Robertson said the recent fall in the value of the Australian
dollar could make Europe a more attractive market for Australian
goods.
	   ``Europe takes four percent of our exports, so there's plenty of
scope, but it's going to be a monstrous increase if it's going to
counterbalance what's going on in Asia,'' he said.
	   The best way for Australia to ride out the crisis is to urgently
wind back industry assistance such as tariffs and to reform the
domestic economy, he said.
	   The federal government has announced it will freeze at 15
percent tariffs for the car industry for five years from 2000 and
at 10 to 25 percent for the textiles, clothing and footwear
industries.

 &UR; Eds: RECASTS; UPDATEs with Barbara Streisand tour canceled and
interest rates up because of slump, dollar recovering slightly and
stocks falling, edits to conform &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ The Australian dollar's fall in value
to 12-year lows is starting to be felt in Australians' hip-pockets,
as home mortgage lenders raise interest rates and promoters warn of
canceled tours and increased prices.
	   A concert tour by Hollywood star Barbara Streisand is the latest
casualty of the growing gulf between the Australian and the U.S.
dollars, according to a music industry promoter.
	   ``It's common knowledge now that the Streisand tour has been
canceled, and that the dollar fall is the reason,'' the promoter
told Dow Jones Newswires, on condition of anonymity. ``It was a
very low (profit) margin tour anyway before the rot set in.''
	   The value of the Australia dollar has fallen 10 percent to
around 58.8 U.S. cents in 1998, and is down around 24 percent from
75.5 U.S. cents in mid-1997.
	   Until this week, the effect on the man-in-the-street had been
limited largely to consumers of imported commodities and tourists
traveling to regions outside crisis-hit Asia, such as the United
States and Europe.
	   But three banks on Thursday announced they will raise interest
rates on home loans, and other banks said they were reviewing their
rates in the wake of the dollar's fall.
	   Concert promoters say ticket prices for international touring
acts will rise. Depreciation increases the cost in
Australian-dollar terms to stage productions and reduces revenue
from ticket sales in foreign currency terms.
	   The Australian dollar resumed its slide Friday after a rebound
the day before was cut short by a sharply lower yen and gold prices
overnight. It recovered slightly and in local afternoon trading was
worth 58.93 U.S. cents, above its intraday low of 58.32 U.S. cents.
	   Stock prices have joined the dollar in declining on continuing
concerns about the weakness of regional stock markets and
currencies.
	   On Thursday, the Australian bourse closed lower for the eighth
consecutive day, to finish at 2558.7. Traders said they would be
surprised if Friday's close was not down again.
	   At one point Friday, the market's leading indicator, the All
Ordinaries Index, was down 19.8 points, or nearly 8 percent, to
2538.9.
	   The New Zealand dollar also recovered Friday to around 50 U.S.
cents at the close of local trade, up from a low of 49.44 U.S.
cents.
	   The NZSE-40 capital index finished lower, at 1997, but clawed
back from a low of 1955. It is the first time the index has closed
below the 2000 point level since early April 1995.
	   Dealers said the Australian and New Zealand currencies would
continue to be sold as long as the yen and gold prices were under
pressure.

Deputy prime minister says government making good on coal promises
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Deputy Prime Minister Boris Nemtsov said Friday
that the government was making good on its pledges to support the
coal industry, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported Friday.
	   Nemtsov spoke with reporters on the second day of a miners'
protest outside the seat of government in Moscow, the White House.
	   About 200 coal miners from four mining regions arrived in Moscow
by train on Thursday to protest unpaid wages and call for the
resignation of President Boris Yeltsin _ the man they had supported
wholeheartedly in 1989 and 1991, when he was fighting for his
political survival.
	   ``Answer us, Boris: Why are we dying in the mines for free?''
read the banner they held as they marched 10 kilometers (6 miles)
through the capital to the White House, where they planned to
picket 24 hours a day.
	   Nemtsov said Friday that 205.5 million (dlrs 34.25 million) had
been transferred from the federal budget to the miners of Vorkuta
and Inta, in the Far North, during the first five months of 1998,
ITAR-Tass said. He said that allocation was 80 million rubles (dlrs
13.3 million) more than during the same period in the previous
year.
	   Nemtsov also pointed out the steps the government was taking to
help the industry as a whole, including decreasing rail transport
costs, which should lead to 3 billion rubles (dlrs 600,000) in
savings to coal companies, and ending abuse of office by coal
company managers and middlemen who overcharge for their delivery
services.

 &UR; Japan's economy in recession; GDP figures show negative growth

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan confirmed Friday that it has sunk into
recession, announcing that's its gross domestic product shrank for
a second consecutive quarter.
	   The Economic Planning Agency said Japan's real gross domestic
product between January and March of this year fell 1.3 percent
from the previous quarter. Last quarter, the economy shrank 0.2
percent.
	   Two back-to-back quarters of negative growth is generally
accepted as the definition of a recession.
	   The results for the quarter tipped growth for the entire fiscal
year into negative territory for the first time in more than two
decades.

<TEXT>
	   The agency said Japan's gross domestic product, the sum of all
goods and services produced, shrank 0.7 percent for the fiscal year
ended March 31, 1998.
	   The last time Japan's economy contracted during an entire year
was in 1974.
	   This is the third time the world's second-largest economy slid
into recession since 1992, economists said.
	   Japan's economy is still struggling to overcome the effects of a
collapse in land and stock prices in the early 1990s.
	   The crash left Japan's banking industry burdened with failed
loans that the government now estimates total about 76 trillion yen
(dlrs 531 billion).
	   And just as Japan's economy was finally showing signs of a
fragile recovery early in 1997, the government smothered growth
with an ill-timed tax increase in April of last year.
	   A series of high-profile bankruptcies has also spooked
consumers, who started spending less and saving more.
	   But the final nail in the coffin was the regionwide economic
crisis that started in Thailand last July.
	   Japan has been hit harder by the meltdown than other developed
nations because it lent and exported more to its Asian neighbors. A
recession in Japan bodes ill for the rest of Asia, which had been
counting on the region's economic powerhouse to lift it out of the
crisis.
	   In another sign of Japan's ailing domestic economy, a private
research agency said Friday that corporate bankruptcies in May
soared by more then a third from the previous month.
	   The Teikoku Databank said the number of business failures was up
37.5 percent. The amount of debt left behind by bankruptcies in May
grew to 781 billion yen (dlrs 5.5 billion), the highest since World
War Two.
	   Japan's poor economic outlook drove the yen to an eight-year low
against the U.S. dollar Friday in Tokyo, and the benchmark stock
average briefly dropped below the psychologically important
15,000-point level for the first time since January.
	   The dollar bought 144.04 yen at mid-afternoon, soaring 2.36 yen
above Thursday's close in Tokyo. The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average
dropped to 14,865.98 at midday but closed at 15,022.33, up 8.29.

Ethiopians to bury civilians killed in Eritrean bombing
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By AZIM SAYYID &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ADIGRAT, Ethiopia (AP) _ Ethiopians prepared Friday to bury four
people killed in an Eritrean bomb attack, while another 30 writhed
in pain from shrapnel wounds at a hospital.
	   The Eritrean government said in a statement it bombed the
northeastern border town of Adigrat because the Ethiopians had
turned it into ``the main garrison for reinforcing the invading
Ethiopian army and a center for army logistics.''
	   Ground fighting also flared on two fronts Thursday, as Rwandan
and U.S. officials returned to Ethiopia to promote a peace plan.
	   Eritrean helicopters and warplanes dropped at least eight bombs
on Adigrat on Thursday evening. Two of the bombs hit a combined
industrial-residential area in the town of 40,000, setting grain
warehouses on fire.
	   Four people were killed and more than 30 wounded, said Emmanuel
Gesese, a doctor at the local hospital. Late Thursday, they lined
the hospital corridors, waiting for treatment.
	   The dead were to be buried Friday.
	   Adigrat is about 20 kilometers (12 miles) southwest of Zala
Ambessa, the border town captured by Eritrean forces last week.
Eritreans said it was being used to supply the Ethiopian
counter-offensive on Zala Ambessa.
	   They also accused Ethiopia of provoking the air attack by
bombing Asmara's military-civilian airport on June 5 and 6. A week
after those attacks, Eritrean Foreign Ministry said for the first
time that four civilians had been killed and 26 wounded in the
bombings.
	   Journalists at the airport in the immediate aftermath of the
bombings saw only a handful of wounded, and diplomats reported just
one dead. At the nearest hospital, Halibet, six people, including
one civilian, were being treated for their wounds Thursday.
	   Ground clashes broke out Thursday in the region of Eritrea's
crucial Red Sea port of Assab _ an area that had not seen previous
fighting _ and in the Yirga triangle area where the conflict began
May 6.
	   The Eritrean government reported Friday that fighting at Assab
had subsided, and the Ethiopian army had been pushed back.
	   Eritrean rebels fought Ethiopia for 30 years to gain
independence. They succeeded in 1993, two years after helping
Ethiopian rebels under Meles Zenawi _ who is now prime minister _
oust a 17-year military dictatorship.
	   Rwandan Vice President and Defense Minister Paul Kagame, whose
country along with the United States has authored a peace plan,
returned to Addis Ababa on Thursday. There was no indication
whether the presence of Kagame, Rwanda's de facto leader, indicated
an advance in the plan's prospects.
	   Ethiopia has already voiced support for the plan, which calls
for Eritrea to retreat to the positions it held before fighting
broke out. Eritrea has said the plan needs more work, specifically
that details are needed on how the disputed border would be
demarcated.
	   Regional military sources say the plan calls for Rwanda to
supply peacekeepers to enforce demilitarization of the disputed
border regions.

	   TUCSON, Arizona (AP) _ Canada's Brent Crowther shut out the
United States 1-0 Tuesday night in the second game of their
five-game baseball series.
	   Crowther scattered eight hits in handing the Americans their
first loss in six games. USA beat Canada 20-3 Wednesday night after
sweeping a four-game series with Mexico.
	   Crowther went the route while striking out two batters, walking
none and retiring 20 of the last 25 batters he faced.
	   Dominic Campeau scored Canada's run on a second-inning single by
Kyle Brunen.
	   Matt Smith of the United States suffered the loss.
	   USA swept the teams' last previous series, three games in 1995.

U.S. dollar surges against yen, Tokyo stocks steady
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with afternoon dollar and bond rates and closing stock
prices

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar rose to near an eight-year high
against the yen Friday after comments from a top U.S. finance
official overnight convinced traders a coordinated international
effort to strengthen the yen was unlikely.
	   A last-minute rally left Tokyo stocks little changed from the
previous day's close.
	   The dollar bought 144.04 yen at midafternoon, up 2.36 yen from
late Thursday in Tokyo and also above its late New York rate of
143.79 yen overnight.
	   At one point, the dollar was quoted as high as 144.75 yen in
Tokyo, matching its most recent previous high on August 30, 1990.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average
gained 8.29 points, or 0.06 percent, to close at 15,022.33. On
Thursday, the average closed down 325.22 points, or 2.12 percent.
	   The yen's decline began overnight following comments by U.S.
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin that were interpreted as signaling
no U.S. effort to support Japan's ailing yen.
	   Rubin, testifying before the Senate Finance Committee on
Thursday, reiterated that Japan must revive its ailing economy,
warning that ``Japan's economic difficulties and weak currency are
having substantial adverse impact on the East Asian countries.''
	   Rubin said it will be up to Japan to halt the yen's slide.
	   In Tokyo, Japanese finance minister Hikaru Matsunaga said Friday
that Japan was ready to take decisive action against an excessive
weakening of the yen.
	   He said Japan's partners from the Group of Seven nations were
also ready to cooperate on such action.
	   ``The G-7 said at their April Washington meeting that they are
ready to communicate and cooperate if there is a sharp change in
foreign exchange,'' he told a regular press conference.
	   Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto said Friday morning he does not
think the dollar at 144 yen reflects Japanese economic
fundamentals.
	   ``The fact that a situation like this continues shows that the
U.S. isn't interested in talking about current account balance
issues,'' Hashimoto told reporters.
	   The yen's decline hurt bank, oil and steel shares but boosted
shares of exporters which enjoy increased earnings as the yen falls
against foreign currencies.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section of the exchange fell 1.56 points, or 0.13 percent, to
1,1177.25 points. The TOPIX closed down 19.79 points, or 1.65
percent, the day before.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond fell to 1.210 percent from Thursday's finish of
1.245 percent, driving its price up to 111.94 yen from 111.68 yen.

	   AGRA, India (AP) _ Greenpeace protesters chose India's most
recognizable monument _ the Taj Mahal _ as the site of a protest
Friday, floating an Earth-shaped hot air balloon draped with
anti-nuclear banners about 200 meters (yards) from the 345-year-old
tomb.
	   Greenpeace spokeswoman Luisa Colasimone said about 30 soldiers
surrounded the balloon when it touched down after the protest in a
field across a river from the Taj Mahal. She said four protesters
were being detained, but it was not clear whether they would be
arrested.
	   Indian authorities can be zealous about protecting the tomb
known worldwide as a monument to love. The Supreme Court recently
ordered nearby factories to close because pollution is blamed for
yellowing the Taj Mahal's white marble walls. Last year, musician
Yanni was required to keep the volume down at an outdoor concert
held nearby for fear noise vibrations would worsen cracks that have
begun to show on the monument.

Twelve East Timorese political prisoners released

	   DILI, Indonesia (AP) _ Walking out of a prison in
Indonesian-controlled East Timor on Friday, a dozen political
prisoners raised their fists and vowed to renew the
pro-independence activism that landed them in jail in the first
place.
	   The prisoners, many of them students, were freed under a pardon
granted by President B.J. Habibie, who is seeking a solution to the
bitter conflict that has plagued East Timor since Indonesia invaded
in 1975 and annexed the territory a year later.
	   In Jakarta, the Indonesian capital, more than 1,000 East
Timorese protesters gathered at the Foreign Ministry to press for a
vote on independence in the former Portuguese colony. Some entered
the main building and sat in the lobby.
	   Shouting separatist slogans, the 12 prisoners filed out of
Becora prison in the East Timorese capital of Dili with plastic
bags full of clothes and other belongings. One man clutched a
chicken.
	   ``This freedom is good for our struggle. It's a victory for
us,'' said Tomas Augusto Correia, a 33-year-old municipal worker
who was among the detainees. Most of the prisoners were students
who were arrested for demonstrating against Indonesian authority.
	   However, the conciliatory gesture from Habibie's reform-minded
government failed to satisfy the demonstrators in Jakarta and other
East Timorese who are demanding the release of Xanana Gusmao, a
separatist rebel leader who was arrested in 1992.
	   Habibie is also reluctant to yield to demands for a referendum
on independence in East Timor, instead offering special status that
might include some autonomy.
	   Gusmao, 52, who is serving a 20-year sentence in a Jakarta
prison, is beloved by many East Timorese who see him as a symbol of
their struggle against Indonesian rule. His rebel group, known as
Fretilin, has dwindled over the years and its fighters carry out
only occasional hit-and-run attacks before retreating to remote
mountain refuges.
	   The government has yet to make clear what it plans to do with
Gusmao, whose case has attracted international attention, including
a plea from South African President Nelson Mandela for his release.
	   East Timorese activist and 1996 Nobel Peace Prize co-winner Jose
Ramos-Horta said the prize should have gone to Gusmao. The
charismatic rebel chief has a sharp sense of humor and a fondness
for poetry. His wife and son live in Sydney, where they are active
in the East Timorese separatist movement.
	   Many in the Indonesian military, however, regard Gusmao as a
violent criminal responsible for the deaths of many comrades. Tens
of thousands of East Timorese also died during Indonesia's efforts
to wipe out resistance in the 1970s.
	   On Thursday, the prisoners in Dili refused to leave the jail,
saying they wanted freedom for Gusmao. They agreed to go Friday
after giving wardens a litany of complaints, ranging from the poor
quality of prison food to military repression.
	   Most were serving one- or two-year sentences, and some were due
to leave jail anyway in the coming days.
	   ``Viva East Timor,'' they chanted. Before catching buses to
their homes, some vowed to attend a pro-independence demonstration
planned this weekend in Dili.

Tree plagues destroying China's forests
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Infestations of various pests have destroyed
millions of hectares (acres) of Chinese forests, causing at least 5
billion yuan (dlrs 602 million) in losses of timber resources every
year, the state-run China Daily reported Friday.
	   The State Forest Administration reported that forests in China's
northern, northwestern, eastern and southwestern regions face a
``massive bug plague,'' it said.
	   The report said that pine and poplar species were hit especially
hard, with 8 million hectares (19.7 million acres) of forests
damaged each year.
	   China has reforested vast regions of the country that had been
denuded over the centuries in a belated attempt to control erosion
and reestablish its timber resources. But those man-made forests,
often planted in a single species, are more vulnerable to pests
than naturally occurring forests, it said.
	   The report urged local governments to take more active measures
to prevent the spread of insects and disease.

Year of Tiger becomes Year of Recession for Asia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Tokyo announcement on recession
 &UR; AP Graphic ASIA RECESSIONS
 &UR; By BETH DUFF-BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The Year of the Tiger, according
to Chinese superstition, can bring ferocious upheaval.
	   Six months into this tiger year, the once roaring Asian
economies have experienced plenty of that. Several have fallen
deeper into recession, a half dozen are slumping in that direction.
	   With Japan announcing Friday its first year of negative growth
in more than two decades, the deflation of Asia's economic role
model could push its proteges over the edge.
	   ``The announcement will have a negative impact,'' said Rajeev
Malik, regional economist at Jardine Fleming International
Securities in Singapore. ``I think the most immediate is likely to
be felt in the currency markets.''
	   Tokyo's announcement that gross domestic product between January
and March of this year fell 1.3 percent comes in the wake of
Wednesday's sell-off in Asian stock and currency markets, which
plunged after the U.S. dollar climbed to a seven-year high against
the bellwether yen.
	   Economic confidence in Asia generally suffers when the yen takes
a beating, even though regional currencies may not be directly
pegged to the Japanese currency.
	   The first of the Asian dominoes to fall, Thailand has been in
recession since last year, when its economy shrank by 0.4 percent,
compared to 5.5 percent growth in 1996.
	   Next was Indonesia, also in full-blown recession. Before the
deadly student riots last month that led to the fall of President
Suharto, analysts were already predicting an economic contraction
of 10 percent. Some are now forecasting negative growth of 25
percent this year.
	   Market analysts also put South Korea in recession. The Korean
economy is expected to shrink by more than 1 percent this year,
which would be the first contraction since 1980.
	   Hong Kong's economy eroded by 2 percent in the quarter ending in
March, the first negative growth in 13 years.
	   Malaysia and Singapore are both denying they're headed toward
recession, if you go by the standard definition of a recession: two
consecutive quarters of contracting growth.
	   Some economists say you can't always use this yardstick because
the growth rates in some countries, such as Malaysia, have been so
high.
	   ``When your economy slows down from 8 percent to 1 or 2 percent
that is, for all practical purposes, a recession,'' Malik said.
	   Malaysia's central bank announced last month that GDP shrank by
1.8 percent in the first quarter, the first quarterly contraction
since the mid-1980s.
	   Chia Yew Boon, research director at Singapore-based Santander
Investment Securities, said a policy split within government has
created uncertainty that is hurting Malaysia's chances of quick
recovery. Chia expects the economy to shrink by 3.8 percent this
year, compared with economic growth of 7.8 percent in 1997.
	   While Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad has called loudly for
lower interest rates to help troubled businesses, the central bank
and Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, who is also finance
minister, are adamant about keeping interest rates at current
levels.
	   Bruce Gale, regional manager of the Hong Kong-based Political
and Economic Risk Consultancy, said Japan's announcement could
badly bruise Singapore and Malaysia.
	   ``Malaysia's been very much looking to Japan to be a leader in
the region and to help Malaysia out with some of its short-term
financing,'' Gale said.
	   Mahathir returned last Friday from Tokyo and said he expected to
get dlrs 1 billion-dlrs 2 billion worth of loans in yen, a prospect
made less likely if Japan tightens its financial belt.
	   Singapore's growth for the first quarter of 1998 was 5.6
percent, but the figure is considered artificial because the first
quarter of 1997 was unusually depressed.
	   ``Singapore is highly vulnerable despite its good economic
management,'' said Gale. ``It's extremely vulnerable to a downturn
in trade, which is going to result from the negative growth in
Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand.''
	   The Philippines has escaped the worst of the Asian crisis.
Though economic growth slowed this first quarter to 2.5 percent
from 5.4 percent, no recession is expected.
	   Bitter enemies China and Taiwan have also stayed afloat amid the
sinking economies. Taiwan is predicting GDP growth of 6 percent
this year, down only 0.8 percent from last year.
	   China's Foreign Trade Minister Shi Guangsheng said Tuesday that
currency devaluations in Southeast Asian countries had weakened the
competitiveness of China's exports, but that China hoped to
maintain its 8-percent growth prediction for the year.
	   Economist Malik doesn't believe the smaller Asian economies can
do much to save themselves. He believes they need a comprehensive
debt-relief package similar to that in Latin America in the 1980s.
	   ``Debt forgiveness is what these countries need,'' he said.
``Short of insuring transparency and eliminating policy
contradictions, there is very little these countries can do on
their own.''

	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Sri Lanka went to lunch at 88 for four
wickets, a lead of 101 runs on day three of the third and final
cricket Test at the Sinhalese Sports Club on Friday.
	   At the wicket were skipper Arjuna Ranatunga on 41 and Hashan
Tillekeratne on 17. The pair came together with Sri Lanka tottering
on 36 for four wickets, and have so far put on 52 to rebuild the
inning.
	   Sri Lanka started the day disastrously, losing star opener
Sanath Jayasuriya for eight, caught behind off paceman Chris
Cairns.
	   Left-arm spinner Daniel Vettori then picked up three quick
wickets, those of Marvan Atapattu (5), Aravinda de Silva (3), and
Mahela Jayawardena (11).
	   Atapattu was beaten by a ball which kept low, de Silva was
caught at mid-off by Nathan Astle, and Mathew Horne held on to a
brilliant catch at mid-wicket to dismiss Jayawardena. Vettori has
taken three wickets for 16 runs off 12 overs.
	   With eight sessions to go, either side could win and take the
series, which is tied 1-1.

Frustrated Hungarians yank their kids from schools in Slovakia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ Tensions that have their roots in
the Austro-Hungarian Empire have erupted in a wave of school
protests by Hungarians living in Slovakia.
	   Accusing the government of blatant disregard of the nation's
largest minority, ethnic Hungarian parents have pulled their
children from school in one-day protests in several regions _ the
latest on Friday.
	   The boycott was prompted by an education bill in parliament
that, if approved as expected, would require Hungarian children to
drop Hungarian-language history classes and learn history and
geography in Slovak language instead. But the overriding issue,
according to the parents, is the government's consistently unfair
treatment of Hungarians.
	   ``We want our children to learn the Slovak language properly,
but we want them to remain Hungarian,'' said Ladislav Durkovsky, a
leader of the Association of Hungarian Parents in Slovakia.
	   ``The state wants them to lose their national identity,'' he
said.
	   Friday's protests by Hungarians in the Galanta and Moldava
regions followed a similar one last week in Komarno.
	   While relations between most Slovaks and Hungarians are fine,
some tensions remain from the centuries Slovaks were under
Hungarian rule _ until the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire
in 1918.
	   When Slovakia finally gained independence five years ago in the
split from Czech-dominated Czechoslovakia, 600,000 ethnic
Hungarians found themselves in an entirely new situation in the
country of 5.3 million. Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar, widely
denounced abroad for his authoritarian rule, has been repeatedly
criticized by the European Union for unfair treatment of Hungarian
nationals.
	   Hungarian parents already were angry, Durkovsky said, because
they saw the state ``constantly attacking their fundamental rights
with arrogance, using the state budget and the state machinery.''
That was before the nationalist Slovak National Party (SNS)
proposed the new bill earlier this year.
	   The politicians who proposed it argue that the children should
learn the culture of their adopted land.
	   ``We want to give these kids a proper education,'' Vitazoslav
Moric, a leading member of the SNS, said.
	   ``Honestly speaking, I do not care about the Hungarian children
the least bit,'' said Vitazoslav Moric, a leading member of the
SNS. ``I care about this state. This state, in order to be well
off, needs educated citizens.''
	   The parents fear the only thing the bill will achieve is to push
their kids further behind, as they are still learning the Slovak
language in five classes a week.

NATO confers with Russians on Kosovo

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen
and his NATO colleagues are conferring with Russia on the
alliance's efforts to curb Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's
drive against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo province.
	   Cohen and Russian Defense Minister Gen. Igor Sergeyev were
meeting at NATO headquarters Friday, followed by NATO talks with
the Russian minister.
	   Russia opposes military options NATO is considering for the
Serbian province.
	   NATO Secretary General Javier Solana said Thursday that Russia
advised the alliance it would not participate in NATO's plans for
an air exercise over Albania and Macedonia. The alliance hopes the
show of military strength can persuade Milosevic to halt attacks on
ethnic Albanian separatists in Kosovo.
	   ``We would like to have as many partners as possible participate
in the exercise,'' Solana said of his NATO allies.
	   Russia, which has been brought into some NATO consultations, had
been kept informed of plans for potential military exercises in the
Balkans and at one time had ``showed an interest in
participating,'' Solana said. That was before the most recent
outbreak of violence in Kosovo and NATO's announcement of its air
maneuvers.
	   Moscow favors strengthened control over Kosovo's borders with
Albania and Macedonia. Russia could play a pivotal role in the
persuading Milosevic to turn around the crisis in the
independence-minded province of Serbia, Yugoslavia's dominant
republic.
	   On Thursday, NATO ministers approved a package they hope will
persuade Milosevic to pull back his Serb-led army and police forces
in the province.
	   ``President Milosevic would be rash and foolish if he would
ignore the message coming from NATO,'' said British Defense
Secretary George Robertson. ``The message is clear and unambiguous:
`Belgrade, think again.'''
	   Under the measures, NATO will conduct simulated air attacks in
Albania and Macedonia, probably next week, and study options for
further actions ranging from accelerated planning for military
exercises to direct air strikes inside Yugoslavia and use of ground
troops.
	   This is aimed at persuading Milosevic to do three things:
declare a cease-fire in Kosovo; withdraw his forces and end the
repression of the ethnic Albanians; and open serious negotiations
with the opposition.
	   ``We will be holding exercises in the region, including
immediately an air exercise which will demonstrate NATO's
capability to rapidly project power into the region,'' Solana said.
	   German Defense Minister Volker Ruehe said: ``We cannot afford
any longer to focus on hollow solutions of rather symbolic
character like border security missions in Albania or Macedonia.''
	   It was not clear whether the demonstration of NATO power would
be sufficient to persuade Milosevic.
	   ``I don't think anyone can predict what will impress or persuade
Mr. Milosevic,'' said Cohen. But he said a demonstration of
firepower would have ``some educational value.''
	   A senior U.S. defense official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the exercises will be carried out in the next few
days and could include simulated bombing raids by NATO planes and
rocket attacks by helicopters. Details were being worked out.
	   ``This is the threat of force to back up diplomacy,'' said
Robertson. ``Just as it was in the Gulf, so it is in Kosovo.''
	   Added French Defense Minister Alain Richard: ``We can't let the
protagonists believe that we are prepared to stop at a certain
stage.''
	   More than 250 people have died in clashes between government
forces and the Kosovo Liberation Army, armed wing of the Albanian
independence movement. Ethnic Albanians comprise 90 percent of the
province's population.
	   Milosevic is meeting with President Boris Yeltsin during a
two-day visit to Moscow next week, the Russian presidential press
service said Thursday.
	   Yeltsin invited Milosevic to Russia to discuss the Balkan
situation, including the crisis in Kosovo, the ITAR-Tass news
agency said. Milosevic will be in Russian capital Monday and
Tuesday.

U.S. government pays compensation to Okinawan rape victim
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The United States has paid compensation to an
Okinawan schoolgirl raped by American servicemen in 1995, a crime
that led to mass protests against the U.S. military in Japan, a
Japanese official said Friday.
	   The United States and Japan agreed on a compensation figure in
March, and the Japanese government also paid the girl separate
compensation, said Tadakazu Ukita of the Defense Facilities
Administration Agency.
	   Ukita would not say how much the girl was given. The girl
recieved the money after the March agreement from the Japanese
government, which was then reimbursed by the U.S. government in
May.
	   Three U.S. servicemen abducted and raped the 12-year-old girl on
Okinawa, Japan's southernmost main prefecture, in September 1995.
The three were convicted in 1996 and given jail terms ranging from
6 1/2 years to 7 years.
	   The rape exacerbated the already bitter sentiments against the
heavy U.S. military presence on the island, which houses more than
half of the 47,000 U.S. troops stationed in Japan.
	   In response to a string of protests, the U.S. government agreed
to close the Futenma Marine Air Station on Okinawa over the next
several years on condition that an alternative heliport be built
elsewhere.
	   Okinawa, one of the bloodiest battlegrounds of World War II, has
become an important strategic location for U.S. bases, close to
China, the Korean Peninsula and Southeast Asia.

Death toll in cyclone crosses 700, exodus begins from villages

	   BOMBAY, India (AP) _ For poor villagers in western India, the
disaster of a cyclone that killed at least 727 people was followed
by desperate shortages that forced them Friday on to mud-choked
roads in search of food and drinking water.
	   The death toll Friday stood at 706 in the hardest-hit state of
Gujarat, as workers continued to find bodies flung on power cables
and trees or buried in sludge left behind by a tidal wave three
days after the cyclone hit land.
	   The cyclone weakened Wednesday as it moved north, leaving nine
more dead in Rajasthan state and 12 more in neighboring Pakistan.
	   At least eight entire villages and three camps for salt factory
workers were wiped out near Kandla port, 530 kilometers (330 miles)
northwest of Bombay.
	   The workers earn their living selling salt left behind after sea
water they collect in pans, or shallow pools, evaporates.
	   Soldiers and government officials distributed food and water and
helicopters airdropped packages, but supplies weren't coming
quickly enough.
	   ``The poor are leaving what is left of their homes and walking
to the next village in search of something to eat,'' said survivor
Tejabhai Desai by telephone from Madhabar, a village near Kandla.
	   ``All the water around here is salty. People can't even drink
the rain water that has collected,'' Desai said.
	   Prices have sky rocketed due to scarcity _ bottled water went
from 10 rupees to 50 (about 23 U.S. cents to dlrs 1.25) in a
country where many people get by on the equivalent of dlrs 1 a day.
	   Fifteen villages remained inaccessible. The army was assisting
government workers in clearing roads blocked by fallen trees and
debris whipped up by winds of up to 100 kph (65 mph) when the
cyclone first hit land in Gujarat.
	   Mass cremations of unclaimed bodies continued Friday because
decaying corpses could not be preserved for identification by
relatives.
	   Although 20,000 people from other villages on the Arabian Sea
coast were evacuated by the government, but officials said the
forecast did not indicate the cyclone would touch the Kandla
region.
	   ``The rains came first and people rushed to bar doors and
windows. Then with heavy winds came the wall of water. It was 16
feet (five meters) high and buried everything. Only few of us could
claw out by then,'' said Desai.

	   PARIS (AP) _ Up to a dozen masked men attacked the home of
world-renowned perfumer Jean-Paul Guerlain early Friday, shooting
him in the thigh and making off with millions of francs in silver,
jewels and money, French radio reported.
	   An employee was shot in the chest, according to France Info
radio.
	   According to several accounts, the gang, armed with hunting
rifles and other weapons, broke into Guerlain's home in the
Yvelines region west of Paris, about 3 a.m. After the shootout,
they made off with their booty in a large car.
	   The account could not be immediately confirmed. Further
information was not immediately available.
	   On Thursday night, Guerlain presented his new perfume,
``Guerlinade,'' at a show on the Champs-Elysees, the famed Paris
avenue.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ The yen keeps plunging against the dollar,
threatening to deepen Asia's economic crisis, deliver a crippling
blow to Japan's ailing banks and force China into a currency
devaluation of its own.
	   Tokyo's puzzling response has been to watch and wait.
	   The reason, say analysts and traders, is that despite long-term
dangers, the currency's decline has a big short-term benefit: a
weak yen means higher profits for Japan's export companies.
	   Japan's currency sank more than two yen-per-dollar Thursday in
U.S. and European markets, with traders interpreting comments by
U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin as meaning there would be no
U.S. support for the sagging yen.
	   It fell further in Tokyo on Friday _ to as low as 144.75 yen to
the dollar. Traders reasoned that if U.S. officials weren't
worried, Japan was unlikely to do much to stop the fall either.
	   Comments from Japan's policymakers on Friday _ the same day
Japan announced it had sunk into a recession _ did little to change
their minds.
	   Finance Minister Hikaru Matsunaga said he was ready to take
``decisive action'' to stop the yen from falling too far, but there
was no indication such action would come soon.
	   Another influential economic official said he wasn't worried
about yen weakness at all.
	   ``I don't see a negative effect of the weak yen on the Japanese
economy,'' Koji Omi, Director General of Japan's Economic Planning
Agency, said Friday at a regular press conference.
	   Omi suggested that if a weak yen was causing problems elsewhere,
``leaders of the world economy in Asia, U.S. and Europe should do
whatever is necessary.''
	   The yen's decline already has helped the giant exporters that
power Japan's economy. Honda Motor Co., Canon Inc. and Nintendo Co.
recently reported double-digit profit growth for the year ending in
March. The profits were due, in large part, to the dollar's gain
against the yen last year.
	   A rising dollar and falling yen helps exporters by making their
products cheaper and more popular in overseas markets. Even if
prices aren't lowered in foreign markets, profits earned there
become more valuable in terms of the home currency when the yen
falls.
	   But economists say that further yen weakness could make Japan's
exporters so competitive that they'll begin to clobber exporters
from elsewhere in Asia and China, which has so far avoided a
currency devaluation.
	   If yen weakness forces China to lower the value of its yuan,
market watchers worry they'll see a whole new round of devastating
devaluations sweep through Asia as countries knock down the value
of their currencies to keep their exporters competitive.
	   The falling yen also creates dangers closer to home.
	   Japanese banks, already struggling with mountains of bad
real-estate loans at home, are the biggest foreign lenders in Asia
and could be severely hurt if economies there sink further,
analysts said.
	   ``The immediate benefit for the Japanese economy of a falling
yen is actually quite positive,'' said Ken Okamura, a strategist at
Dresdner Kleinwort Benson (Asia) Ltd. ``But there is a fundamental
question of whether this is going to spark off a series of problems
in other places.''

US-Japan insurance talks end unresolved
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Talks between Japan and the United States on
opening Japanese insurance markets to foreign competitors ended
Friday without bridging the differences between the two sides, the
Finance Ministry said.
	   Washington and Tokyo disagree over whether Japan is living up to
commitments to deregulate its life and non-life insurance sectors
under a 1996 pact.
	   Under the deal, the United States had sought faster deregulation
of those sectors, but to delay liberalization of medical and
accident sectors because foreign companies already have a strong
presence there.
	   U.S. officials question whether Japan has opened the life and
non-life sectors enough. Japan, however, insists that it has, and
the ministry said it would proceed with the next stage _ opening
medical and accident insurance to more Japanese companies in 2001.
	   A senior Japanese Finance Ministry official said on condition of
anonymity that no specific dates had been set for the next round of
talks. The 1996 pact requires some life and non-life insurance
reforms, such as liberalization of insurance rates, to be made by
July 1, 1998. Japan says it has already carried these out.
	   The Japanese official also said there were no plans to have U.S.
President Bill Clinton and Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto discuss
the issue when Hashimoto visits the United States next month.

Floods kill seven people in Bangladesh
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Floods that inundated scores of
villages in northeastern Bangladesh have killed at least seven
people and displaced several thousand others, a lawmaker who toured
the region said Friday.
	   The deaths of three children, a woman and three men were
reported in hardest-hit Zakiganj and Jaintapur areas of Sylhet
district since Tuesday, governing party legislator Imran Ahmed said
in a telephone interview.
	   They drowned in swirling waters that washed away dozens of
mud-and-thatch huts.
	   The flooding in Sylhet, a tea-growing region 190 kilometers (120
miles) northeast of Dhaka, the Bangladeshi capital, were caused by
torrential rains reported in the hills of the neighboring Indian
state of Assam, according to Dhaka's Flood Control Room.
	   The area's Surma and Kushiara rivers overflowed because of
onrushing waters.
	   At least 2,000 villagers, displaced by the flooding, evacuated
to high ground or school buildings, relief officials at Sylhet
contacted by phone said.
	   Bangladesh, a low-lying south Asian delta nation, is buffeted by
floods and cyclones that kill hundreds of people every year.

Chinese dissidents urge reassessment of Tiananmen movement
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ELAINE KURTENBACH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China's leaders should openly debate the
Tiananmen Square democracy movement and free a top reformer kept
under house arrest since the military crackdown nine years ago, a
group of veteran dissidents said Friday.
	   Former Communist Party General Secretary Zhao Ziyang, who was
ousted for appearing sympathetic to the protesters' demands in
1989, should be allowed to go free, the dissidents said in a
written appeal addressed to senior party leaders.
	   ``If even a party general secretary cannot enjoy the protection
of the law and party rules, then how can you guarantee democracy
and human rights to the public?'' said the appeal, signed by 12
dissidents and sent by fax to foreign news agencies.
	   ``If China wants to have democracy and law, then it must first
start with the government and the party leadership,'' it said.
	   Meanwhile, a group set up by U.S.-based dissidents including
recently released prisoners Wei Jingsheng and Wang Dan said Friday
their ``Free China'' network will promote democracy in their
homeland.
	   ``We strive to become a significant force in world politics and
intend to successfully challenge the People's Republic of China in
the media and all political and academic forums throughout the
world in a peaceful manner at our best effort,'' the group said in
a statement.
	   Demands for a reassessment of the military suppression of the
student-led protests, in which hundreds and maybe thousands died,
continue to surface despite the insistence by China's top leaders
that they have reached a ``correct verdict'' on the issue.
	   Many Chinese remain resentful of the crackdown and the lack of a
full accounting for the those killed by troops shooting their way
to Tiananmen Square on June 3-4, 1989.
	   The appeal said it was obvious ``even to an elementary school
student'' that Zhao Ziyang was not responsible for the protests
that sprung up in April 1989 following the death of another ousted
liberal leader, Zhao's predecessor Hu Yaobang.
	   By rehabilitating Zhao, who remains a popular figure, the
dissidents suggested the Communist Party might be able to counter
some of the public discontent caused by widespread corruption and
by rising unemployment.
	   ``Water can carry a boat, but it can also capsize it. We appeal
to the central leadership to reverse the verdict on June 4th and
reverse the verdict on Zhao Ziyang,'' it said.
	   Zhao has not made any public appearances since he made an
emotional appeal to the students on May 19, 1989, the day before
martial law was declared in Beijing.
	   Rights groups have reported recently that Zhao has been held
under tighter security since petitioning Chinese leaders in
September to re-examine the 1989 democracy movement.
	   There is no indication the authorities intend to ease their
suppression of public dissent. Last week, Bao Tong, a former aide
to Zhao who spent seven years in prison following the crackdown,
was warned not to speak with foreign reporters after he issued
several interviews openly criticizing the party leadership.

Konstantinov, Mnatsakanov cheered in return to Joe Louis Arena
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Updates after game &QL; 
 &UR; By KEN RAPPOPORT &QC; 
 &UR; AP Hockey Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DETROIT (AP) _ The cheers went up at Joe Louis Arena between the
first and second periods of Thursday night's Stanley Cup final
game.
	   The crowd welcomed back Vladimir Konstantinov and Sergei
Mnatsakanov, who were disabled by an auto accident last year six
days after the Red Wings won the Stanley Cup.
	   The Red Wings defenseman and team masseur have been recuperating
since. It was the second time back to Detroit for Konstantinov, who
made an appearance at Joe Louis Arena earlier in the playoffs.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; TIMING IS EVERYTHING: When the Detroit Red Wings score first in
the playoffs, they usually win. It happened again Thursday night.
	   With a 5-4 overtime victory over the Washington Capitals, the
Red Wings improved to 11-1 when taking the early lead. The Capitals
are 3-6 when allowing the first goal.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; DON'T BELIEVE WHAT YOU READ: How does Scotty Bowman prepare his
team to play in the finals, considering all the favorable press
picking the Red Wings as overwhelming favorites?
	   ``We keep telling the players that the people who picked them
don't know what they're talking about,'' Bowman said.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; STILL RUSHIN': What makes Viacheslav Fetisov one of the best
defensemen in hockey history?
	   ``He's good in a puck-control situation,'' Red Wings general
manager Ken Holland says. ``He makes a very good first pass. He's
also mentally tough and physically strong.''
	   Fetisov, the former star of the powerful Russian Red Army team,
is a rarity, playing professional hockey at the age of 40. He is
only the fifth 40-year-old player since the NHL's expansion era to
appear in a Stanley Cup final.
	   ``He's been there every night for us,'' Holland said. ``He is
very proud and a determined athlete who gets the most out of his
ability every night.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; EXPERIENCING THE FINALS: Experience means everything, as far as
officials in the Stanley Cup finals are concerned. The seven
officials on the ice for this year's finals have logged a combined
10,753 regular-season and playoff games.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; THAT'S EATING: If nothing else, the Capitals will be eating
well during this year's finals. They have brought their own chef
along for the games in Detroit.
	   Chef Gennaro Ferrigno, executive chef for the That's Amore
restaurant chain of Washington, came along to provide special
cuisine for the Eastern Conference champions.
	   Ferrigno has been cooking for the team for most home games at
the MCI Center and also recently started to provide meal service
for the team's charter flights.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; THEY GOT 'EM COVERED: Getting around these days? You can still
catch the Stanley Cup finals in many places of the world, no matter
how distant.
	   The NHL says the finals are being broadcast live to more than
170 countries, a record. That includes Asia and the Pacific Rim,
the Middle East, Central and South America, the Caribbean, Northern
Africa and Africa.

Indonesia's ex-President hires foreign lawyers: reports
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Former President Suharto has hired
foreign lawyers to handle allegations of corruption during his
32-year rule, news reports said Friday.
	   Attorney General Sudjono Atmonegoro was quoted as saying his
office has received a letter from the lawyers stating that they now
were representing Suharto, who resigned last month.
	   Sudjono, however, refused to identify the foreign lawyers's
names or nationality, the daily Kompas newspaper said.
	   Suharto stepped down on May 21, after riots and violent protests
left at least 1,188 dead in Jakarta and other cities.
	   Since then, critics have called for Suharto to face trial for
corruption and abuse of power. They also want the state to seize
billions of dollars amassed by his family and use it to help solve
nation's acute economic problems.
	   Justice Minister Muladi said Suharto has the right to hire
foreign lawyers, but they have to work with Indonesian law firms.
	   Otherwise, the foreign lawyers can only act as consultants,
Muladi was quoted as saying by Kompas. Other newspapers also
carried reports saying that Suharto had hired a foreign-based legal
team.

<TEXT>
	   VERSAILLES, France _ About 10 masked men attacked the home of
world-renowned perfumer Jean-Paul Guerlain early Friday, shooting
him in the thigh and making off with millions of francs worth of
jewels and money, police said.
	   Guerlain and an employee shot in the chest in the attack were
hospitalized in the Yvelines region west of Paris where Guerlain's
home is located.
	   Police sources reported that Guerlain was in critical condition,
with a vital artery apparently injured. The information could not
be immediately confirmed.
	   According to accounts on French radio, the gang, armed with
hunting rifles and other weapons, broke into Guerlain's home,
called ``Mesnuls,'' near Montfort-l'Amaury, about 3 a.m. After the
shootout, they made off with their booty in a large car.
	   Further information was not immediately available.
	   On Thursday night, Guerlain presented his new perfume,
``Guerlinade,'' at a show on the Champs-Elysees, the famed Paris
avenue.
	   Guerlain is the great grandson of the founder of the prestigious
perfume and cosmetics house created in 1828.
	   Guerlain has been run by the world's No. 1 luxury group LMVH --
Louis Vuitton Moet-Henessy -- since 1994.

Corporate bankruptcies surge 37.5 percent in May
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Spurred by Japan's souring economy, corporate
bankruptcies in May surged 37.5 percent from the same month a year
earlier to 1,791 cases, a private credit research agency said
Friday.
	   Debt left behind by the bankruptcies swelled 55.5 percent from a
year earlier to 780.61 billion yen (dlrs 5.42 billion), the largest
bankruptcy debt total recorded for any month of May since World War
II, the Teikoku Databank Ltd. said.
	   The news of mounting bankruptcies came as the government
annouced Japan was officially in recession after gross domestic
product shrank for a second consecutive quarter, by 1.3 percent.
	   With May's figures, bankruptcies in all business sectors have
shown double-digit percentage increases for four straight months,
Teikoku said. Among the hardest hit sectors are construction,
manufacturing and wholesale.
	   Because of bad debt problems, financial institutions are holding
off on granting loans to companies in need of funds, while
deflationary pressures on the economy are worsening companies'
inventory levels, the agency said.
	   The results this year could be worse than last year, when
bankruptcy debt reached record levels, it said.
	   ``A series of failures by smaller to mid-size companies will
herald ultra-large bankruptcies,'' it said. ``Bankruptcies have
started to show a full-fledged upsurge.''

Environment groups ask Thai premier to scrap Laos power deal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A band of 14 environmental groups have
asked Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai to cancel an agreement to
buy electricity from neighboring Laos.
	   The groups are opposed to the building of the dlrs 1.2 billion
Nam Theun Two dam in Laos that will supply the power, because they
say it will destroy the environment and displace thousands of
tribal people.
	   In a letter to Chuan, they said Thailand no longer needed the
power because the economic crisis has led to a drop in consumption
of electricity.
	   Among the environmental groups making the appeal were the
Wildlife Fund of Thailand, Foundation for Ecological Recovery, Thai
Rivers Network, Alternative Energy Study Group and the Thai
Volunteers Service Foundation.
	   The Laotian government is building the 681-megawatt dam as a
partner in a consortium that includes Thai, Australian and French
firms.
	   Nearly all the electricity will be purchased by Thailand.
	   The U.S.-based International Rivers Network has said that the
dam, being built on a tributary of the Mekong River, will flood 447
square kilometers (178 square miles) on the Nakai Plateau.
	   The plateau is home to several endangered species such as the
clouded leopard, Asian golden cat, several species of bears along
with elephants, tigers and some primates.
	   The Thai government spokesman was not immediately available for
comment.
	   During the past few months, however, Chuan has been reluctant to
halt other controversial infrastructure projects, such as a gas
pipeline from Myanmar, because he said the contracts, signed by
previous governments, could not be broken.

Myanmar government warning about Western business scams
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Myanmar's military government issued a
warning to local businesses in state-run papers Friday about bogus
international groups cheating Myanmar companies out of money by
offering phony prizes.
	   ``There are several fake international organizations which have
been cheating money from inexperienced entrepreneurs from
undeveloped countries,'' a commentary in local papers said Friday.
	   It cited a Madrid-based firm called the Trade Leaders Club as
one of the cheating companies.
	   The company sent a letter to several Myanmar businesses,
including some that were already defunct and another that turned
out to be a minimart, saying they had been selected as the winner
of the ``10th International America Award for Quality,'' the report
said.
	   The recipients were invited to attend a ceremony at the Waldorf
Astoria Hotel in New York City on July 11 _ but the invitees would
have to pay their own way and then also pay the Trade Leaders Club
a dlrs 4,400 fee, the government said.
	   Myanmar, also known as Burma, was subjected to socialist
isolationism from 1962-88 by former Gen. Ne Win. Although the
current military government has slowly been adopting market
policies and opening up the country to investment, economic
problems still abound.

World Cup: Low countries meet again at soccer's highest level
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MIKE CORDER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VERSAILLES, France (AP) _ The newest chapter in one of soccer's
oldest rivalries will be written Saturday as neighboring low
countries, the Netherlands and Belgium, clash in their first Group
E match.
	   The Netherlands can take confidence from two easy wins over the
Red Devils in qualifying for this World Cup, but the players are
instead looking to a 4-year-old defeat to sharpen their hunger for
victory at Stade de France in Saint-Denis.
	   In their second match in the 1994 World Cup, the Dutch lost 1-0
to Belgium at Orlando's Citrus Bowl, thanks to a string of fine
saves by inspired goalkeeper Michel Preud'homme.
	   ``There is always a struggle between Belgium and Holland,''
Dutch coach Guus Hiddink said. ``We won twice in the qualification
round, but Holland lost in 1994 in the U.S.A. Now they have players
with a lot of experience. They are a tough and smart team.''
	   The teams meet for the 120th time Saturday. The first ``Low
Countries Derby'' was played in 1905.
	   Dutch winger Marc Overmars predicted a gritty Belgian
performance this time.
	   ``Belgium will not let us play our style. They have good players
so I expect a very tough match,'' he said.
	   Belgium will have to be at its best to contain a strong Dutch
attacking side that could be boosted by the return of star striker,
Dennis Bergkamp, at least for one half.
	   The Arsenal star, with 33 goals in 57 internationals, is
recovered from a hamstring injury and might be able to play one
half Saturday.
	   In its last two warm-up matches, the Netherlands shrugged off
Bergkamp's absence and hammered in five goals against both Paraguay
and Nigeria, conceding just one goal in each game.
	   Bergkamp believes the Dutch, World Cup runner-up in 1974 and
1978, have the skills to do well again this time.
	   ``We have enough quality,'' he said. ``If you also have a good
mentality in the team, you can go very far.''
	   Belgium, which placed fourth in the 1986 World Cup in Mexico,
only managed to beat Paraguay 1-0 last Saturday in Brussels.
	   The Belgians will look to PSV Eindhoven striker Luc Nilis and
Fiorentina frontman Luis Oliveira to break through a Dutch back
four that may be missing Frank de Boer, who injured his ankle
Monday in training.
	   Hiddink said he would leave it until as late as possible
Saturday to judge whether De Boer was fit enough before naming his
team.
	   Nilis, who was criticized after a poor performance against
Paraguay, says the real work starts now.
	   ``I admit I didn't play very well. I missed a few chances. But
the most important thing is Saturday's match. I hope I score
then,'' Nilis said.
	   Oliveira, the other striker, believes the Belgians have to
impose themselves, or risk letting the skillful Dutch dictate the
game.
	   ``We have to play to win. Attack aggressively,'' Oliveira said.
``If we don't, and play a waiting game, we will have no chance.''

Major powers grapple with nuclear threat, Balkans unrest
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With NATO-Kosovo &QL; 
 &UR; By BARRY SCHWEID &QC; 
 &UR; AP Diplomatic Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The South Asian nuclear crisis and ethnic
bloodshed in the Balkans held the attention of foreign ministers
from the world's major powers during meetings Friday to confront
the twin challenges.
	   Their immediate goal, in a communique to India and Pakistan, was
a detailed appeal to freeze their nuclear programs and refrain from
deploying nuclear weapons on missiles.
	   By inviting leading countries from all parts of the world, the
United States and its allies were hoping to amplify the appeal and
discourage others from following the lead of India and Pakistan.
	   ``We are taking one step at a time,'' said a senior U.S.
official, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``Nothing dramatic is
likely to happen here. It is a matter of building up world opinion
and protecting arms control agreements.''
	   In the Balkans, Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic is testing
the will of the international community with his suppression of
ethnic Albanians who account for nearly 90 percent of the
population of the Serbian province of Kosovo.
	   Even as the foreign ministers were gathering, Yugoslav troops
appeared readying a major offensive in the Malisevo region. Tony
Lloyd, the European Union's envoy to Kosovo, told the Albanian
leadership the world would not permit a repetition of the bloody
violence in Bosnia.
	   NATO defense ministers in Brussels agreed Thursday on air
exercises over Albania and Macedonia in the next few days to warn
Yugoslavia against further attacks in Kosovo.
	   ``It is not our desire to use force,'' U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright said in Washington before flying to London.
``Our desire is to solve this diplomatically.''
	   On the nuclear front, India and Pakistan said after setting off
nuclear devices last month that they had no plans for more tests.
	   But Albright and her foreign minister colleagues want the
longtime foes to forswear future tests and refrain from deploying
nuclear weapons or testing missiles that could deliver the weapons
to their targets.
	   Albright and the foreign ministers of Britain, France, China and
Russia met in Geneva, Switzerland, last week and appealed for all
those goals. In London, they were being joined by Germany, Japan,
Canada and Italy.
	   To add moral pressure, foreign ministers from Argentina, Brazil,
the Philippines, South Africa and Ukraine, all of whom have given
up the nuclear option, were to join the others at a discussion
intended to persuade India and Pakistan to heed world opinion.
	   Heading into the sessions, there was disagreement on economic
sanctions, which the Clinton administration imposed under U.S. law
against the two countries, and no inclination to offer any rewards
to India and Pakistan to agree to a freeze.
	   Japanese Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi was expected to announce
a comprehensive nuclear nonproliferation proposal aimed at
preventing India and Pakistan from further developing their nuclear
arms capability as well as urging the United States and Russia to
speed up their nonproliferation efforts.
	   The allies, too, were divided on Kosovo.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton has left open the possibility of
military force to end the violence against ethnic Albanians.
Britain and the United States may ask the U.N. Security Council
next week for authority.
	   The Italian Foreign Ministry indicated that Italy stands ready
to send troops and to lead a multinational force in Kosovo as it
did in neighboring Albania last year.
	   Russian President Boris Yeltsin has pledged to use his influence
with Milosevic to end police and army attacks. Yeltsin remains
opposed to Western military intervention. He has invited Milosevic
to meet with him in Moscow next week.
	   In Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao said
the dispute in Kosovo ``is an internal affair of Yugoslavia and
should be properly settled through political means by the parties
concerned in Yugoslavia.''

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met with the
leader of the opposition Friday amid reports that a unity
government might be under consideration as a way to overcome
right-wing objections to a West Bank withdrawal.
	   Right-wing members of Netanyahu's governing coalition have
repeatedly threatened to bring down his government if he goes ahead
with a much-delayed Israeli troop withdrawal from the West Bank.
The United States is pushing for a 13 percent pullback from the
territory which Israel seized from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast war.
	   The U.S. plan, which not been officially announced although many
its details have been disclosed, is an attempt by the Americans to
re-start the peace process which broke down 15 months ago.
	   Netanyahu told a delegation of American Jews on Friday that an
agreement would be signed only after the Palestinian fulfill their
obligations. Israel has repeatedly called on the Palestinian
Authority to do more to crack down on terror groups as a condition
for continuing the peace process.
	   ``When we have an agreement that achieves our security needs and
that the Palestinians comply with, then I will give it to the
government'' for approval, Netanyahu said.
	   Meir Sheetret of the ruling Likud party said it was time for the
withdrawal to be carried out and said that the formation of a unity
government was an option.
	   ``The prime minister needs to finish up with second
redeployment,'' Sheetreet told Army Radio, ``If the extreme right
threatens to topple the government we will work towards
establishing a unity government.''
	   Netanyahu met Friday morning with Ehud Barak, head of the Labor
Party, but his aides denied that the two discussed formation of a
unity government.
	   In an interview with Israel Radio, Barak did not address the
possibility of a unity government, but stressed the importance of
the decisions currently being made for the future of Israel.
	   ``A decision on the character of an agreement with the
Palestinians will influence lives, in the best case scenario, or
conversely, God forbid, the deaths of people. Extremely fateful
issues are at hand,'' Barak said.
	   Meanwhile, the prospect of holding a national referendum on the
West Bank withdrawal has been gaining momentum in government
circles.
	   A show of public support could be another strategy for Netanyahu
to the weather the political storm that authorizing a withdrawal
would bring.
	   Following Netanyahu's hourlong meeting with Barak, the prime
minister was meeting with Rabbi Avraham Shapira, a spiritual leader
of the National Religious Party, which opposes any West Bank
withdrawal.
	   Jewish settlers continued their campaign against a withdrawal
Friday, taking five flights of Likud members over the West Bank.

Japan's prime minister survives no-confidence vote against his
</HEADLINE>
Cabinet &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto survived a
no-confidence vote against his Cabinet on Friday, the second time
he has defeated an attempt to topple his government.
	   The 500-member lower house rejected the no-confidence motion by
a 273-207 vote.
	   The motion was submitted Thursday by Japan's biggest opposition
party, which was joined by two other opposition groups _ Liberal
and Communist parties.
	   With Hashimoto's conservative Liberal Democratic Party
dominating Parliament's powerful lower house, the move had little
chance of success. It was mostly seen as a gesture ahead of upper
house elections expected to be held in mid-July.
	   The three opposition parties blamed Hashiomoto and his
government for failing to jump start the moribund economy. The
government announced Japan was officially in recession Friday.
	   Hashimoto earlier survived no-confidence motion in December.

Japan's economy in severe recession, deepening fears of regional
</HEADLINE>
crisis
 &UR; Eds: PMs. RECASTS throughout with detail and background &QL; 
 &UR; By MARTIN FACKLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan announced its first year of negative growth
in two decades Friday, confirming it is in severe recession and
deepening fears its woes will accelerate a regional crisis that has
already taken the roar out of Asia's economic tigers.
	   The Economic Planning Agency said Japan's gross domestic product
for the fiscal year ended March 1998 shrank by 0.7 percent, the
first full year of economic contraction since 1974.
	   Quarterly figures showed the economy to be where many economists
had already feared: in full-blown recession.
	   The agency said gross domestic product, the sum of all goods and
services produced in Japan, fell by a steeper-than-expected 1.3
percent in the January-March quarter. That follows a drop of 0.4
percent _ revised downward Friday from an earlier estimate of 0.2
percent _ in the previous quarter.
	   Two back-to-back quarters of negative growth is generally
accepted as the definition of a recession.
	   Prospects aren't bright for current year, either, although the
EPA is standing by its 1.9 percent growth forecast. While
economists say an upcoming 16.6 trillion yen (dlrs 116 billion)
stimulus package will help, Japan has shown no signs of taking the
painful steps needed to cure its economic woes.
	   ``The package won't be enough to turn things around,'' said
Chris Calderwood, chief economist at the Tokyo branch of Jardine
Fleming Securities. ``This year will be a growth crater''
	   A recession in Japan bodes ill for the rest of Asia, which had
been counting on the region's largest economy to get its house in
order and lead its neighbors out of financial crisis.
	   Instead, Japan has proven unable to wrench itself from a
stubborn eight-year economic downturn that has already driven its
economy into recession twice.
	   Asia's battered financial markets had been showing their first
signs of recovery since the region's economic crisis began last
summer.
	   But now pessimism about Japan's economy has driven the yen to an
eight-year low against the U.S. dollar. That has put renewed
selling pressure on currencies of other Asian countries amid
concern their exports may not be able to stay competitive in key
markets like the United States.
	   It was just such a sell off of the Thai baht last July that
triggered Asia's regional crisis in the first place.
	   In announcing the GDP figures, an official for the Economic
Planning Agency said falling demand for Japanese exports in Asia,
Japan's largest market, was one of the biggest factors behind the
poor showing.
	   Exports dropped by 3.8 percent in the January-March quarter.
Domestic consumption, which had fallen by 1 percent the previous
quarter, edged up 0.1 percent.
	   But economists agree most of Japan's problems are of its own
doing. Unwise lending by Japanese banks a decade ago has left them
burdened with an estimated 76 trillion yen (dlrs 531 billion) in
failed loans still on their books.
	   Writing off those bad loans has absorbed most the excess cash in
the Japanese banking system, instead of letting it be put to more
productive use in new loans to business.
	   To make matters worse, Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto embarked
on a program to raise taxes and balance Japan's federal budget just
as its economy was showing its first sign of recovery since 1990.
The tax increase squelched consumer spending.
	   Japan's economy has been in a stubborn slump ever since its
stock and property markets collapsed starting in 1990. Some
economists say Japan has gone into recession twice since then _ in
1992 and in 1994-1995 _ while other economists say the second
downturn may not have technically been a recession.
	   Under intense pressure at home and abroad to revive growth to
help the rest of Asia, Hashimoto earlier this year reversed his
policy of fiscal tightening and announced the 16.6 trillion yen
stimulus package.
	   But the biggest danger from Friday's figures may be
psychological.
	   They are only the latest in a constant drum beat of bad economic
news that Japanese corporate managers and consumers have heard for
almost a year now.
	   The danger, say economists, is that all this gloom and doom may
become a self-fulfilling prophecy: Worried factory managers could
cut back on production and hiring, and spooked consumers could cut
back even further on spending.
	   That could make the economy go from bad to worse.
	   ``The numbers could put the economy into a vicious cycle by
damaging the confidence,'' said Shun Motani, president of Sphinx
Investment Research.

Report: Russian missile parts reach Cyprus
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkish intelligence say that radar and
control panels for five Russian-made air-defense missile systems
have reached the divided Mediterranean island of Cyprus, a leading
newspaper reported Friday.
	   The Hurriyet said the parts were transferred from ship to ship
in several Mediterranean ports to elude the surveillance of Turkey,
which has threatened to use force to stop their deployment.
	   Turkish foreign ministry officials were not available for
comment.
	   The newspaper also said that three Russian military delegations
had started to train Greek Cypriot army on how to use the
air-defense systems earlier this week in Cyprus. Turkey claims the
missiles could also be used to launch an attack that threatens the
Turkish Cypriot side of the island _ and Turkey itself.
	   Hurriyet confirmed a Russian report that Cyprus had received
parts of the S-300 missile systems, the Russian equivalent of the
U.S. Patriot missiles used in the Gulf War.
	   Russia's Rosvooruzheniye arms trading monopoly, which signed a
contract with Greek Cypriots for the sale, denied the report,
saying the missiles would be sent to Cyprus in mid-August as
planned.
	   Hurriyet said the rest of the missile systems are expected to
reach the divided island by mid-August.
	   On Friday, Hurriyet quoted Deputy Premier Bulent Ecevit as
saying that ``We will increase the Turkish military strength in
Cyprus, if the S-300 missiles are deployed.''
	   Ecevit ordered the Turkish operation in 1974 as premier.
	   Greece has said it will come to the aid of Cyprus if it is
attacked by Turkey, raising fears of a military conflict between
two NATO allies.
	   Turkish Cypriot Leader Rauf Denktash said they would invite
Turkey to permanently settle in the Turkish sector of the island if
the missiles are deployed, Hurriyet said.
	   Turkish intelligence sources also say that Russia could use the
missiles' radar to monitor the Mediterranean from Cyprus.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met with the
leader of the opposition Friday amid reports that a unity
government might be under consideration as a way to overcome
right-wing objections to a West Bank withdrawal.
	   Right-wing members of Netanyahu's governing coalition have
repeatedly threatened to bring down his government if he goes ahead
with a much-delayed Israeli troop withdrawal from the West Bank.
The United States is pushing for a 13 percent pullback from the
territory which Israel seized from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast war.

Australia looks good for World Cup semis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Australia was given a smooth run into
the semifinals of next year's rugby union World Cup when the draw
for the finals was released Friday.
	   The Wallabies are not scheduled to meet fellow southern
hemisphere powers South Africa until the semifinals and would not
face New Zealand unless they make the final.
	   Depending on the results of qualifying tournaments this year,
Australia will probably confront Ireland, the United States and the
sixth European qualifier, likely to be Spain, in its pool based in
Dublin.
	   If the Wallabies top their pool they will have a quarterfinal
match likely to be against host nation Wales in Cardiff on Oct. 23.
	   A win there would pit them against defending champion South
Africa or England in a semifinal on Oct. 30 at Twickenham, with the
final back at Cardiff's new Millennium Stadium on Nov. 6.
	   The Wallabies' opening match of the tournament would be against
the sixth European qualifier on Oct. 3 in Belfast.
	   Only the top three from the 1995 Cup _ South Africa, New Zealand
and France _ and host Wales qualify automatically, with 65 unions
contesting qualifying tournaments for the remaining 16 places.
	   Australia plays Fiji, Tonga and Western Samoa in September, with
three countries qualifying.
	   South Africa is in Scotland's Pool A, Pool B will include New
Zealand and England, Pool C features France and qualifiers from the
Pacific, Africa and the Americas, Wales hosts Pool D, while
Australia and Ireland are in Pool E.
	   The tournament opens on Oct. 1 with the 41 matches played at 18
venues. (djp)

Yen's slide drags down Asian, world stock markets
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with Japan's recession announcement,
many stock and currency markets falling.
 &UR; By PRISCILLA CHEUNG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Many Asian stock and currency markets fell once
again Friday, thanks to Japan's weak yen, its newly announced
recession, and losses on the bourses of Europe and America.
	   In Seoul, the key stock index tumbled 8.1 percent to close at
302.09, the lowest since 301.56 of Jan. 28, 1987, on fears that
Japan's woes may eventually wreck the South Korean economy, too.
	   In Taiwan, shares closed at another seven-and-a-half month low
as investors, pressured by the need to maintain margin ratios,
bailed out of the market. The key Weighted Price Index closed 93.63
points, or 1.3 percent lower, to 7,117.11 points.
	   And in Kuala Lumpur, the key Composite Index was 2.2 percent
lower at 472.51 points at midday, as investors continued to sell
their local shares on worries that the problems in the region's
economies will prolong Malaysia's economic woes.
	   As Japan's yen fell once again against the U.S. dollar,
Southeast Asia's battered currencies followed suit.
	   But not every market closed lower. After repeated losses, the
main stock markets in Tokyo, Hong Kong and Australia finished the
day with slight advances.
	   Japan, Asia's troubled economic powerhouse, confirmed Friday
what many economic analysts had long suspected, that it has sunk
into recession, with two back-to-back quarters of negative growth.
	   Japan's real gross domestic product for the first quarter this
year fell 1.3 percent from the previous quarter. Last quarter, the
economy shrank 0.2 percent. Japan's gross domestic product for the
entire fiscal year ended March 31, 1998, shrank 0.7 percent, the
first contraction during the entire year since 1974.
	   Fears that the weakening yen would force China to devalue its
yuan also spilled over to Wall Street and Europe, raising fears
that Asia's protracted financial crisis would lead to a worldwide
slump. European markets and the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended
sharply lower Thursday.
	   A cheaper yuan would feed Chinese inflation and trigger a wave
of regional devaluations, further weakening key economies such as
Hong Kong's and spreading as far as Russia, analysts suggested.
	   ``It's all about the yen,'' said Michael Lim, the head of the
treasury department at Standard and Chartered Bank in Jakarta.
``Nobody can stand a strong dollar.''
	   The yen also tumbled as traders interpreted comments by U.S.
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin as meaning that a coordinated
effort by central banks to boost the falling yen was unlikely.
	   In late afternoon, the dollar is trading at 144.04 yen, up 2.36
yen from late Thursday in Tokyo and above its late New York rate of
143.79 yen overnight. At one point, the dollar moved as high as
144.75 yen in Tokyo, matching a high recorded in August 30, 1990.
	   Rubin reiterated in Washington that Japan must revive its ailing
economy, warning that its ``economic difficulties and weak currency
are having substantial adverse impact on the East Asian
countries.'' He said it's up to Japan to halt the yen's slide.
	   In Asia's currency markets, the Singapore dollar was quoted at
1.7430 to the U.S. dollar at midday, up from 1.7360 in late trading
in Asia on Thursday.
	   Malaysia's ringgit also was lower, trading at 4.0000 ringgit per
U.S. dollar, up from 3.9750 the previous day.
	   The Thai baht was down, with the U.S. currency trading at 43.35
in mid-morning, up from 43.12 at the close of trading Thursday.
	   In Japan, Tokyo shares fell in the morning to their lowest
levels since Jan. 14, but a last-minute rally left them little
changed from Thursday's close. The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock
Average gained 8.29 points, or 0.06 percent, to close at 15,022.33.
On Thursday, it had lost 2.12 percent.
	   Shares in Hong Kong were down by 1.7 percent at the open, but
clawed back on bargain hunting to close the morning session at
7,916.97 points, up 0.4 percent. However, the index had lost 8
percent in the past four sessions.
	   Singapore's benchmark Straits Times Industrial Index dropped 2
percent when the market opened. But bargain hunting buoyed the key
index in the afternoon pulled it to 1,090.17 points, up 0.3 percent
from Thursday's close.
	   In Kuala Lumpur, the benchmark index opened down 2.3 percent,
and Thailand's key index opened down 0.8 percent.
	   Shares in New Zealand fell for the 12th consecutive session,
closing 11.5 points lower at 1,997.63.
	   Bucking the trend, Jakarta stocks opened higher, but the rupiah
fell against the U.S. currency early Friday, trading at 14,250 to
the dollar, down from 13,750 late Thursday.
	   Australian shares broke an eight-day fall, with the key index
closing 0.5 percent higher at 2,558.70 points.

Coach takes blame for record loss
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROTORUA, New Zealand (AP) _ England coach Clive Woodward has
taken the blame for his team's humiliating rugby union defeat
against Australia in Brisbane last Saturday.
	   He said it was wrong to direct the fault at players, and as
coach he took the responsibility for their record 76-0 test loss to
the Wallabies.
	   ``It's my fault _ if you have anyone to blame then it's me,''
Woodward said Friday on the eve of his team's Saturday match
against New Zealand A.
	   Former England and British Lions standoff Stuart Barnes, who is
following the English tour as a television commentator, said
England erred from day one by accepting such a difficult tour
without some of their top players.
	   Apart from four tests against the world's top three nations,
Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, they have three games
against selection teams in New Zealand, starting with the match
against New Zealand A.
	   At least a dozen leading players remained at home to recover
from the club season.
	   Twenty of the 37 players in the squad started the tour without
any international experience, and at least 10 had never played the
game at any significant level though they had been around the
English club scene for some time.
	   Some players are in the third week of their tour without having
played a game.
	   Powerful New Zealand A includes Jonah Lomu, being tried out to
prove he is ready for next Saturday's first test against England in
Dunedin.
	   Teams:
	   ENGLAND: Tom Beim, Matt Moore, Nick Beal, Dominic Chapman, Jos
Baxendell, Josh Lewsey, Matt Dawson (captain), Steve Ojomoh, Pat
Sanderson, Dave Sims, Rob Fidler, Ben Clarke, Will Green, Phil
Greening, Tony Windo. Reserves: Stuart Potter, Alex King, Peter
Richards, Darren Crompton, George Chuter, Danny Grewcock, Lewis
Moody.
	   NEW ZEALAND A: Adrian Cashmore, Glen Osborne, Caleb Ralph, Jonah
	   Lomu, Jason O'Halloran, Lee Stensness, Rhys Duggan, Xavier Rush,
Scott Robertson, Blair Larsen, Norm Maxwell, Andrew Blowers, Kees
Meeuws, Norm Hewitt (captain), Kevin Nepia. Reserves: Jon Preston,
Steve Surridge, Tana Umaga, Eroni Clarke, Mark Hammett, Gordon
Slater, Royce Willis. Referee: Paddy O'Brien (Southland). (djp)

	   DOLGENBRODT, Germany (AP) _ When a house for refugees in this
lakeside resort burned to the ground the day before 86 Africans
were to move in, authorities quickly caught and convicted a
teen-age neo-Nazi.
	   Then the arsonist started talking, and prosecutors uncovered a
conspiracy involving not only disaffected youths but otherwise
upstanding citizens who wanted to keep the asylum seekers out.
	   The case, combined with recent electoral successes for a
far-right party, raised new questions about the breadth of
anti-foreigner sentiment in Germany, especially in the formerly
closed and communist east.
	   Five men allegedly involved in the plot went on trial Friday in
Brandenburg state court in Frankfurt an der Oder, four charged with
complicity in the Nov. 1, 1992 crime and the fifth with being an
accessory.
	   While they and two others awaiting trial on perjury charges are
the only ones charged, prosecutor Petra Marx says she believes most
of Dolgenbrodt's 300 residents share the blame.
	   ``They might not have been actively involved,'' she said in an
interview Thursday. ``But the atmosphere in the village was not the
best at that time, everyone admits.

Ukraine presents new passenger plane to potential customers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) - Ukraine presented its new An-140 plane to
potential customers from Russia, Moldova and Lithuania, and
officials said they already had orders for the first five planes, a
news report said Friday.
	   The turboprop passenger plane is designed to replace the An-24.
The new model is considered a vast improvement over the aging
An-24, which is used for short- and medium-distance runs throughout
the former Soviet Union and its one-time client states.
	   Thursday's presentation in the eastern town of Kharkiv was
attended by aviation officials from Ukraine, Russia, Moldova and
Lithuania, the Interfax news agency said.
	   Serial production of the An-140 is to be jointly carried out by
the Kharkiv aviation plant and Russia's Samara aviation plant. The
director of the plant in Kharkiv, Anatoly Mialitsa, said his plant
already had received orders for the first five aircraft. He did not
elaborate.
	   The new plane made its maiden flight in 1997. Its first serial
model is due to take off this year and clients would start to
receive the aircraft in 1999, Interfax reported.
	   Designers have previously estimated the demand at 89 planes in
Ukraine, 460 in Russia and 170 in other former Soviet republics.
	   They say the An-140, which can carry 52 passengers for 2,300
kilometers (1,400 miles) at a maximum speed of 555 kph (344 mph),
is just as good and half as expensive as foreign competitors.
	   The An-24 was put into service in the early 1960s. An-24s have
been involved in several air crashes in Russia and elsewhere in
recent years.

 &UR; With BC-Australia-Asia-Howard &QL; 
 &UR; By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GYMPIE, Australia (AP) _ In less than two years, Pauline Hanson
has risen from being a politically naive fish-and-chips shop owner
disavowed by her own party to become a right-wing populist
kingmaker in Queensland _ and perhaps soon, the nation.
	   After Queensland's election Saturday, her candidates may hold
the balance of power in this state, where the Parliament is evenly
divided between the governing conservatives and the opposition
Labor Party.
	   On the national level, conservative Prime Minister John Howard
is worried about Saturday's outcome. If the Hanson forces can cost
the conservatives Queensland, they may be able to do the same in
the closely divided Senate in the federal election Howard must call
before March 1999.
	   ``Queenslanders will be the first Australians in living memory
to have the chance to elect a real alternative to the multicultural
and politically correct Labor and (conservative) Coalition parties,
whose policy fulfils the agenda of overseas interests, not our
own,'' Hanson proclaimed last week.
	   Hanson's meteoric rise has come back to haunt Howard's Liberal
Party, which, despite its name, is the more conservative of the two
mainstream Australian parties.
	   In 1996, it dumped Hanson as a Liberal candidate for the
national House of Representatives after her anti-Aboriginal
speeches embarrassed the party. But she was elected anyway as an
independent, and last year sold her shop to launch a national
political movement, the One Nation Party.
	   Hanson, 44, stands out among Australian politicians. She is
refreshingly unpolished in speeches and appearances, winning
sympathy when her voice catches or cracks while making
controversial pronouncements. Many Aussies, wether they agree with
her or not, feel she is closer to the people than the caste of
professional politicians roaming Canberra, the national capital.
	   Loathe to alienate Hanson's right-wing partisans, Howard was
reluctant to confront her more unusual policy pronouncements,
instead defending her right to ``free speech.''
	   Among Hanson's views:
	   _Asian immigration should be frozen, or else by 2040 Australia
will be swamped by Asians. In fact, Britons, New Zealanders and the
Irish form the biggest migrant groups. There are about 1 million
Asians and 303,000 Aborigines among Australia's 18 million people.
	   _Welfare programs that benefit Aborigines should be scrapped on
the grounds that they are racially discriminatory. Australia has a
wide variety of welfare, health and relief programs; some are
exclusively for Aborigines, others are targeted at refugees or
drought-stricken farmers.
	   A book Hanson published last year claimed Aborigines were
cannibals who ate their women and children.
	   _Last week Hanson denounced a draft U.N. declaration on the
rights of indigenous peoples as the ``collusion of Aboriginal
separatists, the U.N. and the disloyal and self-seeking globalists
in our midst'' to set up taxpayer-funded separate Aboriginal
states, dismembering Australia.
	   That finally smoked Howard out, who said her speech was not only
``inaccurate and dishonest but it verges on the deranged in various
places.''
	   But Howard's long-delayed salvo against Hanson came hours after
a major poll indicated her One Nation candidates in Queensland were
pulling so much support away from the governing conservatives that
Labor was likely to win power.
	   Even as Howard castigated Hanson, the Queensland branch of his
Liberal Party had formed a tactical alliance with One Nation.
	   In 88 of the state's 89 electoral districts, the Liberals have
agreed to ``exchange preferences'' with One Nation, which means
that if the Liberals come third in the district, their voters are
directed to turn their votes over to One Nation candidates as their
second preference.
	   The alliance disgusted many Liberal Party stalwarts, including
former prime minister Malcolm Fraser and John Hewson, who led the
Liberals' losing national campaign in 1993.
	   ``Not only is she drawing support because of some of her
particularly racist and other views,'' Hewson said, ``But I think
she's become a focal point for general discontent and
disenchantment with the major parties.''
	   Queenslanders cast their votes Saturday, and a poll on election
eve shows One Nation with support as high as 40 percent in a few
rural districts, and at least 15 percent-20 percent in many others.
	   That could sap enough votes from the conservatives to hoist
Labor to victory. Or it could leave Queensland without a majority
party _ and with Hanson's One Nation holding the balance of power.

Yassin wants to stage sit-in at Egyptian-Israeli border
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Sheik Ahmed Yassin, the spiritual leader of
the Islamic group Hamas, will camp out at Egypt's border with the
Gaza Strip if Israel denies him entry, a newspaper said Friday.
	   Yassin would then leave Egypt for another Arab Muslim country,
the London-based Al-Hayat quoted a Hamas official as saying.
	   Yassin, a 61-year-old quadriplegic, has been on a 3 1/2-month
tour of Muslim countries to raise funds and drum up support for
Hamas, which opposes peace with Israel. Israeli leaders have
debated whether to allow the religious leader to return.
	   It was unclear, however, whether the protest could happen in
Egypt. Yassin had planned to return to the Gaza Strip via Cairo,
but Egyptian officials have reportedly refused to let him enter
either. He has stayed in Khartoum, Sudan, pending a final decision.
	   Khartoum-based Egyptian diplomats told the group that barring
his entry was ``postponement and not cancellation,'' said the Hamas
official, who was not named. Yassin would be granted permission to
enter ``within the next few days,'' the official said.
	   If he did enter Egypt and was barred from Gaza, whose borders
are controlled by Israel, Yassin would stage a sit-in ``until the
Israeli position is exposed to the world,'' the official said.
	   He did not say how long Yassin would remain at the border.
	   Egyptian officials could not immediately be reached for comment.
	   Yassin was freed from an Israeli jail last fall in exchange for
the freedom of two Israeli Mossad agents captured in Jordan during
a bungled assassination attempt against another Hamas leader.

U.S. dollar surges against yen, Tokyo stocks steady
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with late afternoon dollar and bond rates &QL; 
 &UR; By TODD ZAUN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar surged to an eight-year high
against the Japanese yen after comments from a top U.S. finance
official convinced traders an international effort to strengthen
the yen was unlikely.
	   The U.S. dollar bought 144.02 yen in late-afternoon trading, up
2.34 yen from late Thursday in Tokyo and also above its late New
York rate of 143.79 yen overnight.
	   Earlier in the day, the dollar was quoted at 144.75, its highest
level against the yen since it reached that same mark on August 30,
1990.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average
gained 8.29 points, or 0.06 percent, to close at 15,022.33. On
Thursday, the average closed down 325.22 points, or 2.12 percent.
	   U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin told a Senate panel
Thursday that official intervention in currency markets ``can be
useful at times, can have effect at times'' but foreign exchange
rates ``will follow fundamentals'' over time.
	   While Rubin didn't rule out U.S. intervention to support the
ailing yen, his comments were interpreted by traders as meaning the
United States doubts government efforts to sell dollars would curb
the yen's fall.
	   Strong U.S. economic growth and a weakening economy in Japan
have been driving the dollar higher against the yen. The threat of
government intervention in support of the yen has been one of the
only things keeping the U.S. currency from rising further.
	   ``Rubin's comment was an unambiguous expression of the U.S.
stance toward the yen's recent fall,'' said Ryuichi Takami, a
senior trader at Sanwa Bank. ``There is no way to buy yen after
such remark.''
	   Comments from finance officials in Japan didn't do much to slow
the yen's decline.
	   Japanese finance minister Hikaru Matsunaga said Friday that
Japan was ready to take ``decisive action'' against an excessive
weakening of the yen but didn't say when such action would occur or
what it would entail.
	   The yen's decline initially drove stocks lower but last-minute
bargain hunting nudged Japan's main stock index marginally higher.
	   Shares of Honda, Toyota and Sony advanced on the stronger dollar
which lets exporters price their products more competitively
overseas.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section of the exchange fell 1.56 points, or 0.13 percent, to
1,1177.25 points. The TOPIX closed down 19.79 points, or 1.65
percent, the day before.
	   Trading on the main section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange
ballooned to an estimated 817 million shares from 418.14 million
shares Thursday.
	   Declines outnumbered advances 653 to 458, while 169 shares were
unchanged.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond fell to 1.210 percent from Thursday's finish of
1.245 percent, driving its price up to 111.94 yen from 111.68 yen.

Australia expects tough battle from Scotland
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ A week after its easiest rugby union
win in history, Australia expects a far different scenario against
Scotland at Sydney Football Stadium on Saturday.
	   Coach Rod Macqueen and captain John Eales know the inaugural
Hopetoun Cup test will be much more of a contest than last week's
76-0 waltz over England in Brisbane.
	   But while Macqueen said the match was not being treated as a
warmup for next month's encounters with New Zealand and South
Africa, he did concede the depleted Scots, missing eight regular
test players who chose to stay at home, represented a stepping
stone toward the tougher tests.
	   ``We are very focused, we know we've got a hard year ahead,'' he
said. ``We know we've got a bit of ground to make up on some of the
other countries and this is all part of the start of it.''
	   While undermanned, Scotland is nowhere near as weak as England
who had five new players last week. The Scots proved earlier this
year they have greater depth when their A team won the Five Nations
A tournament, including a convincing win over England A.
	   With five tour matches so far in Australia following their 51-26
test loss in Fiji last month, they are far better prepared than
England and even in better shape than when Australia beat them 37-8
in Edinburgh last November.
	   Scotland coach Jim Telfer promised an expansive game to match
Australia's attack which scored 11 tries last week, finding room
for his two fullbacks, Glenn Metcalfe and Derrick Lee, their most
attacking players on tour so far.
	   New Zealand-born Metcalfe makes his debut with Lee on the wing.
Another Kiwi-Scot, flanker Gordon Simpson, also makes his
international debut Saturday.
	   Telfer did not like comparisons with England.
	   ``We are separate entities,'' said Telfer. ``We are trying to
focus on our own game and our players have improved since coming
here.
	   ``A Scotsman tends to respond to hard work and adversity quite
often. I would like to think this would be reflected tomorrow in
our display.''
	   Australian flanker David Wilson plays his 50th test Saturday, as
will reserve back Jason Little if he gets a run from the bench,
which Macqueen indicated was likely. The team is unchanged from the
one that beat England last week.
	   AUSTRALIA: Matthew Burke, Ben Tune, Daniel Herbert, Tim Horan,
Joe Roff, Stephen Larkham, George Gregan, Toutai Kefu, David
Wilson, Matt Cockbain, John Eales (captain), Tom Bowman, Andrew
Blades, Phil Kearns, Richard Harry. Reserves: Chris Whitaker,
Nathan Grey, Jason Little, Willie Ofahengaue, Owen Finegan, Dan
Crowley, Jeremy Paul.
	   SCOTLAND: Glenn Metcalfe, Derrick Lee, Cameron Murray, Rowen
Shepherd, Shaun Longstaff, Gregor Townsend, Bryan Redpath, Eric
Peters, Gordon Simpson, Robert Wainwright (captain), Stuart Grimes,
Scott Murray, Matthew Proudfoot, Gordon Bulloch, David Hilton.
Reserves: Craig Joiner, Duncan Hodge, Graeme Burns, Adam Roxburgh,
Stewart Campbell, Gordon McIlwham, Kevin McKenzie. (djp)

 &UR; NETHERLANDS ANTILLES: Small countries cannot afford Coast Guard &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   WILLEMSTAD, Curacao (AP) _ The new prime minister of the
Netherlands Antilles said larger countries should do more to patrol
Caribbean waters so her islands can spend scarce resources to
control crime on land.
	   In comments this week after being sworn into office, Prime
Minister Suzy Camelia-Romer said the five islands of the
Netherlands Antilles cannot afford the expense of an extensive
coast guard.
 &UR; DOMINICAN REPUBLIC: Haitian border is discussed in White House
meeting
	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ Control of the border
with Haiti has become one of the top priorities in the Dominican
Republic for U.S. officials, who say drug traffickers are crossing
the line too easily.
	   Control of the border was on the agenda when U.S. President Bill
Clinton and Dominican President Leonel Fernandez met Wednesday in
Washington. The two countries agreed to joint anti-drug operations
on the border.
 &UR; PUERTO RICO: Ten tons of trash removed from National Park
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Some 200 volunteers collected more
than 10 tons of trash in a cleanup day at El Yunque rainforest
reserve Saturday, the U.S. Forest Service said.
	   In a press release issued Thursday, the Forest Service said the
garbage was collected by organizations and individuals, as well as
municipal personnel from the towns around El Yunque, officially
known as the Caribbean National Forest.
	   El Yunque is the only tropical rainforest in the U.S. National
Parks system and is visited by more than 30,000 people each year.
 &UR; MARTINIQUE: Shooting victim dies
	   FORT-DE-FRANCE, Martinique (AP) _ A man shot in the head in a
restaurant by a gang of masked men has died, the newspaper France
Antilles reported Thursday.
	   Philippe Blanc, 41, was in a restaurant in the southern town of
Ducos at 11:30 p.m. Tuesday when three armed men burst in and
demanded money. Blanc was shot in the head and later died from his
wounds, the newspaper reported.
 &UR; GUYANA: Rights group asks Guyana not to hang two convicts
	   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) _ A London-based human rights group said
Thursday it plans to petition the Guyana government to commute the
death sentences of two prisoners who have been on death row for
more than 10 years.
	   The group, Interrights, said it would lobby President Janet
Jagan in the wake of a recommendation last month by the United
Nations Human Rights Committee that Abdool Yaseen and Noel Thomas
be set free.
	   The two were convicted more than a decade ago for killing
Yaseen's younger brother in a dispute over family assets.
Interrights contends the long time the two have spent on death row
constitutes cruel and unusual punishment and it also questioned
some aspects of their trial.
 &UR; CANADA: Company buys Barbados resort, other hotels
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Canadian Pacific Hotels said Thursday it will buy
seven resort hotels, with more than 3,000 rooms, in Arizona,
Bermuda, Mexico and Barbados.
	   CP Hotels, a unit of Canadian Pacific Ltd. of Montreal, will pay
dlrs 540 million for the Princess Hotels, owned by Lonrho PLC.
	   After the acquisition, Canadian Pacific Hotels will own 18
resort hotels with more than 8,000 rooms.

Japan's economy in severe recession, deepening fears of regional
</HEADLINE>
crisis
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with government cooment in 7th graf, bankruptcy
figures in 20th graf
 &UR; By MARTIN FACKLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan announced its first year of negative growth
in two decades Friday, confirming it is in severe recession and
deepening fears its woes will accelerate a regional crisis that has
already taken the roar out of Asia's economic tigers.
	   The Economic Planning Agency said Japan's gross domestic product
for the fiscal year ended March 1998 shrank by 0.7 percent, the
first full year of economic contraction since 1974.
	   Quarterly figures showed the economy to be where many economists
had already feared: in full-blown recession.
	   The agency said gross domestic product, the sum of all goods and
services produced in Japan, fell by a steeper-than-expected 1.3
percent in the January-March quarter. That follows a drop of 0.4
percent _ revised downward Friday from an earlier estimate of 0.2
percent _ in the previous quarter.
	   Two back-to-back quarters of negative growth is generally
accepted as the definition of a recession.
	   While the Japanese officials avoided using the ``r'' word, they
admitted the economy is worse off than they had previously
maintained.
	   ``The data illustrated the severity of the economy,'' said
Shimpei Nukaya, the top-ranking bureaucrat at the Economic Planning
Agency.
	   Prospects aren't bright for current year, either, although the
agency is standing by its 1.9 percent growth forecast.
	   While economists say an upcoming 16.6 trillion yen (dlrs 116
billion) stimulus package will help, Japan has shown no signs of
taking the painful steps needed to cure its economic woes.
	   ``The package won't be enough to turn things around,'' said
Chris Calderwood, chief economist at the Tokyo branch of Jardine
Fleming Securities. ``This year will be a growth crater''
	   A recession in Japan bodes ill for the rest of Asia, which had
been counting on the region's largest economy to get its house in
order and lead its neighbors out of financial crisis.
	   Instead, Japan has proven unable to wrench itself from a
stubborn eight-year economic downturn that has already driven its
economy into recession twice.
	   Asia's battered financial markets had been showing their first
signs of recovery since the region's economic crisis began last
summer.
	   But now pessimism about Japan's economy has driven the yen to an
eight-year low against the U.S. dollar. That has put renewed
selling pressure on currencies of other Asian countries amid
concern their exports may not be able to stay competitive in key
markets like the United States.
	   It was just such a sell off of the Thai baht last July that
triggered Asia's regional crisis in the first place.
	   In announcing the GDP figures, the Economic Planning Agency said
falling demand for Japanese exports in Asia, Japan's largest
market, was one of the biggest factors behind the poor showing.
	   Exports dropped by 3.8 percent in the January-March quarter.
Domestic consumption, which had fallen by 1 percent the previous
quarter, edged up 0.1 percent.
	   But economists agree most of Japan's problems are of its own
doing. Unwise lending by Japanese banks a decade ago has left them
burdened with an estimated 76 trillion yen (dlrs 531 billion) in
failed loans still on their books.
	   Writing off those bad loans has absorbed most the excess cash in
the Japanese banking system, instead of letting it be put to more
productive use in new loans to business.
	   To make matters worse, Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto embarked
on a program to raise taxes and balance Japan's federal budget just
as its economy was showing its first sign of recovery since 1990.
The tax increase squelched consumer spending.
	   Japan got another glimpse Friday of just how bad its economy is.
Teikoku Data Bank, a private research agency, reported corporate
bankruptcies in May soared more than a third from the previous
month.
	   Teikoku said the amount of debt left behind by those business
failures totaled 781 billion yen (dlrs 5.5 billion), the highest
since World War II.
	   Japan's economy has been in a stubborn slump ever since its
stock and property markets collapsed starting in 1990. Some
economists say Japan has gone into recession twice since then _ in
1992 and in 1994-1995 _ while other economists say the second
downturn may not have technically been a recession.
	   The biggest danger from Friday's figures may be psychological.
	   They are only the latest in a constant drum beat of bad economic
news that Japanese corporate managers and consumers have heard for
almost a year now.
	   All this gloom and doom may become a self-fulfilling prophecy:
Worried factory managers could cut back on production and hiring,
and spooked consumers could cut back even further on spending.
	   That could make the economy go from bad to worse.
	   ``The numbers could put the economy into a vicious cycle by
damaging the confidence,'' said Shun Motani, president of Sphinx
Investment Research.

U.S. government pays compensation to Okinawan rape victim
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with U.S. military confirmation, money paid in April &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The United States has paid compensation to an
Okinawan schoolgirl raped by American servicemen in 1995, a crime
that led to mass protests against the U.S. military in Japan,
officials said Friday.
	   The United States and Japan agreed on a compensation figure in
March, and the Japanese government also paid the girl separate
compensation, said Tadakazu Ukita of the Defense Facilities
Administration Agency.
	   An official with the U.S. military in Japan said on condition of
anonymity that the payment was made in April. Neither he nor Ukita
would say how much the girl was given.
	   The Japanese government paid the girl directly, and was then
reimbursed by the United States in May, Ukita said.
	   Three U.S. servicemen abducted and raped the 12-year-old girl on
Okinawa, Japan's southernmost main prefecture, in September 1995.
The three were convicted in 1996 and given jail terms ranging from
6 1/2 years to 7 years.
	   The rape exacerbated the already bitter sentiments against the
heavy U.S. military presence on the island, which houses more than
half of the 47,000 U.S. troops stationed in Japan.
	   In response to a string of protests, the U.S. government agreed
to close the Futenma Marine Air Station on Okinawa over the next
several years on condition that an alternative heliport be built
elsewhere.
	   Okinawa, one of the bloodiest battlegrounds of World War II, has
become an important strategic location for U.S. bases, close to
China, the Korean Peninsula and Southeast Asia.

Foreign central bankers will revamp Thai central bank next month
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A group of eight current and former
central bank officials from industrialized nations will arrive in
Thailand next month to help restructure the Bank of Thailand,
government officials said Friday.
	   The announcement was made jointly by Bank of Thailand Governor
Chatu Mongkol Sonakul and Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda,
and confirmed by central bank officials.
	   Although Tarrin and Chatu Mongkol declined to name which central
bank officials would be part of the team, they will come from the
United States, England, Germany and Japan, said the bank official
who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   The use of top regulators to give advice on how to supervise
financial institutions was offered to Thailand in January by World
Bank President James Wolfensohn as part of his bank's services.
	   Thailand's central bank was once regarded as one of the best-run
in Asia until scandals began to surface in 1996.
	   Most of them centered around poor supervision of banks and
finance companies, which were allowed to make a high number of
questionable loans to real estate and other companies without being
checked by the Bank of Thailand.
	   Under a dlrs 17.2 billion bailout of the Thai economy supervised
by the International Monetary Fund, 54 of the country's 91 finance
companies have been shut down and their assets are being
liquidated.
	   The central bank was also deeply involved in the failed defense
of Thailand's currency, the baht. Central bankers depleted the
country's foreign reserves, and were eventually forced to float the
baht last July, touching off Asia's financial crisis.
	   The team of Western central bankers will study the Bank of
Thailand and issue a report on restructuring recommendations after
about four months, the bank official said.

Police station in restive Caucasus attacked
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A police checkpoint in the Caucasus republic of
North Ossetia was attacked with grenades and gunfire but no one was
hurt, a news agency reported Friday.
	   The Thursday night attack on the mobile police post near the
mountain village of Chmi was the second to target a North Ossetian
police station in two days, the ITAR-Tass news agency said. On
Wednesday night, automatic rifle-fire and grenades hit another
police post set up near a quarry.
	   Citing local police sources, ITAR-Tass said that ``all traces''
of both attacks led to the neighboring republic of Ingushetia.
	   North Ossetia, which is predominantly Orthodox Christian, and
Muslim Ingushetia fought a short but bloody war in 1992. Hundreds
of people were killed and most ethnic Ingush were expelled from
North Ossetia.
	   Both sides have blamed each other for numerous kidnappings.
	   Earlier this week, North Ossetian villagers detained five Ingush
bus passengers in apparent retaliation for the kidnapping of seven
of their neighbors the day before.
	   Both republics are located in the northern Caucasus, a restive
region that also includes breakaway Chechnya.

Philippines marks centennial of declaration of independence

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with new quotes from Ramos, burning of American flag
by leftist group; TRIMS &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ As brass bands played in town squares
throughout the nation, President Fidel Ramos jubilantly waved a
large Philippine flag Friday in a re-enactment of the country's
declaration of independence from Spain 100 years ago.
	   Church bells pealed and government offices offered free food as
Filipinos commemorated Asia's first revolution against Western
colonial rule.
	   Ramos urged the nation to use its hard-won independence as an
inspiration in dealing with the current Asian financial crisis.
	   ``Our heroes claimed our people's right to be free,'' said
Ramos, whose term ends June 30. ``Whenever our resolve should
falter, let us look back to how our story as a nation began.''
	   Ramos waved the flag from the balcony of a refurbished house in
Kawit town in Cavite province, south of Manila, where revolutionary
leader Gen. Emilio Aguinaldo proclaimed independence on June 12,
1898, from 333 years of Spanish colonialism.
	   More than 30 countries sent representatives to join Friday's
celebration in Kawit and at Manila's Rizal Park, named after
national hero Jose Rizal, who was shot by the Spanish for
advocating equality.
	   Tens of thousands gathered to watch a parade depicting the
country's struggle against Spanish colonialism and a massive
fireworks display over Manila Bay.
	   Leftist groups under the New Patriotic Alliance, however, burned
an American flag at an ``alternative'' celebration to highlight the
United States' subsequent takeover of the Philippines, which they
said was downplayed in the government-sponsored festivities.
	   Ramos, elected in 1992, dismantled monopolies and deregulated
many industries, allowing Filipinos to enjoy economic progress
after years of stagnancy. The reforms helped shield the Philippines
from the worst effects of the regional currency crisis.
	   ``It may take some more years for us to realize the full
benefits of freedom,'' Ramos said. ``But we have learned ... that
freedom without growth, without development and without justice is
largely meaningless.''
	   In 1892, Filipino nationalists established a secret society
called the Katipunan, which prepared for armed rebellion against
Spain.
	   The revolt erupted four years later and spread rapidly through
much of the country.
	   A month before the declaration of independence, U.S. naval
forces destroyed a Spanish armada in Manila Bay in fighting that
followed the outbreak of the Spanish-American war.
	   Spain, still unwilling to hand over power to the Filipino
revolutionaries, ceded the country to the United States for dlrs 20
million in December 1898.
	   The following year, hostilities broke out between Filipino
revolutionaries and American forces sent to occupy the new U.S.
colony. The brief but brutal Philippine-American war is considered
by some historians as the ``first Vietnam'' of the United States.
	   The United States formally granted the Philippines independence
in 1946, but American influence remains strong.

Family of 11 shot to death in a mysterious crime
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Assailants stormed the house of a school
bus driver, killing him and 11 relatives in a shooting that shook a
country boasting of its security in a volatile region.
	   The shooting took place before dawn Thursday in Banayat, a
village 20 kilometers (12 miles) northwest of Amman. The gunmen
killed Amin Qashash, 50, his unidentified wife, four children, a
son-in-law and four grandchildren, officials said Friday.
	   Investigators blamed the shooting on ``either a personal feud or
financial,'' an official said on customary condition of anonymity.
	   The gunmen dragged the family into the basement of their
two-story house, where they shot them to death. The gunmen then
built a brick door to hide the entry to the basement, another
official said, also on condition of anonymity.
	   Jordan's reputation for safety and stability has been shaken
recently by a series of shootings and bombings.

President says no plans to seek reelection inn 1999
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ President B.J. Habibie says he has no
plans to be a candidate when a special assembly selects a new head
of state in December 1999, a news report said Friday.
	   ``Don't think that I want to be appointed president again,''
Habibie was quoted as saying by the official Antara news agency.
	   Habibie came to power May 21, after his predecessor Suharto, who
led the world's fourth biggest country for more than three decades,
stepped down amid widespread riots and violent protests over his
autocratic rule.
	   The People's Consultative Assembly, the country's highest
constitutional body, is expected to convene a general assembly in
December 1999 to elect a president and vice president.
	   ``When the MPR (Assembly) elects a president and vice president,
it will obviously not be me,'' Habibie said.
	   ``I will consider my task as president completed'' when the
Assembly meets on December 22, 1999, he said.
	   Habibie reportedly made the comments on Thursday to a group of
business leaders.
	   During his brief time in office Habibie has outlined a timetable
for political reform, including parliamentary elections in May
1999.

Mexican rebels reappear in Chiapas town
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN CRISTOBAL DE LAS CASAS, Mexico (AP) _ Most villagers had
fled Chavajeval and only Zapatista rebels patrolled the town square
one day after a bloody clash between rebels and the army.
	   The reappearance of Zapatista troops Thursday seemed to indicate
that the rebels are ready to respond to a tougher government line.
	   The scene in the wake of Wednesday's government raid on villages
in a Zapatista stronghold was reminiscent of early 1994, when the
Zapatista National Liberation Army shook Mexico by rising in revolt
in the southernmost state of Chiapas.
	   The increased government pressure on the Zapatistas and last
week's resignation of the conflict's main mediator, Roman Catholic
Bishop Samuel Ruiz, have increased uncertainty over efforts to
negotiate an end to the struggle in the heavily Indian region.
	   On Wednesday, the government sent hundreds of armed state police
and federal troops into three villages in El Bosque, a township
about 25 miles (40 kilometers) north of here. Officials said they
were carrying out arrest warrants for a few local residents.
	   Government grenades and tear-gas apparently were met with armed
resistance. The government says at least nine people, including at
least one policeman, died.
	   Most local residents and all local officials were absent from
Chavajeval on Thursday, 18 hours after government troops departed.
Reporters instead found armed men in Zapatista uniforms, looted
stores and houses, and blood smeared on a clinic floor.
	   The armed men insisted they were civilians, even though they
wore the traditional Zapatista clothing.
	   ``There are no uniforms here,'' said a gun-toting man who
identified himself as Adolfo Lopez Mateos _ the name of a former
Mexican president. He wore a Zapatista-style dark brown shirt,
charcoal pants, boots and a ski mask tucked in his belt.
	   State police with automatic rifles patrolled the town hall of El
Bosque, the township's seat, where the government on Wednesday
arrested officials of the pro-Zapatista shadow government.
	   In recent weeks, the government has raided at least three of the
30-some townships where Zapatistas have set up parallel
governments. The governments were designed to challenge the
authority of officials chosen in elections boycotted by the
Zapatistas and their allies.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ NEC Corp. said Friday it has agreed with China's
telecommunications authorities to supply a digital personal
handyphone system to the staff at the Great Hall of the People.
	   Under the agreement it has signed with the Beijing municipal
government, NEC will install the digital cordless system comprised
of 600 PHS phones, a switchboard and 200 radio antennae.
	   The communications equipment and computer maker hopes to supply
PHS networks to other facilities and begin marketing PHS systems in
China for public use.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Total automobile sales in Thailand
dropped 71.8 percent during the first five months of 1998 compared
with the same period the previous year, according to statistics
released Friday by Toyota Motor Corp.
	   Only 59,636 vehicles were sold in Thailand from January to May
1998 compared with 211,682 during the same period last year, a 71.8
percent decline, said Toyota, Japan's top automaker.
	   Sometimes called ``the Detroit of Asia,'' because of its large
automobile manufacturing industry, Thailand's drastic drop in sales
was attributed to the country's crashing economy which spun out of
control almost one year ago.
	   Nearly 2 million Thais are now unemployed, its currency has
fallen by about 40 percent against the dollar, credit is almost
impossible to obtain and many cars and trucks have been
repossessed.
	   Nearly every major Japanese and U.S. automaker has a production
plant in Thailand. Until the crisis, the country was the world's
largest market for pickup trucks after the U.S.
	   ___
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Spurred by Japan's souring economy, corporate
bankruptcies in May surged 37.5 percent from the same month a year
earlier to 1,791 cases, a private credit research agency said
Friday.
	   Debt left behind by the bankruptcies swelled 55.5 percent from a
year earlier to 780.61 billion yen (dlrs 5.42 billion), the largest
bankruptcy debt total recorded for any month of May since World War
II, the Teikoku Databank Ltd. said.
	   The news of mounting bankruptcies came as the government
announced Japan was officially in recession after gross domestic
product shrank for a second consecutive quarter, by 1.3 percent.
	   With May's figures, bankruptcies in all business sectors have
shown double-digit percentage increases for four straight months,
Teikoku said. Among the hardest hit sectors are construction,
manufacturing and wholesale.
	   Because of bad debt problems, financial institutions are holding
off on granting loans to companies in need of funds, while
deflationary pressures on the economy are worsening companies'
inventory levels, the agency said.
	   ___
	   TOKYO (AP) _ New Japan Securities Co., a major securities firm,
said Friday that it will shut down three of its foreign offices to
deal with tougher competition and financial deregulation at home.
	   Scheduled to be closed are: subsidiary New Japan Merchant Bank
(Singapore) Ltd. in Singapore; a representative office in Seoul;
and New Japan Capital Management (Honk Kong) Co., a unit of its
subsidiary in Hong Kong.
	   After the closures, the company will have seven subsidiaries and
representative offices outside Japan.
	   ___
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ South Korea's Jinro Coors Brewing Co.,
the joint venture brewing unit of financially troubled Jinro Group,
said Friday that Adolph Coors Co. of the United States has offered
to take the South Korean company over.
	   ``The U.S. company is in a meeting with our creditor banks to
discuss the deal,'' said a Jinro Coors official. ``Adolph Coors was
said to have offered dlrs 100 million for the purchase of the
venture.''
	   The official refused to reveal further details.
	   But he added that the final decision on the proposed takeover
will be made by its creditor banks.
	   In April, Jinro Group asked Coors Brewing Co., the principal
unit of Adolph Coors, to take over its brewing unit in a bid to
tide over its financial troubles.
	   Jinro Coors is the largest brewer in the country with about 20
percent of South Korea's beer market.
	   ___
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Taiwanese exporters retained 73 percent of
their total overseas sales in U.S. currency during the January-May
period, which amounted to dlrs 36.26 billion, the central bank
reported Friday.
	   Exporters had a total overseas sales of dlrs 49.54 billion in
the first five months of 1998.
	   Foreign exchange dealers said exporters were expecting the U.S.
currency to appreciate more before exchanging the bulk of their
dollars into New Taiwan dollars.
	   Since the beginning of the year, the New Taiwan dollar has
depreciated 6.9 percent against the U.S. dollar.

South Asian summit to be deferred
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ The annual summit of seven South Asian
leaders _ at which Indian and Pakistani prime ministers were to
meet for the first time since their duel of nuclear tests _ is
likely to be postponed from its scheduled dates of July 9-11,
diplomats said Friday.
	   The new dates for the meeting of the South Asian Association for
Regional Cooperation in the Sri Lankan capital of Colombo are
likely to be July 27-29.
	   No reason for the change was immediately given. The dates for
the summit are arranged by mutual consent of the leaders of India,
Pakistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Sri Lanka, Nepal and the Maldives.
	   Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee had already agreed to
the July 9-11 schedule proposed by host Sri Lanka. The formal
invitation had not yet been presented to his Pakistani counterpart.
	   SAARC meetings usually focus on multilateral trade and policy
matters, but the upcoming one was expected to be shadowed by
tension in the region created by tests last month that India and
Pakistan said made them nuclear weapons powers. The two countries
have fought three wars in the past 50 years, and continue to clash
over the Kashmir territory split between them which both claim in
its entirety.
	   At last year's summit, Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and
then-Indian Prime Minister Inder Kumar Gujral agreed to open
negotiations on Kashmir and a number of other disputes. Those
negotiations stalled. The centrist Gujral was replaced two months
ago by Vajpayee who, though considered a moderate, leads the
right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party known for Pakistan-bashing.
	   Both Indian and Pakistani leaders have said they want to resume
talks, but no date for a meeting has been set.

Environmentalists block main north-south artery, other freeway
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Local resident and environmentalists
Friday started a 28-hour blockade of the Brenner Pass on the
Austrian-Italian border, a move feared to cause a traffic chaos in
both countries.
	   Organizers of the blockade, which has been endorsed by the
Tyrolean provincial government, are venting their anger against
what they consider an intolerable increase in heavy-truck traffic.
They are also protesting European Union traffic policy in general.
	   Intermittent blockades were also planned south of Salzburg on
the Tauern freeway, another north-south artery.
	   The Brenner freeway was to be blocked for all traffic between 11
a.m. Friday and 3 p.m. (1300 GMT) Saturday, but police closed it
already an hour earlier.
	   On the Tauern freeway south of Salzburg, traffic was to be
halted for 20 minutes at every hour between 11 a.m. and 6. p.m.
(1600 GMT) on Friday.
	   Huge traffic tie-ups were expected in northern Italy and in
Austria's western Tyrol province, where traffic was being rerouted
from the Brenner freeway to a narrower highway that can no longer
handle present-day auto and truck traffic.
	   The planned blockade drew sharp criticism from Italy and Germany
and from an Austrian road haulage association.
	   But the demonstration was supported by all political parties in
the Tyrolean provincial diet as well as by the most important
parties in Alto Adige, the German-speaking northern Italian
province.
	   Tyrol governor Wendelin Weingartner was planning to take part in
a gathering on the border, personally endorsing the blockade.

South Korean stock index plunges to 11-year low
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ South Korean shares tumbled to their
lowest level in 11 years Friday, propelled downward by fears that
the falling Japanese yen could derail efforts for the country's
economic recovery.
	   The benchmark Korea Composite Stock Price Index fell by a record
daily margin of 8.1 percent to close at 302.09, the lowest since
January 1987.
	   A falling yen means more competition for South Korean exports _
bad news for the country's key strategy to revive its economy by
selling more goods abroad.
	   Japan and South Korean compete in such key products as cars,
computer chips and home appliances, and the weak yen makes Japanese
goods more competitive in overseas markets.
	   The Japanese yen slipped to an eight-year low of 144.65 against
the dollar Friday. It recovered later in the day, hitting 143.90
yen to the dollar in late afternoon in Tokyo.
	   ``Investors went on a selling spree on signs of instability in
other Asian markets amid the yen's plunge,'' said Park Jun-kyu, an
analyst at Dong-Ah Securities Co.
	   Park said the market sentiment was dampened by concerns that
foreign investors may desert the country, scared by growing
regional instability caused by the falling yen.
	   Earlier this week, the central Bank of Korea estimated that when
the Japanese yen falls by 10 percent, South Korea's annual exports
would decrease by dlrs 1.2 billion.
	   South Korea hoped to use its own weak currency to dramatically
boost exports. But the falling yen all but dashed such hope, the
bank said.
	   South Korean car and other companies are already struggling
under mounds of unsold products as Koreans tightened their belts
and domestic sales plunged.

World Cup: Mexico and South Korea hopes hinge on head-to-head
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ERICA BULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LYON, France (AP) _ Any hopes Mexico and South Korea entertain
of advancing past the first round of the World Cup hinge on the
outcome of their opening match on Saturday.
	   The two less-fancied teams of Group E that includes soccer-power
Netherlands and tough Belgium know that anything less than a
victory in Lyon could bring their stay in France to an early end.
	   Mexico has from the start made it clear its objective is to be
one of two teams from the group to advance to the second round,
while South Korea would be satisfied just to win its first match in
five World Cup finals.
	   ``The match against South Korea is the most important,'' said
Mexico's coach Manuel Lapuente. ``It's our biggest chance of
earning three points, then maybe we can get another with a tie
against Belgium.
	   ``If we don't manage to beat South Korea we'll face a severe
problem against Netherlands and Belgium.''
	   Even before arriving in France, the Koreans pinpointed their
match against Mexico as their best chance for the landmark victory.
They have focused all their attention and effort on the match, as
though it were the World Cup final.
	   ``The match against Mexico is a major preoccupation for us, and
we believe it is a key match for us,'' said Seo Jung-won, who also
played for South Korea in the 1994 World Cup in the United States.
``We think that our level of play has improved drastically since
1994 and we are sure we can win.''
	   Mexico is also anxious to show that a string of poor
performances in warm-up matches ahead of the World Cup are not an
indicator of the team's potential. The team is known as ``El
Tricolor'' for its green, red and white national colors.
	   South Korea knows it's facing a tough opponent.
	   ``Even though Mexico had bad luck in its friendlies before the
World Cup, it is a team with a lot of potential,'' said South
Korean coach Cha Bum-kun, who played for South Korea in the 1986
World Cup finals in Mexico.
	   Mexico is also exercising caution.
	   ``Korea is a hard team, with very fast players,'' said defender
Claudio Suarez. ``They'll be difficult to beat. We'll need to play
well, stay concentrated and beware of breakaways, which they excel
at.
	   ``Technically they have improved in the last 10 years,'' said
Suarez. ``I remember in 1986, the team lost to Italy and Argentina
and had a draw with Bulgaria. This is a very different team from 10
years ago.''
	   In soccer-mad Mexico, where the match will be televised live at
10 a.m. local time, over 55 million people are expected be watch.
	   The South Koreans, meanwhile, are counting on the team to boost
the nation's morale in a time of economic troubles.

<TEXT>
	   VERSAILLES, France (AP) _ About 10 masked men attacked the home
of world-renowned perfumer Jean-Paul Guerlain early Friday,
shooting Guerlain in the thigh and making off with millions of
francs in jewels and money, police said.
	   At least two other employees were also injured when gunfire
erupted as the gang briefly held the entire household hostage,
according to the president of the Guerlain perfume and cosmetics
house, Thibault Ponroy.
	   One of the employees, shot in the stomach, was in critical
condition, Ponroy told The Associated Press. Another was slightly
injured.
	   Ponroy said that Guerlain was operated on Friday morning and was
conscious and chatting with him by telephone hours later. He denied
earlier reports that Guerlain was in critical condition.
	   There was no clear information on the others injured in the
attack at Guerlain's home in the Yvelines region, west of Paris.
	   Exactly how the attack occurred was not immediately clear.
	   Ponroy was quoted by LCI television station as saying that
apparently the armed gang took the entire household hostage in the
attack, which occurred between midnight and 3 a.m.
	   ``In circumstances I am unaware of, a shootout broke out,''
Ponroy said on LCI.
	   Guerlain ``is out of danger,'' Ponroy said. ``He was
complaining. When Jean-Paul complains, he's doing well.''
	   According to French radio, the gang, armed with hunting rifles
and other weapons, made off with their booty in a large car.
	   Police said they stole money and various valuables worth
millions of francs.
	   Guerlain's home, called ``Mesnuls,'' is located near
Montfort-l'Amaury in the Yvelines.
	   On Thursday night, Guerlain presented his new perfume,
``Guerlinade,'' at a show on the Champs-Elysees, the famed Paris
avenue.
	   Guerlain is the great grandson of the founder of the prestigious
perfume and cosmetics house created in 1828.
	   Guerlain has been run by the world's No. 1 luxury group LMVH --
Louis Vuitton Moet-Henessy -- since 1994.

World Cup: Spanish technique, Nigerian spontaneity face off
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CIARAN GILES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NANTES, France (AP) _ Flair and technique versus speed and
spontaneity. That's the bill of fare as Spain's most compact team
in years takes on Olympic champion Nigeria Saturday in the World
Cup opener for both teams.
	   The two are favorites to qualify from Group D, generally
recognized as the closest to a ``Group of Death'' here.
	   ``We're playing the toughest team in the most difficult group,''
said Spain coach Javier Clemente, who calls this the best squad
he's ever had.
	   Spain went 8-2-0 in qualifying and has just one loss in its last
34 outings overall.
	   ``We're worried about Spain the same way Spain is worried about
Nigeria,'' said Nigeria coach Bora Milutinovic, leading his fourth
different team at the tournament. ``I put Spain right after the top
five teams: Brazil, Argentina, Germany, Italy and France.''
	   His Super Eagles come with a reputation for scant attention to
strategy, compensated by dazzling skills and blistering speed. They
displayed those traits in their 1994 cup debut, when they made the
second round and nearly knocked off Italy, and again in winning
Olympic gold in Atlanta two years after.
	   But Nigeria has been consistently bad in its string of warmups
ahead of France 98, dropping three games against fellow qualifiers
by a combined score of 9-1.
	   Clemente, however, believes the warmup results will have no
bearing, saying, ``Nigeria is a sensational team and one of the 10
favorites to win the cup.''
	   Milutinovic saw Spain's 4-1 drubbing of Northern Ireland last
week and said that while he admired the team's discipline, he
spotted some weak points he hopes to exploit.
	   With both teams fearing a morale-damaging defeat at the outset,
the coaches might not be scorned for caution.
	   Relying heavily on stars from European club champion Madrid and
domestic league titlist FC Barcelona, Clemente is likely to play a
conservative 4-4-2 combination with Andoni Zubizarreta, 36, in goal
for his fourth World Cup. Fleet-footed Alfonso Perez would be one
striker, with Kiko Narvaez a little behind.
	   Milutinovic has hinted he might be content to seek a draw
against Spain, which would mean a more contained, defense-minded
Nigeria.
	   That would be attributable, at least in part, to the slew of
injuries.
	   While Spain is healthy, Nigeria already has lost defender Jero
Shakpore to a broken collarbone and replaced him Wednesday with
Mobi Oparaku. In addition, first-choice keeper Ike Shorunmu and
veteran striker Emmanuel Amunike were not even brought to France
because of injury.
	   The team got some good news Thursday, though, when Inter Milan
striker Nwankwo Kanu rejoined the squad for full training. He was
the star of the 1996 effort three months before undergoing heart
valve surgery.
	   His comeback has been slowed by various leg injuries, and an
appearance Saturday would certainly boost the team.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with market closing, new recession prediction, big

 &UR; With BC-Asia Recessions, BC-Asian Markets
 &UR; By LAURINDA KEYS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Following the lead of the Japanese yen and most
Asian currencies, the Singapore dollar fell Friday to a 4 1/2-month
low as a fourth investment house forecast recession this year for
the local economy.
	   But after diving to a 9 1/2 year low earlier in the week, the
key stock index recovered somewhat as buyers grabbed blue chip
shares at bargain prices.
	   Vickers Ballas Investment Research predicted Singapore would
fall into a recession this year. Vickers said the economy will
contract 2 percent during the second half of the year, after an
aggregate 3 percent growth in the first half. It predicted a
full-year growth of gross domestic product of .4 percent.
	   The government has said that later this month it will adjust its
currently rosy 2.5 percent to 4.5 percent GDP prediction for the
year, but is awaiting May financial figures.
	   Traders have said the Singapore dollar is easy to sell because
it is more liquid than other regional currencies and local interest
rates are higher. However, those rates have been dropping as the
currency loses value against the U.S. dollar.
	   The Singapore currency hit its lowest level since late January
at 1.756 against the U.S. dollar. But the Singapore currency
recovered slightly to 1.746 by late afternoon.
	   Its value has been steadily decreasing over the past few months
and is 21.6 percent lower against the U.S. dollar than last July 1,
the day before the Asian economic crisis began.
	   Singapore's benchmark Straits Times Industrial Index dipped 21
points, or 2 percent, immediately after the market opened. By
closing it had regained the day's losses and was up 4.66 points, or
.4 percent.
	   However, the index has lost 889 points, or 45 percent of its
value, since last July 1's level of 1981.28.
	   Bank and property stocks continued to be worst hit.
	   But the electronics sector also took a beating on Friday, when
the Stock Exchange of Singapore Electronics Index fell 7.4 percent
to its lowest level since October, 1996.

	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Share prices in Hong Kong closed generally
higher Friday after three straight sessions of sharp losess.
	   The Hang Seng Index, the market's key indicator of blue chips,
rose 29.37 points, or 0.37 percent, to 7,915.44. On Thursday, the
index had slumped 93.30.
	   Turnover amounted to 5.99 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs
767 million), down from Thursday's 6.75 billion Hong Kong dollars
(U.S. million).
	   Brokers attributed the uptrend to selective bargain-hunting
following recent sharp falls because of the fall of the Japanese
yen against the U.S. dollar.
	   They said the index, which fell at the opening in reaction to
overnight falls on Wall Street, appeared to have found some support
at the 7,900-point level.
	   Among gainers, Hang Seng Bank rose 1.60 Hong Kong dollars to
47.00, Hutchison Whampoa rose 30 cents to 33.20, and Cheung Kong
rose 20 cents to 32.90.
	   Going against the trend were HSBC Holdings, which fell 50 cents
to 176.00, and New World Development, which fell 15 cents to 14.40.

Philippine Airlines pilots' strike enters second week
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ A strike by about 600 Philippine
Airlines pilots entered its second week Friday as government
officials prepared to rule on whether the financially troubled
company can require pilots to retire early.
	   The pilots' union went on strike last week to protest a new
management policy of ordering pilots to retire who have reached 20
years of service or flown 20,000 hours, regardless of age.
	   The policy puts 225 pilots in danger of forced retirement, said
Capt. Sotico Lloren, president of the union.
	   PAL, however, said it was not a unilateral management policy but
a provision in a collective bargaining agreement signed by airline
and union officials.
	   PAL flight attendants and ground crew threatened Thursday to
join the strike by the 620-strong Airline Pilots Association of the
Philippines if the company institutes layoffs to cut costs.
	   On Wednesday, the airline announced it will no longer accept
back the striking pilots and will sharply scale back its
operations.
	   PAL said it plans to concentrate on domestic operations and use
some of its Boeing 747 jets, previously used for long-haul flights,
for shorter domestic routes emanating from Manila.
	   It currently has only 25 management pilots _ senior pilots who
train other pilots.
	   The airline has previously announced plans to cut staff, slash
costs and reduce flights to survive its long-term financial
problems.
	   President Fidel Ramos ordered labor department officials to find
ways to achieve a settlement of the dispute. However, a series of
government-mediated meetings between airline and union
representatives ended without success.
	   PAL said the strike has cost it about 150 million pesos (dlrs
3.8 million) a day in lost revenue. It lost 8 billion pesos (dlrs
205 million) last fiscal year _ three times more than the previous
year.

Greenpeace floats ``anti-nuclear'' balloon over Indian monument

	   AGRA, India (AP) _ Greenpeace protesters chose India's most
recognizable monument _ the Taj Mahal _ as the site of a protest
Friday, floating an Earth-shaped hot air balloon draped with
anti-nuclear banners about 200 meters (yards) from the 345-year-old
tomb.
	   Greenpeace spokeswoman Luisa Colasimone said about 30 soldiers
surrounded the balloon when it touched down after the early morning
protest in a field across a river from the Taj Mahal. She said four
protesters were being detained, but it was not clear whether they
would be arrested.
	   Indian authorities can be zealous about protecting the tomb
known worldwide as a monument to love. The Supreme Court recently
ordered nearby factories to close because pollution is blamed for
yellowing the Taj Mahal's white marble walls. Last year, musician
Yanni was required to keep the volume down at an outdoor concert
held nearby for fear noise vibrations would worsen cracks that have
begun to show on the monument.
	   Greenpeace, which has campaigned against nuclear weapons since
it was formed in 1971, has sharply criticized last month's
tit-for-tat nuclear testing by India and neighboring Pakistan.
	   ``Becoming a nuclear weapons state should be an embarrassment to
every citizen,'' Simon Carroll, who led the Greenpeace balloon
protest, said in a statement. He also called on the traditional
nuclear powers _ Britain, China, France, Russia and the United
States _ to destroy their stockpiles of nuclear weapons.
	   The environmental group is known for headline-grabbing protests
in which demonstrators against factory fishing in the United States
spent nearly two days suspended by ropes from a bridge and another
in which their Rainbow Warrior sailed into France's South Pacific
nuclear testing sites.
	   The Taj Mahal is located in Agra, 200 kilometers (125 miles)
south of New Delhi and some 600 kilometers (375 miles) east of
India's nuclear test site. Greenpeace organizers said they wanted
to stage their protest at a place the world would recognize as
Indian.
	   The Greenpeace balloon drew a small crowd of villagers Friday,
while across the river tourists at the Taj Mahal gathered along the
back wall of the complex to watch the balloon take off, hover about
50 feet (16 meters) and land.

Netanyahu meets with opposition leader; talk of unity government
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; ADDS report of CIA chief meeting with Netanyahu and Arafat, graf 4
 &UR; By DINA KRAFT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met with the
leader of the opposition Friday amid reports that a unity
government might be under consideration as a way to overcome
right-wing objections to a West Bank withdrawal.
	   Right-wing members of Netanyahu's governing coalition have
repeatedly threatened to bring down his government if he goes ahead
with a much-delayed Israeli troop withdrawal from the West Bank.
The United States is pushing for a 13 percent pullback from the
territory which Israel seized from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast war.
	   The U.S. plan, which not been officially announced although many
its details have been disclosed, is an attempt by the Americans to
re-start the peace process which broke down 15 months ago.
	   In another U.S. effort to move the process forward, CIA Director
George Tenet met separately this week with Netanyahu and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and reportedly passed messages
about security coordination between the two leaders.
	   Netanyahu told a delegation of American Jews on Friday that an
agreement would be signed only after the Palestinian fulfill their
obligations. Israel has repeatedly called on the Palestinian
Authority to do more to crack down on terror groups as a condition
for continuing the peace process.
	   ``When we have an agreement that achieves our security needs and
that the Palestinians comply with, then I will give it to the
government'' for approval, Netanyahu said.
	   Meir Sheetreet of the ruling Likud party said it was time for
the withdrawal to be carried out and said that the formation of a
unity government was an option.
	   ``The prime minister needs to finish up with second
redeployment,'' Sheetreet told Army Radio, ``If the extreme right
threatens to topple the government we will work towards
establishing a unity government.''
	   Netanyahu met Friday morning with Ehud Barak, head of the Labor
Party, but his aides denied that the two discussed formation of a
unity government.
	   In an interview with Israel Radio, Barak did not address the
possibility of a unity government, but stressed the importance of
the decisions currently being made for the future of Israel.
	   ``A decision on the character of an agreement with the
Palestinians will influence lives, in the best case scenario, or
conversely, God forbid, the deaths of people. Extremely fateful
issues are at hand,'' Barak said.
	   Meanwhile, the prospect of holding a national referendum on the
West Bank withdrawal has been gaining momentum in government
circles.
	   A show of public support could be another strategy for Netanyahu
to the weather the political storm that authorizing a withdrawal
would bring.
	   Following Netanyahu's hour long meeting with Barak, the prime
minister was meeting with Rabbi Avraham Shapira, a spiritual leader
of the National Religious Party who opposes any West Bank
withdrawal.
	   Jewish settlers continued their campaign against a withdrawal
Friday, taking five flights of Likud members over the West Bank.

WTO chief: countries must cooperate on free trade and environment,
</HEADLINE>
labor policies &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Freeing-up of trade will continue, despite claims
that it ignores and causes environmental and labor problems, World
Trade Organization chief Renato Ruggiero pledged.
	   But countries must cooperate more to reconcile liberalization
with those concerns, Ruggiero said in a speech to the Hamburg-based
Friedrich Ebert Foundation.
	   ``We must stop viewing the world through a narrow lens and begin
to look at the various challenges we face as pieces of a larger
puzzle demanding broader, more integrated solutions,'' Ruggiero
said in his speech Thursday, a copy of which was released in Geneva
Friday.
	   In the face of protests that the free trade system ignores and
contributes to poverty, unemployment and environmental problems,
ministers last month told the WTO to prepare for talks to further
open up the world economy.
	   But President Bill Clinton and others pledged to try to make the
organization and the global trade system more open and sensitive to
environmental and labor concerns.
	   Ruggiero said the best way to address the worries is through the
system itself. ``If people, especially young people, say
unemployment is too high, they are right. If environmentalists say
growth must be sustainable - and not destroy the planet's essential
equilibrium - they are right.
	   ``But none of these international - and national - problems will
be resolved any easier by restricting trade, closing borders, or
undermining the international rule of law - as embodied in the
WTO.''
	   Ruggiero said the WTO's success was built on a broadening
international consensus. ``We will only reach durable global
solutions to the environment or labor issues ... by constructing
the same kind of international consensus from the bottom up,'' he
said.
	   The WTO committee on trade and the environment needs ``a new
sense of dynamism,'' Ruggiero said. The process to revitalize the
link between the two issues would begin with a ``thorough
preparatory process,'' he added.
	   Much greater technical and policy coordination is needed at the
national as well as international level. National delegations must
bring a ``coherent and consistent message to the negotiating
table.''
	   ``Trade liberalization must be supportive of environmental
objectives; but environmental policies must also be supportive or
growth and development through trade liberalization,'' Ruggiero
concluded by saying.

with assault rifles took up positions throughout Lagos on Friday in
anticipation of protests against the country's ruling military
junta.
	   The normally cluttered congestion of morning traffic had fallen

confrontation with either the authorities or opposition activists
who were planning to march on the city.

Report: Police say opposition gatherings are seditious
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with opposition party facing dissent. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysian police have blocked
public gatherings by opposition groups because they include
seditious discussions and question the nation's judiciary, a
newspaper reported Friday.
	   A meeting of the main opposition group, the Democratic Action
Party, was disbanded by police Wednesday night because some
speakers had ridiculed the judiciary, Police Spokesman Ghazali Amin
was quoted as saying by Friday's Star newspaper.
	   ``The police view cases under the Sedition Act very seriously as
the existence of this act is to prevent any hostility and disorder
in a multi-racial society like Malaysia,'' he said.
	   Despite the police ban, Malaysia's main opposition party has
vowed to press ahead with meetings. A meeting in the southern town
of Johor was held Thursday night without problems because it had a
previous police clearance, said party chief Lim Kit Siang.
	   Four party leaders, including deputy secretary general Lim Guan
Eng, were briefly arrested at Wednesday's dinner meeting.
	   The gathering was organized to generate sympathy for Lim, who
recently received two concurrent 18-month jail sentences for
sedition and violating a publishing act. He is appealing against
the convictions.
	   If police view expression of support for Lim Guan as sedition
then ``it is a sad day for Malaysia,'' said Lim Kit Siang, the
convicted leader's father.
	   Calling demands for reform sedition would make many Malaysians
guilty of the offense, he said.
	   It was the fourth time in two weeks that police have broken up
opposition gatherings, prompting accusations of a clampdown on free
speech.
	   But authorities have denied there was a blanket ban saying these
particular meetings were not permitted because they could have
jeopardized public peace and security.

Official Libyan agency calls Gadhafi attack `lies'
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Reports that Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi
was wounded in an assassination attempt last week are ``lies and
cheap allegations,'' the official Libyan news agency said.
	   Libyans arriving in Egypt said the attack took place June 1 on a
coastal road in eastern Libya when Gadhafi was en route to Egypt
for an official visit. The Libyan leader was slightly wounded in
the elbow and one of his female bodyguards was killed, they said.
	   The account could not be confirmed and diplomats in the Libyan
capital, Tripoli, said they had not heard of the incident.
	   The reports amount to ``a flood of lies and cheap allegations,''
the Libyan news agency JANA said late Thursday.
	   It said the reports were circulated by ``a bribed agent,'' but
did not say what country was responsible.
	   Gadhafi was scheduled to visit Egypt for nine days beginning
June 2, but the trip was postponed to June 5. That trip was then
canceled and no explanation was given. President Hosni Mubarak of
Egypt said it was put off because Gadhafi had tonsillitis.

Foreign investments total dlrs 150 million in Crimea
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) - The volume of foreign investment in the
economy of Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula stood at dlrs 150 million as
of Jan. 1 this year, the autonomous republic's deputy trade
minister said Friday.
	   Foreign investments grew by dlrs 16.7 million since early 1997,
said the official, Alexei Verchenko.
	   Russia accounted for 62 percent of the investments, followed by
the United States, Britain, Germany and Turkey, he said, according
to the Interfax news agency.
	   Foreigners have invested in 120 Crimean enterprises, located
mainly in the south and in the capital Simferopol, which are
producing machinery, fuel, foodstuffs and other goods, Verchenko
added.
	   Crimea, a top resort area during the Soviet days, long has been
awaiting an economic and tourist boom. But the situation in Crimea
is complicated by the peninsula's underdeveloped economy and
political tensions.
	   Populated mostly by ethnic Russians, the Black Sea peninsula was
part of Russia before being transferred to the jurisdiction of
Soviet Ukraine in the 1950s. Many ethnic Russians dream of
returning to Moscow rule.

South Korea's richest man to visit North Korea with 500 cows as
</HEADLINE>
gift
 &UR; EDs: UPDATES with details of agreement on the transfer

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ South Korea's richest man plans to
herd 500 cows into North Korea next week in a cattle drive aimed at
cracking open the world's most heavily guarded border.
	   Chung Ju-yung, owner of the giant Hyundai group, is to drive the
cattle through Panmunjom, the tiny truce village in the center of
the Demilitarized Zone that separates the two Koreas.
	   Barring last-minute hitches, the cows will be given to North
Korea as a gift and Chung will spend eight days looking into
business opportunities in the North.
	   The South Korean government said Friday that both it and the
communist government of North Korea have approved Chung's visit,
beginning Tuesday.
	   Unification Ministry officials said Chung will cross the border
along with eight family members. The cows will be transported on 50
Hyundai trucks.
	   Six other members of his entourage, mostly Hyundai executives,
will fly to North Korea by way of Beijing and join the Chung family
later, they said.
	   Working officials of both Koreas met at Panmunjom on Friday and
agreed that the cows will be trucked into the North one hour before
the South Korean tycoon and his family walk across the border into
the North.
	   Seoul government officials said North Korea rejected a request
by South Korean reporters for permission to let them temporarily
cross the border inside Panmunjom to cover the transfer of cows.
	   Chung's visit comes as South Korea is trying to induce its
reclusive, hunger-stricken northern neighbor to open itself to the
world.
	   It will be Chung's second visit to North Korea, where he was
born 82 years ago. He visited his hometown in 1989 and agreed to
several joint venture business projects, including a ship repair
yard.
	   The cows are part of a gift Chung has promised to give North
Korea in return for his visit. He gave the North 10,000 tons of
corn in May and is committed to ship an additional 500 cows and
40,000 tons of corn later this year.
	   Chung will be the first South Korean civilian to visit North
Korea via Panmunjom for private purposes. The village is where the
truce was signed that ended the 1950-53 Korean War.
	   The Koreas were divided into the communist North and the
capitalist South in 1945. Their border is sealed, with nearly 2
million troops deployed on both sides.
	   Seoul government officials said they authorized Chung's visit
under President Kim Dae-jung's ``sunshine policy,'' which calls for
engaging North Korea rather than isolating it.
	   South Korean businessmen now can freely carry out trade and
investment in North Korea. Hyundai officials said that during his
stay in the North, Chung will discuss business opportunities.
	   The Seoul government also is prodding the United States to
follow suit and ease its economic sanctions against North Korea.

Official Libyan agency calls Gadhafi attack `lies'
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Reports that Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi
was wounded in an assassination attempt last week are ``lies and
cheap allegations,'' the official Libyan news agency said.
	   Libyans arriving in Egypt said the attack took place June 1 on a
coastal road in eastern Libya while Gadhafi was en route to Egypt
for an official visit. The Libyan leader was slightly wounded in
the elbow and one of his female bodyguards was killed, they said.
	   The account could not be confirmed and diplomats in the Libyan
capital, Tripoli, said they had not heard of the incident.
	   The reports amount to ``a flood of lies and cheap allegations,''
the Libyan news agency JANA said late Thursday.
	   It said the reports were circulated by ``a bribed agent,'' but
did not say what country was responsible.
	   Gadhafi was scheduled to visit Egypt for nine days beginning
June 2, but the trip was postponed to June 5. That trip was then
canceled and no explanation was given.
	   President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt said it was put off because
Gadhafi had tonsillitis.

Coors offers to take over Korean brewery
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Coors Brewing Co. of the United States
proposed on Friday investing dlrs 100 million to take over South
Korea's troubled third largest brewery, Korean bank officials said.
	   But Coors, based in Golden, Colorado, demanded that creditor
banks of Jinro-Coors Brewing Co. first write off more than half of
the company's dlrs 481 million debt and turn the rest into equity.
	   Commercial Bank of Korea and other creditors said they would
respond to the proposal by the end of this month.
	   Jinro-Coors is now running under court receivership after its
mother company, Jinro, went bankrupt last September.
	   The brewery first started as a joint-venture between Coors and
South Korea's Jinro conglomerate in 1992. It now controls 20
percent of the country's annual dlrs 2 billion beer market.
	   In an investment proposal, Coors recently sold its 33-percent
stake to Jinro and then began negotiating to take over the whole
brewery.

Refugee flow to Montenegro continues, U.N. says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The influx of refugees into Albania from Kosovo
has ``abated considerably,'' but a flow into neighboring Montenegro
continues, the U.N. refugee agency said Friday.
	   Refugees are arriving in Montenegro from the troubled Yugoslav
province at a rate of some 350 per day, compared with around 150
new arrivals in Albania Thursday, said Kris Janowski, spokesman for
the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees.
	   Around 9,000 refugees have fled to the Yugoslav republic of
Montenegro since tension between Serbian authorities and the ethnic
Albanian majority in Kosovo flared up earlier this year.
	   ``About 30 percent of those people are ethnic Serbs,'' Janowski
said. In that group, ``there are a lot of young men who apparently
took off since they don't want to be drawn into the conflict or
drafted.''
	   The agency estimates the total number of refugees displaced by
the conflict at around 65,000.
	   UNHCR has expressed concern over the situation of some 13,000
Serbs relocated to Kosovo from Croatia and Bosnia, some of whom
have sought safety in the province's capital, Pristina.
	   Janowski said the agency is also addressing an accommodation
problem in the Montenegro coastal town of Ulcinj, where many ethnic
Albanians have fled.
	   Hotel owners in the resort ``essentially don't want to fill
their facilities with displaced people,'' he said.
	   Meanwhile, the Norwegian air force has agreed to lift emergency
supplies from Sarajevo to Tirana in an operation expected to start
Saturday and last a maximum four days, Janowski said.
	   It is expected to fly between two and four times a day, using
standard C-130 military transport planes.
	   ``We have been in touch with other NATO nations'' with a view to
getting supplies airlifted from Tirana to cope with some 12,000
refugees in northern Albania, Janowski said.

France, Germany, Japan contract for new Singapore trains
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ French and Japanese train technology will be
used in Singapore's two new Mass Rapid Transit lines, including an
airport connection service and a driverless, underground Northeast
Line.
	   The contracts worth 800 million Singapore dollars (dlrs 460
million) were signed Friday. Communications Minister Mah Bow Tan
also announced a third new line will be completed by 2004.
	   The 13-kilometer (8-mile), 1.75 billion Singapore dollar (dlrs 1
billion) project will connect the developing, downtown Marina
district with the Orchard Road shopping and residential area.
	   When airline travelers board the new Changi Airport Line,
scheduled for completion next century, they'll be riding in 25
Japanese carriages built by a Kawasaki/Nippon/Sharyo joint venture,
Mah announced.
	   On the Northeast Line, now under construction, the automatic,
electric trains _ operated by computer and monitored via two-way
televisions in each passenger compartment _ will be built by
France's GEC Alsthom Transport SA.
	   The signaling system and platform doors that will be
synchronized with the automatic trains will be built by GEC Alsthom
in a joint venture with a Singapore company.
	   Computers will allow the 25 trains on the 20-kilometer (12-mile)
Northeast Line to arrive as fast as every 90 seconds on the route
through Chinatown, along the Singapore River, past the prime
minister's residence and Orchard Road.
	   Maintenance, management, communications and other systems for
the 5 billion Singapore dollar (dlrs 2.86 billion) Northeast Line
project will be built by France's Spie Enertrans and SYSECA; and
Japan's Mitsubishi Corp., Mitsubishi Electric, Itocho Corp., and
Mitsui and Co.
	   Other contracts went to Singapore companies and joint ventures.
Contracts for an automatic fare collection system, and tunnel
ventilation have not yet been awarded.
	   Germany's Schoma Christoph Schottler Maschinenfabrik won a
contract to build locomotives to upgrade existing subway lines,
which will also be getting 16 new cars.
	   Mah said Singapore plans to double its rapid transit network
within the next 10 years and make it comparable to the London
Underground, the Paris Metro or the Tokyo subway.

Malaysia's PM again rules out foreign aid
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's prime minister on
Friday ruled out the possibility of Malaysia borrowing overseas
funds to help it ride out the economic downturn.
	   Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad reiterated that Malaysia doesn't
have excessive foreign debt, the national news agency Bernama
reported Friday. Because of that, the nation could handle its
economic problems without foreign aid.
	   ``A country heavily indebted to another will find itself unable
to repay the loans, and as such, has to bow to the demand of
foreign powers,'' he told his party supporters in Terengganu state
on the east coast of Malaysia.
	   Mahathir likely was setting the tone for his major economic
speech to be delivered at the governing United Malays National
Organization party assembly next week.
	   The prime minister has persistently resisted the idea of calling
in the International Monetary Fund to help Malaysia out of its
economic slump.
	   He has argued repeatedly that IMF programs curb governments from
operating effectively, leaving countries with limited options in
policy making and vulnerable to being ``colonized'' by Western
nations.
	   Malaysia is facing the threat of recession as its economy
absorbs the impact of the Asian financial crisis. In the first
quarter of this year, the economy shrank 1.8 percent, compared the
robust 6.9 percent growth in the last quarter of 1997.
	   The government is standing by its 2 percent to 3 percent growth
forecast for 1998, but many economists expect the economy could
shrink by up to 3 percent or more.

McGuire stays on top in Suntory Ladies Open
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KOBE, Japan (AP) _ Marnie McGuire shot a 1-under-par 71 Friday
to stay ahead with a two-stroke lead midway through the 50 million
yen (dlrs 352,000) Suntory Ladies Open.
	   The 29-year-old New Zealander, winner of four tournaments on the
Japan tour, birdied the last three holes in a round of five birdies
and four bogeys for a 5-under 139 total. She had a one-stroke lead
overnight.
	   ``I was putting well but had a poor iron play today,'' said
McGuire, in contention for her first title in Japan since winning
the 1996 Mitsubishi Cup. ``I'll just try to play without the sense
of urgency to win.''
	   Veteran Hiromi Takamura fired the day's best round of 68 and
shared second place at 141 with Keiko Suzuki, who shot a 72.
	   Lee Young-me and her South Korean compatriot Kim Ae-sook shot
71s to share fourth at 142 with Nayoko Yoshikawa and four others.
	   Lee and Kim are seeking their second victory of the season,
while Yoshikawa is aiming at her first title for the season and
30th overall.

German officials to revoke passport of former Nazi SS officer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ Bavarian officials said Friday they have
begun proceedings to revoke the German passport of a former Nazi SS
officer, which would allow his extradition to the Czech Republic to
face war crimes charges.
	   Czech officials have said they want to retry the 86-year-old
suspect, Anton Malloth, for the murders of inmates at a World War
II concentration camp. They argue that his German citizenship is
invalid and therefore cannot protect him from extradition.
	   Malloth, born in 1912 in Austria, took Italian citizenship after
World War I, then became a German in 1939 _ after Germany had
annexed Austria _ so he could join the SS.
	   He was a guard during World War II at the Theresienstadt
concentration camp, near Prague. In 1948, a Czechoslovak court
convicted him of hundreds of murders at a Gestapo prison in the
camp and sentenced him to death.
	   But he had fled to Italy and reclaimed his Italian citizenship.
Rome revoked it, however, in 1956 after finding he lied about his
SS past.
	   He was deported in 1988, but to Germany because he still had
German papers. He has lived since then on welfare in a retirement
home in Pullach, near Munich.
	   The Bavarian Interior Ministry had asked Italian officials to
help settle Mamlloth's citizenship. In a statement Friday, state
secretary Hermann Regensburger said they had determined that
Malloth has been stateless since 1956.
	   Regensburger said thse process to revoke Malloth's passport
began Wednesday. He said he could not estimate how long it would
take, since Malloth could challenge the decision in court.
	   Asked whether Malloth would be extradited, he said the state had
yet to receive an official request from Prague.

Chinese authorities evict Tibetan nuns, wreck temple, group says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Chinese authorities have forcibly evicted Tibetan
Buddhist nuns from a cave sanctuary and wrecked nearby temples to
curb a religious resurgence in Tibet, a monitoring group reported
Friday.
	   About 50 nuns, their Buddhist lama and an unspecified number of
other followers were expelled from the temples and meditation caves
at Drag Yerpa in April, the London-based Tibet Information Network
said, citing unidentified Tibetan sources and tourists.
	   Laborers under orders from the local government demolished the
temples so quickly the clerics apparently did not have time to
salvage altars, the group reported. Photographs given to the group
showed parts of shrines lying amid the rubble.
	   Tibet Information Network said it had confirmed that at least
three other monasteries have been closed down in Tibet since China
launched a campaign more than two years ago to purge the clergy of
monks and nuns supporting independence for the Himalayan region.
	   The crusade has banned photographs of the Dalai Lama, the exiled
head of Tibet's theocratic government that China's communist forces
defeated in 1951. Clergy members have been told to denounce the
Dalai Lama or face expulsion.
	   In one case, at Jonang Kumbum monastery in western Tibet,
officials carrying out the campaign in September 1996 pointed
pistols at the heads of monks to force the denunciations, Tibet
Information Network said. The monastery was later closed.
	   At Drag Yerpa, 30 kilometers (20 miles) northeast of the Tibetan
capital, Lhasa, nuns refused to leave their meditation caves,
prompting the authorities to come evict them, the group said.
	   ``They grabbed their hands, dragged them down from the caves and
put them in the vehicles,'' the group quoted a Tibetan source as
saying.
	   Tibetans believe the Drag Yerpa caves were once used by
Padmasambhava, the mystic who brought esoteric tantric Buddhism to
Tibet in the 8th century. Twenty temples and monasteries dotted the
region before China began outlawing Tibetan Buddhism following an
abortive uprising against Chinese rule in 1959.
	   Chinese authorities insisted the Drag Yerpa temples, built since
bans on religion were relaxed in the 1980s, had to be demolished
because they were not located exactly on the site of pre-1959
structures, Tibet Information Network said.

Report: Russian missile parts reach Cyprus
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: UPDATES with denial, quotes from Greek embassy spokesman; ADDS
background &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkish intelligence say that radar and
control panels for five Russian-made air-defense missile systems
have reached the divided Mediterranean island of Cyprus, a leading
newspaper reported Friday.
	   But Greek embassy spokesman Nikos Papaconstantinou said the
Hurriyet report was unfounded.
	   Hurriyet said the parts were transferred from ship to ship in
several Mediterranean ports to elude surveillance by Turkey, which
has threatened to use force to stop their deployment.
	   It also said that three Russian military delegations earlier
this week began training the Greek Cypriot army on how to use the
air-defense systems. Turkey claims the missiles could also be used
to launch an attack that threatens the Turkish Cypriot side of the
island _ and Turkey itself.
	   ``Cyprus has recently decided to bring the missiles to the
island in October or November,'' Papaconstantinou said. ``It adds
more time for discussions to see how to overcome the impasse.''
	   Cyprus has said it is ready to cancel the dlrs 200 million
missile deal if there is substantial progress toward the
reunification of the island and if Turkey accepts its proposal for
demilitarization.
	   Unidentified Turkish foreign ministry officials said the
postponement of the whole missile shipment would not change Turkish
opposition, the Anatolia news agency reported Friday.
	   Papaconstinou also repeated Greek arguments that the missiles
were purely defensive and would pose no threat to anyone.
	   ``But threatening to use force against them is worrisome,'' he
said.
	   Russian embassy officials were not available for comment.

Report: Malaysia halts new intake of foreign doctors
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The government has banned the
recruitment of doctors from overseas in public hospitals to stanch
the outflow of foreign exchange from Malaysia's troubled economy,
an official said Friday.
	   Nevertheless, experienced foreign doctors who were willing to
work in rural areas would be allowed to remain, the national news
agency Bernama reported, quoting Health Minister Chua Jui Meng.
	   ``Many of them whose contracts are expiring have expressed the
desire to continue service. I think it is sensible to allow them to
continue service,'' he was quoted as saying.
	   Chua said many foreign doctors were prepared to work in the
sparsely-populated Malaysian states of Sabah and Sarawak on Borneo
island.
	   Out of the 704 positions available, the government has approved
or renewed the contracts of 426 medical officers and specialists
who come mostly from India, Pakistan and Bangladesh.
	   On Monday, the health minister also announced that Malaysia
would no longer recruit nurses from abroad. He said the shortage of
staff in state hospitals could be filled by deploying more than
3,000 local trainee nurses.
	   Many foreign workers repatriate their savings to their home
countries after converting them into dollars or their respective
local currencies, thus tapping into the nation's foreign exchange
reserves.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with U.S.-Russian meeting; Lead expected
after Solana news conference, rescheduled to 1435 GMT. &QL; 
 &UR; By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Military Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen,
in talks Friday with his Russian counterpart, warned that Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic should ``get the message'' and rein in
his forces in the separatist province of Kosovo, U.S. officials
said.
	   Cohen's meeting with Russian Defense Minister Gen. Igor Sergeyev
came a day after the NATO alliance approved a show-of-force air
exercise over Yugoslav neighbors Albania and Macedonia. NATO also
ordered options be drawn up for possible intervention in Kosovo,
including direct air strikes or the use of ground troops.
	   Russia opposes the military options NATO is considering for the
Serbian province. But a U.S. official present at Friday's 45-minute
meeting at NATO headquarters said it was ``very friendly and frank
throughout.''
	   Cohen and Sergeyev ``agreed ... the violence must stop,'' said
the defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity. Sergeyev
``stressed the importance of the diplomatic approach'' and pointed
to a meeting Monday in Moscow between Milosevic and President Boris
Yeltsin on the Balkan situation.
	   For his part, Cohen stressed NATO's dim view of the violence in
Kosovo and said the alliance's intentions should not be
misunderstood, the official said.
	   ``Milosevic should get the message of our seriousness,'' the
official said, adding that those fighting for independence in
Kosovo also should put down their weapons.
	   On Thursday, NATO Secretary General Javier Solana said that
Russia advised the alliance it would not participate in NATO's
plans for an air exercise over Albania and Macedonia. The alliance
hopes the show of military strength can persuade Milosevic to halt
attacks on ethnic Albanian separatists in Kosovo.
	   ``We would like to have as many partners as possible participate
in the exercise,'' Solana said.
	   Russia, which has been brought into some NATO consultations, had
been kept informed of plans for potential military exercises in the
Balkans and at one time had ``showed an interest in
participating,'' Solana said. That was before the most recent
outbreak of violence in Kosovo and NATO's announcement of its air
maneuvers.
	   Moscow favors strengthened control over Kosovo's borders with
Albania and Macedonia. Russia could play a pivotal role in the
persuading Milosevic to turn around the crisis in the
independence-minded province of Serbia, Yugoslavia's dominant
republic.
	   On Thursday, NATO ministers approved a package they hope will
persuade Milosevic to pull back his Serb-led army and police forces
in the province.
	   ``President Milosevic would be rash and foolish if he would
ignore the message coming from NATO,'' said British Defense
Secretary George Robertson. ``The message is clear and unambiguous:
`Belgrade, think again.'''
	   Under the measures, NATO will conduct simulated air attacks in
Albania and Macedonia, probably next week, and study options for
further actions ranging from accelerated planning for military
exercises to direct air strikes inside Yugoslavia and use of ground
troops.
	   This is aimed at persuading Milosevic to do three things:
declare a cease-fire in Kosovo; withdraw his forces and end the
repression of the ethnic Albanians; and open serious negotiations
with the opposition.
	   German Defense Minister Volker Ruehe said: ``We cannot afford
any longer to focus on hollow solutions of rather symbolic
character like border security missions in Albania or Macedonia.''
	   More than 250 people have died in clashes between government
forces and the Kosovo Liberatie movement. Ethnic Albanians comprise
90 percent of the province's population.

Ethiopians to bury civilians killed in Eritrean bombing
</HEADLINE>

Eritreans. CHANGES byline &QL;

	   ADIGRAT, Ethiopia (AP) _ Townspeople buried two of the victims
of an Eritrean air attack, but the other two were so disfigured in
the bombing that they could not be identified on Friday.
	   Another 30 people were wounded in the bombing, some of them
needing to have limbs amputated.
	   The Eritrean government said in a statement it bombed the
northeastern border town of Adigrat because the Ethiopians had
turned it into ``the main garrison for reinforcing the invading
Ethiopian army and a center for army logistics.''
	   But Ethiopian government spokeswoman Salome Tadesse, speaking in
the capital Addis Ababa, said the attack was ``an act of
desperation'' following ground fighting on two fronts Thursday.
	   Salome said Eritrean forces were ``heavily defeated'' in both
ground clashes, but Eritrea claimed Ethiopian forces were repulsed.
There had been no new clashes as of Friday morning, Salome said.
	   Ethiopian forces wiped out an entire Eritrean division in the
Thursday fighting at Bure, along the eastern border in the region
of the important Eritrean Red Sea port of Assab, Salome said. She
also laimed that two Eritrean tanks and three anti-aircraft guns
were captured in fighting on the norther Badme-Shiraro front.
	   Eritrean helicopters and warplanes dropped at least eight bombs
on Adigrat on Thursday evening. Two of the bombs hit a combined
industrial-residential area in the town of 40,000, setting grain
warehouses on fire.
	   Four people were killed and more than 30 wounded, said Emmanuel
Gesese, a doctor at the local hospital.
	   Adigrat is about 20 kilometers (12 miles) southwest of Zala
Ambessa, the border town captured by Eritrean forces last week.
Eritreans said it was being used to supply the Ethiopian
counter-offensive on Zala Ambessa.
	   Eritreans working in ``strategic and sensitive'' Ethiopian state
enterprises such as telecommunications and power companies have
been ordered to take a one-month leave but could stay in the
country, Salome said Friday.
	   Several Eritrean businessmen who have allegedly raised money fo
the war effort will be expelled soon, she said.
	   Eritrea accuses Ethiopia of provoking the air attack on Adigrat
by bombing the military-civilian airport at the Eritrean capital of
Asmara on June 5 and 6. A week after those attacks, the Eritrean
Foreign Ministry said for the first time that four civilians had
been killed and 26 wounded in those bombings.
	   Journalists at the airport in the immediate aftermath of the
bombings saw only a handful of wounded, and diplomats reported just
one dead. At the nearest hospital, Halibet, six people, including
one civilian, were being treated for their wounds Thursday.
	   Eritrean rebels fought Ethiopia for 30 years to gain
independence. They succeeded in 1993, two years after helping
Ethiopian rebels under Meles Zenawi _ who is now prime minister _
oust a 17-year military dictatorship. Relations betwen the two
countries deteriorated last year after Eritrea introduced its own
currency, and the clashes began May 6.
	   Rwandan Vice President and Defense Minister Paul Kagame, whose
country along with the United States has authored a peace plan,
returned to Addis Ababa on Thursday. There was no indication
whether the presence of Kagame, Rwanda's de facto leader, indicated
an advance in the plan's prospects.
	   Ethiopia has already voiced support for the plan, which calls
for Eritrea to retreat to the positions it held before fighting
broke out. Eritrea has said the plan needs more work, specifically
that details are needed on how the disputed border would be
demarcated.
	   Regional military sources say the plan calls for Rwanda to
supply peacekeepers to enforce demilitarization of the disputed
border regions.

Woman imitating Titanic film scene plunges to death from ship
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ A Norwegian woman imitating a scene from the
Oscar-winning movie ``Titanic'' lost her grip on a ship's railing
and plunged into the ocean off western Sweden, where she vanished
and is presumed dead, an Oslo newspaper reported Friday.
	   The woman, identified only as being in her 30s, was aboard the
enormous ferry ``Queen of Scandinavia'' on an overnight run from
Oslo to Copenhagen when she climbed over a railing and hung outside
the ship. She lost her grip and plunged 20 meters (65 feet) into
the ocean off Varberg, in southern Sweden, at about 2:30 a.m. (0030
GMT) Thursday.
	   The Oslo newspaper Dagbladet, citing witnesses and a friend of
the woman, said she had talked about the ``Titanic'' scene, and
then set out to imitate it.
	   In the film sequence Rose, played by Kate Winslet, hangs over a
railing on the vessel in a suicide attempt until Leonardo Di
Caprio's character Jack persuades her to climb back on board. A
romance blossoms between the two, only to be cut short when the
Titanic hits an iceberg and sinks.
	   Despite rescue efforts by the ferry, as well as Swedish ships
and helicopters, no trace of the Norwegian woman was immediately
found. Rescuers told the newspaper she was presumed dead.

South Norway's airports shut down by strike
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ An air traffic controllers strike shut down
south Norway's airports on Friday, forcing airlines to bus
passengers to Sweden and grounding helicopters needed to bring
crews and equipment to the country's offshore oil platforms.
	   The Academic Union stepped up a two-week strike by ordering
about 235 civil aviation workers to leave their posts in a dispute
over pay. The strike grounded all flights south of the city of
Trondheim, which is about 500 kilometers (300 miles) north of Oslo.
Airports in the sparsely-ppopulated northern part of the country
were operating normally.
	   Airlines and travel agencies rented more than 100 buses to take
international passengers from the country's main airport, Oslo's
Fornebu, on 4 1/2 hour ride to the Landvetter airport in Goteborg,
Sweden.
	   ``We won't have room in the buses for all the passengers, so
we're asking people to consider whether they really must travel,''
Hanne Bugel, of the SAS airline in Oslo, said by telephone. She
said they were mainly trying to transport passengers with
connecting flights to London, Newark, N.J. and Frankfurt, Germany.
	   The Norwegian airline Braathens said about 20,000 people would
be affected this weekend on its flights alone.
	   Anne Marie Storli, spokeswoman for the striking union, said all
regular flights in southern Norway were grounded by the strike, but
medical, military and rescue flights, as well as those bringing
crews home from North Sea oil platforms, would be allowed.
	   Kai Neilsen, of the Norwegian state oil company Statoil, said
there was no immediate impact on the country's roughly three
million barrel per day oil production. He said it was difficult to
predict how long it would take for the strike to disrupt oil flows.
	   ``In general, probably about a week, because we can't get new
crews out there,'' he said by telephone. He said offshore workers
usually put in two-week shifts, but that contracts allow companies
to extend that stay with one additional week.
	   He said technical problems aboard the platforms could also
disrupt production, if companies cannot fly experts out to the
fields.
	   The Academics Union ordered a strike on May 28 after rejecting
pay raises of about six percent offered to its members employed in
the public sector. It has slowly stepped up the strike to its
current level of about 4,000 people.

Pope receives Arafat, supports peace process
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ Pope John Paul II met Friday with Yasser
Arafat and assured the Palestinian leader of the Vatican's support
to get the stalled Middle peace process rolling.
	   A Vatican statement following the 13-minute meeting said Arafat
informed the pope of the ``tragic situation in which the
Palestinian people finds itself, while the peace process is
threatened from all sides.''
	   John Paul told Arafat that the ``peace process must continue
with the good will of all sides, respecting commitments made and
international law,'' the Vatican said.
	   John Paul has spoken out often on the need for Israel and the
Palestinians to push ahead with peace. The troubled situation has
apparently held up a papal trip to the Holy Land.
	   ``Certainly I will pray for you and your nation,'' John Paul
assured Arafat during a photo-session after the formal talks in the
pope's private library.
	   It was the sixth meeting of the two men. In the past, Arafat has
invited the pope to Bethlehem in 2000, when the Roman Catholic
Church marks the start of Christianity's third millennium. Israel
has also invited John Paul.
	   While John Paul has often expressed his hope of visiting the
Holy Land, no firm date for a visit has ever been set.
	   Arafat is also scheduled to meet with Italian political leaders.
He will travel Saturday to Florence to receive an award from the
Tuscan region.

Taiwan tells Beijing to note U.S. support
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ China should take note of U.S. popular
support for Taiwan if it wants U.S. President Bill Clinton's
upcoming Beijing visit to be a success, government officials said
Friday.
	   ``The American people wish China to give up the threat of force
and start using peace as a frame of reference for discussion of the
issues between the sides,'' said Sheu Ke-sheng, vice chairman of
the cabinet's Mainland Affairs Council.
	   ``China needs to clearly understand U.S. views on Taiwan,'' he
added.
	   Sheu said recent resolutions in the U.S. Congress and remarks by
Clinton highlight the U.S.'s overwhelming determination to see
China and Taiwan resolve their differences peacefully.
	   Respect for those views is crucial to a successful and
constructive summit with Clinton, Sheu said.
	   Sheu was speaking at a weekly news conference.
	   Foreign Ministry spokesman Roy Wu told reporters Taiwanese
officials have publicly appealed to China to resume talks on 114
separate occasions.
	   ``I think this adequately proves our side's desire to resolve
the issues in a peaceful, rational matter,'' Wu said at a weekly
news conference.
	   Clinton begins the first state visit to China by a U.S.
president since Ronald Reagan on June 25. U.S. committments on
Taiwan are expected to be among the issues that China will raise
during talks.
	   Washington cut diplomatic relations with Taiwan in 1979 in order
to recognize China. But the United States retains strong unofficial
ties with Taiwan, and remains its main weapons supplier.
	   Clinton on Thursday said he wished to encourage China and Taiwan
to restart talks broken off by Beijing in 1995. The House of
Representatives on Tuesday passed a non-binding resolution by a
margin of 411 to 0 calling on Clinton to urge China to drop its
threat of force against Taiwan.
	   Though united with the mainland for just four of the last 100
years, Taiwan is still considered by China as a breakaway province
to eventually be reunited with. Beijing broke off negotiations on
investment protection and other issues in anger over Taiwanese
President Lee Teng-hui's June 1995 visit to the United States.
	   China considered Lee's trip the strongest indication yet that he
was seeking formal independence for Taiwan, a contention Taiwan's
Nationalist Party government denies.

WTO chief: countries must cooperate on free trade and environment,
</HEADLINE>
labor policies &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: ADDS description of Friedrich Ebert foundation in 2nd graf. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Freeing-up of trade will continue, despite claims
that it ignores and causes environmental and labor problems, World
Trade Organization chief Renato Ruggiero pledged.
	   But countries must cooperate more to reconcile liberalization
with those concerns, Ruggiero said in a speech to the Hamburg-based
Friedrich Ebert Foundation, a political research body linked to the
German SPD social democratic party.
	   ``We must stop viewing the world through a narrow lens and begin
to look at the various challenges we face as pieces of a larger
puzzle demanding broader, more integrated solutions,'' Ruggiero
said in his speech Thursday, a copy of which was released in Geneva
Friday.
	   In the face of protests that the free trade system ignores and
contributes to poverty, unemployment and environmental problems,
ministers last month told the WTO to prepare for talks to further
open up the world economy.
	   But President Bill Clinton and others pledged to try to make the
organization and the global trade system more open and sensitive to
environmental and labor concerns.
	   Ruggiero said the best way to address the worries is through the
system itself. ``If people, especially young people, say
unemployment is too high, they are right. If environmentalists say
growth must be sustainable - and not destroy the planet's essential
equilibrium - they are right.
	   ``But none of these international - and national - problems will
be resolved any easier by restricting trade, closing borders, or
undermining the international rule of law - as embodied in the
WTO.''
	   Ruggiero said the WTO's success was built on a broadening
international consensus. ``We will only reach durable global
solutions to the environment or labor issues ... by constructing
the same kind of international consensus from the bottom up,'' he
said.
	   The WTO committee on trade and the environment needs ``a new
sense of dynamism,'' Ruggiero said. The process to revitalize the
link between the two issues would begin with a ``thorough
preparatory process,'' he added.
	   Much greater technical and policy coordination is needed at the
national as well as international level. National delegations must
bring a ``coherent and consistent message to the negotiating
table.''
	   ``Trade liberalization must be supportive of environmental
objectives; but environmental policies must also be supportive or
growth and development through trade liberalization,'' Ruggiero
concluded by saying.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Police and troops beat and kicked
protesters when they broke up a rally by about 1,000 East Timorese
at Indonesia's Foreign Ministry on Friday.
	   Security forces moved in after the group staged a five-hour
noisy demonstration, demanding a referendum on independence for the
disputed territory and the release of an imprisoned rebel leader.
	   It was one of the most audacious protests staged by East
Timorese activists in the capital in years, and appears to have
marked the end of a period of tolerance by security forces after
months of protests by a wide range of anti-government groups.
	   Witnesses said several demonstrators were injured when they
refused to leave. Some tried to escape by jumping over a fence. All
were eventually herded onto buses and driven away under police
escort.
	   The Foreign Ministry said two East Timorese women were
hospitalized. A security guard was also treated at a nearby
hospital after being hit by a rock.
	   ``Why do you beat me?'' shouted a woman who was bleeding from
her mouth.
	   ``We are not criminals,'' screamed others.
	   Police confiscated rebel flags and anti-Indonesian banners. They
even made some protesters take off T-shirts printed with
pro-independence slogans.
	   The buses took many of the protesters to spend the night at a
hostel on the city's western outskirts. Officials said they would
be free to leave after that.
	   The protesters arrived at the Foreign Ministry on Friday
morning. Some entered its main building unchallenged and sat in the
lobby.
	   Later their numbers swelled outside. Hundreds waved outlawed
black, gold, red and white rebel flags. The compound gardens were
cluttered with protest banners.
	   Several senior officials met the group. Indonesian Foreign
Minister Ali Alatas was not in the country.
	   ``Referendum yes. Integration no,'' the demonstrators chanted.
	   The demonstration was the latest in a series of rallies and
marches in the capital.
	   Former President Suharto resigned last month after a wave of
protests and riots. Protests have flared again since his successor
B.J. Habibie promised sweeping reforms, but at a moderate pace.
	   Indonesia invaded the former Portuguese colony in 1975 and
annexed it a year later as its 27th province.
	   Since then, separatists have staged a guerrilla war against
Indonesian troops who have been accused of human rights abuses.
	   The spotlight went back on the future of the disputed territory
when Suharto quit. The former autocrat, who ruled Indonesia for 32
years and who ordered the 1975 invasion, had refused to make
concessions toward East Timor despite calls from the international
community.
	   Earlier this week new head of state Habibie said East Timor must
remain an integral part of Indonesia. However, he was willing to
grant special status to the half-island territory in exchange for
peace.
	   Habibie also announced that the government would release a dozen
East Timorese political prisoners. They left a prison in the
troubled territory's capital Dili on Friday.
	   Habibie has said jailed guerrilla commander Xanana Gusmao must
remain behind bars.
	   Separatists regard Gusmao, who is serving a 20-year sentence in
Jakarta's Cipinang Prison, as a freedom fighter. Indonesia has
branded him a violent criminal.
	   ``Our demand is the release of Xanana and a referendum for East
Timor future,'' said Jervasio Sarmento, 22, an East Timorese who
studies at a university on Indonesia's main island of Java.
	   ``No matter if we have to suffer. the important thing is that we
have to determine our own fate.''
	   On Wednesday several thousand East Timorese staged a rally
rejecting Habibie's peace offering and demanded that a referendum
be held on the question of independence.

Crippled during Abacha years, Nigerian opposition keeps fighting

	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Police in riot gear and soldiers armed
with assault rifles took up positions throughout Lagos on Friday in
anticipation of protests against Nigeria's ruling military junta.
	   About 15 kilometers (about 10 miles) west of the city, a crowd
of students from the Lagos State College of Education clashed
briefly with police after pouring out into the streets and setting
tires on fire, witnesses said.
	   There were no immediate reports of arrests in that protest,
which authorities broke up using tear gas.
	   In Lagos, the normally cluttered congestion of morning traffic
had fallen off to a trickle of vehicles as many people stayed home
to avoid a confrontation with either the authorities or opposition
activists who were planning to march on the city.
	   Their strength ravaged by years of government harassment, their
leaders in prison or exile, Nigeria's opposition movement is
defiantly pressing ahead with plans for the pro-democracy protests
_ the first major test of the new military regime of Gen.
Abdulsalam Abubakar.
	   Early in the morning, about 60 youths marched through one Lagos
neighborhood, handing out pro-democracy leaflets and heading toward
a major bus terminal.
	   Some carried a large banner reading ``The Struggle Continues.
The Military Must Go. Abiola For President.''
	   Friday's protests were organized months ago to mark the
five-year anniversary of the annulment of the country's last
presidential elections on June 12, 1993, and to call for freedom
for Moshood Abiola, the imprisoned billionaire businessmen who is
believed to have won that vote.
	   But the demonstrations have taken on added significance, coming
just a few days after Abubakar was appointed leader of this
oil-rich but poverty-stricken West African country following the
heart attack death Monday of dictator Gen. Sani Abacha.
	   ``Certainly these demonstrations will go on,'' said Gani
Fawehinmi, a Lagos attorney leading calls for Nigerians to take to
the streets.
	   Fawehinmi expects few changes from the new leader. Abubakar has
already infuriated the opposition by offering only a vague pledge
to move forward with Abacha's flawed democratic reform program.
	   ``Abubakar is becoming the reincarnation of Abacha,'' he said.
	   The protest calls continued despite official insistence that any
gathering would be illegal _ and none-too-subtle threats of
violence.
	   ``The police are ready for anything that threatens the peace of
this country'' said Young Arebamen, a Lagos police spokesman. He
called the rallies unlawful and warned opposition leaders to call
them off.
	   Police sealed off some roads leading to the Lagos district of
Yaba, where opposition groups had hoped to converge for a mass
demonstration rally.
	   Clusters of police and army troops loitered along street corners
and a key intersections in the city as they waited to see if the
demonstrations went ahead.
	   The authorities in the past have shown no reluctance to use
heavy force, including tear gas and machine gun fire to quell
protests in Nigeria.
	   What remained to be seen was just how much support the
opposition could rally.
	   Abacha's regime hobbled Nigeria's opposition movement with
brutal efficiency, arresting, imprisoning and torturing many
opposition leaders _ or driving them into exile.
	   These days, many demonstrations only attract a few hundred
protesters and strike calls are often completely ignored.
	   Trying to head off trouble ahead of Friday's rallies, the
government closed a Lagos technical college and a university and
shut down all primary and secondary schools in Lagos and Kwara
states, both important regions to the opposition movement.

Woman imitating Titanic film scene plunges to death from ship
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ A Norwegian woman imitating a scene from the
Oscar-winning movie ``Titanic'' lost her grip on a ship's railing
and plunged into the ocean off western Sweden, where she vanished
and is presumed dead, an Oslo newspaper reported Friday.
	   The unidentified woman, who was in her 30s, climbed over the
railing of the ``Queen of Scandinavia'' ferry and hung outside the
ship, which was on an overnight run from Oslo to Copenhagen. She
lost her grip and plunged 20 meters (65 feet) into the ocean off
Varberg, in southern Sweden, at about 2:30 a.m. (0030 GMT)
Thursday.
	   In the film sequence Rose, played by Kate Winslet, hangs over a
railing on the vessel in a suicide attempt until Leonardo Di
Caprio's character Jack persuades her to climb back on board. A
romance blossoms between the two, only to be cut short when the
Titanic hits an iceberg and sinks.
	   The Oslo newspaper Dagbladet, citing witnesses and a friend of
the woman, said she had talked about the ``Titanic'' scene, and
then set out to imitate it.
	   Despite rescue efforts by the ferry, as well as Swedish ships
and helicopters, no trace of the Norwegian woman was immediately
found. Rescuers told the newspaper she was presumed dead.

	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian stock markets ended the week mixed
Friday, but the key index in Seoul tumbled 8.1 percent _ its
biggest ever one-day fall _ on fears that the falling Japanese yen
could wreck the South Korean economy.
	   The U.S. dollar was trading at 144.02 yen in late-afternoon
trading, up 2.34 yen from late Thursday in Tokyo and also above its
late New York rate of 143.79 yen overnight.
	   Earlier in the day, the dollar was quoted at 144.75, its highest
level against the yen since it reached that same mark on August 30,
1990.
	   In Seoul, the key Korea Composite Stock Price Index slumped
26.61 points to 302.09. It was the also index's lowest close since
Jan. 28, 1987, when it stood at 301.56.
	   Thai shares prices fell for a sixth consecutive day as investors
continued to dump shares on worries that the country's economic
crisis is deepening.
	   The Stock Exchange of Thailand index fell 4.55 points, or 1.6
percent, to 279.37 points - its lowest point since Dec. 16, 1987.
	   Meanwhile, the dollar was trading at 43.45 Thai baht, up from
43.12 at the close of trading Thursday.
	   On the Kuala Stock Exchange, the main Composite Index fell 10.63
points, or 2.2 percent, to 472.37.
	   In currency trading, the dollar was quoted at 3.9950 Malaysian
ringgit, up slightly from 3.9875 ringgit late Thursday.
	   In Taiwan, shares closed at another seven-and-a-half month low,
with the Weighted Price Index falling 93.63 points, or 1.3 percent
lower, to 7,117.11.
	   Japan, Asia's troubled economic powerhouse, confirmed Friday
that it has sunk into recession, with two back-to-back quarters of
negative growth.
	   Japan's real gross domestic product for the first quarter this
year fell 1.3 percent from the previous quarter. Last quarter, the
economy shrank 0.2 percent. Japan's gross domestic product for the
entire fiscal year ended March 31, 1998, shrank 0.7 percent, the
first contraction during the entire year since 1974.
	   The yen also tumbled as traders interpreted comments by U.S.
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin as meaning that a coordinated
effort by central banks to boost the falling yen was unlikely.
	   Rubin reiterated in Washington that Japan must revive its ailing
economy, warning that its ``economic difficulties and weak currency
are having substantial adverse impact on the East Asian
countries.''
	   But some Asian markets managed to rebound from earlier losses
despite the economic news from Japan, and overnight falls on Wall
Street.
	   The main stock markets in Tokyo, Hong Kong and Australia
finished the day with slight advances.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average
gained 8.29 points, or 0.06 percent, to close at 15,022.33. On
Thursday, the average closed down 325.22 points, or 2.12 percent.
	   Australian share prices closed higher after the benchmark index
rose than 30 points in the last two and a half hours of trading,
ending an eight-session losing streak.
	   The Sydney's All Ordinaries Index rose 13.00 points, or 0.5
percent, to 2,571.7. The Australian currency was quoted U.S. dlr
0.5895 at the close of stock trading, stronger than its 0.5913
level at the same time on Thursday.
	   Hong Kong share closed higher after three straight sessions of
sharp losess. The Hang Seng Index rose 29.37 points, or 0.37
percent, to 7,915.44.
	   Singapore shares rebounded to close higher, with the Straits
Times Industrial Index rising 4.66 points, or 0.4 percent, to
1,091.49.
	   The Singapore currency hit its lowest level since late January
at 1.756 against the U.S. dollar. But the Singapore currency
recovered slightly to 1.746 by late afternoon.
	   Shares in New Zealand fell for the 12th consecutive session,
falling 11.5 points to 1,997.63.
	   Indonesian share prices closed mixed. The Jakarta Stock
Exchange's Index fell 3.172 points, or 0.7 percent, to 408.372.

World Cup: Organizers say two soccer federations, branch of

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Two national soccer federations and a branch of
FIFA's own marketing company are under investigation for ticket
fraud at the World Cup.
	   Michael Zen-Riffinen, the world soccer federation's acting
general secretary, said Friday that investigations were under way
into the improper sale of World Cup tickets by soccer officials in
Cameroon and an unidentified South American country.
	   The president of the Cameroon soccer federation, Vincent Onana,
was detained as he tried to leave his country with the national
team, FIFA said it was told. Onana was said to have been placed
under investigation this week for embezzlement of public funds,
accused of supplying an English agency with 3,000 tickets worth
dlrs 660,000.
	   Zen-Ruffinen refused to give any details of the South American
case, saying that the federation had not yet been formally advised.
	   In addition, Zen-Ruffian said, FIFA was investigating a case in
which a representative of ISL France, a company with a minority
stake from the ISL marketing giant that handles FIFA's sponsors and
TV contracts, ``apparently sold tickets he did not have to
individuals. It's a rather serious issue.''
	   He said several thousand tickets were involved in the ISL case.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan announced its first year of negative growth
in two decades Friday, confirming it is in severe recession and
deepening fears its woes will accelerate a regional crisis that has
already taken the roar out of Asia's economic tigers. The Economic
Planning Agency said Japan's gross domestic product for the fiscal
year ended March 1998 shrank by 0.7 percent, the first full year of
economic contraction since 1974. Quarterly figures showed the
economy to be where many economists had already feared: in
full-blown recession. The agency said gross domestic product, the
sum of all goods and services produced in Japan, fell by a
steeper-than-expected 1.3 percent in the January-March quarter.
That follows a drop of 0.4 percent _ revised downward Friday from
an earlier estimate of 0.2 percent _ in the previous quarter.
(Japan-Recession)
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Police and troops beat and kicked
protesters when they broke up a rally by about 1,000 East Timorese
at Indonesia's Foreign Ministry on Friday. Security forces moved in
after the group staged a five-hour noisy demonstration, demanding a
referendum on independence for the disputed territory and the
release of an imprisoned rebel leader. It was one of the most
audacious protests staged by East Timorese activists in the capital
in years, and appears to have marked the end of a period of
tolerance by security forces after months of protests by a wide
range of anti-government groups. (Indonesia)
	   ADIGRAT, Ethiopia (AP) _ Ethiopians prepared Friday to bury four
people killed in an Eritrean bomb attack, while another 30 writhed
in pain from shrapnel wounds at a hospital. The Eritrean government
said in a statement it bombed the northeastern border town of
Adigrat because the Ethiopians had turned it into ``the main
garrison for reinforcing the invading Ethiopian army and a center
for army logistics.'' Ground fighting also flared on two fronts
Thursday, as Rwandan and U.S. officials returned to Ethiopia to
promote a peace plan. (Ethiopia-Eritrea)
	   BOMBAY, India (AP) _ For poor villagers in western India, the
disaster of a cyclone that killed at least 727 people was followed
by desperate shortages that forced them Friday on to mud-choked
roads in search of food and drinking water. The death toll Friday
stood at 706 in the hardest-hit state of Gujarat, as workers
continued to find bodies flung on power cables and trees or buried
in sludge left behind by a tidal wave three days after the cyclone
hit land. The cyclone weakened Wednesday as it moved north, leaving
nine more dead in Rajasthan state and 12 more in neighboring
Pakistan. (India-Cyclone)
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Nigeria's opposition movement is defiantly
pressing ahead with plans for pro-democracy protests Friday _ the
first major test of the new military regime of Gen. Abdulsalam
Abubakar. Police in riot gear and soldiers armed with assault
rifles took up positions throughout Lagos in anticipation of
protests against the country's ruling military junta. The normal
flood of morning traffic had tapered off to a trickle of vehicles
as many people stayed home to avoid a confrontation with either the
authorities or opposition activists who were planning to march on
the city. (Nigeria)

India, Pakistan to resume talks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; URGENT &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: ADDS India says Pakistan agrees to resume peace talks &QL; 
 &UR; By HEMA SHUKLA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India says Pakistan has agreed to resume
peace talks on June 22, an encouraging sign after nuclear tests by
both countries increased tensions in the region, a foreign ministry
statement said.
	   External Affairs spokesman K.C. Singh said Pakistan had
responded in the affirmative to India's proposals for the talks.
	   ``India is committed to fostering a relationship of trust and
friendship with Pakistan based on mutual respect and regard for
each others concerns,'' the statement said.
	   Weeks ago, India announced a moratorium on nuclear tests after
explosions last month that shocked the world. Pakistan also said it
was finished testing nuclear devices after conducting its own
series of tests.
	   The nuclear issue was not on the day's agenda released by the
Foreign Ministry, but the two sides were to discuss their dispute
over the territory of Kashmir and their missile arsenals.
	   Last month's tit-for-tat tests raised concerns the long-standing
tension between predominately Hindu India and officially Muslim
Pakistan could result in nuclear war. The two nations have they
have fought three wars in the last 50 years.
	   Pakistan announced a unilateral moratorium Thursday on nuclear
testing, and offered fresh talks aimed at easing tensions with
India, particularly over the Kashmiri border region they both
claim. Both sides have repeatedly offered talks in recent weeks,
but there is little evidence they are making real progress toward a
meeting.
	   Pakistan, in a foreign ministry statement, suggested a no-test
pact with India as a ``confidence-building'' measure. But
``moratoriums are not bilateral,'' said Singh.
	   Despite the conciliatory statement from his ministry, Pakistani
Foreign Minister Gohar Ayub expressed deep distrust of India in an
interview with The Associated Press. Several rightist members of
India's main governing party, the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya
Janata Party, followed up the nuclear tests with warnings to
Pakistan to back down on Kashmir.
	   ``Where there is such a threats from the Hindu fundamentalists
you can expect a nuclear launch and a nuclear escalation'' of a
conflict between the two countries, Ayub said.
	   Kashmir has been the flash point of two of the three
Indo-Pakistani wars, and clashes between the two nations' armies
still regularly break out in the region. The two countries fought a
third war in 1971 that resulted in what was then East Pakistan
breaking away from Pakistan to become independent Bangladesh.
	   The U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan welcomed Pakistan's
unilateral moratorium, saying he would like to see both Pakistan
and India sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.
	   The Indian and Pakistani tests prompted worldwide condemnation.
The international environmental group Greenpeace staged a protest
Friday at India's most recognizable monument, floating an
Earth-shaped hot air balloon draped with anti-nuclear slogans near
the Taj Mahal.
	   Kashmir was split between India and Pakistan after the Asian
subcontinent gained independence from Britain in 1947.
	   Pakistan is demanding that Kashmiris on both sides of the
disputed border be allowed to vote on whether a united Kashmir
should go to Pakistan or India. India has rejected such a vote,
saying its sovereignty is nonnegotiable.
	   Jammu-Kashmir is India's only Muslim-dominated state. India has
accused Pakistan of arming and training Muslim militants there who
have been waging a bloody secessionist battle since 1989.
	   Islamabad says it gives only moral support to Kashmiri
militants.

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 1100 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian stock markets ended the week mixed
Friday, but the key index in Seoul tumbled 8.1 percent _ its
biggest ever one-day fall _ on fears that the falling Japanese yen
could wreck the South Korean economy. The U.S. dollar was trading
at 144.02 yen in late-afternoon trading, up 2.34 yen from late
Thursday in Tokyo and also above its late New York rate of 143.79
yen overnight. Earlier in the day, the dollar was quoted at 144.75,
its highest level against the yen since it reached that same mark
on August 30, 1990. In Seoul, the key Korea Composite Stock Price
Index slumped 26.61 points to 302.09. (Asian Markets)
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Talks between Japan and the United States on
opening Japanese insurance markets to foreign competitors ended
Friday without bridging the differences between the two sides, the
Finance Ministry said. Washington and Tokyo disagree over whether
Japan is living up to commitments to deregulate its life and
non-life insurance sectors under a 1996 pact. Under the deal, the
United States had sought faster deregulation of those sectors, but
to delay liberalization of medical and accident sectors because
foreign companies already have a strong presence there. U.S.
officials question whether Japan has opened the life and non-life
sectors enough. Japan, however, insists that it has. (Japan-US
Insurance Trade)
	   FLINT, Michigan (AP) _ Striking workers who walked out of a
second General Motors Corp. parts plant, threatening to shut down
the automaker's North American production, said they feared losing
their jobs to overseas workers. ``They want to cut our membership
in half over here,'' said Jill Lee, who makes circuit boards at the
Delphi Flint East plant. ``They're taking away our future from our
families.'' The United Auto Workers stepped up its campaign against
the world's largest automaker Thursday night when it struck the
sprawling Delphi Flint East complex, which supplies parts for
nearly every GM vehicle made in the United States, Canada and
Mexico. About 5,800 workers were affected. (US-GM Strike)
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Corporate America should thoroughly review its
policies on sexual harassment in case of a flood of lawsuits
similar to the one settled by Mitsubishi Motors for a record dlrs
34 million, legal experts say. If approved by a federal judge, the
automaker will pay the money to settle charges that it ignored
widespread sexual harassment of female assembly line workers at its
Normal, Illinois plant. The settlement was announced Thursday by
Mitsubishi and the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.
``What this might do is increase the likelihood of multiparty
sexual harassment claims being brought and this settlement being
used as a bargaining tool to bring more companies to the table,''
said Philip M. Berkowitz, a New York City employment law attorney.
(US-Mitsubishi-Harassment)
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ A strike by about 600 Philippine
Airlines pilots entered its second week Friday as government
officials prepared to rule on whether the financially troubled
company can require pilots to retire early. The pilots' union went
on strike last week to protest a new management policy of ordering
pilots to retire who have reached 20 years of service or flown
20,000 hours, regardless of age. The policy puts 225 pilots in
danger of forced retirement, said Capt. Sotico Lloren, president of
the union. PAL, however, said it was not a unilateral management
policy but a provision in a collective bargaining agreement signed
by airline and union officials. (Philippines-Airline Strike)

Gas explosion at nursery injures 34 children and teachers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A propane gas explosion at a nursery school on the
northern Japanese island of Hokkaido on Friday injured at least 32
children and two teachers, police said.
	   The victims were rushed to a nearby hospital. Most of them
suffered only slight burns on their hands and legs, but five of
them, including three children, were hospitalized, Hokkaido
Prefectural Police said.
	   The cause of the blast _ at the private Higashioka Nursery
School in Shibetsu, about 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) northeast of
Tokyo _ was being investigated.
	   The explosion also caused a small fire, while the school
building was badly damaged, local firefighters said.

 &UR; By BARRY SCHWEID &QC;

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on
Friday urged the world's leading industrial nations to deny loans
to India and Pakistan and to refrain from nuclear cooperation with
the two South Asian countries.
	   ``Our meeting sends the message that the world community is
united not just in outrage and dismay but in action,'' Albright
said, referring to nuclear weapons tests conducted last month by
the two countries.
	   By choosing to test, India and Pakistan have diminished their
security and damaged their prestige, Albright said at a meeting
with the foreign ministers of Britain, Germany, Russia, Italy,
Japan, France and Canada.
	   Calling for unity, Albright said relations with India and
Pakistan ``must not drift back into business as usual.'' One way
she proposed was coordinating votes at world financial institutions
to postpone consideration of loans except for those ``that meet
basic human needs.''
	   The South Asian nuclear crisis competed with the ethnic
bloodshed in the Balkans for the attention of the foreign
ministers.

PARIS: ISL case.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   Officials of FIFA and the French World Cup organizing committee
also sought to distance themselves from the growing number of cases
of fans who thought they had purchased tickets only to find
themselves stranded.
	   The officials placed the blame on unscrupulous tour operators,
especially in Japan, who lured fans with glossy ads and knew they
could never deliver the scarce tickets, which are supposed to be
available only through a limited number of licensed channels.
	   ``They found the ideal way of making money, by deceiving
people,'' said Isabelle Delaye, the organizing committee's ticket
chief.
	   Committee managing director Jacques Lambert said operators who
cheated people on tickets and then flew them to France anyway were
``completely lacking in any morals.''
	   He said the organizers would sue anyone found to have sold
tickets illegally, even licensed agents if evidence pointed to
them.
	   Some 12,000 tickets reportedly failed to materialize in Japan,
prompting five Japanese travel agencies to weigh cancelling World
Cup tours.
	   Bruno Travade, a spokesman for the World Cup organizing
committee, said Thursday he could not explain the missing 12,000
Japanese tickets, but that representatives of the only three
licensed ticket agencies for Asia _ JT Travel, Ken R Tours and
Prime Sports International _ picked up their tickets at the
organizers' Paris headquarters between April 27-29.
	   ``We have the receipts, signed by representatives of the tour
operators, that they collected the number and classification of
tickets they had contracted for,'' Travade said.
	   Worldwide, he said, 138,000 tickets had been distributed to 17
licensed agencies. Other brokers who peddled World Cup tickets face
legal action, the spokesman said.
	   Some Japanese fans were already in France, but without tickets
to the matches they'd paid for in their tour packages. Their travel
agencies were said to be scouring the country trying to locate
tickets to the Japanese matches.

Queensland's divisive election unites one group: Asians targeted by
</HEADLINE>
Pauline Hanson &QL; 
 &UR; With BC-Australia-Hanson
 &UR; By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NOOSA HEADS, Australia (AP) _ Pauline Hanson's One Nation Party
has driven a wedge into Queensland's politics and divided the
voters, except for one group _ the Asians who say she has made
racism fashionable.
	   ``The One Nation Party created a crisis mentality among the
Asians, a siege mentality,'' political science professor C.L. Chiou
from Queensland University in Brisbane said Friday.
	   ``My Asian friends are very worried,'' said Chiou, a Taiwanese
immigrant who was educated in California but has lived in
Queensland for 27 years.
	   Hanson, an independent member of Parliament, has called for a
freeze on Asian immigration since her landmark maiden speech in
1996, when she warned Australia was in danger of being ``swamped by
Asians.''
	   She describes Asian neighborhoods as ghettos festering with
crime and corruption, home to Asians who do not want to assimilate
into mainstream Australian society.
	   ``I do not want to go places that I don't understand the
language or street signs,'' Hanson recently said on a radio
interview.
	   In her 1996 speech, Hanson also advocated restoration of the
military draft to raise a standing army to protect Australia from
``invasion'' from the north. She did not need to mention that Asia
is to Australia's north _ no one could miss the point.
	   The undercurrent of fear that One Nation has inspired among
Chinese and other Asian Australians is palpable. While all are
apprehensive about Hanson and her backers, most will not be quoted
by name _ they fear having their names published.
	   ``The policies of Pauline Hanson and One Nation are
anti-Asian,'' said Michael Yau, president of the Chinese Forum, an
umbrella group uniting Queensland Chinese organizations.
	   Explaining the reticence of many Asian Australians to speak out,
he said: ``We Chinese suffer quite a lot; our children are abused
on the school yard and on public transport. We worry about their
safety.''
	   At the Chinese Forum offices, he said, ``We actually get a lot
of feedback, they suffer because of Pauline Hanson and One
Nation.''
	   Many Chinese Australians are professionals or run businesses,
and normally they tend to vote conservative.
	   But since the conservative Liberal Party ruling Queensland has
reached a tactical alliance with One Nation, agreeing to throw its
votes to Hanson's party in districts where the Liberals run in
third place, most Chinese have deserted the conservatives this
time, Chiou said.
	   The Chinese Forum has united with Community Voice, various Hong
Kong associations, several Taiwanese organizations and Chinese
fraternal associations, and ``all have come out against the
coalition government and One Nation,'' he said.
	   There are some 40,000 to 50,000 Asian voters in Queensland,
including about 20,000 to 30,000 Chinese and 10,000 to 15,000
Vietnamese, nearly all of whom will vote for the opposition Labor
Party, he said.
	   With the total number of votes cast in Queensland expected to be
900,000 to 1 million votes, the Asian constituency could be
decisive in some key districts, he said.
	   Beyond Saturday's election, Yau said, if One Nation wins even
one or two seats ``it is scary.'' Opinion polls published Friday
suggested One Nation could win up to eight of the 89 seats in the
state Parliament.
	   Their presence would damages tourism and investment in
Queensland, Yau said.
	   ``We don't want to see any other country look at us as a racist
country,'' he said.

South African arrested for cocaine smuggling
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A South African man arrested at
Bangkok's international airport has been charged with trying to
smuggle cocaine into the country, police said Friday.
	   A man they identified as Mapulei Moriri, 30, was caught Thursday
with 616 grams (21.6 ounces) of cocaine in 46 small packages, said
police, who could not confirm the spelling of his name.
	   Some of the packages were concealed in his luggage and others he
had swallowed and was carrying in his stomach, said the police.
Police said the street value of the drug would be 1.8 million baht
(dlrs 41,860).
	   The suspect had arrived on a flight from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil,
said police, who added that they had been tipped off. They said a
Namibian man named Rafael Mayumbelo, 31, had been arrested at the
airport on May 31 with 670 grams (23.5 ounces) of cocaine and told
them another courier would arrive this week.
	   Police said Moriri told them the drug was destined for dealers
in the Khao Sarn Road area, which is popular among Western
backpackers.
	   The relatively small market in Thailand for cocaine is generally
limited to foreigners and people in the entertainment world.

Albanian militants kill Serb policemen near Kosovo capital
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; BY ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Ethnic Albanian militants, boldly
stepping up their attacks, killed two Serb policemen just a few
miles from Kosovo's capital and on Friday promised to come out of
their shadowy underground and show they are a mass organization.
	   Serb sources in the province said two policemen where killed and
one was seriously wounded overnight in an ambush by Albanian
separatists. A Serb police patrol was attacked near Obilic, just 7
kilometers (4.3 miles) northwest of the provincial capital
Pristina.
	   Ethnic Albanian sources claimed that one Albanian was wounded in
the same incident.
	   According to other unofficial information available in Pristina,
the separatists were believed to be in full control of a road
stretch near Suva Reka, 40 kilometers (25 miles) southwest of
Pristina. Suva Reka is located on the vital north-south road
leading from Pristina to Prizren on the Albanian border.
	   The Albanian sources also said Serb forces attacked villages
belonging to the Obilic and Vucitrn municipalities late last night
and that residents were forced to flee and spend most of the night
under open skies.
	   No further details about the attack were available.
	   The ethnic Albanian daily Bujku reported Friday five ethnic
Albanians and seven Serbs were killed in clashes Thursday in Suvo
Grlo near Srbica, a village in the Drenica area 30 kilometers (20
miles) northwest of Pristina.
	   Bujku said the fighting was fierce, with villagers determined to
``resist to the end with the help of the KLA.''
	   The reports on fighting and casualties could not be
independently confirmed.
	   On Thursday, NATO ministers approved a package they hope will
persuade Milosevic to pull back his Serb-led army and police forces
in the province.
	   Under the measures, NATO will conduct simulated air attacks in
Albania and Macedonia, probably next week, and study options for
further actions ranging from accelerated planning for military
exercises to direct air strikes inside Yugoslavia and use of ground
troops.
	   More than 250 people have died in clashes between government
forces and the Kosovo Liberation Army, the armed wing of the
Albanian independence movement. Ethnic Albanians comprise 90
percent of the province's population.
	   Meanwhile, ethnic Albanian media in Kosovo carried Friday an
announcement by the Kosovo Liberation Army, demanding funds raised
in Western countries be re-routed for its own use.
	   The KLA statement instructed Kosovo's government-in-exile based
in Bonn, Germany, to transfer the monthly three-per cent tax on
wages it collects from Kosovo Albanians living and working abroad
directly to the KLA.
	   The money should be transferred to a special fund in the West,
titled ``Homeland calls,'' said the statement. The reaction of the
government-in-exile was not immediately known.
	   In the announcement, the KLA also said its ``general staff will
in future contact the public through its spokesman.''
	   It identified the spokesman as Jakup Krasnici, a teacher from
Negrovce, a village in the Drenica region, the ethnic Albanian
daily Koha Ditore reported.
	   Krasnici was named to ``avoid misinterpretations and the
(release of) statements in the name of the KLA by irresponsible
individuals,'' the announcement said.
	   It said the KLA will continue fighting for ``freedom and
unification of all Albanians,'' adding the KLA had become a mass
organization spread over the entire territory of Kosovo.
	   Also Friday, the leading ethnic Albanian political party termed
the situation ``explosive,'' alleging Kosovo resembles a ``huge
death camp in which Albanians are being massacred'' and where Serb
forces are using ``scorched earth'' tactics.
	   Spokesman Dzemail Mustafa blamed the Serbian regime for what he
called ``ethnocide'' _ a term coined to describe the alleged
systematic killing of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
	   He said that only the presence of NATO troops could prevent an
escalation of violence and the spreading of the conflict in the
Balkan region.

 &UR; By DINA KRAFT &QC;

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met with the
leader of the opposition Friday amid reports that a unity
government might be under consideration as a way to overcome
right-wing objections to a West Bank withdrawal.
	   A unity government would join Israel's two major parties, Labor
and Likud, in a ruling coalition, greatly weakening the power of
Netanyahu's staunchly conservative coalition allies.
	   Right-wing members of Netanyahu's governing coalition have
repeatedly threatened to bring down his government if he goes ahead
with a much-delayed Israeli troop withdrawal from the West Bank.
The United States is pushing for a 13 percent pullback from the
territory which Israel seized from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast war.
	   The U.S. plan, which not been officially announced although many
its details have been disclosed, is an attempt by the Americans to
re-start the peace process that broke down 15 months ago.
	   In another U.S. effort to move the process forward, CIA Director
George Tenet met separately this week with Netanyahu and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and reportedly passed messages
about security coordination between the two leaders.

World Cup: fans urged to take day off, avoid strike
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Why fight the expected chaos Monday when London's
underground (subway) is on strike?
	   Soccer fans have a better idea: skip work and watch England's
opening World Cup game against Tunisia.
	   ``Let's Have It Off For England,'' the tabloid Sun newspaper
blared Friday in a front-page headline, starting a campaign to make
Monday afteroon an unofficial holiday.
	   In any case, much of the capital is expected to grind to a halt
as employees stop work to watch the game on TV.
	   The 48-hour underground strike _ expected to begin late Sunday _
might be good news for soccer fans, but it's bad news for business
in the capital.
	   The London Chamber of Commerce said the first day of the strike
Monday could cost British business 35 million pounds (dlrs 57
million) in lost revenue and production.
	   And it could get worse if the British teams in the World Cup _
England and Scotland _ play well and the Rail, Maritime and
Transport union call other strikes during the month-long World Cup
in France.
	   ``If the industrial action continues and either of the British
teams progress to the late stages of the World Cup, it could be an
extremely costly summer for business,'' said Simon Sperryn, chief
executive of the London Chamber of Commerce.

Number of mayors suspected of corruption grows in Ukraine
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) - The number of city mayors suspected of
corruption and other offenses appears to be growing rapidly in
Ukraine, according to reports published Friday.
	   In the southeastern town of Zaporizhya, Mayor Olexander Holovko
_ deputy president of the Association of Ukrainian Cities _ is
under investigation for allegedly abusing his authority, the
newspaper Kievskiye Vedomosti reported.
	   Holovko allegedly used municipal money to purchase two cars from
his own father-in-law at inflated prices, the paper quoted Leonid
Kyrylash, an aide to the regional prosecutor, as saying.
	   In addition, Holovko is being investigated for allegedly
transferring 100,000 hryvna (dlrs 50,000) in city money to a
company that then used the funds to purchase shares in a defunct
plant owned by the mayor's wife, the newspaper reported.
	   In the major southern town of Kherson, meanwhile, former mayor
Lyudmyla Kobernyk _ who lost her post last year following demands
from the regional prosecutor's office _ was arrested earlier in the
week, Kievskiye Vedomosti said.
	   It said officials from the prosecutor's office decided to put
Kobernyk behind bars since she had refused to cooperate with
investigators in her case.
	   The reports came a day after Ukrainian media reported the
detention of Olexander Bushko, a prominent businessman and the
mayor of the southern town of Tsiurupynsk, who allegedly maintained
links with organized crime and is suspected of assisting a gang
that specialized in car theft.

Croatian teachers strike, forcing early end to school year
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ The Croatian school year ended a week
early as teachers went on strike Friday, determined to force the
government into granting a 12.5 percent wage increase.
	   The move came after months of fruitless negotiations and a
series of warning protests and walkouts aimed at boosting wages and
winning bonuses for preparational school work done during holidays.
	   ``Our demands are unchanged and the government is simply trying
to buy extra time,'' said Vesna Kanizaj, president of the Union of
Teachers.
	   The government apparently hopes that pressure will die down
during the summer holidays. School is set to resume during the
second week of September.
	   But Kanizaj said the protest would last until the government
caves into teachers' demands.
	   In an effort to downplay the strike, Education Minister Bozidar
Pugelnik called the upheaval a ``circus'' and ended the school year
Friday, a week earlier than scheduled.
	   More than 80 percent of teachers in elementary and high schools
nationwide participated in strikes May 20 and June 4 that paralyzed
the education system.
	   ``The time has come to put an end to the unrealistic union
demands,'' Pugelnik told Zagreb's Radio 101.
	   The early end of the school year left thousands of students in a
dilemma over how to improve their final grades in make-up exams
that usually are given during the last week of classes.
	   The government looks likely to hire substitute teachers.
	   Average monthly teacher salaries are equivalent to dlrs 360 _
below the national average of dlrs 400.
	   The government says it has no money for a wage increase, but
teachers' unions insist education deserves more than 8 percent of
the dlrs 6.4 billion state budget.
	   Discontent is swelling in Croatia as ordinary people struggle to
make do with paltry wages and rising costs, while a new elite grows
richer, its wealth widely rumored to be built on political
connections and corruption.

Violent teacher protests lead to renewed clashes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Riot police used tear gas to disperse
striking teachers from outside schools around the country on
Friday, leaving at least four people injured from the ensuing
clashes, local media reported.
	   The strikers were protesting new examinations introduced for
qualified teachers who wish to be appointed to state-run schools.
They say their university degrees should be the only qualification
necessary.
	   Under the previous system, teachers had to wait for years before
they received a state job.
	   Three police officers were injured and at least 25 people were
arrested in clashes around the country between police and
protesters, police said.
	   A protester also suffered serious injures when he was hit by a
tear gas canister, local media reported.
	   Candidates hoping to take the exams on the first day Friday
needed police escorts to enter schools where the tests were being
held after angry protesters threatened them with physical violence.
	   Hundreds of candidates were eventually turned back by angry
colleagues, media said, adding that about 40 percent of those who
had applied to take the exams were unable to make it to the
designated schools.
	   Despite the lower turnout, the examinations did take place,
although they began later than originally scheduled.
	   Teachers were on the second day of a 48-hour strike to protest
the new examinations.
	   Hurling petrol bombs and rocks, about 80 youths attempted to
block the entrance to a central Athens school by constructing
barricades with garbage cans and a car.
	   Clashes between police and protesters reportedly occurred in
most major Greek cities, including the port cities of Salonica and
Patras.
	   The protests came one day after 13 people were injured in
similar incidents around the country.

	   Ilves was meeting Friday with President Leonid Kuchma, Prime
Minister Valery Pustovoitenko and other officials.
	   According to Ukrainian officials, the sides were to discuss
plans including a summit of Black Sea and Baltic nations scheduled
for 1999.
	   Cooperation between the 11-member Black Sea Economic Council,
which this month formally proclaimed itself a regional economic
organization, and the Baltic Council also was on the agenda.
	   On Saturday, Ilves was due to travel to the southeastern
Ukrainian town of Zaporizhya to take part in the opening of an
Estonian-funded dairy plant, and to meet later in the day with his
Ukrainian counterpart Borys Tarasiuk.
	   Trade turnover between Estonia and Ukraine currently stands at
dlrs 104.4 million a year, and Estonian companies plan to invest
dlrs 300 million in Ukraine, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   Estonia has expressed willingness to take part in completing the
major Yuzhny oil terminal, which Ukraine is building near the Black
Sea port of Odessa, it said.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Pete Sampras suffered a setback in his Wimbledon
preparations Friday when he was beaten in straight sets by
Australia's Mark Woodforde at the Queen's Club grass-court
tournament.
	   The top-seeded Sampras, who had a bye in the first round and
beat Wayne Black in the second round, looked flat as he slumped to
a 6-3, 6-2 defeat on his favorite surface.
	   Sampras had beaten the 66th-ranked Woodforde, known primarily as
a doubles specialist, in all of their previous 10 matches and
dropped only three sets in the process.
	   It was the latest surprising loss for Sampras, who was ousted in
the second round of the French Open by little-known Ramon Delgado.
	   Sampras entered Queens as a tuneup for Wimbledon, a tournament
he has won four times.

Philippine president-elect declares ``revolution'' against
</HEADLINE>
corruption &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ In a message on the centennial of the
Philippines' declaration of independence from Spain,
President-elect Joseph Estrada said Friday his administration will
launch a ``revolution'' against corruption in government.
	   Estrada said the fight would be as tough as the revolution waged
by national hero Andres Bonifacio, who established a secret society
called the Katipunan that fought an armed struggle against Spanish
colonialism.
	   ``It shall be a revolution against graft and corruption and
against those criminals who have been trying to lord it over this
country, so this should be the challenge of my government _ to go
after these grafters in government,'' Estrada said.
	   Curbing corruption, which has been estimated to cost the country
about 20 percent of its national budget, was a campaign promise of
Estrada, a former actor who portrayed underdog heroes.
	   Estrada, who is currently vice president, campaigned on an
anti-poverty platform, promising to narrow the gap between the rich
and the poor.
	   Estrada takes office June 30, when President Fidel Ramos steps
down after six years in office.
	   Revolutionary leader Gen. Emilio Aguinaldo proclaimed
independence on June 12, 1898, from 333 years of Spanish
colonialism.
	   However, later the same year the Philippines was colonized by
the United States, which eventually granted it independence in
1946.

Rights Commission to set up office in Irian Jaya
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ The National Commission on Human
Rights will set up an office in Indonesia's easternmost province of
Irian Jaya, a report said Friday.
	   Clementino dos Reis Amaral, a member of the government-installed
body, said such an office was important because the province was
more prone to rights violations than other Indonesian provinces,
the official Antara news agency said.
	   Therefore, Amaral said the commission had decided to speed up
the opening of the office in spite of the prolonged economic crisis
faced by the country.
	   The crisis has hampered the commission from opening offices in
several provinces, including Aceh, Amaral told a meeting with 500
members of a local rights activists Thursday in the province
capital of Jayapura.
	   Amaral and another Commission member, Asmara Nababan, are
probing allegation by Church leaders that at least 11 villagers
were shot dead and some were missing after a 1996 military
operation to free hostages held by separatists in remote Irian
Jaya.
	   Some churches and houses were also burned down in the villages
of Bella, Alama, and Jila, about 3,452 kilometers (2,157 miles)
northeast of Jakarta.
	   The activists have raised questions about political prisoners in
Irian Jaya and urged the Commission to seek their release as soon
as possible.
	   Indonesia's new President B.J. Habibie has released some
political prisoners, especially those convicted of insulting his
predecessor Suharto, who ruled the country with an iron hand for
three decades.
	   So far, the commission has only a provincial office in Dili, the
capital of the troubled East Timor, a former Portuguese colony
annexed by Indonesia in 1976.
	   East Timor and Irian Jaya, on the western part of New Guinea, as
well as Aceh, on the northern tip of Sumatra, are provinces where
separatists groups are fighting for independence states.

Report: Japan to extend peacekeeping mission in Golan Heights
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan will keep its troops for another six months
in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights as part of its peacekeeping
mission under the U.N. ceasefire between Israel and Syria.
	   The sixth contingent of Japanese peacekeepers, comprising 45
members of the Ground Self-Defense Force, will leave for the Golan
Heights in August, Kyodo News agency reported, quoting unnamed
government officials.
	   The new team will stay there through the end of February after
replacing the current group working at the U.N. Disengagement
Observer Force, Kyodo said.
	   Foreign Ministry officials were not immediately available for
comment.
	   Since February 1996, Japan has taken part in Syria-based UNDOF
mission, rotating the peacekeepers every six months.
	   Japan has also sent members of its Self-Defense Forces to
Cambodia, Mozambique and Zaire under the 1992 law that permitted
Japanese troops to go abroad for the first time since its defeat in
World War II _ but only for peacekeeping missions and never for
combat.

World Cup: Low countries meet again at soccer's highest level
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Bergkamp ruled unfit for match &QL; 
 &UR; By MIKE CORDER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VERSAILLES, France (AP) _ The newest chapter in one of soccer's
oldest rivalries will be written Saturday as neighboring low
countries, the Netherlands and Belgium, clash in their first Group
E match.
	   The Netherlands can take confidence from two easy wins over the
Red Devils in qualifying for this World Cup, but the players are
instead looking to a 4-year-old defeat to sharpen their hunger for
victory at Stade de France in Saint-Denis.
	   In their second match in the 1994 World Cup, the Dutch lost 1-0
to Belgium at Orlando's Citrus Bowl, thanks to a string of fine
saves by inspired goalkeeper Michel Preud'homme.
	   ``There is always a struggle between Belgium and Holland,''
Dutch coach Guus Hiddink said. ``We won twice in the qualification
round, but Holland lost in 1994 in the U.S.A. Now they have players
with a lot of experience. They are a tough and smart team.''
	   The teams meet for the 120th time Saturday. The first ``Low
Countries Derby'' was played in 1905.
	   Dutch winger Marc Overmars predicted a gritty Belgian
performance this time.
	   ``Belgium will not let us play our style. They have good players
so I expect a very tough match,'' he said.
	   Belgium will have to be at its best to contain a strong Dutch
attacking side. However, the Netherlands will be without their star
striker, Dennis Bergkamp.
	   Team officials said Friday that Bergkamp was physically
recovered from a hamstring injury but won't be match fit for
another week. The Arsenal star has scored 33 goals in 57
internationals.

Netanyahu angers U.S. Reform Jews with talk of `fax' conversions
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo &QL; 
 &UR; By VITA BEKKER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu angered a
delegation of American Reform Jews on Friday, rejecting their plea
for equal rights for non-Orthodox Jewish movements and suggesting
they carry out superficial ``fax'' conversions.
	   The delegation of 170 rabbis and other Reform leaders is in
Israel to take part in the country's 50th anniversary celebrations
and to express opposition to a bill that would formally deny
recognition of conversions carried out by the non-Orthodox Reform
and Conservative movements in Israel.
	   Netanyahu is under pressure from religious parties in his
governing coalition to pass the bill.
	   In his meeting with the delegation on Friday, Netanyahu insisted
that he did not consider any Jews ``second-class Jews.''
	   But ``Israel is not America,'' he told the group.
	   Since Israel grants automatic citizenship to all Jews, he said,
accepting any conversions would have dangerous results.
	   ``How do we prevent 4,000 or 4,000 Romanians _ and millions from
other countries _ from declaring themselves Jews?'' he asked.
``Where's the barrier? ... The question we have here is, how do we
prevent fax-conversions?''
	   Rabbi Eric Yoffie, who is leading the delegation, called
Netanyahu's suggestion that the Reform movement gives ``quickie''
conversions ``outrageous.''
	   ``Our conversions are serious and lengthy and intense,'' he told
The Associated Press.
	   The conversion bill, which has already passed its first reading
in the Knesset, Israel's parliament, would institutionalize the
status quo whereby Israel recognizes only conversions carried out
in the country by the Orthodox chief rabbinate, and not those done
by Reform and Conservative rabbis.
	   Although the bill would have no effect on conversions conducted
outside the country, which are recognized in Israel, it has
outraged Jews in the United States and other western countries,
where the Reform and Conservative movements are far larger than in
Israel.
	   The issue has threatened to strain ties between Israel and U.S.
Jewry, which provides significant financial and political support
for the Jewish state.
	   Netanyahu noted that another obstacle to recognizing Reform and
Conservative conversions was the desire of Israel's Orthodox
rabbinical establishment to maintain its monopoly over issues such
as conversions.
	   ``Rabbis like to maintain their power,'' he said.
	   Netanyahu said he would like the Reform and Conservative
movements to drop a lawsuit in Israel's Supreme Court seeking to
win recognition of their conversions. The conversion bill was
introduced in response to that lawsuit.
	   The solution is not through either legislation or litigation,
Netanyahu said, but through ``incremental changes ... ad hoc
understandings that slowly diffuse a problem and allow it to
evolve.''
	   But Yoffie said Reform Jews are impatient after 50 years of
discrimination.
	   ``We are not willing to accept the situation in which our
converts are not recognized,'' Yoffie said. ``We will not stop our
struggle.''
	   Netanyahu scored some points with the delegation by promising to
visit a Reform synagogue in New York, but did not say when.

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ A Bosnian Croat policeman
was killed and his Muslim colleague was injured when a bomb
exploded under their vehicle, local police and U.N. officials said
Friday.
	   The blast occurred Friday morning near the central Bosnian town
of Travnik, and it was not known who was behind it, officials said.
	   Liam McDowall, a U.N. spokesman, said both policemen were in a
private vehicle off duty when the attack happened. He said local
police under U.N. monitoring were investigating the incident.
	   McDowall said there were no more details about the incident, but
other western officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
the attack apparently was a case of personal revenge against one of
the two policemen who recently participated in arresting drug
smugglers.
	   Officials said there were no indications at the moment that the
car bomb was aimed against the joint Muslim-Croat federal police,
which the U.N. is helping to set up despite objections from
hard-liners on both sides.

Scientist warns of dangers posed by Chernobyl sarcophagus
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) - Echoing warnings from other Ukrainian
officials, a nuclear scientist said Friday that a concrete and
steel sarcophagus covering Chernobyl's ruined reactor No. 4 was
deteriorating and the fuel inside could be edging close to a chain
reaction.
	   ``The general negative trends are growing,'' said Olexander
Kliuchnykov, whose Interdepartmental Scientific-Technical Center is
in charge of research at the sarcophagus.
	   The sarcophagus was hastily built after Chernobyl's reactor No.
4 exploded during a test in April 1986, spewing a radioactive cloud
across Europe in the world's worst nuclear power plant disaster.
	   Ukrainian officials long have warned of the sarcophagus'
deteriorating state and leaky walls. They are particularly
concerned about radioactive fuel and tons of radioactive dust
inside.
	   Estimates of the amount of leftover fuel vary wildly, from a few
tons to a few hundred.
	   Kliuchnykov said water infiltration into the sarcophagus and a
gradual softening of the fuel-containing components were
potentially dangerous, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   ``There is a significant decrease regarding the barriers that
have stood in the way of a self-sustained chain reaction,'' he
said.
	   Kliuchnykov said an explosion could potentially be triggered
inside the sarcophagus, releasing radioactive particles that would
pose a danger for plant workers and those in the 30-kilometer
(19-mile) ``dead zone'' around it.
	   But ``a nuclear explosion is ruled out,'' he said.
	   The main danger, he said, was a possible release of an estimated
34 tons (37.4 short tons) of radioactive dust or the contamination
of groundwater by radioactive particles. So far, the groundwater
has remained safe, the scientist said.
	   Last month, Ukraine secured a dlrs 120 million grant from the
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development for repairing the
sarcophagus. But there was no announcement as to when the funds
would be released.
	   The total cost of the required repairs to the sarcophagus is
estimated at dlrs 750 million. Western nations have contributed
dlrs 387.5 million so far.
	   Ukraine has pledged to shut Chernobyl by 2000, but wants dlrs
1.2 billion first to complete two new nuclear reactors.

Former slave laborers from Hungary say they'll sue VW for back pay
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Thirty former slave laborers plan to sue
Volkswagen for back wages after failing to reach a settlement with
the automaker, their German representative said Friday.
	   Klaus von Muenchhausen, a Bremen-based lawyer who is involved in
several similar cases, said the plaintiffs against VW were all
Hungarian Jews now in their 70s.
	   They had been sent from Auschwitz as teen-agers to the VW
factory in Wolfsburg to work in armaments production in 1944-45, he
said.
	   Von Muenchhausen said he decided to take VW to court after
receiving a letter from the company saying the firm had no
intention of making individual wage payments to former slave
laborers.
	   He quoted VW spokesman Klaus Kocks as saying on German
television June 4 that it was impossible to determine what a fair
payment would be, and so VW would instead donate money to east
European countries to fight fascism there.
	   A VW spokesman did not immediately return a call seeking
comment.
	   Some big German industrial firms, including Siemens and
Mercedes-Benz, voluntarily paid reparations to former slave
laborers after the war, but those living behind the Iron Curtain
were unable to apply.
	   Most firms have resisted calls to make new payments to eastern
Europeans, claiming that is the federal government's
responsibility.
	   Bonn has paid more than dlrs 58 billion in reparations to Nazi
victims for such things as health damage and interment in camps.
But it refuses to accept individual wage claims by slave workers,
who were technically working for private companies.
	   A German court last year opened a loophole in the reparations
law to allow East Europeans to apply for imprisonment and health
compensation, even though the deadline expired in 1965.

	   LONDON (AP) _ The world's leading industrial nations, acting on
a U.S. proposal, decided Friday to deny loans to India and Pakistan
in retaliation for their nuclear tests.
	   Loans for humanitarian purposes would be excluded from the
boycott, the foreign ministers meeting to discuss the nuclear

	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright urged the other
nations to refrain from nuclear cooperation with India and
Pakistan.
	   ``Our meeting sends the message that the world community is
united not just in outrage and dismay but in action,'' Albright
said, referring to nuclear weapons tests conducted last month by
the two countries.
	   By choosing to test, India and Pakistan have diminished their
security and damaged their prestige, Albright said at a meeting
with the foreign ministers of Britain, Germany, Russia, Italy,
Japan, France and Canada.
	   Calling for unity, Albright said relations with India and
Pakistan ``must not drift back into business as usual.'' One way
she proposed was coordinating votes at world financial institutions
to postpone consideration of loans except for those ``that meet
basic human needs.''
	   Last week, the World Bank postponed two loans worth more than
dlrs 206 million to India, bringing to more than dlrs 1 billion the
amount delayed because of the South Asian nation's recent nuclear
tests.
	   The crisis competed with ethnic bloodshed in the Balkans for the
attention of the foreign ministers.
	   Their immediate goal, in a communique to India and Pakistan, was
a detailed appeal to freeze their nuclear programs and refrain from
deploying nuclear weapons on missiles.
	   By inviting leading countries from all parts of the world, the
United States and its allies were hoping to amplify the appeal and
discourage others from following the lead of India and Pakistan.
	   In the Balkans, Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic is testing
the will of the international community with his suppression of
ethnic Albanians who account for nearly 90 percent of the
population of the Serbian province of Kosovo.
	   Even as the foreign ministers were gathering, Yugoslav troops
appeared to be readying a major offensive in the Malisevo region.
Tony Lloyd, the European Union's envoy to Kosovo, told the Albanian
leadership that the world would not permit a repetition of the
bloody violence in Bosnia.
	   NATO defense ministers agreed Thursday in Brussels on air
exercises over Albania and Macedonia in the next few days to warn
Yugoslavia against further attacks in Kosovo.
	   ``It is not our desire to use force,'' Albright said in
Washington before flying to London. ``Our desire is to solve this
diplomatically.''
	   On the nuclear front, India and Pakistan said after setting off
nuclear devices last month that they had no plans for more tests.
	   But the foreign ministers want the longtime foes to forswear
future tests and refrain from deploying nuclear weapons or testing
missiles that could deliver the weapons to their targets.
	   Albright and the foreign ministers of Britain, France, China and
Russia met in Geneva, Switzerland, last week and appealed for all
those goals. In London, they were being joined by Germany, Japan,
Canada and Italy.
	   To add moral pressure, foreign ministers from Argentina, Brazil,
South Africa and Ukraine, all of whom have given up the nuclear
option, were joining the others at a luncheon discussion intended
to persuade India and Pakistan to heed world opinion.
	   On hand, too, were ambassadors of the Philippines and China, the
Philippines designated to spread the word to the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations.
	   Heading into the sessions, there was disagreement on economic
sanctions, which the Clinton administration imposed under U.S. law
against the two countries, and no inclination to offer any rewards
to India and Pakistan to agree to a freeze.
	   Japanese Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi was expected to announce
a comprehensive nuclear nonproliferation proposal aimed at
preventing India and Pakistan from further developing their nuclear
arms capability as well as urging the United States and Russia to
speed up their nonproliferation efforts.
	   The allies, too, were divided on Kosovo.
	   Clinton has left open the possibility of military force to end
the violence against ethnic Albanians. Britain and the United
States may ask the U.N. Security Council for authority next week.

McGuire stays on top in Suntory Ladies Open
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KOBE, Japan (AP) _ Marnie McGuire shot a 1-under-par 71 Friday
to stay ahead with a two-stroke lead midway through the 50 million
yen (dlrs 352,000) Suntory Ladies Open.
	   The 29-year-old New Zealander, winner of four tournaments on the
Japan tour, birdied the last three holes in a round of five birdies
and four bogeys for a 5-under 139 total. She had a one-stroke lead
overnight.
	   ``I was putting well but had a poor iron play today,'' said
McGuire, in contention for her first title in Japan since winning
the 1996 Mitsubishi Cup. ``I'll just try to play without the sense
of urgency to win.''
	   Veteran Hiromi Takamura fired the day's best round of 68 and
shared second place at 141 with Keiko Suzuki, who shot a 72.
	   Lee Young-me and her South Korean compatriot Kim Ae-sook shot
71s to share fourth at 142 with Nayoko Yoshikawa and four others.
	   Lee and Kim are seeking their second victory of the season,
while Yoshikawa is aiming at her first title for the season and
30th overall.

Six to stand trial in absentia for UTA DC-10 bombing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Six Libyans, including a brother-in-law of Col.
Moammar Gadhafi, are to be tried in absentia for the 1989 bombing
of a French passenger plane that left 170 people dead, judicial
sources said Friday.
	   The date of the trial is yet to be set, said the sources,
speaking on condition they not be identified by name.
	   It came as no surprise that the trial of the six suspects would
go ahead in the absence of the six defendants. Libya has long made
clear it would not turn over its citizens for trial.
	   Evidence gathered by anti-terrorism Judge Jean-Louis Bruguiere,
who traveled to Libya during his eight-year investigation, pointed
to a plot involving the six to bring down the UTA DC-10.
	   The aircraft, en route from Brazzaville, Republic of Congo, to
Paris, exploded over the Niger desert Sept. 19, 1989, killing all
aboard.
	   Investigators who reconstructed the aircraft in a hangar at
Paris' Le Bourget airport concluded that a suitcase loaded with
explosives blew up in the baggage compartment.
	   Bruguiere completed his investigation in January and asked that
the six be tried in absentia. That request was confirmed Friday by
the court responsible for sending criminal suspects to trial.
	   Gadhafi's brother-in-law, Abdallah Senoussi, is among the six to
face trial. The others are: Abdessalam Shibani, director of
Senoussi's office; Abdallah Elazragh, a diplomat posted in
Brazzaville and suspected of giving the booby-trapped suitcase to a
passenger; Ibrahim Naeli and Mustapha Arbas, suspected Libyan
secret service agents; Abdessalam Hamoude, alleged to have procured
a detonator for the bomb in Germany.
	   The U.N. Security Council banned flights from Libya in 1992
after Ghadafi's regime refused to hand over the suspects in the UTA
attack and in the Pan Am bombing a year earlier that killed 270
people over Lockerbie, Scotland.

Thousands flee Guinea-Bissau as government, rebels face off
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal _ Tens of thousands of people fled the former
Portuguese colony of Guinea-Bissau on Friday as government troops
prepared to face off against renegade soldiers who launched a coup
attempt, according to media reports.
	   As many as 40,000 people in the West African nation were heading
on foot along the road to the northern border with Senegal, a
Portuguese journalist in the area said, citing local reports.
	   Senegal closed the border on Thursday while medical teams were
dispatched to vaccinate the refugees against yellow fever and
meningitis before being allowed into the country, Pedro Rosa Mendes
told Portuguese state radio Antena 1.
	   Government troops, supported by soldiers from Senegal and the
Republic of Guinea, maintained their siege of a military garrison
in the capital Bissau, where an unknown number of rebels have been
holed up since their attempted powergrab on Sunday.
	   The French embassy was hit by a bazooka shell early Friday as
sporadic gunfire broke out after an overnight lull, the Portuguese
news agency, Lusa, reported, citing diplomatic sources in Dakar.
	   Religious and political leaders offered to mediate between the
two sides, Lusa reported.
	   The president of the National Assembly said representatives from
Muslim and Catholic associations had allied with lawmakers to
propose talks, Lusa said.
	   The two sides had ``demonstrated interest'' in holding talks,
Malan Sanha was quoted as saying by Lusa, but he declined to
provide further details.
	   However, an unidentified western diplomat was quoted by Lusa as
saying that President Joao Bernardo Vieira was reluctant to enter
talks and was confident in his ability to defeat the rebels.
	   More than 2,200 people, mostly foreigners, were evacuated from
Bissau on a Portuguese merchant ship Thursday.
	   Vitor Duque, an official of the shipping company that provided
the vessel told, Antena 1 that the passengers, including children
and old people, were packed on the deck. The huge container ship
was designed to hold only 18 people.
	   The ship was due to arrive in Dakar at about 5 p.m. (1700 GMT),
Duque said.
	   Telephone links with Guinea-Bissau were still jammed Friday. The
Portuguese Defense Ministry said satellite links also were not
working.
	   The rebels are led by former armed forces chief Brig. Ansumane
Mane, who was fired in January amid allegations he was involved in
smuggling arms to rebels in Senegal. He has accused Vieira of
corruption and called on him to step down so that early elections
can be held.
	   Vieira himself came to power in a 1980 coup. He was elected in
the country's first democratic elections for president and
parliament four years ago.

	   Officials of FIFA and the French World Cup organizing committee
also sought to distance themselves from the growing number of cases
of fans who thought they had purchased tickets only to find
themselves stranded.
	   The officials placed the blame on unscrupulous tour operators,
especially in Japan, who lured fans with glossy ads and knew they
could never deliver the scarce tickets, which are supposed to be
available only through a limited number of licensed channels.
	   ``They found the ideal way of making money, by deceiving
people,'' said Isabelle Delaye, the organizing committee's ticket
chief.
	   Committee managing director Jacques Lambert said operators who
cheated people on tickets and then flew them to France anyway were
``completely lacking in any morals.''
	   He said the organizers would sue anyone found to have sold
tickets illegally, even licensed agents if evidence pointed to
them.
	   Some 12,000 tickets reportedly failed to materialize in Japan,
prompting five Japanese travel agencies to weigh cancelling World
Cup tours.
	   Bruno Travade, a spokesman for the World Cup organizing
committee, said Thursday he could not explain the missing 12,000
Japanese tickets, but that representatives of the only three
licensed ticket agencies for Asia _ JT Travel, Ken R Tours and
Prime Sports International _ picked up their tickets at the
organizers' Paris headquarters between April 27-29.
	   ``We have the receipts, signed by representatives of the tour
operators, that they collected the number and classification of
tickets they had contracted for,'' Travade said.
	   Worldwide, he said, 138,000 tickets had been distributed to 17
licensed agencies. Other brokers who peddled World Cup tickets face
legal action, the spokesman said.
	   Some Japanese fans were already in France, but without tickets
to the matches they'd paid for in their tour packages. Their travel
agencies were said to be scouring the country trying to locate
tickets to the Japanese matches.

Turkish army steps up pressure on Islamic politics
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey's powerful pro-secular army is
preparing to increase its pressure on the government to step up the
fight against Islamic politics, newspapers said Friday.
	   The country's top generals have scheduled an emergency meeting
on Tuesday shortly before they meet with leading government
officials in a National Security Council, the Turkish Daily News
said.
	   The generals will evaluate the government's progress in its
fight against radical Islam, it said.
	   The generals are unhappy because they feel the government is
moving too slowly. A so-called ``fundamentalism'' law, for example,
has been delayed by the failure of cabinet ministers to attend
parliamentary committee hearings.
	   The military-backed bill would tighten control over Islamic
attire and education and provide heavier punishments for civil
servants involved in pro-Islamic activities.
	   Turkey, overwhelmingly Muslim, has had a secular system for the
last 75 years. It was governed by its first Islamic-led government
until June last year, when the military forced it to resign.

	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ A Bosnian Croat policeman
was killed and his Muslim colleague was injured when a bomb
exploded under their vehicle, local police and U.N. officials said
Friday.
	   The blast occurred Friday morning near the central Bosnian town
of Travnik, and it was not known who was behind it, officials said.
	   Liam McDowall, a U.N. spokesman, said both policemen were in a
private vehicle off duty when the attack happened. He said local
police under U.N. monitoring were investigating the incident.
	   McDowall said there were no more details about the incident, but
other western officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
the attack apparently was a case of personal revenge against one of
the two policemen who recently participated in arresting drug
smugglers.
	   Officials said there were no indications at the moment that the
car bomb was aimed against the joint Muslim-Croat federal police,
which the U.N. is helping to set up despite objections from
hard-liners on both sides.

Vietnam border experts to go to Cambodia for talks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Vietnamese officials are to go to Phnom
Penh for talks with their Cambodian counterparts to resolve land
and maritime border problems, a Cambodian diplomat said Friday.
	   Cambodian ambassador to Vietnam Nuon Sareth said at a news
conference that a four-day meeting will start June 17.
	   It comes on the heels of Cambodian First Prime Minister Ung
Huot's recent visit during which he and Vietnamese Prime Minister
Phan Van Khai agreed that their border disputes should be resolved
before 2000.
	   Vietnam and Cambodia held a first round of border talks in May
1996 which covered only the land border problem. The two countries
share more than 1,000 kilometers (600 miles) of border.
	   A second round which was originally scheduled for last year was
canceled because of the coup d'etat in Cambodia last July.
	   The ambassador said Cambodia expressed its dissatisfaction over
the signing of a maritime border delineation agreement last year
between Vietnam and Thailand without Cambodian participation, but
he did not comment whether Cambodia would honor the pact.
	   He said Khai told Ung Huot that the agreement with Thailand did
not relate to overlapping areas with Cambodia and that all three
countries can negotiate over any overlapping areas. Some disputed
areas are believed to contain valuable oil and gas resources.
	   Nuon Sareth said joint development and production sharing of
such resources would be one way to deal with disputed areas.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Call him Sir Geoff.
	   Geoff Hurst, whose three goals earned England the 1966 World Cup
in the final against West Germany, receives a knightood Saturday
from Queen Elizabeth II.
	   The honor for the former West Ham star comes on the eve of
Monday's World Cup opener for England against Tunisia, 32 years
after Hurst brought England its one and only World Cup trophy.
	   Hurst is the only player to have scored a hat trick in the
championship game of the World Cup, although some believe that one
of his three goals in the 4-2 victory didn't cross the goal line.
	   Hurst is just one of many British sports figures on the queen's
Honors List.
	   Michael Bonallack, secretary of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club
of St. Andrews, also receives a knighthood.
	   The Order of the British Empire (OBE) goes to 1992 Olympic
hurdles champion Sally Gunnell, former Olympic and world 100-meter
champion Linford Christie, and Ian Peacock, chief executive of the
Lawn Tennis Association.
	   Among those receiving the Member of the British Empire (MBE) are
WBC heavyweight boxing champion Lennox Lewis, England cricket
captain Alec Stewart, former England soccer star John Barnes,
Scottish golfer Colin Montgomerie, golfer Alison Nicholas and
middle-distance runner Kelly Holmes

World Cup: fans urged to take day off, avoid strike
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS British prime minister's plans in 5-6th grafs &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Why fight the expected chaos Monday when London's
underground (subway) is on strike?
	   Soccer fans have a better idea: skip work and watch England's
opening World Cup game against Tunisia.
	   ``Let's Have It Off For England,'' the tabloid Sun newspaper
blared Friday in a front-page headline, starting a campaign to make
Monday afternoon an unofficial holiday.
	   In any case, much of the capital is expected to grind to a halt
as employees stop work to watch the game on TV.
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair will apparently miss the big
game to attend a European Union meeting in Cardiff, Wales.
	   A spokesman said Blair had no plans to sneak in a small
television set to watch the game, which Italian Prime Minister
Romano Prodi did two years ago at a meeting during the European
championship.
	   The 48-hour underground strike _ expected to begin late Sunday _
might be good news for soccer fans, but it's bad news for business
in the capital.
	   The London Chamber of Commerce said the first day of the strike
Monday could cost British business 35 million pounds (dlrs 57
million) in lost revenue and production.
	   And it could get worse if the British teams in the World Cup _
England and Scotland _ play well and the Rail, Maritime and
Transport union call other strikes during the month-long World Cup
in France.
	   ``If the industrial action continues and either of the British
teams progress to the late stages of the World Cup, it could be an
extremely costly summer for business,'' said Simon Sperryn, chief
executive of the London Chamber of Commerce.

Japan to punish brokerages for improper trades
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's Ministry of Finance said Friday it is
punishing the Tokyo branches of ING Barings Securities Ltd., HSBC
Securities Japan Ltd. and Sumitomo Capital Securities Co. for
improper securities transactions.
	   The Tokyo branch of ING Barings will be banned from proprietary
equity trading June 22 and June 23, and will be banned from
proprietary trading of convertible bonds and equity warrants June
22 to June 28.
	   On May 26 the Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission
recommended ING Barings be punished for failing to make proper
reports on short selling of securities.
	   The Tokyo branch of HSBC Securities will be banned from
proprietary equity trading and foreign equity trading for customers
on June 22. It will be banned from trading Japanese stocks for
customers from June 22 to July 1.
	   The SESC accused HSBC Securities of submitting false statements,
saying the brokerage told customers that securities trades had been
completed when they weren't, and reported incorrect execution
prices.
	   The Osaka branch of Sumitomo Capital Securities will be banned
from underwriting securities and related activities from June 22 to
June 28 after the commission said the company improperly visited
customers with employees of its parent company, Sumitomo Bank.
	   When Japan allowed banks to set up securities units a few years
ago, it set up ``fire walls'' that prohibited such actions.
	   The ministry also said that the ban on Sumitomo Capital from
underwriting new Japanese government bonds, which was implemented
on May 22, will continue until June 28.
	   In a statement, ING Barings said the SESC inspection resulted
from matters brought to the attention of the Tokyo Stock Exchange
and Finance Ministry by ING Barings itself, and that it fully
cooperated with the authorities.

UNHCR and NATO set up Sarajevo-Tirana humanitarian airlift
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ The leading U.N. aid agency
and NATO are setting up a humanitarian airlift from the Bosnian
capital to Tirana, Albania to assist thousands of ethnic Albanian
refugees from Kosovo, officials said Friday.
	   The first flight of a Norwegian military transport C-130
Hercules airplane is scheduled for Saturday 10:00 a.m. (0800GMT),
said Ariane Quntier, a spokeswoman for the U.N. High Commissioner
for Refugees, or UNHCR, in Sarajevo.
	   The plan thrilled many in Sarajevo. The city itself survived the
1992-95 Bosnian Serb siege thanks to a UNHCR airlift, which was the
longest in history.
	   Quntier said Sarajevo was picked as the regional UNHCR
headquarters with most of the aid on stock that is not needed
locally any more.
	   ``This will in no way affect our operation in
Bosnia-Herzegovina,'' she told The Associated Press.
	   Only one Norwegian NATO plane will be involved in the airlift
initially planed to last four days _ until next Tuesday.
	   The plane was expected to make two runs to Tirana on the first
day, while in the next three days it would be flying up to three
times daily.
	   Each flight will take some 18 tons of non-food items like tents,
blankets and other sheltering material for an estimated 12,000
refugees who fled fighting in Kosovo and are living in ``very bad
conditions'' in northern Albania, Quntier said.
	   Due to the bad roads in Albania, the aid likely will be going to
be transported by several American NATO helicopters from Tirana to
the north of the country, where the refugees are settled.

	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Nigeria's ruling military put its might on
display Friday, with soldiers pouring into the city and riot police
positioned at key intersections ready to quash any protests by
opposition activists.
	   Troops packed into transport trucks fired their rifles into the
air as their convoy rumbled through one district of town, prompting
residents to scamper to safety.
	   About 15 kilometers (about 10 miles) west of Lagos, a crowd of
students from the Lagos State College of Education clashed briefly
with police after running into the streets and setting tires on
fire, witnesses said.
	   There were no immediate reports of arrests in that protest,
which authorities broke up using tear gas.
	   Lagos Police Commissioner Abubakar Tsav said in a published
statement that protesters ``will be seriously dealt with.''

Chief Muslim cleric: Homes in Jerusalem should not be left empty
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SAMAR ASSAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The chief Muslim cleric in Jerusalem urged
Palestinians on Friday to move into empty homes in the city to
protect them from being taken over by Jews.
	   ``Either you live in them or rent them to institutions that will
protect them from being taken over by extremists,'' Mufti Ikrema
Sabri said in his weekly sermon at Jerusalem's Al Aqsa Mosque.
``Leaving them empty will put them in danger.''
	   On Thursday night, the Palestinian Cabinet issued a statement
urging Palestinian residents of Jerusalem's Old City to take action
against efforts by Jewish settlers to take over buildings there.
	   ``The Palestinians cannot remain inactive in the face of the
activities of the right wing in the Old City,'' the statement said.
	   In recent weeks, Jewish settler groups have accelerated their
campaign to move Jews into Arab neighborhoods of east Jerusalem,
which the Palestinians claim as a future capital.
	   Sabri warned that Palestinians who sell their homes to Jews will
be considered traitors, and urged Muslims to treat them as social
outcasts and ``have no dealings with them.''
	   According to an old religious ruling, Muslims who sell property,
land or homes to non-believers cannot be buried in a Muslim
cemetery, Sabri said.
	   Five Arab apartments in the Arab neighborhood Silwan were taken
over by Jewish settlers this week, and a Jewish seminary won
approval to build 58 housing units on the Mount of Olives, on land
originally set aside for an Arab girls' school.
	   ``Some believe that the battle for Jerusalem has just begun or
will begin this year,'' Sabri said. ``For us it has begun since the
occupation of Jerusalem in 1967.''
	   Israel captured east Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast War and later
annexed it. The status of the city is supposed to be determined in
negotiations on a final peace settlement, but Israel says it will
never allow the city to be re-divided.
	   Palestinians say that the settlers' activities are pre-empting
the negotiations on the city's future.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu angered a
delegation of American Reform Jews on Friday, rejecting their plea
for equal rights for non-Orthodox Jewish movements and suggesting
they carry out superficial ``fax'' conversions.
	   The delegation of 170 rabbis and other Reform leaders is in
Israel to take part in the country's 50th anniversary celebrations
and to express opposition to a bill that would formally deny
recognition of conversions carried out by the non-Orthodox Reform
and Conservative movements in Israel.
	   Netanyahu is under pressure from religious parties in his
governing coalition to pass the bill.
	   In his meeting with the delegation on Friday, Netanyahu insisted
that he did not consider any Jews ``second-class Jews.''
	   But ``Israel is not America,'' he told the group.
	   Since Israel grants automatic citizenship to all Jews, he said,
accepting any conversions would have dangerous results.
	   ``How do we prevent 4,000 or 5,000 Romanians _ and millions from
other countries _ from declaring themselves Jews?'' he asked.
``Where's the barrier? ... The question we have here is, how do we
prevent fax-conversions?''

Israel to take part in the country's 50th anniversary celebrations

	   ``How do we prevent 4,000 or 5,000 Romanians _ and millions from
other countries _ from declaring themselves Jews?'' he asked.
``Where's the barrier?''
	   Rabbi Eric Yoffie, who is leading the delegation, called
Netanyahu's suggestion that the Reform movement gives ``quickie''
conversions ``outrageous.''
	   ``Our conversions are serious and lengthy and intense,'' he told
The Associated Press.
	   The conversion bill, which has already passed its first reading
in the Knesset, Israel's parliament, would institutionalize the
status quo whereby Israel recognizes only conversions carried out
in the country by the Orthodox chief rabbinate.
	   Although the bill would have no effect on conversions conducted
outside the country, which are recognized in Israel, it has
outraged Jews in the United States and other western countries,
where the Reform and Conservative movements are far larger than in
Israel.

 &UR; Eds: RECASTS, UPDATES with Russian soldiers kidnapped, explosion in
Dagestan cemetery, two more villagers abducted in North Ossetia,
protest against kidnappings in Ingushetia. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Ten Russian soldiers were kidnapped and a powerful
time-bomb exploded in a Muslim cemetery in the Caucasus republic of
Dagestan on Friday, wounding one person, Russian news agencies
reported.
	   The soldiers were seized on Thursday night in a suburb of the
Dagestani capital Makhachkala and their bus was taken in the
direction of neighboring Chechnya, the ITAR-Tass news agency said,
citing the local Interior Ministry.
	   No other details of the abduction were available.
	   The bomb Friday was set at the grave of the father of a top
Dagestani official, the Interfax news agency said.
	   Said Amirov, the mayor of Makhachkala, was not at his father's
grave when the explosion occurred _ even though it went off in the
afternoon hours when people often visit their recently deceased
family members' graves. Amirov has been visiting the grave daily
since his father died last week, Interfax said.
	   In other unrest in the Caucasus region on Friday, two villagers
in North Ossetia were kidnapped, Interfax said. Local police said
that the two had been brought across the republic border into
Ingushetia.
	   The two neighboring republics have been battling through a wave
of kidnappings. Earlier this week, North Ossetian villagers
detained five Ingush bus passengers in apparent retaliation for the
kidnapping of seven of their neighbors the day before.
	   In Nazran, the Ingush capital, thousands of residents took part
in a rally demanding the release of the Ingush hostages, ITAR-Tass
said.
	   North Ossetia, which is predominantly Orthodox Christian, and
Muslim Ingushetia fought a short but bloody war in 1992. Hundreds
of people were killed and most ethnic Ingush were expelled from
North Ossetia.
	   Tensions have continued to simmer. A police checkpoint in North
Ossetia was attacked with grenades and gunfire on Thursday night
but no one was hurt, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   The attack on the mobile police post near the mountain village
of Chmi was the second to target a North Ossetian police station in
two days, ITAR-Tass said. On Wednesday night, automatic rifle-fire
and grenades hit another police post set up near a quarry.
	   Citing local police sources, ITAR-Tass said that ``all traces''
of both attacks led to Ingushetia.

	   DOLGENBRODT, Germany (AP) _ When a house for refugees in this
lakeside resort burned to the ground the day before 86 Africans
were to move in, authorities quickly caught and convicted a
teen-age neo-Nazi.
	   Then the arsonist started talking, and prosecutors uncovered a
conspiracy involving not only disaffected youths but otherwise
upstanding citizens who wanted to keep the asylum seekers out.
	   The case, combined with recent electoral successes for a
far-right party, raised new questions about the breadth of
anti-foreigner sentiment in Germany, especially in the formerly
closed and communist east.
	   Five men allegedly involved in the plot went on trial Friday in
Brandenburg state court in Frankfurt an der Oder, four charged with
complicity in the Nov. 1, 1992 crime and the fifth with being an
accessory.
	   Shortly after the start, however, it was recessed until Tuesday
on a defense motion.
	   While the five men and two others awaiting trial on perjury
charges are the only ones charged, prosecutor Petra Marx says she
believes most of Dolgenbrodt's 300 residents share the blame.
	   ``They might not have been actively involved,'' she said in an
interview Thursday. ``But the atmosphere in the village was not the
best at that time, everyone admits.

Former world champion cyclist in German elections as former

<TEXT>
	   LEIPZIG, Germany (AP) _ Two-time world champion cyclist
Gustav-Adolf Schur of former East Germany is running in German
elections this fall for the former communists, the party said
Friday.
	   The 67-year-old Schur, who won the world championship in 1958
and 1959, is running as a candidate in Leipzig's 310th election
district for the Party of Democratic Socialism, the successors to
the East German communists. The seat is currently held by
conservative Christian Democrat Gerhard Schulz.
	   Schur plans to conduct his campaign by riding a red tandem
bicycle through Leipzig with another PDS candidate, Barbara Hoell,
to talk to potential voters. Hoell is seeking re-election in
another Leipzig district where she won a direct mandate in 1994.
	   With the help of the popular Schur, nicknamed ``Tave'' by his
fans, the PDS hopes to get 25 percent of the city's vote, party
chairman Dietmar Pellmann said.
	   Leipzig has 3,100 PDS members, the most of any German city.
	   Federal elections are on Sept. 27.

World Cup: Bomb threat forces evacuation of stadium press box
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MONTPELLIER, France (AP) _ World Cup organizers received two
bomb threats before Friday's match between Bulgaria and Paraguay at
a stadium here, but dismissed them as ``not serious.''
	   Eric Champel, a member of the organizing committee, said the two
threatening phone calls were received about 2 1/2 hrs before the
match was scheduled to start.
	   ``We briefly evacuated the press stands and brought in the
sniffing dogs, but that's our usual procedure before every game at
the World Cup,'' he said, adding that there was no concern for the
security at the match.
	   Most of the evacuated reporters found out about the threats only
after the all-clear had been given.

Banks strike to support protests against Ionian's sale
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ State bank employees began a nation-wide
24-hour strike Friday to protest the government's plans to
privatize the country's fourth largest bank.
	   But opposition to the controversial sale appears to be petering
out.
	   Several Ionian Bank branches have opened after a month-long
walkout by its employees was ruled illegal three times by Greek
courts.
	   On all three occasions, workers claimed they would not be
violating the court orders by failing to return to work if they
were covered by strikes called by umbrella trade unions.
	   Ionian's management has filed a fourth law suit, asking for a
fresh ban on the strike.
	   Although workers appear to have accepted that the sale will go
through, they are now negotiating the terms of the privatization in
order to maintain their jobs and long-standing social security
benefits.
	   Ionian's sale is critical for the success of the government's
privatization program and its effort to restructure the banking
sector ahead of Greece's targeted participation in the European
economic and monetary union by 2001.

Thai auction of art work from failed finance firms begins
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ About 1,000 people showed up Friday to
witness the first day of an auction of more then 400 paintings and
other pieces of art seized from 56 failed Thai finance companies.
	   The items were seized by the Financial Restructuring Authority,
a government agency set up to liquidate the assets of insolvent
firms shut down by the government last year.
	   The closings were required by the International Monetary Fund as
part of its dlrs 17.2 billion bailout program for the troubled Thai
economy. The proceeds from the auction will go to pay the debts of
the failed companies.
	   The seized items, which are being auctioned at Bangkok's Queen
Sirikit National Convention Center, are expected to generate about
30 million baht (dlrs 697,700), according to Amaret Sila-on, the
chairman of the Restructuring Authority.
	   While the auction serves as testimony of how Thailand fell from
grace, others believe the event is a blessing in disguise.
	   ``I think it is great because collectors can buy. Good paintings
sometimes go into a company collection and never get back out
again,'' said Philip Ng, managing director of Christie's Asia
region, the British auction house handling the event.
	   ``A lot of (finance) companies got into trouble for various
reasons. It is sad for that reason but it is not sad if good
pictures come out to be sold through auctions,'' he said.
	   Suthikiat Chirathivat, vice chairman of the Central Group, a
leading Thai hotel and retail group, said he is looking for
bargains to put in his hotels.
	   ``It's part of our expansion,'' said Suthikiat. ``Our hotels
have been doing well as more Thais tourists are travelling
domestically instead of going abroad.''

Albanian militants kill Serb policemen near Kosovo capital
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; BY ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Ethnic Albanian militants, boldly
stepping up their attacks against Serb authorities, have killed two
Serb police officers just a few miles (kilometers) from Kosovo's
capital.
	   Serb sources in the province said two police officers where
killed and one was seriously wounded late Thursday in an ambush by
Albanian separatists. A Serb police patrol was attacked near
Obilic, just seven kilometers (four miles) northwest of the
provincial capital Pristina.
	   Ethnic Albanian sources claimed that one Albanian was wounded in
the same incident.
	   Ethnic Albanians, who make up 90 percent of Kosovo's population,
are fighting to gain independence from Serbia, one of the two
republics in the Yugoslav federation.
	   According to other unofficial information available in Pristina,
the separatists were believed to be in control of a road near Suva
Reka, 40 kilometers (25 miles) southwest of Pristina. Suva Reka is
located on the vital north-south road leading from Pristina to
Prizren on the Albanian border.
	   The Albanian sources also said Serb forces attacked villages
belonging to the Obilic and Vucitrn municipalities late Thursday
and residents were forced to flee.
	   No further details about the attack were available.
	   The ethnic Albanian daily Bujku reported Friday that five ethnic
Albanians and seven Serbs were killed in clashes Thursday in Suvo
Grlo near Srbica, a village in the Drenica area 30 kilometers (20
miles) northwest of Pristina.
	   Bujku reported that the fighting was fierce.
	   The reports on fighting and casualties could not be
independently confirmed.
	   On Thursday, NATO ministers approved a package they hope will
persuade Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to pull back his
Serb-led army and police forces in the province.
	   Under the measures, NATO will conduct simulated air attacks in
Albania and Macedonia, probably next week, and study options for
further actions ranging from accelerated planning for military
exercises to direct air strikes inside Yugoslavia and use of ground
troops.
	   More than 250 people have died in clashes between government
forces and the Kosovo Liberation Army, the armed wing of the
Albanian independence movement.
	   Meanwhile, ethnic Albanian media in Kosovo carried Friday an
announcement by the KLA, demanding funds raised in Western
countries be re-routed for its own use.
	   The KLA statement instructed Kosovo's government-in-exile based
in Bonn, Germany, to transfer the monthly 3 percent tax on wages it
collects from Kosovo Albanians living and working abroad directly
to the KLA.

Corrpution agency arrest 30 people for fixing soccer matches

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Thirty people, including six Hong Kong soccer
players and a police officer, have been arrested for allegedly
fixing soccer matches, the territory's chief anti-corruption agency
reported Friday.
	   The Independent Commission against Corruption said the arrests
following raids Wednesday on three gambling establishments operated
by a syndicate.
	   A statement said Singapore authorities have also arrested 14
people, including the main operator of an extensive betting ring,
which had links with the Hong Kong sydnicate.
	   It said the Hong Kong suspects were alleged to have accepted
bribes to fix matches in the territory during the 1996-1998 soccer
seasons.
	   A computer used for logging bets was also seized, the statement
said.
	   A number of preliminary qualifying matches played by the Hong
Kong national team for the 1998 World Cup were also suspected to
have been involved in the match fixing scandal, the Commision said.
	   Hong Kong was eliminated in the early stages of the qualifying
round for the World Cup that is currently taking place in Paris.
	   It said the Hong Kong soccer association is providing full
cooperation to the Commission in its investigation.

U.S. defense secretary to visit Poland next week
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen makes
his first trip to Warsaw on Monday to discuss assistance that
America and NATO can offer Poland on its path to integrate with the
military alliance.
	   During a two-day visit, Cohen is to meet with President
Aleksander Kwasniewski, Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek and Defense
Minister Janusz Onyszkiewicz.
	   Following a NATO defense ministers' meeting in Brussels on
Thursday, Cohen said he hopes to discuss ways of assisting Polish
authorities in reforms necessary for the country to meet NATO
standards, including reducing the size of the Polish army.
	   Poland has been invited along with Hungary and the Czech
Republic to join NATO next April, and Cohen said he was satisfied
with the three nations' progress so far.
	   Cohen comes at a time when the president and the Cabinet are
competing for control over the army, after the new constitution
last year abolished the National Defense Committee.
	   The government, responsible for the defense policy, wants to
take over the committee's power to decide the army's shape and on
state defense policy. The president, who is the army's supreme
commander, objects and says it would limit his powers.
	   Onyszkiewicz says the government should decide on the defense
policy since it is in charge of spending public money and is
accountable before the parliament. He agrees the president should
be consulted.
	   A government draft bill should be ready in June.

Chief Muslim cleric: Homes in Jerusalem should not be left empty
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The chief Muslim cleric in Jerusalem urged
Palestinians on Friday to move into empty homes in the city to
protect them from being taken over by Jews.
	   ``Either you live in them or rent them to institutions that will
protect them from being taken over by extremists,'' Mufti Ikrema
Sabri said in his weekly sermon at Jerusalem's Al Aqsa Mosque.
``Leaving them empty will put them in danger.''
	   On Thursday night, the Palestinian Cabinet issued a statement
urging Palestinian residents of Jerusalem's Old City to take action
against efforts by Jewish settlers to take over buildings there.
	   ``The Palestinians cannot remain inactive in the face of the
activities of the right wing in the Old City,'' the statement said.
	   In recent weeks, Jewish settler groups have accelerated their
campaign to move Jews into Arab neighborhoods of east Jerusalem,
which the Palestinians claim as a future capital.
	   Sabri warned that Palestinians who sell their homes to Jews will
be considered traitors, and urged Muslims to treat them as social
outcasts and ``have no dealings with them.''
	   According to an old religious ruling, Muslims who sell property,
land or homes to nonbelievers cannot be buried in a Muslim
cemetery, Sabri said.
	   Five Arab apartments in the Arab neighborhood Silwan were taken
over by Jewish settlers this week, and a Jewish seminary won
approval to build 58 housing units on the Mount of Olives, on land
originally set aside for an Arab girls' school.

Lords hones in on technology
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Lord's will set a cricket precedent by installing
cameras dedicated to assisting the third umpires make close run-out
decisions, starting with the second Test between England and South
Africa next Thursday.
	   The home of cricket will be the first cricket venue in Britain
to install broadcast quality cameras designed to give the third
umpire an unprecedented view of the crease when calling close
decisions.
	   The cameras will be trialed early next week and are expected to
be ready for the second England-South Africa Test.
	   The third umpire, the off-field adjudicator developed for
limited overs cricket, currently uses television replays to decide
on close run-out decisions.
	   But officials at Lords have decided to reduce the element of
doubt from decisions by instaling the cameras in line with each
crease.
	   The project was funded by the MCC and the English Cricket Board.
It was based on a similar system used at test venues in South
Africa.
	   The cameras will mean third umpires can now be used at Lord's
matches not covered by television networks.

Cuban bishops say they expert religious gains to stay
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By FRANCES D'EMILIO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ Cuba's bishops said Friday they expected to
hold on to religious freedoms gained thanks to Pope John Paul II's
visit but declined to predict if political opening would follow.
	   The 13 Roman Catholic bishops from the Communist-run island
capped a week of meetings with the pope and other top Vatican
officials to review the consequences of the pontiff's landmark
visit Jan. 21-25.
	   ``It's not our task to make predictions about Cuba's political
future, and it's also difficult for political analysts,'' said
Havana's archbishop, Cardinal Jaime Lucas Ortega told a news
conference.
	   But, the cardinal added, the Catholic church was determined to
``reinforce our role and work for our people.''
	   Much of the church's new gains have come in the field of social
services. For example, on the parish level, the church can now
carry out such services as helping single mothers, alcoholics and
the disabled.
	   In the weeks before the pope came, the government of Fidel
Castro declared Christmas an official holiday for the first time in
nearly three decades.
	   Santiago's archbishop, Pedro Meurice Estiu, chatting with some
reporters after the news conference, said there was no doubt
Christmas 1998 would also be a public holiday.
	   ``Smoking the first cigar makes you dizzy,'' said the
archbishop, meaning there would be no going back on the religious
gains. In April, Easter was ``celebrated not only in the church but
also in the streets.''
	   The church has greater access to the media, the bishops said.
And priests can visit political prisoners once or twice a month if
the inmate requests them.
	   The pope, addressing the bishop's earlier in the week, said he
welcomed the gestures made so far by the government but made clear
the Vatican expected greater progress in opening up society.
	   John Paul has made appeals for church-run schools and greater
access to the media.
	   Castro's government, in response to a papal appeal, did release
several hundred prisoners, including some charged with political
offenses.
	   The pope has also called for the repeal of the 37-year U.S.
embargo on Cuba.
	   Asked if he thought the United States was moving toward lifting
the embargo, Santiago's archbishop told reporters: ``You have to be
patient. Things don't change overnight.''
	   On Thursday, direct humanitarian aid from the United States
resumed for the first time in two years when a plane chartered by
Catholic Relief Services arrived in Havana with medicine and
medical supplies.

UNHCR and NATO set up Sarajevo-Tirana humanitarian airlift

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ The leading U.N. aid agency
and NATO are setting up a humanitarian airlift from the Bosnian
capital to Tirana, Albania to assist thousands of ethnic Albanian
refugees, officials said Friday.
	   The first flight of a Norwegian military transport C-130
Hercules airplane is scheduled for Saturday 10:00 a.m. (0800 GMT),
said Ariane Quntier, a spokeswoman for the U.N. High Commissioner
for Refugees in Sarajevo.
	   The plan thrilled many in Sarajevo. The city itself survived the
1992-95 Bosnian Serb siege thanks to a UNHCR airlift, which was the
longest in history.
	   Serbian authorities are conducting a harsh crackdown on ethnic
Albanians in the separatist province of Kosovo.
	   Only one Norwegian NATO plane will be involved in the airlift
initially planned to last four days _ until next Tuesday.
	   Each flight will take some 18 tons of non-food items like tents,
blankets and other sheltering material for an estimated 12,000
refugees who fled fighting in Kosovo and are living in ``very bad
conditions'' in northern Albania, Quntier said.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Authorities in Uzbekistan publicly burned 7.5 tons
of drugs that had been confiscated from traffickers in the past 18
months, a news agency said Friday.
	   The drugs were worth an estimated dlrs 80 million and included
50 kilograms (110 pounds) of heroin, 1.2 tons of opium, 4.8 tones
of hashish and a large amount of marijuana and poppy stalks,
Interfax said.
	   An official from the U.N. International Drug Control Program,
Bogdan Lisovich, who attended the burning in Tashkent, said
``public burning of drugs is a good example for all countries.''

	   HERO Lee Ying-kwong's son has been granted a one-way permit in a
surprise mainland move amid wide public sympathy over the family's
plight.
	   The good news came as Lee's body was found yesterday morning in
the harbour, about 200 metres from the Ocean Terminal in Tsim Sha
Tsui _ two days after he disappeared while trying to rescue two
boys who fell into a flooded nullah in Quarry Bay at the height of
Tuesday's record rainstorm.
	   Lee Kwok-hung, 19, will be arriving at noon from Xinhui in time
for the funeral of his 51-year-old father, said Kwok-hung's uncle
He Beihai.
	   The one-way permit was granted yesterday.
	   The youth will pick up his travel document in Jiangmen city in
western Guangdong this morning before proceeding to Hong Kong.
	   His mother Yip Po-heung, 41, had said she hoped Kwok-hung could
come to Hong Kong to help her.
	   Ms Yip, accompanied by Mr Lee's brother Lee Chung-kwong, broke
down in tears after the body was certified to be that of her
husband.
	   ``Why did you do that? Why did you leave us?'' Ms Yip screamed
in grief when she saw her husband's body.
	   She later thanked the public for their support and assistance.
	   Lee Chung-kwong said everyone would do the same as his brother
had but advised children not to play in dangerous locations.
	   The two boys Mr Lee saved were still in Pamela Youde Nethersole
Eastern Hospital.
	   Sze Kin-man, 12, remained in critical condition. His brother
Kin-keung, 9, was in stable condition last night.
	   Meanwhile, the government said it was considering awarding Mr
Lee the Order of the Medal for Bravery, the first person to be so
honoured, in this year's SAR honours.

Germany continues train export efforts in wake of high-speed crash
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By IAN MADER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Despite its reputation for technological
prowess, Germany has had a hard time catching up with French rivals
in marketing high-speed trains abroad.
	   Last week's disastrous crash of an InterCity Express that killed
100 people isn't expected to help.
	   One major potential customer, Taiwan, said this week it will
wait to see the final accident report before signing a dlrs 1.7
billion deal with Siemens to supply fast locomotives for a
330-kilometer (200-mile) connection on the island.
	   Siemens spokesman Ernest Thompson said the contract originally
was to be signed in July.
	   But the investigation into the June 3 crash in northern Germany
is expected to take months.
	   Investigators so far have focused on a possible wheel failure on
one of the ICE's passenger cars.
	   Mike Knutton, editor of International Railways Journal, said
there could be a psychological impact on other potential buyers _
at least initially _ if investigators fault the train design for
the crash.
	   ``It's a small market for high-speed trains, but it's a glamour
market,'' he said. ``The trains that are sold are, of course, very
prestigious for the home country.''
	   The Taiwan deal involves only ICE locomotives, which have
different wheels than on passenger cars. French companies are to
supply the passenger wagons for the Taiwanese project.
	   A spokeswoman for the Taiwan consortium, Corinna Fu, said they
still expect the deal to go forward before year's end.
	   Siemens and partner Adtranz, a Daimler-Benz subsidiary, also are
pressing ahead with their latest generation of ICEs, with a new
wheel system.
	   The third-generation ICEs are the first to be sold abroad.
Holland has agreed to buy four of the trains, which are to cruise
at top speeds of 300 kilometers (185 miles) an hour _ 100 kph (62.5
mph) faster than the train that crashed was going.
	   France, though, already has exported its high-speed trains to
Spain and Korea and is involved in a joint-venture to produce fast
trains for the northeast U.S. corridor.
	   The French success abroad may have more to do with aggressive
marketing and low bids than anything else, Knutton said. Japan has
run high-speed trains since the 1960s with no fatal accidents and
hasn't sold any abroad, he noted.
	   Australia also wants a high-speed link, between Sydney and
Canberra. German companies are also contenders for that deal.

Death toll in cyclone crosses 700, exodus begins from villages

<TEXT>
	   BOMBAY, India (AP) _ For poor villagers in western India, the
disaster of a cyclone that killed at least 735 people was followed
by desperate shortages that forced them on to mud-choked roads
Friday in search of food and drinking water.
	   The death toll stood at 714 Friday in the hardest-hit state of
Gujarat, as workers continued to find bodies flung on power cables
and trees or buried in sludge left behind by a tidal wave three
days after the cyclone hit land.
	   The cyclone weakened Wednesday as it moved north, leaving nine
more dead in Rajasthan state and 12 more in neighboring Pakistan.
	   At least eight entire villages and three salt factory worker
camps were wiped out near Kandla port, 530 kilometers (330 miles)
northwest of Bombay.
	   The workers earn their living selling salt left behind after sea
water they collect in pans, or shallow pools, evaporates.
	   Soldiers and government officials distributed food and water,
and helicopters airdropped packages, but supplies weren't coming
quickly enough.
	   ``The poor are leaving what is left of their homes and walking
to the next village in search of something to eat,'' said survivor
Tejabhai Desai by telephone from Madhabar, a village near Kandla.
	   ``All the water around here is salty. People can't even drink
the rain water that has collected,'' Desai said.
	   Prices have skyrocketed due to scarcity _ bottled water went
from 10 rupees to 50 (about 23 U.S. cents to dlrs 1.25) in a
country where many people get by on the equivalent of dlrs 1 a day.
	   Fifteen villages remained inaccessible. The army was assisting
government workers in clearing roads blocked by fallen trees and
debris whipped up by winds of up to 100 kph (65 mph) when the
cyclone first hit land in Gujarat on Tuesday.
	   Aid workers were worried that the exodus would create fresh
problems the government would be unable to handle.
	   ``Hundreds of laborers are on the move in search of work. If
they don't find work and can't pay for their next meal, there will
be trouble,'' said Meher Bhatt, head of the Disaster Mitigation
Institute in Ahmedabad, the capital of Gujarat state.
	   Bhatt said the death toll would likely exceed 1,000 in Gujarat
state, a claim Indian officials disputed.
	   ``Those working along the coast as salt workers or construction
workers were migrant labor and, therefore, local people don't know
how many are missing. There will definitely be more than 1,000
dead,'' Bhatt said.

	   THE tumbling yen sent new shockwaves through the world's
financial markets yesterday as fears were expressed of a global
recession and the SAR was urged to brace itself for a devalued
yuan.
	   The yen was hammered again yesterday and broke through 143 to
the US dollar in London last night to trade at 143.54. It had
traded at 141.61 to the greenback in London trading late on
Wednesday and broke through 142 in Asian trading earlier yesterday.
	   The yen, hit by growing signs of recession in Japan, took
another blow last night when US Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin
seemed to rule out international intervention to support it.
	   Mr Rubin said that Washington was ``greatly concerned with the
weakness of the yen'', but that the ``ultimate answer'' to the
currency's weakness lay in Japan.
	   He also said that intervention was ``not a fundamental
solution''.
	   Premier Zhu Rongji had words of comfort for the SAR.
	   He reiterated Beijing's support, saying he was ``confident in
the ability'' of the SAR government to run the economy, according
to television reports.
	   Earlier in Hong Kong, Thai Deputy Prime Minister Supachai
Panitchpakdi warned that Asia could enter a new crisis and lead the
global economy into a ``black hole'' of depression.
	   And the architect of Hong Kong's dollar-peg system, John
Greenwood, speaking at the conference on the region's economic
woes, said that it would be foolish for Hong Kong to count on a
fixed or stable yuan.
	   He urged Hong Kong ``to be ready for changes in China's currency
strategy''. Despite his call for wariness he said he did not expect
the yuan to be devalued.
	   The gloomy forecasts came during another day of losses on the
stock exchange. The Hang Seng index fell 93 points or 1.2 per cent
to close at 7886.07.
	   Compounding yesterday's misery, benchmark three-month interbank
interest rates shot up again to end at 12.09821 per cent, up from
9.57143 per cent.
	   ``The increase in Hibor (Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates) is
caused by the negative sentiment from people panicking about Japan
and the yen-dollar rate,'' an analyst said.
	   Some analysts viewed the market as over-reacting to the
depreciating yen and talk of a yuan devaluation.
	   ``This is a little misguided,'' said Phillip Chan, research
director at Shenyin Wanguo Securities. ``We don't believe the
renminbi (yuan) will be devalued and there is no reason why it
should,'' he said.

World Cup: Salas favorite for golden boot after two goal debut
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Chilean striker Marcelo Salas is on a par with
Brazil's Ronaldo in the betting stakes to win the ``golden boot''
award as the top goal-scorer in the World Cup.
	   British bookmakers Ladbrokes on Friday slashed the odds on Salas
from 50-1 to 4-1 _ equal with Ronaldo _ after he scored twice in
Chile's 2-2 draw with Italy on Thursday.
	   Ladbrokes spokesman Sean Boyce said Argentina's Gabriel
Batistuta was next at 6-1, followed by Germany's Oliver Bierhoff at
8-1 and England captain Alan Shearer at 10-1.
	   Boyce said he was expecting plenty of takers for Ladbrokes'
offer of 25-1 on 18-year-old England striker Michael Owen.
	   ``If Owen starts Monday (against Tunisia) you can expect those
odds to come tumbling down,'' he said.
	   ``Already he's hugely popular with football punters (bettors)
because of his increadible strike rate and if it looks like (coach
Glenn) Hoddle will give him the opportunity I expect the floodgates
will open.''

World Cup: England hero Geoff Hurst to get knighthood
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: For release at 2300 GMT; adds quotes from prime minister &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Call him Sir Geoff.
	   Geoff Hurst, whose three goals earned England the 1966 World Cup
in the final against West Germany, receives a knightood Saturday
from Queen Elizabeth II.
	   The honor for the former West Ham star comes on the eve of
Monday's World Cup opener for England against Tunisia, 32 years
after Hurst brought England its one and only World Cup trophy.
	   Hurst is the only player to have scored a hat trick in the
championship game of the World Cup, although some believe that one
of his three goals in the 4-2 victory didn't cross the goal line.
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair urged current England players
to match Hurst's feat.
	   ``The prime minister, who has since met Mr. Hurst, remembers him
as one of his heroes when he watched the World Cup final in 1966,''
a Blair spokesman said. ``Perhaps this will spur on (Alan) Shearer,
(Michael) Owen and (Teddy) Sheringham to get hat tricks, too.''
	   Hurst is just one of many British sports figures on the queen's
Honors List.
	   Michael Bonallack, secretary of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club
of St. Andrews, also receives a knighthood.
	   The Order of the British Empire (OBE) goes to 1992 Olympic
hurdles champion Sally Gunnell, former Olympic and world 100-meter
champion Linford Christie, and Ian Peacock, chief executive of the
Lawn Tennis Association.
	   Among those receiving the Member of the British Empire (MBE) are
WBC heavyweight boxing champion Lennox Lewis, England cricket
captain Alec Stewart, former England soccer star John Barnes,
Scottish golfer Colin Montgomerie, golfer Alison Nicholas and
middle-distance runner Kelly Holmes

	   ADIGRAT, Ethiopia (AP) _ In the safety of pre-dawn quiet,
townspeople buried two of the victims of an Eritrean air attack,
but the other two were so disfigured in the bombing that they could
not be identified on Friday, a local official said.
	   ``Two were buried early because people wanted to get out of
town,'' said local government spokeswoman Netsanet Asfaw. ``The
other two bodies were unrecognizable and have not been claimed.''
	   Another 30 people were wounded in the bombing, some of them
needing to have limbs amputated. Shops were closed to mourn the
dead and dozens fled to outlying villages for fear of additional
bomb raids.
	   The Eritrean government said in a statement it bombed the
northeastern border town of Adigrat because the Ethiopians had
turned it into ``the main garrison for reinforcing the invading
Ethiopian army and a center for army logistics.''
	   But Ethiopian government spokeswoman Selome Tadesse, speaking in
the capital Addis Ababa, said the attack was ``an act of
desperation'' following ground fighting on two fronts Thursday.
	   Selome said Eritrean forces were ``heavily defeated'' in both
ground clashes, but Eritrea claimed Ethiopian forces were repulsed.
There had been no new clashes reported as of Friday afternoon.
	   Also Friday, a U.S. negotiating team arrived in the Eritrean
capital of Asmara and Rwandan vice president Paul Kagame was
expected to follow. The two countries have authored a proposal for
ending the conflict, which began May 6.
	   The U.S. officials declined comment. The plan, which calls for a
pullback of forces to pre-conflict positions, has been received
favorably by Ethiopia but Eritrea says it needs more work,
specifically on how the disputed border would be demarcated.
	   Regional military sources say the plan calls for Rwanda to
supply peacekeepers to enforce demilitarization of the disputed
border regions.
	   On the Badme-Shiraro front, in the Yirga triangle where the
conflict first erupted, Ethiopian forces captured three tanks and
two anti-aircraft guns and destroyed another of each, Selome said.
	   The Ethiopian military said Friday it also wiped out an entire
Eritrean brigade Thursday in fighting at Bure, along the eastern
border in the region of the Eritrean Red Sea port of Assab.
	   ``A whole commando brigade of the Eritrean People's Liberation
Front has been destroyed,'' said Col. Ephrem Bangee, commander of
Ethiopian troops at a third front just south of the border town of
Zala Ambessa captured by Eritrean forces last week.
	   Bangee said his front, about 20 kilometers (12 miles) northeast
of Adigrat, remained quiet after Ethiopian forces beat back
Eritrean troops earlier in the week, but expected further Eritrean
offensives.
	   Soldiers on the rocky slopes of the Zala Ambessa front hung a
bullseye on a rock for target practice and set up
rocket-propelled-grenade launchers in drills they conducted to pass
the time.
	   Eritrean helicopters and warplanes dropped at least eight bombs
on Adigrat on Thursday evening. Two of the bombs hit a combined
industrial-residential area in the town of 40,000, setting grain
warehouses on fire.
	   Tension in the town eased Friday as the day passed without
incident. But residents repeatedly pointed to the sky saying they
were afraid more bombs were going to fall.
	   Bangee said his army would not ``follow the beacon of the
enemy,'' with immediate retaliation.
	   Asfaw, the Adigrat spokeswoman, said some of the hundreds of
civil militiamen who have taken up posts in Adigrat since fighting
began arrested an Eritrean man Friday who was suspected of spying
for the Eritreans. Asfaw said several alleged Eritrean spies have
been arrested in recent weeks and that security forces have found
bombs in peoples homes.
	   No terrorist incidents have been reported, however.
	   Meanwhile, Eritreans working in ``strategic and sensitive''
Ethiopian state enterprises such as telecommunications and power
companies have been ordered to take a one-month leave but could
stay in the country, Selome said Friday.
	   Several Eritrean businessmen who have allegedly raised money fo
the war effort will be expelled soon, she said.
	   Eritrea accuses Ethiopia of provoking the air attack on Adigrat
by bombing the military-civilian airport at the Eritrean capital of
Asmara on June 5 and 6. A week after those attacks, the Eritrean
Foreign Ministry said for the first time that four civilians had
been killed and 26 wounded in those bombings.
	   Journalists at the airport in the immediate aftermath of the
bombings saw only a handful of wounded, and diplomats reported just
one dead.
	   Eritrean rebels fought Ethiopia for 30 years to gain
independence. They succeeded in 1993, two years after helping
Ethiopian rebels under Meles Zenawi _ who is now prime minister _
oust a 17-year military dictatorship. Relations between the two
countries deteriorated last year after Eritrea introduced its own
currency.

	   Buyers were still not coming in at present, a dealer said.
	   He said prices were likely to fall further as the buyers still
taking a wait-and-see approach.

	   HOUSING advocates have slammed suggestions that the income limit
for Home Ownership and Sandwich Class housing schemes be lowered.
	   They say it would force many of the HOS-entitled homebuyers to
look for property on the more expensive private market.
	   Executive Councillor, Leung Chun-ying, yesterday reportedly said
the government needed to lower the maximum income levels on both
schemes as some families could now afford to buy private flats in
the wake of the property slump.
	   The income limits for HOS subsidies is $33,000 per month and
$33,000$60,000 for Sandwich Class Scheme entitlement.
	   Mr Leung, who is Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa's adviser on
housing, is also a member of the Housing Authority, which manages
the schemes.
	   Housing Authority member and Democratic Party spokesman on
housing Lee Wing-tat said Mr Leung was ``testing the waters'' in an
attempt to benefit property developers by forcing more people to
buy private flats.
	   ``Leung is a very important person. I don't believe it's his
personal opinion . . . there is common thinking between him and Mr
Tung.'' Mr Lee said families earning $33,000 a month would not be
able to save enough money to buy a private flat.
	   Democratic Party vice-chairman, Dr Anthony Cheung Bing-leung,
also a member of the authority, said the party would continue to
push for a higher income limit so more middle-income earners would
have the chance to own homes.
	   A Housing Department spokesman said there had been no official
suggestion to lower the income limits of the schemes.
	   Secretary for Housing Dominic Wong Shing-wah said the government
would be flexible in its demands for private developers to build
35,000 flats a year, in order to meet Mr Tung's target of 85,000
flats annually.
	   Some of the 16,000 HOS flats will go on sale later in the year.
	   Meanwhile, Bank of East Asia chairman David Li yesterday urged
the government to do more to ease the shortage of credit in the
property market in order to alleviate the negative impact of the
economic crisis.
	   Mr Li also urged his fellow bankers not to shut down their
lending programs for the property market.
	   Hong Kong's biggest property developers and banks met to discuss
ways to improve the liquidity in the money markets.
	   The meeting included top officials of Cheung Kong Holdings, Sun
Hung Kai Properties, New World Development Henderson Land
Development, Swire Pacific, Wheelock &AMP; Co, Sino Land, Great Eagle
Holdings and senior executives of HongkongBank, Bank of China,
Standard Chartered Bank and Bank of East Asia.

	   NATIONAL Productivity Corp (NPC) is concerned over a drop in the
number of companies sending their staff for training, with demand
for its public training programmes falling by nearly 50 per cent.
	   NPC director-general Ismail Adam said many companies seem to be
placing less emphasis on training of staff due to the economic
slowdown.
	   ``This is the period to send their staff for training because
they can spare the time to complete a full programme and it also
prepares them for the time when the economy recovers,'' he told
reporters in Petaling Jaya yesterday.
	   Ismail likened staff training during these times to the field of
football where ``players have to continue training to keep in shape
during non-playing seasons''.
	   Before the start of the economic problems, NPC was organising an
average of 15 public training programmes a month, which range from
two to five days.
	   ``However, in-house training programmes conducted by NPC for
companies which provide internal training for their staff are not
affected by the economic turmoil,'' Ismail said. NPC still
organises an average of 20 in- house training programmes a month.
	   He said companies which send their staff to participate in NPC's
training programmes can later claim the expenses incurred from the
Human Resources Development Fund (HRDF) Nonetheless, he added,
recognising that some companies are experiencing financial
difficulties due to the economic situtation, NPC is repackaging and
offering discounts on its programmes.
	   Ismail was speaking after International Trade and Industry
Ministry parliamentary secretary Ahmad Kamaruzaman Mohamed Baria
launched the Malaysian Technical Cooperation Programme 1998. The
programme runs from June 1 to July 25.
	   In his speech, Ahmad Kamaruzaman said that as at the end of last
year, 1.7 million employees had been trained under the HRDF scheme
which disbursed some RM500 million to industries for the purpose.
	   ``In Malaysia, small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)
constitute some 84 per cent of total manufacturing establishments.
	   ``However, their contributions to the country's manufacturing
output, value-added and employment are only 12.3 per cent, 17.5 per
cent and 19.1 per cent, respectively,'' he said.
	   Ahmad Kamaruzaman attributed this to the lower level of
technology and innovations due to lack of capital equipment,
inadequate skilled manpower and overdependence on the domestic
market.
	   He said the Malaysian Technical Cooperation Programme 1998 has
been extended to 97 developing countries in the world since it was
introduced 17 years ago.
	   ``This fact alone speaks a great deal about the effectiveness
and relevance of the programme and the courses conducted by NPC,''
he said. NPC is one of the implementing agencies under the
programme.
	   This year, a total of 20 participants representing 14 developing
countries are involved in the programme. The countries are Egypt,
Cambodia, Fiji, Indonesia, the Maldives, Mongolia, Morocco,
Myanmar, Nepal, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Tonga and
Uganda.
	   Allocations for the annual programme have been affected by the
economic turmoil. From a total of RM670,000 a year, it has been
slashed to RM400,000 this year. The programme comprises two
courses: productivity improvement programme and systems development
for SMEs.

Party that wavers on economic reform to have 4 ministries
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary, (AP) _ A party that questions some of
Hungary's most vaunted economic reforms will have four portfolios
in the new center-right government, it was announced Friday.
	   The key defense portfolio, and the agricultural and
environmental ministries will go to the Independent Smallholders'
Party, and a fourth ministry is subject to negotiation, Janos Ader,
deputy head of the biggest parliamentary party, the Young
Democrats, told the state news agency MTI.
	   His announcement means that five ministries will go to coalition
partners of the Young Democrats, who won 147 seats in the
386-member parliament in general elections last month.
	   The Democratic Forum, which got 18 seats, will head the Justice
Ministry.
	   The populist, right-wing Smallholders' Party won 48 seats and
were the only coalition partners available for the Young Democrats
after they ruled out a ``grand coalition'' with the previously
ruling Socialists, who finished second with 134 seats.
	   Smallholders leader Jozsef Torgyan is regarded as a loose
cannon, and his election promises of cutting taxes and scrapping
the crawling-peg devaluation of the Hungarian currency and fees for
highway use and higher education are seen as fiscally
irresponsible.
	   The new parliament will convene June 18, when President Arpad
Goencz will officially ask Young Democrat leader Viktor Orban to
form a government.

Poor diet, lack of education affect Roma children
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Roma children throughout Europe
continue to struggle with a poor diet and lack of education, but
also must battle stereotypes, an activist said Friday.
	   ``Roma are dangerous and teach their children to steal _ these
are the main stereotypes you find in relations between the majority
of the population and Gypsies,'' said Viorica Stefanescu of Save
the Children.
	   The international non-governmental organization, with branches
in 27 countries, organized a two-day conference that began Friday
on Roma children in Europe.
	   Discussions, attended by representatives from 18 countries,
focused on the health, education and identity of Roma children,
also known as Gypsies.
	   Poor diet causes health problems such as malnutrition, anemia,
dystrophy and rickets in Romania, according to a Save the Children
report.
	   A lack of sanitation, identity papers and health records
sometimes make it difficult for doctors to work among the Roma
population.
	   Most of Europe's Roma live in Eastern Europe and the Balkans,
where they enjoyed a measure of enforced equality during more than
four decades of communism.
	   The end of communist rule, accompanied by growing economic
hardships, led to mass poverty, along with increased threats and
violence.
	   There are officially 400,000 Roma in Romania, but the actual
total is thought to exceed 1 million. Many hide their ethnicity
because of discrimination.

Margaret Thatcher authorizes biography _ to be published
</HEADLINE>
posthumously &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has
authorized a biography on her life and career _ to be published
only after her death.
	   Baroness Thatcher will give special access to her personal and
political papers to the book's author, Charles Moore, editor of the
Daily Telegraph newspaper. But his book cannot appear until she is
dead.
	   The biography on Britain's first female prime minister, who
served in office from 1979 to 1990, is expected to be published in
two or three volumes by Penguin Press.
	   ``This book will be the definitive study of Britain's major
post-war leader, written by one of the most respected
commentators,'' said Andrew Rosenheim, Penguin's managing director.
``It will be among the most important political biographies to
appear in the next century.''
	   Lady Thatcher already has published an autobiography.

	   THESE were some of the claims made by Rajasegaran in a
statement, entitled, ``Anti-Union Actitivies by Certain
Employers'', released at a press conference on June 3 1998.
	   Kian Joo Can Factory: Company refused to recognise the
industrial union but actively sponsored and recognised the in-house
union months before it was registered.
	   U-Hoe Industries Sdn Bhd: Company refused to recognise the
industrial union claiming it recognised an in-house union and also
had concluded a collective agreement. On investigation it was found
that the so called in- house union was in fact a sports club. The
club's chairman was the company's personnel officer.
	   Recognition claim to TH Loy Industries: Since November 14 1994
the company changed its name three times from TH Loy Industries to
Crest Petroleum to Pacific Hall: a new claim had to be submitted
each time it changed its name. The Director-General of Industrial
Relations is unable to carry out a membership certification because
of the company's refusal to cooperate.
	   George Kent (M) Bhd: Terminated a female employee on October 31
1996.
	   The matter was reported to the Industrial Relations Department
and is now pending a decision of the minister. The Human Resources

Dennis is on a roll
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Sports-Basketball-Rodman Suit &QL; 
 &UR; By JIM LITKE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ For once, Dennis Rodman did something for
somebody other than Dennis Rodman.
	   He offered to pick up the cost of the funeral for a black man
chained to the back of a pickup truck and dragged to his death last
weekend. Rodman even showed up at practice Thursday and stood still
long enough to shower himself with praise.
	   ``A lot of people,'' he said, ``don't give me credit for doing a
lot of good things around the country.''
	   That is not exactly true. The croupiers in Las Vegas speak well
of him all the time. Same thing with the parking valets, coat
checkers and bartenders in nightclubs stretching from here to
Tijuana. Add the folks at that wrestling outfit, ``the WLF or the
WFA or whatever that thing is,'' as Bulls coach Phil Jackson put
it. In their minds, Dennis is a prince.
	   And now this good turn. Rodman is on a roll.
	   ``Hopefully,'' he said, ``people will look at me in a different
light, somewhat.''
	   That last word in that sentence is the important one: somewhat.
The time for a career retrospective on Rodman is not now, not when
he is basking in the glow of one very good deed and one exceptional
basketball performance.
	   This is not to minimize either accomplishment. He won Game 4 of
the NBA Finals almost by himself. This is no small feat on a team
that includes Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen. But it was Rodman
who grabbed 14 rebounds, including a handful of the biggest ones;
Rodman who made four free throws down the stretch, when Jordan and
Pippen couldn't make theirs; and Rodman who accomplished most of
this while Utah's Karl Malone clung to him like lint.
	   ``The only person I'm ever intimidated by is my ex-wife. That's
about it. ...
	   ``I think the referees have given me the freedom and luxury to
play Karl Malone this series. They let me do that,'' he said, ``and
Karl Malone is not effective against Dennis Rodman at all.''
	   On every side of him, beginning in the moments immediately after
Game 4 and spilling over into Thursday afternoon, the testimonials
pour in. His coach praises Rodman for motivating himself, rules be
damned.
	   ``He needs to make things difficult for himself,'' Jackson said.
``He always has. So I fine him, but it's not fair to his teammates
to do more. He is what he is.''
	   His teammates complain about the special treatment, but not
loudly. Then they express admiration that Rodman violates every
known disciplinary code, laughs off the sanctions, pays the fines
and still delivers. Then they celebrate alongside him.
	   ``I will never figure this guy out,'' Jordan said. ``I won't
even start. One day he's wrestling, the next he's defending. We've
learned to live with it.''
	   This would be tough enough for parents to explain to their kids,
but it gets worse. Malone, as hard-working and decent a guy as
exists in the sport, is called on the carpet to explain himself.
Next to Rodman and his irreverence, Malone sounds stilted, uncool.
His virtues, too, seem out of date.
	   ``You work all your career to be in this position,'' he said.
``You can't start second-guessing yourself now.''
	   Maybe not, but it seems to have done wonders for Rodman. For all
the weirdness he cultivates these days, it's worth remembering that
he got people to notice him the first time for doing the tough,
dirty work that nobody wanted.
	   Everybody else came into the NBA wanting the flash and cash that
comes with scoring. Until he went out with Madonna and learned the
virtues of self-promotion, the only thing Rodman was obsessed with
was rebounding. His true genius has been to take that singular
skill, an attitude, some tattoos and a few bottles of hair dye and
turn it into a cottage industry. Remember, this is a guy who was
quoted in his own autobiography as saying, ``The only bad press is
an obit.''
	   Nothing changed Wednesday night, despite the basketball, or
Thursday for that matter, despite the noble gesture.
	   Rodman needs exposure. Pippen and Jordan need rebounds. The NBA
needs a villain. All of them have found what they were looking for.
And contrary to what each has said in praise of each another, there
is no higher purpose to it than that.

Bureaucratic red tape hamper's air safety, say air traffic
</HEADLINE>
controllers &QL; 
 &UR; By HEMA SHUKLA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ The lives of millions of passengers in
Indian airspace are threatened because safety recommendations are
not implemented, worker morale is low and procedures are sloppy,
industry experts said Friday.
	   Brijesh Shekhar, general secretary of India's Air Traffic
Controller's Guild said at a seminar in the Indian capital that
passenger safety is dependent on coordination between pilots and
controllers. Any break in the link can lead to a disaster like the
1996 midair collision between a Saudi jetliner and a Kazak cargo
plane that killed all 349 people aboard the two planes.
	   A government commission that investigated the crash recommended,
among other things, that standards for controllers be tightened.
None of the recommendations have been implemented, said Shekhar,
who blamed bureaucratic delays.
	   This, coupled with dated equipment, long hours, fatigue and poor
pay has dampened morale, resulting in frequent strikes and work
slowdowns, Shekhar said. Shekhar represents 800 controllers at 120
airports.
	   Other panelists at the seminar organized by private industry
complained that India's airline industry was careless.
	   People have an ``everything goes,'' kind of an attitude, said
Meera Juneja, a regional director of the Dutch airline KLM.
	   Objects could frequently be found lying runways, posing a hazard
for arriving and departing planes, panelists complained.
	   This week, a plane being loaded collapsed on its tail after
cargo slid to the back of the aircraft, damaging it. Freight
experts said standard procedure were not followed.

	   THREE Hong Kong universities have come out high on a list of the
best universities in Asia for 1998, according to a new survey.
	   Researchers ranked the University of Hong Kong fourth out of 65
Asian universities which offer courses from arts and humanities to
business degrees.
	   The Chinese University of Hong Kong was ranked eighth and the
Hong Kong University of Science and Technology twelth.
	   The Hong Kong Polytechnic University was 34th on the list.
	   The University of Tokyo was given first place and the
International Islamic University in Malaysia was placed 65th _ the
bottom of the list _ by the researchers.
	   Cesar Bacani, senior editor at Asiaweek, which conducted the
survey, said the results this year were similar to those last year
when they first launched the survey. ``As a rule the more well-off
the country the higher the universities were rated as they have
more resources.'' The survey classified the universities according
to factors such as their academic reputation, student selectivity
and faculty resources.
	   They were also ranked according to research output, average
annual teaching pay and benefits.
	   Students per teacher and articles in international journals per
teacher were other factors taken into account.
	   Asiaweek reported that some universities did not take part in
the survey _ among them the City University of Hong Kong _ either
because they refused to or did not send in enough information.

	   CASINO boss Stanley Ho's novel football pools, which kicked off
on Monday in time for the World Cup in France, have stayed mum on
their reported ``very good'' initial response by punters from and
in Hong Kong.
	   A spokesman for SLOT, a subsidiary of Mr Ho's casino monopoly
company STDM running the pools, said yesterday he was unable to
``disclose anything at this point in time'' about the initial
betting turnover, merely saying that it had so far been ``very
good'.' An STDM source said SLOT's silence on its turnover was
``false modesty''.
	   The source said the initial response by punters, including those
from Hong Kong, had been ``very encouraging''.
	   But the source said SLOT was experiencing ``teething problems''
over its vital telebetting operations that were planned to make up
the bulk of the betting turnover.
	   Telebetting accounts can be set up at all branches of the
HongkongBank.
	   A minimum initial deposit of $500 is required.
	   ``It appears they have more applications for telebetting
accounts than they can handle right now,'' the source said.
	   Mr Ho, 76, said last week he expected a betting turnover of up
to a billion patacas (HK$1 billion) during the World Cup in France
alone.
	   Two betting stations started takings bets at noon on Monday.
	   A clerical staff at SLOT, which claims to be Asia's only
government franchised football lottery operator, said yesterday
more than 5,000 telebetting accounts _ most of them from Hong Kong
_ had so far registered.
	   The minimum amount for each telebet is 200 patacas and the
maximum, 200,000 patacas.
	   The lottery's first scheduled betting game was the World Cup
opening match between Brazil and Scotland on Wednesday.

	   DOMESTIC Trade and Consumer Affairs Minister Datuk Seri Megat
Junid Megat Ayub yesterday chided some wholesalers and retailers
for raising the price of local rice at a much higher price than
necessary.
	   ``They get their rice from the same farmers as Padiberas
Nasional Bhd (Bernas). As they (wholesalers and retailers) bid a
higher price for the rice, the farmers will go to them eventually.
	   ``That is why they (wholesalers and retailers) sell the rice at
a higher price to consumers.
	   ``I can understand if the price of rice sold to consumers is a
slightly higher by RM1 or RM2 for them (wholesalers and retailers)
to make a little profit but if the difference in price is RM7, it
would be impossible for the consumers to accept,'' he told
reporters in Kuala Lumpur yesterday after attending the weekly
Cabinet meeting.
	   Megat Junid, who is scheduled to meet rice wholesalers and
retailers today to discuss the price issue, had met Bernas on
Tuesday. Bernas had explained to the minister the situation in the
rice industry especially issues relating to the price rise.
	   ``I want them (wholesalers and retailers) to explain why the
local rice, which is 80 per cent consumed by the public, is much
higher than what it is supposed to be. There may be some elements
of profiteering,'' he said.
	   Bernas had on Monday dismissed allegations that it is the cause
of the increase in the price of rice in the recent weeks.
	   Its managing director, Mohd Ibrahim Mohd Nor, had said that
Bernas supplies only 18 per cent of the rice in the domestic market
and ``as such, I do not believe we are able to shake the market.''
	   Ibrahim said he believed that rice wholesalers and retailers are
taking advantage of the situation to jack up prices.
	   Meanwhile, Megat Junid said the ministry has identified the
prices of three items - rice, chicken and red chillies - as have
experiencing sudden increases.
	   ``If this continuously happens, it can lead to the increase in
the Consumer Price Index,'' he added.

	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Polish-born Pope John Paul II will make
stops in 12 cities when he visits his homeland next year, a
newspaper said Friday.
	   Gazeta Wyborcza said it learned unofficially that the pope will
stay in Warsaw during his June 5-13, 1999, trip.
	   From there, it said, he will travel to the Baltic port city of
Gdansk, Bydgoszcz, Torun and Elk in northern Poland; Lichen,
Lowicz, Siedlce and Drohiczyn in central and eastern Poland; and to
Sandomierz, Zamosc and Krakow in southern Poland.
	   A spokesman for Poland's bishops, the Rev. Adam Schultz, refused
to confirm the information but said a draft itinerary had been sent
to the Vatican for approval.
	   The trip would be John Paul's eighth to Poland since becoming
pope in 1978. During his stay, he is expected to beatify more than
100 Poles killed during the Nazi occupation.

Muslim leader announces presidential candidacy

	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Ending months of
uncertainty, the Muslim chairman of Bosnia's joint presidency
announced Friday that he would campaign again for president.
	   By doing so, Alija Izetbegovic, 73, missed his chance to become
the first leader from former Yugoslavia to give up his presidential
position. In all five republics that became countries, national
leaders who took over the posts between 1989 and 1991 and
participated in the division of Yugoslavia are still in power.
	   ``Balkan leaders don't want to step down from power,''
Izetbegovic jokingly told a press conference.
	   For months, Izetbegovic signaled that he intended to withdraw
from state politics and concentrate on serving as president of the
ruling Muslim Party of Democratic Action, or SDA. He cited health
problems and old age as reasons why he wanted to step aside.
	   Izetbegovic said he was sure he would pull out of public life
until late Thursday, when 68 out of 88 party leaders demanded that
he become a candidate for Bosnia's three-member presidency.
	   At Friday's press conference, Izetbegovic indicated he didn't
expect to survive a four-year term as a member of the presidency.
He suffered a second heart attack in February 1996 and was told by
doctors he shouldn't work any more.
	   Izetbegovic is expected to win most of the Muslim votes and
remain in the joint presidency after September general elections.
But many opposition leaders, independent analysts and experts
foresee the Muslim SDA party _ with or without Izetbegovic _ to
follow the trend of the ruling Bosnian Croat and Serb parties.
	   The hard-line Bosnian Serb party already has lost its absolute
majority and monopoly over the votes of most Bosnian Serbs in the
country, while the same fate is expected for the ruling Bosnian
Croat party after a recent leadership split.

	   FORTY-FOUR World Cup fans were arrested in a Wan Chai bar early
yesterday morning after an undercover police operation exposed an
illegal bookmaking ring.
	   The group, which included 36 men and eight women, was released
on bail last night after they were detained after Wednesday's
inaugural tournament match between Scotland and Brazil.
	   Police seized $6,700 betting money in cash and a betting slip
with a face value of $30,000.
	   A 29-year-old man took a bet from a police officer who posed as
a customer at a bar at 491-499 Lockhart Road during a week-long
operation in local pubs.
	   Police made the arrests after the match at about 1.30 am when
the man settled the bet with the officer. Others in the bar were
also taken in for questioning by the Organised Crime and Triad
Bureau.
	   Five of the men, suspected to be bookmakers aged between 25 and
37, were released later on bail ranging from $5,000 to $10,000 in
cash.
	   The others were bailed out at $1,000 in self-recognisance.
	   All of them will report back to police on 25 June.
	   The law permits gambling only at controlled outlets.
	   Even placing a bet with an overseas bookmaker by phone or via
the Internet on unlicensed Hong Kong premises could be illegal.
	   A spokesman for the Home Affairs Bureau said: ``If people place
bets overseas from Hong Kong they will possibly infringe the
Gambling Ordinance.'' The difficulty in proving an offence lies in
the gathering of evidence for such cases.
	   District operation officer Lee Yick-leung said many people did
not realise the seriousness of the offence.
	   ``Many have a misconception that betting on football matches is
not the same as betting on horses.
	   ``We are trying to drive home the message,'' he said.
	   Like betting on horse racing, betting on football was a ``game
of chance'' and was banned under conditions three and seven of the
liquor licence.
	   Leung Wing-ling, owner of Soccer Pub and Karaoke on Morrison
Hill Road, said no gambling was allowed in his premise.
	   ``Customers here are frequent visitors. They know better not to
gamble,'' he said.
	   Although many of his visitors were first-time customers who came
to watch World Cup matches on the 100-inch big-screen television,
Mr Leung said he made sure no one would bet on matches.
	   ``I would kick them out if I see anyone accepting bet on matches
here.'' Mr Lee said anyone found guilty of illegal gambling could
face a maximum fine of $5 million and two years' imprisonment.

Revisionist Japanese academics contest bestseller on ``Rape of
</HEADLINE>
Nanking'' &QL; 
 &UR; By JOJI SAKURAI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A U.S. bestseller detailing Japanese atrocities in
China in the 1930s is misleading, poorly researched and
exaggerated, a group of conservative Japanese academics said
Friday.
	   ``The Rape of Nanking,'' by Iris Chang, is a vivid account of
what historians widely agree was Japanese soldiers' mass murder and
rape of thousands of civilians in the city now known as Nanjing.
	   Revisionist academics Friday accused Chang of inflating the
magnitude of the killing, basing her book on unreliable sources and
using false captions to the photographs she uses as evidence.
	   ``Iris Chang has something up her sleeve _ that is, she intends
to accuse Japan of the rape of Nanking before she makes sincere
efforts to search for the truth,'' Kazunobu Oyama, a professor at
Kanagawa University, said in a statement.
	   Accounts of the December 1937-January 1938 massacre _ part of
Japan's conquest of China leading up to World War II _ are a
favorite target of Japanese revisionists, who claim critics have
exaggerated tales of Japanese brutality to browbeat Tokyo and win
compensation.
	   ``We don't deny civilians were killed,'' said Akira Nakamura, a
history professor at Dokkyo University. ``But it is doubtful what
happened at Nanjing can be called a holocaust or a massacre.''
	   The scholars told reporters it was impossible for Japanese
troops to have killed 300,000 civilians in Nanjing _ as claimed by
Chang and the Chinese _ because the civilian population in the city
at the time was only 200,000, not 600,000 as in Chang's book.
	   The revisionists also blamed some of the killing on the Chinese
themselves. For example, they said Chinese soldiers disguised
themselves as townsfolk, making it hard for Japanese forces to
distinguish between civilians and the Chinese military.
	   Nobutaka Fujioka, an outspoken Tokyo University professor, took
aim at Chang's use of photographs, saying she had misled readers by
attaching false captions to shots presented as depictions of the
massacre.
	   He said a photograph of a Japanese tank setting fire to a house
in Nanjing could not have been authentic because the tank was
produced in 1938, after the Nanking massacre occurred.
	   He claimed that it was impossible to ascertain where and when a
picture of the severed heads of Chinese men had been taken, making
it useless as evidence of Japanese atrocities.
	   Other pictures had been deliberately trimmed and distorted to
fit captions used to illustrate Chang's case, Fujioka said.
	   Such revisionist versions of Japan's wartime role are gaining
popularity among Japanese. ``Pride,'' a film that depicts convicted
war criminal Gen. Hideki Tojo as a hero, is the top-earning
domestic film in Japan so far this year, according to its producer.
	   The revisionists on Friday attempted to depict the occupation of
Nanjing as largely benign, citing Japanese newspaper photographs
showing Japanese soldiers playing with children and handing out
medicine.
	   The group claimed that Chang had overstated the raping and other
acts of brutality, saying they had been individual acts by
undisciplined soldiers rather than actions endorsed by military
commanders.
	   As for eyewitness accounts of unbridled murder and looting?
	   ``The Chinese people have a tendency to exaggerate,'' Nakamura
said.

	   HONG Kong share prices plunged 4.9 per cent yesterday to a more
than three-year low amid concerns over the weakness of the Japanese
yen and higher interbank interest rates, dealers said.
	   ``The falls were mainly due to the weakening of the Japanese yen
and the rising interbank rates,'' said Mr Sean Li, associate
director at Amsteel Securities.

	   AT LEAST five civil service unions involved in municipal
services want the municipal councils to be dissolved.
	   The unions said the move would not bring about a threat to their
job security.
	   They said this move would help to get rid of ``troubles'' made
by some ``unprofessional'' councillors who ``make decisions based
on their own interests rather than the public interest''.
	   It would also remove the confusion of different policies from
the two councils.
	   The five unions include more than 7,000 civil servants, or about
one-quarter of the 27,000-strong Urban and Regional Services
department.
	   Jim Chang Hok-yan, chairman of the Government Librarian Grade
Staff Association, said his members would enjoy greater job
security if the two councils were dissolved.
	   ``We want to maintain our civil servant status and the benefits
we enjoy now, whatever changes are made to the district
organisations,'' he said.
	   The same line was echoed by Cheng Chiu-kit, chairman of the
Federation of Urban Services Department Trade Unions, which
comprises four unions including hygiene inspection, abattoirs,
cleansing and hawker control.
	   The government is consulting the public on proposals to dissolve
the councils and transfer their work to government departments and
relevant statutory bodies.
	   Other proposals include merging the two councils, merging the
councils with district boards to form several regional bodies and
maintaining the status quo.
	   Michael Suen Ming-yeung, Secretary for Constitutional Affairs,
has said the number of civil servants employed ``would not be
affected'' by any future changes.
	   He said the final decision on the future of district
organisations would be based on ``needs''.
	   Provisional Urban Council member Fred Li Wah-ming of the
Democratic Party, said in response to the criticism that some
councillors are ``unprofessional'', that the head of the civil
service, Lam Woon-kwong had admitted there were staff in the
municipal services who were ``loafing''.
	   He said the unions' response reflected the need for an elected
council to supervise municipal work.

Student survivor of rebel killings tells of human ``roasted meat''
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ A survivor of a rebel massacre at a
technical institute in western Uganda said Friday his colleagues
were reduced to ``a heap of roasted meat'' in burned dormitory.
	   ``I managed to count the bodies of our burned colleagues,''
Milton Aguzu said in a speech at a demonstration against the
attackin which 80 people were killed. ``I used to eat meat, but I
no longer can because of what I saw.''
	   Aguzu said he survived last Monday's massacre at the Kichwamba
Technical Institute near Kabarole, 316 kilometers (195 miles) miles
west of Kampala by hiding in the bushes.
	   The government said the attack was carried out by the Allied
Democratic Forces group, whose goal is to oust President Yoweri
Museveni.
	   Initial reports said the insurgents planned to abduct the
students, but when the students barricaded themselves inside one of
the college buildings, the rebels set fire to it.
	   About 40 government soldiers camped near the institute were
outnumbered four to one by the insurgents, the government said.
	   Students from Makerere University and technical institutes in
Kampala demonstrated Friday against the attack, singing traditional
funeral songs and waving placards saying, ``Why kill innocent
students?'' and ``Fight soldiers not students.''
	   The insurgents have bases in the foothills of the Rwanzori
Mountains that form the border between Uganda and the Democratic
Republic of the Congo. They stage frequent attacks on Uganda's
western districts along the border. Some of the rebels are members
of former armies or groups defeated by Museveni's National
Resistance Movement in 1986.
	   The government is also fighting rebels from the West Nile Bank
Front in the northwest and from the Lord's Resistance Army in the
north.

World Cup: Paraguay, Bulgaria play scoreless first half
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MONTPELLIER, France (AP) _ Hristo Stoichkov hit the post late in
the first half but Bulgaria was held to a 0-0 draw at half time in
their World Cup opener against Paraguay on Friday.
	   The Bulgarians, considered favorites in the Group D match,
opened up with several swift atacks and a shot by Kressimir Balakov
that just missed in the second minute.
	   Two minutes later, a Stoichkov was upended in the Paraguayan box
but his pleas to Saudi referee Abdul Rahman Al-Zeid went unheeded.
	   Bulgaria's best chance came in the 35th minute when Stoichkov
took advantage of hesitation by two Paraguayan defenders and hit
the post with a left-footed shot which had Paraguayan keeper Jose
Luis Chilavert totally beaten.
	   The Paraguayans rarely threatened the Bulgarian goal, taking 19
minutes before Carlos Morales' got their first shot, a free kick
that had to be stopped by Bulgarian goalkeeper Zdravko Zdravko with
a diving save.

	   SHARES on the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE) closed broadly
lower yesterday as the regional currencies woes took centre stage,
dragging the key KL Composite Index (KLCI) to close 15.78 points
lower or 3.12 per cent down to 489.86.
	   Selling activities were rampant across the board yesterday due
to the declining ringgit against the US dollar, said analysts.
	   ``It was like a selling spree because of nervousness ...,'' said
one.
	   Continued selling on heavyweight stocks such as Maybank, Tenaga,
Telekom, Genting and Sime Darby weighed local sentiment.
	   One analyst said, ``Everywhere we turn now, we see problems and
uncertainties. It is difficult for the stock market.''
	   The declining yen, he said is expected to continue to be the
main factor that contributes to the bearish sentiment.
	   At the close, the broader Emas Index lost 3.26 points to 126.27
while the Second Board Index was down by 1.30 points to 107.57.
	   The scoreboard showed 455 losers, with 114 gainers and 152
counters remaining unchanged.
	   The broad-based BT Ordinaries eased 3.35 points to 119.25 while
the 30- share New Straits Industrial Index slipped 45.37 points to
end at 2,929.25.
	   On the KLSE, total turnover was higher with 111.432 million
shares valued at RM281.706 million compared with 84.244 million
shares worth RM179.801 million on Tuesday.
	   Turnover on the main board totalled 96.650 million shares valued
at RM269.347 million while trade on the Second Board was 7.206
million shares worth RM10.023 million.
	   Maybank was the most avtive counter yesterday with 7.529 million
shares traded followed by Tenaga with 6.953 million shares. Telekom
was the third active with 6.360 million shares changing hands.

	   THIRTEEN people were evacuated from a luxury Mid-Levels
apartment building after a landslip scarred an unregistered slope.
	   Emergency repair work was being hurriedly carried out on the
hill, which separates Bowen Road and Magazine Gap Road.
	   The 50-metre landslip damaged Bowen Mansion at the foot of the
hill.
	   Five flats facing the scarred slope were evacuated by police as
the Highways Department worked to clear the debris.
	   Falling rocks and soil damaged air-conditioning units and
windows up to the third floor of the building.
	   ``The rocks and soil gained a lot of momentum from falling so
high, so they caused quite some damage,'' said Senior Geotechnical
Engineer Jerry Ho Leung-ping.
	   He said the landslip created a pile of debris measuring five by
six cubic metres near Bowen Mansion.
	   ``The Highways Department workers are spraying the erosion scar
with concrete and removing the debris from the building.'' Mr Ho
anticipated the possible use of soil nails and installation of
horizontal drains to make the slope stable.
	   Experts from the Landslip Investigation Division (LID) were
trying to determine whether the recent heavy downpour caused the
erosion of the slope.
	   The landslip was reported around 10 am by a woman who was
awakened by rocks smashing into her window.
	   Residents of the five flats will not be permitted to return
until the LID has determined if the slope is stable.
	   The Geotechnical Engineering Office does not maintain natural
hills because they will have to remove grass and trees in the
process.
	   ``These natural hills have been around for thousands of years,
so we don't want to disturb them unless there are signs of risk,''
Mr Ho said.
	   He said the best preventive measure was to avoid erecting
buildings near risky slopes.
	   ``Builders need to make sure that they have a good buffer zone
if they build near a risky hill.''

	   A FORMER top banker once charged with laundering $7.08 million
was yesterday awarded a ``substantial'' amount of costs against the
government.
	   Kevin Wallace, an ex-private banker of Merrill Lynch, did not
appear in Eastern Magistracy for the award.
	   His lawyer, Alexander King, refused to disclose the whereabouts
of Mr Wallace, 46, who was once stranded in Hong Kong.
	   ``Mr Wallace was forced to stay in Hong Kong for nine months,
unable to work and meet his family,'' Mr King said outside court.
	   The American was originally charged with dealing with $7.08
million known or believed to represent proceeds of an indictable
offence.
	   He appeared in court for the first time last July but the case
was adjourned three times pending inquiries.
	   Prosecutors decided to drop the case in March as they could not
secure overseas witnesses to attend.
	   Magistrate Garry Tallentine granted the costs to Mr Wallace.
	   Mr Wallace worked for Merrill Lynch International Bank in
Singapore from April 1990 to April 1997.

Britons getting new 2-pound coins in their change
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Britons can fill their pockets with a little more
spending power next week as a new 2-pound coin goes into
circulation.
	   The 2-pound piece, worth about U.S. dlrs 3.25 at current
exchange rates, is the nation's first multicolored coin. With a
white center and yellow ring around the outside, it resembles some
of the change circulating in continental Europe, such as France's
10-franc piece.
	   The launch of the new coins has vending machine operators, the
telephone company and parking meter suppliers scurrying to make
sure customers can use them.
	   Many prepared for the change last year, when Britain introduced
a slightly smaller version of its 50-pence coin, worth about 82
U.S. cents.
	   Like all British money and postage stamps, the coins bear a
likeness of Queen Elizabeth II.
	   Roger Holmes, the deputy master of the Royal Mint, called the
coin ``a new and worthy addition to Britain's coins.''
	   The coin also demonstrates ``how the coinage can be updated to
meet changing needs and demands,'' he said, politely declining to
point out that means higher prices.

	   FORMER Selangor Menteri Besar Tan Sri Muhammad Muhammad Taib
pleaded not guilty at the Sessions Court in Kuala Lumpur yesterday
to a charge of failing to declare all his and his family's assets
last year.
	   His case was then transferred to the High Court in Kuala Lumpur
after the Sessions Court allowed the prosecution's request. The
High Court fixed trial for December 7 to 18 this year.
	   Earlier, Sessions Court Judge Mohamad K. Abdul Rahman allowed
Muhammad a bond of RM10,000 without surety to ensure the former
Menteri Besar's presence at the High Court.
	   Muhammad, 53, is charged with committing the offence under the
Prevention of Corruption Act or Akta Pencegah Rasuah (APR) 1961 on
May 26 last year.
	   He is charged with knowingly ignoring conditions in a statutory
declaration dated May 23 1997 by declaring assets worth, at the
time of acquisition, only RM10.82 million and A$3.46 million (A$1  &QC; 
RM2.41 at current exchange rates).
	   The Public Prosecutor had required Muhammad to declare, under
Section 25 (1)(a) APR 1961 (Act 57) in a notice dated April 10
1997, all movable and immovable assets belonging to him or owned by
his agents or trustees, wife and children.
	   He is alleged to have committed the offence at the office of the
Deputy Public Prosecutor in the Anti-Corruption Agency's
headquarters in Pesiaran Duta, Kuala Lumpur, on May 26 last year.
	   Under Section 25(2) of the Act, Muhammad faces a maximum
sentence of one year's imprisonment or a fine of RM2,000, or both,
upon conviction.
	   Senior Deputy Public Prosecutors Datuk Abdul Gani Patail and
Azahar Mohamed prosecuted, while Muhammad was represented by
counsel Muhammad Shafee Abdullah and Burhanudeen Abdul Wahid.
	   On May 29 this year, Muhammad was acquitted by the Brisbane
District Court of two charges of making a false declaration
pertaining to the amount of money he was bringing into Australia on
December 16 1996, and failure to declare an equivalent of A$1.26
million when he was leaving for New Zealand six days later.
	   During the trial, Muhammad said he had purchased properties
valued at more than RM10.4 million in Australia and New Zealand
under the name of his wife, Puan Sri Asbi Rohani Asnan.
	   The properties are a piece of land valued at A$460,000 and a
bungalow valued at A$460,000 in Sovereign Islands, Gold Coast, a
farm in Currajong, also in Australia, valued at A$3.7 million, and
two pieces of land and a house in New Zealand valued at NZ$4
million (NZ$1  &QC;  RM2.05).
	   Muhammad resigned as Selangor Menteri Besar on April 14 1997,
following the Australian court case, and last Monday the Umno
Supreme Council extended his leave as party vice-president until
the court has made a decision on his case.

	   INVESTORS in failed brokerage CA Pacific are willing to accept
smaller refunds so that all can benefit from the $325 million
compensation package announced on Wednesday.
	   Some 20 representatives of the investors put forward the
counter-proposal in a meeting with Stock Exchange officials
yesterday. They also urged the government to inject money into the
collapsed company instead of giving them cash in advance.
	   The stock exchange had announced a scheme in which the
government would pay $325 million in advance to enable 70 to 80 per
cent of the investors to claim up to $150,000 from the compensation
fund.
	   But investors said instead of making some of them receive
nothing under the package, they would each prefer to get less.
Democrat Dr John Tse Wing-ling accused the government of not doing
enough. ``The money ($325 million) that the government is giving
out is only cash in advance. They will take the money back later.''

Thai shares and currency continue fall
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's benchmark stock index fell
for a sixth consecutive day Friday, deepening worries among
investors that the country's economic crisis is worsening.
	   The Stock Exchange of Thailand index closed at 279.37 points,
4.55 points, or 1.6 percent off Thursday's close.
	   At Friday's closing level, the SET index was down 25 percent
from its closing level on the last trading day of 1997, and at its
lowest point since Dec. 16, 1987.
	   Dealers attributed the slump to gloom among investors about
medium-term prospects for Thailand's financial markets.
	   Moody's Investors Service predicted Thursday that Thai banks may
not be able to recover up to dlrs 30 billion in bad loans, a figure
equal to a quarter of the country's gross domestic product.
	   At the same time, some major Thai companies have started to
suspend repayments of foreign debt, citing an inability to pay.
	   ``The reason the market is going down is more of the same:
people have fears about the Thai economy,'' said Stuart Matthews,
head of research at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell Securities.
	   He said investors are dumping stocks because they see little
value in them given the amount of capital Thai companies will have
to raise in the next few years.
	   The Thai baht, meanwhile, ended lower in Asian spot trading
Friday, amid a regional currency sell-off sparked by the fall of
the yen to an eight-year low against the U.S. dollar.
	   Dealers said profit-taking on dollars managed to pull the baht
up from the day's low by the close of trade.
	   At Friday's close, the baht has dropped 40.4 percent since the
Thai government abandoned its fixed foreign exchange system last
July 2.
	   Dealers attributed the baht's decline to worries that the yen's
slump was putting increasing pressure on China to devalue its own
currency to keep its exports competitive. A devaluation by China,
analysts said, would hurt most other Asian currencies.
	   The yen fell Friday to an eight-year low of around Y144 to the
dollar.
	   Thai central bank governor Chatu Mongol Sonakul said Friday
speculators on the Thai currency had ``lost in the millions'' of
dollars after the Bank of Thailand intervened to stop their
activities.
	   ``They know we are serious. They know we have the power. And
they had lost in the millions,'' he told reporters.
	   Chatu Mongol had said last week that the central bank had
intervened in the trade of Thai baht, but he didn't specify when
the intervention took place.
	   He said the intervention had warded off speculation and helped
stabilize the baht.

	   THE fifth skills opportunity school will be opened in September
to aid the growing number of students who have trouble adapting to
normal class studies.
	   The Chi Lin Nunnery, which has been devoted to community
services, built the Buddhist Secondary School with the help of
private donors.
	   The already-opened skills opportunity schools cater for
Secondary 1 and Secondary 3 students aged between 12 and 14 who
need intensive remedial support.
	   Principal of the Chi Lin Buddhist Secondary School K L Chansaid:
``Chi Lin Nunnery in providing educational services has a primary
school and is now also running a kindergarten. They are well
received by pupils and parents alike and also well supported by the
community.'' Mr Chan said the skills opportunity school is a new
concept that is being quickly developed.
	   ``Despite our lack of experience, we will do our best.
	   ``We will act with love, patience and innovation.'' The
curriculum will emphasise the diverse needs of the pupils and
courses will be tailor-made to their aptitude.
	   Flexible and interest-oriented teaching methods will be used to
help pupils establish confidence and independence and to help
develop their potential.

Swiss government halts Kosovo refugee returns
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Yugoslavia-Kosovo, NATO-Kosovo &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Switzerland is freezing the return of
unsuccessful asylum seekers from the Yugoslav province of Kosovo
until the end of July, Justice Minister Arnold Koller announced
Friday.
	   The reason for the decision was ``the danger of a further
escalation of the conflict in Kosovo,'' Koller told a news
conference.
	   The situation will be reviewed at the end of July, he added.
Those who have committed a criminal offense will not benefit from
the freeze, Koller said.
	   The ruling coalition cabinet has come under intense criticism in
recent weeks for continuing to return rejected asylum seekers to
Kosovo.
	   Last month, the United Nations refugee agency reiterated a plea
made in March to European governments not to send them back.
	   To do so ``would pose security risks for those sent back and

Commissioner for Refugees Sadako Ogata said in a letter.

	   ENCIK Norman Abdul Halim is ambitious. The managing director of
KRU Bhd wants to turn his company into a giant media and
entertainment group like Disney or Warner.
	   In the short span of seven years since the rap group KRU burst
into the Malaysian entertainment scene, Norman and his two brothers
- Yusry and Edry - have succeeded in turning KRU Bhd into one of
Malaysia's top corporate players in the entertainment world.
	   They have successfully amassed RM10 million in assets for the
company and are handling businesses worth much more.
	   The economic slowdown has not dampened their spirits to achieve
much more for the company. Instead, it has spurred them to work
harder to consolidate the company's position.
	   While Norman is in the forefront of KRU Bhd, his brothers are
more inclined towards the production and technical aspects of the
music business.
	   Under the KRU Bhd flagship is KRU Productions (music and artiste
management), KRU Publishing (music copyright protection), KRU
Records (artiste and repertoire), DB Lumens (sound and lighting
company), Bizzare Events (event management) and the newly-created
KRU Motion Pictures (telemovies and production of music and
corporate videos).
	   There is also a joint-venture company called KRU Beverages,
which manufactures and distributes Kruze Cola.
	   This and more from a company which started with a RM2,000
advance from EMI to buy a keyboard.
	   ``Music is a hobby, doing business is my interest,'' Norman told
Business Times when asked why he decided to venture into business
instead of concentrating on being the a ``pop icon''.
	   ``KRU Bhd is a blend of the two ... it is doing business, which
is very much linked to the music world.''
	   But Norman wants to diversify the company's business into
something he described as more ``corporate.''
	   ``We have been doing music videos but we can also do corporate
videos ...
	   which not many people know about. We are convinced enough that
we are able to do it and offer them high quality product at a
competitive price.
	   ``We are doing a corporate video of our own company now so that
we will be able to show other companies what we can offer,'' he
added.
	   Not many know that KRU Bhd's subsidiaries are already doing jobs
for the Malaysian Industry-Government Group for High Technology
(MIGHT). MIGHT had engaged DB Lumens for the Langkawi International
Dialogues.
	   KRU Bhd has also organised events for several projects such as
Le Tour de Langkawi.
	   ``Our focus is on media and entertainment because we know our
capabilities in these areas. We have proven that we can organise
events through our own concert tour, the KRUmania Mega Tour, and
the Le Tour de Langkawi concert.
	   ``We built this company on our own merits and credibility ...
heavily using information technology applications in our work.''
	   Norman said while the ``pop icon'' hype has not helped that much
in terms of promoting what the company is doing or can do for the
corporate community, it is a brand name which he is using to sell
the company.
	   ``We, KRU, is a business in itself. We are our product. Yes, we
bopped and bounced on stage during performances but when dealing
with the corporate sector, we are as serious as any businessman.
	   ``People see us differently. We know where to draw the line
where image is concerned ... I cannot expect people to be convinced
of my ability to do business if I were to dress the way I did when
I perform on stage,'' he said.
	   The name, KRU, has opened some doors of opportunities for the
company.
	   ``First, we give them the group. Then we tell them these are the
things that we are capable of doing ... our products are our
credentials. It has worked well for us,'' he added.
	   KRU Bhd has, on its payroll, 40 professionals handling among
others the human resources, legal, finance and corporate affairs of
the company.
	   He said the ban on the KRUmania Mega Tour last year, which
prompted the intervention of Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar
Ibrahim, was actually a blessing in disguise for the group.
	   ``People opened their eyes as to what KRU, as a group, can do.
We handled the tour ourselves, using our own expertise and
equipment. People realised that although we are young, but we have
the commitment to see through what we aim to do.''
	   Does he thinks KRU Bhd is growing too big, too fast? ``I don't
think so.
	   We gave ourselves 10 years to establish our name in the industry
... it just so happens that we did this in a shorter period of
time,'' he said.
	   Norman said KRU Bhd decided to go ahead with the setting up of
KRU Motion Pictures at a time when some 2,000 production houses
have closed because ``we were in too deep already.
	   ``We made our commitments for some of the equipment early last
year. Then the crisis set in. We believed, however, it could be
used to our advantage. At our own facility and using our own
equipment, we can actually produce music videos and corporate
videos at a competitive price.''
	   He is also looking at opportunities abroad. In Singapore, KRU
Motion Pictures has formed a tie-up with Fandi Ahmad International,
a company owned by Singapore's ex-soccer star Fandi Ahmad. The
joint venture company will tap the huge business opportunities
available in the republic.
	   Norman has also set his sights on business opportunities in
Brunei and the US where it is looking for an agent to market its
services such as those in the music production aspects of the
business.
	   ``We are spreading our risks instead of putting all the eggs in
one basket. We want to be a diversified group,'' he said.
	   While the effects of the economic crisis may have some impact on
the company, Norman said the company is adjusting accordingly.
	   Citing an example, he said, KRU Beverages has slowed down due to
the present situation.
	   While the product, Kruze Cola, is marketable, it does need a
good distribution network. ``It is a volume game but it is not a
good time to give credit sales. We are keeping the product in the
market at minimum quantity,'' he added.
	   Reporting good returns for the 1996 and 1997, he said, these
were the progressive years for the company. ``We were looking at 80
per cent to 120 per cent returns then.''
	   ``Now, while we cannot control what is happening externally, we
can adjust to the situation.
	   ``It is a crawling period for some of the companies in the
stable but we have contingency plans. As an owner, you take all the
precautions. We make do with what we have and get the job done ...
without compromising on quality of the work,'' he said.
	   Besides managing the KRU Bhd and the other companies under the
flagship, Norman still pens and produces songs on top of performing
at shows and concerts with his brothers.
	   ``No grey hair yet but I would probably get a heart attack
first,'' he quipped, when asked if he is finding it stressful being
a ``pop icon'' while at the same time handling businesses worth
millions of ringgit.
	   ``No, I'm not tired yet ... I enjoy doing the things I do but I
find that the stress gets back to me. KRU as a group has a long way
to go and in business, we aim to sustain,'' he said.
	   True to the lyrics of the song he is writing for the
Commonwealth Games 1998 titled ``Never Let the Spirit Die'', Norman
is letting his spirits soar to greater heights.

On national holiday, Yeltsin admits reforms taking longer than

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin conceded Friday that
Russia's reforms are taking longer than expected and warned
Russians that it will take more time for the country to become
prosperous and stable.
	   Speaking on Russia Day, which commemorates Russia's declaration
of sovereignty from the Soviet Union in 1990, Yeltsin tried to put
the best face on his achievements in the past eight years.
	   However, in a nationally televised address, he admitted that
Russians had good reason to be disappointed by the slow pace of
reform.
	   While there have been successes, Yeltsin said, ``They have not
resulted in a noticeable improvement in living conditions. Russia's
economy has not become prosperous and stable, nor are its citizens
well provided for or confident of their future.''
	   None of that comes as news to Russians, who are well aware that
their country is stuck in a particularly difficult passage between
a command economy and one driven by the market.
	   In fact, what was bigger news to most Russians was that Friday
was Russia Day, which the government was promoting as the main
holiday of the year. It was a day off for most people, and roads
out of Moscow were clogged with people headed to the country for a
long weekend.
	   According to a nationwide poll earlier in the week, virtually
nobody in the country was aware of the holiday's name. Forty-seven
percent of those questioned said they thought Friday was
Independence Day _ not a bad answer, but technically incorrect.
	   Others thought the day commemorated Yeltsin's election as
president. Twelve percent said they didn't know it was a holiday at
all, and 25 percent were ``undecided,'' according to the pollsters,
the All Russian Center for Public Opinion Research. They did not
give the poll's margin of error.
	   In his speech, Yeltsin said the past eight years had ``not been
an easy test for any of us. It was difficult, but we withstood, we
didn't give up, we didn't turn back.''
	   While it's true that prosperity has so far eluded most Russians,
Yeltsin reminded them of the one ``tangible achievement'' of
post-Soviet Russia: freedom.
	   ``The freedom to speak one's mind. The freedom to pursue one's
religion. The freedom to elect the mayor, member of parliament,
governor, president,'' Yeltsin said.
	   ``However, freedom ... can only be won, sometimes by sacrificing
your calm, your convenience and well-being. Both the state and its
citizens need this freedom. It will help to reveal the huge
potential of our people and will help to make a sharp
breakthrough.''

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ As brass bands played in town squares
throughout the nation, President Fidel Ramos jubilantly waved a
large Philippine flag Friday in a re-enactment of the country's
declaration of independence from Spain 100 years ago.
	   Church bells pealed and government offices offered free food as
Filipinos commemorated Asia's first revolution against Western
colonial rule.
	   Ramos urged the nation to use its hard-won independence as an
inspiration in dealing with the current Asian financial crisis.
	   ``Our heroes claimed our people's right to be free,'' said
Ramos, whose term ends June 30. ``Whenever our resolve should
falter, let us look back to how our story as a nation began.''
	   Ramos waved the flag from the balcony of a refurbished house in
Kawit town in Cavite province, south of Manila, where revolutionary
leader Gen. Emilio Aguinaldo proclaimed independence on June 12,
1898, from 333 years of Spanish colonialism.
	   More than 30 countries sent representatives to join Friday's
celebration in Kawit and at Manila's Rizal Park, named after
national hero Jose Rizal, who was shot by the Spanish for
advocating equality.
	   Hundreds of thousands gathered to watch a parade depicting the
country's struggle against Spanish colonialism and a massive
fireworks display over Manila Bay.
	   The festivities, which ended with street dancing and a
government-sponsored musical concert at a Manila track and field
stadium, were beamed live by television in cities nationwide, where
day-long celebrations were also held.
	   Leftist groups under the New Patriotic Alliance, however, burned
an American flag at an ``alternative'' celebration to highlight the
United States' subsequent takeover of the Philippines, which they
said was downplayed in the government-sponsored festivities.
	   Ramos, elected in 1992, dismantled monopolies and deregulated
many industries, allowing Filipinos to enjoy economic progress
after years of stagnancy. The reforms helped shield the Philippines
from the worst effects of the regional currency crisis.
	   ``It may take some more years for us to realize the full
benefits of freedom,'' Ramos said. ``But we have learned ... that
freedom without growth, without development and without justice is
largely meaningless.''
	   In 1892, Filipino nationalists established a secret society
called the Katipunan, which prepared for armed rebellion against
Spain.
	   The revolt erupted four years later and spread rapidly through
much of the country.
	   A month before the declaration of independence, U.S. naval
forces destroyed a Spanish armada in Manila Bay, in fighting that
followed the outbreak of the Spanish-American war.
	   Spain, still unwilling to hand over power to the Filipino
revolutionaries, ceded the country to the United States for dlrs 20
million in December 1898.
	   The following year, hostilities broke out between Filipino
revolutionaries and American forces sent to occupy the new U.S.
colony. The brief but brutal Philippine-American war is considered
by some historians as the ``first Vietnam'' of the United States.
	   The United States formally granted the Philippines independence
in 1946, but American influence remains strong.

World Cup: Campaigning chancellor pays quick visit to team
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NICE, France (AP) _ Two years ago, after winning the European
title, the German players broke out into a song when two prominent
guests came to the locker room to congratulate them.
	   ``Helmut, sink the tax rate, Egidius open the purse,'' the song
went.
	   Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Egidius Braun, chairman of the German
Soccer Federation, would love to hear the song again _ in Paris
after the World Cup on July 12.
	   A jovial Kohl came Friday to the Cote d'Azure to give the German
national team a morale boost before its opening World Cup game and
perhaps earn a few points from voters back home.
	   Kohl, who claimed his visit had nothing to do with politics,
flew into Nice aboard a special Luftwaffe plane, faced the press
and then went off to have coffee with the team.
	   The Germans are staying at the four-star Mas d'Artigny, a
walled, wooded compound outside Saint-Paul-de-Vence in the hills
above Nice.
	   At the start of his four-hour visit, Kohl met with Braun, coach
Berti Vogts and four senior players before facing reporters at a
press center set up by the Germans outside their training ground at
Charles Ehrmann stadium.
	   Braun reminded Kohl of the song the players sang after winning
the European title in 1996 at Wembley with a 2-1 win over the Czech
Republic, as the two of them went into the locker room.
	   ``It would be wonderful to hear the song again,'' Kohl said.
	   Kohl has a habit of visiting the German soccer team abroad and
is a proclaimed lover of the game. Although he said his visit had
nothing to do with him being chancellor, some populist exposure
won't hurt in his uphill battle to win re-erection in September.
His challenger, Social Democrat Gerhard Schroeder, is also thinking
of flying in.
	   The chancellor predicted Germany would beat all its three group
opponents _ the United States 3-1, Yugoslavia 2-1 and Iran 2-0.
	   ``Then we'll probably play one of our neighbors and one is
definitely more uncomfortable than the other,'' Kohl said about a
possible second-round clash with traditional rival the Netherlands.
	   Kohl said he won't be able to attend Germany's opening game
Monday in Paris against the United States because of a EU summit _
``I have to fight my own hard battles in Cardiff'' _ but that he's
left July 12, the date of the final, open in his diary.
	   ``We have a very good chance of achieving a big success,'' Kohl
said.
	   Captain Juergen Klinsmann then gave Kohl a soccer ball signed by
all players.

	   AN aerial monitoring system could alert Hong Kong to the red
tide menace and help minimise damage by giving early warnings, an
expert said yesterday.
	   The suggestion for an aircraft-borne monitoring system comes as
the government is considering reducing its present level of
monitoring through water samples.
	   Professor Rudolph Wu Siu-sum, of the City University's
department of biology and chemistry, said a multi-scan device from
the air could reveal the spectrum of the chlorophyll content in
local waters, which would indicate the presence of algae.
	   If fish farmers were warned early about the presence of red-tide
algae they could take measures to ensure the safety of their stock.
	   Prof Wu spoke yesterday at the Second International Conference
on Marine Pollution and Ecotoxicology.
	   He confirmed that the high incidence of red tide was linked to
the poor quality of local waters.
	   ``If water quality deteriorates the chance of red tides is
higher,'' Prof Wu said.
	   Secretary for Planning, Environment and Lands Bowen Leung
Po-wing told visiting experts that measures to prevent further
deterioration of water quality include the Strategic Sewage
Disposal Scheme (SSDS).
	   The scheme employs a minimum of enhanced primary treatment.
	   But overseas academics attending the conference later said this
type of treatment was not enough.
	   The Agriculture and Fisheries Department (AFD) is considering
the use of chlorophyll-scanning equipment.
	   A senior AFD officer said: ``Such equipment is still at an
experimental stage and we are consulting experts on its use.'' Red
tide monitoring currently takes the form of twice-weekly water
samples from 13 marine stations.
	   The AFD is considering reducing the number of monitoring
stations to five.
	   Prof Wu said swimmers in Hong Kong waters are 1.5 times more
likely to suffer skin and respiratory infections and diarrhoea due
to sewage pollution. And the SSDS may be too little, too late.
	   ``Construction of sewage treatment facilities is unlikely to
catch up with population growth and the problem is likely to be
exacerbated in the coming years,'' he said with regard to the
global situation.
	   He said the way to tackle red tide was to change land use and
farming processes, restore wetlands and remove nutrients from
waters.
	   Nutrients such as nitrogen feed the micro-organisms that cause
red tide.
	   The local trigger-level of water nitrogen content for algal
bloom is estimated at one milligram per litre.
	   A program to reduce 50 per cent of water nutrient level in the
Baltics, which receives waste from 85 million people, cost US$20
billion (HK$156 billion).

	   THE Science, Technology and the Environment Ministry will work
closely with various meteorological agencies to monitor La Nina,
the next likely potentially destructive weather phenomenon.
	   Its minister Datuk Law Hieng Ding said at present, there is no
available information if El Nino, the weather phenomenon which was
the cause of prolonged drought, will be followed by La Nina.
	   ``There is a sign that the El Nino is nearing its end, but
whether or not it will be followed by La Nina, we cannot forecast
yet,'' he said in Kuala Lumpur yesterday after attending the weekly
Cabinet meeting.
	   He added that the World Meteorological Organisation, in a
report, had said El Nino will be followed by La Nina, which is
expected to bring heavy rain and storms.
	   Law assured that various government agencies are prepared to
deal with ``La Nina''. The National Security Division, he said is
on standby and is prepared to tackle not only haze and forest fires
but also floods.
	   On Monday, Deputy Agriculture Minister Datuk Tengku Mahmud
Mansor was reported to have said that agencies like the Drainage
and Irrigation Department have been put on alert to undertake the
necessary preparations in anticipation of La Nina.
	   On the current weather situation, Law said, it is improving and
generally the whole region is free of haze and no hot spots or
smoke haze areas have been detected.
	   The ministry, he added, will continue to monitor the situation
and enforcement of the anti-open burning campaign is on-going.
	   In the two months since the launch of the campaign on April 8,
Law said, 345 cases have been detected and in 69, prosecution is
being undertaken.
	   ``Two cases in Pahang are up for mention on June 17, six cases
in Kelantan are up for mention on June 23 while one case in Malacca
is up for mention on June 15,'' he said.
	   Meanwhile, he said, an indoor air purifier has been installed at
the Puduraya bus terminal. ``It was installed 10 days ago, however,
we have yet to determine its effects. We are in the process of
monitoring how effective it is,'' he said, adding that there may be
some room for modification and improvement.
	   The air purifier was built by a team comprising the Chemistry
Department, Malaysia Electric Corp, Sirim Bhd and the Sunway Group.
The cost to build two units is RM50,000.

	   HUNDREDS of Filipinos in Hong Kong will be missing today's
celebration of their motherland's 100 years of freedom because of
the deadlock in the labour dispute at Philippine Airlines.
	   The celebration in Manila will begin with a nationwide pealing
of church bells at 6am, and a re-enactment of the independence
declaration in Kawit town in Cavite province, outside the capital,
at 4.30pm.
	   Filipino communities all over the world, including Hong Kong,
will raise the national flag and re-enact the declaration of
independence from 333 years of Spanish colonial rule a century ago.
	   As part of the celebration in Hong Kong, a temporary marker will
be unveiled at the site where the first Philippine flag was sewn at
Morrison Hill Road, Wan Chai.
	   Philippine Vice-Consul Raul Hernandez said the strike by the
620-strong PAL pilots' union has affected the celebrations.
	   ``I personally know some people who had to cancel their plans
because all the flights are fully booked,'' he said.
	   He appealed to his countrymen in Hong Kong who missed their
flights to attend the day-long celebrations here.
	   Mr Hernandez also hoped the celebration would encourage
Filipinos working overseas to ``help project a positive image of
the Philippines by being the best Filipinos that they can be''.
	   In a message to the 160,000-strong Filipino community in Hong
Kong, President-elect Joseph Estrada said leading his country to
the 21st century was an ``awesome task''.
	   ``But we are invigorated by the knowledge that the greater
masses of our people are behind us,'' said the ex-movie actor who
beat his closest rival by a wide margin.
	   He said he was hopeful the country would overcome the regional
economic difficulties.
	   Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa will join about 500 other senior
government officials and diplomats in giving a toast during a
reception organised by the Philippine Consulate at Conrad Hotel.
	   A giant Centennial Swatch specially designed by Filipino artist
Fernando Zobel de Ayala will be unveiled at the Bayanihan Kennedy
Town Centre this morning. A Centennial fiesta dinner-dance will cap
the celebrations.
	   Political analysts in Manila say the Philippine's real
independence should be 4 July 1946 when the United States after 50
years of rule gave back freedom to the Filipinos.
	   Mr Hernandez defended the nationwide consensus that the birth of
the nation was on 12 June 1898.
	   ``We did not have full freedom at that time but it was the
beginning of the country's birth as a nation.''

Two bear attacks on Sakhalin Island
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Hunting Department warned residents on
Sakhalin Island to be careful while walking in forests after two
people were mauled by bears.
	   In one incident, a bear mauled a hunter, who was taken to the
intensive care unit of a hospital, the ITAR-Tass news agency said
Friday. Two other hunters killed the bear on the island off
Russia's east coast.
	   Separately, a mother bear with cubs attacked a truck driver who
was walking near a highway, the news agency said.
	   The Hunting Department noted that June and July are mating time
for bears on Sakhalin Island. It said many of the 3,000 brown bears
who live in the island's taiga converge on rivers where salmon, a
favorite food, are spawning.

	   A WOMAN'S taste for expensive watches may make her Hong Kong's
first e-mail thief, the District Court heard yesterday.
	   Florence Cheung Siu-ming, 22, a former employee of Wharf Cable,
allegedly used credit card numbers stolen from various people to
order Rolex and Omega watches via her e-mail account.
	   Cheung is accused of committing the offences between April 1996
and around the same time last year. She was arrested last June,
after police raided her Tin Siu Wai flat.
	   Cheung had been granted bail but yesterday District Court Judge
Richard Hawkes remanded her in custody until the start of the trial
to ensure it began on schedule.
	   Prosecutor Eric Kwok said the trial should begin on time because
the first prosecution witness would be flown from England.
	   Cheung faces four counts of theft and seven of obtaining
property by deception. No pleas were taken.
	   The trial will open on 27 July at the District Court.

	   THE Department of Wildlife and National Parks has been asked to
look into streamlining the management of state and national parks,
said Minister of Science, Technology and the Enviornment Datuk Law
Hieng Ding.
	   Speaking to reporters after the weekly Cabinet meeting in Kuala
Lumpur yesterday, he said the management of national parks in
Sarawak and Sabah is the responsibility of the State Government.
	   However, the protection of wild animals and wild birds and
national parks falls under the legislative authority of both the
Federal and State Governments.
	   Law said the director-general of the Department of Wildlife and
National Parks, Encik Musa Nordin will meet with state department
directors on this matter.
	   ``There is room to streamline and upgrade the management aspects
of national and state parks, including streamlining legislation and
encouraging more research and development of wildlife species,'' he
said.
	   He added that there is a need to ascertain more effective
conservation efforts as well as look into tightening wildlife
protection laws.
	   Law also called for the setting up of more nature parks for the
conservation and protection of wildlife.
	   ``There is a need to step up public education and awareness
programmes on the importance of endangered species,'' he said.
	   On Monday, Law launched the Asia Conservation Awareness
Programme in Kuala Lumpur which aimed at highlighting the plight of
some endangered animals.

Sampras loses in straight sets to Woodforde
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Pete Sampras suffered a setback in his Wimbledon
preparations Friday when he was beaten in straight sets by
Australia's Mark Woodforde at the Queen's Club grass-court
tournament.
	   The top-seeded Sampras, who had a bye in the first round and
beat Wayne Black in the second round, looked flat as he slumped to
a 6-3, 6-2 defeat on his favorite surface.
	   It was the latest surprising loss for Sampras, who was ousted in
the second round of the French Open by little-known Ramon Delgado
of Paraguay.
	   Sampras had beaten the 66th-ranked Woodforde, known primarily as
a doubles specialist, in all of their previous 10 matches and
dropped only two sets in the process.
	   Sampras entered Queens as a tuneup for Wimbledon, a tournament
he has won four times and where he is the defending champion.
	   Sampras declined to speak to the media until after his doubles
match later in the day.
	   Woodforde said players have noticed that Sampras is lacking
motivation this year.
	   ``Everyone is aware that, motivation-wise, he's not there,''
Woodforde said. ``I played a pretty good tight match against him,
and he just wasn't able to pick it up where in the past he was able
to take it up a notch or two. That's where he is found wanting.''
	   Woodforde mixed up his shots, returning well and often catching
Sampras with lobs whenever the American ventured to the net. But
his most effective tactic was to hit a succession of drop volleys
which fell just over the net and left Sampras stranded.
	   The Australian also served far better than Sampras, hitting
three aces in the opening game to set the tone of the match.
	   In contrast, Sampras produced four double-faults, the last of
which gave Woodforde a break for 3-2 in the second set. A netted
backhand voley then gave Woodforde a second break for 5-2.
	   After so many defeats to Sampras, Woodforde was surprised he
finally made his breakthrough on grass.
	   ``I don't know if I 100 percent believed that I could beat
Sampras, especially on grass,'' he said. ``I maybe would have given
myself more of a chance on a different surface. Hard court,
perhaps.''
	   In other matches, fourth-seeded Jonas Bjorkman of Sweden was
surprised 6-3, 4-6, 6-3 by No. 14 Byron Black of Zimbabwe. Another
Swede, No. 8 Thomas Enqvist, advanced with a 6-1, 3-6, 6-2 win over
Jordi Burillo of Spain.
	   American Brian MacPhie, who only got into the tournament as a
lucky loser when Mikael Tillstrom withdrew, reached the
quarterfinals with a 6-3, 6-3 victory over Ivo Heuberger of
Switzerland.
	   In order to clear up a backlog of matches caused by rain delays,
players faced the prospect of playing two matches to get the
tournament back on track.

	   A CRIPPLED taxi driver whose life was ruined because of a
speeding barrister's ``gross negligence'' accepted millions of
dollars in damages yesterday.
	   Justice Conrad Seagroatt said lawyer David Ma Wai-kwan's
reckless driving was to blame for the crash seven years ago that
condemned father-of-two Yau Wai-kan to a wheelchair.
	   After the accident Mr Ma pleaded guilty to careless driving and
was fined $500, although the prosecution facts did not mention Mr
Yau had been hurt at all.
	   ``In my view Mr Ma was extremely fortunate not to have been
arrested for reckless driving.
	   Everything indicates it was a bad case of reckless driving,''
the judge said.
	   Mr Yau, who was seeking $18 million, reached an undisclosed
out-of-court settlement with Mr Ma two days into a trial at the
Court of First Instance.
	   Mr Ma claimed in court the taxi driver was partly to blame for
the crash, alleging both vehicles were switching lanes when the
collision occurred. Mr Yau, and a passenger, told the court Mr Ma
hit him straight from behind while travelling at up to 100kph along
Gloucester Road, Wan Chai.
	   Although the deal meant Mr Justice Seagroatt did not have to
enter judgement, the judge said he wanted to assure Mr Yau that he
accepted his version of events.
	   ``This was a serious motor accident which has ruined a man's
life.
	   ``Mr Yau should not in any way consider he was to blame for this
accident to the slightest extent.
	   ``It was clear . . . that there was gross negligence on the part
of Mr Ma and that was apparent from the outset.'' During the
hearing Mr Justice Seagroatt stopped Mr Yau's lawyer, Nicholas
Pirie, cross-examining Mr Ma over whether he had been drinking
before the accident.
	   Such questioning was irrelevant, he said.
	   ``The negligence was so clear-cut that any explanation for it
did not matter.'' The crash happened in the early hours of 15
November 1991 as Mr Ma was returning from an evening out.
	   The lawyer's BMW struck the back of the taxi, which spun around
twice and ended up facing the opposite direction.
	   Mr Yau, 47, suffered a severed spinal cord and was left
tetraplegic. Confined to a wheelchair he suffers frequent tremors
in his legs and is unable to control his bowels.
	   His condition was made worse because of the cramped
350-square-foot flat he shared with his wife and two children.
	   He later contracted tuberculosis, and consequently, moved to a
new flat with a balcony.
	   Earlier this year Mr Ma was acquitted of conspiracy to pervert
the course of justice after a judge ordered the jury to return not
guilty verdicts because of insufficient evidence.

	   THE Malaysian Islamic Chamber of Commerce (DPIM), which has
already formed a tie-up with its counterpart in Sudan, is now
looking at establishing some form of cooperation with chambers in
Iran and Turkey.
	   The chamber plans to set up cooperation with their counterparts
in Iran and Turkey before the end of the year and move on to Europe
and China next year, its council member and Entrepreneur
Development Bureau chairman Zainuddin Mohd Tahir said yesterday.
	   The tie-ups will provide its members with opportunities for
joint- ventures and investments in these countries, he told a press
conference in Kuala Lumpur yesterday.
	   The Chamber had signed a memorandum of understanding with the
Sudan Businessmen and Employers Federation during Prime Minister
Datuk Seri Dr Mahathir Mohamad's official visit to the North
African country last month.
	   Zainuddin said Sudan was chosen because it was not only an
Islamic country but also its political stability does not pose as a
hindrance to foreign investments.
	   The Chamber's members have expressed interested in the Sudanese
telecommunications, transportation, power generation, food
production, livestock and tourism industries.

	   JERRY Lui Kin-hong's conviction was the latest twist in a saga
of death and intrigue that was unravelled after graftbusters began
probing an alleged multi-billion dollar cigarette smuggling
syndicate in the early 1990s.
	   Most of the developments surrounded a series of statements made
by Tommy Chui To-yan, a former shareholder of Giant Island, to whom
Lui ensured cigarettes was supplied in return for bribes.
	   Chui confessed to smuggling and made detailed allegations
against associates at Giant Island and named Lui as a corrupt
partner in crime.
	   But Chui, who was to be a witness for the Independent Commission
Against Corruption, was found dead in Singapore in April 1995,
allegedly killed by a triad hit squad.
	   His statements could no longer be used as evidence, but
investigations continued.
	   Henfrey Tin Sau-kwong, a former customs officer turned Giant
Island director, was later jailed for six-and-a-half years for
conspiracy to pervert the course of justice by ``preventing'' Chui
being a witness in the case.
	   Lui was convicted of conspiring with Chui and three other former
or current Giant Island shareholders _ Chen Ying-jen, Hung Wing-wah
and Chong Tsoi-jun.
	   Chong, who had cigarette smuggling charges against him dropped
after Chui's death, was later charged with Hong Kong's biggest
alleged tax evasion, involving more than $50 million. But, confined
to a wheelchair, Chong leaped to his death before the trial began.

	   HUMAN Resources Minister Datuk Lim Ah Lek yesterday refuted all
the allegations made by Malaysian Trades Union Congress (MTUC)
secretary- general G. Rajasegaran at a press conference at the MTUC
headquarters last week.
	   Rajasegaran had alleged that Lim had taken the leaders of the
Metal Industry Employees Union (MIEU) to task for not taking up the
Carnaud Metal Box Sdn Bhd workers' cause. Lim said this is a
serious allegation and that he was not involved in the negotiations
on the compensation for workers who had accepted the voluntary
retrenchment scheme by Carnaud Metal Box.
	   ``This is very serious and he (Rajasegaran) has accused me of
negotiating on behalf of the workers,'' he said, adding, ``I've
never done that''.
	   ``The issue is that the workers were being discriminated against
(in the Carnaud Metal Box case) as their leader, Mr Jacob
Engkatesoo, received more compensation compared with the rest of
the workers who had accepted the retrenchment scheme,'' Lim told a
news conference before the ministry's post-Cabinet meeting in Kuala
Lumpur yesterday.
	   In 1996, 69 workers of Carnaud Metal Box accepted the voluntary
retrenchment scheme from their employer, after they were
represented by Rajasegaran, who was MIEU executive secretary and
Engkatesoo, the secretary-general, in negotiations with the
employer.
	   These retrenched workers then took up the matter with the
minister after they discovered that Engkatesoo had received an
ex-gratia payment of RM425,000 in addition to the compensation.
	   Lim said that after he had met with the employer and was
convinced that the workers were being discriminated against, he had
referred the matter to the Industrial Court, which had directed
Carnaud Metal Box to pay RM1.4 million to the workers.
	   Lim also responded to other allegations by Rajasegaran in a
statement that the MTUC secretary-general had released to the media
at last week's news conference.
	   Among the allegations were that the then Labour Minister's
failure to make a recognition order of the Penang Textile Workers'
Union in 1987 although a majority of 65.9 per cent of workers were
in favour of it.
	   The company, Terry Prai Sdn Bhd had instead supported an
in-house union with the production manager as the president,
claimed Rajasegaran.
	   Lim said the ministry's records showed that the Labour Minister
at that time had given a directive to the company to recognise the
union starting August 5 1987 and as such, it was a non-issue.
	   On Terry Prai's in-house union, Lim said records at the
ministry's Trade Unions Department showed that the department had
not received any application to form the in-house union at Terry
Prai.
	   Rajasegaran also alleged that Lim had accused a particular MTUC
leader of being responsible for the picketing of Thomson Audio
employees in September 1996.
	   Lim said in his discussions with the union representing Thomson
Audio workers, he was informed that the union had been advised by
an MTUC leader to picket.
	   Rajasegaran had also claimed that the minister had not replied
to his letter on September 3 1996 where he had asked Lim to point
out the information in the MTUC reports to the International Labour
Organisation (ILO) that the minister had described as lies.
	   In response to this, Lim said he had called the MTUC and the
Malaysian Employers' Federation (MEF) for a meeting on October 11
and 22 1996.
	   He said the Human Resources Ministry had found that some of the
MTUC's responses to the ILO's questionnaires did not reflect the
true picture of the labour scenario in the country and there was
distortion of facts.
	   ``During the meeting, MTUC representatives did not refute or
question the Government's and employers' views on MTUC's response
to the ILO questionnaires.
	   ``The tripartite meeting had agreed that all replies to
international questionaires will not be submitted separately and
will be discussed by the three parties first.
	   ``It had also agreed that all statements given to outsiders
should not smear the country's image and all doubts on laws and
government policies should be referred to the Human Resources
Minister,'' the minister said.
	   In the news conference which lasted about one -and a half-hours,
reporters were also shown the video of Rajasegaran making
statements on the country's labour relations and tripartite system
at a seminar in Washington DC on May 14 and 16, 1996.
	   Lim said the Government is not stopping Rajasegaran from
speaking on the workers' welfare but that the union leader has to
make sure his facts are right.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Thurs. - A French couple waited more than 13 years
for their boat to be built, and tired of waiting any longer, sued
the builder for the return of the partly-built vessel.
	   The Kuala Terregganu High Court, on Dec 14, 1994, dismissed
their suit, ruling that it could not order specific performance
against the builder, who had died in 1996.
	   It held that the couple, Claude Besnard and Annie Beulin, could,
if they wanted, sue for damages.
	   Unhappy with the decision, they appealed and their matter was
fixed for hearing before the Court of Appeal today.
	   The couple's counsel Abdul Rahman Abdullah said his clients were
not asking for specific performance, but only wanted the boat,
``which is lying there'', to be returned to them.
	   Judge Datuk N.H. Chan said this was not in the couple's
affidavit and moreover the respondent, Ali Ngah, had since died.
	   He fixed the case for mention on July 27.
	   The couple's affidavit stated that they commissioned Ali to
built the boat in 1980 and gave him RM43,500 worth of materials.
Ali promised delivery within eight months.
	   Ali's son Abdul Manan was in the court today.

	   THE Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) yesterday increased
transparency in its foreign exchange transactions in a bid to
minimise sharp rises in interest rates arising from tight liquidity
in the financial markets as well as future speculative attacks on
the Hong Kong dollar.
	   Effective immediately, the monetary authority will disclose its
two-day forecast for the level of change in the aggregate balance
attributable to the HKMA's foreign exchange transactions involving
the Hong Kong dollar.
	   The information on HKMA's two-day forecast on its aggregate
balance will be displayed on a new electronic page of the
widely-used Reuters financial service.
	   The forecast will enable banks to anticipate the changes in the
liquidity conditions in the interbank market, enhance the
transparency of Hong Kong's linked exchange rate system, and
facilitate a more efficient adjustment in the interbank interest
rates, HKMA chief executive Joseph Yam said yesterday.
	   ``More information can improve the efficiency of the market and
make it more effective. It will also make it more difficult for
currency speculators to attack the Hong Kong dollar,'' Mr Yam said.
	   He said there had been no speculative attack on the Hong Kong
dollar in recent days.
	   ``I do not feel that there was any speculative element and it
seems like (US dollar) demand was genuine,'' Mr Yam said.
	   Standard Chartered Bank regional treasurer Stanley Y F Wong
yesterday said the financial markets, particularly banks, will have
more time to prepare for possible shortages in liquidity with the
two-day forecast in the level of change in the aggregate balance of
the HKMA's forex transactions involving Hong Kong dollars.
	   ``This will minimise sudden sharp rises in interest rates in the
interbank market arising from unexpected shortages in liquidity on
a particular day,'' Mr Wong said.
	   Yesterday's forecast, for example, indicates that the aggregate
balance will stand at a negative level of $0.4 billion in two days.
This will give banks more time to shore up their positions in view
of the expected balance, the HKMA said.
	   Bank treasurers and analysts said the HKMA's new disclosure is
intended to bolster the strength of the Hong Kong dollar by
increasing transparency in the financial system.
	   The Hong Kong dollar, which is pegged to the US dollar at the
rate of 7.8, is currently being buffeted by intense pressure
arising from the continuing depreciation of the yen and rampant
rumours about the possible devaluation of the yuan.
	   Mr Yam also said the HKMA may consider using its US$96.2 billion
(HK$750 billion) in forex reserves to bolster the slumping yen.

Albanians happy with NATO decision on show of force
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With NATO-Kosovo &QL; 
 &UR; By JEFFREY ULBRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - Albanian Defense Minister Luan
Hajdaraga said Friday he was delighted with NATO's decision to make
a show of force in the Balkans because it is clear Yugoslavia wants
to dominate Kosovo militarily.
	   The minister, here for a meeting between NATO and 27 partner
countries in the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council, spoke a day
after the alliance decided to conduct immediate air exercises over
Albania and Macedonia as a way of pressuring Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic.
	   That show of power, expected sometime next week, was one of
several steps taken by the 16-nation North Atlantic Treaty
Organization to persuade Milosevic to stop his offensive against
ethnic Albanians in the the southern province of Kosovo, where they
are in a large majority.
	   ``We are very pleased about the decision taken by the NATO
Council yesterday,'' Hajdaraga said in an interview.
	   ``The stand of Milosevic in the Kosovo crisis is very clear, it
is to dominate the situation by military means.'' The danger is, he
said, that ``those means can spread to Albania.''
	   Under the measures taken by defense ministers Thursday, NATO
will conduct simulated air attacks over Albania and Macedonia and
study options for further action ranging from accelerated planning
for military exercises to direct air strikes inside Yugoslavia and
use of ground troops.
	   This is aimed at persuading Milosevic to declare a cease-fire in
Kosovo, withdraw his forces and end the repression of the ethnic
Albanians and open serious negotiations with the opposition.
	   Hajdaraga said Albania understood the gravity of the situation
and noted with pleasure that all of the countries here agreed with
the decision.
	   Like his colleagues in NATO, Hajdaraga hoped a diplomatic
solution could be found to the crisis in Kosovo, where many among
the majority ethnic Albanians support independence.
	   ``In case the political solution and diplomatic means will fail,
maybe the military solution will be the right means.''
	   Two major problems face Albania, he said.
	   ``The first is the fighting raging near our borders and the
second is the refugees coming to Albania. The number of the
refugees settling in northern Albania is about 15,000. There is a
problem for us to support them, to house them, and to fulfill their
needs.''

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Thurs. - A housewife told the Sessions Court today
that she had to seek the assistance of a motorist to send her niece
to hospital after the girl had been knocked down by another
motorist.
	   Koo May Chan, 33, said she stopped a car that was leaving the
Taman Maluri Jaya Jusco carpark for help to send Chiew Yuen Kee,
two, to hospital.
	   She said her own daughter Chin Sim Yee, who was also knocked
down was sent to a clinic by her sister-in-law's friend.
	   May Chan was giving evidence at the trial of businessman Teh
Chuan Ann, 40, who is charged with attempting to commit culpable
homicide not amounting to murder of Koo Mei Fong, Chiew and Chin.
	   Teh, of Taman Tenaga, Cheras, is alleged to have committed the
offence about 7.30pm on Jan 25 at the Jaya Jusco supermarket
carpark.
	   He also claimed trial to two charges of committing mischief by
causing damage of more than RM25 to the vehicles owned by Lau Kiat
Kean and Liong Mun Kong at the same place and time.
	   Teh is represented by S.T. Ravindran and Alvin Loo while Deputy
Public Prosecutor Noor Ruwena Mohd Nurdin is prosecuting.
	   She said when Chin returned from the clinic she saw that she
(Chin) had injuries on both her legs and was complaining of pain.
	   May Chan said during an argument between Teh and her sister Mei
Fong over a parking lot, she saw a woman and two children sitting
in his car.
	   She said after the argument, Teh got into his car and after the
occupants got out, he drove the car into Mei Fong and the children.
Two other cars in the parking lot were also damaged.
	   Hearing before judge Lim Yee Lan was adjourned to Aug 20.

	   THE Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate (Hibor) soared again
yesterday to its highest level since January as the yen dived for a
fourth straight day.
	   Dealers said the one-month interbank rate reached a peak of 15
per cent in the morning.
	   The surge was partly driven by the sustained weakness in the
yen.
	   But there were rumours that the Hong Kong Monetary Authority
(HKMA) had pumped two-month and three-month funds into the market,
sending the one-month interbank rate down to 8 per cent in the
morning session, dealers said.
	   The benchmark three-month Hibor shot up to 12.09821 per cent
yesterday from 9.57143 per cent on Wednesday.
	   The one-month Hibor ended at 12.94643 per cent against 9.38839
per cent on Wednesday.
	   There were also rumours that some major players were lending
Hong Kong dollars in the interbank market given the attractive
Hibor rates.
	   ``Those major market players may be speculators,'' said Carlos
Cheung, spot market head at Bank of East Asia.
	   Mr Cheung said regional currencies were unlikely to recover by
the end of the year, which would exert pressure on the Hong Kong
dollar.
	   Traders expect interbank rates will trend further upwards today
with continuing tight liquidity in the market.
	   But one money market analyst at an US bank said tight liquidity
would make banks utilise their funds more efficiently.

	   WHILE demand for crude and clean oil product is rising, the
tonnage availability is expected to shrink due to the age profile
of existing tanker fleet.
	   GMV Ship Management Sdn Bhd general manager Captain Johari Mohd
Noh said the forecast development of tanker demand and supply
suggests that the balance between the two will narrow and that
there will be a marked tightening in the availability of tonnage
given the age profile of existing fleet and the existing order book
and yard availability.
	   ``Over 35 per cent of the existing fleet is over 20 years old
while 13 per cent is over 15 years, whereas order book for
deliveries up to the year 2000 amounts to only 15.5 per cent of the
fleet,'' he said in his paper entitled ``Liquid Bulk Trade:
Opportunities and Challenges'', which was presented at the Fourth
Biennial International Conference in Subang Jaya yesterday.
	   ``In theory, with many vessels having reached the age of 20 and
assuming that the vessels age shall not exceed 25, there will be a
need for replacement of a large number of vessels in the near
future,'' he said.
	   Johari also said the consumption of world major oils is set to
increase from 76.85 million tonnes in 1997 to 161.12 million tonnes
in 2020, an increase of about 100 per cent.
	   ``Palm oil is expected to have the largest increase by 27.88
million tonnes or about 100 per cent, followed by rapeseed oil by
21.12 million tonnes.
	   ``For this reason, Malaysia and its Asean neighbours are set to
be a major source of vegetable oil exports within the next
decade,'' he said.
	   However, he added, the El Nino phenomenon that has affected our
area lately (haze, drought and water shortage) is expected to
affect negatively on the production, and hence, the trade growth.
	   ``Nonetheless, this shortfall is expected to be offset by the
expanding export based production within Latin America and
South-East Asia over the medium- and long-term. Overall, shipping
demand is set to rise,'' he said.
	   On the Very Large Crude Carrier (VLCC) market, Johari said it
has improved tremendously over the last one year based on
increasing time charter earnings.
	   ``The Aframax size market has also stabilised over the years,
but is currently being adversely affected by the Asian economic
turmoil.
	   ``The clean petroleum market also has strong fundamentals, but
similar to Aframax, current earning is poor due to the Asian
economic problem. Demand has substantially reduced, at least for
the time being,'' he said.
	   Johari said Asian refiners, however, are expected to boost
production and export in order to generate additional revenue, but
this will be at the expense of lowering the import from Arabian
Gulf.
	   He added that the parcel tanker trade is also being adversely
affected, partly by over tonnage and partly by the lower demand due
to the Asian economic crisis.
	   ``Owners who have placed substantial orders for new vessels for
deliveries in 1996 and 1997 have found difficulties in employing
the vessels in the spot market,'' he said.
	   At the same time, chemicals production have slacken while the
number of production plants planned in South-East Asia has been
shelved, thus multiplying the effect of excess tonnage over demand.
	   Shipowners' problems, however, are not limited to the falling
demand and the excess tonnage only, but they are also exposed to
the increasing ship operating cost, including increase regulations.
This has an adverse effect on the earnings of tankers.
	   Nonetheless, Johari said the outlook of the tanker market in the
long run is still good. ``In my opinion, the current Asian economic
crisis is just an economic correction given its past continuous
high growth over a long period.
	   ``Once recovered, the economy will become more matured and
stronger. The tanker owners who are currently suffering from
depressed tanker market condition, would then be able to breathe
again,'' he said.

	   LONDON (AP) _ The world's leading industrial nations, acting on
a U.S. proposal, decided Friday to deny loans to India and Pakistan
in retaliation for their nuclear tests.
	   Loans for humanitarian purposes would be excluded from the
boycott, the foreign ministers meeting to discuss the nuclear
crisis in South Asia decided.
	   A communique approved by the eight countries _ the United
States, Britain, France, Germany, Japan, Canada, Italy and Russia _
also urged India and Pakistan to halt their testing programs and
not to deploy nuclear weapons on their missiles.
	   Additionally, they were urged to deal with the ``root causes''
of tensions between them, especially over Kashmir, the mostly
Muslim enclave that straddles their border.
	   The joint steps were taken as India and Pakistan moved to hold
negotiations later in the month, a step welcomed by the U.S.
officials.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright urged the other
nations to refrain from nuclear cooperation with India and
Pakistan.
	   ``Our meeting sends the message that the world community is
united not just in outrage and dismay but in action,'' Albright
said, referring to nuclear weapons tests conducted last month by
the two countries.
	   By choosing to test, India and Pakistan have diminished their
security and damaged their prestige, Albright said at a meeting
with the foreign ministers of Britain, Germany, Russia, Italy,
Japan, France and Canada.

	   PETALING JAYA, Thurs. - The Federation of Malaysian Consumers'
Associations today expressed surprise and disappointment over the
statement by Datuk Abu Hassan Omar yesterday alleging that Fomca
and the Selangor Consumers' Association had politicised the water
crisis to confuse the people and to gain popularity.
	   Fomca president Prof Mohd Hamdan Adnan was speaking at a Press
conference at the Fomca building.
	   The Selangor Menteri Besar had accused Fomca and the SCA of
being more interested in politicising the water crisis rather than
working with the authorities to help consumers.
	   He had urged the Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry
and the Registrar of Societies to review the status of both
associations as he felt their recent actions were similar to that
of political parties.
	   The basis for his accusations stemmed from a report quoting the
SCA legal advisor A. Jayaseelan as saying that the association
planned to sue the Selangor State Government and the Menteri Besar
for allegedly being negligent in managing water resources.
	   ``Fomca has no political agenda behind its actions. We are
merely voicing the grievances of the people affected by the water
crisis,'' Hamdan said.
	   ``As a responsible consumer association, it is our duty to act
as a conduit between the public and the parties involved in the
water management. Therefore we are dumbfounded that the Government
is questioning our motives when it should be working alongside us
to help the public. Instead it seems to be hindering our efforts.''
	   Hamdan said that Fomca received hundreds of complaints each day.
	   ``It is obvious to us that the actions of the State Goverment
and the Selangor Water Authority lack transparency,'' he said.
	   Also present at the Press conference was Fomca
director-cum-legal advisor T. Indrani who confirmed reports
yesterday that two suits were being filed, one against the State
Government and the Menteri Besar, and another against Kuala Lumpur
City Hall and the police for withdrawing Fomca's permit to hold a
forum on the water crisis at Bandar Tun Razak Sports Complex.
	   Indrani also clarified that the suit against KL City Hall and
the police is being filed by the SCA.
	   ``It will be filed at the end of the month seeking about RM5,000
compensation. This was the amount spent on venue rental and the
printing of 50,000 announcement flyers among other expenses.''
	   She said the second suit, against the State Government and the
Menteri Besar for negligence would be filed by individuals because
under Malaysian law ``there is no provision for class action by a
group of people under one name against an institution or
individual.''

	   THE commercial environment in which today's ship managers and
seafarers operate has changed, becoming highly competitive,
extremely cost-conscious and completely international in nature.
	   This has affected the relativities between quantity, quality and
costs of seafarers as ship managers engage in a delicate balancing
act to remain commercially competitive.
	   Mr Barrie Lewarn, a director at the Faculty of Maritime
Transport and Engineering, Australian Maritime College, said this
in his paper entitled ``Training and Manpower Planning for the
Maritime Industry''.
	   The paper was presented at the IKMAL 4th Biennial International
Maritime Conference in Subang Jaya.
	   ``With the internationalisation of shipping it is considerably
harder for ship managers to consistently match supply and demand,''
he said.
	   A global marketplace for seafarers has provided an environment
where job mobility is both easy and becoming the norm. As such,
many ship managers have established their own training schemes to
engender loyalty among seafarer employees.
	   ``A greater commitment by ship management organisations to
quality training is one way which will assist them to maintain the
quantity of seafarers required by their organisations.''
	   On the quality of seafaring personnel, Lewarn said the
internationalisation of shipping has caused the quality, reputation
and confidence in the certificates of competency issued by some
countries to become highly questionable.
	   ``Internationalisation has allowed the less ethical operator to
exploit the world market for seafarers with little regard to the
quality of those seafarers... as a result, the first response of
concerned governments was to develop the International Convention
on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for
Seafarers, 1978 (STCW 78) through the auspices of the International
Maritime Consultative Organisation (IMCO).''
	   However, because further concerted international action was
needed, STCW 95 was set up to raise the level of competence of
seafarers and those responsible for training.
	   ``STCW is the international community's approach to improving
the quality and professionalism of seafarers, employers, trainers
and marine administrators and has great potential to enhance the
safe and efficient operation of ships.''
	   As for costs, he said, the main challenge faced by employers in
the international market is finding the correct balance between
costs and competency.
	   ``The lift in standards projected by STCW 95 will almost
inevitably increase the costs of employing seafarers. If this also
drives less reputable certificates of competency from the seas,
then the cost will be offset by the benefits,'' he said.
	   He added that while costs are important, quality and competence
are also important, and it is the balance between these two issues
that provides a challenge for the reputable ship-operating
employer.
	   On the certificate of competency, Lewarn said because the skills
are not uniform around the world, the certificate is not a uniform
measure of competence.
	   He also said from the point of view of maritime education and
training institutions, the STCW 95 and ISM Code are global issues
of regional relevance.
	   Maritime Education and Training (MET) institutions have a role
to play in promoting quality and safety, he added.
	   ``In simple terms, MET must seek to achieve quality staff,
quality equipment, facilities, programmes and graduates.
	   ``STCW 95 and the ISM Code are not a panacea for some of the
current problems. In the final analysis, managers must not, and in
many countries, cannot abrogate their responsibilities. It is in
the interest of everyone to act professionally and strive for
quality,'' he said.

	   ESTIMATES by Price Waterhouse, the provisional liquidator for
Peregrine Fixed Income, suggest creditors of the unit of the failed
investment bank could be repaid as little as 19 per cent of their
money.
	   In a worst-case scenario, it was possible the sale of assets
would realise no more than US$2.41 billion (HK$18.80 billion),
Price Waterhouse said.
	   It estimated that between 19 per cent and 52 per cent of the
Peregrine unit's debts could be recovered, depending on how much
could be raised by selling the bonds and derivatives still in the
unit's hands.
	   Peregrine Fixed Income was one of the world's biggest junk bond
trading houses before the Peregrine group collapsed when Indonesian
firms defaulted on loan repayments. Not surprisingly, US$1.091
billion in Peregrine Fixed Income's bond and derivative assets, or
52.4 per cent of US$2.079 billion total assets before provisions,
is in Indonesia.
	   Price Waterhouse partner Ted Osborn told a creditors meeting
yesterday that the portfolio was being divided into a ``good book''
and a ``bad book''.
	   The bad book is for debt that is unlikely to be repaid.
	   ``Roughly three-quarters is in the bad book,'' he said. ``And a
substantial portion is in Indonesia.'' Simon Copley, another Price
Waterhouse partner, said an independent consultant was called in
when the provisional liquidator couldn't decide what to do with
Peregrine Fixed Income's portfolio.
	   ``Independent advice confirmed that we couldn't sell or manage
the portfolio because of its very high credit risk and a lack of
liquidity, we couldn't even hedge,'' he said.
	   ``We couldn't sell and we couldn't manage, it was a traders'
worst nightmare.'' Mr Osborn said the ``majority'' of the bonds _
and almost all the derivatives _ were in default.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Thurs. - The four companies given the concession
to manage solid waste disposal in the country have until December
to take over from the local authorities.
	   Housing and Local Government Minister Datuk Dr Ting Chew Peh
said today it was imperative for the four to speed up the signing
of the interim agreement with over 90 local authorities for the
takeover.
	   Ting said the interim agreement would be in force until the
Government finalised the concession deal with the four companies,
and the proposed Solid Waste Management and Cleansing Bill was
tabled.
	   ``I don't want to speculate ... By December, the concessionaires
will sign the interim agreement with the local authorities,'' he
said when asked what action would likely be imposed on the
concessionaires which failed to comply with the directive.
	   Ting spoke to reporters after witnessing the signing of a
distributorship agreement between Acetai Corporation Sdn Bhd and
Japan's Meiji Milk Products Co Ltd.
	   The four concessionaires are DRB-Hicom Group's subsidiary Alam
Flora Sdn Bhd, Northern Waste Industries, Southern Waste Management
Sdn Bhd and MMC Engineering.
	   Southern Waste Management is to manage solid waste disposal in
Malacca, Negri Sembilan and Johor, while Alam Flora is responsible
for the central region comprising Kelantan, Trengganu, Pahang,
Selangor and Kuala Lumpur.
	   The northern region comprising Penang, Perak, Perlis and Kedah
would be managed by Northern Waste Industries and MMC Engineering
would manage the task in Sabah, Sarawak and Labuan.
	   ``Besides the takeover process, the Housing and Local Government
Ministry will also monitor the quality of services provided by the
concessionaires.''
	   On the number of local authorities who have signed the interim
agreement with the concessionaires, he said so far Alam Flora had
taken over solid waste management from Kuala Lumpur City Hall while
Southern Waste was now managing solid waste for the Johor Baru City
Council and Johor Baru Central District Council.
	   ``Alam Flora is now in the midst of taking over solid waste
management from the local authorities of Petaling Jaya and Kajang
while Northern Waste is discussing with Ipoh Municipal Council,''
he said.

	   THE Port of Singapore Authority (PSA) has taken a number of
steps to combat the possible adverse effects of the Millennium Bug
problem.
	   Dr Robert Chin, head of the IT Infrastructure department at PSA
Corporation, said the port's 14 million TEUs (twenty-foot
equivalent units) handled in 1997 were highly dependent on
extensive use of sophisticated IT, and therefore vulnerable.
	   The port's operations and customer links are highly computerised
and supported by sophisticated equipment control systems.
	   However, he said, the PSA had to be concerned about systems
outside its control, including those of customers, suppliers,
public utilities, government and trade agencies, other port's and
ship's navigation.
	   Accordingly, PSA had set up a high level committee, supported by
task forces and technical testing procedures. On the IT front, they
had been downsizing systems since 1984 and were phasing out legacy
systems.
	   Despite resource problems and the readiness of others, Dr Chin
said the PSA was on track to verify all engineering systems by
mid-1999, had all IT systems fully tested within the same period
and instal comprehensive corporate wide contingency planning.
	   Dr Chin was speaking at a ``Year 2000: Challenges in the
Shipping and Transport Industry'' conference in Singapore on June
9.
	   Speaking at the same conference, its chairman Robin Guenier said
the inability of most current computing systems and microprocessor
chips to cope with the transition from 1999-2000 could threaten
business survival and the provision of basic services, with
incalculable social and political consequences.
	   Guenier, one of the world's leading experts in the century date
change, warned business and political leaders that only they could
determine priorities, provide resources and get things done.
	   ``Yet a recent survey in the UK indicated that only about 28 per
cent of the anticipated cost of a comprehensive solution had been
incurred, although most major systems had to be fixed before the
end of 1998.
	   ``The survey also suggested that the position was generally
worse in the world as a whole,'' he said.
	   Geunier felt that many found the whole phenomenon almost
impossible to believe. Businesses were very wary of the huge costs
involved while some in the computer industry found the subject
rather dull and were reluctant to become involved in implementing
solutions.
	   In tackling on board operations, Captain Phil Davies of Chevron
Shipping stressed the importance of a structured approach and
demonstrated the way his company had gone about the work.
	   In striving for compliance, he said Chevron emphasised the vital
importance of close liaison with manufacturers and those in the
supply chain, particularly customers and port authorities.
	   A worldwide airfreight and seafreight business, operating from
270 sites in 60 countries, had to pay particular attention to the
supply chain, according to Markus Heyer, a director of Panalpina.
	   Presenting the forwarders' perspective, Heyer said his company's
activities were conditioned by suppliers, third party logistics,
manufacturers, carriers, warehouses and Customs authorities.
	   This meant that awareness, dialogue and cooperation were vital
if forwarding businesses were to survive and prosper.
	   The legal aspects of the millennium problem were covered by
Steven Hazelwood, of Ince &AMP; Co in Singapore, who said that failure
to achieve compliance rendered operators of ships and shore
installations and manufacturers more vulnerable to claims and
attempts to exclude or limit liability.
	   ``It is essential to exercise due diligence under the Hague and
Hague- Visby Rules,'' he said. He noted there were implications for
contractual rights and tortious liability, limitation of liability
and the effects on insurance, ship finance, sale and purchase and
new buildings.

	   THE Registry of Companies (ROC) will be conducting on-going
checks on both private and public companies which have terminated
the services of their auditors before their appointment periods
expire and hire new ones to replace them.
	   The checks, said registrar Datuk Ramly Ali, is to ensure that
these terminations were carried out sincerely to protect the
companies' interests and in accordance with the law.
	   If this is violated by any company, legal action such as taking
the company or its directors to court will be carried out, he said
in a press statement released yesterday.
	   It has been known, said Ramly, that some companies have
terminated the services of their auditors before the expiry of
their appointment periods when the auditors have questioned the
validity of their accounts and given ``qualified opinions'' on the
accounts.
	   The ROC has advised all companies that they must let their
auditors do their jobs in a professional manner to ensure that the
public and investors' confidence in their companies are maintained.
	   This is in line with the concept of transparency and good
corporate governance, Ramly said.
	   He said that in difficult times like this, most companies are
facing financial liquidity problems, and in such a scenerio, some
auditors have questioned the validity of some financial
transactions and asset assessments undertaken by the companies.
	   There are cases where the auditors could not validate some
suspicious transactions worth millions of ringgit.
	   ``These auditors then make a report to the ROC based on Section
174 (8) of the Companies Act 1965, and consequently the directors
of the company concerned may have not been pleased with the report,
thus they fire the auditors,'' he said.
	   Ramly said such termination can only be done in accordance with
the procedure stipulated under Section 172 (4)-(12) of the
Companies Act 1965.
	   Under this section, an auditor can only be fired or terminated
through a resolution passed by not less than a three-quarter
majority vote by the shareholders at the company's annual general
meeting or extraordinary general meeting.
	   The notice for the termination must also be forwarded to the
auditors concerned and to the ROC.
	   The concerned auditors also have the right to be heard and make
a written representation to be distributed to all shareholders and
be tabled at the meeting.
	   Failure to do this will result in the termination of the
auditors to be regarded as not lawfully valid, and the directors
responsible can be fined up to RM5,000.

	   THE consultation paper on the compensation scheme for clients of
collapsed brokerages will be issued this September, Securities and
Futures Commission (SFC) executive director David White says.
	   ``We are now studying different compensation- insurance schemes
to see how we can come up with a better one in Hong Kong,'' Mr
White said yesterday.
	   The recent failure of various brokerages, including C A Pacific
Securities, had prompted the commission to develop a long-term
scheme to compensate clients of collapsed brokerages.
	   ``We are aiming at a compensation scheme that is much better
than the current one,'' Mr White said.
	   He said the problem of whether margin account clients should be
included in the compensation scheme would be tackled after the
consultation period.
	   Mr White also dismissed suggestions that a ``super regulator''
should be formed in Hong Kong over the next five years. There have
been recent suggestions that the two existing industry watchdogs,
the SFC and the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong, should be merged to
oversee all regulatory matters.
	   But despite the success of establishing super regulators in
other countries, Mr White said the situation in Hong Kong was
different from those prevailing in other countries.
	   He added the SFC had made substantial progress in its work in
previous years.
	   ``We have increased the number of cases that we've handled.'' He
also raised concerns about the various risks facing Asia this year,
such as the political atmosphere in Indonesia, prospects of a yuan
devaluation and the slump of the yen and its corresponding impact
on the region.

	   THE increase in the price of rice has caused many angry words to
be spoken recently. Having learnt, perhaps, from the recent sugar
and water problems, the authorities have done fairly well in coming
out quickly to cool rising tempers and make a few things clear.
Firstly, it does seem as if the Federation of the Malaysia Consumer
Associations (Fomca) owes Padiberas Nasional Bhd (Bernas) an
apology for accusing Bernas of being the cause of the price
increase. Secondly, price increases can come about as a result of
profiteering and not necessarily as a result of the economic
problems facing the nation. And thirdly, the country needs a more
permanent solution to the rice problem.
	   Bernas managing-director Mohd Ibrahim Mohd Nor on Monday
dismissed Fomca's allegations than the company was to be blamed for
rice that has become dearer in recent weeks. As a ``small
supplier'' - Bernas supplies about 18 per cent of the rice in the
domestic market - it's role in the price structure is minimal. In
Ibrahim's own words, ``We can't shake the market''. Wagging a
finger at Fomca, Bernas at the same time pointed its finger at rice
wholesalers and retailers, who might have taken advantage of the
situation to push prices. Poor harvests worldwide due to the
current weather phenomenon has also been identified as the case for
the price increase. Since early last month, prices of home-grown
rice has gone up by 21 per cent while that of imported varieties
are now 52 per cent more expensive.
	   The Agriculture Ministry came out quickly to announce that an
investigation into these allegations will be conducted. Its
minister, Datuk Amar Dr Sulaiman Daud, seems to share Bernas' view
that profiteering could be the main factor behind the rice price
rise. He said when Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Datuk
Seri Anwar Ibrahim announced last December the price increase for
padi, Anwar specifically stated that it would not result in an
increase in the retail price of rice. These are very reassuring
points, indeed, and millions of rice-eaters in this country would
want to know who has been trying to make money out of their misery
and their already diminishing purchasing power. Punishing the
culprits would seem to be quite important, as the Government would
certainly not want a repeat of the sugar issue to depress consumer
sentiment further.
	   Getting to the bottom of the issue, however, will require the
authorities to go well beyond finding and punishing the profiteers.
The ministry, together with Bernas and other industry players,
needs to look at the long-term issues facing the rice industry.
This is a good time to debate once more the merits of
self-sufficiency. Currently, Malaysia imports 65 per cent of its
rice requirements from Thailand, Vietnam, India, Pakistan and
Taiwan, valued at RM700 million a year. This includes 2,000 tonnes
of Japanese rice from the US. Such figures could easily surpass RM1
billion by the year 2000 if steps are not taken to improve local
rice production.
	   If self-sufficiency is not possible or critical, the options
available must be studied carefully and implemented as soon as
possible. One is to encourage Bernas to start massive rice
cultivation projects abroad and import the rice into the country.
The immediate disadvantage of this is that while the imported rice
from Bernas' own fields overseas would be cheaper than other
imports, the nation will be moving even farther away from
self-sufficiency. Production and supply would also be vulnerable to
external factors that Malaysia would have very little control over.
	   Another option is to make rice an item of barter trade that
could also help reduce the overall import bill for food.
	   The most basic of the actions that the authorities must take is,
of course, to ensure that the enforcement division carries out its
tasks without fail. Certain rice grades, for example, are
controlled items. With very efficient enforcement, a problem can be
addressed before it becomes an issue.

	   CLEAR ENOUGH? ... With the opening of the RM9 billion Kuala
Lumpur International Airport in Sepang less than three weeks away,
improvement works are being undertaken on the airport's signages to
ensure that they are clear enough for passengers.
	   At several strategic locations within the airport, signages have
been enlarged so passengers will not `feel lost'.
	   Malaysia Airport (Sepang) Sdn Bhd general manager Muhammad Adnan
Yahya said the changes were made after several ``advance
passengers'' complained during trials that they got ``lost''
because there was not enough signages or the signages were too
small.
	   ``Most of the changes were made at important locations such as
at the Contact Pier, Satellite A and the arrival hall building,''
he told the New Straits Times yesterday.
	   Malaysia Airports Berhad managing director Datuk Khairuddin
Ibrahim said, however, that ``too many signages would make this
airport too similar to the Sultan Abdul Aziz Shah International
airport in Subang''.
	   Yet, one visitor noted: ``There needs to be more signages. I
feel lost just entering the airport.''
	   Temporary paper signages such as the ones shown here have also
been put up at KLIA before permanent signages are put up.
	   Apart from enlarging the signages, they have also been colour
coded to differentiate between domestic and international travel.

	   NON performing loans (NPLs) would have to jump to 10 per cent of
the total before the profitability of banks in Hong Kong were
undermined, international ratings agency Fitch IBCA said yesterday.
	   But the gloomy outlook for property values and the rising levels
of unemployment could result in the individual ratings of some
banks having to be reviewed, the agency said.
	   In an analysis of the financial health of banks in Hong Kong,
Fitch IBCA calculates that 2 per cent of total loans are currently
non-performing and that banks have set aside reserves to cover
approximately 20 per cent of these non performing loans (NPLs).
	   In a clear reflection of the strength of banks' balance sheets,
the agency said that assuming a loss rate of 30 per cent, NPLs
would have to rise to 10 per cent of total loans for the banks to
report a negative return on their equity.
	   ``This reflects the remarkably strong and liquid balance sheets
of banks in Hong Kong and their good profitability. If Japanese
banks were faced with a similar charge, 40 per cent of their
capital would disappear,'' the report says.
	   Fitch IBCA's analysis of banks assumes a ratio of loans to
assets of 50 per cent, an equity to assets ratio of 10 per cent,
average interest rates of 11 per cent and a tax rate of 12 per
cent.
	   A recent Hong Kong Monetary Authority survey showed banks had a
loan to valuation (LTV) ratio of just over 50 per cent. This
suggests that even if property prices were to fall by half from
their peak, most loans would still be fully secured.
	   Defaults on residential mortgages have also been very low: 0.04
per cent of loans overdue by three months for the period to the end
of last September.
	   ``As our analyses show, the sound condition of banks in Hong
Kong means that they are well able to absorb a rise in NPLs to as
much as 10 per cent without too much damage. These strengths have
been factored into our credit ratings. However, even if banks can
absorb the losses, their performance may be significantly
affected,'' Fitch IBCA says.

	   BRITAIN wants to pursue a relationship of ``equal partners''
based on mutual respect with Malaysia. It is looking at three main
areas - investment between the two countries, education and culture
- where relations between the two countries can be further
enhanced.
	   British High Commissioner to Malaysia Mr David Moss, who
described the British-Malaysia relations as being a ``close'' and
``full relationship,''
	   said: ``The big areas for the future, I think, are going to be
more investments, clearly both ways but certainly more investments
in Malaysia.
	   We know big British players are still looking at Malaysia.
	   ``Another area is bound to be education. One other area in which
I would like to see more done is with regards to cultural
contacts,'' he told Business Times in an interview to coincide with
Queen Elizabeth II's birthday. The Queen is scheduled to make a
state visit to Malaysia in September.
	   Moss, underlining the importance of British-Malaysia relations,
said that it is merely a historial relationship but one that is
relevant to the turn of the century.
	   During the Queen's visit, he said the British Government is keen
for her to look at ``high-tech'' Malaysia and see what the country
can do at the turn of the century.
	   ``I hope that the people of Britain - when they see what the
Queen has seen and done here - will realise that she has come to a
modern and vibrant country.
	   ``We want to make it illustrative of Malaysia in 1998 and not be
playing on traditional ties. We are talking to the Malaysian
Government now and we know that London wants to give the visit an
up-to-date resonance.
	   ``It will be a a visit relevant to a mature relationship, one
that is looking to the future,'' he added.
	   Excerpts from the interview: Q: How would you describe relations
between the two countries since Malaysia gained independence from
Britain 41 years ago?
	   A: British-Malaysia relations are very close. We have known each
other a long time and we have many things in common. We share a
historical experience. The relationship covers a very broad
spectrum such as political contacts, a commercial link, a very
strong educational link, cultural contacts and, something which is
not always remembered, a defence relationship between the two
countries in the Five Power Defence Arrangement.
	   We do not always see eye-to-eye on details but, I think, we have
always been able to talk through the issues in a friendly fashion
if there are any divergences.
	   The point that we want to emphasise is that this relationship,
which has lasted for decades and well over a century, is now a
relationship of equal partners and based on mutual respect. We see
that in many ways.
	   The relationship is close and we think it is comfortable. I
think that was the word Malaysian Prime Minister Datuk Seri Dr
Mahathir Mohamad used a year ago in describing the bilateral
relationship and we agree with him.
	   We think it is a comfortable relationship and we are happy with
it.
	   Q: There were hitches during the 41 years of relations. How
would you describe these hitches?
	   A: I think Dr Mahathir had described them best. He called them
``hiccups''
	   and I cannot think of a better word. That was his word. We have
put it (the hiccups) firmly behind us now.
	   Q: Trade and investment trends in the past years?
	   A: It has always been a key issue and it is particularly
important to Malaysia now during the economic downturn.
	   I was impressed, when I first came here, by the sheer size of
the trade flows. In 1997, the two-way trade flow was RM20 billion.
That makes Malaysia a very important market for Britain. Not many
British people know that Malaysia is a more important market for
Britain than either China or Russia.
	   Britain is an even more important market for Malaysia because
there is an imbalance in the trade. The balance in favour of
Malaysia last year was RM5 billion. It is a very important market
for Malaysia, particularly for high-profile products such as the
Proton cars.
	   As far as we can see, our trade flows are holding up pretty
well. We are equally impressed to see the number of British
businessmen coming to Malaysia. There has been no falling off in
the number of British businessmen coming to Malaysia this year.
	   We had wondered whether all the news about the downturn in the
region would lead to a falling off in the flow but the numbers have
held up well.
	   The other thing that we have been able to do is to keep up the
number of trade missions, bringing about one trade mission a month
to Malaysia. We did that through 1996 and 1997 and we are to do it
again in 1998. We are keeping up the rhythm of one trade mission a
month.
	   Trade is important and seems to be holding up pretty well at the
moment as are the business interests in Britain.
	   As for investments, we cannot really get an accurate figure for
British investments in Malaysia but our best estimate is that it is
probably around RM20 billion. In the recent two to three years,
there were more signs of Malaysian investments in Britain. These
were some high-profile investments.
	   The Invest in Britain Bureau, which is responsible for the flow
of foreign investments into Britain, says that they are still
getting Malaysian enquiries and that there is still interest in
Malaysia about investing in Britain.
	   We have to take the long-term view where investments are
concerned. For British investors in Malaysia, they know that the
downturn is going to be temporary. They know that the economy is
basically sound and will come out of the downturn. They want to be
here for the long term. They will continue to look at the
investment possibilities.
	   I think that Malaysia has to export its way through its
difficulties.
	   One of the world's three most important markets is clearly the
European Union (EU) and we see Britain as the natural base for any
Malaysian companies of any size which want to operate there.
	   I think what we are finding - and I guess it is true for
Malaysian companies - is that we have got beyond the stage where
you cannot export by having a manufacturing operations 7,000 miles
away and sending people to Malaysia expecting to sell. You have to
have an operation in Malaysia.
	   You have to look now at joint ventures or other forms of
partnerships here. That is probably going to be true in reverse for
Malaysian companies. They are going to find that if they want to
export on any real scale to Europe, they have to set up operations
at the other end.
	   We feel that investments are a long-term business and it is not
good to just stop because of the economic downturn. You have to
keep going.
	   Q: You said that the High Commission wants to maintain the
rhythm of one mission a month. Does the mission keep tabs on these
delegations?
	   A: The Department of Trade and Industry helps set up the mission
while the High Commission organises programmes for them while they
are here. We give them a briefing at the beginning of their visit
about doing business in Malaysia. At the end, before they leave the
country, we bring them in for another talk to find out how they got
on. Later when they are back in Britain, we will follow up to see
whether anything actually happens. So, we keep pretty close tabs on
them.
	   What we found is two things. Firstly, some of them come here
wondering - having heard the news about the downturn - whether they
will get to do much business. They go away on the whole very
pleased, having found that it is possible to find people interested
in their products or services. In other words, they come in a
rather quizzical frame of mind but they go away usually finding
that they are able to do business.
	   The other thing we find is that they are increasingly setting up
joint ventures when they come. They find a business partner and
afterwards, negotiate a joint venture. They understand they have
got to enter into long-term relationships. They cannot just have
one-off orders. These messages seem to have got through.
	   Q: They don't see the turmoil in the region as affecting their
businesses?
	   A: Increasingly, when they come to the region, they understand
better when they leave. Companies find that it is possible to do
business in Malaysia. They find everything is more normal than they
expected. They are now even understanding better the need to set up
partnerships and joint ventures with Malaysian companies. They go
away basically reassured.
	   The encouraging thing is they come on trade missions to start
with but after that, they come on their own. Basically, we want to
bring them here to show them the opportunities in this market and
we want them to follow up and many of them do.
	   Q:Besides trade and investments, what are the areas which can be
worked on between Malaysia and Britain?
	   A: It is such a full relationship at the moment. There are no
big areas missing. The big areas for the future I think are going
to be more investments, clearly both ways but certainly more
investments in Malaysia.
	   We know big British players still looking at Malaysia.
	   The other area is bound to be education. We accept the fact that
the enormous range of educational contacts between Britain and
Malaysia are going the change. It has been changing for some years.
Britain has been a popular destination for Malaysian students going
overseas for their university education. When the downturn started,
we think there were 18,000 to 20,000 Malaysian students in the UK.
In the short-term, we have done our best to help young Malaysians
cope with the problems caused by the downturn.
	   The British Government has brought in a scheme - to which
British industry has also contributed to - which is meant to help
Malaysians already at British universities to cope with the
financial pressures and enable them to complete their education.
That is one of the things that is changing.
	   The other thing that is changing, I think, is that Malaysia is
going to become more self-sufficient for first degree courses. It
is inevitable.
	   Education overseas is expensive. So, we see that we must
concentrate increasingly in Britain on post-graduate, specialist
courses and we imagine the flow of Malaysians going to Britain will
be increasing in this area. There will be fewer first degree
students, more post-graduate students.
	   We have a High Commissioner's scholarship scheme where we have
sent some 70 to 80 Malaysians to study in Britain. We see the need
to move that increasingly towards post-graduate training.
	   What more can we do? How can we improve the relationship? The
other area I would like to see more done is the cultural contacts.
I know that costs money but I would like to see more British
artists, groups and performances in Malaysia.
	   Q: Britain has undertaken the ``Britain in Malaysia'' campaign.
What is the campaign about?
	   A: Britain is committed to the campaign. It was evident to us
over a year ago that 1998 was going to be an important year for
Malaysia with the Commonwealth Games and the Asia Pacific Economic
Cooperation summit. We saw then that it was going to be a high
profile year for Malaysia. Above it all, you are going to have a
state visit by the Queen in September. We thought of activities we
could do in support of what Malaysia was doing to promote the year
... things that could complement Malaysia's own efforts.
	   We have drawn up a programme of events. The high profile event
would be the state visit and we are also hoping to organise a major
exhibition here in Kuala Lumpur.
	   We have put together, we think, an impressive list of events in
Malaysia this year. We hope it will demonstrate Britain's continued
commitment to Malaysia at this difficult time. It seems to us that
it is a good time to underline our commitment to Malaysia.
	   Q: The Queen's visit in September. How would it boost relations?
	   A: We are trying to underline the fact that the relations
between Britain and Malaysia are relevant to the turn of the
century. It is not just historial relations but is important to
both countries as we move into the new millenium. For that reason,
we are not going to look backward during the visit. we are looking
at the modern manifestation of the relationship rather that the
traditional ones.
	   This is why we are keen for the Queen to look at high-tech
Malaysia and what Malaysia can do at the turn of the century. I
hope that the people in Britain, when they see what the Queen has
done here, will realise that she has come to a modern and vibrant
country.
	   We want to make it illustrative of Malaysia of 1998 and not be
playing on the traditional ties. We are talking to the Malaysian
Government now and we know that London wants to give the visit an
up-to-date resonance.
	   It will be a a visit relevant to a mature relationship, one that
is looking to the future.
	   Q: On a broader perspective of the EU and Malaysia, how would
Britain facilitate EU-Malaysia relations?
	   A: The British Presidency of the EU came at a good time for
Asia.
	   Britain probably has a wider experience with Asia than any other
European country. Historically, that must be true. We have an
enormous range of connections in Asia.
	   Britain has always been an outward looking country and has been,
what you might call, a blue sea trader. Our horizons have always
been beyond Europe and they still are.
	   When the downturn came in East Asia, Britain, I think, thought
that thePresidency would be an opportunity to demonstrate not just
for Britain but also to the EU that we are still relevant ... with
a big role to play in East Asia. I do not think many Malaysians
understand that the EU banks have far more exposure in East Asia
than both the US and Japanese banks combined. We are enourmously
involved with what is happening here because our banks are deeply
involved.
	   On another level, we recognised that the thing to do is to
thicken up personal relations between the leaders. We thought the
Asia-Europe Meeting 2 (Asem) in London recently was very timely in
bringing together the top leaders from both Europe and East Asia at
this very difficult moment for East Asia. It gave the Europeans a
chance to listen to the problems first hand from the leaders
instead of reading it in the press or in reports from the high
commissions or embassies.
	   Specific measures came out of the meeting such as the Asem Trust
Fund in terms of technical expertise in financial restructuring and
the assessment of poverty impact.
	   I think that is one tangible way. The other is, of course, for
those countries that require International Monetary Fund (IMF)
packages. The EU is a big contributor to the packages. Together,
the EU contributes more than the US to all of those.
	   The most important thing that the EU can do for East Asia,
including Malaysia, now is to keep its markets open to all the
exports from East Asia. That the European leaders have pledged to
do, to keep our markets open because you have heard from the
Malaysian Government that Malaysia does need to increase its
exports but it cannot increase its exports if the main markets are
closed. We have pledged to keep our markets open and I think that
is the most important single step by far.

World Cup: Power will stay on for England-Tunisia game
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MILFORD, England (AP) _ Residents of two small villages in
central England will get to watch Monday's England-Tunisia World
Cup opener after an electricity company decided against going ahead
with power cuts.
	   An East Midlands Electricity official said Friday blackouts in
the villages of Milford and Lea would be rescheduled following
angry protests.
	   ``In the light of comments received from customers over the last
few days we have now arranged for the work to be carried out at
another time,'' said EME manager Keith Stanyard.
	   ``We will also be doing our utmost to ensure that further
planned interruptions do not coincide with World Cup matches.''
	   Jeanette Fallon, who lives in Milford, breathed easier.
	   ``We couldn't believe they would be that daft,'' she said. ``But
we are glad they have seen sense.''

	   THE Paliburg Group received an overwhelming response for its
Park Royale development in Yuen Long indicating that homebuyers are
willing to return to the market for low-price flats.
	   After six days of registration, the group has received more than
900 applications for Park Royale units.
	   This represents an oversubscription of more than 8 times for the
first batch of 100 units at an average price of $2,834 per square
foot.
	   In light of the strong demand, Paliburg has increased the total
available units for sale tomorrow to to 300.
	   It has also increased the average offering price for the last
batch of 50 units to $3,003 per sq ft, representing a 6 per cent
rise compared with the first batch.
	   However, the $3,003 price tag is still cheaper than the
prevailing market price for similar properties in the area since
Paliburg has discounted its price for Parke Royale units by some 15
per cent for the first batch of 100 units.
	   Managing director of Fortune Realty Company, James Tien said the
favourable market response for Park Royale has sent a positive
message to the property market as potential buyers are returning to
the market.
	   He said market demand is still strong if property developers are
willing to launch their projects at low prices.
	   Mr Tien anticipates all 300 units on offer tomorrow will go
quickly.
	   Meanwhile, a Paliburg spokesman said the group planned to
release additional units to the market tomorrow (if all the 300
units are sold quickly), but the number of additional units and the
price has not yet been finalised.
	   The project offers a total of 680 residential units in ten
12-storey towers. Standard sizes range from 650 to 950 sq ft, and
duplex units and penthouses of 1,600 to 2,000 sq ft.

	   TERTIARY industries will provide much needed employment for the
large number of workers who are expected to lose their jobs as a
result of the economic restructuring on the mainland, said Stanley
Ko, chairman of the Hong Kong Coalition of Service Industries
(HKCSI).
	   The HKCSI is a highly autonomous body established within the
Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce.
	   Mr Ko was leading a delegation on a visit to Beijing hosted by
the State Development and Planning Commission.
	   The 10-member delegation was received by Mr Bao Xuding,
vice-chairman of the State Planning and Development Commission
(SDPC). Before the government reshuffle Mr Bao was minister for
machinery.
	   ``It is clear that the Chinese leadership is committed to
carrying through the changes currently going on, both within the
government and in the wider economy in general, although that is
not without pains,'' said Mr Ko.
	   Apart from Mr Bao, the delegation also met and held discussion
with Mr Lan Shiliang, director of the Office of the Tertiary
Industry of the SDPC, as well as other government officials from
the State Economic and Trade Commission, the Bureau of Internal
Trade and the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Relations.
	   ``We have been encouraged by the positive message that China is
pressing ahead with measures to liberalise its service sector. This
will provide more opportunities for foreign investors. Being one of
the leading service economies in the world Hong Kong would have
much to gain from further market opening in China,'' said Mr Ko.
	   The Office of Tertiary Industry and the HKCSI also agreed to
continue fostering exchange and co-operation.

	   New taxes to yield Tk 350 crore: Tk 9320 crore deficit:
Incentives to investors: Computers, parts exempted from VAT: Cash
incentives for garments exports: Air-conditioners, refrigerators,
ceramic tiles, perfumes, toiletries to cost more: Import duty on
double-decker buses goes: Motor vehicle tax up
	   A four-tier tax rate structure, against the existing five-tier
tax rates for personal income tax, a series of incentives for
capital market and additional levies on a number of items consumed
by the affluent section are some of the highlights of the 1998-99
budget presented in the Jatiya Sangsad by Finance Minister SAMS
Kibria on Thursday in the absence of BNP members.
	   As a result of the fresh levies, air-conditioners,
refrigerators, ceramic tiles, perfumes, cigarettes, foreign toilet
soaps and toiletries as also imported furniture will be costlier.
	   Travel by taxis and three-wheelers may also cost more, because
of a hike in motor vehicle tax and fees as also a doubling of
supplementary duty on three-wheelers.
	   The budget by and large seeks to spare the common and poorer
section of the people from fresh tax burden.
	   The estimate for the National Board of Revenue
(NBR)-administered taxes has been placed at Tk 15,700 crore for
1998-99 as against the 1997-98 revised estimate of Tk 14,100 crore.
	   The net tax efforts will yield Tk 350 crore. The Finance
Minister, however, was optimistic that another Tk 385 crore of
additional revenue would accrue to the exchequer because of
intensive monitoring, supervision and procedural improvements. The
total revenue would grow by an additional Tk 865 crore owing to
natural revenue expansion, resulting from higher GDP growth.
	   The budget estimates the government's total expenditure for
1998-99 at Tk 30096 crore, as against 27070 crore in the revised
budget for the year 1997-98. The overall deficit for 1998-99 has
been placed at Tk 9320 crore of which Tk 5907 crore will be
financed by foreign aid and grants and the rest by domestic market
borrowings.
	   In his budget speech, the Finance Minister reiterated his faith
in market economy. To promote higher private investment, he sought
to give a boost to the capital market by providing a wide range of
incentives to investors, investing in stocks and shares.
	   With regard to the incentive for the capital market, the source
of income invested in purchase of shares in the primary and
secondary market will not be questioned provided the investor
retains the share for at least one year and pays tax at the rate of
seven and a half per cent on his investment.
	   Second, the Finance Minister proposed to exempt from tax income
from mutual fund accruing to the issuing companies, a benefit now
enjoyed by the Investment Corporation of Bangladesh (ICB). This
benefit has now been extended to all mutual funds.
	   Third, the discrimination in tax rates between publicly traded
financial institutions and non-financial business or industrial
enterprises has been removed.
	   All companies, including banks, insurance companies and other
financial institutions, which are listed with the stock exchange
will be subjected to a uniform tax rate of 35 percent. Finance
Minister Kibria hoped that a large number of banks and financial
institutions would be encouraged to list themselves with the stock
exchange as a result of this step.
	   Other incentives include a modification in the statutory
obligation of industries enjoying tax holidays to invest 30 per
cent of tax exempted income in government securities.
	   Kibria proposed that the dividends declared by such tax holiday
enjoying companies would count towards a statutory requirement of
investment. As for dividend income derived by individual tax
payers, the budget proposed that tax be deducted at source at the
rate of 10 per cent on the amount of dividend. This would be
treated as the final settlement of tax liability.
	   The Finance Minister hoped that more companies would be
encouraged to declare dividends which in turn would have a positive
impact on the share market.
	   The Finance Minister also proposed to exempt investment of
untaxed income in shares from primary and secondary market and for
expansion of existing units and repayment of industrial loan,
provided that tax be paid at the rate of seven and a half per cent.
	   The Finance Minister also proposed to simplify the provision for
filing returns under self-assessment scheme for private limited
companies by limiting the number of conditions to and extending the
provision beyond the financial year 1998-99.
	   The two conditions are that the income declared must be higher
by 10 per cent over the assessed income last year and the minimum
tax must be at least Tk 25,000.
	   Other measures on the direct tax front include a provision of
random selection of 10 per cent of the returns certified by
chartered accountants for auditing by taxmen and a revision of the
existing rates for withholding taxes.
	   The thrust of the budget proposal is to simplify the income tax
structure and widen the tax base through an increase in tax
compliance.
	   On the indirect tax front, the budget proposes to reduce the
highest rate of custom duty from 42.5 per cent to 40 per cent. This
reduction in duty involving a revenue loss of Tk 121 crore would
cover a wide range of consumption items, including processed
fruits, used clothes etc.
	   The budget also proposed a few steps in line with the government
policy to ensure speedy and hassle free clearance of imported and
exported cargo by reducing the discretionary powers of customs
officials.
	   The number of duty rates has been brought down to five from the
existing six rates. The new rates will be 7.5 per cent, 15 per
cent, 25 per cent, 30 per cent and 40 per cent.
	   The duty rates on a large number of raw materials and
intermediate products covering 852 H.S code are also proposed to be
reduced.
	   The items enjoying a reduction in duty rates include, food
flavour, tin can, crown cork and lug cap. A wide range of raw
materials and intermediate goods used for shrimp cultivation,
poultry and bakery will also attract lower rates of duty. The items
include active yeast (from 30 to 7.5 per cent), Vitamin B and its
derivatives (22.5 to 7.5 per cent) and animal and vegetable fats
and oil used as fish feed (42.5 to 30 per cent). The Finance
Minister said that although the reduction in duty rates would
result in substantial revenue loss, the government must make such
sacrifices to stimulate industrialisation, promote exports and
provide assistance to the agricultural sector.
	   In order to generate employment opportunities the budget
proposed to exempt computer and parts from the value added tax as
also from the existing customs duty of 2.5 per cent and 15 per cent
respectively. This duty concession will also extend to
uninterrupted power supply (UPS) imported along with a computer.
	   To help small, medium and large industries producing plastic
articles of everyday use, customs duty rates on primary polymer
have been brought down from 30 to 25 per cent. For expansion of
solar energy, photovoltaic generator has been exempted from customs
duty and value added tax in line with wind generators. A few
measures designed to support the leather industry include reduction
in duty rates on various pigments used in the industry from the
existing 15 per cent, 22.5 per cent and 30 per cent to a uniform
rate of 15 per cent. Duty on synthetic fibre is proposed to be
brought down from 2.5 to 0 per cent. Vat dyes from 15 to 7.5 per
cent, pigment from 15, 22.5 and 30 to 15 per cent and some spares
and components of the textile industry from 30 to 25 per cent.
	   To boost exports of readymade garments, cash incentives upto 25
per cent has been proposed.
	   The budget proposed to allow newspapers and periodicals to
import newsprint free of duty equal to the quantity of indigenously
produced newsprint purchased by them. To compensate the newspaper
industry for increased cost, the rate of government advertisement
is proposed to be raised by 30 per cent.
	   In order to reduce the cost of public transport, imports of
double-decker bus and taxi cabs will be free of duty. The duty of
on other types of buses and trucks is proposed to be slashed from
22.5 per cent to 15 per cent. Dumper and tipper trucks used in the
construction industry will invite only 7.5 per cent duty as against
the existing 22.5 and 15 per cent respectively. For the benefit of
the common man duty structure on various types of pulses has been
rationalised at a uniform rate of 7.5 per cent.
	   The VAT has been streamlined by introducing a participatory
system for determining annual sales volume for small traders and
retailers. The step is intended to facilitate voluntary compliance
by tax payers and collection of taxes without harassment at the
retail level. Nine more items have been included in the VAT net at
the retail level ranging from firearms, carpets, watches to ceramic
pieces, silver, brass, bronze and crystal glass c.i sheet and foam.
The system of tax collection procedure has also been simplified.
	   A number of new service sectors have also been brought under the
VAT network to widen the tax base. The services include, security
service, pathological laboratory, automatic or mechanised saw mill,
airconditioned garment shop and trade service, i.e wholesale deals
by importers and other domestic traders. Travel agency which had
been exempted from VAT has been brought into the network to bring
it on a par with entities rendering similar service.
	   Cigarettes will attract higher rates of supplementary duty. The
revised rates are 32 per cent, 49 per cent, 50 per cent and 51 per
cent. The Finance Minister justified the higher rates of duty on
the ground that smoking is injurious to health.
	   Other items on which the supplementary duty rates have been
hiked substantially include airconditioners (10 per cent to 40 per
cent), Refrigerators (15 per cent to 20 per cent), ceramic tiles
(10 per cent to 20 per cent) Cigarette papers (35 per cent to 45
per cent) , imported furniture (40 per cent), toilet soap and
toiletries (from 10 - 20 per cent to 40 per cent).
	   In part I of his speech, the Finance Minister took credit for
the healthy growth of the economy and expressed the government's
determination to implement reforms without delay to enable the
country to face fierce competition unleashed by the forces of free
market economy.
	   The actual growth rate achieved in 1997-98, he said, was 5.9 per
cent, which was preceded by a growth rate of 5.7 per cent in
1996-97. Such high growth rates, he asserted, were never achieved
for two consecutive years by any previous government.
	   The growth rates for the last two years indicated the success of
the government's economic policies, he claimed.
	   The Finance Minister also referred to the introduction of a new
index to measure the rate of inflation. According to the new index
in April, 1998, the inflation rate was 6.63 per cent as against
2.51 per cent in June 1997 and 6.65 per cent in June, 1996. The
increase in the inflation rate compared to last year, he said
quoting experts, was due to the unexpected shortfall in Aman
production.
	   However, he expressed the government's determination to curb any
long-term inflationary pressure and gave the assurance that
monetary and fiscal policies would be so geared so as not to allow
inflationary pressure to destabilise the macro-stability of the
economy.
	   The Finance Minister maintained that the performance of
Bangladesh economy was better than that of other developed
countries. In 1997-98 (July to April), exports accelerated by 15.75
per cent, 200 per cent higher than other developing countries. Taka
depreciated by about 5.7 per cent which was very modest compared to
the currency in India, Pakistan, South Korea , Thailand, Indonesia,
Malaysia, Nepal and Sri Lanka. Remittances by Bangladesh citizens
also increased by 7.5 per cent during the first eight months of the
current fiscal year.
	   The Finance Minister announced that arrangements for
privatisation of nine private sector enterprises in the current
year had been finalised. He also announced a proposal to issue
bonds worth Tk 60 crore in 1998-99 to compensate the losses of
banks for implementation of rehabilitation measures for sick public
sector industries.
	   He indicated that remision of interest of enlisted sick
industries which had borrowed upto Taka 50 lakh from the state
owned banks would be considered by a special committee headed by a
retired judge. The government would reimburse 50 per cent of such
remitted interest to banks.
	   Of the total proposed government spending of Tk 30,096 crore in
1998-99, the highest outlay of Tk 4596.14 crore would be on
education, while health and family welfare would account for Tk
2224.54 crore. Implementation of the second phase of the pay
commission recommendations would cost Tk 495.14 crore, including
development expenditure in the fiscal year 1998-99 and Tk 691.32
crore in 1999-2000. In total, a sum of Tk 2074.87 crore would be
spent for pay hike in three stages including pay increases in
development projects.
	   The allocation for defence is proposed to be raised to Tk
2786.43 crore in 1998-99 from Tk 2600.8 crore last year.
	   The Finance Minister justified the hike in defence expenditure
on grounds of national interests. He said that despite the increase
the total expenditure on defence constituted only about 1.8 per
cent of the GDP, which was much lower than defence spending in
other developing countries.

	   AUSTRALIAN property developer Mirvac Group plans to offer at
least four residential projects in its home country to investors in
Hong Kong during the next few months.
	   The company is keen to take advantage of the low exchange rate
of the Australian dollar with the Hong Kong currency, as well as
the level of inflation and interest rates.
	   Wayfoong Property, a wholly-owned subsidiary of HSBC group, was
appointed sole agent in Hong Kong for Australia-listed Mirvac Group
last November.
	   Alice Lee, deputy manager of overseas marketing for Wayfoong,
said the mortgage rate for Australian property stands at 5.95 per
cent _ the lowest level for 20 years, while the currency remains at
a low level of A$1 to HK$4.6.
	   This was a good opportunity for Hong Kong investors to tap into
the Australian property market.
	   She said that after the Asian currency turmoil and the prolonged
slump in the local property market, Hong Kong investors were
expected to diversify their investment portfolios.
	   According to First Pacific Davies, Australian property owners
have never had it so good, and the omens look promising for the
immediate future.
	   Sydney property values rose by nearly half for the properties
traded there in 1997.
	   Despite the previous growth, Ms Lee said it was not too late to
enter the Australian property market as the country's economy was
surging strongly.
	   David Mann, corporate relations manager for Mirvac Group, said
the first project to be launched in Hong Kong would be the
Shoremark development in Sydney.
	   Mr Mann said rental yield for residential property in Australia
is around 5 to 6 per cent.
	   There are 95 Shoremark units available for sale during a sales
exhibition in Hong Kong from 12 to 15 June.
	   Prices range from A$310,000 for a one-bedroom apartment to
A$495,000 for a three-bedroom apartment.

	   KLANG, Thurs. - Police have detained a 23-year-old man in
connection with a robbery in Kampung Sungai Udang on May 27 during
which a secondary schoolteacher and her two children were injured.
	   The man was detained in Lorong Masjid off Jalan Yadi on June 3
while he was driving a metallic grey Perodua Kancil bearing the
registration number BEW 5574 belonging to the teacher.
	   Klang police chief Assistant Commissioner Karn Kam Peng said a
police patrol car on crime prevention rounds spotted the car in
Lorong Masjid and ordered the driver to stop.
	   Further investigations showed that the man had pawned a gold
bangle worth RM800 belonging to the teacher at a pawnshop in Klang.
	   The item was later recovered.
	   In the robbery about 9am, a man had come to the teacher's house
on the pretext of looking for the village midwife.
	   When the teacher told him that she did not know who the midwife
was, the man brandished a knife and forced his way into her home.
	   The 30-year-old teacher, who put up a fight, and her
18-month-old son, were slashed.
	   Irritated with the teacher's son and four-year-old daughter
crying, the man grabbed a lesong batu (pestle) and hit the children
and the mother on their heads.
	   The daughter who sustained severe injuries was admitted at the
Tengku Ampuan Rahimah Hospital while the mother and son were
treated as outpatients.

	   The new proposed national budget for the year 1998-99 presented
by Finance Minister SAMS Kibria in Parliament yesterday drew mixed
public reaction.
	   Different political parties including the ruling Awami League
and student organisations brought out processions in the city last
evening to welcome the budget while the opposition including the
BNP rejected it terming it an anti-people one.
	   Police arrested three BNP activists from a sit-in-demonstration
in between Ananda Community Centre and the BNP office. The BNP
activists started the sit-in-demonstration as police had
intercepted their procession brought out to protest the budget.
	   Dhaka city AL and Bangladesh Awami Jubo League (BAJL), the youth
wing of the ruling party brought-out a procession preceded by a
rally in front of its Bangabandhu Avenue office.
	   AL leaders Muzaffar Hossain Paltu, Nurul Fazal Bulbul, Fazlur
Rahman Fantomus and BAJL General Secretary Advocate Kazi Iqbal
addressed the rally.
	   Expressing their total support to the new budget, they
congratulated Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and Finance Minister
SAMS Kibria for what they termed a ``development-oriented and
pro-people budget.''
	   Muzaffar Hossain Paltu also termed the budget a ``document of
success'' of the government, totally committed to leading the
nation towards prosperity.
	   Bangladesh Chhatra League ( S-P), the student front of the AL
brought out a procession welcoming the budget from the TSC of the
Dhaka University. BCL President Enamul Haq Shamim and General
Secretary Ishaq Ali Khan Panna led the procession which paraded
some parts of the campus last evening.
	   In a brief rally before the procession, the BCL leaders
expressed support to the budget on behalf of the student community.
	   Meanwhile, police dispersed a BNP procession, taken out against
the budget, by resorting to a mild baton charge and picked up three
supporters near the BNP's central office in the city last evening.
	   The police action left at least two activists slightly injured.
One of the injured was identified as Ashraf.
	   According to eyewitnesses, the BNP procession, led by the Dhaka
city BNP Convener Sadek Hossain Khoka, MP was stopped by police
about 100 yards from the BNP central office at Nayapalton at 7.05
pm.
	   At one stage, the BNP activists, chanting slogans against the
budget, pushed the police back about 10 yards. After the police
intervention, BNP leaders Amanullah Aman, MP, Najimuddin Alam, MP
and Salahuddin Ahmed started addressing the processionists to
condemn the police intervention.
	   After the speech of Salahuddin Ahmed, police resorted to a mild
lathi charge and dispersed the processionists. Later, Sadek Hossain
Khoka also addressed a handful of workers present there. Following
the police action, the processionists ran helter skelter for
safety.
	   Two of the three teenage boys, picked up by police from the
spot, were identified as Bachchu and Nizam. Police also tried to
pick up Sharif Hossain, a personal security staff of the Leader of
the Opposition in Parliament Begum Khaleda Zia from the spot, but
Sadek Hossain Khoka managed to avert it.
	   Leaders of the Ganotantrik Chhatra Oikyo (GCO), an alliance of
eight student organisations, at a rally at TSC last evening
criticised the government for what they called a budget that had
betrayed the student community. The GCO activists also took out a
procession which ended in front of the National Press Club.

	   IPOH, Thurs. - The People's Progressive Party has urged the
Government to grant more permits for the import of rice to ensure
stiffer competition among traders and wholesalers.
	   Its State treasurer Lee Heng said such a move would inevitably
result in lower prices.
	   ``We should not allow one company to monopolise rice imports,''
he said commenting on the recent increase in the price of the super
grade variety.
	   Lee said the Government should continue to open up more land and
utilise idle land for the cultivation of padi as the price increase
had greatly affected the people.
	   ``The Government should also introduce better padi strains to
enable farmers to increase their yields.''

	   KOWLOON Motor Bus Holdings (KMB) said yesterday average
passenger loading only dropped slightly in the first six months of
this year despite the Asian financial crisis.
	   ``The average passenger loading dropped slightly by 1 per cent
compared with the corresponding period in the previous year,'' said
John C C Chan, managing director of KMB.
	   Mr Chan said as the economic condition of Hong Kong weakens,
people tend to use a cheaper means of transportation such as a bus.
``Therefore, KMB could maintain the level of passenger loading at
last year's level.'' But he said the bus industry was not totally
immune from the effects of the regional turmoil. ``It is because
some people may be spending a longer time at home because of the
poor economic situation.'' Mr Chan said the average passenger
loading may further drop in the coming weeks as people were staying
home to watch the World Cup.
	   ``We are confident that the overall passenger loading of 1998
could be maintained at last year's level because of the addition of
a series of routes after Chek Lap Kok airport commences service.''
He said the company would continue to seek opportunities on the
mainland. ``We are looking at development opportunities in the
mainland as the mainland is a large and potential market for the
company.''

	   THE High Court of the First Instance has granted the Official
Receiver a Regulating Order for both CA Pacific Securities and CA
Pacific Finance with respect to the winding up of both companies.
	   The order is for the first meeting of creditors and
contributories to be held in order to appoint a liquidator and a
committee of inspection.
	   Coopers and Lybrand are the current provisional liquidators.
	   The winding-up of CA Pacific Finance Limited and CA Pacific
Securities Limited will also be regulated by the court under the
Companies Ordinance.
	   This week it was announced CA Pacific Securities' clients would
get an initial payment of $150,000 from the compensation fund _ a
record.
	   The Government, Securities and Futures Commission and the Stock
Exchange of Hong Kong agreed in January to relax both the
compensation rules and the limt on the amount in relation to the
default of CA Pacific Securities. They had determined that if the
usual $8 million limit were observed, the compensation that each
client might receive was likely to be very limited.
	   ``Under the current compensation rules,'' said a government
statement yesterday, ``the maximum compensation payable to
claimants against any single registered broker was $8 million. Even
with a flexible approach, claimant compensation would be limited,''
the statement added.
	   In January, due to the recent spate of brokerage collapses, it
was decided to increase the level of compensation fund resources.
	   ``In order to put investors hearts at ease,'' Secretary for
Financial Services Rafael Hui said at the time, ``we will increase
the compensation fund as well as making flexible arrangements. The
SEHK and the SFC will inject $150 million immediately and a further
$150 million each if necessary.''

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Thurs. - Consumers stand to enjoy a lower price
for Super Grade rice once wholesalers nationwide come up with a new
recommended retail price equivalent to the price sold at Bernas
outlets and subsidiaries.
	   Although no time-frame was given, Domestic Trade and Consumer
Affairs Minister Datuk Seri Megat Junid Megat Ayob said the
industry players had agreed to come out with a revised price list
as soon as possible.
	   He said although there were no specifics on how much lower the
price would be, wholesalers had promised it would be lower than the
present price.
	   ``If they still increase the price, the Government is likely to
decide on whether to control the price of Super Grade rice. In
addition, the Government can take `administrative' action against
the wholesalers.''
	   He said at the moment, the Government would let market forces
determine the price instead of making it a controlled item.
	   Megat Junid said this after meeting Padiberas Nasional Bhd,
wholesalers, millers and retailers to discuss the cause of the
price increase in Super Grade rice, which is not
Government-regulated.
	   Bernas is selling a 10kg packet of super grade rice with five
per cent broken content for RM14, with 10 per cent broken content
for RM13.80, and the same packet with 15 per cent broken content
for RM13.
	   He said Bernas represented between 25 and 30 per cent of the
supply of local rice or 16.7 per cent of the total market in
Malaysia at the pre- wholesaling level.
	   He did not deny some millers might have taken advantage of the
situation by pushing up prices to between RM1.30 and RM1.60 per kg;
and some wholesalers have been selling at RM1.80 per kg.
	   These factors, among others, could be due to supply and demand,
transportation and labour costs.
	   The ministry would continue to monitor rice price movements, and
the Padi and Rice Price Control and Monitoring Division has been
told to prepare a report on local and imported super grade rice.
	   The only control on Super Grade rice is on its quality. It
should contain not more than 15, 10 and five per cent of
low-quality rice (beras hancur).
	   Standard Grade is a local produce which contains broken rice,
rice from unripened padi and permissible foreign bodies while
Premium Grade is local rice of moderate quality.

	   Exports from Bangladesh during the last two years is highly
encouraging compared to the average performance of the developing
countries, Finance Minister Shah AMS Kibria told the Parliament
yesterday. Presenting the budget for the fiscal 1998-99 in the
Jatiya Sangsad, Kibria said exports from Bangladesh in 1996-97 in
dollar terms increased by 13.8 per cent while it further
accelerated to 16.75 per cent in the July-April period of 1997-98
fiscal. 'The rate of growth of exports from Bangladesh is more than
200 per cent higher than that of the developing countries,'' he
said in his budget speech. Speaking about the import performance,
the finance minister said imports during the first six months of
the current fiscal year rose 2.21 per cent, however, he said,
imports of industrial raw materials during this period registered
an increase by 17.7 per cent. He said the deficit in the current
account balance during the period July-December of the fiscal
1997-98 decreased by 24.9 per cent compared to the corresponding
period last year.
	   Despite a sudden increase in food imports in the later half of
the current fiscal, Kibria said, there has been no deterioration in
the reserve situation of the country thanks to rapid increases in
exports. The finance minister said Bangladesh Bank was pursuing a
flexible exchange rate policy with a view to encouraging exports.
The exchange rate is being determined on the basis of daily index
of real effective exchange rate (REER), he said. Kibria referred to
the turbulent international economic climate decelerating growth of
world export in 1998 and said the growth rate of exports from
developing countries would drop to 7.4 per cent this year. Quoting
the IMF projections, he said exports from developing countries
increased by 10.8 per cent in 1997. According to the Bangladesh
Economic Survey, 1998, along with the budget, the total import bill
was US dollar 7,162 million during the 1996-97 fiscal year while
the same during the July-December period of the current fiscal was
US dollar 3,612 million.
	   During the July-March period of the current fiscal year, the
survey said, the total exports from Bangladesh rose to 3,764.71
million US dollar representing 15.89 per cent increase over the
same period of the previous year. The exports during this period
registered an increase by 31.2 per cent in the ready-made garments
sector, 28.11 per cent in the tea sector and 11.9 per cent in the
knitwear sector. According to the survey report, ready-made
garments and knitwear represented 73 per cent of the total exports
from Bangladesh during the period July-March in the current fiscal.
The survey report also said that raw jute, frozen food and chemical
products suffered decrease in exports by 18.36 per cent, 9.82 per
cent and 24.65 per cent respectively during the period.The survey
report indicated a positive development in the export trend of
leather which suffered decrease by 7.6 per cent during the 1996-97
fiscal. It came down to only 0.28 per cent during the first nine
months of the current fiscal.
	   However, the survey said, the growth rate of exports of
ready-made garments, especially the knitwear, saw a downtrend
during the current fiscal year due to withholding of GSP facility
by the European Union since January, 1997. Bilateral discussion and
a strong trade diplomacy pursued by the present government helped
extension of flexible GSP facilities up to December 31, 1998, under
the scope of derogation, the survey report also said. It also said
the total trade deficit during the first six months of the current
fiscal stood at US dollar 1,007 million while it was 1,341 million
during the same period in the previous year. This proves that trade
balance registered an improvement by 24.9 per cent, the report said
adding this improvement was the result of 18.8 per cent export
increase and 2.2 per cent import increase during the period.
	   Finance Minister Shah A M S Kibria, in his budget speech, said
the expatriate Bangladesh nationals remitted US dollar 1,475
million during the 1996-97 fiscal which registered an increase by
7.85 per cent during the first eight months of the current fiscal
year. 'The remittances from abroad are largely influenced by
international economic environment,'' he said adding that the
remittances by the Bangladesh nationals increased at a satisfactory
rate despite the slump in Southeast Asia.

Ticket troubles escalate at World Cup
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with organizers disclaiming responsibility, other
details and background &QL; 
 &UR; By LARRY SIDDONS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A growing international scandal over World Cup
tickets erupted on two new fronts Friday, with the tournament
organizers saying they were investigating two soccer federations
and a branch of their own marketing arm for possible roles in the
scams.
	   Michel Zen-Ruffinen, FIFA's acting general secretary, said
investigations were under way into the improper sale of tickets by
soccer officials in Cameroon and an unidentified South American
country.
	   The president of the Cameroon soccer federation, Vincent Onana,
was detained as he tried to leave his country with the national
team, the world soccer body said. He was placed under investigation
this week for embezzlement of public funds, accused of supplying an
English agency with 3,000 tickets worth dlrs 660,000.
	   Zen-Ruffinen refused to give details of the South American case,
saying that the federation had not yet been formally advised.
	   FIFA also was investigating a case in which a representative of
the marketing company ISL France ``apparently sold tickets he did
not have to individuals.'' ISL, the giant Swiss-based marketing
company which handles FIFA's sponsors and television negotiations,
owns a small part of ISL France, Zen-Riffinen said.
	   ``It's a rather serious issue'' involving several thousand
tickets, he said.
	   With some 12,000 Japanese fans still without tickets they had
been promised and other victims reported in Europe and South
America, leaders of FIFA and the French World Cup organizing
committee said they were ready to sue agents who sold tickets
illegally, or sold tickets they never had.
	   They said they had heard complaints from fans missing tickets in
the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, England and Brazil, as well as
Japan.
	   ``I know we shall discover more situations in other countries,''
Zen-Ruffinen said.
	   At the same time, FIFA and the French organizers tried to
distance themselves from the scandal, repeatedly saying they had
followed the rules in distributing tickets and that the problem lay
with unscrupulous businesses and naive fans desperate for tickets.
	   ``There's some confusion here, and that is creating excuses for
the operators,'' said Isabelle Delaye, the organizing committee's
ticket chief. ``We should criticize them. They found the ideal way
of making money, by deceiving people.''
	   Jacques Lambert, the committee's managing director, said his
group had repeatedly warned fans not to deal with anyone but
licensed brokers and to beware of schemes that promised too much.
	   ``Any other agency, company, body, whatever, pretending they had
tickets, had no tickets whatsoever,'' Lambert said. ``We had a lot
of reminders about them, for people to be very careful. Clearly,
those warnings have not been heeded.''
	   FIFA defended the French committee, but confirmed there were
enough problems to force the federation to make drastic changes in
ticket policies before the next Cup in 2002, which is being
co-hosted by Japan and South Korea.
	   It also said some of the problems fans were encountering could
have started right in international soccer's backyard.
	   World Cup tickets are legally available through just three
sources _ FIFA and the organizing committee, national soccer
federations and 17 licensed ticket brokers around the world.
	   Those brokers have 150-200 licensed re-sellers, but officials
said at a 90-minute news conference that they did not known if the
agents dealing in phantom tickets were officially approved or from
outside the group.
	   While there were some ticket problems in 1990 in Italy and
supply rarely meets demand for World Cup tickets, there never have
been such widespread complaints.
	   The organizing committee printed almost 2.7 million tickets,
about 800,000 less than the record number sold for the 1994 World
Cup in the United States. Even though there are eight more teams
and 12 more games, the French stadiums are much smaller than the
big U.S. arenas.
	   With the Cup is back in the middle of soccer-mad Europe, there
has been increased pressure for the tickets available. The European
Union said the organizer's ticket-distribution plans were weighted
too heavily for French fans and sponsors, and ordered changes, but
the tickets remain the hottest thing on the market with all the
stadiums full.

	   BENAVENTE, Spain (AP) _ A small bull escaped from cordoned off
streets during a bull run and rampaged through the streets of the
northwestern Spanish town of Benavente, injuring 21 people.
	   A 13-year-old girl was gored in her genitals and another two
women in the legs Thursday, said the Hospital Comarcal de Benavente
in a statement Friday. Their conditions were not serious.
	   The rest of the wounded were lightly injured in falls or by
rushing crowds when they tried to avoid being tossed or gored after
the bull broke a security fence and ran through the city.
	   The bull was shot and killed half an hour later by the Civil
Guard who cornered it in a downtown street.
	   In Benavente, like many other northern and central Spanish
towns, bulls are run through cordoned-off streets to the town's
bull ring. Professional matadors fight them later in the day.
	   The San Fermin festival in Pamplona is the country's most
well-known and has been held almost continuously since 1591. It
became internationally famous with Ernest Hemingway's 1926 novel,
``The Sun Also Rises'' and attracts hundreds of thousands of people
each year.
	   Dozens are hurt in the runs each year.

	   ECONOMIST John Greenwood, the architect of the Hong Kong dollar
to the US dollar peg, says Hong Kong should be ready for a possible
devaluation of the yuan.
	   In the face of a slackening of the mainland's export and
domestic economy, the yuan may be devalued in the end, said Mr
Greenwood, chief economist of LGT Asset Management.
	   Mr Greenwood, however, said he expects the peg to remain stable
in face of a yuan devaluation despite statements from other
economists that the Hong Kong dollar will come under strong
pressure if Beijing devalues its currency.
	   ``The devaluation of the renminbi might mean a temporary
speculative attack on the Hong Kong dollar. I think it's much more
likely that such effects would be spread out over time,'' Mr
Greenwood said.
	   ``Over the last 15 years, the Hong Kong dollar has survived a 70
per cent depreciation of the renminbi. There is no reason why a
further adjustment of the renminbi should cause an adjustment of
the Hong Kong dollar in future,'' he said.
	   Mr Greenwood believes the yuan is likely to come under strong
pressure in 1999.
	   ``Gradually, I think we will see the mainland's trade surplus
diminish. And given the rather deflationary conditions in China at
the moment, the capital inflows to China may also be reduced, and
the overall balance of payments would be subject to pressure in
1999,'' he said.
	   He said Hong Kong should be well-prepared for a possible
devaluation of the yuan.

	   IN times when most companies are struggling to keep their heads
above the water, United Bintang Bhd is confident of maintaining its
performance this year based on its bullish export business.
	   The reconditioned and used heavy equipment trader's export sales
nearly doubled to RM31 million for the year ended Dec 31, 1997,
from RM16 million in the previous year.
	   Executive director Gary Loh yesterday said: ``We are confident
our exports will increase by more than 15 per cent and account for
80 per cent of the turnover for the year ending Dec 31, 1998.''
	   In line with this, United Bintang is planning to open a sales
office in Dubai, United Arab Emirates.
	   ``The office in Dubai will cater for the company's export
business in Iraq, Iran, Africa and India.
	   ``We will be tapping into those countries as soon as the office
is set up,'' he added.
	   At present, United Bintang exports its reconditioned and used
heavy equipment - bought in Malaysia and Japan - to United States
and Canada.
	   ``We will be sourcing heavy equipment from Indonesia and
Thailand soon as prices of equipment have declined in these
countries due to the regional economic woes,'' he said.
	   Last year, United Bintang announced that it was going to export
equipment to Japan. However, due to the economic problems, the
company has decided to focus on expanding to the US and Canada.
	   ``In future, we will be concentrating on making the US our main
export market. But there is much to learn about the heavy equipment
market in the country.''
	   Loh was speaking after United Bintang's annual meeting in Kuala
Lumpur.
	   Currently, United Bintang exports reconditioned and used
equipment valued between RM70,000 and RM400,000.
	   In Malaysia, he said, the domestic reconditioned and used heavy
equipment market has shrunk at an alarming rate.
	   ``Due to the economic problems faced by the country, many
construction projects have been deferred or cancelled. As such, the
demand for heavy equipment has declined more than 70 per cent in
Malaysia.
	   ``Therefore, we have decided to increase exports to compensate
for the decline in business in Malaysia.''
	   United Bintang is the sole distributor of the Terex brand of
articulated trucks in Malaysia.
	   The trucks are manufactured by a Scottish company, Terex
Equipment Limited, which is the third largest manufacturer of
articulated trucks in the world.
	   To date, United Bintang has secured 20 per cent of the used
heavy machinery market in the domestic market.
	   On the company's plans to venture into property development in
Malaysia, Loh said United Bintang had put the diversification plan
on hold due to the economic downturn in the country.
	   United Bintang registered a group pre-tax profit of RM3.81
million for the year ended Dec 31, 1997 from RM7.57 million
achieved in 1996.
	   Its turnover fell 31 per cent to RM89.91 million from RM129.6
million previously while earnings per share fell to 13 sen from 29
sen.

	   Commerce and Industries Minister Tofail Ahmed said present
government has given emphasis on investment and modern
refrigeration technology to help rapid industrialisation. He was
inaugurating the seminar on Industrial Refrigeration Technology' at
a city hotel yesterday jointly organised by the Landmark Bangladesh
Ltd and Grasso (Thailand) Company Ltd. The minister said that
Bangladesh as LDC will get duty free market access to the developed
and developing countries very soon. He called upon the
entrepreneurs to produce quality and diversified products based on
markets demand.
	   The minister said that Bangladesh is maintaining the highest
export growth rate in the region which is at present 16.75 per
cent. He mentioned that refrigeration of optimum temperature plays
a key role in preserving food items as well as ensuring safety of
the industrial machinery and equipment. He also said that
application of modern refrigeration technology is growing with the
increase of production of fish, potato and other agro-products in
the country.
	   Referring to the problem faced in exporting frozen foods of
Bangladesh in recent years, the minister said, the present
government has taken prompt action including sanction of loans to
the fish processing plants to fulfil the requirements of the
importing countries about quality control including the freezing
system. He said that acquisition of ISO certification is another
growing conditionality to export and the government has taken
necessary steps to create awareness among the entrepreneurs about
ISO certification.
	   The inaugural function of the day-long seminar was also
addressed by the Dutch Ambassador in Bangladesh Dick Den Hass and
the Managing Directors of the two sponsored companies. Executives
of various enterprises of private and public sectors took part in
the seminar, said an official handout.

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ With its air power demonstration and
possible armed intervention, NATO is sending a message to Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic that he should halt slaughter of
innocent people in Kosovo, Defense Secretary William Cohen said
Friday.
	   Cohen, in an interview with ABC television, said he and his
Russian counterpart, Gen. Igor Sergeyev, agreed that ``the
situation is dangerous in terms of its capacity to expand even
further, sending thousands of refugees into neighboring
countries.''
	   Russia opposes the military options NATO is considering for the
Serbian province. Cohen said Sergeyev urged further efforts toward
a diplomatic solution and pointed to a meeting Monday in Moscow
between Russian President Boris Yeltsin and Milosevic.
	   But Cohen warned that NATO's dim view of the crackdown in Kosovo
not be taken too lightly.
	   The NATO alliance agrees ``the bloodshed has to stop; that very
strong message has to be sent to Mr. Milosevic that he has to cease
and desist the slaughter, the shelling of villages and killing of
innocent people and to resolve this peacefully,'' Cohen said.
	   ``We're sending a signal that ... an air exercise will
demonstrate that we have the capacity to mobilize very quickly and
demonstrate rapidly deployable power. But secondly, it also
demonstrates there is solidarity of support and consensus
throughout NATO and beyond NATO itself,'' Cohen said.
	   Cohen met for 45 minutes with the Russian at NATO headquarters
in Brussels. Gen. Hugh Shelton, the chairman of the U.S. Joint
Chiefs of Staff, also attended.
	   It came a day after the NATO alliance approved a show-of-force
air exercise over Yugoslav neighbors Albania and Macedonia. NATO
also ordered options be drawn up for possible intervention in
Kosovo, including direct air strikes or the use of ground troops.
	   NATO Secretary General Javier Solana said Thursday that Russia
told the alliance it would not participate in NATO's plans for an
air exercise. The alliance hopes the show of military strength can
persuade Milosevic to halt attacks on ethnic Albanian separatists
in Kosovo.
	   ``We would like to have as many partners as possible participate
in the exercise,'' Solana said.
	   Russia, which has been brought into some NATO consultations, had
been kept informed of plans for potential military exercises in the
Balkans and at one time had ``showed an interest in
participating,'' Solana said.
	   Moscow favors strengthened control over Kosovo's borders with
Albania and Macedonia. Russia could play a pivotal role in
persuading Milosevic to turn around the crisis in the
independence-minded province of Serbia, Yugoslavia's dominant
republic.
	   On Thursday, NATO ministers approved a package they hope will
persuade Milosevic to pull back his Serb-led army and police forces
in the province.
	   ``President Milosevic would be rash and foolish if he would
ignore the message coming from NATO,'' said British Defense
Secretary George Robertson. ``The message is clear and unambiguous:
`Belgrade, think again.'''
	   Under the measures, NATO will conduct simulated air attacks in
Albania and Macedonia, probably next week, and study options for
further action ranging from accelerated planning for military
exercises to direct air strikes inside Yugoslavia and use of ground
troops.
	   This is aimed at persuading Milosevic to do three things:
declare a cease-fire in Kosovo; withdraw his forces and end the
repression of the ethnic Albanians; and open serious negotiations
with the opposition.
	   German Defense Minister Volker Ruehe said: ``We cannot afford
any longer to focus on hollow solutions of rather symbolic
character like border security missions in Albania or Macedonia.''
	   Added French Defense Minister Alain Richard: ``We can't let the
protagonists believe that we are prepared to stop at a certain
stage.''
	   More than 250 people have died in clashes between government
forces and the Kosovo Liberatie movement. Ethnic Albanians comprise
90 percent of the province's population.

New Zealand needs 296 runs for victory

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with details at the end of the third day's play. No

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ In a crucial third and final test, New
Zealand Friday faced a daunting target of 296 runs for victory
against host Sri Lanka.
	   After bowling Sri Lanka out for 282 runs in its second innings,
Sri Lanka batted cautiously and scored 10 without loss at close of
play on the third day.
	   New Zealand won the first cricket test and Sri Lanka leveled the
three-test series in the second test.
	   The home team, batting a second time with a 13 run lead on first
innings, got out half an hour before the day's scheduled close at
the Sinhalese Sports Club stadium.
	   Sri Lanka's total was boosted mainly through two half centuries
by Arjuna Ranatunga (64) and Romesh Kaluwitharana (88).
Kaluwitharana struck 8 fours in 146 balls, and defied the New
Zealanders in a last wicket stand of 71 runs with Muttiah
Muralitheran, who was unbeaten on 26.
	   Ranatunga in his role as skipper sustained the Sri Lankan
innings in the face of a collapse, taking the total from 36 for 4
and leaving the crease after a 102 run alliance for the fifth
wicket with Hashan Tillekeratne (40).
	   Ranatunga had nine fours in his knock which came in 96
deliveries. The Sri Lankan skipper was particularly harsh on the
spinners but in a lapse of concentration stepped out to hit Mark
Priest, only to drive the ball into the hands of Chris Cairns at
mid off.
	   Left arm spinner Daniel Vettori took a career best 6 for 64 to
dismiss Sri Lanka for 282. Sharing the new ball with Chris Cairns,
Vettori stepped into action as early as his second over when he
claimed the wicket of Marvan Atapattu who was trapped leg before
for 5.
	   The 19 year old Vettori then got rid of Mahela Jayawardena for
11 and Aravinda de Silva for 3, making Sri Lanka face trouble at 36
for 4. Cairns earlier put New Zealand in front by making Sanath
Jayasuriya touch a moving delivery only to be caught behind by a
diving Adam Parore in front of first slip. Jayasuriya made just 8
runs.
	   Vettori improved on a previous best of 5 for 84, also against
Sri Lanka at Hamilton, New Zealand in 1996-1997. Vettori also
accounted for middle order batsman Hashan Tillekeratne who was
bowled by a full length ball for 40.
	   His last two wickets were that of tail enders Pramodya
Wickremasinghe for a duck, and Niroshan Bandaratilleke for 7.

EU urges Nigeria return to democracy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The European Union on Friday urged the new
government in Nigeria to move quickly to elect a civilian
government.
	   ``The EU welcomes Gen. (Abdulsalam) Abubakar's call to all
Nigerians to join in a process of reconstruction and
reconciliation,'' said the statement issued by Britain's Foreign
Office on behalf of the 15-nation European Union.
	   ``This, together with the release of detainees and the
restoration of the rule of law would be important steps in a
process leading to Nigeria's return to its rightful place in the
international community.''

	   SHOEMAKER and coffee shop operator Prime Success International
Group will continue to expand its retail business on the mainland
this year by opening up to 220 more outlets.
	   Prime Success will be able to post satisfactory profit growth in
the first four months of this year, managing director Keeper H M
Chen said yesterday.
	   However, he admitted total orders of OEM (original equipment
manufacturing) footwear from Japan would fall 2 per cent this year
as the economy slowed.
	   To reach a 70 per cent sales growth target in retail business
this year, Prime Success plans to open 220 more outlets this year
throughout the mainland.
	   The new shops will be comprise of directly owned outlets,
associates, franchises and agents. The firm already has 580
mainland outlets.
	   The footwear retail and wholesale business made up 50 per cent
of the company's sales last year.
	   ``Compared to the wholesale business, the retail business can
provide a better profit margin for the company,'' said Mr Chen.
	   He added that the margin for footwear was on average 27 per
cent.
	   The company is also considering joining a footwear production
project in Shanghai.
	   ``We are still in a discussion but we hope to finalise a deal
this year,'' said Mr Chen.
	   The company plans to open 15 coffee shops this year, bringing
the total to 200 by the year 2005.
	   Mr Chen expects the turnover in each coffee shop to reach US$5
million (HK$39 million).
	   Under the company's expansion plan, a total of 600 coffee shops
will be opened in Japan and 82 in Taiwan.
	   Mr Chen said negotiations are underway for the opening of
outlets in Beijing, Tianjin and Nanjing.

Shortfall of 6,200 tickets for World Cup reported in Japan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese travel agents say they are short 6,200
tickets for the national team's World Cup match against Argentina
on Sunday, a news report said Friday.
	   The Kyodo News agency report, citing the Japan Association of
Travel Agents, said that 14,700 soccer fans had reserved and paid
for tours to France for Japan's opening match.
	   Several of the tours were canceled Thursday because thousands of
tickets had not been delivered before fans were to leave for the
games, meaning that the number of fans needing tickets had dropped
to 9,500.
	   JATA said Friday that travel agents reported they had received a
total of 3,300 tickets to the match _ leaving another 6,200
Japanese without the tickets they had paid for.
	   For Japan's second match against Croatia on June 20 in Nantes,
the association said travel agents had received an additional 120
tickets, but added that they do not expect that number to increase
much.
	   Ticket shortages are also being reported in a number of
countries other than Japan and some have reportedly blamed the
World Cup organizers for not providing enough tickets to the
official agents.
	   The organizers, however, have denied they were responsible for
Japan's ticket trouble, suggesting that Japanese travel agents
which had ordered tickets from unauthorized agents might have been
tricked.
	   Also Friday, the Football Association of Japan was quoted by
Kyodo as saying it will sell tickets for Japan's matches if the
team advances beyond the first round-robin.
	   The association will offer the tickets, which will be allocated
by the World Cup organizing committee, as part of a tour package
for Japan's first match in the final round.
	   The shortage of tickets has outraged people in Japan. Incensed
fans at Tokyo's Narita International Airport on Thursday shouted at
tour company representatives and demanded an explanation for the
missing tickets.

	   DESPITE a slowdown in the construction sector, Pahang Cement Sdn
Bhd does not anticipate any difficulty in looking for markets for
its product.
	   Menteri Besar Tan Sri Mohd Khalil Yaakob said yesterday that
this was because the cement plant in Bukit Sagu, about 50km from
Kuantan, was also orientated towards the export market.
	   He said Pahang Cement, a 50:50 joint venture between the State
Government and YTL Cement Bhd, was eyeing the Vietnam, Cambodia and
Laos markets.
	   The Pahang Government's equity is held by Pasdec Corporation Sdn
Bhd (33.3 per cent) and State Secretary Incorporated (16.7 per
cent).
	   As for the domestic market, Khalil said there would be
continuous demand for the product as it was the only cement plant
serving the eastern industrial corridor.
	   Speaking to reporters after checking on the preparations for the
official opening of the RM700 million cement plant by Prime
Minister Datuk Seri Dr Mahathir Mohamad tomorrow, Khalil said the
cement plant was a viable venture.
	   The cement plant project was mooted in the early 1970s by the
then Prime Minister Tun Abdul Razak Hussein. Pahang Cement Sdn Bhd
was incorporated on Aug 5, 1971 by the State Government.
	   The joint-venture agreement to implement the project was signed
between the State Government and YTL Cement in 1993.
	   Limestone deposits around the Bukit Sagu plant are enough to
cater for the company's operation for the next 70 years, if it
continues to operate on a single production line.
	   The plant, which has a capacity of 1.2 million tonnes per annum,
was commissioned in July last year.

Cambodian commission certifies 39 parties to run in election
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodia's National Election
Committee announced Friday that all 39 registered political parties
have officially qualified to contest the elections scheduled for
July 26.
	   Kassie Nou, vice chairman of the committee, said the official
approval was granted after all the parties fulfilled all
requirements stated in electoral law.
	   Those approved include the FUNCINPEC party of deposed Co-Premier
Prince Norodom Ranariddh, the main rival to the country's
strongman, Hun Sen, and his Cambodian People's Party.
	   Hun Sen has tried to place as many obstacles as possible in the
path of his rival, and the election committee is widely considered
to have been handpicked to favor Hun Sen's party.
	   One threat that has been hanging over Ranariddh's head is that
he would be barred from running under a statute of the political
party law that prohibits any party from fielding its own
independent army and controlling an autonomous piece of territory.
	   When Ranariddh was deposed by Hun Sen in a coup d'etat last
July, some of the prince's loyalists formed a resistance force and
settled into an enclave on Cambodia's northern border.
	   Government troops failed to dislodge them, and negotiations to
have them rejoin the national army have so far not been successful.
	   ``All 39 parties have met the requirement, so did the FUNCINPEC
party,'' Kassie Nou said. ``What we decided was based on electoral
law, we don't deal with the political party law.''
	   He also said that the period during which objections could be
lodged with the committee had expired, so any future complaints
about political parties should be forwarded to the government, not
the committee.
	   A committee official said Thursday that the number of eligible
Cambodians who have registered to vote in July's election has
surpassed the 80 percent mark and is expected to top 90 percent
when the registration process ends next week.
	   In three weeks of registration, nearly 4 million people, or
80.45 percent of the 5.6 million people eligible to vote, had
already received voting cards, said Prum Nhean Vichet.

Taiwan tells Beijing to note U.S. support
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS in 9th graf that Bush was last U.S. president to
visit China, sted Reagan. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ China should take note of U.S. popular
support for Taiwan if it wants U.S. President Bill Clinton's
upcoming Beijing visit to be a success, government officials said
Friday.
	   ``The American people wish China to give up the threat of force
and start using peace as a frame of reference for discussion of the
issues between the sides,'' said Sheu Ke-sheng, vice chairman of
the cabinet's Mainland Affairs Council.
	   ``China needs to clearly understand U.S. views on Taiwan,'' he
added.
	   Sheu said recent resolutions in the U.S. Congress and remarks by
Clinton highlight the U.S.'s overwhelming determination to see
China and Taiwan resolve their differences peacefully.
	   Respect for those views is crucial to a successful and
constructive summit with Clinton, Sheu said.
	   Sheu was speaking at a weekly news conference.
	   Foreign Ministry spokesman Roy Wu told reporters Taiwanese
officials have publicly appealed to China to resume talks on 114
separate occasions.
	   ``I think this adequately proves our side's desire to resolve
the issues in a peaceful, rational matter,'' Wu said at a weekly
news conference.
	   Clinton begins the first state visit to China by a U.S.
president since George Bush on June 25. U.S. committments on Taiwan
are expected to be among the issues that China will raise during
talks.
	   Washington cut diplomatic relations with Taiwan in 1979 in order
to recognize China. But the United States retains strong unofficial
ties with Taiwan, and remains its main weapons supplier.
	   Clinton on Thursday said he wished to encourage China and Taiwan
to restart talks broken off by Beijing in 1995. The House of
Representatives on Tuesday passed a non-binding resolution by a
margin of 411 to 0 calling on Clinton to urge China to drop its
threat of force against Taiwan.
	   Though united with the mainland for just four of the last 100
years, Taiwan is still considered by China as a breakaway province
to eventually be reunited with. Beijing broke off negotiations on
investment protection and other issues in anger over Taiwanese
President Lee Teng-hui's June 1995 visit to the United States.
	   China considered Lee's trip the strongest indication yet that he
was seeking formal independence for Taiwan, a contention Taiwan's
Nationalist Party government denies.

	   TAIPING, Thurs. - In a bid to get rid of transvestites who mar
the town's image because of their indecent behaviour at the scenic
Taiping Lake Gardens, the Taiping Municipal Council will install
brighter lights at their popular haunts.
	   Larut Matang and Selama assistant district officer Mohd Sabri
Yusoff, who is also the deputy chairman of the LMS committee to
tackle social problems, said certain irresponsible elements had
used catapults to smash the streetlights.
	   ``The new bright lights hopefully will deter vice activities,''
he said, adding that the indecently dressed transvestites harassed
visitors to the gardens.
	   Mohd Sabri said 10 transvestites had so far been picked up in
three raids conducted recently at the gardens.
	   Meanwhile, Mohd Sabri said 75 people, including 22 students,
were also picked up during the raids to clean up the town's sleazy
image.
	   He said the raids were conducted yesterday and on May 23 and May
30 by 35 officers from the various government departments and
agencies in the district.
	   They included the police, Perak Islamic Religious Department,
Taiping Municipal Council, LMS Education Department, Youth and
Sports Department and the LMS district office.
	   Mohd Sabri said the raids were also conducted at the Taiping bus
terminal, mini-cinemas, pubs and karaoke centres.
	   Some of the couples detained for khalwat were handed over to the
Perak Islamic Religious Department to be charged under the
Enactment for Indecent Behaviour in Public Places.
	   Mohd Sabri said if found guilty under the enactment, the couples
could be fined RM1,000 or face six months' jail.

U.N. war crimes tribunal to send investigators to Kosovo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ The Yugoslav war crimes tribunal
said Friday it is sending investigators to the troubled Serbian
province of Kosovo to check out reports of possible atrocities.
	   Details of the visit, to take place in the coming weeks, were
not disclosed. Tribunal chief prosecutor Louise Arbour said the
U.N. court's investigation aimed to ``send an appropriate signal to
both belligerents the necessity that they obey by the laws and
customs of war.''
	   The investigation has been backed by the United States, said
David Scheffer, the roving U.S. ambassador for war crimes issues.
	   ``We've been extremely focused on the role the tribunal can and
might be able to play in investigating what appears to be very
serious criminal activities taking place in Kosovo,'' he said.
	   Ethnic Albanians, who comprise 90 percent of the southern
province's population, are demanding independence from Serbia.
	   More than 250 people have died during clashes between government
forces and the Kosovo Liberation Army, the armed wing of the
Albanian independence movement.
	   Scheffer added it is ``imperative'' that Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic provides all the necessary authorization to
allow investigators into the province.
	   ``It has been delayed for too long and it is indicative of his
(Milosevic) entire approach to the issue,'' said Scheffer, who was
attending the inauguration ceremony of the tribunal's third
courtroom.
	   Arbour said there are clear indications that an armed conflict
is in progress in Kosovo, and the tribunal has jurisdiction to
prosecute perpetrators of possible war crimes.
	   The tribunal was established by the U.N. Security Council in
1993, and its jurisdiction covers all serious violations of
international humanitarian law committed in the former Yugoslavia
since 1991.
	   Work at the tribunal has intensified as the number of suspects
in custody increased almost threefold in the last seven months,
said Judge Gabrielle Kirk McDonald in her speech during the
inauguration ceremony.
	   The third court, funded by the U.S. and Dutch governments, aims
to ease the ``judicial congestion'' at the court.
	   The U.N. court has issued some 20 public indictments against 59
people, plus a number of sealed indictments. There are 27 suspects
in custody.
	   Its top suspects are former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic
and his wartime military chief, Gen. Ratko Mladic, indicted but
both still at large.
	   ``We strive to establish as judicial fact the full details of
the madness that transpired in the former Yugoslavia,'' said
McDonald.
	   ``By recording the capacity for evil in all of us, we hope that
in the future we will recognize the warning signs and act with
sufficient speed and determination to prevent such bloodshed,'' she
added.
	   Meanwhile, a four-member Bosnian Serb delegation headed by two
deputy prime ministers left Banja Luka on Friday to visit Bosnian
Serb suspects being held in the tribunal's cell block here.

World Cup: Iranian team has big impact on quiet French town
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANWAR FARUQI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   YSSINGEAUX, France (AP) - In this quiet little town in the heart
of France where the church bell tolls the hours and Paris is as far
as most residents have ever traveled, the arrival of Iran's World
Cup team has been something of a foreign invasion.
	   None of the residents have seen the players since they arrived
Sunday in this town of 7,000. They are holed up under tight
security in a 19th century chateau that is now a famous pastry
school.
	   But in town, posters of the team and paper Iranian flags are
plastered on every shop window, at the bookstore one can buy a
video of ``Iran's remarkable women'' and boarding houses are full
of journalists and drivers for the Iranians. At the local
laundromat the red-white and green uniforms of the players are
going through the spin cycle.
	   At the town hall, a bus load of curious senior citizens inspect
the month-long exhibition of precious Persian carpets and
handicrafts. Some buy the poems of Omar Khayyam translated into
French, or leaf through books by other Iranian poets and writers.
	   The show kicked off with an Iranian movie and a discussion by
Shahla Sherkat, an Iranian woman journalist, and will close June 17
with an Iranian dinner, a concert and poetry recitation.
	   The Iranians wanted a quiet place where their players could be
protected from Western influences. Local women, such as media
coordinators, were asked to dress modestly in the presence of
players.
	   ``We wanted to put Yssingeaux on the map, and having a World Cup
team stay here was the best way of doing it,'' said the town's
deputy mayor, Jacques Barrot.
	   Yssingeaux is not the only small town in France with an Iranian
connection. Nearly 20 years ago the small town of Neauphle le
Chateau near Paris was the last home of the late Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini before he returned to Iran to lead the Islamic revolution
that overthrow the U.S.-supported shah.
	   ``Some people like the Iranians here, and others don't. That's
just the way the French are,'' said Jean-Claude Rerole, proprietor
of the Cactus Sports shop in Yssingeaux. ``I, for one, think it's
very, very good for the town.''
	   The Iranians have brought business, but some residents don't
like the foreigners with their strange customs, and the media
invasion.
	   When Sherkat, the Iranian woman journalist, walked into town in
the Islamic head-dress that all women in Iran must wear by law,
heads turned and tongues wagged.
	   Iran's bad name in the West hasn't exactly helped.
	   Several Iranian dissidents have been assassinated in France
since the Iranian revolution, with the Tehran government thought to
have been behind the killings. As recently as 1996, Reza Mazlouman,
deputy education minister under the shah, was shot dead under
mysterious circumstances in Paris.
	   Even the woman on the cover of the video selling in Yssingeaux,
Iranian Vice President Massoumeh Ebtekar, was the strident
interpreter and spokeswoman for the militants who stormed the U.S.
Embassy in Tehran in 1979 and held 52 Americans hostage for 444
days.
	   Ever since Iran's moderate president, Mohammad Khatami, took
over as president last August, Iran has been trying to change its
international image. Iran's drive in Yssingeaux is part of that
effort.
	   ``We wanted to sow the seeds of Iranian goodwill in the heart of
France, in a virgin place like this town where it would grow,''
said Mohammad Navah, organizer of the exhibition in Yssingeaux.

	   PASIR MAS, Thurs. - Two children drowned while playing in a padi
field near Kampung Pangkal Danan, Kedondong, yesterday.
	   They were identified as Mohd Farizal Zulkifli, 7, and his
four-year-old cousin Mohd Rosdan Rosli.
	   District police chief Acting Superintendent Jalil Talib said the
children went with their grandfather Mustafa Yusuf, 57, about
9.30am.
	   ``Mohd Farizal and Mohd Rosdan followed Mustafa to the padi
field to catch fish,'' he said, adding that the children were left
alone when Mustafa returned to his house, 200 metres away, about
half an hour later.
	   Jalil said Mustafa found the boys missing when he returned to
the padi field about 30 minutes later.
	   He said villagers, who helped in the search for the boys, found
their bodies near the area where they were reported missing.
	   ``Their bodies were found about 11am in a drain which had three
metres of water near the padi field,'' he said.
	   In Kuantan, the body of a 15-year-old boy who drowned while
fishing at Sungai Semantan, Mentakab, yesterday was found this
morning.
	   Pahang Criminal Investigation Department chief Assistant
Commissioner Sulaiman Mahmud said the body of Ang Chi Seng of Taman
Bukit Bendera in Mentakab was recovered by police at about 11am.
	   The victim's mother Lan Kam Hong, 36, lodged a report at the
Mentakab police station.
	   She told police that Ang, a Form Three pupil had skipped school
to go fishing at the river yesterday.

	   SLALEY, England (AP) _ Officials of the rain-delayed European
Grand Prix went to unusual lengths Friday to start play.
	   All first-round play Thursday was washed out.
	   On Friday, after waiting until mid-afternoon for the rain to
stop, play began with the Slaley Hall course reconfigured to a
par-69 instead of the usual par-72.
	   Officials reduced the pars on the 12th, 13th and 18th holes. The
tees on those three were brought forward to assure tee shots would
clear bog-like areas on the fairways.
	   Rain and daylight permitting, officials said they planned to
play 18 holes on Friday and Saturday with a 36-hole final on Sunday
in the 650,000-pound (dlrs 1.06 million) European event.

	   KOTA KINABALU, Thurs. - A new headquarters for the Sabah Road

	   Finance Minister SAMS Kibria has proposed new measures in the
budget to resolve problems of sick industries.
	   He has proposed to issue bonds worth Tk 60 crore to compensate
the government-owned banks which will sustain losses arising out of
settlement of loans cases of sick industries.
	   The Finance Minister told Parliament yesterday that the problems
of the sick industries previously identified and listed by the
government would come under the purview of the new initiative.
	   Under it a borrower's case having up to Tk 50 lakh loans from
any government-owned bank would be considered by a special
committee to be set up. It would be headed by a retired judge.
	   The Finance Minister said the committee taking into
consideration the condition of a sick industry, previous relief, if
any, financial capacity, honesty and reputation of the concerned
borrowers would recommend a solution. It would have the power to
give remission of interest and penal interest of up to 100 per
cent.
	   The government would reimburse 50 per cent of the losses of
banks in such cases. The amount of money that the committee would
determine and the borrower would be asked to pay would be payable
in three years in not more than 36 monthly instalments.
	   In cases having loans of more than Tk 50 lakh, the compromise
would be arrived at based on the bank-client relationship in the
light of some broad guidelines.
	   Sponsors of those sick industries could also submit proposals
for rehabilitation of sick industries if there were prospects of
turning those sick industries into profitable ones.
	   The Finance Minister said that all government committees
relating to sick industries would be abolished once all decisions
relating to this initiative were implemented.

	   The education sector is the highest recipient of the new budget
for fiscal 1998-99 with proposed increase of 9.4 per cent over the
revised allocation of the outgoing year.
	   In the new budget, allocation for the education sector has been
proposed to be raised to Tk 4596.14 crore against Tk 4199.98 crore
of the revised budget for 1997-98.

	   ``For the first time in the history of Bangladesh, the majority
of the people are literate,'' he said amidst cheers from treasury
benches.
	   Kibria said the subvention for the salaries of the registered
and aided school teachers was revised for the first time along with
the revision of pay scale of the government employees.
	   The rate of subventions of teachers in the registered private
primary schools will be revised upward next fiscal year.
	   The Finance Minister proposed to raise the allocation for
libraries from Tk 2 crore to Tk 3 crore and for the scientific
laboratories equipment from Tk 3 crore to Tk 5 crore.

Albanian militants kill Serb policemen near Kosovo capital

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with fighting resuming in Decani region. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Ethnic Albanian militants, boldly
stepping up their attacks, killed two Serb policemen just a few
miles from Kosovo's capital and on Friday promised to come out of
their shadowy underground and show they are a mass organization.
	   Fighting between Serbian forces and the militants also erupted
again in the Decani region in western Kosovo, close to the border
with Albania. It was a Serbian offensive there last week that
prompted NATO Thursday to announce a show of air power to try and
persuade Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to halt such
assault.
	   Ethnic Albanian sources claimed that six villages in the Decani
area were under attack, including from grenade launchers normally
issued not to Serbian police, but to the Yugoslav army.
	   There was no independent confirmation of their report, but the
state-run Tanjug news agency in Belgrade reported that a Serb
policeman was seriously hurt in what it called an attack by ``armed
Albanian terrorists'' near one of the villages, Prilep.

	   The proposed defence allocation in the national budget for
1998-99 is about 13.38 per cent more than the outgoing fiscal year.
	   The net allocation for defence was Tk 2457.53 crore in 1997-98
while in the new budget for 1998-99, Tk 2786.43 crore has been
proposed for the sector, an increase of 13.38 per cent.
	   In the revised budget for FY 1997-98, the allocation was
increased to Tk 2600.8 crore.
	   However, the total budget for the Defence Ministry stands at Tk
2902.27 crore, including the allocations for Department of
Meteorology, Survey Department, SPARRSO, Freedom Fighters' Welfare
Trust, Cadet Colleges and Defence Division.
	   Total defence expenditure constitutes about 1.8 per cent of GDP
in 1998-99 fiscal.
	   To justify the increase, the Finance Minister in his budget
speech quoted the Human Development Report, 1997 as showing that
the average defence spending in all developing countries in 1995
stood at 3.1 per cent of GDP.
	   The defence expenditure as share of GDP in Bangladesh is less
than that of India (2.5 per cent), Pakistan (6.5 per cent) and Sri
Lanka (4.9 per cent).
	   Underscoring the point of internal security, Kibria proposed an
allocation of Tk 675.46 crore for the police force in 1998-99. It
was Tk 646.11 crore in the revised budget for 1997-98.
	   The annual budget for police has been raised by 30 per cent
compared to the allocation in the revised budget of FY 1995-96.

Crippled during Abacha years, Nigerian opposition keeps fighting

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with police breaking up pockets of protesters with
tear gas; Edits throughout to conform and delete outdated

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Firing canisters of tear gas into the air,
riot police dispersed groups of protesters in Nigeria's commercial
capital Friday before the activists could converge for a mass
demonstration.
	   In the Yaba district on the city's north side, several vehicles
filled with riot police roared into position to block about 300
protesters from marching toward the area's main bus terminal.
	   Firing bullets into the air and tear gas at the crowd, the
police sent the demonstrators scurrying for cover.
	   Another group of between 500 and 600 anti-military activists
were dispersed with tear gas, witnesses said.
	   Their strength ravaged by years of government harassment, their
leaders in prison or exile, Nigeria's opposition movement defiantly
tried to pressed ahead Friday with plans a pro-democracy rally _
the first major test of the new military regime of Gen. Abdulsalam
Abubakar.
	   Elsewhere in Lagos, troops packed into transport trucks fired
their rifles into the air as their convoy rumbled through one
district of town, prompting residents to run to safety.
	   About 15 kilometers (10 miles) west of Lagos, a crowd of
students from the Lagos State College of Education clashed briefly
with police after running into the streets and setting tires on
fire, witnesses said.
	   Lagos Police Commissioner Abubakar Tsav said in a published
statement that protesters ``will be seriously dealt with.''
	   Fearing violence, the normally cluttered congestion of morning
traffic had fallen off to a trickle of vehicles as many people
stayed home to avoid a confrontation.
	   Early in the morning, about 60 youths marched through one Lagos
neighborhood, handing out pro-democracy leaflets and heading toward
a major bus terminal.
	   Some carried a large banner reading ``The Struggle Continues.
The Military Must Go. Abiola For President.''
	   Friday's protests were organized months ago to mark the
five-year anniversary of the annulment of the country's last
presidential elections on June 12, 1993, and to call for freedom
for Moshood Abiola, the imprisoned billionaire businessmen who is
believed to have won that vote.
	   But the demonstrations have taken on added significance, coming
just a few days after Abubakar was appointed leader of this
oil-rich but poverty-stricken West African country following the
heart attack death Monday of dictator Gen. Sani Abacha.
	   Key opposition leaders say with Abacha's death, now the entire
military leadership must relinquish its hold on the country.
	   ``Abubakar is becoming the reincarnation of Abacha,'' said Gani
Fawehinmi, a Lagos lawyer and anti-military activist leading the
call for protests.
	   He said expected few changes from Abubakar, who has already
infuriated the opposition by offering only a vague pledge to move
forward with Abacha's flawed democratic reform program.
	   Police sealed off some roads leading to the Lagos district of
Yaba, where opposition groups had hoped to converge for a mass
demonstration rally.
	   Clusters of police and army troops loitered along street corners
and key intersections in the city as they waited to see if the
demonstrations went ahead.
	   The authorities in the past have shown no reluctance to use
heavy force, including tear gas and machine gun fire to quell
protests in Nigeria.
	   Abacha's regime hobbled Nigeria's opposition movement with
brutal efficiency, arresting, imprisoning and torturing many
opposition leaders _ or driving them into exile.
	   These days, many demonstrations only attract a few hundred
protesters and strike calls are often completely ignored.
	   Trying to head off trouble ahead of Friday's rallies, the
government closed a Lagos technical college and a university and
shut down all primary and secondary schools in Lagos and Kwara
states, both important regions to the opposition movement.

	   Former Finance Minister AMA Muhit termed the proposed budget for
the 1998-99 fiscal a good one but he said that one would need to
scrutinise the budget documents in detail in order to make specific
comments on the proposed budget.
	   ``As I listened to the budget, it appeared to be a good one,''
Muhit told The Independent immediately after the budget speech of
the Finance Minister yesterday evening.
	   ``The taxation proposals are basically sound. It aims at
simplification of direct tax, reduction and rationalisation of
import tax, expansion of VAT coverage and higher realisation of
supplementary duties,'' the former Finance Minister said.
	   ``I am particularly happy for the attention paid to information
technology and energy development,'' Muhit said in his instant
reaction on the proposed budget, adding: ``We have at least a
status report on energy sector although the outlook is not very
comfortable.''
	   ``The budget has been cleverly presented. There is no specific
statement on supplementary budget of last year (1997-98). There is
also very little on banking and money matters,'' he said.
	   ``The emphasis placed by the Finance Minister on the troubles of
the nationalised industries is interesting,'' Muhit remarked and
said: ``We do not, however, have a clear target of privatisation,
nor is there any special emphasis on activating the domestic
demand.
	   ``Estimates of public expenditure for the last year (1997-98) is
not consistent with shortfall in revenue generation and aid
spending,'' he said.
	   Asked what the impact of the new budget on the country's
investment scenario would be, the former Finance Minister said:
``Taxation policies will obviously have some impact on investment.
But I would have expected a more elaborate treatment of the subject
of domestic investment.''
	   The efforts to bring out untaxed money for investment are also
not too bold or robust, Muhit added.

	   Country's foreign exchange reserve has risen by a meagre margin
of .073 billion to 1.680 billion US dollars in one year to June 1.
	   Finance Minister Shah AMS Kibria disclosed this in his 1998-99
annual budget speech in the Jatiya Sangsad yesterday.
	   On June 1, 1998, total forex reserves in Bangladesh Bank stood
at 1.680 billion dollar from 1.607 billion on the day in 1997.
	   ``This improvement was attained in the reserve position of
Bangladesh despite highly unfavourable international climate,'' the
Minister told the Parliament.
	   He said before the assumption of office by the present
government, there had been a sudden fall in the foreign exchange
reserves in 1995-96 fiscal year.
	   From June 30, 1995 to June 30, 1996, total reserve had plummeted
from 3.07 billion to 2.03 billion dollars, Kibria said, pointing to
the massive slide amid a political turmoil at the fag-end of the
previous regime.
	   But, he said, the present government had to ``endeavour very
hard in last two years to arrest this fast depletion of reserves''.

	   The Finance Minister, Shah AMS Kibria, presenting the budget for
1998-99 in Parliament yesterday proposed that investment of
undisclosed money (black money) in buying primary and secondary
shares in the capital market would be allowed without asking any
question about its source.
	   But the investors would be required to pay 7.5 per cent tax and
the investors would have to retain these shares at least for one
year.
	   The budget proposed exemption of tax on income from mutual
funds. It would be applicable to all mutual funds established and
operated in the private sector. At present such exemption is
enjoyed only by the Investment Corporation of Bangladesh (ICB).
	   The budget sought to remove discrimination in regard to the
corporate income tax. At present income of the publicly traded
companies is taxed at 35 per cent and non-publicly traded companies
at 40 per cent.
	   But there are some banks, insurance companies, financial
institutions and non-resident companies which do public trading and
yet are taxed at 40 per cent. The budget proposed 35 per cent tax
on this category of companies.
	   The budget also proposed that companies enjoying tax holiday
which declare dividends would be required to invest 30 per cent of
such exempted income in government securities or in the same
industry.
	   It said the mandatory investment of the dividend might be made
during the tax holiday period or within one year from the expiry of
the tax holiday period.
	   The budget proposed 10 per cent deduction of tax at source on
the dividend earned by individual tax payers from investment in
corporate bodies. This would be treated as the final settlement of
the tax liability.

	   Inflation has shot up to 6.63 per cent from last year's rate of
2.51 per cent, according to the reckoning presented by the Finance
Minister in Parliament yesterday, reports APB.
	   The rate was calculated in the new index as in April 1998. The
old index, however, shows the inflation rate at 6.28 per cent.
	   In June 1997, the rate was 2.51 per cents. In June 1996,
however, the rate was much higher, 6.65 per cent, Finance Minister
Shah AMS Kibria said in his budget speech.
	   ``According to experts, the current inflationary pressure is due
to unexpected shortfall in Aman production,'' the Minister told the
House, assigning the reasons for the growing inflation, which
causes rise in prices.
	   The Finance Minister hoped that after boro and wheat harvest the
inflation rate would decline.

Santer tells Kohl not to turn EU budget reform into election issue
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBERT WIELAARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ European Commission President Jacques
Santer urged German Chancellor Helmut Kohl Friday not to make
European Union budget reform an election issue in the Sept. 27
German elections.
	   ``We must have an objective debate'' about new funding for the
EU to enable it to absorb 11 newcomers, he said.
	   ``We must not bring electioneering arguments into this debate.''
	   At a press conference, Santer did not name Germany but his
target was evident. Germany wants to close the gap between what it
pays into the EU and what it gets back. German officials insist
their net payment be cut from 22 billion marks (dlrs 12.2 billion)
to 7 billion marks (dlrs 3.9 billion) annually.
	   Others say such demands are unreasonable at a time when the EU
plans to take in Cyprus and 10 East European nations, all of them
than current EU members and expecting help to catch up.
	   The money dispute will figure on the agenda of an EU summit next
Monday and Tuesday in Cardiff, Wales, along with foreign issues
such as Kosovo and the deteriorating Russian economy and the
recession in Japan. The summit ends after a lunch with South
African Nelson Mandela as a farewell to a leader who is to step
down next year.
	   EU budget reform has been a topic of debate in the union since
last July.
	   However, talks have gone nowhere with Germany and the
Netherlands _ another net payer _ insisting on austerity while
poorer countries such as Spain, Portugal and Greece demand
``solidarity'' from their partners.
	   The issue is crucial to Kohl whose Christian Democrat-Liberal
alliance faces an uphill struggle to get reelected. It is keen to
show voters it wants an EU that is affordable and more
people-friendly.
	   In a joint letter to British Prime Minister, and summit host,
Tony Blair he and French President Jacques Chirac termed the EU an
ivory tower that issues edicts affecting the lives of 370 million
Europeans but is accountable to none.
	   They want to correct the ``tendency of some institutions to
distance themselves from citizens,'' a stab at the European
Commission, long the whipping boy of EU-bashers.
	   Blair has pledged to have ``an informal discussion of the future
development of the European Union, addressing in particular how we
can better meet the challenges we face while responding to citizens
concerns.''
	   Santer said the summit must reaffirm that EU budget reform is
wrapped up by next Spring. In a pre-summit letter to the EU
leaders, Blair agreed, saying they must give ``direction and
momentum to the negotiations.''
	   There is broad agreement the budget _ some dlrs 100 billion this
year, half of it devoted to subsidies for the EU's 10 million
farmers _ must be revamped.

or Taka 6,256 crore coming from the domestic resources.
	   The proposed size of ADP is 11.5 per cent higher than that of
the revised ADP of Taka 12,200 crore for the fiscal year 1997-98,
Finance Minister Shah AMS Kibria said while announcing the national
budget for the fiscal 1998-99 at the Jatiya Sangsad yesterday.
	   According to the proposed ADP outlay, 54 per cent of the
resources is expected to come from the external resources. This is
8.9 per cent higher than that of the external assistance of 1997-98
revised budget.
	   The highest-allocation in the proposed ADP went to transport
sector. A sum of Taka 1162.66 crore has been allocated for 87
projects of Roads and Highways directorate. Total allocation in ADP
for the Bangladesh Railway has been proposed at Taka 426.59 crore
while a sum of Taka 113 crore has been proposed for Inland Water
Transport sector. The ADP allocation for Bangabandhu Bridge project
is Taka 465 crore.
	   Education sector is the highest recipient of the combined
allocations of the revenue budget and the ADP. In the revised
budget of the fiscal 1997-98, total allocation stood at Taka
4199.98 crore. In fiscal 1998-99 it is proposed to raise to Taka
4596.14 crore. Total allocation for 1998-99 is 9.4 per cent higher
than that of the revised allocation for the fiscal 1997-98.
	   The proposed ADP for the next fiscal has allocated Taka 1373
crore in the fiscal 1998-99 in the health and family welfare sector
against Taka 1111.62 crore in the fiscal 1997-98.
	   In the proposed ADP an allocation of Taka 718.88 crore will go
to the crop subsector while the allocation of Taka 85.6 crore and
Taka 80 crore respectively will go to fisheries and livestock
sectors.
	   In the proposed ADP the total allocation for power sector stands
at Taka 1390 crore in the fiscal 1998-99 against the revised ADP
for 1997-98 at Taka 1252.50 crore.
	   Apart from power generation, this allocation will be available
for investment in transmission and distribution. About 32 per cent
of the total allocation for power sector will be spent for rural
electrification.
	   The external assistance to Bangladesh has been increased despite
the availability of concessional loan and grant worldwide is
decreasing.
	   It is expected that the range of World Bank's minimum annual
assistance to Bangladesh would be increased to US dollar 600 to 650
million US dollars as against US dollars 400 to 450 million in the
current fiscal.

	   LONDON (AP) _ The world's leading industrial nations, acting on
a U.S. proposal, decided Friday to deny loans to India and Pakistan
in retaliation for their nuclear tests.
	   Loans for humanitarian purposes would be excluded from the
boycott, the foreign ministers meeting to discuss the nuclear
crisis in South Asia decided.
	   A communique approved by the eight countries _ the United
States, Britain, France, Germany, Japan, Canada, Italy and Russia _
also urged India and Pakistan to halt their testing programs and
not to deploy nuclear weapons on their missiles.
	   Additionally, they were urged to deal with the ``root causes''
of tensions between them, especially over Kashmir, the mostly
Muslim enclave that straddles their border.
	   The joint steps were taken as India and Pakistan moved to hold
negotiations later in the month, a step welcomed by the U.S.
officials.
	   ``The recent nuclear tests have created an atmosphere of
regional instability which will undermine the region's
attractiveness to both foreign and domestic investment, damaging
business confidence and the prospect for economic growth,'' the
communique said.
	   The eight foreign ministers, as a group, said all countries
``should act as they see fit to demonstrate their displeasure and
address their concerns to India and Pakistan.''

World Cup: England hero Geoff Hurst to get knighthood
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: For release at 2300 GMT; adds quotes from Hurst &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Call him Sir Geoff.
	   Geoff Hurst, whose three goals earned England the 1966 World Cup
in the final against West Germany, receives a knightood Saturday
from Queen Elizabeth II.
	   The honor for the former West Ham star comes on the eve of
Monday's World Cup opener for England against Tunisia, 32 years
after Hurst brought England its one and only World Cup trophy.
	   Hurst, 56, is the only player to have scored a hat trick in the
championship game of the World Cup, although some believe that one
of his three goals in the 4-2 victory didn't cross the goal line.
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair urged current England players
to match Hurst's feat.
	   ``The prime minister, who has since met Mr. Hurst, remembers him
as one of his heroes when he watched the World Cup final in 1966,''
a Blair spokesman said. ``Perhaps this will spur on (Alan) Shearer,
(Michael) Owen and (Teddy) Sheringham to get hat tricks, too.''
	   Hurst described getting the news.
	   ``My wife opened the letter and then just passed it to me,'' he
said. ``It was a very tearful moment in the Hurst household.''
	   ``When you are my age, this comes as quite a shock,'' he added.
``When I was younger it seemed easier to absorb.''
	   Hurst is just one of many British sports figures on the queen's
Honors List.
	   Michael Bonallack, secretary of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club
of St. Andrews, also receives a knighthood.
	   The Order of the British Empire (OBE) goes to 1992 Olympic
hurdles champion Sally Gunnell, former Olympic and world 100-meter
champion Linford Christie, and Ian Peacock, chief executive of the
Lawn Tennis Association.
	   Among those receiving the Member of the British Empire (MBE) are
WBC heavyweight boxing champion Lennox Lewis, England cricket
captain Alec Stewart, former England soccer star John Barnes,
Scottish golfer Colin Montgomerie, golfer Alison Nicholas and
middle-distance runner Kelly Holmes

World Cup: Zdravkov preserves 0-0 draw
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; URGENT &QL; 
 &UR; By DUSAN STOJANOVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MONTPELLIER, France (AP) _ Bulgarian goalkeeper Zdravko Zdravkov
leapt high to his right to deny Paraguayan counterpart Jose Luis
Chilavert from converting a second-half 25-meter free kick, leaving
the two sides with a goalless draw in their World Cup opener
Friday.
	   The Bulgarians played the final two minutes with only 10 men
after Anatoli Nankov earned his second yellow. Paraguay had two
good chances following the sending off, but failed to convert.
	   Chilavert, famous for coming forward on set pieces and as an
extra attacker, curled a left-footed blast over the wall in the
78th minute, only to have Zdravkov punch away the shot as it
approached the crossbar.
	   Saudi referee Abdul Rahman Al-Zeid awarded the free kick when
Trifon Ivanov hauled down Paraguayan forward Jorge Campos.
	   Paraguay dominated the second half, getting several chances
before Chilavert's free kick.
	   Hristo Stoichkov set up the best Bulgarian opportunity in the
second half when he charged into the box from the left, crossed the
ball to an unmarked Luboslav Penev, who blasted high from six yards
with only Chilavert to beat.
	   The match was a game of missed opportunities.
	   Stoichkov hit the post in the 35th minute, beating two defenders
and knocking the ball off the upright with a left-footed shot which
had Chilavert totally beaten.
	   The Bulgarians, considered favorites in the Group D match,
opened up with several swift atacks and a shot by Kressimir Balakov
that just missed in the second minute.
	   Two minutes later, a Stoichkov was upended in the Paraguayan box
but his pleas to Al-Zeid went unheeded.
	   The Paraguayans rarely threatened the Bulgarian goal, taking 19
minutes before Carlos Morales' got their first shot, a free kick
that had to be stopped by Zdravko with a diving save.
	   Their best chance of the half came in the 40th minute when
forward Jose Cardoso was left all alone in the Bulgarian penalty
area, but his shot from 15 meters skidded wide of the right post.
	   Stoichkov was yellow-carded in injury time for a reckless
tackle.

Interfax said.
	   An official from the U.N. International Drug Control Program,
Bogdan Lisovich, who attended the burning in Tashkent, said
``public burning of drugs is a good example for all countries.''
	   Uzbekistan and other former Soviet republics in Central Asia
have become key routes for drug traffickers heading for Russia and
Western Europe. They lack the money to control their borders and
crack down on traffickers from Afghanistan, one of the world's main
opium producers.
	   The Uzbek Interior Ministry said more than 800 kilograms (1,760
pounds) of drugs, including 50 kilograms (110 pounds) of heroin,
have been seized in the first five months of this year.
	   On Friday, two drug traffickers were sentenced to death for
bringing 40 kilograms (88 pounds) of opium to Uzbekistan from
neighboring Tajikistan, Interfax said.
	   The opium was hidden in a truck carrying sacks of onions, said
Supreme Court Judge Saber Kadyrov. He said the court was
considering filing charges against Uzbek border guards.

	   A Division Bench of the High Court Division, of the Supreme
Court comprising Mr Justice K M Hasan and Mr Justice M Mohammad
Latifur Rahman on Thursday issued a rule challenging the legalities
of the practice of 'Safe Custody' whereby the innocent girls/women
are put in prison thereby violating their inalienable fundamental
rights as citizens in the name of their welfare, according to a
press release issued on Thursday by the Law Associates.
	   In the present case Mrs. Rokeya Kabir, Executive Director,
Bangladesh Nari Progati Sangstha filed a write petition on behalf
of Mosammet Ayesha Akhter (alias Dipali Pal Chowdhury), who is
detained in the Dhaka Central Jail in the guise of 'Safe Custody'
although she committed no crime nor is there any allegation of any
offence committed by her. Besides, she has not been charged with
any crime or offence whatsoever under the Penal Code or violation
or breach of any law in Bangladesh.
	   Dipali Pal, as claimed by her, being a mature person at her own
will embraced Islam, took the name Mosammet Ayesha Akhter and
married a Muslim boy. The angry father of Dipali, alias Ayesha
Akhter lodged a false FIR against the Muslim boy and his family.
Consequently, Ayesha's father-in-law, an old man of 70 was arrested
in connection with Sutrapur PS Case No. 36(3) 98. Thereafter, in
order to secure the release of her father-law-law, Ayesha
voluntarily surrendered to the Sutrapur Police on 11-5-98 and she
was produced before the Metropolitan Magistrate Court. However,
without being an accused or a witness in the FIR, she was sent to
Dhaka Central Jail in the guise of 'Safe Custody' where she is
experiencing immense misery.
	   Tania Amer, Barrister-at-law, the learned Advocate of The Law
Associates moved writ of Habeas Corpus in the High Court Division
for the Enforcement of Fundamental Rights.
	   Upon hearing Barrister Tania Amer, Advocate for the petitioner
and upon consideration of the said petition the Court issued a Rule
Nisi calling upon the respondents to show cause on or before 15th
June, 1998 as to why the direction should not be given upon the
respondents to produce Ayesha Akhter before the Court so that the
Court may satisfy itself that the said Ayesha Akhter (previously
Dipali Pal Chowdhury) is not held in custody without any lawful
authority and why a declaration should not be given that there is
no law in Bangladesh whereby any person, whether a major or a minor
or a female who is neither an alleged criminal nor a witness in the
FIR can be detained in jail by any Magistrate or any authority
under the guise of 'Judicial Safe Custody' or otherwise; and that
the practice of Safe Custody is violative of the jail code and no
one in jail shall be denied access to a lawyer of her own choice
and that there is no law in Bangladesh empowering any investigation
officer, or any other person to pray before any court to put a
victim girl in jail in the guise of Safe Custody, and that such
prayer is ultra vires and or such other or further order or orders
passed as to this court may seem fit and proper.

Poor diet, lack of education affect Roma children
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Roma children throughout Europe
continue to struggle with a poor diet and lack of education, but
also must battle stereotypes, an activist said Friday.
	   ``Roma are dangerous and teach their children to steal _ these
are the main stereotypes you find in relations between the majority
of the population and Gypsies,'' said Viorica Stefanescu of Save
the Children, using the other term for the Roma people.
	   The international non-governmental organization, with branches
in 27 countries, organized a two-day conference that began Friday
on Roma children in Europe.
	   Discussions, attended by representatives from 18 countries,
focused on the health, education and identity of Roma children.
	   In Romania, poor diet causes health problems such as
malnutrition, anemia, dystrophy and rickets, according to a Save
the Children report.
	   A lack of sanitation, identity papers and health records
sometimes make it difficult for doctors to work among the Roma
population.
	   Most of Europe's Roma live in Eastern Europe and the Balkans,
where they enjoyed a measure of enforced equality during more than
four decades of communism.
	   The end of communist rule, accompanied by growing economic
hardships, led to mass poverty, along with increased threats and
violence.
	   There are officially 400,000 Roma in Romania, but the actual
total is thought to exceed 1 million. Many hide their ethnicity
because of discrimination.

Swallows beat Giants 6-3
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The Central League's last-place Yakult Swallows
batted in five runs in the top of the first inning Friday as they
edged the front-running Yomiuri Giants 6-3 at Tokyo Dome.
	   In the third inning, Dwayne Hosey, formerly with the Boston Red
Sox, hit a solo homer, his sixth this season.
	   Yakult starter Kazuhisa Ishii collected his sixth win as he gave
up five hits and walked two, while striking out 10 in eight
innings.
	   At Koshien, Tomonori Maeda hit a winning double in the top of
the 12th inning, driving in two runs that ended a seesaw game,
lifting the Hiroshima Toyo Carp to a 6-5 victory over the Hanshin
Tigers.
	   Carp's left-hander Ken Takahashi gave up only four hits, walked
two and struck out four in eight innings.
	   The Carp ended a losing streak at four and rose to second place,
dropping the Chunichi Dragons to third.
	   At Nagoya, in central Japan, Hitoshi Nakane hit a solo homer in
the top of the fifth inning, his first this season, as the Yokohama
BayStars blanked the Dragons 2-0.
	   Norihiro Komada drove in another run on his sacrifice fly in the
seventh.
	   In Pacific League action, Koichiro Yoshinaga drove in a winning
run on a double in the bottom of the 10th inning, giving the
Fukuoka Daiei Hawks a 5-4 victory over the Nippon Ham Fighters at
home.
	   Now the Fighters are only a half game behind the first-place
Fighters.
	   At Chiba, pinch hitter Koichi Hori batted in a tie-breaking run
on a single in the bottom of the seventh inning, as the Chiba Lotte
Marines edged the Orix BlueWave 2-1 at home.
	   Harvey Pulliam, formerly of the Colorado Rockies, hit a solo
homer for the BlueWave in the seventh but it came too late.
	   The Seibu Lions and the Kintetsu Buffaloes were idle Friday.

Ukraine to get additional dlrs 78 million in American aid
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ The United States will give Ukraine another
dlrs 78 million to dismantle the rest of its nuclear weapons
facilities and convert defense industries to civilian uses.
	   An agreement was signed in Kiev on Friday by U.S. Defense
Department coordinator Laura Holgate and three Ukrainian military
and government officials.
	   Ukraine inherited the world's third-largest nuclear arsenal with
the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union. It has surrendered all its
nuclear warheads to Russia and pledged to remain nuclear-free, but
still needs to destroy some of the nuclear infrastructure.
	   Under the agreement, dlrs 76.7 million was earmarked for the
elimination of silo launchers, training silos, launch control
centers and liquid rocket fuel.
	   It will also be used to eliminate about 40 strategic bombers and
more than 1,000 air-launched cruise missiles, the U.S. Embassy in
Kiev said.
	   Another dlrs 730,000 is for the conversion of Ukraine's defense
industry to civilian uses, and dlrs 630,000 is for the
establishment of an effective export-control regime to prevent the
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.
	   The two sides also agreed Friday to extend until 2001 the
deadline for Ukraine to destroy its nuclear weapons infrastructure.
	   ``These and similar projects will allow Ukraine to pursue its
goal of eliminating all nuclear weapons' delivery systems and their
accompanying infrastructure,'' the embassy said in a statement.
	   The new money brings to dlrs 520 million the amount of aid
provided by the U.S. Department of Defense for threat reduction
programs in Ukraine.

Turkish army steps up pressure on Islamic politics
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: UPDATES with police arresting dozens in headscarf ban protest &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Police arrested scores of Islamic students
Friday during a clash Friday, and newspapers reported that Turkey's
army is preparing to again pressure the government to step up the
fight against Islamic politics.
	   The country's top generals scheduled an emergency session for
Tuesday shortly before they meet with leading government officials
in the National Security Council, the Turkish Daily News said.
	   The generals will evaluate the government's progress in its
fight against radical Islam, it said.
	   The generals are unhappy because they feel the government is
moving too slowly.
	   A so-called military-backed ``fundamentalism'' law, for example,
has been delayed by the failure of cabinet ministers to attend
parliamentary committee hearings. The bill would tighten control
over Islamic attire and education and provide heavier punishments
for civil servants involved in pro-Islamic activities.
	   The students arrested Friday in Istanbul were protesting the
suspension of 11 university friends for wearing Islamic-style
headscarves and beards, the Anatolia news agency said.
	   Private NTV television showed students being injured by police
truncheons. No injury toll was immediately available.
	   The university has banned headscarves and beards, which are seen
as a sign of loyalty, in compliance with the military's crackdown
on displays of Islamic traditionalism.
	   Turkey, overwhelmingly Muslim, has had a secular system for the
last 75 years. Last year the military forced the first Islamic-led
government her to resign.

Top-level meeting could break the ice between India and Pakistan

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Pushed by the urgency of a nuclear
threat, India and Pakistan agreed Friday to resume top-level talks
in hopes of reversing an escalation of tension and distrust.
	   India announced that the foreign secretaries of the two
countries will meet in New Delhi June 22 to resume discussions
broken off last September. The meeting is likely to prepare some
groundwork for a brief meeting between the prime ministers during a
regional summit next month.
	   It is the first concrete step to halt the tailspin in South
Asian tensions that began May 11 when India conducted a series of
nuclear tests and proclaimed itself a nuclear weapons state.
Pakistan followed suit two weeks later, resisting international
pressure for restraint. Both later declared a moratorium on further
tests.
	   The meeting in 10 days will be the first direct contact between
senior diplomats since a Hindu nationalist government took power in
New Delhi in March, adopting a harsher tone toward India's
traditional rival, Pakistan.
	   The announcement came as the foreign ministers of eight leading
industrial nations stepped up sanctions against India and Pakistan,
deciding at a meeting in London to deny all loans except those
earmarked for humanitarian projects.
	   For weeks after the nuclear tests, Indian Prime Minister Atal
Bihari Vajpayee and Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif
proclaimed their readiness for talks, but without indicating any
concession that might make them more successful than earlier
disappointing rounds.
	   ``India is committed to fostering a relationship of trust and
friendship with Pakistan based on mutual respect,'' said the
Foreign Ministry. Pakistan, observing the Muslim sabbath, had no
immediate comment.
	   The statement said the agenda will be the same formulated in
June 1997: the territorial dispute over Kashmir; ``peace and
security, including confidence building measures;'' a disengagement
of forces on the 19,000-foot-high (5,800-meter-high) Siachin
glacier; economic cooperation, drug trafficking.
	   Disarmament was not an agenda item. Both sides have pledged to
continue developing missile systems mounted with nuclear warheads
capable of reaching each other's largest cities, despite
international calls for a freeze on missile tests.
	   In September, the foreign secretaries' talks collapsed over how
to continue discussions on Kashmir, the Himalayan territory was the
catalyst for two wars between India and Pakistan in the last 50
years.
	   Pakistan says all efforts to resolve Kashmir are doomed without
international mediation. India says Kashmir is a problem for the
two countries to sort out alone.

	   The overall flood situation in the district remained static with
reports of eight deaths in flood related causes.
	   Nearly one lakh acres of aus and aman paddy of 11 thanas went
under water and thousands of people have been marooned by the flood
water.
	   The worst affected thanas are Companiganj, Zakiganj, Biyanibazar
and Goainghat.
	   There has been a outbreak of water borne diseases in the flood
affected areas due to lack of drinking water and relief materials.
	   Of the deaths two people- Abdur Rashid Haripur and Salim of

	   The 30-inch-diametre gas pipeline, worth Tk 40 crore along the
Jamuna Bridge, collapsed on Thursday during a hydraulic test-run
for the supply of gas to the western part of the country.
	   The pipeline was installed by the Hyundai company, which also
constructed the main component of the Bridge. The design of the
pipeline was not submitted to the Petrobangla Board and not
approved by it, according to a Petrobangla source.
	   A source in the Bangladesh Consultant Ltd, working along with
RPT, NEDECO as consultant on the Bridge said that earlier it had
also raised objection about the engineering of the pipeline set up
along the southern side of the bridge.
	   Originally, Petrobangla had suggested that the gas pipeline be
designed along with the design of the spans of the bridge. Besides,
it also suggested that the pipeline be installed at the same time
as the spans.
	   After the collapse of the gas pipeline, Communications Minister
Anwar Hossain Manju and Secretary Jamuna Bridge, Abdul Muyeed
Chowdhury visited the site.
	   Earlier it was decided that the supply of gas to the western
part of the country would begin from day one of the inauguration of
the Bridge. But with the collapse of the gas pipeline the supply of
gas to the western part would not take place as planned, sources
apprehended.
	   UNB adds: Sources said that low standard of work in setting up
of the pipeline was the reason behind the accident.
	   They said that the iron angles with which the pipeline was hung
had been fixed 12 feet apart from each other instead of four feet.
	   APB adds: ``The 4.8 km pipeline, installed a few days ago,
smashed into river Jamuna when hydraulic fluid (water) was moved
through the pipe under pressure,'' an official said.
	   Jamuna Multipurpose Bridge Division in a press release in Dhaka
said: The contractor suffered a serious setback in his efforts to
complete all works on the bridge prior to the opening ceremony on
June 23.
	   From a preliminary inspection it would appear that the bridge
itself was not damaged, the Division clarified.
	   ``In a combined statement from the JMBA, Construction
Supervising Consultant and the Contractor, it is understood that
the bridge-opening ceremony will go ahead as planned,'' it said.
	   Salvage the broken pipeline has already started, but engineers
said the repairs of the gas-pipe might take about two months.
	   Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina is scheduled to open the bridge on
June 23.

	   Different socio-political and trade bodies on Thursday hailed
the proposed budget for the year 1998-99 saying that it was fully
people-oriented and would help fulfil the hopes and aspirations of
the nation.
	   Giving an immediate reaction on the budget, they said through
the budget the real pro-people outlook of the present government
has been reflected.
	   The leaders of these organisations congratulated the present
government for giving the highest allocation to the education
sector in the budget. ``This allocation will help eradicate the
curse of illiteracy and produce skilled manpower,'' they said.
	   They, however, said that the new budget would play a vital role
in expanding trade and commerce and rehabilitating sick industries
in the country.
	   General Secretary of Awami League and LGRD and Coopertives
Minister Zillur Rahman hailed the proposed budget, describing it as
timely, epoch-making, people-oriented and milestone for balanced
development.
	   In an instant reaction, Rahman said the proposed budget
manifested the Awami League government's willingness to fulfil its
pre-election pledges and help face the challenges of the twenty
first century.
	   Prominent, among those, who hailed the budget are: AKM
Shamsuddoha, member of Executive Committee of the FBCCI and
Councillor, Dhaka Stock Exchange, National Association of Small and
Cottage Industries of Bangladesh (NASCIB), National Tax Lawyers'
Association (NTLA), Pabna Chamber of Commerce and Industry,
Bangladesh Truck Owners' Association, Bangladesh Gold Industry
Workers' League, Pachatturer Ghatak Nirmul Committee and former
State Minister for LGRD and Cooperatives Abul Hossain, MP.

	   FOR THE LOVE OF IT ... The cockle business has taken four men
from Tumpat in Kelantan to many rivers in Peninsular Malaysia to
earn an income for themselves and their families.
	   After almost 25 years of travelling in Malacca, Kedah, Perak and
Kelantan, the team comprising (from left) Salim Mohamad, 50, Lokman
Long Omar, 37, Mohd Ali Mamat, 48, and Mustafa Mamat, 40 (not in
picture), are now based at the Pahang River in Pekan, Pahang, in
their quest for cockles.
	   Team leader Mohd Ali said cockles were a craze in Kelantan.
	   ``This is our main source of income.''
	   Asked about the difficulties they had to overcome in collecting
cockles, Mohd Ali said the water level had to be low.
	   ``The low water level makes the task of collecting easier.
	   ``We use a basket, like the one on a bicycle, joined to a piece
of bamboo that enables us to scoop the cockles from the riverbed.''
	   The team had so far caught about 200kg of cockles from the
Pahang River which would be sold in Kelantan.

Foensic experts complete exhumations on second mass grave
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ International forensic
experts have completed exhumations at the second mass-grave site in
eastern Bosnia, a U.N. news release said Friday.
	   Bodies and parts of bodies of some 200 people were found at two
sites called ``secondary mass graves'' as the bodies were initially
buried in other mass graves, removed and then reburied into these
two and another 10 estimated sites in the region in an apparent
attempt to destroy evidence.
	   The international experts began exhumations last month to find
evidence of crimes committed during the 1995 Bosnian Serb offensive
against the eastern Muslim enclave of Srebrenica and to support
investigations and trials by the U.N. war crimes tribunal in The
Hague, Netherlands.
	   Up to 7,000 people, mainly men, are still missing and are
presumed to have been massacred by Bosnian Serbs overrunning the
enclave in July 1995.
	   The U.N. press release said some of the bodies had ``hands bound
behind their backs'' and were blindfolded.
	   The evidence appeared to corroborate survivors' reports that
after Srebrenica fell to the Serbs, many Muslims were summoned,
executed and buried in numerous mass graves in the region.

World Cup: Key defender Vidovic out of opening clash against the
</HEADLINE>
Dutch &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MONTHIEUX, France (AP) _ Belgian defender Gordan Vidovic is
unable to start Saturday's World Cup Group E opener against the
Netherlands because of a strained abductor muscle, coach Georges
Leekens said.
	   Vidovic had been key in Belgium's promising preparation
campaign, but Leekens insisted on resting him for the vital second
game against Mexico next week.
	   ``I don't want to take any risks. It's the game against Mexico
that will be decisive in the first round, not the one against the
Dutch,'' he said.
	   Leekens has long maintained that the Red Devils are too inferior
to the Dutch to mount a credible challenge, focusing his efforts on
the Mexico game and the first-round closer against South Korea
instead.
	   He still has to decide whether to replace Vidovic with Lierse's
Eric Van Meir or Anderlecht's Glen De Boeck.
	   For Saturday's game at Saint-Denis' Stade de France, Leekens
will sideline veteran Enzo Scifo, preferring to stick with the
brawn of Schalke 04 midfielder Marc Wilmots.
	   The attack will be spearheaded by Fiorentina's Luis Oliveira and
PSV Eindhoven's Luc Nilis.
	   Belgium also was the underdog when the neighbors and age-old
rivals played at the 1994 World Cup and Belgium surprisingly
prevailed 1-0. But during the World Cup qualifiers, the Dutch beat
the Belgians 3-0 and 3-1.

	   Jatiya Party chief Hussain Muhammad Ershad said on Thursday the
government had failed to prepare a budget for the welfare of the
commonman.
	   BNP member and former State Minister for Planning Dr. Moin Khan
said that due to the budgetary measures the economy would further
collapse and the people would continue to lose their purchasing
power.
	   M. Morshed Khan MP of the BNP said the budget lacked
transparency and contained no incentives for the use of heavy
machinery.
	   Moulana Delwar Hossain Sayeedi of Jamaat-e-Islami said the new
budget contained nothing more than customary rhetoric.
	   They made these observations as instant reactions to the new
budget soon after Finance Minister Shah AMS Kibria placed it in
Parliament.
	   H.M. Ershad said the commonman of Bangladesh did not expect such
a budget from the Awami League government. The people would be hit
by price hike as the coverage of the Value Added Tax (VAT) had been
expanded.
	   The former President said that so long the VAT used to be
collected at the whole sale stage, now it had been expanded to the
retail stage.
	   He said the Finance Minister had even increased the price of CI
sheets and other building materials that were used by commonman.
	   The JP Chief said the people could not accept the budget because
it was not prepared for their welfare. The budget, therefore, was
also not acceptable to JP, he said.
	   Dr. Moin Khan said the budget reflected the government's
failures of the past one year. During the year, the prices
spiralled by 61 per cent and the Taka was devalued by five per
cent. The Finance Minister's budget speech was a proof of the
downward trend of the economy, he said.
	   He said the GDP growth rate had fallen from 5.9 per cent to 5.6
per cent even though foodgrain production had been higher. This did
not prove the efficiency of the government. If agricultural output
had not been higher, the GDP growth rate would have fallen further,
he said.
	   He said the Taka 13,600 crore Annual Development Programme did
not reflect the real situation. As in current year, the government
might not have adequate revenue surplus to finance the ADP if the
mistakes committed so long are not been corrected.
	   Moin Khan said the government was hoodwinking the people by
talking about giving incentives to jute growers. The AL had in its
manifesto promised Taka 500 per maund of jute, but growers were
getting only Taka 150 per maund. The Government's deeds did not
tally with its words, he said.
	   He said that the government would once again fail to implement
new pay scales for government employees, because Taka 150 crore
earmarked for this was only one-tenth of the actual requirement.
The pressure of VAT would come on the average citizen. There was no
initiative to reverse the downward trend of the economy, he added.
	   M. Morshed Khan said the budget was not transparent because the
Finance Minister did not explain the HS Code on which new taxation
proposals had been made. The people thus remained in the dark about
the steps the Finance Minister had promised to take in this
respect.
	   The budget was also not friendly to new industries, he said.
	   Moulana Delwar Hossain Sayeedi, leader of the three Jamaat MPs
in Parliament said that the during the last two years the
government had failed to implement its high-sounding promises like
serving the people, improving the lot of the poor and protecting
the peasants and workers.
	   He said the budget did not contain realistic steps to end the
frustration and anger of the people arising out of the power crisis
and the collapse of the share market. There was also no direction
to overcome the economic stagnation and disaster, he said.
	   Moulana Sayeedi said it was not proper to impose so many taxes
on the fragile economy.
	   The promise made by the Finance Minister not to tolerate
repression of women and children was hollow because during the last
two years no realistic steps had been taken in this regards. The
government had miserably failed to improve the law and order, he
alleged.
	   The government had also failed to implement the three promises
it had made last year. Introduction of old-age allowance started
only in the eleventh month of the fiscal year. The Employment
Generation Bank was yet to be established and the shelterless
people were yet to get housing facilities, he added.
	   Dilip Barua, General Secretary of Bangladesher Samyabadi Dal in
a press statement last night said the budget was not
welfare-oriented. The budget would increase the inequality among
the people because its main objective was to make the rich richer,
he alleged

	   JOHOR BARU, Thurs. - It was a case of picking the wrong
suitcase, when two robbers, in making their escape after robbing a
businessman at a shopping complex, mistakenly dropped one
containing RM200,000 worth of jewellery and took off with the other
containing sales documents.
	   It seems luck was not on the robbers' side that day as an hour
later one of the armed duo, a 19-year-old youth, was caught by
police after a short car chase at Jalan Pingat.
	   Police investigations are under way to ascertain if an armed
man, who was shot during a scuffle with a police patrol team at the
Plaza Leisure Mall car park at 10.50pm yesterday, was the second
robbery suspect.
	   State Criminal Investigation Department chief Senior Assistant
Commissioner II Mohd Mokhtar Hassan said two men committed the
robbery at Plaza Pelangi shopping complex at Jalan Pelangi at
5.45pm.
	   The two, armed with a pistol and a knife, had forced the
jewellery supplier's two workers to carry the briefcases into a car
and one of the workers to drive them away.
	   On reaching the Pelangi Leisure Mall nearby, the robbers
alighted with the two bags and tried to hail a taxi when the
workers shouted for help.
	   An alert security guard managed to overpower the robber armed
with the knife but released him, when the other fired two warning
shots. In their getaway, the robbers dropped the bag containing the
jewellery.
	   The robbers then hijacked a car nearby in making their escape.
	   Alerted police chased the robbers' car and cornered it. They
arrested one while the other escaped.
	   After questioning him, a police launched an operation and
another police team spotted a suspicious looking man at the Plaza
Leisure Mall car park.
	   Mohd Mokhtar said the man drew out a pistol and fired at the
police team who identified themselves.
	   Police shot dead the man and found another pistol in the man's
car.
	   ``The dead man, Ong Seng Kiat, 31, had been just released from
prison and believed to have been involved in five robberies.''

were of very high quality each valued at more than 400 US dollars,
customs sources said.

World Cup: Spartan diet has Austrian team dreaming of home cooking
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GEORGE JAHN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MARGAUX, France (AP) _ Home cooking should be some of the best
for soccer players from Austria, which is known for its schnitzels,
goulash, strudel and other delectables.
	   With the World Cup team based in the Bordeaux region, the team
would seem to be reveling in local French specialties like meat,
fish, desserts and wine.
	   So why are the players eating pasta and rice almost every day?
	   ``Doctor's orders,'' explained Romeo Auer, the team cook. ``I
make what the squad's doctor tells me, and he's been telling me to
go easy on the meat.''
	   Auer said the idea is to serve a diet low on protein but rich in
vitamins, carbohydrates and fiber. Dr. Ernst Schopp, the squad
physician, feels that's the ideal combination to keep the squad fit
for World Cup competition.
	   So their diet is spartan by Austrian standards, which feature
meat on the table in most households every day, including a big
schnitzel each Sunday.
	   At the training camp table, a typical breakfast consists of
juice, coffee, tea and muesli cereal. Lunch is most often a rice or
pasta dish, perhaps with a tiny chunk of lamb or fish. And dinner
is also light, so that the squad gets a good night's sleep when
lights go out a 10:30 p.m.
	   ``I understand the need for healthy food, but three weeks of
rice is too much,'' groused midfielder Hannes Reinmayr.
	   Although Coach Herbert Prohaska says a player is allowed up to a
half-liter a wine a day, that, too, is too little for some players.
After all, Austria serves up pretty good wines of its own, and its
per capita beer consumption is among the highest in Europe.
	   ``At home, I drink up to two liters of wine a day,'' claimed
goalkeeper Franz Wohlfahrt.
	   ``We're here to play soccer and not to drink,'' Prohaska said,
when asked whether he has sampled some of the local vintages.
	   Despite players' complaints, the team cook says no to a big
serving of meat _ at least not until the team posts a victory.
	   ``Then they get schnitzel,'' he says, smiling. ``If the doctor
says it's OK.''

	   MALACCA, Thurs. - Chief Minister Datuk Seri Abu Zahar Isnin said
it would be meaningless if the country was developed but had the
quality of its environment at its worst levels.
	   ``We experienced the haze last year and this problem badly
affected our tourism industry. Therefore, the relevant authorities
and industrialists should not compromise with wrongdoing which can
affect the quality of our environment.''
	   Abu Zahar said this today in his keynote address when opening
the Melaka Industrial Excellence campaign here.
	   He said in order to achieve their goals and remain competitive
in the global market, they must seriously emphasise environmental
issues.
	   Abu Zahar added that workers' health and their welfare should
also be high on the agenda.
	   ``The International Labour Organisation reported that 90 per
cent of industrial accidents were related to unsafe acts with the
remaining 10 per cent, to unsafe conditions.
	   ``A study by the Human Resource Ministry showed that the country
is losing as much as RM4 billion a year due to industrial
accidents. Last year, a total of 128,621 cases were reported while
some 88,127 have been compiled in the first quarter of this year.
	   ``I would urge local and foreign investors to ensure that the
technology they use at their workplaces is accompanied by high
health and safety standards.''
	   Abu Zahar also said companies must strive towards having a
risk-free or accident-free working environment.
	   In order for Malaysia to become a developed country by 2020, Abu
Zahar said it was imperative for investors to effectively apply
managerial skills and concepts to all levels.
	   ``The country needs to upgrade her corporate managerial skills
in order to maintain high achievement in industrial activities,''
Abu Zahar said.
	   He added the process of upgrading the skills of workers in
Malacca was far from satisfactory.
	   He said the industrial and skills development centre, set up by
the State Government and private companies, had yet to be fully
utilised by manufacturers.

	   BUJUMBURA, Burundi (AP) _ President Pierre Buyoya appointed two
vice presidents just three days before talks resume on ending
Burundi's civil war, the state radio said.
	   Radio Burundi said Vice President Frederic Bavugimyumvira will
be in charge of political affairs and administration. Vice
President Marcias Sinamenya will handle economic and social
affairs.
	   Buyoya, a retired army major who seized power from a civilian
president in 1996, took his first oath of office on Thursday. Last
week, a transitional constitution took effect to provide for a
government of transition.
	   Bavugimyumvira, a Hutu, is a leader in the FRODEBU party that
won the country's first democratic elections in 1993. Three months
later, Tutsi paratroopers ousted the civilian government and
assassinated President Melchior Ndadaye.
	   Sinamenya, also a Hutu, is a former governor of the Central
Bank.
	   Burundi's East African neighbors imposed economic sanctions
after Buyoya's coup to force a return to democratic rule.
	   At least 200,000 people, most of them civilians, have been
killed in the fighting that began after Ndadaye's slaying.

	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Two right-wing Afrikaner
Weerstandsbeweging (AWB) members received amnesty Friday for the
1991 bombings of a school and union offices in Pretoria.
	   No one was injured in the night-time bombing of Hillview High
School, where whites were angry over admission of black students;
or in the bombing of the offices of the Congress of South African
Trade Unions (COSATU), the Truth and Reconciliation Commission
said.
	   The bombings took place after the 1990 release from prison of
anti-apartheid activist Nelson Mandela, who became the country's
president in 1994's first all-race elections.
	   The commission was established in 1995 to investigate human
rights violations by both sides of the apartheid struggle, and can
grant amnesty if applicants tell the truth and prove political
motivation.
	   Petrus Judeel and Andries Kriel, who also admitted to bombing
post offices and stealing explosives, received amnesty without
appearing at a public hearing because they did not kill, injure,
torture or abduct anyone.

	   WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) _ Namibia's wildlife police unit on
Thursday charged four Namibians and a Zambian with possessing 21
elephant tusks, one of the country's largest illegal ivory hauls in
the past three years.
	   Police said the five were arrested just north of Windhoek when
they tried to sell the ivory for 150,000 Namibian Dollars (dlrs
30,000).
	   The tusks, including eight especially large specimens, appeared
to have been buried for some time before the attempted transaction.
	   Elephants are protected under the Convention on International
Trade in Endangered Species (CITES),

	   BANGUI, Central African Republic (AP) _ An influx of foreign
rebels and bandits have turned the Central African Republic into a
hotbed of unrest ahead of presidential elections expected later
this year, a United Nations body reported here.
	   Armed attacks by guerrillas and robbers known as ``zaraguinas''
have proliferated in the northern countryside of this volatile
country, which has experienced several coups and military uprisings
in recent years, the U.N. humanitarian information unit said in a
statement.
	   ``The situation remains precarious ahead of the elections which,
in this region, often go hand in hand with trouble,'' the U.N.
agency known as IRIN said.
	   Although the capital, where the country's 1,350 U.N.
peacekeepers are based, is calm, insecurity prevails elsewhere in
the country, the U.N. agency said.
	   The three-month mandate of the U.N. soldiers _ which succeeds a
multinational African force _ will be reviewed in July. President
Ange-Felix Patasse has not announced a date for the elections..
	   Attacks have hampered relief agencies from delivering aid to
some of the country's 38,600 refugees, most of whom are from
neighboring Sudan.
	   Rebel groups in the country hail from Sudan, Chad and Congo,
IRIN said.
	   The Congolese rebels include members of the late dictator Mobutu
Sese Seko's now-disbanded military who fled what was then Zaire
during the takeover by President Laurent Kabila's rebel forces last
year.
	   -----
	   WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) _ Angolan human rights activist Manuel
Neto has been reunited with his family in the Angolan town of
Lubango, the National Society of Human Rights in Namibia said on
Thursday.
	   Neto was deported overland to Angola last month, the government
said. The London-based human rights group Amnesty International
denounced his expulsion, saying he faced certain detention and
torture.
	   Angolan intelligence officials took Neto to the town of Ondjiva,
where he was briefly questioned and then reunited with his family,
the Media Institute of Southern Africa in Windhoek said.
	   Neto had apparently upset the Angolan government by founding an
organization, the Angolan Human Rights League, in Windhoek last
month.

dlrs 27.8 million investment in the Commercial Bank of Zimbabwe,
the largest state-owned bank.
	   The investment by the International Finance Corporation will
complete a privatization process that also involves Amalgamated
Bank of South Africa (ABSA), a statement by IFC said Thursday.
	   ABSA is purchasing 26 percent interest with a dlrs 10 million
investment. IFC will receive 15 percent interest for its dlrs 27.8
million investment, an ABSA statement said Thursday.
	   The Zimbabwe government will retain 20 percent of the shares.
Remaining shares will be held by individuals.
	   It is expected that CBZ will list on the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange
within the next year.
	   The privatization will enable the bank to link up with other
financial institutions in the region.
	   The country's volatile economy saw the Zimbabwe dollar plunge by
nearly 60 percent in value against the U.S. currency last year.
Inflation has exceeded 30 percent and unemployment is estimated at
around 50 percent.

	   Pakistan's foreign minister said on Thursday that the dispute
with India over Kashmir could trigger an Indo-Pakistani nuclear war
``at any time''.''Occupied Kashmir today constitutes the world's
only flashpoint, the major flashpoint,'' Gohar Ayub Khan told
Reuters Television in an interview.He said that unlike the Cold War
in Europe, the dispute over Kashmir involved the right of its
people to determine their own future and for this reason it was
``an open wound''.''With both India and Pakistan last month
acquiring nuclear weapons and advanced delivery systems, this
conflict can erupt any time into a nuclear conflict for the mere
fact that in Europe and the former Soviet Union there was no
territorial dispute or call for the right of
self-determination.''The difference between (Western) Europe and
the Soviet Union was one of ideology and the systems.
	   That's why nuclear weapons were a means of not having a
conflict,'' he said.''But between India and Pakistan it is further
heightened by the mere fact that nerves are raw on both sides,
tension can any time erupt and then the distance between India and
Pakistan is hardly there,'' he said.Khan said India could fire its
Prithvi missiles at Pakistan and they could hit targets within four
minutes of launch.''And who on earth will determine whether that
missile is tipped with a conventional or nuclear warhead?'' he
said.U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright warned on Wednesday
the risk of ``disaster is high'' in South Asia after the Indian and
Pakistani nuclear tests.Neither country ``can be confident it will
have early warning of what the other will do. And the risk of
misinformation leading to miscalculation leading to disaster is
high,'' she said in a speech on U.S. arms control policy to the
Henry L. Stimson Centre, which promotes nonproliferation.Her
comments seemed to go beyond previous statements of alarm over the
situation created by the testing.
	   In his interview with Reuters Television, Khan said: ``The real
flashpoint in the world, as Pakistan has always been saying, is
Kashmir where 600,000 Indian occupation forces are there carrying
out human rights violations, gang rapes, burning villages,
extra-judicial killings and not allowing the people to exercise the
right of self determination.'' He said both countries would be
severely damaged in any nuclear conflict but asserted that India
would come off worst.''The fourth war will be very costly for
India, very costly, because of the systems that Pakistan
has.''Pakistan might be able to absorb the damage but India will
never be able to. The end result will be that both of us will be
badly savaged, badly mauled, but in that process India will go down
very badly,'' he said. Khan said that after both countries
conducted nuclear tests last month ``the power factor or regional
factor has shifted from India to Pakistan... Today Pakistan is the
nuclear power in the region, not India,'' he said.
	   He said 50 years of high-level talks had failed to break the
deadlock over Kashmir, one third of which is controlled by Pakistan
and the rest by India.Khan said he hoped talks in Sri Lanka next
month between the Indian and Pakistani prime ministers would lay
the foundations for real negotiations on the dispute, the cause of
two of the three wars between the two neighbours.But he called for
``assistance'' from Japan and the United States--mediation that
India has already rejected--''so that we are not mired in these
talks as we have been in the past, not talks for talks' sake and
propaganda, but resolution''. ``If we want to make progress we want
to have third party mediation to assist us,'' he said.Khan said the
result of previous talks had been ``nothing. We get back to square
one''. ``We start off with a lot of propaganda activity in both the
countries and after three or four days there is a lot of
backslapping and congratulating each other but nowhere, no
progress.''

	   At least 20 people were killed and more than 50 wounded when Sri
Lankan armed forces bombed and shelled civilian areas in the north
of the country on Wednesday, the opposition Liberation Tigers of
Tamil Eelam (LTTE) said.''In a carefully planned attack the Sri
Lankan air force and the artillery carried out a massive raid on
the civilian settlements of Suthanthirapuram area of Mullativu
district,'' the LTTE said in a statement.

which caused further fatalities.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Thurs. - Employers should regard retrenchment only
as a last-resort measure to cut cost to cope with the economic
slowdown.
	   This was emphasised at the Federation of Malaysian
Manufacturers' briefing on Effective Human Resource Management on
Compensation Packages and Industrial Relations today.
	   ``Retrenchment makes a person lose part of his personal identity
when he least expects it,'' said Lt Col (R) D. Pillai, human
resources manager of Metrod (M) Bhd, when speaking on the
procedures and pitfalls of retrenchment.
	   ``More importantly, it affects the morale of those still
employed. They would be constantly worrying if they would be
next.''
	   Employers should abide by the Code of Conduct for Industrial
Harmony of 1975 which required them to adopt positive measures to
avert reducing their workforce, he said.
	   Among the steps were temporarily freezing recruitment,
restricting overtime claims and reducing shifts.
	   Other measures included retraining of staff, and restrictions on
working on weekly rest days.
	   The briefing was attended by some 80 human resource personnel
from various companies.

Prosecutor recommends charges be dropped against former ministers
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PIERRE-ANTOINE SUCHARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The chief prosecutor at a special court recommended
on Friday that an appeals court drop charges against three former
Cabinet ministers in the 1985 contamination of 1,300 people with
AIDS-tainted blood.
	   Jean-Francois Burgelin said the actions of former Socialist
Prime Minister Laurent Fabius, former Social Affairs Minister
Georgina Dufoix and former deputy Health Minister Edmond Herve were
``involuntary and stemmmed from negligence rather than malicious
intention.''
	   The three had been placed under investigation for ``complicity
in poisoning,'' in part for opting not to purchase U.S.-made AIDS
tests that would have prevented the tragedy. France's Pasteur
Institute was preparing its own AIDS test at the time.
	   They also opted against importing expensive blood products
treated with heat to de-activate the AIDS virus.
	   All three have said they never knowingly approved the use of
tainted blood.
	   Four former health officials, including the doctor who headed
the National Center for Blood Transfusion in 1985, were convicted
on charges related to the case and jailed.
	   Burgelin submitted a 100-page report defending his suggestion
the charges be dropped to the Court of Justice, a special court
empowered to prosecute officials for crimes committed while in
office.
	   The daily newspaper Le Monde quoted the report as saying that
French health officials acted more quickly than counterparts in
other countries to set up screening programs for blood donors.
	   The newspaper quoted the report as citing documents showing
that, at the time, the U.S. pharmaceutical company Abbott, which
manufactured the AIDS test, wasn't able to fully satisfy the needs
of the French market.
	   The court, composed of 12 members of parliament and three French
magistrates, now must decide whether to accept the prosecutor's
suggestion to drop the charges, which carry a maximum 30-year
prison sentence.
	   Burgelin reiterated opinions expressed last year when he urged a
lower court to dismiss the case. He had described the deaths as
resulting from the ``inextricable overlapping of responsibilities
that modern technology engenders.''
	   But a lower court went on to rule to pursue the charges.
	   About 1,300 hemophiliacs were infected with the AIDS virus in
the mid-80s when government medical authorities distributed blood
products they knew could be contaminated with HIV. More than 500 of
the victims have since died.
	   After the scandal broke in 1990, victims' families successfully
argued that the ministers be prosecuted.
	   Fabius was prime minister from 1984-86.

Cooling substance leaks from Dukovany nuclear plant
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Two to three cubic meters of a
cooling substance leaked from the primary circuit in the Dukovany
nuclear plant Friday morning, the news agency CTK reported.
	   Nobody was injured in the accident that occurred at 0935 (0735
GMT), the agency said.
	   It quoted Jan Suller of the National Institute for Nuclear
Security as saying that no leaks of radioactivity were recorded
outside the plant.
	   The 1,760-megawatt, Soviet-designed Dukovany plant, about 200
kilometers (120 miles) southeast of Prague, is the only nuclear
plant operating in the Czech Republic at present.
	   Another 2,000-megawatt plant is being built in Temelin, about 50
kilometers (30 miles) from the Austrian border. The plant is
expected to go on line in the year 2000.

	   PETALING JAYA, Thurs. - The Wangsa Maju water treatment plant
which will begin operations next month, will obtain its raw water
from the Klang Gates dam and also groundwater tapped from areas
near it.
	   Puncak Niaga (M) Sdn Bhd executive chairman Datuk Rozali Ismail
said the ground water would be an alternative source if Klang Gates
could not supply sufficient water to the plant.
	   The company is implementing the project funded by the Federal
Government. The new plant would be capable of producing 45 million
litres per day.
	   The water level at the Klang Gates dam has recently dropped as a
result of the dry spell, causing the Bukit Nanas water treatment
plant to operate at 80 per cent capacity.
	   At present, Bukit Nanas is the only water treatment plant
supplied by Klang Gates dam.
	   Rozali said work to construct the pipe had already begun and
would be ready before the plant started operations next month.
	   He assured residents near the water treatment plant that they
need not worry about the tapping of ground water as it would be
carried out far from residential areas.

	   President Bill Clinton, answering criticism of his trip to
China, argues it is better to talk face-to-face with its communist
leadership than to isolate the world's most populous country and
treat it as a rogue nation. Two weeks before Clinton flies to
China, the White House dismissed the criticism as ``political
chatter.''
	   He will be the first American President to go to China since the
1989 Tiananmen Square massacre of pro-democracy advocates. Clinton
was laying out the reasons for his trip in a speech Thursday before
China scholars at the National Geographic Society. Republican and
Democratic members of Congress, along with Chinese dissidents, have
urged Clinton to cancel his trip and instead send a wreath
commemorating those who have died under oppressive rule.

 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with Paraguay coach comments in new 6th, 8th grafs. &QL; 
 &UR; By DUSAN STOJANOVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MONTPELLIER, France (AP) _ Bulgarian goalkeeper Zdravko Zdravkov
leapt high to his right to deny Paraguayan counterpart Jose Luis
Chilavert from converting a second-half 25-meter free kick, leaving
the two sides with a goalless draw in their World Cup opener
Friday.
	   The Bulgarians played the final two minutes with only 10 men
after Anatoli Nankov earned his second yellow. Paraguay had two
good chances following the sending off, but failed to convert.
	   Chilavert, famous for coming forward on set pieces and as an
extra attacker, curled a left-footed blast over the wall in the
78th minute, only to have Zdravkov punch away the shot as it
approached the crossbar.
	   Saudi referee Abdul Rahman Al-Zeid awarded the free kick when
Trifon Ivanov hauled down Paraguayan forward Jorge Campos.
	   Paraguay dominated the second half, getting several chances
before Chilavert's free kick.
	   ``We lacked poise to finish the plays,'' Paraguay coach Paulo
Cesar Carpeggiani said. ``We always missed the last pass.''
	   Hristo Stoichkov set up the best Bulgarian opportunity in the
second half when he charged into the box from the left, crossed the
ball to an unmarked Luboslav Penev, who blasted high from six yards
with only Chilavert to beat.
	   ``We had some tactical errors on both sides of the defense,''
Carpeggiani said. '' But we made som adjustments and improved in
the second half. Unfortunately, it wasn't enough to win. We lacked
the finishing touch.''
	   The match was a game of missed opportunities.
	   Stoichkov hit the post in the 35th minute, beating two defenders
and knocking the ball off the upright with a left-footed shot which
had Chilavert totally beaten.
	   The Bulgarians, considered favorites in the Group D match,
opened up with several swift atacks and a shot by Kressimir Balakov
that just missed in the second minute.
	   Two minutes later, a Stoichkov was upended in the Paraguayan box
but his pleas to Al-Zeid went unheeded.
	   The Paraguayans rarely threatened the Bulgarian goal, taking 19
minutes before Carlos Morales' got their first shot, a free kick
that had to be stopped by Zdravko with a diving save.
	   Their best chance of the half came in the 40th minute when
forward Jose Cardoso was left all alone in the Bulgarian penalty
area, but his shot from 15 meters skidded wide of the right post.
	   Stoichkov was yellow-carded in injury time for a reckless
tackle.

Ethiopian minister rules out direct negotiations with Eritrea
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Ethiopia will not negotiate directly with
Eritrea because it is occupying Ethiopian land, the country's
foreign minister said Friday.
	   Ethiopian Foreign Minister Seyoum Mesfin arrived in Cairo for
talks with the Egyptian government, which Eritrea has asked to
mediate the border war that broke out last month.
	   ``Direct negotiations are impossible because it is unacceptable
for someone to come and occupy your territory and tell you: `come
and negotiate with me','' Mesfin told reporters at Cairo airport.
	   ``It is against international law.''
	   Mesfin was met by Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa and is
scheduled to hold talks later Friday with President Hosni Mubarak.
	   His visits comes a day after Abdullah Mahmoud Jaber, an adviser
to Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki, left Cairo after asking Egypt
to mediate between the conflict.
	   Border skirmishes broke out on May 6 when Ethiopia accused
Eritrea of occupying a swath of land along their border. The two
sides differ over where Italy, the former colonial power, drew the
border.
	   Eritrean forces fought a secessionist rebellion against Ethiopia
for 30 years. They realized their aims in 1993, two years after
helping Ethiopian rebels under Zenawi overthrow the Addis Ababa
government.

Japanese cult member said guru ordered attack
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A former senior member of the cult accused in the
1995 nerve gas attack on the Tokyo subways testified Friday that
the group's guru ordered an assault on a lawyer critical of the
cult, a news report said.
	   Seiichi Endo, 37, the cult's biological scientist, told the
Tokyo District Court that Shoko Asahara ordered cult members to
spray the deadly sarin nerve gas on lawyer Taro Takimoto's car in
1994, Kyodo News agency reported.
	   Endo was testifying in the trial of former cult lawyer Yoshinobu
Aoyama, 38, charged with attempted murder in the attack on
Takimoto, who survived. Endo is also charged with attempted murder
in the same case.
	   Endo said Asahara, who is on trial for murder in the subway
gassing, ordered members to practice spraying the gas, and gave
directions on how the attack should be carried out, the report
said.
	   Takimoto was helping families of cult members at the time of the
attack in May 1994.
	   Endo is charged in nine criminal cases, including the subway
attack, which killed 12 and injured thousands.

World Cup: Klinsmann says Germans respect the United States a lot
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NICE, France (AP) _ Captain Juergen Klinsmann said Friday the
German team had a lot of respect for the United States, whom the
Germans play Monday in Paris.
	   ``They have several experienced players who play in Europe and
they've achieved some good results recently,'' Klinsmann said.
These include a victory over Brazil.
	   He said the reigning European champion and three-time World Cup
champion would not underestimate the Americans.
	   ``They've grown as a team. They've made progress since the 1994
World Cup, they are self-confident, which is typical of their
mentality and we have a lot of respect for them,'' Klinsmann said.
	   ``We expect a physical, strong team,'' said Klinsmann, who
according to some reports may be heading to the MLS after the World
Cup.
	   Klinsmann said the Germans were gearing to win three points.
	   ``It's very important to win the opening game,'' he said. ``We
are approaching the game with optimism and in a good spirit.''
	   Coach Berti Vogts, who has been reluctant to discuss the
American team, also said he expected a physical game.
	   ``They had great problems against Belgium'' (in a friendly
match), Vogts said, adding that Germany was the favorite.
	   ``But we can't talk about small teams anymore. There are no
small teams. The world of soccer is growing closer,'' he said.
	   ``It's very important to get a good start,'' Vogts said of
Monday's game at the Parc des Princes stadium. ``We can see how
hectic it can get if you don't have a good start,'' he said,
referring to Italy's 2-2 draw against Chile.
	   Vogts, as usual, declined to discuss his starting lineup.
	   ``It's not important who plays, it's important that they play
well,'' Vogts said.
	   The Germans practiced Friday morning by playing a combination of
tennis and soccer in small groups.
	   On Thursday evening, the team visited nearby Monte Carlo for
sight-seeing and dinner.

	   INTAN Utilities Bhd yesterday said its substantial shareholders
Vista Meranti Sdn Bhd and its wholly-owned subsidiary IMD Sdn Bhd,
have collectively sold 17.84 per cent or 9.551 million shares in
Intan to Compagnie Generale Des Eaux Asia Pacific Pte Ltd.
	   There was no mention of the sale price and method of payment.
	   CGE Asia Pacific, a company incorporated in Singapore, is a
wholly-owned subsidiary of the Paris Stock Exchange-listed Vivendi
Group.
	   The Vivendi Group is the world's largest water distributor. It
serves more than 170 million consumers worldwide.
	   In Malaysia, the Vivendi Group has had a presence since 1986
through associate, the Taliworks group of companies.
	   Through CGE Utilities (M) Sdn Bhd, it is involved in operating
27 water treatment plants in Selangor.
	   Intan Utilities is an investment holding company with one
wholly-owned subsidiary, Metropolitan Utilities Corp Sdn Bhd (MUC).
	   MUC is involved in the sourcing, treatment and supplying of
treated water to the Perak Water Supply Board for distribution to
consumers.
	   It has been granted a 20-year build-operate-transfer concession
for this operation by the Perak State Government in 1989 under the
Greater Ipoh Water Supply phase II privatisation project.
	   In a statement yesterday, Intan Utilities said Tan Sri Vincent
Tan Chee Yioun, who is the ultimate controlling shareholder of both
Vista and IMD, is deemed an interested party in Intan.
	   This is due to his 10.8 per cent stake via his interests in
Berjaya Group Bhd.
	   Following the sale by Vista and IMD and the deemed interest, he
now has a 31.81 per cent equity interest in Intan Utilities.
	   CGE Asia Pacific has contracted to purchase up to 30 per cent
equity interest in Intan Utilities from Vista, IMD and several
other third parties.
	   As part of the agreement, a new company Kristal Utama Sdn Bhd,
which will become a 75 per cent subsidiary of CGE Asia Pacific will
assume the responsibilities of Vista and IMD.

	   When an organisation like the Bangladesh Public Service
Commission (PSC) comments that the increasing rate of unemployment
among the educated youth, and lack of new job opportunities are
combining together to create conditions for socio-economic
instability in the country, one ought to give more than a casual
glance at it and try to decipher the intrinsic meaning of the words
in order to find new directions for solving the problems. The
remarks are well documented in the PSC's 1997 annual report which
was prepared after compiling data on the employment situation of
the last one decade.
	   The report was reportedly distributed in the Jatiya Sangsad on
Thursday last.It is only a harsh reality that the rate of
unemployment of the educated youths in Bangladesh is one of the
highest in the world. The job market is not growing in proportion
to the number of educated youths being added every year to the
already existing large body of the unemployed. Not many jobs are
created in the country, for which a slow-moving economy is held
responsible by the experts. A backward and impractical education
system is equally to be blamed for the situation. The world has
undergone radical changes, and the present time demands a pragmatic
and need-based education, keeping both eyes on the job market at
home and abroad.
	   There is demand for Bangladeshi workers in many foreign
countries but as our youths lack the required technical skills and
working English, these jobs are going away to other countries. When
the rest of the world is progressing at a rapid pace with timely
and intensive application of modern technology, we still tend to
cling to obsolete ideas and methods, and the worst sufferer of this
is the vast community of students in various institutes. We
strongly feel that our education system needs overhauling with the
induction of technology oriented curricula at all levels. Unless we
do that - the unemployment problem of the educated youths will be
difficult to solve.

	   The increasingly high volume of road traffic in Bangladesh is
bringing into sharp focus the serious need for reduction of road
accidents. At a seminar on Road Safety Publication' last Tuesday,
the discussion centred around creation of a mass awareness of the
various traffic hazards and problems. In this context extensive use
of both the electronic and the print media could be recommended.
Safety hazards in Bangladesh are practically double that of
Pakistan and India in the South Asian region, and 20 times more
compared to countries like USA and UK, according to the seminar
report.Public awareness to ensure road safety is very much present
as far as private users of vehicles are concerned.
	   It is educating the drivers of the public transport system which
needs to be given due emphasis. Again, it would be most proper if
the licensing office, namely, the Bangladesh Road Transport
Authority took up the task of making sure that defective vehicles
do not get their licences renewed. The police also need to increase
their vigilance on a routine basis so as to detect vehicles
operating under a false license as well as weed out defective
vehicles which pollute the air and are accident-prone. A start has
been made with the identification and tagging of vehicles emitting
noxious fumes at a checkpoint near the Sangshad. The number of such
checkpoints could be increased so that gradually the vehicles on
all our roads are covered.
	   Road dividers which have proved to be effective in minimising
accidents can be introduced to bisect the inter-city highways,
bringing down head-on collisions. The removal is also recommended
of impromptu bazaars by the sides of the highways and widening both
sides with earth-fill, if necessary. This would reduce the plunging
of vehicles into ditches causing fatalities and injuries. Traffic
security is not limited to awareness of the dos and don'ts of
travelling, but also a need for the relevant infrastructure to be
in place, ensuring road safety for all.

	   PARIS (AP) _ A growing international scandal over World Cup
tickets erupted on two new fronts Friday, with the tournament
organizers saying they were investigating two soccer federations
and a branch of their own marketing arm for possible roles in the
scams.
	   Michel Zen-Ruffinen, FIFA's acting general secretary, said
investigations were under way into the improper sale of tickets by
soccer officials in Cameroon and an unnamed South American country.
French news reports said it was Colombia.

Beware the return of socialism, Klaus says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Former Premier Vaclav Klaus called
on Czechs to vote for his party in early elections next week,
warning Friday against the return of socialism.
	   By voting for the Civic Democratic Party, ``only then you can be
certain that your vote will stop the coming of the left,'' the
state news agency CTK quoted Klaus as saying.
	   He said his party is worried by the possible ``waste of votes,''
should other center-right parties fail to meet the 5 percent
threshold necessary to get into parliament following elections June
19-20.
	   According to polls conducted by the independent Sofres-Factum
agency and published Friday by the daily Mlada Fronta Dnes, support
for the Christian Democrats and the Freedom Union sank to 6 percent
and 5.4 percent, respectively.
	   The opposition Social Democrats lead with 26.7 percent, followed
by Klaus' party, with 19.5 percent.
	   Pollsters queried 1,554 people Wednesday. No margin of error was
given.
	   Freedom Union leader Jan Ruml angrily dismissed Klaus' appeals,
saying votes for his party would be in double digits.
	   While the poll showed 47 percent Czechs would support a grand
coalition of the Social Democrats, Civic Democratic Party and
Freedom Union, all three parties have repeatedly said no such
coalition is possible.
	   Regular parliamentary elections had been scheduled for 2000. But
Klaus' government collapsed in November over a party financing
scandal, and a caretaker government with a limited mandate was
installed.

	   President Carlos Menem's prophecy that Argentina will win the
World Cup has been greeted with a sense of foreboding, and not
elation, by his countrymen, who seem to believe that the President
and good results in soccer do not go together. They are still
haunted by the rankling memories of Argentina's 0-5 drubbing at the
hands of the Colombians in 1993, when Menem was among the
spectators. That was enough to seal the President's fate, as the
soccer-crazy people of his country decided to unofficially ban him
from watching Argentina's matches!
	   It is not known why they turned their ire on a man who could not
have wished anything ominous for the team . Perhaps, the fans were
stunned by the way Argentina lost to a neighbour, and were looking
for a scapegoat! Finally, none other than the President had to take
the blame !The whole thing might appear to be a case of a sport
being blown out of proportions. But then one has to go beyond the
bounds of logic to discover why the Argentines took the defeat so
seriously. Soccer is their life. So winning in this game means a
lot more than scoring a valuable point. This is perhaps true not
only of the Argentines but the South Americans in general. When
their players failed miserably, the soccer fans could not believe
their eyes, but were still not ready to blame them.
	   The cult heroes do enjoy a great degree of impunity. Even a poor
performance on their part was attributed to a phenomenon not very
easy to explain or elaborate.The Argentine players, however, had
proved their worth many times in the past to become heroes in the
eyes of their fans. So one mishap' did not shatter their
reputation.President Menem has tried to clear his name of a stigma'
by saying that his team will come out victorious in France. If he
can prove himself right, the Argentine fans will have to look for
alternative sources of trouble' when things go wrong in future.

U.N. conference fails to agree on how to impose `greenhouse gas'

	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ A U.N. conference on combating global
warming failed at a two-week session ending Friday to resolve major
disputes over how to impose the cuts in ``greenhouse gas''
pollution agreed to in a worldwide treaty last year.
	   The conference's main action was to order a study on how forests
help absorb the emissions, which are blamed for global warming,
conference executive secretary Michael Zammit Cutajar said.
	   Countries can plant forests to earn leeway for their pollution
quotas that were set in the December accord reached in Kyoto,
Japan. The study by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
will help determine how much leeway.
	   Still hotly debated is to what extent industrialized nations can
trade their emissions quotas among themselves, Cutajar said.
	   The officials from 150 nations meeting in Bonn had hoped to pave
the way for agreements on quota flexibility before the next
high-level meeting in Buenos Aires, Brazil, Nov. 2-13.
	   But Cutajar said that now seemed unlikely.
	   Quota trading allows one country to fall short of meeting its
cutback target by purchasing quota credits from another that more
than meets its target. The December accord also allows countries to
earn quota credits by financing pollution-reduction programs in a
developing country.
	   The United States, under pressure from U.S. industry, has been
pushing for wide flexibility in quota trading. But environmental
groups and the 15-nation European Union favor a strict limit on the
trades, arguing each country should focus on cutting emissions at
home even if that is more expensive.
	   The December accord committed nations for the first time to roll
back emissions _ of carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels and
five other gases _ to pre-1990 levels.
	   It called for the United States to reduce greenhouse gases to 7
percent below what they were in 1990. The European Union would cut
by 8 percent, Japan by 6 percent. The reductions would have to be
attained between 2008 and 2012.
	   No country has ratified the Kyoto treaty yet.

	   India and Pakistan exploded nuclear devices last month to the
dismay of the international community. The Security Council and the
major powers expressed their disappointment and unanimously
deplored the actions of both India and Pakistan. The US and Japan
imposed immediate economic sanctions on new loans and fresh
financial non-humanitarian aid. The major powers, otherwise known
as G-8 countries (USA, UK, France, Germany, Canada, Italy, Russia
and Japan), are meeting today, 12th of June for further discussions
on taking coordinated action to defuse the highly tense and
volatile situation in the sub-continent. If the G-8 countries
(which represent 60% of the GDP of the world) want to put a halt to
th7up for the Comprehensive Test
Ban Treaty (CTBT) or the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT)
will continue to fall on deaf ears.
	   It is wrong to assume that mere condemnation or limited
sanctions by the major powers will deter them from the path of a
potentially armed conflict. The region in perspective: It is an
admitted fact that the situation is much more dangerous than it was
a few weeks ago. Though India and Pakistan are not as yet on the
brink of hostilities, all the elements of an armed conflict are
there. It may be noted that on the ground, it has been reported
that there has recently been ``routine firing'' in the 80 km
Siachen Glacier where Indian and Pakistan troops face each other
across a line of control in divided Kashmir territory. Any
misunderstanding or misjudgment could even start a disastrous
border war. The volatile nature of the relationship between India
and Pakistan is rooted in the dispute on Kashmir ( a
Muslim-majority territory). Kashmir is divided between India and
Pakistan, with both sides claiming territorial rights over it.
India and Pakistan fought their first war over disputed Kashmir in
1948.
	   After India's defeat by China over disputed frontiers in the
Himalayas in 1962, the second war was fought on Kashmir in 1965.
The third war in 1971 ended with erstwhile East Pakistan becoming
an independent and sovereign Bangladesh in a parallel War of
Liberation. Since the BJP-led government came into political power
in mid-March of this year, the situation has been further
exacerbated as it threatens to implement one of the BJP
manifestoes' to reclaim the whole territory of Kashmir. The
statement of the Indian Home Minister LK Advani, (former President
of BJP ) to the effect that India's nuclear tests have ``brought
about a qualitatively new stage in Indo-Pakistani relations ......
it signifies India's resolve to deal firmly and strongly with
Pakistan's hostile designs and activities in Kashmir. `` How would
you read this statement if you were a Pakistani ?It appears that
when the BJP-led government became much more belligerent after the
explosion of nuclear devices, Pakistan reacted strongly to the
threat by India and declared its own nuclear strength to withstand
India's ``aggression''.
	   This was a tit-for-tat response to correct the strategic
imbalance in the sub-continent and also a signal to India to
refrain from any misadventure on Pakistan's side of Kashmir.
Sanctions counter-productive? Unless comprehensive and collective
sanctions including trade are imposed on a country, experience
shows that sanctions do not bite. Many examples can be cited as to
the ineffectual effects of haphazard sanctions (at present Cuba,
Libya, Iran and earlier Southern Rhodesia and South Africa.) In the
present scenario Russia, Germany and France do not approve of
sanctions for either India or for Pakistan. So far, only the US and
Japan have imposed sanctions. One may note, however, that the
sanctions apply only on fresh loans or new non-humanitarian
financial aid. There is a view that both India and Pakistan will
rough it out as they appear to be safe for at least one year as
sanctions will not affect the loans or aid already approved or in
the pipeline. Under the guise of ``nuclear nationalism'', both the
countries have justified their actions.
	   (In Pakistan especially there was popular pressure on the
government to retaliate Indian action as a matter of national
pride.) An overwhelming majority of the public of both countries
appear to be jubilant and proud of the actions taken by their
respective governments. Both governments have warned their citizens
to brace for economic hardships, with the Pakistan Prime Minister
promising that Pakistani children would take only one meal a day if
that was the price to pay for nuclear tests. With such emotional
patriotic rhetoric, sanctions will in effect unify the people
further and strengthen the hands of the government. Regrettably,
sanctions will not make the reality of the nuclear tests go away,
instead it will only make the poor nations poorer. As a result, the
governments may be tempted not to repay any debts till the
sanctions remain and in that case the foreign banks and
international or regional financial institutions will be affected
adversely. If India and Pakistan become financially desperate, one
cannot rule out the possibility that they be at liberty to make
money by selling its nuclear capabilities to other nuclear'
aspirant nations.
	   What's more, sanctions could isolate this region that perceives
itself already under siege. What can the G-8 countries do? The G-8
countries should realise that this is not a region where nuclear
deterrence may work so easily, because this area has a history of
hostility, territorial disputes and animosity rooted in religion.
Intense distrust, suspicion and contiguous borders constitute a
combustible situation. Furthermore, poor detection capabilities on
each other's actions and absence of zero warning time may tempt
them to make a preemptive strike against each other. It is in this
that the real danger lies of a war between the two countries. All
the G-8 countries are aware of the immense and enduring tensions in
the sub-continent between India and Pakistan on the unresolved
dispute of Kashmir. The present status quo in Kashmir is contrary
to the UN resolution which states that the status of Kashmir is to
be decided by the Kashmiri people on the basis of a free and fair
plebiscite. The 1972 Simla Agreement between India and Pakistan
speaks of the resolution of the dispute through bilateral
negotiations. Pakistan wants to sit down with India on all matters
including the Kashmir issue.
	   But, India considers Kashmir as part of its territory and
perceives Pakistan to have occupied one- third of it illegally and
does not wish to discuss Kashmir issue as it undermines its
sovereignty. The present irreconcilable position on the Kashmir
dispute is an important issue that needs to be addressed earnestly
and immediately. Although after the nuclear tests both countries
expressed their desire to open a dialogue with each other to
establish a cooperative relationship, India appears to be reluctant
to include Kashmir as an agenda for talks with Pakistan. Here lies
the bottleneck. If the G-8 countries are serious about ending this
threatening armed conflict, the first step to is to evolve a
mechanism in association with the UN through which the Kashmir
dispute may be resolved through peaceful negotiations. I would
argue that it is the only avenue to defuse the tension permanently
in the sub-continent. The major powers reacted quickly and at the
rhetorical level strongly at the detonation of nuclear devices by
both India and Pakistan. It is not merely the conduct of nuclear
tests that is at issue here.
	   The holding of nuclear explosions is only a symptom of deep
suspicion and distrust on each other's design on the disputed
territory of Kashmir. In fact, what has happened in the region is a
result of the failure of major powers to appreciate the underlying
cause of the tension in the region because of the pending Kashmir
dispute. The G-8 countries must focus on a strategy to prevent an
armed conflict from occurring between India and Pakistan. The
crucial issue is: how to settle peacefully the vexed question of
the Kashmir dispute? Until and unless the major powers are strong
enough to put pressure on India and Pakistan to resolve this
territorial issue, durable peace in the region is a far cry.
Neither sanctions nor rhetorical statements would be enough to
contain the unstable situation in the sub-continent. If the major
powers miss the opportunity to bring India and Pakistan to the
negotiating table on the Kashmir dispute, the de facto nuclear
moratorium will be finally over.
	   Soon we may witness a few other countries conducting nuclear
tests and late President Kennedy could become right when he
predicted that by 2000 there could be 32 countries which would have
nuclear weapons capability. The five official nuclear countries
(US, UK, France, Russia and China) have no credible standing to
preach to other countries unless they decide a time-table to
destroy their own nuclear weapons, otherwise it will reflect an
attitude of double standard The five nuclear countries have to get
their act together to agree on a schedule to end their nuclear
status and it would have a decisive influence on other countries.
The world has a great stake in halting the nuclear proliferation
and we will watch with great interest what course of action the
major powers (G-8 countries) would take at the meeting. The writer

Audi to buy Lamborghini
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with reported purchase price, quote, background &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   INGOLSTADT, Germany (AP) _ Continuing its luxury shopping spree
a week after buying Rolls-Royce, Volkswagen, through its Audi
subsidiary, said Friday it had signed a letter of intent to acquire
the Italian sportscar maker Lamborghini SpA.
	   The price was not given, but media reports put it at 70 million
marks (dlrs 40 million).
	   In a joint statement, Audi and Lamborghini said details of the
deal will be finished in the next few weeks. Lamborghini will
likely be integrated as foreign subsidiary in the Ingolstadt-based
group, similar to Audi's operations in Hungary, they said.
	   ``Audi becomes more international with (the purchase) and enters
a market segment where we're not yet present,'' said spokesman
Juergen De Graeve.
	   The deal developed out of talks that began with the Italian firm
expressing interest in buying Audi's 8-cylinder motor for a new
model.
	   Lamborghini's major shareholder is a son of former Indonesian
President Suharto, and rumors had been swirling that he was looking
to sell his stake because of recent financial problems at home.
	   Lamborghini, which had been losing money, drove back into the
black two years ago, but its plans to expand the range of models
for a broader market share have been hampered by lack of financing.
	   The exclusive firm produced only 225 of its sole model, Diablo,
last year.
	   Volkswagen has also sought recently to broaden its base with the
purchase of the British luxury car maker, Rolls-Royce Motor Co,
owned by Vickers PLC.
	   At the same time, Vickers agreed to sell its high-performance
engine maker to Audi.

Lawmakers plan own investigation into reporter's killing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A group of lawmakers said Friday they will conduct
their own investigation into the killing of a newspaper editor who
was also a regional co-chairman of their Yabloko party.
	   Larisa Yudina, editor of the Soviet Kalmykia Today newspaper,
disappeared Sunday after leaving her home in Elista, capital of the
Kalmyk Republic in southern Russia. She was found dead Monday, with
multiple knife wounds and a fractured skull.
	   Lawmaker Sergei Ivanenko said Yabloko members in the State Duma,
the lower house of parliament, would conduct an investigation
separate from the police ``to put pressure on the government'' to
find the killer.
	   Soviet Kalmykia Today is the only opposition newspaper in
Kalmykia and Yudina frequently wrote stories critical of President
Kirsan Yulimzhinov.
	   Russian media have reported that Yudina left her home to meet
someone who promised to give her documents about a misappropriation
of funds.
	   Interior Minister Sergei Stepashin has said Yudina's killing was
a ``contract and political'' one.
	   ``One cannot be absolutely sure that there will be no attempts
to halt the investigation of this crime,'' Ivanenko told the
Interfax news agency.
	   Three people, including a former official in Yulimzhinov's
administration, have been detained in connection with the killing.

train crash &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HANOVER, Germany (AP) _ Train traffic was nearly back to normal
in Germany Friday, 10 days after the nation's worst postwar train
crash that officials say killed 100 people.
	   Twenty-four of the 59 first generation InterCity Express trains
that were pulled out of service for special ultrasonic tests of the
wheels have been inspected, a railway spokesman in Hamburg said. No
defects have been found.
	   Authorities have said they are nearly certain a broken wheel on
a first generation ICE train caused the June 3 derailment and
devastating crash at Eschede, 60 kilometers (35 miles) north of
Hanover.
	   Inspection for wheel defects on the high-speed ICEs has been
taking about 12 hours for each train, the spokesman said.
	   The trains pulled out of service for inspection were replaced by
slower inter-regional trains, with some additional coaches borrowed
from Austria and Switzerland to help fill the gap.
	   After days of uncertainty about how many people had died in the
crash because bodies were so badly mutilated, police in Celle said
that the figure of 100 released on Thursday still stands.
Previously the number of dead was put as high as 102 and as low as
95.

	   The Serbians claim that the land of Kosovo belongs to them as
they were uprooted by the conquering Ottoman Turks and supplanted
with an Albanian population of Turkish origin, mostly Muslims.
Hence they are all aliens, unauthorised occupiers of their land.The
Serbs launched their bloody campaign of terror and killing since
March last against 92 per cent of the population of Kosovo that is
Albanian Muslims. The Serb reaction was patently savage. The wanton
killing of the ethnic Albanians in Kosovo drew worldwide
condemnation. The six-nation contact group comprising Britain,
Germany, Russia, Italy, France and the US told Serbia that it must
not do to Kosovo's Albanians what it did to Bosnia's Muslims just a
few years ago.
	   ``We don't want a repeat of 1991, when the international
community did not react with sufficient vigour and force,'' said
Madeleine Albright, America's Secretary of State, during a
fractious Contact Group Meeting in London. She managed to persuade
European allies to join in harsh measures against Serbia although
Russia agreed to only two of the group's four proposed punitive
sanctions.The Kosovo massacre hurt Serbia in two ways. First, it
put off the day when the West will remove the ``outer wall'' of
economic sanctions against Serbia. Secondly, Serbian President
Milosevic is said to have pushed Yugoslavia towards disintegration.
Even before the violence unleased against Kosovo, it opted in
favour of outright independence from Serbia.According to
international observers, the low-level war that Serbian President
Milosevic began against separatists in Kosovo seemed to be getting
worse.
	   Serbs in some parts of Kosovo are said to be fleeing their
homes, prompted either by the presence of guerrillas from the
Kosovo Liberation Army or by Serb police preparing for offensive.
The Kosovo crisis has other aspects. The Serbian president had
declared that the local elections in 1992 won by a vast majority by
ethnic Albanians were null and void and thereafter carried out
rampant arrest of nationalists. But the Albanian nationalists,
ignoring the government ban, elected Dr. Ibrahim Rugova as their
president of a self-proclaimed Republic of Kosovo which triggered a
severe conflict in the Serbian government of Belgrade.In the
opinion of impartial observers, the Serbian authorities have shown
an uncanny genius since the Croatian and Bosnian wars, to dub
ethnic self-defence and articulation of demand in this respect as
acts of terrorism provoking the most brutal action conceivable in
the military dictionary.
	   Hoping to stamp out the sparks of Kosovo before they ignite a
conflagration like Bosnia's, the US and the European Union resolved
to act more forcefully to try to bring peace to the Balkans.The
six-nation Contact Group, which lately met in Rome amid the
prospect of an escalating Kosovo crisis, slapped new sanctions on
Belgrade and gave it 10 days to open dialogue with ethnic Albanian
leaders in Kosovo or risk tougher penalties.Discontent would be
likely to grow if the Contact Group did tighten sanctions. Already
Serbia's economy is on the verge of free fall. The long heralded
economic reforms have become a bad joke. Milosevic, however, seemed
to be inviting further hardship. He earlier ignored the Contact
Group's request to withdraw special-ministry police from Kosovo. He
rebuffed urgings that foreigners should mediate in talks with
Kosovo's separatists.Warning of the danger of a wider war in the
Balkans, two top American envoys Richard Holbrook and Robert
Gelbard paid surprise visit to Yugoslav President Milosevic and
increased the pressure to negotiate an end to the turmoil in the
restive Kosovo province.
	   Milosevic had so far refused independence and rejected foreign
mediation for any talks with the Albanians. In view of the
ultimatum given by the Contact Group and the pressure exerted by
the US envoys. Yugoslav President Milosevic agreed to meet Kosovo's
independent-minded ethnic Albanian Leader Ibrahim Rugova. Rugova
met for the first time with the Yugoslav President on April 15 in
an attempt to resolve the crisis. The next day thousands of ethnic
Albanians demonstrated in Kosovo's capital Pristina against the
Serbian government's harsh rule. Rugova, head of the strongest
ethnic Albanian political party in Kosovo, advocates a peaceful
road to independence. On the other hand, Milosevic and his
leftist-nationalist alliance gave no signs whether they would make
any concession to the demands of the ethnic Albanians or not. It
took intense diplomatic activities by the top US envoys to the
Balkans to get Rugova and Milosevic to meet each other. This
meeting is expected to be followed up subsequently with a series of
meetings in Kosovo's capital.
	   Meanwhile,there has been no let-up in the trouble in Kosovo.The
all-important point in the Kosovo crisis is not to miss out the
essence of ethnic grievance of the Albanians. Real progress would
require Milosevic, who rose to power by whipping up hatred against
Kosovo's Albanians, to treat them decently even though Kosovo's
angry young men replenish the ranks of the Kosovo Liberation Army
(KLA), giving him excuses for further brutality. According to an
astute international observer, this is the Balkans where the
mistakes of history have been learned so well that everyone seems
able to repeat them exactly. Everyone agreed it would be folly to
continue the fighting; yet as one government official in Pristina
put it: ``We're Serbs, they're Albanians-anything could
happen.''There are other aspects of Milosevic's predicament.
	   Confrontation with the West is sharpening old Balkan enmities
and creating new ones for Milosevic. Milo Djukanovic, president of
another constituent of the Frearation, namely, Montenegro, who
ousted a Milosevic crony in an election in October last, is growing
more hostile. Milosevic has apparently decided to fight his
Montenegrin rival rather than win him over. Milosevic's other new
fight-with Dodik in Bosnia's Serb Republic- could also be
dangerous. At some point Milosevic's lengthening list of enemies
could threaten the survival of rump Yugoslavia itself.
	   The man who started the bloodiest European war in a generation,
is once again tearing at the fragile fabric of Balkan peace. Once
again it is hard to tell whether Milosevic is shoring up his
position or unwittingly plotting his own destruction. In subsequent
developments, scheduled talks between the Albanian leader Ibrahim
Rugova and the Serbian President Milosevic on the future of Kosovo
province were postponed due to the visit to Washington of the
Albanian leader. The United States hopes that the visit of the
Albanian leader will encourage his fellow Kosovo Albanians to
pursue non-violence in their struggle with Serbia.
	   It is also hoped by the US that the visit will not only
reinforce Albanian leader Rugova's stature with Milosevic but also
among his fellow Albanians, including those sympathetic to the KLA.

Ethiopian minister rules out direct negotiations with Eritrea
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Ethiopia will not negotiate directly with
Eritrea because it is occupying Ethiopian land, the country's
foreign minister said Friday.
	   Ethiopian Foreign Minister Seyoum Mesfin arrived in Cairo for
talks with the Egyptian government, which Eritrea has asked to
mediate the border war that broke out last month.
	   ``Direct negotiations are impossible because it is unacceptable
for someone to come and occupy your territory and tell you 'come
and negotiate with me,''' Mesfin told reporters at Cairo airport.
	   ``It is against international law.''
	   Mesfin was met by Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa and was
scheduled to hold talks later Friday with President Hosni Mubarak.
	   His visits comes a day after Abdullah Mahmoud Jaber, an adviser
to Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki, left Cairo after asking Egypt
to mediate the conflict.
	   Border skirmishes broke out on May 6 when Ethiopia accused
Eritrea of occupying a swath of land along their border.

	   MALACCA, Thurs. - The State Government has been directed to
submit a status report on its industrial composite centre in Taboh
Naning, Alor Gajah, as its progress was not satisfactory.
	   The development of the area, supposed to be the country's main
composite industrial centre, has not reached expectations.
	   International Trade and Industry Minister Datuk Seri Rafidah
Aziz said there was a lot more to be done to expand the project.
	   Speaking after chairing the state-level industrial development
and co- ordination meeting, she said the matter which was one of
the subjects discussed needed to be given emphasis by the State
Government.
	   ``We have reviewed the overall development...it is still
concentrated on Phase One, that is production of light Eagle
aircraft components.
	   ``It is the hope of the Government that this area could also
become the venue for other projects that require composite
materials in its productions or for its research and development
activity.''
	   She said the State Government had been asked to submit a status
report on the project to enable her ministry to line up future
programmes for the area.
	   ``The Government has earmarked Malacca as the country's
composite industrial development centre. It looks like a lot needs
to be done. With the report, the Federal Government, through my
ministry, will be able to assist to expand the project.'' ``
	   Rafidah also revealed that the State Government had identified
134 hectares in Serkam for `halal food' activities.
	   She said export-oriented `halal food' productions would be
carried out by both local and foreign investors to penetrate the
global market.
	   A joint committee comprising representatives from the State
Government and Federal Government had been formed to identify
viable produce.
	   She added the Economic Planning Unit in the Prime Minister's
Department had approved the project and its allocations.
	   Rafidah also said a technical committee had been formed to
oversee the development of the inland port in Taboh Naning.

	   MALACCA, Thurs. - All States, through their respective State
Economic Development Corporations, have been asked to set up a
`cost detection unit' so that Malaysia can continue to remain
cost-competitive in the global market.
	   This is also to enhance efficiency in the industrial and trade
sectors.

industries and businesses to expand.
	   ``This unit must be set up so that we will be able to determine
the norms and standards of the costs.
	   ``These standards will become the benchmark for comparison. If
the cost goes up, we will know how to react by taking the necessary
measures,'' she said after chairing the state-level industrial
development and co- ordination meeting today.
	   Also present were Chief Minister Datuk Seri Abu Zahar Isnin, who
is also State Development Corporation chairman, his deputy Datuk
Ibrahim Durum, other Executive Council members and industrialists
operating in Malacca.
	   Rafidah said local and foreign investors and businessmen should
strive to ensure the country remained an ideal cost-competitive
location.
	   ``There is a need for us to determine the actual costs. If there
is no proper monitoring, we will lose our competitiveness,'' she
said.
	   She also said the Federal Government and agencies including her
ministry would assist SEDCs to determine the cost price for
industries and trade.
	   She said benchmark marking was important to enable Malaysia to
compete with other countries.
	   ``Once this becomes an exercise, it will become our business
culture. We will know how to react when costs go up. We will become
more efficient and conscious to save costs.''

	   Foreign Relations Secretary Rosario Green joined U.S. Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright at a press conference on Operation
Casablanca Thursday, Associated Press reported.
	   Green noted that both governments were taking steps to improve
cooperation and communication on drug enforcement, including the
installation of direct telephone lines between the two foreign
relations offices.
	   As for Operation Casablanca, Green said, ''The investigation has
to be pursued according to law.'' But Albright put limits Thursday
on American cooperation with a Mexican investigation into alleged
violations of Mexican law by the U.S. undercover agents who carried
out the anti-narcotics sting operation in Mexico.
	   Saying that the United States will cooperate ''as possible,''
she added that prosecution and extradition of American agents would
be counterproductive. She spoke after Cabinet-level discussions on
a range of cross-border issues.
	   Her comments raised the possibility of a conflict with Mexican
authorities, who are preparing to accuse the U.S. agents of a
series of violations while in Mexico carrying out Operation
Casablanca.
	   In a move that would obstruct any attempt to extradite the
agents, Alabama Republican Representative Spencer Bachus introduced
a proposal to Congress that would protect the agents, Notimex
reported.
	   U.S. House Resolution 288 states ``the United States should
reject the extraditions solicited by Mexico of the agents involved
in Operation Casablanca due to the actions they took in benefit of
the operation.''
	   Albright's statements and the accompanying legislative
maneuvering come on the same day the New York Times published an
article reporting that Albright and U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert
Rubin disagreed on whether or not to inform Mexican officials of
Operation Casablanca.
	   According to the article, Albright was willing to inform Mexican
authorities of the investigation, but Rubin decided to maintain its
secrecy.
	   The Secretary of State sent a letter to Rubin insisting that
``we need to do a better job of coordination,'' with Mexico.
	   During meetings held in November and December on the
investigation, U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno said the secrecy of
the investigation could have ``collateral'' effects on relations
with Mexico such as a negative reaction by financial markets in
addition to the expected diplomatic troubles.
	   However, Rubin decided to continue the secrecy of the operation
because of the Treasury Department's ``skepticism'' about
corruption in Mexico, the article reported.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Wed. - Work on a new collective agreement between
estate workers and the Malaysian Agriculture Producers Association
has begun after the old one expired last month, National Union of
Plantation Workers executive secretary A. Navamukundan said today.
	   Navamukundan was responding to a query about the status of a
group of plantation workers who staged a peaceful gathering outside
the gates of the Prime Minister's Department requesting a meeting
with Datuk Seri Dr Mahathir Mohamad to discuss monthly wages in
place of their current daily wages.
	   A letter was handed to an officer from the Prime Minister's
office at the gates.
	   The group - the Malaysian Support Committee for the Plantation
Community - claimed the workers were being victimised through a low
daily-wage structure and no annual increment or bonus.

	   One day after clashes in Chiapas left nine people dead, a
prominent federal deputy called on the congressional mediation body
Thursday to find persons of ``moral quality'' to help re-establish
peace talks, Notimex reported.
	   National Action Party (PAN) Deputy Santiago Creel Miranda said
the Conciliation and Pacification Commission (Cocopa) must appoint
negotiators with ``moral authority'' or that represent institutions
which have proven to be capable of contributing to peace in the
southeastern state.
	   ``Certainly Congress can not remain removed from the situation
when we have a commission like Cocopa, which must reinforce its
activities in order to facilitate the road to peace,'' said Creel.
	   Creel also disagreed with calls for the rebel Zapatista Army of
National Liberation (EZLN) and the government to meet face-to-face.
	   Members of Cocopa were not silent on Thursday either, Agence
France-Presse reported.
	   The legislative negotiating body made a ``desperate'' call to
the government to stop hostilities in Chiapas, which this week has
witnessed the most intense violence since the EZLN rebelled on Jan.
	   1, 1994.
	   Outside Mexico City, meanwhile, the 53 people arrested during
the skirmish between EZLN supporters and the Army in El Bosque
provided their declarations before the local Public Ministry,
Notimex reported.

	   PETALING JAYA, Thurs. - Motorists using Jalan Universiti which
has been turned into a one-way street due to pipe-laying works,
have been urged to be patient and bear with the inconvenience.
	   ``I apologise for the inconvenience but I hope everyone
understands that this project is very necessary to help solve the
current water woes,''
	   Puncak Niaga (M) Sdn Bhd executive chairman Datuk Rozali Ismail
told reporters after visiting the worksite in front of the
International Islamic University today.
	   He said Puncak Niaga would try to complete the works, scheduled
to take four months, as soon as possible. ``In the meantime, we are
continuously meeting with the Petaling Jaya Municipal Council to
see what we can do to ease the traffic congestion,''
	   he said, adding that more signs would be placed at various
places to inform and warn the public of road diversions.
	   The 1,800mm-diametre pipe being laid is part of a 71km supply
pipeline which will bring water from the Sungai Selangor Water
Supply Scheme Phase Two in Bukit Badong, Kuala Selangor, to the
Bukit Gasing reservoir.
	   The reservoir is expected to end the current rationing exercise
for consumers in Sections 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 11, 12, 14, 16, 17 and
Taman Seaport when the pipeline, which has a capacity of 250
million litres per day, is completed by the end of the year.

	   OAXACA, Oax. -- Police in Oaxaca say they are on the look-out
for a reprisal attack by the People's Revolutionary Army, which
lost 12 comrades in a bloody gunfight with police Sunday, Spanish
news agency EFE reported.
	   This state's Attorney General's Office said fears were piqued
Thursday by the detention of a presumed rebel who was arrested with
possession of weapons and ammunition.
	   The arrest was made in Oaxaca's Loxicha region known as a hotbed
of EPR activity. Eighty area Indians have been arrested with having
EPR ties.
	   Adalberto Pacheco Santiago was found in possession of three
high-powered guns, including one Israeli model commonly used by the
Guatemalan and El Salvador governments, and portable radio
communication gear.
	   Pacheco's mother told the local press Thursday that her
20-year-old son has been missing since January and pleaded to
judicial authorities not to make unfounded accusations.
	   The EPR first appeared in Guerrero on June 28, 1996, and carried
out a deadly three-town attack in Mexico on Aug. 29 that ended with
at least 10 dead.
	   Authorities have cracked down on the group, which operates
mainly in Pacific Coast states Guerrero and Oaxaca.
	   A Sunday shoot-out with a military patrol in the town of El
Charco in Guerrero ended with 12 killed and 26 detained. Theories
have swirled as to what sparked the shoot-out or what the EPR was
doing at El Charco. One theory suggested EPR members were attending
a meeting at a local schoolhouse with another indigenous guerrilla
group, the EPRI, when soldiers discovered them.
	   Yet another theory says members of the EPR have admitted they
were trying to recruit local residents in the mountainous El Charco
region when they were discovered by soldiers.
	   The Associated Press reported, though, that no local townspeople
were among the dead at El Charco. All 11 were alleged active EPR
members, officials said. Only the three men who ran into the school
building were actually armed. The clash at the schoolhouse in El
Charco, was among the bloodiest clashes since the EPR emerged in
June 1996.
	   Among the 27 people arrested after the clash, two have admitted
being active members of the EPR and have given authorities
information about the group's operations, the statement said.
	   It said two EPR members, identified as Ericka Zamora Pardo and
Efren Cortez Chavez, told authorities they were holding a
recruitment meeting in the schoolhouse and planned to spend the
night there.

	   PETALING JAYA, Thurs. - The Malaysian Contingent V, which has
served under the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation's Stabilisation
Force in Bosnia- Herzegovina, will be disbanded at the Desa
Pahlawan Camp in Kota Baru on July 18.
	   Armed Forces chief Jen Tan Sri Ismail Omar said today that
Defence Minister Datuk Seri Syed Hamid Albar would officiate the
ceremony, marking the end of Malaysia's large-scale peacekeeping
involvement in Bosnia- Herzegovina.
	   Ismail said that the members of Malcon V and their equipment
would then be absorbed and redeployed into the mainstream of the
various army, navy and air force units.
	   Ismail said this after receiving the advanced group of 300
Malcon V soldiers, led by Mejar Zulkafli Abdul Aziz, who returned
home tonight on board a chartered Malaysia Airlines DC-10 aircraft
at the Royal Malaysian Air Force base in Subang.
	   The aircraft, which was delayed due to technical hitches,
arrived from Split, Croatia at 7.30pm.
	   Also present to greet the Malcon V members were Army chief Jen
Datuk Seri Mohd Zahidi Zainuddin, RMAF chief Lt Jen Datuk Seri
Ahmad Saruji Che Rose and senior Armed Forces' officers.
	   Ismail said that Malcon V's main group of 278 soldiers would
arrive on June 24 with the final group of 211 soldiers on July 10.
	   The 789-strong Malcon V, which began its tour of duty on Dec 25
last year under the command of Kol Syed Khalid Syed Mahmood,
comprised 80 officers, 704 other ranks and five civillians.
	   Malcon V, Ismail said, would be replaced by the combined
Belgium- Luxembourg force.
	   ``A handing-over ceremony, to be officiated by the Malaysian
ambassador to Bosnia-Herzegovina, will be held on June 22 at

	   With the withdrawal of Malcon V following the end of Nato's
mandate, Malaysia's stint in Bosnia-Herzegovina will not end as the
Government had approved up to 50 soldiers to be deployed there.
	   ``The 50, who will be part of Nato's Deterrent Force assigned to
remove landmines and bring war criminals to justice, will be sent
as early as next month.''

	   Public Safety Secretary Rodolofo Debernardi Debernardi is
revamping his department, getting rid of the subsecretariat and
reorganizing lower offices, reported Federal District Legislative
Assembly Dep. Armando Salinas Torre.
	   After conducting a work meeting with Debernardi, Salinas Torre,
of the pro-business National Action Party (PAN) who serves as the
president of the Committee on Public Safety, said that the
secretariat is lacking a sound crime prevention program and that
until now only emergency plans have been drawn up.
	   Salinas Torre said the only plans implemented have been
``reaction cells'' and new special security efforts now being
provided in 14 neighborhoods -- plans Debernardi presented about
two weeks ago to the local legislative assembly, known as the ALDF.
	   But Salinas Torre said Debernardi did not give sufficient
answers, failing to respond to how officers are selected for the
police corps and how they are picked to be placed in the
neighborhood anti-crime program. ``It is seen a 'programmed
diarrhea' now that the government has not been capable of including
a total program of Public Safety, nor of structuring new
programs,'' Salinas Torre said.
	   The local legislator described as serious the fact that 28
separate departments within the Public Safety Secretariat have no
department heads.
	   Salinas Torre said during Debernardi's meeting with legislators
the minimum salary for police officers is 3,507 pesos a month.
Nevertheless, Debernardi said, fewer police are following paths
into corruption.
	   Salinas Torre said ``instead of a secretary, we have a chief of
a sectorship who can tell us how many units are in bad shape or the
number of police that there are, but not the foundations of his
crime-fighting operation.''

	   IPOH, Thurs. - The City Council plans to turn two prime lots
into multi- storey car parks to ease the acute shortage.
	   The proposed projects are in Jalan Osborne, behind the Majestic
Cinema, and Jalan Datuk Onn Jaafar, behind the Ocean Supermarket,
city councillor Lee Heng said today.
	   They will create an extra 200 to 300 parking places.
	   The projects will be privatised, Lee said during an inspection
of a new parking area at Jalan Raja Ekram near the Regalodge Hotel.
	   The council is also considering allowing parking in some
backlanes and over the Sungai Kinta that runs through the city.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Thurs. - Law students in Australian and New
Zealand universities who enrolled on or before April 30, and who
have commenced studies will be exempted from sitting the
Certificate in Legal Practice to qualify as a lawyer in Malaysia.
	   Legal Profession Qualifying Board chairman Tan Sri Mohtar
Abdullah announced this decision, made on June 3, in a statement
today.
	   The announcement reverses the board's earlier decision requiring
students who graduate after May 1 next year to pass the CLP, which
means that only final-year students are exempted.
	   Mohtar said the decision to exempt current students was made
after the board considered appeals from students, parents and deans
of Australian law schools.
	   The exemption will only apply to students in full-time study who
have commenced their first year or first semester in a law course,
and who will complete the course in Australia or New Zealand. This
includes students within recognised twinning programmes.
	   However, students who transfer courses from a university outside
Australia and New Zealand into one in these two countries are not
exempted.
	   Students enrolling on or after May 1, are also bound by the
guidelines.
	   Exempted students will be required to obtain a certificate from
the board.
	   ``The decision and the process of its implementation have been
conveyed to all recognised universities in Australia and New
Zealand,'' Mohtar said.
	   Besides the new CLP requirement, the guidelines which came into
force on April 30 also set criteria for the recognition of degrees
from the two countries.
	   The criteria will also apply only to those who enrolled on or
after April 30.
	   The issuance of the guidelines is a move to standardise the
entry requirements to the Malaysian Bar.
	   They are similar to those issued in 1995 for universities in the
United Kingdom.
	   The 14 recognised Australian universities are Monash University,
University of Melbourne, Australian National University, University
of Sydney, University of Adelaide, University of Western Australia,
Macquarie University, University of New South Wales, University of
Queensland, University of Tasmania, University of Technology in
Sydney, Bond University in Queensland, Murdoch University and
Queensland University of Technology.
	   The five recognised universities in New Zealand are University
of Auckland, University of Canterbury, Victoria University of
Wellington, University of Otago and University of Waikato.

	   Mayor Cuauhtemoc Cardenas not only encourages a culture of
irresponsibility, but also breaks the law, said local PAN and PT
deputies, who say they are angry that a mandatory car-insurance
program has been shelved for a year.
	   ``The PAN demands that Cardenas rectifies that error,'' said
Pablo Jaime Jimenez, of the pro-business National Action Party
(PAN).
	   Jimenez said Cardenas needs to let the local legislative
assembly, known as the ALDF, debate the postponement of the SUVA
insurance program.
	   His comments also seemed targeted at Federal District officials
who said they were suspending the SUVA plan to foster ``a culture
of responsibility'' among Mexico City citizens. The plan was to go
into effect July 1, 1998 and requires Mexico City's more than 3
million cars to have third-party car insurance.
	   Cardenas on Wednesday declared that implementation of the SUVA
plan be delayed until July 1, 1999, provoking a backlash only a few
days before it was to go into effect. Moreover, mix-ups this week
between Cardenas and staff members confused the time of
postponement to between six months and one year. In his statements
Thursday Jimenez called Cardenas a lawbreaker because the mayor did
not go through proper legislative channels to validate postponement
of SUVA.
	   ``If they admit these arbitrary rulings, there will be a
negative feeling against the government and society because if the
government violates the law and it is allowed, afterward it will
have no moral authority to demand that the people follow the law,''
Jimenez said.
	   Shortly after Cardenas took office Dec. 5, 1997, Federal
District transportation officials heralded the SUVA plan as part of
an improved and revamped Federal District traffic code, which
included beefed-up transit laws. Besides SUVA, fines were increased
and the city passed an ordinance requiring all drivers to buckle
up.
	   Mix-ups this week have confused the situation. Wednesday
Cardenas said the insurance system would be postponed one year, but
Tuesday he said the plan was being suspended for only six months.
	   On Tuesday Federal District Transportation Director Raymundo
Artis Espriu and Federal District spokesman Javier Gonzalez Garza
offered a news conference in which they made pains to assert it was
unknown when the SUVA program would enter into full force.
	   Contrary to Cardenas' statements, Gonzalez Garza said the exact
start date would not be known until this coming Monday. Gonzalez
Garza also said officials were delaying the plan in order to foster
``a culture of responsibility.''
	   Cardenas explained that one of the reasons to postpone the full
entry of the insurance system is that authorities still have not
yet determined how cars from other federal or state entities will
be handled if they are found in violation of the SUVA law.
	   But despite the apparently mixed signals between Cardenas and
lower Federal District officials, one thing seems certain: the city
may lose the insurance program simply from disinterest by citizens.
	   Of the little more than 3 million cars that are driven in the
Federal District, only 850,000 -- not even a third -- have
insurance.
	   People do not seem very interested in complying with the
program, citing a lack of money, although the fine for not
complying with the SUVA will be 25 minimum daily salaries -- more
than 300 pesos.
	   More than 20,000 people have been injured in automobile
accidents in 1998, according to figures offered by the city
prosecutor's office (PGJDF).
	   Monterrey company Aba/Seguros said that it has already begun to
offer the SUVA to the public at the cost of 299 pesos annually,
including IVA. Another company was quoted as selling the SUVA at an
annual cost of about 450 pesos.
	   Some ALDF deputies and many city officials said they were happy
with the decision to postpone the entrance of the SUVA system.
	   ``It would be very difficult that in July the sanction program
would enter in vigor, now that there are many things to clarify,
such as who will be responsible for not verifying what had been
completed and where and how violators would be prosecuted,'' said
the president of the ALDF's Transportation and Ways Committee,
Elvira Albarran.
	   Authorities say drivers who have already bought insurance do not
need to worry because coverage will start beginning July 1, 1999.
	   A Monterrey insurance company said that it has already begun to
offer the SUVA to the public at the cost of 299 pesos annually,
including IVA. Another company was quoted as selling the SUVA at an
annual cost of about 450 pesos.

	   KULIM, Thurs. - Despite the economic slowdown, the Education
Ministry will proceed with its proposed conversion scheme for
certificate holders among teachers to enable them to enjoy the same
starting salary as their diploma-holder counterparts.
	   Minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak said the teachers would not
be required to enrol in teacher training colleges again to enjoy
the same starting pay.
	   ``We are working on a conversion programme based on their
experience.
	   ``There is a scheme that we are working on and I will announce
it later,''
	   he said after launching the Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Sultan
Badlishah's golden anniversary celebrations here today. The school
was established in 1948.
	   Also present were State Assemblymen for Kulim and Lunas Datuk
Yong Pau Chak and Dr Joe Fernandez respectively and school
principal Abdul Rahim Mohd Said. He stressed the conversion
exercise would be carried out progressively, possibly next year.
	   Najib was asked if the Government was still considering allowing
certificate holders among teachers to enjoy the same starting
salary as diploma-holder teachers.
	   Yesterday, he announced the promotion of 3,000 graduate and
non-graduate teachers under an exercise, involving RM18.9 million,
to reward long- serving teachers.
	   When the diploma course programme was introduced at all teacher
training colleges in 1996, the ministry had also announced that
certificate holders among teachers should attend special courses
for up to eight weeks at the colleges to enjoy the starting salary
of their diploma-holder counterparts.
	   Earlier, Najib said that the Ministry had allocated RM5 million
to train 1,780 information technology trainees and to conduct IT
courses for 30,000 primary and secondary school teachers.

Moderate Bosnian Serbs and hard-liners form coalitions each
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By IRENA GAJIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANJA LUKA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Hard-liners and
reformists, two main power blocs in the Bosnian Serb republic,
Friday formed coalitions, teaming up for September elections in
Bosnia.
	   In Banja Luka, in northwestern Bosnia, moderate Bosnian Serb
leaders, triumphant and cheering, joined hands to seal their fresh
alliance in a move aimed at winning key points ahead of the ballot.
	   The three reformist Bosnian Serb parties united forces by
signing an accord to run as a coalition titled ``Harmony.''
	   The three parties, with Western support, already dominate the
government of the Serb-controlled half of Bosnia.
	   Their new alliance is intended to secure them three top
positions: the republic's presidency and two posts reserved for
Serbs in Bosnia's joint presidency and government.
	   The Serb National Alliance, Socialist Party and the Independent
Social Democrats are expected to agree on a joint slate of three
candidates for the posts, with each party contributing one. The
leader of the Serb National Alliance, Biljana Plavsic, is thought
likely to be the consensus choice for Serb Republic president, a
post she already holds.
	   Meanwhile, Bosnian Serb hard-liners, comprising loyalists of
war-time leader Radovan Karadzic, and the ultranationalist Radical
Party formed their own coalition Friday in the eastern Bosnian town
of Bijeljina, the Bosnian Serb news agency Srna reported.
	   The hard-liners announced that their joint candidate to run
against Plavsic for the Bosnian Serb presidency would be Nikola
Poplasen from the ranks of ultranationalists.
	   Poplasen and Aleksa Buha, from Karadzic's party, signed the
coalition agreement and said they would later come up with the
names of their joint candidates for the other two top posts.
	   If successful, the reformists' alliance could unseat two key
Bosnian Serb hardliners: Momcilo Krajisnik, who holds the Serb seat
in the three-man Bosnian presidency, and Boro Bosic, who is a
co-chairman in Bosnia's joint government.

	   MUAR, Thurs. - A shellfish collector had the shock of her life
when she found carcasses of monkeys on the branches of mangrove
trees and in the swamps near Parit Jawa fishing village today.
	   Rahmah Ibrahim, 40, said: ``From the stench, I believe the
monkeys must have died a few days ago.''
	   She believed the animals must have died after eating poisoned
fruits as there were some near the carcasses.
	   Village businessman Mansur Poh said he had reported the matter
to the Wildlife and National Parks Department.

WTO chief: Countries must cooperate on free trade and environment
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Efforts to promote free trade will continue,
despite environmental and labor problems, the World Trade
Organization chief said.
	   WTO chief Renato Ruggiero insisted, however, that countries must
cooperate more to reconcile free trade with those concerns,
Ruggiero said in a speech to the Hamburg-based Friedrich Ebert
Foundation, a research group.
	   ``We must stop viewing the world through a narrow lens and begin
to look at the various challenges we face as pieces of a larger
puzzle demanding broader, more integrated solutions,'' Ruggiero
said in his speech Thursday. A copy of the speech was released in
Geneva on Friday.
	   Despite protests that the free trade system contributes to
poverty, unemployment and environmental problems, ministers last
month told the WTO to prepare for talks to further open the world
economy.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton and others, however, pledged to try
to make the organization and the global trade system more sensitive
to environmental and labor concerns.
	   Ruggiero said the best way to address the worries is through the
system itself. ``If people, especially young people, say
unemployment is too high, they are right. If environmentalists say
growth must be sustainable _ and not destroy the planet's essential
equilibrium _ they are right.
	   ``But none of these international _ and national _ problems will
be resolved any easier by restricting trade, closing borders, or
undermining the international rule of law _ as embodied in the
WTO.''

affected by the fire that occurred in that place in May, forcing
many retailers out of business.
	   Accompanied by Venustiano Carranza borough delegate, Ramon
Sosamontes, Cardenas passed out loans ranging between 4,000 and
10,000 pesos for the purpose of helping to jump-start businesses in
the market affected by the fire.
	   During the handing over of the loans, Sosamontes reaffirmed his
commitment ``for the market to recover its capacity.''Sosamontes
told stall owners that the government mission's is to support small
business owners and, in particular the merchants of La Merced, so
that they can acquire merchandise until the market is repaired and
is in better condition than it was before the fire.
	   In an interview after the tour, Cardenas said that police
operations will continue to attempt to control the numbers of
street merchants, who are known as ambulantes.
	   He also remade his invitation to the political parties and to
the ambulantes' organizations to establish a dialogue that
contributes to finding alternatives to solve the problem.

Human rights group condemns Israeli travel restrictions on
</HEADLINE>
Palestinians &QL; 
 &UR; By JACK KATZENELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel's failure to open a ``safe passage'' to
allow Palestinians to travel between the West Bank and the Gaza
Strip constitutes collective punishment and is causing unacceptable
hardship, an Israeli human rights group charged Friday.
	   In the Israel-Palestinian agreements, Israel recognized that the
West Bank and the Gaza Strip constitute ``a single territorial
unit'' and promised to open the ``safe passage'' permitting freedom
of movement between them.
	   But two years have passed and Israel has not carried out this
commitment, citing security reasons. A limited number of
Palestinians cross between the two areas each week in convoys
guarded by Israeli border police.
	   In a report entitled ``Divide and Rule,'' the Betselem human
rights group says the Israeli policy constitutes collective
punishment.
	   ``The severance between the Gaza Strip and the West Bank
precludes development of communal, social, economic and political
life of the residents of the two areas,'' and ``creates two
Palestinian societies with weak ties between them,'' the report
says.
	   The report says Israel makes it easier for a Palestinian to get
a permit to work in Israel than to cross between the two areas.
About 72,000 Palestinian workers and businessmen have permits to
work in Israel, while only 600 permits are issued each week for
passage between the two areas.
	   To obtain a work permit, a Palestinian must be over 23, married
and with no record of crime or security offenses. To make the
crossing men must be over 45 and women over 35 and with a clean
record.
	   These discrepancies cast doubt on the claim that the
restrictions are purely for security reasons, the report argues.
	   The division has particularly devastating effects on families,
the report says. It cites the case of Hanan Sheikh Ahmed, a married
woman from the Gaza Strip who traveled to the West Bank to be with
her dying father while he underwent surgery, and was then refused a
permit to return on the grounds that she was under 35. Only after a
year, when a human rights group intervened, was she allowed to
return.
	   The restrictions also affect students living in the Gaza Strip
but studying in the West Bank, who are sometimes unable to get to
the university.
	   An Israeli official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Friday the ``safe passage'' could have been opened a long time ago
were it not for Palestinian intransigence. ``They insist on an
extra-territorial corridor, with no Israeli security checks
whatsoever,'' he told The Associated Press.
	   ``If they had accepted our proposals, a much larger number of
Palestinians would be making the crossing today and they would find
it much more convenient than the present situation,'' the official
said.
	   The restrictions were tightened in the wake of a series of
suicide bombings by Islamic militants in Israeli cities, he said.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's policy adviser David
Bar-Illan said the delay in the opening of the ``safe passage'' was
``due entirely to security considerations based on the constant and
very real threat of terrorism.''

Albanians happy with NATO decision on show of force
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With NATO-Kosovo &QL; 
 &UR; By JEFFREY ULBRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Albania's defense minister said Friday
he was delighted with NATO's decision to make a show of force in
the Balkans because it is clear Yugoslavia wants to dominate the
separatist province of Kosovo militarily.
	   Luan Hajdaraga, in Brussels for a meeting between NATO and 27
partner countries in the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council, spoke a
day after the alliance decided to conduct air exercises over
Albania and Macedonia to put pressure on Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic.
	   That show of power, expected sometime next week, was one of
several steps taken by the 16-nation North Atlantic Treaty
Organization to persuade Milosevic to stop his offensive against
ethnic Albanians in the southern Serbian province of Kosovo, where
they make up the vast majority of the population.
	   ``We are very pleased about the decision taken by the NATO
Council yesterday,'' Hajdaraga said in an interview.
	   ``The stand of Milosevic in the Kosovo crisis is very clear, it
is to dominate the situation by military means.'' The danger is, he
said, that ``those means can spread to Albania.''

	   IT started out as Fire, then it was Energy. Now, it's Lost City.
In case you're wondering how this new-look joint in Kuala Lumpur
rates, Lost City is a great pick for night-crawlers.
	   Just two weeks old, it has everything - from a disco to karaoke
and music spinned by deejays to live shows.
	   Currently cooking up a storm are two experienced bands (not from
the Philippines, mind you!) called Freedom and N.R.G.
	   Yes, you've seen and heard them before. Freedom (of Mulanya Di
Sini fame) alternates with N.R.G. (which certainly has a helluva
lot of energy!!!) nightly with their brand of rock, pop, Top 40
hits and the works.
	   Freedom, with Shuib on drums, belts out hits such as Elton
John's The Way You Look Tonight, Joan Jett's I Hate Myself For
Loving You and Celine Dion's My Heart Will Go On.
	   And you simply have to watch N.R.G. This nine-member band has
great showmanship and delivers solid renditions of current
chart-toppers. Almost all its members can sing, but the best part
is that you can, too. How?
	   Simply ``get lost'' in any of the 16 karaoke rooms which are
free if you book for a certain period. In other words, have a solid
three-hour concert there yourself!!! Also, check out Ning Baizura
who will be appearing tonight and tomorrow, at 10pm.
	   Lost City is open daily until 1am. It is located in Lorong P.
Ramlee.
	   You can't miss it.

Anti-nuclear demonstrators urge Group of Eight nations to disarm
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JENNY E. HELLER
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Demonstrators shouted ''Stop the nuclear
hyprocrisy!'' and ''Bin the bomb!'' Friday outside St. James's
Palace, directing their messages at foreign ministers meeting
nearby to discuss the crisis over India and Pakistan.
	   Three-dozen representatives from the London-based Campaign for
Nuclear Disarmament urged the foreign ministers of the Group of
Eight industrial powers to take specific steps toward a complete
ban of nuclear weapons.
	   ''We are here to make sure they can't ignore the issue,'' said
William Peden, the group's parliamentary officer. ''It's given them
a bit of a sore ear, and all the people driving past are getting
the message even if the G-8 don't.''
	   India and Pakistan exploded their first nuclear bombs last
month, but have said they had no plans for further tests.
	   After a Friday morning session, the foreign ministers from
Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia and the
United States decided to stop all non-humanitarian aid to the two
countries and to urge them to halt nuclear tests and deployment of
any nuclear weapons.
	   But the anti-nuclear demonstrators sought stronger action.
	   They demanded the establishment of an ad-hoc committee in Geneva
to discuss disarmament, and for the G-8 leaders to sign on to
Ireland's initiative proposed Tuesday, which would urge nuclear
powers to disarm within a few years.
	   The anti-nuclear protestors had to compete with a larger group
from the Serbian province of Kosovo, members of the Albanian
minority in the region seeking asylum in Britain.
	   They, too, were using shouts and signs to try to influence the
foreign ministers, who spent the afternoon discussing a reponse to
the Serbs' agression against ethnic Albanians.
	   ''We want NATO to go into Kosovo,'' protestor Burim Trishtina
said. ''First, we must secure all the people, and then make a
dialogue. There is no dialogue if someone holds arms to your
head.''

Weather summary for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   Weather summary for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands from
the National Weather Service.
	   Overnight, skies were variably cloudy across the east third of
Puerto Rico eastward through the U.S. Virgin Islands. Doppler radar
noted widely scattered to scattered showers, a few locally heavy
moving westward less than 10 mph and across this area. Showers will
continue here until around 8 a.m. Mostly clear to partly cloudy
skies persisted elsewhere across Puerto Rico. Predawn coastal
temperatures ranged from around 70 degrees across west Puerto Rico
to the upper 70s elsewhere across Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin
Islands.
	   The upper-level trough which contributed to recent heavy rains
continued to weaken and for this afternoon this should prevent the
development of heavy showers across most of the local area. Still,
the local atmosphere remained unstable enough for daytime heating
interacting with the sea breeze and mountain influences to spark
scattered showers and isolated afternoon thunderstorms across
mainly the western highlands and west sections of Puerto Rico.
	   The next tropical wave expected to affect our region was located
overnight over the central tropical Atlantic and is expected to
move into the eastern Caribbean during the first part of the coming
week.

	   A global market bloodbath dragged the peso and stock market down
further Thursday, increasing prospects of further budget cuts and
monetary tightening.
	   ``It was bloodshed all over - equities in emerging markets,
global bonds, currencies, commodities,''
	   said Santander Currency Trader Hector Kalb.''Everyone suffered,
it was a big flight to quality.''
	   The peso closed at 9.04 against the dollar versus Wednesday's
close of 8.90, its lowest since the new peso's introduction in
1993.
	   The market's IPC index lost 2.44 percent to close at a
seven-month low of 4289.31 points.
	   Analysts said there is little question the peso is suffering
from external shocks, not Mexico's fundamentals.
	   Asia's markets tumbled overnight as the Yen's exchange value
fell to almost an eight-year low of 143.50.
	   ``This has nothing to do with Mexico's fundamentals at all,''
said Kalb.
	   ``This is just a shift in portfolios.''
	   So unless the world situation makes a quick turn around --
unlikely in light of Russia's failed attempt to raise 7 billion
dollars in debt and the continued worsening of Asian economies --
the situation is not likely to improve in the short term.
	   Indeed it will probably worsen. ``The international situation is
being reflected in the Mexican market, said Felipe Garcia, Latin
American Economist with IDA.
	   And the only way that will change is if lenders of last resort
replenish the flows that usually keep the market steady, he said.
But they aren't there any more. ``They've taken their money and
run,'' Garcia said.
	   This trend is also reflected in foreign ownership of Mexican
treasury certificates (cetes), which has been hovering at about
10-12 percent. If the government perceives the peso's decline is
driving prices up and increasing inflation rates it may decide to
intervene.
	   ``Another budget cut seems inevitable and another monetary
tightening not far from happening,'' said Jorge de Gotari,
Santander's Latin American fixed-income analyst. A tightening of
monetary policy would mean higher interest rates and presumably
more interest in cetes and a stronger peso.
	   Gotari sees the potential government move as positive despite
the negative effects higher interest rates would have on bank
lending and outstanding debt.
	   ``Right now there are too many external factors that are out of
the government's hands,'' he said.
	   The most important of these are commodity prices, particularly
oil. Crude oil prices fell 5.4 percent to 12.75 dollars per barrel.
	   With about 38 percent of the government's revenues derived from
oil revenues, Finance Secretary Jose Angel Gurria, has already
implied that without a boost in prices, another budget cut will be
unavoidable.
	   The government has already cut the budget 2.85 billion dollars
this year.

Forensic experts complete exhumations on second mass grave
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ International forensic
experts have completed exhumations at a second mass-grave site in
eastern Bosnia, a U.N. news release said Friday.
	   Bodies and parts of bodies of some 200 people were found at the
two sites. The bodies were initially buried in other mass graves,
removed and then reburied at the sites and at an estimated 10 other
sites in the region in an apparent attempt to destroy evidence.
	   The international experts began exhumations last month to find
evidence of crimes committed during the 1995 Bosnian Serb offensive
against the eastern Muslim enclave of Srebrenica and to support
investigations and trials by the U.N. war crimes tribunal in The
Hague, Netherlands.
	   Up to 7,000 people, mainly men, are still missing and are
presumed to have been massacred by Bosnian Serbs overrunning the
enclave in July 1995.
	   The U.N. press release said some of the bodies had ``hands bound
behind their backs'' and were blindfolded.
	   The evidence appeared to corroborate survivors' reports that
after Srebrenica fell to the Serbs, many Muslims were summoned,
executed and buried in numerous mass graves in the region.

thousands of estate workers who do not receive a monthly wage.
These workers are still bound by a colonial wage structure despite
the colonialists having left 40 years ago! While the plantation
companies have made fabulous profits over the years the estate
workers' wages are about 60 per cent of the average wage of
manufacturing workers and they have remained stagnant in real terms
for 25 years.
	   The plantation sector has been the backbone of the economy and
has continually been a major source of foreign revenue in good as
well as bad times. However, the plantation worker has always been
mired in poverty and still trapped in poor living conditions in
many estates.
	   It is quite incredible that there are 60,000 vacancies in
plantations which need to be filled and the Government is planning
to recruit foreign workers. It is obvious that the plantation
sector is unable to attract or retain a viable workforce based on
the existing wage structure and living conditions.
	   In fact, Deputy Home Minister Datuk Tajol Rosli Ghazali had said
in January that even laid-off foreign workers from other sectors
are reluctant to work in the plantations due to the tough working
conditions and low pay.
	   It is in the long-term interest of plantation companies and the
Government to make the plantation sector more attractive by
dismantling the outdated wage structure and giving the workers
monthly wages. An attractive wage structure and decent housing will
ensure the sector has an adequate workforce. This and soaring palm
oil prices will help plantation companies increase their
productivity and profits.
	   For far too long the issue of plantation workers' wages has been
left to the plantation companies and workers' representatives to
decide through negotiations without much success. It is now time
for the Government to intervene in this process in the interest of
the country's economic recovery.
	   The committee has been campaigning for a minimum monthly wage,
annual increments and bonus payments similar to the other sectors
as well as better retirement benefits. It is time to correct the
historical injustices of the past and give fair and equitable wages
to estate workers.

World Cup: Zdravkov preserves 0-0 draw

 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with Chillavert, Bulgarian coach comments. &QL; 
 &UR; By DUSAN STOJANOVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MONTPELLIER, France (AP) _ Bulgarian goalkeeper Zdravko Zdravkov
leapt high to his right to deny Paraguayan counterpart Jose Luis
Chilavert from converting a second-half 25-meter free kick, leaving
the two sides with a goalless draw in their World Cup opener
Friday.
	   The Bulgarians played the final two minutes with only 10 men
after Anatoli Nankov earned his second yellow. Paraguay had two
good chances following the sending off, but failed to convert.
	   Chilavert, famous for coming forward on set pieces and as an
extra attacker, curled a left-footed blast over the wall in the
78th minute, only to have Zdravkov punch away the shot as it
approached the crossbar.
	   ``I already saw the ball in the net,'' Chillavert said after the
match. ``Too bad I did not score, I could have made history.'' No
goalkeeper has ever scored in regular time at World Cup games.
	   Saudi referee Abdul Rahman Al-Zeid awarded the free kick when
Trifon Ivanov hauled down Paraguayan forward Jorge Campos.
	   Paraguay dominated the second half, getting several chances
before Chilavert's free kick.
	   ``We lacked poise to finish the plays,'' Paraguay coach Paulo
Cesar Carpeggiani said. ``We always missed the last pass.''
	   Hristo Stoichkov set up the best Bulgarian opportunity in the
second half when he charged into the box from the left, crossed the
ball to an unmarked Luboslav Penev, who blasted high from six yards
with only Chilavert to beat.
	   ``We had some tactical errors on both sides of the defense,''
Carpeggiani said. '' But we made som adjustments and improved in
the second half. Unfortunately, it wasn't enough to win. We lacked
the finishing touch.''
	   The match was a game of missed opportunities.
	   Stoichkov hit the post in the 35th minute, beating two defenders
and knocking the ball off the upright with a left-footed shot which
had Chilavert totally beaten.
	   The Bulgarians, considered favorites in the Group D match,
opened up with several swift atacks and a shot by Kressimir Balakov
that just missed in the second minute.
	   Two minutes later, a Stoichkov was upended in the Paraguayan box
but his pleas to Al-Zeid went unheeded.
	   ``It was a 100 percent penalty,'' said Bulgarian coach Hristo
Bonev. ``We played well in the first half, but our game collapsed
in the second.''
	   The Paraguayans rarely threatened the Bulgarian goal, taking 19
minutes before Carlos Morales' got their first shot, a free kick
that had to be stopped by Zdravko with a diving save.
	   Their best chance of the half came in the 40th minute when
forward Jose Cardoso was left all alone in the Bulgarian penalty
area, but his shot from 15 meters skidded wide of the right post.
	   Stoichkov was yellow-carded in injury time for a reckless
tackle.

	   I REFER to the report on the phasing out of leaded petrol (New
Sunday Times, May 31).
	   I use leaded petrol for my car and I believe there are several
thousand other consumers or more owning and using vehicles that can
only take in leaded petrol, and who cannot afford to buy a new car.
	   We keep our old cars in running condition and do not mind paying
a little bit more per litre for leaded petrol.
	   Unless there is a cheap way to convert such vehicles for the use
of unleaded petrol and there are motor workshops willing to do so,
the move to phase it out can only be described as unwarranted and
unjustified.
	   As far as atmospheric pollution is concerned I feel there are
other bigger culprits to go after.
	   We have no other choice but to keep on using our old vehicles as
the cost of a new vehicle or even a second-hand one is prohibitive
in these trying times.
	   I appeal to the authorities to rethink their decision and allow
us to carry on using our vehicles instead of creating piles of junk
overnight.

U.N. war crimes tribunal to send investigators to Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JENIFER CHAO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ The Yugoslav war crimes tribunal
said Friday it is sending investigators to the troubled Serbian
province of Kosovo to check out reports of possible atrocities.
	   Details of the visit, to take place in the coming weeks, were
not disclosed. Tribunal chief prosecutor Louise Arbour said the
U.N. court's investigation aimed to send a signal to both sides to
follow the rules of war.
	   The investigation has been backed by the United States, said
David Scheffer, the U.S. ambassador for war crimes issues.
	   ``We've been extremely focused on the role the tribunal can and
might be able to play in investigating what appears to be very
serious criminal activities taking place in Kosovo,'' he said.
	   Ethnic Albanians, who comprise 90 percent of the southern
province's population, are demanding independence from Serbia,
which is one of two republics in the Yugoslav federation.
	   More than 250 people have died during clashes between government
forces and the Kosovo Liberation Army, the armed wing of the
Albanian independence movement.
	   The tribunal was established by the U.N. Security Council in
1993, and its jurisdiction covers all serious violations of
international humanitarian law committed in the former Yugoslavia
since 1991.

World Cup: Injury-plagued Croatia may have to revamp for opener
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TONY CZUCZKA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VITTEL, France (AP) _ Injuries may force Croatia to revamp its
team for Sunday's opener against fellow debutant Jamaica.
	   Defender Slaven Bilic remains in doubt with a muscle injury
suffered in a tuneup against Slovakia two weeks ago, coach Miroslav
Blazevic said Friday. With striker Alen Boksic already out with a
knee injury before the championship, Croatia's entire right side
could be in for a facelift.
	   And the team's top scorer, Davor Suker, was often benched at
European club champion Real Madrid this season because other
players were first choice ahead of him.
	   ``We have some problems because some players haven't had enough
competitive exposure,'' Blazevic said Friday. ``But overall, I'm
more than satisfied with the condition of the team after
practice.''
	   Despite Croatia's troubles with the health of some of its
veterans, anything other than a win in the night match at Lens
would be a major upset. A quarterfinalist in the 1996 European
Championship, its first major international tournament, Croatia is
expected to advance out of the World Cup's Group H along with
two-time champion Argentina.
	   Blazevic's lineup may yet contain a surprise or two, though.
	   Mario Stanic of Italy's Parma, a former Belgian league top
scorer, could move up from midfield to take Boksic's spot. But if
Bilic drops out _ or Blazevic rests him for the tougher next match
against Japan _ the coach would likely look for another solution.
	   True to his secretive style, Blazevic won't announce his lineup
until the day of the game.
	   The Croatians, two of whom played in the 1990 World Cup for
Yugoslavia, were preparing for their clash with the much-hyped
Jamaicans by reviewing videos of the ``Reggae Boyz'' in action.
	   In addition, defender Igor Stimac of Derby County was giving his
teammates tips on how to take on the Jamaicans, whose top players
are also with English clubs.
	   The Jamaican team angered the Croatians earlier this week by
ejecting two assistant coaches who had come to watch an open
practice. Croatia protested to soccer's governing body FIFA about
the incident.

Sampras loses in straight sets to Woodforde
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Updates with Rusedski injured in grafs

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Pete Sampras suffered a setback in his Wimbledon
preparations Friday when he was beaten in straight sets by
Australia's Mark Woodforde at the Queen's Club grass-court
tournament.
	   The top-seeded Sampras, who had a bye in the first round and
beat Wayne Black in the second round, looked flat as he slumped to
a 6-3, 6-2 defeat on his favorite surface.
	   It was the latest surprising loss for Sampras, who was ousted in
the second round of the French Open by little-known Ramon Delgado
of Paraguay.
	   Sampras had beaten the 66th-ranked Woodforde, known primarily as
a doubles specialist, in all of their previous 10 matches and
dropped only two sets in the process.
	   Sampras entered Queen's as a tuneup for Wimbledon, a tournament
he has won four times and where he is the defending champion.
	   Queen's also lost its No. 2 seed when Greg Rusedski of Britain
suffered an ankle injury during his third-round match against
Italian qualifier Laurence Tieleman.
	   With the score at 2-2 in the first set, Rusedski slipped while
stretching for a backhand volley and fell awkwardly with his left
leg buckling underneath him.
	   Rusedski screamed in pain and writhed on the grass before being
carried off the court and taken to a hospital for X-rays.
	   Tournament doctor Johnnie Gaynor said it appeared to be just a
sprain. It wasn't immediately clear whether the injury would force
Rusedski to miss Wimbledon, where he reached the quarterfinals last
year.
	   Sampras declined, 6th graf

Emir deciding whether to disband Parliament

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ Kuwaitis are waiting to see if the only elected
parliament in the Gulf will be dissolved Saturday after their prime
minister said he could no longer work with the legislature.
	   The prime minister, Sheik Saad al-Abdullah al-Sabah, has
reportedly accused the 50-seat legislature of blocking economic
reforms and showing disrespect for his Cabinet.
	   Lawmakers say they are insisting on the right to question
misappropriations of government money and expensive weapons deals.
	   The emir, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah, meets with the Cabinet
Saturday and is expected to decide whether to dissolve parliament
and call for elections, which should be held within two months.
	   Lawmaker Nasser al-Saneh said the emir is likely to shut down
the legislature.
	   Although Parliament has a large pro-government bloc, ``it turned
out to be a different creature'' that questions ministers and
scrutinizes weapons deals, he said.
	   Political analysts say that if elections are held, the new
legislature is likely to resemble the present one's composition.
	   Lawmakers have also been critical of laws proposed by the
government that would impose fees for services and taxes to make up
for budget shortfalls due to declining oil prices.
	   ``If there were no red lines (the Parliament) would be asked not
to cross - such as theft of public money, weapons deals and
misappropriation of government land - the other issues in the
government's complaint could be worked out,'' Abdullah al-Nibari,
an opposition lawmaker wrote in the independent Al-Qabas daily.
	   Tension between the government and legislature surfaced earlier
this month when a lawmaker said he was going to grill the interior
minister, Sheik Mohammed al-Khaled al-Sabah, over what he termed
inefficiency in fighting corruption, drugs and crime.
	   Sheik Mohammed is a member of the ruling family.
	   ``The (interior minister's) grilling was the drop that made the
glass overflow,'' al-Saneh said.
	   The parliament was elected in 1996 in the second polls since the
1991 Gulf War that ended a seven-month Iraqi occupation of the
country.
	   It has been widely criticized for wasting time in idle
discussions and for taking little action.
	   Although Kuwait has the only parliament in the region, the
country does not allow political parties and the emir has the right
to dissolve the legislature.
	   Emirs have twice dissolved parliaments that were severely
critical of government policies. Each time the dissolution lasted
years _ from 1976 to 1981 and from 1986 to 1992.

<TEXT>
	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ Tensions that have their roots in
the Austro-Hungarian Empire have erupted in a wave of school
protests by Hungarians living in Slovakia.
	   Accusing the government of blatant disregard of the nation's
largest minority, ethnic Hungarian parents have pulled their
children from school in one-day protests in several regions _ the
latest on Friday.
	   The boycott was prompted by an education bill in parliament
that, if approved as expected, would require Hungarian children to
drop Hungarian-language history classes and learn history and
geography in Slovak language instead. But the overriding issue,
according to the parents, is the government's consistently unfair
treatment of Hungarians.
	   ``We want our children to learn the Slovak language properly,
but we want them to remain Hungarian,'' said Ladislav Gyurovszki, a
leader of the Association of Hungarian Parents in Slovakia.
	   ``The state wants them to lose their national identity,'' he
said.
	   Friday's protests by Hungarians in the Galanta, Moldava and Sala
districts followed a similar one last week in Komarno.
	   Other districts were expected to join the protest next week,
said Rudolf Meszes, the chairman of the parents' association.

De La Hoya on a mission to revive boxing
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TIM DAHLBERG &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   EL PASO, Texas (AP) _ Oscar De La Hoya won four championships
and became a multimillionaire before he was 25. Now he has a more
lofty goal _ resurrecting the sport of boxing.
	   If the fans of El Paso are any indication, he's well on his way.
	   Some 50,000 people are expected Saturday night to watch De La
Hoya defend the WBC welterweight championship against France's
Patrick Charpentier _ the biggest crowd to watch a fight in the
United States since Muhammad Ali fought Leon Spinks before 71,000
20 years ago at New Orleans.
	   It's an impressive display of drawing power for what figures to
be little more than a good workout for De La Hoya before he moves
on to bigger fights against Julio Cesar Chavez and Felix Trinidad.
	   ``It goes to show you that boxing is revived because of my
presence,'' De La Hoya said. ``I've done a lot for boxing and have
a good image. But I'm a bit surprised that 50,000 people will be
there.''
	   With Mike Tyson sidelined, De La Hoya is the premier attraction
in boxing, a welterweight who makes heavyweight dollars.
	   He'll make dlrs 4 million of them against Charpentier, adding to
a bank account that swelled by about dlrs 33 million last year when
he fought five title fights in two weight divisions.
	   ``He's the biggest star in boxing by far, and that's almost
unheard of outside of heavyweights,'' promoter Bob Arum said.
	   De La Hoya will fight for the first time in six months when he
meets Charpentier, the No. 1 challenger, in a scheduled 12-round
fight in the Sun Bowl. The bout will begin about 0300 GMT Sunday.
	   Charpentier, who has fought only once outside of France, wasn't
De La Hoya's first pick for the fight. But he is the top-ranked
challenger, and the WBC mandated the bout if De La Hoya wanted to
retain the title.
	   ``You've got to fight these guys,'' De La Hoya said. ``Even when
I fight these guys, there's always people that want to see somebody
on top lose.''
	   The fans who have screamed De La Hoya's name since he arrived in
this border city on Tuesday aren't among those. And few in boxing
give the little-known Charpentier much of a chance to pull an
upset.
	   A 20-1 underdog, Charpentier is a straight-ahead fighter, a
style that De La Hoya loves.
	   ``Charpentier will come out for me and go for the knockout,'' De
La Hoya said. ``He's a short, stocky fighter. He can be dangerous
if I stay in front of him, so I have to pick and move.''
	   Charpentier (27-4-1, 23 knockouts) hasn't lost in four years but
never has fought for a title and never fought anyone the caliber of
De La Hoya. He originally was scheduled to fight De La Hoya Feb.
28, but the fight was postponed twice after the champion hurt his
left wrist in training.
	   ``I'm not here to joke,'' Charpentier said. ``I'm here to fight
and I'm taking the title back to France.''
	   If De La Hoya (27-0, 22 knockouts) wins as expected, he plans to
go back to the frantic fight pace that saw him beat Miguel Angel
Gonzalez, Pernell Whitaker and Hector Camacho in the past year.
	   A Sept. 18 rematch against Chavez already is set for Las Vegas,
while a December fight could feature a unification fight with
Trinidad, the IBF welterweight champion.
	   ``I'd love to fight more,'' De La Hoya said. ``Staying active
and training is what keeps me going. I love training for events.''
	   De La Hoya, who won his first title at 130 pounds (59 kilos)
only four years ago, won three more while moving up in weight to
his current 147 pounds (66.5 kilos). The weight is comfortable for
De La Hoya, who plans to stay there for a year or two before
resuming his quest for seven titles and eventual retirement by age
30.
	   ``Two or three years ago I said I would be the best fighter and
call myself the best pound for pound fighter,'' he said. ``I
haven't been there yet, but I'm getting closer. I feel the change
is about to happen.
	   Also on the card is a lightweight title fight between WBC
135-pound (61-kilo) champion Stevie Johnston of Denver and No.
1-ranked challenger Cesar Bazan of Mexico City.

Dalai Lama joins celebrations at Swiss Tibetan monastery
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIKON, Switzerland (AP) _ The exiled Tibetan spiritual leader
joined in a Swiss monastery's anniversary celebrations Friday,
consecrating 10 new prayer wheels.
	   The Tibet Institute in Rikon, near Zurich, which is celebrating
its 30th anniversary this year, becomes the first monastery in the
West to be blessed by the current Dalai Lama.
	   Since fleeing Tibet to lead his nation from exile, the Dalai
Lama has been the sole voice and face of his people. His policy of
compromise and negotiation won world support and the 1989 Nobel
Peace prize.
	   Beijing, which says Tibet has always been part of China, sent
its army to the area in 1950. The Dalai Lama fled to India nine
years later during an abortive uprising against the Chinese, and
was followed by about 100,000 refugees.
	   In Tibetan Buddhism, turning the prayer wheel, a metal cylinder
containing a sacred verse, or mantra, is equivalent to reciting a
mantra.
	   The Rikon monastery has an abbot and seven monks, all of them
Tibetan. Consecrated in November 1968, it was named the Tibet
Institute to get around a Swiss law forbidding the founding of
monasteries.
	   Some 2,500 Tibetans live in Switzerland.

RFK Jr. unveils family photos at UNESCO
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos PAR108,109

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. remembers the photographer
being there when he had breakfast in the morning and said his
prayers at night.
	   Now the pictures Jacques Lowe shot are on public display, a
record of America's premier political family and an apparent sign
that the Kennedys knew early on of their dynasty's place in
history.
	   Part of a week-long UNESCO tribute entitled ``The Kennedy
Dream,'' the 150 black-and-white photographs taken between 1956 and
1968 reveal the many sides of the Kennedy clan.
	   There's Jackie in a bathing suit and fringed cap trying to
capsize Jack rowing a small boat; JFK and Jackie on the campaign
trail, having an early-morning breakfast in an Oregon diner; Bobby
and Ethel praying with the kids at bedtime.
	   ``The show means a lot to me because Jacques captured the
happiest times, the best moments of our life,'' Kennedy told The
Associated Press at the exhibit Friday.
	   ``He was always there. He was there when we said our prayers and
our parents put us to bed, and he was there when we woke up in the
morning,'' Kennedy said.
	   Lowe said the Kennedy family shots were rarely posed, even those
with the kids.
	   ``It happened very naturally,'' according to Lowe. ``No one ever
said `Let's do this.'''
	   Trust was a central factor in the German-born photographer's
access to the family.
	   Lowe said he first shot family pictures of then-Sen. John F.
Kennedy, Jackie and their toddler Caroline on a day that Kennedy
was in a bad mood after nonstop campaigning.
	   When the pictures came out well anyway, Kennedy began to trust
him and ultimately made him the official White House photographer.
	   After JFK's assassination in November 1963, Lowe continued to
profile the family of his brother, Robert.
	   But after the then-presidential candidate was in turn
assassinated 30 years ago this month, Lowe says he was so
traumatized that he put away his cameras and moved to an isolated
house in the French Alps where he lived for 18 years.

World Cup: Bomb threat forces evacuation of stadium press box
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with journalists evacuated from press center after
game. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MONTPELLIER, France (AP) _ Bomb threats emptied the press box at
Montpellier stadium before Friday's match between Bulgaria and
Paraguay. A media center next to the stadium also was briefly
evacuated about an hour after the game.
	   Eric Champel, a member of the organizing committee, said two
threatening phone calls were received about 2 1/2 hours before the
match was scheduled to start.
	   ``We briefly evacuated the press stands and brought in the
sniffing dogs, but that's our usual procedure before every game at
the World Cup,'' he said, adding that there was no concern for the
security at the match.
	   Most of the evacuated reporters found out about the threats only
after the all-clear had been given.
	   About one hour after the game, all journalists were instructed
to leave the nearby media center. Security officers, speaking on
condition of anomimity, said there was another bomb threat.
	   Journalists were allowed back into the building some 15 minutes
later.

WTO chief: Countries must cooperate on free trade and environment
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: SUBS 2nd graf to DELETE extraneous reference to Ruggiero &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Efforts to promote free trade will continue,
despite environmental and labor problems, the World Trade
Organization chief said.
	   WTO chief Renato Ruggiero insisted, however, that countries must
cooperate more to reconcile free trade with those concerns. He made
the comments in a speech to the Hamburg-based Friedrich Ebert
Foundation, a research group.
	   ``We must stop viewing the world through a narrow lens and begin
to look at the various challenges we face as pieces of a larger
puzzle demanding broader, more integrated solutions,'' Ruggiero
said in his speech Thursday. A copy of the speech was released in
Geneva on Friday.
	   Despite protests that the free trade system contributes to
poverty, unemployment and environmental problems, ministers last
month told the WTO to prepare for talks to further open the world
economy.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton and others, however, pledged to try
to make the organization and the global trade system more sensitive
to environmental and labor concerns.
	   Ruggiero said the best way to address the worries is through the
system itself. ``If people, especially young people, say
unemployment is too high, they are right. If environmentalists say
growth must be sustainable _ and not destroy the planet's essential
equilibrium _ they are right.
	   ``But none of these international _ and national _ problems will
be resolved any easier by restricting trade, closing borders, or
undermining the international rule of law _ as embodied in the
WTO.''

Sudan rebels claim capture of strategic town; warns oil companies
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHEGE MBITIRU &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Southern Sudan rebels said Friday they
have captured a strategic town in the Blue Nile province and warned
foreign oil companies it will not honor their exploration
concessions there.
	   If true, the capture of Mabaan near the Ethiopian border by the
Sudan People's Liberation Army would open the way to Melut and
Renk, putting the rebels on eastern banks of the White Nile river
and threatening the government's barge traffic.
	   ``Our forces captured Mabaan on Thursday,'' said Michael George
Garang, an SPLA spokesman in Kenya. ``We are telling the foreign
oil companies to get out, because we will not honor their
agreements with Khartoum.''
	   It was impossible to independently verify the rebel claims and
government officials in Khartoum, the capital of Sudan, were
unavailable for comment.
	   Mabaan is about 600 kilometers (370 miles) south of Khartoum.
The road from Ethiopia branches there to Melut and Renk.
	   Garang could not identify the oil companies in the area. The
U.S. oil company Chevron worked in southern Sudan until the early
1990s when it abandoned its concessions because of the insurgency.
	   Since launching the current offensive a year ago, the rebels
have captured a series of towns and only once have they made a
hasty, and eventually, false claim.
	   Garang, who is not related to SPLA leader Col. John Garang, said
he had no casualty figure for either side in the battle for Mabaan.
	   Since 1983, the rebels have been fighting for increased autonomy
and development for the predominantly animist, Christian and
African south, which traditionally has been dominated by the Muslim
and Arabized north.
	   At least 1.5 million people have died in the fighting and
accompanying famine.
	   Sudan _ Africa's geographically largest country and one of its
poorest _ currently produces between 18,000 and 20,000 barrels of
oil a day and imports up to 40,000 barrels a day to meet domestic
needs. Sudan currently imports dlrs 400 million worth of oil a
year.
	   On Wednesday, the rebels announced the capture the day before of
Ulu, about 455 kilometers (280 miles) southeast of Khartoum.
	   The town is 150 kilometers (90 miles) south of the city of
Damazin and the Roseires dam, which provides 80 percent of
Khartoum's electricity.
	   The dam is about 500 kilometers (315 miles) southeast of
Khartoum.

Pakistan increases defense spending in dlrs 13.7 billion budget
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KATHY GANNON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistan introduced a dlrs 13.7
billion budget Friday that increases defense spending and sharply
raises its debt payments.
	   The dlrs 249 million raise in defense spending to dlrs 3.2
billion, is a 9 percent increase over last year. However after
inflation _ officially 8.5 percent, but unofficially closer to 13
percent _ the actual spending increase was either tiny or
nonexistent.
	   The budget comes just two weeks after Pakistan tested six
nuclear devices generating global condemnation and threats of
economic sanctions.
	   The United States and Japan have both come out in favor of
sanctions, but several European nations, including Russia, have
rejected them as counterproductive.
	   ``We are prepared to make any sacrifice for the security and
solidarity of our homeland,'' Finance Minister Sartaj Aziz Aziz
said in his budget speech.
	   Defense and debt servicing are Pakistan's two biggest
expenditures.
	   Debt servicing will cost Pakistan dlrs 9 billion or two-thirds
of its budget. This is almost twice the interest Pakistan paid last
year.
	   This year Pakistan's deficit was 5.4 percent of gross domestic
product, the lowest since this poor country of 140 million people
became indebted to international lending institutions some 17 years
ago, Aziz said.
	   Aziz said the deficit target for next year is 4.6 percent,
slightly higher than the 4 percent target set by the International
Monetary Fund, which has negotiated a dlrs 1.6 billion loan
package.
	   It's still not known whether international sanctions will effect
the IMF loan or multilateral aid.
	   Pakistan spends less than 5 percent of its gross national
product on education and health care. And on social security
benefits for its elderly, Pakistan spends only .2 percent, this
compares to 11 percent in the United States and 38 percent in
Sweden.
	   In a country of 140 million people, 60 million people do not
have access to health facilities and and 67 million people are
without safe drinking water. And 89 million people do not have
basic sanitation facilities.

	   SOME foreign words are learnt the hard way because of their
relevance in more ways than one to contemporary situations. One
such is the Latin expression annus horribilis, meaning awful year,
once used by Queen Elizabeth to describe the misfortunes of the
British royal family members in 1992.
	   It is now also used by others, including political analysts, to
describe the economic turmoil in some Asian countries.
	   For Indonesia though there is the consequent political upheaval
leading to the resignation of President Suharto after 32 years in
power, and thus another Latin expression multis terribilis, caveto
multos. It means: If many fear you, beware of many. The advice is
one which leaders past and present would take to heart.
	   Once published in the Jakarta Post (on May 8, 1995) was a
commentary on ``Jaman Edan'', a Javanese expression meaning the age
of madness. It was coined by Ranggawarsite (1802-1873), the great
court poet of Surakarta, who also wrote essays on social issues,
education, economics and law.
	   Noted was his experience in what was described as one of the
darkest periods of Javanese history, from 1820 to 1860. During the
four decades entire villages were pauperised due to ``exploitative
practices conducted by the Dutch colonial Government and aided by
the bureaucracies of the Javanese kings''.
	   And so it was that the Javanese under Prince Dipanegara
revolted. Quote: ``It is not difficult to imagine that the Javanese
became demoralised during this time of political disintegration,
and that various forms of deceit and hypocrisy emerged within the
courts. In those courts political intrigue thrived, and violations
of norms became common.
	   ``People skilful in winning the trust of those in power have
always won, no matter how wicked such a person may have been ... to
later generations of Javanese people, Jaman Edan has come to mean
any time or period during which villains who violated ethical norms
not only get away unpunished, but are actually rewarded''.
	   Remembered too is a poem by Ranggawarsita from his book Serat
Kala Tida (The Age of Social Upheavals): The lustre of the realm is
now vanished to the eye, In ruins the teachings of good ways for
there is no example left.
	   Other than rebellion another form of protest was a custom
inherited from the old days of the Majapahit empire. An unjust king
was warned of being ``left and evaded'' by his people. It meant
that they would migrate into the hinterland and the king could not
then count on them to man his army or provide labour for
agriculture and other activities.
	   In the present circumstances, however, no such form of protest
can be effected.
	   Among pressing problems facing the administration of President
B.J.
	   Habibie is the rise in the number of the unemployed due to the
steep depreciation of the rupiah and economic turbulence. According
to latest reports the number of jobless will rise to 15 million.
	   Mentioned in the Indonesian journal Forum Keadilan is the
increase in the number of those living below the poverty level. In
1970 some 70 million people or 60 per cent of the population were
considered poor.
	   Since then the percentage had consistently gone down and in 1996
the number of those below the poverty level was 22.5 million or
just 11.2 per cent of the total population.
	   The economic turmoil has demolished the gains, according to an
Indonesian economist. The number of those considered dirt poor has
now risen to 118.5 million or 60.6 per cent of the populace. It is
no longer an estimate but a fact of life, he said, and thus worse
than the situation in 1970.
	   There was then the warning: ``Without waiting for the students
and intellectuals to make their moves they themselves will march
forth to seek that little pot of rice in order to just survive ...
We would be committing a grave sin if we simply wait for anarchy to
smother us.'' Meanwhile warnings about the danger of Indonesia
becoming ``another Yugoslavia'' have been voiced by Amien Rais, the
militant opposition leader during Suharto's rule, and by
Christianto Wibisono, director of the Indonesian Business Date
Centre and also a political analyst in Jakarta.
	   Both are nonetheless not of the same hue as Tengku Hassan Tiro,
leader of the secessionist National Liberation Front of Aceh. He
had once described Indonesian nationalism as a ``Western invention
to contain Islam''
	   in the former Dutch East Indies.
	   The idea was said to been formulated by a Dutch administrator,
Christian Snouck Hurgronje, who once visited Mecca disguised as a
Muslim. The objective was to destroy Islam as a politico-religious
faith slowly and subtly so that Indonesia could be secularised and
westernised.
	   As things are, however, Indonesian unity remains firm.
``Helping'' to bolster it are calls by such as Jose Ramos-Horta to
change the status of East Timor, former Portuguese colony and
presently the 27th province of the Indonesian republic.
	   Both Habibie and former opposition leader Megawati Sukarnoputri,
and others have rejected such notions. In the present context there
are no separatist leaders such as Imam Kartosuwiro of West Java and
Abdul Kahar Muzakar of Sulawesi to fan separatist tendencies.
	   The patriotic slogan ``From Sabang to Meruke'' is firmly in the
hearts and minds of the people whatever their ethnic origins -
Minangkabau, Batak, Ambonese, Sundanese, Makasarese or Javanese.
They are many facing Habibie, a non-Javanese, and for him thus is
the reminder from the second part of the Latin expression ``beware
of many''.
	   As things are some students are still demonstrating, trade
unionists picketing their work places and political parties
proliferating.

Lukashenko objects to price increases
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ President Alexander Lukashenko said Friday
that higher prices are not the way to curb demand in Minsk for meat
and dairy products.
	   Instead, he ordered city authorities to increase production of
sausages and cottage cheese.
	   ``The important thing is to saturate the market and do away with
this high demand,'' Lukashenko said.
	   During a visit to a dairy plant, he reminded authorities that he
has ordered price increases not to exceed two or three percent.
	   He said that by the end of June he wants to see eight to 10
different kinds of sausages being sold in Minsk and five or six
kinds of cottage cheese.
	   Belarus has made fewer free-market reforms than probably any
other former Soviet republic, with most businesses remaining in
state hands and the government setting prices.
	   The national currency, the Belarusian ruble, has suffered
another dramatic slump recently, leading to a surge in prices for
what meager goods are available in the stores.
	   Lukashenko said the food shortages are confined to the capital,
Minsk.
	   ``There is no panic-buying of these foodstuffs in regional
centers,'' he said. ``Even with the existing prices, not everybody
can afford them.''

	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Firing canisters of tear gas into the air,
riot police dispersed groups of protesters in Nigeria's commercial
capital Friday before the activists could converge for a mass
demonstration.
	   Aides to Gani Fawehinmi, a lawyer and leading dissident who
organized the protests, told The Associated Press he was arrested.
If confirmed, it would be a serious blow to an opposition already
weakened by the imprisonment or exile of most of its main leaders.

capital awoke Friday to the surprising sight of tons of green
bananas dumped in front of the entrances of some official
buildings.
	   The bananas were left by angry producers during the night as a
protest. Berard Capgras told the Caraibes International radio
station that the bananas were part of the 4,000 tons that producers
have lost since some employees went on strike at the Fort-de-France
harbor recently.
	   Capgras said the banana producers are desperate.
	   ``We want a minimum service at the harbor,'' said Capgras. ``We
are going to lead actions until the authorities find a solution.''
	   Dock workers went on strike recently in support of workers at a
banana farm in the southern town of Francois on this Caribbean
island, which is part of France. More than 4,000 tons of bananas
destined for France and other parts of Europe were left on the
docks.
	   Some residents took advantage of the banana producers' protest
by hauling away as many bananas as they could carry before cleaning
companies moved in to remove the fruit.

Finnair profit up by 47 percent

<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ Citing growth in all sectors, Finland's
national carrier, Finnair, increased its 12-month pretax profit by
47 percent, to 630 million markkaa (dlrs 116 million), the company
said Friday.
	   Net sales during the 12 months ending March 31 also grew, to 8
billion markkaa (dlrs 1.5 billion) from 7.4 billion markkaa a year
earlier.
	   The number of passengers flying Finnair grew by 12.5 percent
during the period, and cargo traffic increased by 15 percent, the
airline said.
	   Finnair said growth will continue except in the Far East.
	   ``The Finnish economy is expected to grow favorably ... and the
demand for airline services is directly linked to economic
growth,'' the company said. ``The new financial year has begun well
and conditions favor a good result for this year.''
	   Finnair said it will lose about 80 million markkaa (dlrs 15
million) once European Union regulations banning duty free sales in
the region come into force, as scheduled in July 1999.
	   Finnair, founded in 1923, is one of the world's oldest airlines.
It flies to 70 destinations, including 40 in Europe, with a fleet
of 56 aircraft. It employs 11,000 people worldwide.

	   PAS and Pauline Hanson uttered in the same breath may seem
strange, incongruous even. But for Australian sociologist Professor
Clive Kessler, the parallel is startlingly apparent.
	   He says support for Hanson, whose One Nation party is likely to
win up to four seats in tomorrow's elections in Queensland, comes
from people who have been geographically and culturally isolated
and who see themselves embodying the true personality of the
nation.
	   Because of their insularity, he says the many changes Australia
has experienced have bypassed them. ``These changes have not been
part of their experience.''
	   Similarly, Malaysia in the 1960s was quite plural and diverse
but there was a rural-populist movement based in Kelantan which saw
the State through a Malay image.
	   Kessler who spent months studying the movement said the people
living in Kelantan then felt they were the only real Malays.
	   They had a we-local-people-know-best attitude. Through the
party, the Kelantanese sought ways to affirm their identity.
	   In both cases, Kessler says, there were narrow, conformist,
exclusive notions of the individual in the nation-state. Anything
different would have been a mistake, an aberration which had to be
treated with suspicion.
	   Today, in Australia, this provincial worldview - variously
labelled as the Old Australia, the Middle Australia or the
Anglo-Celtic outlook - is creeping into the mainstream, threatening
to shake the foundation of national politics.
	   It is also alarming people far beyond the borders of the
northern ``Sunshine State''.
	   As Kessler points out, everyone will be looking out for the
contagion effects of tomorrow's elections.
	   For Malaysians with relatives and friends from down under, the
Hanson factor is undoubtedly worrying.
	   ``It's harder for Asians to get in now,'' says an
Australian-Chinese lecturer living in Sydney. ``There is definitely
a bias towards White Australians. This won't make life harder for
us on a day-to-day basis but in the long-run, who knows?''
	   One person presumably perspiring under the collar as One Nation
gains ground in Queensland is Prime Minister John Howard.
	   Even if his National-Liberal coalition gets the vote in the
elections, critics say One Nation will end up holding the balance
of power in the State Parliament.
	   Australian newspaper reports have also indicated that a good
performance by One Nation in Queensland will translate into the
national election (which Howard is likely to call for before March,
next year), leaving his government to contend with
ultra-conservative policies such as a cut in Asian immigration,
softer gun laws and tariffs.
	   The probability of this happening, up to Press time, is pretty
high.
	   Polls over the past week have shown One Nation enjoying as much
as 18.5 per cent support State-wide and more than 20 per cent
support in disaffected rural areas. Polls have also given the
Labour party as much as a 55-45 per cent lead over the
Liberal-National coalition after the distribution of preference
votes.
	   (This is a complicated voting system which allows for ranking of
candidates in order of preference and where the votes of minor
candidates are distributed to remaining candidates until a majority
is determined.) The Liberals have seen support crumble in key urban
seats in Brisbane while the Nationals, traditionally the farmers'
friend, have seen supporters desert them for One Nation.
	   Hanson, whose influence has been grossly underestimated by
Howard, knows the extent of voter angst in her backyard.
	   Basing her career on a constituency of allegedly ``forgotten
people'', she has attracted rural and semi-urban dwellers tired of
being seen as vapid and colourless, alarmed by the effects of
globalisation and two decades of multiculturalism and uncertain
about their economic future.
	   To entice them into her fold, she claims she is ``an Australian
fighting for Australia''.
	   She says she represents ``ordinary Australians, mainstream
Australians, underprivileged White Australians'' who want
monoculturalism, discriminatory immigration, tariff protection for
Australian industries and the pulling back of all privileges given
to the indigenous folk of Australia.
	   The alleged links that One Nation has with the lunatic fringe -
the Freedom Scouts (which is threatening Asia with two alarming
alternatives: the atom bomb or germ warfare) and the Ku Klux Klan -
is also frightening many people, both within and outside Australia.
	   So, if the proponents of multiculturalism had hoped to place
Australia on the world map as a country comfortable with ethnic
diversity, they are now seeing a biting backlash in the bigotry
that comes with Hanson's party.
	   If we are to learn anything from all this, it would be in the
following points: first, major political parties which are far
removed from people at the grassroots will have a huge price to pay
at election time.
	   A second lesson would be in the way leaders handle simmering
resentment, distrust and anger towards government.
	   Says Kessler: ``He (Howard) could have provided a more
constructive alternative, he could have said: `I understand your
suffering. I know what you are going through. We will find ways to
deal with the problems but her way is not the right way'.''
	   Instead, because of his hidden agenda, Howard from the very
start showed reluctance to criticise her. His rationale: if you
attack her, it would only build her up.
	   When he decided late last week to label her as `deranged', it
seemed a little too late.
	   Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia sociologist Norani Othman, who is
watching the Queensland elections from Sydney, says people in power
often don't realise they can be indirectly responsible for
unleashing negative forces in society.
	   They usually ignore it until the strength of emotions cannot be
contained, she says.
	   ``We have seen this happening in many countries where religious
militancy or cultural fundamentalism have been allowed to fester
without check or control.''
	   Such trends have led to the downfall of governments.
	   A possible third lesson and one which Norani says she finds most
heartening was in the way Australians make use of democratic
structures to openly declare their frustrations with the political
system.
	   She says Malaysia can learn a great deal from this. ``We tend to
sweep things under the carpet and grumble in private. We become
cynical because we assume we are powerless.
	   ``We have democratic structures but they remain untested,
unchallenged because we're not in the habit of operating within
such a framework in our daily lives.
	   ``Over here (in Australia), I have a keen sense of these
structures and how political tensions are kept in check within the
democratic framework.
	   She says many Australians are dismayed by Hanson's influence and
embarrassed that pockets of bigotry still exist in the country.
	   They are also wondering why incipient racism still clings in
dark corners of the country when the White Australia Policy was
abandoned in the 70s.
	   ``Many of us don't realise that social engineering takes time,''
says Norani. ``I am confident that things will improve. The
Australians have a sense of what they can do and this is important
because extreme views and positions will be kept in check when
issues are allowed out into the open.''

Human rights group condemns Israeli travel restrictions on
</HEADLINE>
Palestinians &QL; 
 &UR; By JACK KATZENELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel's failure to open a ``safe passage'' to
allow Palestinians to travel between the West Bank and the Gaza
Strip constitutes collective punishment and is causing unacceptable
hardship, an Israeli human rights group charged Friday.
	   In the Israel-Palestinian agreements, Israel recognized that the
West Bank and the Gaza Strip constitute ``a single territorial
unit'' and promised to open a ``safe passage'' between them.
	   But two years have passed and Israel has not carried out this
commitment, citing security reasons. A limited number of
Palestinians cross between the two areas each week in convoys
guarded by Israeli border police.
	   In a report entitled ``Divide and Rule,'' the Betselem human
rights group says the Israeli policy constitutes collective
punishment.
	   ``The severance between the Gaza Strip and the West Bank
precludes development of communal, social, economic and political
life of the residents of the two areas,'' the report says. It
``creates two Palestinian societies with weak ties between them.''
	   The restrictions have separated families and made it difficult
for students living in the Gaza Strip to study in the West Bank.
	   An Israeli official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Friday the ``safe passage'' could have been opened a long time ago
were Palestinian's willing to allow security checks on the
corridor.
	   ``If they had accepted our proposals, a much larger number of
Palestinians would be making the crossing today and they would find
it much more convenient than the present situation,'' the official
told The Associated Press.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's policy adviser David
Bar-Illan said the delay in the opening of the ``safe passage'' was
``due entirely to security considerations based on the constant and
very real threat of terrorism.''

Graf to meet DFS Classic title-holder in semifinals
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BIRMINGHAM, England (AP) _ Steffi Graf, improving with each
match in her preparation for Wimbledon, advanced to the semifinals
of the DFS Classic with a straight-set victory Friday over Spain's
Maria Luisa Serna.
	   The seven-time Wimbledon champion took 68 minutes to beat Serna
6-4, 6-4 and set up a semifinal clash with defending title holder
Nathalie Tauziat of France.
	   Graf, playing only her third tournament since a knee operation
last June, dropped only one service game to the left-hander from
Barcelona.
	   Earlier, the third-seeded Tauziat downed unseeded Australian
Kerry-Anne Guse 6-2, 6-3.
	   Tauziat had two priorities Friday _ advance to the semifinals
and then get away in time to watch France play South Africa in the
World Cup.
	   ``I love football but I'm happy not to be in Paris during the
World Cup because there are so many people there now,'' she said.
``I will be quite happy watching it on television.''
	   The other DFS Classic semifinal will be between Elena
Likhovtseva, the seventh seed from Russia, and Indonesia's Yayuk
Basuki, the No. 6 seed and 1997 runner-up.
	   Likhovtseva beat Belgium's Monique Van Roost 6-3, 6-4, while
Basuki beat No. 2 seed Irina Spirlea 6-4, 5-7, 7-5.

Parliamentary election results in Montenegro final
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PODGORICA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Final results cementing the victory
of reformist President Milo Djukanovic's supporters in May 31
elections were announced Friday by Montenegro's election
commission.
	   With 170,000 ballots cast in its favor, Djukanovic's pro-Western
coalition ``For a Better Life'' won 42 seats in the 78-seat
parliament.
	   The party of Djukanovic's opponent Momir Bulatovic, protege of
hard-line Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, gained 29 seats
with 123,957 votes.
	   Five seats went to the Liberal Alliance party and one each to
two ethnic Albanian political parties in Montenegro.
	   Results were delayed because the vote had to be repeated at two
polling stations because of ``irregularities.'' Both polling places
had only a few hundred registered voters, and could not have
influenced final results.
	   A number of minor complaints also had to be addressed.
	   The new parliament is scheduled to convene Monday.
	   The commission gave the elections a clean bill of health, saying
they were ``free and democratic'' and expressed the will of the
people in this mountainous republic of just 630,000 residents.
	   Montenegro, together with Serbia, with 10 million inhabitants,
forms the present-day Yugoslav federation. Both republics provide
an equal number of deputies to the upper chamber of the federal
parliament.

	   IN the current confusion over the price of rice, it is perhaps
timely to put things in perspective. The Malaysian rice situation
should be viewed from two windows - that of Peninsular Malaysia and
Sabah and Sarawak, for they are totally separate.
	   The authorities' concern is over the rise of prices in the local
grades in Peninsular Malaysia, a phenomenon seen from the start of
the new year.
	   To them, there is no justification for the steep hike when 80
per cent of the 1.45 million tonnes required for the peninsula is
produced locally.
	   They have said a price difference of about a ringgit or two for
10 kg may be acceptable but certainly not between RM7 and RM8 as is
the case today.
	   At issue is the local Super grade which is floated. The Premium
and Standard grade rice are under price control.
	   The authorities have also made it clear that they are not overly
concerned about the prices of imported rice as, at the end of the
day, it is for the consumers to choose the type they want.
Moreover, it is unrealistic to expect price control of the imported
varieties for these are subject to world price fluctuations. It is
understandable that the authorities are closely monitoring the
price movements and anxious to check a further hike and reduce the
existing levels. Rice is the nation's staple and in these difficult
times, a big price rise will no doubt burden the people,
particularly the lower income group.
	   In the furore over the sharp price hike, it is convenient to
make Padiberas Nasional Bhd, the country's sole rice importer, the
scapegoat.
	   Facts do not lie and they clearly tell us that Bernas should not
be blamed. The Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry has
attested to this after a full explanation from Bernas. Indeed, it
is impossible for Bernas which controls a mere 20 per cent of the
supply to cause the spiralling prices.
	   Those conversant with the rice trade in fact point out that
Bernas did not increase prices for some eight months since the
onset of the region's economic problems up to April. It even had to
bear losses because of the ringgit's depreciation. Yet the local
price has seen a steady rise since January. The Ministry, lamenting
that the Super grade rice is priced too high, said even though
Bernas sells it at RM10 for a 10kg bag, there are groups pricing it
between RM15 and RM20 under different brand names. The Ministry in
blaming millers, wholesalers and retailers has ominously warned
that a refusal to bring down prices will force it to find a
solution. While the Agriculture Ministry has delivered a similar
warning, it rightly points out that price control could have an
adverse impact on the industry.
	   The local rice trade is a complex one given its large number of
players and layers. In a free economy like Malaysia's, it would be
naive to assume that there is no multiplier effect in the wake of
last December's padi price increase despite the assurance by
millers that they will absorb the additional costs. However, the
important question is whether the increase is a fair quantum.
Instead of pointing fingers, the best course is to try and reduce
this multiplier effect. This is however a well nigh impossible task
as effective supervision in terms of manpower is too costly.
	   Perhaps, the solution lies in using Bernas' prices at its retail
outlets as a benchmark for determining a fair margin of profit for
dealers.
	   Ultimately, it will be in the interest of the trade to be
reasonable.

Apartheid scientists stopped at nothing to preserve white rule
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in last two grafs with meeting adjourning until
Thursday &QL; 
 &UR; By PAUL HARRIS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ The head of South Africa's former
apartheid government's chemical and biological weapons program must
testify about his activities, a court ruled Friday. The decision
paves the way for further revelations about evil and bizarre
research projects designed to preserve white rule.
	   In the past week, a host of apartheid-era scientists have told
the Truth and Reconciliation Commission about mind-boggling schemes
nurtured in secret laboratories: They include poisoned chocolates,
germ-warfare agents capable of singling out blacks, plots to slip
Nelson Mandela, now the president, a drug that would cause brain
damage.
	   Toxins were made and passed on to apartheid assassins, referred
to in secret documents only by their code names ``Chris'' and
``Koos.''
	   One scientist, Schalk van Rensburg, testified that a shirt laced
with poison was given to an activist with the African National
Congress, the black group seeking to end apartheid. The target, who
was not identified, unknowingly gave the deadly garment to a
friend, who then died.
	   Retired Archbishop Desmond Tutu said this week's testimony was
the most shocking he has heard as chairman of the Truth Commission,
set up in 1995 to investigate apartheid abuses and heal racial
divisions.
	   ``Here are people of high intelligence, coldly and clinically in
white laboratory coats, working on things they know were meant to
be instruments of destroying people,'' Tutu told The Associated
Press on Thursday.
	   The scientists explained their actions by saying they were
virtually brainwashed by government propaganda in the 1980s that
promoted the idea that South Africa was on the brink of falling to
communism and black rule.
	   ``That was the psychosis that prevailed,'' Daan Goosen, who
headed a covert biological research laboratory, recalled Thursday.
	   ``I was not thinking rationally at the time,'' he said. ``Today,
I know I was wrong. You can't do that to people, it is just not
justifiable.''
	   Van Rensburg told the commission that any researchers who
expressed reservations about their work, or who moved to break
ranks, were in grave danger.
	   ``We had been told in no uncertain terms, if you let the side
down you are dead,'' he said.
	   While the scientists have disclosed assorted grisly plans, there
was no indication of any firm decision to actually employ the
schemes against any large segment of the black population.
	   Lawyers for the man who headed the apartheid science program,
Dr. Wouter Basson, have been trying to prevent him from having to
appear before the Truth Commission. But Friday the commission ruled
against Basson.
	   Dressed in a pinstriped white shirt, Basson sat grim-faced while
the panel rejected his lawyer's appeal to postpone his appearance
because it could prejudice a possible criminal case against him.
Basson allegedly produced and sold ecstasy and other drugs while he
was overseeing apartheid science projects.
	   Mandela's ANC won the country's first all-race elections in
1994, ending apartheid. Responding to the scientists' testimony,
the party said the plots disclosed this week drew one obvious
comparison for the old, apartheid government: The experiments of
Adolf Hitler's Third Reich.
	   The hearings were adjourned until next Thursday, when former
Surgeon General Niel Knobel is expected to finish testimony he
began Friday. Knobel said he thought Basson's program was
developing conventional biological and chemical weapons, and he
claimed to know nothing about the poison projects.
	   Basson is likely to be called next week.

	   BLUE-CHIP share prices bounced up and down Wednesday before
closing down 0.86 per cent on profit-taking in the high-tech
sector.
	   The Dow Jones index of 30 blue chips shed 78.22 points to close
at 8,971.70. Some 612 million shares changed hands with 976

	   On the bond market, average yields fell to their lowest levels
in 30 years after Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan said that
higher interest rates may be needed if demand does not slow.
	   Greenspan said that while the Asian crisis drove down the value
of US exports in first quarter 1998, the slowdown was not ``likely
to threaten the expansion of this country's economy''.

Annan recommends extension of U.N. Mission in Bosnia until June
</HEADLINE>
1999

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Citing the continuing challenge of
rebuilding Bosnia-Herzegovina, Secretary-General Kofi Annan
recommended Friday that the U.N. mission remain in the Balkan
country until at least June 21, 1999.
	   Annan, in a report to the Security Council, said his
recommendation was based on the assumption that NATO-led troops
would remain there during that period to provide security for the
U.N. operation.
	   The U.N. Mission in Bosnia-Herzegovina includes about 2,000
civilian police sent there to train and advise the newly
reconstituted police forces in parts of the country ruled by Bosnia
Serbs and the Muslim-Croat Federation.
	   About 200 of the U.N. police are Americans.
	   In the report, Annan outlined some of the problems facing the
United Nations in rebuilding Bosnia-Herzegovina following the 1995
Dayton Peace Accord, which ended the 3 1/2 year ethnic war.
	   ``Very regrettably, the last three months have seen an increase
in violent incidents aimed at returning refugees and displaced
persons, in particular those belonging to minority groups,'' he
said.
	   He said U.N. police were doing everything possible to facilitate
the return of all refugees but added ``it would be overly
optimistic to expect a decisive change before the nationwide
elections'' set for Sept. 13.
	   U.N. officials say they fear the three groups _ Muslims, Croats
and Serbs _ will try to prevent wholesale return of minorities
before the election to keep minority participation in the balloting
as low as possible.

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Police arrested Friday the son of a family
that was wiped out in a 12-person murder which has shocked Jordan.
	   One or more gunmen shot school bus driver Amin Qashash, 50, his
wife, four children, a son-in-law and four grandchildren before
dawn Thursday in their home in Banayat, a village 20 kilometers (12
miles) northwest of Amman, government officials said.
	   Police announced they had arrested Qashash's son, Saeed, 18, but
did not say if he had any accomplices.
	   Saeed had confessed to killing his family out of fear that he
might fail his high school exams, police said.
	   The family was shot in their house's basement and a brick wall
was then built to hide its entrance, an official said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
	   Jordan, which is proud of its reputation for security in a
volatile region, has been shaken recently by a series of shootings
and bombings.

	   SHARE prices closed 2.1 per cent lower yesterday on selling due
to the yen's plunge against the dollar and worries about falling
Asian stock markets, brokers said.
	   Bargain hunters after the previous day's fall retreated as the
yen came closer to the 142-yen barrier, brokers said.
	   The key Nikkei stock average of 225 selected issues on the Tokyo
Stock Exchange fell 325.22 points at 15,014.04, narrowly managing
to stay above the psychologically-important 15,000.
	   The broader Topix index of all first-section issues dropped
19.79 points to 1,178.81. An estimated 400 million shares changed
hands on the major board, up from 353.2 million shares the previous
day.
	   Shortly after 3pm, the currency was trading at a new seven-year
low of 142.10 yen.
	   The Nikkei 225 index fell to as low as 15,002.55, but public
fund buying, along with modest position covering, blocked further
declines, brokers said.
	   Share prices were under pressure from the outset in the wake of
the declines of Asian markets on the previous day, with sentiment
unnerved by the further falls seen again yesterday.
	   Investors remained active sellers of banks in particular, in the
wake of the fall of the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong, brokers said.
	   Selling spread due to worries over the sizeable exposure of
local banks to Hong Kong borrowers, they said.
	   But selling eased somewhat amid cautiousness ahead of the
setting of the special quotation to settle June futures contracts.
	   ``Sellers retreated ahead of the SQ Friday, because even they
did not want to continue to push share prices sharply lower,'' a
Meiko Securities Co Ltd broker said.
	   ``Futures-led selling pushed the market to the lows, but there
was talk of public funds buying which helped to pull prices off
their lows. Also, the fact that Hong Kong stabilised after falling
to its lows helped revive sentiment.
	   ``From here, the point of concern is that if we see further
falls of the major markets overnight - London and in the United
States - this will feed through to further falls of the local
market again tomorrow (today),'' the Meiko broker said.

	   VERSAILLES, France (AP) _ Up to a dozen heavily armed masked men
attacked the home of world-renowned perfumer Jean-Paul Guerlain
early Friday, shooting him and a guardian after plundering the
mansion of art works and other valuables, police and judicial
sources said.
	   Two other people, one of whom was hit in the face by the
attackers, suffered minor injuries, said the sources, speaking on
condition of customary anonymity. The other jumped out a second
story window, suffering arm injuries.
	   Guerlain, 63, was operated on Friday morning for a wound to the
thigh inflicted by a 9 mm bullet, and was ``doing well,'' according
to the prestigious perfume and cosmetics house that bears his name.
	   The guardian was reported in critical condition in a Paris
hospital with two bullet wounds to the chest.
	   Police mounted a search for the gang, none of whom had been
caught more than 12 hours after the attack which lasted from about
midnight until 3 p.m.
	   Police sources said the attackers, highly organized and
apparently lying in wait, took the Guerlain household hostage upon
his return around midnight from a gala celebration of the
perfumery's 170 years in business.
	   It was not known how they penetrated the walled estate in the
Yvelines region west of Paris where Versailles is located.
	   Guerlain was held until about 3 a.m. while the various buildings
of the estate were pillaged of jewels, art works and other
valuables, said the police sources.
	   ``The commando carried out a break-in that we could qualify as
savage,'' said one inspector from the Criminal Brigade.
	   Gunfire broke out as the gang was leaving, said the police and
judicial sources, indicating that Guerlain may have tried to grab a
pistol at the time.
	   Guerlain President Thibault Ponroy said the perfumer, one of
France's top ``noses,'' had spoken with him on the telephone after
surgery Friday morning.
	   Guerlain ``is out of danger,'' Ponroy said. ``He was
complaining. When Jean-Paul complains, he's doing well,'' he told
LCI television station.
	   On Thursday night, Guerlain presented his new perfume,
``Guerlinade,'' at a gala at his boutique on Paris' famed
Champs-Elysees.
	   Guerlain is the great grandson of the founder of the prestigious
perfume and cosmetics house created in 1828, creator of the
well-known fragrance ``Shalimar.''
	   Guerlain has been run by the world's No. 1 luxury group LMVH --
Louis Vuitton Moet-Henessy -- since 1994.

Thousands flee Guinea-Bissau as government, rebels exchange fire
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with fighting in Bissau, Portuguese Navy warship en
route, situation reported calm in second-largest city,
international phone lines apparently cut &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Tens of thousands of people fled the
former Portuguese colony of Guinea-Bissau on Friday as government
troops fought renegade soldiers who launched a coup attempt,
according to reports.
	   As many as 40,000 people in the West African nation were heading
on foot along the road to the northern border with Senegal, a
Portuguese journalist in the area said, citing local reports.
	   Senegal closed the border on Thursday while medical teams were
dispatched to vaccinate the refugees against yellow fever and
meningitis before they were allowed into the country, Pedro Rosa
Mendes told Portuguese state radio Antena 1.
	   Government troops, supported by soldiers from neighboring
Senegal and the Republic of Guinea, meanwhile maintained their
siege of a military garrison in a northern suburb of the capital
Bissau, where an unknown number of rebels have been holed up since
their attempted powergrab on Sunday.
	   A spokesman for the Portuguese Prime Minister's office, who was
in contact with the Portuguese embassy in Bissau, said sporadic
shelling and automatic weapon fire could be heard in the capital
throughout the day.
	   ``It's a very unstable situation. We're not sure who's
winning,'' the spokesman said on customary condition of anonymity,
adding that the embassy had been hit by several stray shells.
	   The French embassy was hit by a bazooka shell but no one was
injured, the Portuguese news agency Lusa reported, citing
diplomatic sources in Dakar in Senegal.
	   Portuguese residents in Bafata, the country's second-largest
city, 140 kilometers (87 miles) to the east of Bissau, told Lusa
there was no military activity in the area.
	   The president of the National Assembly Malan Sanha said
representatives from Muslim and Catholic associations had allied
with lawmakers to propose talks, Lusa reported.
	   The two sides had ``demonstrated interest'' in holding talks,
Sanha was quoted as saying by Lusa, although he declined to provide
further details.
	   However, an unidentified western diplomat quoted by Lusa said
President Joao Bernardo Vieira was reluctant to enter talks and was
confident in his ability to defeat the rebels militarily.
	   More than 2,200 people, mostly foreigners, were evacuated from
Bissau on a Portuguese merchant ship Thursday.
	   Vitor Duque, an official of the shipping company that provided
the vessel told, Antena 1 that the passengers, including children
and old people, were packed on the deck. The huge container ship
was designed to hold only 18 people.
	   The ship was due to arrive in Dakar at about 5 p.m. (1700 GMT),
Duque said.
	   A Portuguese frigate was expected to arrive in Guinea-Bissau on
Sunday to oversee the evacuation of other foreigners, diplomats
said.
	   Portuguese phone company Marconi said international phone lines
apparently had been cut in Bissau, making contact impossible.
	   The rebels are led by former armed forces chief Brig. Ansumane
Mane, who was fired in January amid allegations he was involved in
smuggling arms to rebels in Senegal. He has accused Vieira of
corruption and called on him to step down so that early elections
can be held.
	   Vieira himself came to power in a 1980 coup. He was elected in
the country's first democratic elections for president and
parliament four years ago.

World Cup: Zdravkov preserves 0-0 draw
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: CORRECTS spelling of Chilavert in 13th graf. &QL; 
 &UR; By DUSAN STOJANOVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MONTPELLIER, France (AP) _ Bulgarian goalkeeper Zdravko Zdravkov
leapt high to his right to deny Paraguayan counterpart Jose Luis
Chilavert from converting a second-half 25-meter free kick, leaving
the two sides with a goalless draw in their World Cup opener
Friday.
	   The Bulgarians played the final two minutes with only 10 men
after Anatoli Nankov earned his second yellow. Paraguay had two
good chances following the sending off, but failed to convert.
	   Chilavert, famous for coming forward on set pieces and as an
extra attacker, curled a left-footed blast over the wall in the
78th minute, only to have Zdravkov punch away the shot as it
approached the crossbar.
	   ``I already saw the ball in the net,'' Chilavert said after the
match. ``Too bad I did not score, I could have made history.''
	   No goalkeeper has ever scored in regular time at World Cup
games.
	   Saudi referee Abdul Rahman Al-Zeid awarded the free kick when
Trifon Ivanov hauled down Paraguayan forward Jorge Campos.
	   Paraguay dominated the second half, getting several chances
before Chilavert's free kick.
	   ``We lacked poise to finish the plays,'' Paraguay coach Paulo
Cesar Carpeggiani said. ``We always missed the last pass.''
	   Hristo Stoichkov set up the best Bulgarian opportunity in the
second half when he charged into the box from the left, crossed the
ball to an unmarked Luboslav Penev, who blasted high from six yards
with only Chilavert to beat.
	   ``We had some tactical errors on both sides of the defense,''
Carpeggiani said. ``But we made som adjustments and improved in the
second half. Unfortunately, it wasn't enough to win. We lacked the
finishing touch.''
	   The match was a game of missed opportunities.
	   Stoichkov hit the post in the 35th minute, beating two defenders
and knocking the ball off the upright with a left-footed shot which
had Chilavert totally beaten.
	   The Bulgarians, considered favorites in the Group D match,
opened up with several swift atacks and a shot by Kressimir Balakov
that just missed in the second minute.
	   Two minutes later, a Stoichkov was upended in the Paraguayan box
but his pleas to Al-Zeid went unheeded.
	   ``It was a 100 percent penalty,'' said Bulgarian coach Hristo
Bonev. ``We played well in the first half, but our game collapsed
in the second.''
	   The Paraguayans rarely threatened the Bulgarian goal, taking 19
minutes before Carlos Morales' got their first shot, a free kick
that had to be stopped by Zdravko with a diving save.
	   Their best chance of the half came in the 40th minute when
forward Jose Cardoso was left all alone in the Bulgarian penalty
area, but his shot from 15 meters skidded wide of the right post.
	   Stoichkov was yellow-carded in injury time for a reckless
tackle.

Third explosion in two weeks in Kyrgyz city of Osh
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ An explosion in an apartment building injured six
people Friday in the city of Osh in western Kyrgyzstan, a news
agency reported. It was the third explosion in two weeks, ITAR-Tass
said.
	   All three explosions were blamed on gas, the Interior Ministry
press service told ITAR-Tass. The owner hooked his apartment
building to the city gas system without taking proper precautions,
it said.
	   But the Security Ministry said the first two blasts in the
Central Asian country _ on a bus and in a house of May 30 and 31 _
involved homemade bombs.
	   It said that four people have been arrested, all members of a
fundamentalist sect of Islam, Wahhabism, that has been blamed for
recent violence in several parts of the former Soviet Union.
	   ITAR-Tass said that police patrols have been increased in Osh
and checkpoints set up on the town outskirts to inspect vehicles
from other regions.
	   Osh is located near the border with Uzbekistan. Clashes between
ethnic Kyrgyz and Uzbeks were common even during Soviet times.

Depositors in failed investment firm storm meeting

	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ Angry depositors stormed a meeting and
forced the retreat of the chief executive officer of one of
Jamaica's failed financial institutions, with some climbing on top
of his car as he sped off.
	   Henry Fullerton, CEO of Caldon Financial Group, came
face-to-face with angry investors Thursday night at a meeting
scheduled to liquidate another company. The hotel management called
police as the protesters forced their way into the meeting and
confronted Fullerton, waving placards and shouting ``We want our
money!''
	   ``You're a damned thief. You're a disgrace to society. If you go
to Timbuktu we are coming there for you,'' one person shouted at
Fullerton.
	   Fullerton agreed in February to voluntarily liquidate the Caldon
Financial Group after months of financial difficulties. The
government spent dlrs 700 million last year to take over numerous
banks and financial institutions in Jamaica to try to avoid a
financial crisis.
	   After bodyguards ushered Fullerton outside to his car, some
protesters climbed on the vehicle to try to stop him from leaving.
	   ``My husband was on top of the car and he was almost run over,''
said Lorna Karjohn, one of the depositors.
	   Fullerton was also questioned for two hours Thursday by
investigators.
	   ``Mr. Fullerton has not been charged with fraud but our
investigations could lead to him being brought in for questioning
once again,'' said Fitz Bailey, superintendent of the crime
commission.
	   Liquidators from the international firm Peat Marwick, assigned
to the case after the government took over Caldon, said there may
not be funds or assets to repay depositors.

France, Romario's comments, Mandela's letter, strike called off in
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: includes new items on Nigerian mourning, cool weather in
Nantes, boy expelled from school &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS _ Flags will be flown at half staff at Saturday's
Nigeria-Spain game in memory of the late Nigerian leader Sani
Abacha.
	   FIFA spokesman Keith Cooper said Friday that there would be no
moment of silence and that it was up to each team whether they
wanted to wear black armbands in mourning at their Group D opener
in Nantes.
	   Abacha, a military strongman whose regime had been the focus of
human-rights protests, died Monday in Nigeria of a heart attack.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   YSSINGEAUX, France (AP) _ One reason the Iranians chose
Yssingeaux for their World Cup base was because its mild June
temperatures and sunny clime were like home.
	   But judging by the cold, wet weather that has welcomed them
since they arrived in this small town in the heart of France
Sunday, the players may be wondering if they took a wrong turn
somewhere.
	   The mercury plunged to a freezing 0 degrees centigrade (32 f.)
Friday, about 15 degrees less than the norm for this time of year,
following a hail storm the previous day.
	   So far, every one of the team's practice sessions has been under
heavy rain.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   PARIS (AP) _ Romario says he's in top form despite being dropped
by the Brazilian World Cup team with a leg injury. He's also
critical of the team's performance against Scotland.
	   ``Yesterday, I played a game of soccer with my friends. I train
everyday with my Flamengo team. I'm in top form,'' Romario was
quoted in an interview published Friday by the sports daily
L'Equip.
	   The paper also asked his opinion of Brazil's performance against
Scotland.
	   ``Brazil played very badly,'' Romario said. ``Certain players
were very nervous. I could sense the enormous tension coming from
them.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   PARIS (AP) _ South African president Nelson Mandela sent a
personal letter to every player on the World Cup team urging them
to make their countrymen proud at France 98, Le Parisien newspaper
reported Friday.
	   ``I am counting on you to bring glory to your country and your
people,'' Mandela told South Africa captain Lucas Radebe. For star
striker Benedict McCarthy, the president had these encouraging
words: ``You are the pride of your parents and your country.
Continue to score goals.''
	   Mandela sent the letters to encourage his team before they faced
France in Marseille Friday night. ``He wanted every one to have the
impression that he was on their side. He wrote the letters himself
last week,'' Le Parisien quoted the presidents spokesperson Parks
Mankahlana as saying. The paper also printed some extracts of the
letters.
	   The letters were sent to the South African embassy in Paris and
brought to the players early this week by South African ambassador
Barbara Masekela.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   NANTES, France (AP) _ Tram conductors called off a strike
planned for Saturday, the day of the Spain-Nigeria match in this
city in northwest France, after getting a bonus.
	   The conductors received a bonus of 1,800 francs (dlrs 300)
because of the extra work during the World Cup. Tram personnel
agreed to wait for the end of the World Cup before starting
contract negotiations on their wages for the tram line servicing
Beaujoire stadium.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   NORFOLK, England (AP) _ An 11-year-old boy was sent home by his
teachers after arriving at school with a design of the English flag
_ the cross of St. George _ dyed into his hair as a tribute to
England's World Cup team.
	   West Lynn primary school officials told Alec Wilkinson's mother
to take him home.
	   ``Everyone at the school is keen for England to do well, but
this is just going too far,'' said the local education authority,
Norfolk County Council.
	   ``The school has been very tolerant of some of this boy's
unusual hairstyles in the past, but this one was particularly
striking and went too far,'' a spokesman said.
	   ``There have to be acceptable standards of appearance. What sort
of impression would people get if every pupil had something like
this dyed into their hair?
	   Mrs. Wilkinson told her local newspaper, The Eastern Daily
Press: ``He's had green streaks, a chessboard and a spider's web
before now and they haven't said anything about it.''

Court sentences controversial miners' leader
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with prosecution appealing sentence.
 &UR; By MIHAELA ARMASELU &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ The leader of a group of coal miners
whose rampage through Bucharest in 1991 caused Romania's first
post-Communist prime minister to resign was sentenced Friday to 18
months in prison.
	   But the prosecution appealed the decision Friday afternoon,
calling the sentence ``illegal.''
	   The Bucharest appeals court sentenced Miron Cozma for illegally
possessing firearms and carrying an unlicensed pistol, but
acquitted him of undermining state authority and jeopardizing
railway traffic, national radio reported.
	   ``The sentence demonstrates there was no judicial evidence to
show that Cozma urged the miners to come in to the capital and
force the premier to resign,'' judicial analyst Mihai Valentin
Neagu told The Associated Press.
	   Neagu said if any miner had testified that Cozma had asked him
to come to the capital, the miner would have incriminated himself
as being involved in the rampage. Instead, all the miners have
remained silent about the incident.
	   In 1990, then-President Ion Iliescu called on miners under
Cozma's leadership to come to Bucharest to defend him during
anti-Communist protests. They rioted in the city center.
	   On Sept. 24, 1991, about 5,000 coal miners from Romania's Jiu
Valley mining area, headed by Cozma, commandeered trains and
traveled again to the capital. En route, miners destroyed some
railroad cars.
	   Armed with clubs, iron bars and tree branches, the miners,
protesting falling living standards, stormed government
headquarters and battled with security forces.
	   The clashes left three people dead and nearly 300 injured.
Miners demanded the resignation of Prime Minister Petre Roman, who
stepped down several days later.
	   Rampages in 1990 left six dead. But Cozma was not charged in
those clashes.
	   Cozma has been in custody since January 1997. If the prosecution
had not appealed, the months Cozma had spent in prison would have
been deducted from the court's sentence, and he could have been
released in 25 days.

Conflicting statements over resumption of talks highlights
</HEADLINE>
difficulties &QL; 
 &UR; EDs: UPDATES throughout with Pakistan denying it had agreed to
Indian proposal. CHANGES overline &QL; 
 &UR; By ARTHUR MAX &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India said Friday that Pakistan had
agreed to resume top-level talks later this month, but Pakistan's
foreign minister denied it and said India was ``trying to pull a
fast one.''
	   The conflicting statements appeared to dash hopes of an imminent
reversal in the escalating tension that followed nuclear tests by
both countries last month. Instead, it highlighted the distrust
that separates them and the difficulties in finding a common
language.
	   The countries apparently differed over the meeting's agenda and
venue.
	   An Indian government statement said New Delhi had received
Pakistan's response on Thursday to proposals submitted five months
ago to resume suspended negotiations.
	   ``We note that our view that the bilateral dialogue process
should proceed ahead for mutual benefit is finding acceptance in
Pakistan,'' it said.
	   The statement said India invited Pakistan's foreign minister to
New Delhi for talks later this month.
	   But Pakistani Foreign Minister Gohar Ayub Khan said his country
had not accepted the invitation. The Indians had made the
announcement ``unilaterally, on their own,'' he said.
	   If talks were held, they would be in the Pakistani capital of
Islamabad, not India's capital, he told The Associated Press.
	   In an interview with the British Broadcasting Corp., Khan
accused India of ``trying to pull a fast one'' by making an
announcement without Pakistan's agreement.
	   A statement released in Islamabad invited India's foreign
secretary to the Pakistani capital on June 20, and said the Indian
proposal was ``totally unrealistic.''
	   Khan told the AP that Pakistan's message to India on Thursday
was a proposal for a two-item agenda comprising confidence-building
measures and talks on the territorial dispute over the disputed
region of Kashmir. The Himalayan territory was the catalyst for two
wars between India and Pakistan in the last 50 years.
	   The Indian statement cited a broader agenda, including all the
items discussed in a series of meetings last year.
	   The Indian and Pakistani prime ministers are scheduled to attend
a regional summit next month, and a round of preliminary talks
would be expected to prepare the ground work for the first direct
meeting between the two men since the India's Hindu nationalist
government took office in March.
	   Tensions between the countries have been rising since May 11
when India conducted a series of nuclear tests and proclaimed
itself a nuclear weapons state. Pakistan followed suit two weeks
later, resisting international pressure for restraint. Both later
declared a moratorium on further tests.
	   The latest dispute came as the foreign ministers of eight
leading industrial nations stepped up sanctions against India and
Pakistan, deciding at a meeting in London to deny all loans except
those earmarked for humanitarian projects.
	   For weeks after the nuclear tests, Indian Prime Minister Atal
Bihari Vajpayee and Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif
proclaimed their readiness for talks, but without indicating any
concession that might make them more successful than earlier
disappointing rounds.

Annan recommends extension of U.N. Mission in Bosnia until June
</HEADLINE>
1999 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Citing the continuing challenge of
rebuilding Bosnia-Herzegovina, Secretary-General Kofi Annan
recommended Friday that the U.N. mission remain in the Balkan
country until at least June 21, 1999.
	   U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said the Security Council was
expected to approve the recommendation Monday.
	   In his report to the council, Annan said his recommendation was
based on the assumption that NATO-led troops would remain there
during that period to provide security for the U.N. operation.
	   The U.N. Mission in Bosnia-Herzegovina, whose current mandate
expires at the end of the month, includes about 2,000 civilian
police sent there to train and advise the newly reconstituted
police forces in parts of the country ruled by Bosnia Serbs and the
Muslim-Croat Federation.
	   About 200 of the U.N. police are Americans.
	   In the report, Annan outlined some of the problems facing the
United Nations in rebuilding Bosnia-Herzegovina following the 1995
Dayton Peace Accord, which ended the 3 1-2 year ethnic war.
	   ``Very regrettably, the last three months have seen an increase
in violent incidents aimed at returning refugees and displaced
persons, in particular those belonging to minority groups,'' he
said.
	   He said U.N. police were doing everything possible to facilitate
the return of all refugees but added ``it would be overly
optimistic to expect a decisive change before the nationwide
elections'' set for Sept. 13.
	   U.N. officials say they fear the three groups _ Muslims, Croats
and Serbs _ will try to prevent wholesale return of minorities
before the election to keep minority participation in the balloting
as low as possible.

	   METACORP Bhd has submitted a proposal to the Government to
upgrade three stretches of road leading into the city in a move to
ease traffic congestion, said chief executive officer Yusli Mohamed
Yusoff.
	   He said the roads are Jalan Loke Yew heading towards Bank
Negara, Jalan Melawati to Jalan Genting Kelang as well as Jalan
Pahang to Jalan Ipoh.
	   ``These stretches of road are not included in the concession
given to us earlier. That is why we cannot do anything when
consumers complain about traffic congestion along the roads.
	   However, Yusli did not disclose the amount needed to upgrade the
roads.
	   He added Metacorp will not impose toll on these roads. It has
however proposed a price increase on the current toll charges, a
longer concession period or both.
	   The company is the concession holder for Jalan Pahang, Sungei
Besi Expressway and East-West Link Expressway. The concessions will
end by year 2018.
	   Speaking after the company's annual meeting in Kuala Lumpur
yesterday, Yusli said Metacorp's tolling operations, which is the
core business, generated revenue of RM65 million per year.
	   Urban toll roads roads are generally less affected by the
economic slowdown although traffic flow has dropped slightly for
this year especially for commercial vehicles, he added.
	   On the company's property projects, Yusli said launching of new
phases at Taman Tasik Utama in Ayer Keroh, Malacca, would be
carefully planned.
	   ``We are considering more of low and medium cost housing
projects and probably will launch them by next year.''
	   Yusli said the company's investment in Spitalfields Holdings Ltd
and Spitalfields Development Group for the development of
residential and office space in London has also provided a good
return.
	   He said Metacorp invested about STG23 million (about RM151
million) for the project, adding that the company is expected to
make about 25 per cent return on the investment within the next few
years.
	   In April, a major part of the Spitalfields site was sold to
London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange.
	   Yusli said part of the proceeds from the sale was used to reduce
Metacorp's borrowings by STG10 million. The company had borrowed
STG21.5 million to finance the project.
	   At the three-hour meeting shareholders took on a ballot vote to
re-elect Datuk Mohamed Ishak Mohamed Ariff, David William Berry and
Marzuki Rafie to the board of directors. Mohamed Ishak was also
re-elected chairman of Metacorp.

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Police arrested Friday the son of a family
that was wiped out in an 11-person murder which has shocked Jordan.
	   One or more gunmen shot school bus driver Amin Qashash, 50, his
wife, four children, a son-in-law and four grandchildren before
dawn Thursday in their home in Banayat, a village 20 kilometers (12
miles) northwest of Amman, government officials said.
	   Police announced they had arrested Qashash's son, Saeed, 18, but
did not say if he had any accomplices.
	   Saeed had confessed to killing his family out of fear that he
might fail his high school exams, police said.
	   The family was shot in their house's basement and a brick wall
was then built to hide its entrance, an official said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
	   A quiet country with a reputation for security, Jordan has been
shaken recently by a series of shootings and bombings.

<TEXT>
	   LENS, France (AP) _ Ebbe Sand and Martin Jorgensen squandered
two easy chances as Denmark dominated but was held 0-0 by Saudi
Arabia in the first half of their World Cup Group C game Friday.
	   The Danes had a great chance to take an 18th minute lead when
Morten Wieghorst climbed above the Saudi defense to meet a free
kick and head the ball into the danger area. But Sand, with only
the 'keeper to beat, prodded the ball over the bar from eight
meters (yards).
	   Jorgensen wasted another good opening in the 32nd when Brian
Laudrup sliced open the Saudi defense with an angled, forward pass.
But the Udinese striker, well clear of the defense, fired well wide
from close range.
	   The Saudi defense failed to clear a free kick a minute later and
Marc Rieper almost scrambled the ball in from four meters out.
	   The Saudi strikeforce made little impression in the opening 40
minutes of the game but Danish 'keeper Peter Schmeichel made a
diving, fingertip save from a free kick by Saeed Owairan just
before the break, although the ball appeared to be going inches
wide of the post.
	   Lineups:
	   Denmark _ Peter Schmeichel, Michael Schjonberg, Marc Rieper, Jes
Hogh, Thomas Helveg, Michael Laudrup, Brian Laudrup, Soren Colding,
Morten Wieghorst, Ebbe Sand, Martin Jorgensen.

	   MONKEYS from secondary jungle near Overseas Union Garden, Kuala
Lumpur, are driving residents up the wall with their mischief.
	   The residents of Jalan Hujan Abu and Jalan Hujan Rahmat are at
their wits' end over the destruction to household items and theft
of food over the past three weeks.
	   A.T. Pani of Jalan Hujan Abu 3 said residents feared the monkeys
would eventually attack them as they are aggresive.
	   He said a group of four monkeys usually come to the area between
3pm and 5pm.
	   Pani and his sister, who are both visually handicapped, cannot
do much if they are attacked.
	   ``To make matters, I have a two-month-old daughter who is
defenceless against the creatures,'' he said, adding that the
monkeys moved very fast.
	   Pani said the monkeys even took a dip in large containers
containing water stored because of the rationing exercise.
	   ``We have to keep all doors and windows closed all the time as
we fear they will come into the house and create mischief.''
	   According to Pani, the monkeys were not the least afraid of
residents who tried to chase them away with sticks.
	   ``Instead, they advanced and tried attacking us,'' he added.
	   Chandra Tilaka said a neighbour had his house ransacked by the
monkeys who had found their way in through an unlatched bedroom
window.
	   ``They opened biscuit tins and eat other food in the kitchen.
They also soiled the settee and bed,'' she said.
	   Tilaka said it was possible that the monkeys had come from an
area around the nearby Kesas Highway after losing their natural
habitat.
	   ``They are obviously moving from place to place. We are not even
able to put our clothes out to dry in the porch because of the
menace,'' she said.
	   She said a friend told her the monkeys had previously created
havoc in Jalan Hujan Emas and Jalan Hujan Gerimis.
	   ``We called Kuala Lumpur City Hall for help but were told that
the matter was under the jurisdiction of the Parks and Wildlife
Department.''
	   Tilaka said an officer from the department came to the area on
Wednesday after being alerted to the problem and laid traps in the
nearby jungle.

Sampras loses in straight sets to Woodforde
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Updated with first quarterfinal, trims

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Pete Sampras suffered a setback in his Wimbledon
preparations Friday when he was beaten in straight sets by
Australia's Mark Woodforde at the Queen's Club grass-court
tournament.
	   The top-seeded Sampras, who had a bye in the first round and
beat Wayne Black in the second round, looked flat as he slumped to
a 6-3, 6-2 defeat on his favorite surface.
	   It was the latest surprising loss for Sampras, who was ousted in
the second round of the French Open by little-known Ramon Delgado
of Paraguay.
	   Sampras had beaten the 66th-ranked Woodforde, known primarily as
a doubles specialist, in all of their previous 10 matches and
dropped only two sets in the process.
	   Sampras entered Queen's as a tuneup for Wimbledon, a tournament
he has won four times and where he is the defending champion.
	   Queen's also lost its No. 2 seed when Greg Rusedski of Britain
suffered an ankle injury during his third-round match against
Italian qualifier Laurence Tieleman.
	   With the score at 2-2 in the first set, Rusedski slipped while
stretching for a backhand volley and fell awkwardly with his left
leg buckling underneath him.
	   Rusedski screamed in pain and writhed on the grass before being
carried off the court and taken to a hospital for X-rays.
	   Tournament doctor Johnnie Gaynor said it appeared to be just a
sprain. It wasn't immediately clear whether the injury would force
Rusedski to miss Wimbledon, where he reached the quarterfinals last
year.
	   Sampras declined to speak to the media until after his doubles
match later in the day.
	   Woodforde said players have noticed that Sampras is lacking
motivation this year.
	   ``Everyone is aware that, motivation-wise, he's not there,''
Woodforde said. ``I played a pretty good tight match against him,
and he just wasn't able to pick it up where in the past he was able
to take it up a notch or two. That's where he is found wanting.''
	   Woodforde mixed up his shots, returning well and often catching
Sampras with lobs whenever the American ventured to the net. But
his most effective tactic was to hit a succession of drop volleys
which fell just over the net and left Sampras stranded.
	   The Australian also served far better than Sampras, hitting
three aces in the opening game to set the tone of the match.
	   In contrast, Sampras produced four double-faults, the last of
which gave Woodforde a break for 3-2 in the second set. A netted
backhand voley then gave Woodforde a second break for 5-2.
	   After so many defeats to Sampras, Woodforde was surprised he
finally made his breakthrough on grass.
	   ``I don't know if I 100 percent believed that I could beat
Sampras, especially on grass,'' he said. ``I maybe would have given
myself more of a chance on a different surface. Hard court,
perhaps.''
	   In order to clear up a backlog of matches caused by rain delays,
players faced the prospect of playing two matches _ third round and
quarterinals _ to get the tournament back on track.
	   Seventh-seeded Tim Henman of Britain became the highest ranked
played to reach the quarterfinals with a 6-1, 6-7 (7-5), 6-4
victory over 1997 champion and 10th-seeded Goran Ivanisevic.
	   In the first quarterfinal match, 14th-seeded Byron Black of
Zimbabwe defeated Brian MacPhie, United States, 7-5, 6-1.

Daughter of jailed Nigerian politician calls for his release
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CAROLINE BYRNE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Demonstrators outside the Nigerian embassy Friday
demanded the release of Moshood Abiola, who apparently won the 1993
presidential elections but was jailed after the vote was annulled.
	   Among the two dozen protesters was Abiola's daughter, Wura
Abiola, who said demands were mounting for the release of the
millionaire after Nigerian dictator General Sani Abacha died of a
heart attack Monday.
	   ``Those whispers are that people will not accept anything but a
complete change and a change in the way our leaders are being
treated, a change in the way our country is being run and that
means free the detained politicians,'' said Wura Abiola, who has
not seen her father for a year.
	   ``The people feel a groundswell of hope and nothing but real
change will make them happy,'' she said.
	   The protest marked the annulment of the June 12, 1993,
presidential elections in which, according to his supporters, her
father won an estimated 85 percent of the popular vote.
	   Abiola, who is being held in solitary confinement, is a
southerner who would have broken the traditional northern hold on
power if he'd become president.
	   Nigeria's new ruler, Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar, has said he plans
to steer the nation toward an elected civilian government, but has
not announced the release of Abiola or other political prisoners.
	   The demonstrators chanted and surrounded an effigy of Abubakar
crucified on a makeshift cross. Around the crucifix, a sign read
``Abacha is dead. Abubakar Must Go Now.''
	   ``The process of change has started and its like a rock rolling
down a hill. It will crush as many people as that stand in its
way,'' said Oche Onyeagucha, the secretary for external affairs of
the Democratic Alternative Party, another emigre Nigerian group.

	   PEDESTRIAN walkways along Jalan Tan Cheng Lock, Jalan Silang and
Leboh Pudu are finally free of the 92 licensed hawkers and traders
with the exception of several itinerant ones playing hide and seek
with City Hall enforcement officers.
	   Kuala Lumpur City Hall Press officer Rozielawatie Rahmat said
hawkers and traders have been relocated to backlanes, including
Lorong Bandar and Lorong Panggung, as well as behind the Kota Raya
shopping complex.
	   She said the traders were relocated in stages from April in
preparation for the Commonwealth Games. A check by the New Straits
Times revealed pavements to be free of hawkers.
	   The illegal hawkers were, however, trading along the pavements
despite signboards stating that it was an offence to do so.
	   It is understood that the hawkers move their stalls when
enforcement officers make their rounds. Pedestrians were often
forced onto the roads as customers at the stalls monopolised the
pavements.
	   Meanwhile, City Hall Director-General (II) Datuk Ghani Rais said
the relocation was an on-going exercise with efforts concentrated
initially at the city centre. This was part of the local
authority's preparation for the Commonwealth Games, he added.
	   He said by 2000, roadside hawking would be a thing of the past
as all traders and hawkers would be relocated into designated
hawker centres or shopping complexes.

	   EFFORTS to make Malaysia a nation of drugs within 25 years are
on, starting with a programme to turn the children born today into
a dadah- free generation.
	   The target is to be achieved through a series of educational
programmes addressing the problem of dadah abuse in the family
unit, at schools, at work and country wide.
	   Preventive programmes need to begin early in a child's life,
starting at the pre-school level and implemented gradually at all
levels of primary, secondary and tertiary education.
	   ``A time span of 25 years or roughly one generation is our
target in realising the vision ... By the year 2023, we envisage
the emergence of a whole drug-free generation nationwide,'' Deputy
Home Minister Datuk Mohamad Tajol Rosli said in New York on
Wednesday.
	   Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly Special Session
on the World Drug Problem, he said the task was daunting but the
process had already begun in the last few months.
	   ``Admittedly, this is an ambitious vision. However, it is not
just a rhetorical proposal. We aim for it to be a serious,
comprehensive and workable long-term strategy.
	   ``We are convinced that it is achievable and we are determined
to achieve it.''
	   In an interview later, Tajol said a crucial step in eradicating
the dadah problem was to curtail demand, and that could be done by
educating the people, especially parents and youths on the dadah
scourge.
	   For example, two weeks ago the National Narcotics Council, which
co- ordinated efforts to combat dadah abuse, started a programme
called ``A Day With the Community'' aimed at educating parents as
well as youths on the dangers of dadah abuse.
	   The event held at Kampung Kerinchi in Kuala Lumpur brought home
the horrors of dadah menace.
	   ``We showed the residents what is dadah, the punishment for
trafficking as well as the effects of dadah.
	   Tajol said there was a demonstration on how a convicted
trafficker is whipped, to strike fear among those present,
especially the youths. Former addicts were also brought in to talk
to the residents.
	   Parents were counselled on ways to keep narcotics out of their
homes as well as how to detect tell-tale signs that their children
are using dadah.
	   There were also discreet consultations for dadah users and their
families.
	   The anti-dadah message targeted at youths will also employ the
``reverse role model'' technique.
	   In urban areas where young people frequented clubs and discos,
there is a tendency for some of them to indulge in psychotropic
drugs like Ecstasy.
	   In some youth circles such indulgence was considered hip and
trendy.
	   ``We will ask the boys or girls whether they want to spend the
rest of their lives with peers that take dadah,'' Tajol said,
adding that if they could see the final consequence of dadah abuse
many would naturally be turned off.
	   He said so far, about 300 pupils had been tested positive for
dadah abuse.

World Cup: Hadji slightly bruised but ready for Brazil
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TAREK EL-TABLAWY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AIX-EN-PROVENCE, France (AP) _ A toe injury, which doctors say
needs about three weeks to heal, will not prevent Morocco's star
midfielder from donning the team jersey in the match against
Brazil.
	   Deportive La Coruna's El-Moustafa Hadji, who fractured his toe
recently, resumed his training Friday along with the rest of the
team. He did not, however, practice with a ball due to slight
swelling on the right foot.
	   ``I'll be ready to play against the Brazilians,'' said Hadji,
adding that the Norway match Wednesday left him feeling mild
discomfort after a run in with another player.
	   Even for those who weren't injured, however, the first day of
preparation for the June 16 match against Brazil in Nantes was more
laid back than other training sessions.
	   ``They are still recovering from the last match (against
Norway),'' said team coach Henri Michel after the Atlas Lions
finished their two-hour drills and stretching session Friday.
	   But there is nothing laid back about how much emphasis Michel
and the players are putting on this match.
	   ``We are giving this (match) all the importance it deserves,''
said Michel. ``Brazil ... have the ability to find a goal when
necessary.''
	   The much-awaited match, the team's second Group A competition,
is not the first time they have faced the defending champions on
the field. The two met in Brazil in October for a showdown which
the hosts won 2-0, again partly because of Morocco's habit of
making costly defense mistakes at crucial times. It is a
shortcoming that gave them a 2-2 draw against Norway Wednesday,
instead of a win.
	   ``We were afraid of them that time,'' goalie Driss Benzekri told
the AP. ``We saw, however, that the only problem was the mistakes
we made.''
	   Michel has voiced similar fears, but is confident that ``Brazil
will not have an easy time getting past strong tactical players
like (defender Noureddine) Naybet and Hadji.''
	   Team captain Naybet, who also plays for Deportive La Coruna, was
equally confident.
	   ``It will be a difficult match, but we are up to the
challenge,'' he said.

Graf to meet DFS Classic title-holder in semifinals

 &UR; Eds: ADDS Graf quotes in grafs 4-7

<TEXT>
	   BIRMINGHAM, England (AP) _ Steffi Graf, improving with each
match in her preparation for Wimbledon, advanced to the semifinals
of the DFS Classic with a straight-set victory Friday over Spain's
Maria Luisa Serna.
	   The seven-time Wimbledon champion took 68 minutes to beat Serna
6-4, 6-4 and set up a semifinal clash with defending title holder
Nathalie Tauziat of France.
	   Graf, playing only her third tournament since a knee operation
last June, dropped only one service game to the left-hander from
Barcelona.
	   The German said her comeback was progressing better than she had
expected.
	   ``I hoped I would have two matches here and now I'm going to
have four, which I'm delighted to have,'' she said.
	   Graf, who has a 19-0 record against Tauziat, said she was
physically fit and keen as ever to win.
	   ``It isn't difficult for me to motivate myself,'' she said. ``I
enjoy playing and the game still fascinates me enough to go out
there.''
	   Earlier, the third-seeded Tauziat downed unseeded Australian
Kerry-Anne Guse 6-2, 6-3.
	   Tauziat had two priorities Friday _ advance to the semifinals
and then get away in time to watch France play South Africa in the
World Cup.
	   ``I love football but I'm happy not to be in Paris during the
World Cup because there are so many people there now,'' she said.
``I will be quite happy watching it on television.''

	   IN the early 1970s a civil servant from the top echelon suddenly
got the inspiration that subdivision of land should be carried out
by private companies.
	   Whether the inspiration was divine or trading, the transfer of
responsibility has gradually eliminated the experience land
officers have acquired over generations.
	   Today's land officers have been deprived of a tremendous wealth
of experience; the chief among them can hardly indicate in a plan
where the sun rises.
	   By virtue of being land officers, the law continues to authorise
them to determine the nature of each subdivision, and empowers them
to approve, reject or amend the application accordingly. However,
they are not in a position anymore to decide, much less understand
the nature of the operation, because for more than 30 years others
have been preparing the application for them.
	   Due to this, their performance in other land matters
deteriorate, causing complaints and criticisms.

Chechnya vows to crack down on kidnappings
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Chechnya will redouble efforts to crackdown on
kidnappings and may start detaining relatives of hostage-takers
until they surrender, a news agency reported Friday.
	   Hundreds of people have been kidnapped in Chechnya and
surrounding regions, usually for ransom, since the region's
two-year war for independence from Russia ended in 1996.
	   Acting Prime Minister Shamil Basayev told Interfax that one
possible solution was ``detaining the close relatives of the
kidnappers until they release the hostages and come to law
enforcement agencies.''
	   ``A kidnapper's family is normally perfectly aware of his
illegal actions and sometimes helps (him) instead of calling him to
order,'' Basayev said. He noted that relatives also benefit from
any ransom received.
	   Basayev said he was also considering setting up a special force
to fight groups that law enforcement agencies can't handle.
	   ``It would make sense to vest such a unit with the right to
carry out operations without performing legal formalities,'' he
said, noting that obtaining warrants and coming up with plans takes
time and can lead to leaks.
	   Chechnya considers itself independent and has run its own
affairs since Russian troops pulled out in the fall of 1996. Moscow
says the Muslim republic remains a part of Russia.

World Cup: Paraguayan goalkeeper almost makes history
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MONTPELLIER, France (AP) _ Jose Luis Chilavert almost made World
Cup history. And he is irked that he missed his chance.
	   Bulgarian Goalkeeper Zdravko Zdravkov fully stretched to his
upper right to deny his flamboyant Paraguayan counterpart on a
second-half, 25-meter free kick, leaving Bulgaria and Paraguay with
a goalless draw in their World Cup opener Friday.
	   ``I already saw the ball in the net,'' said Chilavert, who has
35 goals in his professional career. ``Too bad, I could have made
history.''
	   No goalkeeper has ever scored in a World Cup match except in a
penalty shootout.
	   The 32-year-old Chilavert has a reputation for his offensive
forays, in addition to a temper.
	   Chilavert's 78th-minute chance was the highlight of a match that
saw few good opportunities _ and poor finishing by both sides on
the ones that were created.
	   Bulgaria had its chance in the 35th minute when Hristo Stoichkov
beat two defenders and knocked the ball off the right post with a
left-footed shot which had Chilavert totally beaten.
	   The Bulgarians played the final two minutes with only 10 men
after Anatoli Nankov earned his second yellow. Paraguay had two
chances following the sending off, but failed to convert.
	   Paraguay dominated the second half, getting several chances
before Chilavert's free kick.
	   ``We lacked poise to finish the plays,'' Paraguay coach Paulo
Cesar Carpeggiani said. ``We always missed the last pass.''
	   Stoichkov set up the best Bulgarian opportunity in the second
half when he charged into the box from the left, crossed the ball
to an unmarked Luboslav Penev, who blasted high from six yards with
only Chilavert to beat.
	   ``We had some tactical errors on both sides of the defense,''
Carpeggiani said. ``But we made some adjustments and improved in
the second half. Unfortunately, it wasn't enough to win. We lacked
the finishing touch.''
	   The match was a game of missed opportunities.
	   In the fifth minute, Stoichkov was upended in the Paraguayan box
but his pleas to Saudi referee Abdul Rahman Al-Zeid went unheeded.
	   ``It was a 100 percent penalty,'' Bulgarian coach Hristo Bonev
said. ``We played well in the first half, but our game collapsed in
the second.''
	   Stoichkov was yellow-carded in injury time for a reckless
tackle.
	   ``Paraguay was supposed to be an easy team to beat, but this is
not so and I feel very proud of what we've done,'' Chilavert said.

	   RECENTLY, I went to watch the movie ``Godzilla'' at Rex Cinema
in Kuala Lumpur, and it was a nightmare for me.
	   Somebody put bubble gum on my chair. Seated at the back of me
were some children and beside me were two adults. So I do not know
who put it there.
	   It is high time bubble gum was banned in public places. It is
already banned in Singapore because people use it to jam the lifts
in high-rise buildings.

Frustrated Hungarians yank their kids from schools in Slovakia

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with rally in Galanta, quotes from statement. &QL; 
 &UR; By JANA DOROTKOVA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ Tensions that have their roots in
the Austro-Hungarian Empire have erupted in a wave of school
protests by Hungarians living in Slovakia.
	   Accusing the government of blatant disregard of the nation's
largest minority, ethnic Hungarian parents have pulled their
children from school in one-day protests in several regions _ the
latest on Friday.
	   The boycott was prompted by an education bill in parliament
that, if approved as expected, would require Hungarian children to
drop Hungarian-language history classes and learn history and
geography in Slovak language instead. But the overriding issue,
according to the parents, is the government's consistently unfair
treatment of Hungarians.
	   ``We want our children to learn the Slovak language properly,
but we want them to remain Hungarian,'' said Ladislav Gyurovszki, a
leader of the Association of Hungarian Parents in Slovakia.
	   ``The state wants them to lose their national identity,'' he
said.
	   Friday's protests by Hungarians in the Galanta, Moldava and Sala
districts followed a similar one last week in Komarno.
	   Other districts were expected to join the protest next week,
said Rudolf Meszes, the chairman of the parents' association.
	   Just over 3,000 ethnic Hungarians took part in an early evening
rally at Galanta, some 50 kilometers (30 miles) east of Bratislava
to protest the planned legislation.
	   Participants, most of whom are fluent in Slovak, refused to
answer questions asked by a reporter in Slovak.
	   A statement read to the demonstrators, some of whom arrived by
bus from elsewhere in Slovakia, said: ``We protest and we refuse to
be considered second-rate citizens.
	   ``Our Hungarian community is also a constituent element of the
Slovak republic,'' it said. ``We are industrious, honest taxpayers
of the Slovak Republic and we want adequate rights.''

a more responsible role by cancelling projects which would endanger

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Tens of thousands of people fled the
former Portuguese colony of Guinea-Bissau on Friday as government
troops fought renegade soldiers who launched a coup attempt,
according to reports.
	   As many as 40,000 people in the West African nation were heading
on foot along the road to the northern border with Senegal, a
Portuguese journalist in the area said, citing local reports.
	   Senegal closed the border on Thursday while medical teams were
dispatched to vaccinate the refugees against yellow fever and
meningitis before they were allowed into the country, Pedro Rosa
Mendes told Portuguese state radio Antena 1.
	   Government troops, supported by soldiers from neighboring
Senegal and the Republic of Guinea, meanwhile maintained their
siege of a military garrison in a northern suburb of the capital
Bissau, where an unknown number of rebels have been holed up since
their attempted powergrab on Sunday.
	   A spokesman for the Portuguese Prime Minister's office, who was
in contact with the Portuguese embassy in Bissau, said sporadic
shelling and automatic weapon fire could be heard in the capital
throughout the day.
	   ``It's a very unstable situation. We're not sure who's
winning,'' the spokesman said on customary condition of anonymity,
adding that the embassy had been hit by several stray shells.
	   The French embassy was hit by a bazooka shell but no one was
injured, the Portuguese news agency Lusa reported, citing
diplomatic sources in Dakar in Senegal.
	   Portuguese residents in Bafata, the country's second-largest
city, 140 kilometers (87 miles) to the east of Bissau, told Lusa
there was no military activity in the area.
	   The president of the National Assembly Malan Sanha said
representatives from Muslim and Catholic associations had allied
with lawmakers to propose talks, Lusa reported.
	   The two sides had ``demonstrated interest'' in holding talks,
Sanha was quoted as saying by Lusa, although he declined to provide
further details.
	   However, an unidentified western diplomat quoted by Lusa said
President Joao Bernardo Vieira was reluctant to enter talks and was
confident in his ability to defeat the rebels militarily.
	   More than 2,200 people, mostly foreigners, were evacuated from
Bissau on a Portuguese merchant ship Thursday.
	   Vitor Duque, an official of the shipping company that provided
the vessel told, Antena 1 that the passengers, including children
and old people, were packed on the deck. The huge container ship
was designed to hold only 18 people.
	   The ship was due to arrive in Dakar at about 5 p.m. (1700 GMT),
Duque said.
	   A Portuguese frigate was expected to arrive in Guinea-Bissau on
Sunday to oversee the evacuation of other foreigners, diplomats
said.
	   Portuguese phone company Marconi said international phone lines
apparently had been cut in Bissau, making contact impossible.
	   The rebels are led by former armed forces chief Brig. Ansumane
Mane, who was fired in January amid allegations he was involved in
smuggling arms to rebels in Senegal. He has accused Vieira of
corruption and called on him to step down so that early elections
can be held.
	   Vieira himself came to power in a 1980 coup. He was elected in
the country's first democratic elections for president and
parliament four years ago.

Regional vote in Italy a test for reborn Christian Democrats
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Politicians from a centrist movement formed to
replace the defunct Christian Democrats were wrapping up their
campaign Friday in a regional election seen as a major test of
their ambitions.
	   The Christian Democrats were Italy's dominant party after World
War II, but corruption scandals in the early '90s brought the
party's demise.
	   Its politicians went on to form a half-dozen minor parties.
	   For the first time, the small parties are running together
Sunday in a coalition called the Popular Reformer Center. The
election is the latest in a series of staggered local voting over
the last few weeks. Sunday's will be held in Fruili Venezia Giulia,
a northeastern region where nearly 1.1 million people are eligible
to vote.
	   ``It's a dress rehearsal for a big Catholic and lay movement,''
said former Italian president Francesco Cossiga, who has been
spearheading the resurrection of a big centrist party.
	   Results are expected on Monday.
	   In local elections elsewhere in Italy a week ago, the
center-right coaltion led by Silvio Berlusconi, the media tycoon
and former premier, defeated most of the mayoral candidates backed
by Premier Romano Prodi's center-left.

	   THE closure of the only access road between Taman Sri Melor and
Taman Sri Intan, Kajang, and Sungai Chua by the Selangor State
Development Corporation's on Tuesday has left some 387 families in
the lurch.
	   They now have to use an old wooden bridge to get to the main
road in Bangi and on to Sungai Chua.
	   The residents claimed the bridge was too narrow, allowed only
one-way traffic flow, and was not suitable for heavy vehicles.
	   They fear that fire engines would not be able to use the bridge
to across in the event of a fire at the other side.
	   Even water tankers will not be able to use the bridge, a
resident said.
	   The closure of the access road has also caused massive traffic
congestion along Persiaran Bangi, Jalan Reko and Jalan Sungai Chua
as motorists used these roads as shortcuts from Bandar Baru Bangi
to Sungai Chua.
	   Taman Sri Melor Residents Association secretary Abdul Aziz Abdul
Rahman said residents were upset as the PKNS had not provided an
alternative route.
	   ``PKNS should have asked for views from residents associations
before taking such a drastic step,'' Abdul Aziz said.
	   He said at an earlier meeting between residents associations,
PKNS officials and the developers of Taman Sri Melor and Taman Sri
Intan, the corporation had agreed to build a billet bridge from
Taman Sri Intan to Persiaran Bangi as an alternative route.
	   He said the steel-cabled bridge would provide temporary access
until PKNS fully developed Section 7 and Bandar Baru Bangi.
	   He urged the Kajang Municipal Council (MPKJ) to identify the
access road approved by the council when the former Hulu Langat
District Council approved the housing projects.
	   ``Nothing has been done over the last two years even after the
council had issued the certificate of fitness,'' he said
``Developers and PKNS should not compromise on the basic
infrastructure,''
	   he added.
	   Meanwhile, Taman Sri Intan Residents Association chairman
Mustafa Sulaiman regretted that the wooden bridge had been offered
as an alternative temporary measure.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Cohen, Sergeyev quotes &QL; 
 &UR; By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Military Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen
said Friday that NATO's planned air power demonstration and
consideration of armed intervention is sending a message to
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic that he should halt the
slaughter of innocent people in Kosovo.
	   ``We are looking at a very short time frame ... to solve this
peacefully,'' Cohen told a news conference at the end of a two-day
defense ministers' meeting at NATO headquarters.
	   Cohen had a private meeting with Russian Defense Minister Igor
Sergeyev in the morning, then again in the afternoon with the other
15 NATO defense ministers as part of the NATO-Russia Permanent
Joint Council.
	   The talks came a day after the Western alliance approved a
show-of-force air exercise over Yugoslav neighbors Albania and
Macedonia and also ordered options be drawn up for possible
intervention in Kosovo, including direct air strikes and the use of
ground troops.
	   Russia opposes the military options NATO is considering for the
Serbian province.
	   ``NATO, all the ministers, and Russia have a unanimous attitude
toward events in Kosovo,'' Sergeyev said at another news
conference. ``Currently, we have to focus on political measures.''
	   More than 250 people have died in clashes between government
forces and the Kosovo Liberation movement. Ethnic Albanians
comprise 90 percent of the province's population.
	   Cohen said he hoped Sergeyev would carry a message back to
President Boris Yeltsin that there is ``undivided consensus by the
NATO countries,'' on the attitude to take toward Yugoslavia.
	   ``That will have an impression, I hope, on President Yeltsin,''
he said.
	   In an interview with ABC television, Cohen warned that NATO's
dim view of the crackdown in Kosovo not be taken too lightly.
	   The NATO alliance agrees ``the bloodshed has to stop; that very
strong message has to be sent to Mr. Milosevic that he has to cease
and desist the slaughter, the shelling of villages and killing of
innocent people and to resolve this peacefully,'' Cohen said.
	   ``We're sending a signal that ... an air exercise will
demonstrate that we have the capacity to mobilize very quickly and
demonstrate rapidly deployable power. But secondly, it also
demonstrates there is solidarity of support and consensus
throughout NATO and beyond NATO itself,'' Cohen said.
	   Cohen met for 45 minutes with the Russian at NATO headquarters
here. Gen. Hugh Shelton, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
also attended.
	   Cohen's meeting with Sergeyev was ``very friendly and frank
throughout,'' said a U.S. defense official who spoke on condition
of anonymity.
	   It came a day after the NATO alliance approved a show-of-force
air exercise over Yugoslav neighbors Albania and Macedonia. NATO
also ordered options be drawn up for possible intervention in
Kosovo, including direct air strikes or the use of ground troops.
	   NATO Secretary General Javier Solana said Thursday that Russia
advised the alliance it would not participate in NATO's plans for
an air exercise over Albania and Macedonia. The alliance hopes the
show of military strength can persuade Milosevic to halt attacks on
ethnic Albanian separatists in Kosovo.
	   ``We would like to have as many partners as possible participate
in the exercise,'' Solana said.
	   Russia, which has been brought into some NATO consultations, had
been kept informed of plans for potential military exercises in the
Balkans and at one time had ``showed an interest in
participating,'' Solana said. That was before the most recent
outbreak of violence in Kosovo and NATO's announcement of its air
maneuvers.
	   Moscow favors strengthened control over Kosovo's borders with
Albania and Macedonia. Russia could play a pivotal role in the
persuading Milosevic to turn around the crisis in the
independence-minded province of Serbia, Yugoslavia's dominant
republic.
	   On Thursday, NATO ministers approved a package they hope will
persuade Milosevic to pull back his Serb-led army and police forces
in the province.
	   ``President Milosevic would be rash and foolish if he would
ignore the message coming from NATO,'' said British Defense
Secretary George Robertson. ``The message is clear and unambiguous:
`Belgrade, think again.'''
	   Under the measures, NATO will conduct simulated air attacks in
Albania and Macedonia, probably next week, and study options for
further actions ranging from accelerated planning for military
exercises to direct air strikes inside Yugoslavia and use of ground
troops.
	   This is aimed at persuading Milosevic to do three things:
declare a cease-fire in Kosovo; withdraw his forces and end the
repression of the ethnic Albanians; and open serious negotiations
with the opposition.
	   ``We will be holding exercises in the region, including
immediately an air exercise which will demonstrate NATO's
capability to rapidly project power into the region,'' Solana said.
	   German Defense Minister Volker Ruehe said: ``We cannot afford
any longer to focus on hollow solutions of rather symbolic
character like border security missions in Albania or Macedonia.''
	   Added French Defense Minister Alain Richard: ``We can't let the
protagonists believe that we are prepared to stop at a certain
stage.''

Death toll in Armenian bus fire rises to six
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YEREVAN, Armenia (AP) _ Two students died Friday from burns
suffered in a bus fire, bringing the death toll to six.
	   More than 20 people were badly burned when their bus, carrying
40 students, teachers and parents returning from a picnic, exploded
Sunday on a country road near the village of Bartsrashen, 30
kilometers (19 miles) south of Yerevan.
	   Officials said the explosion was apparently caused by a gas
leak.
	   Most buses and other vehicles in Armenia run on natural gas.
Gasoline is in short supply due to an economic blockade imposed by
neighboring Azerbaijan because of the two countries' territorial
conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh.
	   A teacher and three students remain in critical condition,
hospital officials said.

	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ The people shouting ``Go France''
included Algerians just off the boat, kids of Senegalese descent,
and right-wing whites who in normal times say Arabs and blacks
should go home.
	   And South African fans, throwing their arms around the shoulders
of French foes and sharing their beer, were of as many colors as
the new South African flag.
	   This is Marseille, a tough town at the heart of southern France,
where racial politics can get ugly. But when World Cup football is
concerned, all else falls away.
	   ``Football is a religion here, pure and simple,'' said Jean-Luc
Bailly, a local fruit and vegetable king. That is said about a lot
of places, but in Marseille it is no figure of speech.
	   At the ancient port, a happy band of South Africans chanted
Xhosa war cries and hailed their team, ``Bafana Bafana.'' Laughing
Frenchmen fought back with, ``La Marseillaise.''
	   The musical combat recalled that scene out of ``Casablanca,''
but this was more serious than a mere world war. France was about
play its opening match. South Africa would play its first World Cup
match ever.
	   ``We'll win, of course, against all odds,'' Greg Judge
pronounced, with a dubious chuckle. Normally clad in a somber
banker's suit, he wore a huge floppy jester's hat in South African
colors.
	   ``And if we don't, we're still having so much fun it's
unbelievable,'' he said. ``This is the best ever laugh. The French
are cool dudes, and we're loving it.''
	   Judge was among two dozen countrymen, who were leading French
passersby in gyrating African dance. ``We are maybe 4,000 at
most,'' he said. ``We'll have to shout loud to outdo 60,000
Frenchmen.''
	   The French would be shouting loudest for Zinedine Zidane, their
beloved ``Zizou,'' the son of an Algerian night watchman who grew
up in the hardscrabble immigrant suburbs north of Marseille.
	   Another handful of French players spent time with Olympique de
Marseille, ``OM,'' the first division team that is a deity to the
city's massive football congregation.
	   The national team, ``Les Bleus,'' includes black Frenchmen from
Africa, the South Pacific, the Caribbean and South America.
	   Far more than intolerance, the hosts and visitors worried about
the wind, a dreaded ``mistral'' blow that gusted to 120 kilometers
per hour (75 miles an hour) and threatened to give the match the
air of a basketball game.
	   Marseille is nuts about soccer even during the off season. Now
that France is playing its first World Cup game since 1986, the
city talks of nothing else.
	   At Bailly's shop, Le Jardin d'Etienne, housewives poking the
plums and hefting the lettuce argue over the possible score.
	   The McDonalds at the old port offers a World Cup special for 59
francs, about 10 dollars: a Big Mac, fries, a drink, and an ``OM''
scarf.
	   Local radio stations drone on about teams and their chances. If
South Africa does well, one notes, it would be no surprise. The
coach is Philippe Troussier, a Frenchman.
	   Fans that they are, the Marseillais seemed to appreciate the
joyous zeal South Africans brought to their streets.
	   Sam Tsatsi spent dlrs 3,000 he could not easily afford to fly up
for the Cup. As he sang, ``Bafana, Bafana,'' a Frenchman painted up
in blue, red and white chimed in with, ``Allez la France.''
	   ``My team will win,'' Tsatsi informed the man. ``Non,'' the man
replied. They smiled widely and separated, each certain he was
right.
	   Nearby, four South Africans ate a late lunch and discussed their
chances.
	   ``This our first World Cup since we rejoined the world,'' said
Clifford Collings, who works in the Paris embassy of what many call
the new South Africa. ``We'll be doing our best.''
	   Yusuf Randera-Rees, 15, added, ``We'd better.'' He used his
mother's frequent flyer miles to come up from Johannesburg.
	   But this was still Marseille.
	   ``We'll kill them, the poor guys,'' said Rene Raynaud, a
salesman, who had scored rare match tickets for two Caribbean
friends from the French island of Guadaloupe.
	   Raynaud threw an arm around Dominique Capanel and added. ``I
haven't seen my old pals in years. What better occasion can you
imagine?''

	   SHAH ALAM, Wed. - Menteri Besar Datuk Abu Hassan Omar today
urged the Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry and the
Registrar of Societies to review the status of the Federation of
Malaysian Consumers Associations and the Selangor Consumers
Association.
	   He said their status should be reviewed as their recent actions
were similar to that of political parties rather than consumers
bodies.
	   ``The associations, it seems, are more interested in
politicising the water crisis rather than working with the
authorities to find ways to help consumers.
	   ``This is proven when they work hand in glove with the
opposition parties,'' he told reporters after chairing the weekly
Exco meeting.
	   Abu Hassan was responding to a report quoting the Selangor
Consumers Association's legal advisor A. Jayaseelan as saying at a
Press conference that the association planned to sue the Selangor
State Government and the Menteri Besar for allegedly being
negligent in managing water resources and denying the people a
steady supply of water.
	   Fomca secretary-general N. Marimuthu, DAP secretary-general Lim
Kit Siang, Pas MP for Kubang Kerian Mohamad Sabu, Parti Rakyat
Malaysia secretary-general G. Rajasekaran and representatives of 29
NGOs were also at the Press conference.
	   Today, Abu Hassan said he had directed State Legal Adviser
Ahmadi Asnawi to study the matter and advised the association not
to proceed with its signature drive as it would only confuse the
public.
	   The Menteri Besar said he was shocked when he read the report on
the planned suit as Fomca, being the umbrella body for consumer
associations, had indicated it was satisfied with the explanation
on water resource management given by the Selangor Waterworks
Department at a meeting on June 2.
	   Besides that, he said, the State Government had announced its
plan to hold a briefing on the matter for all State assemblymen,
party leaders and representatives of non-governmental organisations
on June 25.
	   He said the State Government had so far spent RM14 million to
rent tankers and to finance various programmes to ensure enough
water supply for consumers.
	   Abu Hassan said he would also announce during the briefing,
other investments to improve water supply for Selangor and the
Federal Territory.

World Cup: Will Norway's British style help against Scotland?
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEPHAN NASSTROM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LA BAULE, France (AP) _ Eleven of Norway's 22 World Cup players
compete in England. The first coach that had an influence on
Norway's manager Egil ``Drillo'' Olsen's was British.
	   No wonder many people say Norway plays British-style soccer.
	   ``My influence very early was George Curtis, who came to Norway
and coached,'' Olsen recalled. ``I started to think more
systematically after seeing him. Then we didn't know about zone
defense at all.''
	   Another British friend is Richard Pollard, who now coaches
college soccer in the United States. He scouted for Olsen when
Scotland _ Norway's next opponent in Group A _ drew 0-0 in an
exhibition against the United States May 30 at RFK Stadium in
Washington D.C.
	   ``I got a report from him,'' Olsen said.
	   Soccer may be an art and not science ``but science will also
influence football,'' said Olsen, who spends hours studying his own
players and opponents on video.
	   He probably is right. Since taking over as head coach in 1990,
Olsen's style has helped the Norwegians to 42 wins, 23 draws and 15
losses in 80 matches. They're unbeaten in their last 15 games,
including a 2-2 draw against Morocco in their World Cup opener
Wednesday.
	   So how does Olsen explain the success of a team that went
unbeaten through its qualifying campaign and beat fellow World Cup
sides Denmark, Mexico and Saudi Arabia by a combined 13-2 in its
last three exhibitions before the World Cup?
	   ``We have fighting spirit ... we've worked hard with the young
talents for years and in my opinion our (long-ball) style is the
most effective,'' Olsen said.
	   ``That's why I believe in it. I was criticized because I said
that if I coached Brazil they would be even better. Of course I
believe in the style. I think our style is also better for others.
It's not only suitable for Norway.''
	   Brazil will be looking for revenge in the last Group A match
June 23 against Norway in Marseille.
	   Ronaldo and company lost a friendly 4-2 a year ago in Oslo with
Tore Andre Flo scoring twice. That's when the tall Chelsea striker
earned his nickname ``Flonaldo''.
	   Olsen liked what he saw in the last 35 minutes of the opener in
Montpellier against Morocco.
	   ``We played very well ... in fact, we had the last five goal
chances in the match,'' he said.
	   Stig Inge Bjornebye, one of Norway's key defenders who set up
Dan Eggen's equalizer with a free kick, was optimistic going into
Tuesday's match with Scotland in Bordeaux.
	   ``I think we have a pretty good chance of making the second
round,'' the Liverpool star said. ``The atmosphere in the squad was
very good after the draw.

	   A WIDE selection of Dutch printmaking techniques is on display
until tomorrow at the National Art Gallery.
	   Dubbed Graphic Art Now, the more than 200 works through various
processes are taken mainly from last year's seventh edition of the
Graphic Art Now exhibition at the Singer Museum in Laren, Holland,
initiated by two art galleries in Amsterdam, Petit and
Clement/Printshop.
	   Versatile though they are, prints are very much a technique
thing, which could be decisive in the creation of the intended
lines (depth, intensity, pattern, form), images (configuration and
abstract or in-between), tone, colour and texture.
	   Because the employed technique tends to have a homogenising
effect on the end image, the cult of nationality is often a futile
exercise here.
	   Exceptions there are, of course; in Japanese woodcuts and
ukiyo-e prints, for example, and in the stark imagery of German
Expressionism.
	   Printmaking has evolved over several hundred years to allow
greater flexibility, innovation and a multiplicity of subject
matters.
	   Prints are narrative elements or drawings, or even studies or
``reproductions'' of paintings, or mere diversions. They can be
done by printmaking exponents and have been done by famous artists
from Delacroix to Lautrec to Picasso.
	   Themes range from the detailed mythical dramas of Albrecht Durer
to the political satires of Daumier.
	   In Dutch graphics, Rembrandt van Rijn (1609-1669) has few peers.
His etchings are believed by some to have as overpowering an effect
as the play of light and shadow in his oils.
	   The Dutch printmaking tradition dates from the Renaissance, with
engravers like Lucas van Leyden (1494-1533) with his landscapes and
interiors. Other well-known Dutch printmakers include Ferdinand Bol
(1616- 1680), Adriaen van Ostade (1610-1685) and Anthony Waterloo
(1609-1676).
	   This exhibition of contemporary Dutch creations encompasses both
the serious and the frivolous.
	   For simplicity, few can match the Minimalist, frail, coloured
frames of Eric de Nie's etching, Jan Baas's lithography with its
dominant mass of green, the precarious stack of Petra Dolleman's
silkscreen, the broken calligraphic lines of Adri Grigge's etching,
or the configurations in Leo Huijg's woodcut.
	   For fidelity to more complex prints, the landscape etchings of
Hans van Hagen, Reiner Homan, Wim van der Meijetching and Philip
Wiesman contrast sharply with Nicholaas Wijnberg's delicate
still-life and the Mother and Child theme in Lies van Vlijmen's
Portrait.
	   The artists have cast their eyes further afield - to Asia, with
Jacomijn den Engelson's depiction of Buddha's hands and feet in
woodcut, and Ton Diekstra's ``crumbling'' effect in his etching,
Thai Ruins; Ton de Laat strikes a more sombre, almost reverential,
tone in his etching of the Prambahan temple palace in Java.
	   For sheer magnificent panorama, achieved in a small print, Hans
Dolieslager's silkscreen, Summer Field, is a visual delight. And
Diana van Hal's woodcut landscape presents an interesting
topographical flatness.
	   For composition and perspective, there's Laetitia de Haas'
etching of an entrance facing the sea.
	   Strong colour contrast is also evident in Dianne Bakker's
longish woodcut, with the red, dotted dress of her subject set
against a vast brown curtain which blends with her auburn hair.
	   Marli Turion works in digital prints, reminiscent of the
collages of the late Ismail Zain.
	   This is the second time an exhibition of Dutch graphics, culled
from the biennial show, is at the NAG, the previous one having been
in October and November 1995.
	   The exhibition will be in Penang at the Universiti Sains
Malaysia's Museum and Art Gallery from June 25 to July 11.
	   It has toured Singapore, Bangkok, Jakarta, Ho Chi Minh City and
New Delhi, and the next stop is South Africa.
	   Two Malaysian printmakers will conduct a workshop on different
graphic techniques at the centre on Saturday (9am - noon).

takes place. There is a certain aura about it which makes it stand
out from among the rest of the buildings.
	   Sheikh Abdul Aziz Kamel, an eminent architect and researcher of
Islamic arts and architecture, explains that the sight of a mosque,
built in reverence and love for God, ``the Creator, the Cherisher
and Sustainer of the worlds, gives comfort to the eyes and the
spirit, because it speaks the language of the soul''. Only
traditional artists and craftsmen are able to build such buildings.
Kamel says that the Islamic world is a treasure throve of
magnificent mosques and palaces symbolishing a rich and humane
civilisation.
	   He commented that the skills of the traditional Muslim artists
and craftsmen that go into building them are still out there but
unfortunately most are now wasting away their lives making
souvenirs for tourists.
	   These traditional artists and craftsmen have the potential and
capabilities not only to design and build mosques and palaces but
also towns, streets, open spaces for gardens, market places and
farms.
	   He says that for too long Muslims have neglected their
inheritance and if they persist they will lose it forever.
	   The testimony to their unique skills are still preserved
throughout the world from Bosnia right across to the vast expanse
of China.
	   In Turkey, Egypt, Iran, Morocco, Pakistan, Uzbekistan, Spain,
Indonesia and Saudi Arabia, we can still see the proud heritage
standing as evidence of the creative genius of the people inspired
by their faith.
	   The examples are abundant, says Kamel, and to name a few, they
are the Alhambra Palace in Andalucia, the buildings of old Cairo,
the mosques of Istanbul, the Niuje mosque in Beijing and, as
acknowledged the most beautiful architectural piece of monument
ever built, the Taj Mahal. The list goes on.
	   Kamel is the only architect at present who has taken it upon
himself to promote and develop the use of traditional Muslim arts
and crafts in the building and the handicraft industry.
	   He says that the process of development of the tradition ceased
with the arrival of the colonialists but now since we are no longer
subjected to their alien rule, Muslims should be encouraged to
revitalise the traditional handicraft industries and modernise them
to suit the present times.
	   Islam is a progressive religion. It does not reject everything
that is foreign but it teaches man ``to enjoin all that is right
and good and forbid all that is wrong and evil.''
	   Though there is no denying that the Muslim nations have
benefited to some extent from the colonialists they have lost much
more in return.
	   For one thing, the sense of humanitarianism has been very much
impaired by the modern demands of consumerism. Consumerism, by its
very nature, is wasteful especially since it has now taken a step
further in promoting the use of disposable consumer products that
are non-biodegradable. This has far reaching implications on the
environment.
	   Middle-aged people and above can still remember the days when
the water was pure, the air clean and the food fresh. The people
were caring and they had more character and individuality. This is
what happiness is all about - to be able to enjoy one's company and
surroundings and feel contented.
	   Kamel is championing the cause of bringing back the Muslim
architectural and handicraft industry to the fore in order to
protect and preserve the environment from the cruel infliction
suffered at the hands of misused technology.
	   He emphasised that the handicraft industry will change the whole
cultural landscape of the towns and instill in people an awareness
of their heritage and tradition.
	   People will cherish the things they own that are handcrafted and
this attitude will be a strong factor in restraining man and help
him to preserve and maintain the delicate balance in the ecosystem.
	   Wouldn't you like to own a beautiful hand-crafted piece of
furniture which you can pass on to your children as a family
heirloom and they to theirs knowing that it is one of its kind?
	   Or do you want a factory-made ``mahogany'', and when the time
comes, you throw it away and buy yet another piece of ``mahogany''
from the so-called ``latest collections''?
	   It may be called ``mahogany'' but it is only a veneer, a
delusion like everything else in the modern world of mass
production. Think about it.
	   When we buy the mass-produced furniture, we are an accomplice to
a crime - the crime of deforestation, the crime of destroying
thousands of animal and plant species, and the crime of persistent
pollution of the environment.
	   During the Caliphate, the artists and craftsmen had a great deal
of influence on the growth and development of the traditional urban
society of the Muslim world.
	   The seed of the concept of Muslim downtown was first planted
when Prophet Mohammed identified a spot for a market place and a
mosque when he went to Al-Madinah Al-Munawarah to establish the
first Muslim community, says Kamel, during his lecture at the
conference on ``Art and Architecture in the Muslim World'', held in
Shah Alam last year.
	   This set the blueprint for the future shape of development of
the Muslim towns to serve the spiritual and material need of the
people.
	   Commerce and spiritual life go hand in hand in the Islamic way
of life.
	   Islam reached Malaysia and Indonesia by way of commerce.
	   Kamel observed that during the Golden Ages of Islamic
civilisation, the just and pious rule of the caliphs provided the
ideal conditions for the people to achieve the greatest
accomplishment in the arts, architecture, the sciences,
philosophies and mathematics.
	   Furthermore, they were the premier patrons of the arts and
sciences. The successive Caliphs governed with varying degrees of
understanding of the relationship between the spiritual world and
the material world and the importance of continued economic
prosperity.
	   Everybody benefited from this including non-Muslims who lived in
peace and harmony with the Muslims and enjoyed a life of freedom
and equal opportunities.
	   Kamel strongly feels that mimicking the West and its lifestyle
is unnatural and it is causing chaos to both society and the
environment.
	   According to him, the western concepts of town planning divides
the town into zones.
	   There is the industrial zone, commercial zone, residential zone
and recreational zone. This is the main contributing factor to the
stress people are faced with now.
	   In a modern metropolis, people spend a great deal of time to
travel to and from work everyday. The lifestyle is the direct cause
of increasing demands for cars and the subsequent massive traffic
jams choking up the highways.
	   ``Modern cities,'' says Kamel, ``are constructed from glass,
concrete and steel structures with their main consideration only
for cars and other fast transportation to move man. Humans are
secondary. The structures are cold and sterile, a good breeding
ground for all the social ills.
	   ``In these surroundings, Man is made to feel insignificant and
he is perpetually on edge. He is psychologically restless and
impatient without understanding why. In the evening most of the
downtown is dead, because people want to get away as quickly as
they can to the comfort of their home. Modern cities are not
people-friendly.''
	   Kamel feels that the effects can be softened with a little human
touch.
	   The human touch can be applied with various natural elements,
like wood, wrought iron, copper, brass, natural floral tiles and
stucco-coloured glass.
	   All it takes is the skill of the traditional Muslim artists and
craftsmen.
	   Kamel says that the buildings that man build asserts an
imperceptible influence on the spirit of the people.
	   Man may build buildings but it is the buildings that build the
soul of the children and the children's children, he says.
	   Traditional Muslim artists and craftsmen considered the effect
of sight on the human soul. They believed that the quickest way to
remove stress is through what the eyes perceive. People feel
comfortable with arches, domes and pillars decorated with human
elements as they can relate it to the elements of nature that they
represent.
	   In Islam, art is functional. Everything man uses in his daily
life is art, says Kamel.
	   Utensils, vases, carpets, the copper lamp, even the design of
the Quran is a work of art. These designs in turn have a great
influence on the artists and architects who used them on the
ornaments on the ceilings, walls and other areas.
	   One of the most important features of a traditional Muslim home
is the privacy of the family. The home must be airy and comfortable
and the women's modesty protected.
	   The concept of courtyard grew out of this and to keep the home
cool in the daytime, the wind direction and the movement of the sun
are taken into consideration before the house is designed.
	   The art of Mashrabiah, the wooden lattices, was developed to
serve as a protection of woman's modesty. It is like a veil: people
can't see the face but they can be seen clearly.
	   Mashrabiah is used for the windows or partition indoors. It is
designed in such a way that it keeps the home airy. It is one of
the most advanced art forms; in fact, it is a philosophy.
	   Central in the tradition of the Muslim arts and architecture is
the institution of the Mu'almeen, the master craftsman. The
tradition goes back more than a thousand years.
	   In a traditional Muslim society, says Kamel, art is everything
that is made by the sensitive hands of the craftsmen who are very
much respected.
	   As the Islamic influences spread so did the creative influence
of the artists and craftsmen.
	   The towns grew according to the dictates of the Islamic way of
life. The origin of the Muslim architecture may have its roots in
Arabia but the style varies from country to country, says Kamel.
	   This tradition was perpetuated by the highly refined institution
of Mu'almeen. The Mu'almeen are the equivalent of the modern-day
architects.
	   The Mu'almeen also followed a strict scientific building code
which reflected the Islamic social values and its obligatory
duties, says Kamel.
	   This resulted in the existence of an urban fabric which
preserved the psychological well-being of the town dwellers. It
also holds true for the preservation of the environment.
	   The Mu'almeen had many apprentices. The greatest accomplishments
in Muslim architecture today bears testimony of the superior skills
of the Mu'almeen.
	   The Mu'almeen used the local craftsmen and local building
materials. For this reason, the mosques and other buildings were
constructed with the same principles and methods but they had a
flavour of its own.
	   The mosques in Tunisia and Turkey, for instance, have their own
unique identities, says Kamel.
	   In China, though the Chinese philosophy and culture may appear
worlds apart from Islam yet Islamic belief took root there by
merging gently and harmoniously with the Chinese philosophy and
culture.
	   It is a clear evidence of the universal appeal of Islam and it
can be seen in the shape of the mosques which are a beautiful blend
of Chinese and Muslim architectural elements.
	   Islamic art and architecture are not only confined to building
mosques and palaces but also homes, markets, streets, open spaces
for gardens and farms. The concept of township in Islam is based on
man's unity with his environment.
	   Town centres in traditional Muslim cities are made for
pedestrians. In England, more and more city centres are restricted
only for pedestrians.
	   The pedestrian malls are spruced with trees and plants and
benches for people to sit. This new concept is coming close to the
Muslim concept except it is devoid of spirituality which the mosque
provides.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Wed. - The Australian-based Asean Protective
Services agency will not proceed with legal action against a
Sarawakian MP who owed the Burswood International Resort casino in
Perth RM4.8 million.
	   This agreement was reached after the politician had promised to
pay the debt in instalments.
	   Agency director Christopher White said, however, it will proceed
with legal action against six other Malaysians who owed the casino
some RM2.4 million.
	   ``We have decided not to proceed with legal action against the
Sarawakian MP as we have reached a commercial settlement,'' he said
when contacted.
	   The MP is a senior member of the Parti Bangsa Dayak Sarawak.
	   Yesterday, the MP made a RM50,000 first payment to the agency,
which was engaged by the casino to recover debts, and pledged to
settle the remaining sum by the end of the year.
	   The payment was made by telegraphic transfer through a bank in
Perth.
	   The agency has received the money.
	   ``We have got no further interest in the MP's case as he has
promised to pay the amount in due course,'' he said.
	   White said a Klang-based lawyer who owed the casino RM500,000
has also worked out a repayment scheme to settle his debts.
	   The MP and the lawyer were among eight Malaysians who had been
threatened with legal action by Burswood to recover gambling debts
totalling some RM8 million.
	   However, White said the agency will serve writs to the six
others who owed the casino RM2.4 million.
	   ``We will serve the writs to the six within this month.
	   ``We have no other choice as they have not come forward to seek
a compromise,'' he said.
	   He said three were from Selangor and the others from Johor.
	   He said the six had debts with the casino dating back one to
three years.

Thousands flee Guinea-Bissau as government, rebels exchange fire

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Tens of thousands of people fled the
former Portuguese colony of Guinea-Bissau on Friday as government
troops fought renegade soldiers who launched a coup attempt,
according to reports.
	   As many as 40,000 people in the West African nation were heading
on foot along the road to the northern border with Senegal, a
Portuguese journalist in the area said, citing local reports.
	   Senegal closed the border on Thursday while medical teams were
dispatched to vaccinate the refugees against yellow fever and
meningitis before they were allowed into the country, Pedro Rosa
Mendes told Portuguese state radio Antena 1.
	   Government troops, supported by soldiers from neighboring
Senegal and the Republic of Guinea, meanwhile maintained their
siege of a military garrison in a northern suburb of the capital
Bissau, where an unknown number of rebels have been holed up since
their attempted powergrab on Sunday.
	   A spokesman for the Portuguese prime minister's office, who was
in contact with the Portuguese embassy in Bissau, said sporadic
shelling and automatic weapons fire could be heard in the capital
throughout the day.
	   ``It's a very unstable situation. We're not sure who's
winning,'' the spokesman said on customary condition of anonymity,
adding that the embassy had been hit by several stray shells.
	   The French embassy was hit by a bazooka shell but no one was
injured, the Portuguese news agency Lusa reported, citing
diplomatic sources in Dakar, Senegal.
	   Portuguese residents in Bafata, the country's second-largest
city, 140 kilometers (90 miles) to the east of Bissau, told Lusa
there was no military activity in the area.
	   The president of the National Assembly, Malan Sanha, said
representatives from Muslim and Catholic associations had allied
with lawmakers to propose talks, Lusa reported.
	   The two sides had ``demonstrated interest'' in holding talks,
Sanha was quoted as saying by Lusa, although he declined to provide
further details.
	   President Joao Bernardo Vieira was reluctant to enter talks and
was confident in his ability to defeat the rebels militarily,
according to an unidentified western diplomat quoted by Lusa.
	   More than 2,200 people, mostly foreigners, were evacuated from
Bissau on a Portuguese merchant ship Thursday.
	   Vitor Duque, an official of the shipping company that provided
the vessel told Antena 1 that the passengers were packed on the
deck. The huge container ship was designed to hold only 18 people.
	   The ship was due to arrive in Dakar at about 5 p.m. (1700 GMT),
Duque said.
	   A Portuguese frigate was expected to arrive in Guinea-Bissau on
Sunday to oversee the evacuation of other foreigners, diplomats
said.
	   Portuguese phone company Marconi said international phone lines
apparently had been cut in Bissau, making contact impossible.
	   The rebels are led by former armed forces chief Brig. Ansumane
Mane, who was fired in January amid allegations he was involved in
smuggling arms to rebels in Senegal. He has accused Vieira of
corruption and called on him to step down so that early elections
can be held.
	   Vieira himself came to power in a 1980 coup. He was elected in
the country's first democratic elections for president and
parliament four years ago.

Major powers deny loans to India, Pakistan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with details from news conference, other
details. &QL; 
 &UR; With NATO-Kosovo &QL; 
 &UR; By BARRY SCHWEID &QC; 
 &UR; AP Diplomatic Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The world's leading industrial nations, acting on
a U.S. proposal, decided Friday to deny nonhumanitarian loans to
India and Pakistan in retaliation for their nuclear tests.
	   The action came at a meeting of Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright and seven foreign ministers on the nuclear crisis in South
Asia and ethnic turmoil in Kosovo.
	   A communique approved by the eight countries _ the United
States, Britain, France, Germany, Japan, Canada, Italy and Russia _
also urged India and Pakistan to halt their testing programs and
not to deploy nuclear weapons on their missiles.
	   Additionally, they were urged to deal with the ``root causes''
of tensions between them, especially over Kashmir, the mostly
Muslim enclave that straddles their border.
	   Albright also urged the other nations to refrain from nuclear
cooperation with India and Pakistan. The senior U.S. officials,
speaking on condition of anonymity, said the two countries would be
denied such help.
	   The joint steps were taken as India and Pakistan faltered in
moves to hold negotiations later in the month. Senior British and
American officials said the effort had collapsed in disagreements
over how to proceed.
	   ``The recent nuclear tests have created an atmosphere of
regional instability which will undermine the region's
attractiveness to both foreign and domestic investment, damaging
business confidence and the prospect for economic growth,'' the
communique said.
	   The United States has imposed economic sanctions, under U.S.
law, against both countries. The eight foreign ministers, as a
group, said all countries ``should act as they see fit to
demonstrate their displeasure and address their concerns to India
and Pakistan.''
	   ``Our meeting sends the message that the world community is
united not just in outrage and dismay but in action,'' Albright
said, referring to nuclear weapons tests conducted last month by
the two countries.
	   The eight nations, four of whom are nuclear powers, pledged
themselves to ``systematic and progressive efforts to reduce
nuclear weapons globally with the ultimate goal of eliminating
those weapons.'' A Japanese foreign ministry official said the
pledge was the result of pressure by his government.
	   By choosing to test, India and Pakistan have diminished their
security and damaged their prestige, Albright said at a meeting
with the foreign ministers.
	   Calling for unity, Albright said relations with India and
Pakistan ``must not drift back into business as usual.'' One way
she proposed was coordinating votes at world financial institutions
to postpone consideration of loans except for those ``that meet
basic human needs.''
	   Last week, the World Bank postponed two loans worth more than
dlrs 206 million to India, bringing to more than dlrs 1 billion the
amount delayed because of the South Asian nation's nuclear tests
last month.
	   The South Asian nuclear crisis competed with the ethnic
bloodshed in the Balkans for the attention of the foreign
ministers.
	   They called on Yugoslavia to let up its military pressure on
ethnic Albanians in Kosovo and ``make rapid progress'' in talks
with their leaders.
	   The nations said they would move to ban flights of commercial
Yugoslav airlines to and from their countries and Japan said it
would consider going along.
	   ``There must be a clear timetable for rapid progress,'' they
said, insisting that the fighting stop and effective talks begin at
once. It pinned special responsibility on Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic to ensure that steps are taken to achieve a
political solution.''
	   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, who chaired the meeting on
Kosovo, said war criminals in the conflict would be subject to the
tribunal in The Hague that is investigating ethnic blood-letting in
Bosnia, Croatia and Serbia. Cooke said the ministers recognized
that Milosevic could not immediately order a cease-fire, withdraw
Serbian forces, permit international inspection and ease the way
for refugees.
	   ``But,'' Cooke said, ``the Yugoslav president can make a start''
and should begin to fulfill the demand immediately.
	   Referring to delay by the allies in taking action in Bosnia,
Cooke said, ``Preisdent Milsoevic will be making a grave mistake if
he thinks the international community will be as slow to respond in
Kosovo as he was in Bosnia .''
	   Milosevic is testing the will of the international community
with his suppression of ethnic Albanians who account for nearly 90
percent of the population of the Serbian province of Kosovo.
	   NATO defense ministers agreed Thursday in Brussels on air
exercises over Albania and Macedonia in the next few days to warn
Yugoslavia against further attacks in Kosovo.
	   To add moral pressure, foreign ministers from Argentina, Brazil,
South Africa and Ukraine, all of whom have given up the nuclear
option, joined the others at a luncheon discussion intended to
persuade India and Pakistan to heed world opinion.
	   On hand, too, were ambassadors of the Philippines and China, the
Philippines designated to spread the word to the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations.

	   ROME (AP) _ Sophia Loren and Oscar-winning director Michelangelo
Antonioni are planning a movie together, news reports said on
Friday.
	   ``It's an extraordinary role written especially for me,'' the
Italian actress was quoted by the ANSA news agency as saying.
	   ``You can't be sure until the first take,'' said Loren during a
visit to Rome. ``But it's an extraordinary project and I'll work
hard to get it done.''
	   The movie has the working title of ``Verna,'' Loren said.
	   The 85-year-old Antonioni, who directed ``Blow Up,'' ``Zabriskie
Point,'' and ``The Passenger'' has been hampered by the effects of
a stroke in recent years.
	   He last directed a movie in 1994, and won a lifetime Oscar award
in 1995.

German love affair with football helps NFL Europe's World Bowl
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROY KAMMERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ No one symbolizes the Germans' love
affair with American football like 48-year-old Rhein Fire place
kicker Manny Burgsmueller.
	   Burgsmueller, a former German soccer great, passed the legendary
George Blanda this season as the oldest man ever to play pro
football.
	   ``The game is fascinating _ like a chess match,'' said
Burgsmueller, a few months older than Blanda when he retired.
	   Burgsmueller leads the Duesseldorf Rhein Fire against German
rival Frankfurt Galaxy in Sunday's World Bowl _ the championship
game of the NFL Europe league.
	   League officials predict a sellout of 50,000, quite an
accomplishment during the middle of soccer's World Cup.
	   The two clubs' regular season meetings both topped 40,000 in
attendance. They are also 1-2 in league attendance, with Frankfurt
averaging 34,202 and Duesseldorf 25,448.
	   ``Football is booming in Germany,'' said Rhein Fire spokesman
Gerald Meier. ``There's millions of Germans that like the American
way of life and football is a part of that.''
	   But if the NFL and Fox, joint owners of NFL Europe, can
celebrate their success in Germany, a look elsewhere around the
league brings a hard reality check.
	   The England Monarchs drew a dismal 5,944 fans per game, while
neither the Barcelona Dragons or Scottish Claymores could crack
10,000.
	   That's one reason why NFL owners and Fox officials will meet in
Frankfurt this week to determine the future of the league.
	   One thing is clear: Either Barcelona, Scotland or the English
franchise will be scrapped and replaced next season in the six-team
league by a new club in Berlin.
	   ``We're having incredible success in Germany,'' said NFL Europe
president Oliver Luck, a former Houston Oilers quarterback. ``And
we have to ask ourselves, can we continue to support a franchise
that tops out at 10,000, if that's all the market will give us?''
	   Soccer is so dominant in Europe that in most countries there
really isn't a No. 2 sport. Many people believe that's one reason
football has caught on in Germany.
	   ``The most popular sports are soccer, soccer, followed by indoor
soccer. But after that, in team sports, there is a huge gap,'' Luck
said.
	   The lone exception is the British Isles, where football has
failed to compete with a variety of sports as well as soccer.
	   ``A typical statement from the Brits is we have our rugby, our
cricket, our snooker _ there are very few disengaged fans,'' Luck
said.
	   NFL Europe also admits to mistakes in Barcelona, England and
Scotland, with too many management switches and a failure to build
local identification with the clubs.
	   The two German teams, on the other hand, have a reputation for
saavy promotion. Rhein Fire, for example, drew media attention
across the country by advertising on manhole covers.
	   But the team's most successful PR move was signing up the then
46-year-old Burgsmueller three years ago, giving the fledgling club
and the sport some badly needed name recognition.
	   Burgsmueller is German soccer's fourth all-time leading scorer
with 213 goals. He's also loved by the country's working-class fans
for his hard-nosed style.
	   But the ex-forward has surprised everyone by becoming a vital
weapon in the team's offense.
	   Burgsmueller was the league's leading scorer this season with 57
points, making all 21 PATs and going 12 for 13 in field goal
attempts.
	   He admits that, three years ago, he didn't know the first thing
about the American game.
	   ``I said from the start I would need to perform well for this to
work,'' Burgsmueller said. ``But this just proves that even at an
advanced age, if you set your mind to it, you can succeed at a new
sport.''

	   IPOH, Wed. - Police arrested four men, an hour after they had
allegedly grabbed an undisclosed amount of money from an electrical
shop in Jalan Labrooy today.
	   A police party picked up the men while they were having drinks
at a roadside stall about 12.30pm.
	   An imitation police pistol, believed to have been used in the
robbery, was seized from one of them.
	   Prior to the arrest, the police had seized a taxi - believed to
have been used as a getaway vehicle following the robbery - which
was found abandoned in Jalan Kuala Kangsar.
	   Police are checking if two of the men were involved in robbing a
clinic of RM450, two gold chains and two rings, in Pasir Putih
yesterday.
	   In this morning's incident, two men, one carrying a ``pistol'',
walked into the electrical shop, held up an employee and fled with
an undislosed amount of money.

Albanian militants kill Serb policemen near Kosovo capital
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs. UPDATES with Contact Group members weighing JAT flight
ban; Kosovo Albanians welcoming NATO moves, Serbs alternately
gloomy and critical. &QL; 
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Ethnic Albanian militants, boldly
stepping up their attacks, killed two Serb policemen just a few
miles from Kosovo's capital and on Friday said they command 15,000
fighters across the secessionist province.
	   Fighting between Serbian forces and the militants erupted again
in the Decani region in western Kosovo, close to the border with
Albania. It was a Serbian offensive there last week that prompted
NATO Thursday to announce a show of air power to persuade Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic to halt such assault.
	   Ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs nine-to-one in Kosovo. Most
seek independence from Serbia, which in 1989 stripped the province
of broad autonomy and has ruled repressively since. More than 250
people have been killed since Serbian police started a crackdown
against Albanian militants in March.
	   Ethnic Albanian sources claimed that six villages in the Decani
area were under attack Friday, including from grenade launchers
normally issued to the Yugoslav army.
	   There was no independent confirmation of their report, but the
state-run Tanjug news agency in Belgrade reported that a Serb
policeman was seriously hurt in what it called an attack by ``armed
Albanian terrorists'' near one of the villages, Prilep.
	   Serb sources in the province said two policemen where killed and
one was seriously wounded in an overnight ambush by separatists
near Obilic, just 7 kilometers (4.3 miles) northwest of the
provincial capital Pristina. Ethnic Albanian sources claimed one
Albanian was wounded in the same incident.
	   According to other information reaching Pristina, separatists
control a stretch of road near Suva Reka, 40 kilometers (25 miles)
southwest of the capital, severing its link to the key trading town
of Prizren near the Albanian border.
	   Albanian sources further reported Serb attacks on villages in
the Obilic and adjacent Vucitrn regions, saying residents fled and
spent the night under open skies.
	   The ethnic Albanian daily Bujku reported Friday five ethnic
Albanians and seven Serbs were killed in clashes Thursday in Suvo
Grlo in the Drenica area 30 kilometers (20 miles) west of Pristina.
	   Bujku said the fighting was fierce, with villagers determined to
``resist to the end with the help of the KLA.''
	   NATO is planning simulated air attacks in Albania and Macedonia,
adjoining Kosovo, to try and persuade Milosevic to halt military
action.
	   On Friday, Western foreign ministers met in London with their
Russian counterpart to step up pressure. Britain, which is weighing
a United Nations' move to back use of NATO force in Kosovo, called
on Milosevic to pull back his troops immediately.
	   The United States, Canada, Britain, France, Italy and Germany
also said they would ``take steps to ban'' flights by Yugoslav
Airlines to underline their concern at the Kosovo violence, British
Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said.
	   Kosovo Albanians welcomed the NATO moves. It's ``high time''
that someone strikes against Milosevic, which nobody in former
Yugoslavia proved able to do, said Eroll Haxhiu, 46, selling
jewelry in Pristina market. ``America can and should do it.''
	   ``As we already saw in Bosnia, Milosevic only respects the use
of force,'' said Agron Musaraj, 23, a law student.
	   Members of Kosovo's Serb minority _ whom Milosevic promised to
protect when taking power in Serbia in 1987 _ were alternately
gloomy and defiant.
	   Leaders ``ruined the good country we had (old Yugoslavia), and
they will ruin this one too,'' said Vasilje Stefanovic, a pensioner
from Prizren. ``We are to blame for everything that is happening.
We deserve it.''
	   ``If they attack us, they'll be attacking a sovereign country,''
said Jovan Banjanin, 40, who declined to state his occupation. ``We
will have to defend ourselves, and this has nothing to do with the
Albanian issue.''
	   Ethnic Albanian media in Kosovo on Friday carried a statement
from the Kosovo Liberation Army _ the main militant group _
demanding that it be given a new war tax to be levied on Kosovo
Albanians working abroad to fund the fight against the Serbs.
	   The KLA, a shadowy group which first emerged in 1996 and whose
leader or commanders are still unknown, also said it now had about
15,000 fighters province-wide and named a spokesman it said could
avoid false statements being made in the KLA name.
	   The spokesman was identified as Jakup Krasniqi, a teacher from a
village in the Drenica region.

Tyrell boss gets fitting retirement present
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GOODWOOD, England (AP) _ Tyrell Grand Prix boss Ken Tyrell
received a fitting retirement present Friday, when his
grandchildren re-acquired the Formula One car Jackie Stewart drove
to the 1970 championship.
	   Two of Tyrell's grandchildren paid 73,000 pounds (dlrs 119,720)
at auction for the first Tyrell-Cosworth Formula One car produced
for the Scottish driver.
	   Adrian Tyrell, 28, and his cousin, Claire, said they had paid a
reasonable price for the car which launched Stewart on a string of
wins in the early 1970s.
	   ``In fact it was not as much as we expected and I have got
something I really wanted,'' Adrian said.
	   Ken Tyrell said: ``I'm delighted the car is staying in the
family. I think it would be sad if it had gone abroad.''

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Wed. - Police have crippled an international
syndicate believed to have used counterfeit credit cards to rake in
about RM15 million in cash and goods, with the arrest of 10 people
in the Klang Valley, early this week.
	   Initial investigations revealed that the gang members had been
operating for about five years with established ``links'' in Hong
Kong, Thailand, Australia, Japan and European countries.
	   Among those detained in a series of raids on Monday were the
syndicate's suspected mastermind, a woman, and at least two men
believed to have been picked up by police earlier, for similar
offences.
	   Police have obtained remand orders to detain the 10 - who were
arrested in Wangsa Maju, Ampang and Old Klang Road - to facilitate
their probe.
	   Also seized were several hundred counterfeit credit cards, an
assortment of equipment and related paraphernalia used to produce
plastic cards and emboss the relevant particulars and data on them.
	   The arrests followed weeks of intensive surveillance by a team
of officers from the Commercial Crime branch of the Federal police
headquarters in Bukit Aman.
	   The New Straits Times understands that most victims of the
fraudulant transactions were merchants of outlets which had
unknowingly accepted the counterfeit credit cards in Japan, apart
from those in Hong Kong, Australia and some countries in Europe.
	   A source said: ``Members of the gang do not stay at one place to
operate their counterfeit trade. They are known to use several
make-shift operations centres in the Klang Valley to avoid police
detection.
	   ``It is at these centres that the gang is known to have used an
assortment of equipment to produce blank cards before embossing and
encoding the names and relevant data of genuine card holders.
	   ``The data which the gang had obtained is believed to have been
duplicated at high-risk outlets where owners lose sight of their
credit cards during transactions for payment of goods or for other
services.''
	   The source said that apart from the purchase of goods, the gang
members had also made cash withdrawals through automated teller
machines in Malaysia and overseas.
	   In Monday's operation, the police team which had split into
groups raided several areas in the Klang Valley to make the
arrests.
	   In one of the raids, police arrested six people after a search
of a flat in Taman Wangsa Maju - believed to have been the gang's
most recent operation centre.
	   Fax machines, embossing machines and several hundred counterfeit
credit cards were also seized from the flat.

Report says Haitians who died in capsized boat were not shot
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COCKBURN TOWN, Turks and Caicos (AP) _ Examinations of the
bodies of six Haitian refugees who drowned Monday when their sloop
capsized off the Turks and Caicos islands did not have gunshot
wounds, police said Friday.
	   Some of the survivors of the shipwreck said marine police had
fired at the boat. But police said warning shots were fired in the
air, but not at the overcrowded boat, said Deputy Police
Commissioner Bryan Davies.
	   The sunken boat has been raised and will be examined, Davies
said Friday.
	   The 70 Haitians who survived the sinking are being interviewed
with the help of interpreters and also spent more than an hour
Thursday talking with a representative from the Haitian consulate
in the Bahamas.
	   The ship sank Monday just 15 miles off Providenciales, the
largest island in the British archipelago 600 miles southeast of
Florida.
	   Survivors said as many as 113 people were on the boat, but
police said there were about 70 survivors and six bodies recovered.
	   Davies said police also want to interview the occupants of two
sailing yachts that may have been near the incident. The names of
the vessels are unknown, but some survivors said they were flying
U.S. flags.
	   Thousands of Haitian refugees fleeing their impoverished country
have ended up in the Turks and Caicos islands in recent years.

EU veterinary experts split on beef ban end; delay vote
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ European Union veterinary experts were
divided Friday over a proposal to lift a global ban on British beef
exports and delayed a vote until next Thursday.
	   Sources said Britain, Ireland and Sweden favored ending the ban,
imposed in March, 1996 because of ``mad cow'' disease. Germany and
others, however, questioned the wisdom of such a move.
	   If there is no majority among the veterinary experts from the 15
EU nations, the proposal to lift the export ban goes to the EU
agriculture ministers.
	   The veterinary experts said they need more time to consider the
European Commission's recommendation to resume exports of British
beef from cattle born after August 1 1996.
	   On that date, Britain banned the feeding of the ground remains
of sheep and other animals to cattle which is the cause of ``mad
cow'' disease, a brain ailment in cattle, known as bovine
spongiform encephalopathy. That disease is related to an equally
fatal human variant, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
	   Even if the political go-ahead for a resumption of British beef
sales is given soon, it will take months before British beef is
exported again. The resumption of trade would have to wait until
final EU checks have been carried out on a slew of anti-BSE health
and safety measures in Britain. Under the proposal, must be
deboned, come from animals aged between six and 30 months that have
been killed in approved slaughterhouses and hail from herds
guaranteed to be BSE-free.
	   Germany, in particular, is wary about resuming British beef
sales, fearing a consumer backlash. Chancellor Helmut may not be in
the mood for concessions in the runup to September elections.

Ingush leader appeals to Yeltsin to help get hostages released
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The leader of southern Russia's Ingush region
appealed Friday to President Boris Yeltsin to help obtain the
release of two Ingush held hostage in neighboring North Ossetia.
	   The two were among more than a dozen bus passengers taken
hostage Monday in the North Ossetian village of Batako. The rest
were released.
	   The hostage-taking was an apparent retaliation for the abduction
of seven residents from Batako, which was blamed on Ingush.
	   Ingush leader Ruslan Aushev appealed to Yeltsin to help and to
restore order in the region, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   Both North Ossetia and Ingushetia are located in the North
Caucasus, a restive region that also includes breakaway Chechnya.
	   Predominantly Orthodox Christian North Ossetia and Muslim
Ingushetia fought a short but bloody war in 1992. Hundreds of
people were killed and most ethnic Ingush were expelled from North
Ossetia.
	   Aushev said Ingush homes have been burned in North Ossetia and
some people trying to return to their former homes face resistance.

With show of force, Nigeria's new regime dispels demonstrators

	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Troops firing into the air and riot police
unleashing tear gas, Nigeria's new military boss sent a clear
signal Friday to his myriad opponents: Muscle still rules this
junta-weary country.
	   Pro-democracy activists and other government opponents calling
for an end to military rule had planned to take to the streets in
protest. They were confronted by a wall of police and army force in
Lagos, Nigeria's commercial hub.
	   Faced with his first major test _ the prospect of defiant
opposition _ Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar responded with enough force
to quell any hopes of a meaningful anti-government demonstration.
	   Police arrested Gani Fawehinmi, a lawyer and leading dissident
who organized the protests, his aides said Friday. They also
arrested Dupe Abiola, one of the wives of the imprisoned
businessman Moshood Abiola, the presumed winner of canceled 1993
elections.
	   Fawehinmi, arriving at the scene of one of protests, was lifted
onto the shoulders of three men, witnesses said. Police were
enraged when the crowd began to cheer support for Fawehinmi, who
was then arrested along with the men carrying him.
	   Fawehinmi has been detained before and released, but his arrest
Friday was sure to deal another blow to an opposition already
weakened by the imprisonment or exile of most of its main leaders.
	   ``Soldiers are all the same,'' said Joseph Ahmed, a Lagos
resident watching police haul away a few protesters from the scene
of one confrontation. ``If anyone wants to criticize them, they go
and use force.''
	   In the Yaba district on the city's north side, several vehicles
filled with riot police roared into position Friday to block 300
protesters from marching toward the area's main bus terminal.
Police fired bullets and tear gas, sending demonstrators scurrying
for cover.
	   Another group of 500 to 600 activists were dispersed with tear
gas, witnesses said.
	   A man dressed in a coat and tie was held by one policeman while
another kicked and slapped him from behind. Behind him, another
well-dressed man was pulled by the arm into the station.
	   ``We want the world to now that Nigerians want an end to
military rule,'' said University of Lagos student Dele Alabai.
``This is not about Abacha or about Abubakar. It is a struggle for
democracy.''
	   About 100 highly armed soldiers and riot police drove through
the neighborhood in a convoy of about six vehicles led by an
armored car. Hundreds of regular police directed traffic and
blocked some streets.
	   Elsewhere in Lagos, troops packed into transport trucks fired
their rifles into the air, rumbling through town in a menacing
display of military might.
	   About 15 kilometers (10 miles) west of the city, students from
the Lagos State College of Education clashed briefly with police
after running into the streets and setting tires on fire, witnesses
said. They were subdued with tear gas, and 10 were arrested.
	   Many people stayed home Friday after the government refused
opposition requests for permits to protest and issued ominous
warnings, leaving the normally congested streets of Lagos just half
full.
	   Friday's protests were organized months ago to mark the
five-year anniversary of the annulment of Nigeria's last
presidential elections on June 12, 1993, and to call for freedom
for Abiola, the imprisoned billionaire businessmen believed to have
won the vote.
	   But the demonstrations took on an added significance, coming
only days after Abubakar was appointed leader of this oil-rich but
impoverished West African country. Gen. Sani Abacha, notorious for
his brutal and oppressive rule, died Monday of a heart attack.
	   ``The Struggle Continues. The Military Must Go. Abiola For
President,'' read a large banner carried by youths who marched
through one Lagos neighborhood Friday and handed out pro-democracy
leaflets.
	   During Abacha's years in power, corruption tore away at
Nigeria's economy
	   and its infrastructure, leaving both in shambles. Despite the
country's vast oil reserves, motorists line up and wait for hours
at the few gas stations that haven't run dry.
	   Abubakar already has infuriated the opposition by offering only
a vague pledge to move forward with democratic reforms and a
transition to civilian rule by Oct. 1.

World Cup: England's Tony Adams set for ``good day at the office''
</HEADLINE>
against Tunisia &QL; 
 &UR; By MORLEY MYERS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LA BAULE, France (AP) _ With their opening match just three days
away, England's World Cup players relaxed with a round of golf
Friday, seemingly ignoring Monday's crucial Group G clash with
Tunisia in Marseilles.
	   But behind the lighthearted humor, manager Glen Hoddle's
22-strong squad was focussed on the task ahead.
	   ``They are really looking forward to going into action and there
is an extra bounce in their step as it gets closer,'' said Hoddle.
	   No one is more eager to get into the fray than Tony Adams, the
iron man at the heart of the England defense.
	   Like the rest of the England players, 31-year-old Adams has
never figured in a World Cup finals tournament, despite playing in
51 internationals.
	   ``I am very excited and very grateful to get the opportunity to
play at the highest level. This is a very exciting period of my
life,'' said Adams, a recovering alcoholic who has conquered his
personal demons.
	   Adams' joy at captaining Arsenal to the League and FA Cup
battle, was marred by an end-of-season injury, but there are no
question marks about his fitness now.
	   ``I feel very fit, at my strongest. The rest I had after the FA
Cup was good for me,'' he said.
	   Adams was impressed with the way Brazil opened its title defense
with a 2-1 victory over Scotland, saying the champions had good
players in addition to the star-rated Ronaldo.
	   ``Brazil is an excellent team. You stop one player and another
one gets through. It is not just about Ronaldo, although he is a
marvelous player. I relish the chance of to play against this sort
of opponent.''
	   But Adams is now concentrating on Tunisia, determined to enjoy a
good day at the office _ which is how he describes his match
performances.
	   ``Our first game is Tunisia and I expect to have hell of a good
day at the office, as simple as that,'' he said. ``I am focused
bang on Tunisia ... I will know the strengths and weakness of every
player they have on the team by then.''
	   Adams felt disappointed at the axing of Paul Gascoigne, but
believed the story of Gazza's downfall should be laid to rest.
	   ``There is an element of sadness. I would have liked a fit
talented Paul Gascoigne playing in the World Cup, but it is not to
be and to keep talking about it is to do a disservice to the other
players ... you have got to go out there and seize the day.''

	   EXPECTANT mothers can expect special treatment at the Ipoh
Hospital's Obstetric and Gynaecology (O&AMP;G) unit with the launch of
an aggressive programme to ensure that pregnancies are risk-free.
	   The unit has been revamped; some of the facilities have been
upgraded and new ones installed. It occupies a RM3 million complex
which sits on the site of the old hospital which was built 10 years
ago.
	   Its comfortable waiting area and well-equipped labour suites
will help calm the jitters of new expectant mothers, especially.
	   The complex has a fully operational modern birthing centre, an
operation theatre, a sterilisation unit, eight maternity suites and
a seminar hall.
	   It is equipped with the facilities to cope with high-risk
pregnancies.
	   A brainchild of the hospital's O&AMP;G unit chief Datuk Dr N.
Sivalingam, the centre is the result of years of research and
planning. This has paid off as the centre is now not only the the
pride of the Ipoh Hospital, but the northern region as well. It
also serves as a teaching and referral centre for the region.
	   Pregnancy and childbirth may be natural processes but they are
by no means risk-free. However, with modern research, there are
ways of cutting down the risks and reducing the number of maternal
deaths.
	   Health Ministry director-general Tan Sri Dr Abu Bakar Suleiman
said recently that there are plans to set up ultra-modern birthing
centres at obstetric and gynaecology units by the year 2000 in
Malaysia's hospitals to cope with high-risk pregnancies.
	   He said the centres would have an atmosphere close to the home
environment.
	   Although such centres have been set up in some hospitals, they
were merely equipped with maternity units unlike at the Ipoh
Hospital where it is a new, independent complex.
	   Dr Abu Bakar said the Ipoh O&AMP;G complex was one of the ministry's
earlier budgeted projects that was carried out despite the economic
downturn.
	   According to Dr Sivalingam, the Ipoh unit also adopts the
ministry's shared care concept for all pregnancies. This involves
the use of outside health centres and the private sector, including
general practitioners, for normal pregnancies.
	   ``Here, we use the Risk Coding System which allows staff of
public health centres to identify the mothers through colour
codes,'' he explained.
	   The colour coding identification method is a strategy to reduce
maternal morbidity and mortality as high-risk mothers or pregnant
moms who require special care are managed more intensively.
	   New mothers' visiting cards are tagged with one of four colours
- white, green, yellow and red.
	   The new moms visiting any of the primary healthcare centres will
first be screened by a doctor and given a tag according to their
health status.
	   A mother with pre-existing conditions such as high blood
pressure, diabetes, heart problems or severe anaemia is considered
high-risk mothers because her chance of developing complications
are higher, and will be given a red tag which means she must
deliver her baby in hospital.
	   A yellow tag indicates that her pregnancy must be monitored by a
doctor while green- and white-tagged moms are considered low-risk
cases and receive care at clinic-level.
	   The code system is reviewed with each ante-natal and post-natal
visit.
	   The four major causes of maternal death in Malaysia are post
partum haemorrhage (uncontrolled bleeding after delivery);
hypertensive-related pregnancies; pulmonary embolism and associated
medical conditions such as rheumatic heart diseases; and diabetes.
	   Mothers found to be anaemic are given iron, folic acid and
vitamin B complex supplements while underweight moms are put on the
supplementation feeding programme and will receive full cream milk
and hematinics.
	   Perak's network of primary healthcare facilities comprising
consisting of health centres and community clinics have trained
nurses and midwives with experience in outpatient treatment or
first aid.
	   At the community clinics, cooking demonstrations and talks on
nutrition are conducted by community nurses for the new mothers in
the vicinity.
	   Like other disciplines, the O&AMP;G unit also has its own High
Dependency Unit (HDU) to monitor the critically ill obstetric
patients who do not meet the criteria for admission to an intensive
care unit.
	   The HDU is also to reduce the morbidity and mortality of
critically ill obstetric patients and like a caring body, the unit
also ensures that the patients and their relatives are given moral
support during the critical phase of the illness.
	   All admission to the HDU, which has six beds, is determined
through consultation with the specialist. Those likely to be
admitted are patients with cardiopulmonary disorders, complicated
heart diseases, acute bronchial asthma, severe lung disease, severe
hypertension, obstetric haemorrhaging and other severe medical or
surgical conditions.
	   In addition, those with post-delivery complications like
postpartum haemorrhaging, sepsis and deep vein thrombosis may also
be admitted.
	   Despite its purpose, the HDU room is far from a morbid area. The
bright and clean environment, and the friendly staff are
therapeutic.
	   Other programmes run by the O&AMP;G unit include the weekly
ante-natal classes involving both husband and wives. During these
classes, the couples are taught normal preparatory exercises,
physiology, lactation, contraception and delivery.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Wed. - Airtime Management &AMP; Programming (AMP)
today confirmed the closure of its two radio channels, TalkRadio
and Classic Rock.
	   Two new Astro's 24-hour non-FM channels - Era and Chuan Zhen Xin
Qu Tai (both under AMP management) - which were previously aired
from Astro's digital satellite radio, have since been broadcast
over the two vacant frequencies.
	   At present, Era (the Bahasa Malaysia network) can be heard at
these frequencies; 103.3FM Klang Valley, 103.6FM Seremban, 103.6FM
Penang, 103.7FM Ipoh, 90.3FM Malacca and 104.5FM Johor Baru, while
Chuan Zhen Xin Qu Tai's frequencies are as follows; 101.8FM Klang
Valley, 100.6FM Seremban, 99.7FM Penang, 100.6FM Ipoh, 106.4FM
Malacca and 95.4FM Johor Baru.
	   It is learnt that while the closure of the Classic Rock channel
was a hot speculation for almost a month, TalkRadio's came as a
surprise. The closure took effect last Monday.
	   The former was given a two-and-a-half-week advance notice of its
closure while the decision on the latter was taken only a few days
before the shut down.
	   Prior to the closure, Classic Rock tunes were aired on Astro's
satellite radio on Channel 307, while TalkRadio was on Dawn Radio
channel on Astro's 308.
	   According to AMP general manager Ruslan Abdul Rahman, although
both Classic Rock and TalkRadio had attracted a group of dedicated,
loyal listeners, based on market research, the company concluded
that the size of the audience did not justify dedicated networks.
	   ``That is why we decided to introduce the Bahasa Malaysia and
Chinese language networks to provide new opportunities for the
promotion of local music and artistes.''

World Cup: Croatia accuses Jamaica of blocking access to training
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHAUMONT, France (AP) - Croatian officials said that they plan
to protest to FIFA after being denied access to a Jamaican training
session Wednesday.
	   Jamaica denies the charge, claiming that the officials were in
fact journalists, and that the session was closed to foreign media.
	   ``The journalist was told on Tuesday that Wednesday night's
training session was not open to the foreign media, but he still
turned up and asked to be allowed in,'' said Ed Barnes, Jamaica's
spokesman.
	   Croatian officials insist that the man was a team
representative, but the Jamaicans say he was the same journalist
who had asked to attend the workout Tuesday.
	   Meanwhile, Jamaica has only one injury concern before its World
Cup opener against Croatia on Sunday.
	   Defender Frank Sinclair aggravated a groin injury and will
undergo a fitness test before the match.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Wed. - A housewife told the Sessions Court today
that a motorist threatened to knock down her sister after the
latter refused to move from a vacant parking lot.
	   Koo May Chan, 33, said the man, who was standing outside his
car, was arguing with her sister Mei Fong while she (May Chan)
waited to park her car at the parking lot.
	   She said the man then got into his car and drove slowly towards
the parking lot and then suddenly knocked into Mei Fong and also
those waiting with her.
	   May Chan said those waiting with Mei Fong at the vacant parking
lot were the latter's two children, who were in a trolley, and also
her own children.
	   She was giving evidence at the trial of businessman Teh Chuan
Ann, 40, who is charged with attempting to commit culpable homicide
not amounting to murder of Mei Fong, Chiew Yuen Kee and Chin Sim
Yee.
	   Teh, of Taman Tenaga, Cheras, is alleged to have committed the
offence on Jan 25 this year, about 7.30pm at the Jaya Jusco
supermarket car park in Taman Maluri, Cheras.
	   He claimed trial to the charge as well as two charges of
committing mischief by causing damage of above RM25 to the two
vehicles at the same place and time.
	   May Chan said after the incident she rushed out of her car
towards the parking lot to see whether her children were still
alive.
	   She said she saw someone pulling out Chiew, who is Mei Fong's
daughter, from under the car and her body and face were covered
with blood.
	   May Chan said her daughter Chin, was also pulled out from under
the car and she had injuries on her legs.
	   She said the family had gone to Jaya Jusco and upon reaching the
car park Mei Fong and the children stepped out of the car.
	   May Chan said Mei Fong took a trolley that was in front the car
and went to the vacant parking lot with the children.
	   She said she then saw a blue Proton Wira passing on her right
and heading towards the same parking lot.
	   Hearing before judge Lim Yee Lan continues.

	   AN UNUSUAL GARDEN ... In the midst of chaotic traffic that marks
Jalan Stadium in Alor Star lies this patch planted with ginger,
serai, lengkuas, pegaga, sireh, sweet potato, tapioca and
pineapple.
	   This roundabout actually serves as a vegetable plot or rather a
herbal garden.
	   The unlikely garden was an idea mooted by Menteri Besar Tan Sri
Sanusi Junid in an effort to landscape the town and popularise the
idea of edible gardens.
	   The roundabout was planted with several kinds of vegetables,
herbs and plants in early 1997 and is maintained by the Kota Setar
Municipal Council at the cost of about RM1,000 a month.
	   The garden was first harvested last week with its yield sold to
council staff and members of the public for a cool RM1,200.
	   A council spokesman said the plants were harvested every four to
six months depending on its type.
	   The spokesman said that maintenance however was a difficult job.

	   HER romance with a Chinese soccer player forced her out of the
recording studios for three years, but it was a blessing in
disguise for singer Na Ying.
	   At that time, the Chinese soccer team was trying to make the
1996 Atlanta Olympics, followed by the 1998 World Cup qualifiers,
and public opinion was that Na Ying's relationship with Kao Fong, a
striker, would distract him.
	   ``There was pressure on us to break the relationship as the fans
were afraid Kao Fong would not be at his best.
	   ``However, they gradually accepted us when they realised we were
really in love,'' said Na Ying.
	   ``We met during a function in 1995 where I was one of the
performers and Kao Fong and his teammates were guests. He
introduced himself and we started talking. The next day, he called
me and we soon became a couple.''
	   Na Ying added that not many people could accept the relationship
and some even chided her. ``I did a lot of soul-searching during
those three years and told myself that once the public furore died,
I needed a fresh start in my singing career. I set my sights on the
regional music market and changed management companies.'' She
joined K's Productions Ltd, which manages Taiwanese singer Jeff
Chang. It clinched a three-year recording deal for Na Ying with EMI
Asia last June.
	   Na Ying then released a Mandarin album, Conquer, apparently
referring to her desire to break into Chinese-speaking markets.
	   Na Ying's friend, Faye Wong, sings backup vocals on Dream Is
Over. Na Ying also composed her first song, No Matter How Bitter.
	   Na Ying started singing at 10 and joined the Sheng Yang Music
Academy in 1983. She graduated two years later and joined a
song-and-dance troupe in her hometown. In 1988, she won the gold in
the ``Yang Guang'' nationwide singing competition. Since then, she
has released more than 15 albums. Na Ying was voted Best Female
Artiste of China from 1991 to 1995.
	   Na Ying does not have any regrets about missed opportunities as
she loves Kao Fong. They have not set a wedding date as both are
busy with their careers.
	   Na Ying was in Kuala Lumpur and Penang recently for meet-the-fan
sessions. During a Press conference, she received a souvenir plaque
from an EMI Asia representative.

	   SEREMBAN, Wed. - The State Department of Environment has been
asked to submit a detailed report on the alleged noise pollution
and vibration from a power plant which is affecting residents of
Taman NLFCS in Tanjong Gemuk, Port Dickson.
	   Menteri Besar Tan Sri Mohamad Isa Abdul Samad said today the
report was necessary in the wake of cracks appearing on roads in
the housing estate which the residents claim are caused by the
vibrations.
	   He said the State Public Works Department has also been directed
to conduct tests on the affected roads to ascertain the cause of
the problem.
	   The New Straits Times reported today that 60 families living
near the plant of the independent power producer were worried about
the problem which they claimed was turning from bad to worse.
	   Taman NLFCS Residents' Association committee chairman S. Gabriel
claimed that despite numerous appeals to the authorities no
effective measures had been taken to solve the problem.
	   He said the residents moved into their homes in 1992 while the
plant was set up in 1994.
	   The problems faced by the residents ere first highlighted by the
NST in October 1996.
	   Mohaned Isa said the matter was raised during the recent State
Development Committee meeting following complaints received from
the Taman NLFCS Residents' Association committee members. ``They
also met me to explain their problem,'' he said after chairing the
State Executive Council meeting at Wisma Negri here.
	   He said the DOE in its preliminary report during the meeting
stated that the vibration was within the permissible level.
	   However, Mohamad Isa said, the department was asked to look into
the complaint again and to come up with an in-depth report.
	   Meanwhile, a spokesman of Port Dickson Power Sdn Bhd, when
contacted, said the company was arranging a meeting with the
affected residents.
	   He said they were willing to meet the residents' committee and
iron out whatever grievances they face.
	   ``We will listen to all their problems and do our best to settle
the matter soon,'' he added.
	   Gabriel confirmed that the company had contacted him to arrange
a meeting to discuss the matter.
	   However, Gabriel said what the residents really wanted was for
their homes to be relocated and not mere compensation.
	   According to him, residents there had been suffering for the
past five years and being compensated would not put an end to the
problem.
	   ``Compensation would not mean an end to the problem,'' he said,
adding that what they wanted was to be compensated for their losses
during the five years and to be relocated to avoid any further
hardship.
	   He said that they were now unable to sell their houses as
everyone was aware of their plight and there would be no takers.
	   ``Therefore, we have no choice but ask that we be relocated and
compensated for whatever losses and sufferings experienced,'' he
said.

World Cup: Bergkamp's fear of flying may eliminate him from 2002
</HEADLINE>
World Cup &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   VERSAILLES, France (AP) - Injury deprives some superstars of
ever playing in the World Cup.
	   Others have the misfortune to be born in countries too weak to
ever qualify for the showpiece event.
	   Dutchman Dennis Bergkamp is set to bow out of soccer's most
important event in 1998 for a more unusual reason: a profound fear
of flying.
	   On the eve of the Netherlands' World Cup opener Saturday,
Bergkamp conceded that his refusal to fly makes any thought of
appearing at the 2002 tournament in Japan and South Korea
impractical.
	   ``I am 29 and it's is difficult to know what will happen in the
future. But I don't think the situation will change when it comes
to me flying,'' Bergkamp said.
	   Bergkamp won't specify the exact reason for his fear of flying,
but he hasn't set foot in a plane since returning from the 1994
World Cup.
	   During the championship, a Dutch journalist flying with the team
between Orlando to Dallas caused a bomb hoax as the aircraft was
delayed on the runway.
	   Known as an introspective and thoughtful player, Bergkamp had
already been disturbed by a plane crash that killed 176 people _
including Surinamese youth players - in 1989.
	   Counseling, arranged by both by the Netherlands and his club
Arsenal, has failed to ease Bergkamp's anxiety, and the striker
will travel separately from his teammates between World Cup venues.
	   Bergkamp, unlikely to start against Belgium because of injury,
has been in spectacular form for Arsenal, guiding the club to the
English Premiership and F.A. Cup double last year.
	   Voted the third best player in the world by FIFA in 1997,
Bergkamp has scored 33 goals for the Netherlands, putting him just
two short of the Dutch record held by Faas Wilkes.

	   THE Australian Government has expressed strong interest to
collaborate with its Malaysian counterpart in the Multimedia Super
Corridor (MSC) project, particularly with regards to the electronic
commerce (e-commerce) flagship application.
	   Its Minister for Communications, Information Economy and the
Arts Senator Richard Alston said both countries stand to benefit
from such a collaboration especially when e-commerce promises huge
business opportunities.
	   He added that Australia views the MSC not only from a business
viewpoint, but also in terms of the prospects of enhancing further
its ties with Malaysia. ``The MSC facilitates the exchange of ideas
and knowledge. On top of that, we are very keen in touching base
and maintaining the good relationship with the Malaysian
Government,'' Alston said, adding that more Australian companies
are expected to set up operations in Malaysia in the future. He was
speaking to reporters after visiting the office of MSC-status
company and home-grown software developer Datek Sdn Bhd in Petaling
Jaya on Monday.
	   Other than the MSC partnership, Alston said Australia will
assist Malaysia in its efforts to put in place the new Multimedia
and Communication Act. He explained that this followed his recent
meeting with of Energy, Telecommunications and Posts Minister Datuk
Leo Moggie.
	   The Act is designed to improve the efficiency of the existing
telecommunications industry and to facilitate the development of
new information technology (IT) and multimedia services in
Malaysia.
	   At the same Press conference, Datek's chairman and chief
executive officer Darryl Carlton announced that the company will
launch its new accounting business software solution next month,
followed by another product, Arumba, which is targeted for
telecommunications companies, in September.

Russian soldiers seized, bomb explodes in Muslim cemetery in

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Ten Russian soldiers were kidnapped and a powerful
time-bomb exploded in a Muslim cemetery in the Caucasus republic of
Dagestan on Friday, wounding one person, Russian news agencies
reported.
	   The soldiers were seized Thursday night in a suburb of the
Dagestani capital Makhachkala and their bus was taken in the
direction of neighboring Chechnya, the ITAR-Tass news agency said,
citing the local Interior Ministry.
	   No other details of the abduction were available.
	   The bomb Friday exploded at the grave of the father of
Makhachkala's mayor, the Interfax news agency said.
	   Mayor Said Amirov was not at the grave when the explosion
occurred _ even though it went off in the afternoon hours when
people often visit their recently deceased relatives' graves.
Amirov has been visiting the grave daily since his father died last
week, Interfax said.
	   In other unrest in the Caucasus region on Friday, the leader of
Ingushetia appealed to Russian President Boris Yeltsin to help
obtain the release of two Ingush held hostage in neighboring North
Ossetia.
	   The two were among more than a dozen bus passengers taken
hostage Monday in the North Ossetian village of Batako. The rest
were released.
	   The hostage-taking was an apparent retaliation for the abduction
of seven residents from Batako, which was blamed on Ingush.
	   Predominantly Orthodox Christian North Ossetia and Muslim
Ingushetia fought a short but bloody war in 1992. Hundreds of
people were killed and most ethnic Ingush were expelled from North
Ossetia.
	   Aushev said Ingush homes have been burned in North Ossetia and
some people trying to return to their former homes face resistance.
	   A police checkpoint in North Ossetia was attacked with grenades
and gunfire on Thursday night but no one was hurt, ITAR-Tass said.
	   The attack on the mobile post near the mountain village of Chmi
was the second to target a North Ossetian police station in two
days, ITAR-Tass said. On Wednesday night, automatic rifle-fire and
grenades hit another police post set up near a quarry.
	   Citing local police, ITAR-Tass said that ``all traces'' of both
attacks led to Ingushetia.

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Police arrested a man Friday on charges he
killed 11 members of his family in a killing spree that shocked
Jordan.
	   Police said Saeed Qashash, 18, confessed that he killed his
family because he feared he might fail his high school exams.
	   Police did not say if he had any accomplices.
	   The dead included school bus driver Amin Qashash, 50, his wife,
four children, a son-in-law and four grandchildren. They were
killed before dawn Thursday in their home in Banayat, a village 20
kilometers (12 miles) northwest of Amman, government officials
said. Qashash is Amin Quashash's son.
	   The family was shot in their house's basement and a brick wall
was then built to hide its entrance, an official said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
	   A quiet country with a reputation for security, Jordan has been
shaken recently by a series of shootings and bombings.

Environmentalists block main north-south artery, other freeway

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Local residents and environmentalists
Friday started a 28-hour blockade of the Brenner Pass on the
Austrian-Italian border, but bad weather and advance warning
prevented any of the predicted major traffic snarls.
	   Blockade organizers, endorsed by the government of Austria's
Tyrol province, are venting their anger against what they call an
intolerable increase in heavy-truck traffic, and protesting
European Union traffic policy in general.
	   Intermittent blockades also took place south of Salzburg on the
Tauern freeway, another north-south artery.
	   The Brenner freeway was blocked for all traffic between 11 a.m.
Friday and 3 p.m. (1300 GMT) Saturday, but police closed it already
an hour earlier.
	   On the Tauern freeway, traffic was halted for 20 minutes at
every hour between 11 a.m. and 4. p.m. (1400 GMT) on Friday, two
hours less than planned because of lack of interest due to cold and
rainy weather.
	   Only about 1,000 protesters _ including Tyrol governor Wendelin
Weingartner _ attended a rally at Schoenberg on the Brenner pass.
The weather kept the crowd far below organizers' expectations.
	   Weingartner criticized attempts to abolish night-time road tolls
on the Brenner pass, considered excessive by the EU.
	   Only a shift from roads to railways can solve the transit
problem, he said.
	   ``Tyrol stands united against the (European Union's) traffic
policy, which disregards human beings,'' claimed Fritz Gurgiser,
the chairman of Transit Forum Tirol Austria, protest organizers.
	   He claimed a study drafted at the EU's behest shows transit
traffic across the Brenner pass will increase from the present 1.2
million to two million trucks per year.
	   The local automobile club reported that traffic chaos did not
materialize _ probably because the protest had been well publicized
in advance and many drivers took alternative routes to and from
Italy. The cold weather also probably kept many at home who
otherwise would have gone away for a holiday weekend.
	   In Tyrol province south of Innsbruck, traffic was being rerouted
from the Brenner freeway to a narrower highway that can no longer
handle present-day peak auto and truck traffic.
	   The blockade drew sharp criticism from Italy and Germany and
from Austrian and Bavarian road haulage associations.
	   But the demonstration was supported by all political parties in
the Tyrolean provincial diet, as well as by the most important
parties in Alto Adige, the German-speaking northern Italian
province.

Paul McCartney approves plans to name cancer unit after wife
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LIVERPOOL, England (AP) _ Former Beatle Paul McCartney has given
his consent to plans to name a new cancer center after his wife,
Linda, who died of breast cancer last month.
	   The center, which will cost 4 million pounds (dlrs 6.5 million),
is scheduled to open next spring in this northwest England city,
which gave birth to the Fab Four _ and where McCartney grew up.
	   ``We are delighted to honor the memory of Lady Linda in this way
and are so pleased that her name is to be associated with a
development that will be of undoubted benefit to patients from Sir
Paul's hometown,'' said Keith Parsons, chief executive of the Royal
Liverpool University Hospitals, where the center will be based.
	   An appeal campaign in memory of Mrs. McCartney that has been set
up to fund the center currently stands at 3.2 million pounds (dlrs
5 million).

Umotivated Sampras goes out in Wimbledon warmup
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMS; RECASTS, trims; will be updated with final three
quarterfinals

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ What's troubling Pete Sampras just 10 days before
Wimbledon begins?
	   Mark Woodforde, who defeated the four-time Wimbledon champion in
straight sets Friday at the Queen's Club tournament, thinks he
knows the answer.
	   ``Everyone is aware that, motivation-wise, he's not there,''
said the Australian, a 6-3, 6-2 third-round winner on Sampras'
favorite surface.
	   ``I played a pretty good tight match against him, and he just
wasn't able to pick it up where in the past he was able to take it
up a notch or two,'' said Woodforde, known primarly as a doubles
specialist.
	   ``That's where he is found wanting.''
	   Friday's defeat was the latest surprising loss for defending
Wimbledon champion Sampras. He has struggled most of the year and
was ousted in the second round of the French Open by little-known
Ramon Delgado of Paraguay.
	   Sampras, who had beaten the 66th-ranked Woodforde in all of
their previous 10 matches, put off interviews until after a doubles
match later Friday.
	   Woodforde mixed up his shots, returning well and often catching
Sampras with lobs whenever the American ventured to the net. But
his most effective tactic was to hit a succession of drop volleys
which fell just over the net and left Sampras stranded.
	   The Australian also served far better than Sampras, hitting
three aces in the opening game to set the tone of the match.
	   In contrast, Sampras produced four double-faults, the last of
which gave Woodforde a break for 3-2 in the second set. A netted
backhand voley then gave Woodforde a second break for 5-2.
	   In addition to its top seed, Queen's also lost No. 2 Greg
Rusedski of Britain, who suffered an ankle injury Friday during his
third-round match against Italian qualifier Laurence Tieleman.
	   With the score at 2-2 in the first set, Rusedski slipped while
stretching for a backhand volley and fell awkwardly with his left
leg buckling beneath him.
	   Rusedski screamed in pain and writhed on the grass before being
carried off the court and taken to a hospital for X-rays.
	   Tournament doctor Johnnie Gaynor said it appeared to be just a
sprain. It wasn't immediately clear whether the injury would force
Rusedski to miss Wimbledon, where he reached the quarterfinals last
year.
	   In order to clear up a backlog of matches caused by rain delays,
players Friday faced the prospect of playing two matches _ third
round and quarterinals _ to get the tournament back on track.
	   Seventh-seeded Tim Henman of Britain became the highest ranked
played to reach the quarterfinals with a 6-1, 6-7 (7-5), 6-4
victory over 1997 champion and 10th-seeded Goran Ivanisevic.
	   In the first quarterfinal match, 14th-seeded Byron Black of
Zimbabwe defeated Brian MacPhie, United States, 7-5, 6-1.

Ethiopians and Eritreans blame each other for clashes

	   ADIGRAT, Ethiopia (AP) _ The guns were quiet in the
Ethiopia-Eritrea conflict Friday, but the two countries'
governments continued their salvos of blame for the escalating
clashes threatening to spiral into war.
	   Residents fled the northern town of Adigrat after Eritrean
helicopters and planes bombed the town Thursday killing four
civilians and wounding 30.
	   U.S. and Rwandan diplomats were shuttling between the Ethiopian
capital Addis Ababa and the Eritrean capital Asmara to try to help
resolve the conflict.
	   In Adigrat, about 20 kilometers (12 miles) from the embattled
Ethiopian border town of Zala Ambessa, residents hastily buried two
victims of Thursday's bombing raid before dawn so they could leave
town. The other two were so disfigured they could not be
identified, according to Netsanet Asfaw, a local government
spokeswoman.
	   Wounded still filled beds lining the corridors of Adigrat's
hospital, where over 100 wounded soldiers are also being treated.
	   Dozens of residents fled to outlying villages Friday fearing
further shelling, and all businesses were closed in a sign of
mourning.
	   Neither side reported new clashes on Friday.
	   The Ethiopian army poured reinforcements into the front lines
south of Zala Ambessa Friday, ten days after Eritreans captured the
town. Col. Ephrem Bengee, a commander in the area said he expected
a fresh Eritrean offensive there after a lull of several days.
	   Soldiers packed into six trucks, numbering over 300, sang and
cheered as they passed through Adigrat heading north.
	   The Eritrean government said in a statement it bombed the
northeastern border town of Adigrat because the Ethiopians had
turned it into ``the main garrison for reinforcing the invading
Ethiopian army and a center for army logistics.''
	   But Ethiopian government spokeswoman Selome Tadesse, said in
Addis Ababa the attack was ``an act of desperation'' after Eritrean
forces were ``heavily defeated'' in ground fighting on two fronts
Thursday. Eritrea claimed Ethiopian forces were rdriven back.
	   Eritrean rebels fought Ethiopia for 30 years to gain
independence. They succeeded in 1993, two years after helping
Ethiopian rebels under Meles Zenawi _ who is now Ethiopia's prime
minister _ oust a 17-year military dictatorship. Relations between
the two countries deteriorated last year after Eritrea introduced
its own currency.
	   A planeload of 125 foreigners evacuated from Asmara Friday,
apparently fearing Ethiopian retaliation for Thursday's attack on
Adigrat: 78 of them were Filipinos, the rest Britons, South
Africans, Australians and Croatians.
	   A U.S. negotiating team declined comment upon their arrival in
Asmara Friday. Rwandan Vice President Paul Kagame followed and left
early in the evening, according to Eritrean presidential spokesman
Yemane Gebremeskel. He declined comment on Kagame's quick visit.
	   The two countries have authored a proposal for ending the
conflict which calls for a pullback of forces to pre-conflict
positions. Ethiopia accepted the plan, but Eritrea says it lacks
detail, specifically on how the disputed border would be
demarcated.
	   Regional military sources say the plan calls for Rwanda to
supply peacekeepers to enforce demilitarization of the disputed
border regions.
	   On the western Badme-Shiraro front, in the Yirga triangle where
the conflict first erupted, Ethiopian forces captured three tanks
and two anti-aircraft guns, Selome said. They also destroyed a tank
and a gun.
	   Selome said Thursday the Eritreans had suffered heavy losses at
a battle that began Wednesday at Erde Mattios in the Yirga region.
But Eritrean military sources at the site said Ethiopian troops
penetrated as deep as 16 kilometers (10 miles) into Eritrean
territory before being pushed back.
	   Ethiopians suffered heavy human and material losses, the sources
said. They had no comment on Eritrean casualties.
	   Eritrean government spokesman Negash Ashafa said 600 Ethiopian
soldiers were taken prisoner, while the Ethiopians said they had
captured a large number of Eritrean troops.
	   The Ethiopian military said Friday it also wiped out an entire
Eritrean brigade Thursday in fighting at Bure, along the eastern
border in the region of the Eritrean Red Sea port of Assab.
	   ``A whole commando brigade of the Eritrean People's Liberation
Front has been destroyed,'' Bangee said. But Eritrea said the
Ethiopian forces were repelled.
	   Meanwhile, Eritreans working in ``strategic and sensitive''
Ethiopian state enterprises such as telecommunications and power
companies have been ordered to take a one-month leave but could
stay in the country, Selome said Friday.
	   Several Eritrean business leaders who have allegedly raised
money for the war effort will be expelled soon, she said.
	   Eritrea accuses Ethiopia of provoking the attack by bombing the
military-civilian airport at the Eritrean capital of Asmara on June
5 and 6. A week after those attacks, the Eritrean Foreign Ministry
said for the first time that four civilians had been killed and 26
wounded in those bombings.

NATO and Russia agree on danger, differ on method

 &UR; With NATO-Albania &QL; 
 &UR; By JEFFREY ULBRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - Russia and the NATO allies agreed
Friday that the explosive situation in Kosovo represents a grave
danger to its neighbors, but differed on how to deal with defiant
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen, who had a private meeting
with Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev and another as part of
the NATO-Russia Permanent Joint Council, stressed the urgency of
finding a Kosovo solution.
	   ``We are looking at a very short time frame ... to solve this
peacefully,'' he told a news conference at the end of a two-day
North Atlantic Treaty Organization defense ministers' meeting.
	   On Thursday, NATO decided to conduct a demonstration of allied
air power over Albania and Macedonia in hopes of impressing
Milosevic and making him rethink his policy of escalating violence
in the southern province of Kosovo.
	   That demonstration, probably early next week, will involve
simulated air attacks and bombing raids. The ministers also ordered
military planners to study options for further action ranging from
accelerated planning for military exercises in the region to direct
air strikes inside Yugoslavia and use of air mobile ground troops.
	   Cohen said there was a great ``sense of urgency among NATO
members'' that something must be done quickly to stop Milosevic's
attacks on ethnic Albanians, who make up 90 percent of the
population in Kosovo.
	   The rebel Kosovo Liberation Army is seeking independence, an
aspiration NATO does not support.
	   ``NATO, all the ministers, and Russia have a unanimous attitude
toward the events in Kosovo,'' said Sergeyev. ``Our differences are
in assessment, approach and methods.''
	   He said Russia ``is convinced we haven't exhausted all
non-military means ... to resolve this crisis.'' If ``other
methods'' must be adopted, he said, they ``should be the
prerogative of the U.N. Security Council.''
	   Macedonia has not yet given its authorization for the planned
military exercises over its territory, but Albania is delighted
with the decision to show force.
	   ``We are very pleased about the decision taken by the NATO
Council yesterday,'' Albanian Defense Minister Luan Hajdaraga said
in an interview.
	   ``The stand of Milosevic in the Kosovo crisis is very clear, it
is to dominate the situation by military means.'' The danger is, he
said, that ``those means can spread to Albania.''
	   Gen. Henry Shelton, chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff,
couldn't give details of exactly what form the exercises would
take, saying they were still being developed by NATO planners. Nor
could he say what might trigger a direct military intervention in
Kosovo.
	   ``War is an extension of politics by other means,'' he said,
quoting German military philosopher Carl von Clausewitz.
	   ``There is still a whole host of other things to be done,'' he
added.
	   The NATO-Russia Permanent Joint Council was formed a year ago as
part of the effort to ease Russia's fears about NATO enlargement.
It has become a forum for consultation on security issues as well
as planning future cooperation.
	   A joint statement at the end of the meeting said the ministers
discussed Kosovo and ``condemned Belgrade's massive and
disproportionate use of force as well as violent attacks by Kosovar
Albanian extremists.''
	   NATO must walk a fine line between trying to halt the Yugoslav
government's ``disproportionate use of force'' and offering aid and
comfort to the rebels seeking independence, which NATO opposes, and
has been careful to condemn the violence on both sides.
	   Cohen also took pains to assure that NATO actions ``not be seen
in any way as approving independence.''

World Cup: Jones: I'm not just MTV

<TEXT>
	   SAINT-JEAN D'ARDIERES, France (AP) _ He is the poster boy for
U.S. soccer, a rock 'n' roll guy with flying dreadlocks and his own
show on MTV.
	   That's how you become known for playing soccer in America. Now
Cobi Jones is trying to show the world he can play at the top
level, too.
	   ``I'm a lot more experienced, a lot more well-versed in the
game, a lot more confident,'' he said Friday. ``I respect the
big-time players, but I'm not overawed by these players.''
	   Four years ago, he started one game in the World Cup and came
into three as a sub, making little impact. This time, it appears
he'll be starting as an outside midfielder when the United States
opens against Germany on Monday.
	   ``A young 24-year-old out on the field against Romario and
Bebeto is kind of overawed,'' he said, looking back at the
second-round loss to Brazil that eliminated the U.S. team from the
last World Cup. ``I think we have that confidence now. I think this
team is very confident we can go out and play.''
	   Confidence is a key word for American players these days. In
Jones' case, U.S. coach Steve Sampson was more concerned about
fitness.
	   ``In the last year,'' Sampson said, ``he's really tried to
concentrate on the finer elements of his game, working on his ball
control, his technique and his finishing, his diet, spending
additional time in the weight room, making sure he is extremely
fit, not just fit for his club side but for the international
game.''
	   Jones, who has eight goals in eight games for the MLS's Los
Angeles Galaxy, was clearly annoyed be the fitness remark.
	   ``I've always been the same way,'' he said. ``I fluctuate
between 145 and 150. I never go over it. I sometimes get under it
when I get caught up in nonstop training.''
	   His image is part of the problem. He looks oh so cool, with the
dreadlocks and shades.
	   Jones has hosted ``MTV Mega-Dose,'' a show on health and
fitness. The next taping is scheduled for September.
	   Jones, who turns 28 a day after the Germany game, has been
wearing his hair in dreadlocks for about eight years, since his
second year at UCLA. He said he did it because it's ``no
maintenance.''
	   ``I've thought about cutting them every once in a while,'' he
said. ``I did cut them shorter. That's so they won't be in my
eyes.''
	   That's one short cut to stardom he's willing to take.

EU veterinary experts split on beef ban end; delay vote
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ European Union veterinary experts were
divided Friday over a proposal to lift a global ban on British beef
exports, delaying a vote until next week.
	   Sources said Britain, Ireland and Sweden favored ending the ban,
imposed in March, 1996 because of ``mad cow'' disease. Germany and
others, however, questioned the wisdom of such a move.
	   If there is no majority among the veterinary experts from the 15
EU nations, the proposal to lift the export ban goes to the EU
agriculture ministers.
	   The veterinary experts said they need more time to consider the
European Commission's recommendation to resume exports of British
beef from cattle born after August 1 1996.
	   The ban was imposed in March 1996 after Britain acknowledged a
link between cattle with bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or BSE,
and the fatal human brain ailment Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease.
	   Even if the political go-ahead for a resumption of British beef
sales is given soon, it will take months before British beef is
exported again. The resumption of trade would have to wait until
final EU checks have been carried out on anti-BSE health and safety
measures in Britain.
	   Under the proposal, beef must be deboned, come from animals aged
between six and 30 months that have been killed in approved
slaughterhouses and come from herds guaranteed to be BSE-free.
	   Germany, in particular, is wary about resuming British beef
sales, fearing a consumer backlash. Chancellor Helmut may not be in
the mood for concessions in the runup to September elections.

	   MANY are called but few are chosen. This adage is used in
several situations.
	   Its most popular usage is in relation to job interviews where a
large number of people are interviewed in response to newspaper
advertisements of job opportunities but only a few will be
successful.
	   In the legal profession the adage has a different conotation.
	   When a lawyer first enters the profession he is said to have
been called to the Bar. It is the ambition of every young lawyer to
one day become a judge.
	   However, very few are elevated to that position. There are about
70 superior court judges in the country and more than 7,000
practising lawyers which makes the chances of becoming a judge
about one for every 100 lawyers.
	   The number of young people entering the legal profession each
year has increased from a hundred 30 years ago to over 1,000 now.
	   This increase is attributable to the increase in the number of
law schools at local universities, the large number of students
studying law overseas and the twinning programmes for law degrees
between local private colleges and universities in the United
Kingdom.
	   With the current economic slowdown, young lawyers are finding it
difficult to join law firms.
	   Indeed, several law firms have recently retrenched lawyers.
	   Worse still, quite a number of law firms have closed down
because of the economic slowdown.
	   The question arises whether we are producing too many lawyers,
the economic slowdown notwithstanding.
	   Generally, every law graduate wants to be a lawyer because that
is the reason why he or she chose a law course in the first place.
	   Added to this, the law course itself creates a lasting
impression of justice surrounded in an aura of wise judges and
eminent counsel thus instilling in the minds of young lawyers that
the pursuit of justice is a lifetime occupation.
	   A legal education is a very useful discipline. Basically it
trains a person to identify problems and find solutions.
	   Thus a law degree is also a useful qualification in the civil
service, foreign service, police, banking, finance, insurance,
management positions in the corporate world and politics. Not all
law graduates need to become lawyers.
	   There are 93 law schools in Japan producing 38,000 law graduates
each year.
	   To enter the legal profession a law graduate has to sit for and
pass a public examination to gain entry to the Institute of
Judicial and Legal Training.
	   Only the top 600 successful candidates will be accepted each
year to join the institute and undergo two years of professional
training with examinations.
	   Of these, the top 50 will join the judiciary, the next 50 the
government legal service and the remaining 500 will qualify to
become lawyers in private practice.
	   Japan has a population of more than 121 million. We have just
exceeded 20 million! Perhaps the time has come for the Legal
Profession Qualifying Board of which the Attorney-General is the
chairman to seriously consider establishing a regime to limit the
number of lawyers entering the profession each year.
	   An oversupply of lawyers will lead to unethical practices.
	   What the country needs is well-trained lawyers with high ethical
standards.
	   With this is in view, the Qualifying Board recently issued
guidelines in the recognition of United Kingdom, Australian and New
Zealand law degrees for purposes of admission to the Certificate in
Legal Practice examinations.
	   But such recognition can only be transitionary.
	   In most countries the basic qualification to practice law is a
first degree in law from a local university.
	   This requirement makes sense because the lawyer must be fully
trained in local law in order to practice law in his own country.
	   Foreign law degrees are based on the domestic law of the country
the university is located.
	   The UK law degree, for example, is a mixture of the English
common law, British Acts of Parliament and the civil law of Europe,
all largely irrelevant to present day Malaysia.
	   Islamic law applicable in Malaysia is ignored by all foreign
universities.
	   The high failure rate of UK law graduates in the CLP
examinations is partly due to the lack of knowledge and
understanding of Malaysian laws.
	   The recognition of foreign first law degrees is a legacy of the
past when we did not have our own law schools.
	   We cannot stop people from acquiring law degrees overseas but if
they want to practice law in Malaysia they should posses a first
degree in law from a Malaysian university.
	   At present Malaysian universities produce about 500 law
graduates a year.
	   If there is justification for more law graduates, then local
private colleges should have twinning programmes with Malaysian
universities.
	   The Legal Profession Act should therefore be amended to the
effect that only persons with a Malaysian first degree in law will
be admitted to the Bar in Malaysia after the year 2000. Even so,
the adage that many are called but few are chosen will continue to
apply.

Albanian militants kill Serb policemen near Kosovo capital

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Contact Group members weighing JAT flight ban;
Kosovo Albanians welcoming NATO moves, Serbs alternately gloomy and
critical. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Ethnic Albanian militants, boldly
stepping up their attacks against Serb authorities, have killed two
Serb police officers just a few miles (kilometers) from Kosovo's
capital.
	   Fighting between Serbian forces and the KLA erupted again Friday
in the Decani region in western Kosovo, close to the border with
Albania. It was a Serbian offensive there last week that prompted
NATO to announce Thursday a show of air power to persuade Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic to halt such assault.
	   Ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs nine-to-one in Kosovo. Most
seek independence from Serbia, the Yugoslavian republic which
stripped the province of broad autonomy in 1989 and has ruled
repressively since. More than 250 people have been killed since
Serbian police started a crackdown against Albanian militants in
March.
	   Ethnic Albanian sources claimed that six villages in the Decani
area were attacked Friday, some with grenade launchers normally
issued to the Yugoslav army.
	   There was no independent confirmation of their report. The
state-run Tanjug news agency in Belgrade reported that a Serb
police officer was seriously hurt in what it called an attack by
``armed Albanian terrorists'' near one of the villages, Prilep.
	   Serb sources in the province said two policemen where killed and
one was seriously wounded in an overnight ambush by separatists
near Obilic, just seven kilometers (four miles) northwest of the
provincial capital Pristina. Ethnic Albanian sources claimed one
Albanian was wounded in the same incident.
	   Albanian sources further reported Serb attacks on villages in
the Obilic and adjacent Vucitrn regions, saying residents fled and
spent the night under open skies.
	   The ethnic Albanian daily Bujku reported Friday five ethnic
Albanians and seven Serbs were killed in clashes Thursday in Suvo
Grlo in the Drenica area 30 kilometers (20 miles) west of Pristina.
	   On Friday, Western foreign ministers met in London with their
Russian counterpart to step up pressure. Britain, which is weighing
a United Nations' move to back use of NATO force in Kosovo, called
on Milosevic to pull back his troops immediately.
	   The United States, Canada, Britain, France, Italy and Germany
also said they would ``take steps to ban'' flights by Yugoslav
Airlines to underline their concern at the Kosovo violence, British
Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said.
	   Kosovo Albanians welcomed the international moves. It's ``high
time'' that someone strikes against Milosevic, said Eroll Haxhiu,
46, a jewelry salesman in Pristina. ``America can and should do
it.''
	   Members of Kosovo's Serb minority _ whom Milosevic promised to
protect when taking power in Serbia in 1987 _ were alternately
gloomy and defiant.
	   Serbian pensioner Vasilje Stefanovic said Yugoslavian leaders
were responsible for the current problems.
	   ``We are to blame for everything that is happening. We deserve
it,'' he said.
	   Ethnic Albanian media in Kosovo on Friday carried a statement
from the KLA _ the main militant group _ demanding that it be given
a new war tax to be levied on Kosovo Albanians working abroad to
fund the fight against the Serbs.
	   The KLA, a shadowy group which first emerged in 1996 said it now
had about 15,000 fighters in the province.

Albania will offer space for NATO drills, Macedonia not yet

	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Albania said Friday it will offer NATO
airspace and airports for maneuvers in the country aimed at
deterring further violence in Serbia's adjoining secessionist
province of Kosovo.
	   But neighboring Macedonia, whose prime minister visits Albania
this weekend, said it had not yet received an official request from
NATO for exercises and would not allow its territory to be used for
military activity against any neighboring country.
	   Macedonia's Foreign Minister Blagoj Handziski made the comments
when asked by reporters about NATO plans _ announced Thursday _ for
simulated air raids in Albania and Macedonia to deter further
violence in Kosovo.
	   Yugoslavia _ consisting of Serbia and Montenegro _ adjoins
Macedonia.
	   Albania's Prime Minister Fatos Nano, who has lobbied for weeks
for NATO intervention to stop Kosovo violence spiraling out of
control and engulfing the region, announced after a Cabinet meeting
that Albania would offer NATO air space and airfields.
	   ``We are convinced that the crisis in Kosovo is not only a
problem for Albania,'' Nano said. Macedonia ``is also interested in
regional stability ... and I hope that they will not try to keep
their country artificially out of the crisis when the crisis is at
its door.''
	   Macedonia's dominant Slavs have strong ties to the Serbs, but it
also has a sizeable ethnic Albanian majority in its western
territory adjoining Kosovo and Albania proper.

	   PARIS (AP) _ A growing international scandal over World Cup
tickets erupted on two new fronts Friday, with the tournament
organizers saying they were investigating two soccer federations
and a branch of their own marketing arm for possible roles in the
scams.
	   Michel Zen-Ruffinen, FIFA's acting general secretary, said
investigations were under way into the improper sale of tickets by
soccer officials in Cameroon and an unnamed South American country.
French news reports said it was Colombia, but Alvaro Fina, head of
the Colombian federation, said FIFA had assured him his country was
not involved.

Fire breaks out on gas pipeline
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A fire broke out on a gas pipeline in the Perm
region of Russia and spread into a nearby forest, the ITAR-Tass
news agency said Friday.
	   Flames shot 100 meters (yards) into the air from the
Urengoi-Uzhgorod gas pipeline near the village of Mazuyevka, about
1,125 kilometers (700 miles) west of Moscow.
	   The pipeline appeared to have been leaking gas before the fire
started, but the cause was not known, ITAR-Tass said.
	   The flow of gas was stopped, but the fire still spread over 5
hectares (12 acres) of forest, it said.

World Cup: Rieper heads Denmark to 1-0 victory

<TEXT>
	   LENS, France (AP) _ Defender Marc Rieper showed his strikers the
way to goal Friday by heading Denmark to a 1-0 World Cup victory
over Saudi Arabia.
	   After Ebbe Sand and Martin Jorgensen had both squandered easy
chances, the 30-year-old center-back powered home a header from
Brian Laudrup's cross in the 68th minute.
	   Michael Laudrup, Brian's older brother and the only current
Danish player to play in his team's only other World Cup appearance
12 years ago, made his 100th outing and was rewarded with victory
as captain of the lineup.
	   But the Danes should have won by a bigger margin against a Saudi
team who rarely threatened Peter Schmeichel in the Danish goal.
	   The Danes had a great chance to take an 18th minute lead when
Morten Wieghorst climbed above the Saudi defense to meet a free
kick and head the ball into the danger area. But Sand, with only
the 'keeper to beat, prodded the ball over the bar from eight
meters (yards).
	   Jorgensen wasted another good opening in the 32nd when Brian
Laudrup sliced open the Saudi defense with an angled, forward pass.
But the Udinese striker, well clear of the defense, fired well wide
from close range.
	   The Saudi defense failed to clear a free kick a minute later and
Rieper almost scrambled the ball in from four meters out.
	   The Saudi strikeforce made little impression in the opening 40
minutes of the game but Danish 'keeper Schmeichel made a diving,
fingertip save from a free kick by Saeed Owairan just before the
break, although the ball appeared to be going inches wide of the
post.
	   Another chance dropped to Jorgensen 13 minutes into the second
half when the Saudis were caught out by a leftwing cross. The ball
ran through to the striker who got in a left-foot shot which
'keeper Mohammed Al Deayea managed to block.
	   But the Saudi goalkeeper was beaten in the 68th minute after
punching out a cross. The ball was fed in to Jorgensen, who laid it
off to Brian Laudrup with the Saudi defense trying to catch the
Danes offside.
	   Laudrup floated in a cross from the right and Rieper climbed
above a defender to head home from eight meters (yards).
	   Michael Schjonberg forced Al Deayea to make a scrambling, diving
save and then substitute Per Frandsen fired across the face of the
goal as the Danes pressed for a secondother goal.
	   Lineups:
	   Denmark _ Peter Schmeichel, Michael Schjonberg, Marc Rieper, Jes
Hogh, Thomas Helveg, Michael Laudrup, Brian Laudrup (Jan Heintze,
84th), Soren Colding, Morten Wieghorst (Allan Nielsen, 66th), Ebbe
Sand, Martin Jorgensen (Per Frandsen, 74th).
	   Saudi Arabia _ Mohammed Al Deayea, Mohammed Al Jahani, Mohammed
Al Khilaiwi, Abdullah Zubromawi, Fuad Amin (Hamzah Saleh, 79th),
Ibrahim Al Shahrani, Sami Al Jaber (Youssef Al Thyniyan, 84th),
Saeed Owairan (Oubied Al Dosari, 79th), Hussain Sulimani, Khalid Al
Muwalid, Khamis Al Owairan.
	   Referee _ Javier Alberto Castrilli, Argentina.

	   BEGINNING last year the Public Services Department has been
collecting an average of RM1 million a month from those who had
taken study loans, revealed its deputy director-general II, Datuk
Khalil Hussain on Tuesday.
	   This is a tenfold increase over the department's average monthly
recovery figure of RM100,000 before 1997. An improvement, it cannot
be denied. But it is still insignificant, far, far insignificant
given the fact that the PSD has been giving out huge sums of money,
running into hundreds of million ringgit annually in loans to
students pursuing higher education since 1986. As Khalil, who heads
an internal PSD committee on loan recovery, said, each year the
department gives out more than RM500 million in loans and
scholarships.
	   Once only providing scholarships, the PSD began disbursing study
loans, repayable over a 25-year period after the students'
graduation, in the mid-1980s, during the last recession. But the
amount recovered monthly had been paltry. Contributing factors were
the hefty discounts given to high achievers and long loan repayment
tenure. The primary obstacle was, and still is, most students could
not be traced after they graduated. Since the department stepped up
its efforts like roping in the help of the Malaysian Student
Departments overseas and universities and chasing guarantors, it
had been able to track more of its student debtors, as reflected in
the increased monthly recollections. Still the PSD has to redouble
its efforts. For one, how long will, or rather can, the Government
continue to make annual provisions to fund student loans? For
another, the annual collections, if effectively, efficiently and
diligently carried out, would replenish a substantial portion of
the total annual loans, relieving partially the Government's
financial burden of annual allocations.
	   Perhaps the PSD should study and implement one strategy of
Mara's student loan recovery plan. That agency had a long history
of carrying in its books unrecovered loans similar to the more
recent experience of PSD.
	   But for the last few years, it has published names of borrowers
in the daily newspapers. Although it has yet to reveal the details
of the response to the publication of the names of defaulters,
reports indicate the recovery rate has increased substantially.
Embarrassment, it appears, can impose sufficient pressure on the
recalcitrant borrowers to own up and repay their debts. The PSD
could take the same road.
	   Khalil is on record as having said that the department, after
five reminders, would refer defaulters to the Attorney-General's
Chambers. The question is: how many of these people have been
charged in court? If tracing the defaulters is the problem, why not
go after the guarantors?
	   The department could give an incentive for the borrowers to come
forward.
	   It could offer discounts, as much as, say, 50 per cent, to those
who express intent to repay. The objective of the entire loan
recollection exercise should be to extract as much repayment as
possible from these graduates. Their higher education and
subsequent degrees were made possible by the taxpayer's money. They
should not be allowed to go scot- free, if only because present and
future loan seekers might be equally disinclined to discharge their
obligation when their turn comes. Clearly then, the PSD has the
moral and legal duty to devise a more effective way to recover such
loans, however difficult the task might be.

Dalai Lama joins celebrations at Swiss Tibetan monastery

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comment from Dalai Lama in 3rd thru 5th grafs. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   RIKON, Switzerland (AP) _ The exiled Tibetan spiritual leader
joined in a Swiss monastery's anniversary celebrations Friday,
consecrating 10 new prayer wheels.
	   The Tibet Institute in Rikon, near Zurich, which is celebrating
its 30th anniversary this year, becomes the first monastery in the
West to be blessed by the current Dalai Lama.
	   Speaking to reporters later, the Dalai Lama said he is convinced
that U.S. President Bill Clinton ``will raise the Tibetan issue''
during his visit to China later this month.
	   His return to Tibet would be ``possible in a few years, maybe
more,'' he added. ``The day of political changing will come.''
	   The Dalai Lama pointed to ``very positive changes'' in China,
especially in freedom of expression. Newspapers had hinted at a
readiness to ``open the door'' to him, he said.
	   Since fleeing Tibet to lead his nation from exile, the Dalai
Lama has been the sole voice and face of his people. His policy of
compromise and negotiation won world support and the 1989 Nobel
Peace prize.
	   Beijing, which says Tibet has always been part of China, sent
its army to the area in 1950. The Dalai Lama fled to India nine
years later during an abortive uprising against the Chinese, and
was followed by about 100,000 refugees.
	   In Tibetan Buddhism, turning the prayer wheel, a metal cylinder
containing a sacred verse, or mantra, is equivalent to reciting a
mantra.
	   The Rikon monastery has an abbot and seven monks, all of them
Tibetan. Consecrated in November 1968, it was named the Tibet
Institute to get around a Swiss law forbidding the founding of
monasteries.
	   Some 2,500 Tibetans live in Switzerland.

	   NEGRI Sembilan are cleaning house and the first to go is
Australian Scott Ollerenshaw.
	   It is learnt the Negri FA management committee have instructed
coach M.
	   Karathu to stop fielding Ollerenshaw who has earned their
dissatisfaction for only scoring once in the 13 League and two FA
Cup matches Negri have played so far.
	   Ollerenshaw did not make the trip to Malacca for Tuesday's FA
Cup second round return leg match and given the current scenario,
is unlikely to play for Negri again.
	   Although Negri cannot sign a replacement if they terminate
Ollerenshaw's contract, this is a risk they are willing to take.
	   The general feeling is that even without Ollerenshaw, Negri
can't do any worse and NSFA feel it would be better to rely on
local players for the remaining seven matches in Premier One.
	   But Ollerenshaw is not the only player who has faced action as
it is learnt that three local players - Faizal Zainal, Khairil
Zainal and Othman Katmon have been ordered to take a ``rest''.
	   According to a Bernama report, Negri FA Secretary Abdullah Sani
Abdul Hamid said the decision was taken during the management
committee meeting last Monday. ``Our only hope now is to at least
qualify for the Malaysia Cup competition,'' he said.
	   Karathu declined to comment about the status of the three local
players but confirmed the management have asked him not to use
Ollerenshaw.
	   ``I will abide by their decision and use local players for our
remaining matches.
	   ``Now that we have been eliminated from the FA Cup, we have to
concentrate on making the Malaysia Cup,'' said Karathu.
	   To do so, Negri have to finish in the top six of Premier One but
given the points separating the teams, the race for Malaysia Cup
berths could well go to the wire.

Iraq is replacing some 30 ambassadors
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq is replacing most of its foreign
ambassadors in a drive to improve its image, which has been
severely tarnished since its 1990 invasion of Kuwait, an official
said Friday.
	   A senior Iraqi official said the government plans to replace
some 30 if its 35 foreign ambassadors. The official spoke on
customary condition of anonymity.
	   Iraq's most influential newspaper, Babil, reported this week
that a number of Iraqi foreign diplomats have been recalled to
Baghdad, but it gave no details.
	   It is time that Iraqi embassies were ``injected with new blood
to destroy the wall of isolation the enemies have constructed
around Iraq,'' the newspaper said.
	   Iraq has been under sweeping U.N. economic sanctions since the
invasion.
	   Saddam's half brother, Barzan al-Tikriti, is one of the
ambassadors who has been recalled, the official said. Al-Tikriti
was Iraq's representative to the U.N. offices in Geneva.
	   Iraqi ambassadors to Yemen, Algeria, India, Tunisia, Pakistan,
Jordan, Russia, Malaysia were also among those recalled, the
official said.
	   The envoy to the Arab League, Nabil Najim, a close associate to
Saddam and a member of his Tikriti clan, has been appointed senior
undersecretary at the Foreign Ministry, the official said.
	   Iraq's ambassador to the United Nations, Nizar Hamdoun, may also
be replaced.
	   His term expires in September, but it is not clear if a
replacement has been chosen, the official said.
	   Iraq has not yet named the new ambassadors, but the official
said they include at least four big names in Iraq's
state-controlled media.
	   One such figure is Naji al-Hadithi, who orchestrated Iraq's
external information before and after the 1991 Gulf War. He lost
his post in 1995 but was rehabilitated last year and appointed
information adviser at the Culture and Information Ministry.
	   Other names include Salah al-Mukhtar, editor-in-chief of the
government newspaper al-Jumhouriya, Sabah Yassin, director-general
of the state radio and television, and Sami Saadoun, head of the
office of Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz.

Romania, US hope to increase cooperation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ In an effort to increase cooperation,
a group of Romanian and U.S. representatives agreed on 18 projects
Friday designed to boost investment and security in Romania.
	   ``All these projects aim to promote Romania's economic and
security interests,'' the Mediafax news agency quoted former U.S.
Defense Secretary William Perry as saying.
	   Among the most important projects is a plan to create a fund to
aid small and medium companies in Romania.
	   Other proposed projects focus on areas such as agriculture,
banking, telecommunications, energy and foreign policy. They will
be submitted to the governments of both countries for adoption.
	   The group started its work Thursday. Next week, the American
delegation is set to meet with President Emil Constantinescu and
Prime Minister Radu Vasile.
	   Constantinescu said Romania needs more American investment and
pleaded in a press conference for ``consistent U.S. economic and
financial support.''

U.S., Britain asked apartheid government to keep chemical weapons

 &UR; EDS: RECASTS with info that U.S. and Britain asked apartheid
government to withhold technology; New overline &QL; 
 &UR; By PAUL HARRIS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ The United States and Britain
asked the apartheid government to withhold its biological warfare
technology from the majority black government that was expected to
succeed it, a former government official said Friday.
	   Former Surgeon-General Niel Knobel confirmed under questioning
that the two countries made a joint diplomatic overture to the
apartheid government shortly before the first all-race vote in 1994
that elected President Nelson Mandela's African National Congress,
said an official of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which
is investigating apartheid-era human rights abuses.
	   Knobel said the Americans and British did not want the
technology to go to the ANC government and asked the apartheid
government to destroy its stockpiles, media reports on Friday said.
	   Knobel said that apartheid's last president. F.W. DeKlerk, met
with Mandela who agreed to kill the program.
	   It was not clear how much the U.S. and Britain knew about the
program that was publicly described for the first time in detail
this week before the commission.
	   Mind-boggling projects aimed at preserving white rule were
hatched and nurtured in secret laboratories, according to the
apartheid-era army scientists who testified.
	   They described plans to make poisoned chocolates, to find a
germ-warfare agent that would kill only blacks and to give Mandela
brain damage.
	   Poisons were made and passed on to apartheid assassins, referred
to in secret documents only by their code names ``Chris'' and
``Koos.''
	   One scientist, Schalk van Rensburg, testified that a shirt laced
with poison had been given to an ANC activist. The target, who was
not identified, unknowingly gave the deadly garment to a friend who
then died.
	   Retired Archbishop Desmond Tutu said this week's testimony was
the most shocking he has heard as chairman of the Truth Commission,
set up in 1995 to heal racial divisions.
	   ``Here are people of high intelligence, coldly and clinically in
white laboratory coats, working on things they know were meant to
be instruments of destroying people,'' Tutu told The Associated
Press on Thursday.
	   The scientists explained that they were virtually brainwashed by
government propaganda in the 1980s that South Africa was on the
brink of falling to communism and black rule.
	   ``That was the psychosis that prevailed,'' Daan Goosen, who
headed a covert biological research laboratory, recalled Thursday.
	   ``I was not thinking rationally at the time,'' he said. ``Today,
I know I was wrong. You can't do that to people, it is just not
justifiable.''
	   Scientists who had any doubts about their work could have been
killed for breaking ranks, van Rensburg claimed.
	   ``We had been told in no uncertain terms, if you let the side
down you are dead,'' van Rensburg said.
	   Goosen said the biological and chemical weapons program was
controlled by Dr. Wouter Basson, who will be forced to testify,
according to a ruling on Friday by the Truth Commission.
	   Dressed in a pinstriped white shirt, Basson sat grim-faced while
the panel rejected his lawyer's appeal to postpone his appearance
because it could prejudice a possible criminal case against him.
	   Basson allegedly produced and sold ecstasy and other drugs,
officials have said.
	   The Truth Commission, established to help promote
reconciliation, can grant amnesty to those who fully confess to
politically motivated apartheid-era human rights abuses.
	   The hearings were adjourned until next Thursday, when Knobel is
expected to finish testimony he began Friday. Knobel said he
thought Basson's program was developing conventional biological and
chemical weapons, and he claimed to know nothing about the poison
projects.
	   Basson is likely to be called next week.

Man cleared of murder after 23 years in prison
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With AP Photo LON118, LON120 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A 69-year-old man who spent 23 years in prison for
a murder he always denied committing was cleared Friday when the
Court of Appeals ruled that the victim might have died a natural
death.
	   The judges expressed regret that Patrick Nicholls, who served
the longest prison term ever in a British case of miscarried
justice, had spent ``such a very long time in jail.''
	   Nicholls was imprisoned in 1975 for the murder of Gladys Heath,
a 74-year-old family friend found dead at her home in Worthing,
southern England.
	   Nicholls, who insisted he found Mrs. Heath at the foot of her
stairs, has been free on bail since March, when new evidence
indicated she could have died naturally.
	   He broke down in tears at the Law Courts as Lord Justice Roch
read out the ruling of the three appeals judges.
	   ``We allow this appeal because the pathological evidence that
this was an unlawful killing and that natural causes could be
excluded has now been shown to be unreliable,'' Roch said.
	   ``In allowing this appeal, we would wish to express this court's
great regret that as a result of what has now been shown to be
flawed pathological evidence the appellant was wrongly convicted
and has spent such a very long time in jail.''
	   Roch made the announcement after hearing from the prosecution's
lawyer, Bruce Houlder, who said, ``Nobody now could be sure that
Mr. Nicholls was responsible for the murder.''
	   At the time of the trial, two pathologists concluded Mrs. Heath
died of a heart attack after being suffocated and severely beaten
in the face.
	   But a new review of the case found that the facial injuries were
trivial and probably caused by the fall, which likely was prompted
by the heart attack.
	   Nicholls, seated in a wheelchair when he spoke to reporters
later, broke down again as he said: ``I would like to thank my
mother, Ida, for the help she gave me in these past 23 years. She
died a year ago.''
	   Nicholls' common-law wife also died while he was in prison.
	   ``I always thought I would get out sometime,'' he said.
``Always. Somehow or other, I still retained a little faith in the
system. I have lost it many, many times, of course. But lurking at
the back of my mind was always the belief I would get out some
time.''
	   ``It has been a long time. I think I will have a few pints and
think things over,'' he said.

Swiss Jewish newspapers denounce U.S.-based report for absurdity
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALEXANDER G. HIGGINS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ A Swiss Jewish newspaper Friday labeled as absurd
a report asserting wartime Switzerland was ``saturated'' with
pro-Nazi groups.
	   Author Alan Morris Schom ``deliberately suppressed the strong
anti-Nazi movement in Switzerland,'' said the Israelitisches
Wochenblatt.
	   The paper joined the country's other Jewish weekly in attacking
the report issued Wednesday in New York by the Simon Wiesenthal
Center. The Basel-based Juedische Rundschau on Thursday described
the study as full of ``exaggerations and falsifications.''
	   The Israelitisches Wochenblatt, published in Zurich, said the
report made it easy for nationalist Swiss to reject efforts to make
good on any wrongs committed during World War II.
	   It is true that the Nazis had a well-organized network of
largely secret organizations in neutral Switzerland preparing to
include the country in the Third Reich, said the newspaper. But the
movement had to be put in proportion.
	   ``The Swiss Nazis were weak in numbers,'' said the weekly. ``In
the parliament in Bern they had exactly one seat for four years.''
	   ``If Swiss society were really so saturated with Nazis, that
would have had to be reflected in parliamentary elections,'' it
added.
	   The distortions undermined legitimate efforts to root out
anti-Semitism in Switzerland, the newspaper said.
	   For example, it said, it would be worthwhile examining more
closely Schom's repetition of the long-standing allegation that the
Swiss government during World War II had an anti-Jewish policy.
	   ``Because of the absurdity of the other allegations, however,
this will certainly not happen,'' the weekly said.
	   The Juedische Rundschau said Schom's report starts with errors
in the first paragraph, which incorrectly states that the Swiss
cantons (states) in World War II numbered 21, when there were
actually 22.
	   ``So many details are presented painfully wrong,'' said the
Juedische Rundschau, which earlier this year led Swiss Jewish
criticism of a report by Schom asserting Switzerland put Jewish
refugees in slave labor camps.
	   A number of Jews who lived in refugee camps said that for the
most part they suffered no more than the Swiss themselves and that
the country was a safe haven for many on a hostile continent.
	   On Wednesday, the U.S. State Department disputed the charges in
Schom's report, noting that Switzerland provided shelter for 50,000
Jewish refugees.

	   THE Negri Sembilan FA established an independent three-man board
of inquiry to investigate problems affecting their team's poor run
in the Premier One League.
	   FA secretary Abdullah Sani Abdul Hamid said the board, headed by
FA vice-president Ahmad Ali, who is Negri Sembilan State
Development Corporation deputy general manager, will interview all
players and team officials for inputs.
	   Two other members of the board are Port Dickson District Officer
Hassan Nawawi Abdul Rahman and lawyer Tan Foong Luen.
	   ``The inquiry will start immediately and we expect them to
submit their report to the FA management committee by next week to
enable us to initiate measures to check the slide,'' he said in
Seremban yesterday.
	   Abdullah Sani said he did not discount the possibility of the FA
revamping the whole team if the board felt it would be good for the
team.
	   The Deers are currently lying in sixth position in the league
with 18 points after 13 matches. To make matters worse, they were
shown the exit in the FA Cup by second division outfit Malacca on
5-2 aggregate on Tuesday.
	   The problem started when banners criticising Perak coach M.
Karathu first surfaced during the team's away match in Kuantan
which Perak lost 1- 2 and the banner appeared again during their
home match against Pahang last week.
	   It was also reported last week that some players had petitioned
for Karathu's removal prompting the FA to issue a stern warning to
the players and officials to refrain from indulging in such ploys.
	   ``We would rather have a bunch of young and dedicated players
who are committed towards ensuring the team's success instead of
fielding primadonas who are out to destroy the team,'' he said.
	   He said although the team had ``grounded'' several first team
players who lacked commitment, the FA was not afraid to sack
others, including its imports, who did not live up to expectation.

Major powers deny loans to India, Pakistan

 &UR; Eds: SUBS penultimate graf to CLARIFY Russia did not go along with
airline ban. &QL; 
 &UR; With BC-Kosovo-Allies
 &UR; By BARRY SCHWEID &QC;

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The world's leading industrial nations, acting on
a U.S. proposal, decided Friday to deny nonhumanitarian loans to
India and Pakistan in retaliation for their nuclear tests.
	   The action came at a meeting of U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright and seven foreign ministers on the nuclear
crisis in South Asia and ethnic turmoil in Kosovo.
	   A communique approved by the eight countries _ the United
States, Britain, France, Germany, Japan, Canada, Italy and Russia _
also urged India and Pakistan to halt their testing programs and
not to deploy nuclear weapons on their missiles.
	   Additionally, they were urged to deal with the ``root causes''
of tensions between them, especially over Kashmir, the mostly
Muslim enclave that straddles their border.
	   Albright also urged the other nations to refrain from nuclear
cooperation with India and Pakistan. The senior U.S. officials,
speaking on condition of anonymity, said the two countries would be
denied such help.
	   The joint steps were taken as India and Pakistan faltered in
moves to hold negotiations later in the month. Senior British and
American officials said the effort had collapsed in disagreements
over how to proceed.
	   ``The recent nuclear tests have created an atmosphere of
regional instability which will undermine the region's
attractiveness to both foreign and domestic investment, damaging
business confidence and the prospect for economic growth,'' the
communique said.
	   The United States has imposed economic sanctions, under U.S.
law, against both countries. The eight foreign ministers, as a
group, said all countries ``should act as they see fit to
demonstrate their displeasure and address their concerns to India
and Pakistan.''
	   ``Our meeting sends the message that the world community is
united not just in outrage and dismay but in action,'' Albright
said, referring to nuclear weapons tests conducted last month by
the two countries.
	   The eight nations, four of whom are nuclear powers, pledged
themselves to ``systematic and progressive efforts to reduce
nuclear weapons globally with the ultimate goal of eliminating
those weapons.'' A Japanese foreign ministry official said the
pledge was the result of pressure by his government.
	   ``We all, nuclear weapons states and non-nuclear weapon states
alike,'' the communique said, ``reiterate our determination to
fulfill the commitments relating to nuclear disarmament.''
	   By choosing to test, India and Pakistan have diminished their
security and damaged their prestige, Albright said at a meeting
with the foreign ministers.
	   Calling for unity, Albright said relations with India and
Pakistan ``must not drift back into business as usual.'' One way
she proposed was coordinating votes at world financial institutions
to postpone consideration of loans except for those ``that meet
basic human needs.''
	   Last week, the World Bank postponed two loans worth more than
dlrs 206 million to India, bringing to more than dlrs 1 billion the
amount delayed because of the South Asian nation's nuclear tests
last month.
	   The South Asian nuclear crisis competed with the ethnic
bloodshed in the Balkans for the attention of the foreign
ministers.
	   They called on Yugoslavia to let up its military pressure on
ethnic Albanians in Kosovo and ``make rapid progress'' in talks
with their leaders.
	   The United States, Britain, Canada, France, Germany and Italy
said they would move to ban flights of commercial Yugoslav airlines
to and from their countries and Yugoslavia. Japan said it would
consider going along but Russia said it did not agree to such a
move. European Union approval would be required for implementation
of such a move by its members, British officials said.

Dalai Lama joins celebrations at Swiss Tibetan monastery
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIKON, Switzerland (AP) _ The Dalai Lama joined in a Swiss
monastery's anniversary celebrations Friday, consecrating 10 new
prayer wheels.
	   The Tibet Institute in Rikon, near Zurich, which is celebrating
its 30th anniversary this year, becomes the first monastery in the
West to be blessed by the current Dalai Lama.
	   Speaking to reporters later, the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader
said he is convinced that U.S. President Bill Clinton ``will raise
the Tibetan issue'' during his visit to China later this month.
	   His return to Tibet would be ``possible in a few years, maybe
more,'' he added. ``The day of political changing will come.''
	   The Dalai Lama pointed to ``very positive changes'' in China,
especially in freedom of expression. Newspapers had hinted at a
readiness to ``open the door'' to him, he said.
	   Since fleeing Tibet to lead his nation from exile, the Dalai
Lama has been the sole voice and face of his people. His policy of
compromise and negotiation won him world support and the 1989 Nobel
Peace prize.
	   The Rikon monastery has an abbot and seven monks, all of them
Tibetan. Consecrated in November 1968, it was named the Tibet
Institute to get around a Swiss law forbidding the founding of
monasteries.
	   Some 2,500 Tibetans live in Switzerland.

	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Albania said Friday it will offer NATO
airspace and airports for maneuvers in the country aimed at
deterring further violence in Serbia's adjoining secessionist
province of Kosovo.
	   But neighboring Macedonia, whose prime minister is scheduled to
visit Albania this weekend, said it had not yet received an
official request from NATO for exercises and would not allow its
territory to be used for military activity against any neighboring
country.
	   Macedonia's Foreign Minister Blagoj Handziski made the comments
when asked by reporters about NATO plans _ announced Thursday _ for
simulated air raids in Albania and Macedonia to deter further
violence in Kosovo.
	   Yugoslavia, which consists of Serbia and Montenegro, adjoins
Macedonia.
	   Albania's Prime Minister Fatos Nano, who has lobbied for weeks
for NATO intervention to stop Kosovo violence spiraling out of
control and engulfing the region, announced after a Cabinet meeting
that Albania would offer NATO air space and airfields.

	   MORE than 120 participants who attended the Malaysia British
Assurance Regional Marketing Convention at the Regency Hotel in
Port Dickson, Negri Sembilan, recently not only enjoyed the weekend
but also pooled their resources for a worthy cause.
	   Agents from Negri Sembilan, Malacca and Johor enjoyed a variety
of stage shows and games.
	   However, they did not forget the less fortunate and raised
RM1,140 to assist six-year-old Al-Zikri Abdul Karim whose plight
was highlighted in the New Straits Times on May 21.
	   Al-Zikri needs RM25,000 for surgery to correct severe breathing
difficulties caused by a complex congenital heart lesion.
	   The surgery is to be held at the Ampang Puteri Hospital.
	   MBA regional manager (southern branch) Gan Chin Chia said the
money was raised from the sale of tickets for their hamper lucky
draw.
	   He said it was the least the agents could do to assist the less
fortunate.
	   The cheque was presented by an agent K.K. Lim who won the lucky
draw that night, to New Straits Times journalist Patrick Sennyah.
	   Lim was accompanied by Gan and MBA general manager Mei York
Liang.

	   ELECTRONIC commerce (e-commerce) is increasingly being
recognised as the medium that will revolutionise global trade and
its facilitation system.
	   The power of e-commerce enables a global electronic marketplace
that will increase efficiency, reduce the need for capital and
reduce costs for all sectors including governments, businesses and
consumers, said United Parcel Service (UPS)'s Asia-Pacific regional
director for global facilitation and Customs operations James Goh.
	   ``Creating an environment that allows e-commerce to flourish
will make it a major force for economic growth among Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation (Apec) economies in the 21st century,'' Goh
told a Press briefing in Kuala Lumpur last Friday. E-commerce
applications in global trade, security and barrier issues were some
of the main issues discussed at the Apec Customs- Industry Dialogue
(Acid '98).
	   Acid '98, which carried the theme Meeting the Challenges of the
Next Millennium, was held in Kuala Lumpur. The two-day event ended
on Tuesday.
	   It served to present a common position of the Customs industry
to important international organisations that play a significant
role in global trade. Proposals and recommendations that are in
line with the goals and ideals of Apec were also aligned to bodies
such as the World Customs Organisation, the World Trade
Organisation, the United Nations Conference for Trade and
Development, International Chambers of Commerce and the Asean Free
Trade Area (AFTA) for consideration.
	   Acid is an annual meeting of customs and global trade experts
held under the auspices of the Apec Sub-committee on Customs
Procedures (Apec-SSCP).
	   During the briefing, a cheque worth US$60,000 (RM234,000) from
UPS was presented to the National Chamber of Commerce and Industry
of Malaysia (NCCIM) in conjunction with Acid '98.

	   Q: I AM 20 years old and have these tiny warts that look like
pimples growing under my armpits all the time. It has a somewhat
medium-hard pinkish surface with milky yellowish contents and is
growing in clusters.
	   This causes my armpit to be dark brown in colour and it looks
filthy. I am worried because these warts can hurt. I have burst
them regularly but this only causes even more to grow and leaves
scars.
	   I also have yellowish discharge on my panties everyday which
changes to light-green. Sometimes it becomes even darker. I have
oral sex with my boyfriend. I have read that these symptoms might
lead to sexually- transmitted diseases. Is this true?
	   A: IT sounds as if you are suffering from an infection caused by
a virus known as Molluscum contagiosum. This virus spreads through
direct contact and can even spread through clothes. You must be
very careful to not pass it on to those you come into close contact
with.
	   The medical treatment is to freeze-dry the little eruptions and
thereby kill the virus. This process is known as cryotherapy.
Sometimes, the tops are surgically removed.
	   You can boost your immune system's ability to fight viruses with
echinacea. Anti-viral herbs such as thuja can be consumed or
painted directly onto the eruption. Thuja can be combined with
calendula extract and tea tree oil for an antiseptic and healing
wash.
	   You may be suffering from a sexually-transmitted disease. Both
you and your boyfriend must see a doctor for a proper diagnosis.
Echinacea and other immune-enhancing herbs may be of benefit, but
if the discharge is due to gonorrhoea (a type of STD) you both need
a course of antibiotic treatment.
	   Your discharge may however be due to an infection in your
vagina, in which case herbal medicine may be of benefit. You need
to discuss this with a health professional.

German flag taken down at EU summit site due to misspelling
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CARDIFF, Wales (AP) _ A huge flag hanging outside City Hall to
mark Germany's participation in the upcoming European Union summit
was taken down Friday after eagle-eyed Germans noticed
``Deutschland'' was misspelled on it.
	   The 30-foot-high (9-meter-high) banner instead spelled it
``Deutchsland.''
	   German Chancellor Helmut Kohl is among the European heads of
government arriving this weekend for the gathering in the Welsh
capital.
	   Flags from all 15 participating nations had been hoisted outside
City Hall, which will serve as the main summit venue.
	   ``We have now removed the banner and will be replacing it as
soon as possible,'' said a spokeswoman for the British Foreign
Office, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``We apologized and are
grateful that the mistake was spotted''.
	   But the error left at least one German fuming.
	   ``This is absolutely pathetic,'' said Jorg Mathias, a lecturer
at Cardiff University. ``It just goes to show when it comes to
Europe, they don't know what they're talking about. The summit
should never have been held here in the first place if they can't
get a simple thing like the spelling of a country right''.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Wed. - Ten schools were among the 5,133 premises
issued with compounds for breeding the aedes mosquito in the first
five months of this year, Housing and Local Government Minister
Datuk Dr Ting Chew Peh said today.
	   He said most of the compounds were issued to construction sites,
households, factories, commercial premises and squatters. The
Government collected RM369,000 in fines. A total of 826,695
premises were inspected.
	   ``We also took firm action by issuing 44 stop-work orders to
construction sites, mainly in Selangor and Federal Territory,'' he
told reporters before his Ministry's post-Cabinet meeting.
	   He said there were 6,344 dengue cases from January to May,
compared to 6,523 in the corresponding period last year, a drop of
2.7 per cent. Five people died compared to 18 last year.
	   States which showed a significant drop in cases were Selangor
(62 per cent drop from 1,911 last year to 717 this year), Penang
(58.8 per cent down from 373 to 156), Perak (40 per cent decline
from 482 to 269) and Federal Territory (6.1 per cent fall from
2,294 to 2,153).
	   States which showed a marked increase were Sarawak (393 per cent
up from 115 last year to 588 this year), Terengganu (322 per cent
rise from 81 to 342), Kedah (201 per cent hike from 75 to 226) and
Malacca (133 per cent climb from 93 to 217).
	   Ting said the overall drop of 2.7 per cent was ``not
satisfactory'' and urged the States to step up fogging, education
and cleanliness campaigns.
	   They are to submit reports to the Ministry every two weeks.

World Cup: Rieper header gives Denmark 1-0 victory
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS detail &QL; 
 &UR; By MIKE CORDER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LENS, France (AP) _ Defender Marc Rieper showed his strikers the
way to goal Friday, heading Denmark to a 1-0 victory over Saudi
Arabia in their opening World Cup Group C match.
	   Rieper rose unmarked in the box in the 68th minute to secure the
points for the Danes in a scrappy match that Denmark should have
won by a wider margin.
	   Denmark dominated possession in the first half but could not
convert its superiority into a goal before 38,140 fans at the
41,275-seater Stade Felix Bollaert stadium.
	   Brian Laudrup and his older brother Michael caused problems for
the Saudi defense with quick passes and inventive running off the
ball, but nobody could provide the finishing touch and as the half
wore on Saudi Arabia grew in confidence and began to pose a threat.
	   Early in the match the Saudis continually squandered possession
with inaccurate passing seemingly taking time to warm up on a cold
day in this northern French coal mining town.
	   Denmark's best chance to open the scoring came when a flicked on
pass fell to Ebbe Sand in the 18th minute but his close range shot
flew over the bar.
	   Jorgensen wasted another good opening in the 32nd when Brian
Laudrup sliced open the Saudi defense with an angled, forward pass.
But the Udinese striker, well clear of the defense, fired well wide
from close range.
	   In the 36th minute, Rieper headed on a long throw-in by Martin
Jorgensen and then pounced on the ball as it deflected off Michael
Laudrup's chest, but Saudi goalkeeper Mohammed al Deayea got down
quickly to save Rieper's shot.
	   The Saudis' first attempt on goal did not arrive until the 26th
minute when Ibrahim al Shahrani's long range shot flew high and
wide of Peter Schmeichel's goal.
	   But it was the Saudi's who came closest to breaking the deadlock
before the break.
	   From a 42nd minute free kick just outside the area, Saeed
Owairan touched the ball to Khalid al Muwalid who stopped it for
Owairan to shoot. The curling left foot effort looked destined to
creep just inside the post but Schmeichel, at full stretch, tipped
the shot wide.
	   Denmark slowed the game down at the beginning of the second half
but still struggled to find a path through Saudi Arabia's defense.
	   Saudi resistance finally looked to have broken open in the 58th
minute as the ball caromed around the packed Saudi area, but when
it finally fell kindly to Jorgensen, goalkeeper Al Deayea saved his
shot.
	   Denmark finally found a way to the net in the 68th minute when
Brian Laudrup crossed from the right to Rieper in the center who
headed past Al Deayea.
	   The chance was gifted to the Danes by some sloppy Saudi
defending. At least one defender played Jorgensen. The Dane made
the most of it, passing to Laudrup who fed Rieper.
	   Saudi Arabia nearly pulled back a quick equalizer but Ibrahim al
Shahrani's flicked header drifted wide after a good cross from the
right by Mohammed al Jahani.
	   Although Saudi Arabia pressed hard late on, the Danish defense
held firm to secure the points.
	   Denmark and Saudi Arabia both were making their second
appearances in the World Cup finals. The countries reached the last
16 in their previous visits to the finals, Denmark in 1986 and
Saudi Arabia in 1994.
	   Lineups:
	   Denmark _ Peter Schmeichel, Michael Schjonberg, Marc Rieper, Jes
Hogh, Thomas Helveg, Michael Laudrup, Brian Laudrup (Jan Heintze,
84th), Soren Colding, Morten Wieghorst (Allan Nielsen, 66th), Ebbe
Sand, Martin Jorgensen (Per Frandsen, 74th).
	   Saudi Arabia _ Mohammed Al Deayea, Mohammed Al Jahani, Mohammed
Al Khilaiwi, Abdullah Zubromawi, Fuad Amin (Hamzah Saleh, 79th),
Ibrahim Al Shahrani, Sami Al Jaber (Youssef Al Thyniyan, 84th),
Saeed Owairan (Oubied Al Dosari, 79th), Hussain Sulimani, Khalid Al
Muwalid, Khamis Al Owairan.
	   Referee _ Javier Alberto Castrilli, Argentina.

At least eight die in Turkish floods
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SANLIURFA, Turkey (AP) _ At least eight people died Friday when
they were swept away by floods driven by torrential rains in a
village in this southeastern province, officials said.
	   Up to 20 other people were missing, feared drowned in rushing
rainwater in the village of Gozeli, village alderman Cuma Gocmen
told ATV television. Six of the dead were students on an outing
near the village, he said.
	   Sanliurfa is some 820 kilometers (490 miles) southeast of the
capital, Ankara.
	   Last month, floods sweeping northwestern Turkey killed some 20
people, inundated thousands of homes and destroyed bridges, roads
and railway lines.

	   YOGYAKARTA (JP): The Armed Forces (ABRI) needs to reduce its
political role to accelerate the country's fledgling democratic
reform, a military observer said.
	   ``ABRIs sociopolitical role must be immediately reviewed to
smooth the passage of democratic reform in Indonesia,'' Yahya
Muhaimin of Gadjah Mada University in Yogyakarta told reporters.
	   ABRIs dual function allows it to actively engage in social and
political affairs, along with its traditional role in security and
defense.
	   Yahya said that a downsizing of ABRIs sociopolitical role was a
prerequisite for democratic reform, and said that it was now time
for the Armed Forces to grant civilians political freedom.
	   The head of the University's Center for Security and Peace
Studies said that ABRI should loosen its grip on politics in
response to popular demands that civilians take over the running of
the country.
	   He said that ABRI must also abandon its security approach,
through which they justify using stern measures to maintain
national stability, or risk losing popular support.
	   Nevertheless, Yahya commended ABRI for showing commitment to the
process of democratization and allowing the number of seats which
it is allocated in the House of Representatives to be reduced from
100 to 75.
	   Separately in Jakarta, political scientist Ryaas Rasyid said
that ABRIs political role should be reduced in response to the
snowballing reform movement.
	   He said that steps to do this could begin in the House of
Representatives (DPR) by further reducing the number of seats
allocated to ABRI to 50.
	   Ryaas, who is also rector of the Institute for Public
Administration, said the idea had been included in a proposed draft
version of the new law on the role and function of the House of
Representatives/People's Consultative Assembly (MPR).
	   Ryaas heads a seven member team which is working on drafts for
three political laws covering general elections, political parties
and the role and function of the House and the MPR.
	   However, Indria Samego from the National Institute of Sciences
(LIPI) rejected any suggestion that House seats be allocated to the
Armed Forces without a popular vote.
	   ``To be a House member, one must be elected through polls,''
Indria said in a discussion held by the Center for Information and
Development Studies.
	   In early 1995, former president Soeharto commissioned LIPI to
carry out research into ways of improving general elections and
ABRIs sociopolitical role.
	   LIPI then produced a report which said that ABRI needed to
minimize its role in politics to allow democracy to flourish and
political reform to take place.

yesterday said: ``We have got nothing against the tournament but

Patten says police reform `central' to Northern Ireland agreement
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SHAWN POGATCHNIK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Reform of Northern Ireland's
predominantly Protestant police force will be central to making the
peace agreement work, the politician charged with the task said
Friday.
	   Chris Patten, Britain's last governor of Hong Kong, said his
eight-member Independent Commission on Policing for Northern
Ireland was confident of meeting its mid-1999 deadline.
	   The government-appointed commission is supposed to recommend
ways of making the 13,000-strong Royal Ulster Constabulary more
acceptable to the north's minority Catholics, many of whom view it
with suspicion or outright contempt.
	   Plans for police reform formed a particularly emotive part of
the Belfast agreement, which was struck April 10 among eight
parties and the British and Irish governments.
	   While many pro-British Protestants want the police force
retained as is, militant Catholic supporters of the IRA-allied Sinn
Fein party demand its abolition.
	   ``All of us on the commission believe that the Good Friday
agreement represents a wonderful opportunity for Northern Ireland.
We want to see the promise of that agreement fulfilled,'' Patten,
an English Catholic who was a minister in Britain's Northern
Ireland Office in the early 1980s, said at a press conference.
	   ``We all want to see a Northern Ireland that is both peaceful
and prosperous. We see the future policing arrangements as a
central issue, as the agreement itself makes clear. And we're
profoundly aware of the responsibility that's been placed upon
us.''
	   Patten was accompanied by all seven of his colleagues, among
them two law-enforcement experts from the United States _ Gerald
Lynch, president of John Jay College in New York, and Kathleen
O'Toole, secretary for public safety in Massachusetts.
	   But they all declined to answer questions on specific
contentious policing issues, such as whether the ``Royal'' in the
force's name should be retained and whether its members should
operate unarmed.
	   Patten said it would be ``criminally irresponsible'' for the
commission to talk in specific terms before its report is
published.

	   AY back in the 70s, when I was a young Social Welfare Officer in
a northern State, a pretty Malay girl came to see me. She said that
she was from Kuala Lumpur and came from a respectable family.
	   She was studying in one of the colleges and was six months
pregnant.
	   After being jilted by her boyfriend, she had tried abortion but
it had been unsuccessful.
	   She felt that a Social Welfare Office away from her home was the
right place to seek help. She asked me to place her with a family
just to have the baby delivered and given away, after which, she
would go back and continue her studies.
	   She pleaded with me not to ask her more information, especially
about her family. She told me to just call her ``Ana''.
	   Although I had dealt with juvenile delinquents, underaged
prostitutes, wayward children, marital problems, etc, this was the
first case of its kind that I had encountered.
	   I rang up an official at my headquarters in Kuala Lumpur for
advice. The reply was ``Please try your best to assist the girl''.
	   After several enquiries, I placed her with my friend's family.
As luck would have it, a Government official who had been married
for 10 years but not yet blessed with a child was looking for a
baby to adopt.
	   A doctor who examined his wife and him confirmed that there was
nothing wrong with them.
	   Like some men who need to prove their virility, the husband
started to court a young girl with the view of marrying her
secretly in Thailand.
	   However, after our counselling, he was prepared to adopt the
girl's baby. He still loved his wife who was caring and faithful.
	   His wife was very happy as the husband had abandoned temporarily
his plan to take a second wife.
	   Actually, he was not keen to take a second wife because of the
accompanying responsibilities.
	   So the couple found a new common interest to occupy their time.
After getting a written consent from the girl to give her baby up
for adoption, they took great care of her, giving her the best
medical treatment and showering her with nourishing food and
vitamins.
	   Three months later a healthy baby boy was delivered and they
looked after him as if the child was their own.
	   As for the girl, they nursed her with traditional and modern
medicine during her confinement period.
	   After her confinement, she was as beautiful as when she came to
see me.
	   Before leaving for home in Kuala Lumpur, the couple gave her
RM700 as a token of their gratitude.
	   When the boy was two years old, the adoptive mother became
pregnant thus bringing more joy to the couple. A pretty girl was
born to them a year later, and before I was transferred to another
State, another boy and a girl were added to their family.
	   They treated the adopted boy and their other natural children
equally and showered them with love, care and affection.
	   The children are doing very well in their respective posts in
Kuala Lumpur and every now and then I would receive postcards or
presents from the parents.
	   The adopted boy got married last year and is going to be a
father soon.
	   This phenomenon of getting children after adopting one is known
to some people as berjangkit. I, myself, do not know if it is true,
but in this particular case, it had worked out very well.
	   Looking back on what I had done, I feel happy that I had helped
a young girl in trouble. As she did not want to divulge her
identity, my friends and I respected her wish to the last.
	   The girl later on married someone in high position and has had
several children. She keeps in touch with me through postcards in
which she tells me how happy and grateful she was for all the help
that had been extended to her.
	   She said that Allah had sent her to some selfless and caring
people and she has been praying hard that Allah would give guidance
to such kind people and forgive the sinners because as the Malay
proverb goes Bumi mana yang tidak di timpa hujan, laut mana yang
tidak berombak.

	   JAKARTA (JP): Former minister/state secretary Moerdiono was
grilled by the Attorney General's Office yesterday over a 1994 scam
in which state land was used as collateral on an Rp 90 billion loan
for the construction of condominiums in Kemayaron, Central Jakarta.
	   Spokesman for the Attorney General's Office Barman Zahir said
Moerdiono was questioned for over two hours by a team led by the
head of intelligence operations Sudibyo Saleh.
	   Barman said Moerdiono maintained his innocence throughout the
session.
	   The case revolves around a 25,000 square meter plot of land in
Kemayaron which was allegedly put up as collateral for the
development of condominiums.
	   The state land falls under the authority of Kemayoran Area
Development Board (BPKK), which minister/state secretary Moerdiono
chaired.
	   A board executive, Hindro T. Soemardjan, and real estate tycoon
Seno Margono allegedly used the land as collateral.
	   ``I never knew the land had been used as collateral,'' Moerdiono
said, as quoted by Barman.
	   Seno, director of PT Duta Adi Putra, is being charged with
illegally converting the status of the land from state asset to
personal asset to acquire the loans.
	   Seno, 38, is the son-in-law of businessman Hendra Rahardja, the
brother of notorious fugitive Eddy Tansil, the petrochemical
businessman who escaped from jail two years ago.
	   Tansil was sentenced to 20 years in jail for defrauding Bapindo
Bank of US$620 million. He is still at large.
	   It is unclear if Moerdiono will be summoned for further
questioning.
	   ``It depends on how the investigation develops,'' Barman said,
adding that the sole suspect in the case was Seno, although Hindro
had also been questioned several times.
	   Barman said Moerdiono was dressed in a white short-sleeved shirt
with blue pants. He came alone. The chauffeur of his blue Volvo met
him at the door at the end of the questioning.
	   ``He arrived 15 minutes before the questioning began at 9
a.m.,'' Barman said.
	   Corrupt
	   Also yesterday, activists and human rights figures launched
another independent commission under the name of ``Indonesian
Corruption Watch'' to fight for the recovery of assets allegedly
obtained illegally by the Soeharto family.
	   The group is the second of its kind to form in reaction to
public pressure to investigate the fortune accumulated by the
ousted president and his family during the 32 years he was in
power.
	   Board members of the new commission include Trisakti University
dean of law and former justice Adi Andojo, the Indonesian Legal Aid
Foundation director Bambang Widjojanto, PDBI executive director
Christianto Wibisono and noted lawyer Todung Mulya Lubis.
	   The group's operations director Teten Masduki said that
Soeharto's assets should be reclaimed through a political mechanism
so that the process had a strong legal basis.
	   The group's statement also said the upcoming extraordinary
session of the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) at the end of
the year should ratify a decree on reclaiming the Soeharto family
wealth.
	   Todung tried to reassure foreign investors and the public that
the investigation would be lucid in its attempt to recover stolen
state wealth without infringing on the private property of others.
	   ``We don't intend to destroy existing companies but simply to
return assets and equities which belong to the country.'' Todung
explained.
	   Meanwhile, a group of 18 University of Indonesia law school
students met with Attorney General Soedjono C. Atmonegoro at the
latter's office yesterday to press for a clean and professional
judiciary system.
	   After almost one hour of frank discussions, Soedjono signed a
large white banner inscribed with anti-corruption slogans which the
students had brought with them.

	   USTRALIAN Steve Darby is to take over from K. Sukumaran as coach
of the Johor Premier Two team.
	   The 44-year old Darby, who has vast experience in Australian
including a five-year stint as a development officer with the
Australian Soocer Federation and also an assistant coach at the top
club, Sydney Olympic, is expected to arrive in Johor Baru today.
	   His appointment was announced by the Johor FA president Datuk
Mohammad Ali Hashim yesterday, three days after Sukumaran was
relieved of his duties following the team's dismal run in the
league.
	   And for the past three days, including last night's FA Cup tie
against Perlis, Johor FC coach Ronald Smith was roped in to help
out.
	   ``Darby's appointment will be for six months and he will work
closely with Smith,'' said Ali.
	   Johor FA had decided last week that Sukumaran will be asked to
take a rest while they scout around for a new coach, a man with
vast experience and who can provide a new approach.
	   It was also decided that the Australian forward Bob Ivanstanin
who had a week-long trial with Johor, is not the player they wanted
to shore up their forwardline.
	   Ivanstanin was tried out training sessions and a few friendly
matches and team officials decided that he did not fit the bill.

	   WRITE in support of Muhammad Safian Mohamed Omar's letter,
``Place-names still misspelt despite reform, standardisation''
(NST, May 29).
	   My colleagues and I are currently preparing a 15-volume
Encyclopedia of Malaysia and we are concerned about the spelling of
place-names to ensure that it is not only correct but consistent
throughout all volumes.
	   However, it seems that determining the correct spelling is no
simple matter as we have been informed by both the Dewan Bahasa dan
Pustaka and the Department of Survey and Mapping that State
Governments are responsible for the place-names in their respective
States and no consolidated list of place-names for the whole
country is available.
	   This makes it very difficult for publishers of reference works
and maps, and is very confusing for travellers.
	   It is high time that a national system of spelling is adopted.
	   As Muhammad Safian said, ``re-spelling might cause some
confusion but we did it 26 years ago and can surely do it again''.

	   JAKARTA (JP): Attorney General Soedjono C. Atmonegoro said
yesterday he had proposed that his office detach itself from the
government and become a separate and independent institution.
	   Soedjono told reporters here yesterday that his office was
preparing a concept proposal on the issue which would be completed
on Monday, adding that he intended to submit it to President B.J.
Habibie soon.
	   ``We demand an independent Attorney General's Office...We should
be the state prosecutor, not the government's prosecutor,''
Soedjono said after meeting University of Indonesia law school
students at his office.
	   Soedjono also said he told Habibie that the police force should
not continue to belong to the Armed Forces. Instead it should
answer directly to the President or put under the Ministry of Home
Affairs, he argued.
	   ``Police should comply with civilian law, not military law,''
Soedjono argued.
	   The National Commission on Human Rights said on Tuesday that
police should be separated from the Armed Forces so that they could
be free to act as an independent body and be in a better position
to serve and protect the public.
	   The rights body said the police should follow a doctrine that is
entirely different from that of military, which is ``to crush
enemies.'' The police, they said, exist to protect and serve the
public.
	   Soedjono, who has been a prosecutor for 34 years and was
appointed attorney general by former president Soeharto in March,
boasted that he was committed to reform of the legal system and
promised to uphold the law.
	   Soedjono promised to initiate reform in his office by changing
the ``old mentality'' of his subordinates.
	   However, analysts continue to doubt the ability of the Attorney
General's Office to address cases of corruption.

Major powers deny loans to India, Pakistan

 &UR; Eds: INSERTS new penultimate graf with Albright saying U.N.
resolution not required for airline ban. &QL; 
 &UR; With NATO-Kosovo &QL; 
 &UR; By BARRY SCHWEID &QC; 
 &UR; AP Diplomatic Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The world's leading industrial nations, acting on
a U.S. proposal, decided Friday to deny nonhumanitarian loans to
India and Pakistan in retaliation for their nuclear tests.
	   The action came at a meeting of U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright and seven foreign ministers on the nuclear
crisis in South Asia and ethnic turmoil in Kosovo.
	   A communique approved by the eight countries _ the United
States, Britain, France, Germany, Japan, Canada, Italy and Russia _
also urged India and Pakistan to halt their testing programs and
not to deploy nuclear weapons on their missiles.
	   Additionally, they were urged to deal with the ``root causes''
of tensions between them, especially over Kashmir, the mostly
Muslim enclave that straddles their border.
	   Albright also urged the other nations to refrain from nuclear
cooperation with India and Pakistan. The senior U.S. officials,
speaking on condition of anonymity, said the two countries would be
denied such help.
	   The joint steps were taken as India and Pakistan faltered in
moves to hold negotiations later in the month. Senior British and
American officials said the effort had collapsed in disagreements
over how to proceed.
	   ``The recent nuclear tests have created an atmosphere of
regional instability which will undermine the region's
attractiveness to both foreign and domestic investment, damaging
business confidence and the prospect for economic growth,'' the
communique said.
	   The United States has imposed economic sanctions, under U.S.
law, against both countries. The eight foreign ministers, as a
group, said all countries ``should act as they see fit to
demonstrate their displeasure and address their concerns to India
and Pakistan.''
	   ``Our meeting sends the message that the world community is
united not just in outrage and dismay but in action,'' Albright
said, referring to nuclear weapons tests conducted last month by
the two countries.
	   The eight nations, four of whom are nuclear powers, pledged
themselves to ``systematic and progressive efforts to reduce
nuclear weapons globally with the ultimate goal of eliminating
those weapons.'' A Japanese foreign ministry official said the
pledge was the result of pressure by his government.
	   ``We all, nuclear weapons states and non-nuclear weapon states
alike,'' the communique said, ``reiterate our determination to
fulfill the commitments relating to nuclear disarmament.''
	   By choosing to test, India and Pakistan have diminished their
security and damaged their prestige, Albright said at a meeting
with the foreign ministers.
	   Calling for unity, Albright said relations with India and
Pakistan ``must not drift back into business as usual.'' One way
she proposed was coordinating votes at world financial institutions
to postpone consideration of loans except for those ``that meet
basic human needs.''
	   Last week, the World Bank postponed two loans worth more than
dlrs 206 million to India, bringing to more than dlrs 1 billion the
amount delayed because of the South Asian nation's nuclear tests
last month.
	   The South Asian nuclear crisis competed with the ethnic
bloodshed in the Balkans for the attention of the foreign
ministers.
	   They called on Yugoslavia to let up its military pressure on
ethnic Albanians in Kosovo and ``make rapid progress'' in talks
with their leaders.
	   The United States, Britain, Canada, France, Germany and Italy
said they would move to ban flights of commercial Yugoslav airlines
to and from their countries and Yugoslavia. Japan said it would
consider going along but Russia said it did not agree to such a
move. European Union approval would be required for implementation
of such a move by its members, British officials said.
	   But Albright said ``the Russians are as concerned as we are''
with the violence in Kosovo and, in any event, while ``a resolution
may be desirable it is not required.''
 &UR; ``There must be, pick up last graf pvs.

	   HE current water crisis faced by some areas in the Klang Valley
shows without doubt the gross inefficiency of the water
authorities.
	   The hardship faced by the people does not befit a nation which
aims to be a developed country.
	   If similar problems were to occur in a developed nation, the
repercussions would have been great for those in charge.
	   I stay in Happy Garden, Old Klang Road, in a zone A area under
the water rationing exercise. The alternate day water supply plan
is a big farce.
	   There were occasions when my area had been without water supply
for eight continuous days.
	   Enquiries to the water authorities proved to be a sheer waste of
time as the standard answer given was that there was simply no
water! Sending the water tanker was as good as not supplying water
at all as only those folks ``lucky'' enough to stay near where the
tankers stopped would benefit from it.
	   If the water authorities could not supply water on alternate
days, why did they include Happy Garden in zone A?
	   It would have been better if they created a new zone for such
areas - zone C - whereby water supply is irregular and can be
stopped indefinitely till an act of God reverses the El Nino
phenomenon.
	   Then, at least, those staying in such a zone can prepare
themselves by digging wells or moving to other places rather than
relying on the mercy of the authorities.
	   I have no doubt that we will be able to achieve Vision 2020 as a
nation but when we do, please make sure that water is available for
all Malaysians in this tropical country.

	   YOGYAKARTA: Sri Roso Sudarmo, who was temporarily removed as
Bantul regent Wednesday, vehemently denied yesterday that he was
involved in the highly publicized 1996 murder of Bernas daily's
journalist Fuad Muhammad Syafruddin, alias Udin.
	   ``How am I supposed defend myself anymore? Of course I deny it
(the allegation),'' Sri Roso told reporters after surrendering his
post to Governor Paku Alam III.
	   He urged people to presume he was innocent unless a legal
process could prove otherwise.
	   The slain journalist was known to be investigating corruption in
the Bantul area when he was murdered.
	   ``So, don't accuse me carelessly. This is not a defense, but
please give me a chance to prove my innocence,'' he said.
	   Sri Roso was formally discharged due to public pressure on the
government to investigate him after evidence was uncovered that he
offered a Rp 1 billion ``donation'' to a Soeharto-owned fund in
exchange for a second term.

Used cars find second home in Caribbean, change vehicle market
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RICHARD SIMON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ST. GEORGE'S, Grenada (AP) _ When some people on this island
want to buy a car, instead of going to the local new car dealer
they go to their computers.
	   Buying a used car through the Internet or through an agent has
made owning a vehicle affordable for many residents of the
Caribbean, where import taxes on new cars often double the purchase
price.
	   ``Many of the people who purchase these cars for Eastern
Caribbean dlrs 40,000 and dlrs 50,000 (dlrs 15,000-18,500) would
have never been able to afford a brand new car, which can range
from 80,000 to 120,000 (dlrs 30,000 to 44,500),'' said Neil Nedd, a
30-year-old used car dealer on Grenada, one of the Windward
Islands.
	   Nedd has a contact in Japan who helps him screen and purchase
used vehicles, but he said many people now buy directly through the
Internet.
	   In some Caribbean countries, the rising flood of less expensive
used cars has hurt new car dealers. In Antigua, the government last
year banned used car imports.
	   Michael McIntyre, a new car dealer on Grenada, said the 110
percent tax on new cars is a deterrent for most residents. He
advocates lowering the tax to 65 percent. Other new car dealers,
such as Royston Lahee, say buyers should beware because
unscrupulous vendors could lie about the age or conditions of the
cars being shipped in from abroad.
	   Lahee said he would like to see more government regulation, but
the Grenadian government does not seem likely to ban the used car
imports.
	   ``This is an open market and everyone has the right to carry on
legitimate business,'' said junior Finance Minister Patrick Bubb.
	   Used cars have become more plentiful as the popularity of
leasing has grown in countries such as Japan and the United States.
Cars that are 2 or 3 years old are being turned in as leases
expire.
	   ``That has definitely flooded the used car market with
better-than-usual-quality used cars,'' said Scott D. Upham,
president of Providata Inc., an automotive consulting firm in
Michigan.

	   O far this season Pahang have enjoyed tremendous fan support but
the 5000 odd fans who witnessed the home team dished out a poor
performance against Penang in the FA Cup second leg at the
Darulmakmur Stadium on Tuesday, felt `cheated'.
	   It would seem, according to the fans, the League leaders did not
try hard enough to win the match. If anything, Pahang did not mind
going out of the FA Cup competition.
	   It was, therefore, not surprising to hear the cat calls from the
crowd who have been very supportive of the home team this season.
	   According to Hanif Wan Cik, a regular fan, if Pahang's strategy
is to concentrate on winning the League title, yesterday's showing
did not do their cause any good.
	   ``Penang are also title contenders and having beaten Pahang
twice in the FA Cup, they now have the psychological edge when the
two teams meet in Penang for the return leg of the league,'' said
Hanif.
	   ``And Pahng will only have themselves to blame should they
falter.''
	   Another fan, N.T. Rajah, said winning the FA Cup may not be as
glamorous as being crowned the league champions but the home team
should have given their best.
	   ``It was obvious they did not give their best and that is why we
felt cheated.''
	   Kim Fook, who runs a coffee shop, was most vocal. ``Pahang tipu
(cheated),'' he shouted after the match.
	   Others, among them Mohamed Ridzuan Abdullah, cautioned the team
not to be carried away by their eight-point lead.
	   ``Look at what happened to Sabah last year and Negri Sembilan
the year before.
	   ``Both led the table standings but fell at the last hurdle. And
I hope history does not repeat itself this year.''
	   And so Pahang may be well-advised not to take their fans for
granted.
	   What's happening to Selangor and Perak should be a grim reminder
that fans will not hesitate to desert the team should it keep
losing matches.

Italy announces five-year dig of tantalizing ancient hill
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ After unearthing a stunning fresco and a fascinating
mosaic from the bowels of a hill, archaeologists have won a
five-year commitment from the government for a big dig.
	   Culture Minister Walter Veltroni promised Friday that they will
have 400 billion lire (dlrs 220 million) in funding for work on the
Oppian Hill, one of the seven hills of ancient Rome, as well as
other digging.
	   The other sites include the Circus Maximus, the ancient sports
arena where recent testing has located the central spine of the
stadium. The funding will also cover work at the ancient Baths of
Trajan and Titus and several Roman forum areas.
	   Experts from the national and city offices of archaeology as
well as colleagues from abroad will work together on the project,
said Veltroni, who is also deputy premier.
	   The fresco discovered recently in an ancient passageway gives a
a bird's eye view of an ancient city experts are still trying to
identify.
	   The mosaic, which appears to be 1,800 years old, was later
discovered on a nearby wall and depicts a man leaning on a column.
Another fresco, found behind the wall in a hidden room, represents
grape harvesting.
	   In the past, many ancient sites in Rome turned up accidentally
during sewer and utility line work, but now Italy wants a more
active exploration of what still lies underneath the surface.

	   MEDAN, North Sumatra: Over 200 residents of Bedagai village,
Tanjung Beringin subdistrict in Deli Serdang regency staged a
protest in front of the provincial legislature here yesterday
against a tapioca factory which they said was dumping industrial
waste into the Sei Bedagai River.
	   A delegation representing the residents met provincial
legislators and pointed out that many people suffered from skin
diseases due to the river pollution.
	   The pollution also has rendered the river water useless,
prompting villagers to spend extra money to buy clean water for
their daily use.

	   HE late Tun Abdul Razak once said: ``... our intellectuals by
and large have a deep concern for the problems of our people and
particularly the urgent need to transform our society to reach the
higher living standards and industrial wealth of the advanced
countries ... they are welcome to put forth their views for the
consideration of the Government.''
	   (He said this in a message to participants at the International
Conference of Universities in Kuala Lumpur in August 1970.) In the
spirit of this quotation, I would like to highlight a predicament
faced as an academic researcher.
	   If the Government is sincere in welcoming academics to put forth
their views for the progress of the nation, this must be shown by
those in the first line of contact, namely, public administrators.
	   As a lecturer and postgraduate student who is trying very hard
to write a thesis, I often find myself making appointments to meet
government officials to clarify certain points in my research.
	   I have been fortunate to meet a handful who have been willing to
sacrifice their time but the majority however, have been
disappointments.
	   Some do not even bother to answer my letters or faxes requesting
an appointment.
	   The majority would instead ask me to meet a subordinate or pass
me to other departments. There seems to be a tendency to shy away
from meeting academic researchers, especially amongst those holding
high profile posts.
	   This, despite the fact that they are the ones making policy
decisions which have a direct bearing on problems addressed in such
academic research.
	   I do not see how academic researchers can help in the progress
of the nation if this type of attitude persists amongst public
administrators.

	   OW far last year's losing finalists Penang will go in the FA Cup
this year will be known on Saturday when they meet Sabah in the
Premier One League clash at the Likas Stadium.
	   For that's when they get to gauge their ability against Sabah,
whom they will meet by the luck of draw, on June 23 in the FA Cup
quarterfinals.
	   But for now, Penang will savour their 3-1 FA Cup second round
second leg win over Pahang at the Darulmakmur Stadium on Tuesday,
the first time the Premier One leaders have been beaten at their
home turf.
	   Perhaps this explains why Penang coach Moey Yoke Ham is
confident about about his team making headway again.
	   ``The victory over Pahang has given us the much needed
confidence. It was a good result. It augurs well for our future
matches, especially the two away matches against Sabah.
	   ``We can now take on Sabah with much confidence.''
	   Moey's previous misgivings about the team's performance was
understandable as Penang's morale was affected following their two
straight defeats to Kedah two weeks ago.
	   That was until they popped in a late goal in their win against
Negri Sembilan at home last Saturday.
	   Then came the victory over Pahang on Tuesday in the FA Cup.
	   ``Hopefully, we will be able to repeat the way we performed in
last season's FA Cup. However, I'd rather take each match at a
time,'' said Moey.
	   Against Sabah, Penang will have to do without defender Zaidi Mat
Ail who is out after two yellow cards and the injured newcomer in
defence, Nordin Kamis, who is down with a hamstring pull.
	   Defender Rahim Hassan, who has just recovered from a muscular
pull, and midfielder Ng Kok Heng who out out on a one-match
suspension, will make a return to the team.

	   JAKARTA (JP): The rupiah sank again yesterday, breaking the
15,000 level against the U.S. dollar in moderate trading before
rebounding slightly in the afternoon to end the trading day at
13,750.
	   The rupiah's close yesterday was 6 percent lower than
Wednesday's close at 12,900.
	   Currency dealers attributed the rupiah's free fall to weak
regional markets, persistent political problems at home and a
sudden rising demand for dollars by domestic commercial banks.
	   They said market fear over the Japanese yen's continuing poor
performance against the American dollar and a possible devaluation
of the Chinese yuan helped drag down the rupiah.
	   Dealers also said Bank Indonesia's (BI) move requiring
commercial banks to pay their interbank debt and trade finance
arrears by yesterday also contributed to the weakening of the
rupiah.
	   ``There were so many factors that pushed the rupiah down
further. But I think the yen's consecutive fall played a
significant role in the collapse of the rupiah today (yesterday),''
a chief dealer with a local private bank said.
	   BI Governor Sjahril Sabirin shared the viewpoint that the
rupiah's sharp fall was mainly caused by the falling yen.
	   ``The fall of the Japanese yen over the past few days forced the
rupiah to fall. There is nothing much we can do at the moment. We
can only hope that the overseas situation will improve,'' he told
reporters after meeting with President B.J. Habibie at the Bina
Graha presidential office yesterday.
	   BI director Miranda S. Goeltom said separately that if the yen
and the yuan improved, ``hopefully the rupiah will also improve''.
	   She also said that the government fiscal year-end target of Rp
6,000 per dollar may no longer be realistic.
	   ``If you look at the current situation, it seems difficult to
achieve the target. But we don't know what kind of developments
will happen next,'' she said.
	   Sjahril said the central bank would not cut its benchmark
interest rates in the near future because it was concerned that
such a step would further weaken the rupiah.
	   ``We have no plans to lower interest rates at the moment since
it would add pressure to the rupiah. I'm certain it would be a
risk.''
	   Sjahril said before meeting with International Monetary Fund
officials that the central bank would not lower the rates only to
increase them again to defend the weakening rupiah.
	   ``It would look like we were making a zig-zag policy,'' Sjahril
told journalists.
	   He said, however, that the central bank was not considering
another rate increase in the near future because it believed such a
move would no longer be effective in defending the battered rupiah.
	   The Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the banking
industry and several prominent economists have urged the central
bank to abandon its high interest rate policy since it has failed
to stabilize the ailing currency.
	   They also pointed out that the high interest rates had pummeled
the business sector.
	   The rupiah's fall prompted equity investors to take arbitrage
trading on stocks with dollar-valuation like telecommunications
firm Telkom and Indosat and tin miner Tambang Timah, which together
accounted for some 30 percent of total market capitalization.
	   Most other stocks, however, lost ground.
	   The Jakarta Stock Exchange (JSX) Composite Index closed 3.46
points lower at 411.544, off its intraday low of 403.13 points.
	   The head of Sales at Bahana Securities, Bruce Rolph, said the
country's crippled financial market would continue to wither due to
soaring inflation and a contraction in the gross domestic product.
	   ``The overseas general view is that Indonesia is terrible,
causing more offshore funds to get rid of the local market,'' he
said.
	   He said the weakening rupiah would cause most listed companies
in Indonesia to have problems in servicing their foreign debts.

	   NETWORKING company Cisco Systems Inc will announce this year the
opening of an educational centre called the Network Academy. The
centre is dedicated to training and developing networking expertise
in the country.
	   Working with a local partner, Cisco is expected to introduce the
centre in the third quarter of this year. The company, said
managing director of South Asia Cisco Systems (USA) Pte Ltd Todd A.
Abbott, is currently working on an implementation plan for the
Network Academy.
	   ``One of the critical issues in market acceptance for new
networking technologies is skilled resources, and so the concept of
the Network Academy is to partner with a local organisation to roll
out an educational facility to meet this need,'' Abbott told a
Press conference in Singapore last week.
	   Cisco has selected a partner from the education sector but
Abbott declined to reveal the name of the partner.
	   Both parties, he added, will develop a set of curriculum,
laboratory equipment and necessary infrastructure to roll out
educational and training services in networking either in the
graduate or undergraduate level.
	   According to Abbott, the setting up of the Network Academy in
Malaysia is part of Cisco's investments strategy, which includes a
plan to set up a similar centre in each country in Southeast Asia.
	   He said the company looks at the region as an opportunity to
invest despite its difficult economic conditions.
	   ``We are making investments in the infrastructure and people to
prepare ourselves for the region's economic turnaround, so that
when the economy turns around, we can grow faster than what we have
experienced,'' he added.
	   Abbott said Asia, including Japan, historically contributes
between 16 and 17 per cent of Cisco's worldwide revenues.
	   This is expected to decrease to 12 to 13 per cent in this
financial year ending July, mainly due to the decline in the
company's business in Japan.
	   He said the company is also experiencing a business downturn in
Malaysia, but it is still optimistic about the local market.
	   In order to protect customers from currency fluctuation, Cisco
offers currency protection and financing programmes for long-term
projects.
	   Prior to the Press conference, Cisco introduced a set of
solutions which enables the integration of data and voice networks.
They include four products designed to enable the next generation
of carrier-class, Internet protocol-based or IP-based services
through seamless integration of IP and Asynchronous Transfer Mode
(ATM) technologies.
	   The four products are Cisco BPX 8650 IP+ATM switch, Cisco MGX
8800 wide area edge switch, Cisco BPX 8680 universal service node,
and the Cisco TGX 8750 optical core switch.
	   Service providers will be able to deploy IP and ATM services
using these products which feature Cisco IOS software and service
management tools.
	   Cisco integrated its IP and ATM technologies through Tag
Switching, which is said to be the industry's first end-to-end
implementation of the emerging Multi-protocol Label Switching
(MPLS) standard.
	   Tag Switching is intended to integrate IP and ATM technologies,
giving service providers advantages of the ATM technology, namely
privacy and quality of service, while providing the universal
connectivity of IP.

<TEXT>
	   KARLSRUHE, Germany (AP) _ Two regional trains collided Friday in
southern Germany injuring 42 people, six seriously, police said.
	   The accident comes just 10 days after a high-speed ICE passenger
train derailed 50 kilometers (35 miles) north of Hanover,
collapsing an overpass and killing 100 people in Germany's worst
post-war railway accident.
	   Karlsruhe police said the two engines of the trains collided on
a single track about 4:25 p.m. (1525 GMT) between Ubstadt-Weiher
and Oestringen-Odenheim about 35 kilometers (20 miles) northeast of
Karlsruhe.
	   ``We don't know yet exactly how it happened, but it's clear this
accident should not have occurred,'' a police spokesman said.
	   He said it was possible a signal was falsely set or someone
didn't pay attention to it.
	   Both engineers were injured, one seriously, and were not in a
position to be immediately questioned, the spokesman said.
	   The injured were taken to hospitals by ambulance and helicopters
for treatment.
	   While both engines appeared to be demolished, an overall damage
estimate would not be available until further investigation, police
said.

Bulgaria, IMF to sign three-year agreement
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Bulgaria and the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) have agreed in principle to a three-year financial
agreement, an IMF official announced Friday.
	   But according to IMF mission leader Anne McGuirk, negotiations
in areas such as investment programs, social service reforms,
health care and agriculture could not be completed because of a
time crunch.
	   ``The details of the agreement and the concrete figures will be
agreed on in July and it will be signed in September,'' Finance
Minister Radev explained.
	   According to McGuirk, the main challenge facing Bulgaria in the
next three years is continuing the transition to a market economy.
The agreement stresses structural reforms.
	   ``There are numerous symptoms of economic growth in Bulgaria.
Internal market demand and export is constantly growing,'' McGuirk
said.
	   Bulgaria may exceed the 4 percent growth projected for this
year, she said. In the medium term the IMF projects annual growth
of 4 percent to 5 percent.
	   Tax rates will be reduced in next year's budget, Radev said.
This will be accompanied by a broadening of the tax base. The
budget is set to be completed by the end of October.

	   PATRIOTISM ... Meet Borhan Namat, 45, who sells various kinds of
fruits.
	   What's so special about that?
	   Well, the trader from Taman Pauh Indah, Bukit Mertajam, has been
selling only local fruits for the last 15 years, long before the
``Buy Malaysian''
	   campaign.
	   Even though he can earn extra money by selling imported fruits
such as apples and oranges alongside Malaysian fruits, Borhan has
not done so.
	   Therefore, it is no surprise that during the current durian
season he sells only local or kampung durians which he gets from
Batu Kurau in Perak. He refuses to sell the Thai varieties.
	   NST photographer Kamil Rahim spotted Borhan at his makeshift
stall in Taman Chai Leng, Prai, yesterday.
	   ``The types of fruits I sell depend on the season. They include
watermelon, papaya, mango or jackfruit,'' said Borhan.

	   JAKARTA (JP): Attorney General Soedjono C. Atmonegoro revealed
here yesterday that former president Soeharto has appointed a
number of lawyers to represent him.
	   ``Yes that's true,'' Soedjono replied hastily when asked by
journalists.
	   When pressed further he revealed that he had also recently met
with them.
	   ``They (lawyers) submitted a letter on their power of
attorney,'' he said.
	   Soedjono refused to divulge further details, saying only that
there were ``several of them''.
	   When pressed if they would be defending the former president,
Soedjono evasively retorted: ``They are conducting their job in
accordance with their code of ethics to defend truth and justice''.
	   He said when asked why he himself was not Soeharto legal council
that: ``Soeharto is now a private citizen so he has the right to be
represented by private lawyers. He's nothing (not a public
official) now.''
	   Since stepping down on May 21, the former president has faced
mounting pressure for an investigation into alleged abuses of power
and illicit accumulation of wealth by Soeharto, his family and
cronies during his 32 years in office.
	   Two committees have been formed by the public to investigate the
Soeharto clan's wealth.

	   KUANTAN, Wed. - Recipients of Public Service Department's study
loans who are having difficulties with repayments, are advised to
contact the department to work out a solution.
	   Deputy Minister in the Prime Minister's Department Datuk Fauzi
Abdul Rahman said by doing so, they could avoid court action.
	   Commenting on a statement by Federation of Malaysian Consumer
Associations that it was unfair for the Government to take action
under the present economic situation, Fauzi said court action was
the last resort.
	   ``We studied various aspects, including the economic situation
and financial difficulties before taking action,'' he said.
	   Fauzi had announced last week that the PSD was filing bankruptcy
notice against 89 loan defaulters.
	   He said they made up only 0.03 per cent of the 10,325 PSD
scholarship holders and 33,110 recipients of study loans.
	   ``There is still room for discussion,'' he said.
	   In another development, Fauzi said the Government's proposal to
mobilise civil servants from one department to assist another to
cope with the manpower needs was more an ``optimum sizing''
exercise.
	   He said the move was aimed at making civil servants more
productive, efficient and at cutting down expenses.
	   Chief Secretary to the Government Tan Sri Abdul Halim Ali said
last Saturday that the redeployment programme was to avoid new
recruitment.
	   Fauzi said there should not be a problem for those affected to
adapt to the new job and work environment.

Sudanese rebels warn people not to use major highway to Red Sea
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Sudanese guerrillas warned civilians Friday
not to use the highway between Khartoum and Port Sudan, saying it
was a military area.
	   The highway is a strategic link between the capital and the
country's only outlet to the Red Sea.
	   A statement from the National Democratic Alliance, the umbrella
grouping of Sudanese opposition parties and guerrilla factions,
said a unit of the Umma Liberation Army ambushed a patrol of the
government's National Islamic Front on Thursday, inflicting heavy
casualties.
	   The guerrillas attacked the patrol on the Khartoum-Port Sudan
highway, eastern Sudan, and captured several members of the NIF,
the alliance said in a fax to The Associated Press in Cairo from
Asmara, Eritrea.
	   ``The National Democratic Alliance calls on citizens to avoid
the Port Sudan-Khartoum highway, which has become a military
area,'' the fax said.
	   The Umma Liberation Army is the military wing of the Umma Party,
the party of former Prime Minister Sadiq el-Mahdi.
	   The National Islamic Front is the movement of the Sudanese
parliament's speaker, Hassan Turabi, widely regarded as the
ideologue of the government of President Omar el-Bashir, who
overthrew el-Mahdi in a military coup in 1989.
	   The alliance is waging a two-front insurrection. Guerrillas
allied to Umma are active in eastern Sudan while the country's
biggest rebel group, the Sudan People's Liberation Army, is
fighting in the south. The SPLA, which draws its support from the
south's mainly Christian and animist population, seeks autonomy
from the Islamic north.
	   More 1.3 million people have died in the fighting and consequent
famines since the war began in 1983.

	   MULTI-PURPOSE Bank Bhd's application to wind up SCK Furnishing
Sdn Bhd over its failure to settle debts amounting to RM495,612.44
was dismissed by the High Court yesterday on a technicality.
	   Judge Datuk K.L. Rekhraj, in dismissing the application with
costs, ruled that the petition was flawed as the statutory notice
served on the company did not have the date of the service.
	   ``There is no evidence of the service date on the notice. It is
very important as it is the proof that the notice has been
served,'' he said.
	   The petition was filed after SCK Furnishing, a subsidiary of
construction-based SCK Group Bhd, had failed to settle its debts
arising from an overdraft facility provided by the bank.
	   The bank was represented by Sri Dev Nair while Andrew Chin and
Raymond Tan appeared for SCK Furnishing.
	   The bank has also filed winding up petitions against SCK Group
and its two other subsidiaries - Shanghai Chong Kee Construction
Sdn Bhd and SCK Cerabrics Sdn Bhd - over the failure of the
subsidiaries to settle their debts to the bank.
	   SCK Group, listed on the Second Board of the Kuala Lumpur Stock
Exhange, had stood guarantee for the payment of overdraft
facilities taken by the subsidiaries from the bank.
	   The petition against SCK Group will be heard on June 26 before
judge Datuk T.S. Nathan.

	   JAKARTA (JP): President B.J. Habibie told top brass in the Armed
Forces (ABRI) to dig out the truth over allegations that ``an
organized group'' was behind recent riots.
	   Addressing a meeting of 151 high-ranking ABRI officials at the
State Presidential Palace yesterday, Habibie said the Armed Forces
headquarters should conduct a thorough investigation and clarify
the issue.
	   ``I particularly ask the Armed Forces leadership to reveal the
truth over allegations that an organized group was seen inciting
people to burn and loot buildings in several areas where
disturbances occurred,'' Habibie said.
	   Opposition leader Amien Rais told a gathering of 2,000
Chinese-Indonesians in Surakarta, Central Java, on Wednesday that
the riots which hit Jakarta and Surakarta in the middle of last
month were not spontaneous.
	   ``There were people who masterminded the riots in Jakarta and
Solo (Surakarta),'' he said.
	   Calls for an immediate government investigation into the mid-May
unrest have also come from the Coordinating Body for National Unity
(Bakom PKB) and the Indonesian New Brotherhood Association
(Persabi).
	   ``The government must conduct an investigation into the mid-May
riots, find the provocateurs and announce the results of the
investigation,'' Rosita S. Noer, a Bakom PKB leader, said
Wednesday.
	   ``If the government fails to clarify what happened, Bakom PKB
will invite an international human rights organization to conduct
the investigation,'' she added.
	   Meanwhile, Persabi asked the government to conduct a thorough
investigation into the riots.
	   President Habibie said he understood that the Armed Forces
Headquarters resources and personnel had been overstretched by the
massive unrest.
	   ``The Armed Forces Headquarters should therefore draw on the
people's support, as stipulated in the security and defense
Sishankamrata doctrine,'' he said.
	   Official military reports said the death toll from the four days
of riots reached 499 in Greater Jakarta alone.
	   The National Commission on Human Rights, however, came up with a
figure which was more then twice as high. The rights commission
announced last week that at least 1,188 people were killed during
the riots.
	   Separately, Minister of Defense and Security/Armed Forces
Commander Gen. Wiranto declined to comment on Amien's allegations.
	   ``It's better that I do not respond to such allegations when
they are made as an open statement to newspapers because it will
only as it will only create more speculation,'' he told reporters
after chairing a military leadership meeting at the Armed Forces
Cilangkap headquarters late yesterday afternoon.
	   ``ABRI is open to inputs from anybody, but such tenuous
allegations should not have been published in newspapers,'' he
said.
	   However, he guaranteed that the Armed Forces Headquarters would
conduct an investigation.
	   Wiranto dismissed speculation that the Armed Forces itself was
behind the riots as a means of regaining their grip of security and
order in the nation, a grip which prior to the riots had been
strongly challenged by anti-government student demonstrations.
	   ``It has never been Armed Forces' strategy to politically
engineer a situation at the expense of peace and people's
welfare,'' he said.
	   During yesterday's briefing, President Habibie, in his capacity
as ABRI supreme commander, warned that riot victims had become a
sensitive issue, not only in Indonesia, but also among the
international community.
	   ``Human rights are no longer an issue that should be suppressed.
They have now become a universal catalyst for state progress,''
Habibie said.
	   ``I hope that ABRI leaders will continue to learn ... the
various United Nations human rights pacts which we will gradually
ratify,'' Habibie noted.

	   KUANTAN, Wed. - Four men, one armed with a knife, hijacked a
lorry laden with a consignment of Nestle products worth about
RM80,000, at Km52 of the Kuala Lumpur-Karak Highway early
yesterday.
	   The vehicle, which was heading towards Kuantan from Shah Alam,
was hijacked when its driver and assistant stopped for a rest near
Bukit Tinggi about 2am.
	   Four men, who arrived in a car overpowered the two men before
tying them with ropes.
	   State Criminal Investigation Department chief Assistant
Commissioner Sulaiman Mahmud said today two of the four drove the
driver and his assistant in their car towards Selangor while the
rest drove off with the lorry.
	   He said the victims were released unharmed at an oil palm estate
in Jalan Meru, Klang.
	   Sulaiman urged those who knew the whereabouts of the hijacked
Mercedes Benz lorry, bearing registration number TN4333, to contact
the nearest police station.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Bruce Rioch is back coaching English soccer again
after being named Friday to coach division one side Norwich.
	   The 51-year-old former Arsenal and Bolton boss has been without
a manager's job since he was dumped by Queens Park Rangers as
assistant manager in November.
	   Norwich chairman Barry Lockwood confirmed Rioch would link with
his former Everton teammate Bryan Hamilton, who is the new director
of football at Carrow Road.
	   Lockwood said he was delighted that both Rioch and Hamilton.
	   ``We feel their appointments will create an environment of
ambition within the club both in the dressing room and the
stands,'' he said.
	   Rioch said he planned to use a new approach at Norwich.
	   ``There is a great deal of work for us to do. But the great
saying I've been brought up with has been, `There is no I in
teamwork.' We must work together,'' he said.

would not be tolerated.
	   It underlined political and social stability as a prerequisite
in resolving the crisis.
	   ABRI also pointed out that without strong control, the current
reform movement could be manipulated by parties that do not
represent the interests of the people.
	   Armed Forces Commander Gen. Wiranto forcefully warned that
unruly demonstrations and protests would be crushed.
	   ``In this context, ABRI's political stance toward the reform
process is very clear and firm. The reform process must be
constitutional, consistent, in the right direction, peaceful and
orderly,'' Wiranto said in his report to the President during a
ceremony at Merdeka Palace.
	   ``The commotion of political activity, the various statements
and demonstrations, if they are allowed to continue, they can
disrupt stability. There is a tendency in recent activities in
heading toward group interests,'' Wiranto asserted.
	   The President seemed to share the view that prolonged street
demonstrations and the occupation of several government offices
could destabilize the country.
	   ``If this reform wave becomes uncontrollable and violates the
foundations which unite our very pluralistic nation, it could be
possible that our nation will become divided and weak,'' the
President said.
	   ``We do not want to face a national disintegration as
experienced by other nations,'' he added.
	   The ceremony, the first official meeting between the President
and ABRI's top brass since Habibie replaced Soeharto last month,
was attended by 151 senior officers from the rank of colonel to
four-star general.
	   Army Chief of Staff Gen. Subagyo Hadisiswoyo, Navy Chief Arief
Kushariadi, Air Force Chief Sutria Tubagus and National Police
Chief Dibyo Widodo were seated in the front row facing Wiranto, who
sat next to Habibie.
	   The presence of Lt. Gen. Prabowo Subianto, the Armed Forces
Staff and Command School commander, attracted attention from his
colleagues although he sat in the back row.
	   The reform concept is a part of the Armed Forces' contribution
to the President in carrying out the country's reform agenda in
relation to the economy, politics, society and security, Wiranto
explained.
	   Wiranto said the details of ABRI's reform concept, prepared from
May 7, would only be made public after its presentation to the
House of Representatives today.
	   Without elaborating, Wiranto said the concept contained
short-term targets which should be achieved before the end of the
year.
	   ``There is a very urgent reform agenda, which must be realized
in the short term. Certain reforms must be carried out through 1998
and be finished by the end of this year,'' Wiranto said.
	   Habibie said last week that the People's Consultative Assembly
would hold an extraordinary session in December as a precursor to
elections in May next year.
	   Separately, Wiranto reaffirmed yesterday that the Armed Forces
had supported the constitutional government under President B.J.
Habibie since the beginning of the new administration.
	   ``ABRI's support for Pak Habibie was announced during the
transfer of duty from Pak Harto to the incumbent president on May
21,'' he told reporters after chairing a military leadership
meeting at the ABRI Cilangkap Headquarters in East Jakarta.
	   ``The second statement of support was announced on June 5,'' he
said.
	   Wiranto called on the nation not to question Habibie's
legitimacy as president anymore and start to concentrate on efforts
to bring an end to the economic crisis.
	   ``Continually questioning the President's legitimacy is only a
waste of time because there are more urgent tasks to do,'' he said.
	   ``There would be no guarantee that the person who replaced Pak
Habibie would be acceptable to both the domestic and international
community,'' he remarked.
	   He urged the nation to give the current government the
opportunity to settle the crisis. ``The nation needs political
stability and a conducive environment to get out of the crisis.''
	   ``And the government's legitimacy can only be obtained when
political stability and security remain steady,'' he added.

	   NANTES, France (AP) _ All Spain wants now is rain.
	   With its final training session Friday completed, the wait began
for Saturday's Group D clash between Spain and Olympic champion
Nigeria. Ever since the game was scheduled earlier this year,
Spanish coach has bemoaned the kickoff hour because of the heat.
	   Rain would naturally cool things down.
	   ``June always turns up high temperatures,'' Clemente said at his
final pre-game press conference. ``Tomorrow we can only hope it
rains. Not that the Nigerians can't take rain, but their bodies are
better suited to intense heat than ours, if it doesn't.''
	   Clemente said he was delighted with the excellent training
session the side had had and the enthusiastic mood of the players.
	   On the cup so far, Clemente said Morocco had impressed him most
for its speed and precision.
	   On Spain's fate this time round, Clemente said he hoped the team
gets some of the chances it got in 1994.
	   ``Back then we only lost by a hair's breadth,'' he said. ``This
time, the team is physically stronger and faster.''
	   Despite only losing once since the 1994 tournament, Spain has
not been able to bag a trophy or reach a final in recent years. In
1994, Italy ousted it in the quarters with a late goal although
Spain had clearly dominated while in 1996 European championships it
went out of the quarters against England on penalties.

	   PUBLIC Bank Bhd, the nation's third largest bank in terms of
assets, seems to be well-insulated against the economic downturn
with higher profits, more shareholder funds, better risk-to-capital
ratio and a healthy non- performing loans situation, according to
its latest quarterly results.
	   Its group pre-tax profit surged 370.3 per cent for the first
quarter ended March 31, 1998 to RM118.2 million compared to the
previous quarter ended Dec 31, 1997.
	   At the bank level, pre-tax profit jumped 62.8 per cent to RM94.9
million when compared to the previous quarter.
	   For the financial quarter under review, the bank's net
non-performing ratio was at 1.07 per cent compared to 1.06 per cent
previously.
	   As at March 31, 1998, the banking system's average
non-performing ratio was seven per cent.
	   In a statement released after the bank's annual meeting in Kuala
Lumpur yesterday, it said Public Bank's risk weighted capital ratio
improved to 13.19 per cent from 10.74 per cent the previous
quarter.
	   The bank's shareholders funds grew by 18.4 per cent to RM2.61
billion from RM2.21 billion while the group's shareholders funds
increased by 12.2 per cent to RM3.23 billion from RM2.87 billion.
	   The bank's total assets for the first quarter of this year stood
at RM28.24 billion from RM29.44 billion while for the group it was
at RM41.78 billion compared to RM41.90 billion.
	   Deposit from customers at the bank's level during the period
under review was recorded at RM20.63 billion against RM21.04
billion in the previous quarter. For the group, deposits from
customers stood at RM30.39 billion from RM32.02 billion.
	   The bank's total loans and advances stood at RM10.87 billion
from RM11.11 billion the previous quarter while at the group level,
it was at RM19.56 billion from RM20.46 billion.
	   President and chief executive officer Tan Sri Teh Hong Piow said
in the statement that Public Bank would continue to manage its
operations prudently to meet the challenges of the current
difficult economic and banking environment.
	   He added the group would remain sound and stable, with its
proven track record in prudence and asset quality.
	   On the bank's operations, it is expected to offer two life
insurance products under the concept of Bankassurance. Initially
the products will be sold at selected branches.
	   The first is a critical illness plan to protect customers
against 36 critical illnesses, death and total and permanent
disability due to natural or accidental causes.
	   The second will be a convertible term plan covering death and
total and permanent disability.
	   The bank's new computer system, which was installed recently,
has enabled it to offer cross company services to customers, it
said adding that the computer system would be fully Year 2000
compliant by the end of this year.
	   For the year ended Dec 31, 1997, Public Bank's group pre-tax
profit was RM634.7 million while net profit decreased by 28.1 per
cent to RM400.1 million.
	   Earnings per share for last year was 16.6 sen compared to 24.7
sen in the previous year.
	   Public Bank shares closed at RM1.39 on Tuesday. They opened
trading at the same price yesterday but was suspended at 2.30pm at
RM1.38 with 130,000 shares done.

	   JAKARTA (JP): Minister of Mines and Energy Kuntoro Mangkusubroto
awarded six new oil and gas production sharing contracts yesterday
and reassured foreign investors that their agreements would be
honored.
	   The six contractors, including five foreign companies, were
awarded the right to explore oil and gas resources in Irian Jaya,
the Natuna Islands and East Java for 30 years.
	   The contractors are Japan Petroleum Exploration Co. Ltd (JAPEX),
Lasmo (Malagot) Ltd. of Britain, YPF South Sokang Ltd, Gulf
Resources Ltd of Canada, Total of France and one local company,
Wirabuana Pan Resources.
	   ``I want to assure contract signatories that you are dealing
with an honorable government. Once we sign a contract, we will
respect it,'' he said.
	   ``I don't want to hear of any official in the Ministry of Mines
and Energy annulling a contract on the grounds that he was coerced
to sign the contract. Contract annulment is wrong in terms of law
and ethics.''
	   Kuntoro made the statement amid growing concern among
independent power generators (IPP) following a move by the State
Electricity Company (PLN) to unilaterally annul its power purchase
contract with PT Cikarang Listrindo, which is partly owned by
former president Soeharto's cousin Sudwikatmono.
	   PLN's president Djiteng Marsudi annulled the contract after the
company refused to renegotiate the contractual terms to alleviate
the electricity company's financial distress amid the monetary
crisis.
	   Djiteng said the company could not afford Cikarang's power rate
and claimed PLN was coerced to sign the contract with the company
in the past.
	   He also declared that PLN was pressured to sign contracts with
most of the IPPs.
	   Kuntoro said yesterday a contract could be reviewed but it
should be conducted in compliance with the law.
	   Kuntoro has asked Pertamina to review all contracts awarded to
Soeharto's family and cronies, but he noted yesterday he would only
weed out those which ``are legally flawed, and possibly not legally
flawed but are making Pertamina inefficient''.
	   Kuntoro also said the government subsidy for fuel this fiscal
year might reach Rp 35 trillion, against the earlier projection of
Rp 9.5 trillion, if the rupiah's exchange rate remained at Rp
11,000 against the American dollar.
	   He said the Rp 9.5 trillion subsidy was based on the assumption
of an exchange rate of Rp 6,000.
	   The subsidy would increase by Rp 5 trillion for every decrease
of 1,000 in the rupiah's value against the dollar, he added.
	   JAPEX's contract covers 2,757 square kilometers on the Semirak
Block offshore Irian Jaya, YPF South11,250 sq km in the Sokang
Block offshore the Natuna Islands; Lasmo 4,235 sq km on the Malagot
Block offshore Irian Jaya.
	   Gulf landed a contract to explore oil and gas on 4,433 sq km on
the Ketapang Block off the northern part of Madura Island; Total
6,865 sq km on the Walo Block offshore Irian Jaya and Wirabuana
4,000 sq km on the Karapan Block offshore East Java.
	   Pertamina's exploration and production director Priyambodo
Mulyosudirdjo said the new contractors pledged to invest US$318
million in exploration and development activities during the first
10 years of their contracts.
	   They were also committed to pay $9.1 million each to Pertamina
as compensation for information on their concessions.
	   The new deals brings the number of oil and gas exploration and
production sharing contracts awarded this year to 12.
	   The government awarded a record of 29 oil and gas contracts last
year.

	   KUCHING, Wed. - Mutiara Telecom today donated two handphones to
the Sibu Kidney Association to help facilitate the latter's daily
operations.
	   Its regional manager (East Malaysia) Wee Hong Guap handed over
the phones, which comes with RM150 worth of prepaid cards each, to
the association's treasurer Datuk Wong Soon Koh at Wisma Bapa
Malaysia today.
	   Wong, who is also State Minister for Infrastructure Development
and Communications, commended Mutiara Telecom for their donation
and urged other firms to emulate it.
	   Wee said the donation formed part of his company's social
obligations.
	   Earlier this year, Mutiara Telecom had contributed prepaid cards
worth about RM100,000 to the National Kidney Foundation.

Kafelnikov last remaining seed at Gerry Weber Open
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HALLE, Germany (AP) _ Russia's Yevgeny Kafelnikov, the defending
champion, was the only seeded player left at the Gerry Weber Open
Friday after he ousted Magnus Norman in straight sets.
	   Kafelnikov, the second seed, reached the semifinals by beating
the eighth-seeded Swede, 7-6 (7-1), 6-2 in just over an hour as
unusual cold continued to plague the dlrs 875,000 grass court
event.
	   Richard Krajicek of The Netherlands, the third seed, struggled
with his returns and fell to Sweden's Magnus Larsson, 6-4, 6-2 in
an earlier match.
	   Krajicek, the 1996 Wimbledon champion, became the latest victim
after upsets had already claimed this year's Australian Open
champion, Petr Korda, and the recent winner of the French Open,
Spain's Carlos Moya.
	   Larsson took control of the match by whipping in a high
percentage of first serves after he gained a break against Krajicek
to take a 5-4 first set lead.
	   Krajicek, along with problems returning the Swede's serve, also
complained about the slippery center court. Despite the artificial
roof, moisture from ongoing rain has caused players to slip and
slide.
	   The hard-serving Dutchman, who reached Wimbledon's fourth round
last year, plans to play Rosmalen in The Netherlands next week.
	   ``It was very slippery out there,'' said Krajicek. ``I'm hoping
I can get some more practice at Rosmalen and that it will be
warmer.''
	   Kafelnikovk, who also reached the final two years ago, faces
Thomas Johansson in Saturday's semifinal after the Swede ended the
upset run of Germany's Hendrik Dreekmann.
	   Johansson struggled to a 6-3, 1-6, 6-4 victory over Dreekmann,
who had ousted Moya and Boris Becker.
	   Larsson faces the winner of a later match between Italy's
Gianluca Pozzi and Paul Haarhuis of The Netherlands.

	   KOTA BARU, Wed. - Despite the ban on dikir barat performances,
the State Government today announced that it was issuing a special
permit to the organisers of the ``Buy Malaysian Goods'' exposition
beginning Friday to hold a performance at the venue.
	   The six-day exposition, to be held at Padang Perdana, is jointly
organised by the Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry's
State enforcement division and the Kelantan Consumer Affairs
Council.
	   State Culture, Tourism, Youth and Sports Committee chairman
Abdullah Yaakub said the decision to allow a dikir barat
performance during the exposition was reached at today's weekly
State Executive Council meeting chaired by Menteri Besar Datuk Nik
Abdul Aziz Nik Mat.
	   ``The approval was given after the ministry, in its application,
gave the assurance that the performance would not contravene the
State Government's guidelines on entertainment,'' he told reporters
after the meeting at Kota Darulnaim.
	   Abdullah also said discussions would be held with the organisers
of the exposition on the conditions to be observed when holding the
dikir barat performance.
	   He added that enforcement officers from the local authority
would be monitoring the performance.
	   Asked whether the State Government had lifted its ban on dikir
barat performance, he said approval to hold the performance during
the exposition was given on the basis that the case was a special
one.
	   ``The dikir barat performance to be held during the exposition
will determine the State Government's decision whether to continue
with the ban,'' he said.
	   The State Government had banned all dikir barat performances
when some organisers were found to have contravened conditions in
their permits by including other forms of entertainment
unacceptable to Islam.

	   JAKARTA (JP): The police are being cooperative in the Trisakti
shooting investigation and will submit all evidence needed in
resolving the case upon formal request, National Police spokesman
Brig. Gen. Da'i Bachtiar said yesterday.
	   Da'i made the remarks in response to questions about the 21
weapons used in the May 12 incident which were reportedly not
presented by the police to the Trisakti investigation team, led by
Jakarta Police Military Commander Col. Hendardji.
	   The weapons are needed to run ballistic tests for more evidence
in the fatal shooting of four Trisakti students.
	   ``We are not trying to hide anything. We will submit the weapons
according to the procedure, that is, we will give the guns based on
a clear and official request and on its necessity,'' Da'i said.
	   He said it would then be only a matter of time before weapons
were presented.
	   ``We are being cooperative on this matter. Please do not make
such a big fuss out of it.''
	   Meanwhile, Hendardji said he was unaware of the whereabouts of
the weapons.

	   KUALA TERENGGANU, Wed. - The State Government has given five
companies a two-year extension to complete their projects at Tasik
Kenyir.
	   Menteri Besar Tan Sri Wan Mokhtar Ahmad said the decision was
taken after considering their explanation that they could not
proceed with the projects due to the lack of basic infrastructure.
	   ``We are now trying to speed up infrastructure development,
including constructing feeder roads to previously inaccessible
areas and a building for the waterworks department.
	   ``Once they are in place, hopefully by next year, the five
companies have to honour their pledge to proceed with their
projects.''
	   Wan Mokhtar was asked to comment on the delay in the projects
proposed as far back as 1993 by SPPT Development Sdn Bhd, ASM
Development Sdn Bhd, Atasan Holdings Sdn Bhd, Kenyir Lake Tourist
Sdn Bhd and Rumpun Indera Sdn Bhd.
	   He said despite the encouragement by the Government for the
private sector to take the lead in the development projects in the
the State, the Government still had to play a leading role.
	   He said because of this, the private sector had missed several
golden opportunities.
	   ``In view of this, the State Government had to divert its funds
to provide the infrastructure to encourage the private sector to
invest.
	   These funds could have been used for other social development
programmes,''
	   he told reporters after a two-day visit to Tasik Kenyir.
	   Wan Mokhtar was taken on a tour of the areas at Tasik Kenyir
which have been identified for development, namely Sungai Petang,
Pulau Petang, Sungai Belembing, Sungai Tembat and Sungai Petuang.
	   He also visited the site for the highway project that will link
Sungai Gawi in Tasik Kenyir and Ipoh as well as a feeder road that
leads to a 400-hectare land for the development of an education and
training centre.
	   He was also taken to the aquaculture project near Sungai Gawi
and briefed on the success of the project undertaken by the
Fisheries Department.
	   As for the highway project, Wan Mokhtar said it was slightly
behind schedule but it would be completed by 2000.
	   ``This highway is an important link. It will reduce travelling
time to Terengganu from Ipoh by about two hours,'' he said.
	   He added that at present, it would take about eight hours to
travel from Ipoh to the East Coast using the Grik Highway.

<TEXT>
	   BOMBAY, India (AP) _ For poor villagers in western India, the
disaster of a cyclone that killed at least 835 people was followed
by desperate shortages that forced them on to mud-choked roads
Friday in search of food and drinking water.
	   The death toll stood at 814 Friday in the hardest-hit state of
Gujarat, as workers continued to find bodies flung on power cables
and trees or buried in sludge left behind by a tidal wave three
days after the cyclone hit land.
	   The toll crossed 800 after two government helicopters located 95
more bodies in the worst-hit Kandla port area later Friday, which
were picked up by rescue workers, said a government spokesman in
Ahmedabad, the capital of Gujarat state.

Scottish fan under formal investigation for World Cup violence
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A Scottish soccer fan accused of injuring a French
policeman has been banned from attending World Cup matches, and is
under formal investigation, judicial sources said Friday.
	   Stephen Stapley, 30, is accused of throwing a beer bottle at a
policeman during violent street clashes Tuesday night. The
policeman suffered cuts.
	   Tuesday's street festivities _ marking the start of the World
Cup _ were marred by fights between drunken fans and police. Thirty
four policemen were injured.
	   The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Stapley
was placed under formal investigation _ one step short of being
charged.
	   He requires judicial authorisation to leave France during the
probe. He is currently being held in custody.
	   French authorities have vowed to crack down on violence during
the World Cup, and are warning hooligans they face jail terms,
deportation, or stiff fines.
	   A French court Thursday sentenced a Scottish soccer fan to a
two-month suspended sentence for throwing beer cans at a policeman
during Tuesday's violence.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Deputy Prime Minister Boris Nemtsov and his family
will attend the burial of Russia's last czar, his aide said Friday.
	   Nemtsov headed the Russian government commission that was in
charge of determining the identity of nine sets of bones recovered
in 1991 near where Nicholas II was executed by the Bolsheviks.
	   Repeated DNA testing has confirmed their identities as Nicholas,
his wife, three of their children children and four servants.
	   Most members of the commission will attend the July 17 service
in St. Petersburg, Nemtsov's aide, Viktor Aksyuchin told Echo
Moscow radio station.
	   The patriarch of the Russian Orthodox Church said earlier in the
week that he would not officiate at the service. President Boris
Yeltsin has not said whether he would attend, but Russian media
have said he would not if Patriarch Alexy II did not.
	   The funeral service will be held in the Peter and Paul
Cathedral, the traditional burial site of the Romanovs, who ruled
Russia for 300 years. Hundreds of foreign representatives have been
invited to attend.

Split among Bosnian Croats to create new party
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AIDA CERKEZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Bosnian Croat politicians
who recently split with the ruling Croat Democratic Union said
Friday they would form a new party supporting an integrated Bosnia.
	   The initial meeting of the yet-to-be-named party was held Friday
in Sarajevo. The group is currently calling itself the New Croat
Initiative.
	   Its basic principles will include an integrated Bosnia, a goal
contrary to that of the Croat Democratic Union, loyal to Croatian
President Franjo Tudjman. The party has had almost no competition
in Bosnia.
	   ``The main principal is that Bosnia-Herzegovina is our
homeland,'' Kresimir Zubak said in a statement carried by the local
news agency ONASA. Zubak is the Croat member of the Bosnian joint
presidency.
	   Zubak explained last week he was fed up with the Croat
Democratic Union's policy of dividing Bosnia, and with party
leaders who used the war to get rich.
	   Zubak said he will send his resignation Saturday to the Croat
Democratic Union.
	   The new party ``is a Croat national, but not nationalistic
party, and will not be closed for other nations in Bosnia,'' Zubak
said.
	   International officials have been sympathetic toward the new
party because Croat Democratic Union hard-liners have been
uncooperative with efforts to integrate Bosnia and implement the
Dayton peace agreement.
	   ``We want to offer an alternative to Croat people in Bosnia,''
ONASA quoted Zubak as saying.
	   The leader of Bosnia's Muslims and the chairman of the
collective presidency, Alija Izetbegovic, welcomed the move as
``positive progress.''

Iraq is replacing some 30 ambassadors
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq is replacing most of its foreign
ambassadors in a drive to improve its image, which has been
severely tarnished since its 1990 invasion of Kuwait, an official
said Friday.
	   The senior Iraqi official said the government plans to replace
some 30 of its 35 foreign ambassadors. The official spoke on
customary condition of anonymity.
	   Iraq's most influential newspaper, Babil, reported this week
that a number of Iraqi foreign diplomats have been recalled to
Baghdad, but it gave no details.
	   It is time that Iraqi embassies were ``injected with new blood
to destroy the wall of isolation the enemies have constructed
around Iraq,'' the newspaper said.
	   Iraq has been under sweeping U.N. economic sanctions since the
invasion.
	   Saddam's half brother, Barzan al-Tikriti, is one of the
ambassadors who has been recalled, the official said. He was Iraq's
representative to the U.N. offices in Geneva.
	   Iraqi ambassadors to Yemen, Algeria, India, Tunisia, Pakistan,
Jordan, Russia, Malaysia were also among those recalled, the
official said.
	   The envoy to the Arab League, Nabil Najim, a close associate to
Saddam and a member of his Tikriti clan, has been appointed senior
undersecretary at the Foreign Ministry, the official said.
	   Iraq's ambassador to the United Nations, Nizar Hamdoun, may also
be replaced.

Swiss Jewish newspapers denounce U.S.-based report for absurdity
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALEXANDER G. HIGGINS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ A Jewish newspaper in Switzerland disputed a new
report that the Swiss were heavily pro-Nazi during World War II,
charging Friday that the study distorted the strength of a movement
supporting the Third Reich.
	   The newspaper, the Israelitisches Wochenblatt, alleged the study
issued in New York by the Simon Wiesenthal Center, ``deliberately
suppressed the strong anti-Nazi movement in Switzerland.''
	   The center's report alleged Switzerland's 4 million people were
``thoroughly saturated'' with right-wing groups claiming tens of
thousands of members during the war.
	   The paper joined the country's other Jewish weekly in attacking
the study. The Basel-based Juedische Rundschau on Thursday
described the study as full of ``exaggerations and
falsifications.''
	   The Israelitisches Wochenblatt, published in Zurich, said the
report made it easy for nationalist Swiss to reject efforts to make
good on any wrongs committed during World War II.
	   The newspaper said that while the Nazis had a well-organized
network of largely secret organizations in neutral Switzerland
preparing to include the country in the Third Reich, the movement
had to be put in proportion.
	   ``The Swiss Nazis were weak in numbers,'' said the weekly. ``In
the parliament in Bern they had exactly one seat for four years.''
	   ``If Swiss society were really so saturated with Nazis, that
would have had to be reflected in parliamentary elections,'' it
added.
	   The Zurich newspaper said the distortions will make it difficult
to examine the repetition of allegations it described as being more
worthy of study, such as the long-standing charge that the Swiss
government had an anti-Jewish policy during World War II.
	   The Juedische Rundschau said author Alan Morris Schom's report
starts with errors in the first paragraph, which incorrectly states
that the Swiss cantons (states) in World War II numbered 21, when
there were actually 22.
	   ``So many details are presented painfully wrong,'' said the
Juedische Rundschau, which earlier this year led Swiss Jewish
criticism of a report by Schom asserting Switzerland put Jewish
refugees in slave labor camps.
	   On Wednesday, the U.S. State Department also disputed the
charges in Schom's new report, noting that Switzerland provided
shelter for 50,000 Jewish refugees.

World Cup: Iranian coach announces roster for game with Yugoslavia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANWAR FARUQI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   YSSINGEAUX, France (AP) _ Iran's coach Jalal Talebi said Friday
he hopes to put the same players in the World Cup game with
Yugoslavia as he did in a warm-up match with Croatia earlier this
month.
	   Iran lost 2-0 to Croatia, but Talebi said his team had played
well. He said he was using the same players because Croatian soccer
was similar to Yugoslavia's.
	   It all depends on injury problems.
	   Talebi said that his goalkeeper and captain, Ahmad Reza
Abedzadeh, could have to miss Sunday's game at St. Etienne because
he still had not recuperated from a knee operation late last year.
	   Meanwhile, midfielder Reza Shahroudi was carried off the field
with an injury to his left leg during a practice match Friday.
Fellow midfielder Sattar Hamedani walked off the field with an ice
pack on his leg, as he did on Wednesday.
	   Iran is expected to adopt a defensive strategy against the
formidable Yugoslav attackers. But Abedzadeh's absence and possible
injuries that could keep out key players, may make Iran's weak
defense even weaker.
	   Talebi, who took over the team less than a month ago, used the
following opening roster in the June 3 game against Croatia in
Rijeka:
	   Nima Nakissa, Javad Zarincheh, Nader Mohammadkhani, Mehdi
Pashazadeh, Mohammad Khakpour, Karim Bagheri, Mehdi Mahdavikia,
Reza Shahroudi, Khodadad Azizi, Ali Daei, Hamid Reza Estili.

World Cup: Baggio-Del Piero together?
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PIERO VALSECCHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SENLIS, France (AP) _ With Roberto Baggio in top form and
Alessandro Del Piero ready to return on the team, coach Cesare
Maldini on Friday was thinking the unthinkable.
	   Can the two Italian star-forwards play together?
	   A heresy until a few days ago, the possibility of starting the
former Juventus teammates in Wednesday's match against Cameroon was
being considered. This year, the two scored a total of 43 goals on
different teams.
	   ``I must understand if they can play together, and in which way.
I have several days for deciding, before the next match,'' Maldini
said at Italy's training camp in Senlis following a dramatic 2-2
draw against Chile at Bordeaux.
	   Baggio, a 31-year-old veteran on his third World Cup, was taken
to France as Del Piero's substitute and fielded against Chile
because the younger teammate still is in questionable form
following a right thigh strain.
	   Baggio was the best player on the Italian side in Bordeaux and
salvaged Italy from a sensational upset by earning and converting a
late penalty.
	   ``I fielded only one of them (against Chile) because the other
had physical problems ... I don't know if they are compatible. I'll
think of it. I had thought of this also before the World Cup,''
Maldini said.
	   Italy may need to field a third forward against the African team
in Montpellier as Baggio and Christian Vieri looked quite isolated
in front against Chile.
	   ``That was a tactical problem (against the Chileans). We must
improve cohesion between midfield and the attack,'' the Italian
coach explained.
	   He rejected criticism of young defenders Alessandro Nesta and
Fabio Cannavaro, who had a difficult match against Ivan Zamorano
and Marcelo Salas in Thursday's match of Group B.
	   Salas scored both Chile's goals while Zamorano was a steady
threat with his headers.
	   ``Zamorano is one of the best world players in aerial play and
is difficult to stop. I can say both Nesta and Cannavaro will start
against Cameroon,'' Maldini said.
	   ``We are aware that Cameroon is very strong athletically. We
will study the tape of its last match against Austria tonight,'' he
said.
	   Del Piero, 23, practiced full time Friday and said he felt ready
to play against Cameroon.
	   ``It's up to Maldini to decide if I can be started. I am ready.
I see no problem in playing with three forwards, along with Roberto
(Baggio),'' Del Piero said.
	   Following the first round of matches all Group B teams have one
point from draws. Austria and Cameroon played to a 1-1 tie Thursday
night.
	   Maldini said Italy will have to play for victory against
Cameroon.
	   ``We also played for victory against Chile. I personally believe
we were unlucky as we had ten shots at the net compared with
Chile's only two,'' the coach added.

Sampras goes out in Wimbledon warmup
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMS; UPDATES with Sampras quotes; Add two quarterfinal
results &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Just 10 days before Wimbledon begins, Mark
Woodforde detects a lack of motivation in Pete Sampras' game.
	   But Sampras, beaten by the Australian 6-3, 6-2 in a third-round
match Friday on grass at the Queen's Club, begs to differ.
	   ``This tournament has always been a bit of a wake-up call for
me,'' Sampras said. ``I'm disappointed but the main goal is
Wimbledon.''
	   ``You never like losing, but if you take a step back and look at
how I've done at Wimbledon, I've always seemed to put what happened
here behind me.''
	   ``When Wimbledon comes around and I'm on Centre Court, I think
guys know I play pretty well there,'' Sampras added. ``It's nice to
have that on your side. I feel l'm going to be tough to beat, I
really do.''
	   Friday's defeat was the latest surprising loss for the four-time
and defending Wimbledon champion. He has struggled most of the year
and was ousted in the second round of the French Open by
little-known Ramon Delgado of Paraguay.
	   Sampras had beaten the 66th-ranked Woodforde in all of their
previous 10 matches.
	   But this time, Woodforde mixed up his shots, returned well and
often caught Sampras with lobs whenever the American ventured to
the net. But his most effective tactic was to hit a succession of
drop volleys which fell just over the net and left Sampras
stranded.
	   The Australian also served far better than Sampras, hitting
three aces in the opening game to set the tone of the match.
	   In contrast, Sampras produced four double-faults, the last of
which gave Woodforde a break for 3-2 in the second set. A netted
backhand volley then gave Woodforde a second break for 5-2.
	   ``Everyone is aware that, motivation-wise, he's (Sampras) not
there,'' Woodforde said.
	   ``I played a pretty good tight match against him, and he just
wasn't able to pick it up where in the past he was able to take it
up a notch or two,'' said Woodforde, known primarily as a doubles
specialist. ``That's where he is found wanting.''
	   In addition to its top seed, Queen's also lost No. 2 Greg
Rusedski of Britain, who suffered an ankle injury Friday during his
third-round match against Italian qualifier Laurence Tieleman.
	   A doctor and a trainer agreed that U.S. Open runner-up Rusedski
_ ranked No. 4 in the world _ was less than a 50-50 bet to be ready
for Wimbledon.
	   Tournament doctor Johnnie Gaynor said there was no fracture, but
said he had a severe sprain to one of three ligaments.
	   ``It is impossible to tell how long it will take to heal,''
Gaynor said. ``He'll rest for two or three days and then begin
therapy.''
	   ATP trainer Doug Spreen was doubtful.
	   ``There are definitely some question marks about Wimbledon for
Greg,'' he said.
	   With the score at 2-2 in the first set, Rusedski slipped while
stretching for a backhand volley and fell awkwardly with his left
leg buckling beneath him.
	   Rusedski screamed in pain and writhed on the grass before being
carried off the court and taken to a hospital for X-rays.
	   In order to clear up a backlog of matches caused by rain delays,
players Friday played two matches _ third round and quarterfinals _
to get the tournament back on track.
	   Woodforde later reached the Saturday semifinals with a 6-3, 1-6,
6-2 quarterfinal win over Thomas Enqvist of Sweden, seeded No. 8.
	   Also in the quarterfinals, 14th-seeded Byron Black of Zimbabwe
defeated Brian MacPhie of the United States, 7-5, 6-1, and
Australian Scott Draper defeated Doug Flach of the United States
7-6 (9-7), 7-6 (7-5).
	   No. 7 seed Tim Henman, the seventh seeded, played Italy's
Laurence Tieleman in a late quarterfinal.

Ethiopian minister rules out direct negotiations with Eritrea
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Ethiopian quotes after meeting Mubarak

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Ethiopia will not negotiate directly with
Eritrea because it is occupying Ethiopian land, the country's
foreign minister said Friday.
	   Ethiopian Foreign Minister Seyoum Mesfin arrived in Cairo and
held talks with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Foreign
Minister Amr Moussa.
	   Earlier this week, Eritrea asked Egypt to mediate the border war
with Ethiopia that broke out last month.
	   ``Direct negotiations are impossible because it is unacceptable
for someone to come and occupy your territory and tell you: `come
and negotiate with me','' Mesfin told reporters at Cairo airport.
	   ``It is against international law.''
	   After meeting Mubarak, Mesfin said: ``This war is an imposed
(war) from Eritrea.''
	   ``I strongly believe, as (does) my government, that borders
can't be changed by wars, but by peacefull means and
negotiations,'' Mesfin said.
	   The foreign minister said his government supported the
U.S.-Rawandan initiative on solving the conflict, and he called on
African states to back it.
	   Eritrea has rejected the initiative.
	   Moussa told reporters that President Mubarak had urged Mesfin to
avoid confrontation and negotiate to reach a solution.
	   Mesfin's visit comes a day after Abdullah Mahmoud Jaber, an
adviser to Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki, left Cairo after
asking Egypt to mediate in the dispute.
	   Border skirmishes broke out on May 6 when Ethiopia accused
Eritrea of occupying a swath of land along their border. The two
sides differ over where Italy, the former colonial power, drew the
border.
	   Eritrean forces fought a secessionist rebellion against Ethiopia
for 30 years. They realized their aims in 1993, two years after
helping Ethiopian rebels under Meles Zenawi, the current president,
overthrow the Addis Ababa government.

West African peacekeepers turn police in Liberia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) _ Liberia on Friday granted police powers
to Nigerian-led West African peacekeepers who have been without a
clear mandate since former rebel leader Charles Taylor was elected
president last July.
	   In an agreement signed in Liberia's capital, Foreign Minister
Monie Captan gave the ECOMOG peacekeeping force a mandate to
``assist the government in providing security and the maintenance
of law and order.''
	   Lansana Kouyate, executive secretary of the Economic Community
of Western States, also signed the deal. ECOWAS, a regional
political and economic body, originally deployed the force under
Nigerian leadership.
	   The troops are, however, forbidden from intervening in civil
disputes or engaging in commercial activities in Liberia, Captan
said.
	   The new deal also extends the force's original military
peacekeeping role. ECOMOG troops were first deployed to Liberia to
oversee the implementation of a peace accord and elections last
year.
	   Some of the troops have since been redeployed to Sierra Leone,
where they overthrew junta forces in February. But others have
stayed behind.
	   President Taylor has had cool relations with the peacekeepers,
accusing them of interfering in his bid to create a national
military from remnants of his former rebel group.

Leonardo could be new starter on Brazilian team
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PETER MUELLO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OZOIR-LA-FERRIERE, France (AP) _ A new game _ a different
Brazilian team?
	   Training camp was abuzz Friday with reports that coach Mario
Zagallo was dissatisfied with the performance of some of his
players in Brazil's 2-1 victory over Scotland and planned changes
in the starting lineup for the game with Morocco on Tuesday.
	   The modification everyone was talking about was the return of AC
Milan midfielder Leonardo to the starting 11 in place of Giovanni,
who had a poor showing against the Scots.
	   As expected, Zagallo declined to confirm the switch.
	   ``Everybody's saying Leonardo is the starter,'' he said after
practice Friday. ``I don't want to talk right now. I want to take a
few days and think about it.''
	   But Zagallo made no secret that he felt the team played better
with Leonardo, who replaced Giovanni at the start of the second
half. The defense stiffened, the offense picked up, and Brazil
gradually dominated the stalwart but limited Scots.
	   Giovanni, a versatile and creative midfielder, looked lost in 45
minutes against the Scots. Slow and diffident, missing simple
passes, he showed none of the expected rapport with his FC
Barcelona teammate Rivaldo.
	   On Friday, Giovanni ignored requests for interviews and raced
into the dressing room after practice.
	   ``I thought he was very apathetic. He didn't show up on the
field,'' Zagallo said. ``I don't know what the matter is. I'm a
soccer coach, not a psychologist.''
	   Zagallo's substitution of Giovanni was a clear sign of his
displeasure. Normally, Zagallo discusses what he feels were a
player's errors during halftime, and gives him a second chance in
the final 45 minutes. But with Giovanni, he ran out of patience.
	   ``A player with Giovanni's talent and strength can't be so out
of tune,'' team coordinator Zico said. ``He was very dispersive.''
	   Zagallo is an admitted fan of Leonardo. He lost his spot mainly
because he was a lefty like Rivaldo, and Zagallo wanted a
right-footed player for the right side.
	   The coach wanted Juninho of Atletico Madrid, but a broken leg
kept him off the Cup team. Then he tried Giovanni. Now, perhaps,
Leonardo's turn has come again.
	   One clear advantage for Leonardo is his infectious enthusiasm
and good humor, unlike the often taciturn Giovanni.
	   ``Leonardo trains as if it were a real game, and when he plays,
he shows motivation and joy,'' Zico said.
	   Leonardo's defensive ability _ he started his career as in the
back before switching to midfield _ also could give him an edge,
because Morocco has a talented offensive team that is expected to
press the Brazilians more than Scotland.
	   ``I've been prepared for a long time,'' Leonardo said. ``The
coach has to be illuminated to decide and choose the best.''
	   Many also speculated that Denilson could earn a starting spot
alongside Ronaldo, with Bebeto going to the bench. Denilson came in
at the 70th minute against the Scots and troubled the defense with
his runs up the left side.
	   ``The changes made the team stronger, including tactically,''
Zagallo admitted.
	   Still, Bebeto is likely to get another chance against Morocco,
with Denilson as the 12th man. If fans thought the 34-year-old
striker didn't produce much against Scotland, the coaching staff
didn't agree.
	   ``He moved well, creating the spaces needed for the players
advancing from the midfield and moving the ball with
intelligence,'' Zico said. ``He's doing everything we asked.''
	   Denilson also was a starter, albeit in the midfield, until the
Rivaldo-Giovanni experiment. And his good showing against Scotland
cemented his standing as Zagallo's first option for the attack _
while talented but temperamental Edmundo moved further down the
bench.
	   ``Even if someone else is upset, I'm here to show Zagallo what I
can do,'' said Denilson. ``I'm at a great moment and should take
advantage of it.''

Report says Haitians who died in capsized boat were not shot
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COCKBURN TOWN, Turks and Caicos (AP) _ Examinations of the
bodies of six Haitian refugees who drowned Monday when their sloop
capsized off the Turks and Caicos islands did not have gunshot
wounds, police said Friday.
	   Some of the survivors of the shipwreck said marine police had
fired at the overcrowded boat. But police said they only fired
warning shots in the air, Deputy Police Commissioner Bryan Davies
said.
	   The boat has been raised and will be examined, Davies said
Friday.
	   The 70 Haitians who survived the sinking were being interviewed.
They spent more than an hour Thursday talking with a representative
from the Haitian consulate in the Bahamas.
	   The ship sank Monday just 15 miles (25 kilometers) off
Providenciales, the largest island in the British archipelago 600
miles (1,000 kilometers) southeast of Florida.
	   Survivors said as many as 113 people were on the boat. Police
said there were about 70 survivors and only six bodies were
recovered.
	   Davies said police also want to interview the occupants of two
sailing yachts that may have been near the incident. The names of
the vessels are unknown, but some survivors said they were flying
U.S. flags.
	   Thousands of Haitian refugees fleeing their impoverished country
have ended up in the Turks and Caicos islands in recent years.

<TEXT>
	   KARLSRUHE, Germany (AP) _ Two regional trains collided Friday in
southern Germany injuring 37 people, police said.
	   Two people were hospitalized with head and spinal injuries, and
12 were treated for broken bones, a Karlsruhe police spokesman
said. The others suffered lesser injuries.
	   Earlier reports had 42 people injured, six seriously, but police
later corrected that.
	   The accident comes just 10 days after a high-speed ICE passenger
train derailed 50 kilometers (35 miles) north of Hanover,
collapsing an overpass and killing 100 people in Germany's worst
post-war railway accident.
	   In the latest accident, police said the two diesel-powered
engines of the trains collided on a single track about 4:25 p.m.
(1525 GMT) between Ubstadt-Weiher and Oestringen-Odenheim about 35
kilometers (20 miles) northeast of Karlsruhe.
	   It was not immediately clear how many passengers were on the
trains or at what speed they were traveling.
	   ``We don't know yet exactly how it happened, but it's clear this
accident should not have occurred,'' a police spokesman said.
	   He said it was possible a signal was falsely set or someone
didn't pay attention to it.
	   Both engineers were injured, one seriously, and were not
immediately capable of being questioned, the spokesman said.
	   While both engines appeared to be demolished, an overall damage
estimate would not be available until further investigation, police
said.

Polgar defeats Karpov 5-3 in battle of sexes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Judit Polgar, the 21-year-old chess
whizz of Hungary, dealt a humiliating blow to defending world chess
champion Anatoly Karpov, winning a speed match challenge 5-3
Friday.
	   On the last day of a four-day, eight-match contest that was the
first to pit the world's top male and female players, both games
were tied.
	   ``I think this is the greatest failure of Karpov's life, and it
must be hard for him to suffer this defeat,'' said Laszlo Polgar,
father and coach of Judit and her two sisters, both chess masters.
	   ``It's a great feeling to defeat the world champion,'' a visibly
tired Judit Polgar said after her win.
	   Karpov was unavailable for comment, leaving the venue
immediately.
	   In Friday's first game, Karpov started with an English opening,
was in a winning position in most of the game, but blundered in the
endgame. The two agreed a tie on the 71st move.
	   That meant that _ irrespective of the last match _ Judit had won
their contest.
	   The last game went without much excitement. Karpov, playing
black, started with a Caro-Kann defense, then played a Panov
variation.
	   Polgar failed to capitalize on a potentially winning advantage,
and a tie was agreed on the 68th move.
	   This was the first time in chess history that the top male and
female players played each other.
	   Although Karpov is world champion of the World Chess Federation,
FIDE, fellow Russian Garry Kasparov is regarded the true world
champion.
	   Laszlo Polgar told The AP after the match that Kasparov's
representative watched the Budapest match, and they are already
negotiating a match between Judit Polgar and Kasparov.
	   ``There is already 1 million dollar prize money offered for that
match,'' he said, but declined to answer who the sponsor would be,
where it would be played or say how advanced negotiations are.

	   JAKARTA (JP): About 80 representatives of contractors grouped in
the Jakarta chapter of the Indonesian Builders Association staged a
peaceful demonstration at City Hall yesterday to protest alleged
collusion between the governor's office and the association's
executives.
	   One of the protesters, Beresman Siagian, said they wanted the
revocation of Gubernatorial Decree No. 367, issued in 1994, which
required all contractors to become members of the association and
pay membership fees before participating in tenders of city
projects.
	   It was proof of collusion, he said.
	   ``We paid a lot of money as members to the association, but
still many of the projects were awarded only to the association's
executives.''
	   He said the contractors were required to pay a yearly membership
fee of between Rp 500,000 and Rp 4 million for each company they
had.
	   Many contractors had more than three different companies to
enable them to participate in tenders on various projects, said
Siagian.

<TEXT>
	   GOODWOOD, England (AP) _ Long-time Formula One owner Ken Tyrrell
received a fitting retirement present Friday when his grandchildren
re-acquired the Formula One car Jackie Stewart drove to the 1970
championship.
	   Two of Tyrrell's grandchildren paid 73,000 pounds (dlrs 119,720)
at auction for the first Tyrrell-Cosworth Formula One car produced
for the Scottish driver.
	   Adrian Tyrrell, 28, and his cousin, Claire, said they had paid a
reasonable price for the car which launched Stewart on a string of
wins in the early 1970s.
	   ``In fact it was not as much as we expected and I have got
something I really wanted,'' Adrian said.
	   ``I'm delighted the car is staying in the family. I think it
would be sad if it had gone abroad,'' Ken Tyrrell said.
	   Ken Tyrrell and his son, Bob, stepped down in February from
management of the Tyrrell Racing team after failing to come to
terms with the team's new owners.
	   Tyrrell Racing was bought out last year by British American
Racing. Tyrrell announced last year he was retiring, although he
had planned to do it at the end of the 1998 season before the
falling out with British American Racing.

U.S. official calls for pragmatism in talks on international court
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ The U.S. ambassador on war crimes
Friday called for a pragmatic approach to next week's international
conference to discuss the establishment of a permanent
international criminal court.
	   Ambassador David Scheffer said debates over the structure of the
court have continued for three years and ``this is crunch time.''
	   ``We cannot seek in Rome to create a dream factory of
international criminal law, a theoretically pure institution,'' he
told reporters during a one-day visit.
	   ``What emerges from Rome will be an international court that
satisfies the needs of international criminal justice in our time
and for the next century,'' he added.
	   During the Rome conference, envoys from more than 180 countries
will try to hammer out, among other things, the court's structure
and jurisdiction.
	   Scheffer stressed that it is vital that the court has enough
backing by a broad section of countries worldwide and it has the
clout to do its job.
	   Scheffer was in The Hague for the inauguration ceremony of the
third courtroom at the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal.
	   That U.N. tribunal was established by the Security Council in
1993, and it is prosecuting serious violations of international
humanitarian law committed in the former Yugoslavia since 1991.
	   Scheffer said the permanent international criminal court will
deal with ``the most serious commissions'' of crimes.
	   ``You can boil it down to almost mass killings. That's where the
focus of this court needs to be,'' he added.
	   ``You cannot create a court where we are creating a human rights
ombudsman that will have at least the temptation to take any and
all violations of human rights,'' he added.

	   TANGERANG (JP): The rice supply in Tangerang Regency will be
severely affected by failure of harvests on 600 hectares of paddy
fields, destroyed by severe flooding last week.
	   Head of the regency's agriculture office Yodhi Rosidi said
yesterday the crops, which were ready for harvesting, were
destroyed by the regency's biggest recorded floods which hit June
5.
	   With water levels reaching up to 1.5 meters in height, the
flooding inundated five regencies, namely Balaraja, Pasar Kemis,
Tigaraksa, Rajeg, Mauk and Kronjo, Yodhi said.
	   Without giving details on the quantity of rice stocks held at
the regency, he said his office had asked for aid from the
provincial government in the form of rice seedlings for the next
planting season.
	   ``We have also requested assistance in both rice and medicines
for those affected,'' he said.
	   According to his office's data, paddy fields in the regency
covered 41,285 hectares, of which about 13,000 hectares could not
be cultivated during the dry season.

	   BOGOR (JP): Lt. Col. Suratmo was installed yesterday as the new
commander of the Bogor military district, replacing Lt. Col.
Mustofa Hadi Pranoto, who has been appointed chief of staff of the
Bogor Military Resort.
	   The installation ceremony at the military district headquarters
was led by Bogor Military Resort Commander Col. Suprapto.
	   In his speech Suprapto urged all military personnel to keep an
eye on the possibility of renewed social unrest, which is feared to
threaten the country's stability and security.
	   ``Bogor is a tourism and education city linking Jakarta and
other cities in West Java,'' he said, adding that any disruption to
this situation was feared to have a bad impact on local security.
	   Suratmo, a 1982 graduate of the Armed Forces Academy, said at
the ceremony that he would soon meet key local figures to give him
inputs on various problems in the area.

	   JAKARTA (JP): Police shot an alleged drug dealer, who was a
former member of the City Police Mobile Brigade squad, for
resisting arrest in Depok yesterday.
	   The suspect, identified as Teguh, 27, was shot in the left leg.
He was later taken to the police's violent crime section for
questioning.
	   The incident happened at about 10:30 a.m. on Jl. Leli I in Depok
I. The area is believed to be a drug dealing center.
	   ``We have watched his activities for quite some time. After
obtaining information from nearby residents, we raided the house,''
said one of the police officers, who asked for anonymity.
	   The police confiscated one kilogram of marijuana as evidence.
	   ``Currently, we're still trying to gain more information.
Hopefully, we can get other suspects because we believe that he
(Teguh) is a member of a huge, organized drug trafficking gang,''
the police added.
	   The city police detectives chief of general affairs, Lt. Col.
Dikdik, confirmed the arrest. ``Yes, we have captured an alleged
drug dealer,'' he said.
	   Separately in West Jakarta, police captured on Wednesday two
alleged killers of Saefudin, an SMEA Bhakti high school student,
who died in a brawl five days ago.
	   The two suspects, identified as Sof, 17, and Sut, 19, were
arrested after class at SMK Teknik high school in Mangga Besar,
West Jakarta.
	   ``They admitted to attacking Saefudin with a sickle, which they
said they later hid somewhere in Tangerang. We're currently looking
for the sickle as evidence,'' Capt. Eko Sampurno, head of Tanjung
Duren Police subprecinct, said yesterday.
	   The two suspects were arrested in a joint operation between West
Jakarta Police precinct and Tanjung Duren Police subprecinct.
	   ``We're also trying to gain more information about the
possibility of involvement by other students in this fatal brawl,''
Eko added.
	   In East Jakarta, a resident of Kampung Tengah, identified as
Cahya, 28, fell victim to an armed robbery when four men broke into
his house on Jl. Masjid Al-Bariah on Wednesday morning.
	   The robbers, armed with machetes and a gun, made away with some
US$5,000 in cash, 70 grams of gold jewelry, a mobile phone, a Mazda
sedan and a television set.
	   The robbers tied up Cahya with rope and sealed his mouth with
tape.

World Cup: Rieper header gives Denmark 1-0 victory
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS reaction from Rieper, Saudi coach. &QL; 
 &UR; By MIKE CORDER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LENS, France (AP) _ Defender Marc Rieper showed his strikers the
way to goal Friday, heading Denmark to a 1-0 victory over Saudi
Arabia in their opening World Cup Group C match.
	   Rieper rose unmarked in the box in the 68th minute to secure the
points for the Danes in a scrappy match that Denmark should have
won by a wider margin.
	   ``I was very happy with the way we played and I am delighted to
score a goal for Denmark,'' Rieper said.
	   ``We created a lot of chances so we should have won by a bigger
margin.''
	   Denmark dominated possession in the first half but could not
convert its superiority into a goal before 38,140 fans at the
41,275-seater Stade Felix Bollaert stadium.
	   Brian Laudrup and his older brother Michael caused problems for
the Saudi defense with quick passes and inventive running off the
ball, but nobody could provide the finishing touch and as the half
wore on Saudi Arabia grew in confidence and began to pose a threat.
	   Early in the match the Saudis continually squandered possession
with inaccurate passing seemingly taking time to warm up on a cold
day in this northern French coal mining town.
	   Saudi coach Carlos Parreira, who led Brazil to World Cup victory
four years ago, praised the Danes, but also said his team had
acquitted itself well.
	   ``We played against a good team with nice players and they did
well,'' he said. ``My players should leave with their heads up. We
played tough against a good team.''
	   Saudi Arabia played well, especially in the second half,
Parreira said, but added that bad passing let them down. ``We gave
away so many balls, so we lost a little control.'' he said.
	   Denmark's best chance to open the scoring came when a flicked on
pass fell to Ebbe Sand in the 18th minute but his close range shot
flew over the bar.
	   Jorgensen wasted another good opening in the 32nd when Brian
Laudrup sliced open the Saudi defense with an angled, forward pass.
But the Udinese striker, well clear of the defense, fired well wide
from close range.
	   In the 36th minute, Rieper headed on a long throw-in by Martin
Jorgensen and then pounced on the ball as it deflected off Michael
Laudrup's chest, but Saudi goalkeeper Mohammed al Deayea got down
quickly to save Rieper's shot.
	   The Saudis' first attempt on goal did not arrive until the 26th
minute when Ibrahim al Shahrani's long range shot flew high and
wide of Peter Schmeichel's goal.
	   But it was the Saudis who came closest to breaking the deadlock
before the break.
	   From a 42nd minute free kick just outside the area, Saeed
Owairan touched the ball to Khalid al Muwalid who stopped it for
Owairan to shoot. The curling left foot effort looked destined to
creep just inside the post but Schmeichel, at full stretch, tipped
the shot wide.
	   ``They had that good free kick which Peter Schmeichel saved
brilliantly but, apart from that, I thought we had them under
control,'' Rieper said.
	   Denmark slowed the game down at the beginning of the second half
but still struggled to find a path through Saudi Arabia's defense.
	   Denmark finally found a way to the net in the 68th minute when
Brian Laudrup crossed from the right to Rieper in the center who
headed past Al Deayea.
	   The chance was gifted to the Danes by some sloppy Saudi
defending, at least one defender playing Jorgensen onside and the
Dane passing to Laudrup who fed Rieper.
	   Saudi Arabia nearly pulled back a quick equalizer but Ibrahim al
Shahrani's flicked header drifted wide after a good cross from the
right by Mohammed al Jahani.
	   Denmark and Saudi Arabia both were making their second
appearances in the World Cup finals. The countries reached the last
16 in their previous visits to the finals, Denmark in 1986 and
Saudi Arabia in 1994.
	   Lineups:
	   Denmark _ Peter Schmeichel, Michael Schjonberg, Marc Rieper, Jes
Hogh, Thomas Helveg, Michael Laudrup, Brian Laudrup (Jan Heintze,
84th), Soren Colding, Morten Wieghorst (Allan Nielsen, 66th), Ebbe
Sand, Martin Jorgensen (Per Frandsen, 74th).
	   Saudi Arabia _ Mohammed Al Deayea, Mohammed Al Jahani, Mohammed
Al Khilaiwi, Abdullah Zubromawi, Fuad Amin (Hamzah Saleh, 79th),

World Cup: Dutch look to patch up old wounds

<TEXT>
	   VERSAILLES, France (AP) _ For two decades, the progress of
talented Dutch teams has been wrecked by clashes between players
and management. This time, players pledged things will be
different.
	   Disputes over tactics, money and simmering race problems have
undermined the Netherlands in major tournaments ever since Johan
Cruyff walked out on the team before the 1978 World Cup.
	   During the 1996 European Championships, Edgar Davids was sent
home for criticizing coach Guus Hiddink.
	   Two years earlier, Ruud Gullit walked out on training before the
World Cup.
	   Gullit was also one of the players at the center of conflicts
before the 1990 World Cup.
	   ``There have been disputes in the past, but this time there are
no divisions,'' Hiddink said Friday in Versailles, where the team
was completing preparations for its World Cup opener against
Belgium.
	   ``We are very determined. The individuals know that in their
careers they will not play in many World Cups with the kind of
squad that we have here,'' he said.
	   Captain Frank de Boer noted that the absence of experienced
superstars like Gullit and Marco van Basten could ease tensions
within the camp.
	   ``In the past, players like Gullit and van Basten could have had
a say in the tactics,'' de Boer said. ``But that is not the case
this time. We are a younger team.''
	   The Netherlands is better prepared for success than in the 1996
European Championships, he said, when the team failed to show top
form and lost in the quarterfinals.
	   ``We are more experienced than in 1996,'' de Boer said. ``And
this time we don't have anything to interfere with our preparations
as we did then.''
	   Davids' inclusion in the squad is seen as a sign of more cordial
relations within the Dutch camp.
	   ``This time, we are really a team,'' striker Jimmy Hasselbaink
said.
	   The Netherlands also approaches the World Cup with revamped
tactics, having abandoned its conventional 4-3-3 in favor of a more
cautious 4-4-2.
	   ``It's a little bit more defensive, but most of us play 4-4-2
for our clubs,'' de Boer said.
	   Striker Dennis Bergkamp was also in confident mood.
	   ``We have a chance to get to the final,'' Bergkamp said.
	   ``If you look at the clubs that our players play for, and their
roles for their teams, the quality of the squad is clear,''
Bergkamp said. ``It is different from two years ago. We are a lot
more experienced. We are wiser now.''

Second day of perilous drop for Rand
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ The South African Reserve Bank
signaled its intent Friday to stop propping up the rand, triggering
another plunge in its value against the dollar.
	   Late Friday, the dollar was quoted at a record high of 5.30
rand, up from 5.25 late Thursday.
	   Since June 3, the rand has lost nearly 4 percent of its value to
the dollar, and a full 8.3 percent since the beginning of the year,
AP-Dow Jones newservices reported.
	   The latest fall was attributed in part to the reserve bank's
decision on Friday to drop its interest rate by half a point to 17
percent, a signal of retreat from its strategy over past weeks of
selling dollars and hiking interest rates to boost the rand's
value.
	   But the global strength of the dollar also played a role.
	   The Reserve Bank's actions raised the specter ``that the rand
will fall to 5.70 (rand to the dollar) in the near term,'' Larry
Hatheway, an analyst at SBC Warburg Dillon Read in London, told Dow
Jones.
	   He said Friday's rate cut was puzzling because the central bank
had just tightened monetary policy late in May to curb pressure on
the rand.
	   This flip-flop will ``do little to restore confidence in the
currency,'' he added.
	   The interest rate drop came amid growing pressure from
economists, market participants and politicians who have questioned
the cost of the bank's policies.
	   Earlier this month, the bank reported it had spent over dlrs 6
billion defending the rand from what it saw as foreign speculation
for profit.

	   JAKARTA (JP): Rikwan, 57, spends all his days at home in a
housing complex in Jelambar, West Jakarta.
	   He rarely plays with his seven new birds, including a bulbul and
a starling, a gift from his lovely wife, who thought the gesture
may appease the man, who was badly affected by last month's riots.
	   His wife keeps him company every day, trying to keep him busy
and help him forget the recent past.
	   His three children, two of whom are married, can only watch
their upset father from a distance.
	   The riots on May 13 that tore parts of the capital apart also
destroyed the only livelihood the Chinese-Indonesian family had.
	   Their tiny kiosk, from which they sold cheap clocks and
wristwatches in the city-run Pasar Pagi Perniagaan market center on
Jl. Perniagaan (formerly known as Jl. Toko Tiga) in the busy Glodok
district, was set on fire by the mobs.
	   Not one single thing could be salvaged. The looters took every
item out of the four-meter-by-three-meter shop before they burned
it down.
	   ``Our family is badly hurt,'' his son Eddy Wijaya told The
Jakarta Post yesterday in a bitter voice.
	   ``The shop and all its contents...,'' he paused, then burst into
tears.
	   Eddy, a manager of a food company, wept a few more seconds.
	   He finally said: ``The business was built up by my father for
over 30 years, since I was a small boy!''
	   According to Eddy, the loss of some Rp 100 million (US$9,000)
might be peanuts to many.
	   ``But not for us. We're not big entrepreneurs,'' he said.
	   ``It was my father's pride and joy. It was our only source of
livelihood,'' he explained.
	   His father, Rikwan, immigrated to Jakarta from the South
Kalimantan capital of Banjarmasin at the age of five. His brother
brought him here in search for a better life.
	   When he grew up, he started a business as a street textile
trader. After years of hard work, Rikwan bought his own shop and
was able to finance his two sons' and daughter's university
educations.
	   ``Now, we no longer see him smile. He prefers to stay alone,''
said Eddy, who lives at home with his parents.
	   What made his father' blood boil was the local preman (hoodlums)
in the market area. He had often been obliged to give them
protection money and food, Eddy recalled.
	   ``They were among the mob that broke down the shop door, grabbed
the goods and set the place on fire,'' he said.
	   Eddy's brother, Handy, who witnessed the devastation of his
family's shop, recalled that he hurriedly closed the store at 11:30
a.m. following rumors that several shops in the city had been set
on fire.
	   He quickly took his motorcycle and parked it down a nearby
narrow alley before returning to watch the shop.
	   ``The mobs started to tear down the doors and windows of our
shop, along with dozens of others at about 3 p.m.,'' Handy said.
	   ``We could only watch hopelessly from a distance.''
	   When informed about the incident, Rikwan -- who was at home at
the time -- could not say a word.
	   In the evening, he was told by neighbors that a group of people
would attack, loot and burn their housing complex, which is mostly
occupied by Chinese-Indonesian families.
	   Frustrated, Rikwan got out of bed, picked a hoe as a weapon and
told his neighbors he would stand guard to face the mobs.
	   ``I'm already old. So let me handle these people. My shop has
been damaged. I won't let them touch my house and family, they'll
have to kill me first,'' Rikwan told his neighbors, who were
stunned by his remarks.
	   That night, the residents twice became involved in heated
arguments with outsiders, but no fights occurred.
	   Uncertain
	   Now, Rikwan's wife, children and grandchildren want him to stop
dwelling on the past and start anew.
	   ``We know it's not easy for him,'' Eddy said, ``none of us have
any idea what to do next.''
	   During the May 13 to May 15 riots, the city and surrounding
areas were shrouded in black smoke which had billowed from
thousands of burning buildings set on fire by mobs.
	   The mobs not only looted and vandalized property. They also
raped and sexually abused women and girls.
	   Most victims and owners of damaged property were
Chinese-Indonesians.
	   A businesswoman told the Post how her pregnant relative in West
Jakarta was gang raped during the unrest.
	   ``She's still deeply stressed by it,'' she said.
	   Most victims have refused to speak to the press about their
ordeal.
	   Their agony has been renewed by rumors of the city being rocked
again by massive riots in the next few days.
	   Residents of some upmarket housing complexes in the capital have
collected money to purchase defense equipment, such as barbed wire
barricades, to protect their property.
	   The victims of the recent riots blame the city's security
officers of doing nothing to protect them from the violent mobs.
	   During last month's riots, many housing complex residents hired
uniformed security officers to stand guard at entrances to their
complexes.
	   Poor treatment and uncertainty of the country's political and
economic situation have forced many Chinese-Indonesian families to
leave Indonesia.

NATO and Russia agree on danger, differ on method

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with fresh details and quotes. &QL; 
 &UR; With NATO-Albania &QL; 
 &UR; By JEFFREY ULBRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - Russia and the NATO allies agreed
Friday that the explosive situation in Kosovo represents a grave
danger to its neighbors but differed on how to deal with defiant
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen, who had a private meeting
with Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev and another as part of
the NATO-Russia Permanent Joint Council, stressed the urgency of
finding a solution to hostilities in the southern Yugoslavian
province.
	   ``We are looking at a very short time frame ... to solve this
peacefully,'' he told a news conference at the end of a two-day
North Atlantic Treaty Organization defense ministers' meeting.
	   On Thursday, NATO decided to demonstrate allied air power over
neighboring Albania and Macedonia in hopes of impressing Milosevic
and making him rethink his policy of escalating violence in Kosovo.
	   That demonstration, probably early next week, will involve
simulated air attacks and bombing raids. The ministers also ordered
military planners to study options for further action ranging from
accelerated planning for military exercises in the region to direct
air strikes inside Yugoslavia and use of air-mobile ground troops.
	   Cohen said there was a great ``sense of urgency among NATO
members'' that something must be done quickly to stop Milosevic's
attacks on ethnic Albanians, who make up 90 percent of Kosovo's
population.
	   The rebel Kosovo Liberation Army is seeking independence, an
aspiration NATO does not support.
	   ``NATO, all the ministers, and Russia have a unanimous attitude
toward the events in Kosovo,'' said Sergeyev. ``Our differences are
in assessment, approach and methods.''
	   He said Russia ``is convinced we haven't exhausted all
non-military means ... to resolve this crisis.'' If ``other
methods'' must be adopted, he said, they ``should be the
prerogative of the U.N. Security Council.''
	   Macedonia has not yet given its authorization for the planned
military exercises over its territory, but Albania is delighted
with the decision to show force.
	   ``We are very pleased about the decision taken by the NATO
Council yesterday,'' Albanian Defense Minister Luan Hajdaraga said
in an interview.
	   ``The stand of Milosevic in the Kosovo crisis is very clear, it
is to dominate the situation by military means.'' The danger is, he
said, that ``those means can spread to Albania.''
	   Gen. Henry Shelton, chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff,
couldn't give details of exactly what form the exercises would
take, saying they were still being developed by NATO planners. Nor
could he say what might trigger a direct military intervention in
Kosovo.
	   ``War is an extension of politics by other means,'' he said,
quoting German military philosopher Carl von Clausewitz.
	   ``There is still a whole host of other things to be done,'' he
added.
	   The NATO-Russia Permanent Joint Council was formed a year ago as
part of the effort to ease Russia's fears about NATO enlargement.
It has become a forum for consultation on security issues as well
as planning future cooperation.
	   A joint statement at the end of the meeting said the ministers
discussed Kosovo and ``condemned Belgrade's massive and
disproportionate use of force as well as violent attacks by Kosovar
Albanian extremists.''
	   NATO must walk a fine line between trying to halt the Yugoslav
government's ``disproportionate use of force'' and offering aid and
comfort to the rebels seeking independence, which NATO opposes. It
has been careful to condemn the violence on both sides.

	   AJINOMOTO (Malaysia) Bhd is contemplating to further increase
the prices of its food seasoning products if the current economic
situation worsens.
	   Managing director and general manager Yasushi Akasaka said
yesterday the company had raised the prices of its main product
line - Aji-No-Moto - by two to three per cent since early this
year.
	   The increase was due to the escalating cost of raw materials
especially tapioca starch which was mainly imported from Thailand,
he said.
	   The company's other core raw materials are sago starch and sugar
cane which are sourced from Sarawak.
	   Akasaka said the price of imported tapioca starch had risen by
50 per cent and that Ajinomoto sourced about 40 per cent of the raw
materials from overseas.
	   Akasaka, who spoke after Ajinomoto's annual meeting in Petaling
Jaya, Selangor, said the company expected its group pre-tax profit
to decline slightly this year from the RM7.94 million recorded in
the year ended Dec 31, 1997.
	   Apart from the rise in cost of raw materials, the expected lower
profit could also be attributed to the drought.
	   ``The lower profit is expected to be further aggravated by the
uncertainties in the market which will likely result in a slowdown
in the retail and food services industries.''
	   He said Ajinomoto was counteracting these shortcomings through
cost saving programmes and increase in export market.
	   Despite these shortcomings, Akasaka said the company had
targeted a 10 per cent increase in sales turnover to RM135 million
this year from RM124.5 million last year.
	   The higher sales revenue was expected in view of the growing
demand for its products including two new products within the
Seri-Aji and Aji-Shio lines.
	   He said the Aji-No-Moto product line had posted an 11 per cent
growth in sales last year, and Tencho - a naturally derived food
seasoning - was also performing well.
	   Ajinomoto exported about 20 per cent of its products last year
to Oman, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Sri Lanka, Singapore and China,
among others. It plans to increase export sales by another five per
cent this year. Akasaka said the company would be spending about
RM8.5 million to expand its operations.

	   JAKARTA (JP): The city administration wants to put an end to
allegedly discriminatory practices in the processing of
identification cards for Chinese-Indonesians, an official said
Wednesday.
	   Deputy governor for administrative affairs Abdul Kahfi said the
plan was based on universal human rights which stated that all
citizens were equal and had the same rights and obligations.
	   Kahfi did not put a time frame on when the objective could
become reality.
	   ``In the future, such differential treatment will be considered
to be terminated,'' he told The Jakarta Post.
	   Although Kahfi refused comment on the issue, many
Chinese-Indonesians also believe their identification cards are
marked with special codes denoting their foreign ancestry.
	   ``Unlike the ID card number of others, mine has a space on it
which my neighbors said was a code for my status as a person of
Chinese descent,'' said a female private employee.
	   But the head of the city office of population affairs, Soemarto,
denied there was coding.
	   ``No. There's no discrimination. There's no special marks. There
might have been in the past, but not anymore,'' he said.
	   Soemarto's opinion was shared by Tan Siu Sin, a
Chinese-Indonesian living in South Jakarta.
	   ``There used to be a special code inserted in my ID card number
but it is not found anymore in my new card,'' said Tan.
	   But he complained about graft practiced by officials at his
district administration office, who demanded Rp 50,000 from him to
help process his ID card.
	   The official administration fee is only Rp 1,000 per person.
	   Tan finally decided to handle all the procedures by himself and
spend Rp 10,000 for the card, which was completed in two weeks.
	   To apply for an ID card, mandatory for all city residents,
applicants must bring the family collective data card, expired ID
card and documentation if they just moved from another district.
	   Tan said Chinese-Indonesians are also required to show a letter
from the local district court proving Indonesian citizenship, proof
of a special Indonesian citizenship card, called K1, and the
naturalization document for those who adopted Indonesian names.
	   Kahfi insisted prerequisites to obtain the documents were the
same for all city residents.
	   ``If there really are some differences, I think those are only
to... signify their status,'' he said.
	   Senior city councilor Nitra Arsyad from Commission E for social
welfare affairs condemned the alleged discrimination.
	   ``I don't see the necessity of appending special codes on the ID
cards for Chinese-Indonesians.
	   If the marks were made to help the government in identifying
people for administration or security purposes, then it would be
better to put the marks in documents stored in a data base or
something, not in the ID cards,'' he said yesterday.
	   Nitra believed the identification policy was made by the
government years ago in a bid to foil the possibility of illegal
Chinese migrants from obtaining Indonesian ID cards or passports.
	   Many Chinese reportedly illegally entered the country at that
time through areas including Riau in Sumatra, West Kalimantan and
North Sumatra.
	   He said the government introduced rigid screening procedures for
ethnic Chinese because it feared they might cause problems.
	   But erasing discriminatory codes from ID cards would not tackle
public resentment of Chinese-Indonesians, Nitra said.

Kuala Lumpur until June 18.

cooks Srisawat Bunsang and Ladda Woraward, hostess Nipa Keawrath
and sales manager Wipanun Suwannetra.
	   Veerasak, who is in Malaysia for the first time, said Malaysian
cooking was similar to that of the Thai.
	   ``Malaysian food is tasty and spicy but not as hot as Thai food.
	   ``Thai food is rich in coconut milk and we use a lot of lemon or
the sour taste,'' said Veerasak, who learned to cook at the age of
17.
	   Spice for the dishes were flown in from Thailand for the
promotion which is available for buffet lunch and dinner at
Wenworth Court.
	   Among the dishes are seafood souffle in banana leaf, chicken in
green curry sauce, fish with sweet and sour sauce, grilled fresh
water prawn with savoury sauce, roast beef tenderloin with basil,

as Kanom Krok (baked coconut milk pudding), Sakoo Sai Gai (steamed
sago balls stuffed with chicken) and Kao Mok Kai (steamed rice
pancake stuffed with chicken).
	   Wenworth Hotel Kuala Lumpur food and beverage manager Denis Ong
said: ``People seem to like Thai food and most restaurants offer
Thai food especially tom yam which is loved by everyone.''
	   Ong said that during the promotion, lucky draws are held for
patrons to its Palms Cafe.
	   The grand prize is a trip to Haadyai, comprising an air ticket
and accommodation at Central Sukhontha Hotel, and American buffet
breakfast for two persons.
	   Other prizes include free stays at Wenworth Hotel.
	   The buffet lunch or dinner is priced at RM30 for adults and

	   THE Apec Sub-committee on Customs Procedures needs to work more
closely with the business sector in order to facilitate trade flow
among member countries.
	   Sarawak's Finance and Public Utilities Minister Datuk Dr George
Chan Hong Nam said he was surprised to learn recently that to
effect clearance from Customs was ``no easy task and existing
procedures were somewhat cumbersome.''
	   Information and statistics available showed that to effect
clearance from Customs involved, on the average, 27 to 30 parties,
40 documents, 200 data elements (some of which were overlapping)
and between 60 to 70 per cent of re-keying of data at least once.
	   ``There is an urgent need for us to get our act together and to
spare those dealing with Customs and authorities in the clearance
of imported goods, the painful and sometimes frustrating
experience.
	   ``What is needed is a partnership between the parties involved
so that we can work towards a win-win situation,'' he said.
	   Dr Chan, who is also Deputy Chief Minister and Minister for
Social Development, said this when opening the second session of
the Apec Sub- committee on Customs Procedures in Kuching yesterday.
	   Among those present at the three-day function were the deputy
director- general of Customs Malaysia Madehi Koleh, Sarawak's state
director of Customs Frankie Nyamboi, and about 80 officers from the
18 Apec member countries.
	   On the economic problems in Asia, Dr Chan said in today's
increasingly borderless economy, economic problems in one nation
could spread to its neighbours as well.
	   He said what followed ever since the Thai baht nosedived in July
last year was a clear manifestation of the need for the region to
strengthen and enhance its economic co-operation.
	   ``There is an urgent need for countries in the region to
seriously work out new economic strategies and work together to
combat the economic attacks staged by giant economic syndicates.''
	   Dr Chan said the more advanced economies should also co-operate
and perovide assistance to ensure an early economic recovery of the
affected countries because the economic turmoil would eventually
affect them as well.

	   JAKARTA (JP): More than 500 workers grouped in the
transportation sector trade union (SPTI) staged a demonstration in
front of the United States Embassy here yesterday, urging the U.S.
government to press the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to
immediately disburse pledged loans to help low-income Indonesians.
	   The workers, mostly bus drivers and ship crew members, sang
patriotic songs as they held up banners urging the U.S. to take
steps to ensure that the loan move forward.
	   Under the watchful eye of dozens of police and military
personnel, the workers demanded to meet with the U.S. ambassador.
	   After intense negotiations, two embassy staff members agreed to
receive five representatives from the workers.
	   Ch. David, chairman of the trade union, said they were not able
to meet Ambassador Stapleton Roy, but were received by Richard
Gong, a United States Information Service director, and Mark
Hunter, the security attache.
	   ``We lodged our petition and the embassy staff pledged to send
it to U.S. President Bill Clinton,'' he said.
	   Separately, over 100 workers of Masterina ceramic factory in
East Jakarta staged a sit-in protest at the Ministry of Manpower
here yesterday to protest their employer's reluctance to raise
wages.
	   ``We will stay here until the management meets our demand,''
Burhanuddin, a worker representative, said.
	   He said the company's management refused to abide by an
agreement made after an initial strike last month which stated that
wages would be raised between 30 percent and 50 percent.
	   ``In a tripartite negotiation which involved the ministry
following the first labor strike last month, the management agreed
to raise wages,'' he said.
	   Burhanuddin admitted that workers were already being paid in
accordance to the government-set monthly minimum wage of Rp
172,000, but pointed out that such a salary was not enough to
provide for the workers' daily necessities.
	   Sahat S., a staff member of the industrial relations directorate
at the ministry, said after receiving the workers' representatives
that his directorate would call on the company's management to
resume negotiations.

	   EARNINGS from the export of timber products are anticipated to
decrease slightly in the first quarter of this year, judging from
the industry's sluggish performance since July last year.
	   ``We forecast the total earnings to fall to RM13.2 billion for
the first three or four months (of this year),'' Primary Industries
Minister Datuk Seri Dr Lim Keng Yaik said in Kuala Lumpur
yesterday.
	   Last year, earnings from timber products totalled RM14.7
billion, up six per cent from RM13.89 billion in 1996.
	   Conversely, palm oil exports are expected to bring in RM18.6
billion.
	   Last year earnings from the commodity totalled RM12.7 billion.
	   Dr Lim said this after chairing a dialogue with representatives
from the Malaysian Panel Products Manufacturers Association, Panel
Products of Sarawak Timber Association and Sabah Timber Industries
Association.
	   In the two-hour meeting, several issues were raised by the
associations, including the effect of the region's economic
slowdown and weak ringgit on the plywood market.
	   The price of a three-millimetre plywood, for instance, has
dropped to US$240 per cubic metre from US$420 per cubic metre last
year.
	   ``Some of the millers are facing difficulties in exporting
plywood because they cannot export at that price. (Due to the
problems) I was informed that most of the `big' millers are losing
some RM1 million a month.''
	   Besides the plunge in plywood prices, Dr Lim said exporters also
had to contend with high freight charges.
	   He cited the rates at Ston Port, in the United Kingdom, which
had increased to US$1,100 (about RM3,900) per TEUs (twenty-foot
equivalent units) from US$950 per TEUs.
	   The associations had also asked that the interest rate of the
Export Credit Refinancing scheme be reduced to the 1984 level of
4.5 per cent.
	   ``They found the current rate of 10.8 per cent too high,'' said
Dr Lim, adding that the associations would submit a proposal to the
Finance Ministry on this.
	   Dr Lim said the associations were confident of increasing the
volume of plywood orders by 30 per cent, if the interest rate was
reduced.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim had last month
announced that the Government had increased the allocation for
credit facilities to RM4 billion from less than RM2 billion
previously.
	   Of this, RM3 billion would be channelled through the ECR scheme,
which was managed by Exim Bank and made available through all
banks.
	   Some RM1 billion more would be in the form of Exim Bank
supplier, buyer and overseas investment credit facilities.
	   Modelled after South Korea's trade financing facilities, the ECR
scheme was introduced in 1977. Exim Bank took over its management
from Bank Negara in January, last year.

NATO and Russia agree on danger, differ on method
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES possible exercise date, fresh details, new Cohen
quote &QL; 
 &UR; With NATO-Albania
 &UR; By JEFFREY ULBRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - Russia and the NATO allies agreed
Friday that the explosive situation in Kosovo represents a grave
danger to its neighbors, but differed on how to deal with defiant
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen, who had a private meeting
with Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev and another as part of
the NATO-Russia Permanent Joint Council, stressed the urgency of
finding a Kosovo solution.
	   ``We are looking at a very short time frame ... to solve this
peacefully,'' he told a news conference at the end of a two-day
North Atlantic Treaty Organization defense ministers' meeting.
	   On Thursday, NATO decided to conduct a demonstration of allied
air power over Albania and Macedonia in hopes of impressing
Milosevic and making him rethink his policy of escalating violence
in the southern province of Kosovo.
	   That demonstration, codenamed Determined Falcon, will probably
be early next week, perhaps as soon as Sunday, and will involve
simulated air attacks and bombing raids.
	   ``We are going to have the participation of a large number of
allies and a wide spectrum of aircraft,'' said a NATO official.
	   The ministers also ordered military planners to study options
for further action ranging from accelerated planning for military
exercises in the region to direct air strikes inside Yugoslavia and
use of air mobile ground troops.
	   Cohen said there was a great ``sense of urgency among NATO
members'' that something must be done quickly to stop Milosevic's
attacks on ethnic Albanians, who make up 90 percent of the
population in Kosovo.
	   The rebel Kosovo Liberation Army is seeking independence, an
aspiration NATO does not support.
	   ``NATO, all the ministers, and Russia have a unanimous attitude
toward the events in Kosovo,'' said Sergeyev. ``Our differences are
in assessment, approach and methods.''
	   He said Russia ``is convinced we haven't exhausted all
non-military means ... to resolve this crisis.'' If ``other
methods'' must be adopted, he said, they ``should be the
prerogative of the U.N. Security Council.''
	   Cohen said Russia risked isolation if it blocked international
efforts.
	   ``Russia obviously would have to take into account its own
perception of events in Kosovo, and also take into account that it
might be isolated in the world community if it does not seek a way
to bring whatever leverage it can to bring Milosevic to the
table,'' said Cohen.
	   Macedonia has not yet given its authorization for the planned
military exercises over its territory, but Albania is delighted
with the decision to show force.
	   ``We are very pleased about the decision taken by the NATO
Council yesterday,'' Albanian Defense Minister Luan Hajdaraga said
in an interview.
	   ``The stand of Milosevic in the Kosovo crisis is very clear, it
is to dominate the situation by military means.'' The danger is, he
said, that ``those means can spread to Albania.''
	   Gen. Henry Shelton, chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff,
couldn't give details of exactly what form the exercises would
take, saying they were still being developed by NATO planners. Nor
could he say what might trigger a direct military intervention in
Kosovo.
	   ``War is an extension of politics by other means,'' he said,
quoting German military philosopher Carl von Clausewitz.
	   ``There is still a whole host of other things to be done,'' he
added.
	   The NATO-Russia Permanent Joint Council was formed a year ago as
part of the effort to ease Russia's fears about NATO enlargement.
It has become a forum for consultation on security issues as well
as planning future cooperation.
	   A joint statement at the end of the meeting said the ministers
discussed Kosovo and ``condemned Belgrade's massive and
disproportionate use of force as well as violent attacks by Kosovar
Albanian extremists.''
	   NATO must walk a fine line between trying to halt the Yugoslav
government's ``disproportionate use of force'' and offering aid and
comfort to the rebels seeking independence, which NATO opposes, and
has been careful to condemn the violence on both sides.
	   Cohen also took pains to assure that NATO actions ``not be seen
in any way as approving independence.''

	   ACETAI Corporation Sdn Bhd, the manufacturing and marketing arm
of biscuits manufacturer Hwa Tai Industries Bhd, is confident of
achieving a 20 per cent growth in sales this year in view of the
continued good demand in the local food-based industry.
	   Last year, Acetai recorded a RM60 million sales.
	   Managing director Denny Teh Chin Chye yesterday said the
company's confidence of meeting the target was reflected in the
recent expansion of its manufacturing facilities in Batu Pahat,
Johor.
	   ``We spent about RM10 million to install the latest equipment
and machinery at the plant which will make it more efficient and
cost- effective,'' he said, without disclosing further details of
the plant.
	   Teh was speaking to reporters after the signing of a
distributorship agreement between Acetai and Japan-based Meiji Milk
Products Co. Ltd in Kuala Lumpur.
	   The signing ceremony was witnessed by Housing and Local
Government Minister Datuk Dr Ting Chew Peh.
	   Acetai has been appointed the sole distributor of Meiji Milk's
range of milk products in the country.
	   Meiji Milk is one of the largest companies in the dairy-based
manufacturing industry in Japan. It posted sales turnover of more
than RM16 billion last year and 10 per cent of this came from its
milk products business.
	   Acetai will be distributing the latter's infant formula milk
powder at its extensive sales network of 12,000 nationwide. It is
considering manufacturing the products locally.
	   ``But this will only happen in the long term,'' Teh said.
	   He said Acetai hopes to capture a five per cent share in the
infant milk market in the country, estimated to be around RM6
million annually, in the first 12 months.

	   JAKARTA (JP): More than 3,000 students in the Greater Jakarta
Students Forum (Forum Kota) held a peaceful demonstration outside
the House of Representatives compound yesterday, demanding the
establishment of an Indonesian People's Committee to run a
transitional government.
	   Soldiers prevented the students from entering the compound which
forced the protesters to air their demands outside. This created a
massive traffic jam on the busy Gatot Subroto highway.
	   The students, who came from several universities and institutes
in Greater Jakarta, were undeterred as they waved banners and held
a free-speech forum outside the compound gates. They also demanded
lower prices of basic commodities.
	   They warned that choking prices could drive people to anarchy.
	   ``Lower prices are not an unrealistic demand but also a moral
obligation for the government,'' Irese, the spokesman of the forum
told journalists.
	   She said many, especially poor laid-off workers, were facing
starvation.
	   One of the principal demands of the students yesterday was the
establishment of an Indonesian People's Committee to run the
country in order to restore confidence.
	   ``The establishment of the committee is aimed at creating a
credible and widely accepted transitional government and its main
task is to help defuse the national crisis and to carry out a
general election as soon as possible to elect a new and permanent
government,'' said Irese.
	   Abdullah, another demonstrator, said that the student community
would cooperate with other competent institutions to seek credible
people to form the committee.
	   ``(But) ABRI will have an opportunity to sit on the committee,''
he said.
	   After nearly two hours of banner-waving and speeches in front of
the compound in South Jakarta, the students departed on a convoy of
45 cars and buses circling the city.
	   Three hours later, after a ride which took them from one end of
the city to the other, they dispersed in Kemayoran, Central
Jakarta.
	   March
	   Meanwhile, around 50 students, who called themselves Students
Solidarity for People's Sovereignty (SMKR) held a long march in
Yogyakarta to express their deep concern over the worsening
political and economic situation.
	   Carrying banners and flags, the students screamed anti-Soeharto
slogans and blamed the former president and his corrupt government
for the dire state of the nation.
	   ``The present situation had many things to do with former
president Soeharto's corrupt government and, even, Habibie's
government is unable to defuse the crisis while more people are
facing starvation,'' said one demonstrator.
	   The demonstrators ended their long march, which took them across
the city, at the Yogyakarta provincial council building where they
held a free-speech forum.
	   Their demands to meet legislators failed as none were there to
receive them.
	   Imam, a rally organizer, expressed regret that political
developments following the reform movement have led to greater
division and friction among existing social groups in society.
	   ``The political elites have become trapped in the establishment
of new political parties and ignored the worsening conditions,'' he
said.
	   SMKR coordinator Sumarto urged all the people's representatives
in the House and provincial councils in all provinces to step down
if they were unable to solve the nation's problems.
	   ``What have the people's representatives done to make prices
lower. The state institutions should be dismissed if they do
nothing to calm the situation,'' he said.

Security Council moves toward new, tough sanctions against UNITA,
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBERT H. REID &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Urged by the U.N. special representative
in Angola, the Security Council moved Friday to impose new
sanctions against UNITA to punish the former rebel movement for
failing to meet its obligations under a peace plan.
	   The three nations overseeing the Angolan peace process _ the
United States, Russia and Portugal _ reached agreement late
Thursday on a draft resolution which would freeze UNITA's foreign
bank accounts, ban the purchase of diamonds mined in UNITA areas
and prohibit most contacts with officials in regions where the
central government is not in control.
	   UNITA is believed to earn up to a half a billion dollars a year
from diamond sales. Subject to Security Council approval, those
measures would take effect June 25 unless UNITA relinquishes
control of certain key areas, including Bailundo, Andulo, Mungo and
Nharea.
	   At the council's morning session, however, council President
Antonio Monteiro of Portugal announced that several members had put
forward ``considerable'' amendments and supplementary proposals.
	   The council was to resume meeting Friday afternoon to see
whether all 15 members could agree on a final text. It was unclear
when a vote could be taken.
	   Under the 1994 peace agreement, signed in Lusaka, Zambia, UNITA
_ a Portuguese acronym for the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola _ agreed to hand back to the government the
entire 50 percent of the country it seized during the civil war.
	   UNITA also agreed to demobilize its fighters and integrate them
into the national army in return for a role in the government. But
implementation has been slow, and the United Nations blames UNITA
for most of the delays.
	   Last October, the Security Council imposed air and travel
sanctions against UNITA, in addition to an oil and weapons embargo
in effect since 1993.
	   The U.N. special representative to Angola, Alioune Blondin Beye,
asked the council last Friday to crack down on UNITA. Diplomatic
sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said he threatened to
resign if the council failed to take strong action.
	   Beye said earlier this month that UNITA was hiding armed men in
remote areas of the vast southwest African nation, despite the
movement's pledge that it demobilized its 70,000-strong guerrilla
army. UNITA has denied the allegation.
	   UNITA fought a civil war for nearly two decades against the
government following Angola's 1975 independence from Portugal. An
estimated 500,000 people died in the continent's longest civil war
before the government and UNITA signed the 1994 peace accord.

World Cup: Japan subdued in Toulouse ahead of opening match
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By YURI KAGEYAMA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOULOUSE, France (AP) _ World Cup excitement has yet to hit the
Japanese team, who arrived Friday in Toulouse for their first game
in their first World Cup.
	   ``My players are great. They aren't nervous, but their
concentration isn't down either,'' coach Takeshi Okada said after
practice in a suburban stadium, held behind closed doors as has
been standard recently.
	   ``There's no change from when we were in Aix-Les-Bains,'' said
defender Akira Narahashi, 26, referring to the resort-town training
camp that the team left earlier in the day.
	   ``When the game approaches closer, then maybe my excitement will
grow,'' 26-year-old midfielder Hiroaki Morishima said. ``If I came
this far, I'd sure like to stand on the pitch.''
	   Okada is not announcing the lineup to his players until right
before the game against Argentina Sunday because ``they already
know,'' he said.
	   Reporters were allowed to catch the last 15 minutes of practice,
when the forwards and midfielders were shooting and a couple of
defenders were going over heading.
	   In the closed session, the team went over their strategies for
the last time, Okada said.
	   Okada has said Japan plans to play a more defensive game, using
a tight one-on-one defense, and going for a counterattack when the
opportunity arises.
	   ``Now, I have nothing to do,'' Okada said. ``I did everything I
can do.''
	   The team will practice right at the World Cup stadium Saturday.
But it will be a light routine to prepare for the match, which is
sure to be a historic one for Japan, win or lose.

	   THE contractor carrying out work to upgrade Jalan Gasing from
four lanes to six will be asked to implement proper project site
management to ensure better traffic flow in the area.
	   Petaling Jaya Municipal Council engineering department head
Abdul Haq Abdul Hamid said the contractor did not carry out the
project in phases but excavated the entire stretch from the Jalan
Changgai junction to near Jalan Templer roundabout in one go.
	   This resulted in earth spilling onto the road, large pipes
placed in front of homes and traffic congestion which has irked
residents in the area.
	   He was speaking at a Press conference after meeting with
residents, headed by David Boler and Petaling Jaya Selatan MP
Donald Lim over the issue at the engineering department at Menara
PJ in Petaling Jaya yesterday.
	   Abdul Haq said the contractor had numerous problems with service
utility companies which took too long to remove or realign their
cables, resultingin unnecessary delay.
	   The council is in the process of widening Jalan Gasing from
Jalan Changgai to the Jalan Templer roundabout to a three-lane dual
carriageway.
	   The council also plans to cover drains along the road to prevent
water from overflowing.
	   The residents had earlier brought up three major points for
discussion, one of which was to expedite the project which started
in January and is expected to be completed before the Commonwealth
Games.
	   Abdul Haq said residents had also asked the council to
reconsider using all six lanes as this would limit movement in and
out of their homes.
	   They have asked the council to reserve a lane on each side of
the road as an emergency lane.
	   He said the council would open only two lanes for traffic and
leave one lane for local traffic such as residents reversing out of
their homes and for school buses to wait for students.
	   Residents also asked that a tonnage limit be set for heavy
vehicles such as lorries.
	   Abdul Haq said the residents' suggestions would be taken into
consideration and discussed at the next Traffic Committee meeting.

Albanian militants kill Serb policemen near Kosovo capital
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in graf 3 with one ethnic Albanian reported killed,
seven villages said under attack; changes sourcing on 15,000
fighters. TRIMS. &QL; 
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC;

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Ethnic Albanian militants, boldly
stepping up their attacks, killed two Serb policemen just a few
miles from Kosovo's capital and on Friday said they command 15,000
fighters across the secessionist province.
	   Fighting between Serbian forces and the militants erupted again
in the Decani region in western Kosovo, close to the border with
Albania. It was a Serbian offensive there last week that prompted
NATO Thursday to announce a show of air power to persuade Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic to halt such assault.
	   Ethnic Albanian sources claimed that seven villages in the
Decani area were under attack Friday, including from grenade
launchers normally issued to the Yugoslav army. They said one
Albanian, named as Rexhep Mazrekaj, 38, was killed.
	   There was no independent confirmation of their report, but the
state-run Tanjug news agency in Belgrade reported that a Serb
policeman was seriously hurt in what it called an attack by ``armed
Albanian terrorists'' near one of the villages, Prilep.
	   Ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs nine-to-one in Kosovo. Most
seek independence from Serbia, which in 1989 stripped the province
of broad autonomy and has ruled repressively since. More than 250
people have been killed since Serbian police started a crackdown
against Albanian militants in March.
	   Serb sources in the province said two policemen where killed and
one was seriously wounded in an overnight ambush by separatists
near Obilic, just 7 kilometers (4.3 miles) northwest of the
provincial capital Pristina. Ethnic Albanian sources claimed one
Albanian was wounded in the same incident.
	   According to other information reaching Pristina, separatists
control a stretch of road near Suva Reka, 40 kilometers (25 miles)
southwest of the capital, severing its link to the key trading town
of Prizren near the Albanian border.
	   Albanian sources further reported Serb attacks on villages in
the Obilic and adjacent Vucitrn regions, saying residents fled and
spent the night under open skies.
	   The ethnic Albanian daily Bujku reported Friday five ethnic
Albanians and seven Serbs were killed in clashes Thursday in Suvo
Grlo in the Drenica area 30 kilometers (20 miles) west of Pristina.
	   Bujku said the fighting was fierce, with villagers determined to
``resist to the end with the help of the KLA.''
	   NATO is planning simulated air attacks in Albania and Macedonia,
adjoining Kosovo, to try and persuade Milosevic to halt military
action.
	   On Friday, Western foreign ministers met in London with their
Russian counterpart to step up pressure. Britain, which is weighing
a United Nations' move to back use of NATO force in Kosovo, called
on Milosevic to pull back his troops immediately.
	   The United States, Canada, Britain, France, Italy and Germany
said they would ``take steps to ban'' flights by Yugoslav Airlines,
British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said.
	   Kosovo Albanians welcomed the NATO moves. Nobody in former
Yugoslavia proved able to strike Milosevic, said Eroll Haxhiu, 46,
selling jewelry in Pristina market. ``America can and should do
it.''
	   Members of Kosovo's Serb minority _ whom Milosevic promised to
protect when taking power in Serbia in 1987 _ were alternately
gloomy and defiant.
	   Leaders ``ruined the good country we had (old Yugoslavia), and
they will ruin this one too,'' said Vasilje Stefanovic, a pensioner
from Prizren. ``We are to blame for everything that is happening.
We deserve it.''
	   ``If they attack us, they'll be attacking a sovereign country,''
said Jovan Banjanin, 40, who declined to state his occupation. ``We
will have to defend ourselves, and this has nothing to do with the
Albanian issue.''
	   Ethnic Albanian media in Kosovo on Friday carried a statement
from the Kosovo Liberation Army _ the main militant group _
demanding it get a new war tax to be levied on Kosovo Albanians
working abroad to fund the fight against the Serbs.
	   The KLA, a shadowy group which first emerged in 1996, named
Jakup Krasniqi, 47, a teacher from the Drenica region, as its
spokesman. According to the Albanian state news agency ATA, it said
it commands 15,000 fighters Kosovo-wide.

	   PERAK hopes the proposed ``take-over'' of Tenaga Nasional
Berhad's wholly- owned subsidiary TNB Janamanjung Sdn Bhd by
Malakoff Bhd will not slow down work on the coal-fired independent
power plant in Manjung, Perak.
	   Menteri Besar Tan Sri Ramli Ngah Talib said the State Government
is not questioning the deal but, ``our utmost concern is to ensure
proposed development programmes for the area proceeded as planned.
	   ``They (Janamanjung) had committed to build a 2001MW power plant
in Manjung. We hope the plan will be carried out smoothly,'' he
said in Ipoh yesterday.
	   Speaking after launching the State-level Bank Simpanan Nasional
Employees Savings Scheme, Ramli said although the State Government
believed that work on the IPP would not be affected, it would
monitor the development.
	   ``We are monitoring and would extend our help, in terms of
facilitating construction of buildings, land reclamation works and
other arising problems.''
	   The State Government, Ramli said, would co-ordinate work to
ensure its success as the project costing close to RM7 billion is
one single biggest investment in Perak in several years and would
become a catalyst for social and economic growth in and around the
area.
	   In a Memorandum of Understanding signed on Tuesday and which is
expected to be concluded within two months, Tenaga proposed to
inject its entire stake in TNB Janamanjung to Malakoff.
	   The power plant, the first coal-fired power plant project using
the pulverised fuel-firing technology, is said to be the biggest
such plant which has an IPP structure.
	   It will be built on 254ha of the 320ha reclaimed land in Teluk
Penchalang. Of the 254ha, 70ha is for the power plant and 175ha for
the ash pond. The remainder will be used as port facilities, coal
stockpiles and common access road.
	   The first stage of the project which will generate 700MW is
expected to begin commercial operation on June 1, 2001, with
subsequent units of 700MW to be generated in November 2001 and June
2002.
	   Construction is scheduled to commence in September.
	   The project will be conducted on a turnkey basis with
participation of up to 40 per cent local contractors.

	   JAKARTA (JP): The newly formed Chinese-Indonesian Reform Party
(Parti) denied accusations yesterday that it was ethnically
exclusive and that the use of Tionghoa (Chinese) in its name did
not reflect any disloyalty against the country.
	   ``If any other name was used, it would be meaningless. Why can't
we all just learn to be honest and be who we are?'' one of the
party's founders, lawyer Gunawan Tjahjadi, told The Jakarta Post.
	   He maintained that the party was being ``open, unpretentious and
honest''.
	   Gunawan further pointed out that Parti's membership was open to
all members of society, irrespective of religion or ethnicity.
	   He said the only membership requirement was a commitment to
reform and equality.
	   Members of the Haji Karim Oei Moslem Chinese Foundation
expressed concern Wednesday over Parti's establishment, saying it
was an ethnically based political party.
	   They said they feared that such a party would create ``harmful
repercussions'' for all Chinese-Indonesians.
	   The Chinese-Indonesian minority has often been targeted for
violence during times of economic hardship, largely because it
dominates the economy.
	   Chinese-Indonesians make up only 4 percent of the country's 202
million population.
	   Gunawan pointed out that his party placed Pancasila and the 1945
Constitution as major components of its founding principles.
	   He said Indonesia must learn to fully accept Chinese-Indonesians
as a part of the large mozaic makeup of the country.

	   IN the light of the recent cholera alert, the Petaling Jaya
Municipal Council is going all out to close down backyard food
manufacturers.
	   Kampung Tunku State Assemblyman Khoo Ooi Seng said the council's
Health Department would be carrying out a door-to-door operation
soon to nab offenders.
	   ``They are producing food under unhygienic conditions near
toilets and drains.
	   ``We want to avoid the outbreak of diseases, especially with the
Commonwealth Games around the corner,'' he said after attending the
council's Health Committee meeting yesterday.
	   Khoo said the manufacturers were involved in supplying food such
as cendol, pau, ice-cream and pickled fruits.
	   He said they would be moved to a hawker centre which was not
popular with the public.
	   ``They have to be relocated to a more suitable place. We can
allow them to operate in unpopular hawker centres like the one in
Damansara Kim,''
	   Khoo said.
	   He said by centralising the food producers, the council would be
able to monitor the level of hygiene at their businesses.
	   He said the council would concentrate on homes in Old Town which
have been identified by the Health Department as being premises for
backyard manufacturers.
	   On the supply of water to hawker centres, Khoo said the council
would be providing metered water supply soon to the Jalan Othman
centre and another in Seri Setia.
	   He said the service would be extended to at least 200 hawkers
who would have to pay individual water bills.
	   Khoo said the council had approved 64 new business applications
for various trades such as restaurants, offices and workshops.

Stage sirs: Knighthoods for Ian Holm and David Hare
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: EMBARGOED for release at 2301 GMT Friday, time set by source &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Actor Ian Holm and playwright David Hare are the
latest knights of the English stage. Both received knighthoods in
the queen's birthday honors list announced Saturday.
	   Nobel Peace Prize-winner Joseph Rotblat, a nuclear scientist who
became an anti-nuclear activist, also was made a knight, as were
John Mortimer, creator of ``Rumpole of the Bailey,'' and conductor
John Eliot Gardiner, a maverick whose prodigious output includes
more than 150 recordings and the founding of several musical
bodies.
	   Stage director Peter Brook was made a Companion of Honor, an
exclusive order for people who have done ``conspicuous national
service.'' In more than a half-century of stage work, Brook has won
praise for classics, as well as experimental theater. His films
include ``Lord of the Flies'' in 1963 and ``Meetings With
Remarkable Men'' in 1978.
	   In the business world, a knighthood went to British Broadcasting
Corp. director-general John Birt and Sir Colin Marshall, chairman
of British Airways, was made a life peer.
	   Newly knighted actor Ian Holm, 66, received a 1981 Oscar
nomination for his role as an athletics coach in ``Chariots of
Fire,'' played ``King Lear'' this year on stage and television to
critical acclaim.
	   Sir David Hare, the 51-year-old anti-establishment playwright,
has achieved great success in London and on Broadway with a string
of acclaimed plays, including ``Skylight,'' ``Amy's View,'' ``The
Secret Rapture'' and ``Racing Demon.''
	   Wtiter John Mortimer, a lawyer, used his inside view of the
legal profession to create the irascible ``Rumpole,'' whose
popularity in novel form spread internationally with a successful
television version.
	   It was a very good year for honors in all areas of the arts.
	   In addition to the knights, Peter Cattaneo, director of
Britain's hit movie ``The Full Monty,'' received an MBE, or Member
of the Order of British Empire honor, as did jazz singer Carol Kidd
and Northern Ireland poet and playwright Damian Gorman.
	   Christopher Bruce, artistic director of the Rambert Dance
Company, got a CBE, or Commander of the Order of British Empire,
and so did cellist Steven Isserlis and biographer Victoria
Glendinning.
	   Writer Terry Pratchett, author of a series of comic fantasies,
received an OBE, or Officer of the Order of British Empire.
	   The government, which chooses the awards _ which numbered almost
1,000 this year _ included 175 people connected with health and
associated voluntary organizations to mark the 50th anniversary of
Britain's free National Health Service.
	   The honors are announced on the monarch's ``official'' birthday,
always a Saturday in June when military parades are held. The
queen's own birthday is April 21.
	   In descending order, the honors are life peerage, knighthoods,
CBE, MBE and OBE. The Companion of Honor is an exclusive and highly
prized award limited to 65 people at any one time.

	   GROWING awareness among Malaysian companies of the Millennium
Bug or the Y2K problem will benefit the information
technology-based Jen Group of companies which has already secured
RM10 million worth of work in this area.
	   The Jen group is an IT resource provider with capabilities in
systems integration, project management, software services,
recruitment of IT professionals as well as Y2K solutions.
	   It expects its turnover to go up by more than 30 per cent this
year to RM20 million from RM15 million last year.
	   The Petaling Jaya-based group is 100 per cent Malaysian-owned
and is made up of Jen Software Professional (JSP) Sdn Bhd, Jen
Consulting Services (JCS) Sdn Bhd and JSP Consulting Sdn Bhd.
	   The RM10 million worth of Y2K-related projects will be carried
out by JCS which also projected turnover from similar projects to
rise to RM30 million in the near future.
	   According to managing director Ang Kim Jhew, many Malaysian
companies have yet to address the Y2K problem effectively although
there are just as many which are addressing the problem, either
through in-house solutions or external expertise.
	   Y2K refers to the inability of earlier computer programmes to
recognise the Year 2000 as they use two digits to denote the year.
Calculations and time-sensitive functions will be in disarray if
the problem is not corrected.
	   JCS, a member of Pikom, licensed the Y2K methodology from Data
Dimensions, an American company which developed the methodology in
1991 and has used it to help 30 Fortune 500 companies seek
solutions to the Y2K problem.
	   ``Our staff at JCS are fully trained and well versed in the
methodology.
	   ``While we do not sell the methodology to companies seeking
assistance for the Y2K problem, we offer the services of our
trained staff.
	   ``Besides that, we conduct Y2K `Health Checks' where we carry
out complete reviews of all activities of a company and identify
areas where they are lacking in reaching Y2K compliance,'' said
Ang.
	   Philip Teh of JCS added that the company also examines the
``supply chain integrity'' of a company seeking Y2K compliance.
	   For instance, a large manufacturing concern depends on smaller
companies or vendors to supply parts.
	   So while the large company is Y2K compliant, its suppliers or
vendors may not be and that will cause a lot of problems.
	   The group, with clients ranging from the financial, oil and gas,
insurance, telcos and manufacturing sectors noted that since early
this year, the momentum has been picking up steadily with more
companies seeking Y2K compliance.
	   ``We attribute it to increasing awareness of the problem through
increasing publicity and government efforts, especially in the
financial sector.
	   ``For instance, Bank of Commerce Bhd, which is our client, has
been very proactive in seeking compliance.
	   ``Publicly-listed companies are also very proactive,'' said Ang.
	   In anticipation of more Y2K-related projects, Jen Group will be
hiring an extra 40 staff by the end of this year, bringing the
total staff strength to 250, from the modest 10 it started with in
1991.
	   Ang said small conversion projects to reach compliance may take
between three and four months while larger conversion projects may
take up to nine months. ``Health checks'' take one month to
complete.
	   Jen Software Professional, which adopted the System,
Applications and Products (SAP), a German business application
software, is the only SAP company in Malaysia to have operations in
Penang.
	   On the outlook of its IT recruitment business, Ang said the
economic slowdown had affected it by 40 per cent but this has been
off-set by clients seeking to outsource work since they do not have
the staff strength to carry out the work internally.
	   Ang was quick to point out that there were still a lot of
IT-related jobs in the country and refuted claims that there was a
surplus of IT professionals in Malaysia.
	   He added that the country needs more such people and there was a
general shortage being experienced overseas.
	   The group is looking into the possibility of either being listed
on the Second Board of the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange or on the
Malaysian Exchange of Securities Dealing and Automated Quotation
(Mesdaq) in a year's time.

	   KUMPULAN Guthrie Bhd has successfully raised US$500 million
(about RM2 billion) for the Guthrie-Koll Fund, for the purpose of
investing in real estate in Malaysia.
	   However, due to the current economic slump, it will wait for the
right time to enter the market. The fund was intially expected to
be launched at the end of this year.
	   The Guthrie-Koll fund was jointly created and is managed by
Guthrie in collaboration with the Nasdaq-listed Koll Real Estate
Group of the United States.
	   Investors in the fund are medium-sized companies from the US.
Monies from the fund will be used to invest in properties here for
the medium- term, which will then be leased to American companies
operating in Malaysia.
	   These properties are expected to be those in need of financial
assistance.
	   Speaking after Guthrie Ropel Bhd's annual meeting in Kuala
Lumpur yesterday, chairman Tan Sri Abdul Khalid Ibrahim said the
fund will wait for the currency and property prices to stabilise
before investing.
	   As for Guthrie Ropel, based on its performance in the first
three months of this year, and the current high prices of palm oil,
Abdul Khalid expressed optimism of improved results for this year.
	   It has not embarked on plans to go into property development
although last year, the group voiced intentions to do so and went
to authorities in Johor for approval.
	   However, the process of planning and getting approvals will
continue.
	   ``It is unlikely that this year, we will embark on property
development, but will concentrate on rubber and palm oil
production,'' he said.
	   Commenting on the current low price of natural rubber in the
market, Abdul Khalid said it was time for the Government to review
the supply and demand for natural rubber since there is currently
an opportunity to improve its prices.
	   One way to do this is to either reduce the stock pile of rubber,
or remove the control over prices in the international market.
	   He added that Malaysia, a member of the International Natural
Rubber Organisation, should think about its independence in
controlling rubber prices.
	   Inro, which groups natural rubber producers and consumers,
attempts to stabilise prices within a band primarily through the
operation of a buffer stock. It buys natural rubber from the market
to support prices when they are too low and sells from the
stockpile to contain high prices.
	   Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia are the top three natural
rubber producing countries while Inro's major importing members are
the United States, China and the European Union.
	   Last month, Primary Industries Minister Datuk Seri Dr Lim Keng
Yaik said he and his Thai and Indonesian counterparts hoped to look
into the stand of the consuming countries within Inro, which had
been less than accommodating to producers' request for better
natural rubber prices.
	   Dr Lim said although the three major natural rubber producing
countries had faced significant currency depreciation, natural
rubber prices were in fact cheaper in terms of US dollars and
European currencies now than a year ago.
	   Dr Lim also expressed Malaysia's disappointment at Inro over its
inability to support natural rubber prices at fair and equitable
levels.
	   Abdul Khalid said if the price of natural rubber is allowed to
reflect supply and demand, it will also reflect the currency
fluctuation.
	   Asserting that Malaysia should have independence in controlling
its rubber price, he said Malaysia was not only a producer of
natural rubber but also a consumer.
	   ``The idea of Inro is to protect the manufacturers of
non-producing nations. Since Malaysia is both producer and
consumer, it is not necessary for it to protect only the
manufacturers of rubber products.
	   ``It is in the best interest of Malaysia to allow rubber prices
to find its own level,'' he said.
	   Guthrie is in favour of the free float of rubber prices as this
will indicate the real demand for rubber. Producers will also be
able to decide whether to continue producing rubber or not.
	   On edible oil, Abdul Khalid said the demand is expected to
continue to increase.
	   He said the situation in Pakistan and India may result in both
countries being unable to buy soybean oil from the US, in which
case, it may be good news for palm oil producers.

	   GENTING HIGHLANDS, Thurs. - Domestic tourism should act as the
catalyst for the overall recovery of the tourism industry in the
country, Culture, Arts and Tourism Minister Datuk Sabbaruddin Chik
said today.
	   He said the domestic tourism was a ``natural'' and readily
available market which would boost job opportunities in the
industry.
	   ``While more effort and money is needed to promote tourism at
the international level, promotion of domestic tourism can be done
rather easily,'' Sabbaruddin said when opening the Seri Malaysia
Hotel Genting at Goh Tong Jaya near here.
	   The minister also launched the Seri Malaysia Hotels website that
provides information on the chain's 16 hotels.
	   He urged local tour operators and hotels to help promote
domestic tourism by offering attractive packages and discounts in a
bid to stem the outflow of the ringgit by Malaysians going on
foreign tours.
	   Later at a Press conference, Sabbaruddin said the accommodation
sector of the tourism trade was an important component and last
year accounted for 35 per cent of the industry's RM10.5 billion
foreign exchange earnings.
	   ``In this regard it is important that those providing
accommodation give their best and get co-operation from others to
better this achievement,''
	   he said.
	   The Culture, Arts and Tourism Ministry's secretary-general Datuk
Ismail Adam, who is also chairman of Rangkaian Hotel Seri Malaysia
Sdn Bhd which owns the chain said last year, it registered an
average occupancy of 59.83 per cent.
	   ``Of this 88 per cent were Malaysians which is very good and in
line with our objective to provide quality and well-priced products
for domestic tourists,'' Ismail said.

	   THOMSON BankWatch has altered the outlook for South Korea's BBB
rating to ``negative'' from ``stable''.
	   Its director of sovereign risk analysis, Ms Betty J. Starkey,
said the economic outlook for South Korea appears to be worsening
and the timetable for a turnaround is likely to be further delayed.
	   She said the recently released figures for first quarter 1998
gross domestic product (GDP) growth revealed that the economy
contracted by 3.8 per cent, more sharply than most forecasts, and
the downturn is made worse by the occurrence of stagflation as
inflation looks set to over take previous estimates of 6.7 per
cent, reaching levels of 10 per cent or higher by the year-end.
	   Export growth slowed down for the first time in five months in
May, as exporters started to feel the effects of the steadily
weakening yen and a domestic credit crunch.
	   The declining yen poses a serious threat since nearly half of
all South Korean exports, namely in the car, shipbuilding, steel
and semiconductor sectors, compete against Japanese goods.
	   Starkey pointed out that high interest rates to defend the
external value of the won has hampered the ability of local firms
to repay their obligations, and the problem is exacerbated by the
very high debt-to- equity of South Korean firms.
	   With an estimate of 20 trillion won worth of bonds maturing this
month alone and the country's short-term domestic obligations being
rolled over, she said banks are unlikely to put up with this
situation for long given their own precarious situation.
	   The worsening short-term economic outlook appears to have
prompted the Government to ease its previous tough stance on
reforms, with banks being allowed to give loans to struggling firms
while some prominent chaebols have been propped up despite their
massive bad debts.
	   Reflecting the worsening outlook, the Kospi stock market index
fell to an 11-year low in the last week of May while spreads on
South Korean sovereign bonds issued in early April are trading
recently at around 415 basis point above the US Treasury notes.
	   Accordingly, foreigners are still reluctant to enter South
Korean markets and the economic downturn will likely continue
through the second and third quarters of 1998, Starkey said.
	   However in the midst of the generally depressed economic
picture, foreign currency reserves have risen steadily, quadrupling
from US$8.9 billion (US$1  &QC;  RM4) at end-1997 to US$38.76 billion at
end-May, while the current account surplus looks set to meet the
target of US$21 billion to US$23 billion, or around 6 per cent of
GDP required by the International Monetary Fund programme.

World Cup: Spanish technique, Nigerian spontaneity face off
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Kanu, Amokachi at Nigerian practice Friday,
Milutinovic quote. Edits accordingly. No pickup. &QL; 
 &UR; By CIARAN GILES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NANTES, France (AP) _ Flair and technique versus speed and
spontaneity. That's the bill of fare as Spain's most compact team
in years takes on Olympic champion Nigeria Saturday in the World
Cup opener for both teams.
	   The two are favorites to qualify from Group D, generally
recognized as the closest to a ``Group of Death'' here.
	   ``We're playing the toughest team in the most difficult group,''
said Spain coach Javier Clemente, who calls this the best squad
he's ever had.
	   Spain went 8-2-0 in qualifying and has just one loss in its last
34 outings overall.
	   ``We're worried about Spain the same way Spain is worried about
Nigeria,'' said Nigeria coach Bora Milutinovic, leading his fourth
different team at the tournament. ``I put Spain right after the top
five teams: Brazil, Argentina, Germany, Italy and France.''
	   His Super Eagles come with a reputation for scant attention to
strategy, compensated by dazzling skills and blistering speed. They
displayed those traits in their 1994 cup debut, when they made the
second round and nearly knocked off Italy, and again in winning
Olympic gold in Atlanta two years after.
	   Milutinovic ran a one-hour, closed-door practice at the
Beaujoire Stadium Friday evening, and said afterwards that all 22
players are fit.
	   That means Nwankwo Kanu, the team's top player when healthy, is
a strong possibility to start in attack after being slowed at the
start of the week by a bad ankle. In addition, Daniel Amokachi _
who hurt his right knee in practice Tuesday _ should be available
off the bench.
	   ``I am so happy all my players trained today,'' Milutinovic
said. ``Kanu, Amokachi, everyone. Now we'll see which 11 I
choose.''
	   He has not had a healthy complement of players since taking over
the team in December, and Nigeria has been consistently bad in its
string of warmups ahead of France 98, dropping three games against
fellow qualifiers by a combined score of 9-1.
	   Clemente, however, believes the warmup results will have no
bearing, saying, ``Nigeria is a sensational team and one of the 10
favorites to win the cup.''
	   Milutinovic saw Spain's 4-1 drubbing of Northern Ireland last
week and said that while he admired the team's discipline, he
spotted some weak points he hopes to exploit.
	   With both teams fearing a morale-damaging defeat at the outset,
the coaches might not be scorned for caution.
	   Relying heavily on stars from European club champion Madrid and
domestic league titlist FC Barcelona, Clemente is likely to play a
conservative 4-4-2 combination with Andoni Zubizarreta, 36, in goal
for his fourth World Cup. Fleet-footed Alfonso Perez would be one
striker, with Kiko Narvaez a little behind.
	   Milutinovic has hinted he might be content to seek a draw
against Spain, which would mean a more contained, defense-minded
Nigeria.
	   That would be attributable, at least in part, to the slew of
injuries.
	   While Spain is healthy, Nigeria already has lost defender Jero
Shakpore to a broken collarbone and replaced him Wednesday with
Mobi Oparaku. In addition, first-choice keeper Ike Shorunmu and
veteran striker Emmanuel Amunike were not even brought to France
because of injury.
	   The team got some good news Thursday, though, when Inter Milan
striker Kanu rejoined the squad for full training. He was the star
of the 1996 Olympic performance three months before undergoing
heart valve surgery.
	   His comeback has been slowed by various leg injuries, and an
appearance Saturday would certainly boost the team.

Kafelnikov wins; last seed left at Gerry Weber Open

 &UR; EDS: ADDS Haarhuis beating Pozzi to complete semifinals &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HALLE, Germany (AP) _ Russia's Yevgeny Kafelnikov, the defending
champion, was the only seeded player left at the Gerry Weber Open
Friday after he ousted Magnus Norman in straight sets.
	   Kafelnikov, the second seed, reached the semifinals by beating
the eighth-seeded Swede, 7-6 (7-1), 6-2 in just over an hour as
unusual cold continued to plague the dlrs 875,000 grass court
event.
	   Richard Krajicek of the Netherlands, the third seed, struggled
with his returns and fell to Sweden's Magnus Larsson, 6-4, 6-2 in
an earlier match.
	   Krajicek, the 1996 Wimbledon champion, became the latest victim
after upsets had already claimed this year's Australian Open
champion, Petr Korda, and the recent winner of the French Open,
Spain's Carlos Moya.
	   Larsson took control of the match by whipping in a high
percentage of first serves after he gained a break against Krajicek
to take a 5-4 first set lead.
	   Krajicek, along with problems returning the Swede's serve, also
complained about the slippery center court. Despite the artificial
roof, moisture from ongoing rain has caused players to slip and
slide.
	   The hard-serving Dutchman, who reached Wimbledon's fourth round
last year, plans to play Rosmalen in the Netherlands next week.
	   ``It was very slippery out there,'' said Krajicek. ``I'm hoping
I can get some more practice at Rosmalen and that it will be
warmer.''
	   Kafelnikovk, who also reached the final two years ago, faces
Thomas Johansson in Saturday's semifinal after the Swede ended the
upset run of Germany's Hendrik Dreekmann.
	   Johansson struggled to a 6-3, 1-6, 6-4 victory over Dreekmann,
who had ousted Moya and Boris Becker. He plays Paul Haarhuis of the
Netherlands, who beat Italy's Gianluca Pozzi, 6-3, 7-6 (7-4).

	   PENANG, Thurs. - Penang is set to be the second State in the
country after Selangor to train emergency planning and response
experts when it offers a postgraduate degree in the field at the
end of the year.
	   Chief Minister Tan Sri Dr Koh Tsu Koon today said the one-year
masters programme in Emergency Planning and Response jointly
offered by Universiti Putra Malaysia and the Fire and Rescue
Services Department would commence in November.
	   ``This intake can accommodate up to 230 people whose jobs deal
with ocupational health and safety,'' he told reporters after
launching an exhibition in conjunction with the State-level Health
and Industrial Safety Week at the Caring Society Complex.
	   ``We hope this programme will see Penang producing a pool of
emergency response professionals at factories and offices dealing
with the health and safety of workers.''
	   Also present were Fire and Rescue Services Department
director-general Datuk Dr Soh Chai Hock, State Human Resources
Committee chairman Datuk Dr Kang Chin Seng and Universiti Putra
Malaysia's director of technology Dr Mohamed Daud.
	   Soh said the masters course would be held at the Fire and Rescue
Services Department at Seberang Prai for three days every two
weeks.
	   ``A pioneer batch of 21 who are now studying in Kuala Lumpur are
expected to graduate in October,'' he said.
	   Soh, who is also the Malaysian president of the United
Kingdom-based Institute of Fire Engineers, said graduates of the
programme would automatically be made associates of the institute.
	   ``After two years of practice, they will be accorded the status
of a chartered fire engineer in Europe,'' he added.
	   Meanwhile, Mohamed said the course fees were RM7,000, and that
factory managements could sponsor their employees for it.
	   He said entry requirements included: a bachelor's degree in
science, management or engineering and five year's working
experience, or an accredited diploma or completion of other
professional courses and 10 years' working experience.

	   A TOTAL OF 46,643 workers was retrenched between July last year
and June 6 this year, about 10 months after the financial crisis
hit the region.
	   Of this figure, 11,793 workers were laid off between July and
December 1997 while another 34,850 were laid off between January
and June 6 this year.
	   Local workers made up 86.7 per cent and the rest were foreign
workers, a statement released by the Human Resources Ministry said
yesterday.
	   The majority of the workers retrenched was from the
manufacturing sector, representing 60.5 per cent or 28,223 workers.
	   The Ministry also reported that the number of applications
submitted to the Home Ministry to import foreign workers or
re-deploy them in the manufacturing and plantation sectors
indicates that there are many job opportunities available in the
local labour market.
	   Between February 17 and June 4 this year, the technical
committee at the Home Ministry had approved applications to import
21,763 foreign workers and re-deploy 603 workers for the
manufacturing sector.
	   During the period, the committee received 325 applications for
77,431 foreign workers for the manufacturing and plantation
sectors.
	   For the plantation sector, the committee approved applications
to import 18,088 foreign workers and redeploy 329 workers.
	   According to the statement, the number of active job-seekers
registered with the ministry's Manpower Department between January
and May this year showed a rising trend.
	   The number of vacancies, however, has fluctuated, with a
significant increase between January and March but a decrease in
April, and an increase again in May. Placements for job-seekers
average 1,900 a month.
	   Meanwhile, the weekly retrenchment trend since February this
year showed that the number of workers laid off has decreased since
the third week of March.
	   The weekly average of workers being retrenched is about 1,600
per week.

	   I REFER to the letters by P. Chen and S.V. Vijaythevan (NST, May
21) and to the news report entitled ``Pensioners plead for
continuation of free medication'' (NST, May 25).
	   One of the functions of trade unions is to look after the
welfare of their members regarding fair terms of employment,
equitable wages, and housing and medical benefits.
	   The two umbrella organisations for workers, Cuepacs and the
Malaysian Trades Union Congress, recently made so much fuss over
chicken prices and called for a consumer boycott of the bird. They
are not tired of blowing their own trumpets about the ``success''
of what they ``masterminded''.
	   Now chicken prices are something the workers themselves can take
care of. If the prices are high, and workers don't buy chicken for
a week or two, prices would come down.
	   In the US, for example, housewives have been instrumental in
getting meat prices down - without the need for trade unionists to
``shout''.
	   Comparatively, the issue of medical benefits and medicine prices
is a cause of much concern to workers, particularly pensioners. Yet
the two organisations have not been seen to champion this issue.
	   Cuepacs and MTUC should redeem their ``chicken-feed'' image by
studying the reasons for deteriorating medical benefits coupled
with escalating costs and make appropriate representations to the
Government.
	   The organisations are in the best position to do so as they
represent that large section of the population that keeps the
wheels of the country's economy turning. Not to take good care of
the health of these people is like neglecting proper maintenance of
aircraft - and we know what happens then.

	   RECONDITIONED equipment supplier United Bintang Bhd expects a
further 15 per cent increase in its exports to help offset the
decline in local sales.
	   According to executive director Gary Loh, 15 per cent is a
conservative estimate and the number should actually be higher.
	   ``Before the turmoil started, we had taken steps to go overseas
to do business and we managed to send a lot of stocks to the US,
Canada and Europe,'' Loh said.
	   Loh was speaking to reporters after the group's annual general
meeting in Kuala Lumpur yesterday.
	   He added that the group managed to clear a very substantial
amount of stocks thus far. Existing stock in hand is currently
valued at RM40 million.
	   ``Seventy-five per cent of the existing stocks can be cleared
within this year. After we are finished with selling all of this,
we will embark on further purchases,'' he said.
	   United Bintang already has sales offices in the US and Canada.
It is intending to open another office in Dubai as soon as sales
are recorded.
	   Dubai is hoped to be its gateway to supplying reconditioned
equipments to Iran, Iraq and South Africa.
	   ``We hope the volume of business will increase tremendously with
our export ventures. We are at a starting point and after adapting
ourselves to the business environment, volume will increase in a
few years,'' Loh said.
	   The group is eyeing the US as its main export market as the
weakened ringgit will provide currency gains to United Bintang.
	   For the 1997 financial year, total value of exports was RM31
million.
	   Exports contribute some 80 per cent to United Bintang's sales.
	   Meanwhile, local sales dropped by some 70 per cent. However, Loh
is confident that the group can at least maintain the current level
of profitability.
	   United Bintang registered a pre-tax profit of RM3.81 million for
the financial year ended December 31 1997 compared with RM7.57
million in 1996.
	   Its turnover fell 31 per cent to RM89.91 million from RM129.6
million previously. After-tax profit dropped 54 per cent to RM2.38
million from RM5.15 million in 1996.

	   PEOPLE in the Klang Valley are suffering. They have no water.
Some have no more strength to wait in line and to carry water into
lifts or up flights of steps.
	   They do not have enough water to bathe and to flush their
toilets. The whole thing really stinks (literally too). Not only
are they short of water, but much-needed answers, too.
	   The only thing that the public is not short of, and which they
do not need at all, is the growing realisation of the many
shortcomings of those in charge - bureaucrats whose many
explanations have often held no water.
	   Instead of regular buckets of water, the public has to contend
with the buck-passing of officials, who, very often, water down the
sufferings of the people with their many misplaced assurances.
	   Unbelievably, not only have the people been deprived of constant
water supply, they have also been denied of an opportunity to voice
their frustrations and to demand accountability from the powers
that be. A public forum (which was very much a people's initiative)
to discuss the water crisis had to be called off.
	   The organisers had made it very clear that they had no political
agenda.
	   The relevant authorities had been invited to present their views
and to provide much needed clarification. There was really nothing
to hide.
	   In fact, the Press had reported on June 1 that the Selangor
Waterworks Department had asked for help from non-governmental
organisations to disseminate information on the water crisis and to
provide feedback - the forum, could, therefore, have been an
excellent opportunity.
	   The response of Selangor Menteri Besar Datuk Abu Hassan Omar
was, to say the least, very disappointing. A letter from his office
was sent to the organisers of the public forum requesting them to
cancel the forum.
	   If Abu Hassan was really convinced that the forum ``would
confuse the public'' he could have seized the opportunity to send
his men there to ensure that clarity be the order of the day.
	   Sad to say, once again the public has been made to appear the
fool and portrayed as being incapable of engaging in an intelligent
discussion over an issue which has drastically affected their daily
lives.
	   Public participation, feedback and criticism should be given a
place in society. The right to dissent is very much a part of the
democratic process.
	   People are more educated now. They are more aware of their
rights.
	   Surely they deserve more respect from the very people they have
elected.
	   Representatives of the rakyat should encourage public discussion
and debate rather than shy away from, or stop, them.
	   Surely after 40 years of independence our politicians should
expect and allow a greater level of fair comment and a demand for
greater accountability and transparency.

	   FOUR private companies will take over solid waste management
from 90 local authorities by the end of this year, said Housing and
Local Government Minister Datuk Dr Ting Chew Peh said.
	   The Government had urged the concerned local authorities, Ting
said, to expedite the signing of interim agreements with these
firms and enable the takeover to be carried out in stages.
	   The minister was speaking after witnessing the signing of a
distributorship pact between Meiji Milk Products Co Ltd and Acetai
Corp Sdn Bhd in Kuala Lumpur yesterday.
	   The four companies which will manage solid waste disposal are
Alam Flora Sdn Bhd (a subsidiary of DRB-Hicom Group), Northern
Waste Industries, Southern Waste Management Sdn Bhd and MMC
Engineering.
	   Ting said, ``The interim period (before the takeover is
completed) is good for the companies involved as it gives them the
chance to prove their waste management capabilities.'' The interim
agreements between the local authorities and these companies will
be in effect until the Solid Waste Management and Cleansing Bill
and several other related Bills are passed by Parliament, he added.
	   So far, he said, only three local authorities have signed
interim agreements and these are Kuala Lumpur City Hall (with Alam
Flora in January last year), Johor Baru Tengah District Council and
the Pasir Gudang local authorities (with Southern Waste
Management).
	   Ting said in Sabah and Sarawak, the process of transferring
waste management to MMC Engineering may be slower as the company
has to seek the approval of the state government.

Sampras goes out in Wimbledon warmup
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMS; UPDATES with Sampras quotes; Add last quarterfinal
results

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Just 10 days before Wimbledon begins, Mark
Woodforde detects a lack of motivation in Pete Sampras' game.
	   But Sampras, beaten by the Australian 6-3, 6-2 in a third-round
match Friday on grass at the Queen's Club, begs to differ.
	   ``This tournament has always been a bit of a wake-up call for
me,'' Sampras said. ``I'm disappointed but the main goal is
Wimbledon.''
	   ``You never like losing, but if you take a step back and look at
how I've done at Wimbledon, I've always seemed to put what happened
here behind me.''
	   ``When Wimbledon comes around and I'm on Centre Court, I think
guys know I play pretty well there,'' Sampras added. ``It's nice to
have that on your side. I feel l'm going to be tough to beat, I
really do.''
	   Friday's defeat was the latest surprising loss for the four-time
and defending Wimbledon champion. He has struggled most of the year
and was ousted in the second round of the French Open by
little-known Ramon Delgado of Paraguay.
	   Sampras had beaten the 66th-ranked Woodforde in all of their
previous 10 matches.
	   But this time, Woodforde mixed up his shots, returned well and
often caught Sampras with lobs whenever the American ventured to
the net. But his most effective tactic was to hit a succession of
drop volleys which fell just over the net and left Sampras
stranded.
	   The Australian also served far better than Sampras, hitting
three aces in the opening game to set the tone of the match.
	   In contrast, Sampras produced four double-faults, the last of
which gave Woodforde a break for 3-2 in the second set. A netted
backhand volley then gave Woodforde a second break for 5-2.
	   ``Everyone is aware that, motivation-wise, he's (Sampras) not
there,'' Woodforde said.
	   ``I played a pretty good tight match against him, and he just
wasn't able to pick it up where in the past he was able to take it
up a notch or two,'' said Woodforde, known primarily as a doubles
specialist. ``That's where he is found wanting.''
	   In addition to its top seed, Queen's also lost No. 2 Greg
Rusedski of Britain, who suffered an ankle injury Friday during his
third-round match against Italian qualifier Laurence Tieleman.
	   A doctor and a trainer agreed that U.S. Open runner-up Rusedski
_ ranked No. 4 in the world _ was less than a 50-50 bet to be ready
for Wimbledon.
	   Tournament doctor Johnnie Gaynor said there was no fracture, but
said he had a severe sprain to one of three ligaments.
	   ``It is impossible to tell how long it will take to heal,''
Gaynor said. ``He'll rest for two or three days and then begin
therapy.''
	   ATP trainer Doug Spreen was doubtful.
	   ``There are definitely some question marks about Wimbledon for
Greg,'' he said.
	   With the score at 2-2 in the first set, Rusedski slipped while
stretching for a backhand volley and fell awkwardly with his left
leg buckling beneath him.
	   Rusedski screamed in pain and writhed on the grass before being
carried off the court and taken to a hospital for X-rays.
	   In order to clear up a backlog of matches caused by rain delays,
players Friday played two matches _ third round and quarterfinals _
to get the tournament back on track.
	   Woodforde later reached the Saturday semifinals with a 6-3, 1-6,
6-2 quarterfinal win over Thomas Enqvist of Sweden, seeded No. 8.
	   Also in the quarterfinals, 14th-seeded Byron Black of Zimbabwe
defeated Brian MacPhie of the United States, 7-5, 6-1, and
Australian Scott Draper defeated Doug Flach of the United States
7-6 (9-7), 7-6 (7-5).
	   Italy's Laurence Tieleman ended Britain's hopes in the
tournament with a three set win over No. 7 seed Tim Henman.
	   Tieleman defeated Henman 2-6, 7-6 (7-9), 6-4. Henman had his
winning chances, serving for the match at 5-3 and another match
point at 5-4 in the second set but missed both opportunities.

	   AFFIN Holdings Bhd will adopt prudent measures to cushion the
current economic slowdown and not simply focus on its traditional
core business.
	   Managing director Datuk Lodin Wok Kamaruddin says the group will
focus on the productive sectors such as export-oriented activities,
plantation, agriculture and industries of national importance, and
the production of food for future expansion.
	   ``This is in line with the Government's effort to place
financial institutions in the front line of steering the economy
towards a sustainable recovery,'' he says in his annual statement.
	   He adds that the group is also targeting to maintain a moderate
growth for its loan portfolio through the group finance company,
Affin Finance Bhd.
	   It will focus on small and medium-scale enterprises engaged in
manufacturing, and the development and end-financing of low- and
medium- cost houses.
	   He says this is part of its strategies and priorities to
strengthen the group and prepare it to meet the challenges in the
next millennium.
	   Affin posted a group pre-tax profit of RM209 million for the
financial year ended December 31 1997 from RM360 million the
previous year.
	   However, operating revenue increased from RM1.23 billion in 1996
to RM1.80 billion, while profit after tax and zakat was RM105
million compared with RM238.19 million previously.
	   Earnings per share surged substantially from 41.4 sen to 19.2
sen.
	   On the group's financial results, Lodin says major contributions
to the group earnings came from commercial and merchant banking
with 96.5 per cent.
	   This is followed by investment holdings with 9.1 per cent and
general insurance with 2.3 per cent.
	   Meanwhile, the group's banking arm Perwira Affin Bank Bhd (PAB)
registered a pre-tax profit of RM248.50 million, down 17 per cent
compared with RM301 million in 1996.
	   PAB shareholders' fund, however, increased to RM1.40 billion
compared with RM126 million in 1991.
	   The bank's interest-free banking operations completed another
year of growth with income rising from RM12.4 million in 1996 to
RM25.20 million, an increase of 103 per cent.
	   Assets under Islamic banking doubled to RM548 million during the
year under review, making PAB one of the top three banks in
Malaysia offering Islamic banking.
	   Commenting on the drop in PAB''s pre-tax profit despite being
the major contributor to the group earnings, Lodin says it was
attributed mainly to net increase in provisions for bad and
doubtful debts of RM189 million, in compliance with Bank Negara
guidelines.
	   The group's insurance company, Guardian Royal Exchange Assurance
(M) Bhd, posted a pre-tax profit of RM12.78 million, while profits
from investments including realised capital gain were RM3.52
million.
	   Net premium income increased 15.9 per cent to RM98.18 million
from RM84.73 million before.

	   THEY are not kind to one's waistline but who can resist the
delightful desserts that Etoile Bistro at the Equatorial Kuala
Lumpur is offering?
	   Imagine an unlimited supply of Haagen-Dazs ice-cream, crepes,
Mrs Fields cookies, cakes, savouries and pastries! While buffet
meals have become a standard feature of many restaurants in Kuala
Lumpur, none has yet to offer a dessert buffet.
	   Haagen-Dazs ice-cream flavours offered at the Etoile include
macadamia nut, chocolate chip, maple walnut brandied cherries,
strawberries vanilla and coffee.
	   With a little bit of creativity, one can mix and match the
ingredients at the pastry counter according to one's taste.
	   If one were to buy a pint of Haagen-Dazs outside, it will cost
close to RM20. At any Haagen-Daz outlet, a scoop will cost more
than RM5.50.
	   Basically, there is no way anyone can enjoy Haagen-Dazs
ice-cream as much as he or she likes without thinking about what
it'll do to the wallet! So with this dessert buffet, it is time for
ice-cream fans to rejoice.
	   The dessert buffet is an on-going feature of the bistro and the
hotel.
	   For only RM19.95++, diners can enjoy as many servings of premium
Haagen- Dazs ice-cream, rich Mrs Fields cookies and delicious
crepes, cakes and other pastries.
	   For an additional RM4.90++, one can have as many cups of Java
Coast gourmet coffee signature blend as one likes.
	   The Java Coast, popular among Westerners, especially Americans,
made its debut in the country at the hotel in February.
	   A fine selection of the coffee is available for patrons.
	   Equatorial general manager Donald Lim said: ``People will
realise what an outstanding value the bistro is offering.''
	   He added that the Etoile dessert buffet will appeal to fans of
Haagen- Dazs ice-cream, Mrs Fields cookies, and Java Coast gourmet
coffee.
	   Lim said customers can not only enjoy these brandname desserts,
but also a whole range of other fantastic desserts prepared by
executive chef Jean- Marc Veron and chef de partie Steven Tham.
	   The dessert buffet is available from 7.15pm to 11pm on weekdays
and until 1am on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays.
	   To avoid disappointment, perhaps it is better to call the bistro
and ask what is available on the menu that evening.
	   Although the outlet can accommodate about 80 persons,
reservations are highly recommended.
	   Etoile Bistro can be reached at 03-2617777 ext 8030.

Canadian activists call off seven-year boycott of Japanese firm
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Figures in U.S. dollars. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Activists called off a seven-year boycott
campaign against a Japanese paper company Friday after the firm
pledged not to log on land claimed by an Indian tribe until the
disputed claim is settled.
	   Friends of the Lubicon, a Toronto-based group, initiated the
boycott against Daishowa Inc. in 1991 in support of the Lubicon
Indians of northern Alberta. The company said the boycott cost it
dlrs 10 million.
	   The case dates to 1988, when Daishowa reached an agreement with
federal and provincial officials to log about 4,000 square miles
(10,400 square kilometers) of land claimed by the Lubicons.
	   The isolated Indian community contended that no logging rights
should be awarded until its dispute with government authorities was
settled.
	   Diashowa never actually began logging on the disputed land. But
until last month it had antagonized the Indians and activists by
refusing to pledge it would never log there until the land-claims
struggle was resolved.
	   On May 20, a Daishowa executive wrote to the Lubicon chief
pledging to hold off on logging until a land settlement was
reached.
	   This week, company sent the Lubicons a map specifying that the
pledge covered all the disputed land. That was enough for Friends
of the Lubicon to announce that the boycott would end.
	   ``This has to be one of the most successful boycotts in Canadian
history,'' said Friends of the Lubicon spokesman Kevin Thomas.
``Now the Lubicons and their supporters can focus their full
attention on the Canadian govenment's failure to settle the ongoing
land rights dispute.''
	   The boycott was aimed at dissuading stores in Canada and
overseas from buying Daishowa's paper bags. More than 40 companies
changed their bag suppliers.
	   Daishowa won an injunction against the boycott in 1996. An
Ontario judge quashed the injunction in April, saying the boycott
was a legitimate form of political expression.

	   THE British High Commission yesterday officially launched the
British- Malaysia Scholarship Scheme 1998.
	   Under the scheme, 1,583 successful Malaysian applicants will
receive a contribution of up to STG2,000 (approximately RM12,000)
towards their tuition fees to enable them to begin or continue
their studies at universities in the UK in the 1998/99 academic
year.
	   This means a total contribution of up to STG3 million (about
RM20 million) towards the education of Malaysian students in the
UK, British High Commissioner David Moss said yesterday.
	   ``With the fall in the value of the ringgit, there has been
growing concern over the financial hardships faced by Malaysian
students studying in the UK.
	   ``The response from the UK has been tremendous - practically all
British universities have already introduced special measures to
help Malaysian students studying in the UK or those who are about
to commence their studies,'' Moss said at the High Commission in
Kuala Lumpur.
	   He explained that the British Government has also been looking
for ways to help.
	   When the Minister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs
Derek Fatchett visited Malaysia in March this year, he announced
the British Government's intention to establish a special
scholarship scheme designed to support Malaysian students and other
students from the region.
	   Moss added that the new scholarships will be in addition to the
70 or so Chevening Scholarships already offered to Malaysian
students by the British High Commission each year.
	   Core funding for the scheme has been made available by the
Foreign and Commonwealth office. Additional funds have also been
contributed by the British Council, who will coordinate the scheme,
the Department of Trade and Industry and many British companies.
	   Matching funds are also being provided by participating British
universities, who will administer the scheme.
	   ``We attach a great deal of importance to Malaysian students
continuing to study in Britain. As the largest body of overseas
students in the UK, the contribution they make to the life of
British universities and indeed British life more generally, is
invaluable.
	   ``We hope this scheme will further enhance the valuable links
and friendship between our two countries and clearly demonstrates
Britain's continued interest in and support for Malaysia.
	   ``As Prime Minister Tony Blair said in his address to the Second
Asia- Europe Meeting in London in April - `We are not fair-weather
friends - but partners for the long term','' Moss said.
	   There are currently some 18,000 Malaysian students in British
schools, technical colleges and universities.

	   THE timber and plywood industry will be forming a national
marketing convention to monitor product prices and to improve
marketing strategies in the international market.
	   Primary Industry Minister Datuk Seri Dr Lim Keng Yaik said the
convention will look into making inroads into markets such as the
US, Europe and West Asia, apart from the traditional East Asian
market.
	   Japan, South Korea, China/Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan are
the main buyers of Malaysian plywood, but demand for the product in
these markets had softened since July last year.
	   Malaysia, he said, exported 200,000 cu m of plywood worth RM17
million to the US last year.
	   ``The parties involved should plan a proper market intelligence
survey with proper strategies to find new markets. They should also
work together in monitoring international prices,'' he told
reporters after a dialogue with Malaysian Panel Products
Manufacturers Association in Kuala Lumpur yesterday.
	   Representatives from The Sabah Timber Industries Association,
Sarawak Timber Association and Malaysian Timber Council also
attended the dialogue.
	   The export of plywood, he said, is expected to drop slightly
this year and total export earnings will be affected due to the
drop in international plywood prices and the weakening of the
ringgit.
	   ``We are forecasting about RM13.2 billion in total earnings from
timber and timber products from the first quarter sales. Last year,
the total earnings for timber and timber products was RM14.72
billion,'' Lim said.
	   Veneer and plywood make up about 34 per cent of total timber and
timber product earnings.
	   In 1996, 4.56 million cu m of veneer and plywood worth RM4.86
billion was exported.
	   Indonesia is the main exporter of plywood commanding 61 per
cent, Malaysia (28 per cent) and Brazil (7 per cent).
	   Lim said he will also seek cooperation from his counterpart in
Indonesia to ensure that international plywood prices are not
lowered due to competition.
	   Prices for 3mm plywood had dropped from US$420 per cu m before
July to the current price of US$240 per cu m. The price drop, he
said, had resulted in losses of up to RM1 million per month in
large sawmills.
	   Many of the plywood mills, he said, are considering relocating
to other countries such as Taiwan and China.
	   ``We have already brought the issue up with the Malaysian trade
commissioner in Indonesia. The meeting between Malaysia and
Indonesia last April had helped to stabilise the plywood prices but
at RM$220 per cu m, it is too low,'' he said.
	   At the dialogue, other issues such as difficulty in securing
credit financing from local banks and high interest rates of 16 per
cent were brought up. The association had requested banks to reduce
the interest rates to 14 per cent.
	   ``The association also said that export credit financing
interest rate at 10.8 per cent from the Export Import Bank is too
high. They assured me that if the interest rate is at 4.5 per cent,
they will be able to increase 30 per cent of the exports,'' he
said.
	   Lim said the Sabah Timber Industries Association, Malaysian
Panel Products Manufacturers' Association and Sarawak Timber
Association will submit a proposal to the Finance Ministry on this
matter.
	   Lim said he had also received reports on unethical practices of
plywood exporters auctioning the consignment overseas and also of
price undercutting.
	   The millers, he said, had also voiced their concern over the
increasing freight charges where a 20-ft container priced at US$950
in December had increased to US$1,100 in April this year.
	   The dialogue also raised the issue of government levy on foreign
workers which had increased from RM840 to RM1,500 per worker.

Thousands flee Guinea-Bissau as government, rebels exchange fire

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Tens of thousands of people fled the
former Portuguese colony of Guinea-Bissau on Friday as government
troops fought renegade soldiers who launched a coup attempt,
according to reports.
	   As many as 40,000 people in the West African nation were heading
on foot along the road to the northern border with Senegal, a
Portuguese journalist in the area said, citing local reports.
	   Senegal closed the border on Thursday while medical teams were
dispatched to vaccinate the refugees against yellow fever and
meningitis before they were allowed into the country, Pedro Rosa
Mendes told Portuguese state radio Antena 1.
	   Government troops, supported by soldiers from neighboring
Senegal and the Republic of Guinea, meanwhile maintained their
siege of a military garrison in a northern suburb of the capital
Bissau, where an unknown number of rebels have been holed up since
their attempted powergrab on Sunday.
	   A spokesman for the Portuguese Prime Minister's office, who was
in contact with the Portuguese embassy in Bissau, said sporadic
shelling and automatic weapon fire could be heard in the capital
throughout the day.
	   ``It's a very unstable situation. We're not sure who's
winning,'' the spokesman said on customary condition of anonymity,
adding that the embassy had been hit by several stray shells.
	   The French embassy was hit by a bazooka shell but no one was
injured, the Portuguese news agency Lusa reported, citing
diplomatic sources in Dakar in Senegal.
	   Portuguese residents in Bafata, the country's second-largest
city, 140 kilometers (87 miles) to the east of Bissau, told Lusa
there was no military activity in the area.
	   The president of the National Assembly Malan Sanha said
representatives from Muslim and Catholic associations had allied
with lawmakers to propose talks, Lusa reported.
	   The two sides had ``demonstrated interest'' in holding talks,
Sanha was quoted as saying by Lusa, although he declined to provide
further details.
	   However, an unidentified western diplomat quoted by Lusa said
President Joao Bernardo Vieira was reluctant to enter talks and was
confident in his ability to defeat the rebels militarily.
	   More than 2,200 people, mostly foreigners, were evacuated from
Bissau on a Portuguese merchant ship Thursday.
	   Vitor Duque, an official of the shipping company that provided
the vessel told, Antena 1 that the passengers, including children
and old people, were packed on the deck. The huge container ship
was designed to hold only 18 people.
	   The ship arrived at Dakar harbor at about 1900 GMT and was
waiting just outside the port before pulling in to dock.
	   A Portuguese frigate was expected to arrive in Guinea-Bissau on
Sunday to oversee the evacuation of other foreigners, diplomats
said.
	   Portuguese phone company Marconi said international phone lines
apparently had been cut in Bissau, making contact impossible.
	   The rebels are led by former armed forces chief Brig. Ansumane
Mane, who was fired in January amid allegations he was involved in
smuggling arms to rebels in Senegal. He has accused Vieira of
corruption and called on him to step down so that early elections
can be held.
	   Vieira himself came to power in a 1980 coup. He was elected in
the country's first democratic elections for president and
parliament four years ago.

	   THE Lenggeng Recreational Forest is among the destinations to be
promoted during Visit Negri Sembilan Year 1999.
	   A Negri Sembilan Forestry Department spokesman said the forest
comprised virgin jungle with wildlife and flora.
	   It also has majestic outcrops of granite.
	   The spokesman said the area has facilities such as wooden
bridges, camping grounds, park benches, wooden huts and pergolas.
	   He said the forest offers rivers with crystal-clear waters, and
cascading waterfalls.
	   He said among the complaints received from the public was the
absence of a hawker centre and public toilet.
	   ``The reason we do not construct a hawker centre here is because
of the littering problem.
	   ``We are also having a problem with water supply which makes it
difficult for us to have public toilets,'' he said.
	   Located near Km8 Jalan Pantai Lenggeng, the forest is only half
an hour's journey from Seremban town.
	   Among the rare attractions at the forest are the rare species of
flowers, insects and wild orchids with unique shapes and sweet
smell.
	   Nature lovers keen on jungle trekking will be impressed by the
extraordinary shapes and sizes of the rocks which border the river.
	   The forest reserve has also become a favourite spot for the
older generation to exercise and appreciate the fresh air.
	   However, for those who wish to visit the place, personal
transport must be arranged as there was no public transport service
there.
	   The Forestry spokesman said if the promotion was to be a
success, efforts must be made to enable easy access via public
transport.
	   He said the department was also planning to build a public
toilet and provide more litter bins.

	   RATING Agency Malaysia (RAM) Bhd has revised the short-term
rating of Kesas Sdn Bhd's RM422.5 million guaranteed revolving
underwritten notes issuance facility (Grunif) 1994/2008 to P2(s)
from P2.
	   The rating reflects Kesas' ultimate shareholders' commitment to
provide funds in the form of equity or loan to enable the company
to maintain a debt service coverage ratio of 1.25 times, throughout
the tenure of the Grunif.
	   The ratio is higher than the minimum 1.05 times required under
the facilities agreement, and the resolution to inject funds by
three of the four shareholders is therefore a critical element in
supporting the rating, RAM said in a statement.
	   Kesas is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Kesas Holdings Bhd, which
in turn is jointly owned by Gamuda Bhd, Percon Corp Sdn Bhd, Arab
Malaysian Development Bhd and Perbadanan Kemajuan Negeri Selangor.
	   However, RAM said it is unable to comment on the possible extent
of credit enhancement since the RM422.5 million Grunif is
unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed by a consortium of
financial institutions which include unrated financial
institutions.

	   SPK-Sentosa Corporation Bhd sank deeper into the red by
recording a group pre-tax loss of RM8.42 million for the year ended
Dec 31, 1997 from a loss of RM1.79 million previously. Turnover at
the group level, however, increased to RM35 million from RM21
million, said the company. At the company level, it incurred a
pre-tax loss of RM9.66 million from a loss of RM2.43 million while
turnover declined to RM8.9 million for the period under review from
RM14.2 million earlier. The lower turnover was due to the
discontinued operations of the plywood factory in the third quarter
of the year as a result of the unfavourable market conditions and
the continuing losses. SPK-Sentosa, however, said prospects for the
current year were favourable.

	   AMID the steady drumbeat of bad news hogging the domestic
economic front in recent months, some companies still managed to
chalk up impressive profits.
	   One of them is Rothmans of Pall Mall (Malaysia) Bhd.
	   With the best foot forward, Rothmans Malaysia seems to be taking
on the challenges with a strong financial backing and aggressive
advertising strategy.
	   Dunhill has also appeared prominently amid the football fervour
as it is the official sponsor of the World Cup, bringing football
matches live to Malaysian televisions every day.
	   For the year just ended on March 31 1998, Rothmans Malaysia
registered a 16.8 per cent rise in group pre-tax profit to RM653.53
million on higher turnover of RM1.96 billion from RM1.76 billion
previously.
	   And if analysts' predictions are anything to go by, Rothmans,
producer of the country's leading cigarette brand Dunhill, will
record another satisfactory growth for the year ending March 31
1999.
	   According to an analyst, Rothmans Malaysia's overall market
share for the industry stands at 55 per cent, out of which Dunhill
makes up 40 per cent.
	   In addition, the analyst said the current economic downturn so
far has not affected the company, as its stocks which mainly
comprise tobacco leaves were bought well in advance last year and
typically last for a year.
	   Nevertheless, the analyst said there may be cause for worry if
the Malaysian economy fails to recover within next year, as
retrenchment is on the rise.
	   A crucial factor is that most smokers come from the middle- and
low- income categories which are badly hit by layoffs, the analyst
said. As their income is affected, their smoking habits would also
change.
	   ``Probably, smokers would change brands of cigarette from
premium to cheaper cigarettes,'' she added.
	   However, she said smoking is very much a psychological issue and
smoking patterns are difficult to study. The chances of smokers
changing their preferred brands can only be speculated.
	   There is also a lingering rumour that the Government may
increase taxes on tobacco and alcohol, she said. If this were to
happen, the tobacco industry would be affected, not just Rothmans
Malaysia alone.
	   However, the analyst expressed her confidence in the company as
the market leader in the industry.
	   ``Rothmans Malaysia has a very good advertising and marketing
strategy with Dunhill, and the industry is expected to grow between
2 and 4 per cent this year. The company will continue to be the
market leader,'' she said.
	   Another analyst said sales growth in terms of volume for the
industry is at 3 per cent. For the next two years, she said, the
industry will be exposed to slower growth but the numbers are not
expected to move into negative territory.
	   She said growth will persist due to the addictive nature of
cigarettes.
	   However, people may smoke less.
	   ``Rothmans for the last few years has gained some market share
but for the next two to three years, sales will decline,'' the
analyst said.
	   She said with the slowdown biting in, there will be a
``downtrend'' where smokers are expected to change to cheaper
brands.
	   However, she also pointed out that Dunhill smokers are mostly
hesitant to change cigarettes. Dunhill smokers will probably smoke
less rather than change brands.
	   The analyst is of the opinion that Rothmans Malaysia is still in
a good position due to economies of scale. Furthermore, the company
has zero borrowings and some RM400 million in net cash.
	   On the anticipated increase in sales tax and duty of imported
raw tobacco leaves, she said this is highly likely.
	   Currently, tobacco companies can only import a maximum of 30 per
cent of its required raw tobacco leaves. Import duty is RM50 for
every kg of imports. Sales tax is 15 per cent.

	   THE Petaling Jaya Municipal Council hopes to carry out an
operation soon to nab some 30,000 stray dogs.
	   Kampung Tunku State Assemblyman Khoo Ooi Seng said the operation
was necessary as there had been several reports of children being
attacked by stray dogs.
	   The operation would concentrate on housing estates, he added.
	   ``So far, we have identified only 30,000 strays in the
municipality, but there may be more,'' he said, adding that if the
dogs were not adopted by the public, the council would have to put
them to sleep.
	   Khoo said the council also intends to take cobblers off
five-foot ways and relocate them to dead ends.
	   He said the council wanted to centralise small businessess such
as cobblers and lottery ticket sellers at dead end roads so that
they would not block pedestrian traffic on the walkways.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) - In a rare public display of high-level U.S.
disagreement, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has chastised
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin for failing to inform her of a
money-laundering sting operation that led to 150 arrests, including
many Mexican bankers.
	   ``I would appreciate being kept personally informed of
developing investigations in Mexico and other foreign countries
that could have a significant foreign policy fallout,'' Albright
said in a letter to Rubin, dated May 22.
	   ``I do not wish to interfere with your law enforcement work, but
I do believe we need to do a better job of coordination.''
	   The letter was inserted in the Congressional Record by Sen.
Charles Grassley, R-Iowa. It was not disclosed how Grassley
obtained the letter.
	   Albright wrote the letter following an uproar in Mexico touched
off by the disclosure that U.S. Customs agents working under
Rubin's jurisdiction had carried out part of the sting operation on
Mexican soil without Mexican authorization.
	   The bankers were arrested after being lured into the United
States under false pretenses. In addition, dlrs 10 million was
seized and three Mexican banks were indicted in the United States.
	   Mexico has indicated that laws were broken by the agents and
that it plans to prosecute them.
	   Albright expressed concern ``about the negative tone this
development introduces into the relationship and that Mexican
cooperation on several fronts, particularly counternarcotics, may
be affected.''
	   Efforts to obtain comment from the Treasury Department on the
letter were unsuccessful.
	   President Clinton also has expressed regret to Mexican President
Ernesto Zedillo about the secrecy of the operation, which was
carried out over three years and was made public last month.
Keeping Mexico uninformed about the operation was deemed necessary
to protect the agents.

	   MALAYSIA Airlines is drawing up special travel packages for
those in Sabah and Sarawak to attract them to the upcoming 16th
Commonwealth Games in September.
	   Its chairman, Tan Sri Tajudin Ramli, said various types of
travel packages are being designed, which should see a maximum
discount of 55 per cent on air fares on its routes between Kuala
Lumpur and Sabah and Sarawak.
	   ``But some conditions will apply ... for example, passengers
must travel in a group,'' he told reporters in Petaling Jaya
yesterday after the launch of the ``Let the Games Begin'' album by
Youth and Sports Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin.
	   Tajudin said the travel packages are in response to an earlier
request from Sukom Ninety Eight Bhd to review the carrier's high
air fares on routes between Kuala Lumpur and Sabah and Sarawak.
	   ``We have already started to notify our stations and offices
throughout the world with regard to these travel packages.
``However, we have yet to decide on the number of additional
flights to put into service during the Games because that will
depend on the response from people staying in Sabah and Sarawak,''
he said.
	   He expects the number of additional flights to be determined
next month.
	   On Malaysia Airlines' allocation for the promotions of the
Games, Tajudin said: ``We have a big budget for that.'' He,
however, declined to disclose the amount, saying that the air fares
for athletes from the participating countries alone amounted to
some RM15 million.
	   ``We feel that contributing to the Games is a worthwhile
investment because as the country becomes more well-known
internationally, more people will come to Malaysia.
	   ``Malaysia Airlines will benefit from it,'' he added.
	   Tajudin said many first-time travellers on Malaysia Airlines
have written to the airline saying that ``they had a good
experience and I think that sells the country.'' Sukom Ninety Eight
executive chairman Gen (R) Tan Sri Hashim Mohd Ali said it is still
short of 9 per cent of the overall budget needed to organise the
Games in September. It has estimated a total budget of RM310
million.
	   He also said it is likely that for the first time in the history
of the Games, all 69 countries of the Commonwealth will participate
in this year's event.
	   ``So far, all of the 69 countries of the Commonwealth have
decided to send teams, except Tuvalu, which is experiencing some
financial difficulties,'' he said.
	   However, Hashim said, the Pacific nation may reconsider its
earlier decision after Malaysia's offer of free three air tickets
and accommodation during the Games.
	   On the safety aspects during the Games, Hashim said a committee
chaired by Inspector-General of Police Tan Sri Rahim Noor has been
set up to look into this matter.
	   ``Sukom Ninety Eight and the Police have agreed to send three
police officers to Paris to study the country's safety measures
implemented during the current World Cup event.
	   ``In fact, some officers have already gone to Atlanta, Hiroshima
and Chiengmai. I am confident that all matters pertaining to safety
during the Games will be satisfactory,'' he said.
	   Muhyiddin said the Government has been making the necessary
arrangements to ensure that the public transport facilities are
sufficient during the Games.
	   ``Also, the Transport Committee, the Traffic and Safety
Committee, Sukom Ninety Eight and Kuala Lumpur City Council will be
coming out with a guidebook on the public transport systems.
	   ``Information on how to get to the games venues, the number of
buses available and their schedule will be included in the
guidebook,'' he said.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Thurs. - Ninety-seven per cent of chicken in the
market is free from the cancer-inducing antibiotic, nitrofuran,
once widely used by poultry farmers to promote growth of the bird.
	   Health Minister Datuk Chua Jui Meng said a recent nationwide
sampling of chicken and eggs showed less than four per cent (five
cases) contained residues of the antibiotic.
	   Nitrofuran was banned following a Cabinet decision on Aug 21,
1996, after it was found that long-term consumption of it causes
cancer of the lungs, breast and skin.
	   ``We are committed to fight the use of nitrofuran and hope we
find no residue of the antibiotic in our ongoing tests of chicken
by end of the year.''
	   He said out of the five nitrofuran violation cases, one chicken
seller was fined RM4,000 by the Teluk Intan magistrate's court on
May 26.
	   Four others - one in Perak and three in Kedah - are awaiting
prosecution.
	   Chua was speaking to reporters after opening the second day of
the third Health Ministry annual dialogue with non-governmental
organisations today.
	   The Food Act 1983 provides for a maximum penalty of five years'
jail or fine, or both, for those convicted of nitrofuran
violations.
	   He urged chicken sellers with information about poultry
suppliers and breeders using nitrofuran to co-operate with the
ministry and the Department of Veterinary Services in the interest
of the public.
	   Earlier in his speech, Chua said the ministry welcomed the
participation of NGOs in its public health programmes.
	   He said the involvement of NGOs was important as they, being a
less formal organisation, were an effective link between the
Government and the public.
	   He said NGOs participation in the ministry's community health
projects and other rehabilitation programmes would be useful as the
ministry needs complementary efforts to ensure its programmes are
successful.
	   Twenty-five NGOs presented their memorandums at today's session
including representatives of the Malaysian Council for Child
Welfare, All Women Action Society, National Stroke Association,
Cancerlink Foundation and the Society for the Deaf in Selangor and
Federal Territory.

	   IPOH, Thurs. - The State Government should gazette land for
vegetable cultivation and cattle rearing to ensure adequate supply
of food.
	   People's Progressive Party national vice-chairman A. Ayyathurai
said some farmers and breeders were facing uncertainties because
they were using land which they only had temporary occupation
licences.
	   ``They are not willing to invest heavily on their farms as they
fear the Government might take back the land for development,'' he
added.
	   He expressed fear that food supply in the State would be
adversely affected if more such land was developed.

	   DOMESTIC Trade and Consumer Affairs Minister Datuk Seri Megat
Junid Megat Ayob is leaving it to rice wholesalers, retailers and
millers to decide on a suitable recommended retail price (RRP) for
home-grown rice.
	   ``The wholesalers, retailers and millers have given their word
that they will reduce the current price for local rice so that it
is equivalent to the price of rice sold by Padiberas Nasional Bhd
(Bernas) or at least lower than what is being sold now.
	   ``Let them sit down and discuss it,'' he told reporters in Kuala
Lumpur yesterday after chairing a three-hour meeting with 60 rice
millers, wholesalers and retailers including Bernas.
	   The meeting was held to find a solution to the spiralling
increase in the price of rice in recent weeks. The Federation of
Malaysian Consumer Associations (Fomca) had alleged that Bernas was
the cause of the price increase.
	   However, Bernas claims that it is a result of profiteering by
wholesalers and retailers.
	   Since May, prices of local rice had gone up by 21 per cent while
that of imported varieties are now 52 per cent more expensive.
	   Megat Junid said the wholesalers, retailers and millers have not
been given a timeframe to come up with a RRP list but he hopes it
will be ``as soon as possible''.
	   ``Datuk Mohd Nor Rahim (the ministry's secretary-general) will
jointly monitor the progress with the Agriculture Ministry,'' he
said.
	   The minister, however, declined to give the RRP proposed by the
ministry to the wholesalers and retailers.
	   ``Even if the millers sell the rice to the wholesalers and
retailers at RM1.50 per kg, they (the wholesalers and retailers)
should sell the rice to consumers at about RM1.70 per kg,'' he
said.
	   Megat Junid said the wholesalers and retailers had claimed
during the meeting that they had to sell their rice at a higher
price due to the rising costs of transportation, packaging and
cleaning of the rice.
	   He advised consumers to go to Bernas outlets such as B-Marts if
they are looking for rice at cheaper prices and ``we hope Bernas
has enough supply (to meet the demand)'', he added.
	   Asked if the ministry will act on errant wholesalers and
retailers who sell rice at a higher price despite sourcing it
cheaply from farmers, Megat Junid said that the Agriculture
Ministry's Padi and Rice Price Control and Monitoring Division will
look into ways to overcome the problem.
	   Effective September 1, however, the Division will be placed
under the Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry.
	   Megat Junid also said the wholesalers, retailers, millers and
Bernas have promised to meet regularly to ensure that the price of
rice remains stable.

	   KUANTAN, Thurs. - The State Government plans to make use of
ex-mining pools and idle padi fields for fish breeding in its
effort to boost food production.
	   Menteri Besar Tan Sri Mohd Khalil Yaakob said today the State
Government had identified numerous sites with a total area of
4,000ha for this purpose.
	   ``Once implemented, these projects are capable of supplying
36,087 tonnes of fish annually,'' he said.
	   He said 70 former mining sites would be used. Of the number, 22
are located here, 20 in Raub, 17 in Lipis, 10 in Bera and one in
Maran.
	   ``The State Government will aggressively promote aquaculture,''
he told reporters after launching a nasi padang promotion at Hotel

	   Also present were his deputy Datuk Hasan Arifin, State executive
councillors and State Secretary Datuk Abdul Ghani Sulaiman and

	   LAS MARGARITAS, Mexico (AP) _ With fears of renewed war between
Zapatista rebels and the government, Mexico's president flew to
Chiapas on Friday to defend his administration's stated desire for
dialogue and pledge money for towns where rebel support runs high.
	   Some analysts say a police and army raid on an Indian village
this week is the latest indication that the government has chosen
military might over the negotiating table.
	   But President Ernesto Zedillo told residents in Las Margaritas,
85 miles (135 kilometers) southeast of the state capital, Tuxtla
Gutierrez, that the government's goal is negotiation.
	   ``We want dialogue. We don't want to defeat anyone. The
government will not abandon this position,'' he said. Zedillo was
making his fourth visit to Chiapas in just over a month .
	   As he spoke, about a dozen people unfurled banners demanding a
halt to violence. ``Senor Zedillo, we do not want more war,'' one
said.
	   Guadalupe Gonzalez, 33, who held up a sign reading ``Senor
Zedillo, we want respect for our human rights,'' said she is not
sure the government still wants to negotiate.
	   On Wednesday, government forces clashed with apparent Zapatista
rebels in the municipality of El Bosque as they tried to evict a
town council that supported the Zapatistas, who took up arms in
1994 to demand greater democracy and Indian rights. The pro-rebel
council had been operating in parallel with the official town
council.
	   The clash, which killed nine people, was the first direct
skirmish between the government and the Zapatistas since peace
talks broke down nearly two years ago.
	   Some analysts said the government's tactics signaled that
officials have given up the idea of restarting talks and are
focusing instead on isolating the rebels from their civilian
supporters.
	   ``They have decided not to continue with negotiations, but they
can't say that because public opinion is in favor of resolving the
Chiapas problem through negotiations,'' said Lorenzo Meyer, a
political historian in Mexico City.
	   Meyer said the government over recent months has been
eliminating barriers to its plan _ expelling foreign human rights
observers from Chiapas, forcing the collapse of independent groups
mediating the peace talks and strengthening ruling party support
groups in Chiapas, including paramiltary groups.
	   In a speech Friday, Chiapas Gov. Roberto Albores Guillen took a
harder line than Zedillo, vowing to continue using force to achieve
what he called the rule of law.
	   ``The return to legality is not negotiable in Chiapas. We are
going to make the law prevail in Chiapas,'' he said.
	   Zedillo's trip to Chiapas had been planned in advance and did
not include stops near this week's clashes. All of his stops were
in towns dominated by supporters of his Institutional Revolutionary
Party.
	   In Las Margaritas, a lowland town where many government
supporters have fled after being driven from their villages by
Zapatista supporters, the president signed an accord for
``political stability, community reconciliation, social development
and economic growth.''
	   The accord is designed to provide special aid to 42
municipalities ``that need special attention,'' he said. The list
included all the pro-rebel towns the government has raided in
recent months _ including El Bosque, the site of Wednesday's raid.
	   The 42 municipalities will receive dlrs 290 million this year
for schools, health clinics, water purification plants and roads.
	   Zedillo said the towns were chosen for their extreme poverty,
lack of jobs and other problems.
	   But the accord was reminiscent of old-style Mexican politics, in
which the government threw money at ruling party supporters in
trouble spots in an attempt to buy off opposition supporters.

	   COURTING TROUBLE ... Riding hand-in-hand and at breakneck speed,
these Evel Knievel wannabes throw caution to the wind as they rush
down a main road in Kampung Pelubang in Kubang Pasu district.
Without helmets and only in slippers, these youths braved oncoming
traffic for the thrill of a dangerous stunt.
	   Following them, a group of younger children on bicycles cheered
them, paying scant attention to the sharp bend just a few metres
down the road.
	   New Straits Times photographer Jamah Nasri caught these
daredevils in action on the main road that links Kampung Pelubang
to the Alor Star-Jitra trunk road. The youths rode in this
dangerous manner for 10 minutes.

	   KOTA BARU, Thurs. - Menteri Besar Datuk Nik Abdul Aziz Nik Mat
has urged agricultural agencies to build close krapport with
farmers to facilitate development in the sector.
	   He said technical support, counselling and new farming methods
could be put into effect if the officers had good ties with
farmers.
	   This would also enable farmers to receive firsthand know-how
from the officers and improve yields.
	   ``The farmers should also be willing to listen to the officers.
	   ``They have to shed the belief that their farming activities are
only for self-sufficiency as this will not help increase food
production,'' he said during his visit to the Kampung Nilam Baru
vegetable farm.
	   Also present was Kemubu Agricultural Development Authority
chairman Tan Sri Hussein Ahmad.
	   Nik Aziz said Kelantan, with its large tracts of land, should be
able to be self-sufficient in vegetables and fruits.
	   However, he said, the State had to import fruits and vegetables
from Thailand. About 36,000 tonnes of fruits and vegetables worth
RM65 million were brought into the State from Thailand every year.
	   ``Between 20 and 30 per cent of this amount is sold in Kelantan
while the rest goes to other States.''
	   Nik Aziz also spoke of the reluctance of many to undertake
farming actively as they had doubts that this could be lucrative.

	   APEX Equity Holdings Bhd said it is financially sound with about
RM90 million in cash reserves invested in fixed deposits and the
money market despite the slowdown in stockmarket.
	   Apex's executive chairman Chan Guan Seng told reporters after
the company's annual and extraordinary general meeting in Kajang
yesterday that Apex is fortunate because it has zero gearing.
	   The main activities of Apex's subsidiaries are acting as stock
and share brokers and dealers in securities, acting as futures
brokers, property holding, provision of portfolio management and
investment advisory services, provision of nominee services, unit
trust management, investment holding and money lending.
	   According to Chan, its core business of stockbroking which
contributes between 75 per cent and 80 per cent of its total
business will continue to contribute the bulk of its business.
	   Chan said that in the first three months of 1998, its
stockbroking business did fairly well.
	   On the performance of the stockmarket, Chan said that if it (the
KLSE Composite Index) deteriorates to the 480 level, investors
should look at the value of shares.
	   ``There are shares in the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE)
that are giving good value,'' Chan said.
	   On other developments, Chan said Apex expects its futures
broking business to break even by next year which has already churn
out positive results this year.

	   SIBU, Thurs. - The Sibu Journalists' Association and the
Institute of Rejang Journalists yesterday registered their protest
over a move by the Sibu Municipal Council to ban reporters from its
monthly full-council meetings.
	   ``We think the unprecedented step taken by the council has
infringed on Press freedom and denied the right of the public to
know what actually transpires at their meetings,'' they said in a
joint statement.
	   They said they could not agree with the council's suggestion
that reporters be briefed on the outcome of meetings the following
day by council chairman Kong Sien Han.
	   ``Such briefings may result in only sanitised reports, not
giving ratepayers an insight into the council's deficiencies.
	   ``Absence from the meeting also places reporters at a great
disadvantage because they would be unable to fully grasp issues
voiced out and will therefore be unable to ask relevant
questions,'' they said.
	   They said the ruling would prevent reporters from focusing on
matters they thought fit.
	   ``Moreover, reporters should not be made a tool of the
council,'' the statement added.
	   They also expressed regret at a statement by the council which
questioned the proficiency of reporters.
	   ``Over the years, the council has never asked reporters to
rectify any report on its full council meetings. We think there is
no ground for SMC to accuse reporters of filing inaccurate
reports.''
	   The council banned the Press from covering its meeting on June
5, citing inaccuracies in write-ups.

	   RATING Agency Malaysia (RAM) has downgraded the long-term rating
for HICOM Holdings Bhd's RM950 million redeemable secured bonds
(1996/2001) from A2(s) to BBB2.
	   In a statement, RAM said it has also downgraded the short-term
rating for HICOM's RM500 million Murabahah notes issuance facility
(1997/2002) from P2 to P3.
	   According to RAM, the rating downgrades reflect the negative
outlook for the automotive industry in the wake of the economic
slowdown and the depreciation of the ringgit.
	   The agency added that the downward pressure on future earnings
of HICOM's car-related subsidiaries and associate companies will
temper their ability to maintain dividend payments to HICOM.
	   RAM said this will in turn weaken HICOM's debt servicing ability
since its cash flow is mainly derived from dividend income from
subsidiaries and associates.
	   Furthermore, RAM said HICOM relies heavily on dividend and
investment income to service its debt and for investment.
	   However, RAM continues to see strong government support for
HICOM in view of its strategic importance as the vehicle for
developing Malaysia's automotive and heavy industries.
	   In addition, RAM said HICOM's holding of listed shares with a
market value of RM972 million as at June 5 this year will provide
it with some financial flexibility to refinance its debts upon
maturity of the bonds.

	   EDARAN Otomobil Nasional Bhd is looking at ways to assist its
vendors survive the economic slowdown, chairman Tan Sri Mohd Saleh
Sulong said yesterday.
	   ``We have already worked out some ways to ensure our vendors can
still keep their operations going but there may be other options we
have not looked at yet,'' he said after EON's annual meeting in
Shah Alam, Selangor.
	   One of the key strategies implemented so far has been to
repackage the Proton cars marketed by the company - which has seen
at least one model now having an enviable backlog of orders.
	   ``Demand for the Iswara 1.3 Aeroback model has been so good we
now have a temporary backlog of about 6,000 cars that need to be
delivered. This is now being looked into, but the delivery
schedules for other models are okay.''
	   Mohd Saleh said EON has already reached its limit of how it can
repackage accessories for Proton cars, but ``happily enough many
customers still opt for many accessories when making their
purchases''.
	   ``It came as a surprise to us just how big a demand there is for
accessories,'' he said, adding that it is a development which has
been very helpful in its effort to assist vendors.
	   ``The only real way we can help our vendors is by making sure
car sales remain steady, and our repackaging efforts to bring down
the cost of a car has proven to be quite successful in this
regard.''
	   ``If we cut back on our support of vendors now, it will be
difficult to rebuild the network later when demand for cars pick
up.''
	   Still, Mohd Saleh cautioned that expectations for total car
sales was as projected at the start of this year - a 60 per cent
reduction from over 210,000 units sold annually in the 1996/97
period.
	   This, in turn, is expected to see lower results for EON in the
current year ending Dec 31, 1998 - with contributions from
non-motor business projected to be almost equal to its earnings
mainstay.

	   THE Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry has marked the
start of its nationwide crackdown on illegal software usage by
raiding an engineering company in Kuala Lumpur and seizing illegal
software valued at RM155,000.
	   The company had infringed copyright ofAutodesk's AutoCAD Rel.
12, Symantec's Norton Utilities 8.0 and Microsoft Windows 3.11
programmes.
	   The ministry's enforcement division's investigation and
prosecution unit head Encik Mohd Roslan Mahayudin said the
nationwide crackdown on illegal software usage follows the
ministry's 30-day awareness campaign on illegal software.
	   The June 9 raid was a a concerted effort by the division and the
Business Software Alliance (BSA), a non-profit software developers'
association which acts as an industry watchdog against piracy.
	   ``The 30-day grace period given during the campaign should have
been used by companies to legalise their software usage,'' he said,
adding that companies that continue to use illegal software for
their operations after the period will be penalised.
	   Those found guilty can be fined up to RM10,000 for each illegal
copy of software seized or five years' jail.
	   The awareness campaign, launched by Domestic Trade and Consumer
Affairs Minister Datuk Seri Megat Junid Megat Ayob on April 9,
ended on May 9.
	   BSA's vice-president Lee Tse Mei said there is now a greater
realisation among senior managers in the corporate sector against
illegal software usage.
	   Lee said companies located outside of the city should not think
that they are safe from any raids as there are 34 enforcement
branches throughout Malaysia.
	   Some 30 cases of illegal software usage are still under
investigation.
	   Even though, BSA and the division have given a 30-day grace
period for software legalisation, the Copyright Act 1987 outlawing
illegal usage of pirated software has been in effect for over 10
years.
	   In addition, BSA will be call on companies to check if they are
using original software.

	   TAIPING, Thurs. - Parents were today chided for not paying
adequate attention to their schoolgoing children, thus giving rise
to social problems involving youths.
	   National Unity and Social Development Minister Datin Paduka
Zaleha Ismail said various studies commissioned by the Ministry,
including those by the National Schoolchildren Welfare Council,
concluded that insufficient parental guidance gave rise to much
problems associated with youths today.
	   Zaleha said one of the studies was on Lifestyle of Youths Living
in High Rise Flats involving 180 families - of which an equal
number were drawn from the three major races.
	   ``Results of surveys showed that 10 per cent of them were not at
home between 7pm and 11pm. A significant percentage were still not
home at 2am.
	   ``It also showed that when parents monitored the activities and
whereabouts of their offsprings, they were less susceptible to
negative influences.
	   ``Similarly when parents play a meaningful role as members of
Parents Teachers Association and Rukun Tetangga, their children
(and those of their neighbours) were less likely to be involved in
social problems,'' she said.
	   Zaleha was speaking after witnessing and jointly signing a
Memorandum of Understanding in which the Kampung Dew Barat Rukun
Tetangga here adopted the nearby Sekolah Menengah Simpang.
	   According to the Minister, other studies showed many parents
still ignored letters from schools and that out of some 2,000
students per school, between 50 and 60 would be involved in social
problems.
	   Zaleha also disclosed feedback from a school PTA about a Form
Three student being tested positive for HIV, apparently contracted
from activities at a hotel where the student worked part-time.
	   Another case ended with counselling help for students who had
been extorting money from a fellow student, forcing the latter to
play truant.
	   ``These cases indicate how important and significant the roles
of parents, RT, PTA and other bodies are in safeguarding students'
welfare,''
	   she added.
	   At today's signing, the Kampung Dew Barat RT sector was
represented by its chairman C. Sarmugam while the school was
represented by its head Rosli Pin.
	   Perak Education Department deputy director Ahmad Shafie and
State Unity Department director Rohani Hussian Merican was also
present.
	   The MOU signing and adoption is the first of its kind in the
country where the participating RT also outlined monthly programmes
and activities for students at the school.
	   Among these were gotong royong to build study shelters and
hydrophonic farming at the school, student services project at RT
centre, tuition and counselling classes, recreational and
motivational courses as well as assistance to needy students.
	   Earlier, Zaleha also contributed books to 50 students and a
bicycle each to 10 students of the school.
	   She also presented cheques for RM4,000 - which were equally
contributed by the local Changkat Jering and Sepetang Assemblymen
Mat Isa Ismail and Siew Kok Kan respectively - to the school.

	   THE birth of Rothmans of Pall Mall (Malaysia) Bhd can be traced
as far back as 1962 when it first began operations in Singapore.
	   In fact, the company was the first Rothmans venture in Asia and
became the first overseas tobacco company to offer 50 per cent of
its holding to the Malaysian public.
	   Its operations started at a pilot plant in Singapore in May
1962. It then began activities in November of the same year in
Petaling Jaya.
	   On December 31 1981, a scheme was undertaken to separate
Rothmans' Malaysia and Singapore operations.
	   Rothmans sold its wholly-owned subsidiary, Rothmans of Pall Mall
(S'pore) Pte Ltd, to Rothmans Industries Ltd, also of Singapore.
	   On October 31 1985, Rothmans Malaysia announced proposals for a
restructuring of its equity in line with the National Economic
Plan.
	   The scheme increased the Bumiputera shareholding in the company
from 4 per cent to 30 per cent without departing from the equity
partnership, whereby the company was owned 50 per cent by the
parent company - Rothmans International Plc - and the rest by local
investors.
	   On January 15 1987, the existing shares in the company were
removed from the official list of the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange
and 61.97 million new shares arising from the restructuring were
listed.
	   In line with the scheme, 80.8 million new shares subscribed by
Rothmans International and approved Bumiputera investors were
listed on the same day.
	   On January 1 1988, Rothmans Malaysia put into effect a
re-organisation of its business whereby it transferred its tobacco
manufacturing and marketing operations to subsidiaries Tobacco
Importers and Manufacturers Sdn Bhd and Cigarette Importers and
Distributors Sdn Bhd, respectively.
	   Cigarette Importers and Distributors is now known as Commercial
Importers and Distributors Sdn Bhd.
	   The re-organisation transformed the company into an investment
holding concern. Rothmans Malaysia's main activities include
manufacturing, importation, distribution and sale of cigarettes and
other tobacco products.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Thurs. - The parents of four-month-old Vinoshan
Narayanan are appealing to the public to help them raise RM28,800
for a hole-in-the- heart operation for their only child.
	   Narayanan Pali, 44, of Kampung Pasir Baru, Jalan Kelang Lama, is
a bus driver, earning RM1,200 a month. His wife Sarojini Kanan, 43,
is a housewife.
	   ``My son was born on Feb 6 this year, and I found out about his
heart condition about a month later,'' he said.
	   ``Since then, I have been taking Vinoshan for monthly check ups.
I have used up all my savings on hospital bills.''
	   Vinoshan has been diagnosed as suffering from a
hole-in-the-heart, resulting in congestive heart failure.
	   Narayanan said Vinoshan only drank about three fluid ounces of
milk daily, although four-month-old babies are supposed to drink
between four and six ounces of milk daily.
	   ``He also has difficulty breathing whenever he is fed,'' said
Sarojini. ``I worry because he is underweight; he only weighs
3.7kg.''
	   Vinoshan's operation costing RM28,800 is scheduled to take place
at the Gleneagles Intan Medical Centre as soon as sufficient funds
are collected.
	   He is scheduled to undergo cardiac catheterization and a
surgical closure of the hole-in-the-heart as soon as possible.
	   Those who wish to make donations should make cheques payable to
the New Straits Times and send them to the Cashier's Department,
New Straits Times Press (M) Bhd, 31 Jalan Riong, 59100 Kuala
Lumpur.
	   Donors should also write Vinoshan's name on the reverse side of
the cheque. If a receipt is required, donors should include their
name and address.

	   MAJOR ocean and intermodal shipping lines operating in the trade
lane from Asia to Canada will implement a second 1998 rate
adjustment in that market in order to help offset depressed rate
levels, address severe cargo and equipment imbalances and ensure
stable service.
	   A statement released yesterday in Kuala Lumpur said effective
July 1, rates for all cargo moving on the vessels of carriers in
the Canada Transpacific Stabilisation Agreement (CTSA) will be
increased by US$200 (US$1  &QC;  RM4.00) per 40ft container (FEU).
	   Proportionate increases will be implemented at the same time for
other equipment sizes and cargo otherwise rated.
	   CTSA noted that market conditions in the Asia-Canada trade have
changed dramatically since CTSA lines adopted and announced an
earlier increase in November 1997, to take effect last April.
	   In recent months, the surge in container traffic from Asia
through Canadian ports and the falloff in westbound shipments to
Asia have increased operational problems and costs relating to port
congestion, routing of cargo and balancing equipment.
	   CTSA is a discussion and policy setting group of 12 ocean and
intermodal carriers serving the trade from ports and inland points
in Asia and the Indian Subcontinent to destinations throughout
Canada.
	   Its members include American President Lines Ltd, Evergreen
Marine Corp (Taiwan) Ltd, Hanjin Shipping Co Ltd, Hapag-Lloyd
Container Line GmbH, Hyundai Merchant Marine Co Ltd, Kawasaki Kisen
Kaisha Ltd (K Line), Mitsui OSK Lines Ltd and A.P. Moller-Maersk
Line.
	   Others are P&AMP;O Nedlloyd Ltd, Nippon Yusen Kaisha (NYK Line),
Orient Overseas Container Lines Inc and Sea-Land Service Inc.

 &UR; Yassin: Israel will not stop my return to Gaza &QL; 
 &UR; By JACK KATZENELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Sheik Ahmed Yassin, the spiritual leader of the
militant Palestinian Islamic group Hamas, said Friday he will
return next week to Gaza whether Israel agrees or not.
	   The 61-year-old quadriplegic, whose followers have killed scores
of Israeli civilians in suicide bomb attacks, was allowed to leave
the Gaza Strip for the purpose of receiving medical treatment, but
seized the opportunity to conduct a 3-month fund-raising trip in
the Arab world, reportedly raising over dlrs 20m.
	   Fears have been expressed in Israel that the money will be used
to finance a new wave of attacks. The Israeli army's outgoing chief
of military intelligence, Moshe Yaalon, said Friday Israel's
problem lay in deciding whether Yassin was more dangerous inside
the Gaza Strip or abroad.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told Israeli television
Channel 1 Friday that he would decide in the next day or two
whether to allow Yassin to return or not.
	   Yassin is currently in the Sudanese capital Khartoum, because
the Egyptian government has not yet permitted him to fly to Cairo.
In a satellite interview with Channel 1, Yassin said he would
return to Gaza next week, ``God willing.''
	   ``I left Gaza by the front door. ... I left with official and
legal permission and therefore neither Israel nor any other entity
can prevent me from returning to my home and my family,'' he said
in a second interview with Israeli Channel 2 television.
	   He stressed that he would continue to fight Israel whether he is
at home or abroad. Hamas is opposed to peace with Israel and sees
the whole of Israel as occupied Palestinian land. ``I am fighting
the occupation and it is my right to fight it,'' he said.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has said repeatedly he is doing
all he can to prevent attacks by Hamas and other militant groups
against Israel, but he insists that under the Oslo agreements
Israel has no right to prevent Yassin's return.
	   ``This would be a violation of what has been agreed and what has
been signed,'' he told reporters earlier this week.
	   Yassin planned to camp out at Egypt's border with the Gaza Strip
if Israel refuses to allow his return, the London-based Al-Hayat
newspaper reported Friday.
	   He would stay there until Israel's policy had been exposed to
the world, the paper quoted a Hamas official as saying.
	   Yassin would then leave Egypt for another Arab Muslim country.
	   Egyptian officials could not immediately be reached for comment.
	   Yassin was freed from an Israeli jail last fall in exchange for
the freedom of two Israeli Mossad agents captured in Jordan during
a bungled assassination attempt against another Hamas leader.

	   SHARES fell 1.2 per cent yesterday amid concerns over rising
local interbank interest rates in the wake of renewed regional
currency weakness, dealers said.
	   The key Hang Seng index fell 93.30 points to close at 7,886.07 -
its third consecutive loss - after plunging 4.9 per cent on
Wednesday to a more than three-year low.
	   The value of turnover amounted to HK$6.751 billion, against the
previous day's HK$7.154 billion.
	   The market opened weakly on heavy selling by institutions and
retail investors with the key barometer falling 1.1 per cent by the
end of the morning session.
	   Dealers said the weakness of the yen was pushing up interbank
offered rates, drying up liquidity.

	   SHARE prices surged in afternoon trade yesterday, fuelled by
bargain hunting amid rumours that the Government would soon reveal
off-budget economic stimulus measures.
	   The Straits Times Industrials index rose 19.02 points or 1.8 per
cent higher to end at 1,086.83. The broader All-Singapore index
slid 1.57 points to close at 305.98.
	   Trading in the morning was largely rangebound, with the further
weakening of regional currencies placing pressure on the stock
market.
	   Turnover rose to 153.777 million shares worth S$282.286 million
from 117.88 million shares valued at S$210.44 million on Wednesday.
Falling shares led those rising, 173 to 106, with 311 issues
unchanged.
	   Heavily traded share was Singapore Telecoms Ltd with 8.5 million
shares traded before falling eight cents to S$2.22. Top gainer was
Singapore Press Holdings Ltd rising S$1.10 to S$12.60 and top loser
was Creative Technology Ltd down S$1.00 to S$26.90.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with possible exercise date, fresh details, new Cohen
quote. &QL; 
 &UR; With NATO-Albania
 &UR; By JEFFREY ULBRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - Russia and the NATO allies agreed
Friday that the explosive situation in Kosovo represents a grave
danger to its neighbors, but differed on how to deal with defiant
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen, who had a private meeting
with Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev and another as part of
the NATO-Russia Permanent Joint Council, stressed the urgency of
finding a solution to hostilities in the southern Yugoslavian
province.
	   ``We are looking at a very short time frame ... to solve this
peacefully,'' he told a news conference at the end of a two-day
North Atlantic Treaty Organization defense ministers' meeting.
	   On Thursday, NATO decided to demonstrate allied air power over
neighboring Albania and Macedonia in hopes of impressing Milosevic
and making him rethink his policy of escalating violence in Kosovo.
	   That demonstration, codenamed Determined Falcon, will probably
occur early next week, perhaps as soon as Sunday, and will involve
simulated air attacks and bombing raids.
	   One NATO official said the demonstration would involve a large
number of allies and types of aircraft.
	   The ministers also ordered military planners to study options
for further action ranging from accelerated planning for military
exercises in the region to direct air strikes inside Yugoslavia and
use of air-mobile ground troops.
	   Cohen said there was a great ``sense of urgency among NATO
members'' that something must be done quickly to stop Milosevic's
attacks on ethnic Albanians, who make up 90 percent of Kosovo's
population.
	   The rebel Kosovo Liberation Army is seeking independence, an
aspiration NATO does not support.
	   ``NATO, all the ministers, and Russia have a unanimous attitude
toward the events in Kosovo,'' said Sergeyev. ``Our differences are
in assessment, approach and methods.''
	   He said Russia ``is convinced we haven't exhausted all
non-military means ... to resolve this crisis.'' If ``other
methods'' must be adopted, he said, they ``should be the
prerogative of the U.N. Security Council.''
	   Cohen said Russia risked isolation if it blocked international
efforts.
	   ``Russia obviously would have to take into account its own
perception of events in Kosovo, and also take into account that it
might be isolated in the world community if it does not seek a way
to bring whatever leverage it can to bring Milosevic to the
table,'' Cohen said.
	   Macedonia has not yet given its authorization for the planned
military exercises over its territory, but Albania is delighted
with the decision to show force.
	   ``We are very pleased about the decision taken by the NATO
Council yesterday,'' Albanian Defense Minister Luan Hajdaraga said
in an interview.
	   ``The stand of Milosevic in the Kosovo crisis is very clear, it
is to dominate the situation by military means.'' The danger is, he
said, that ``those means can spread to Albania.''
	   Gen. Henry Shelton, chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff,
couldn't give details of exactly what form the exercises would
take, saying they were still being developed by NATO planners. Nor
could he say what might trigger a direct military intervention in
Kosovo.
	   The NATO-Russia Permanent Joint Council was formed a year ago as
part of the effort to ease Russia's fears about NATO enlargement.
It has become a forum for consultation on security issues as well
as planning future cooperation.
	   A joint statement at the end of the meeting said the ministers
discussed Kosovo and ``condemned Belgrade's massive and
disproportionate use of force as well as violent attacks by Kosovar
Albanian extremists.''
	   NATO must walk a fine line between trying to halt the Yugoslav
government's ``disproportionate use of force'' and offering aid and
comfort to the rebels seeking independence, which NATO opposes, and
has been careful to condemn the violence on both sides.

	   RED Box (M) Bhd, which is facing a winding-up petition by
Malayan Banking Bhd, said it is still confident that it can meet
all its working capital requirements and sustain its improvement in
group turnover for the current year. In a statement issued to the
Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange, the group said this is despite
operating in an unfavourable business and banking environment where
bank credit facilities are restrictive. ``While we believe that the
operational and financial impact of the winding-up petition on the
group would be minimal, it is important and we will continue to
study alternative debt restructuring and securitisation plans with
a view to settle the matter with Malayan Banking Bhd,'' the group
said. Red Box served notice on June 8 to the solicitors acting for
Malayan Banking Bhd, opposing the petition and applying for it to
be dismissed, it added.

	   SHARES on the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE) closed lower
yesterday in thin trading due to persistent selling pressure.
	   At closing, the KLSE Composite Index (KLCI) lost 6.86 points to
483.00 while the Emas Index slipped 1.92 points to 124.35. The
Second Board index lost 0.93 points to 106.64.
	   On the scoreboard, losers led gainers 410 to 130 while 182
counters remained unchanged.
	   Yesterday's turnover was higher amounting to 130.017 million
shares valued at RM297.037 million compared with 111.432 million
sharse worth RM281.706 million traded on Wednesday.
	   ``Basically, the market is still blurred by the regional
currency weakness and the only way to go seems to be down,'' said
one analyst.
	   He said with the battered yen against the US dollar, investors
are worried that this will slow business recovery in the region.
	   Fears that the Chinese yuan will be devalued also arose and if
this happens, the region's exports will lose their competitiveness,
said another analyst.
	   ``Put these fears together with other uncertainties clouding the
region and the dump-the-stocks button is triggered,'' she said.
	   Blue-chip stocks led the market's slide yesterday with utilities
Tenaga and Telekom and Maybank losing between 5 and 20 sen. Telekom
lost 20 sen to RM6.80, said to be its lowest in more than six
years.
	   The broad-based BT Ordinaries eased 2.01 points to 117.24 while
the 30- share New Straits Industrial Index slipped 26.37 points to
end at 2,902.88.
	   Turnover on the Main Board amounted to 111.743 million shares
worth RM284.166 million while turnover on the Second Board was
7.536 million shares valued at RM10.344 million.
	   Magnum was the most active with 17.599 million shares followed
by Maybank with 16.745 million and AMMB with 7,649 lots done.

	   LONDON (JP): On June 2, Californians voted by almost two-to-one
to end most teaching of immigrant school-children in their own
languages. On June 13, Queensland in Australia votes in an election
that could give the anti-immigrant One Nation party the whip hand
in the state legislature. These events are more closely linked than
they seem.
	   The United States and Australia are two of the more popular
immigrant destinations in the world, and Queensland is the 'Aussie
California': it's a 'sunshine state', it has led the other states
in population growth over the past few decades, and it is a fertile
growth medium for right-wing political movements. A couple of years
ago, it produced Pauline Hanson.
	   Hanson, a small businesswoman from the Queensland town of
Ipswich, soared to national attention by saying the rude, racist
things about immigrants -- and about Australia's own aboriginal
people -- that other rednecks had been dying to hear. She won a
seat in the last federal election, which made it impossible for the
media to ignore her, and set about building a national party.
	   This month's Queensland election is the first serious outing for
her 'One Nation' party, and the vote is so finely balanced between
the governing conservative coalition and the opposition Labor Party
that even a couple of seats would give her the balance of power in
state politics. So she has pulled all the stops out -- and with the
opinion polls equally knife-edged for the federal election due in
the next year, so have her opponents.
	   Hanson was in classic form early this month, warning voters that
a draft United Nations treaty would help aborigines, who are 2
percent of Australia's population, to set up a separate black
homeland. She named Queensland University professor Peter Jull as
the architect of the planned Nunavut homeland for the Canadian
Inuit (Eskimo) people, and alleged that he was advising the
Northern Land Council on setting up race-based states in Australia.
	   None of it was true, as she was subsequently forced to admit,
but the accusations nevertheless have an impact on those who are
predisposed to believe them. It's the same with her anti-immigrant
diatribes, and the net impact has been to double her expected vote
in Queensland from 5 to 10 percent since the campaign began.
	   That even scared Prime Minister John Howard into responding at
last. For the past two years Howard has affected to ignore Hanson,
but now he waded in: ``It is not only an inaccurate, dishonest
speech, but it verges on the deranged. This speech is appealing to
irresponsible racist sentiment in the Australian community.''
	   This condemnation came a bit late for Kim Beazley, leader of the
federal Labor party, who accuses Howard's Liberal Party of tacitly
nurturing One Nation in order to steal Labor votes: ``We say this
One Nation is simply the unacceptable face of the Liberal party.''
Unprovable, of course, but he has logic on his side, since Labor's
less-educated working-class backers (together with rural whites)
are the likeliest to be seduced by Hanson's racist song.
	   How does all this connect with California, where voters have
just approved Proposition 227 ending most 'bilingual' education in
the schools? Even though President Bill Clinton and all four
candidates for state governor opposed the proposal, it is not an
unambiguously anti-immigrant policy: many Hispanic and Asian
community leaders backed it, and so did majorities of Hispanic and
Asian voters.
	   'Bilingual' education in California was not really bilingual,
but just education in Spanish and other immigrant languages. Ron
Unz, the millionaire who sponsored Proposition 227, contended that
this consigned immigrant children to a linguistic limbo and
blighted their chances of success in American society. Many
immigrant parents clearly agreed.
	   But the broader thrust of California's referendum-driven
politics over the past 20 years is clearly anti-immigrant, and as
the proportion of white anglos has declined (from 78 percent in
1970 to 52 percent today) their resistance has grown ever fiercer.
	   The vote against 'affirmative action' two years ago has
drastically cut the number of 'minority' students admitted to
California's state university system. In the past 20 years the
school system, seen to be catering mainly to immigrant children,
has gone from 10 percent above the national average in spending per
student to 20 percent below it, with calamitous results on success
rates. And California has not built one new university campus since
1978, but it has opened twenty new prisons.
	   ``It's not explicitly racist,'' says Peter Schrag, author of the
recent 'Paradise Lost' that chonicles California's decline, ``but
it has a racist theme.'' And now the Australians (and of course the
French, with the rise of the National Front) seem to be going the
same way. Is this the fate that awaits every society that is too
open to immigrants from different cultures?
	   No. It's what happens when the political system delivers power
into the hands of a determined minority (like California's system
of referendums). It hasn't even happened in Australia yet, though
the excessively complicated electoral system makes it more possible
there. And it has certainly not happened in Canada and Britain,
though cities like Toronto and London are just as ethnically mixed
as Los Angeles and a lot more so than Sydney or Brisbane.
	   For whatever reason, English-speaking countries seem better able
to integrate and benefit from large immigration flows than most
other developed countries, but there are huge differences between
them. Canada takes in proportionally twice as many immigrants as
Australia or the U.S., with no comparable political backlash. The
United States as a whole is far to the right of other developed
countries, but few other states have traveled the same road as
California.
	   Or to put it more generally: culture matters, but politics
matters more.
	   Gwynne Dyer is a London-based independent journalist and
historian whose articles are published in 45 countries.

	   THE Composite Index futures traded on the Kuala Lumpur Options
and Financial Futures tracked the negative note of the cash market
to end lower yesterday.
	   Spot June ended at 481 with 3,546 lots traded while July futures
closed at 478 with 556 lots changing hands.
	   Open interest for June and July stood at 19,996 lots and 2,420
lots respectively.
	   The September and December futures were not traded yesterday and
they settled at 487 and 493 respectively.
	   Dealers said some players sold off their positions in view of
the weak market sentiment following the softer ringgit and the
easier performances of regional stock markets.
	   The ringgit yesterday strenghtened in late trading to close at
3.98 after being dragged to 4.0530 by a weak yen in early trading.

	   MALAYSIA will be represented by one shuttler at the United
States Open badminton championships which started in Atlanta
yesterday.
	   And that is BAM dropout Foo Yong Kean, who will be paying his
own way to the tournament.
	   The BA of Malaysia (BAM) and Nusa Mahsuri have decided not to
send their shuttlers to tournament which carries a two-star rating
this year because of the small prize money offered.
	   Many regular sponsors of the tournament, who are mostly from
Asia, have pulled out because of the present economi slowdown.
	   When it offered US$170,000 (RM680,000) the last three years and
was rated a four-star tournament, the US open is now offering only
US$40,000 (RM160,000) in prize money.
	   The weakened ringgit is also another reason why BAM felt it was
better for their shuttlers to prepare for the Malaysian Open on
July 1-5.
	   BAM general-manager Phua Tai Neng said they helped with Foo's
registration for the tournament.
	   ``He informed us that he has some business to attend to in the
United States and he will use the opportunity to take part in the
tournament,''
	   said Phua.
	   Foo, who was in the BAM academy for five years, was dropped from
the national training squad because he had not improved in the last
two years.
	   The US Open not only failed to attract the country's top players
but also from Indonesia, China and Europe.

	   In reference to Rita S. Kalibonso's letter of June 5, our eyes
have been widely opened to the naked truth. No doubt the horrifying
riots were conducted by well-organized and trained people, just
like in a war!
	   The painful result is that people have not only lost their
houses or shops, but also their loved ones. Outrageously, some
women were sexually abused and even worse, some were inhumanely
raped by irresponsible barbarians.
	   It is even more tragic to learn of the suicide of some of the
victims and those threatened with such treatment. Those who did
survive are suffering from such trauma that they are unable to
communicate.
	   We will never be able to turn the clock back to before the
rampage, and we have to hope that our military police and the army
will be able to regroup and accept the challenge to act honorably
and defend the innocent and helpless citizens of this country.
	   Ms. Rita's offer for free consultation aside, I suggest that we
try to raise some funds for the rape victims to help ease their
burden and to show that we CARE!!

Albanian militants kill Serb policemen near Kosovo capital

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Ethnic Albanian militants, boldly
stepping up their attacks, killed two Serb policemen just a few
miles from Kosovo's capital and on Friday said they command 15,000
fighters across the secessionist province.
	   Fighting between Serbian forces and the militants erupted again
in the Decani region in western Kosovo, close to the border with
Albania. It was a Serbian offensive there last week that prompted
NATO Thursday to announce a show of air power to persuade Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic to halt such assault.
	   Ethnic Albanian sources claimed that seven villages in the
Decani area were under attack Friday, including from grenade
launchers normally issued to the Yugoslav army. They said one
Albanian, named as Rexhep Mazrekaj, 38, was killed.
	   There was no independent confirmation of their report, but the
state-run Tanjug news agency in Belgrade reported that a Serb
policeman was seriously hurt in what it called an attack by ``armed
Albanian terrorists'' near one of the villages, Prilep.
	   Ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs nine-to-one in Kosovo. Most
seek independence from Serbia, which in 1989 stripped the province
of broad autonomy and has ruled repressively since. More than 250
people have been killed since Serbian police started a crackdown
against Albanian militants in March.
	   Serb sources in the province said two policemen where killed and
one was seriously wounded in an overnight ambush by separatists
near Obilic, just 7 kilometers (4.3 miles) northwest of the
provincial capital Pristina. Ethnic Albanian sources claimed one
Albanian was wounded in the same incident.
	   Fighting has come much closer to Pristina in recent weeks,
causing the occasional shutdown of the city's airport, some 12
kilometers (eight miles) west of Pristina.
	   Militants have gained much more popular support since March, and
young Kosovo Albanians who live in western Europe have gone to
Albania to organize or fight.

	   MALAYSIA, seeded third in the Asian Badminton Junior
championships, have been drawn to meet powerhouse Indonesia in the
semifinals of the tournament which begins on Monday.
	   Defending champions China, Malaysia, Indonesia and South Korea
all received byes from the first round at the draw made yesterday.
	   Malaysia, placed in the lower group, begin their campaign with
an easy match against minnows Macau and after that are expected to
meet Thailand in the quarterfinals, a team they should easily get
past.
	   Indonesia, the runnersup last year, meet Cambodia in the second
round and should not have any problem in beating Japan, their most
possible opponents in the quarterfinals.
	   China open their campaign against Maldives and probably play
India in the quarterfinals.
	   South Korea also should not have any problem beating Brunei in
the second round and Taiwan likely to be their quarterfinal
opponents.
	   In the girls' section, Malaysia will have a very tough time
getting past even the first round.
	   Failing to get a bye, the lowly placed Malaysian girls have an
uneasy task against Thailand in the first round. Thailand have
proven to be tough customers in senior and junior competitions
recently.
	   If Malaysia get past Thailand, they will meet fourth seeded
South Korea in the next round.
	   Defending champions China, who have a bye to the quarterfinals,
open their campaign against Sri Lanka and their likely opponents in
the semifinals are Japan.
	   Indonesia also start their campaign in the quarterfinals and
they are likely to play India. South Korea look their opponents in
the semifinals.
	   Twenty teams are competing in the boys' section and 11 in the
girls' section.
	   The individual tournaments begin on June 18 with 109 entries for
the boys' section, 55 entries for boys' doubles, 72 (girls'
singles), 36 (girls' doubles) and 68 (mixed doubles).
	   The Malaysians have set a target of winning at least one gold
medal.

	   THE widespread economic problems in Asia could well be an
indicator that economic globalisation has a dark side. For now, at
least, it is clear that Asia is facing an economic crisis while a
large part of the world sits back and watches. Unaffected economies
and western-based institutions seem to be satisfied that their long
standing belief that governance in Asia is riddled with bad
practices has been proven true. However, the joy of being detached
from Asia's economic problems cannot possibly last and it would be
naive for unaffected economies to assume that they will remain
immune to the economic malaise forever. In actual fact, there
exists an increasingly real threat that the economic turmoil in
Asia will spread to the rest of the world, plunging the entire
globe into a reccession.
	   It is therefore surprising that major economic powers and
powerful world institutions such as the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) have largely preferred to engage in endless negotiations
before making any move to aid the region. The recent plunge in
Asian stock markets and the value of currencies, comes at a time
when countries like the US are basking in what could be their
strongest period of economic growth to date. However, if Washington
fails to recognise the need to support Asia's swift economic
recovery, its bright days in the sun may come to a screeching halt.
In the case of the IMF, the more difficult it makes accessibility
to aid for Asian economies and the more it refuses to acknowledge
certain shortcomings in the world's financial system, the greater
the likelihood of the economic crisis sweeping across the world.
	   In less than a year, what started as a de-facto devaluation of
the Thai bhat, has developed into a massive problem that is even
threatening to drag the once mighty Japanese economy down to its
knees. The yen has slumped to its lowest level against the US
dollar and because of its close economic relations with the rest of
Asia, the regional currencies which had been grossly weakened since
last July suffered another blow. The yen's weakness also struck
Japan's faltering real economy, which according to western
observers, was due to poor financial governance on Tokyo's part.
	   If the economic problems faced by South-East Asian economies do
not attract a response from the West and institutions like the IMF,
Japan's case deserves special attention because of its position as
a net investor with huge investments the world over, including in
the US. It is perhaps the one country that has truly benefitted
from globalisation and it is practically impossible to find a spot
on the world map where Japanese goods are not present. Japan has
large investments in the US and holds a significant amount of US
bonds, which makes the reports that Japanee authorities are
scrambling for loans to help its battered financial system,
extremely worrying.
	   It is not impossible for Japan to do what many other South-East
Asian countries are adopting in their present situation - bringing
back their financial wealth from overseas. This means that Japan
could liquidate its foreign investments, including its huge
bondholdings in US and European corporations. When that happens,
the already damaged South-East Asian economy will suffer further.
The US and much of Europe would be hurt too, both in terms of
Japan's direct investments and securities as well through the
weakened imports by Asia. In addition, as Japanese direct
investments have become an important source of employment, their
return to Japan, may well be the starting point for the Asian
economic problem's transitition into a global social issue.
	   Thus, if the world fails to recognise the significance of Japan
and of assisting Asia in getting out the economic quagmire quickly,
the outlook is a grim one where only rebuilding offers a solution.
But what would there be to rebuild, when the fault lies not in the
physical aspects of the affected countries but rather in the
globalised economic system? Would it be necessary to destroy
everything first before the world has something to rebuild. We must
remember that at least two major wars fought this century were
preceded by a global recession. If that is to be the only option
now, then God help us all.

	   NEW Zealand jockey Jim Collett, who was granted a visiting
permit to ride at the current meeting in Ipoh, failed to get
immigration clearance.
	   The 38-year-old rider, who arrived in Singapore two weeks ago,
only handed in his application for work permit late last Thursday,
giving too little time for the immigration department to look into
his application.
	   The authorities had less than 24 hours to go through his papers
and on top of that, Saturday was a National holiday being the
birthday of the Agong.
	   Collett, who was booked on two rides on Saturday and five rides
on Sunday, had to be replaced. However, two of his mounts were
scratched.
	   Aussies Paul Saunders and Glenn Smith were given clearance as
their application were handed in on Monday, the day they arrived
from Australia.

	   One of the characteristics of people who feel victimized is that
they don't want to change. To be called an innocent victim, is
after all very tempting and people feel very comfortable with it.
The signs of feeling victimized are: always feeling right, not
being committed, disliking criticism and an unwillingness to take
risks.
	   A better and more adult reaction would be to take responsibility
by changing their fate, for instance by joining the current reform
movement and taking the risks in stride. The signs of taking
responsibility are: being open to criticism, being committed, a
willingness to admit past mistakes, flexibility, willingness to
take risks and accepting other's opinions.

	   RAM has reviewed and reaffirmed the long-term rating of
Ornasteel Enterprise Corp (M) Sdn Bhd's guaranteed floating rate
notes (GFRN) at BBB3.
	   The rating reflects the operating environment and financial
profile of Ornasteel Enterprise Corp. It faces fierce competition
with the lack of price regulation and tariff protection for a
majority of their products, coupled with the large number of
international players in the market.
	   Ornasteel has benefited from the weaker ringgit with over 50 per
cent of their sales exported.
	   However, the current market conditions with contracting local
demand have necessitated the need for the company to further expand
their export market.
	   Ornasteel`s first quarter results for 1998 showed an increase in
exports, which if sustainable, may help the company to weather the
current weak demand from its traditional markets.
	   The rating also takes into account the company's exposure to
product dumping by other larger regional players and its
susceptibility to raw material price fluctuations and foreign
exchange risk.
	   However, these risk factors are tempered by the company's
ability to pass off some price increase to customers.
	   RAM said that while the company recorded improved operating
profits for the financial year 1997, lower profit figures are
expected for the current financial year, given the tougher
operating conditions and higher interest cost.
	   However, with no projected capital expansion, Ornasteel`s debt
level is not expected to increase significantly.

	   RAM has downgraded the short-term rating of Invescor Ventures
Sdn Bhd's RM20 million revolving underwritten facility (RUF) to NP
from P3(s).
	   The downgrade was due to the slowdown in Invescor's construction
business, compounded with slow collection for construction work
rendered that has caused cash flow problems.
	   As such, its borrowings level increased and rising interest
rates further aggravated the company's liquidity problems.
	   RAM also said the RUF, secured by a 20 per cent stake in
Crescent Hotel Sdn Bhd that can be sold back to Taiping
Consolidated Bhd, does not offer much enhancement to the ratings as
the agency is concerned over Taiping's ability to pay Invescor on a
timely basis.
	   RAM added that Invescor had already exercised its put option
last August 8 but to date has not received the payment from
Taiping.

	   My late son, who was a devout Buddhist, taught me about karma.
It is only now that I understand what he meant by: ``To be able to
change one's karma, one has to have a deep insight into one's own
self''. And this is the hardest part to do: we all have to search
for it. In other words, we all have to do some introspection.

	   BANJA LUKA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ One British soldier
serving in the NATO-led peace force in Bosnia and one civilian have
been killed and two other people injured in a road accident, the
British forces headquarters announced Friday.
	   According to a press release, the accident occurred Thursday on
Karanovac road, ten kilometers (6.2 miles) south of Banja Luka in
northwestern Bosnia. It involved one peace force vehicle as well as
three civilian cars.
	   The British forces press office later gave the name of killed
soldier as Kevin Bell, 28.
	   Another British soldier in the same vehicle, David Wall, was
injured and is being treated at a NATO hospital in Sipovo, Bosnia.

	   MALAYSIA Airlines' ``Let the Games Begin'' album, dedicated to
all Commonwealth Games '98 athletes, is aimed at lifting the
athletes' spirits to strive for the best, Malaysia Airlines
chairman Tan Sri Tajudin Ramli said.
	   He said it is the airline's contribution in promoting the Games
not only in Malaysia but also at the international level.
	   ``Video clips of songs from the album will be screened on board
all our domestic and international flights to further promote the
Games. We expect to capture the attention of some four million
passengers over the next three months,'' he told reporters in
Petaling Jaya yesterday after the launch of the album by Youth and
Sports Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin.
	   He presented a copy of the album to Muhyiddin and Sukom Ninety
Eight executive chairman Gen (R) Tan Sri Hashim Mohd Ali.
	   Tajudin said the album will also be distributed to hotels and
sold at local music stores. The album is available in compact discs
and cassettes, at RM38 and RM15, respectively.
	   The album comprises 10 songs, ranging from moderate ballads and
rhythm and blues to jazz.

	   ALL small government contracts will now be awarded directly to
companies selected by the Government, and no longer through a main
contractor.
	   Announcing the move to end the so-called ``umbrella concept''
practice in awarding small government contracts, Deputy Prime
Minister and Finance Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim said
yesterday the Government is ensuring that these small contracts go
to genuine and deserving small-time contractors.
	   Under the umbrella concept, state governments would award a
project worth not more than RM15 million to a main contractor, who
is entrusted with the task of farming out portions of the project
to small contractors.
	   Minor contracts are defined as jobs normally handled by class F
contractors, such as upgrading rural roads and infrastructure. The
Rural Development and the Entrepreneur Development ministries
oversee the award of these projects.
	   Anwar said there have been numerous complaints from small
contractors about the award of jobs to them by the main contractor
under the umbrella concept.
	   ``We have heard many grouses from small-time contractors in
several districts who feel that, while there are merits to allocate
contracts under the umbrella concept, most of them are being left
out,'' he said at the Finance Ministry's excellence service awards
presentation in Kuala Lumpur yesterday.
	   As such, he said, all new contracts will be awarded directly to
small contractors identified by the Government. Small-time
contractors can now deal direct with district offices to bid for
jobs.
	   Existing contracts under the umbrella concept, however, will not
be affected by the new ruling.
	   Anwar said the Government needs to ensure that the interests of
the small-time contractors are safeguarded.
	   ``At a time when the country is facing difficult times
economically, we do not want to appear to be attending only to the
problems of the bigger contractors and ignoring those of the
small-time contractors.'' ``I have met the menteris besar and
officials of the state governments and the ministries of Rural
Development and Entrepreneur Development. They have been told that
the award of contracts under the umbrella concept will be done away
with.
	   ``Instead, we have reverted to the old system,'' he said.
	   Deputy Finance Minister Datuk Dr Affifuddin Omar said the
current economic slowdown caused projects to be shelved and this
had contributed to lesser jobs being allocated to minor
contractors.
	   He said established contractors involved in the umbrella concept
have been known to farm out jobs to minor contractors ``as and when
they please''.
	   ``For example, in the Padang Terap parliamentary constituency,
most minor contractors did not secure contracts ... the established
contractor would only allocate jobs to only 15 contractors whereas
50 more of them did not get any,'' he said.
	   Affifuddin said only contracts worth more than RM15 million
would have to go through the minister's tender committee.
	   Bernama reports: Umno Youth has welcomed the government's move
to stop issuing minor contracts under the umbrella concept to
ensure survival of small-scale contractors.
	   Its chief, Datuk Ahmad Zahid Hamidi, said government agencies
should act immediately on the new ruling.
	   Zahid said established companies awarded projects under the
umbrella concept had not transparently distributed them to the
small-scale contractors.
	   He told reporters this after the launching of a state-level
workers' savings programme through Bank Simpanan Nasional by
Menteri Besar Tan Sri Ramli Ngah Talib in Ipoh, Perak.
	   Zahid, who is also BSN chairman, said most of the main
contractors would award the projects to companies linked to them
and this practice was killing other small-scale contractors.

	   In this day and age, it saddens to read a letter such as that
written by Sumarsono Sastrowardoyo The Jakarta Post, May 30, 1998,
in which he criticized the Chinese-Indonesian who fled the country
during the recent riots.
	   If only you had experienced your house or shop-office being
surrounded by hundreds of people attempting to get in with fire in
their hands (God knows what they were going to do to your family).
	   If you heard from your relatives or friends that they lost
everything in a single day, or that your nephew was badly beaten up
and left for dead on the road, or that women were brutally gang
raped, or heard the constant screaming or crying of your next door
neighbors at night when a mob came.
	   If only you experience all this and then could judge for
yourself what course of action to take to safeguard your loved
ones. Have you seen the Glodok, Angke and Pesing areas lately? Then
tell me that you think the Chinese are to blame for having your
so-called ``seized'' mentality?
	   It may be true that the riots were purely criminal in nature,
that the masses woke up one day and had the urge to cause damage
with no political instigation, nor hint of racism. Maybe some
people just put out their peci (Moslem cap) or pray mats out to dry
on their windowsills because it was sunny day or they wanted to be
known as proreformists, pribumi (indigenous) Moslems or even a Pak
haji on that particular day. Maybe the ``friendly'' mobs that day
stopped motorcyclists on the road demanding that they take off
their helmets just in order to get to know them much better. It's
amazing that people on motorcycles or even minibus went from one
place to another with rocks in their hands, calling for the masses
to loot and burn. And yet no one has investigated who was the
mastermind behind all these acts. It's amazing that these acts were
not prevented for two straight days. Will the government seriously
investigate all this?
	   It maybe also true that Chinese-Indonesians never fought side by
side with pribumi against the Dutch. Does this mean we are less
nationalistic? Does this mean we don't contribute anything to the
nation? If this is so, it's a pity that people like Rudy Hartono,
Susi Susanti, Tan Cheng Bok, Titiek Puspa are all of Chinese
descent. It's a pity, too, that most Chinese here cannot even speak
Chinese or even write a single Chinese character, but are fluent in
Bahasa Indonesia or Javanese only.
	   Stereotyping does not serve any beneficial purpose to anyone and
is even dangerous in the long run. Not all Chinese are rich and
pribumi poor. Not all Chinese are evil nor all pribumi good. Humans
are all alike. I regret that through the years the government has
not shown any seriousness in narrowing the disparity gap between
the rich and poor, changing the image of the Chinese minority group
(as if all Chinese are Mr. Edy Tansil!) and most importantly
putting a stop to making the Chinese scapegoats or the valve of
frustration for the masses.
	   Prejudice and discrimination left unchecked can only lead to
extreme excesses such as what occurred recently. I hope and pray
that the racial subject of non-pribumi or pribumi will no longer be
an issue to future generations, that those all born, living and
dying in this beloved nation are simply called Indonesians.

	   SHARE prices across the region were mostly down yesterday, as
the sluggish Japan economy and depreciation of the yen against the
greenback continued to inflict pain in the region's stock markets.
	   The yen breached the 142 barrier to the US dollar yesterday,
causing worries that business recovery in the region would be
slowed down.
	   Another concern was the possibility that the yuan would be
devalued, which would see a decline in the competitiveness of Asian
exports.
	   Analysts said the yen's depreciation yesterday was triggered by
falls in Japanese stocks and bonds.
	   Tokyo's share price closed 2.12 per cent lower yesterday, with
the key Nikkei stock average of 225 selected issues on the Tokyo
Stock Exchange falling 325.219 points to end at 15,014.04.
	   In Kuala Lumpur, the KLSE Composite Index lost 6.86 points, or
1.14 per cent, to 483.00 while the Emas Index slipped 1.92 points
to 124.35. The second board index lost 0.93 points to 106.64.
	   Total turnover was thin at 130.017 million shares valued at
RM297.037 million, compared with 111.432 million shares worth
RM281.706 million on Wednesday.
	   ``Basically, the market is still blurred by the regional
currency weakness and the only way to go seems to be down,'' said
an analyst.
	   Another big loser was the Hong Kong market, which was down 1.17
per cent on concerns about the impact of a yuan devaluation and the
Hong Kong dollar's peg to the US dollar.
	   At closing, the Hang Seng index was down 93.29 points to
7,886.07.
	   Also down were the Taiwan weighted index, closing 12.389 points
lower to 7,210.74, and the Stock Exchange of Thailand index, down
8.18 points at 283.92.
	   In Manila, shares were down 88.85 points to 1,829.02. Likewise
in Sydney, share prices fell 1.3 per cent amid concern about the
lower Asian equity markets.
	   There was a different scenario across the Causeway when its
shares closed 1.8 per cent higher on bargain hunting. Singapore's
benchmark stock index, the Straits Times Industrials index, rose
19.02 points to 1,086.83.
	   Also up were Indonesian stocks, with the Jakarta Stock Exchange
Composite Index closing 3.46 points higher at 411.544.

	   JAKARTA (JP): The May 12 fatal shooting of four Trisakti
University students, allegedly carried out by the security forces,
marks a black day in the history of modern Indonesia. The tragic
deaths of students who were demanding democratic reform occurred in
conjunction with a wider process of democratization beginning in
1990 amid global trends favoring democratic institutions and
respect for human rights and the rule of law.
	   It is ironic that such a peaceful student demonstration was met
with force and live bullets. Whatever the justification offered by
the authorities for the loss of life, it is clear the right to life
has been sacrificed to serve political interests of an
authoritarian regime.
	   The shootings were only the beginning of a tragedy as the masses
burned and looted Chinese-Indonesian commercial establishments and
homes the following days.
	   More than 1,200 people died as a result of the May 14-May 16
riots. Throughout this period, there was no evidence that the
security forces made any serious effort to stop it. Once again, the
ethnic Chinese have been victimized by the masses who were incited
to riots in what smacked of racism to serve the interests of some
political elites.
	   The New Order regime which accused China of abetting the
attempted communist coup in 1965 has persistently fanned the flames
of racial sentiment for political gain.
	   Since then, Chinese schools have been closed, written Chinese
characters banned, spoken Chinese outlawed and Chinese cultural
expressions prohibited so that the Indonesian people have developed
the perception that everything relating to the Chinese is bad and
should be avoided.
	   The New Order regime under Soeharto promoted anti-Chinese
policies in which ethnic Chinese-Indonesians were not given
opportunities for political expression -- the absence of ethnic
Chinese ministers in the six Soeharto cabinets -- was clear
evidence.
	   The House of Representatives (DPR) almost never had ethnic
Chinese members nor the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR). Also
no ethnic Chinese leaders were permitted to participate in
political activities in the political parties or Golkar with the
exception of Kwik Kian Gie of the Indonesian Democratic Party. It
is clear the New Order regime practiced a policy of devide et
impera originally implemented by the Netherlands East Indies
colonial government.
	   The appointment of Mohamad ``Bob'' Hasan, a longtime Soeharto
associate who is Chinese-Indonesian, as minister of trade and
industry in the Seventh Development Cabinet was not so much the
voluntary option of the New Order regime as a panic response by a
government facing a wave of reform.
	   The government's policy of resisting the emergence of opposition
parties and forces was rejected decisively by thousands of students
throughout the country. Simultaneously and spontaneously, there
emerged opposition to the New Order regime and a demand that
Soeharto step down.
	   These divisive politic tactics were so extensive that they
embraced numerous other conflicts such as Moslem versus non-Moslem,
indigenous people versus nonindigenous people, conglomerates versus
small and middle level entrepreneurs, military versus civilians and
Old Order versus New Order.
	   Additionally, lawyers' organizations were splintered into weak
components, labor organizations constrained, journalists'
organizations prohibited and any organization which managed to
gather strength was compromised through co-option, intrigues,
intimidation and pressure.
	   The most vivid example of this was the toppling of the
Indonesian Democratic Party's leader Megawati Soekarnoputri, who
was undermined and virtually driven from the formal political
arena. The opposition has been inappropriately treated like an
enemy.
	   Lawyer Adnan Buyung Nasution's statement before a DPR session on
May 14 contained much truth when he said that if the government
could not protect its own people, this country might as well be
dissolved because it was not functioning in accordance with the
principles set out by its founding fathers. The purpose of the
establishment of the Republic of Indonesia, the founding fathers
said, was to protect all citizens without exception.
	   Ironically, shortly after this statement was made, Tanah Tinggi
in Central Jakarta and other areas were torched by the raging
masses.
	   That people are different from birth is a fact of life. Love for
one's own kind, language, culture, customs and traditions, soil and
nationality is a worthy right of every person. However, in the end,
we all must recognize a universal humanity. To accentuate the
differences or to promote one as better than the other is inhumane
and at odds with basic human rights.
	   Much more pronounced than the differences are the similarities
shared by all people. Among these are the basic human rights that
cannot be diminished, reduced, obstructed or taken away by the
authority, the most authoritative regime or the most dominant
majority of the most repressive military regime.

	   WELL, what do you know! A Malaysian play is making inroads
elsewhere. Very soon Light Bulbs, which was staged here in 1996 and
received rave reviews, will be seen in ``the city that never
sleeps''. Yes, New York, New York.
	   Said Light Bulbs writer-director Karen Quah in a Press release,
the play will be staged at the New York International Fringe
Festival (FringeNYC) from Aug 19 to 30. Now, how about that?!
Originally a production of The Actors Studio, Light Bulbs starred
Johanna Varghese, Sandra Sodhy and Huzir Sulaiman.
	   This slick blend of theatre, live music, video and slide
projection focuses on a rock band called Light Bulbs. It examines
the intricacies of local pop culture and the influence of the
Western media on Malaysian society.
	   Varghese will once again star. She will be joined at the
FringeNYC by actors Afdlin Shauki, Jit Woei, Vishal Doshi and Lina
Teoh.
	   So, you can start spreading the news...
	   ERMA Fatima may feel slightly down these days. Although her BNE
Studio has been cooking up some very entertaining made-for-TV
dramas like Pengantin Popular, Ratu Jamu and Orang Gaji, she has
been forced to give up her office and operate from the comfort of
her home.
	   The latest we heard is that her products have not been moving.
For instance, Jangan, which was judged Best Drama at last year's
Malaysian Film Festival, has yet to be bought by any TV station.
	   The fact is, there are no takers because TV stations have cut
down on new purchases due to budget constraints. Which is a shame,
really, because the drama is said to be marvellous.
	   Apparently, Erma was also unprepared to take out several scenes
as requested by a buyer.
	   You sure can hit rough waters in show business...
	   THE Corrs' Talk On Corners, which knocked Celine Dion's titanic
My Heart Will Go On off the top of the RIM charts eight weeks ago,
is still firmly perched there.
	   Sales of the group's album of the same name has hit platinum
with over 25,000 units sold here. Besides striking success in
Malaysia, Talk On Corners has been certified gold in France,
Canada, Norway and Japan; double platinum in Spain, Denmark and New
Zealand; and an unprecedented eight times-over platinum in
Australia and Ireland.
	   Comprising Andrea on lead vocals, Caroline on
drums/bodhran/vocals, Sharon on violin/vocals and Jim on
keyboards/guitar/vocals, they came to our shores this year to grace
the AIM '97 awards.
	   The Corrs, whose other hits include I Never Loved You Anyway and
Don't Say You Love Me, looks set to ride the waves for a few more
weeks or at least, until another ship arrives on the horizon.

	   INFORMATION Technology (IT) can play a dual role for companies -
it can enhance their efficiency while increasing automation for
production.
	   ``There are basically two parts to the use of IT in industries:
its function in increasing the efficiency of the company, and where
IT helps to increase automation and thereby production,'' said
Mimos Bhd vice president of the commercial sector Rafee Yusoff.
	   Rafee said IT can help a company to become more efficient,
competitive and to survive and compete in a global environment.
	   He added that e-commerce programmers can now sell more products
and services and should thus invest in the sort of solutions that
can expand their business.
	   ``If they are only thinking of current business, they will
shrink. We are saying, use this opportunity to invest and therefore
get new business opportunities.'' Rafee also said that
opportunities for e-commerce have not been fully exploited. ``One
should invest in IT opportunities that will create more business.''
On how costs can be reduced, he said that instead of resorting to
layoffs, a company should strive to survive. ``If they survive and
create more business opportunities, only then can we talk about
creating more jobs,'' he said, adding that this whole process is a
cycle.
	   ``Many people neglect to ensure that their system is integrated
and their productivity system expandable through the use of
e-commerce.
	   ``Since many fail to see this, they have two separate systems.
When they are looking into expansion, they realise that their
current investment for automation is not tailored for Internet and
therefore they have double investments.'' He noted that today the
trend is to invest in technology which can do both functions.
	   Rafee also said that IT should be looked at as a future
investment and business opportunity, rather than a short-term cost
problem.
	   ``People are looking at IT as a cost problem and as such, they
are losing money by investing in it. I say, look at IT as a
business opportunity and as a strategic investment to expand your
business.'' He added that initially, many companies think about
reducing cost but what they fail to recognise is the tremendous
opportunities available as a result of investing in IT.
	   He said because many are focusing on IT as only a tool that
improves their efficiency and productivity, it appears to them as a
cost item.
	   ``I am not saying that this is wrong. That must be done but at
the same time, to increase your revenue you must do both,'' he
urged.
	   Asked how far the current economic climate has affected the IT
sector, Rafee said it is too early to judge although some IT
companies have been hit by the situation.
	   Nevertheless, he said a Website has been created for those who
are looking for opportunities in MSC companies.
	   ``The Multimedia Super Corridor is the indicator of our IT
industry and at the end of 1997 and early 1998, it was moving in
the same direction, that is, growing as fast. We are assuming
therefore that the opportunities are there.
	   ``We are taking these opportunities to create or re-engineer a
change by encouraging those who are in other industries to take the
opportunities in the MSC.'' Looking at the positive aspect of
layoffs of IT professionals, he said: ``Where we earlier had
difficulties getting knowledgeable workers in the MSC, today
because of the economic downturn, professionals who were in other
industries can focus more on the MSC.
	   ``Therefore, the MSC is growing. On the other hand, the IT
industry in Malaysia is affected as they are dependant on the local
companies for their businesses and they are affected.
	   ``We hope this idea of IT to increase productivity and
efficiency is there, and this is a time to invest in IT. Where one
can no longer sustain labour intensive activities, IT can
definitely help.'' Rafee said generally, e-commerce is thought of
as an ability to use IT in telecommunications and computer
technology to enable us to do better business and to expand
business.
	   E-business is viewed as anything to do with electronic and
computer business that helps trading or helps people to do business
- everything that has to do with facilitating trade.
	   ``Today we have to rethink the use of technology to facilitate
trade and business,'' he noted.
	   To improve the software development industry in the region, an
exhibition called Software Development Asia '98 will be held from
July 7 to 9 at the Putra World Trade Centre in Kuala Lumpur.

	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ Substitute Christophe Dugarry
back-headed a corner from Zinedine Zidane in the 34th minute,
giving France a 1-0 lead over South Africa in the World Cup opener
for both teams Friday night.
	   Dugarry, who came on as a substitute for Stephane Guivarc'h only
seven minutes before, beat South African keeper Hans Vonk to the
corner and flicked it with the back of his head inside the far
post.
	   It was the finale in a series of chances the French created in
quick succession. Only a minute after coming on, Dugarry broke in
on Vonk unmarked, only to have the South African keeper come
quickly off his line to snuff out the threat.
	   The game started slowly with South Africa limited to one
legitimate chance in the entire half. Brandan Augustine's free kick
from 25 meter was blocked by Emmanuel Petit.
	   But Zidane, a best friend of Dugarry and whom many think is
responsible for the reserve's place on the team, created two
chances in the first 17 minutes on free kicks.
	   His first from 25 meters in the second minute skidded wide of
the right post and his second went over the bar.
	   A strong wind that blew toward the South African goal seemed to
hurt the World Cup debutante's clearances and long pases from the
back. But the French were clearly dominant, gaining control of the
game after the first 15 minutes.
	   One of South Africa's few dangerous moments came in the 20th
minute when French keeper Fabien Barthez had to come out to the top
of the box to chest away a bounding through ball. After getting to
the ball, he collided with Benedict McCarthy and was knocked off
his feet before the ball was cleared from danger.

	   METACORP Bhd, a toll road operator and property developer, said
it has submitted a proposal to the Government to upgrade several
congested roads in the Klang Valley leading into Kuala Lumpur city.
	   The company is proposing to upgrade the road from the Loke Yew
roundabout to Bank Negara, from Taman Melawati to Jalan Pahang and
from the Jalan Pahang-Jalan Tun Razak roundabout to the city,
Metacorp chief executive officer Yusli Mohamed Yusoff said.
	   Speaking to reporters after Metacorp`s annual general meeting
yesterday, he said the company made its presentation to the Works
Ministry about a year ago, but declined to disclose the project
cost.
	   Yusli said many motorists had complained that it was unfair for
them to pay toll to use the upgraded stretches which only led to
traffic-congested roads.
	   ``However, the road users are not aware that these bottlenecks
are beyond our concession areas and there is nothing the company
can do,'' he pointed out.
	   ``As such, Metacorp is proposing to upgrade these congested
stretches to ease the traffic flow into the city,'' Yusli said.
	   If the Government gives the green light for the project, the
alternative for the company to recoup its huge investment is to
seek the extension of the toll collection period on its four
concessions, which ends between 2003 and 2018, and some toll
increase.
	   ``This is because no more toll booths can be build along the
concession stretches as that will slow down the traffic flow,''
Yusli said.
	   He said the company collects about RM60 million in tolls a year
from its four concessions at Jalan Cheras, Jalan Pahang, East-West
Link Expressway and Sungei Besi Expressway.
	   The company exprienced a 1 per cent drop in traffic using its
toll roads. Yusli said this was partly due to people travelling by
other transport modes and the traffic diversion with the opening of
more roads.
	   On property development, he said Metacorp's UK subsidiary Precis
(1474) Ltd has a one-third interest in Spitalfields Holdings Ltd
and Spitalfields Development Group.
	   A large part of the Spitalfields site was sold to London
International Financial Futures &AMP; Options Exchange (Liffe) in
April. Part of the proceeds from the transaction was used to reduce
the group`s borrowings by STG10 million (STG1  &QC;  RM6.51).
	   Meanwhile, Datuk Mohamed Ishak Mohamed Ariff, Mr David Willian
Berry  &LR;  Dayan Wazir Berry and Encik Marzuki Rafie were re-elected
as directors of the company.
	   The results of their re-election were delayed by the counting of
votes, as the shareholders requested the voting to be carried out
by ballots rather than a show of hands.
	   In his statement to shareholders, Mohamed Ishak said that
barring any further deterioration of the economy, the directors
expect the financial performance of the group for 1998 to exceed
that of 1997 with the anticipated increase from its overseas
investment.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Thurs. - Two ex-aides of a former Selangor Menteri
Besar were arrested today by the Anti-Corruption Agency for
allegedly using their position in connection with a land deal.
	   One of them is alleged to have accepted a RM1.2 million bribe
from a person with whom he had official business dealings.
	   Both were alleged to have misused their positions in connection
with a land application from a company in which they had a vested
interest.
	   An ACA statement issued today confirmed that the ex-aides, aged
46 and 54, from a former Selangor Menteri Besar's office in Shah
Alam, were arrested by ACA superintendents Hishamuddin Hashim and
Alias Salim about 10.20am when they turned up at the ACA
headquarters in Persiaran Duta.
	   They had been earlier asked to report to the agency's Economic
Investigation Department.
	   The two will be charged under section 2(1) of the Emergency
(Essential Powers) Ordinance 22/1970 in the Shah Alam Sessions
Court tomorrow morning.
	   The section states that any public officer who has used his
public position or office for his pecuniary or other advantage
shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable to a maximum fine
of RM20,000 or 14 years' jail or both upon conviction.
	   The ACA said one of them, currently attached to the Ministry of
Rural Development, would, in addition, face four charges under
section 165 of the Penal Code, for allegedly accepting a RM1.2
million bribe.
	   He will be charged under section 165 of the Penal Code at the
Sessions Court in Kuala Lumpur tomorrow afternoon.
	   Anyone convicted under section 165 is liable to be imprisoned up
to two years or fined or both.
	   The ACA investigation followed a report lodged by Pas Youth
secretary Mahfuz Omar with its Selangor headquarters in Shah Alam
on Dec 29.
	   The investigation focused on alleged corrupt practices and
misuse of powers in connection with the conversion of a 40ha forest
area in Bukit Sungai Putih, Hulu Langat, involving the ex-aides of
the former Menteri Besar.
	   It was reported that the land was gazetted as a forest reserve
in 1972, but the State Executive Council decided in 1990 to
degazette it.
	   The land was originally part of the Bukit Sungai Putih forest
reserve and had been earmarked for mixed development after a
logging licence was given to a company.
	   ACA officers interviewed and took statements from all parties
involved in the decision-making including State Forestry Department
officers and State executive councillors, past and present.
	   During a follow-up action in December 1996, ACA officers said
they found one of the two ex-aides with about RM1.5 million in his
car, parked at his house in Shah Alam.
	   The two former aides spent over an hour at the ACA headquarters
today before posting bail.
	   One of them was released on RM400,000 bail while the other was
released on RM200,000 bail.

	   BANDUNG (JP): While the new law on political parties has not
been formulated yet, enthusiasm for establishing new parties has
led to the creation of new political alignments in Indonesia.
Several mass organizations have proclaimed the formation of new
parties (see article written by I. Haryanto, Jakarta Post on June
6, 1998). Others are still thinking about forming parties, and look
likely to do so soon.
	   This phenomenon indicates that political parties are seen as
essential to the ``reform order''. Broadly speaking, in Western
democracy there is little doubt that political parties play a
considerable role in establishing stable democratic politics. Their
functions include articulating and aggregating interests, and
organizing and promoting candidates for governmental office through
general elections.
	   Yet, some questions need to be considered further: will new
alignments in the pretransitional process really bring about
democratization? How can political parties improve democratization
in a country which for many years suffered from authoritarianism?
	   There are at least three theoretical reasons why these questions
matter. The first reason is that, in many former authoritarian
countries, political parties tend to lack experience in democratic
tradition because they had little or no chance to learn and
practice democracy due to the implementation of authoritarian
rules.
	   The lack of such political experience may lead parties to make
political mistakes and misjudgments in early phases of party
formation. These mistakes and misjudgments inevitably affect
parties' political behavior in new political circumstances.
Moreover, while political parties lost their chance to learn
democratic traditions, they were forced to support the
authoritarian regime or, if they did not do so, they were
disbanded.
	   The lack of experience as regards to democratic procedures and
parties' habits of operating in a nondemocratic environment during
an authoritarian era inevitably affect how, and to what extent,
parties promote democratization in the first stages of the
transition. Having struggled to oppose authoritarianism, parties
will now experience difficulty in negotiating with other parties or
the government when they once had to accept proposals presented by
their counterparts.
	   Compromising may be difficult for parties who for many years
experienced various refusals from the authoritarian regime. If they
fail to win support for their proposals, they may engage in
extra-legislative actions, such as hunger strikes, boycotting the
legislature or being absent from decision-making situations rather
than accepting others' proposals. Consequently their activities may
hinder democratization.
	   The transition to democracy in South Korea shows how difficult
it is for parties to practice democratic principles in the
transitional period. South Korean parties often reached a deadlock
when negotiating proposals because each party wanted their
proposals to be accepted. Opposition parties then boycotted
parliament and hindered the ruling party's assemblymen in entering
parliament. Taiwan and some countries in southern Europe are other
instances that show similar problems.
	   Second, while parties have to adjust to new traditions, they
face a real problem as regards the uncertainty of new
circumstances. Even though a set of rules has been introduced (or
remains in the making), it may not guarantee the certainty of new
politics. The rules may be changed or remain open to debate.
	   Meanwhile, the democratic political system is still ``absent''
or is a provisional one as an alternative for achieving the change
from an authoritarian political system. Accordingly, while they
deal with the formation of parties, they have to be concerned also
with the establishment of a certain type of political system. Yet
the negotiations between remaining elements of the authoritarian
system and opposition parties to adopt a certain new kind of
political system becomes essential in the first stage of
democratization.
	   The negotiation may raise another problem because each party
would attempt to implement a type of system which it considers
would strengthen its own position in the new politics. In this
sense, their preferences may create a serious obstacle to the
establishment of a stable democratic system.
	   Moreover, the absence of a well-institutionalized party system
creates a serious problem as well. The party system reflects the
pattern of competition and cooperation between different parties as
well as the distribution of strength among existing political
parties. The transitional period becomes an era which leads to the
formation of a party system.
	   Since contesting polls and political participation are
guaranteed in a democracy, the party system emerges out of
competing parties. The competition among parties determines which
party mayexist and which one collapses, depending on the number of
votes they gain in general elections. The party system in a
democracy is not created merely by the government or any other
institution, but it develops from the political constellation
formed by competing parties. Once it emerges, it is influenced by
the state as well as by political parties.
	   The genesis of a party system may look simple. In fact, the
politics of coalition-making among parties and the politics of
separation of coalition parties make the creation of a party system
a complex and uncertain issue. Despite the vulnerability for
factional strife within coalitions, political parties often attempt
to form a coalition. They see the formation of a coalition as an
inevitable path to fulfill requirements set by law or to counter
other parties' moves in the legislative body, since such a
coalition means the accumulation of power for the party within the
legislature.
	   Once a coalition is formed, it has to deal with the problem of
consolidation. The cohesiveness of a coalition is questionable
since the differences among those forming it tend to be difficult
to overcome. Consequently, factional disputes become a latent
problem, and can even dissolve a coalition. The party system cannot
be secured and remains fluid. This situation may lead to
uncertainties in a new democratic system.
	   Third, political parties are often created around ``charismatic
leaders'' whose popularity evolved during the authoritarian era.
The parties' cohesiveness then will be influenced by these leaders.
The popularity of the leaders will also become an attribute which
plays a major role in vote gathering in general elections. This
will bring about the so-called personalism-centered politics.
	   There should be a clear-cut mechanism which determines to what
extent party leaders may exert their influence within their party.
However, there is another obstacle. In the transitional period, the
popular figures would remain powerful for both cohesiveness and the
party's popularity. The question is how the figures themselves
perceive the significance of their party for real politics? In many
cases, the figures see their parties as a tool for achieving the
top political spot. They then would take any chance to hold
governmental office, by exerting their influence within their
parties. If they did so, it would be another serious obstacle to
democratization.
	   How can democracy be established under these circumstances? Can
political parties, especially undemocratic ones, improve
democratization in the country?
	   Two hypothetical propositions may be presented to asses the
extent to which democracy may be established.
	   First, political parties need to be organized democratically so
that they may improve democratization. The more democratic
political parties there are, the more democratic the country is
likely to be. The explanation is simple; it is considered
impossible to democratize a country if its political parties do not
practice democratic principles within party organizations. Being a
proponent of democratization means getting used to democratic
principles. To get used to those principles is only possible if
parties implement those principles within their organizations.
Hence, political parties should be created and organized on a
democratic basis. In fact, this is not a simple matter for either
well established or newly established parties.
	   The second proposition suggests that parties do not need to be
internally democratic so long as they are committed to acting
democratically outside their organization. Democratically organized
parties may develop simultaneously with the implementation of
democratic principles in the country. This proposition indicates
that parties' cohesiveness is more important than how democratic
the parties are. So long as they act cohesively in competition with
other parties, they may promote the implementation of democratic
principles. Moreover, the cohesiveness of parties is very
important, since parties have to compete with others to win general
elections or to gain enough legislative seats to have influence in
the new political system. Hence, performance outside the
organization is more important than performance within the
organization.
	   The formation of parties at the initial stage of democratization
may justify the second proposition. The most important party's task
is to gain enough seats in the legislative body, so that the party
may be permitted to survive. Yet another problem arises. When the
democratic manner in competition does not prove helpful in
acquiring votes, so-called money politics may be considered as a
breakthrough. The new law on political parties could set a limit on
campaign funds. However, it would not prove helpful if parties
concerned only with seat-gathering used any means to show that they
do not break the law.
	   There is no need to be overly skeptical about the rise of new
political parties. However, many new political tasks may need to be
handled well. This is to say that establishing democracy is not
simple. Without commitment to establishing a rule on democratic
competition and respecting this rule in its implementation, new
political alignments will further deepen political uncertainty.

	   CHICKEN is probably the country's safest meat as it is mostly
free from the cancer-causing nitrofuran antibiotic, Health Minister
Datuk Chua Jui Meng announced yesterday.
	   From the 135 random samples of chicken meat and eggs collected
throughout the country between the first four months this year,
only 3.7 per cent or five samples of the meat have been found to
have residues of nitrofuran. The eggs were also nitrofuran-free.
	   The tests were conducted by the ministry at its nine food
laboratories nationwide, he told a press conference in Kuala Lumpur
after chairing a meeting with Non-Governmental Organisations
(NGOs).
	   ``Today, some 96.3 per cent of chicken breeders and sellers
abide the regulations in banning the use of nitrofuran.
	   ``As such, it can be said that chicken meat and eggs are safe
for eating,'' he said.
	   The Cabinet, realising the danger of the use of nitrofuran by
chicken breeders as a growth-promoter, decided to ban its use on
August 21 1996.
	   Those who flout the regulations are liable to five years'
imprisonment and/or fine (unlimited) under the Food and Drugs Act
1952. Five chicken sellers have been brought to Court and one has
been fined RM4,000 or three months' jail.
	   Before the ban was imposed, the use of nitrofuran was widespread
in the country.
	   Immediately after the ban, the ministry found that 51 per cent
of the 142 samples of chicken meats nationwide showed residues of
the chemical.
	   At at the end of last year, some 53,000kg of nitrofuran were
surrendered to the ministry. Of the total, 48,000kg were exported
to countries which allow the use of nitrofuran while the rest were
destroyed.
	   Chua expressed confidence that the ministry's target to have 0
per cent use of nitrofuran in chickens by the end of this year can
be achieved.
	   The ministry will continue to take samples of chicken meat and
eggs from the farms and markets for tests at its laboratories.
	   The minister also said that the ministry is also monitoring the
use of beta-agonist to feed pigs and some cattle as it is against
the Food and Drugs Act.
	   The chemical has side-effects on humans, especially those with
cardiovascular problems and diabetics.
	   Earlier in his speech, Chua stressed the importance of
accountability and integrity in the administration of NGOs.
	   The Finance Ministry has set a condition that NGOs, which
receive financial assistance from the Government, are bound by
certain guidelines.
	   One such guideline is that the NGOs have to keep the money they
get from Government separate from other financial assistance
received from other agencies.
	   ``The NGOs also have to submit a progress report of a project
and financial report within 30 days after the project begins as
well as the final report on the project.
	   ``They should not go against the Government's or the ministry's
policies and must allow the ministry to conduct checks and audit
any project or sit on any committee,'' he said.

	   NS CHEMPAKA will have a tough battle on their hands when they
take on Malacca in the opening Premier Two second round match at
the Kubu Stadium tonight.
	   Regaining their confidence will be their first battle especially
after their 3-0 defeat to Perak in the FA Cup second round second
leg match at the Paroi Stadium on Tuesday.
	   Chempaka, currently second in the table behind league leaders
Terengganu with 12 points after seven matches, are in no position
to expect an easy win even though they have beaten Malacca 3-0
before at the Paroi Stadium.
	   This is because Chempaka will be without several key players who
are out due to injury and suspensions whereas Malacca look to be in
great form after having thrashed the more experienced Premier One
side Negri Sembilan 4-1 (5-2 on aggregate) in the FA Cup second
round.
	   Yusafizan Johar, the top scorer of the team with five goals,
would most probably be out as he is still suffering from the ankle
injury he sustained against Police two weeks ago.
	   Meanwhile defenders R. Michael and Fatawu Ibrahim will miss
tonight's game after collecting two yellow cards each.
	   However, midfielder V. Arumugan, who was out in the recent FA
Cup match due to a hamstring injury is back and will support
Stephen Abarowei and Roshan Pereira on the forwardline.
	   ``The players have to work very hard and must have the
concentration and self-confidence to win the match,'' said team
coordinator K.
	   Dharmarajasingham.
	   ``With the FA Cup out of our reach, we have to concentrate on
the Malaysia Cup,'' he added.

	   THE FA of Selangor (FAS) council convened an emergency meeting
yesterday and agreed that their president, Datuk Aini Taib, has to
go.
	   Aini did not attend the meeting held at a hotel in Kuala Lumpur
but 21 of the 27 elected council members turned up.
	   Nineteen of the members called on Aini to step down gracefully
or the council would convene an extraordinary general meeting and
do the needful.
	   According to vice-president Datuk Mokhtar Ahmad, the reason for
the meeting last night was because they have lost faith in Aini as
he had failed to bring in funds and to settle debts incurred last
year.
	   The council said that when Aini took over as team manager of the
Selangor side in 1993, they were no debts. And when Aini became
president two year later, they had ample funds including RM100,000
in fixed deposits.
	   However, Selangor now have a debt of RM1.6 million.
	   And they have also yet to settle the income tax for former
striker Tony Cottee who played for them about six months.
	   ``We have done all we could do to get Aini to find ways to ease
our financial problems,'' said Mokhtar.
	   ``But there has been nothing from his side to this day. So it is
best we find a new president who can get the funds to run our
team.''
	   It is understood that Menteri Besar Datuk Abu Hassan Omar has
been approached to take over as president.
	   Apparently Abu Hassan has promised the FAS council members that
should he not want the job, he will nominate a candidate who will
be able to bring in funds.
	   Already faced with a RM1.6 milllion debt, the gate takings this
season has dropped drastically.
	   Selangor who used to get an average attendance of 45,000 per
match in past seasons now average 5,000.
	   According to Mokhtar, Aini was informed on Sunday about last
night's emergency council meeting.
	   ``However, he informed us that he will not attend the meeting,''
said Mokhtar.
	   ``But we decided to go ahead with the meeting. The FAS legal
officers advised that that we were within our right to continue
with this meeting.''
	   Mokhtar added they will now write to Aini explaining why they
want him to step down and will wait for his answer before taking
the next course of action.

	   FOR Sarawak manager coach Alan Vest there is still hope this
season even though their FA Cup campaign came to an end when
Selangor edged them 3-2 on aggregate.
	   According to Vest, his team bowed out of the FA Cup with their
heads high knowing fully well that injury problems that ravaged the
team ruled out any realistic challenge.
	   Even then, they had displayed sheer guts despite their odds in
the FA Cup.
	   Now with the near return to fitness of a few key players, they
are focussing on the Malaysia Cup, with Premier One title almost
out of their hands.
	   Troubled by injuries to nine players throughout the season in
what is his worst season, Vest's hopes is raised with the return of
Billy Bone and Shamsurin Abdul Rahman - two players who had been
out for months and had not been physically nor match fit when they
played in the last match against Selangor.
	   The progress of key players on the injured list who had at least
started to train in the past few days like Alistair Edwards,
playmaker Nazri Yunos and defender Ahmad Fairuz Yunus put the smile
back on Vest.
	   Shamsurin Abdul Rahman did not impress in the last match and
Vest is keeping his fingers crossed that of all players, Edwards
can turn out to be the out-and-out striker that his team did not
have all these matches.
	   ``There is light at the end of the tunnel with several players
like Alistair (Edwards), Nazri (Yunus), Dave (Evans) starting to
train. They should be ready in the next few weeks,'' said Vest.
	   ``Even with so many players down with injuries throughout the
season, nobody had hammered us by more than three goals. Can you
imagine even for a team like Pahang with nine of their regulars
out?
	   ``We hang in there and even though we lost to several top teams
by the odd goals.
	   ``We had a `patched-up' team playing on sheer guts to carry them
through the whole season.
	   ``Even against Selangor in the FA Cup, what do you expect from
us with two players like Shamsurin (Abdul Rahman) and Billy (Bone)
who had not seen action for months,'' said Vest.
	   Now that their FA Cup campaign is ended and with the Premier One
title looking a distant dream, Vest will be concentrating on
getting his men prepared for the tilt at the Malaysia Cup, a
realistic target.

	   THE ringgit closed slightly higher against the US dollar
yesterday to close at 3.9480/998 from 3.9750/985 on Wednesday due
to profit-taking on the grenback by Hong Kong funds, dealers said.
	   They said the local unit continued to move in tandem with the
yen, which hovered within the 4.02/4.04 levels to the greenback in
early Tokyo trade but reversed its trend thereafter on
dollar-selling activities. At 9.00 am, the ringgit was lower at
4.0300/040 against the US dollar.
	   The ringgit was also stronger against the Singapore dollar at
2.2844/292 from 2.3010/308 at Wednesday's close and higher against
the Japanese Yen at 2.7885/825 from 2.8222/830.

Husband of Brazilian woman accused of breaking custody, forgery
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ A Lebanese man who took his children from
his estranged wife in Brazil was accused by a prosecutor Friday of
breaking child custody and forgery.
	   Prosecutor Joseph Khalil ordered that Atef Abbas, 38, be kept in
detention for ``the crime of breaking child custody and forging a
permit allowing their travel.''
	   Abbas, who was detained early this month while under
investigation, could be jailed for up to three years if convicted.
	   He has been locked in a bitter custody battle with his estranged
Brazilian wife, Vagna Bandeira, who came to Lebanon on May 9 and
went on a hunger strike in the Brazilian Embassy after failing to
persuade the authorities to return her two sons, who are living
with their father in eastern Lebanon.
	   Bandeira, 35, broke the strike after two weeks and filed a suit
against her husband in the courts. She has returned to Brazil.
	   Abbas is wanted in Brazil for taking his sons while they were in
Bandeira's legal custody and bringing them to Lebanon. He is
alleged to have forged his wife's signature on a travel permit for
the boys, Hamze, 4, and Bilal, 2.
	   Abbas has denied the Brazilian accusations.
	   The couple separated in April 1997 in Brazil and the children
lived with their mother until Abbas brought them to Lebanon.
	   Friday's decision turned the case over to an investigating
magistrate, who will either formally charge Abbas or dismiss the
accusations.
	   The prosecutor's order placed him under arrest until trial, bond
or dismissal of the case.

	   FORMING a committee to analyse the national hockey team's dismal
performance at the World Cup in Utrecht, Holland, which ended early
this month, was indeed a wise move by the Malaysian Hockey
Federation (MHF).
	   However, not all the individuals selected to serve in this
committee may be the right choice.
	   No doubt all of them come with impressive credentials but how
many have been directly involved in hockey in recent times and,
more importantly, how many of them really have the time.
	   The committee members are R. Yogeswaran, Ho Koh Chye, M.P.
Haridass, Poon Fook Loke and National Sports Council director
general Datuk Mazlan Ahmad.
	   Ho was a talented player and capable coach. But that was all
before 1978 while Yogeswaran's last assignment as the national
coach was 16 years ago.
	   Haridass coached the national women's team a long time ago and
has not been actively involved in hockey since then.
	   All these people are now busy with their own career and it has
nothing to do with hockey.
	   So, will they have the time to analyse the national team's
performance, an exercise which obviously cannot be done within a
day or two if a realistic conclusion is to be reached.
	   Furthermore the game itself has changed drastically since their
days.
	   Can they use their experience of playing or coaching on grass to
analyse a match currently being played on synthetic pitch, and that
too with so many changes to the rules.
	   And they are supposed to present their recommendation to Paul
Lissek, one of the world's best coaches. Lissek will be in charge
of the national team for the next three months for the Commonwealth
Games.
	   Lissek arrives in Kuala Lumpur today.
	   Ho is the sports advisor to the Johor State Govenment, Haridass
is with the Olympic Council of Malaysia, and Yogeswaran works for a
bank.
	   Poon still plays hockey and looks a suitable choice.
	   Another question is the appointment of Yogeswaran as the team
manager to replace S. Kali Kavandan.
	   Yogeswaran is already the 2001 Junior World Cup team manager and
he also has a health problem.
	   Managing the national team is no easy task and whether
Yogeswaran can take the strenuous task is left to be seen.
	   We have to bear in mind that the team are already preparing for
the Commonwealth Games in September and Asian Games in December.
	   It was learnt that competitions committee chairman Thasleem
Ibrahim was earlier proposed for the job but the coaching committee
decided against him.
	   They apparently wanted a man with some coaching knowledge to
manage the national team and counter proposed Yogeswaran.
	   They have not learnt that a manager who has coaching experience
may unwittingly interfere with the coach's job like what happened
during the 1996 Asian Junior championship in Singapore.
	   There was some misunderstanding between team manager V.
Sivapathasundram and coach Stephen van Huizen. Sivapathasundram
was, at that time, coaching in Negri Sembilan.
	   Finally Sivapathasundram had to resign to give van Huizen a free
hand with the team.

	   THREE-month Klibor futures on the Malaysia Monetary Exchange
(MME) finished sharply lower yesterday in listless trading with
investors taking new short positions in the forward months, dealers
said.
	   Mr Chris Podbury of KAF Apex Futures Sdn Bhd said the declining
trend was seen from the opening session up to the close as sellers
dominated the market. ``However, we expect the three-month Klibor
futures to continue to trade sideways to higher in near term,'' he
added.

	   Authorities in this country showed a stubborn reluctance to
recognize workers' rights right up until President B.J. Habibie
signed up to the International Labor Organization (ILO) convention
on June 5. The convention guarantees workers the freedom to
organize.
	   Under Soeharto, the authorities cut back workers rights and the
police clamped down heavily on underground unions and any signs of
labor unrest. This policy seems to have been spurred by the ghost
of the communist labor union, which haunted former president
Sukarno's government right up until the Indonesian Communist Party
was banned in 1965. Left-wing unions were so strong and so
well-organized that they were able to disrupt many important social
and economic activities and mentally terrorize anti-Communist
groups.
	   However, the subsequent emasculation of workers' activities was
lamented as a national disaster, not only by many people at home,
but also by democratic countries around the world. Under the
clampdown on unions authorities curtailed the workers' right to
strike, a ban which lasted right up until five years ago. The
lengthy absence of this basic freedom from the country's labor
relations perhaps goes some way toward explaining why today's
minimum monthly wage in the Jakarta area stands at a meager Rp
172,000 (US$13), far too small to provide for even the most basic
of basic needs.
	   To compound the difficulties faced by workers, certain agencies
with no responsibility for labor relations saw to it that they
became involved in every labor dispute, and often used force and
aggression to do so. In circumstances such as these, Marsinah, a
female labor activist, was mysteriously tortured and murdered in
East Java in 1993, in a case which attracted worldwide attention.
Police had forgotten about this case until last week, when the
reform movement vociferously reminded them of their duty to track
down those involved in the murder.
	   Workers' conditions did not even improve in the final years of
Soeharto's government after the Cold War had come to an end and the
specter of communism was no longer a threat. They continued to be
denied the right to set up their own unions, and the
government-backed All-Indonesia Workers Union Federation (FSPSI)
did nothing to defend their interests, indeed employers
representatives often formed the leadership of that ineffectual
organization.
	   In April 1992 a group of activists set up the independent
Indonesian Prosperous Labor Union (SBSI). It was banned by the
government two years later and many of its active members,
including chairman Muchtar Pakpahan, were persecuted. Pakpahan was
later jailed by a kangaroo court. He was released last week.
	   Workers are always the first and worst casualties in any social
or economic crisis. The hardship which they suffer is comparable
only to that of peasant farmers, who are at the mercy of those in
the government who set the price for their crops.
	   However, for those who wish to see an improvement in the lot of
this country's workers there is cause for optimism. President B.J.
Habibie has signed up to the ILO convention on workers' rights to
organize, and the House of Representatives will shortly debate,
with a view to ratifying, conventions on migrant workers,
discrimination in employment, and minimum wages. These will all
help to return basic rights to our workers and strengthen their
bargaining position, an essential move given that over 50 percent
of our 90 million workforce is now underemployed.
	   Providing workers with a better deal will improve our image
abroad -- an image that has frequently been tarnished by the
mistreatment of workers, both in the country and overseas. In the
words of Minister of Manpower Fahmi Idris: ``Up until now we have
been regarded as a country which does not support the protection of
human rights and fails to give freedom to our workers.''

	   JAKARTA (JP): An executive of PT Catur Swasakti Utama, a
subsidiary of the widely diversified Bakrie group, admitted
yesterday that his firm had failed to meet requirements in a land
exchange deal with the city.
	   Company director Max B. Lani told city councilors that the
company, which developed Taman Rasuna Apartments in Kuningan, South
Jakarta, had experienced problems due to the prolonged economic
crisis and a management reshuffle last year.
	   ``I apologize for what we have done. We are facing many
difficulties fulfilling the deal due to a management reshuffle last
December and the current crisis,'' he told members of Commission E
for social welfare at the firm's project site.
	   Under the deal, the company was to develop the apartment project
on a 49-hectare plot of land in 1994 after removing two elementary
school buildings and a nursing home.
	   The company was then required to provide the city with a new
5,322-square-meter plot of land, build another nursing home on a
10,000-square-meter plot and build the two elementary school
buildings on a 2,128-square-meter plot in Pasar Rebo, East Jakarta.
	   The apartment project consists of two complexes with a total of
27 towers. Prices range from Rp 125 million to Rp 900 million for
each unit. The first complex of 16 towers and 3,850 units was
completed early last year.
	   Max promised that the schools and the nursing home would be
built next October as soon as the company finished processing the
required documents.
	   The councilors and the company's representatives also agreed to
arrange a formal meeting to further discuss the matter.
	   Councilor Agus Waluyo, however, told reporters that he could not
accept the company's explanation.
	   ``The reasons are illogical because most of the apartments had
already been sold before the crisis and the management reshuffle
was their internal problem and had no relation to the deal at
all,'' he said.
	   However, Agus said he would not pursue the matter too far since
the company had promised to build the schools and the nursing home.
	   Agus said that if the company failed to meet the requirement
again, the council would ask the city administration to file a
lawsuit.

	   IPOH, Thurs. - Authorities at the district level have been urged
to take immediate action to be in line with the Government's
decision to do away with the ``umbrella concept'' in awarding minor
contracts.
	   Umno Youth leader Datuk Ahmad Zahid Hamidi said today the
movement had proof of abuse of the concept by selected credible and
established contractors and it was timely that the concept be
abolished.
	   He said most big-time contractors who were supposed to
distribute work to smaller contractors awarded projects only to
Class F contractors linked to them.
	   As a result, many contractors faced hardship and would wind up
if the concept continued to be practised.
	   Ahmad Zahid was speaking after the launching of the State-level
Bank Simpanan Nasional Employees Savings Scheme by Menteri Besar
Tan Sri Ramli Ngah Talib.
	   He said the credible and established contractors were also not
transparent in awarding jobs.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim today announced
the Government's decision to stop allocating new minor contracts
under the umbrella concept and would instead revert to the old
system of awarding work directly.
	   The decision followed numerous complaints from small-time
contractors who were unhappy over the distribution of contract
jobs, particularly for rural projects.
	   Under the concept, each State has a credible and established
contractor handling Government contracts worth up to RM15 million
and it is supposed to distribute jobs to the smaller contractors.

Yugoslavia talks tough to NATO; Montenegro takes different stand

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ If NATO intervenes in secessionist
Kosovo, the Yugoslav army would treat the alliance as an intruder
and ``defend the territory ... with all means available,'' a top
aide to President Slobodan Milosevic said Friday.
	   Zoran Lilic, a close Milosevic aide who was Yugoslavia's
president until last year and is now a deputy premier, told The
Associated Press he hoped there would never be a clash between NATO
and Yugoslavia.
	   He made clear that Serbia, which with Montenegro makes up
Yugoslavia, does not regard Kosovo's violence as an all-out war
with dangerous regional consequences.
	   Washington, he said, should get Albanian militants to cease
fire, adding that action by government forces would then
automatically cease.
	   ``We know that in a clash with NATO _ it's stupid even to think
about that _ we don't stand a chance,'' Lilic said. ``But it is its
(Yugoslav army's) duty to defend the territory against anybody who
tries to enter by force.''
	   ``We would have to defend the territory ... with all means
available for as long as we could,'' he said.
	   Serbia's southern province of Kosovo has been on the verge of
all-out war that could spread to neighboring countries. Ethnic
Albanians, who outnumber Serbs about nine to one in Kosovo, want
independence and are increasingly prepared to fight for it.
	   More than 250 people have died in clashes since government
forces in March began a crackdown on Albanian militants, known as
the Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   Lilic said fighting occurred only in some parts of Kosovo and
it's not an all-out Serb-Albanian war, just a clash ``between
security forces and the terrorists.''
	   ``The United States can play a key role if they exert pressure
on Albanians to cease terrorist actions _ which would mean an
automatic halt of actions by the police,'' Lilic said.
	   In 1989, trying to quash Albanians' push for independence and
claiming to protect the Kosovo Serb cause he had espoused to gain
power, Milosevic revoked the province's broad autonomy.
	   But nine years of heavy-handed Serbian rule, enforced with a
strong police and army presence, have only fanned demands for
independence. The peaceful course pursued by ethnic Albanian
political leaders is losing ground to KLA militancy.
	   Kosovo's Albanians, protesting Serbia's rule, have boycotted all
Serbian elections since 1990, and founded alternative schools and
hospitals since being sacked or quitting most state jobs that year.
	   Lilic called on ethnic Albanians to use the rights they still
have and thus win local elections and return to Serbia's
parliament, where they can easily win at least 30 of the 250 seats.
	   Lilic denied government forces use brutality against Albanian
civilians. Foreign diplomats allowed into the region of the most
recent severe fighting in western Kosovo saw scenes of devastation
reminiscent of Bosnia, with houses burned and shelled.
	   Claiming the KLA are ``actually Muslim fundamentalists'', Lilic
reiterated Yugoslav accusations against neighboring Albania,
accusing it of training and arming the rebels.
	   ``The issue is not independent Kosovo. It's about expansion of
Albania,'' he said.
	   Also Friday, the president of Montenegro, Serbia's only
remaining partner in the Yugoslav federation, indicated he might
withdraw recruits from his republic from the army if it became
implicated in atrocities.
	   Montenegrin President Milo Djukanovic, who is at odds with
Milosevic, told reporters in his capital, Podgorica that the
Yugoslav army ``must carry out its constitutional function, to
protect ... Yugoslavia's border.''
	   But if the army gets drawn into conflicts between the KLA and
the Serbian police, ``that would be a warning sign for me'' to hold
urgent meetings ``in order for us to reach decisions, on the basis
of knowledge, regarding the participation of recruits from
Montenegro in the Yugoslav Army,'' Djukanovic added.
	   A letter from a Yugoslav army soldier published in the Belgrade
independent daily Glas last week said the army was giving police
logistic support such as heavy guns, and had plans to help raze
suspected KLA hideouts and villages.
	   Striking a different note than Lilic, Djukanovic said that if
NATO intervened in Kosovo, and bombs fall ``on the innocent
population, on our innocent brethren in Yugoslav army uniforms,
then it would not be bombs dropped by NATO but by those _ on both
sides _ who have decided, instead of negotiations, to again lead
peoples against one another.''

	   KOTA KINABALU, Thurs. - The 20 Umno divisions in Sabah have been
directed to streamline and reactivate their election machinery,
including determining the status of party members.
	   State Umno leaders will be visiting the respective divisions to
ensure that the party machinery, especially election operation
centres, are in place.
	   ``We must make sure that the party is fully prepared to face the
State election,'' Datuk Osu Sukam told a Press conference after
chairing the State Umno liaison committee meeting last night.
	   Except for Tawau Umno division chief, Datuk Abdul Ghapur Salleh,
who had recently declined to be re-appointed Deputy Chief Minister
and Finance Minister, all party divisional heads were present.
	   Sabah Umno Youth chief, Jema Khan Datuk Majid, and State Umno
Wanita head, Senator Datuk Norjan Khan Bahadar, also attended the
meeting.
	   ``Discussion at the meeting was mainly focused on preparations
for the State election which is expected to be held soon,'' Osu
said.
	   He added that the respective Umno bureaus had been asked to
conduct relevant courses for leaders and members at branch levels.
	   Osu, who replaced Ghapur as Deputy Chief Minister and Finance
Minister, said Umno division leaders had been directed to work
closely with leaders of Barisan Nasional component parties in their
respective divisions.
	   He said a close working relationship among BN component parties
at all levels was vital to ensure the BN's victory in the State
election.
	   Also discussed at the meeting was the squatter problem.
	   Osu said Sabah Umno viewed the problem seriously and hoped that
a solution could be found.
	   ``All Umno divisions in the State have been directed to gather
information on the problem to compile a report to be submitted to
the State Government for action,'' he said.
	   The number of squatters and the total area occupied by them were
among the data needed to ensure speedy solution to the problem.
	   He said the customary rights of locals who had settled in
Government land for the last 12 years needed to be considered in
solving the matter.

	   JAKARTA (JP): More than 100 customers of Bank Internasional
Indonesia (BII) protested yesterday an increase in their home loan
interest rate, while separately more than 200 people insisted a
developer return their down payments.
	   The customers of the privately owned BII, demonstrating at the
bank's head office on Jl. MH. Thamrin in Central Jakarta, urged the
bank to lower the interest rate for its home loan scheme.
	   Benny Kusbini, the spokesman for the protesters, said the
interest rate had been raised to between 50 percent and 70 percent
per annum from between 17 percent and 20 percent at the time they
signed their contracts early last year.
	   ``How could we afford to pay the monthly fees with such a high
interest rate? None of us could do that,'' Benny said, claiming
that 500 customers supported the demonstration.
	   Earlier this year, BII hiked the rate to 30 percent, which also
sparked anger from the customers.
	   According to Benny, the customers have protested the bank
several times as it had often hiked its interest rates before the
other banks did.
	   ``We have also learned BII's interest rate is the highest among
the banks in the country,'' he said.
	   According to the bank's managing director, Dody Susanto, the
increase was basically in line with the current interest rates
imposed by Bank Indonesia, the central bank.
	   But he promised customers to review the interest rate, saying
that a decision would be announced next week.
	   ``At the moment, customers are allowed to pay the monthly fee in
line with their first installment,'' he said.
	   Separately, more than 200 customers of Kota Tenjo housing
complex in Bogor regency urged developer PT Prasetia Pertiwi, a
subsidiary of Bank Harapan Sentosa (BHS) Group, to immediately
return their down payments unless it was able to continue the
construction.
	   The customers' spokesman, Jhonny, said the developer had
collected at least Rp 10 billion (US$750,000) from its 4,000
customers, who have each paid a down payment of Rp 3 million each.
	   ``We urged the group's commissioners, Hendra Rahardja and
Sudwikatmono, to return our money. We think the amount is trivial
for wealthy businessmen like them,'' Jhonny said.
	   The customers, accompanied by lawyer Sri Muliani from the
Jakarta Legal Aid Institute, visited the Ministry of Public Housing
and Settlements yesterday.
	   Minister Theo L. Sambuaga promised to help the customers, saying
he would send a letter to the developer soon.
	   The developer's lawyer, Abas Ma'un, who was present at the
meeting, said he could not decide the matter and would report it to
his client.

	   KUMPULAN Guthrie Bhd has raised US$500 million (US$1  &QC;  RM4.00)
for its Guthrie-Koll Fund and is now waiting for the right time to
enter the Malaysian property market.
	   The money was raised from various investment groups in the US,
chairman Tan Sri Abdul Khalid Ibrahim said yesterday.
	   ``We are waiting for the property and the currency markets to
stabilise,'' he said.
	   The US$500 million property investment fund, a result of the
collaboration with US-based Koll Real Estate Group Inc, will be
jointly managed by both parties.
	   The group had been on a roadshow in the US to woo major
insurance companies and pension funds to put their money in the
fund to buy properties in the country which would be leased to US
companies operating here.
	   The properties that the fund would most likely focus on would be
properties or real estate which are in need of financial
assistance.
	   Khalid told reporters this after Guthrie Ropel Bhd's annual
general meeting in Kuala Lumpur yesterday. Kumpulan Guthrie has a
58.35 per cent share in Guthrie Ropel.
	   The company, an oil palm and rubber producer, he said, would see
an improved performance this year as the company had seen higher
oil palm production and also better prices.
	   He also said the exchange rate fluctuations have had no impact
on rubber prices as opposed to palm oil prices which improve in
relation to the depreciation of the ringgit.
	   According to Khalid, due to the current depressed property
market, the company ``will be unlikely to invest in the property
sector in 1998,'' he said, adding that the company will concentrate
on oil palm and rubber production.
	   At the end of 1997, a total of 626.53ha has been earmarked for
property development.
	   Meanwhile, Khalid also said that Malaysia should opt out of the
International Natural Rubber Organisation (Inro) as the
organisation is only benefitting the consumer countries.
	   Independent of an organisation that is trying to control rubber
prices that will only be to the advantage of the non-producing
countries, he said.
	   Since Malaysia is both a producer and user of rubber, it is not
necessary to protect only the users or rubber consuming countries,
he said. ``It is in the best interest to allow rubber prices to
find its own level,'' said Khalid.
	   This, he said, would be a good thing as ``rubber producers can
find the genuine level of rubber prices and determine whether they
want to continue producing rubber''.
	   Primary Industries Minister Datuk Seri Dr Lim Keng Yaik had said
that Malaysia will immediately pull out of Inro if Thailand
withdraws from the organisation.
	   Malaysia, he said, shared Thailand's frustration over Inro's
inability to support natural rubber prices at a fair and equitable
level.
	   Khalid also said that, ``... if the prices of rubber are
dependent on supply and demand, chances are that they can get to a
level when prices reflect the currency situation''.
	   Current rubber prices did not reflect the depreciation of the
ringgit, he said.
	   Although the three major natural rubber producing countries -
Indonesia, Thailand and Malaysia - had faced significant currency
depreciation, natural rubber prices were in fact cheaper in terms
of the US dollar and European currencies now than a year ago.

	   SPORTS associations are required to name their athletes for the
Kuala Lumpur Commonwealth Games by the end of this month.
	   Sports Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin said yesterday in Kuala
Lumpur he expects the respective selection committees to impose
objective minimum qualification requirements in their selection
process.
	   ``We want only the best of the best. The selectors should base
their decision on the athletes' performance, consistency and past
achievements, keeping in mind the country's interest,'' said
Muhyiddin after handing out the National Sports Council cash awards
to national shooters, taekwondo exponents and shuttlers.
	   ``However, Malaysia will not be represented in all 213 events
especially in events such as weighlifting, boxing and athletics.
	   ``And we may not be competing on the same level as some of the
other countries in some of these events, but are only participating
for the exposure.''
	   Muhyidin also said he hopes that the national sports development
project will continue after 1998.
	   ``There will be about 300 Games athletes at the final stage of
preparation. And it would be a waste if the programme does not
survive after the Games.
	   ``I am confident the associations will utilise their allocated
budgets wisely despite the current economic slowdown.
	   ``We managed to cut our budget, spending RM129 million for the
past four years (under the Jaya'98 project) to prepare the athletes
although the budget was RM160 million.
	   ``The Jaya'98 project has indeed given some very positive
results as was seen in sports like bowling, shooting and
gymnastics.
	   ``This effort must continue for at least another eight years to
reap the benefits as it would be a waste to set it aside after the
Games.''
	   According to Muhyiddin, the Cabinet had agreed to continue with
the sports development fund which is supported by contributions
from the private sector.
	   ``I understand that the Finance Ministry are looking into this
matter.''
	   The members of the Thomas Cup team, who finished second to
Indonesia at the recent Finals in Hong Kong, received RM8,000 each
while the BA of Malaysia were given RM12,000.
	   The Thomas Cup shuttlers are Cheah Soon Kit, Ong Ewe Hock,
Roslin Hashim, Yong Hock Kin, Yap Kim Hock, Wong Choong Hann, Lee
Wan Wah, Choong Tan Fook and Tan Kim Her.
	   The shooters who did well at the 22nd Seasa Championships in
Manila in February received a total of RM3,900.
	   Double gold medallist Jasni Shaari got RM2,000 while Mutalib
Razak and Sabki Mohamed Din received RM500 each.
	   Taekwondo exponents Lee Wan Yuen and S. Saravanan got RM3,000
each for the bronze medal they won at the Asian Taekwondo
Championships in Vietnam last month. Their association received
RM1,800.

	   RED Box (Malaysia) Bhd is considering taking legal action
against Malayan Banking Bhd (Maybank), which it claims has violated
a court order restraining the bank from taking any winding up
proceedings against the company.
	   In a statement to the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange, Red Box said
Maybank had advertised a winding up petition against the company on
June 10, despite an ex-parte court order restraining the bank from
taking any such proceedings on June 8, pending hearing of the inter
parte application on the same matter scheduled for next Friday.
	   The court order was served on Messrs David Chong and Co in Johor
Baru, the solicitors acting for Maybank, on June 8.
	   ``Due to the adverse effect of the advertisement, the company is
considering pursuing legally the matter of violation of the court
order by Maybank,'' said Red Box.
	   On April 13, a winding up petition was filed by Maybank in the
Johor Baru High Court, claiming that Red Box was unable to repay
borrowings of some RM8.4 million.
	   As a result, Maybank had decided to terminate all its credit
facilities to the company.
	   However, Red Box said it had not defaulted on any payment and
had been prompt in repaying bank borrowings and interest until the
bank recalled all its credit facilities.
	   The company also said it had proposed various debt restructuring
and securitisation plans to Maybank, and was able to meet most of
the bank's terms and conditions.
	   Meanwhile, the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange announced in a
separate statement that Red Box shares have been suspended with
effect from June 10.
	   It was last traded at 40.5 sen, up 0.5 sen.

	   THE national artistic gymnasts will take part in three
tournaments before the squad for the Kuala Lumpur Commonwealth
Games is finalised.
	   Games chef-de-mission Datuk Khalid Yunus, who visited the Jaya
'98 trainees at the National Sports Complex in Bukit Jalil
yesterday, said: ``Right now there are seven boys and six girls in
training, of which five boys and four girls will be selected.
	   The gymnasts train daily at the National Sports Complex and
according to Khalid, they will do well at the Games.
	   ``I have been told that we have a good chance of a laudable
finish. Our athletes will surely mount a strong challenge in
September.''

the Olympian award. She is the country's best hope.
	   Meanwhile, the National Sports Council and Malaysian Gymnastics
Federation (MGF) have been told to use their wisdom to pick the
best three rhythmic gymnasts.
	   ``They should make full use of their expertise to ensure only
the best among the existing trainees are selected,'' said Sports
Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin.
	   The selection criteria should include the gymnasts' performances
in training and competition, he said when presenting cash
incentives to national shuttlers, taekwondo exponents and shooters
at the National Sports Council.
	   Muhyiddin said the gymnasts' mental strength should also be
considered as this was an important factor in competition.

Handziski is defense minister. &QL;

	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Albania said Friday it will offer NATO
airspace and airports for maneuvers in the country aimed at
deterring further violence in Serbia's adjoining secessionist
province of Kosovo.
	   But neighboring Macedonia, whose prime minister visits Albania
this weekend, delayed, summoning its government into late-night
session and saying it would not allow its territory to be used for
military activity against any neighboring country.
	   Macedonia's Defense Minister Blagoj Handziski announced this
when asked by reporters about NATO plans _ announced Thursday _ for
simulated air raids in Albania and Macedonia to deter further
violence in Kosovo.
	   Yugoslavia _ consisting of Serbia and Montenegro _ adjoins
Macedonia.
	   ``At this point, we can say that if the contents and goals of
the exercise serve to improve the security and stability of the
country....then we shall consider the possibility of agreeing,''
Handziski said.
	   Macedonia's government met late into the night, and parliament
may convene over the weekend to debate the NATO maneuvers, sources
in Macedonia's capital Skopje said.
	   Albania's Prime Minister Fatos Nano, who has lobbied for weeks
for NATO intervention to stop Kosovo violence spiraling out of
control and engulfing the region, announced after a Cabinet meeting
that Albania would offer NATO air space and airfields.
	   ``We are convinced that the crisis in Kosovo is not only a
problem for Albania,'' Nano said. Macedonia ``is also interested in
regional stability ... and I hope that they will not try to keep
their country artificially out of the crisis when the crisis is at
its door.''
	   Macedonia's dominant Slavs have strong ties to the Serbs, but it
also has a sizeable ethnic Albanian majority in its western
territory adjoining Kosovo and Albania proper.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Thurs. - Adding to the assistance offered earlier
by individual British universities, the British Government has
initiated a STG3 million (RM19.5 million) scholarship scheme for
Malaysian students.
	   This is part of a STG6.6 million fund set up to help Asian
students affected by the economic downturn, namely from Malaysia,
Thailand, Indonesia and South Korea.
	   British High Commissioner to Malaysia David Moss said today the
core funding came from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, with
additional funds from the British Council which will co-ordinate
the scheme, Department of Trade and Industry in London, and British
companies.
	   Matching funds were also provided by participating British
universities.
	   The companies include Standard Chartered, Hong Kong and Shanghai
Banking Corporation, ICI, British Gas International, Unilever,
Rolls-Royce, British Airways, Reuter Foundation, BP, Coopers &AMP;
Lybrand and Price Waterhouse.
	   Moss said 1,583 Malaysian students will benefit from this
one-off assistance of STG1,600 for undergraduates and up to
STG2,000 for postgraduate students.
	   The scholarships will go towards tuition fees to enable students
to begin or continue their studies in the 1998/99 academic year
which begins in September.
	   ``With the fall in the value of the ringgit, there has been
growing concern about the financial hardships faced by Malaysian
students in the United Kingdom,'' he said at a Press conference to
announce the details of the British-Malaysia Scholarship Scheme
1998.
	   Moss said this scheme was in addition to the 72 Chevening
scholarships offered to Malaysian students by the British High
Commission each year.
	   There are about 18,000 Malaysian students in Britain. British
universities which earn about STG300 million a year from Southeast
Asian students, are expecting a substantial drop in their enrolment
this year.
	   It was reported earlier that applications from Malaysian
students this year had dropped by 36 per cent.
	   Moss said Britain attached a great deal of importance to
Malaysian students continuing to study in Britain.
	   As there are no official application forms, students should
write to their respective universities which will then select the
names to be put forward, based on merit.
	   Malaysian students holding British Government scholarships will
be not eligible.
	   However, while it was not specifically stated that Malaysians
holding scholarships which are not from the British Government were
also excluded, this factor will be considered in the selection
process.
	   Moss said ``practically all British universities'' have
introduced measures to help Malaysian students, taking the form of
scholarships, ``fees only'' awards, fee grants or discounts,
deferred payment schemes and fees set at a fixed rate in ringgit.

	   MORE foreigners are expected at this year's Sultan Mahmud Bridge
international run in Kuala Terengganu on Aug 9.

World powers take action against India, Pakistan and Yugoslavia

	   LONDON (AP) _ Tackling two global hotspots, the world's leading
industrial nations on Friday blocked new loans to India and
Pakistan in retaliation for their nuclear tests and imposed fresh
sanctions on Yugoslavia to protest a wave of ethnic cleansing in
Kosovo.
	   Acting on a U.S. proposal, foreign ministers from eight key
nations agreed to postpone all loans to India and Pakistan except
those to meet ``basic human needs.'' India has already seen more
than dlrs 1 billion in loans delayed since its nuclear tests last
month.
	   A communique approved by the eight countries _ the United
States, Britain, France, Germany, Japan, Canada, Italy and Russia _
urged India and Pakistan to halt further tests, refrain from
building nuclear weapons, and resume a dialogue ``without delay''
to address the root causes of tensions in the region.
	   With a view to reducing tensions, it urged both countries to
avoid threatening military movements, discourage terrorist activity
and develop new confidence-building measures.
	   ``Our meeting sends the message that the world community is
united not just in outrage and dismay but in action,'' U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said. ``Today, the eight
spoke with one voice.''
	   To add moral pressure, foreign ministers from Argentina, Brazil,
South Africa and Ukraine, all of whom have given up the nuclear
option, joined the others at a lunch. So did the ambassadors of
China and the Philippines, representing the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations.
	   The ministers agreed to set up a task force with the four
nations that have eschewed nuclear weapons to help get India and
Pakistan on the same path.
	   While the Group of Eight called the London meeting to discuss
the South Asian nuclear crisis, the ministers also discussed the
Yugoslav offensive against ethnic Albanians, who account for nearly
90 percent of the population in Kosovo.
	   Calling the crackdown ``the worst violence'' in the Balkans
since Bosnia, British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook announced that
the U.N. war crimes tribunal would be extended to cover war crimes
in Kosovo.
	   The United States, Britain, Germany, France, Italy and Canada
have already banned new investment in Serbia and ordered a freeze
on funds held abroad by the Yugoslav and Serbian governments.
	   They announced Friday that they would move to ban flights of
commercial Yugoslav airlines to and from their countries, a new
sanction strongly welcomed by Albright. This will require action by
the European Union in the case of the four European countries.
	   Japan agreed to consider a flight ban. But Russia, which has
close ties with Yugoslavia, did not support any of the sanctions.
	   All eight nations demanded that Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic call an immediate cease-fire, allow effective
international monitoring, facilitate the return of over 50,000
refugees who have been made homeless, and ``make rapid progress''
in talks with Albanian leaders.
	   ``President Milosevic will be making a grave mistake if he
imagines that the international community will be as slow to
respond in Kosovo as it was in Bosnia,'' Cook said.
	   ``The time available for President Milosevic to respond is
limited,'' Albright warned. ``The escalation of violence in Kosovo
is real and it is unacceptable.''
	   Russian President Boris Yeltsin in Moscow is to meet Milosevic
in Moscow next week and will push for his agreement to the demands,
Cook said.
	   If Milosevic does not respond quickly, the ministers warned of
further measures, ``including those that may require the
authorization of a United Nations Security Council resolution.''
	   Washington does not believe a Security Council resolution is
necessary to autorize NATO military action in Kosovo.
	   ``We believe we have inherent authorization to do what needs to
be done,'' said Albright, echoing Defense Secretary William Cohen's
remarks that ``a resolution may be desirable but is not required.''

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Thurs. - Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar
Ibrahim said today the awarding of government contracts to build
village roads under the umbrella concept has been stopped due to
complaints of unfair distribution.
	   He said the selection of successful contractors would now be
handled by district offices as was the practice before the concept
was introduced by the Treasury last year.
	   ``But contracts already awarded will not be affected. The
directive only involves new ones,'' he said at the presentation of
the Treasury's excellent service awards at the Finance Ministry.
	   Under the umbrella concept, each State has a reputable and
established contractor (normally Class A) handling government
contracts worth up to RM15 million under the Projek Jalan Kampung
of the Rural Development Ministry.
	   The contractor is expected to sub-contract jobs - to build
roads, bridges and related works - to small-time contractors or
Class F contractors under their ``patronage'' who are qualified to
undertake projects worth up to RM100,000.
	   Anwar, who is also Finance Minister, said feedback from State
Governments, district offices and Members of Parliament indicated
that there were problems in the awarding of minor projects under
the concept.
	   ``The programme has its merits but the implementation has drawn
many complaints, especially from small contractors in the
districts, who say they have been left out.''
	   In view of the difficult times now, Anwar said the Government
did not want to appear to be attending only to problems of big
contractors while neglecting the welfare of small-time contractors.
	   Meanwhile, Rural Development Minister Datuk Annuar Musa and
Entrepreneur Development Minister Datuk Mustapa Mohamed said they
believed the complaints of unfair distribution were due to a lack
of understanding of the concept.
	   They were speaking after a visit by Kelantan Umno leaders to the
New Straits Times office Balai Berita.
	   Annuar said the concept was introduced following comments by the
Public Accounts Committee of various weaknesses related to the
awarding of contracts to build rural roads under the open tender
system.
	   ``It is not true that the main contractors can give the job to
any Class F contractors. The selection of contractors is determined
by the Treasury.''
	   Contrary to the claims that the concept benefitted only a small
number of Class F contractors, he said some 700 of them were
expected to secure contracts this year compared to only 400 under
the open tender system.
	   He said the ministry had allocated RM50 million last year and
RM185 million this year under the PJK programme.

	   LTA of Malaysia (LTAM) in a move to liven up the game in the
country, will host the Dato' Munir Cup National Inter-team
championship at Jalan Duta tennis centre in Kuala Lumpur on June
26-28.
	   Shipper's Logistics Management are the main sponsors of the
tournament.
	   They will be come up with RM30,000 and the challenge trophy,
appropriately named after their managing director.
	   ``We are happy to be associated with tennis development in the
country and hope the tournament will help unearth new talents,''
said Munir yesterday.
	   His involvement in tennis has much to do with his wife, Datin
Intan Mahani who is a former national junior champion.
	   She won the junior title in 1986 and went on to play for country
until 1991 but was forced to retire due to a fractured rib.
	   Intan, 28, is also making a return to game and will compete in
the tournament.
	   The tournament is open to State teams, clubs and other
organisations.
	   Each team can field a maximum of eight players.
	   Only one national player is allowed in a team who also have to
register a women player.
	   National players V. Selvam, R. Ramachandran and O. Vasuthevan
have confirmed their participation.
	   The tournament has so far attracted 10 teams and LTAM are
expecting more. Entries close on June 20.

 &UR; World Cup: Michael Laudrup gets roses and a victory in 100th
international &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LENS, France (AP) _ Michael Laudrup got a huge bunch of roses
and a crucial victory Friday as he made his 100th international
appearance for Denmark.
	   The 33-year-old forward was presented with a bouquet to mark his
century of caps before Denmark kicked off its World Cup finals
campaign against Saudi Arabia at the Stade Felix Bollaert stadium.
	   But after the game, which Denmark won 1-0 on a 68th minute Marc
Rieper header, Laudrup was thinking of the team rather than his
personal milestone.
	   ``This was a great team effort,'' said Laudrup, who will end his
playing career at the end of the World Cup. ``We created a lot of
opportunities but still had trouble capitalizing on our chances.''
	   The man who did capitalize paid tribute to Laudrup's glittering
career.
	   ``I think it is very important for a player to reach 100
internationals,'' Rieper said. ``He has been without doubt the best
player Denmark has ever had. He is a wonderful player and hopefully
the team and him together can do something at this World Cup.''
	   Laudrup ended his club career at Ajax Amsterdam where he helped
the Dutch powerhouse to this season's league and cup double.
	   He also had spells with some of the greatest names in European
soccer _ playing for Real Madrid, Barcelona and Juventus among
others.
	   Laudrup was the only player in the current squad to have played
in Denmark's first World Cup finals appearance in 1986.

	   DAKAR, Senegal (AP) _ More than 1,000 foreigners evacuated from
violence-wracked Guinea-Bissau docked in Senegal's capital Friday
after a miserable 24-hour journey on the deck of a Portuguese
merchant ship with little food or water.
	   Two other Senegalese boats carrying more of the 2,200 evacuees
who fled the troubled West African nation were expected to arrive
later Friday or early Saturday.
	   Guinea-Bissau has been wracked with scattered fighting between
government troops and renegade soldiers who launched a coup attempt
on Sunday, prompting an exodus by water and land.
	   The initial evacuees, who numbered more than 1,000, were mainly
Senegalese, but also included a number of American, Canadian,
Portuguese, German, Japanese, French, Brazilian and Cape Verdian
nationals.
	   Emotional reunions occured between some of the boat passengers
and family members and embassy staff who had waited several hours
at the main port.
	   The first person off the ship _ an American woman employed by
the U.S. embassy in the capital, Bissau _ raised her fist in
triumph as she strode down the ramp onto the crowded dock.
	   ``We are hoping that between the Portuguese vessel and later the
Senegalese boat today that we will have the vast majority of
Americans in Guinea-Bissau out,'' said David Wagner, a diplomat
with the U.S. Embassy in Dakar. It was not immediately clear how
many Americans were in Guinea-Bissau.
	   Portuguese and Senegalese soldiers helped entire families off
the boat, including a U.S. missionary, Fred Wieger, and his wife
and two small children.
	   Wieger, of York, Pennsylvania, told a harrowing tale of how his
family had driven fearfully through the streets of Bissau filled
with troops and wounded people _ both soldiers and civilians.
	   ``It was very intense and at times there were mortars that
landed 200 meters from our boat, so we had to hit the deck while we
were waiting for the ship,'' Wieger said. He said he saw wounded on
streets patrolled by soldiers.
	   ``We had to leave when the heavy artillery began and kept going.
Everything intensified,'' he said.
	   In Britain, the Foreign Office urged the 15 Britons believed to
be in Guinea-Bissau to leave. It said its warning was
``cautionary'' and that they were in no immediate danger.

	   JAKARTA (JP): The State Logistics Agency (Bulog) has dismissed
rumors that the country would soon face a rice shortage, saying
that current stocks were sufficient for one year and imports would
continue to flow in.
	   Bulog chairman Beddu Amang said yesterday that Bulog rice stocks
were currently 2.5 million tons, enough to meet domestic demand for
about 12 months.
	   ``We have enough rice for this year. We are continuing to
procure rice and we will import more if our supply is not
adequate,'' Beddu said in a media conference.
	   He said the agency planned to distribute 200,000 tons of rice
each month, 150,000 tons of which would be given to civil servants
and members of the armed forces. The remaining 50,000 tons would be
used for market operations, he added.
	   Rice distributed by Bulog makes up only part of the domestic
supply because not all locally grown rice is sold to the agency.
	   Beddu said last month that the agency's stocks stood at 2.1
million tons, enough to meet domestic demand for only three to four
months.
	   He also said that domestic rice procurement may fall to 250,000
tons this year, the lowest level in 20 years.
	   When asked about the differences between the two announcements
regarding Bulog stocks, Beddu said the previous account was based
on the assumption that Bulog's market operations would require over
200,000 tons of rice per month.
	   ``Our market operation in October 1997 used 260,000 tons of
rice, in November 340,000 tons, in December 445,000 tons, in
January
show a decreasyn'(tsed
in May and 46,000 tons in June,'' Beddu said.
	   Beddu was optimistic that the agency would be able to supply a
sufficient amount of rice throughout the country at a reasonable
price.
	   ``Don't worry, our stocks will increase because we are
continuing to import rice and we are still receiving food aid from
other countries,'' he said.
	   Meanwhile,Sudjarwo, spokesman for state port operator PT Pelindo
II which operates Tanjung Priok port, said that no more rice
shipments were expected until August.
	   ``The last ship carrying imported rice arrived last Friday. It
brought 13,700 tons of rice from Bangkok,'' he said.
	   Beddu, however, promised that imports would continue to flow in.
He added that Japan had pledged to supply 500,000 tons of rice
through a soft loan with a 30-year maturity and a further 100,000
tons as a grant, Taiwan had agreed to sell 200,000 tons, China
250,000 tons, Vietnam 10,000 tons, and Thailand 5,000 tons in the
form of a grant.
	   Beddu also said that from yesterday sugar mills were allowed to
sell their produce directly to the public, adding that Bulog
planned to import raw sugar to help meet domestic demand.
	   He said the raw sugar would be refined in sugar mills in Jakarta
and in mills owned by the state sugar plantation company (PTPN).
	   ``Importing raw sugar is US$100 per ton cheaper than importing
refined sugar. The processing cost is $40 per ton so by importing
raw sugar and processing it ourselves we will be able to sell it at
lower prices,'' Beddu said, adding that refined sugar was sold at
$360 per tons.
	   He said that Indonesia would need to import 1.3 million of sugar
this year if domestic output reached 1.8 million tons. Annual
consumption in the country is a staggering 3.1 million tons.
	   Beddu said the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has agreed that
up to Rp 5.6 trillion could be used to subsidize foodstuffs and
fertilizers, of which Rp 2.7 trillion would be used to import rice
to ensure that supply remained plentiful and prices remained low.
	   ``The subsidy is not being given to help foreign farmers, but to
help consumers,'' he said.

	   PENANG, Thurs. - Penang has recorded a 30 per cent decrease in
the number of industrial accidents over the past four years.
	   A total of 13,337 industrial accidents occurred in 1994, while
last year there were only 9,400 such cases.
	   Chief Minister Tan Sri Dr Koh Tsu Koon today said while the dip
reflected the high level of awareness and commitment among
employers, there was a need for greater commitment, especially from
factories in the State.
	   ``Despite there being 743 factories located in Penang
Development Corporation industrial parks, only 113 have set up
emergency response teams,'' he said when launching the State-level
Health and Industrial Safety Week at the polo ground.
	   ``This figure constitutes not even a quarter of ERTs in Penang's
factories and employers should rectify this situation.''
	   Also present at the event, themed A Safe and Healthy Work
Culture, were Fire and Rescue Services Department director-general
Datuk Dr Soh Chai Hock and State Human Resources Committee chairman
Datuk Dr Kang Chin Seng.
	   In urging more factories to set up ERTs, Koh said the State Fire
and Rescue Services Department was ready to assist factories with
such efforts.
	   ``The challenges being faced by employers as a result of the
economic problems should not be an excuse to compromise the health
and safety of workers.
	   ``Workers are assets whose sacrifices had enabled everyone to
enjoy the good times,'' he said.
	   ``Since they are the ones whose efforts are needed to promote
the nation's economic recovery, we must ensure that their working
conditions are conducive to producing proactive and hardworking
workers,'' he added.

	   JAKARTA (JP): President of the Jakarta Stock Exchange (JSX)
Cyrill D. Noerhadi said yesterday that the 28 public companies
which had yet to submit their annual financial reports for 1997
would face suspension if they did not do so by the end of today.
	   ``We have to be firm against those companies in order to improve
the image of our capital market,'' he told The Jakarta Post.
	   He said that if they ignored the warning, the companies would be
temporaily delisted from the exchange from Monday.
	   Cyrill said that at least 28 companies had yet to submit their
1997 financial reports as of yesterday.
	   According to the capital market's regulations, listed companies
should, at the latest, submit their annual financial reports four
months after the end of their book year, or on April 30, for those
using the calender year in their financial reports.
	   The JSX management has said that at least 40 companies had
missed the April deadline and it had imposed a fine of Rp 10
million (about US$750) on every company concerned.
	   Cyrill said some of them had since filed their financial
reports.
	   The Capital Market Supervisory Agency (Bapepam) also warned this
week that it would impose a penalty on companies which missed the
deadline.
	   Bapepam and the stock exchange operators have different
penalties against these companies. Unlike, the exchange operators,
the agency imposes a penalty of Rp 1 million for each overdue day.
	   Cyrill said yesterday that the JSX management has warned the
tardy firms several times and sent warning letters to each company
warning them not to delay submitting their financial statements.
	   Among the 28 listed companies which have not submitted their
financial reports are PT Argo Pantes, PT Bakrie and Brothers, PT
Bukaka Teknik Utama, PT Duta Anggada Realty, PT Kawasan Industri
Jababeka, PT Ometraco Corporation, PT Putra Surya Multidana, PT
Barito Pacific Timber, Bank Danamon, Bank PDFCI, Bank Surya, Bank
Tiara Asia, Bank Umum Nasional, Bank Dagang Nasional Indonesia
(BDNI) and Modern Bank.
	   The management of Bank Danamon, Bank PDFCI, Bank Tiara Asia,
Bank Umum Nasional, BDNI and Modern Bank have been placed under the
Indonesian Bank Restructuring Agency (IBRA) since April as part of
the government's efforts the improve the country's ailing banking
system.

	   JAKARTA (JP): The government has formed a team to give
recommendations on ways resolve problems faced by state-owned
electricity firm PLN, including those with independent power
producers (IPPs).
	   The team is headed by a deputy to state minister for the
empowerment of state enterprises, Markus Permadi, assisted by the
director of electricity at the Ministry of Mines and Energy, Endro
Utomo Notodisuryo.
	   Markus and Endro told journalists yesterday evening that the
team had four sections covering finance, operation, privatization
and cooperation with private electricity firms.
	   ``We will complete our assessments in two months and give
recommendations on how to settle all those problems, including
those on finance and contracts with IPPs,'' Endro said.
	   PLN president Djiteng Marsudi annulled last week its power
purchase contract with Cikarang Listrindo, an IPP owned by former
president Soeharto's cousin Sudwikatmono.
	   Djiteng's move received wide support from the public, including
several legislators, but was opposed by State Minister for the
Empowerment of State Enterprises Tanri Abeng.

	   ALOR STAR, Thurs. - Yang di-Pertuan Agong Tuanku Ja'afar today
presented diplomas to 48 graduates in aeronautical engineering at
the Royal Malaysian Air Force flight training college in Kepala
Batas.
	   The cadets, including two Bangladeshis, were the first batch to
graduate from the three-year course.
	   They were the only graduates out of 128 who had originally
enrolled for the course in May 1995.
	   It was jointly conducted by the RMAF and Universiti Teknologi
Malaysia.
	   Some of the dropouts opted out of the course while others were
dropped after they failed academically or because of poor
disciplinary records.
	   Among the subjects included in the course were nuclear, chemical
and biological warfare, first aid and military ethics.
	   In his speech, the King called on the RMAF to strive for greater
advancement in the information technology era.
	   He also said there should be no lax in defence related
activities although the country was facing economic problems.
	   Best overall student cadet officer Baharin Mohamad, 21, was
awarded the Sultan Ahmad Shah trophy while cadet officer Khoo Heng
Giap, 26, was adjudged the best academic achiever.
	   The two Bangladeshis who received their diplomas were pilot
officer Mustafa Nazmul Alam and pilot officer Mohammad Manjoor
Elahee.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Thurs. - The High Court today dismissed an
application by MCA president Datuk Seri Dr Ling Liong Sik to review
the costs awarded to him arising from an unsuccessful libel suit by
DAP secretary-general Lim Kit Siang.
	   With the dismissal of the application, the original amount of
costs, RM29,960, to be paid by Lim remains.
	   On May 12 last year, Senior Assistant Registrar Rozielawaty Abd
Ghani had ordered Lim to pay RM29,960 as costs to Dr Ling after
Lim's defamation suit was dismissed by Judicial Commissioner Zainun
Ali on Nov 7, 1996.
	   Dr Ling, who is also the Transport Minister, had asked for costs
totalling RM104,612.50 to be taxed in his favour following the
dismissal of the suit.
	   Lim was represented by Karpal Singh while Joseph Yeo appeared
for Dr Ling.
	   Lim had sued Dr Ling and three others over an alleged statement
concerning the ``Save Bukit China'' fund published in The Star on
Aug 26, 1993.
	   In his statement of claim, Lim had contended that Dr Ling had
falsely and maliciously spoken and caused the newspaper to print
and publish the said article under the heading ``Ling: Guard
against DAP's armchair politics''.
	   Lim had named Dr Ling, The Star's editor, Star Publication (M)
Sdn Bhd and its printer Papyrus Printing Sdn Bhd as defendants.

	   JAKARTA (JP): The International Monetary Fund (IMF) technical
team here to review Indonesia's macroeconomic development is
focusing on the country's budget and monetary policy, IMF Asia
Pacific director Hubert Neiss said yesterday.
	   He added, to the media after meeting the country's economic
ministers, that the other two topics were financial restructuring
and structural reforms.
	   ``I will stay for two to three weeks... That's a normal length
and we want to do a good job,'' he said.
	   He declined to make further comments, pointing out that it would
be irresponsible to make any judgment before the review was
completed.
	   Neiss, who arrived in Jakarta Wednesday afternoon, is here to
review Indonesia's sweeping economic reform programs agreed with
the IMF in April.
	   The review has to be completed before the IMF board of directors
makes its decision on the disbursement of a second US$1 billion
bailout tranche for Indonesia, which was delayed following the
social and political unrest last month.
	   Neiss said on his arrival that the second $1 billion tranche
would be disbursed in July.
	   The IMF has said that the macroeconomic assumptions used in
Indonesia's April budget would have to be revised because the
economic situation has further deteriorated following the recent
political turmoil which scared many businesses and investors.
	   The April budget predicted 1998 economic growth at minus 5
percent, inflation of 45 percent, and an exchange rate of Rp 6,000
to the U.S. dollar at year-end.
	   Economists forecast that this year's economic contraction will
be more than 10 percent and that inflation will surpass 100
percent.
	   The year-end target of Rp 6,000 to the dollar is also considered
unrealistic; yesterday the currency plunged to Rp 15,000.
	   The IMF has championed a high-interest-rates policy to defend
the beleaguered rupiah and curb inflation.
	   ``There will be new calculations,'' Chairman of the National
Development Planning Board (Bappenas) Budiono said yesterday.
	   He said that in addition to the budget, the discussions with the
IMF would also focus on the country's social safety net program to
help ease the burden of low-income people badly hit by the current
crisis.
	   ``I will fight to get more funding for this,'' he said, adding
that structural reform would not be a major topic as the country
had implemented most of the measures demanded.
	   The IMF has a commitment to provide $10 billion, which is part
of a $43 billion bailout the Fund organized. Indonesia has so far
received $4 billion from the IMF.
	   The reform program and the bailout money are expected to help
lift the country from its worst ever economic crisis in three
decades. The meltdown was prompted by the currency crisis which
started in July.

	   JAKARTA (JP): Minister of Forestry and Plantations Muslimin
Nasution said yesterday the use of the reforestation funds to
finance businesses owned by former president Soeharto's family and
cronies was being investigated.
	   He said his office and the Ministry of Finance were working
together to ascertain whether there was malfeasance in the use of
Rp 1.2 trillion (US$90 million) of the reforestation funds prior to
this April.
	   ``During the investigations, I have ordered that further
disbursement of the reforestation funds be frozen,'' Muslimin
added.
	   According to the Letter of Intent with the International
Monetary Fund, the reforestation funds, including their interest,
should be managed within the state budget and be used to develop
forests and rejuvenate critical land.
	   `` We will try our best to reallocate the misused funds to
forest development,'' Muslimin told journalists after a meeting
with environmentalists and non-governmental organizations.
	   The environmentalists and NGO leaders visited the minister
yesterday to raise their concern over the misuse of reforestation
funds mandated by Soeharto.
	   They also demanded that Mohamad ``Bob'' Hasan, a timber tycoon
and close crony of Soeharto, be tried for his misuse of
reforestation funds and other destruction of forest resources.
	   The reforestation fund is a mandatory fee imposed by the
government on forest concessionaires to ensure that forests are
managed in an environmentally sustainable manner. The size of the
fees depends on the volume and type of timber felled.
	   Former president Soeharto, during his tenure in power, issued
several decrees ordering the minister of forestry to allocate
reforestation funds to various projects run by his family members
and cronies which were not related to forest development.
	   In 1996, Soeharto asked the ministry to set aside part of the
interest of the funds mostly deposited in state banks to aid state
aircraft manufacturer PT IPTN, which was then chaired by B.J.
Habibie (who is now the president).
	   According to earlier reports, IPTN received about Rp 400
billion, which was later converted into the government's stake in
the aircraft company.
	   In 1997, according to audited reports issued by the Supreme
Advisory Agency (Bepeka), Soeharto also instructed the Ministry of
Forestry to set aside about Rp 250 billion from the funds to help
PT Kiani Lestari -- a company owned by Hasan for its pulp and paper
factory in East Kalimantan.
	   Urea pill fertilizer manufacturer PT Ario Seto Wijoyo -- a
company owned by Soeharto's grandson Ari Sigit Harjojudanto also
obtained about Rp 80 billion of the fund.
	   Other Soeharto decrees allocated Rp 100 billion of the funds for
poverty alleviation and Rp 23 billion for purchasing the shares of
a private jet development company linked to IPTN.
	   Muslimin, however, said that not all of the funds' allocations
had been disbursed.
	   But he said he did not know whether all the funds given to those
companies had been repaid.
	   Director General of Reforestation and Land Rehabilitation
Harsono said separately that the ministry was preparing a decree to
classify the type of forest development which could use the
reforestation funds.
	   ``The directorate general of reforestation and land
rehabilitation will be very pleased if the funds are given back to
us, because we will need a lot of money to reforest and rejuvenate
critical land,'' Harsono said.

	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ With his forces firing into the air,
unleashing tear gas and briefly detaining a leading dissident,
Nigeria's new military boss sent a clear signal Friday to his
myriad opponents: Muscle still rules this junta-weary country.
	   Opposition activists demanding an end to military rule took to
the streets in a planned mass protest, but they were quickly
confronted by a wall of police and soldiers in Lagos, Nigeria's
commercial hub.
	   Faced with his first major test _ the prospect of defiant
opposition _ Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar responded with enough force
to quell any hopes of a meaningful anti-government demonstration.
	   Police arrested Gani Fawehinmi, a lawyer and leading dissident
who organized the protests, and held him for several hours before
he was released on bail. They also arrested Dupe Abiola, one of the
wives of the imprisoned businessman Moshood Abiola, the presumed
winner of canceled 1993 elections.
	   ``We are very bitter about what has happened,'' said Fawehinmi's
son and aide, Mohammed Fawehinmi.

	   JAKARTA (JP): Domestic demand for cement has sunk by 30 percent
since the beginning of this year due to the deepening economic
crisis, state-run PT Semen Gresik president Urip Timuryono said
yesterday
	   Urip said the crisis was causing the reduction or cancellation
of most construction projects.
	   Semen Gresik's sales this year have also fallen by 20 percent.
	   ``The utilization of our plants is about 70 percent to 75
percent of capacity. If nobody is buying, our factories may
close,'' he said.
	   National cement production capacity will be 35.8 million metric
tons by the end of this year. Some new factories, such as those in
Tuban (East Java) and Cilacap (Central Java), have not started
producing fully.
	   Last year, domestic demand for cement was about 27.9 million
tons.
	   Urip said the total production capacity of Semen Gresik,
including subsidiaries PT Semen Padang in Padang (West Sumatra) and
PT Semen Tonasa in Tonasa (South Sulawesi), would reach 17 million
tons by the end of this year, up from 13 million last year.
	   Semen Gresik currently controls 40 percent of the country's
cement market.
	   The company is trying to increase its exports, which now make up
10 percent to 15 percent of its sales, to at least 25 percent in
the first semester, Urip said.
	   It was trying to break into the United States and African
markets as the rupiah's depreciation made its cement much more
competitive there now, he said.
	   Semen Gresik currently exports its bulk product to neighboring
countries like Singapore, Myanmar, Vietnam, Bangladesh.
	   Urip said cement demand in Southeast Asian countries such as
Thailand, Malaysia and the Philippines was much less than the total
capacity.
	   Semen Gresik booked Rp 232 billion (US$17.3 million) in net
profit last year, up from Rp 219 billion in 1996.
	   Urip said he could not forecast the company's net profit this
year due to the nation's economic uncertainty.

	   JAKARTA (JP): Like other Indonesian radio buffs, Dita used to
have the same listening problem.
	   ``I was listening to a song when suddenly, without warning, came
that darned news broadcast,'' the 23-year-old journalist said.
	   ``Alright fine. I know I am a journalist and (it's) my duty to
listen to news. But 14 times a day? And then, what news? It's
government-regulated.
	   ``This means, no news.''
	   Now, Dita and other millions of listeners nationwide have little
to worry about.
	   On June 6, Minister of Information Muhammad Yunus, who used to
be called Yunus Yosfiah, issued a series of new rulings on press
and radio broadcasting as part of reform of the information sector.
	   Canceling a 1984 ruling enacted by his predecessor Harmoko,
Yunus deregulated radio news broadcasting.
	   This will allow private stations to produce and manage their own
news and cut the number of state-run RRI radio news broadcasts
which they must relay from 14 to three; at 6 a.m., 1 p.m. and 7
p.m.
	   Private radio stations are also permitted to work with foreign
stations without first seeking government permission.
	   There are 38 in Jakarta and more than 700 nationwide.
	   Ramaco is one radio station which is ready to produce its own
news.
	   Station manager Ria Stephanie said that Ramaco replaced the
RRI-broadcasts with in-house news productions from Tuesday, three
days after the deregulation was announced.
	   ``The news was announced June 6... we made immediate revisions
to our in-house news production, Jurnal 30, at a board meeting
Monday at 6:20 a.m.,'' Ria said.
	   In the meeting it was decided to exclude RRI broadcast from
Jurnal 30.
	   ``We went on air with the revisions Tuesday.''
	   ``Our news broadcasts comprise field reports by our own
reporters and those taken from foreign agencies like AFP and Antara
news agency... also from CNN.''
	   The station broadcasts Jurnal 30 at 7 a.m. and updates the news
in its second broadcast at 6 p.m.
	   Currently Ramaco, employing 38 staff, airs live World Cup
broadcasts; a collaboration with PT Indonesian Satellite
Corporation (Indosat) and local sports tabloid Go.
	   The tabloid's contribution includes correspondents reporting
live from France.
	   ``This way we do not take out too much, and we get full
coverage, including the atmosphere before and after a game,'' Ria
said.
	   Ramaco broadcasts consist of 15 percent news, 10 percent
talk-shows and 65 percent music.
	   Trijaya FM director Indirwan Moeffreni said that despite the
belief of news broadcasters and radio stations nationwide that
change was inevitable, the deregulation was a pleasant surprise.
	   ``It's freedom... something we have no intentions of misusing,''
Indirwan quickly added.
	   He added that they were preparing to air in-house news
productions to replace the RRI radio news broadcasts.
	   ``On June 15 it will come in three forms; the six-minute form,
nine-minute form and the bulletin, which is the 14-minute form,''
Indirwan said.
	   ``Other news will include market reports, national, regional,
international, sports and economic reviews.''
	   He added that their 10-person news department, established since
the station's founding in 1990, was already looking for more news
reporters.
	   ``We are looking for five to 10 more,'' he said.
	   Currently there are seven reporters who report live and three
editors-translators in addition to eight broadcasters who broadcast
both music and news.
	   Airing from 6 a.m. to midnight, or sometimes 1 a.m., Trijaya FM
broadcasts 15 percent news, 7 percent talk shows, 16 percent
advertising and the rest music.
	   Kiss FM station manager Denny Salam said the station is planning
to air what he calls ``Newstertainment'', following the station's
sixth birthday on Aug. 16. It will feature national and world news,
packaged and presented in an entertaining way.
	   ``Why? Because we are a 90-percent music station.''

	   KOTA KINABALU, Thurs. - Sabah Umno has forwarded to the Prime
Minister its recommendation on the potential candidates to replace
Datuk Osu Sukam as Land and Co-operative Development Minister.
	   Osu, who is Sabah Umno liaison committee chief, vacated the post
on June 8 to pave the way for his appointment as Sabah Deputy Chief
Minister and Finance Minister.
	   Speaking to reporters after chairing the State Umno liaison
meeting here last night, Osu said appointment to the Federal
Cabinet was the prerogative of Prime Minister Datuk Seri Dr
Mahathir Mohamad.
	   It was reported that the likely candidates for the post were
former Chief Minister Datuk Salleh Tun Said, Deputy Works Minister
Datuk Railey Jeffrey and Information Ministry Parliamentary
Secretary Datuk Shafie Apdal.
	   Dr Mahathir had said on June 5 that the post vacated by Osu
would be filled by a Sabah Umno leader.
	   On the position of Datuk Abdul Ghapur Salleh, who declined to be
re- appointed to the Cabinet of new Chief Minister Tan Sri Bernard
Giluk Dompok, Osu said he was still Sabah Umno deputy chief.
	   Ghapur, who is Tawau Umno division chief and Merotai
Assemblyman, did not attend the State Umno liaison meeting last
night.
	   On the sacking of 11 Umno members from Sabah for joining the
Parti Barisan Rakyat Sabah Bersekutu (Bersekutu), Osu said the
decision was made by the Supreme Council following a report from
Sabah Umno.
	   Those sacked were Datuk Askalani Abdul Rahim, Datuk Dr Zulkipli
Abdul Hamid, Lassim Abdul Rahman, Mohd Dini Khan, Mohd Topik Awang
Ajak, Naim Ahmad, Ahmas Nunsi OKK Mahadi, Uda Sulai, Isnain Amat,
Pengiran Othman Rauf and Datuk Monggoh Orow.

 &UR; Conductor saves girl with kick
	   LAFAYETTE, Indiana (AP) _ The conductor on a slow-moving freight
train spotted a toddler lying on the tracks just ahead, so he
dashed to the grille at the front of the locomotive and kicked her
out of harm's way.
	   ``I just had to try something. It had to be just all
adrenaline,'' conductor Robert Mohr said Wednesday.
	   Nineteen-month-old Emily Marshall was bumped Tuesday by part of
the locomotive, and was hospitalized with just a cut on her head
and a swollen lip. She was released Wednesday.
	   Mohr spotted Emily when she was still about a city block ahead
of the Norfolk Southern train, which was moving at 24 mph (39 kph).
The girl had wandered away from home while her mother planted
flowers in her yard.
	   Engineer Rod Lindley thought it was a dog on the tracks, until
Emily raised her head at the sound of the train's whistle.
	   ``That's a baby!'' Mohr hollered.
	   Lindley hit the brakes and Mohr bolted out the door of the cab,
racing along a ledge to the front of the engine.
	   He said he realized there was no time to jump ahead of the train
and grab the baby, so he went down a set of steps, squatting at the
very bottom and hanging on.
	   As the train neared Emily, slowing to 10 mph, the little girl
rolled off the rail onto the outside of the roadbed but was still
in danger of being hit by the engine.
	   So Mohr stretched one leg out to kick her away.
	   ``I don't even remember going out the door and down the steps,''
Mohr said from his home in Denver, Indiana. ``I don't even remember
the engineer blowing the whistle. Everything was on that baby.''
	   Mohr jumped off the train and ran to the girl.
	   He picked Emily up and cradled her in his arms, and when
paramedics arrived and tried to take her, she clung to Mohr.
	   ``She didn't want me to let loose of her,'' he said.
	   Mohr, 48, who has four children of his own, said he didn't feel
like a hero.
	   ``I did what anybody would have done,'' he said.

	   IPOH, Thurs. - The High Court today acquitted a lorry attendant
charged with the murder of a watchman without calling for his
defence.
	   P. Manimaran, 32, of Jelapang, was charged with the murder of
Mukang Singh, 70, at Hong Soon Chan Hup Kee godown in Jalan Tun
Perak about 10.30pm on Sept 8, last year.
	   Judge Datuk Kang Hwee Gee, in acquitting him, said the only
evidence before the court was that police had recovered a parang at
his house in Jelapang.
	   ``This piece of evidence alone is insufficient to incriminate
him.''
	   Kang said in any criminal trial the prosecution must prove its
case beyond reasonable doubt, failing which the benefit of the
doubt should be given to an accused person.
	   ``It is better for 100 guilty men to go free than to condemn an
innocent man.''
	   Earlier V.T. Singam, for Manimaran, submitted that the
prosecution had failed to make out a prima facie case against his
client.
	   He said there was no evidence to show that he was found at the
scene of the crime on that day.
	   Singam said police arrested another person in connection with
the crime but he was never produced in court.
	   He posed the question whether that suspect was the murderer.
	   Deputy Public Prosecutor Murtazadi Amran said he left it to the
court as the only evidence of a confession by Manimaran was
dismissed in a trial- within-a-trial.
	   ``We have no other evidence after the confession was ruled as
inadmissible,'' he said.

	   JOHOR BARU, Thurs. - The State Government has set up a one-stop
health advice and counselling centre to create awareness on organ
transplants.
	   The Health-Stop, located at the main concourse of the Johor
Tourist Information Centre, is a joint undertaking between the
State Health Department, Women Affairs and Counselling Department,
and Jotic.
	   State Unity, Women Affairs and Social Welfare Committee chairman
Halimah Sadique said the cost of setting up the centre totalled
only RM15,000 as the premises was sponsored by Jotic.
	   ``The staff will promote organ transplants and register those
who are interested in becoming donors. We hope this will correct
the negative views about organ donation and create awareness of its
importance,'' she told reporters after opening the centre
yesterday.
	   The centre is opened daily from 9am to 9pm.

	   KANGAR, Thurs. - The seven-month-long drought starting last
November had destroyed an estimated 20 per cent of one million
timber saplings planted last year under the State reafforestation
programme.
	   Menteri Besar Datuk Seri Shahidan Kassim said persistent
outbreaks of fire in forest reserves due to prolonged dry
conditions had killed these saplings.
	   The drought had also forced the Government to defer this year's
reafforestation programme to the second half of the year.
	   ``We've set a target of planting one million saplings yearly
since the programme took off three years ago,'' he said after
chairing the State Development Committee meeting today.
	   ``Planting one million of them within six months is not beyond
reach when we're aided by the arrival of the rainy season.''
	   He said saplings to be planted comprised high-grade timber
species of teak, sentang, teja, meranti and merawan.
	   Shahidan also said some 900 farmers would be issued with an
annual permit to enable them to enter forest reserves to collect
durian and other seasonal fruits from orchards planted decades ago.
	   The orchards were opened in jungle clearings on the
Malaysia-Thai border before the Government decided to gazette the
areas as forest reserves.
	   However, Shahidan said the authorities would not compromise with
an identified 100-odd `latecomers' who began encroaching on the
reserves a decade ago.

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Tens of thousands of people fled the
former Portuguese colony of Guinea-Bissau on Friday as government
troops fought renegade soldiers who launched a coup attempt,
according to reports.
	   As many as 40,000 people in the West African nation were heading
on foot along the road to the northern border with Senegal, a
Portuguese journalist in the area said, citing local reports.
	   Senegal closed the border on Thursday while medical teams were
dispatched to vaccinate the refugees against yellow fever and
meningitis before they were allowed into the country, Pedro Rosa
Mendes told Portuguese state radio Antena 1.
	   Government troops, supported by soldiers from neighboring
Senegal and the Republic of Guinea, meanwhile maintained their
siege of a military garrison in a northern suburb of the capital
Bissau, where an unknown number of rebels have been holed up since
their attempted powergrab on Sunday.
	   A spokesman for the Portuguese prime minister's office, who was
in contact with the Portuguese embassy in Bissau, said sporadic
shelling and automatic weapons fire could be heard in the capital
throughout the day.
	   ``It's a very unstable situation. We're not sure who's
winning,'' the spokesman said on customary condition of anonymity,
adding that the embassy had been hit by several stray shells.
	   The French embassy was hit by a bazooka shell but no one was
injured, the Portuguese news agency Lusa reported, citing
diplomatic sources in Dakar, Senegal.
	   Portuguese residents in Bafata, the country's second-largest
city, 140 kilometers (90 miles) to the east of Bissau, told Lusa
there was no military activity in the area.
	   The president of the National Assembly, Malan Sanha, said
representatives from Muslim and Catholic associations had allied
with lawmakers to propose talks, Lusa reported.
	   The two sides had ``demonstrated interest'' in holding talks,
Sanha was quoted as saying by Lusa, although he declined to provide
further details.
	   President Joao Bernardo Vieira was reluctant to enter talks and
was confident in his ability to defeat the rebels militarily,
according to an unidentified western diplomat quoted by Lusa.
	   More than 2,200 people, mostly foreigners, were evacuated from
Bissau on a Portuguese merchant ship Thursday.
	   Vitor Duque, an official of the shipping company that provided
the vessel told Antena 1 that the passengers were packed on the
deck. The huge container ship was designed to hold only 18 people.
	   The ship arrived at Dakar harbor at about 1900 GMT and was
waiting just outside the port before pulling in to dock.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Thurs. - Police have taken a serious view of
public gatherings organised by the DAP as a show of support towards
Kota Melaka Member of Parliament Lim Guan Eng.
	   In a Press statement today, Federal police Criminal
Investigation Department director Datuk Yaacob Md Amin said police
viewed the gatherings as unlawful under the Sedition Act, 1948.
	   He said this was because the gatherings were to discuss a
sentence served on Guan Eng which he had since appealed.
	   ``As the case is still pending, the issues discussed at such
gatherings are sub judice.
	   ``The issues also insult the integrity of judges and the justice
system.
	   As such, these issues have seditious tendencies as defined under
section 3(1)(c) of the Seditions Act,'' he said, adding that
discussing the issues was an offence under section 4(1) of the same
Act.
	   Yesterday, Guan Eng and three others - party secretary-general
Lim Kit Siang's political secretary Hew Kuan Yow, Selangor DAP
committee member Wong Kok Yew and party member Lee Pin Soo - were
detained when police broke up a dinner at the Yat Yeh Hing
restaurant in SS4D/2 about 10.30pm.
	   While Guan Eng was detained for questioning for speaking at the
dinner, Hew, Wong and Lee were detained for preventing police from
carrying out their duties.
	   The dinner was held as a show of solidarity towards Guan Eng who
was handed an 18-month jail sentence by the Court of Appeals on
April 1 on two counts of publishing false news.
	   Guan Eng has since filed an appeal against the sentence.
	   Yaacob said such gatherings were deemed to be public gatherings
and as such, the organisers were required to apply for a police
licence to hold them under section 27(5) of the Police Act, 1967.
	   He added that the district police chief reserved the right to
deny such a licence to the organisers if the gathering was deemed
to be a threat to national security or would cause public disorder.

World Cup: Mexico and South Korea hopes hinge on head-to-head

	   LYON, France (AP) _ Any hopes Mexico and South Korea entertain
of advancing past the first round of the World Cup hinge on the
outcome of their opening match on Saturday. It promises to be a
hard-fought game with so much at stake.
	   The two less-fancied teams of Group E that includes soccer-power
Netherlands and tough Belgium know that anything less than a
victory in Lyon could bring their stay in France to an early end.
	   Lineup changes on the eve of the encounter at Lyon's Gerland
stadium hinted at the strategy the coaches will use.
	   Mexico's Manuel Lapuente moved Baulio Luna, an attacking
midfielder, to left back in place of Salvador Carmona, in an effort
to bolster the defense against the fleet-footed Koreans.
	   South Korea's Cha Bum-kun decided to start 19-year-old Ko
Jong-soo at midfield in place of Seo Jung-won, the first South
Korean ever to sign with a French club when he joined Strasburg for
dlrs 1.5 million early this year.
	   Mexico has made clear that its objective is to advance to the
second round.
	   ``The match against South Korea is the most important,'' said
Lapuente. ``It's our biggest chance of earning three points, then
maybe we can get another with a tie against Belgium.
	   ``If we don't beat South Korea we'll face a severe problem
against Netherlands and Belgium.''
	   South Korea would be satisfied just to win its first match in
five World Cup finals, and they've focused on the match against
Mexico as their best chance for a landmark victory.
	   ``The team has prepared intensely for this match,'' said Cha,
who played for South Korea in the 1986 World Cup finals in Mexico.
``The players are at their peak. They are ready to play Mexico, and
win.''
	   Mexico is also anxious to show that a string of poor
performances in warm-up matches ahead of the World Cup are not an
indicator of the team's potential. The team is known as ``El
Tricolor'' for its green, red and white national colors.
	   ``Korea is a hard team, with very fast players,'' said defender
Claudio Suarez. ``They'll be difficult to beat. We'll need to play
well, stay concentrated and beware of breakaways, which they excel
at.''
	   Following Friday's training, Cha also announced two other
changes in his lineup.
	   Top-scorer Choi Yong-soo was left off the roster because of an
injury, replaced by 29-year-old Kim Do-hoon. The 24-year-old
striker, who scored seven times in as many games during the second
round of Asia's World Cup qualifying, had been considered the
team's key attacker going into the World Cup finals.
	   Veteran defender Choi Young-il, the 1994 World Cup team captain,
was also benched in favor of Kim Tae-young.
	   ``The players were chosen based on their physical condition,''
explained Cha.
	   In soccer-mad Mexico, where the match will be televised live at
10 a.m. local time, over 55 million people are expected to be
watching.
	   The South Koreans, meanwhile, are counting on the team to boost
the nation's morale in a time of economic troubles.

	   PETALING JAYA, Thurs. - DAP secretary-general Lim Kit Siang kept
mum today as more party members came out in support of the two
suspended DAP officials and another who was removed from his party
post.
	   At a Press conference today, he said: ``This is a Barisan
Nasional media agenda. I am not saying a single word.''
	   The Press conference was called to protest against the arrest of
his son Lim Guan Eng and three other DAP members during a gathering
in Kelana Jaya last night.
	   The four were released at 2.30am.
	   The Jalan Sungai Besi DAP branch in a resolution unanimously
passed at its annual meeting last night demanded that the party's
central executive committee withdraw the action against the three -
national vice-chairman Liew Ah Kim and treasurer Fung Ket Wing who
have been suspended from their party posts, and Wee Choo Keong who
was removed as national publicity secretary.
	   Branch secretary See Keng Hock said in a statement the three did
not break any party rules, and therefore an independent committee
should be set up to investigate allegations levelled at them by the
CEC.
	   Asked whether the disciplinary committee headed by vice-chairman
Ahmad Nor will meet on June 17 to hear charges against the three,
Kit Siang said: ``You have to ask Ahmad Nor.''
	   Kit Siang refused to comment when asked whether the party was in
a crisis but said it was an attempt by the BN Government to
distract public attention from the current economic problems and
issues of cronyism and nepotism.
	   Kit Siang also criticised police for the way they broke up the
gathering of DAP members last night, resulting in the arrest of
Guan Eng, who is deputy secretary-general.
	   ``It was a very orderly, peaceful and happy gathering of
Malaysians coming together because of their concern for justice,
freedom, democracy and good governance,'' he said.
	   He said the DAP had been organising meetings and dinners over
the past 30 years without breaking any law.
	   Kit Siang said he had faxed a letter to Prime Minister Datuk
Seri Dr Mahathir Mohamad asking him for a meeting to discuss the
police action and to get an explanation over the incident.
	   Guan Eng and three other party members were arrested for holding
an illegal assembly and obstructing police in the discharge of
their duties.
	   Policemen went on stage and detained Guan Eng as he was
addressing a crowd at a restaurant near Kelana Jaya.
	   At a Press conference in Penang, Liew, Fung and Wee said they
regretted that Kit Siang had not responded to their request for an
independent and impartial committee to investigate the allegations
against them.
	   ``Going round the country to justify what they had done will not
help the party in any way but will put the party in bad light with
regard to justice and fair play.
	   ``It's like a deputy public prosecutor going around justifying
why he had sent a person to jail without a trial. This is what has
happened to us.''
	   Meanhile, Penang DAP chairman Teoh Teik Huat said the State DAP
leaders and members had last night listened to the explanation and
grievances of the three.
	   He said: ``In keeping with the principles of justice, fairness
and impartiality as well as in order not to pre-empt or undermine
any future decisions of the party's disciplinary committee, the
Penang DAP leaders will not comment or express any views on what
they have heard from the suspended trio.''
	   However, he said they were in full agreement that the
disciplinary committee should be fair and impartial.
	   ``The grievances of the trio against the existing composition of
the disciplinary committee are indeed well founded and the party
leadership should immediately address this.''

	   JOHOR BARU, Thurs. - The setting up of a special magistrate's
court to handle Johor Baru City Council's cases has been deferred
to August.
	   This is because the building housing the court, a three-storey
shoplot in Jalan Cenderawasih in Larkin, is to be renovated and
refurbished.
	   The court was originally scheduled to start this month.
	   Datuk Bandar Datuk Hashim Yahaya said the city council had just
called for a tender for the renovation work.

<TEXT>
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) _ It's just a quarter-mile (0.4 kilometers)
from the ocean and months of pounding by El Nino left it soggy.
	   But The Olympic Club course on which the U.S. Open will be
played next week survived intact, unlike a neighboring course that
had four holes destroyed by the wicked weather.
	   Though some grassy spots on the course still are slippery,
workers have been able to concentrate on mostly cosmetic touchups
in recent days. Trees were trimmed, greens were mowed and _ in
almost a slap at El Nino _ sprinklers watered the course.
	   The Lake Course that will play host to the U.S. Open was a lot
luckier than the adjacent Ocean Course, where the soil beneath four
holes was eaten away by erosion and oversaturation _ leaving those
holes unplayable this spring.
	   ``It's had minimal impact on the Lake Course,'' course
superintendent John Fleming said. ``It had dramatic effects on the
other properties.''
	   The biggest challenge for Fleming and his crew has been
adjusting to the 5-inch (13-cm) rough the United States Golf
Association requires for the Open. The last time the Open was
played at The Olympic Club, in 1987, the rough was 4 inches (10
cms) tall.
	   ``The U.S. Open is rough. Rough is what defines the
championship,'' he said.
	   In fact, Fleming said, the unusually heavy rains of the last few
months have actually helped him prepare the rough _ and the rest of
the course _ for the Open, even though the wetness has made it
difficult at times to mow the grass.
	   ``I actually think El Nino has been a blessing in disguise. The
warm spring rains allowed us to germinate the rough grass, the rye
grasses that we've seeded into the rough areas to get the density
that the USGA requires for this tournament,'' he said.
	   ``It's also kept a lot of play off the golf course, which is
important to a superintendent getting a course ready for a major
championship.''
	   The U.S. Open is famous for its narrow fairways and deep, thick
rough. The rains virtually assured that the USGA will get the
conditions it wants. The soft fairways will also take much of the
roll off of tee shots and make the course play a lot longer.
	   The Olympic Club course, which also played host to the Open in
1955 and 1966, always has presented a variety of natural challenges
for golfers and fans. A chilly fog often rolls off the Pacific and
the course's 40,000 trees have played a part in determining
champions.
	   In contrast to this year, too much June sunshine was the big
fear for golfers during the last Open here in 1987. The sun firmed
up fairways and greens, usually kept relatively soft by the fog,
and made conditions fast and tricky.
	   The towering cypress and pine trees that line the narrow,
twisting fairways and surround the unusually small greens have
played a part in U.S. Open history.
	   At the 1955 tournament, amateur Harvie Ward was close to the
lead in the third round when he hit into a tree on the eighth hole
and the ball didn't come down. He took a penalty stroke on the way
to a double bogey, and never threatened again.
	   The ball fell out of the tree a week later.
	   The Pacific Ocean and the Golden Gate Bridge provide part of the
spectacular backdrop at The Olympic Club, which was dubbed ``the
longest short course in the world'' by Ben Hogan. It's 83 yards (75
meters) longer than the last time it welcomed the Open, but still
is just 6,797 yards (6,185 meters) overall.
	   The 16th hole, a par 5, is 609 yards (554 meters) and the 17th
is an uphill challenge of 468 yards (426 meters). But there are
several extremely short holes, including the 137-yard (125-meter)
eighth hole and the 157-yard (143-meter) 15th.
	   The lack of length is appropriate because of the course's
location.
	   ``Because of the proximity to the ocean and the density of the
air, the ball doesn't travel as far,'' Fleming said.
	   There are no water hazards, no out of bounds and just one
fairway bunker, yet the Lake Course has always tormented players
with its fickle winds and difficult angles. In the three Opens at
The Olympic Club, only four golfers have broken par for 72 holes.
	   Birds hopped around the fairways and flowers basked in a
late-spring dew as Fleming and his 45-person crew put the finishing
touches on a course that has been turned a lush green by the winter
and spring rains.
	   ``Architecturally, this is the simplest golf course in the
world,'' said Fleming, who has been tending to it since 1972.
``It's just pure golf.''

	   SEPANG, Thurs. - The Special Malaysia Disaster Assistance and
Rescue Team (Smart) is in the process of determining the fastest
route to the Kuala Lumpur International Airport to establish a
response time of no more than 30 minutes.
	   National Security Division director-general Datuk Ja'afar
Ismail, who was at the airport today with some 20 members of the
team for the first official briefing, said the response time
registered in the team's two test runs stood at a little under an
hour.
	   ``I'm not very happy with the time yet. So we are trying to find
the best possible route with the least traffic to reduce it
further,'' he said.
	   The Smart team, which was established after the Highland Tower
disaster of 1993, will be contacted in the event of an emergency or
disaster at KLIA.
	   The team, based at the police depot in Jalan Semarak, comprises
of 85 personnel specially selected from the armed forces, the Fire
and Rescue Department and the police.
	   ``Based on what we heard during the briefing today, we believe
KLIA's security authorities have got very good systems and
contingency plans.
	   ``Now we want to work on how the team can be fully integrated
into the airport's own emergency teams.''
	   KLIA is scheduled to be opened by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong
Tuanku Ja'afar on June 27.

	   KUALA TERENGGANU, Thurs. - The majority of hotels and resorts in
the State recorded a marked increase in room occupancy rates in the
first quarter of the year.
	   State Tourism, Culture and Arts Development Committee chairman
Datuk Aziz Awang said most resorts, especially those of islands,
had shown between 75 and 80 per cent occupancy compared to less
than 50 per cent last year.
	   ``Most resorts on the islands, such as Pulau Perhentian, Pulau
Redang and Pulau Lang, gave satisfactory reports on their room
occupancy rates since early this year,'' he told the reporters
after chairing a meeting on the International Marang-Kapas
Swimathon 1998 yesterday.
	   He said resorts and chalets at Perhentian Island Resort recorded
full occupancy with visitors from Germany, France, Australia, Italy
and Belgium.
	   ``In our interviews with some tourists, they said they chose the
islands because the beaches are clean and unpolluted, besides being
an ideal place to relax,'' he said.
	   However, he said there were also other hotels, especially those
on the mainland, which needed to improve their services.
	   He said some of these hotels recorded less than 35 per cent in
room occupancy rates.
	   In view of this, he said the State Government had set up a
committee to assist the hotels in overcoming their problems.

	   SEREMBAN, Thurs. - The Negri Sembilan Government has no
intention of increasing the existing water rates as it does not
want to burden the people, Menteri Besar Tan Sri Mohamad Isa Abdul
Samad said today.
	   ``The last time we revised our water rates was in 1992. We can
revise the rates now but we don't want to do so,'' he said after
witnessing digging work on the first tube-well water project in
Kampung Paroi.
	   He said this was despite the State having to service almost
RM850 million in water infrastructure loans from the Federal
Government.
	   The tube well is capable of supplying 1.12 to 1.8 million litres
of water daily to Taman Tasik Jaya and its neighbouring areas.
	   Three more wells will be dug there soon.
	   A similar project will be carried out in Tanah Merah, Port
Dickson.

	   SEREMBAN, Thurs. - A company manager told the Sessions Court
today that he did not give a RM274,453.82 Mercedes Benz to an
ex-aide of former Malacca Chief Minister, the late Datuk Seri Mohd
Zin Abdul Ghani.
	   Chang Kok Chuang, 40, from Atlantic Potential Sdn Bhd said he
did not have any dealings with Azman Ghani, 38, who was also at the
time assistant director of valuation and property management of the
Malacca Municipal Council.
	   Azman is charged with accepting the car, bearing registration
number MAB 747 as gratification to expedite the approval of a
project in Malacca.
	   He is accused of committing the offence at Minsoon Credit Corp
(M) Sdn Bhd at 73, Jalan Tuanku Antah, Seremban at 2.30pm on Feb
25, 1995.
	   The charge under Section 165 of the Penal Code which carries a
maximum sentence of two years' jail, a fine or both.
	   Azman was represented by Christopher Fernando, Haresh Mahadevan,
Ramzani Idris and K.K.Low while Ahamad Bache from the
Anti-Corruption Agency prosecuted before judge Supiah Meon.
	   Chang said all dealings between his company and the Malacca
State Government for the development of a bus and taxi terminal in
Semabok were between the company and the Malacca Municipal Council
and never involved Azman.
	   Md Zuhaidi Ramji, a clerk with Mayban Finance in Rahang,
Seremban, said he was responsible for the accounts of two cars, MAB
747 and WDV 9.
	   The second car, WDV 9 was purchased by Atlantic Potential for
one of its directors while the other car (MAB 747) was registered
in the name of Malaysia Airlines pilot, Najme Khir Mohamad, 46.
	   He said Atlantic Potential had only been involved in the
transaction for the second car (WDV 9). June 16 was fixed for
submissions.

	   COCKBURN TOWN, Turks and Caicos (AP) _ Examinations of the
bodies of six Haitian refugees who drowned Monday when their sloop
capsized off the Turks and Caicos islands did not have gunshot
wounds, police said Friday.
	   Some of the survivors of the shipwreck said marine police had
fired at the boat. But police said warning shots were fired in the
air, but not at the overcrowded boat, said Deputy Police
Commissioner Bryan Davies.
	   Emma Lou, a pathologist with the Dade County Coroners Office in
Florida, was brought in to examine the bodies of the victims.
	   The sunken boat has been raised and will also be examined by
police, Davies said Friday.
	   The 70 Haitians who survived the sinking are being interviewed
with the help of interpreters and also spent more than an hour
Thursday talking with a representative from the Haitian consulate
in the Bahamas.
	   The ship sank Monday just 15 miles off Providenciales, the
largest island in the British archipelago 600 miles southeast of
Florida.
	   Survivors said as many as 113 people were on the boat, but
police said there were about 70 survivors and six bodies recovered.
	   Davies said police also want to interview the occupants of two
sailing yachts that may have been near the incident. The names of
the vessels are unknown, but some survivors said they were flying
U.S. flags.
	   Thousands of Haitian refugees fleeing their impoverished country
have ended up in the Turks and Caicos islands in recent years.

	   MALACCA, Thurs. - Police have recorded statements from 40 people
who are either relatives or friends of the two men whose bodies
were found in a white Toyota Corolla in Pahang last Tuesday.
	   It is understood that police today recorded statements from the
wife of the man who was found strangled to death.
	   Also interviewed were several policemen and the doctor who
performed the autopsy on the two bodies at the Muadzam Shah
Hospital in Pahang.
	   Police have yet to establish the motive for the killings
although it was earlier said that it could be due to a failed
business transaction.
	   Two Singaporeans were detained at a police roadblock at the
100th km Kuantan-Segamat highway when police found the two bodies
in the car bearing registration number MAF 433.
	   The body found in the boot of the car had a stab wound in the
chest and was wrapped in a blanket, while the other, believed to
have been strangled, was found in the rear seat.
	   Yesterday, State Criminal Investigation Department chief
Assistant Commissioner Mat Zain Ibrahim confirmed that the two
bodies had been claimed by family members on Monday.

	   BUTTERWORTH, Thurs. - The Fire and Rescue Department is
considering posting fewer firemen at most of its stations in a bid
to reduce its operating costs by 60 per cent.
	   Its director-general Datuk Soh Chai Hock said today, positions
vacated by the firemen would instead be replaced by volunteers.
	   ``We are conducting a study on the matter. The proposed
reduction on the number of firemen is based on the system carried
out in the United Kingdom,'' he told reporters when met at the
department's State headquarters in Prai.
	   He was asked to comment on Housing and Local Government Minister
Datuk Dr Ting Chew Peh's announcement on the Government's move to
revamp all volunteer fire fighting squads in the country.
	   Soh said the proposal, when carried out, would involve staff
from all levels at all 193 fire stations and the respective 14
State headquarters.
	   ``For instance, in smaller stations, we would have three
volunteers to perform the task of a single fireman and the number
of firemen in such stations would be limited to 12.''

	   PONTIAN, Thurs. - A smallholder, his wife, their eight-year-old
son and soon-to-be-married daughter were found brutally murdered at
their farm home in Kampung Parit Hj Arif, near Parit Madirono,
Benut, yesterday.
	   The victims were identified as smallholder Redzuan Mansur, 55,
housewife Rosnah Busari, 44, their daughter Hamsah, 20 and son Mohd
Azizul, 8.
	   Their partially decomposed bodies were discovered by the fiance
and Hamsah's sister.
	   Police have yet to establish the motive for the killings, which
was described by district police chief Superintendant Gingkoi Seman
Pancras as ``the most vicious, cold-blooded and brutal murders'' in
Pontian in recent years.
	   Hamsah, a factory worker, was to have been married on July 15.
Mohd Azizul was a Standard Two pupil of Sekolah Rendah Kebangsaan
Lubok Sipat.
	   Redzuan, Rosnah and Mohd Azizul's bodies were found piled on a
bed in a rear bedroom of the house.
	   Rosnah's body was lying next to her son, both face-up, while
Redzuan's body was stacked on top of them face-down. The three had
been hacked on the back of their necks, and Redzuan's and Mohd
Azizul's heads were almost severed.
	   They also had several other deep slash wounds all over their
bodies.
	   Mohd Azizul's throat had also been slit, and he had been cut
across his face along his mouth.
	   Hamsah's semi-nude body was found lying face-up on a bed in
another bedroom. A towel was found stuffed in her mouth, and a
pillow was on her face.
	   Gingkoi did not rule out the possibility that she may have been
sexually assaulted.
	   There were no outward injury marks on her body, and she is
believed to have died of suffocation and shock.
	   The room next to the one she was found, had been decorated with
new furniture, golden yellow bridal bedlinen and vases of
artificial flowers, in preparation of her wedding.
	   Gingkoi said the four victims were last seen alive at a wedding
function in the village on Sunday evening.
	   The bodies were found after Hamsah's fiance, rubber tapper Md
Zali Tarhib, 26, who had gone to the house to visit the family and
discuss the wedding arrangements.
	   He suspected something amiss when no one answered his calls and
immediately contacted Hamsah's sister, Misiah in Batu Pahat.
	   Md Zali and Misiah later forced open the rear door yesterday
afternoon and found the dead.
	   Police sent tracker dogs to comb the area, and forensic experts
were also at the scene to facilitate investigations.
	   ``From our initial investigations, we believe more than one
killer was involved, and that the killers were persons known to the
family,'' he said.
	   Gingkoi said that there were no signs of forced entry and that
the house was still locked from the inside at the time the bodies
were discovered.
	   ``The killers appear to have gained entry through an access
opening at the back of the house.''
	   The house was in an isolated location, and the nearest house was
nearly a kilometre away.
	   The house had been partly ransacked but nothing valuable was
found missing.
	   Gingkoi said the approximate time of the murders was probably
between Sunday evening and Monday morning.
	   Rosnah's brother Kassim Busari that Mohd Azizul had not attended
school since Monday. Hamsah too had not reported for work since
Monday.
	   Anyone with information on the case can contact Pontian CID
chief ASP V.
	   Pushpanathan at tel: 07-6871222, or the Benut Police Station
tel: 07- 6903222.

World Cup: Dugarry comes off bench to lead 3-0 victory
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; URGENT &QL; 
 &UR; By RAF CASERT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ Christophe Dugarry, whom many think
only made the team because of his friendship with Zinedine Zidane,
scored one goal and caused trouble for South Africa for the final
63 minutes Friday night, leading a 3-0 victory for the host French
in the World Cup opener for both teams.
	   Dugarry, who only came on in the 27th minute after starting
starting forward Stephane Guivarc'h went down with appeared to be
an injured leg, back-headed a corner from Zidane in the 34th minute
to open the scoring.
	   The goal drew roars from the crowd, which included French Prime
Minister Lionel Jospin and French organizing committee president
Michel Platini, and was especially sweet for Dugarry.
	   The 26-year-old forward played the last half season for
Olympique Marseille and struggled after transferring from FC
Barcelona. French coach Aime Jacquet was harshly criticized in some
quarters for his inclusion of Dugarry in the team, with many saying
only his close relationship with Zidane earned him a place among
the 22.
	   Dugarry's goal was the finale in a series of chances the French
created in quick succession. Only a minute after coming on, Dugarry
broke in on South African keeper Hans Vonk unmarked, only to have
the South African keeper come quickly off his line to snuff out the
threat.
	   Dugarry also was involved in the second goal, laying off a ball
for a Youri Djorkaeff, who hit a falling, slow roller at Vonk from
inside the penalty spot.
	   Vonk appeared to easily have the shot covered, but a sliding
attempt to clear the ball by Dugarry's Marseille teammate Pierre
Issa's bounced over Vonk and landly softly in the goal.
	   The capped the rout when Thierry Henry stole the ball outside
the top of the penalty area, drove down the right and chipped over
a sliding and advancing Vonk in the second minute of second-half
injury time.
	   The French were clearly dominant after the first 15 minutes,
rarely giving keeper Fabien Barthez any work.
	   The game started slowly with South Africa limited to one
legitimate chance in the entire half: Brandan Augustine's free kick
from 25 meter that was blocked by Emmanuel Petit.
	   But Zidane created two chances in the first 17 minutes on free
kicks.
	   His first from 25 meters in the second minute skidded wide of
the right post and his second went over the bar.
	   A strong wind that blew toward the South African goal seemed to
hurt the World Cup debutante's clearances and long pases from the
back. But even with the wind, the South Africans rarely threatened.
	   One of South Africa's few dangerous moments came in the 20th
minute when Barthez had to come out to the top of the ara to chest
away a bounding through ball. After getting to the ball, he
collided with Benedict McCarthy and was knocked off his feet before
the ball was cleared from danger.

Albanian militants kill Serb policemen near Kosovo capital
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Ethnic Albanian militants, boldly
stepping up their attacks, have killed two Serb policemen just a
few miles (kilometers) from Kosovo's capital.
	   Fighting between Serbian forces and the militants erupted again
Friday in the Decani region in western Kosovo, close to the border
with Albania. It was a Serbian offensive there last week that
prompted NATO on Thursday to announce a show of air power aimed at
persuading Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to halt the
assault.
	   Ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs nine-to-one in the southern
province of Kosovo. Most seek independence from Serbia, the
dominant republic in Yugoslavia, which in 1989 stripped the
province of broad autonomy and has ruled with a heavy hand ever
since. More than 250 people have been killed since Serbian police
started cracking down on Albanian militants in March.
	   Ethnic Albanian militants have gained popular support since the
crackdown, and young Kosovo Albanians who live in western Europe
have gone to Albania to help organize resistance or fight.
Militants said Friday that they now command 15,000 fighters in
Kosovo, according to the Albanian state news agency ATA.
	   Ethnic Albanian sources claimed that seven villages in the
Decani area were under attack Friday from forces using grenade
launchers normally issued to the Yugoslav army. One Albanian,
Rexhep Mazrekaj, 38, was killed, they said.
	   There was no independent confirmation of their report, but the
state-run Tanjug news agency in Belgrade reported that a Serb
policeman was seriously hurt in what it called an attack by ``armed
Albanian terrorists'' near one of the villages, Prilep.
	   Serb sources in the province said two policemen where killed and
one was seriously wounded in an overnight ambush by separatists
near Obilic, seven kilometers (four miles) northwest of the
provincial capital, Pristina.
	   Albanian sources reported other Serb attacks on villages near
Obilic and adjacent Vucitrn.
	   The ethnic Albanian daily Bujku reported Friday that five ethnic
Albanians and seven Serbs were killed in clashes Thursday in Suvo
Grlo in the Drenica area, 30 kilometers (20 miles) west of
Pristina. Bujku said the fighting was fierce, with villagers
determined to ``resist to the end with the help of the KLA.''
	   NATO is planning simulated air attacks in neighboring Albania
and Macedonia in an effort to persuade Milosevic to end the
military action.
	   On Friday, Western foreign ministers met in London with their
Russian counterpart to step up pressure. Britain, which is weighing
a United Nations' move to back use of NATO force in Kosovo, called
on Milosevic to withdraw his troops immediately.
	   The United States, Canada, Britain, France, Italy and Germany
said they would ``take steps to ban'' flights by Yugoslav Airlines,
British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said.
	   Kosovo's Albanians welcomed the NATO activity. Eroll Haxhiu, 46,
a jewelry merchant in Pristina market, said the United States ``can
and should'' strike at Milosevic.
	   Members of Kosovo's Serb minority _ whom Milosevic promised to
protect when taking power in Serbia in 1987 _ were alternately
gloomy and defiant.
	   ``We are to blame for everything that is happening. We deserve
it,'' said Vasilje Stefanovic, a pensioner from Prizren.
	   ``If they attack us, they'll be attacking a sovereign country,''
said Jovan Banjanin, 40, who refused to state his occupation. ``We
will have to defend ourselves, and this has nothing to do with the
Albanian issue.''

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ If NATO intervenes in secessionist
Kosovo province, the Yugoslav army will treat the alliance as an
intruder and ``defend the territory ... with all means available,''
a top aide to President Slobodan Milosevic said Friday.
	   Zoran Lilic, a close Milosevic aide who was Yugoslavia's
president until last year and is now a deputy premier, told The
Associated Press he hoped there would never be a clash between NATO
and Yugoslavia.
	   He made clear that Serbia, which along with Montenegro comprises
Yugoslavia, does not regard violence in Kosovo as an all-out war
with dangerous regional consequences.
	   ``We know that in a clash with NATO _ it's stupid even to think
about that _ we don't stand a chance,'' Lilic said. ``But it is its
(Yugoslav army's) duty to defend the territory against anybody who
tries to enter by force.''
	   Hostilities in Serbia's southern province of Kosovo threaten to
ignite a war that could spread to neighboring countries. Ethnic
Albanians, who outnumber Serbs by nine to one in Kosovo, want
independence and are prepared to fight for it.
	   More than 250 people have died in clashes since government
forces in March began a crackdown on Albanian militants, known as
the Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   Lilic said fighting occurred only in some parts of Kosovo and
called the clashes a conflict ``between security forces and the
terrorists.''
	   ``The United States can play a key role if they exert pressure
on Albanians to cease terrorist actions _ which would mean an
automatic halt of actions by the police,'' Lilic said.
	   Milosevic revoked the province's broad autonomy in 1989, trying
to quash Albanians' push for independence and claiming to protect
the Kosovo Serb cause he had espoused to gain power.
	   But nine years of heavy-handed Serbian rule, enforced with a
strong police and army presence, have only fanned demands for
independence. The peaceful course pursued by ethnic Albanian
political leaders is losing ground to KLA militancy.
	   Kosovo's Albanians, protesting Serbia's rule, have boycotted all
Serbian elections since 1990, and founded alternative schools and
hospitals since being sacked or quitting most state jobs that year.
	   Lilic denied that government forces have acted brutally against
Albanian civilians. Foreign diplomats allowed into the region of
the most recent severe fighting in western Kosovo saw scenes of
devastation reminiscent of Bosnia, with houses burned and shelled.
	   Claiming the KLA are ``actually Muslim fundamentalists'', Lilic
reiterated Yugoslav accusations against neighboring Albania,
accusing it of training and arming the rebels.
	   Also Friday, President Milo Djukanovic of Montenegro, Serbia's
only remaining partner in the Yugoslav federation, indicated he
might withdraw recruits from his republic from the army if it
became implicated in atrocities.

<TEXT>
	   LEON, Spain (AP) _ World chess champion Garry Kasparov of Russia
beat Bulgarian Grand Master Veselin Topalov Friday in an all-human
tie-break after their computer-assisted chess challenge ended in
stalemate.
	   Kasparov's tie-break victory came on the fourth game, after
winning the first, losing the second and drawing the third.
	   Both players had won two, lost two and drawn two of the six
prior games in which they had been permitted to consult moves with
the Chessmaster 5500 program, designed by the U.S. company
Mindscape.
	   Two games were played each day in the three-day experimental
competition that sought to eliminate human error while retaining
human imagination and flare.
	   Topalov had gone into Friday's matches one point down, but the
Bulgarian, playing the black pieces, came back with a win in a
tense match in which being two pawns up proved worth exposing his
king at the center of the board.
	   In the final game Kasparov, playing black, held his young
challenger to a draw and both players were level playing with three
points each.
	   No title was at stake in the challenge dubbed ``chess of the
future'' and held in this northern Spanish city.
	   Kasparov's tie-break victory earned him dlrs 6,600 and Topalov
got a compensation dlrs 3,000.
	   Without computers, Topalov, 23, the world's No. 4, has now
defeated Kasparov three times and lost eight of the 19 games they
have played. The remainder were draws.
	   Despite being barred from professional competitions, computers
have come to dominate the chess world over the last quarter
century.
	   Modern programs, many of them designed under Kasparov's
guidance, have become capable of beating most humans, including
Kasparov himself.
	   Kasparov is considered the world's top chess player, although
fellow Russian Anatoly Karpov is the reigning champion of the World
Chess Federation.

	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Albania said Friday it will offer NATO
air space and airports in the country for maneuvers aimed at
deterring further violence in Serbia's adjoining secessionist
province of Kosovo.
	   But neighboring Macedonia, whose prime minister visits Albania
this weekend, delayed a decision on the maneuvers, summoning its
government into a late-night session and saying it would not allow
its territory to be used for military activity against any
neighboring country.
	   Macedonia's Defense Minister Blagoj Handziski made the
announcement when asked by reporters about NATO's plans, announced
Thursday, for simulated air raids in Albania and Macedonia intended
to deter further bloodshed in Kosovo.
	   Yugoslavia _ consisting of Serbia and Montenegro _ adjoins
Macedonia.
	   ``At this point, we can say that if the contents and goals of
the exercise serve to improve the security and stability of the
country ... then we shall consider the possibility of agreeing,''
Handziski said.
	   Macedonia's government met late into the night, and parliament
may convene over the weekend to debate the NATO maneuvers, sources
in Macedonia's capital Skopje said.
	   Albania's Prime Minister Fatos Nano, who has lobbied for weeks
for NATO intervention to stop Kosovo violence from engulfing the
region, announced after a Cabinet meeting that Albania would offer
NATO air space and airfields.
	   ``We are convinced that the crisis in Kosovo is not only a
problem for Albania,'' Nano said. Macedonia ``is also interested in
regional stability ... and I hope that they will not try to keep
their country artificially out of the crisis when the crisis is at
its door.''
	   Macedonia's dominant Slavs have strong ties to the Serbs, but it
also has a sizable ethnic Albanian majority in its western
territory adjoining Kosovo and Albania proper.

Government probing Northwest Airlines maintenance
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GLEN JOHNSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration is
investigating whether Northwest Airlines has properly cared for its
aging fleet, as well as concerns that a local FAA inspector may not
have properly supervised the carrier and its maintenance regimen.
	   Northwest has saved billions in recent years by skipping a round
of new airplane purchases in favor of refurbishing its aged
workhorse, the McDonnell Douglas DC-9, but the airline says the
FAA's allegations are only the most bitter pill in its contentious
contract negotiations with unions.
	   ``These are stories that resulted from allegations from a
disgruntled former employee and have been looked at and found
meritless by the FAA twice,'' company spokesman Jon Austin said
Friday. ``If the FAA has any lingering questions, we would welcome
a third look.''
	   Northwest, which flies the oldest fleet of airplanes among the
nation's major carriers, decided in 1994 to delay buying new planes
and instead extend the life of some 25-year-old DC-9s up to 40
years. The airline has extensive operations in Asia and Europe.
	   Airplanes are designed to fly safely for 30 years or more, and
the FAA has a program to monitor aging aircraft to keep them in the
sky even longer. But the decision to extend the life of the DC-9s
and the program to do so would have to have been approved by the
FAA office in Minneapolis, where Northwest is based.
	   A ``fact-finding review'' was launched in February after an FAA
employee from another region raised concerns about the supervision
provided by the Minneapolis office. Afterward, two other
allegations were received, one from a current Northwest employee
and one from a former worker.
	   The airline had to cancel or delay an unusually high number of
flights recently and it ranked ninth among the nation's 10 major
carriers in on-time performance last year.
	   Other airline officials noted that Northwest has not had an
accident caused by mechanical failure in the nine years under the
current management team. The airline, the nation's fourth largest
carrier, had its last accident in December 1990, when two planes
collided on the ground. Eight people were killed.

Rain washes out most of Buick Classic play Friday
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOEL STASHENKO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HARRISON, New York (AP) _ A drenching, wind-whipped rain washed
out most of Friday's second round of the Buick Classic.
	   The round will be completed early Saturday, followed by the
start of the third round.
	   Only 18 golfers finished Friday's round before the rain and
casual water at the Westchester Country Club forced the suspension
of play. Forty-eight players were on the course and 73 others,
including first-round leader Kevin Sutherland and most of the rest
of Thursday's top finishers, hadn't started their rounds.
	   Not having to play Friday could be a ``huge break,'' said
Sutherland, a non-winner in five years on the PGA tour.
	   ``These conditions are terrible,'' he said.
	   The best round among those who finished was Brad Faxon's
2-under-par 69, which put him at 1-under 141 after two rounds. Joe
Ozaki shot a 70 for 140.
	   Players who hit the ball in the fairway Friday were allowed to
lift, clean and place their ball within one club length of where it
came to rest because of the soggy ground. But that hardly made up
for the saturated conditions.
	   Faxon said he was unluckly having to play Thursday afternoon,
when winds began to swirl following a calm morning, and again in
Friday morning's rain. Sutherland, who shot a 7-under 64 Thursday,
and the other leaders have avoided the worst of the weather both
days.
	   ``I think these guys should play in this garbage a little,''
Faxon said. ``The greens didn't seem that saturated. They were
rolling nice. ... It wasn't like it was unplayable.''
	   In addition to cutting driving distance by 30 yards (9 meters)
or more a hole, the rain also made it impossible to get a dry grip
on the club, Faxon said.
	   ``The bottom of the bag gets wet, so every time you pull a club
out it's wet and the shafts go in and they're wet,'' he said.
``Gloves get wet. Your hands get wet.''
	   Faxon used four towels trying to keep his hands and grips dry
and two pairs of golf shoes.
	   Among golfers on the course when play was stopped, Stewart Cink
was 3 under for the round and even par overall through 15 holes.
Nick Faldo was on the 15th at 3-under for the day when play was
suspended. He also was at par.
	   Vijay Singh, Buick Classic winner in 1993 and 1995, was 2-under
on the day and 2-under for the tournament through 16 holes Friday.
	   Paul Goydos started the day tied for second at 5-under but was
3-over through 15 holes for the round.

World Cup: For South Africa, emotional first appearance overshadows

<TEXT>
	   MARSEILLES, France (AP) _ For South Africa, just being there
Friday night was what mattered most.
	   Never mind that host France easily won 3-0 against the
defense-minded South Africans, who were playing their nation's
first World Cup game.
	   There are two more first-round matches for South Africa and
other World Cups to come, more chances to shine across the planet
and create dreams for those back home. The inaugural appearance in
soccer's biggest tournament was a coming of age for players, fans
and a nation that has long-thirsted for recognition, and even more,
acceptance.
	   A lifetime of waiting meant the hundreds of flag-waving, singing
South African fans didn't really care if ``Bafana Bafana'' _ Zulu
for ``the boys'' _ won or lost.
	   ``I think the significance is being able to compete in a world
event like the World Cup for the first time,'' said Andre Luck, 35,
of Cape Town. ``It would be good if we could win, but I'm glad
we're just competing.''
	   Shipping company official Phillip Malebe, 44, of Johannesburg
said he was amazed at how the event brought South Africans of all
colors and backgrounds together.
	   ``The fact is we are here. They brought us all here,'' said
Malebe, who wore a South African jersey. ``I've seen the beautiful
rainbow nation, all colors, singing our song. We were singing
together, we were passing drinks mouth-to-mouth. ... Just to be
here, we don't need the Cup.''
	   Deputy President Thabo Mbeki, the heir apparent to Nelson
Mandela, was among the 60,000 spectators packed into Stade
Velodrome, sitting with French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin and
World Cup organizing committee chairman Michel Platini.
	   French fans belted out a stirring ``La Marseillaise'' and the
French players responded, attacking the South Africans for most of
the first half and going ahead on a 34th minute header by
Christophe Dugarry off a corner kick. An own-goal by South Africa's
Pierre Issa in the 78th and Thierry Henry's shot in the second
minute of penalty time completed the rout.
	   South Africa lacked the speed and strength to win battles for
the ball, and its defensive shell allowed France to control play
and set up numerous chances around goalkeeper Hans Vonk.
	   Since arriving in France on Sunday, the players have been
reminded again and again that the bad years of apartheid and
international isolation are gone. In Vichy, the central town where
they train, residents have welcomed them warmly, seeking autographs
at every chance.
	   Back home, the significance is even greater. South Africa has
enjoyed lots of sports success since its return to the
international arena in the early 1990s. Ernie Els has won two U.S.
Opens in golf, while Josia Thugwane was the Olympic marathon
champion and Penny Heyns won two swimming gold medals in Atlanta
two years ago. The rugby Springboks won their World Cup at home in
1995.
	   But soccer is the national sport, followed and played zealously
by most of the black majority. For 28 years, until 1992, South
Africa was banned from international soccer because of apartheid
and its players and fans could only wonder what a World Cup was
like.
	   Now they know.

Opposition party representatives ousted from Guyana Parliament
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BERT WILKINSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) _ The representatives of the main
opposition party were kicked out of Parliament after they failed to
attend the minimum number of consecutive sessions, party officials
confirmed Friday.
	   The People's National Congress, which won 25 of the 65 seats in
Parliment in the December general election, had refused to take its
seats. The party has claimed the elections were unfair although two
international groups have said election irregularities were minor.
	   On Thursday, the government told the party to provide the names
of 25 new representatives or the ban on its attendance in
Parliament would continue indefinitely.
	   ``We were sort of expecting it,'' said Malcolm Parris, a member
of the party's central executive committee. ``I don't think it will
bring a crisis. We are going to submit the same 25 names because
they were the ones elected.''
	   Party President Desmond Hoyte, the losing presidential candidate
in the election, said the party has yet to decide if or when it
will take its seats.
	   The party contends the elections were marred by fraud although a
panel of regional elections experts, funded by the United Nations,
audited the results and found only minor problems. A team of
elections observers from the Organization of American States issued
a similar finding.
	   The party's representatives were ousted under parliamentary
regulations that prohibit members from missing six consecutive
meetings of the House in an eight-week period.
	   The majority needs the cooperation of the minority members of
Parliament to undertake a planned revision of the Constitution in
this former British colony in South America.
	   Parris said he did not think the ouster of his party's
representatives would derail current talks between the People's
National Congress and the ruling People's Progressive Party on race
relations and constitutional reform.
	   Supporters of the People's National Congress are mostly of
African descent while People's Progressive Party members are
primarily East Indian, with the population of the country roughly
split between the two groups.

 &UR; Eds: LEADS to UPDATE with new statements by Netanyahu, RECASTS,
 &UR; By JACK KATZENELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Friday
challenged the American and Palestinian position that the
Palestinians have accepted a U.S. proposal that they fulfill their
commitments under the Oslo accords in return for an Israeli
withdrawal from 13 percent of the West Bank.
	   Interviewed on Israeli Channel 1 television, Netanyahu said
agreement could be reached but that it depended on the
Palestinians.
	   The reporter pointed out that the Palestinians have agreed to
the American proposal, and Netanyahu retorted: ``That's what you
say.''
	   Netanyahu implied that the Palestinians' assurances _ that they
will abrogate clauses in the Palestinian Covenant calling for the
destruction of Israel and do more to crack down on terrorist groups
_ are too vague.
	   ``I want to see the fulfillment of these promises in practice,
with dates, and the knowledge that the commitments are really being
implemented in a concrete manner,'' Netanyahu said.
	   The U.S. plan, which has not been officially announced although
many of its details have been disclosed, is an attempt by the
Americans to re-start the peace process that broke down 15 months
ago.
	   In his public statements until now, Netanyahu has rejected the
U.S. proposal for a 13 percent withdrawal from the West Bank, which
Israel captured and occupied in the 1967 Mideast war. He has
reportedly been holding out for nine percent.
	   He has demanded that an agreement also specify the size of the
next withdrawal, which would be the third and last redeployment of
the Oslo interim accord.
	   ``I think ... it will be the last agreement we will make, which
the State of Israel will make, until the completion of the
permanent settlement,'' he said.
	   Netanyahu rejected speculation that he discussed the possibility
of a national unity government Friday when he met Ehud Barak,
leader of the opposition Labor party.
	   Right wing parties in Netanyahu's coalition have threatened to
bring down his government if he carries out any withdrawal in the
West Bank.
	   There was speculation that he met Barak as a hint to the right
wing parties that he has the option of forming an alliance with
Labor, in order to win parliamentary approval for the withdrawal.
	   However Netanyahu insisted he just briefed Barak on the
negotiations with the Palestinians ``I didn't talk to him about a
unity government,'' Netanyahu said.
	   In another U.S. effort to move the process forward, CIA Director
George Tenet met separately this week with Netanyahu and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and reportedly passed messages
about security coordination between the two leaders.
	   Meanwhile, the prospect of holding a national referendum on the
West Bank withdrawal has been gaining momentum in government
circles.

	   PARIS (AP) _ Paraguayan keeper Jose Luis Chilavert nearly
scored; the French did it three times.
	   Chilavert's would have been historic, but wouldn't have equalled
the pleasure for the French, who saw ``Les Bleus'' open their World
Cup campaign Friday night with a dominating 3-0 victory over South
Africa.
	   Chistophe Dugarry came off the bench for injured forward
Stephane Guivarc'h in the 27th minute and scored seven minutes
later to lead the hosts' rout of the world championship debutantes
on a day that showed little excitement and several problems until
the match in Marseille.
	   It started with the evacuation of the Stade de le Mosson press
tribune in Montpellier before the Paraguay-Bulgaria match because
of a bomb scare. The media center next to the stadium had to be
evacuated after the match due to another threat.
	   Those distractions came amidst a 0-0 draw between Paraguay and
Bulgaria, and a 1-0 victory by Denmark over Saudi Arabia in Lens.
	   Dugarry's goal electrified a crowd in Marseilles that included
French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin and French organizing committee
co-president Michel Platini. It also silenced his critics, who
complained his inclusion in the squad was only due to his close
friendship with team star Zinedine Zidane.
	   The Olympique Marseille forward backheaded in a corner from
Zidane and seemed to minimize his troubled half season with the
French club after transferring from FC Barcelona.
	   His Marseille teammate Pierre Issa was responsible for the
second goal, deflecting a slow Youri Djorkaeff shot over his own
goalkeeper, Hans Vonk, in the 78th.
	   Thierry Henry then closed out the French celebration, stealing a
ball and driving in before chipping a shot over the defenseless
Vonk.
	   One of the few highlights early in the day came when Chilavert
forced his Bulgarian counterpart, Zdravko Zdravkov, into a leaping
save on a 25-meter free kick in the 78th minute.
	   The flamboyant Chilavert curled his left-footed free kick over
the wall that Zdravkov parried away as it headed for just under the
crossbar.
	   ``I already saw the ball in the net,'' said Chilavert, who has
35 goals in his professional career and was within an outstretched
hand of becoming the first goalkeeper score a goal in the World
Cup. ``Too bad, I could have made history.''
	   Otherwise the match was a series of missed opportunities.
	   Hristo Stoichkov put Bulgaria's best chance off the right post
with a left-footed shot in the 35th minute.
	   Bulgaria felt it was cheated in the fifth minute when Stoichkov
was upended in the Paraguayan box but Saudi referee Abdul Rahman
Al-Zeid failed to whistle a foul.
	   ``It was a 100 percent penalty,'' Bulgarian coach Hristo Bonev
said. ``We played well in the first half, but our game collapsed in
the second.''
	   Denmark and Saudi Arabia did the Paraguayans and Bulgarians only
one better, a lone tally from Marc Rieper in the 68th minute to
give the Europeans the victory.
	   In Lens, Rieper came from his backline position to head in a
cross Brian Laudrup from eight meters and give the Danes victory in
a match the Scandinavians could have won by a larger margin.
	   Michael Schjonberg forced Saudi keeper Mohammed Al Deayea to
make a scrambling, diving save and then substitute Per Frandsen
fired across the face of the goal as the Danes pressed for a second
goal.
	   The Saudis created few opportunities in the opening 40 minutes,
but forced Schmeichel into a fingertip save from a free kick by
Saeed Owairan just before the break.
	   In the meantime, FIFA spent the day trying to ward off an own
goal.
	   In a growing scandal that started with Japanese fans a day
before, the world body was investigating two national federations
and a subsidiary of its own marketing arm regarding game ticket
fraud at the World Cup.
	   FIFA said it has warned fans not to deal with anyone but
licensed ticket operators.
	   ``There's some confusion here, and that is creating excuses for
the operators,'' said Isabelle Delaye, the French organizing
committee's ticket chief. ``We should criticize them. They found
the ideal way of making money, by deceiving people.''
	   Acting FIFA general secretary Michel Zen-Ruffinen said the
organization was probing the improper sale of tickets by soccer
officials in Cameroon and an unnamed South American country. French
news reports said it was Colombia, but Colombian federation has
denied it is involved.
	   FIFA also was looking inside its own house. A representative of
ISL France ``apparently sold tickets he did not have to
individuals.'' The company is the French arm of Swiss giant ISL,
which handles FIFA's negotiations on sponsors and television.
	   ``It's a rather serious issue'' involving several thousand
tickets, Zen-Ruffinen said.
	   It seemed like an expansion of an issue which erupted Thursday,
when reports had about 12,000 Japanese fans without tickets from
tour operators.
	   FIFA said it had complaints from fans missing tickets in the
Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, England and Brazil, as well as
Japan.

<TEXT>
	   SLALEY, England (AP) _ Spain's Diego Borrego shot a 65 to take a
one-stroke lead Friday after the first-round of the rain-delayed
European Grand Prix.
	   Only half of the 156-man field played the round with the other
half schedule to begin play early Saturday in the 650,000-pound
(dlrs 1.06 million) European Tour event.
	   England's Jon Robson, two Swedes _ Mats Hallberg and Pierre
Fulke _ and German Sven Struver shot 66.
	   Officials went to unusual lengths to start things after all play
Thursday was washed out by torrential rain.
	   After waiting until mid-afternoon Friday for the rain to stop,
play was begun with the Slaley Hall course reconfigured to a par-69
instead of the usual par-72.
	   Officials reduced the pars on the 12th, 13th and 18th holes. The
tees on those three were brought forward to assure tee shots would
clear bog-like areas on the fairways.
	   Officials planned to complete the first round Saturday, play the
second later in the day and _ if weather permits _ conclude the
tournament Sunday after only 54 holes.

	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Albania and Macedonia on Friday hastily
approved NATO exercises that will allow Alliance planes to fly
simulated bombing raids over the two Balkan countries in an effort
to halt violence in neighboring Kosovo.
	   Albania, which has for weeks sought NATO action to stem
bloodshed in Serbia's secessionist province, swiftly agreed to make
air space and airfields available.
	   Macedonia's government met late into the night. But a statement
issued around 11 p.m. (2100 GMT) said it had received a NATO
request for one exercise consisting of ``a flyover through
Macedonia's airspace.''
	   ``Any new request in the future will be considered separately,''
it added.
	   Macedonia's Defense Minister Blagoj Handziski had earlier
stressed to reporters that his country would not allow itself to be
used for any military intervention against a neighbor.
	   Macedonia's Slav majority has closer ties to the Yugoslavs than
to Kosovo's Albanians. But Macedonia's sizeable ethnic Albanian
minority is naturally bound to kin in Kosovo and Albania.
	   Every Macedonian is deeply aware that ethnic conflict there can
lead to a break-up of their small, young country of just under 2
million, possibly sparking a wider Balkan conflict.
	   The government statement made no mention of a special session of
parliament to approve the NATO maneuvers.
	   Macedonia is a member of Partnership for Peace, the waiting room
for east European countries seeking Alliance membership, and its
approval had been expected.
	   Macedonia's prime minister visits Tirana this weekend to discuss
the Kosovo conflict with Albanian counterpart Fatos Nano, who
announced his Cabinet approved the NATO maneuvers Friday.
	   ``We are convinced that the crisis in Kosovo is not only a
problem for Albania,'' Nano said. Macedonia ``is also interested in
regional stability ... and I hope that they will not try to keep
their country artificially out of the crisis when the crisis is at
its door.''

 &UR; With Mexico-Chiapas &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ International observers and Mexican
opposition groups demanded Friday that the government show it truly
wants to resolve rebel conflicts through talks rather than violence
in the wake of a deadly raid this week in Chiapas.
	   The calls came as President Ernesto Zedillo toured Chiapas,
Mexico's southernmost state, where he insisted that his
administration would like the leftist Zapatista rebels to restart
negotiations that broke down in 1996.
	   On Wednesday, soldiers and police raided an Indian village in
the Chiapas municipality of El Bosque to break up a symbolic town
council supportive of the Zapatistas. Nine people were killed,
including a police officer, in what was one of the most serious
skirmishes of the 4-year-old conflict.
	   The United Nations high commissioner for human rights, Mary
Robinson, said Wednesday's raid and other recent violence in
Chiapas ``are serious violations of the rights of indigenous
people'' and urged the government to resume a dialogue.
	   ``A reduction in the military presence in the region could be an
important first step in restoring confidence that a peaceful
solution might be found,'' she said in a statement from Geneva.
	   Mexico has sent thousands of soldiers to Chiapas since Zapatista
rebels took up arms on Jan. 1, 1994, to demand greater rights and
democracy for Mexico's impoverished Indians.
	   Last week, an army patrol clashed with a separate rebel group in
the southwestern state of Guerrero. The shootout killed 11 people,
all apparently members of the leftist Popular Revolutionary Army,
which rose up briefly in 1996 demanding political and social
reform.
	   Amnesty International denounced the recent clashes, saying the
escalating violence threatened to degenerate into a ``human rights
catastrophe.''
	   ``While some of the dead may have been armed insurgents, we
suspect that others are civilians who have been killed by
government soldiers,'' the London-based human rights group said in
a statement. It called for independent autopsies to determine the
circumstances of the killings.
	   Amnesty said government actions to break up symbolic pro-rebel
town councils in Chiapas have been used as a ``pretext for
widespread arbitrary detentions'' that have fueled insecurity in
opposition areas.
	   The leftist Democratic Revolution Party threatened to abandon
talks on federal political reform unless the government returned to
peaceful negotiations with the rebels. The party was organizing a
protest Friday night in Mexico City.
	   After Wednesday's raid, the conservative National Action Party
also urged Zedillo's government to reestablish negotiations in
Chiapas.

	   COCKBURN TOWN, Turks and Caicos (AP) _ Examinations of the
bodies of six Haitian refugees who drowned Monday when their sloop
capsized off the Turks and Caicos islands showed they did not have
gunshot wounds, police said.
	   Some of the survivors of the shipwreck said marine police had
fired at the boat. But police said warning shots were fired in the
air, but not at the overcrowded boat, Deputy Police Commissioner
Bryan Davies said Friday.
	   Emma Lou, a pathologist with the Dade County Coroners Office in
Florida, was brought in to examine the bodies of the victims.
	   The sunken boat has been raised and will also be examined by
police, Davies said.
	   The 70 Haitians who survived the sinking are being interviewed
with the help of interpreters and also spent more than an hour
Thursday talking with a representative from the Haitian consulate
in the Bahamas.
	   The ship sank Monday just 15 miles off Providenciales, the
largest island in the British archipelago 600 miles southeast of
Florida.
	   Survivors said as many as 113 people were on the boat, but
police said there were about 70 survivors and six bodies recovered.
	   Davies said police also want to interview the occupants of two
sailing yachts that may have been near the incident. The names of
the vessels are unknown, but some survivors said they were flying
U.S. flags.
	   Thousands of Haitian refugees fleeing their impoverished country
have ended up in the Turks and Caicos islands in recent years.

 &UR; Eds: LEADS to UPDATE with new statements by Netanyahu, RECASTS,
 &UR; By JACK KATZENELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Friday
challenged the American and Palestinian position that the
Palestinians have accepted a U.S. proposal that they fulfill their
commitments under the Oslo accords in return for an Israeli
withdrawal from 13 percent of the West Bank.
	   Interviewed on Israeli Channel 1 television, Netanyahu said
agreement could be reached but that it depended on the
Palestinians.
	   The reporter pointed out that the Palestinians have agreed to
the American proposal, and Netanyahu retorted: ``That's what you
say.''
	   Netanyahu implied that the Palestinians' assurances _ that they
will abrogate clauses in the Palestinian Covenant calling for the
destruction of Israel and do more to crack down on terrorist groups
_ are too vague.
	   ``I want to see the fulfillment of these promises in practice,
with dates, and the knowledge that the commitments are really being
implemented in a concrete manner,'' Netanyahu said.
	   The U.S. plan, which has not been officially announced although
many of its details have been disclosed, is an attempt by the
Americans to re-start the peace process that broke down 15 months
ago.
	   In his public statements until now, Netanyahu has rejected the
U.S. proposal for a 13 percent withdrawal from the West Bank, which
Israel captured and occupied in the 1967 Mideast war. He has
reportedly been holding out for nine percent.
	   He has demanded that an agreement also specify the size of the
next withdrawal, which would be the third and last redeployment of
the Oslo interim accord.
	   ``I think ... it will be the last agreement we will make, which
the State of Israel will make, until the completion of the
permanent settlement,'' he said.
	   Netanyahu rejected speculation that he discussed the possibility
of a national unity government Friday when he met Ehud Barak,
leader of the opposition Labor party.
	   Right wing parties in Netanyahu's coalition have threatened to
bring down his government if he carries out any withdrawal in the
West Bank.
	   There was speculation that he met Barak as a hint to the right
wing parties that he has the option of forming an alliance with
Labor, in order to win parliamentary approval for the withdrawal.
	   However Netanyahu insisted he just briefed Barak on the
negotiations with the Palestinians ``I didn't talk to him about a
unity government,'' Netanyahu said.
	   In another U.S. effort to move the process forward, CIA Director
George Tenet met separately this week with Netanyahu and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and reportedly passed messages
about security coordination between the two leaders.
	   Meanwhile, the prospect of holding a national referendum on the
West Bank withdrawal has been gaining momentum in government
circles.

Yassin: Israel will not stop my return to Gaza

 &UR; By JACK KATZENELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Sheik Ahmed Yassin, the spiritual leader of the
militant Palestinian Islamic group Hamas, said Friday he will
return next week to Gaza whether Israel agrees or not.
	   The 61-year-old quadriplegic, whose followers have killed scores
of Israeli civilians in suicide bomb attacks, was allowed to leave
the Gaza Strip for the purpose of receiving medical treatment. But
he seized the opportunity to conduct a three-month fund-raising
trip in the Arab world, reportedly raising over dlrs 20 million.
	   Some Israelis fear the money will be used to finance a new wave
of attacks. The Israeli army's outgoing chief of military
intelligence, Moshe Yaalon, said Friday that Israel's problem lay
in deciding whether Yassin was more dangerous inside the Gaza Strip
or abroad.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told Israeli television
Channel 1 on Friday that he would decide in the next day or two
whether to allow Yassin to return or not.
	   Yassin is currently in the Sudanese capital Khartoum because the
Egyptian government has not yet permitted him to fly to Cairo. In a
satellite interview with Channel 1, Yassin said he would return to
Gaza next week, ``God willing.''
	   ``I left Gaza by the front door. ... I left with official and
legal permission and therefore neither Israel nor any other entity
can prevent me from returning to my home and my family,'' he said
in a second interview with Israeli Channel 2 television.
	   He stressed that he would continue to fight Israel whether he is
at home or abroad. Hamas is opposed to peace with Israel and sees
the whole of Israel as occupied Palestinian land. ``I am fighting
the occupation, and it is my right to fight it,'' he said.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has said repeatedly he is doing
all he can to prevent attacks by Hamas and other militant groups
against Israel, but he insists that under the Oslo agreements
Israel has no right to prevent Yassin's return.
	   ``This would be a violation of what has been agreed and what has
been signed,'' he told reporters earlier this week.
	   Yassin planned to camp out at Egypt's border with the Gaza Strip
if Israel refuses to allow his return, the London-based Al-Hayat
newspaper reported Friday.
	   He would stay there until Israel's policy had been exposed to
the world, the paper quoted a Hamas official as saying.
	   Yassin was freed from an Israeli jail last fall in exchange for
the freedom of two Israeli spies captured in Jordan during a
bungled assassination attempt against another Hamas leader.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Down 2-0 to the Detroit Red Wings isn't the
Washington Capitals most immediate problem.
	   It's how they lost Game 2 of the Stanley Cup final Thursday
night.
	   Not only did they blow two, two-goal leads in the third period
and lose 5-4 in overtime, but they lost most of the battles against
the boards, never physically challenged the Red Wings, allowed 60
shots against goaltender Olaf Kolzig and didn't pay the price
needed to win an entertaining, wide-open game.
	   Now, the Caps will have to bounce back as they promised in the
wee hours of Friday.
	   Working in their favor will be having Game 3 at the MCI Center
Saturday night, the first time a Cup Final has been played in the
U.S. capital.
	   ``We have been a resilient team all season, and yeah, it's going
to be tough to bounce back,'' Capitals coach Ron Wilson said
Friday, after an optional workout at the team's practice facility
at Odenton, Maryland.
	   ``That is tough psychologically to have a two-goal lead in the
third period and to lose in overtime the way we did, but I trust
that we will be bounce back. We've faced a lot of adversity
throughout the season and this is the ultimate test, to have that
kind of game and let it slip through your hands.''
	   What the Caps have consistenly overcome in Wilson's first season
as coach is injuries. The team lost 476 man-games to injury, a club
record.
	   However, overcoming a Red Wings' club focused on winning its
second straight Stanley Cup will take a lot more.
	   Detroit is unbeaten in nine straight against Washington dating
to the 1993-94 season. In the wins in this series, the Red Wings
got the victory in different ways.
	   On Tuesday, they grabbed a quick 2-0 and let goaltender Chris
Osgood hold off the Capitals. Two nights later, it was a great
third-period comeback, then the game-winner by Kris Draper in
overtime, his first of the playoffs.
	   ``We're a very confident team and it has nothing to do with us
being up 2-0,'' Red Wings forward Joe Kocur said. ``From what we
did last year and what we have done this year, there is an aura of
confidence that we feel every game, whether we're up 2-0 here or
down 2-1 playing in Phoenix. We feel we have the guns to do it.''
	   Capitals captain Dale Hunter said it was frustrating blowing the
lead Thursday night and falling behind 2-0. However, he looked more
to the positives, the fact that both games were decided on the road
by a goal.
	   ``We have to come home and play well in our own rink and do what
they did,' Hunter said. ``They won twice in their rink. They kept
home ice and we just have to win in our own rink.''
	   The Red Wings may be shorthanded for Game 3. Left wing
Vyacheslav Kozlov sustained a charley horse in his left leg when
hit by Capitals defenseman Sergei Gonchar.
	   Kozlov plans to test the leg during Saturday morning's skate. If
he is unable to play, Mathieu Dandenault will make his first
appearance in the series.
	   Game 3 will be played on the first anniversary of the limousine
crash that seriously injured Red Wings defenseman Vladimir
Konstantinov and massage therapist Sergei Mnatsakanov, just six
days after Detroit won the Cup last year.

Maradona receives two-year suspended sentence in 1994 incident
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ Diego Maradona received a
two-year suspended sentence for a 1994 shooting incident involving
four journalists, a local news agency said Friday.
	   Maradona was found guilty of assault with a weapon, Hugo Wortman
told the independent Diarios y Noticias.
	   The case involved a February 1994 incident when he fired an air
rifle at photographers and journalists outside his country home.
	   Prosecutors had sought a four-year sentence and rejected an
offer by the soccer star to do community service.
	   The judge's ruling clears the way for the former Argentine
national team captain to travel to France for the World Cup.
	   While there, Maradona is expected to serve as a color
commentator for several television networks covering the month-long
competition.

Albania and Macedonia will offer space for NATO drills

 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES with Macedonian government approving NATO
exercise. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Albania and Macedonia on Friday hastily
approved NATO exercises that will allow Alliance planes to fly
simulated bombing raids over the two Balkan countries in an effort
to halt violence in neighboring Kosovo.
	   Albania, which has for weeks sought NATO action to stem
bloodshed in Serbia's secessionist Kosovo province, swiftly agreed
to make air space and airfields available.
	   Macedonia's government met late into the night. But a statement
issued around 11 p.m. (2100 GMT) said it had received and approved
a NATO request for one exercise consisting of ``a flyover through
Macedonia's airspace.''
	   ``Any new request in the future will be considered separately,''
it added.
	   Macedonia's Defense Minister Blagoj Handziski had earlier
stressed to reporters that his country would not allow itself to be
used for any military intervention against a neighbor.
	   Macedonia's Slav majority has closer ties to the Yugoslavs than
to Kosovo's Albanians. But Macedonia's sizeable ethnic Albanian
minority is naturally bound to kin in Kosovo and Albania.
	   Every Macedonian is deeply aware that ethnic conflict there can
lead to a break-up of their small, young country of just under 2
million, possibly sparking a wider Balkan conflict.
	   The government statement made no mention of a special session of
parliament to approve the NATO maneuvers.
	   Macedonia is a member of Partnership for Peace, a group for east
European countries seeking Alliance membership, and its approval
had been expected.
	   Macedonia's prime minister visits Tirana this weekend to discuss
the Kosovo conflict with Albanian counterpart Fatos Nano, who
announced that his Cabinet approved the NATO maneuvers Friday.

World Cup: Dugarry leads dominating 3-0 French victory
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: Optional; UPDATES with quotes. &QL; 
 &UR; By RAF CASERT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ With three goals and repeated attacks,
France produced the result and the whole host nation had been
hoping for and crushed South Africa 3-0 to stake its claim as a
World Cup favorite.
	   Olympique Marseille's hero Christophe Dugarry scored one goal
and assisted on another and prodigy Thierry Henry weaved through
the South African defense in injury time with a darting run and a
gentle, cunning finish, to top off a dominating performance Friday
night.
	   Marseille's native son Zinedine Zidane led the French forward
throughout the match, and together with his best friend Dugarry,
paced France past an all-important first test.
	   ``The door is wide open now,'' French coach Aime Jacquet said.
``We are really confident.''
	   France moved atop Group C after one round, moving past Denmark,
which beat Saudi Arabia 1-0, on goal difference.
	   Wave after wave of attacks finally paid off in the 34th minute
when a corner from Zidane found Dugarry unmarked in the goalmouth
and the substitute for injured striker Stephane Guivarc'h headed
home off the post to set the crowd of 60,000 alight.
	   In the 78th minute, continuous pressure paid off again, with
Dugarry finding Youri Djorkaeff free in the penalty area and the
forward's shot on goal was deflected by South Africa's Pierre Issa
into his own net.
	   Henry, just 20, then made it a perfect night for France, lifting
the ball over goalkeeper Hans Vonk for his first goal for France.
	   The goals weren't the occasions that caused celebration for the
French, which silenced the critics and sent the crowds into
continuous roars despite the howling winds that beat on this
Mediterranean port throughout the evening.
	   ``We knew we could count on the Marseille crowd,'' Jacquet said.
``It was good soccer in very tough conditions.''
	   South Africa's latest chapter in its sporting history, following
almost three decades on the sidelines of international soccer
because of apartheid, never had any shine.
	   ``We were missing experience and chances to play together. We
played against a great team,'' said South African coach Philippe
Troussier. ``But we did not deserve this kind of result.''
	   The 3-0 was by far the most decisive match in the World Cup so
far.
	   South Africa got its only chance in first half injury time when
Issa, an Olympique Marseille teammate of Dugarry, rose above
Laurent Blanc to meet a free kick from David Nyathi, but his
glancing header went just wide of the post.
	   The only French worry was that for 78 minutes only a single goal
separated the two.
	   South Africa started as promised, with a slew of defenders
refusing to come out of that wall in front of Vonk.
	   France appeared tentative for the first 20 minutes, but slowly
started producing chances in the next 15 minutes with a half dozen
opportunities.
	   Guivarc'h was denied on a break and headed a cross just wide
before he injured his leg and was replaced in the 27th minute by
Dugarry.
	   The 26-year-old Dugarry, who some had said only received his
spot on the French team through his close friendship with Zidane
and was criticized for a string of weak performances, produced
quickly.
	   Seven minutes after entering, Vonk had to come quickly off his
line to block a shot from a charging unmarked Dugarry.
	   Dugarry appeared to get a second goal in the second half, using
the outside of his right foot from 15 meters to put a pass from
Zidane past Vonk, but Brazilian referee Maurizio Rezende earlier
had blown the play dead for a foul.
	   Throughout, South Africa was invisible up front. Even with the
Mistral winds off the Mediterranean in their favor, Marcel Desailly
and Laurent Blanc controlled the central defense and kept the
``Bafana Bafana'' from threatening French keeper Fabien Barthez.
Starting with a defensive mindset, they were unable to adjust after
Dugarry's goal and had no one to inspire them.
	   All through the evening, a strong, blustery wind whipped in from
the Mediterranean, keeping temperatures at a cool 16 degrees
Celsious (61 Fahrenheit) while gusts of up to 80 kph (50 mph)
swirled around the Velodrome stadium.

Ethiopian minister rules out direct negotiations with Eritrea
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Ethiopian quotes after meeting Mubarak

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Ethiopia will not negotiate directly with
Eritrea because it is occupying Ethiopian land, the country's
foreign minister said Friday.
	   Ethiopian Foreign Minister Seyoum Mesfin arrived in Cairo and
held talks with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Foreign
Minister Amr Moussa.
	   Earlier this week, Eritrea asked Egypt to mediate the border war
with Ethiopia that broke out last month.
	   ``Direct negotiations are impossible because it is unacceptable
for someone to come and occupy your territory and tell you: `come
and negotiate with me','' Mesfin told reporters at Cairo airport.
	   ``It is against international law.''
	   After meeting Mubarak, Mesfin said: ``This war is an imposed
(war) from Eritrea.''
	   ``I strongly believe, as (does) my government, that borders
can't be changed by wars, but by peacefull means and
negotiations,'' Mesfin said.
	   The foreign minister said his government supported the
U.S.-Rawandan initiative on solving the conflict, and he called on
African states to back it.
	   Eritrea has rejected the initiative.
	   Moussa told reporters that President Mubarak had urged Mesfin to
avoid confrontation and negotiate to reach a solution.
	   Mesfin's visit comes a day after Abdullah Mahmoud Jaber, an
adviser to Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki, left Cairo after
asking Egypt to mediate in the dispute.
	   Border skirmishes broke out on May 6 when Ethiopia accused
Eritrea of occupying a swath of land along their border. The two
sides differ over where Italy, the former colonial power, drew the
border.
	   Eritrean forces fought a secessionist rebellion against Ethiopia
for 30 years. They realized their aims in 1993, two years after
helping Ethiopian rebels under Meles Zenawi, the current president,
overthrow the former Addis Ababa government.

	   ADIGRAT, Ethiopia (AP) _ The guns lay quiet in the
Ethiopia-Eritrea conflict Friday, but the two countries'
governments continued their verbal salvos, blaming each other for
the escalating clashes.
	   Ethiopian residents fled the northern town of Adigrat after
Eritrean helicopters and planes bombed the town Thursday killing
four civilians and wounding 30.
	   U.S. and Rwandan diplomats were shuttling between the Ethiopian
capital Addis Ababa and the Eritrean capital Asmara to try to help
resolve the conflict.
	   In Adigrat, about 20 kilometers (12 miles) from the embattled
Ethiopian border town of Zala Ambessa, residents hastily buried two
victims of Thursday's bombing raid before dawn so they could leave
town. The other two were so disfigured they could not be
identified, according to Netsanet Asfaw, a local government
spokeswoman.
	   Wounded still filled beds lining the corridors of Adigrat's
hospital, where over 100 wounded soldiers are also being treated.
	   Dozens of residents fled to outlying villages Friday fearing
further shelling, and all businesses were closed in a sign of
mourning.
	   Neither side reported new clashes on Friday.
	   The Ethiopian army poured reinforcements into the front lines
south of Zala Ambessa Friday, 10 days after Eritreans captured the
town. Col. Ephrem Bengee, a commander in the area said he expected
a fresh Eritrean offensive there after a lull of several days.
	   Eritrea too has added large numbers of troops and heavy weapons
to its positions near Zala Ambessa.

<TEXT>
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) _ For a while, the inability of anyone to
dominate the four major golf championships was because no single
great player had emerged. Going into the U.S. Open, the lack of a
dominating golfer seems to be because there are too many great
players _ especially young ones.
	   The last 14 major championships were won by 14 different players
and nine of those won their first _ and so far only _ major.
	   Even Tiger Woods, whose 12-stroke victory in the 1997 Masters
had people talking Grand Slam, has not been able to dominate. In
fact, he has not made a real run at a major title since winning the
Masters.
	   ``I think it's going to be very common to have four different
major winners in a year,'' said Davis Love III, winner of the PGA
Championship last year.
	   The reason is clear. After a search for several years for the
next Jack Nicklaus or Tom Watson, golf found not one but a slew of
players wanting the title of best in the world.
	   As Thursday's first round of the U.S. Open at The Olympic Club
nears, many players are near the top of their game.
	   Woods, two-time U.S. Open winner Ernie Els, British Open
champion Justin Leonard, Phil Mickelson, David Duval, Australian
Stuart Appleby and Lee Westwood of England have all won this year
and all are 28 or younger.
	   Throw in Love, Masters winner Mark O'Meara, two-time PGA Tour
winner Fred Couples, Colin Montgomerie and a revitalized Watson,
and the Open field is very deep.
	   ``If you ask me who is playing the best right now going into the
Open, I'd have to say Duval and Couples,'' Love said.
	   He also thinks Els has a chance to become the first player to
successfully defend the U.S. Open title since Curtis Strange did it
in 1989.
	   ``He hits it straight and he's a great putter,'' Love said.
``For a long hitter he's very patient. He's always going to do well
on a U.S. Open-type course.''
	   Woods, Els, Love and Couples come into Olympic with health
questions. Woods withdrew from Kemper and Els pulled out of the
Buick Classic, both with back problems. But it's also possible they
withdrew mostly because they wanted to have a more leisurely _ and
less stressful on the back _ travel schedule to California and a
more relaxed practice routine.
	   The fact that both Woods and Els withdrew a week apart could
indicate the threat of back problems to the great young golfers. Or
it could indicate how intent the two of them are on playing well at
Olympic.
	   Love, who played three very good rounds at the Memorial
Tournament before fading on Sunday, and Couples seem to have their
bad backs under control.
	   In fact, Couples has found an inner peace during a series of
personal problems _ including the death of his father and his
girlfriend's breast cancer _ to play his best golf since 1992.
	   Woods, whose game has been much more consistent but not as
spectacular as last year, feels he has an advantage at Olympic
because he knows the course very well.
	   ``We used to play there nearly every Monday,'' he said about his
college team at Stanford.
	   Still, Woods will have to deal with another one of his problem
courses _ one where he cannot hit the driver very often.
	   ``There are a lot of doglegs at Olympic,'' Woods said. ``There
will be a lot of 2-irons off the tee.''
	   And when the driver has to stay in his bag Woods loses his
biggest advantage.
	   Montgomerie, Duval and Mickelson come into the Open with the
burden of trying to claim their first major championship.
	   At almost 35, Montgomerie is under the most pressure, especially
since his accurate game seems perfect for the U.S. Open, a fact
proven by his two second-place and one third-place finish.
	   Mickelson turns 28 on June 16 but his 12 career victories and
five full seasons on the PGA Tour leave people wondering when he
will get a major title.
	   Duval has less pressure. He is just 26 and his breakthrough
victory came last October. Since then he has won five times and is
the hottest player in the world.
	   He has also developed the confidence and grind-it-out attitude
it takes to win a U.S. Open.
	   Another young guy with a perfect game for the tight fairways,
high rough and fast greens of a U.S. Open venue is Jim Furyk. The
28-year-old is in that group of young players along with Appleby
and Westwood just a notch below Woods, Els, Leonard, Duval and
Mickelson.

Forget the left-wing lock, Red Wings like wide-open game
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TOM CANAVAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Game 2 of the Stanley Cup finals was one of
the most entertaining hockey games of the season.
	   Detroit's 5-4 overtime victory featured 93 shots, dozens of
great scoring chances, super goaltending by Washington's Olaf
Kolzig and the Detroit's Chris Osgood and almost non-stop action
from the third period on.
	   The fantastic finish came when Kris Draper scored with 4:36 left
in the first overtime period.
	   Asked if he liked the wide-open game more than the Red Wings'
left-wing lock defensive style, captain Steve Yzerman was honest.
	   ``It is the way we like to play,' Yzerman said. ``Our coach
doesn't care for it.''
	   Red Wings coach Scotty Bowman said that's for sure. His favorite
period on Thursday was the first. Detroit led 1-0.
	   ``Most of the guys felt this was their best period of the
playoffs,'' he said.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; INJURIES: &LR;  Washington defenseman Jeff Brown probably won't play
in Game 3 on Saturday and he may be out for the playoffs, coach Ron
Wilson said.
	   Brown has had a problem with post-concussion syndrome and he
felt nauseated after the second period Thursday night. The illness
forced Wilson to use only four defensemen the rest of the way.
	   ``I can't imagine that he would be able to play the rest of the
series, to be honest with you,'' Wilson said.
	   Detroit also may be shorthanded with left wing Vyacheslav Kozlov
(six goals, seven assists) nursing a charley horse from late in the
second period of Game 2.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; CUP NUMBERS: &LR;  The Red Wings were the first team to overcome a
two-goal deficit in the third period of the Stanley Cup finals
since Montreal in 1956. Over that 42-year span, clubs leading by
two goals or more in the third period had won 89 consecutive times.
	   Detroit was the first team in finals history to overcome two
two-goal deficits in the third period.
	   The Red Wings' 60 shots in Game 2 were the second-highest total
by one club in a finals game since 1968. The only club to have more
shots on goal was the Florida Panthers (63) in a triple overtime
loss to Colorado in Game 4 of the 1996 finals.
	   Since expansion in 1968, 13 defending champions have reached the
finals the following season. They have posted an 11-2 record with
the only losers being the New York Islanders in 1984 to Edmonton
and the Philadelphia Flyers in 1976 to Montreal.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; POSITIVE THINKING: &LR;  Washington coach Ron Wilson found something
positive being down 2-0 in the best-of-7 Stanley Cup finals to the
defending champion Detroit Red Wings.
	   The Caps have a history of blowing 3-1 leads in playoffs.
	   ``One thing for sure, we can't blow a 3-1 lead,'' he said.
	   Wilson even saw an irony.
	   ``They have got a 3-1 lead. I am talking about, and maybe we
will find ourselves down 3-1 and come back,'' Wilson said. ``Maybe
this is the ultimate way to bury everything from the past.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; KOZLOV???: &LR;  If Vyacheslav Kozlov can't play because of a leg
injury received in Game 2, it is expected that Mathieu Dandenault
will get to play for the first time since the opening round of the
playoffs.
	   It would also be the 22-year-old's first appearance in a Cup
final.
	   ``I have been waiting for this for three years,'' he said. ``It
would be like living a dream. Watching these guys and getting ready
for practice with these guys _ get me in there.''

World Cup: For South Africa, being there is what mattered

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MARSEILLES, France (AP) _ For South Africa, just being there
Friday night was all that mattered.
	   Never mind that host France outclassed the defensive-minded
Bafana Bafana, who were playing their nation's first World Cup game
in the pressure cooker of a packed Marseilles stadium before a
global television audience.
	   There will be other World Cups, more chances to shine across the
planet and create dreams for those back home. Friday's inaugural
appearance in soccer's biggest tournament was a coming of age for
players, fans and a nation that has long-thirsted for recognition,
and even more, acceptance.
	   Deputy President Thabo Mbeki, the heir apparent to Nelson
Mandela, was there, sitting with French Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin and World Cup organizing committee chairman Michel Platini.
	   Since arriving in France on Sunday, the players have been
reminded over and over that the bad old days of apartheid and
international isolation were gone. In Vichy, the central town where
they train, residents have welcomed them warmly, seeking autographs
at every chance.
	   Back home, the significance is even greater. South Africa has
enjoyed lots of sports success since its return to the
international arena in the early 1990s. Ernie Els has won two U.S.
Opens in golf, while Josia Thugwane was the Olympic marathon
champion and Penny Heyns won two swimming gold medals in Atlanta
two years ago. The rugby Springboks won their World Cup at home in
1995.
	   But soccer is the national sport, followed and played zealously
by most of the black majority. For 28 years, until 1992, South
Africa was banned from international soccer because of apartheid
and its players and fans could only wonder what a World Cup was
like.
	   Now they know.
	   French fans belted out a stirring ``La Marseillaise'' and the
French players responded, attacking the South Africans for most of
the first half and going ahead on a 35th minute header by
Christophe Dugarry.
	   South Africa lacked the speed and strength to win battles for
the ball, and its defensive shell allowed France to control play
and score twice more in the second half for a 3-0 victory.
	   ``I'm obviously disappointed but its not the end of the world,''
defender Mark Fish said. He could have been speaking for the
hundreds of flag-waving, singing South African fans, who had waited
a lifetime for Friday night.
	   Shipping company official Phillip Malebe, 44, of Johannesburg
said he was amazed at how the event brought South Africans of all
colors and backgrounds together.
	   ``The fact is we are here. They brought us all here,'' said
Malebe, who wore a South African jersey. ``I've seen the beautiful
rainbow nation, all colors, singing our song. We were singing
together, we were passing drinks mouth-to-mouth. ... Just to be
here, we don't need the Cup.''

Swiss Jewish newspapers denounce U.S.-based report for absurdity
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with new grafs 9-10 grafs to ADD comment from
Wiesenthal Center &QL; 
 &UR; By ALEXANDER G. HIGGINS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ A Jewish newspaper in Switzerland disputed a new
report that alleges Swiss leaders were pro-Nazi during World War
II, charging Friday that the study distorted the strength of a
movement supporting the Third Reich.
	   The newspaper, the Israelitisches Wochenblatt, alleged the study
issued in New York by the Simon Wiesenthal Center, ``deliberately
suppressed the strong anti-Nazi movement in Switzerland.''
	   The center's report alleged Switzerland was ``thoroughly
saturated'' with right-wing groups claiming tens of thousands of
members during the war.
	   The paper joined the country's other Jewish weekly in attacking
the study. The Basel-based Juedische Rundschau on Thursday
described the study as full of ``exaggerations and
falsifications.''
	   The Israelitisches Wochenblatt, published in Zurich, said the
report made it easy for nationalist Swiss to reject efforts to make
good on any wrongs committed during World War II.
	   The newspaper said that while the Nazis had a well-organized
network of largely secret organizations in neutral Switzerland
preparing to include the country in the Third Reich, the movement
had to be put in proportion.
	   ``The Swiss Nazis were weak in numbers,'' said the weekly. ``In
the parliament in Bern they had exactly one seat for four years.''
	   ``If Swiss society were really so saturated with Nazis, that
would have had to be reflected in parliamentary elections,'' it
added.
	   The center's dean and founder, Rabbi Marvin Hier, disputed the
newspaper reports, saying that their report was an assessment of
the right-wing groups, not a broader indictment.
	   ``This report is not about the Swiss people of the World War II
or about the Swiss people of today,'' Hier said. ``It is about the
Swiss government of World War II.''
	   The Zurich newspaper said the distortions will make it difficult
to examine the repetition of allegations it described as being more
worthy of study, such as the long-standing charge that the Swiss
government had an anti-Jewish policy during World War II.
	   The Juedische Rundschau said author Alan Morris Schom's report
starts with errors in the first paragraph, which incorrectly states
that the Swiss cantons (states) in World War II numbered 21, when
there were actually 22.
	   ``So many details are presented painfully wrong,'' said the
Juedische Rundschau, which earlier this year led Swiss Jewish
criticism of a report by Schom asserting Switzerland put Jewish
refugees in slave labor camps.
	   On Wednesday, the U.S. State Department also disputed the
charges in Schom's new report, noting that Switzerland provided
shelter for 50,000 Jewish refugees.

Britain reconsiders medic practice on pigs in NATO exercise
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Britain has suspended its participation in a NATO
exercise in which pigs are shot to provide field practice for
medics, the Defense Ministry said Friday.
	   Armed Forces Minister John Reid has ordered a review of the
annual exercise that takes place in Denmark, after it was brought
to his attention that live pigs were being shot, a department
spokeswoman said on customary condition of anomynity.
	   She said a small team of British medics _ '' about four'' _ had
participated previously in the exercise, which is designed to allow
them to practice medical techniques.
	   Now, she said, British participation is being suspended while
the department determines if the exercise is really necessary.
	   A Scottish newspaper reported Wednesday that animal welfare
groups condemned lthe exercises in which live pigs were strung up
and shot with a variety of weapons to allow military doctors to
simulate the treatment of gunshot wounds.
	   The animals are sedated and anesthetised, then tied with ropes
to a wooden frame and fired at from short and long range, The
Scotsman newspaper said. After treatment, they are killed. Pigs
reportedly are used becausse their organs are similar to those of
humans.
	   The British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection was quoted as
calling the exercise ``morally abhorrent.''
	   ``We would be very disappointed if this is happening,'' Julie
Briggs, spokeswoman for the Royal Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals, was quoted as saying. ``It is very difficult to
ensure that the animals are not suffering any pain.''
	   The Scotsman quoted Jens Mossing, manager of the Danish animal
welfare agency Vrn For Vrrgeloese, as saying he thought the tests
had stopped in the 1980s after protests from Danish animal groups,
and that it had been very difficult to prove the exercises were
cruel.
	   The newspaper quoted an unidentified British Defense Ministry
spokesman as saying service personnel had taken part for several
years in the NATO-run course and that all procedures were conducted
under veterinary and animal welfare supervision.
	   It also quoted Capt. Paul Grooss, military attache at the Danish
Embassy in London, as saying the exercises had been taking place
for more than 20 years: ``We know this is a very sensitive field,
and people could argue that it is cruel for the animals, but it is
not something that is done for fun.''

	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ With his forces shooting into the air,
firing tear gas and briefly detaining a leading dissident,
Nigeria's new military boss sent a clear signal Friday to his
myriad opponents: Muscle still rules this junta-weary country.
	   Opposition activists demanding an end to military rule took to
the streets in a planned mass protest, but they were quickly
confronted by a wall of police and soldiers in Lagos, Nigeria's
commercial hub.
	   Faced with his first major test _ the prospect of defiant
opposition _ Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar responded with enough force
to quell any hopes of a meaningful anti-government demonstration.
	   Police arrested Gani Fawehinmi, a lawyer and leading dissident
who organized the protests, and held him for several hours before
he was released on bail. They also arrested Dupe Abiola, one of the
wives of imprisoned businessman Moshood Abiola, the presumed winner
of canceled 1993 elections. She too was later released, along with
five other people also arrested.
	   ``This new government shows signs of repression reminiscent of
Gen. Sani Abacha's diabolical regime,'' Fawehinmi said in an
interview after his release. ``It appears nothing has changed.''
	   However, some democracy supporters saw hope in what had happened
_ notably that the arrested people were eventually freed. During
the Abacha years, people arrested would often disappear for months,
languishing in Nigerian prisons.
	   ``I think it's a good sign,'' said Clement Nwankwo, a prominent
human rights lawyer, adding that the prisoners may have been freed
as a signal to pro-democracy activists that things have changed
under Abubakar.

	   LAS MARGARITAS, Mexico (AP) _ Amid fears of renewed war between
Zapatista rebels and the government, Mexico's president flew to
Chiapas on Friday to defend his administration's stated desire for
dialogue and pledge money for towns where rebel support runs high.
	   Some analysts say a police and army raid on an Indian village
this week is the latest indication that the government has chosen
military might over talks.
	   But President Ernesto Zedillo told residents in Las Margaritas,
85 miles southeast of the state capital, Tuxtla Gutierrez, that the
government's goal is negotiation.
	   ``We want dialogue. We don't want to defeat anyone. The
government will not abandon this position,'' he said. Zedillo was
making his fourth visit to Chiapas in just over a month.
	   In Mexico City, the government's chief negotiator Emilio Rabasa
Gamboa asked a mediation group of legislators to help the
government set up a direct dialogue with the Zapatistas, the
government news agency Notimex reported.
	   As Zedillo spoke in Chiapas, about a dozen people unfurled
banners demanding a halt to violence. ``Senor Zedillo, we do not
want more war,'' one said.
	   Guadalupe Gonzalez, 33, held up a sign reading ``Senor Zedillo,
we want respect for our human rights,'' and said she is not sure
the government still wants to negotiate.
	   ``There is much repression. There is not much freedom of
expression,'' she said.
	   On Wednesday, government forces clashed with apparent Zapatista
rebels in the municipality of El Bosque as they tried to evict a
symbolic pro-rebel town council.
	   The clash, which killed nine people, was the first direct
skirmish between the two sides since peace talks broke down nearly
two years ago. The Zapatistas took up arms in 1994 to demand
greater democracy and Indian rights.
	   The dead included a 1-year-old child and a woman who supported
Zedillo's ruling party, according to a statement that the symbolic
town council issued Friday.
	   Some analysts said the government's tactics signaled that
officials have given up the idea of restarting talks and are
focusing instead on isolating the rebels from their civilian
supporters.
	   ``They have decided not to continue with negotiations, but they
can't say that because public opinion is in favor of resolving the
Chiapas problem through negotiations,'' said Lorenzo Meyer, a
political historian in Mexico City.
	   The U.N. high commissioner for human rights, Mary Robinson,
urged the government Friday to resume dialogue, calling Wednesday's
raid and other recent violence in Chiapas ``serious violations of
the rights of indigenous people.''
	   Amnesty International also denounced the raid and a clash
between soldiers and apparent rebels in Guerrero state which left
11 people dead last week.
	   Mexico's leading opposition parties, the pro-business National
Action Party and the leftist Democratic Revolution Party, called on
Zedillo's administration to reestablish talks.
	   In a speech Friday, Chiapas Gov. Roberto Albores Guillen took a
harder line than Zedillo, vowing to continue using force to achieve
what he called the rule of law.
	   ``The return to legality is not negotiable in Chiapas. We are
going to make the law prevail in Chiapas,'' he said.
	   In Las Margaritas, a lowland town where many government
supporters have sought refuge, Zedillo signed an accord granting
aid to 42 municipalities ``that need special attention,'' he said.
The list included all the rebel supporting towns the government has
raided in recent months _ including El Bosque.
	   The towns will receive dlrs 290 million this year for schools,
health clinics, water purification plants and roads.

Kasparov beats Topalov in tie-break after drawing computer-aided
</HEADLINE>
chess competition &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LEON, Spain (AP) _ World chess champion Garry Kasparov of Russia
beat Bulgarian Grand Master Veselin Topalov Friday in an all-human
match after their computer-assisted chess challenge ended in
stalemate.
	   Kasparov's tie-break victory came on the fourth game, after he
won the first, lost the second and drew the third.
	   Both players had won two, lost two and drawn two of the six
prior games in which they had been permitted to consult moves with
the Chessmaster 5500 program, designed by the U.S. company
Mindscape.
	   Two games were played each day in the three-day experimental
competition that sought to eliminate human error while retaining
human imagination and flare.
	   Topalov had gone into Friday's matches one point down, but the
Bulgarian, playing the black pieces, came back with a win in a
tense match in which being two pawns up proved worth exposing his
king at the center of the board.
	   In the final game Kasparov, playing black, held his young
challenger to a draw and both players were level playing with three
points each.
	   No title was at stake in the challenge dubbed ``chess of the
future'' that was held in this northern Spanish city.
	   Kasparov's tie-break victory earned him dlrs 6,600 and Topalov
got a compensation dlrs 3,000.
	   Without computers, Topalov, 23, the world's No. 4, has now
defeated Kasparov three times and lost eight of the 19 games they
have played. The remainder were draws.
	   Despite being barred from professional competitions, computers
have come to dominate the chess world over the last quarter
century.
	   Modern programs, many of them designed under Kasparov's
guidance, have grown capable of beating most humans, including
Kasparov himself.
	   Kasparov is considered the world's top chess player, although
fellow Russian Anatoly Karpov is the reigning champion of the World
Chess Federation.

De La Hoya on a mission to revive boxing
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TIM DAHLBERG &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   EL PASO, Texas (AP) _ Oscar De La Hoya won four championships
and became a multimillionaire before he was 25. Now he has a more
lofty goal _ resurrecting the sport of boxing.
	   If the fans of El Paso are any indication, he's well on his way.
	   Some 50,000 people are expected Saturday night to watch De La
Hoya defend the WBC welterweight championship against France's
Patrick Charpentier _ the biggest crowd to watch a fight in the
United States since Muhammad Ali fought Leon Spinks before 71,000
20 years ago at New Orleans.
	   It's an impressive display of drawing power for what figures to
be little more than a good workout for De La Hoya before he moves
on to bigger fights against Julio Cesar Chavez and Felix Trinidad.
	   ``It goes to show you that boxing is revived because of my
presence,'' De La Hoya said. ``I've done a lot for boxing and have
a good image. But I'm a bit surprised that 50,000 people will be
there.''
	   With Mike Tyson sidelined, De La Hoya is the premier attraction
in boxing, a welterweight who makes heavyweight dollars.
	   He'll make dlrs 4 million of them against Charpentier, adding to
a bank account that swelled by about dlrs 33 million last year when
he fought five title fights in two weight divisions.
	   ``He's the biggest star in boxing by far, and that's almost
unheard of outside of heavyweights,'' promoter Bob Arum said.
	   De La Hoya will fight for the first time in six months when he
meets Charpentier, the No. 1 challenger, in a scheduled 12-round
fight in the Sun Bowl.
	   The champion weighed in at the class limit of 147 pounds (66.2
kg) Friday, while Charpentier weighed 146 pounds (65.7 kg).
	   Charpentier, who has fought only once outside of France, wasn't
De La Hoya's first pick for the fight. But he is the top-ranked
challenger, and the WBC mandated the bout if De La Hoya wanted to
retain the title.
	   ``You've got to fight these guys,'' De La Hoya said. ``Even when
I fight these guys, there's always people that want to see somebody
on top lose.''
	   The fans who have screamed De La Hoya's name since he arrived in
this border city on Tuesday aren't among those. And few in boxing
give the little-known Charpentier much of a chance to pull an
upset.
	   A 20-1 underdog, Charpentier is a straight-ahead fighter, a
style that De La Hoya loves.
	   ``Charpentier will come out for me and go for the knockout,'' De
La Hoya said. ``He's a short, stocky fighter. He can be dangerous
if I stay in front of him, so I have to pick and move.''
	   Charpentier (27-4-1, 23 knockouts) hasn't lost in four years but
never has fought for a title and never fought anyone the caliber of
De La Hoya. He originally was scheduled to fight De La Hoya Feb.
28, but the fight was postponed twice after the champion hurt his
left wrist in training.
	   ``I'm not here to joke,'' Charpentier said. ``I'm here to fight
and I'm taking the title back to France.''
	   If De La Hoya (27-0, 22 knockouts) wins as expected, he plans to
go back to the frantic fight pace that saw him beat Miguel Angel
Gonzalez, Pernell Whitaker and Hector Camacho in the past year.
	   A Sept. 18 rematch against Chavez already is set for Las Vegas,
while a December fight could feature a unification fight with
Trinidad, the IBF welterweight champion.
	   Also on the card is a lightweight title fight between WBC
135-pound (61-kg) champion Stevie Johnston of Denver and No.
1-ranked challenger Cesar Bazan of Mexico City.

U.S. official calls for pragmatism in talks on international court
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ The U.S. ambassador on war crimes
called Friday for a pragmatic approach to next week's international
conference to discuss the establishment of a permanent
international criminal court.
	   Ambassador David Scheffer said debates over the structure of the
court have continued for three years and that ``this is crunch
time.''
	   Envoys from more than 180 countries will try to determine the
court's structure and jurisdiction, among other things, during a
conference in Rome.
	   ``We cannot seek in Rome to create a dream factory of
international criminal law, a theoretically pure institution,'' he
told reporters during a one-day visit.
	   ``What emerges from Rome will be an international court that
satisfies the needs of international criminal justice in our time
and for the next century,'' he added.
	   Scheffer was in The Hague for the inauguration ceremony of the
third courtroom at the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal.
	   That U.N. tribunal was established by the Security Council in
1993, and it is prosecuting serious violations of international
humanitarian law committed since 1991 in the former Yugoslavia.
	   Scheffer said the permanent international criminal court will
deal with ``the most serious commissions'' of crimes.
	   ``You can boil it down to almost mass killings. That's where the
focus of this court needs to be,'' he added.
	   ``You cannot create a court where we are creating a human rights
ombudsman that will have at least the temptation to take any and
all violations of human rights,'' he added.

 &UR; GUYANA: Opposition ousted from Parliament for not attending
sessions &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) _ The representatives of the main
opposition party were kicked out of Parliament after they failed to
attend the minimum number of consecutive sessions, party officials
confirmed Friday.
	   The People's National Congress, which won 25 of the 65 seats in
Parliment in the December general election, had refused to take its
seats. The party has claimed the elections were unfair although two
international groups have said election irregularities were minor.
	   On Thursday, the government told the party to provide the names
of 25 new representatives or the ban on its attendance in
Parliament would continue indefinitely.
 &UR; TURKS AND CAICOS: Police say Haitian refugees who died were not
shot
	   COCKBURN TOWN, Turks and Caicos (AP) _ Examinations of the
bodies of six Haitian refugees who drowned Monday when their sloop
capsized off the Turks and Caicos islands showed they did not have
gunshot wounds, police said.
	   Some of the survivors of the shipwreck said marine police had
fired at the boat. But police said warning shots were fired in the
air, but not at the overcrowded boat, Deputy Police Commissioner
Bryan Davies said Friday.
	   Emma Lou, a pathologist with the Dade County Coroners Office in
Florida, was brought in to examine the bodies of the victims.
	   The sunken boat has been raised and will also be examined by
police, Davies said.
	   The ship sank Monday just 15 miles off Providenciales, the
largest island in the British archipelago 600 miles southeast of
Florida.
 &UR; MARTINIQUE: Banana growers protest crop losses due to strike
	   FORT-DE-FRANCE, Martinique (AP) _ The citizens of this Caribbean
capital awoke Friday to the surprising sight of tons of green
bananas dumped in front of the entrances of some official
buildings.
	   The bananas were left by angry producers during the night as a
protest. Berard Capgras told the Caraibes International radio
station that the bananas were part of the 4,000 tons that producers
have lost since some employees went on strike at the Fort-de-France
harbor recently.
	   Capgras said the banana producers are desperate.
	   ``We want a minimum service at the harbor,'' said Capgras. ``We
are going to lead actions until the authorities find a solution.''
	   Dock workers went on strike recently in support of workers at a
banana farm in the southern town of Francois on this Caribbean
island.
 &UR; JAMAICA: Angry depositors storm meeting
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ Angry depositors stormed a meeting and
forced the retreat of the chief executive officer of one of
Jamaica's failed financial institutions, with some climbing on top
of his car as he sped off.
	   Henry Fullerton, CEO of Caldon Financial Group, came
face-to-face with angry investors Thursday night at a meeting
scheduled to liquidate another company. The hotel management called
police as the protesters forced their way into the meeting and
confronted Fullerton, waving placards and shouting ``We want our
money!''
	   ``You're a damned thief. You're a disgrace to society. If you go
to Timbuktu we are coming there for you,'' one person shouted at
Fullerton.
	   Fullerton agreed in February to voluntarily liquidate the Caldon
Financial Group after months of financial difficulties. The
government spent dlrs 700 million last year to take over numerous
banks and financial institutions in Jamaica to try to avoid a
financial crisis.
 &UR; UNITED STATES: Infamous smuggler may be back on the job
	   WEST PALM BEACH, Florida (AP) _ The man dubbed ``Captain Jump
Off'' for prodding smuggled illegal immigrants to jump from his
boat into choppy surf is a fugitive and could be back in business,
federal officials said.
	   Richard B. Barker, 46, of West Palm Beach, is being sought for
violation of probation after spending less than four years in
prison for the drownings of four Haitians he dropped near the
Martin County coast in 1994.
	   The U.S. Marshal's office said Barker failed to report to his
probation officer and take part in substance-abuse counseling after
his release from prison. An arrest warrant was issued Feb. 20.
	   Barker was convicted Aug. 25, 1994, on four counts of negligent
homicide. Some of the 27 Haitians aboard the 28-foot boat piloted
by Barker said they were ordered to jump off the boat into
neck-high water.

Aoki shoots 10-under 62 for two-stroke lead
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TERESA M. WALKER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NASHVILLE, Tennessee (AP) _ Isao Aoki fixed his putting problems
and tied the course record Friday with a 10-under-par 62 that gave
him a two-stroke lead after the first round of the BellSouth Senior
Classic.
	   Aoki had 10 birdies at the Springhouse Golf Club to match record
set by Dave Stockton at the inaugural tournament here in 1994.
	   Defending champion Gil Morgan finished with a 64, while John
Jacobs, last week's winner, bogeyed No. 18 to finished with a 65.
Hale Irwin and Tom Jenkins each shot a 66.
	   Aoki wasn't happy with himself and his putter following last
weekend's Nationwide Championship where he tied for 17th and didn't
break 70 in three straight rounds.
	   He came into Nashville early and spent Tuesday and Wednesday
practicing his putting. Asked what his problem was, Aoki pointed at
his head.
	   ``Last two weeks I hit the ball good but didn't putt very well.
Today I made some putts,'' he said.
	   Aoki also drove the ball well, starting quickly with five
birdies over the first six holes. His 3-wood on the par-5 opening
hole landed within five feet to set up his first birdie, and he
left himself with putts of four feet and less on five other holes.
	   But he also made 20-footers (7 meters) on Nos. 4 and 13 and a
15-footer (5 meters) on No. 8. He used a pitching wedge to chip in
from 18 feet (5 1/2 meters) on the par-4 18th.
	   ``I'm happy with this round. (I) didn't realize it tied the
course record,'' Aoki said.
	   Morgan came closest to catching Aoki but fell just short despite
eight birdies.
	   Jacobs just wanted to catch his breath after winning the first
PGA Tour-related event in his career last week. He started slowly
with a bogey on No. 2 but birdied eight of 11 at one stretch. He
finished with nine birdies and two bogeys.
	   ``I told my caddie, Ray, if I can just get in the 60s and calm
down a bit, we'll do all right this week ...,'' Jacobs said.
	   ``I started kind of unassuming, then I birdied 10, 12, 13 and
14. I thought, `Hey, Ray, Aoki's 62 looks like it's in reach.' Then
I bogeyed 18, which wasn't disappointing at all.''
	   Irwin said Aoki, who won here in 1996, has set the tone for the
54-hole tournament.
	   ``It's going to be tough to catch him because he's not the kind
of player that tends to back up to the field. He may, and someone
may go out and shoot 10 under tomorrow. I don't see that
happening,'' he said.

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Security Council agreed unanimously
Friday to freeze foreign-based funds of Angola's UNITA movement and
ban the sale of diamonds by the former rebels effective June 25
unless they meet terms of a peace agreement.
	   The new sanctions take effect automatically unless
Secretary-General Kofi Annan advises the Security Council by June
23 that UNITA has ``full complied ... with all relevant
obligations'' of the 1994 agreement that ended the civil war.
	   That includes allowing the Angolan government to extend its
control to UNITA-held areas _ including the movement's central
highland strongholds at Andulo and Bailundo _ complete the
demilitarization of its fighters, allow U.N. monitors to verify
compliance and cease attacks on U.N. and government personnel.

	   ``The international community, which has invested heavily in
helping Angolans toward peace, is in a position now to demand that
these substantial efforts not be thrown away,'' Portugal's
ambassador, Antonio Monteiro said.
	   ``We appeal to UNITA to heed the message of this council,'' he
added. ``UNITA should seize this opportunity to cooperate fully as
a political party in the consolidation of democracy in Angola,'' he
said.
	   Under the 1994 agreement, signed in Lusaka, Zambia, UNITA _ a
Portuguese acronym for the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola _ agreed to hand back to the government the
entire 50 percent of the country it seized during the civil war.
	   UNITA also agreed to demobilize its fighters and integrate them
into the national army in return for a role in the government. But
implementation has been slow, and the United Nations blames UNITA
for most of the delays.

UNITED NATIONS: the delays
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   Last Friday, the U.N. special representative to Angola, Alioune
Blondin Beye, asked the council to crack down on UNITA. Beye said
earlier this month that UNITA was hiding armed men in remote areas
of the vast southwest African nation, despite the movement's pledge
that it demobilized its 70,000-strong guerrilla army.
	   UNITA has denied the allegation. But diplomatic sources,
speaking on condition of anonymity, said Beye threatened to resign
if the council failed to take strong action.
	   Speaking to the council, U.S. envoy Nancy Soderberg said recent
reports indicate UNITA ``has retained and even reconstituted its
fighting force. This behavior is unacceptable.''
	   Soderberg also said the United States was concerned about
reports of attacks by government police against UNITA supporters
and called for them to cease.
	   The United States supported UNITA during the Cold War in its
fight against the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola,
the former Marxist group which dominates the Government of National
Unity and Reconciliation.
	   The resolution, drafted by the United States, Russia and
Portugal also prohibits all member states from official contacts
with UNITA officials except in the capital Luanda and other areas
under government control.
	   It bans the ``direct or indirect import'' of all diamonds from
Angola except those approved by Angolan authorities and bans the
sale of mining equipment except with government approval.
	   UNITA is believed to earn up to a half a billion dollars a year
from diamond sales.
	   Last October, the Security Council imposed air and travel
sanctions against UNITA, in addition to an oil and weapons embargo
in effect since 1993.
	   UNITA fought a civil war for nearly two decades against the
government following Angola's 1975 independence from Portugal. An
estimated 500,000 people died in the continent's longest civil war
before the government and UNITA signed the 1994 peace accord.

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The Dow industrials pitched a final-hour rally,
ending three days of losses as investors searched for bargain
stocks whose prices sank amid renewed fears of lower corporate
profits and Asian economic troubles. At the close of trading on
Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 23 points at
8,834 after sliding every day this week except Monday. The blue
chip indicator made a dramatic turnaround amid late-day
bargain-hunting after sinking nearly 128 points earlier in the day.
Broad stock market indicators were mixed. The selling occurred
after Japanese officials on Friday announced the first year of
economic contraction in two decades, which confirmed Japan is in a
severe recession and deepened fears that its financial troubles
will worsen Asia's economic crisis. (US-CLOSING STOCKS)
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Activists called off a seven-year boycott
campaign against a Japanese paper company Friday after the firm
pledged not to log on land claimed by an Indian tribe until the
disputed claim is settled. Friends of the Lubicon, a Toronto-based
group, initiated the boycott against Daishowa Inc. in 1991 in
support of the Lubicon Indians of northern Alberta. The company
said the boycott cost it dlrs 10 million. The case dates to 1988,
when Daishowa reached an agreement with federal and provincial
officials to log about 4,000 square miles (10,400 square
kilometers) of land claimed by the Lubicons. The isolated Indian
community contended that no logging rights should be awarded until
its dispute with government authorities was settled.
(CANADA-LOGGING BOYCOTT)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Hong Kong hopes to ride out the slide into
recession caused by the Asian financial crisis and may be among the
first to rebound, the territory's No. 2 official said Friday. Anson
Chan also said that if Congress does not renew so-called most
favored nation trading status for mainland China it would have a
severe impact on Hong Kong, which reverted from British colonial
rule last July 1. Chan said even though Hong Kong had the world's
third largest currency reserves and a well regulated banking and
financial sector, it was not spared from the financial crisis that
hit Asia last year. Analysts estimate that economic output could
fall by five percent this year if the credit crunch gripping Hong
Kong continues. The territory is experiencing its first recession
since 1985. (US-HONG KONG-ECONOMY)
	   MIAMI (AP) _ A young, telegenic state senator and rising star in
the Legislature was charged Friday with Medicare fraud, becoming
the highest-ranking figure caught up in the corruption
investigations that have engulfed Miami politics. Sen. Alberto
Gutman was accused with his wife of bilking the federal health
insurer Medicare in the early 1990s by submitting fraudulent
requests for reimbursement through two phony home health care
agencies he co-owned. He and his wife, Marcie, were released on
dlrs 150,000 bail each on federal charges of fraud, filing false
Medicare claims, witness tampering, money laundering and
conspiracy. A third defendant, businesswoman, Maricela Maury, was
also released on bail. Gutman, a 39-year-old Cuban-born Republican
who represents Miami's Little Havana section, called the case
politically motivated. (US-MIAMI-CORRUPTION)
	   DETROIT (AP) _ Worried that the progress in streamlining its
operations hasn't been enough, General Motors Corp. is in an
all-out war with its workers to make itself a leaner, more
competitive global automaker. Though GM profits total billions of
dollars thanks to a healthy U.S. economy, it still lags behind Ford
Motor Co., Chrysler Corp. and the foreign ``transplant'' automakers
in factory productivity. GM has reduced its U.S. work force by
65,000 hourly jobs in the past five years, but still needs to cut
an additional 50,000 jobs to become competitive, analysts say. To
the United Auto Workers that's unacceptable. GM's North American
production, already crippled by a UAW strike that began June 5 at a
Flint stamping plant where sheet-metal parts are made, could come
to a virtual standstill by the end of next week because of a strike

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Russia and the NATO allies agreed
Friday that the explosive situation in Kosovo represents a grave
danger to its neighbors but differed on how to deal with defiant
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. U.S. Defense Secretary
William Cohen, who had a private meeting with Russian Defense
Minister Igor Sergeyev, stressed the urgency of finding a solution
to hostilities in the southern Yugoslavian province. However,
Sergeyev said Russia ``is convinced we haven't exhausted all
non-military means ... to resolve this crisis.'' Cohen said Russia
risked isolation if it blocked international efforts. NATO plans as
early as next week to demonstrate allied air power over neighboring
Albania and Macedonia in hopes of impressing Milosevic and making
him rethink his policy of escalating violence in Kosovo.
(NATO-KOSOVO)
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ With his forces shooting into the air,
firing tear gas and briefly detaining a leading dissident,
Nigeria's new military boss sent a clear signal Friday to his
myriad opponents: Muscle still rules this junta-weary country.
Opposition activists demanding an end to military rule took to the
streets in a planned mass protest, but they were quickly confronted
by a wall of police and soldiers in Lagos, Nigeria's commercial
hub. Police arrested Gani Fawehinmi, a lawyer and leading dissident
who organized the protests, and held him for several hours before
he was released on bail. They also arrested Dupe Abiola, one of the
wives of imprisoned businessman Moshood Abiola, the presumed winner
of canceled 1993 elections. She too was later released, along with
five other detainees. (NIGERIA)
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Tens of thousands of people fled the
former Portuguese colony of Guinea-Bissau on Friday as government
troops fought renegade soldiers who launched a coup attempt,
according to reports. As many as 40,000 people in the West African
nation were heading on foot along the road to the northern border
with Senegal, a Portuguese journalist in the area said, citing
local reports. More than 2,200 people, mostly foreigners, arrived
in Dakar, Senegal, on Friday after being evacuated from the
capital, Bissau, on a Portuguese merchant ship. In Bissau, the
French embassy was hit by a bazooka shell but no one was injured,
the Portuguese news agency Lusa reported. (GUINEA-BISSAU)
	   LAS MARGARITAS, Mexico (AP) _ Amid fears of renewed war between
Zapatista rebels and the government, Mexico's president flew to
Chiapas on Friday to defend his administration's stated desire for
dialogue and pledge money for towns where rebel support runs high.
Some analysts say a police and army raid on an Indian village this
week is the latest indication that the government has chosen
military might over talks. Nine people were killed when government
forces clashed Wednesday with apparent Zapatista rebels while
trying to evict a symbolic pro-rebel town council. As the president
spoke in Chiapas, a dozen people unfurled banners demanding a halt
to violence. In Las Margaritas, Zedillo signed an accord granting
aid to 42 municipalities ``that need special attention,'' he said.
(MEXICO-CHIAPAS)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The Chinese ambassador suggested Friday that
the United States needs China as an ally in a region troubled by
fresh nuclear threats and financial crisis. Just two weeks before
President Clinton was to visit China, Ambassador Li Zhaoxing
offered assurances that his nation has only peaceful and prosperous
ambitions. ``China presents no threat to any country, at all,'' Li
said, denying U.S. intelligence information that Beijing's nuclear
missiles are targeting American cities. Clinton's five-city
journey, from June 25 to July 3, will be the first visit to China
by an American president since the 1989 crackdown on pro-democracy
students at Tiananmen Square. (US-CHINA)

Tourist ship sinks off Galapagos Islands; one dead and three

<TEXT>
	   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) _ A 70-year-old woman died and three people
were missing after a boat carrying 15 elderly American tourists
sank off the coast of one of the Galapagos islands, port
authorities said Friday.
	   The U.S. Embassy identified the dead woman as Diane Sayre but
had no information on her home town.
	   The missing passengers were identified as Richard Sayre, 80,
Robert Donna, 75, and Lyon Zeiler, 75, by Lt. Jacinto Trivino, the
captain of the port of Puerto Ayora in the Galapagos Islands. But
U.S. Embassy officials could not confirm the names.
	   One of the 11 passengers who were rescued from Wednesday night's
shipwreck suffered serious injury, Trivino said. Eight crewmen also
survived.
	   The boat, called the ``Moby Dick,'' sank after sea conditions
changed suddenly and two large waves swamped the boat near the
island of Santa Fe, which forms part of the Galapagos archipelago,
Trivino said. Passengers did not have time to put on their life
jackets, he said.
	   A navy and private boats were searching for the missing
tourists, but hopes for finding them alive are dim, he said.
	   ``The people who are missing were lost because they were elderly
_ 70 to 80 years old _ and did not know how to swim,'' said Antonio
Saman, manager of the Galasam travel agency, which organized the
chartered boat tour.
	   The boat stayed afloat for 20 to 30 minutes before sinking. A
nearby yacht arrived within 10 minutes after the boat sank and
began rescuing the survivors from the water.
	   The Galapagos Islands, home to unique forms of animal and plant
life, are located 600 miles (1,000 kms) west of the Ecuadorean
mainland. They are Ecuador's major tourist attraction.

Examinations find Haitians who died in capsized boat were not shot
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COCKBURN TOWN, Turks and Caicos (AP) _ The bodies of six Haitian
refugees who drowned when their sloop capsized off the Turks and
Caicos islands had no bullet wounds, police said.
	   Some survivors of the shipwreck claimed that marine police fired
at the overcrowded boat. But police have said they only fired
warning shots in the air.
	   A pathologist with the Dade County Coroner's Office in Florida
was brought in to examine the bodies. No gunshot wounds were found,
police said Friday.
	   The ship sank Monday, just 25 kilometers (15 miles) off
Providenciales, the largest island in the British archipelago,
which is 1,000 kilometers (600 miles) southeast of Florida.
	   The boat has been raised and will be examined, Deputy Police
Commissioner Bryan Davies said.
	   The 70 Haitians who survived are being interviewed with the help
of interpreters. The Haitians, who largely speak Creole, also spent
more than an hour Thursday talking with a representative from the
Haitian consulate in the Bahamas.
	   Survivors said as many as 113 people were on the boat. Police
said there were about 70 survivors and only six bodies were
recovered.
	   Davies said police also want to interview the occupants of two
yachts that may have been nearby when the ship sank. The names of
the vessels are unknown, but some survivors said they were flying
U.S. flags.
	   Thousands of Haitian refugees fleeing their impoverished country
have ended up in the Turks and Caicos islands in recent years.

	   PARIS (AP) _ The first red card, the first scoreless tie, the
first team to score three times.
	   Almost the first World Cup strike by a goalkeeper.
	   Oh, and another own goal.
	   While furious Japanese fans continued their search for tickets
they had been promised and had paid for, day three of the World Cup
produced a curious mixture on the field.
	   Veteran striker Hristo Stoichkov fired against the post and
Paraguay's attack-minded goalkeeper, Jose Luis Chilavert produced
the best free kick so far.
	   It was curling just under the crossbar from 30 meters but
Bulgarian 'keeper Zdravko Zdravkov produced an acrobatic save to
make sure the game ended 0-0.
	   ``I already saw the ball in the net,'' said Chilavert, who has
35 goals in his professional career. ``Too bad, I could have made
history.''
	   Bulgaria's Anatoli Nankov became the first player of the
championship to be expelled. But at least it was for two yellow
cards. We're still awaiting the first red card for a tackle from
behind.
	   Bulgaria-Paraguay was game five and the first to be scoreless.
It was followed by Denmark's 1-0 victory over Saudi Arabia in which
defender Marc Rieper headed the winner and Michael Laudrup made his
100th appearance with a win.
	   Having held its breath for the opening two days, the host nation
went into action against South Africa and came up with the biggest
win so far.
	   In a one-sided 3-0 victory in Marseille, it was uncanny that
Olympique striker Christophe Dugarry netted the first and teammate
Pierre Issa added the second.
	   Trouble was, Issa was playing for South Africa.
	   The defender lunged at a goalbound Youri Djorkaeff strike, which
'keeper Hans Vonk appeared to have covered, and deflected it the
other way into the net.
	   Issa became the third player in three days to score in his own
net after Scotland's Tommy Boyd against Brazil and Morocco's
Youssef Chippo against Norway.
	   To make things worse for Issa, FIFA announced later his
deflection past his own 'keeper was the 1,600th goal in the history
of World Cup final tournaments.
	   Monaco's Thierry Henry saved his embarrassment by scoring a
third for the French in injury time as the host nation went to the
top of Group C, ahead of the Danes.
	   ``The door is wide open now,'' said French coach Aime Jacquet.
``We are really confident.''
	   It was cruel World Cup debut for South Africa, the former
African Nations Cup holder.
	   ``We were missing experience and chances to play together. We
played against a great team,'' said South Africa's coach Philippe
Troussier. ``But we did not deserve this kind of result.''
	   In Saturday's games, Olympic champion Nigeria faced Spain in
Nantes, neighbors Belgium and the Netherlands confronted each other
in Paris and South Korea met Mexico at Lyon.
	   Meanwhile, the ticket problems that have plagued the organizing
committee for more than a year, were biting hard as the tournament
went into a fourth day.
	   Fans from as far afield as Japan have arrived in France to find
the tickets aren't here to meet them and FIFA, soccer's governing
body, is investigating two national federations and a subsidiary of
its own marketing arm regarding game ticket fraud at the World Cup.
	   FIFA, which said it had complaints from fans missing tickets in
the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, England and Brazil, as well as
Japan, said it has warned fans not to deal with anyone but licensed
ticket operators.

Annan urges success in Burundi talks, offers readiness to help
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBERT H. REID &QC;

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Secretary-General Kofi Annan urged all
parties in Burundi to show a ``spirit of cooperation'' in next
week's peace talks and offered U.N. help ``at all stages of this
process.''
	   Talks open Monday in Arusha, Tanzania, between Burundi's
Tutsi-led government and its Hutu opponents. Burundi's President
Pierre Buyoya will take part in the talks, arranged by former
Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere.
	   ``The secretary-general urges all parties, both within and
outside the country, to act in a spirit of cooperation, tolerance
and reconciliation and refrain from any action that could undermine
the chances of reaching the sort of peaceful and stable settlement
that is so necessary for the people of Burundi and for the region
as a whole,'' the United Nations said in a statement.
	   The statement added that Annan ``reaffirms the readiness of the
United Nations to continue to assist (Nyerere) and the parties at
all stages of the process.''
	   At least 200,000 people have died in politically motivated
ethnic violence in the tiny African country since October 1993,
when Tutsi paratroopers assassinated the country's first
democratically elected president, a Hutu.
	   Buyoya, a retired Tutsi army major who ousted Hutu coalition
President Sylvestre Ntibantunganya in July 1996, has proposed a
transitional government that comprises all political parties.
	   Hutu rebels are trying to oust Buyoya's Tutsi-led government and
army and reinstate a Hutu as president.
	   Buyoya boycotted talks last year brokered by Nyerere because he
claimed the former Tanzanian president was pro-Hutu. Five days
after Buyoya's 1996 coup, Burundi's neighbors imposed economic
sanctions in order to force Buyoya to return to the partial
democracy he overthrew.
	   Tutsis make up just 14 percent of Burundi's population of 6
million.
	   But they have controlled the country for all but four months
since independence in 1962. Hutus make up 85 percent of the
population.
	   On June 6, a transitional constitution took effect under which a
government of transition and an expanded national assembly of 121
seats will be established.

Polgar defeats Karpov 5-3 in battle of sexes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Judit Polgar, the 21-year-old Hungarian
chess prodigy, dealt a humiliating blow to defending world chess
champion Anatoly Karpov, winning a speed match challenge 5-3
Friday.
	   On the last day of a four-day, eight-match contest that was the
first to pit the world's top male and female players, both games
ended in ties.
	   ``I think this is the greatest failure of Karpov's life, and it
must be hard for him to suffer this defeat,'' said Laszlo Polgar,
father and coach of Judit and her two sisters, both chess masters.
	   ``It's a great feeling to defeat the world champion,'' a visibly
tired Judit Polgar said after her win.
	   Karpov was unavailable for comment, leaving the venue
immediately.
	   In Friday's first game, Karpov started with an English opening,
was in a winning position in most of the game but blundered in the
endgame. The two agreed a tie on the 71st move.
	   That meant that _ irrespective of the last match _ Judit had won
their contest.
	   The last game went without much excitement. Karpov, playing
black, started with a Caro-Kann defense, then played a Panov
variation.
	   Polgar failed to capitalize on a potentially winning advantage,
and a tie was agreed on the 68th move.
	   This was the first time in chess history that the top male and
female players played each other.
	   Although Karpov is world champion of the World Chess Federation,
FIDE, fellow Russian Garry Kasparov is regarded the true world
champion.
	   Laszlo Polgar said after the match that Kasparov's
representative watched the Budapest match and that a match between
Judit Polgar and Kasparov in already being negotiated.
	   ``There is already dlrs 1 million prize money offered for that
match,'' he said, but declined to answer who the sponsor would be
or where it would be played.

<TEXT>
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ A center-left party on Friday endorsed
a former coup leader's bid to become Venezuela's next president, a
move that could soften the candidate's image and attract young
voters.
	   Members of the Movement to Socialism, known by its Spanish
initials MAS, voted overwhelmingly during their national convention
to support former Lt. Col. Hugo Chavez, who leads presidential
polls six years after trying unsuccessfully to overthrow
Venezuela's popularly elected leader.
	   The debate over whether to endorse Chavez has uncovered rifts
between the party's young leaders and the older generation that
founded it. On Thursday, Planning Minister Teodoro Petkoff, a MAS
founder, criticized Chavez and said his populist policies would
push Venezuela ``back into the past.''
	   So far, the December presidential race is dominated by Chavez
and former Miss Universe Irene Saez, the popular mayor of a Caracas
municipality.

	   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) _ A Guatemalan court sentenced one man to 25
years in prison and another to five years for leading a village mob
that lynched a woman suspected of stealing a child.
	   The crowd killed Maria del Carmen Azucena Gonzalez in March 1997
in the village San Raymundo, 10 miles (16 kilometers) northwest of
the capital. The mob believed Azucena and another woman had stolen
a child, a charge Azucena repeatedly denied.
	   Villagers in rural Guatemala have become increasingly violent in
dealing with child-stealing rumors and crime in general. This year,
14 Guatemalans have been lynched, according to the private Mutual
Support Group.
	   ___
	   FORT-DE-FRANCE, Martinique (AP) _ Angry growers dumped tons of
green bananas at the entrances to government buildings Friday to
protest a port workers strike.
	   Berard Capgras told the Caraibes International radio station
that the fruit was part of the tons of bananas that producers have
lost since some employees went on strike recently at the
Fort-de-France harbor.
	   Capgras said the banana producers are desperate.
	   Dock workers went on strike in support of workers at a banana
farm in the southern town of Francois on this Caribbean island,
which is part of France. More than 4,000 tons of bananas destined
for France and other parts of Europe were left on the docks.
	   Some residents took advantage of the protest by hauling away as
many bananas as they could carry before cleaning companies moved in
to remove the fruit.

World Cup: France produces 3-0 win, hint of champagne soccer
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous &QL; 
 &UR; By RAF CASERT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ France produced that whiff of champagne
soccer the whole host nation had been hoping for, crushing South
Africa 3-0 to raise hopes it can go all the way in the World Cup.
	   Olympique Marseille hero Christophe Dugarry redeemed himself
after a slew of weak performances with a goal and an assist as
France put on the most dominating performance so far in the World
Cup.
	   ``We are really confident now,'' said coach Aime Jacquet.
	   France now can build on this performance ahead of Thursday's
second match against Saudi Arabia, which lost to Denmark 1-0
Friday.
	   For South Africa, the crushing loss means it needs victories.
	   ``We must beat Denmark now,'' said coach Philippe Troussier.
	   France's opening night in its favorite soccer city produced
everything the fans hoped for, and more. Native son Zinedine Zidane
led with authority throughout the night and Dugarry emerged from a
bad slump with France's first goal and an assist on the second.
	   The two friends combined well throughout the evening and
provided the flavor the crowd of 60,000 at the Velodrome stadium
wanted.
	   The South Africans were just flat, their defensive posture
ridiculed by wave after wave of attacks.
	   ``The door is wide open now,'' said French coach Aime Jacquet.
	   For South Africa it is closing quickly.
	   Goals by Dugarry and Thierry Henry, combined with an own goal by
Pierre Issa, silenced the critics and sent the crowd into
continuous roars despite the howling winds that beat on this
Mediterranean port throughout the evening.
	   ``We knew we could count on the Marseille crowd,'' said Jacquet.
``It was good soccer in very tough conditions.''
	   South Africa's latest chapter in its sporting history, following
almost three decades on the sidelines of international soccer
because of apartheid, never had any shine.
	   ``We played against one of the best teams in the world,'' said
Troussier.
	   But defender Mark Fish said his team must be more attack-minded.
	   ``We just have to play our natural way, the way that got us to
the World Cup. We cannot defend for 90 minutes,'' he said.
	   The 3-0 score was by far the most decisive match in the World
Cup so far.
	   South Africa got its only chance in first half injury time when
Issa, yet another Olympique Marseille player, rose above Laurent
Blanc to meet a freekick from David Nyathi, but his glancing header
went just the wrong side of the post.
	   The only French worry was that for 78 minutes only a single goal
separated the two. In defense, France towered over the opposition
and outmuscled them every time.

World Cup: Henry comes from nowhere to steal limelight

 &UR; With BC-Sports-Soccer-France-South Africa &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ The World Cup has a knack of springing
surprises. Any armchair pundit who would have predicted two months
ago Thierry Henry would have been on France's lineup would have
been laughed into embarrassment.
	   To have predicted he would have scored a great World Cup goal
with a darting run and sweet finish would have been beyond words.
	   Yet Monaco's Henry made a startling recovery from a midseason
slump, squeezed into the World Cup squad of 22 against expectations
last month and rode that piece of luck right into Friday's opener
against South Africa.
	   And with a darting run down the right and a subtle finish over
the outstretched hands of 'keeper Hans Vonk, the 20-year-old drove
home the last goal in a 3-0 thrashing of South Africa.
	   ``We will savor this win but we mustn't rest on our laurels,''
Henry said afterwards. He knows about resting on his laurels,
	   Henry started the season in startling form bobbing and weaving
through the defense of some of the best continental clubs during
the European Champions League, scoring a half dozen goals as Monaco
reached the semifinals.
	   But suddenly, as quickly as his form dropped, reports of his
personal problems rose, and Henry was a young spirit finding it
tough to adapt to an adult life. ``There were moments when it was
really tough,'' he said.
	   As his fortunes sank, one of the people who continued to believe
in him was goalkeeper Fabien Barthez, also of Monaco and the French
team.
	   During the spring, the intense goalkeeper took the wayward
youngster aside and gave him the grilling of his life. ``It's true,
it was heated,'' said Henry. Barthez basically told that even if
things looked bad, the World Cup still was within reach.
	   ``It really dawned on me. If somebody like that backs you, it
means something,'' he said.
	   Suddenly he was back in the hunt.
	   In the European Champions Cup semifinal, he found his old touch
again, and despite Monaco's loss to Juventus Turin, Jacquet had
noticed the prodigal son was back.
	   Good outings during the preparation campaign and he was selected
for the squad of 22 and against all expectations. Friday's opener.
	   ``You have to work. Work brings about everything,'' he said.
``Work and a sense that you should never be satisfied.''

Opposition party representatives ousted from Guyana Parliament
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BERT WILKINSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) _ The representatives of the main
opposition party were kicked out of Parliament after they failed to
attend the minimum number of consecutive sessions, party officials
confirmed Friday.
	   The People's National Congress, which won 25 of the 65 seats in
Parliament in the December general election, had refused to take
its seats. The party has claimed the elections were unfair although
two international groups have said election irregularities were
minor.
	   On Thursday, the government told the party to provide the names
of 25 new representatives or the ban on its attendance in
Parliament would continue indefinitely.
	   ``We were sort of expecting it,'' said Malcolm Parris, a member
of the party's central executive committee. ``I don't think it will
bring a crisis. We are going to submit the same 25 names because
they were the ones elected.''
	   Party President Desmond Hoyte, the losing presidential candidate
in the election, said the party has yet to decide if or when it
will take its seats.
	   The party contends the elections were marred by fraud although a
panel of regional elections experts, funded by the United Nations,
audited the results and found only minor problems. A team of
elections observers from the Organization of American States issued
a similar finding.
	   The party's representatives were ousted under parliamentary
regulations that prohibit members from missing six consecutive
meetings of the House in an eight-week period.
	   The majority needs the cooperation of the minority members of
Parliament to undertake a planned revision of the Constitution in
this former British colony in South America.

World Cup: soccer's not the same for family of slain player

<TEXT>
	   MEDELLIN, Colombia (AP) _ For Dario Escobar, the World Cup is
synonymous with sorrow.
	   The proud father watched in horror four years ago when his son,
a star defender on the Colombian national team, deflected a
crossing pass into his own net, contributing to a 2-1 loss to the
United States which eliminated a much-touted Colombia from the 1994
World Cup.
	   Five days later, as the tournament continued, drunks insulted
27-year-old Andres Escobar outside a Medellin bar. A gunman pumped
six bullets into the athlete's chest. The country and the world
condemned a senseless killing.
	   And little changed.
	   Today, Dario Escobar keeps his son's memory alive in scrapbooks
and through social works.
	   He has tried to convert a heinous crime into a parable for
soccer fanatics and impressionable youth, speaking against violence
and founding two soccer schools the teach poor kids that winning
isn't everything.
	   Colombians in New York and London have also founded soccer
schools bearing the name of his slain son, he says.
	   But a bitter Escobar says the moral is lost on too many of his
countrymen, including whomever is behind recent death threats to a
coach and a team member now in France.
	   ``Nothing has been assimilated,'' he told The Associated Press
at his Medellin apartment Thursday. ``We can't sing victory yet.''
	   Meanwhile, the sport will never be the same for the
soccer-loving Escobars.
	   After the shooting, Andres' older brother Santiago quit the
game, ending a 14-year professional career. He now coaches a youth
team.
	   Dario Escobar visits son's grave now and then, and it has become
a local landmark.
	   But he hasn't been to a soccer stadium since he lost Andres. He
says watching television this month is too much to handle.
	   ``I watch these World Cup games for a minute or two, but it
doesn't interest me like before,'' said Escobar. ``It brings back
bad memories.''

Security Council moves toward new, tough sanctions against UNITA,
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS and combines previous &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT H. REID &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Security Council has given former
Angolan rebels until June 23 to fulfill conditions of a peace plan
or sweeping economic sanctions will take effect automatically two
days later.
	   The sanctions include a freeze on foreign bank accounts of the
UNITA movement and a ban on sales of diamonds mined in areas under
UNITA's control. UNITA earns hundreds of millions of dollars
annually from diamond exports.
	   Under a unanimous resolution, UNITA must demobilize its
remaining forces, hand over its central highland strongholds, allow
U.N. monitors to verify compliance and cease attacks on U.N. and
government personnel by June 23.
	   Otherwise, the sanctions kick in automatically at one minute
after midnight June 25 New York time.
	   Envoys from the United States, Russia and Portugal, which
oversee the 1994 Angolan peace agreement, said the sanctions were
designed to save the peace process and appealed to UNITA to meet
the deadline for compliance.
	   ``The international community, which has invested heavily in
helping Angolans toward peace, is in a position now to demand that
these substantial efforts (toward peace) not be thrown away,''
Portugal's ambassador, Antonio Monteiro, said.
	   ``We appeal to UNITA to heed the message of this council,'' he
added. ``UNITA should seize this opportunity to cooperate fully as
a political party in the consolidation of democracy in Angola,'' he
said.
	   Under the 1994 agreement, UNITA _ a Portuguese acronym for the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola _ agreed to
hand back to the government the 50 percent of the country it seized
during the civil war.
	   UNITA also agreed to demobilize its fighters and integrate them
into the national army in return for a role in the government. But
implementation has been slow, and the United Nations blames UNITA
for most of the delays.
	   The U.N. special representative to Angola, Alioune Blondin Beye,
has accused UNITA of hiding armed men in remote areas of the vast
southwest African nation. UNITA denies the charge.
	   But U.S. envoy Nancy Soderberg said recent, credible reports
indicate UNITA ``has retained and even reconstituted its fighting
force. This behavior is unacceptable.''
	   Soderberg also said the United States was concerned about
reports of attacks by government police against UNITA supporters
and called for them to cease.
	   The United States supported UNITA during the Cold War in its
fight against the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola,
the former Marxist group which dominates the Government of National
Unity and Reconciliation.
	   The resolution also prohibits all member states from official
contacts with UNITA officials except in the capital Luanda and
other areas under government control.
	   It bans the ``direct or indirect import'' of all diamonds from
Angola except those approved by Angolan authorities and bans the
sale of mining equipment except with government approval.
	   Last October, the Security Council imposed air and travel
sanctions against UNITA, in addition to an oil and weapons embargo
in effect since 1993.
	   UNITA fought a civil war for nearly two decades against the
government following Angola's 1975 independence from Portugal. An
estimated 500,000 people died in the continent's longest civil war
before the government and UNITA signed the 1994 peace accord.

World Cup: Ticket problems rumble into day four
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The World Cup ticket flap just goes on and on.
	   After month after month of taking hassle from English, Dutch,
German and Italian fans for their ticket distribution policy, World
Cup organizers now have to face supporters who have arrived in
France to find there is no ticket at all.
	   Among them are 76 Japanese fans who have flown thousands of
miles to see their country play in the World Cup for the first
time. They have just 40 tickets between them.
	   Bruno Travade, a spokesman for the World Cup organizing
committee, said he could not explain reports that 12,000 Japanese
tickets had gone missing and that five Japanese travel agencies
reportedly were deciding to cancel World Cup tours.
	   He said that representatives of the only three licensed ticket
agencies for Asia _ JT Travel, Ken R Tours and Prime Sports
International _ picked up their tickets at the organizers' Paris
headquarters between April 27-29.
	   ``We have the receipts, signed by representatives of the tour
operators, that they collected the number and classification of
tickets they had contracted for,'' Travade said.
	   The Japanese aren't the only fans to say they have arrived in
France to find the tickets aren't here.
	   Brazilians and English followers also were caught up, many of
them after travel companies failed to come up with the tickets.
	   Worldwide, Travade said, 138,000 tickets had been distributed to
17 licensed agencies. Other brokers who peddled World Cup tickets
face legal action, the spokesman said.
	   ``We will sue anyone or any organization who undertakes to
damage our image or intentions,'' Travade said. ``And we encourage
individuals to sue the persons who cheated them.''
	   Masami Tachi, a 34-year-old housewife from Tokyo, is one of the
Japanese fans caught in the ticket trap.
	   ``We came here to see the World Cup,'' she said. ``It's not good
enough to get the money back for the tickets.''

Militants move closer to Kosovo's capital, kill two Serb policemen

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Boldly striking just outside the
capital, Kosovo's ethnic Albanian militants said they killed two
Serb policemen in one of a series of attacks around the
secessionist province.
	   Rebels also Friday claimed to have mustered a 15,000-strong
fighting force for the escalating battle against Serb rule. The
Kosovo Liberation Army, a shadowy group that first emerged in 1996,
said it intended to prove it has a large force uniting the
province's majority ethnic Albanians.
	   The level of fighting has escalated in recent weeks. KLA attacks
such as the killing of the policemen have come to the edge of
Pristina, Kosovo's capital, severed main roads and occasionally
shut the city airport.
	   Popular support for the KLA's militancy has grown, making it
more difficult to envisage the negotiated settlement the United
States and other Western nations seek.
	   On Friday, fighting between Serbian forces and the militants
erupted again in the Decani region in western Kosovo, close to the
border with Albania.
	   Ethnic Albanian sources said seven villages were under Serb
attack, pummeled by artillery and grenade launchers.
	   One ethnic Albanian was killed, they said; their report could
not be independently confirmed.
	   Last week's latest Serb offensive in western Kosovo prompted
NATO to announce Thursday it would stage a show of air power to
persuade Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to halt the
assaults.
	   Ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs by 9-to-1 in Kosovo. Most want
independence from Serbia, which in 1989 stripped the southern
province of broad autonomy and has governed through military and
police rule ever since. More than 250 people have died since March,
when Serb forces started a crackdown aimed at Albanian militants.
	   An estimated 60,000 villagers fled their homes in Kosovo during
the latest Serb offensive, the U.N. refugee agency said. Thousands
have crossed rugged mountains into Albania and Macedonia. The
nations border Serbia, the dominant of two republics remaining in
the former Yugoslavia.
	   A U.N. war crimes tribunal said Friday it was sending
investigators on a U.S.-backed mission to Kosovo to check out
allegations of atrocities in the Serb offensive.
	   Militants have gained much more popular support since March, and
young Kosovo Albanians who live in western Europe have flocked to
Albania to organize or fight.
	   The KLA said it now commanded 15,000 fighters and named Jakup
Krasniqi, a teacher from the Drenica region, as its spokesman.
	   Fighting between the militants and Serb forces has come much
closer to Pristina in recent weeks, causing the occasional shutdown
of the city's airport, 13 kilometers (8 miles) west of Pristina.
	   Serb sources in the province said two policemen where killed and
one was seriously wounded in an overnight ambush by separatists
near Obilic, just 7 kilometers (4 miles) northwest of Pristina.
	   The ethnic Albanian daily Bujku reported Friday that five ethnic
Albanians and seven Serbs were killed in fierce clashes Thursday in
Suvo Grlo in the Drenica area, 32 kilometers (20 miles) west of
Pristina.
	   In other fighting, the state-run Tanjug news agency in Belgrade
reported that a Serb policeman was seriously hurt in what it called
an attack by ``armed Albanian terrorists'' near one of the seven
Kosovo villages, Prilep.
	   Albanian sources also reported Serb attacks on villages in the
Obilic and adjacent Vucitrn regions, saying residents who fled the
fighting spent the night under open skies.
	   NATO is planning simulated air attacks in Albania and Macedonia
to try to persuade Milosevic to halt military action in Kosovo.
	   On Friday, Western foreign ministers met in London with their
Russian counterpart to step up pressure on Milosevic. Britain,
which is weighing a U.N. move to back use of NATO force in Kosovo,
urged Milosevic to pull back his troops immediately.
	   The United States, Canada, Britain, France, Italy and Germany
also said they would move to ban flights by Yugoslav Airlines to
underline their concern about the violence in Kosovo, British
Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said.

World Cup: Leonardo could be new starter on Brazilian team
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PETER MUELLO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OZOIR-LA-FERRIERE, France (AP) _ Hush. Zagallo's thinking.
	   While the Brazilian training camp is abuzz that the veteran
coach plans changes to the lineup after an indifferent performance
against Scotland, Mario Zagallo won't say what's on his mind.
	   Followers of the four-time titlist are suggesting that Zagallo
will drop the disappointing Giovanni from the lineup and start AC
Milan midfielder Leonardo.
	   ``Everybody's saying Leonardo is the starter,'' Zagallo said
after Friday's practice. ``I don't want to talk right now. I want
to take a few days and think about it.''
	   But Zagallo made no secret that he felt the team played better
with Leonardo, who replaced Giovanni at the start of the second
half. The defense became stronger, the offense sharper, and Brazil
gradually dominated the stalwart but limited Scots in a 2-1 victory
in the opening game of the championship.
	   Giovanni ignored requests for interviews and raced into the
dressing room after Friday's practice.
	   ``I thought he was very apathetic. He didn't show up on the
field,'' Zagallo said. ``I don't know what the matter is. I'm a
soccer coach, not a psychologist.''
	   But Zagallo's substitution of Giovanni was a clear sign of his
displeasure. Normally, the coach discusses what he feels were a
player's errors during halftime, and gives him a second chance in
the final 45 minutes. With Giovanni, he ran out of patience.
	   ``A player with Giovanni's talent and strength can't be so out
of tune,'' team coordinator Zico said. ``He was very dispersive.
	   ``Leonardo trains as if it were a real game, and when he plays,
he shows motivation and joy.''
	   Leonardo started his career in the back before switching to
midfield and that could give him an edge because Morocco has a
talented offensive team that is expected to press the Brazilians
more than Scotland.
	   ``I've been prepared for a long time,'' Leonardo said. ``The
coach has to be illuminated to decide and choose the best.''

With show of force, Nigeria's new regime dispels demonstrators

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ The protesters came to march for
democracy. What they got was a strong dose of tear gas and a
warning that Nigeria's new military leader could be as intolerant
of opposition as its old.
	   Police and soldiers firing tear gas and bullets into the air
turned back hundreds of pro-democracy demonstrators Friday as they
tried to mark the anniversary of annulled presidential elections
and call for a return to civilian rule.
	   The main demonstration never really got going, though, as the
security forces stopped the marchers from getting to the bus
terminal where they'd planned to gather, as well as other spots
where they had come together in the Yaba district on Lagos' north
side.
	   The clashes came just three days after Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar
came to power following the death of Gen. Sani Abacha, whose
five-year dictatorship was marked by brutal repression of its
critics. Friday's violence seemed to indicate that things may not
change quickly.
	   ``We want the world to know that Nigerians want an end to
military rule,'' said Dele Alabai, a student at the University of
Lagos who turned out for the protest. ``This is not about Abacha or
about Abubakar. It is a struggle for democracy, and June 12th is
the symbol of that struggle.''
	   Gani Fawehinmi, the fiery Lagos attorney who lead calls for the
demonstrations, was arrested when he arrived for the protests.
Police also arrested Dupe Abiola, one of the wives of imprisoned
businessman Moshood Abiola, the presumed winner of canceled 1993
elections. Both were charged with unlawful assembly and later
released, as were the five other people known to have been arrested
in Lagos.
	   ``This new government shows signs of repression reminiscent of
Gen. Sani Abacha's diabolical regime,'' Fawehinmi said in an
interview after his release. ``It appears nothing has changed.''
	   Some democracy supporters saw hope in what had happened _
noticeably that the people arrested were quickly freed. During the
Abacha years, arrested people would often simply disappear for
months, languishing in Nigerian prisons.
	   ``I think it's a good sign,'' said Clement Nwankwo, a prominent
human rights lawyer, adding the prisoners may have been freed to
signal pro-democracy activists that things are changing under
Abubakar.
	   Demonstrators clashed with police a handful of times in Lagos on
Friday afternoon _ and each time the police drove them away with
teargas and gunshots in the air.
	   About 15 kilometers (10 miles) west of the city, students from
the Lagos State College of Education clashed briefly with police
after running into the streets and burning tires, witnesses said.
They were subdued with tear gas, and 10 were arrested.
	   Protests were also held in a number of other cities around the
country, though all were reportedly broken up by authorities.
	   Authorities had repeatedly warned demonstrators that the Lagos
gathering was illegal and would be dealt with severely. Fearing
violence, many Lagos residents stayed home Friday, and the city's
normally crowded streets had only light traffic.
	   Friday's protests were initially organized to mark the
anniversary of the annulled elections and to call for freedom for
Abiola. But they took on added significance, coming only days after
Abubakar was appointed leader of this oil-rich but impoverished
West African country.
	   Abubakar already has infuriated the opposition by offering only
a vague pledge to move forward with democratic reforms and a
transition to civilian rule by Oct. 1.

World Cup: Baggio may have earned himself a permanent position in

Italy's lineup &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SENLIS, France (AP) _ Roberto Baggio, a veteran brought to
France as a substitute for the injured Alessandro Del Piero, played
so well in Italy's opener against Chile that coach Cesare Maldini
is considering pairing him with the star striker in future matches.
	   The combination, considered outlandish a few days ago, is now a
distinct possibility. Baggio is in top form and Del Piero is ready
to return to the team from a painful right thigh strain.
	   ``I must understand if they can play together, and in which way.
I have several days for deciding, before the next match,'' Maldini
said at Italy's training camp in Senlis following a dramatic 2-2
draw against Chile at Bordeaux.
	   Baggio was the best player on the Italian side and salvaged
Italy from a sensational upset by earning and converting a late
penalty.
	   ``I don't know if they are compatible. I'll think of it,''
Maldini said.
	   Italy may need to field a third forward in their game against
Cameroon Wednesday as Baggio and Christian Vieri looked quite
isolated in front against Chile.
	   ``That was a tactical problem (against the Chileans). We must
improve cohesion between midfield and the attack,'' the Italian
coach explained.
	   He rejected criticism of young defenders Alessandro Nesta and
Fabio Cannavaro, who had a difficult match against Ivan Zamorano
and Marcelo Salas in Thursday's match of Group B.
	   Salas scored both Chile's goals while Zamorano was a steady
threat with his headers.
	   ``Zamorano is one of the best world players in aerial play and
is difficult to stop. I can say both Nesta and Cannavaro will start
against Cameroon,'' Maldini said.
	   ``We are aware that Cameroon is very strong athletically. We
will study the tape of its last match against Austria tonight,'' he
said.
	   Del Piero, 23, practiced full time Friday and said he felt ready
to play against Cameroon.
	   ``It's up to Maldini to decide if I can be started. I am ready.
I see no problem in playing with three forwards, along with Roberto
(Baggio),'' Del Piero said.
	   Maldini said Italy will have to play for victory against
Cameroon.

Japan's recession deepens fears of regional crisis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos TOK101-103,105-107 &QL; 
 &UR; By JOJI SAKURAI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ News that Japan is mired in recession has sparked
fears of another round of regional currency devaluations.
	   In a much-awaited announcement, the Economic Planning Agency
said Friday that the gross domestic product in the world's
second-largest economy shrank for two consecutive quarters, and
that it suffered the first full year of negative growth in 20
years.
	   That bodes badly for the rest of Asia, which has been nursing
the wounds of last year's regionwide currency crisis. Asian
countries have been heavily reliant on Japanese investment and
Japanese loans, and they consider Japan a vital import market.
	   But with its own economy in tatters and consumer confidence at
all-time lows, Japan will be more tempted than ever to embark on a
path of export-led growth _ and if it does, the government will be
very reluctant to stem the yen's slide against the dollar. A cheap
yen makes Japanese exports cheaper, and thus more popular,
overseas.
	   A continued plunge in the yen _ it fell again Friday, to as low
as 144.75 to the dollar _ could set off another round of regional
currency devaluations as Asian countries fight to keep their
products competitive in key foreign markets.
	   The yen's weakness, which makes it less profitable for U.S.
companies to sell goods throughout Asia, has weighed on the stock
market and pushed the Dow Jones industrial average down by as much
as 250 points this week. Hard times in Japan mean consumers there
are more reluctant to spend money on goods made elsewhere.
	   The weak Asian currencies have helped keep U.S. inflation in
check. The lower prices of imported goods has held back price
increases and largely done the work of the Federal Reserve, which
otherwise may have increased interest rates by now to cool the
economy.
	   U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, speaking in Alabama on
Friday, stressed his concern about Japan's ailing economy. Rubin
has been pushing Japan for months to take measures to stimulate its
economy.
	   The fate of the rest of Asia's struggling economies depends on
Japan, Rubin said. ``It is a very serious problem for the world.''
	   Friday's numbers out of Tokyo depicted an economy in need of
serious first aid.
	   The government said gross domestic product, the sum of all goods
and services produced in Japan, fell by a steeper-than-expected 1.3
percent in the January-March quarter, following a drop of 0.4
percent in the previous quarter.
	   Two straight quarters of economic contraction is the generally
accepted definition of a recession.
	   Worse yet, the agency said Japan's GDP for fiscal year 1997,
which ended in March 1998, shrank by 0.7 percent, the first full
year of economic contraction since 1974, when the economy was
suffering from the oil shock.
	   The news in other Asian countries Friday was not much better.
	   Asian stock markets ended the week mixed, but the key index in
Seoul tumbled 8.1 percent _ its biggest ever one-day fall _ on
fears that the falling yen could wreck South Korea's own plans for
an export-led recovery.
	   While Japan hardly seems in a position to rescue Asia's other
ailing economies, the reverse is also true. The government said
falling demand for Japanese goods in Asia, Japan's largest market,
was a prime reason for Friday's negative numbers. Exports dropped
by 3.8 percent in the January-March quarter.
	   Japan's prospects for the current year are bleak. Economists say
a dlrs 116 billion stimulus package _ which represents 1 percent of
Japan's GDP _ will help growth, but won't be enough to sustain a
recovery.
	   While Japanese officials avoided the word ``recession'' in
addressing Friday's developments, they acknowledged the news was
bad.
	   ``The data illustrated the severity of the economy,'' said
Shimpei Nukaya, the top-ranking bureaucrat at the Economic Planning
Agency.

Twelve East Timorese political prisoners released

	   DILI, Indonesia (AP) _ Raising their fists in the air as they
walked from jail, a dozen political prisoners pardoned by
Indonesia's new president pledged to renew their pro-independence
campaign for East Timor.
	   The prisoners, many of them students, were freed Friday by
President B.J. Habibie, who is seeking an end to a conflict that
has plagued East Timor since Indonesia invaded the former
Portuguese colony in 1975 and annexed the territory a year later.
	   More than 1,000 protesters rallied Friday at the Foreign
Ministry in the Indonesian capital of Jakarta, pressing for a vote
on East Timor independence.
	   Police and troops broke up the rally by beating and kicking
protesters, confiscating rebel flags and anti-Indonesian banners
and herding people onto buses that were driven away under police
escort.
	   The Foreign Ministry said two East Timorese women were
hospitalized. A security guard also was treated after being hit by
a rock.
	   In Dili, the East Timorese capital, the 12 prisoners filed out
of Becora prison shouting separatist slogans and carrying plastic
bags full of clothes and other belongings. One man clutched a
chicken.
	   ``This freedom is good for our struggle. It's a victory for
us,'' said Tomas Augusto Correia, a 33-year-old municipal worker
who was among the detainees.
	   On Thursday, the prisoners in Dili refused to leave the jail,
saying they wanted freedom for rebel chief Xanana Gusmao. They
agreed to go Friday after giving wardens a litany of complaints,
ranging from the poor quality of prison food to military
repression.
	   Gusmao, 52, was arrested in 1992 and is serving a 20-year
sentence in a Jakarta prison. He is a hero to many East Timorese
who see him as a symbol of their struggle against Indonesian rule.
	   Habibie is reluctant to yield to demands for a referendum on
independence in East Timor. Instead, he has offered the area a
special status that might include some autonomy.
	   And the government has yet to make clear what it plans to do
with Gusmao, whose case has attracted international attention,
including a plea from South African President Nelson Mandela for
his release.
	   Tens of thousands of East Timorese died during Indonesia's
efforts in the 1970s to wipe out the area's independence movement.

World Cup: Rieper heads Denmark to 1-0 victory over Saudi Arabia

	   LENS, France (AP) _ Delighted coach Bo Johansson is confident
Denmark team can beat South Africa in its second Group C World Cup
encounter and make it to the next round.
	   ``We know they are a difficult team to beat but we know that we
can win so we will try to do the best,'' Johansson, a Swede, said
after the Danes' 1-0 victory over Saudi Arabia at Felix Bollaert
Stadium.
	   Danish supporters went into a frenzy as defender Marc Rieper
neatly headed a cross into the net to give Denmark its victory.
	   The Danes next face South Africa in Toulouse June 18 while Saudi
Arabia faces a daunting match against France in Saint-Denis on the
same day.
	   Rieper rose unmarked in the box in the 68th minute to secure the
points for the Danes after a poor show by Saudi Arabia.
	   ``We created a lot of chances so we should have won by a bigger
margin,'' Rieper said.
	   Denmark dominated through out the match but could not convert
its superiority into a goal until the second half before 38,140
fans at the 41,275-seater stadium.
	   Brian Laudrup and his older brother Michael, playing in his
100th international, caused problems for the Saudi defense, but
Denmark lacked a knockout punch.
	   Early in the match the Saudis continually squandered possession
with inaccurate passing, seemingly taking time to warm up on a cold
day in this northern French coal mining town.
	   The Saudi's coach, Carlos Alberto Parreira, who led Brazil to a
record fourth World Cup triumph four years ago, praised the Danes,
but also said his team had acquitted itself well.
	   ``We played against a good team with nice players and they did
well,'' he said.
	   Saudi Arabia played with style, especially in the second half,
Parreira said, but added that misplaced passes let them down. ``We
gave away so many balls,'' he said, ``so we lost a little
control.''
	   Denmark created ample chances _ Ebbe Sand and Martin Jorgensen
both missed good opportunities before the break.
	   But the Danes finally found a way to the net in the 68th minute
when Brian Laudrup crossed from the right to Rieper in the center
who headed past al-Deayea.
	   Saudi Arabia nearly pulled back a quick equalizer but Ibrahim
al-Shahrani's flicked header drifted wide after a good cross from
the right by Mohammed al-Jahani.
	   Denmark and Saudi Arabia both were making their second
appearances in the World Cup finals. The countries reached the last
16 in their previous visits to the finals, Denmark in 1986 and
Saudi Arabia in 1994.

Hernandez earns spot in Yankees' starting rotation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Orlando Hernandez, the Cuban defector who
sparkled in his first two starts in the majors, was promoted to the
No. 5 spot in the New York Yankees' rotation and Ramiro Mendoza was
sent to the bullpen Friday.
	   Yankees manager Joe Torre announced the move after Friday
night's game against the Cleveland Indians was rained out. Mendoza
had been scheduled to start.
	   ``It's tough to fight what you saw the other day, even though
Mendoza hasn't done anything wrong,'' Torre said.
	   Hernandez, who escaped from Cuba on a flimsy boat the day after
Christmas, has been everything the Yankees hoped for when they
signed ``El Duque'' to a dlrs 6.6 million, four-year contract.
	   The older half-brother of World Series MVP Livan Hernandez won
his big league debut last week, holding Tampa Bay to one run and
five hits in seven innings. On Tuesday night, he pitched a
four-hitter to beat Montreal.
	   At 2-0, Hernandez was too much to leave out of the rotation. And
the Yankees saw no sense in sending him back to Triple-A Columbus,
where he was 6-0.
	   Hernandez, whose next start will come at Baltimore, joins David
Cone, Andy Pettitte, David Wells and Hideki Irabu in a rotation
that has helped the Yankees post the best record in the majors.
	   Pettitte left Thursday night's game at Montreal with a slight
twinge, but was OK on Friday. Wells has been bothered by a stiff
left shoulder, but he is all right, too.
	   Mendoza has been more than fine, especially lately in going 4-1
with a 4.00 ERA in 11 starts. But the right-hander pitched well in
relief last season _ and made two appearances out of the bullpen _
and his ability to pitch effectively in that role put him back
there.
	   ``When you look at the six people, he's really the only one who
jumps out with the legitimate experience in the bullpen,'' Torre
said.
	   Mariano Rivera is the Yankees' closer and Mike Stanton and Jeff
Nelson serve as the lefty-righty setup men. Darren Holmes and
Graeme Lloyd also relieve, although Torre said there was plenty of
room for Mendoza.
	   ``He's going to be an integral part of our bullpen,'' Torre
said. ``We can use him in a number of ways.''

Andrews holds lead after second round
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   EAST LANSING, Michigan (AP) _ Donna Andrews survived a
double-bogey, a double hit and a 2 1/2-hour rain delay to shoot a
4-under-par 68 Friday and remain in the lead after the second round
of the LPGA Oldsmobile Classic.
	   Andrews, who is the tour's leading money-winner this season, is
at 12-under 132 midway through the dlrs 650,000 tournament, leading
Canadian Lisa Walters by two strokes with Meg Mallon another stroke
back.
	   Andrews, who has won more than dlrs 465,000 this season,
double-bogeyed No. 9, a 385-yard (350-meter) par-4 after hitting
her second shot into a bunker.
	   She double hit a chip shot on 15, a 397-yard par-4 and had to
make a short putt to save bogey.
	   ``I have hit a lot of good shots this week but I've made some
mistakes too,'' said Andrews, who opened with a 64 that gave her a
two-stroke lead. ``I've been able to get away with it. I've had my
share of good breaks and you just have to take what you get.''
	   Andrews, who won the Longs Drugs Challenge in April and who has
finished second each of the past three weeks, had not practiced a
bunker shot at Walnut Hills Country Club when she stepped into that
trap on No. 9.
	   ``It's my own fault,'' she said. ``I hadn't worked on it and I
hit a fat bunker shot. A lack of practice is what that was.''
	   A second round with seven birdies kept Andrews atop the
leaderboard.
	   ``I make mistakes but I try not to make a big deal out of it,''
Andrews said. ``I'm good about focusing in the present and not
worrying about what's in the past. There are a lot of birdies out
here and they are there for me if I hit the ball well.''
	   Walters is 10 under after two 67s. She birdied four of her first
six holes Friday morning then added a birdie on No. 12.
	   ``I drove and putted well but I missed greens due to the wind,''
Walters said. ``It was hard to judge because it was swirling.
(Thursday) I missed putts but today I made everything.''
	   Mallon had a second-round 66 to hold third place. Four players,
Mardi Lunn, Karrie Webb, Karen Weiss and Julie Piers are four
strokes back at eight under.

Yugoslavia talks tough to NATO

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The Yugoslav army doesn't want
conflict with NATO but will be forced to defend its territory if
the alliance intervenes in secessionist Kosovo, a top aide to
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic says.
	   Zoran Lilic, a close Milosevic aide who was Yugoslavia's
president until last year and is now a deputy premier, told The
Associated Press he does not regard violence in the southern
province of Kosovo as all-out war with dangerous regional
consequences. It is just a clash ``between security forces and the
terrorists'' of the Kosovo Liberation Army, he said.
	   The KLA, which emerged in 1996, is trying to win independence
for Kosovo, where about 90 percent of the population is Albanian.
	   Neighboring Albania and Macedonia on Friday hastily approved
exercises by NATO _ most likely simulated air raids _ in the air
over their countries. The exercises may start as soon as Sunday.
	   ``We know that in a clash with NATO _ it's stupid even to think
about that _ we don't stand a chance,'' Lilic said. ``But it is its
(Yugoslav army's) duty to defend the territory against anybody who
tries to enter by force.''
	   More than 250 people have died in clashes since government
forces in March began a crackdown on the KLA. Fighting has
escalated since, with the KLA claiming to control up to 40 percent
of Kosovo countryside, while key towns and roads remain in Serb
hands.
	   Milosevic revoked the province's broad autonomy in 1989, trying
to quash Albanians' push for independence and claiming to protect
Kosovo Serbs.
	   But nine years of heavy-handed rule by Serbia, the dominant
republic in Yugoslavia, have only fanned demands for independence.
The peaceful course pursued by ethnic Albanian political leaders is
losing ground to KLA militancy.
	   Kosovo's Albanians, protesting Serbia's rule, have boycotted all
Serbian elections since 1990, and founded alternative schools and
hospitals since being sacked or quitting most state jobs that year.
	   Lilic called on ethnic Albanians to use the rights they still
have and thus win local elections and return to Serbia's
parliament, where they can easily win at least 30 of the 250 seats.
	   Lilic denied that government forces are behaving brutally toward
Albanian civilians. Foreign diplomats allowed into the region of
the most recent severe fighting in western Kosovo saw scenes of
devastation reminiscent of Bosnia, with houses burned and shelled.
	   Lilic said the United States should persuade the Albanian
militants to cease fire, adding that action by government forces
would then automatically stop.
	   Montenegrin President Milo Djukanovic, who is at odds with
Milosevic, indicated Friday he might eventually withdraw
Montenegrin recruits from the federal Yugoslav army if it became
implicated in atrocities.
	   In Kosovo itself, Albanians welcomed a show of NATO air power as
a way of trying to get Milosevic to stop using force.
	   As the first in former Yugoslavia to feel Milosevic's power _ at
least 25 Kosovo Albanians were killed when he stripped their
autonomy from them in 1989 _ they say it's time the man who went on
to foment war in Croatia and Bosnia gets taught a lesson.
	   ``America can, and should, do it,'' said Eroll Haxhiu, 46, a
former postman who now sells jewelry in Pristina market.
	   Although NATO so far only threatens force, ``it is by far the
most serious threat to Milosevic regarding Kosovo,'' said Agron
Musaraj, 23, a law student. ``As we already saw in Bosnia,
Milosevic respects only force.''
	   Some Kosovo Serbs seemed resigned to NATO bombing, used in 1995
against the Bosnian Serbs. Others were defiant.
	   ``If they attack us, they'll be attacking a sovereign country,''
said Jovan Banjanin, 40, who refused to state his occupation. ``We
will have to defend ourselves, and this has nothing to do with the
ethnic Albanians' issue.''

	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ If the reserved Swedes are usually
loath to call attention to themselves, Stockholmers this year are
downright showing off. Sweden's capital has been designated the
1998 Cultural Capital of Europe.
	   The 15-nation European Union chooses a different city as
cultural capital each year. Last year it was Thessaloniki in Greece
and in 1999 it will be Weimar, Germany.
	   But for now it's Stockholm's time to preen.
	   Bright orange banners flutter against the city's subdued brown
buildings, pointing the way to the more than 1,000 exhibitions and
events for the year-long program, ranging from venues for the
performing arts to a crayfish festival, from the merry to the
magnificent.
	   With the arrival of summer, when the sun barely dips below the
horizon and the sky still glows at midnight, Swedes spend as little
time as possible indoors, so many of the events for June, July and
August will be held outside.
	   Plenty of foreign visitors will join them. About half of the
city's 1.8 million hotel guests last summer were foreigners, and
hotel bookings have increased about 10 percent this year, tourism
officials say.
	   ``The whole idea has been to see to it that Stockholm gets
noticed. So far it looks like we've succeeded,'' says Eric
Sjoestroem, a spokesman for the Cultural Capital program.
	   The proud Stockholmers will be quick to point out some of the
things that make their city unique. For example, some of the
country's best salmon fishing can be found in the center of the
island city and the lake water in most parts of the city is clean
enough to drink.
	   Water figures in many of the summer's events _ either as
backdrop or main element _ just as it is central to the city's
life. Stockholm is strewn across 14 islands, straddling the point
where Lake Malaren drains into an inlet of the Baltic Sea.
	   It's a handsome city of 1.6 million people, filled with parks,
squares and airy boulevards. It has plenty of glass-and-steel
skyscrapers, but you're never more than a 5-minute walk from a
medieval neighborhood or lakeside promenade.
	   On the downside, Stockholm is expensive. Visitors to restaurants
and bars will find that the capital's residents eat and drink very
well, but they don't do it cheaply. Dinner with wine runs about 400
kronor (dlrs 50 a person) and up; a bottle of beer in a respectable
bar is about (45 kronor) dlrs 6 .
	   Lunch can be a far better deal. Most restaurants serve a
prix-fixe lunch called the ``dagens raett'' that includes entree,
bread, salad and coffee for about 60 kronor (dlrs 8).
	   For those who favor do-it-yourself takeout, supermarkets are
plentiful, but not nearly as much fun as the covered markets called
``saluhalls.'' The one in the old-money neighborhood of Oestermalm
is a special favorite with its soaring basilica-like roof and
stands selling local delicacies such as reindeer meat and silky
herring marinated in an array of sauces.
	   Visitors who come in mid-August can take part in one of Sweden's
favorite rituals, the crayfish festivals. They cook up a big mess
of the crustaceans, don funny hats and tell foreigners that they're
expected to down a shot of aquavit with each crayfish, a feat few
can manage for very long.
	   A notable early summer spectacle will be June 13's Concerto
Borealis, when bell ringers at all of central Stockholm's churches
join in playing a piece specially written for their bells. On June
26 begins the three-day Ballad Festival along the edge of sprawling
Lake Malaren.
	   Throughout the summer the waters of Lake Malaren will be full of
boats in a series of special events: a steamboat festival July
10-14, a tall ships gathering July 16-20, and throughout the summer
a chance to ride in updated versions of the rowboats that once
transported commuters between the islands.
	   Then comes the Water Festival Aug. 7-15, a week of fireworks,
often-bizarre performance art, and pop concerts. Previous festivals
have featured the likes of Iggy Pop.
	   The water is also an important element in Stockholm's life in
another aspect: It rains a lot. On days when the summer sun is
overtaken by rain, the Cultural Capital program offers much of
interest indoors: a showing of all of Ingmar Bergman's films (with
English subtitles) from June 23-Aug. 5, several ``neo-circuses'' a
la the noted Cirque du Soleil, and in July-September a chance to go
to the Swap Your Life Travel Agency at which patrons get guidance
on how to live completely out of character for a day or two.
	   Also indoors in the summer is the exhibition of Joan Miro
paintings at the new Museum of Modern Art. The opening of the
museum, a masterly example of the Swedes' affection for understated
elegance, was a high point of the winter's Cultural Capital events,
so exciting Stockholmers that one newspaper christened museum
director David Elliott ``Babe of the Week.''
	   While the Cultural Capital programs focus on successes,
Stockholm's prime tourist attraction is a monument to an
astonishing failure: the Vasa, the warship that was supposed to be
the pride of the mighty Swedish fleet but which sank 15 minutes
into its maiden voyage in 1628. Recovered from the bottom of
Stockholm's harbor more than three centuries later, it's now housed
in an enormous museum.
	   Even older than the Vasa, and in much better shape, is Gamla
Stan, the old quarter of the city with buildings dating back to the
1200s and winding alleyways so narrow that a big man (or woman)
might scrape the sides of the buildings.
	   Just across a bridge from Gamla Stan, though often neglected by
tourists, is the island of Soedermalm, once the city's blue-collar
district but now mostly given over to artists, young professionals
and others who thrive on animated nightlife.

	   LAS MARGARITAS, Mexico (AP) _ Amid fears of renewed war between
Zapatista rebels and the government, Mexico's president flew to
Chiapas on Friday to defend his administration's stated desire for
dialogue and pledge money for towns where rebel support runs high.
	   Some analysts say a police and army raid on an Indian village
this week is the latest indication that the government has chosen
military might over talks.
	   But President Ernesto Zedillo told residents in Las Margaritas,
85 miles southeast of the state capital, Tuxtla Gutierrez, that the
government's goal is negotiation.
	   ``We want dialogue. We don't want to defeat anyone. The
government will not abandon this position,'' he said. Zedillo was
making his fourth visit to Chiapas in just over a month.
	   In Mexico City, the government's chief negotiator Emilio Rabasa
Gamboa asked a mediation group of legislators to help the
government set up a direct dialogue with the Zapatistas, the
government news agency Notimex reported.
	   As Zedillo spoke in Chiapas, about a dozen people unfurled
banners demanding a halt to violence. ``Senor Zedillo, we do not
want more war,'' one said.
	   Guadalupe Gonzalez, 33, held up a sign reading ``Senor Zedillo,
we want respect for our human rights,'' and said she is not sure
the government still wants to negotiate.
	   ``There is much repression. There is not much freedom of
expression,'' she said.
	   On Wednesday, government forces clashed with apparent Zapatista
rebels in the municipality of El Bosque as they tried to evict a
symbolic pro-rebel town council.
	   The clash, which killed nine people, was the first direct
skirmish between the two sides since peace talks broke down nearly
two years ago. The Zapatistas took up arms in 1994 to demand
greater democracy and Indian rights.
	   The dead included a 1-year-old child and a woman who supported
Zedillo's ruling party, according to a statement that the symbolic
town council issued Friday.
	   Some analysts said the government's tactics signaled that
officials have given up the idea of restarting talks and are
focusing instead on isolating the rebels from their civilian
supporters.
	   ``They have decided not to continue with negotiations, but they
can't say that because public opinion is in favor of resolving the
Chiapas problem through negotiations,'' said Lorenzo Meyer, a
political historian in Mexico City.
	   The U.N. high commissioner for human rights, Mary Robinson,
urged the government Friday to resume dialogue, calling Wednesday's
raid and other recent violence in Chiapas ``serious violations of
the rights of indigenous people.''
	   In a statement late Friday, the Mexican foreign secretariat
acknowledged Robinson's letter and said the government has stressed
the need to resolve the conflict through dialogue. He said Mexico
would send its representative to the United Nations, Antonio de
Icaza, to meet with Robinson to discuss its efforts to restore
order and fight poverty in Chiapas.
	   Amnesty International also denounced the raid and a clash
between soldiers and apparent rebels in Guerrero state which left
11 people dead last week.
	   Mexico's leading opposition parties, the pro-business National
Action Party and the leftist Democratic Revolution Party, called on
Zedillo's administration to reestablish talks.
	   In a speech Friday, Chiapas Gov. Roberto Albores Guillen took a
harder line than Zedillo, vowing to continue using force to achieve
what he called the rule of law.
	   ``The return to legality is not negotiable in Chiapas. We are
going to make the law prevail in Chiapas,'' he said.
	   In Las Margaritas, a lowland town where many government
supporters have sought refuge, Zedillo signed an accord granting
aid to 42 municipalities ``that need special attention,'' he said.
The list included all the rebel supporting towns the government has
raided in recent months _ including El Bosque.
	   The towns will receive dlrs 290 million this year for schools,
health clinics, water purification plants and roads.

	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ For all the Swedish capital's charms,
some might think its greatest asset is as a jumping-off point to
the Skaergaarden _ an intricate archipelago stretching some 40
miles (65 kilometers) to the open waters of the Baltic.
	   Boats of all sizes wind among the estimated 25,000 islands in
the archipelago: small turn-of-the-century steamboats, prosaic and
efficient cutter-style ferries and towering, garish overnight boats
to Finland.
	   A popular excusion for many tourists is the hour-long ferry to
Vaxholm, with its pleasant shops and well-preserved fortress. The
more adventurous head to some farther-flung islands for walking and
secluded swimming (if one's hardy enough to handle the cold
waters). Favorites include Grinda, Moeja and windswept Sandhamn at
the edge of the open sea.
	   Going out to sea may make one fantasize about being a Viking.
But the best tastes of Viking life in the Stockholm area are found
along fresh-water Lake Malaren. Boats run up the sprawling lake to
the painstakingly reconstructed Viking island settlement of Birka.
	   They also steam to Sigtuna, Sweden's oldest town, where ruins of
churches stand side-by-side with the pre-Christian Vikings'
runestones (with their cryptic inscriptions considerately
translated).
	   Also on the lake's shore is the very antithesis of primitive
life: the elegant Drottningholm. It is home both to the main royal
residence and to the world's oldest theater still using original
stage equipment. This summer's program focuses on C.W. Gluck, whose
operas date from the 1760s when the Drottningholm theater was
brand-new.

	    &UR; IF YOU GO ...
	   ARRIVING: Stockholm's Arlanda International Airport is about 40
kilometers (25 miles) from the city center. Taxi and express bus
service to the city is available.
	   Taxi prices are not regulated in Sweden and many unwary
travelers have found themselves paying fares of more than 800
kronor (dlrs 100). Most large cab companies offer fixed fares from
the airport of 350-390 kronor (about dlrs 45-50). The airport
maintains separate stands for fixed-fare cabs that are clearly
marked in English.
	   The express bus service, called Flygbussarna, costs 60 kronor
(dlrs 8) and runs to the central bus terminal. A combined ticket
for bus service to the station and cab to one's final destination
costs 140 kronor (dlrs 18) and 60 kronor (dlrs 8) for each
additional person up to a party of four.
	   GETTING AROUND: Stockholm's system of buses, subway lines and
commuter trains (collectively known as SL) is well-organized and
extensive, stretching far out of town into areas where bears have
been seen. One-day cards good for unlimited rides cost 60 kronor
(dlrs 8); three-day cards 120 kronor (dlrs 16). Cards and maps are
available at SL kiosks at the Hotorget and T-Centralen stations in
downtown.
	   Boats to the Stockholm archipelago leave from quays near the
National Museum and the Royal Dramatic Theater. Boats for Lake
Malaren trips depart from the quay near the City Hall.
	   WEATHER: In summer, temperatures occasionally rise above 18
degrees Celsius (75 degrees Fahrenheit), but rarely. Evenings are
coolish, around 15 degrees Celsius (60 F). Rain is to be expected,
usually in short showers. At the height of summer, the sun's up
nearly 20 hours a day, which light sleepers can find unsettling.
	   GENERAL INFORMATION: The main tourist information office is at
Sverigehuset, adjacent to the popular central Stockholm park
Kungstraedgaarden. The office provides free copies of the
comprehensive guide ``Stockholm This Week,'' and books tickets for
many events and excursions. The information center for Cultural
Capital of Europe is at Kulturhuset on Sergels Torg, three blocks
west.
	   LANGUAGE: Swedes are proud of their lingusitic abilities and
English is very widely spoken. Nevertheless, it is good manners to
inquire first ``Talar ni engelska? (Do you speak English?''

World Cup: For South Africa, being there is what mattered
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous &QL; 
 &UR; By TOM COHEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MARSEILLES, France (AP) _ Their heroes lost 3-0 to France in the
most lopsided match so far of the World Cup, but South African fans
said just being at the global soccer showcase was more important
than winning or losing.
	   It was South Africa's first World Cup appearance and several
hundred singing, flag-waving fans cheered their loudest despite the
one-sided score.
	   Shipping company official Phillip Malebe, 44, of Johannesburg
said he was amazed at how the event brought South Africans of all
colors and backgrounds together.
	   ``The fact is we are here. They brought us all here,'' said
Malebe, who wore a South African jersey. ``I've seen the beautiful
rainbow nation, all colors, singing our song. We were singing
together, we were passing drinks mouth-to-mouth. ... Just to be
here, we don't need the Cup.''
	   There will be other World Cups, more chances to shine across the
planet and create dreams for those back home. Friday's inaugural
appearance in soccer's biggest tournament was a coming of age for
players, fans and a nation that has long sought recognition, and
even more, acceptance.
	   Deputy President Thabo Mbeki, the heir apparent to Nelson
Mandela, was there, sitting with French Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin and World Cup organizing committee chairman Michel Platini.
	   Since arriving in France on Sunday, the players have been
reminded over and over that the bad old days of apartheid and
international isolation were gone. In Vichy, the central town where
they train, residents have welcomed them warmly, seeking autographs
at every chance.
	   Back home, the significance is even greater. South Africa has
enjoyed lots of sports success since its return to the
international arena in the early 1990s. Ernie Els has won two U.S.
Opens in golf, while Josia Thugwane was the Olympic marathon
champion and Penny Heyns won two swimming gold medals in Atlanta
two years ago. The rugby Springboks won their World Cup at home in
1995.
	   But soccer is the national sport, followed and played zealously
by most of the black majority. For 28 years, until 1992, South
Africa was banned from international soccer because of apartheid
and its players and fans could only wonder what a World Cup was
like.
	   Now they know.
	   French fans belted out a stirring ``La Marseillaise'' and the
French players responded, attacking the South Africans for most of
the first half and going ahead on a 35th minute header by
Christophe Dugarry.
	   South Africa lacked the speed and strength to win battles for
the ball, and its defensive shell allowed France to control play
and score twice more in the second half for a 3-0 victory.
	   ``I'm obviously disappointed but its not the end of the world,''
defender Mark Fish said.
	   He could have been speaking for the hundreds of flag-waving,
singing South African fans, who had waited a lifetime for Friday
night.

Kosovo separatists try to regroup after Serb offensive
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BRIAN MURPHY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TROPOJA, Albania (AP) _ The men who aspire to defeat the
battle-hardened Yugoslav military could barely keep from tearing
into each other.
	   In the village mosque Friday, about 30 ethnic Albanian refugees
from Kosovo argued wildly about a strategy for rejoining the
independence fight in the Serbian province. ``Now! We must go
now!'' shouted one man. ``I will lead you.''
	   ``No,'' countered another. ``We must wait and get real uniforms
and boots. And why should you lead? We need someone with military
experience.''
	   The meeting broke up, and the men _ still bickering _ streamed
out of the mosque, leaving a trail of orange-brown mud from their
shoes. No one bothered to take off footwear as Islamic custom
dictates.
	   But different rules often apply in this corner of the Balkans.
	   The Kosovo Liberation Army appears to have mushroomed into a
sizable militia without the usual consolidating influences: a clear
leadership and direction. Along the rebels' important supply
pipeline from Albania, a picture emerges of a group growing in
numbers but short on an overall plan for using its muscle.
	   In Albania _ where the rebels have attempted to regroup after
the latest Serb offensive _ there appears to be no established
procedure to recruit, train and equip. It's not clear the KLA can
mount a sustained guerrilla campaign against an army tested by
years of conflict within Yugoslavia.
	   A small force was capable of harassing Serb forces. But a much
larger militia is needed to back up the call for independence for
Kosovo, where almost 90 percent of the population is ethnic
Albanian.
	   Even some rebels admit they must try to unify as a fighting
force or risk splintering. ``Every army needs a general. At the
moment, we just have lots of lieutenants going in different
directions,'' said Miliam Coruca, who claimed he fought with the
KLA before retreating to Albania.
	   The rebels seem driven by a mentality of blood feuds and
vendettas that has ruled Albanian culture for centuries.
	   ``The Serbs kill us, we kill them,'' said Ilir Maliq, 24, a
refugee from the Kosovo village of Junik who vowed to return and
fight. But he looked bewildered when asked whether he could command
a group of guerrillas.
	   Many young ethnic Albanians in Kosovo lack the formal military
training other Yugoslavs get from compulsory army service _ most
tend to evade conscription into the Yugoslav army.
	   The ethnic Albanian political leader, Ibrahim Rugova, appears to
have little sway over the separatists. This opens the possibility
for ``spontaneous guerrilla actions'' that could flare into wider
conflict, said a Western military observer, insisting on anonymity.
	   The KLA has taken some steps to dispel the idea of disarray.
	   It announced through Albanian language newspapers in Kosovo on
Friday that it is organizing a fund, ``Homeland Calls,'' for
donations. It also identified an unknown teacher, Jakup Krasniqi,
as KLA spokesman. But there was no clarification of KLA objectives
or command structure.
	   Along the border in Albania, rebel activity is openly on
display. Regular convoys of mules loaded with arms and supplies
move toward mountain outposts in Kosovo. The family home of former
President Sali Berisha _ a champion of the separatist cause _ has
become a hub for stockpiling weapons and a kind of KLA nerve
center.
	   A large cache of guns and explosives outside the crumbling stone
farm house earlier this week was no longer visible by Friday. A man
who identified himself as Berisha's cousin told journalists they
were not welcome.
	   Rebel ranks appear to have swelled in a sign that there is at
least the raw manpower to challenge the Serbs if the conflict is
not defused.
	   Fighters _ some still boys wearing rock band t-shirts _ watch
the dirt roads coming from the border and escort new refugees down
toward Tropoja and other Albanian towns.
	   Almost every male refugee near the border is immediately
recruited. Some refugees say they were outfitted for free with
AK-47 rifles and ammunition. Others complain they must purchase
their weapon _ up to dlrs 300 for an AK-47 in good condition.
	   For now, money appears to buy leadership. Ethnic Albanian
emigres who have funneled money and materiel from Germany and
elsewhere in western Europe appear to be in charge of the Albanian
staging areas.
	   Hundreds of German military uniforms _ possibly purchased on the
black market _ have been distributed among the rebels.
	   But most newcomers in the rebel ranks still march back into the
hills with the same clothes they wore when they fled Kosovo.

	   The Forum Shops at Caesars Palace features expensive clothing
boutiques and ``Atlantis,'' an eight-stories high attraction with
animatronic figures telling the famous sea legend. Included is a
50,000-gallon (190,000-liter) aquarium featuring 650 exotic fish,
and an Imax 3D ride, ``Race for Atlantis.'' The Forum Shops draws
some 20 million visitors annually.
	   In January, the Las Vegas Hilton opened a dlrs 70 million Star
Trek attraction, featuring memorabilia for trekkie faithful and an
interactive ride into the 24th century.
	   William Bennett, who now owns the Sahara Hotel, has opened
Sahara Speedworld, where drivers of all ages take the wheel of a
three-quarter-size Indy car in a race simulator.
	   At the Monte Carlo Hotel-Casino, magician Lance Burton headlines
a show that is a big family draw.
	   Mirage's newest resort, the dlrs 1.6 billion Bellagio, will
include a dlrs 35 million water extravaganza on a lake in front of
the property when it opens in October. It will also be free to the
public.
	   Las Vegas visitors are surprised at the growing number of
attractions.
	   ``There's a lot more stuff for kids to do,'' Buru says. ``It's
not just gambling anymore. There's so many things to see and do.''
	   Richard Morales of El Paso, Texas agrees.
	   ``I was definitely surprised,'' he says, exiting the Secret
Garden area at The Mirage with his wife, Diana, and their
13-year-old daughter. ``I never dreamed there would be so much to
do.''
	   Mario and Rebecca Ramirez of Albuquerque, New Mexico, said it
was the first time they had brought their daughters, ages 12 and
15, to the city.
	   ``I'd have never thought there were so many attractions,''
Ramirez says. ``And I think a vacation here is cheaper, too.''
	   Schaeffer believes Las Vegas is growing as a family destination
``because the entire market is growing.''
	   ``While Las Vegas is family friendly, it's still an adult
market,'' Schaeffer says. ``The family market is a subset of the
tourism market.''

	    &UR; IF YOU GO ...
	    &UR; ROOM RATES: Lowest rates run mid-week, highest on the weekend.
On the high end, Caesars Palace, dlrs 109 to dlrs 279 for standard
rooms, The Mirage dlrs 79 to dlrs 159. Circus Circus dlrs 29 to
dlrs 89. All rates subject to availability; higher on major
holidays and during major conventions.
	    &UR; TRANSPORTATION: McCarran International Airport is an dlrs 8-
dlrs 15 taxi ride from the Strip; dlrs 15- dlrs 17 to the downtown
area. Vans go from the airport to various hotels. Numerous rental
car agencies at the airport. The Las Vegas Strip is about three
miles (4.8 kilometers) long and you can walk to and from many major
hotels. Some hotels also offer free shuttle buses between various
points. There is a free monorail covering the 1-mile
(1.6-kilometer) stretch between the MGM Grand and Bally's
hotel-casinos. In addition, a public bus system runs between
downtown and the Strip.
	    &UR; TOUR PACKAGES: Most travel agencies work with a host of tour
wholesalers who offer Las Vegas packages that include rooms, air
fare and ground transportation.
	    &UR; WEATHER: It may be hot, but it's a dry heat. Well, sort of.
Summer highs tend to park around the century mark, sometimes
reaching 110. Overnight lows are generally in the 70s and 80s. The
good news is that many days find the humidity in the single digit
range, more often 10 to 20 percent.
	    &UR; DRESS: Casual. Although you'll see some suits and cocktail
dresses at the major shows, the dress code has relaxed markedly
from the days when elegance was in. Locals dress for the hot
weather and visitors are learning to do the same. Don't forget the
swimwear and sunscreen.
	    &UR; MEALS: Leave the calorie counter behind. The city is famous for
its buffets, which range from dlrs 1.95 to dlrs 3.95 for breakfast,
dlrs 4.95 to dlrs 10.95 for dinner. Food prices are very reasonable
and many hotels offer ``graveyard specials'' such as steak and eggs
for around dlrs 1.95 to lure customers into the casinos after 11
p.m.

West, United, Delta, American, Continental, Reno Air, Northwest.

Sailing in the wake of the Vikings from Greenland to Newfoundland

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PORTLAND, Maine (AP) _ Oops! There goes the rudder.
	   Thus came to an end last year's attempt by W. Hodding Carter and
his crew to sail from Greenland to Newfoundland in a 54-foot
(16-meter) replica of a Viking ship powered by oars and sail.
	   But Carter will try again this summer to re-enact Leif
Eriksson's 1,500-mile (2,400-kilometer) voyage a millennium ago
that is widely accepted as the first contact between Europe and
North America.
	   The vessel went awry last summer because of rudder problems and
had to be towed back to Nuuk, Greenland, where it has remained in
dry dock awaiting this year's expedition.
	   The latest attempt to retrace the historic Viking voyage is
likely to lure tourists to the out-of-the-way places where the trip
began and ended and Carter, the modern-day incarnation of ``Leif
the Lucky,'' thinks that may be a mixed blessing.
	   Tourism promoters in both Greenland and Newfoundland are looking
for a boost in business as a result of publicity about the
expedition that will begin in July. Carter and his nine crew
members hope to complete the trip by September.
	   Carter, who plans to return to Greenland this month, became
familiar with the island last year. He sees it as a wonderful place
to hike and camp, but he worries that a surge in tourist pressure
could harm the environment.
	   ``You don't want it to become spoiled,'' he says. ``It's not
that I want to be selfish, but you want a place like this to stay
like it is _ pristine.''
	   Carter recalls trails lined with small birches, willows and
other dwarf trees, along with beautiful wildflowers and mosses,
some of them edible.
	   ``It's an amazing place to hike,'' he says. ``You walk for a
couple of hours and then you come to a glacier, perhaps 100,000
years old.''
	   Even without the Viking re-enactment, Greenland is poised for a
surge in tourism. The number of visitors had been limited to 5,000
in 1993, 10,000 in 1994 and 16,000 in 1995, but the
Danish-controlled island, which operates under home rule, has set
an ambitious target of 60,000 tourists annually over the next
decade.
	   Newfoundland, too, can expect a spike in tourist interest,
especially in L'Anse aux Meadows, a national historic site that
marks the only confirmed Viking settlement in North America.
	   While not as remote as Greenland, Newfoundland is also a place
of awesome beauty, Carter says. ``It has all these incredible
gorges and this unspoiled land in the interior, with beautiful
coastal towns and fishing villages.''
	   Carter plans to donate his Maine-built ship to L'Anse aux
Meadows, where it will serve as a reminder of the settlement that
the Vikings called Vinland because of the wild grapes they found
there.
	   Carter christened the wooden boat Snorri, the name given to the
first Viking child born in the New World.
	   Newfoundland has already started folding the Vikings and the
millennium into its tourism marketing for celebrations focusing on
the year 2000.
	   ``Come see what life was like a thousand years ago,'' says one
promo. ``Attend a Viking feast and a Viking yell-in, meet trader
Bjorn and his crew at a Viking encampment, and take a ride along
the coast in a replica of a Viking trading boat.''
	   Carter, whose interest in the Vikings dates back to the history
books he read as a child, plans to write a book about his
adventure.
	   In the meantime, his journey will be chronicled in his journal
on the World Wide Web and in the catalog of Lands' End, the
mail-order clothing company underwriting the trip.

Some 40,000 flee Guinea-Bissau as government, rebels exchange fire

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Government troops from the former
Portuguese colony of Guinea-Bissau kept up their siege of a group
of renegade soldiers as tens of thousands of people fled the
fighting, according to media reports.
	   As many as 40,000 people in the West African nation on foot
along clogged roads to the northern border with Senegal, a
Portuguese journalist reported on Friday.
	   Senegal closed the border on Thursday, and medical teams were
dispatched to vaccinate the refugees against yellow fever and
meningitis, Pedro Rosa Mendes told Portuguese state radio Antena 1.
	   Government troops, supported by soldiers from neighboring
Senegal and the Republic of Guinea, kept up their siege of a
military garrison in a northern suburb of the capital, Bissau,
where the rebels have been holed up since their coup attempt
Sunday.
	   The Portuguese Embassy in Bissau reported sporadic shelling and
automatic weapon fire in the capital throughout the day.
	   ``It's a very unstable situation. We're not sure who's
winning,'' the spokesman said on customary condition of anonymity,
adding that the embassy had been hit by several stray shells.
	   The French Embassy was hit by a bazooka shell, but no one was
injured, the Portuguese news agency Lusa reported.
	   The rebels are led by former armed forces chief Brig. Ansumane
Mane, who was fired in January amid allegations he was involved in
smuggling arms to rebels in Senegal. He has accused President Joao
Bernardo Vieira of corruption and called on him to step down so
that early elections can be held.
	   Vieira himself came to power in a 1980 coup. He was then elected
in the country's first democratic elections four years ago.
	   More than 2,200 people, mostly foreigners, were evacuated from
Bissau to Dakar, Senegal, on a packed Portuguese merchant ship
Thursday, with children and elderly people squeezed onto the deck.
	   A Portuguese frigate was expected to arrive in Guinea-Bissau on
Sunday to oversee the evacuation of more foreigners, diplomats
said.
	   The Portuguese phone company Marconi said international phone
lines apparently had been cut in Bissau.
	   Portuguese residents in Bafata, the country's second-largest
city 90 miles to the east, told Lusa there was no military activity
in the area.

European Union says safest roads are in Britain and Sweden
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ If you're planning to drive in Europe,
getting behind the wheel is considerably safer in Britain and
Sweden, statistics show. Portugal and Greece are the most
hazardous.
	   The European Union, which is working hard to form market
standards through a common currency for 15 European countries, last
week released a comparative auto fatality report based on 1995
figures.
	   The EU statistics agency Eurostat said for each one million
inhabitants, 64 people died on British roads in 1995 and 65 in
Sweden.
	   The figures for Portugal and Greece were 217 and 195,
respectively
	   Almost 44,200 people lost their lives on roads in the EU in
1995, 14 percent less than in 1989, the report said.
	   The situation improved in nearly all 15 EU countries in the
1989-1995 period, except in Italy, Luxembourg, and Greece.

 &UR; Magazine ranks the world's hotels providing the best service
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Really topnotch hotel service isn't easy to come
by. First, you need the money. In most cases, you also need to
travel overseas.
	   Of the world's top 10 hotels providing the best service, as
ranked by Travel and Leisure magazine in its June issue, only two
are in the United States: the St. Regis (formerly the Ritz-Carlton)
in Aspen, Colorado, and the Ritz-Carlton in Naples, Florida. The
Aspen hotel ranked No. 5 and the Naples hotel was No.7.
	   The Oriental in Bangkok offers the best service in the world,
the magazine said. Its staff to guest ratio is 2.5 to 1.
	   Close on its heels were The Peninsula in Hong Kong and the Ritz
in Paris. The Ritz-Carlton in Cancun was ranked No. 4.
	   The bottom half of the creme de la creme were: No. 6, Four
Seasons Resort in Hualalai, Hawaii; No. 8, Amanpuri, Phuket,
Thailand; No. 9, Halekulani, Oahu, and No. 10, Lodge at Koele,
Lanai, Hawaii.
	   The magazine didn't say how it conducted its poll, or how many
people responded.

 &UR; Butterflies return to Memphis zoo for popular show
	   MEMPHIS, Tennessee (AP) _ Picture about 1,200 butterflies in 43
species _ all in one horseshoe-shaped, net-covered garden at one
time.
	   Add the sounds of New Age music in the background and water
trickling over rocks into fish-filled ponds.
	   The stage is set for the Memphis Zoo's encore of the world's
largest exhibit of U.S. butterflies, credited with boosting last
year's June-to-September zoo attendance by 16 percent over the
previous summer.
	   Since butterflies live up to only two weeks, maintaining the
colorful collection presents special challenges. It requires
obtaining weekly supplies of butterfly larvae and moth cocoons from
Florida and Texas.
	   The zoo logged more than 100,000 visits to the display last
year, says zoo spokeswoman Jennifer Coleman.
	   ``Butterflies: In Living Color'' runs through Oct. 4. Cost is
dlrs 1, in addition to the cost of zoo admission.

 &UR; West Virginia trying to lure white water enthusiasts
	   CHARLESTON, West Virginia (AP) _ Hoping to one-up fly-and-drive
vacation packages, West Virginia tourism companies are pushing
white water rafting deals.
	   A fly-and-raft vacation plan is available to Charleston from
airports in Atlanta and Washington, D.C., and will be available
late this summer from Chicago, Yeager Airport officials announced
last week.
	   The package will include round-trip air fare, a rental car,
two-night's accommodations and a full day of white water rafting on
the New or Gauley rivers for dlrs 446 per person, based on double
occupancy.
	   Both the rugged Gauley and the tamer New rivers take white water
enthusiasts through steep, pristine canyons. Both are about an
hour's drive from Charleston.
	   Tourism officials are hoping the flights will lure more white
water enthusiasts, since few carriers serve West Virginia.
	   Other partners in the promotional venture are the Charleston
Convention and Visitors Bureau, the Charleston Marriott hotel,
Budget Rent-a-Car, white water Class VI and Appalachian Wildwaters.
The Division of Tourism provided a matching grant.
	   Air service is provided by Atlantic Southeast Airline from
Atlanta and Atlantic Coast Airline from Washington, D.C.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   COPPER CANYON, Mexico (AP) _ If you're in the mood to pay dlrs
500 to sleep in a cave for a night, a mountain lodge here can put
you up in an ancient Tarahumara Indian dwelling.
	   Room 18A is hidden among huge boulders and near a small stream,
but it's just 1,000 feet (300 meters) from the Sierra Lodge's log
porch.
	   The room has a dirt floor and rock ceiling that is charred from
centuries of cooking fires. It's equipped with a log bed, night
stand and lantern. Guests are encouraged to build a fire to keep
off the night chill.
	   Tarahumara Indians have lived in rock caves for nearly 400
years, and many still inhabit the more remotely situated caves in
the deep copper canyons near Creel in the state of Chihuahua.
	   Information about the area can be found at the Web site:
www.coppercanyonlodges.com. The agent for Sierra Lodge can be
reached at 1-800-776-3942.

	   BRANSON, Missouri (AP) _ Music fans headed for Branson can now
fly by commercial airline to the Ozark playground, provided they
don't mind going through Texas.
	   Aspen Mountain Air has begun two daily nonstop flights from the
Dallas-Fort Worth to the M. Graham Clark airport in Branson.
	   The hour-long flights depart from Texas at 11 a.m. and 4:55
p.m., with return flights at 1:15 p.m. and 6:35 p.m.
	   Flight reservations and information on tour packages are
available through Country Tours at (888) 458-9696. Reservations can
also be made through Aspen Mountain Air, (800) 877-3932, or through
any travel agent.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Boldly striking just outside the
capital, Kosovo's ethnic Albanian militants said they killed two
Serb policemen in one of a series of attacks around the
secessionist province.
	   Rebels also Friday claimed to have mustered a 15,000-strong
fighting force for the escalating battle against Serb rule. The
Kosovo Liberation Army, a shadowy group that first emerged in 1996,
said it intended to prove it has a large force uniting the
province's majority ethnic Albanians.
	   The growing violence has arroused fears among Western powers
that a new Balkan war is in the making, one that could spread to
neighboring states.
	   In an effort to persuade Serbia to halt its offensive, NATO
plans simulated air attacks. Adding to the pressure, the world's
leading industrialized nations have imposed economic sanctions
against Serbia.

Five senior Khmer Rouge leaders defect to government
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) - Five leaders of the withering Khmer
Rouge guerrilla movement have defected to the government, saying
war in their shattered nation has lasted long enough, official
media said late Friday.
	   A broadcast by Cambodian National Television said the defectors
signed a statement pledging to sever their relations with the
guerrillas June 11.
	   The defections leave the once dreaded and powerful Khmer Rouge
with only a handful of veteran leaders including Nuon Chea, Ta Mok
and nominal head Khieu Samphan.
	   ``Having seen that it is necessary to end the war which has been
prolonged for many years already, we have decided ... to rejoin our
national society,'' the defectors said. The statement said the five
made their decision May 3.
	   The defectors were listed as Mak Ben, the former minister of
economy and trade, Chan Youran, deputy prime minister, In Sopheap,
minister of immigration and two others of the ruling circle _ Chuon
Cheoun and Kor Bun Heng.
	   ``We recognize Cambodia's constitution and the current royal
government of Cambodia,'' their statement said. ``We recognize the
role of His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk, who is the symbol and
the cool shade of our Cambodian nation.''
	   According to the television announcement the statement was made
in the Thai-Cambodian border town of Pailin, which is the
stronghold of another Khmer Rouge defector, Ieng Sary.
	   While Ieng Sary pledges his allegiance to the Phnom Penh
government, he has been allowed to maintain a degree of autonomy in
the Pailin area.
	   Only several hundred hardline Khmer Rouge guerrillas are
believed left, most of them near the northern Cambodian border with
Thailand.

Security Council moves toward new, tough sanctions against UNITA,
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with EU statement
 &UR; By ROBERT H. REID &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Security Council has given former
Angolan rebels until June 23 to fulfill conditions of a peace plan
or sweeping economic sanctions will take effect automatically two
days later.
	   The sanctions, approved late Friday, include a freeze on foreign
bank accounts of the UNITA movement and a ban on sales of diamonds
mined in areas under UNITA's control. UNITA earns hundreds of
millions of dollars annually from diamond exports.
	   Under a unanimous resolution, UNITA must demobilize its
remaining forces, hand over its central highland strongholds, allow
U.N. monitors to verify compliance and cease attacks on U.N. and
government personnel by June 23.
	   Otherwise, the sanctions kick in automatically at one minute
after midnight June 25 New York time.
	   Envoys from the United States, Russia and Portugal, which
oversee the 1994 Angolan peace agreement, said the sanctions were
designed to save the peace process and appealed to UNITA to meet
the deadline for compliance.
	   ``The international community, which has invested heavily in
helping Angolans toward peace, is in a position now to demand that
these substantial efforts (toward peace) not be thrown away,''
Portugal's ambassador, Antonio Monteiro, said.
	   ``We appeal to UNITA to heed the message of this council,'' he
added. ``UNITA should seize this opportunity to cooperate fully as
a political party in the consolidation of democracy in Angola,'' he
said.
	   Under the 1994 agreement, UNITA _ a Portuguese acronym for the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola _ agreed to
hand back to the government the 50 percent of the country it seized
during the civil war.
	   UNITA also agreed to demobilize its fighters and integrate them
into the national army in return for a role in the government. But
implementation has been slow, and the United Nations blames UNITA
for most of the delays.
	   ``We applaud the Angolan government's patience and continued
flexibility in the face of these incidents.'' British Ambassador
Jon Weston said, speaking for the European Union.
	   ``We urge the government to resist the temptation to act
militarily in response to provocation by UNITA to govern the
activities of the Angolan national police and to continue to work
for a peaceful solution,'' Weston said.

Dancing and chanting, East Timorese students stage protest

<TEXT>
	   DILI, Indonesia (AP) _ Stepping up their demands for
independence from Indonesia, more than 1,000 students protested
Saturday in East Timor, dancing, raising their fists and chanting
the name of the jailed rebel chief they adore.
	   It was the second large protest this week in the former
Portuguese colony, with demonstrators reiterating demands for a
vote on independence as well as the release of rebel Xanana Gusmao,
who is serving a 20-year sentence in a Jakarta jail.
	   ``Free Xanana. You sent him to prison because he fought for our
freedom,'' read a banner at the rally in a palm-tree-dotted yard at
East Timor University. Other crude poster sketches depicted
Indonesian soldiers stabbing civilians and giving them electric
shocks with wires.
	   Smiling protesters, many wearing headbands declaring
``Referendum,'' held hands and shuffled in a traditional dance.
``The struggle continues,'' they shouted in Portuguese.
	   Animosity among East Timorese runs deep toward Indonesia, which
invaded in 1975 and wiped out most armed resistance in a military
campaign that lasted several years. Human rights workers say tens
of thousands of people died.
	   Indonesia defends its record, pointing to the large amount of
aid it has funneled into East Timor after centuries of Portuguese
neglect. A large minority of the population now consists of
entrepreneurial newcomers from other Indonesian islands.
	   President B.J. Habibie, who is promising a new era of reform
after the downfall of his authoritarian mentor, Suharto, has
suggested special status for troubled East Timor. On Friday, a
dozen political prisoners were freed from a jail in Dili, the
seaside capital of the half-island territory of 800,000 people.
	   However, East Timorese activists reject the measures as
inadequate, saying they will settle for nothing less than total
independence.
	   On Friday, security forces broke up a rally by East Timorese
separatists at the Indonesian foreign ministry in Jakarta,
pummeling some protesters with clubs. And memories are fresh of a
1991 demonstration in Dili in which soldiers opened fire, killing
dozens of pro-independence activists.
	   Anxious to avoid a confrontation, protest organizers in Dili
notified the military and the governor's office of their plans and
roped off sections of the rally site to keep order. Many students
arrived on packed buses, with some sitting on the roofs.
	   ``We won't stop the demonstrations until Xanana is released and
we get a referendum,'' said Vera Lucia, a student protester.

Phillies shut out Cubs, Marlines beat Mets 4-3
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHILADELPHIA (AP) _ Curt Schilling matched a season-high with 13
strikeouts in seven innings and Rico Brogna hit a two-run homer,
leading the Philadelphia Phillies to a 4-0 victory over the Chicago
Cubs on Friday night.
	   Schilling (6-7) allowed four hits in his first victory in six
starts. The right-hander raised his major league-leading strikeout
total to 156.
	   Mark Leiter pitched two innings of one-hit relief.
	   Philadelphia took a 2-0 lead off Kevin Tapani (8-4) in the first
when Scott Rolen hit a two-out single and Brogna followed with his
12th homer. Brogna left the game in the sixth because an inflamed
right shoulder.
 &UR; Reds 8, Astros 1 &QC; 
	   In Cincinnati, Barry Larkin spent two hours in the front office
talking about his trade request, then singled in a four-run first
and added a solo homer and a sacrifice fly as the Reds beat
Houston.
	   Cincinnati hit five singles in a four-run first off Jose Lima
(7-3) to set up only their second victory in 10 games. Larkin had
the second of the singles and scored a run to help the Reds snap a
five-game losing streak.
	   Larkin also led off the third with his fifth homer and his first
since May 29. He completed the night with a sacrifice fly in a
three-run eighth.
	   Mike Remlinger (4-7) gave up a game-opening homer to Craig
Biggio, but allowed only one more hit, walked two and struck out
five in eight innings.
 &UR; Expos 7, Braves 5 &QC; 
	   In Atlanta, Montreal's Darond Stovall hit a grand slam in the
ninth inning and the Expos' bullpen faltered again, blowing a
three-run lead as the Expos rallied for the victory.
	   Greg Maddux worked seven strong innings in his bid to become the
majors' first 10-game winner, but it was wasted by Mark Wohlers and
Mike Cather.
	   With the Braves up 5-2 in the ninth, Wohlers walked Chris Widger
on four pitches, and was replaced by Cather (2-2), who hit Mark
Gruzielanek and walked Brad Fullmer to load the bases. Stovall,
hitting only .218, followed with an opposite-field drive to left.
	   Miguel Batista (2-3) picked up the victory, and Ugueth Urbina
got the final three outs for his 16th save. Ryan Klesko homered for
the Braves.
 &UR; Brewers 4, Pirates 2 &QC; 
	   In Pittsburgh, Jose Valentin hit his first two home runs since
April 27 to back Scott Karl's effective pitching as Milwaukee beat
the Pirates.
	   Karl (6-3) allowed two runs and five hits over 6 1-3 innings.
	   Pittsburgh loaded the bases in the ninth off Bob Wickman on a
walk to Kevin Young and singles by Jermaine Allensworth and Jose
Guillen. But Wickman struck out Aramis Ramirez looking and got
Kevin Polcovich to hit into a game-ending double play for his
fourth save.
	   Ramirez's first major league homer gave Pittsburgh a 1-0 lead in
the second, but Valentin answered in the third with the first of
his two leadoff homers off Francisco Cordova (6-4).
 &UR; Marlins 4, Mets 3 &QC; 
	   In Miami, Todd Dunwoody drove in the winning run with a two-out
infield single in the ninth as Florida beat New York.
	   Gregg Zaun drew a one-out walk and Craig Counsell reached on a
forceout, hitting a grounder that glanced off the pitching hand of
Brian Bohanon (2-3).
	   Bohanon was examined, but continued and gave up a single to John
Cangelosi that sent Counsell to third. Dunwoody followed with a
grounder that second baseman Carlos Baerga knocked down, but could
not control.
	   Matt Mantei (1-0) pitched two scoreless innings for the victory.
	   Florida tied it at 3 in the eighth on Todd Zeile's RBI single.

Baltimore beat Toronto 9-5; Red Sox defeat Devil Rays 5-1

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Joe Carter drove in three runs in his first game
back at the SkyDome and Mike Mussina won for the first time since
his nose was broken by a line drive as Baltimore beat Toronto 9-5
on Friday night.
	   Carter, who left as a free agent after seven seasons with the
Blue Jays, drove in two runs in the third on a triple that left
fielder Jose Canseco allowed to roll to the wall. Carter added an
RBI double in the eighth.
	   Mussina (5-3) allowed two runs and seven hits in 5 1-3 innings.
He was making his second start since being struck by a line drive
hit by Cleveland's Sandy Alomar on May 14. Juan Guzman (3-8) took
the loss.
	   B.J. Surhoff hit a two-run homer for the Orioles. Mike Stanley
hit two home runs and Tony Fernandez also homered for the Blue
Jays.
 &UR; Red Sox 5, Devil Rays 1 &QC; 
	   In Boston, Reggie Jefferson hit a two-run homer and Troy O'Leary
got two hits for the fifth straight game Friday night, leading the
Red Sox over Rolando Arrojo and Tampa Bay.
	   Arrojo (8-4) lost for just the second time in nine starts
despite tying a season-high with nine strikeouts. He allowed two
runs on five hits in seven innings and walked four.
	   Arrojo was making his first start since learning Saturday that
his mother and brother, along with his brother's wife and two
children, had escaped Cuba on a boat. Arrojo defected in 1996.
	   O'Leary was 2-for-2 with two walks a run and an RBI to help Tim
Wakefield (7-3) win for the first time in four starts. The Red Sox
scored three runs in the eighth off Jim Mecir to secure the
victory, their third in a row.
 &UR; Indians-Yankees, ppd., rain &QC; 
	   In New York, the Indians-Yankees game was postponed because of
rain. No makeup date was immediately announced.
	   Orlando Hernandez, the Cuban defector who sparkled in his first
two starts in the majors, was promoted to the No. 5 spot in the New
York Yankees' rotation and Ramiro Mendoza was sent to the bullpen.
	   Yankees manager Joe Torre announced the move after the game
against the Indians was rained out. Mendoza had been scheduled to
start.
 &UR; Royals 7, Tigers 3
	   In Kansas City, Missouri, Jeff King had three hits and drove in
four runs, leading the Royals past Detroit.
	   King had a two-run single in a four-run third, and added another
two-run single in the fourth as Kansas City took a 7-1 lead. He
extended his hitting streak to a season-high seven games and has 14
RBIs in his last 14 games.
	   Jose Rosado (2-5) went eight innings for the victory, giving up
nine hits with six strikeouts and one walk. Bryce Florie (4-2) took
the loss.
	   Tony Clark and Joe Randa homered for the Tigers.

	   SAN JOSE, Costa Rica (AP) _ Foreigners arrested in the United
States do not necessarily have the right to meet with consular
officials under international law, U.S. officials told the
Inter-American Court of Human Rights.
	   The United States is asking the court to reject a request by
Mexico to clarify the rights of suspects arrested in foreign
countries _ especially in cases that could involve the death
penalty. The court, based in the Costa Rican capital, San Jose, is
holding hearings Friday and Saturday.
	   Mexico, Honduras and Paraguay have protested the executions of
their citizens in the United States, arguing the prisoners were not
given the right to contact consular officials. Mexico claims that
under the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, a country should
notify the appropriate consulate when a foreigners are arrested to
help guarantee the rights of the suspects.
	   The United States says the convention establishes no such
requirement and that consulates can seldom provide effective legal
assistance.
	   ``Consulate notification is not indispensable'' to assure a fair
trial, the U.S. delegate, Catherine Brown, told the court Friday.
	   She asked the court to rule that it lacks the authority to act
on Mexico's request.
	   A ruling against the United States would be largely symbolic.
The United States never signed the American Convention on Human
Rights and is not bound by rulings of the court, which is under the
Organization of American States.
