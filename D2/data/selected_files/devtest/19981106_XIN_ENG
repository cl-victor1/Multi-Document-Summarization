<HEADLINE> Iran Expresses Surprise Over Armenia's Mediation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Ministry
spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi on Thursday expressed surprise at the
offer made by Armenian Foreign Minister Vardan Oskanyan to
mediate between Iran and Israel.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi said the offer made by Oskanyan during his recent
visit to Israel was "uncalculated and not based on reality," the
official Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"All political experts are fully aware of Iran's view points on
the Zionist (Israeli) regime, and the Armenian foreign minister's
remarks are indicative of his lack of knowledge about Iran's
principled stances," he said.
</P>
<P>
Iran has not given diplomatic recognition to Israel.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also warned about dangerous consequences of
Israel's influence in the region.
</P>
<P>
Referring to military clashes between groups in northern
Tajikistan, he strongly condemned the clashes and termed them as
"contrary to Tajik national interests."
</P>
<P>
Given the risk that the instability in Afghanistan can spread
to Central Asia, Iran calls on all Tajik groups not to allow the
undermining of the Tajik national unity and authority of its
government, he said.

<HEADLINE> Gender Inequality Abounds in Elementary Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 5 (Xinhua) -- A recent survey shows that
Chinese children are exposed to gender inequality as early as
kindergarten due to the biased attitudes of teachers.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted by Beijing Normal University (BNU) to
test the gender awareness in elementary school education, asked
kindergarten teachers to describe difference between male and
female students.
</P>
<P>
Most respondents tended to use words such as courageous, brave
and energetic for male children, and careful, gentle and lovely
for female children.
</P>
<P>
"While the all characteristics should apply equally to both
genders, a biased teacher might refer to a male child as
effeminate if act a certain way, and a female a masculine."
according to BNU Professor Zheng Xinrong.
</P>
<P>
The survey found the fact that both male and female
kindergarten children are required to be obedient and strictly
attentive has, at least in part, hindered their creativity,"
according to Zheng.
</P>
<P>
"Education should be completely free of gender stereotypes,
regardless of which gender," said Zheng, adding that an ideal
approach to education is to combine toughness with tenderness, and
femininity with masculinity.
</P>
<P>
Gender inequality was also detected in primary and middle
schools, where girls will hear "biased comments" from teachers
such as "girls will lag behind by boys in high school even they
work hard," or "girls are inferior to boys in logical thinking,"
and "boys are more capable than girls when it come to study the
natural sciences and engineering."
</P>
<P>
Some teachers admitted that they like to let male students
answer more difficult and challenging questions, with easier
questions left for female students.
</P>
<P>
"This may affect the desire of female student to achieve and in
turn bring their talents into full play," said Zheng. "It can also
place greater psychological pressure on male students and
encourage gender discrimination in society."
</P>
<P>
A number of colleges and universities in China have opened
courses on gender education and women studies to enhance student
awareness. Some institutions have also established research
centers to study the female population.
</P>
<P>
"Society should further promote an awareness of gender equality
in order to provide provide people, especially females, with
equal opportunities in terms of employment and self-development,
and in turn help adolescent form healthy characteristics and
personalities," according to Professor Zheng.

WASHINGTON, November 5 (Xinhua) -- More than 250,000 kilograms
of ground beef in 33 U.S. states have been recalled because the
meat might contain a deadly strain of E. coli.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai's New Regulations Govern Marriages to Foreigners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The Standing Committee of the
Shanghai Municipal People's Congress today approved new
regulations governing the registration and counselling management
of marriages involving foreign citizens and overseas Chinese.
</P>
<P>
One regulation prohibits matchmaking agencies from profiting
from arranging marriages involving foreign citizens and overseas
Chinese, and stipulates violations will be subject to heavy fines
and the confiscation of illegally earned income.
</P>
<P>
The regulations also cover residents in Hong Kong, Macao and
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The number of Shanghainese marrying foreigners and overseas
Chinese has increased by 3,000 couples annually in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The rising trend has also been accompanied by a number
emerging problems. For Example, certain matchmaking agencies from
both at home and abroad have concentrated solely on earning
extravagant profits and engaged in actions which have caused
clients to suffer mental distress and financial losses.
</P>
<P>
The new regulations will protect the legal rights of both
parties involved in related marriages and guarantee the healthy
development of the counselling service, according to a member of
the standing committee.
</P>
<P>
Shanghainese desiring to either marry or divorce foreign
spouses, or overseas Chinese, will be required to register with
the municipal civil affairs departments along with their spouse.
</P>
<P>
Relevant departments will complete an investigation and issue
marriage or divorce certificates to qualified couples within 30
days.
</P>
<P>
Matchmaking agencies and related organizations will be
prohibited from profiting by offering services to foreign
citizens and overseas compatriots. However, counselling services
approved by the local civil affairs department will be permitted.
</P>
<P>
The regulations shall go into effect on December 1.

<HEADLINE> EU Outlines Benefits of Single Market for Pension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 5 (Xinhua) -- European Commissioner Mario
Monti said Thursday the establishment of a single market for
supplementary pension schemes would bring benefits to pensioners.
</P>
<P>
Monti told a European Policy forum Conference here that
supplementary pension funds are major institutional investors in
the European Union (EU) but operate mainly on a national basis.
</P>
<P>
These funds, said the commissioner in charge of financial
services, are holding assets amounting to more than 20 percent of
the 15-nation EU's gross domestic product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
And their importance could grow even more, as basic state
pension schemes are constraints, he said.
</P>
<P>
Monti planned to present a proposal early next year to ensure
that supplementary pension funds "are allowed to invest freely and
to use the services of approved managers anywhere in the EU."
</P>
<P>
The advantages of a wider and more liquid capital market
resulting from a single market for pension funds were underlined
by all consulted parties and featured prominently in the EU
"Framework of Action" for financial services unveiled last week.
</P>
<P>
"I hope the Vienna European Council in December will provide
the necessary political impetus to achieve this objective," he
said, adding that it in turn would benefit future generations of
workers, the financial services industry and national exchequers.

offered by inland areas have provided investors from Hong Kong and
Macao with excellent business development opportunities and have
enabled them to optimize Hong Kong's industrial structure and
improve economic competitiveness, according to Wan.
</P>
<P>
Investors from the two regions have provided fund, technology,
and both management and marketing expertise to inland
areas. Overseas-funded companies has also helped expand China's
links with the internation economy, said Wan.
</P>
<P>
He said companies established with funding from Hong Kong and
Macao will find even greater support from the inland areas during
the process of realizing the nation's trans-century goals, and
will continue to play an active role in promoting the reform and
opening-up policies.
</P>
<P>
Wan said that the development of Taiwan-funded companies has
promoted mutually beneficial economic relations between inland
areas and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that Taiwan will make the right decisions by
fully considering the interests of both Taiwan residents and the
Chinese nation as a whole, and will in turn contribute to peaceful
cross-Straits reunification.

for the Promotion of Peaceful Reunification and the Hong Kong
Universe Group.

WASHINGTON, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The number of first-time
claims for unemployment benefits rose last week by 10,000 to a
seasonally adjusted 312,000, but the nationwide unemployment
remains at a low level, the Labor Department said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Claims had fallen by a revised 17,000 the week before.
</P>
<P>
A more reliable four-week moving average of claims was at

2,500-claim pick-up.
</P>
<P>
Unemployment edged up slightly, but remained near a
generational low of 4.6 percent, in September.
</P>
<P>
Through most of this year, a spending spree by American
consumers has helped insulate U.S. companies from economic
problems spreading around the world.
</P>
<P>
The government reported last week that the American economy
grew at a healthy seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.3 percent
in the third quarter, surprising analysts who have been expecting
to see more fallout from the global financial trouble.

WASHINGTON, November 5 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Thursday rejected suggestions that U.S. allies in the Gulf did not
support U.S. policy on the new stand-off with Iraq on weapons
inspection.
</P>
<P>
"We believe we'll have the support we need, and all options are
on the table," Clinton told reporters after a meeting with
congressional Democratic leaders.
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary William Cohen is on a tour in the Gulf,
lobbying for a tougher policy against Iraq, which decided to
suspend all cooperation with the U.N. inspectors.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that many states in the Gulf differed with the
United States and do not support a military way to resolve the
crisis.
</P>
<P>
"Actually, my information is that Secretary Cohen had a good
trip, and we believe we'll have the support that we need for
whatever decisions we ultimately make," said Clinton.

Meanwhile, Clinton is dispatching his national security
adviser, Sandy Berger, to Europe this weekend to consult with U.S.
allies on the latest crisis with Iraq, a spokesman said Thursday.

LONDON, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Former British Environment
Secretary John Gummer Thursday urged the European Union to put
pressure on the United States to reduce its greenhouse gas
emissions.
</P>
<P>
Gummer, who was speaking at a parliamentary conference, said

</P>
<P>
President's Press Secretary Hope Kivengere told Xinhua

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Launches Polio Immunization Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, November 5 (xinhua) -- Ethiopia Thursday launched
the 1998 nation-wide polio immunization campaign aimed to
vaccinate over 9 million children under the age of five.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the launching ceremony held at Addis Ababa Stadium
here, Speaker of the House of People's Representatives Dawit
Yohannes stressed that the Ethiopian government is making
the maximum effort to kick polio out of Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
He urged the general public to actively participate in the
immunization campaign.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia is among the nine countries in the world where
children are still vulnerable the wide spread of polio virus.
Ethiopia plans to eradicate polio by year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The three-day first phase of nation-wide polio immunization
campaign will begin this Friday while the second phase will be conducted
on December 4-6, this year.
</P>
<P>
According to an earlier announcement from the Ministry of
Health of Ethiopia, about 90,000 health workers and volunteers
will be participating in the campaign which will be carried out at
more than 30,000 vaccination posts.
</P>
<P>
The required 25,000,000 doses of oral polio vaccines, 530,600

<HEADLINE> MPC Cuts UK Interest Rate by 0.5 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of England's MPC
(Monetary Policy Committee) cut UK interest rates Thursday by 0.5
percent to 6.75 percent, more than commonly expected.
</P>
<P>
It is the biggest cut in interest rates for four years and
follows a 0.25 percent cut last month which was widely dismissed
as too little and too late.
</P>
<P>
The bank said it was taking the action over fears that the UK
economy was heading for a sharp slowdown next year.
</P>
<P>
There was a broad welcome for the move from industry and
unions. Kate Barker, the Confederation of British Industry's chief
economic adviser, said that as inflationary pressures eased, there
should be scope for further reductions in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
"Business will welcome this decision as the right response to
our warnings on the increasing risk of a UK recession," she said.
</P>
<P>
Trade Unions Congress General Secretary John Monks also
stressed that more cuts would be necessary if the economy was not
to slump back into recession with massive job losses.
</P>
<P>
"This move is welcome and shows that the bank has waken up to
the plight of British exporters," he said. "Similar cuts are still
likely to be necessary in the months ahead if we are to head off
the dangers of recession next year."
</P>
<P>
There was good news also for homeowners, with mortgage lenders
moving quickly to reduce their rates in line with the bank's
decision.
</P>
<P>
The Halifac, Nationwide and Addey National -- the three biggest
lenders -- have all announced a cut in their mortgage rates of
0.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Economists here believe that the cut in rates will also come as
a relief for UK Chancellor Gordon Brown.
</P>
<P>
Brown forecast Wednesday that the UK economic growth would slow
next year to 1-1.5 percent but said it would rebound in 2000 and
2001 to 2.25 percent and 2.75 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
Many analysts believe that Brown's optimistic forecasts of an
upturn in UK growth by the year 2000 will only be achieved by a
sharp fall in interest rates.
</P>
<P>
However, the 0.5 percent interest rate cut caught the City by
surprise as most of the analysts had predicted a cut of 0.25
percent.
</P>
<P>
The pound weakened against the dollar and the Deutsch mark
after the decision was announced, falling by two cents to 1.65
U.S. dollars and one pfenning to DM2.75.
</P>
<P>
The FTSE 100 index of leading shares initially pared back
earlier losses, but by 1300 GMT had dropped 118 points to 5,505.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Cabinet Forms Team to Study Redeployment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli cabinet decided
Thursday to form a ministerial team to study the map for further
troop redeployment in the West Bank, Prime Minister's Office said.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet made this decision during its meeting to ratify
the Wye peace agreement with the Palestinians after studying the
troop redeployment map prepared by Israel Defense Force.
</P>
<P>
The ministerial team will be headed by Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai to decide what territories of the West Bank could be
handed over to the Palestinians, the Office said.
</P>
<P>
The team also includes Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon who
strongly opposes the Wye agreement, the Office said.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Thursday presented the Wye
peace agreement to his cabinet for approval. The cabinet debate
on the agreement would last for one or two days before voting.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu had postponed the cabinet meeting twice in two days,
charging that the Palestinians failed to present a time table for
the arrests of 30 terror suspects accused of killing nearly 100
Israelis in the past.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, namely the Wye River Memorandum, was signed by
Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on October 23 in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
Under this accord, Israel has to withdraw from another 13
percent of the West Bank territories in 12 weeks with the
Palestinians taking steps against Islamic militants during each
phase of the pullback.
</P>
<P>
Yasser Arafat said Wednesday that 12 of the wanted men had been
already in Palestinian detention, thus paving the way for
Netanyahu to present the agreement for cabinet approval
Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Israel Urged to Carry out Deal With Palestinians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Egypt on Thursday called for a
watchout for Israel's delay in implementing the recent peace
accord signed with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
"We are awaiting the decision (on the West Bank accord) to be
made by the Israeli government," Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa said after the talks between Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in the Egyptian Red
Sea resort Sharm el Sheikh.
</P>
<P>
There is no alternative for Israel but to implement the peace
agreement, Moussa stressed.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians and Israel signed on October 23 in Washington
the interim peace agreement on Israeli withdrawal from another 13
percent of the West Bank and tough Palestinian measures against
anti-Israeli violence.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu postponed twice in
two days to convene his cabinet to ratify the accord on the ground
that the Palestinians failed to submit a timetable for the arrest
of 30 fugitives wanted by Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians said they had handed a work plan over to the
United States, which is responsible for briefing Israel on the
issue.
</P>
<P>
The Arabs will not take any steps in normalizing relations with
Israel unless it fulfills its long-delayed commitments to handing
over lands to the Palestinians, Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
Arab countries suspended the normalization process of ties with
Israel in 1996 following Netanyahu's coming to power and adopting a
hardline policy in the Middle East peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said that Mubarak expressed firm support for Arafat and
the Palestinian stand in face of Israel's procrastination policy.
</P>
<P>
The Arab countries are siding with the Palestinian people and
the Middle East peace process, provided that peace be balanced, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Arafat arrived in Cairo earlier in the day for meeting with
Mubarak . He left Egypt after the talks.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: U.S. Saves Face, But Eases No U.N. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 5 (Xinhua) -- A high-ranking U.N.
official Wednesday said that the United States Tuesday paid the
world body 197 million U.S. dollars in arrears, "just sufficient
to avoid" the loss of vote in the General Assembly next year.
</P>
<P>
Joseph Connor, under-secretary-general for management, told a
press conference here that "a payment of approximately 197 million
U.S. dollars has been paid by the United States Government to the
(U.N.) regular budget, bringing the total 1998 payment for the
regular budget, international tribunals and peacekeeping budgets
to 586 million U.S. dollars."
</P>
<P>
However, Washington's latest face-saving payment does not
necessarily mean a total ease of the U.N. financial crisis. The
United Nations, which has been long haunted by such a crisis,
found it fund-starved in promoting its long-awaited reform
campaign and safeguarding peace and development in the world.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations, plagued by some members' delayment and
unwillingness in paying contributions in full and on time, has to
cross-borrow cash from the peacekeeping budget in order to keep
the world body operational.
</P>
<P>
The amount still outstanding from the United States stands at
1,280 million U.S. dollars, thus making the U.S. No. 1 debtor
among 185 U.N members. The U.S. arrears account for some 64
percent of a total of about 2 billion U.S. dollars owed to the
United Nations by some members.
</P>
<P>
The contributions to the United Nations mainly go to finance
the regular budget, international tribunals and peacekeeping
operations.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations, a non-profit body, totally relies on the
contributions from its members to finance its various programs.
Any delayment or unwillingness in making compulsory payments and
honoring their legal obligations will surely plunge the world body
into a serious financial crisis, thus keeping it from better
upholding peace and security and promoting development in the
world.
</P>
<P>
Before the Tuesday payment, Washington had to pay 347 million
U.S. dollars before December 31, or it will automatically lose its
vote in the 185-member General Assembly beginning next year.
</P>
<P>
Under Article 19 of the U.N. Charter, "A member of the United
Nations which is in arrears in the payment of its financial
contributions to the Organization shall have no vote in the
General Assembly if its arrears equals or exceeds the amount of
the contributions due from it for the preceding two full years."
</P>
<P>
At present, there are eight countries who are risking the
exercise of Article 19 if they fail to pay their back dues enough
to save the vote, Connor said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Connor said that "a total of 107 Member States have
so far paid their regular budget assessments in full, a record
high." U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who has been outspoken
in demanding U.S. payment, voiced his thanks to those countries
and asked other debtors to follow their examples.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the crux of the U.S. arrears issue lies in some
Congress members, who, maybe not big in number, attached
additional strings to the payment.
</P>
<P>
In October, the U.S. Congress interwived the arrears issue with
additional abortion restrictions. The bill was later vetoed by
U.S. President Bill Clinton, who said the additional strings were
"unrelated."
</P>
<P>
By its unilateral move to cut down on the ratio of U.S.
contributions from 31 percent to 25 percent two years ago,
Congress has annexed 128 million U.S. dollars from its arrears.
Altogether, the dispute between the United Nations and the United
States over the arrears calculation constitutes to a difference of
416 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
"Great nations keep their word," Annan said in an October
speech in Washington. Continued delinquency by the United States,
Annan added, could only undermine the nation's prestige and its
credibility in times of crisis.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief's statement was echoed by most member nations,
including U.S. Western allies, who have been long lashing out at
the U.S. rejection to pay the back dues at the United Nations in
full, on time and without any conditions.
</P>
<P>
They cry out for a quick action by the United States, a main
contributor and also the largest debtor, to pay its outstanding as
well as current contributions.
</P>
<P>
It will be the most definite indication of genuine support for
the United Nations, which is engaged in an unprecedented reform
drive to make it the most efficient in better contributing to the
needs of the peoples in the world at large.
</P>
<P>
The voiced their strong belief that the United Nations must
undergo changes, and only changes which enjoy the universal
support of member states and serve collective needs can be
successful.

HARARE, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean Home Affairs
Minister Dumiso Dabengwa Thursday said over 50 people were
arrested during violent demonstrations Wednesday against the
increase in the fuel price.
</P>
<P>
Angry protesters in Harare, Chitungwiza and other towns
Wednesday stoned and burned vehicles, barricaded roads and
threatened motorists in protest against commuter fare hikes
caused by the recent rise in petrol and diesel prices, ranging
from 65 to almost 68 percent.
</P>
<P>
Dabengwa told reporters that the Public Order and Security
Bill, which required people to inform the police when they
intended to stage a demonstration, had been passed in parliament.
</P>
<P>
He deplored the spontaneous demonstrations which broke out
Wednesday and which were joined by a band of unemployed youths
who ended up looting goods from shops.
</P>
<P>
Angry mobs stopped people from going to work by ordering
commuter mini-buses and other public transport from ferrying
passengers who wanted to report for work.
</P>
<P>
President of the Zimbabwe National Chamber of Commerce,
Nhlanhla Masuku, said businesses lost millions of Dollars as some
employees did not turn up and some companies were forced to close
early.
</P>
<P>
"We were hoping that after previous experiences we would have
been better equipped to stop inciting such activities," he said.
</P>
<P>
Calm appeared to prevail Thursday. Businesses which closed
Wednesday were open Thursday while riot police and armed soldiers
maintained a heavy presence in most high density areas.

The UAE president and Cohen discussed the developments in the
crisis caused by the Iraqi decision Saturday to suspend
cooperation with the U.N. Special Committee (UNSCOM) for disarming
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Cohen arrived here Thursday afternoon from the Qatari capital
of Doha for a short visit to the UAE as part of a Gulf tour.
</P>
<P>
The tour was designed to lobby support from the six members of
the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) -- Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar,
Bahrain, Oman and the UAE, for using force against Iraq in case it
fails to resume cooperation with the UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
Over the last 24 hours, Cohen visited Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and
Qatar to review with their leaders the developments in the crisis
and brief them on the stance of the United States administration
on using force against Iraq if it persisted in halting cooperation
with the UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi leadership last Saturday decided to halt all forms of
cooperation with the UNSCOM until the U.N. Security Council
considers the lifting of U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq following
its invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions cannot be lifted until U.N. arms inspectors
verify that Iraq has eliminated all its weapons of mass
destruction.

<HEADLINE> Greece Still Opposes Releasing EU Funds to Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Greece said Thursday that it
would continue to oppose the releasing of European Union (EU)
funds to neighboring Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Greek Foreign Minister
Theodoros Pangalos said that there were those who believed that
this was unnecessary, but Greece would insist on its position for
as long as certain developments were not forthcoming which would
induce Greece to change its view.
</P>
<P>
Greece had never rejected EU funds for Turkey but had linked it
with specific behavior on the part of Turkey, both in bilateral
relations and efforts to resolve the Cyprus problem, he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister described as unacceptable, paradoxical and
unlawful the proposal by the European Commission to fund Turkey as
a "developing" country when Ankara was trying to become a EU
member.
</P>
<P>
Greece warned last month that it would refer the commission to
the European court of justice for its decision to approve a
package of economic aid to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1980s, Greece, which has bad relations with Turkey,
has been blocking about 405 million U.S. dollars of EU money
destined for Turkey, which Greece accuses of not meeting standards
regarding human rights, territorial claims and other issues.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian Vice-President
Omar Ali Juma has warned that the government will not hesitate to
repatriate any refugees found behaving contrary to the existing
regulations for their stay in the country.
</P>
<P>
Juma issued such warnings Wednesday in several public rallies
he addressed in the Ngara district in Tanzania's northwestern
region of Kagera in response to complaints made by local
residents that refugees are causing problems.
</P>
<P>
The commissioner of the district, Evans Balama, said that
crimes committed by refugees are creating fears among local
residents.
</P>
<P>
Balama added that unlawful refugees have caused deaths and
forced 300 residents in the district to escape their houses,
according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
The vice-president, however, urged local residents not to hate
all foreign refugees as most of them abide by laws and have come
to Tanzania to escape fightings in their motherland.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania is playing host to the refugees to fulfill its
humanitarian causes and international obligations, he added.
</P>
<P>
At present, Kagera District hosts more than 110,000 refugees
from Burundi.

CAIRO, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- Thirty-five foreign companies have shown interest in
reviving a decades-old project of constructing and operating an
electric commuter train system connecting Amman and northern town
of Zarqa, the semi-official Jordan Times reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The companies, most of which are European ones, two Japanese,
one Korean, one Chinese, one Canadian, one United States and two
Turkish, have submitted letters to the Ministry of Transport to
show their interest in reviving the project, according to the
paper.
</P>
<P>
The project attracted these companies because the government
recently changed its policy by deciding to finance the
construction by the government and then lease it to independent
operators.
</P>
<P>
Foreign firms had shied away from the project in the past
years because the government wanted the bidders to finance the
construction and did not think much about the returns of such an
investment.
</P>
<P>
RABAT -- Contracts on implementation of the Tunisian-Libyan
electric grid have been signed in Tunis by the Tunisian
Electricity and Gas Company and the Libyan Electricity Authority
together with the German Siemens Electricity Foundation and the
Indian Kamani Electricity Company.
</P>
<P>
According to Thursday's Tunisian daily "Al Sahafa," the project
covers the extension of about 600 kilometers of 225 kilovolt
intensity lines from Sidi Mansour in Tunisia to Abu Kamash in
Libya, as well as construction of a new plant and the expansion of
other plants in southern Tunisia.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper added that the Arab Fund for Economic and Social
Development will take part in financing the project. It will
provide a loan to be equally refunded by the Tunisian Electricity
and Gas Company and the Libyan Electricity Authority. The project
is due to be functioning during the first quarter of 2001.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan government will
soon establish a disaster preparedness committee to deal with
different categories of disasters in the country, a senior
Ugandan official said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
State Minister for Disaster Preparedness and Refugees Jane
Frances Kuka made the plan public in capital Kampala at a
Sectoral Committee meeting on disaster preparedness and
management.
</P>
<P>
Radio Uganda Thursday evening quoted the state minister as
saying that her ministry will soon convene a meeting for all
agencies engaged in disaster management and preparedness in the
east African country to know the level of their preparedness in
face of disasters.
</P>
<P>
She also stressed the importance of coordinated activities of
individual agencies so as to avoid duplication of work.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Uganda Seismic Safety Association (USSA)
announced that it will hold its monthly meeting next week at the
Physics Department of Makerere University.
</P>
<P>
Though its national economy is developing at a very high rate
among the poorest countries among the world, Uganda is still
quite weak against natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
The agricultural success depends heavily on the weather. Its
failure can result in farmers' starvation and a sharp drop in the
country's foreign exchange income.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture's share in the gross domestic product (GDP) of
Uganda is shrinking from 60 percent to the current 44 percent,
but it still remains the biggest component.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Ivan Orlov, who created a car
explosion near the Red Square in Moscow on Wednesday evening, has
been diagnosed as suffering from schizophrenia.
</P>
<P>
According to the press service of the Moscow Security
Department, late on Wednesday a doctor on duty at a psychiatrist
department of the Sklifosovsky emergency care hospital where the
65-year-old Orlov was brought for an examination diagnosed Orlov
as a schizophrenic.
</P>
<P>
The car explosion, which occurred at 19:05 Moscow time (1405
GMT) not far from Kremlin's Spasskiye Gate, injured three people
-- two Kremlin security guards and one serviceman of the
presidential regiment. They have been hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
The driver, Ivan Orlov, jumped out of the car when it was 20
meters from the place of explosion. He has been arrested.
</P>
<P>
"The Incident has both a political and social underlying cause"
Russian Interior Minister Sergei Stepashin was quoted as saying in
Strasbourg on Thursday, where he is attending a conference of
Interior ministers of member-states of the Council of Europe
devoted to the struggle against crime and corruption.
</P>
<P>
Stephshin said that first, Orlov is a representative of the
left-wing radical group of the population. Second, problems
related to poor living conditions of the man and a social aspect
of the case should be taken into account.
</P>
<P>
The minister quoted Orlov as saying that he had no intention to
explode anything, but when law enforcement agents started to
pursuit his car, his Moskvich-412 was pressed against a curbstone
which was brought about an explosion and spontaneous ignition.
</P>
<P>
There had been a powder charge with a detonating fuse found in
the car. After the blast Orlov tried to commit a suicide but was
prevented to do this, Stephshin said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that "After this incident we should think of
tightening security around the Kremlin and offices located in this
zone.

<TEXT>
<P>
TUNIS, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian Leader Yasser Arafat
has highlighted the necessity of unity and solidarity among Arab
countries, saying the 21st century will be the century of major
blocs on both political and economic arenas.
</P>
<P>
The remark came in his address to the international symposium
on the challenges of the 21st century, organized by the Tunisian
ruling Constitutional Democratic Rally on the 11th anniversary of
President Zine Al-Abidine Ben Ali's assumption of power on Nov 7,
1987.
</P>
<P>
Arafat stressed in his address, read by Palestinian
representative to the symposium Hakam Belawi on Thursday, the
necessity of working out "unity formulas" that are more effective
in enhancing economic cooperation and unifying political stances
among Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
The formulas should, according to Arafat, lead to the emergence
of a united Arab bloc that has all the potentials of success and
preserves the status and civilization of Arab nations.
</P>
<P>
They should also be conducive to the scientific and
technological progress, as well as the interaction and
communication, of the Arab nations.
</P>
<P>
The address asserted that the big gap between the North and the
South caused serious crises that endanger world peace and security.
</P>
<P>
Peace can never be established in the Middle East without the
rise of the Palestinian independent state with Jerusalem as its
capital in conformity with the United Nations resolutions, it said.
</P>
<P>
Arafat expressed hope that the United States and other major
powers would continue their efforts in helping implement the
recent Wye Plantation deal without further delay.
</P>
<P>
Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu signed the
peace agreement in Washington on October 23, under which Israel
will withdraw another 13 percent of the West Bank in exchange for
the Palestinians' tougher measures to crackdown on anti-Israeli
violence.

<P>
KAMPALA, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan Minister of Internal
Affairs Tom Butime said here Thursday afternoon that people
arrested on suspicion of involvement in terrorism were placed in
safe houses.
</P>
<P>
The minister made the announcement when accompanying President
Yoweri Museveni on his tour of the Kampala district, according to
a press release from the President's Office.
</P>
<P>
Butime attributed this measure to chronic shortage of space in
police stations.
</P>
<P>
The internal minister said this in response to some recent
reports which accused the police of holding suspects in unsafe
houses.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Internal Affairs is usually underfunded by the
Ministry of Finance. Therefore, it does not have the money to
build more and better wards for prisoners and detainees.
</P>
<P>
A recent report said that only 344 million Shillings (300,000
U.S. Dollars) were allocated out of the required 955 million
Shillings (800,000 Dollars) for feeding the suspects across the
country in the current financial year. This may mean
underfeeding most of the suspects.

LAGOS, November 5 (Xinhua) -- A non-governmental organization
on environment "Clean-up Nigeria" said Thursday that it will
mobilize more than 50,000 volunteers to clean up the country in
order to prepare for the World Soccer Championship next year.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held here, national coordinator of the
organization, Ene Baba-owoh, said that the clean-up activity will
be launched on December 9 with the volunteers coming from various
environment-related organizations in the country.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the clean-up activities are partly aimed at
forestalling a likely repeat of what happened in 1995 when the
world soccer body, FIFA, canceled a planned soccer event in the
country because of a breakout of an epidemic.
</P>
<P>
The organization's involvement in sporting events is in line
with the agreement signed by the U.N. Environment Program (UNEP)
and the International Olympic Committee in 1995 to promote
environmental protection in sports competition, the coordinator
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"The catalyst which spurred us into action has been as
eventful as the subject itself and our drive to ensure a better
sanitary environment will continue after the championship," he
added.

shares in a slide on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
London shares plummeted despite the Bank of England's decision
to cut interest rates by 0.5 percent to 6.75 percent.
</P>
<P>
The rate cut exceeded expectations but failed to inspire
dealers. There was also some profit taking after a strong rise in
shares over the past few weeks.
</P>
<P>
US shares also got off to a shaky start, depressing London
stocks further.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, Germany's Xetra Dax index closed down 97.81, or
more than 2 percent at 4780.43.
</P>
<P>
Unlike the Bank of England's 0.5 percent cut in interest rates,
the Bundesbank refused to yield to pressure from newly-appointed
economics minister Oskar Lafontaine when they met on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
It was a similar story in Paris where by late afternoon the
Cac-40 index was down 87.98 points or 1.7 percent, closing at
3596.18, its lowest point of the day.
</P>
<P>
"The market fell on profit-taking, following Wednesday's jump,
but France Telecom's shares' fall weighed heavily on the index,"
said a trader at Credit Lyonnais Securities brokerage house.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 5 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright said on Thursday that the situation in Kosovo
improved but remained "far from ideal."
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters before meeting Danish Foreign Minister
Helveg Petersen, Albright also praised Denmark for its efforts for
peace in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"Serb compliance with U.N. resolutions is not yet complete. And
we continue to face substantial obstacles in our work toward a
negotiated settlement which secures the Kosovo Albanians'
legitimate rights," said Albright.
</P>
<P>
"The Danish government was a strong supporter of NATO action to
compel Serb President (Slobodan) Milosevic to end his campaign of
terror there," she said.
</P>
<P>
Denmark agreed to send F-16s to take part if military action is
required and pledged to send 50 people to join the Kosovo
verification mission and has provided 5 million U.S. dollars in
humanitarian assistance this year.
</P>
<P>
The two are also expected to discuss progress toward peace in
the Middle East. Petersen has just returned from a trip to the
region, where he met both with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
and Chairman Yasser Arafat.

<HEADLINE> Cohen in Egypt for Talks on Iraq-U.N. Standoff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
met Thursday with U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen in the Red
Sea resort of Sharm el Sheikh on the latest developments in the
Iraq-U.N. standoff, the Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Cohen is currently on a multi-leg tour in the Middle East to
coordinate stances with U.S. allies in the region on Iraq's latest
decision to stop cooperation with the United Nations weapons
inspectors.
</P>
<P>
Iraq announced last Saturday that it was halting all dealings
with the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) in charge of eliminating
the country's weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's move followed a U.N. Security Council decision last
Friday to review Iraq's compliance with U.N. resolutions, but
without guarantee demanded by Iraq that the review must lead to
the lifting of the U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions, imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait,
can not be lifted until UNSCOM certifies that Iraq has eliminated
its weapons of mass destruction - long-range missiles, nuclear,
chemical and biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
Cohen, who arrived in Egypt earlier in the day, has left for
Turkey after the meeting with Mubarak. He has held talks on the
Iraq-U.N. standoff with leaders of Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar,
Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Jordan.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Calls for Peace in Congo (K) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council Thursday called for a peaceful solution to the conflict in
Congo (K), asking all parties to step up their efforts to reach
agreement on a ceasefire in the central African country.
</P>
<P>
In a statement read to the press here, Peter Burleigh,
president of the 15-member Security Council for the month of
November, said, "Council members reiterated their call for a
peaceful solution to the conflict in the Congo that respects the
sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Congo and other
states in the region."
</P>
<P>
By the Congo, Burleigh, charge d'affaires of the U.S. Mission
to the United States, was referring to the Democratic Republic of
the Congo, also known as Congo (K).
</P>
<P>
Council members "emphasize that no sustainable solution can be
achieved through military means," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement also extended a welcome to "regional efforts to
seek a peaceful solution to the conflict in the African country,
including the important steps taken in Lusaka, capital of Zambia,
to involve all parties in the mediation talks."
</P>
<P>
"They urged all parties to intensify efforts to resolve those
issues which have prevented agreement on a ceasefire so far," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the statement said, "Council members look forward to
continued dialogue with the (U.N.) Secretary-General on ways to
contribute to a peaceful solution to the conflict."
</P>
<P>
Council members "reiterated their concern regarding the need
for respect for human rights, humanitarian law, and access for
humanitarian agencies in the Democratic Republic of the Congo,"
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Conflicts broke out in eastern Congo (K) in August this year
after the Tutsi-led insurgency occurred to topple the government,
headed by Laurent Kabila.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the outbreak of the fighting, such countries as
Angola, Namibia and Zimbabwe sent their troops into Congo (K) to
help President Kabila remove the rebels, reportedly backed by
Uganda and Rwanda. The Congo (K) conflicts involved more than five
countries in the region, a really rare picture on the African
continent.
</P>
<P>
On October 26, 14 members of the Southern African Development
Community (SADC) convened a ministerial-level meeting in Lusaka,
with a hope to find feasible ways to end the conflict.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, in a
statement issued through his spokesman's office, said he attached
great importance to the meeting, and called on all parties to
achieve an immediate ceasefire and an immediate withdrawal of all
foreign troops from the central African country.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Gets First Salary Rise in 4 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 5 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela Thursday got his first salary increase in four
years since he took office in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The National Assembly approved a 25.5 percent rise for
Mandela, who in 1994 accepted a 20 percent reduction in his
remuneration package, South African Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
Mandlos
vic has received a total remuneration package of
552,000 Rand (98,570 U.S. Dollars) since 1994, will now receive
698,586 Rand (124,748 Dollars).
</P>
<P>
The package includes a car allowance of 139,717 Rand (24,949
Dollars) a year.
</P>
<P>
On retirement Mandela would also receive a taxable pension
benefit of 75 percent of his total annual remuneration, which
would increase annually in keeping with the pension increases
granted to retired public servants.
</P>
<P>
Mandela was paid 690,000 Rand a year when he took office in
1994. But he took the lead in a belt-tightening exercise by the
government and accepted a 20 percent reduction from December that
year, to 552,000 Rand a year.

<HEADLINE> Turkish, Bulgarian PMs Pledge Closer Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister Mesut
Yilmaz and his visiting Bulgarian counterpart Ivan Kostov called
for closer bilateral political, economic and cultural relations on
Thursday, the Anatolia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz and Kostov, who arrived in Ankara Wednesday on a
three-day visit to Turkey, opened an exhibition about the life of
Kamal Ataturk, the founder of the republic, in the country's
largest city of Istanbul.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony, Yilmaz said that improved
relations between Turkey and Bulgaria and their peoples can be
cemented by increased cultural ties.
</P>
<P>
He added that Kostov and his government are doing the most to
end the sufferings of Bulgaria's 800,000 ethnic Turks.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Yilmaz and Kostov held talks here mainly on the
issue of the ethnic Turks from Bulgaria who migrated to Turkey in
the past.
</P>
<P>
The two prime ministers agreed that those immigrants who had
retired before leaving Bulgaria will be able to receive their
pensions from the Ziraat Bank branches in Turkey instead of
travelling to Bulgaria as they did before.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the two sides discussed the issue of the social
rights of the immigrants, agreeing that the social rights which
the immigrants had gained in Bulgaria would be valid in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Following the talks, Yilmaz and Kostov signed a number of
agreements on cooperation in the fields of economy, trade and
culture.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting with Kostov in Ankara on Wednesday, Turkish
President Suleyman Demirel expressed Turkey's support for
Bulgaria's bid to join in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO), saying that "we are partners and we will be allies soon."
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Turkey and Bulgaria have been enjoying
productive bilateral relations. Ankara cites the state of
Turco-Bulgarian ties as an example of how a tense relationship
can be converted into one of cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The ties between the two Balkan countries soured in the late
1980s when the then Bulgarian government inaugurated an
assimilation campaign against the Turkish minority in the country.
</P>
<P>
In 1989, some 300,000 Turks living in Bulgaria were forced to
migrate to Turkey and most of them are now living in Bursa,
western Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Kostov will travel to Bursa on Friday to meet with immigrants
from Bulgaria.

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Royal Canadian Mounted Police
(RCMP) in the province of British Columbia have issued new
guidelines to make it harder for residents to obtain gun permits.
</P>
<P>
Designed to help curb domestic violence, the guidelines call
for background checks against the applicants tracing back two
years longer than required by law, the Globe and Mail reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, applicants are required to provide the names and
phone numbers of spouses, former spouses or any person they have
been emotionally involved with over the previous five years.
</P>
<P>
The tightened gun policy, now under review at RCMP headquarters
in Ottawa as a possible national model, was announced Thursday in
Vancouver in response to a RCMP report on domestic-violence rules.
</P>
<P>
The RCMP hired a former appeal court judge to do the report
after two high-profile shootings in Vernon, British Columbia, both
committed by estranged lovers.
</P>
<P>
By estimate, there are 7,000,000 guns owned by 3,000,000
Canadians across the country.

<HEADLINE> Suzhou Man Nicknamed Champion Blood Donor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Xiang Junfang, a resident of
Suzhou in east China's Jiangsu Province, today donated blood for
the 30th time in ten years bringing his total donations to 10,200
milliliters.
</P>
<P>
Xiang, 36, works at the Wixian County Blood Donation
Center. The prolific donor offered his first donation in 1990
during a public blood drive.
</P>
<P>
He usually gives 300-400 ml of blood three to four times a
year, and on certain occasions donates to local Red Cross blood
centers during business trips to other cities. Xiang's generous
donations have earned him the nickname "Champion Blood Donor."
</P>
<P>
Xiang formally earned a limited salary an a part-time employee
at the center, but nonetheless often donated money to
disaster-stricken areas, as well as to orphans and school dropouts.
</P>
<P>
The center hired him as a full-time employee in 1995 and since
promoted and organized blood donation drives.
</P>
<P>
The number of annual blood donors in Suzhou jumped from 400 in
1996 to 2,379 in 1997 due in a large part to Xiang's efforts. Some
2,300 people donated blood in the first six months of this year
alone.
</P>
<P>
"The supply of donated blood is slowly reaching the point of
fulfilling daily demand, with more than 100 people donating each
and every day," according to Shang Jingren, vice director of the
center.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Condemns Jerusalem Blast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Friday condemned a bomb attack in Jerusalem as a "cowardly act"
aimed at derailing the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
"My deepest sympathies go out to the victims and families of
this outrageous and cowardly act," Clinton said in a statement
read on his behalf by a National Security Council aide.
</P>
<P>
"The enemies of peace seek to derail the courageous steps taken
by the Israelis and the Palestinians at Wye River," said Clinton,
referring to a land-for-peace deal negotiated in the Wye
Plantation in Maryland and signed in Washington last month.
</P>
<P>
"I hope we can re-gain the momentum and both sides will
implement the Wye agreement as soon as possible," he added.
</P>
<P>
Two people were killed and 21 wounded when a suicide car went
off in a Jerusalem market on Friday. Israel's cabinet immediately
suspended the implementation of the Wye agreement.
</P>
<P>
A day earlier, the Clinton administration said it remained
optimistic that Israel's cabinet would approve a land-for-security
deal, paving the way for its timely implementation.
</P>
<P>
"We are optimistic that Prime Minister (Benjamin) Netanyahu is
going to get the approval of his cabinet, get the approval of his
government, and implement this agreement with no real delay in the
schedule set forth," said State Department spokesman James Rubin.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the "Crossfire" program of the Cable News Network
(CNN), Rubin called the wrangling about the accord in recent days
"a bump in the road."
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu had delayed a cabinet meeting to discuss the October
23 Wye accords signed in Washington, citing reasons that the
Palestinians failed to come up with a complete security plan.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli cabinet began a session on the Wye agreement on
Thursday under the mediation and pressure from the United States,
but put off for another day a vote on the U.S.-brokered peace
agreement.

<HEADLINE> French FM Raps Israel Delay of Wye Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 6 (Xinhua) -- French Foreign Minister Hubert
Vedrine lashed out at Israel Friday for its delay of implementing
the peace accord it signed with the Palestinians last week.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli cabinet announced an indefinite delay of its debate
on the accord after Palestinian militants launched a bomb attack
on West Jerusalem earlier Friday, killing two and injuring 21.
</P>
<P>
"They (Israel) should first begin to apply the agreements of
Wye Plantation ... if they really want to relaunch the peace
process," Vedrine was quoted as saying by Agence France-Presse.
</P>
<P>
He regretted that the Israeli leaders always use "tragic
events," such as bomb attacks, to "justify a dilatory attitude"
toward the implementation of peace agreements with Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
After the bombing in the West Jerusalem market, the Israeli
government set out two preconditions before it would approve the
Wry River accord.
</P>
<P>
It asks the Palestinian Authority to take firm steps to combat
against terrorist organizations and show evidence that the
Palestinians "respect all their commitments in the accord."

<P>
BEIJING, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Li Peng, chairman of China's
National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee, said today
that China hopes to increase cooperation with Europe in
wide-ranging areas, including in journalism.
</P>
<P>
Li made the remarks during a meeting with a delegation of EU
journalists led by Diego Carcedo, rotating chairman of the Spanish
Branch of the Association of European Journalists (AEJ).
</P>
<P>
The delegation is in the Chinese capital to attend a seminar

</P>
<P>
Li said that the world is marching towards multi-polarization

<HEADLINE> UNICEF Promotes Greeting Cards Sales in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 6 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Children's
Fund (UNICEF) today launched charity greeting card sales campaign
in China an part of an effort to raise funds for children in
developing nations.
</P>
<P>
In 1949, Jitka, a six-year-old Czechoslovakian girl, drew a
picture on a glass which she sent to UNICEF to express her
gratitude to UNICEF for the food and medical relief her small
village received following the devastation of World War
II. Jitka's drawing was selected as that year's Christmas card
design.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF has sold a fine collection of high quality cards and
other products worldwide for the past 50 years.
</P>
<P>
Almost 66 percent of UNICEF funds come in the form of grants
from various governments, with the remainder consisting of
donations from enterprises and individuals, according to Edwin
Judd, UNICEF Representative for China and Mongolia. He added that
purchasing UNICEF greeting cards is a major way of donating to the
fund.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF sold greeting cards valued at 150 million US dollars in
1997 and has allocated all profits to children's projects in
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
China was one of the first countries to receive UNICEF
assistance. UNICEF provided relief assistance of over one million
US dollars between 1947-1949 in the aftermath of World War
II. The program was resumed in 1979 and the organization has since
committed 300 million US dollars which has benefitted cities,
provinces and autonomous regions throughout China.
</P>
<P>
Most of the funds earned from sales of greeting cards in China
will be earmarked for providing aid to children in
poverty-stricken areas and handicapped children, as well as to
promote immunization and education programs for children,
according to Judd.
</P>
<P>
He urged people from all walks of life to help needy children
by purchasing UNICEF greeting cards during the approaching
Christmas and New Year's season.

<HEADLINE> China Faces Challenge of Population Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 6 (Xinhua) -- China faces great pressure from
population growth at the turn of the century and Chinese family
planning workers must exert every possible effort to control growth
and improve living standards.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Weiqing, minister in charge of the State Family Planning
Commission, made the comments today during an address to the
ongoing national conference on the grass-roots family planning
program.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that China's population will grow by 300 million
people over the next few decades before any hint of decline.
</P>
<P>
"The key problem centers on family planning in rural areas
which are home to over 80 percent of the nation's total
population," said Zhang.
</P>
<P>
He added that rural residents should be taught to strictly
abide by government policies and regulations on family
planning. He also noted that related rules should be formulated at
the village level to enhance rural awareness of marriage and
fertility concepts which are crucial to family planning.
</P>
<P>
Family planning departments should provide rural residents with
better contraceptive and birth control devices, and offer
extensive counselling of birthing and nurturing healthy children,
said Zhang.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that family planning services for the transient
population should be included in the social security system, and
all couples reaching the age of fertility should be provided with
appropriate reproductive healthcare.
</P>
<P>
Zhang pointed out that solutions must be found for various
problems inherent in the grass-roots family planning
network. Residents in various remote and underdeveloped areas have
access to minimal reproductive healthcare, and cases of forced
abortion and sterilization occur from time to time, especially in
rural areas, in spite of strict government prohibition.
</P>
<P>
He said comprehensive measures are needed to reduce early
marriages and births amongst the unemployed population and related
individuals should have access to improved family planning services.
</P>
<P>
China's population is expected to reach 1.3 billion people by
the end the century, and will peak at 1.6 billion by the middle of
the 21st Century.
</P>
<P>
In addition, China will witness a fourth baby boom between
2009-2014 when the population will grow by 20 million people
annually.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia's Opposition Party Members' Security Assured </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, November 6 (Xinhua) -- The Royal Government of
Cambodia Friday said that all political party members enjoy the
full right to travel in and out of the country at their own free
will and schedule.
</P>
<P>
"In other words, members of all legal political parties,
especially those who were elected on July 26, 1998 and sworn in on
September 24, 1998 in Siem Reap as members of the National
Assembly have complete security and safety assurance," a statement
of the Royal Government of Cambodia added.
</P>
<P>
It is a response to FUNCINPEC party's request on October 29 to
give further guarantee for its security and freedom of movement,
and make it the precondition to resume talks on a new government.
</P>
<P>
However, the statement pointed out that this freedom of
movement in and out of the country cannot apply to those who have
a prima facie case to answer to the court.
</P>
<P>
Prince Ranariddh, Sam Rainsy and other party members have left
the country for more than a month, claiming it is not safe for
them to return. Their absence have made the coalition talks more
harder.
</P>
<P>
The three major parties even deadlocked on the location of the
summit meeting which will be chaired by King Norodom Sihanouk. The
ruling Cambodian People's Party (CPP) proposed that the meeting be
held inside Cambodia, but the proposal was rejected by the two
opposition political party FUNCINPEC and the Sam Rainsy Party
(SRP).
</P>
<P>
The three parties have held one summit and three working group
meetings but failed to make much progress.

<HEADLINE> Ince Fined for V-sign Gesture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Liverpool midfielder Paul Ince
was fined 1,500 pounds by the Football Association Friday
following his dismissal during England's European Championship
qualifier in Sweden.
</P>
<P>
A FA disciplinary commission found Ince guilty of misconduct
after he made a V-sign gesture as he left the pitch in Stockholm
on September 5, but decided not to impose any suspension.
</P>
<P>
Ince is already serving a three-match ban imposed by Europe's
governing body, UEFA - one game for the red card and two more for
comments he made to Italian referee Pierluigi Collina.
</P>
<P>
A FA statement read: "At a hearing in Manchester, which the
player did not attend, the commission reached its verdict after
considering a letter from Paul Ince in which he apologized for
his action.
</P>
<P>
"Both the player and Liverpool FC pointed out he had already
been punished with a suspension by UEFA arising from the
dismissal."
</P>
<P>
The reason for the gesture remains unclear with Ince initially
claiming it was directed at England's assistant coach John
Gorman. But boss Glenn Hoddle later insisted that was not the
case.
</P>
<P>
Ince is facing further action after being sent off in
Liverpool's UEFA Cup game in Valencia earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
Officials will meet to discuss his case on November 12 and a
UEFA spokesman said: "The player's record is not very positive
and that could have an effect."
</P>
<P>
Ince claims his dismissal in Spain was harsh and has vowed not
to change his combative style of play.
</P>
<P>
"That's me, that's what I'm like. You know what you get and if
people don't like it, there's nothing I can do about it now," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Israel Admits Stealing Lebanon's Top Soil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Israel Friday admitted that its
citizens are transferring fertile top soil from south Lebanon to
the Jewish state, a United Nations official said.
</P>
<P>
Timur Goksel, spokesman of the U.N. Interim Forces in
Lebanon (UNIFIL), said in an interview with the Orient radio that
they were informed by Israeli army of the result of investigation
over the soil-transfer issue.
</P>
<P>
Goksel said the Israeli army told the UNIFIL that it is true
that some of Israeli citizens are transferring soil from south
Lebanon, but it claimed that the operation was conducted by
civilians for their civil purposes and was not a
government-organized act.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two weeks, Lebanon has been accusing Israel of
trucking its hundreds of tonnes of fertile soil in the eastern
sector of the Israeli-occupied south Lebanon into Israeli northern
area of Galiee.
</P>
<P>
It has sent letters to U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan, the
European Union, five permanent members of the U.N. Security
Council and the Arab League, calling for an international
intervention to stop the Israeli act.
</P>
<P>
Israeli security and judicial authorities have started
investigation into the case and Israeli army said it has taken
measures to prevent the re-occurrence of the incident, Goksel said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the UNIFIL has sent a judge to the site
where Lebanon's soil are being removed to collect more information.
</P>
<P>
Israel carved out a self-declared security zone in south
Lebanon in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north
from cross-border attacks by Lebanese guerrillas.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Leader Says Environmental Problems Hindering Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Li Peng, Chairman of the
Standing Committee of China's National People's Congress (NPC),
said here today that China has serious environmental problems, and
that damage to the environment has hindered coordinated economic
development.
</P>
<P>
All of society needs to develop a sense of environmental
protection, he told a forum on the environment sponsored by the
NPC's Environmental and Resources Protection Committee and
Agricultural and Rural Affairs Committee.
</P>
<P>
These problems, he said, have a historical base and relate to
climate changes, land reclamation, rapid population growth, and
farming.
</P>
<P>
Environmental protection should focus on major programs like
stopping logging of primitive forests along the Yangtze and Yellow
rivers and developing vegetation, he said, and asked the NPC to
improve laws on environmental protection and resource conservation
and to strengthen law enforcement nationwide.
</P>
<P>
Chinese environmental protection specialists suggest that there
be a division of tree planting for ecological purposes and for
commercial purpose and that trees planted for profit should be in
areas where there are no soil erosion problems.
</P>
<P>
Water-saving agriculture and ways to stop desertification
should also be developed. China has one of the worst soil erosion
problems in the world, with soil erosion on 38.2 percent of its
territory.
</P>
<P>
And, eight billion tons of industrial and domestic waste water
are discharged annually into coastal waters.
</P>
<P>
The two-day forum was attended by officials of central
government departments, 12 provinces and municipalities along the
Yellow River and Yangtze River valley, and environment
specialists.

MANILA, November 6 (Xinhua) -- The Moro National Liberation
Front (MNLF), a former rebel Philippine guerrilla group, called
for the review of a peace accord with the government to determine
if the time frame for the establishment of an expanded autonomous
region was violated, the Philippines News Agency said Friday.

<HEADLINE> China Possess Overseas Investment Capability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, November 6 (Xinhua) -- China has the basic capability
to invest overseas and the Chinese government encourages domestic
enterprises to expand their international markets, according to
Chinese officials.
</P>
<P>
The officials said this during the South African Development
Community (SADC) Investment Promotion Fair which closed here today.
</P>
<P>
China's rapid economic growth in the past two decades has
enabled Chinese enterprises to invest overseas, while the ongoing
financial crisis in Southeast Asia and the stability of the
Chinese currency (yuan) have offered opportunities to expand
abroad, according to an official with the Chinese Ministry of
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC).
</P>
<P>
Economists pointed out that overseas investments are a
prerequisite for the nation's further economic development. They
also noted the oversupply of commodities such as light industrial
products, household electric appliances and clothing.
</P>
<P>
Investing in foreign countries will enable Chinese enterprises
to gain access to international markets free of tariff barriers,
according to the experts.
</P>
<P>
The SADC which features the most dynamic regional economy in
Africa has sponsored three investment promotion fairs in China.
</P>
<P>
SADC members offer promising prospects for extensive
cooperation with China, said one SADC official, adding that their
abundant resources and inexpensive labor provide Chinese investors
with an excellent opportunity to earn profits.
</P>
<P>
The SADC consists of 14 members -- Angola, Mozambique,
Zimbabwe, South Africa, Namibia, Zambia, Lesotho, Swaziland,
Tanzania, Mauritius, Malawi, Botswana, the Democratic Republic of
Congo and the Seychelles.

<HEADLINE> EU Survey Says Business Sentiment Deteriorates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brussels, November 6 (Xinhua) -- An European Union (EU)'s
survey published today said business sentiment in 15-country EU
sphere deteriorated in October.
</P>
<P>
The industrial confidence indicator fell in all EU countries
and the decline was larger in the EU-15 than in the euro zone,
says the business and consumer surveys conducted by the European
Commission's Directorate General for economic and financial
affairs.
</P>
<P>
Capacity utilization fell slightly in October to 82.9 percent
in both the EU and the euro zone, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
And the leading indicator, the economic sentiment indicator,
fell back again in October, which can to the large extent be
attributed to the drop in industrial confidence and a further
weakening of stock markets in October, the survey pointed out.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the survey results show improvement of
consumer confidence among EU members in October. This was mostly
due to a more optimistic view on the expected general economic
situation, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
The rise in confidence was more pronounced in the euro zone
than for the EU as a whole, with Germany, Italy and Spain showing
improvements, according to the survey's first results.

BEIJING, November 6 (Xinhua) -- The Sino-Spanish Mixed
Committee of Commerce and Trade reached an agreement on dumping
and quarantines here today.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was co-chaired by Vice-minister of Foreign Trade
and Economic Cooperation Sun Guangxiang and Elen Pisonero, the
Secretary of Foreign Trade and Tourism of Spain's Ministry of
Economy and Finance.
</P>
<P>
Pisonero said Spain will further promote cooperation with China

</P>
<P>
Sun discussed China's foreign investment policy and affirmed
China's willingness to open the service trade and the
determination to protect intellectual property rights.
</P>
<P>
On the fact that the EU has applied anti-dumping measures
against China and restricted Chinese imports with quarantines, Sun
said the EU should deal with such cases on an equitable principle
and on an individual basis instead of applying them to all Chinese
businesses. Pisonero agreed with this.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed to help their enterprises increase mutual
understanding, cooperation, and use of their respective advantages
to explore markets in developing countries together.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Peace Process Must Be Advanced: Israeli President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Israeli President Ezer
Weizman Friday strongly condemned the car bombing incident in
Jerusalem, but urged both Israeli and Palestinian leaders to move
the Mideast peace process forward.
</P>
<P>
A car bomb exploded Friday morning in Jerusalem's Mahane Yehuda
market at the most crowded time when thousands of residents were
making weekend shopping, killing at least two and wounding 17
others.
</P>
<P>
Weizman said that "this bombing attack has to be condemned, but
we could not let it to derail the peace process and the process
has to be moved forward," Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will continue
to push this process forward," Weizman said.
</P>
<P>
Israeli government reacted strongly to the bombing, saying
unless the Palestinian side fulfils its commitment to fighting the
terrorist infrastructure, there will be no peace agreement between
the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli cabinet, which was meeting to discuss the
ratification of an agreement signed in Washington in October with
the Palestinians when the bombing took place, has announced to
postpone indefinitely the ratification.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Israel will withdraw from another 13
percent of the West Bank while the Palestinians strengthen
crackdown on Islamic militants.
</P>
<P>
The implementation of agreement, which should have gone into
effect on Monday, has seen several delays after Netanyahu said
that due to Israel's legal constraints, the accord became
effective only after it was approved by the cabinet and the
parliament.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side has to comply with the commitments
stipulated in the agreement, otherwise, it will be difficult for
the Israel to ratify and implement the Wye accord, sources of the
Israeli government said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat also called an
urgent meeting in the West Bank city of Ramallah to discuss the
impact of the incident to the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Arafat condemned the bombing as a "criminal act" against both
Israelis and Palestinians that aimed at sabotaging the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
He urged Netanyahu not to take drastic action that could
cause damage to the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, said a
statement issued by Arafat's office in Ramallah.

treacherous downhill section into the finish."
</P>
<P>
Team Polar Spirit of Finland was second, just 2:25 behind.
After two days of competition they hold a commanding 11-minute
lead over their nearest competition.
</P>
<P>
Team Mild Seven of China, the crowd favorites who stunned the
world by their second-place finish in the first stage, finished
fifth on Friday in 2:51:11.
</P>
<P>
Their fortunes suffered, however, when they forgot to carry
crucial items of climbing gear with them -- items required for
the 60m rappel midway through the course. Though officials loaned
Team Mild Seven so they might continue, a three-minute penalty
was levied for the miscue.
</P>
<P>
"I hate to do it because they're such a solid competitive
team," says Murphy Reinshreiber, MSOQ race director. "But rules
are rules, and they knew they needed that equipment with them.
Every other team had it."
</P>
<P>
In the overall standings, Team Polar Spirit came first in
8:01:51, followed by Team EAR in 8:12:14 and Team Mild Seven in
8:35:43.
</P>
<P>
The Mild Seven Outdoor Quest is a mutisport endurance
competition. Four person teams, each having at least one woman,
will race for four days in the rugged mountains of this quaint
hamlet. Events include mountain biking, lake paddling, trail
running, mountaineering offroad inline skating, and kayaking.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Former Minister Killed by Unidentified </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Zambian former finance minister
Ronald Penza was killed by unidentified gunmen in his residence
in the suburb of Lusaka at early hours of Friday.
</P>
<P>
Penza in his 50s was shot in the head and died instantly at
his residence after unknown gunmen forced their way into the
house, reported the Zambia News Agency.
</P>
<P>
But Penza's wife who was with him at the time was safe, said the
report.
</P>
<P>
A family member said that the bandits asked Penza for Dollars
after they entered his bedroom, and when he indicated where the
money was, one of them fataly shot him causing the family to
speculate on whether it was a genuine robbery or an assasination.
</P>
<P>
Five vehicles were parked at Penza's house, but nothing
tangible seem to have been taken away.
</P>
<P>
A neighbor of Penza said that five people all armed with AK 47
assault rifles forced their way into her residence this morning.
</P>
<P>
The five bandits beat up the family and asked them for gold
before stealing some household goods.
</P>
<P>
She said the bandits who beat her family up may be the same
ones who broke into Penza's house and later murdered him.
</P>
<P>
Penza had been finance minister from 1994 until his dismiss in
March of this year.
</P>
<P>
Penza is a staunch defender to the current government's
economic policies and developed a rapport with donors enabling
Zambia to obtain the much needed funds to finance the country's
economic reform program.

<HEADLINE> Death Sentence Rendered for Extortion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 6 (Xinhua) -- The Beijing First Intermediate
People's Court today sentenced Deng Chengshan, a former official
with the State Development Planning Commission (SDPC), to death
for extortion.
</P>
<P>
The court rendered a judgement of first instance against Deng,
former chief of the SDPC Food and Tobacco Division, calling for
capital punishment with a two-year reprieve. Deng was convicted of
extorting over one million yuan (about 125,000 US dollars) during
February and March of 1995.
</P>
<P>
The sentence also called for the confiscation of personal
property and all funds accumulated as a result of illegal
activities.
</P>
<P>
Deng, 40, extorted the funds from the Yuxi Hongta Tobacco Group
Co. Ltd. in Yunnan Province under the pretext that the SDPC was in
need of funds to renovate offices.
</P>
<P>
Deng learned of an internal SDPC probe into the affair and
returned the money to the group in May 1997. Now the money is held
in custody by the court.
</P>
<P>
He denied the extortion charge and argued that he had simply
borrowed the money to assist an entrepreneurial friend facing a
cash shortfall. However, the court presented the written testimony
from the group's leading officials, stating that Deng pressured the
company to finance the alleged SDPC renovation project.
</P>
<P>
The SDPC vehemently denied authorizing Deng to solicit funding,
saying that it did not ask Deng to do so nor it had any plan to
renovate offices.
</P>
<P>
Deng plans to appeal the conviction on the basis of the lack of
conclusive evidence proving extortion.

<HEADLINE> Angola to Play Leading Role in Economic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Angola with all its importance
in the central African economy, will serve as the "engine " for
the restoration of economic integration among the Economic
Community of Central African States (CEEAC).
</P>
<P>
This statement was made by Abdoulaye Niang, Head of the
central Africa Development Center of United Nations African
Economic Committee.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters here, the visiting Niang said that
Angola, though a member of Southern African Development Community
(SADC),could become a member of CEEAC. Many African countries
are members of different regional organizations at the same time,
he added.
</P>
<P>
Referring to economic integration in Africa, he said economic
integration can put the interests of different economies on a
mutual beneficial basis, and thus prevent war and conflicts which
have been rendering serious damage to African economy.
</P>
<P>
The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), which
has been trying to bring peace to Guinea Bissau, is taken as a
good example by Niang.
</P>
<P>
The first things to do for the restoration of CEEAC, Niang
said, are to set up an operational institute, functional
modalities and an independent financial mechanism.
</P>
<P>
Niang said that his current African tour is to consult with
different countries for the restoration of the organization.
</P>
<P>
CEEAC, formed in October 1983, went into standstill in 1994.
It came into the agenda of the CEEAC summit last February to
resume the organization, so that is can serve as a tool to
promote regional stability and development.
</P>
<P>
Burundi, Equatorial Guinea, Congo (K), the Republic of Congo,
Gabon, Cameroon, Rwanda, Sao Tome &AMP; Principe, Chad, Central
Africa and Angola are CEEAC members.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, November 6 (Xinhua) -- The Angolan Criminal Police
Bureau announced here Friday that Angola's former ambassador to
Geneva, Adriano Parreira has been arrested for being suspected of
embezzling public funds.
</P>
<P>
Parreira misappropriated a "big sum of money" during his
service as ambassador in Geneva, Valmiro da Cruz, Deputy Director
of the Criminal Police Bureau said.
</P>
<P>
Cruz did not reveal the specific number of the sum of money
Parreira is accused of having embezzled.
</P>
<P>
Parreira, now Chairman of Angola Independent Pary (PAI),
accuses the police action against him of having political
motivation, as his PAI and other small parties have been urging
the government to change the current one-house parliament system,
so as to create political consulation institutes for those
parties which have no seats in parliament.
</P>
<P>
But the police bureau said that Parreira's case is just a
common criminal case, which has nothing to do with politics.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Bombing Turns Busiest Street Into </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 6 (Xinhua) -- People are rushing from all
directions to Mahane Yehuda market, downtown Jerusalem, ambulances
are roaring, wreckage of a car is burning, black smoke is rising
high, rescuers are busy helping the injured and police are trying
to disperse crowds.
</P>
<P>
After a car bomb explosion at about 0940 a.m. (0740 GMT) at one
entrance of the market, which killed at least two and injured 17
others, the city of Jerusalem once again has been put under
horror. Still, it was almost by miracle that a much graver
tragedy did not occur.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said Israeli soldiers patrolling the areas had seen
smoke rising out of the red car and shot at it before it exploded
at one entrance to the market from the Yafo street.
</P>
<P>
Yitzhak Subar, 21, a religious student living nearby, said one
of his classmates rushing to the site seconds after hearing
explosions found several ambulances had been there already.
</P>
<P>
"It was a big miracle," said Subar, adding that a much heavy
casualty would have taken place if the soldiers had not prevented
the suicide car from entering the crowded market.
</P>
<P>
Friday is the busiest day in a week for the central Mahane
Yehuda market. People packed in the streets buying food and
vegetables before the Jewish weekend Shabath begins in the
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The charred body of a man with only underwears on lay on the
center of the adjacent Yafo Street and his upper part is a mess of
flesh and blood. The wrecked rear door of the red Fiat car, which
the suicide bomber drove, scattered more than 20 meters away from
the site of the explosion.
</P>
<P>
Heavy forces of police, soldiers sealed the site, setting up
barriers at several entrances leading to the site. A police
helicopter was hovering above.
</P>
<P>
Crowds of shoppers and residents watched unemotionally outside
the barriers, but some of them shouted for revenge. "The blood of
Jewish people is not cheap," they chanted.
</P>
<P>
In July last year, 16 people were killed and hundreds of others
injured when a twin suicide bombings hit the market.
</P>
<P>
"This is not the real peace. This is the wrong peace," said
Abrahim Mitzrahi, a middle-aged fruit seller, whose stand was at
one entrance meters away from the explosion site, referring to the
current Israeli-Palestinian negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Peace talks have to be continued, but measures should be
taken to prevent Palestinians from entering Israel, he
said. Israelis and the Palestinians must be completely separated
if violence is to be stopped, he added.
</P>
<P>
"This is very bad," said Mr. Atia, a real estate dealer. "It is
very bad to see people dying. It is bad not only for us, but bad
for all the world," he said.
</P>
<P>
Atia said this tragedy has proved that Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu had done the right thing during the Wye talks
by demanding tougher Palestinian measures to fight terrorism.
(Palestinian leader Yasser) Arafat has to cooperate," he said.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Public Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani, who toured
the scene after the explosion, described the incident as a
"serious terror." But he stressed that the peace process can not
be stopped by such kind of terrorist activities. "We must move
the peace process forward," he told a crowd of journalists.
</P>
<P>
Shops and vegetable stands of the market restart their usual
business after the explosion, but there were few customers. Several
cars parked scattered at a parking lot, which is always packed on
every Friday, just outside the market.
</P>
<P>
It may be easy for the shop-keepers to resume business, but it is
not that easy for the Israelis and Palestinians to rebuild trust
and confidance.

<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, November 6 (Xinhua) -- The CISCO All-Share Index
closed at 452.6 points Thursday, sustaining a weekly gain of 8
points or 1.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
A weekly market review issued by the Cyprus Investment and
Securities Corporation Limited (CISCO) Friday said that this
trading week from Monday to Thursday maintained an upward momentum
compared with the previous trading week despite the setback on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the market peaked the trading week at 458.6
points, with a turnover reaching 3.7 million Cyprus pounds (about
7.4 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the market fell 6 points due to part liquidations
by some investors who wanted to cash some of their recent gains.
</P>
<P>
The review said it is rather difficult to predict what the next
market move will be although Thursday's drop was more or less
within expectation since profit-taking intervals repeatedly
intercede rapidly ascending cycles.
</P>
<P>
The total turnover of this trading week was 12.6 million pounds
(about 25.2 million dollars), much higher that last week's 5.4
million pounds (about 10.8 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
The average daily turnover in this week also rose to 2.5
million pounds (5 million dollars) from 1.4 million pounds (2.8
million dollars) the week before.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian President Calls on All Parties to Ensure Success of Assembly Session </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President B.J.
Habibie Friday called on the country to help ensure the success of
the special session of the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR)
scheduled for November 10.
</P>
<P>
There is no reason for anyone not to ensure the success of the
special MPR session, the president said while receiving 50 ulemas
and Islamic leaders at the Merdeka Palace here.
</P>
<P>
The head of state said that the entire country should take part
in making the session not only a success but a peaceful and
productive one.
</P>
<P>
"By that we mean success with high quality that would usher the
country into the next century," he added.
</P>
<P>
After the special session, the president said, the country will
have to be ready for the general election in the next five months.
</P>
<P>
"Normally, it takes us two years to prepare for the election
with only three parties. This time, we have to prepare for five
months with at least 100 new parties," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, it does not mean that all of these parties
could take part in the election.
</P>
<P>
"There will be requirements (which the parties must meet before
they could join the election)," he added.
</P>
<P>
The special MPR session, from November 10 to 13, is expected to
adopt a timetable for the implementation of general elections and
a general session of MPR next year.
</P>
<P>
Various parties have been at odds over the need for the
session, with some demanding that it be canceled.
</P>
<P>
It has been reported that many groups plan to stage
demonstrations while the MPR's 1,000 legislators are in session to
deliberate rulings on next year's elections.
</P>
<P>
It was also reported that groups of supporters of the session
were preparing counter-demonstrations at the MPR building.
</P>
<P>
The Jakarta Post quoted observers as saying that opposition and
pro-government forces could clash and ignite bloody riots similar
to those which rocked the capital and other major cities in May.
</P>
<P>
The government has mobilized hundreds of thousands of army
troops, police and volunteers for the event.
</P>
<P>
Navy Chief of Staff Vice Admiral Widodo A.S. said six warships
will be deployed to boost security during the special session of
the MPR.
</P>
<P>
The Armed Forces (ABRI) Commander General Wiranto made it clear
that if there is any group intending to disturb the meeting they
would be acting against the constitution and the law, and for that
reason ABRI will take stern action against them.

<HEADLINE> China Makes New Breakthrough in Building Nuclear Reactor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Prestigious Qinghua University
in Beijing and the Shanghai Boiler Plant Co., Ltd. announced the
joint development of pressure covers for 10 mw high temperature
air-cooled nuclear reactors.
</P>
<P>
Local nuclear experts hailed the Chinese achievement as a new
technological breakthrough in nuclear reactor manufacturing. They
noted that China is only the fourth country in the world with the
technological capabilities to manufacture high temperature
air-cooled reactors.
</P>
<P>
Research related to pressure covers, a key component for
related reactors, has been cited as one the nation's most
important high technology projects during this century.
</P>
<P>
Nitrogen, the cooling agent for the reactor, increases heat
efficiency by between 171-216 percent, compared to levels for
other agents including water or heavy water. Consequently,
dramatically higher heat efficiency substantially increases the
use rate for fuel which in most cases is uranium, according to
experts.
</P>
<P>
The 167.4-ton pressure crust are 11.34 m in height with
inner diameter of 4.2 m and wall thicknesses ranging from
0.08-0.12 meters. Main components for reactor, including
controllers, are installed inside the covers.
</P>
<P>
The breakthrough provides a solid foundation which will enable
China to explore the market of larger nuclear reactors, according
to the experts.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai Boiler, which has manufactured nuclear reactor
equimpment for over 30 years, has produced the main components for
a 300,000 kw nuclear power plant and has conducted extensive

<HEADLINE> Peace Process Must Be Advanced: Israeli President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Israeli President Ezer
Weizman Friday strongly condemned the car bombing incident in
Jerusalem, but urged both Israeli and Palestinian leaders to move
the Mideast peace process forward.
</P>
<P>
A car bomb exploded Friday morning in Jerusalem's Mahane Yehuda
market at the most crowded time when thousands of residents were
making weekend shopping, killing at least two and wounding 17
others.
</P>
<P>
Weizman said that "this bombing attack has to be condemned, but
we could not let it to derail the peace process and the process
has to be moved forward," Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will continue
to push this process forward," Weizman said.
</P>
<P>
Israeli government reacted strongly to the bombing, saying
unless the Palestinian side fulfils its commitment to fighting the
terrorist infrastructure, there will be no peace agreement between
the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli cabinet, which was meeting to discuss the
ratification of an agreement signed in Washington in October with
the Palestinians when the bombing took place, has announced to
postpone indefinitely the ratification.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Israel will withdraw from another 13
percent of the West Bank while the Palestinians strengthen
crackdown on Islamic militants.
</P>
<P>
The implementation of agreement, which should have gone into
effect on Monday, has seen several delays after Netanyahu said
that due to Israel's legal constraints, the accord became
effective only after it was approved by the cabinet and the
parliament.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side has to comply with the commitments
stipulated in the agreement, otherwise, it will be difficult for
the Israel to ratify and implement the Wye accord, sources of the
Israeli government said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat also called an
urgent meeting in the West Bank city of Ramallah to discuss the
impact of the incident to the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Arafat condemned the bombing as a "criminal act" against both
Israelis and Palestinians that aimed at sabotaging the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
He urged Netanyahu not to take drastic action that could
cause damage to the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, said a
statement issued by Arafat's office in Ramallah.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 6 (Xinhua) -- English Premier League club
Chelsea chairman Ken Bates said on Friday English fans who abused
Dane Brian Laudrup during a match in Copenhagen on Thursday as
"scum."
</P>
<P>
Bates left his seat during Chelsea's European Cup Winners' Cup
match against FC Copenhagen to argue with Chelsea fans holding up
a banner making obscene comments about the Dane, who is leaving
Chelsea to join Copenhagen in next few days.
</P>
<P>
"They are not Chelsea fans, they are the scum of the earth,
"Bates said about the English supporters, who watched the Danish
player score the winning goal for Chelsea against the club he is
about to join.
</P>
<P>
Stewards moved in at the Parken stadium to remove the banner
after Bates' objections and minor scuffles broke out with Chelsea
fans.
</P>
<P>
Laudrup's goal put Chelsea, the defending champions, into the
quarter-finals of the cup with a 2-1 aggregate victory.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the match, Copenhagen managing director
Flemming Oestergaard confirmed that the midfielder would be
joining the defeated Danish club on December 1 and that the
contract would be signed on November 9.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Stopping Smuggling Of Automobiles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 6 (Xinhua) -- China's automobile production
was up 31.4 percentage points and sales 29.2 percentage points in
September over August as the country cracked down on smuggling.
</P>
<P>
A State Administration of Machinery Industry official says that
the anti-smuggling campaign in July helped improve the market
conditions.
</P>
<P>
According to sources from Beijing Jeep, a joint venture with
the U.S.'s Chrysler, there was a decrease in pressure from
smuggled cars, like Mitsubishis and Toyotas from Japan. In the
past few months, inquiries the company received about its products
increased by over 20 percent from the first half of the year.
</P>
<P>
In September, the top seven automobile manufacturers in China
saw a rebound in sales after losses for four consecutive months.
</P>
<P>
Over 100,000 automobiles were smuggled into the country in
1997, causing billions of yuan in losses. China took steps to stop
this smuggling to help reach its economic growth target this
year.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang Zemin urged all government departments to crack
down on smuggling and this was supported by the PLA. The Public
Security Ministry is involved in a four-month special action
against smuggling and theft of automotives, and from January to
September, Customs officers seized 3,754 smuggled automotives,
worth 414.86 million yuan.

BEIJING, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Ministry
Spokesman Zhu Bangzao today asked the Philippines to try to
understand the reason for China's renovation of fishing shelters
on Meiji Reef of the Nansha Islands on the South China Sea.
</P>
<P>
The shelters were built by local Chinese years ago and have
been seriously damaged by the nature and pose a danger to the
safety of Chinese fishermen, he said. So, Chinese authorities
started renovation recently on some of the facilities.
</P>
<P>
He called Philippine complaints "groundless", because they
ignored the basic fact.
</P>
<P>
He said that China has made great efforts to maintain peace and
stability in the region, and it has been acting in line with the
spirit of the joint statement reached at the China-ASEAN summit
and the understanding and consensus reached with the Philippines
on the South China Sea.
</P>
<P>
China values its friendly relations and good-neighborly
cooperation with the Philippines, he said, and will continue to

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 6 (Xinhua) -- British Sports Minister Tony
Banks denied on Friday that the government had given up hope of
England for the 2006 World Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
The Financial Times reported Friday that Prime Minister Tony
Blair had withdrawn his active support from England's bid of the
event.
</P>
<P>
It said this was an acknowledgment that Sepp Blatter,
president of soccer's world governing body FIFA, had thrown his
weight behind South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Banks labeled the report as "absurd" and "malicious journa
lism".
</P>
<P>
"No, it isn't true," Banks said on BBC television when asked
about the report in the newspaper. "It is absurd, it is
absolutely absurd."
</P>
<P>
England has a "very strong bid" for hosting the tournament,
Banks said. "We've got the strongest bid that is around.
</P>
<P>
"For anyone to actually suggest that the prime minister has
withdrawn his support is putting out a bit of malicious
journalism...Whoever is writing this stuff is trying to sabotage
England's 2006 bid."
</P>
<P>
"The prime minister was hugely encouraged by what Sepp Blatter
said," the Sports Minister said. A Downing Street spokesman also
criticized the newspaper report.

CEO of the U.S.'s Lucent Technologies, said here today that China
has become its second largest market and the one with the most
dynamic growth.
</P>
<P>
China's move to increase investment in the telecoms sector
benefits economic growth, he said, and is a guarantee of long-term
development in the 21st century, "the information era".
</P>
<P>
To improve its market position, his company today announced a
global design center costing 200 million yuan (24 million
U.S. dollar) in Qingdao in Shandong Province that will provide
technical support and software development for customers.
</P>
<P>
He said that tomorrow's telecom network should be able to
transmit rapidly across vast distances, and have the flexibility
to add services at any time while keeping costs down. China's
telecom networks have already taken this into consideration, he
said, and Chinese leaders have a view of the future with plans
that can be followed step by step.
</P>
<P>
They also know how to encourage the people to achieve those
goals, he added.
</P>

Lucent had 30 billion dollars in profits last year, and has
seven regional offices, six joint ventures and two solely-owneded
enterprises in China.

ISLAMABAD, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Minister of State
for Foreign Affairs Siddique Khan Kanju said here Friday there
were no differences between Pakistan and Iran.
</P>
<P>
"Let me be very clear about this. There are no differences
between Iran and Pakistan," Kanju said on his return from a trip
to the five Central Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
He has been sent by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to Uzbekistan,
Kirghizstan, Kazakistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan to discuss
the evolving situation in Afghanistan in a bid to bring
sustainable peace to this war-ravaged country.
</P>
<P>
What is distressing is that there was and there is tension
between the two brotherly countries -- Afghanistan and Iran on
their borders, which was a major concern, Kanju told a crowd of
reporters.
</P>
<P>
But with the visit of U.N. envoy Lakhdar Brahimi, the national
security concerns of the Iranian President were met and things
should be moving, Kanju said, adding that this is not an easy
task.
</P>
<P>
"As far as Iran and Pakistan are concerned, we do not have any
problem with each other at all," Kanju reiterated.
</P>
<P>
Iran has blamed both Pakistan and Afghanistan's Taliban militia
for the killing of nine Iranian diplomats in Mazar-e-Sharif,
northern Afghanistan, when the militia overran the rival
alliance's stronghold in early August.

<HEADLINE> Tung Chee Hua on New tasks for HK's Overseas Institutions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 6 (Xinhua) -- A chief Hong Kong official
has expressed the hope that those working in the overseas
institutions should closely follow the change of various outward
factors while promoting Hong Kong in the world.
</P>
<P>
These factors include the flow of foreign fund, the trend of
development for Japan's economy and the U.S. dollar as well as
Foreign banks' rearrangement of debts.
</P>
<P>
Wen Wei Po, a Chinese language newspaper, reported Friday that
Tung Chee Hua, chief executive of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region, met Thursday with the directors of the Hong
Kong offices stationed in Washington, San Francisco, New York,
Tokyo, Toronto, Sydney, Singapore, London, Geneva and Brussels who
came back to Hong Kong to report on their work.
</P>
<P>
Tung exchanged views with them on the latest development both
in Hong Kong and Asia as a whole.
</P>
<P>
These directors mentioned that the countries in which they are
working are very much concerned about the implementation of the
principles of "one country, two systems" and "Hong Kong people
governing Hong Kong" with a high-degree of autonomy and Hong
Kong's economic growth after its return to China.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted the directors as saying that a number of
countries including the United States, Britain, Japan and
Australia expressed their support and understanding of the
measures that the SAR government has taken to maintain a good
order of its free-market.
</P>
<P>
Analyzing the current economic situation of Hong Kong, Tung
said Hong Kong should continue to maintain its advantages as a
financial and tourist center.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it should adapt itself to the future's needs and
open up some new areas, especially in developing high-value-added
industries.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that Tung also referred to the relationship
between Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland under the principle of
"one country, two systems."
</P>
<P>
It quoted Tung as saying that Hong Kong should play a new part
in the modernization process of the Chinese mainland.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the SAR government should study various
problems appearing in cooperation between different sectors of
Hong Kong and the mainland, he said.

<P>
HANOI, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Lao-American joint technical
operation teams have found debris of aircraft, remains and
personal effects of pilots, listed as American missing in action
(MIA) in Laos during the war in Indochina, said a report of Lao
official news agency KPL reaching here Friday.
</P>
<P>
This was the first joint operation of the 1998-1999

<P>
The detection took place during 12 cases of survey in Lao
provinces of Savannakhet, Saravane and Sekong, and three
excavations in Savannakhet province between September 23 and
October 31 this year.
</P>
<P>
The findings will be sent to the United States of America for
further analysis.
</P>
<P>
KPL said that the joint operation was in implementation of the
humanitarian policy of the Lao government, according to the
1998-1999 bilateral cooperation plan, and in response to the
requests of the U.S. government and of the families of the
American MIAs.

<HEADLINE> India, Pakistan Fail to Make Headway on Siachen Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 6 (Xinhua) -- India and Pakistan Friday
failed to make any headway on the disputed Siachen issue after
three hours of talks between defense delegations headed by their
respective defense secretary.
</P>
<P>
An official joint statement issued here after the talks said
that the "two sides stated their respective positions on the
issue. It was agreed to continue discussions on the issue in the
next round of the dialogue process".
</P>
<P>
This is the second successive day when the two countries have
failed to make any progress on identified outstanding issues
between the two neighbors.
</P>
<P>
The two countries Thursday failed to make any breakthrough on
the dispute over the Tulbul navigation project (Pakistan calls it
Wullar Barrage) after four hours of talks between the two
countries' water resources and power delegations.
</P>
<P>
The joint statement further said that discussions were held in
a "frank and cordial" atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
With 3,000-square-kilometer area, the 80-kilometer-long,
5,486-meter-high Siachen glacier, Asia's largest one and situated
in north Kashmir, has been a hot spot of dispute between India and
Pakistan since 1984.
</P>
<P>
Since 1987, situation has deteriorated in the glacier area
where exchanges of fire between the two countries took place
frequently, resulting in casualties on both sides.
</P>
<P>
The Siachen issue has figured in all major talks between the
two countries since 1986. Specific talks on the issue were last
held in 1992, but no agreement has been reached on it.
</P>
<P>
When asked if any understanding had been reached in the talks
to stop heavy artillery exchanges in the glacier, Indian Defense
Secretary and head of the Indian delegation Gen. Khan said, "It is
a very complicated matter and complex situation. It will take time
to resolve it."
</P>
<P>
Pakistan side expressed the similar view over the issue.
</P>
<P>
in a signed article here Friday, one of India's major English
newspapers The Hindustan Times says, "The Siachen glacier boundary
dispute is one of the most futile and wasteful disputes - both in
human and material terms - between India and Pakistan. At an
elevation of over 5,000 meters above sea level, it is the highest
altitude military engagement in the world."

<HEADLINE> APEC Urged to Take Immediate Action to Avert Global </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 6 (Xinhua) -- The Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) economies have been urged to take immediate
action, individually and collectively, to avert the current
financial crisis now affecting Asia from escalating into a global
crisis.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was made by the APEC Business Advisory Council
(ABAC), in a report which was presented to Malaysian Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad here Friday, who will chair the informal
meeting of APEC leaders in Kuala Lumpur on November 17-18.
</P>
<P>
ABAC Chairman Tajudin Ramli said in a letter contained in the
report to Mahathir that economic leaders must act decisively to
contain the severe difficulties as this crisis would clearly test
the resolve of APEC to find solutions.
</P>
<P>
Tajudin said that the leaders had acknowledged the growing
concerns of volatility in financial flows in APEC and that the
importance of collective responsibility must be re-emphasized to
ensure APEC objectives and sense of community were not lost.
</P>
<P>
He said it was crucial to be innovative in thinking, frank in
assessing the realities and bold in prescribing alternative and
flexible solutions to tackle the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Tajudin said notwithstanding the financial contagion, ABAC
continued to believe that free trade in the region by the year
2010 for developed economies and 2020 for developing economies
should remain APEC's goal.
</P>
<P>
As the business advisory council of APEC, the council has a
mandate to provide timely and relevant recommendations towards the
achievement of APEC goals, taking into account the current crisis
which challenges the very foundation of society, business and free
enterprises in some APEC economies, he said.
</P>
<P>
The council has proposed several regional initiatives aimed at
providing rapid amelioration to the crisis, which include
establishing a mechanism to enhance the credit of government bonds
denominated in hard currencies and issued by affected economies
through guarantees, exchangeable government bonds and developing
mechanisms to cushion the impact of currency instability on the
private sector.
</P>
<P>
ABAC is also re-emphasizing that the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) broadens its approaches to take into account the social
implications of its programs and convene an ongoing regional forum
to promote and coordinate cooperative responses to the financial
crisis.
</P>
<P>
The council is strongly urging economic leaders to strengthen
their domestic economies by taking several initiatives such as
enhancing the domestic capital market infrastructure via the
restructuring of bank balance sheets through loan sales and
financing structures, encouraging foreign direct investment in
domestic financial institutions to strengthen the capital bases of
domestic banks and enhancing their global competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
ABAC is also calling on economic leaders to improve domestic
capital markets through the development of liquid bond and
asset-backed securities markets.
</P>
<P>
It also proposed the establishment of a mechanism for
restructuring corporate debt through debt-equity swaps and a
special exchange rate mechanism to assist qualified companies in
managing currency volatility.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Urges Diplomatic Solution to Iraq Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Crown Prince Hassan
said Thursday evening that the Iraqi-U.N. crisis over weapons
inspections should be settled through diplomatic means.
</P>
<P>
Hassan made the remarks in meeting with visiting U.S. Defense
Secretary William Cohen.
</P>
<P>
He said that a diplomatic solution can be found in the
framework of international legitimacy and will spare the region
new confrontations.
</P>
<P>
Such a solution can help prepare a necessary environment for
both sides to resume their cooperation while pressing for concrete
measures to end the sufferings of the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad suspended all its relations last Saturday with the
U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) on disarming Iraq after the
U.N. Security Council failed to meet its demands.
</P>
<P>
Iraq had asked that the council's comprehensive review on
Iraq's progress in destroying banned weapons should directly lead
to the removal of sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. sanctions that were imposed on Iraq after its invasion
of Kuwait in 1990 will not be lifted until UNSCOM certifies that
Iraq has got rid of all weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Cohen is on a Mideast tour to lobby support for possible
military actions against Iraq in view of its non-cooperation
attitude.
</P>
<P>
The tour that began Tuesday has taken him to Saudi Arabia,
Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Qatar, Oman and Egypt
and he will travel on to Turkey after his visit to Jordan.

<HEADLINE> Much Expected From Kuala Lumpur APEC Meetings: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, November 6 (Xinhua) -- APEC (Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation) Secretariat Executive Director Dato' Noor Adlan has
said the forthcoming APEC meetings scheduled in Kuala Lumpur,
Malaysia, later this month come at a critical time and there is
much to expect from the meetings.
</P>
<P>
The meetings include the senior officials meeting (SOM) on
November 12, the annual ministerial meeting from November 15 to 16
and the leaders' informal meeting from November 17 to 18.
</P>
<P>
In an interview earlier this week with correspondents from
Xinhua News Agency, China Radio International and the Economic
Daily of China, Adlan said, "APEC leaders through their clear and
specific actions would reflect their common resolve in maintaining
support and confidence of not only the relevance of APEC but that
APEC is seen to be relevant."
</P>
<P>
On the targets to be set for the Kuala Lumpur meetings, Adlan
said, "The immediate goal must necessarily be to return to the
road of recovery and to build on growth through greater cohesion,
coherence and strength in building cooperation among APEC
members."
</P>
<P>
Noting the past year has been "a long and difficult year",
Adlan said, "the redeeming part so far is that sentiments have
changed. Issues have surfaced and there is much better
understanding and appreciation of them."
</P>
<P>
"The Asian crisis is no longer a regional turmoil but a global
crisis. Economies are in it together. We sink or swim together,"
he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
Adlan expected major progress could be achieved at the Kuala
Lumpur meetings on economic and technical cooperation among
members, saying APEC has made much progress in the process of
trade and investment liberalization.
</P>
<P>
He said in the future APEC will push forward trade and
investment liberalization as well as economic and technical
cooperation on parallel settings.
</P>
<P>
On the agenda of the Kuala Lumpur meetings, Adlan said they
will review the on-going activities of APEC, consider the progress
report of initiatives flowing from the APEC meetings held in
Vancouver in November 1997 and any issues arising in this year or
being proposed or discussed for the forthcoming meetings.
</P>
<P>
Adlan said, "The financial and economic crisis is expected to
occupy, if not preoccupy, the attention of in particular the
economic leaders."
</P>
<P>
He reaffirmed that there will be no discussions about political
issues on the agenda, saying that issues relating to regional and
political stability will not be directly dealt with in any APEC
forum as APEC does not deal with political matters.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Kuala Lumpur meetings will be held as
previously scheduled and "the host economy, Malaysia, has made
every preparation to ensure the success of the APEC meetings."
</P>
<P>
He said that the three new members -- Peru, Russia and Vietnam
-- will officially join the current 18 members at these meetings.
</P>
<P>
But Russian President Boris Yeltsin will not attend the leaders
meeting for health reason and Russian Prime Minister E.M. Primakov
will take part instead, he added.
</P>
<P>
Adlan noted there will be a number of events which will take
place at the same time around the APEC meetings, including The
ABAC (APEC Business Advisory Council) meeting, the APEC
International Trade Exhibition as well as the Business Summit
Malaysia 1998 to be attended by some 1,500 top CEOs and corporate
leaders, who will discuss and share ideas towards the theme of "A
New APEC for the New Millennium."

<HEADLINE> Much Expected From Kuala Lumpur APEC Meetings: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Asked to comment on the allegation that APEC is losing its
momentum due in part to the economic slowdown in the region, Adlan
conceded that "in some quarters it was felt that APEC did not act
effectively enough and its very credibility came into question."
</P>
<P>
But he said it must be borne in mind that the economic leaders
themselves underlined in Vancouver that the International Monetary
Fund is to play the central role in tackling the crisis.
</P>
<P>
APEC is not an international forum for such a role as it does
not have the expertise nor the necessary resources, he added.
</P>
<P>
Adlan emphasized that APEC plays its part at the regional level
like providing the second line of financing to the affected
countries on an individual basis.
</P>
<P>
On what role APEC can play in the endeavor to tide over the
Asian financial and economic crisis, Adlan said there has been too
much expectation placed on APEC since the financial crisis broke
out in 1997 and more so since January 1998 when it deepened into a
multi-crisis and started turning from a regional to a global
crisis.
</P>
<P>
At the domestic level, he said, each economy would have to
undertake reform and restructuring of its economy, in particular
the financial system.
</P>
<P>
"Collectively," he said, "APEC is addressing issues like
capacity building, economic governance and strengthening the
financial system, social safety nets..." to ensure such a
situation does not recur in the future and to mitigate the social
impact of it.
</P>
<P>
Adlan said, "APEC has a clearly defined niche which is to
provide value-added (efforts) and not to duplicate the efforts of
other regional and international institutions."
</P>
<P>
"I cannot see APEC playing any other part than what the
founding fathers basically intended," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
"To do otherwise which may entail departing from the APEC
principles and values can lead to spell APEC's very doom," he
cautioned.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the APEC can still achieve its long-term goal of
free and open trade and investment no later than 2010 in the case
of industrialized economies and 2020 in the case of developing
economies, which was set at the APEC Bogor meeting, Adlan said,
"There may be some immediate glitches in the short term."
</P>
<P>
"Over the long haul, I believe member economies would generally
realize the Bogor goals," he said.
</P>
<P>
Adlan noted the prime instrument towards the Bogor goals is the
individual action plan (IAP) and members have not only been
implementing their obligations but improving on their IAPs.
</P>
<P>
He drew attention to the fact that in Vancouver APEC leaders
opened another route to trade liberalization in the Early
Voluntary Trade Liberalization for which effort has been made
during the year to reach a comprehensive and credible package.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on criticism that APEC leaders missed a great
opportunity in Vancouver to deal with the Asian economic problems
at source and quickly, Adlan said, "We do not have the benefit of
hindsight...many did not even anticipate the crisis and everyone
did not expect the crisis to spread so quickly and in the dramatic
manner that it did."
</P>
<P>
But he acknowledged that "with hindsight, in some circles,
there is a basis."
</P>
<P>
Adlan said, "It is a fact that the East Asian crisis was
initially not one of long-term development but of short-term
liquidity brought about by the over-reaction of markets and the
herd mentality."
</P>
<P>
Quoting Chief E. Anyaoku, secretary general of the
Commonwealth, Adlan said the failure to handle the crisis
effectively "has transformed it from being a passing market spasm
of little consequence into a serious crisis."

<HEADLINE> Much Expected From Kuala Lumpur APEC Meeting: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Answering a question on APEC diagnosis to the Asian economic
crisis, Adlan said since the APEC finance ministers Meeting held
at Kananaskis, Alberta, Canada, in May made an analysis of the
causes of the financial instability in Asia, "the view of the
contributory role of currency speculation and hedge funds has been
highlighted through actions taken by some member economies and
more so lately as manifested by the failure and bail-out of the
Connecticut-based firm, Long Term Credit Management (LTCM)."
</P>
<P>
He also noted that the setbacks occurred notwithstanding the
country's unchanged sound economic fundamentals including a budget
surplus, a high rate of domestic savings, a trained labor force, a
competitive manufacturing base and sustained rate of economic
growth over many years.
</P>
<P>
"The sharp decline in exchange rates, asset prices and output
do not reflect changes in economic fundamentals," Adman
underlined.
</P>
<P>
On the capital control taken by Malaysia, Adlan said Malaysia
has taken pro tem measures to insulate its economy from further
adverse external developments.
</P>
<P>
This action was taken against a set of situation peculiar to
the country and it is not to hold it up as a model or a counter
point, he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is still too early to pass a formal judgment on the
long-term success or otherwise of these measures which represent a
deviation from orthodox policies," he said.
</P>
<P>
"However, the early results have given cause for encouragement
to even some outside of Malaysia," he concluded.
</P>
<P>
On how APEC may address the financial crisis, Adlan said
efforts should be made to target at restoring stability and
promoting recovery in the affected economies, reinforcing the
global financial system so as to reduce the likelihood of future
recurrence, limiting capital excesses and volatility, and
mitigating the social impact by expanding safeguards and social
safety nets support.
</P>
<P>
Adlan spoke highly of China's efforts in helping overcome the
Asian financial crisis and its role in the APEC. Adlan pointed out
that "the other member economies of APEC are appreciative of the
effort of China in not depreciating the yuan (Renminbi)."
</P>
<P>
"This has helped not to exacerbate the crisis," he underlined.
</P>
<P>
Adlan said China "has not only lived up to its responsibility
of being a member of APEC but also played a proactive role as
manifested by its contributions to the discussions at APEC."
</P>
<P>
He said China has taken many initiatives, provided venue for
the APEC fora and the sectoral ministerial meeting and leading
APEC activities, and is currently providing a leading role for the
leading work on the Economic Outlook and the Human Resources
Development Working Group.
</P>
<P>
In 2001, China will be the APEC chair for that year, he said.

<HEADLINE> Interview: SAARC Trying to Promote People-to-People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, November 6 (Xinhua) -- The seven-nation South Asian
Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) has been trying to
promote people-to-people contact for strengthening cooperation
among the member countries.
</P>
<P>
At their very first summit in December 1985 and the successive
summits, leaders of the SAARC member countries -- Bangladesh,
Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka --
stressed that strengthening of regional cooperation in South Asia
required greater involvement of their peoples.
</P>
<P>
The SAARC was formed with a view to boosting cooperation in
economic and social development in South Asia, the poorest and
most populous region in the world.
</P>
<P>
"Several programs, schemes and activities are carried out by
SAARC to enhance people-to-people contact among the peoples of the
region," Suresh Pradhan, director at the Kathmandu-based SAARC
Secretariat, told Xinhua Friday in an interview.
</P>
<P>
Among them, SAARC Audio-Visual Exchange Program, SAARC Chairs,
Fellowships and Scholarships Scheme, SAARC Visa Exemption Scheme,
SAARC Youth Awards and South Asian Festivals are particularly
instrumental in promoting interaction and cooperation among the
peoples of SAARC countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
The SAARC Chairs, Fellowships and Scholarships Scheme, formally
launched in 1989, offers some 80 slots annually as agreed by the
member states.
</P>
<P>
"Since the scheme is not operating satisfactorily, the scheme
was reviewed by an expert group and its recommendations are under
consideration by the relevant SAARC bodies," he added.
</P>
<P>
The director noted that currently 21 categories of persons
including heads of national academic institutions, presidents of
national chambers of commerce and industry, heads of national
radio and TV organizations and heads of national sports
authorities and federations are benefiting from the SAARC Visa
Exemption Scheme operational since March 1, 1992.
</P>
<P>
"The expansion in the SAARC Visa Exemption Scheme is a
continuing process," he added.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that experts are scheduled to meet this month on
expanding the scheme.
</P>
<P>
"Besides, the activities carried out by SAARC Chamber of
Commerce and Industry (SCCI), SAARCLAW and other recognized SAARC
bodies have been instrumental to strengthening mutual
understanding and goodwill among the peoples of South Asia," he
said.
</P>
<P>
As directed by the SAARC leaders, the SCCI and the SAARCLAW, an
association for persons of the legal communities of the SAARC
countries, were recognized respectively in December 1992 and July
1994 as regional apex bodies to facilitate their participation in
promoting regional cooperation at the people-to-people level.
</P>
<P>
The SAARC has under its umbrella another category of
professional and non-governmental organizations involving
management development, architects, accountants, town planners and
cardiac experts which are working to help the SAARC process as
well, Director Pradhan said.
</P>
<P>
But some of the decisions made by the SAARC leaders regarding
people-to-people contact remain on paper.
</P>
<P>
At their second summit in November 1986, the leaders recognized
that nothing would be more conducive to the resurgence of South
Asian consciousness than the involvement of the youth of each
country with the development programs of the other.
</P>
<P>
They directed that an organized volunteers program should be
established in the SAARC region under which volunteers from one
country would be able to work in other countries in the fields of
agriculture and forest extension work.
</P>
<P>
Director Pradhan said that the idea is still under
consideration.
</P>
<P>
Tourism among the SAARC countries remains unsatisfactory due to
lack of concessional fares and direct links between the SAARC
capitals, although their leaders directed at their second summit
that concrete steps be taken to facilitate tourism in the region
for better people-to-people contact.
</P>
<P>
"Now we have only links from here to Bangladesh, Delhi and
Bhutan. All the capitals are not linked yet," the director said.

<HEADLINE> Namibian Politicians Arrested in Botswana </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Botswana police have
arrested two prominent Namibian politicians who allegedly entered
Botswana illegally within the past week, South African Press
Association (SAPA) reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The pair, Caprivi regional governor John Mabuku and a member
of Namibia's National Council (upper house of parliament),
Francis Sizimbo, were arrested in Maum in the northwest of
Botswana after an extensive manhunt, SAPA quoted The Namibian
newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
But the paper failed to say when the arrests were made.
</P>
<P>
The authorities in Botswana were tipped off that the two
opposition Democratic Turnhalle Alliance (DTA) members were in
possession of expired passports and were on their way to Maum.
</P>
<P>
It was not known what charges had been laid against them or
whether any weapons were found on them.
</P>
<P>
These two men were believed to be among a large number of
people who have fled the Caprivi since an armed secessionist plot
was unearthed.
</P>
<P>
The alleged mastermind of the plot, former DTA leader Mishake
Muyongo, together with a Caprivi tribe chief Boniface Mamili,
also fled to Botswana last week.
</P>
<P>
Some 129 Namibians have illegally crossed into Botswana in
three groups since last week.
</P>
<P>
They were allegedly found in possession of weapons of war,
including hand grenades, ammunition, AK47 assault rifles, bombs,
anti-personnel mines and mortars.
</P>
<P>
By Thursday, 103 people had appeared in court for unlawful
possession of weapons and illegally entering Botswana.

Berri October 30.
</P>
<P>
Berri accused Israel of stealing Lebanon's top rich soil for
the benefit of its farmers in its northern area of Galiee.
</P>
<P>
Goksel said the UNIFIL determined the accusation is true after
monitoring near the border and interviewing local residents.
</P>
<P>
"It seems to have started in late September. Up to Tuesday, it
was still continuing," he said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said "it is inconceivable that Israeli troops
don't know about it," since the area is within the
heavily-patrolled Israeli-occupied zone and movement across the
Israeli-Lebanese border is monitored thoroughly by the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
But Israeli government's coordinator in south Lebanon, Uri
Lubrani, has dismissed the charge as "nonsense."
</P>
<P>
Israel carved out a self-declared security zone in south
Lebanon in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north
from cross-border attacks by Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
The peacekeeping forces entered Lebanon following Israeli first
invasion of Lebanon in 1978 in order to help restore the Lebanese
government's authority over south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Asked what the UNIFIL will do next, Goksel said the command
has sent a report to the headquarters of U.N..
</P>
<P>
"It's become an international issue," he said.

<HEADLINE> Australian Wool Prices Set to Reach New Lows: Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Australian wool prices are set
to hit new lows after a seasonal price rally ends in a matter of
weeks, analysts said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Wool prices continued to strengthen this week, with the
Australian Wool Exchange (AWEX) eastern market indicator closing
five cents higher at 489 Australian cents (308 U.S. cents) per
kilogram clean.
</P>
<P>
Wool broker Wesfarmers Dalgety said the market had experienced
its second consecutive week of price gains at this week's sales,
in a welcome change from recent months.
</P>
<P>
"However, the current price rally is being considered by many
as a seasonal lift which has the potential to last a few more
weeks after which prices are expected to fall to new lows," said
Wool Weekly newsletter published Friday by Wesfarmers.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Council of Wool Exporters said a total of 97,262
bales were offered for sale this week, with 8.8 percent passed in.
</P>
<P>
"The market's performance this week, with one of the largest
offerings of the season to date, added strength to the view that
the market has at least stabilized - albeit at an unacceptably low
price basis, so far as growers are concerned," the council's wool
market review said.
</P>
<P>
The council said if China was able to maintain its market
share, the grounds would start to emerge for a recovery in raw
wool demand in 1999.
</P>
<P>
China buys about 25 percent of wool Australia exports each
year.
</P>
<P>
Sales continue next week in Sydney and Melbourne, with
approximately 74,000 bales rostered for sale.

items in leading French newspapers on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- Having ravaged Central American states, the hurricane Mitch
on Thursday went through Mexico and continued its murderous course
toward Florida and Cuba. The initial figure of casualties
caused by the hurricane in Central America stood at 10,000 dead,
14,000 missing and 2.8 million homeless.
</P>
<P>
-- Hurricane Mitch has destroyed tens of thousands of hectares
of rice and maize fields, which provide the staple for residents
in Honduras and Nicaragua. Moreover, 70 percent of the coffee
production in Honduras, 40 percent in Nicaragua and 25 percent in
Guatemala were destroyed by the hurricane.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The restructuring of the European aeronautic industry,
launched in December 1997 by France, Britain and Germany, seems to
be moving on a good track. French Defense Minister Alain Richard
declared on Thursday that all the conditions would be met for
reaching a balanced agreement on a merger of the French
aeronautics and airspace group Aerospatiale-Matra, the British
Aerospace, and their German counterpart DASA in the first half of
1999.
</P>
<P>
-- Despite the annoying scandal of Pierre Bunel who sent
military information to Yugoslavia during the Kosovo crisis,
France wishes to command a future NATO intervention force to be
based in Macedonia. The force, which will be manned mainly by
France, will be in charge of guaranteeing the security of some
2,000 unarmed observers of the Organization of Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) in Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Cabinet Postpones Ratification of Peace Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Israeli government announced
Friday that it is to postpone the debate on ratifying the peace
agreement with the Palestinians indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government has decided to indefinitely postpone
the ratification of the Wye Agreement nt and this decision was fully backed by
all cabinet ministers, the announcement added.
</P>
<P>
The announcement said that would put off a vote on ratification
of the Wye River accord until Palestinians cracked down on
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, after hearing the
news, also called an urgent cabinet meeting in the West Bank
city of Ramallah to discuss the impact of this incident to
the peace process, according a senior Palestinian official close
to Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Chairman Arafat strongly condemned those who committed such a
crime in Jerusalem and he has to hear the detailed report
about the incident before making public reactions and comments,
the official told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Israel's 18-member Cabinet suspended its meeting on the peace
agreement with the Palestinians, when hearing the news of the
blast. The ministers led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
were debating whether to ratify the peace accord reached after
nine days of difficult negotiations in Wye Plantation Near
Washington sponsored by the United states.
</P>
<P>
A car bomb exploded Friday morning in Jerusalem's crowded
Mahane Yehuda market, killing at least two and injuring 17, the
police said.
</P>
<P>
The Mahane Yehuda market is the main food and vegetable market
in the city and many Israeli police had been stationing there to
maintain security. Shortly after the bombing incident, the police
condoned off the market and ambulances rushed to the scene. Rescue
workers are now busy helping the victims.
</P>
<P>
Israeli police at the scene said they do not know right now the
cause of the blast but it is clear that this is a terrorist
attack.
</P>
<P>
No one has claimed responsibility for the bombing yet. However,
most of the similar attacks against Israelis had been carried out
by the Palestinian militant group the Islamic Resistance
Movement (Hamas) which is opposing the on-going peactremists of both sides have
staged
anti-agreement campaign, accusing their leaders of treason and
threatening to take actions against their respective government.
</P>
<P>
The latest terror attack has put the peace deal under severe
test. Local observers believe it may at least postpone the
execution of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
But Israeli Public Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani said
Friday that the peace process can not be stopped by terrorist
attacks.
</P>
<P>
Kahalani, who went to the scene of the morning bomb explosion
in downtown Jerusalem, said, "This was a serious terrorist attack
aimed at damaging the peace process but the peace process can
not be stopped by such kind of terrorist activities and we must
move the peace process forward."

</P>

Jerusalem police Chief Yair Yitzhaki told reporters at the
scene that the police investigation of the incident is going on
and it is hard to confirm whether the terrorist car bomber was
among the two killed in the explosions.
</P>
<P>
A car bomb exploded Friday morning in Jerusalem's crowded
Mahane Yehuda market, killing at least two and injuring 17, the
police said.
</P>
<P>
A red car loaded with explosives blasted at about 0940
a.m. (0740 gmt) at the entrance to Mahane Yehuda, an outdoor
market near Jerusalem's central bus station of the downtown, the
same site of a bombing attack in July last year.
</P>
<P>
The explosion rocked the area and black smoke covered the
street immediately as police tried to keep crowds away, fearing
there might be more explosions.
</P>
<P>
The car blew up at the entrance of the outdoor market, which
was packed with weekend shoppers. The car was on fire.
</P>
<P>
The market was full of people in the morning hours and the
blasts caused them off guard with many tried to run for safety,
witness said.
</P>
<P>
The Mahane Yehuda market is the main food and vegetable market
in the city and many Israeli police had been stationing there to

<P>
Last bomb explosion took place near a Jewish settlement in Gaza
October 29, killing three. An anonymous caller to Israeli Radio
claimed responsibility on behalf of the Hamas.
</P>
<P>
Israel's Cabinet suspended its meeting on the peace agreement
with the Palestinians, when hearing the news of the blast. The
ministers led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu were debating
whether to ratify the peace accord reached after nine days of

</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is reportedly to call a
cabinet meeting shortly to discuss the impact of the bombing.
</P>
<P>
Friday is the second day for the cabinet to debate on the peace
agreement with the Palestinians and it is not clear whether
Netanyahu will suspend the cabinet vote on the agreement.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat signed an interim peace agreement in
Washington on October 23. Extremists of both sides have staged
anti-agreement campaign, accusing their leaders of treason and

<HEADLINE> Explosion Rocks Jerusalem, Killing Two </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 6 (Xinhua) -- A car bomb exploded Friday
morning in Jerusalem's crowded Mahane Yehuda market, killing at
least two and injuring 17, the police said.
</P>
<P>
A red car loaded with explosives blasted at about 0940
a.m. (0740 gmt) at the entrance to Mahane Yehuda, an outdoor
market near Jerusalem's central bus station of the downtown, the
same site of a bombing attack in July last year.
</P>
<P>
The explosion rocked the area and black smoke covered the
street immediately as police tried to keep crowds away, fearing
there might be more explosions.
</P>
<P>
The car blew up at the entrance of the outdoor market, which
was packed with weekend shoppers. The car was on fire.
</P>
<P>
The market was full of people in the morning hours and the
blasts caused them off guard with many tried to run for safety,
witness said.
</P>
<P>
The Mahane Yehuda market is the main food and vegetable market
in the city and many Israeli police had been stationing there to
maintain security. Shortly after the bombing incident, the police
condoned off the market and ambulances rushed to the scene. Rescue
workers are now busy helping the victims.
</P>
<P>
Israeli police at the scene said they do not know right now the
cause of the blast but it is clear that this is a terrorist
attack.
</P>
<P>
No one has claimed responsibility for the bombing yet. However,
most of the similar attacks against Israelis had been carried out
by the Palestinian militant group the Islamic Resistance
Movement (Hamas) which is opposing the on-going peace process
between the Palestinians and the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
Last bomb explosion took place near a Jewish settlement in Gaza
October 29, killing three. An anonymous caller to Israeli Radio
claimed responsibility on behalf of the Hamas.
</P>
<P>
Israel's Cabinet suspended its meeting on the peace agreement
with the Palestinians, when hearing the news of the blast. The
ministers led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu were debating
whether to ratify the peace accord.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat signed an interim peace agreement in
Washington on October 23. Extremists of both sides have staged
anti-agreement campaign, accusing their leaders of treason and
threatening to take actions against their respective government.
</P>
<P>
The latest terror attack has put the peace deal under severe
test. It may at least postpone the execution of the agreement
reached after nine days of difficult negotiations sponsored by the
United states.

<HEADLINE> Fake Maize Seeds Seized in Lusaka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 6 (Xinhua) -- About 600 kilogram fake maize
seeds have been seized at Soweto market here in the Zambian
capital.
</P>
<P>
Zambia Daily Mail reported Friday that seed inspectors from
the Seed Control and Certification Institute (SCCI) confiscated
about 60 bags of the fake maize seeds (10 kilograms a bag) from
dealers at the market.
</P>
<P>
The maize and in some cases yellow maize, is colored with food
colorants and packed in Zamseed bags and sold at 25,000 Kwacha
(about 12.5 U.S. Dollars) a bag.
</P>
<P>
As this year's agricultural planting season gets underway,
many are reported to have been swindled in the same racket and
the farmers have since been warned to be careful when purchasing
seeds.
</P>
<P>
An inspector from SCCI advised farmers to buy seeds only from
registered seed stockists and should verify the lot number on the
bags.
</P>
<P>
Zambia Seed Company General Manager Winter Chibasa described
the syndicate as highly technical and said investigations are
being carried out to establish the master minder.
</P>
<P>
He said it is unfortunate that Zamseed bags are being used in
the syndicate.
</P>
<P>
"Come harvest time, farmers would rush to Zamseed to
complain," he said.
</P>
<P>
Last year a similar racket was uncovered, but this year's
appears to have grown bigger.

<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The Supervision Committee of the
Albanian Banks has approved a bill banning money laundering, the
Voice of the People newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>

International Monetary Fund (IMF), to curb increasingly rampant
money laundering in the country, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The bill requires all state and private banks, money
exchangers, stock exchanges, travel agents, funds and fixed
property assessment agents to check a customer's indentity and the
source of his capital, and make a property assessment, when a cash
transaction exceeds two million leke (14,285 U.S. dollars) or
15,000 U.S. dollars, or a money transfer exceeds 15 million leke
(107,142 U.S. dollars) or 100,000 U.S. dollars. The money will be
frozen if it is found questionable.
</P>
<P>
The above-mentioned agencies are also required to investigate
and assess the financial activities ofn los ulmer who makes two or
more transactions exceeding the legally permitted sum within a
month.
</P>
<P>
Assessment results will be kept for at least five years for use
by the police when probing suspected money laundering activities.
</P>
<P>
Under the new bill, offenders will be fined between one million
and two million leke, coupled with other criminal penalties.
</P>
<P>
The bill still awaits ratification by parliament and the

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Ready for APEC: Deputy PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam is ready for joining the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, Deputy Prime
Minister and Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam said in an interview
with the Saigon Times daily Friday.
</P>
<P>
Along with Russia and Peru, Vietnam will be formally accepted
as members of APEC in Kuala Lumpur in mid-November.
</P>
<P>
The deputy prime minister said Vietnam maintains a viewpoint of
confidence although the region was hard hit and some economies
were set back almost ten years.
</P>
<P>
The established economic achievements and human values in the
past decades will be a firm ground for development in the next
stages, Cam said.
</P>
<P>
APEC currently holds 80 percent of trade, two-thirds of
investment, and half of official development assistance (ODA) to
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Cam said joining APEC as a full member is a longer and more
extensive process than integrating into ASEAN (Association of
Southeast Asian Nations) and the ASEAN free trade area (AFTA).
</P>
<P>
"I think," the senior diplomat stressed, "the biggest challenge
will be the competition between domestic enterprises and companies
of APEC members, as it is with ASEAN and the coming WTO (World
Trade Organization) participation."
</P>
<P>
After joining APEC, the deputy prime minister said, Vietnam has
to raise the awareness among government agencies and local
enterprises, identify Vietnam's advantages as well as drawbacks.
</P>
<P>
"Better knowledge will make path for specific action programs,"
he added.

Investors were discouraged by a possible delay in major tax

Japanese government which said Friday that the state of the
economy remains "extremely severe," traders said.
</P>
<P>
Japanese government officials have hinted that talks on
deciding major cuts in income and house taxes would not take place
at an extraordinary Diet (parliament) session later this month due
to a heavy diplomatic schedule slated for Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi in the next several weeks.
</P>
<P>
Friday's decline was also exacerbated by curtailed buying among
foreign brokerages, traders said, noting that Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter, a major U.S. investment bank and brokerage which decided
earlier this week to increase its global index weighting in
Japanese stock, sold off large chunks of stock.

<P>
BEIJING, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Sources from the China
Agricultural Bank (CAB) said here today that the bank's
outstanding amount of loans to township enterprises has reached
249.7 billion yuan, accounting for 26.7 percent of the bank's
total outstanding loans.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few years, the CAB has given key support to
leading township enterprises with good profits and reputation in
an effort to promote the formation of large township enterprises
and enterprise groups.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that since 1995, the headquarters of the CAB
alone has selected 258 key enterprises for special support,
providing them with loans totalling 10.9 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the CAB has stepped up its credit support for
township enterprises engaged in light industry, textiles,
machinery, food and other traditional products, as well as new and
high-tech firms, helping them introduce new technologies and
equipment to improve their competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
Since 1994, the CAB has coordinated its activities with related
departments to extend loans of 4.5 billion yuan for building 500
rural small towns and rural industrial zones across the country,
thus providing a good development environment for township
enterprises.

<HEADLINE> Wanda Reverses Withdrawal Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Wanda, the company running the
most succussful Chinese professional soccer team, on Thursday
went back on its words that it would quit soccer and decided to
stay for at least another year.
</P>
<P>
Wanda shocked the Chinese soccer at the end of September by
announcing it would sell all its stocks of Dalian Wanda, who had
just secured its third consecutive national championship title,
because of the "dark side" in the domestic soccer.
</P>
<P>
Wang Jianlin, president of the club, said he was "very
disappointed with the Chinese professional soccer" after his team
crashed out at the FA Cup semi-finals over several controversial
judge decisions.
</P>
<P>
The drastic U-turn of mind was an outcome brought about by
intense efforts from the city government, who went to great
lengths to maintain the most famous advertisement for the
northeast seaside city, a close source said.
</P>
<P>
"The city government went all out to persuade us to stay," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Dalian Wanda has long been seen as the "name card" of the
city, which will celebrate its centennial anniversary next year
and another national champion trophy would be an excellent gift
for the celebration.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, two major figures in the defending champions also
followed suit and changed their minds. Xu Genbao, the team
coach, and Hao Haidong, top scorer in the league with 18 goals,
both reversed their earlier decisions in a move widely believed
to also be influenced by the local government.
</P>
<P>
Xu Genbao had intended to coach first division side Sichuan
Quanxing and Hao Haidong had been reported to join his other
national teammates Fan Zhiyi and Sun Jihai in the English first
division side Crystal Palace.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Scientists Crack Part of Malaria Gene Code </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, November 5 (Xinhua) -- A group of U.S. scientists
reported Thursday they had cracked part of the genetic code of the
parasite that causes malaria.
</P>
<P>
Malcolm Gardner of the Institute for Genomic Research in
Rockville, Maryland, and colleagues at the Naval Medical Research
Center and several universities sequenced chromosome 2 of the
parasite, known as plasmodium falciparum, and reported their
findings in the latest issue of the journal Science.
</P>
<P>
The researchers said they had identified more than 200 genes,
many of which are probably essential to parasite functions. A
better understanding of these genes and their protein products
will help develop new strategies to control malaria, they noted.
</P>
<P>
The researchers said plasmodium falciparum is one of four
parasites that cause malaria, and so far there is no vaccine
against the disease which infects 500 million people a year and
kills 3,000 children every day in the world.
</P>
<P>
"The sequence information promises to provide new leads to
fighting malaria, a disease that exacts a huge burden worldwide in
human and economic terms," said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the
National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases.

<P>
HARARE, November 6 (Xinhua) -- President Robert Mugabe
Thursday launched Zimbabwe's second phase of the land reform and
resettlement program at Bungwe farm in Midlands Province, the
Daily Herald reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Under the government plan, the government will compulsorily
acquire about five million hectares of land in the next five
years to resettle 70,000 landless families.
</P>

Mugabe reaffirmed that the government would only start
negotiations for the payment of compulsorily acquired farms after
people have already been resettled on the properties.
</P>
<P>
He said people had to be resettled before the start of the
rain season to enable planting to start.
</P>
<P>
White farmers were free to go to the courts if they were not
satisfied with the new stand taken by the government, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"They must remember that their forefathers never paid for that
land which was stolen from blacks," he said.
</P>
<P>
If western countries and donors fail to fund the
two-billion-U.S.-Dollar land resettlement program, then the
government would only pay for developments on the farm rather
than the land which was forcibly taken from blacks during decades
of colonialism, he warned.
</P>
<P>
"There must be no hesitation, because we want every district
to have a resettlement program in place by the end of November
when the rain season begins," said the president.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe also urged transparency in the allocation of land and
said chiefs should be involved to ensure the resettlement
exercise was devoid of corruption and nepotism.
</P>
<P>
He condemned the invasion of commercial farmland by some
land-hungry Zimbabweans and said the resettlement program needed
to be implemented in a systematic manner to ensure maximum
benefits to the nation.

<HEADLINE> Ukrainian Parliament Passes New Agricultural Tax Act </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The Supreme Soviet (parliament) of
Ukraine on Thursday passed an act on a single agricultural tax
replacing a variety of the existing taxes in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Interfax-Ukraine news agency reported that the new single
tax -- to be in force between January 1, 1999 and January 1, 2004
-- can be paid either by cash or in kind.
</P>
<P>
Under the act, rates of the new tax will vary according to
categories of the land, including cultivated land, forests and
mountainous areas.
</P>
<P>
The single tax applies to agricultural entities whose income
from sales of farm produce they grew and processed exceeded 50
percent of their total income in the last fiscal year, as well as
land lessees producing commercial farm produce.
</P>
<P>
The act provides that 30 percent of the agricultural tax
revenue go to local budgets, 68 percent to the state retirement
insurance fund and the remaining 2 percent to the social insurance
fund.

<HEADLINE> Companies' Licenses Revoked for Evading Tax in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 6 (Xinhua) -- The Forestry Headquarters in
Lusaka has pounced on two companies in Southern province and
revoked their licenses after finding them evading tax, Zambia
Daily Mail reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
This followed physical investigations at the two plants,
Fallsway Timber and Straydom Timber, by director of forestry and
some other officials after receiving a report from an honorary
forest ranger that he had impounded a truck which was to
illegally export timber valued at 10,000 U.S. Dollars to
Zimbabwe, according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
The truck is currently under police custody and Livingstone
District Forestry officer Fidelis Simataa was allegedly involved
in the syndicate to flout the country's forests act thereby
evading tax.
</P>
<P>
At a recent heads of department meeting, the participants
complained of rampant corruption among the departments concerned.
</P>
<P>
The truck and the timber had allegedly been cleared by customs
office and all was set for its departure.
</P>
<P>
Simataa claimed he is the one who charged Straydom for illegal
operations and Fallsway Timber for illegal importation, use of
old documents and cheating on the number of the logs.
</P>
<P>
A total of 228 jobs are at stake in the two companies and
further investigations will be made on the cases, the newspaper
said.

<HEADLINE> Macao Garrison Law Under Draft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHUHAI, November 6 (Xinhua) -- China is drafting a law on
stationing troops in the Macao Special Administrative Region
(SAR), Vice-Premier Qian Qichen said here today.
</P>
<P>
"The Central People's Government decision to deploy troops in
Macao after its return to the motherland embodies state
sovereignty and maintains stability," said Qian, who is also
director of the Preparatory Committee of the Macao SAR, at the
committee's fourth plenum, which opened in the south China city of
Zhuhai today.
</P>
<P>
Qian noted that the troops stationed in Macao will be
responsible only for defense, and that they will not interfere in
local affairs which are within the autonomous jurisdiction of the
Macao SAR.
</P>
<P>
The military expenditure for the deployment will be borne by
the Central People's Government.
</P>
<P>
The troops dispatched to Macao will abide by both the laws of
China and the laws of the Macao SAR.
</P>
<P>
The Central People's Government's decision to deploy troops in
Macao after its return has drawn an enthusiastic response from the
members of the Preparatory Committee of the Macao SAR, especially
those members from Macao.
</P>
<P>
Personages from all circles in Macao deem the decision as an
absolute correct one as well as an extremely important measure to
be taken, and so they all pledge their full support, Qian said.

<P>
SEOUL, November 6 (Xinhua) -- FIFA's inspection delegation
praised South Korea on Friday for its preparations for the 2002
World Cup.
</P>
<P>
Peter Velappan, general secretary of the Asian Football
Confederation (AFC) and the World Cup coordinator, told reporters
here that the FIFA delegation has seen a number of important
proofs that South Korea will be capable of hosting the event
despite the current economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
The FIFA delegation left for Japan after completing its Korean
visit.
</P>
<P>
The six-member delegation, which also included FIFA vice
president Antonio Mattarese of Italy and U.S. soccer federation
president Alan Rothenberg, examined plans for lodging facilities,
transportation and tourism facilities as well as stadiums.
</P>
<P>
South Korea also ruled out any possibilities of moving any
matches to its neighbour country DPR Korea, but it suggested they
want to build a joint team.
</P>
<P>
FIFA is also studying the possibility of changing the dates
for the event from the traditional rainy season in South Korea
and Japan.
</P>
<P>
FIFA has asked the two countries to submit data on the climate
for the May-August time period over the last 10 years, Velappan
said.

<HEADLINE> Support for New Zealand Labor Party Steady: Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, November 6 (Xinhua) -- The support rate for the
Labor Party, the major opposition party in New Zealand, was 47
percent, down only one percentage point from a month ago,
according to a latest National Business Review-Consultus poll.
</P>
<P>
While quoting the poll results, the New Zealand Press
Association said Friday that the Labor Party's proposal to raise
taxes for the wealthy appears to have had "little impact on its
support."
</P>
<P>
Last month, the Labor Party said it would consider increasing
the top rate of personal tax from 33 percent to 39 percent for
people earning over 60,000 New Zealand dollars (32,280 U.S.
dollars) a year, if it wins the next election.
</P>
<P>
According to the poll, the support rate for the National Party,
the ruling party in the country, was up to 34 percent from 31
percent last month. The previous poll was conducted soon after the
National Party announced the decision to lower the floor for
superannuation from 65 percent of the average wage to 60 percent,
offending a lot of pensioners and pushing them to the side of the
Labor Party.
</P>
<P>
The latest poll also shows the support for the Labor Party was
highest among 60-plus voters.
</P>
<P>
The increase of the support rate for the National Party may be
attributed to its recent announcement of a series of measures on
reducing rents for housing and stimulating the country's economic
activity.

<HEADLINE> Couple-Only Families Fastest Growing in New Zealand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Couple-only families are the
 fastest growing family type in New Zealand, increasing by 15
percent between the 1991 and 1996 censuses, the Statistics New
Zealand said Friday in a media release.
</P>
<P>
The growth in couple-only families is the result of a number of
 factors including delayed childbearing and aging of the
population, the release added.
</P>
<P>
Two-parent families, however, continue to be the most common
family type in the country, although they declined as a proportion
of all families from 48 percent in 1991 to 45 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
At the time of the 1996 census, 18 percent of all families were
 one-parent families. A quarter of families with pre-school
children were one-parent families.
</P>
<P>
The total number of households rose by 17 percent between 1986
and 1996. Much of this increase was due to a 26 percent rise in
the number of one-person households. The rise in one-person
households largely reflects the aging of the population. Nearly
half of those people living alone were aged 65 or over.
</P>
<P>
The trend towards smaller families and more people living alone
led to a fall in the average household size from 3.5 people in
1966 to 2.8 people in 1996. In 1996 there was an average of 2.0
children per family, compared with 2.5 in 1966, according to the
Statistics New Zealand.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Michael Jordan's brother
believes the world best basketballer will not retire this season
from NBA.
</P>
<P>
Larry Jordan said the lockout is more appealing to his brother
than the regular 82-game grind, plus playoffs.
</P>
<P>
"Two months ago I would have said that there was no way he was
coming back," Larry Jordan said today. "But over the last two
weeks, and since the season will be shortened by about 20 games,
I think that would give him the perfect opportunity to get it out
of his system.
</P>
<P>
"I think he's learning toward coming back."
</P>
<P>
But if the lockout wipes out the entire season, Jordan would
probably never play professional basketball again, his brother
said.

help recover American players' confidence after the U.S. team
went 0-3 in the 1998 World Cup in France.
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be about getting experience for younger
players," defender Eddie Pope said. "There might be a period
where we lose a lot of games. Hopefully, people will be patient
with us."
</P>
<P>
Arena replaced Steve Sampson, who resigned in June after the
U.S. team finished the last among the 36 teams in World Cup.
Arena led Virginia to five NCAA titles and took D.C. United to
championships in 1996 and 1997 in the first two seasons of the
U.S. soccer league. The team wound up second this season.
</P>
<P>
"It's obviously going to be a tough period because there's so
many new players. You need to look at some new players for the
future," midfielder Cobi Jones said.

According to the agreement, King will pay 2,500 U.S. dollars

BEIJING, November 6 (Xinhua)-- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
and visiting second deputy prime minister of Spain, Rodrigo Rato,
expressed satisfaction with bilateral relations during their
meeting here this morning.
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Deputy Prime Minister is the fourth leader from a
European Union country to visit within the past 10 days, and this
well demonstrates that European countries place great value on
their relationships with China," said Jiang, adding that the
Sino-European relationship has enjoyed a good development and
China is satisfied with that.
</P>
<P>
"The friendly and cooperative relationship between China and
Spain has also developed rapidly and well," Jiang said. "The two
countries have conducted fruitful cooperation in many
fields. Leaders of the two countries have frequent contacts and
speak a common language on a number of international issues."
</P>
<P>
Jiang said China welcomes the actions taken by the Spanish
government to expand bilateral trade, and that he hopes the two
sides will further their ties and promote understanding.
</P>
<P>
"China is willing to make joint efforts with Spain to establish
an all-round friendly and cooperative relationship with long-term
stability, oriented toward the 21st century," Jiang stressed.
</P>
<P>
Rato, who is also the Minister of Economy and Finance, agreed
with Jiang, saying that the 25 years since Spain and China
established diplomatic relations have been a time of friendly
cooperation and achievements, and the two countries have common views
on many issues.
</P>
<P>
Rato said the Spanish government attaches great
importance to China's reforms and opening-up policy,
and appreciates China's achievements and the great contributions it
has made to a stablized world economy.
</P>
<P>
There is still great potential for the further development of
Sino-Spanish ties, Rato said. The Spanish government hopes to
further strengthen its relationship with China, especially in the
economic and trade sectors.
</P>
<P>
Jiang welcomed the attitude of the Spanish government, and also

<HEADLINE> IBM to Build World's Largest Academic Supercomputer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The International Business
Machines Corp. (IBM) will supply the world's first supercomputer
capable of handing more than one trillion calculations per second
in the latter half of next year, according to reports from the
company.
</P>
<P>
The supercomputer, to be installed at the San Diego
Supercomputer Center, will help researchers tackle massive
computer calculations that are currently impossible.
</P>
<P>
The machine will be used by the National Partnership for
Advanced Computational Infrastructure, a leading U.S. academic
computer consortium which links together 46 prominent universities
and research institutions.
</P>
<P>
The supercomputer will initially be built to handle a quarter-
teraflop of data, or 250 billion calculations a second, before it
is eventually upgraded to a full teraflop capacity, or one
trillion calculations per second, the company said.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the San Diego Supercomputer Center said despite
there are supercomputers under construction at several
U.S. government research labs with the capacity to handle up to
four trillion calculations, the new San Diego system will
represent the world's largest supercomputer available for general
academic research.

<HEADLINE> People of Shanghai Spending More on Housing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, November 6 (Xinhua) -- The people of Shanghai spent
more than 400 million yuan on housing and furnishings in the first
nine months of this year, according to local statistics.
</P>
<P>
The 4.3 million households of urban Shanghai spent an average
of 99 yuan buying or building houses in the first three quarters,
150 percent more than for the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The rapid growth in spending on housing is a result of China's
commercializing the housing distribution system and the municipal
government's encouraging private home ownership, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai residents generally spend 40,000-50,000 yuan to fit on
decorations for their new house and they often buy new consumer
goods like washing machines, color TVs, and computers when they
move into the new house.

<HEADLINE> China Ready for Conditional Dialogue with Dalai Lama </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 5 (Xinhua) -- China's central government
is ready to hold dialogue with the Dalai Lama provided he commits
himself to not advocating independence for Tibet and not being
engaged in activities aimed at splitting China, a senior Chinese
diplomat said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Yu Shuning, spokesman for the Chinese Embassy, told a press
conference that the dialogue could start as soon as the Dalai Lama
accepts the requests by the Chinese central government.
</P>
<P>
"It depends on how the Dalai Lama will act. The ball is now in
his court," Counselor Yu said.
</P>
<P>
China has urged the Dalai Lama to explicitly renounce
independence for Tibet and make clear that Tibet and Taiwan are
part of China.
</P>
<P>
The Dalai Lama, who fled Tibet in 1959 after failed military
operations against the central government, is now in the United
States meeting his supporters. It was reported that he would make
a statement soon on Tibet.
</P>
<P>
Counselor Yu said the Dalai Lama had failed to inform the
central government of the statement through the "existing
channel," showing that he was not serious about the dialogue.
</P>
<P>
"The channel is there and he (the Dalai Lama) did not use it.
Instead, he makes stories through the media with the aim of
putting more pressures on the central government. How could we
believe he is serious about the dialogue?" Yu said.
</P>
<P>
It was also reported that the Dalai Lama was seeking meetings
with U.S. Vice President Al Gore and even President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Counselor Yu said that China is strongly opposed to any meeting
between foreign government officials and the Dalai Lama.
</P>
<P>
It is China's domestic matter to conduct dialogue between the
central government and the Dalai Lama, and the sort of activities
aimed at splitting China should not be encouraged, Yu stressed.
</P>
<P>
Asked why the Dalai Lama should also recognize Taiwan as part
of China, the Chinese diplomat said that it is because he visited
Taiwan last year, a move detrimental to China's reunification and
territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. recognizes Tibet as part of China and urges China's
central government and the Dalai Lama to open dialogue to sort out
their problems. It is unclear if the Dalai Lama would find his
way to the White House this time in view of China's opposition.
</P>
<P>
Counselor Yu rejected charges by the U.S. Congress of China's
alleged human right violations in Tibet, saying that the basic
rights of the Tibetans are protected by the constitution and law,
and that they are much better off in terms of education, health
care and life quality.
</P>
<P>
More than 60 economic development projects financed by the
central government have recently come into operation in Tibet,
where 86 percent of the local government officials are Tibetans,
Yu said.

<HEADLINE> Canada to Offer More Aid to Hurricane Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Canada will provide additional
humanitarian aid to victims of hurricane Mitch in Central America,
a top government official announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
It will offer an additional aid package totaling eight million
Canadian dollars (5.2 million U.S. dollars) to be distributed
through international groups, Canadian non-government
organizations (NGOs) and local partners.
</P>
<P>
"We are working side-by-side with the international community,
including NGOs, and will continue to work with them to coordinate
our efforts and ensure our aid is being channeled effectively,"
said Diane Marleau, Canada's minister for international
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The aid will be used for food, blankets, medicines, shelters,
clean water and materials for repair to houses of victims affected
by the hurricane.
</P>
<P>
It will also go toward funding small local infrastructure
repairs, such as bridges, health clinics and water systems, as
well as helping NGOs send volunteers to the disaster areas,
according to a news release from the government.
</P>
<P>
Canada has already provided 1.15 million dollars for supplying
basic necessities to Mitch victims in Central America.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
met here today with Judith Rodin, president of the University of
Pennsylvania in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said the Chinese government places great importance on
the development of education and is attempting to revitalize the
nation through science, education and sustained development.
</P>
<P>
He added that governments at all levels will continue to expand
investment in education, develop education according to law, and
improve the educational level of all the people.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also recalled his visit to the University of Pennsylvania
when he was in the U.S. last fall, saying that the warm
hospitality he received from the university faculty made a deep
impression on him.
</P>
<P>
The University of Pennsylvania, a distinguished institute of
higher learning, is the cradle of many famous statesmen,
scientists and enterpreneurs, Jiang said, and has maintained close
links with China's educational bodies.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president expressed the conviction that Rodin's
current visit to China will push forward Sino-U.S. cooperation in
education and other areas. Jiang also invited Rodin to put forward
proposals for China's educational development and reform.
</P>
<P>
Rodin said that China's development in education and other
areas has left her with a deep impression. She added that her
university places great importance on academic exchanges with
institutes of higher learning in China, and that she will continue
to work for this.
</P>
<P>
Rodin is here at the invitation of China's Ministry of
Education and Beijing University.

<HEADLINE> Germany Backs Poland's Bid to Join EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The new German government is
supporting Poland "without limitation" in its bid to join the
European Union (EU), German Federal Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder
said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
However, Schroeder explained, after meeting with Polish
counterpart Jerzy Buzek, his government's "support" did not mean
announcing a date for Poland's entry to the EU.
</P>
<P>
Instead, Germany would help Poland enter negotiations over its
EU membership sooner and in a proper way, he said.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder denied that failing to set a firm date for Poland's
entry meant there was no timetable for joining, nor that Germany
was uncertain in its support for Poland.
</P>
<P>
When Germany took up the EU's rotating presidency in the first
half of the next year, it would urge EU members to accelerate
internal reforms and further create conditions for its expansion.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder made a six-hour working visit to Poland on Thursday
at the invitation of the Polish government. It was Schroeder's
third foreign trip within one week after taking office.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Schroeder met Polish President Aleksander
Kwasniewski and Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek, and their talks
focused on the timetable for Poland's joining the EU, according to
the Polish Press Agency.
</P>
<P>
Poland has repeatedly expressed its willingness to join the EU
in 2002 or January, 2003, and the idea was openly supported by
Schroeder's predecessor Helmut Kohl.
</P>
<P>
However, some members of Schroeder's new government believe the
EU should adopt a more realistic position towards enlargement,
causing great concern within the Polish leadership and a growing
fear that Germany will change its policy on Poland.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with Schroeder, Buzek said the only difference
with Schroeder was that Poland wanted a concrete timetable for
joining the EU, and Germany was unable to agree to it.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: U.S. May Take Military Option Against Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 5 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
warned on Thursday that Iraq must resume cooperation with the
U.N. weapons inspectors, stressing that the U.S. may take
military option.
</P>
<P>
In a brief written statement after the U.N. Security Council
condemned Iraq's decision earlier in the day to stop cooperating
with U.N. inspectors, Clinton called Iraq's latest defiance of
U.N. resolutions "totally unacceptable."
</P>
<P>
Clinton said the resolution left no doubt that Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein must immediately resume full cooperation with U.N.
weapons inspectors -- "no ifs, no ands, no buts about it."
</P>
<P>
"Iraq's latest attempt to block the vital work of the
international weapons inspectors is totally unacceptable," Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
He said Iraq had "no one to blame but itself" for the
years-long effort to force Iraq to no longer threaten the region
or the world with weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
"Iraq could have ended its isolation long ago by simply
complying with the will of the world. The burden is on Iraq to get
back in compliance and meet its obligations -- immediately," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Clinton rejected suggestions that U.S.
allies in the Gulf did not support the U.S. policy on the new
stand-off with Iraq on weapons inspection.
</P>
<P>
"We believe we'll have the support we need, and all options are
on the table," Clinton told reporters after a meeting with
congressional Democratic leaders.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen is on a tour of the Gulf
region, lobbying for a tougher policy against Iraq, which decided
to suspend all cooperation with the U.N. inspectors.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that some Gulf states differed with the United
States and do not support a military resolution to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
"Actually, my information is that Secretary Cohen had a good
trip, and we believe we'll have the support that we need for
whatever decisions we ultimately make," said Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Clinton is dispatching his national security
adviser, Sandy Berger, to Europe this weekend to consult with
U.S. allies on the latest crisis with Iraq, a spokesman said on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The president has asked National Security Adviser Berger to go
to Europe to consult further with our allies on appropriate next
steps," said the National Security Council spokesman, David Leavy.
</P>
<P>
Iraq said Thursday that it would not resume cooperation with
the international weapons inspectors as a latest U.N. draft
resolution demanded, unless it was given a timetable for canceling
the economic sanctions imposed since 1990 due to its invasion of
Kuwait.

<P>
WASHINGTON, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Philadelphia was chosen on
Thursday to host the Republican National Convention in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The Republican selection committee picked Philadelphia over
Indianapolis, New Orleans, New York and San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
Three other cities, Chicago, Minneapolis and Charlotte in North
Carolina, were dropped earlier.
</P>
<P>
"The Liberty Bell and Independence Hall will make a compelling
backdrop for nominating a president and promoting our party's
vision for a better America in the 21st century," Republican
National Committee Chairman Jim Nicholson said.
</P>
<P>
The decision is subject to approval by the Republican National
Committee membership in January, but that was considered a
formality.
</P>
<P>
The choice has historic meaning for the Republican Party. In
1856 Philadelphia was the host of the first Republican convention.
</P>
<P>
In 1948, both the Republicans and Democrats held their
conventions in Philadelphia, nominating Thomas Dewey and Harry
S. Truman.

<HEADLINE> Black Market Rampant in Romania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The black market in Romania
is growing so fast that it is estimated to amount to one fifth of
the gross domestic product (GDP) this year, the daily National
Monitor newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Quoting a survey conducted by the Trade Union Bloc, the
newspaper said the underground economy will cost the state at
least one billion U.S. dollars this year through tax evasion.
</P>
<P>
The size of Romania's black market was expected to grow to 22
percent of the GDP this year, compared to 12 percent in 1994, the
survey said.
</P>
<P>
The study's estimates were quite conservative and the real size
of the underground economy could be much bigger, said Dumitru
Costin, president of the Trade Union Bloc.
</P>
<P>
The survey covers only illegal business operations such as
underground household factories, commercial activities and
transportation while the information on drug dealing, prostitution
and gambling was not gathered, he said.
</P>
<P>
As many as two million laborers, or one tenth of the total
population, were illegally employed, he said.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here pointed out that the parallel economy could be
curbed by strengthening financial disciplines.

<HEADLINE> Utahans Smoke Least in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Adult residents in the
U.S. state of Utah smoke less than their counterparts in any other
state, according to a survey released by U.S. Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDCP) Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The 1997 smoking rate among adults in Utah was 13.7 percent,
the lowest in the country. Above it on the list were California
(18.4 percent), Hawaii (18.6 percent) and the District of Columbia
(18.8 percent), reported the survey.
</P>
<P>
The highest rate was again in the state of Kentucky, where 30.8
percent of adult residents were smokers. Next were people in
Missouri (28.7 percent), Arkansas (28.5 percent) and Nevada (27.7
percent), CDCP said.
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, the agency estimated, 23 percent of adults smoke.
</P>
<P>
One reason for Utah's lowest rate is that a high percentage of
residents are Mormons who stand against tobacco, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
It also showed that smoking rate in the United States declined
slightly each year in the early 1990s but remained unchanged in
the past few years.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft to Build Research Laboratory in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Microsoft, the world's
largest software maker, said Thursday it plans to open a research
laboratory in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The research lab is the third of its kind outside its Redmond
headquarters. The other two sites were opened in San Francisco
and Cambridge, England, the company said.
</P>
<P>
"This new research lab is an example of Microsoft's long-term
commitment to innovation around the world, and also a long-term
commitment to China and the Chinese people," Rick Rashid, director
of Microsoft Research Division, said.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft plans to invest 80 million U.S. dollars over six
years to develop the lab, which would hire more than 100 Chinese
researchers to develop next-generation computing solutions.
</P>
<P>
"We want to build computers that speak, listen, see and learn,"
said the Beijing lab's director, Lee Kai-fu, an international
expert in speech recognition, multimedia and Internet technologies.
</P>
<P>
Lee said the complexity of the Chinese language, which contains
more than 5,000 distinct symbols, greatly inhibits computer
usage. Using speech recognition and other new input devices might
lessen the problem, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The researchers in China can better understand the
requirements of Chinese users," he added.

BUDAPEST, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Hungarian Prime Minister Orban
Viktor on Thursday canceled his plans to attend an international
meeting in Sweden because of serious flooding in his country.
</P>
<P>
Recently, the upper reaches of the Tisza River rose to
the highest level in this century due to constant rain.
</P>
<P>
In some places on the river, the water level rosed 1.6 meters
in seven hours, which could cause a large area of the river to
overflow its banks, experts said.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Orban inspected the Tisza River's upper reaches
Thursday afternoon. He said the state should take some essential
measures to control the floods.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Hungarian government said the state has
decided to appropriate another 500 million forint (about 2.4
million U.S. dollars) to strengthen the river's embankments.

<HEADLINE> Mega-Power Projects in India Get Counter-Guarantee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 6 (Xinhua) -- The Indian Union Cabinet has
decided to extend a de facto counter-guarantee to mega-power
projects in a bid to promote power development in the country,
official sources said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
A tripartite agreement will be signed between the Reserve Bank
of India (RBI), the Power Trading Corporation (PTC) and concerned
state governments to ensure payment to the power projects and the
corporation.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement, outstanding dues from the
defaulting states to PTC will be set off against their plan
outlays.
</P>
<P>
Under the government's power development policy, power from the
mega-projects, multi-state power projects with a capacity of more
than 1,000 megawatt each, will be sold to PTC, which in turn will
sell it to the states. This mechanism ensures that the private
developer is isolated from dealing with the states and settling
financial dues.
</P>
<P>
The states' risks will be taken on by PTC, jointly promoted by
Power Finance Corporation, Power Grid Corporation, National
Thermal Power Corporation, National Hydel Power Corporation and
various financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
The payment security mechanism, cleared by the Union Cabinet,
forms an integral part of the policy package as it ensures that
money for power sales can be recovered from the states in case
they fail to pay up on time.
</P>
<P>
The Union government plans to initially add around 20,000 MW of
power through the mega-projects in the country. It has already
provided customs/import duty relief to the promoters of these
projects.

<HEADLINE> Cuban, Spanish Ties Continue to Improve </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, November 5 (Xinhua) -- In a move to further improve
relations with Cuba, Spanish Foreign Affairs Minister Abel Matutes
will visit the Caribbean country next week, the Cuba Foreign
Ministry said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The ministry's spokesman Alejandro Gonzalez described the visit
beginning next Monday, as "a reflection of the good state of
diplomatic relations between the two countries."
</P>
<P>
He said Matutes' visit is important to preserve the good
relations between the two countries, which have been normalized.
</P>
<P>
"An ample agenda will be viewed during the visit," he added.
</P>
<P>
Cuban-Spanish ties turned sore in October 1996 after Havana
rejected a new Spanish ambassador who claimed he was going to
keep the door of his embassy open to all Cuban dissidents.
</P>
<P>
The two sides, however, resolved their differences after a
cooling off period.
</P>
<P>
A significant turn-point appeared at the recent
Iberian-American Summit convened in Portugal. Cuban leader Fidel
Castro met privately with Spanish King Juan Carlos I and his
Premier Jose Marie Aznar.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Castro visited Spain on his way home from the
summit and met Premier Aznar again.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Spain's minister of Industry Josep Pique and two
entrepreneurial delegations have visited Havana to help improve
ties.
</P>
<P>
Spain is now Cuba's largest commercial partner and one of its
major foreign investors. The normalization of bilateral relations
will benefit Spain and Cuba commercially and provide more venture
capital.
</P>
<P>
For Havana, an improved relation with Madrid will help provide
the opportunity to successfully host the 9th Iberian-American
summit to convene in 1999. The annual summit, which groups
19 Latin-American states, Spain and Portugal, was initiated by King
Juan Carlos I in 1976, in memory of Columbus's discovery of
America in 1492.

<P>
WASHINGTON, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Hurricane Mitch, which
killed 11,000 people and leading to another 13,000 missing in
Central America last week, became the deadliest Atlantic
hurricane in more than 200 years.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami said the deadliest
Atlantic hurricane ever documented was Great Hurricane in 1780,
which killed 22,000 people in the eastern Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
With the death toll figures announced on Thursday, Mitch, which
struck Honduras and Nicaragua last week, surpassed a hurricane
that struck Galveston, Texas, in 1900. The hurricane was blamed
for 8,000 to 12,000 deaths.
</P>
<P>
The last severe Atlantic hurricane was Hurricane Fifi, which
killed 8,000-10,000 people in Honduras in 1974.
</P>
<P>
Before Mitch this year, Hurricane Georges killed more than 500
people in the northern Caribbean in September, mostly due to
flooding and mudslides.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Optimistic Over Israel's Approval of Peace Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The United States said on
Thursday it remained optimistic that the Israeli cabinet would
approve a land-for-security deal to pave the way for its timely
implementation.
</P>
<P>
"We are optimistic that Prime Minister (Benjamin) Netanyahu is
going to get the approval of his cabinet, get the approval of his
government, and implement this agreement with no real delay in the
schedule set forth," said State Department spokesman James Rubin.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the "Crossfire" program of the Cable News Network
(CNN), Rubin called the wrangling about the accord in recent days
"a bump in the road."
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu had delayed a cabinet meeting to discuss the Wye
accord, signed in Washington on October 23, citing reasons that
the Palestinians failed to provide a complete security plan.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli cabinet began a session on the Wye agreement on
Thursday under the mediation and pressure from the United States,
but put off for another day a vote on the U.S.-brokered peace
agreement.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said that Secretary of State Madeleine Albright was
encouraged after speaking with Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel
Sharon on Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman had earlier predicted the cabinet's approval of
the accord, but late on Thursday issued a demand for
"clarifications" from Palestinian President Yasser Arafat on
annulling the articles of the Palestinian Charter calling for
Israel's destruction.
</P>
<P>
The controversy was touched off on Thursday when a senior
Palestinian negotiator rejected Israel's demand that the
700-member Palestine National Council convene and vote next month
to remove anti-Israeli provisions in the charter.

<HEADLINE> Moody's Projects 4 percent GDP Growth in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 6 (Xinhua) -- World rating agency Moody's
Investor Services expect India's real gross domestic product (GDP)
to grow by 4 percent in the 1998-99 fiscal year, Business Standard
reported here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Moody's has also projected India's current account deficit
of 2.7 percent and a public sector deficit of 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Moody's GDP growth rate forecast is much lower than the 6
percent estimated by the Indian government. Its estimate of the
current account deficit at 2.7 percent of GDP is also higher than
the government's target of 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Moody's forecast on most major indicators for India for
1998-99 is worse than the actuals for 1997-98. The public sector
financial balance (PSFB) is 11 percent of GDP for this fiscal
compared with 10.8 percent in the last fiscal, GDP growth is 4
percent against 5 percent, industrial production growth 4 percent
against 6.6 percent and total public sector debt is 70 percent of
GDP against 67 percent in the last fiscal.
</P>
<P>
The annual rate of inflation, based on the consumer price
index, is pegged at 8.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
"The large government deficit is worrisome in light of the
heavy public sector debt and debt servicing burden and the country
needs substantial investment for going forward," the Moody's said.

<HEADLINE> US Scientists Culture Embryonic Stem Cells </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, November 5 (Xinhua) -- A team of U.S. scientists
claimed Thursday that they have engineered human embryonic stem
cells -- parent cells of all tissues in the body.
</P>
<P>
Researchers from the University of Wisconsin said in a news
release that "the achievement has profound implication for
transplant medicine, drug discovery and basic developmental
biology."
</P>
<P>
A report on the research will be published November 6 in
Science magazine.
</P>
<P>
"It opens the possibility for some dramatic new transplant
therapies. Although a great deal of basic research needs to be
done before these cells lead to human therapies, I believe that in
the long run they will revolutionize many aspects of transplant
medicine." said the leading author of the report James A. Thomson.
</P>
<P>
Thomson's team established five independent cell lines and has
been growing them in culture. They have observed the cells
differentiating into the three primary germ lines that make up the
body -- endoderm, ectoderm and mesoderm -- and subsequently into
arrays of tissue cells such as cartilage, bone, muscle, neural and
gut cells.
</P>
<P>
Thomson said that these cell lines offer biologists insight
into developmental events that cannot be studied directly in the
human embryo, but that have important clinical consequences for
birth defects, infertility and pregnancy loss.
</P>
<P>
A more complete understanding of normal development will
ultimately allow the prevention or treatment of abnormal human
development, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that the most likely immediate application of human
embryonic stem cell technology would be strategies to quickly
screen hundreds of thousands of chemicals for effective medicines.
</P>
<P>
Thomson's group is now pursuing collaboration with clinical
scientists and transplant surgeons to perform the basic research
needed to ultimately develop human embryonic cell-based
therapies.

<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Total venture capital
investments in the United States continued at a record pace in the
year to date, reaching 9.4 billion U.S. dollars in the third
quarter, 13 percent higher than the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The result was released Thursday by the VentureOne Corporation,
a San Francisco-based provider of information and analysis of the
venture capital industry.
</P>
<P>
The third quarter alone saw 461 investment deals, totalling
3.16 billion dollars, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Information technology investments led the third quarter by
accounting for 66 percent of all investment dollars, with 282
transactions totalling 2.08 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
"Despite volatility in the broader financial market, venture
capitalists continued to make investments at a very strong pace in
a host of promising private companies, largely dominated by
information technology," said the company in a statement.
</P>
<P>
In the third quarter, 19 venture-backed companies went public,
raising 1.23 billion dollars in initial offerings. While this
number is down significantly from a year ago, both the median
amount raised per deal -- 46 million dollars -- and preoffer
valuations -- 239 million dollars -- were up dramatically over the
preceding quarter, VentureOne said.

<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Brazil's Congress
Wednesday approved a retirement reform plan that is providing new
hope that the government's fiscal austerity measures unveiled last
week will be approved.
</P>
<P>
Congress voted 343-125 to approve the plan, which will set a
ceiling of 1,000 U.S. dollars monthly pension from the social
security system for retirees.
</P>
<P>
Legislators however still need to vote on two related bills in
a social security reform package introduced to Congress nearly
three years ago. If approved, the reform is expected to save about
2.5 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the government unveiled a mix of taxes and spending
in a bid to save nearly 24 billion dollars in 1999 and about 80
billion dollars by 2002.
</P>
<P>
Brazil's economy has been pushed to the brink of collapse by
financial turmoil around the world which has already created
crises in Asia and Russia.
</P>
<P>
The government is hoping to win a rescue package of some 30
billion dollars from the International Monetary Fund.

<HEADLINE> Hyde Poses Questions to Clinton for Impeachment Inquiry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 5 (Xinhua) -- House Judiciary Committee
Chairman Henry Hyde asked U.S. President Bill Clinton on Thursday
to answer 81 questions for the House impeachment inquiry.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Clinton, Hyde, a Republican, said the questions
should be answered under oath and the answers would be used only
for the impeachment inquiry, not in other legal matters. It was
unclear how the president would respond.
</P>
<P>
The detailed questions delve beyond the grand jury questioning
of Clinton by Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's prosecutors on
August 17.
</P>
<P>
Hyde's questions focused on allegations of perjury or
obstruction of justice by the president. None sought details of
his affairs with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference in Chicago, Hyde said the purpose of the
questions was to "narrow the issues and bring this matter to a
close more quickly."
</P>
<P>
"The president is free to dispute, of course, whatever he
wants. But by agreeing to those facts that he does not dispute, he
will allow us to narrow the issues and bring this matter to a
close more quickly," Hyde was quoted as saying by the Associated
Press.
</P>
<P>
Hyde reiterated that he hoped to finish the inquiry by the end
of the year.
</P>
<P>
White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said Clinton's lawyers
were still digesting Hyde's letter and had no immediate comment.

<HEADLINE> Dinosaur-Bird not Father of Modern Birds: Scientists (1) by Yu Zheng </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Two prominent Chinese
paleontologists today rejected the theory of a direct connection
between dinosaur-birds and modern birds, saying that though they
share a common but yet undiscovered ancestor, they evolved along
separate paths.
</P>
<P>
Two fossilized bird-like dinosaurs, which were stumbled upon by
a Chinese farmer in northeastern Liaoning Province early this
year, aroused a global scientific debate. Many scientists have
argued that modern birds derive from the earth's remote giant
residents, the dinosaur.
</P>
<P>
The discoveries in Liaoning of the once-feathered creatures, or
protarchaeopteryx, apparently lent some credence to the hypothesis
that birds descended from small theropod dinosaurs.
</P>
<P>
"After repeated studies of the fossils, I don't believe the
creature had the same key characteristics as birds," said Hou
Lianhai, a research fellow with the Chinese Academy of Sciences'
Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology,
in an exclusive interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
"Birds might be remote cousins of dinosaurs rather than their
lineal descendents," said Hou, adding that their similarities may
have developed independently.
</P>
<P>
Although they have a long list of similar features such as the
wishbone, skull bones and feet with three forward-facing toes, the
two animals yet have distinctive difference, Hou claimed.
</P>
<P>
"According to the fossils," the bird expert said,
"protarchaeopteryx has its high and short skull bone fused
with the quadrate, but extant birds have no such property."
</P>
<P>
"The two short-armed specimens have saw-like teeth that were
flat and sharp, with deep bulbous roots, unlike the modern bird's
conical shape," Hou said.

<TEXT>
<P>
Also, their short arms could not support their bodies, and they
basically depended on two legs when moving, he said.
</P>
<P>
Heated argument on the link between dinosaurs and birds has
been going on for at least a century and a half, since naturalist
Thomas Huxley noted their similarities in the mid-1800s.
</P>
<P>
In the 1970s, famous dinosaur researcher John Ostrom at Yale
University concluded that archaeopteryx, the earlist known bird
whose fossils were excavated in Germany, resembled a scaled-down
version of the theropod dinosaur known as deinonychus.
</P>
<P>
The two specimens of dinosaur-like birds (or bird-like
dinosaurs) found in the tiny village of Sihetun in Liaoning added
fuel to the worldwide debate.
</P>
<P>
Scientists have long maintained that anything with feathers is
a bird.
</P>
<P>
Dong Zhiming, a Chinese dinosaur specialist who has gained a
worldwide reputation, said, "The latest finding shows these
creatures had all the key features of dinosaurs. Protarchaeopteryx
and birds have a collateral relationship rather than a lineal one."
</P>
<P>
Protarchaeopteryx lived roughly 130 million years ago, but the
earliest known bird ancestors, including archaeopteryx and
confuciusornis, appeared about 150 million years ago.
</P>
<P>
"Of course, a 130 million-year-old protarchaeopteryx could not be
the lineal ancestor of a 150 million-year-old archaeopteryx," said Dong,
also a research fellow at the CAS institute.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, most paleontologists believe that the feathers
covering the fossilized specimens at least suggest that they were
close relatives of birds.

<P>
They likely fanned the primitive plumes, which hardly had
aerodynamic qualities, for sexual display, Dong said.
</P>
<P>
Some experts around the world believe that the feathers acted
as vanes to improve stability during fast running; some others
even argue that protarchaeopteryx, with relatively short, clawed
wings, was probably one of the first birds to fly effectively.
</P>
<P>
Hou, however, regards the feathers on the dinosaur-birds as
subcutaneous tissue.
</P>
<P>
The so-called feathers are equivalent to the fibrous tissue in
reptiles, Hou said.
</P>
<P>
"The subcutaneous tissue in reptiles is comprised of collatens,
but bird feathers have keratins," he said, adding that he is
planning to discover what kind of protein the creature's
feathers had.
</P>
<P>
Scientists researching the segnosauria, a dinosaur that lived
in Asia, believe that its feather-like structure functioned to
keep it warm.
</P>
<P>
Mammal-like reptiles appeared more than 200 million years
ago, and some of them were warm-blooded, Hou added.
</P>
<P>
"The feathered creature that lived in Liaoning might not share
a close evolutionary heritage with birds," Dong said. Moreover,
many vertebrate paleontologists have begun to question whether
feathers are key features that automatically mean the feathered
creature is a bird.
</P>
<P>
"We still don't know exactly what role dinosaurs played in
the evolution of birds, so scientists must continue this study,"
the dinosaur expert said.

<HEADLINE> Causes of Migraine to be Focus of U.S. Symposium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The genetics of migraine
headaches will be the focus of a symposium this week of headache
experts from the United States and around the world.
</P>
<P>
The American Association for the Study of Headache (AASH) said
Thursday that causes and treatments of other forms of headache
will also be discussed at its fall meeting in Scottsdale, Arizona.
</P>
<P>
According to AASH statistics, migraine affects at least 25
million Americans, almost one in five women and over one in 20
men. It often results in disability, days lost from work and
disruption in social and family life. The lost workdays cost
Americans 13 billion U.S. dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
Surveys have demonstrated that proneness or susceptibility to
migraine is largely hereditary. Between 70 and 90 percent of
sufferers have other family members who are or have been affected.
</P>
<P>
AASH said that researchers are gaining insights into the causes
of various forms of headache, and several new treatments have
recently become available. Association president-elect Richard
Lipton, for instance, will discuss new drugs of the class of
chemicals called "triptans" and are used largely for treating
migraine.
</P>
<P>
The International Headache Society has published criteria for
diagnosis of migraine that are now widely accepted and used by
physicians all over the world. According to the criteria,
migraine usually may have two of these features: one-sided pain,
throbbing pain, pain so bad it interferes with or prevents normal
activity, and pain that is worsened by activity. In addition,
migraine is also marked by nausea or vomiting, and sensitivity to
light and noise.
</P>
<P>
According to AASH, migraine and some other types of headache are
caused by an electrical and chemical instability of certain key brain
centers that regulate blood vessels around the head and the neck, as
well as the flow of pain messages into the brain. This instability
seems to be inherited and appears to involve chemical messengers known
as neuro-transmitters. The neuro-transmitter serotonin, in particular,
plays a key role. Therefore these headaches can be treated by using
drugs that stabilize brain chemistry.

<HEADLINE> Ukrainian Official Backs Debt Payment to Russia in Goods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine's agreement with Russia to
repay its gas debt of about 1 billion U.S. dollars in commodities
is a way out of financial troubles for both sides, a senior
Ukrainian official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine's First Deputy Prime Minister Anatoly Golubchenko told
reporters here that Russia is facing a shortage of foreign
currency stemming from its current financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Russia also has difficulties with exports since foreign
importers are reluctant to settle accounts in local currencies
considering the instability of the rouble, he said. Exchanging
goods for his country's gas debts would enable both sides to
obtain what they needed without using their own weak currencies.
</P>
<P>
Russia and Ukraine reached an agreement on November 3 to allow
Ukraine to pay its gas debt to Russia by supplying industrial and
agricultural goods.
</P>
<P>
The accord also sets the fee charged by Russia for every 1,000
cubic meters of gas to Ukraine at 50 dollars.
</P>
<P>
According to another Russian-Ukrainian accord, signed at the
end of last year concerning Russia's gas supply in 1998, Ukraine
is to reduce Russia's gas transportation fee to 1.09 dollars
for every 1,000 cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
Russia, in return, will lower the price of its gas supplied to
Ukraine to 50 dollars for every 1,000 cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
Because of the lack of energy, Ukraine has traditionally relied
on Russia for its natural gas supplies. However, money-pinched
Ukraine has in recent years owed Russia 1.2 billion U.S. dollars
in gas debts.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have had several rounds of negotiations on this
issue, and the Russian side even threatened to reduce its gas
supply to Ukraine in 1999 if the latter failed to repay debts in
arrears.
</P>
<P>
Since the accord was signed, Russia agreed to export to Ukraine
about 50 billion cubic meters of gas in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Russia's gas transported via Ukraine this year is estimated to
be between 110 to 114 billion cubic meters, compared with 100
billion cubic meters in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Ukrainian Foreign Exchange Market Stabilizes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The Ukrainian foreign exchange
market is returning to stability after the government intervention
to maintain the value of the currency, the National Bank President
Viktor Yushehenko said on Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
On the bourse, the value of foreign currency changes into the
Ukrainian hrivnia totalled up to 29 million U.S. dollars, as
opposed to 20 million dollars worth of exchanges into foreign
cash, Yushehenko said.
</P>
<P>
The National Bank is studying on the possibility of gradually
cutting the administrative limit on foreign currency buying by
commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
But he noted that the National Bank would not cancel the
ceiling price of the foreign exchange corridor, 3.5 hrivnias to
the dollar which was set at the beginning of September.
</P>
<P>
The foreign exchange rate in Ukrainian market was maintained at
3.43 hrivnias for one dollar in the past two weeks, because the
government intervened into the market and forced companies to pay
taxes owed.
</P>
<P>
The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank provided a
500-million-dollar loan to the country in September and a
150-million-dollar loan recently, which also contributed to the
stability of the hrivnia.

<HEADLINE> Panama Historian Praises Chinese Community's Contribution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, November 5 (Xinhua) -- A Panamanian historian
Thursday highlighted the Chinese community's contributions to
Panama in the intellectual, social and political fields.
</P>
<P>
The historian, Professor Jorge Kam at the Santa Maria la
Antigua University, said that the Chinese community, which has a
small population of 80,000 now, has produced a number of
outstanding figures during its century-long presence in the
Central American country.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a ceremony marking the 95th anniversary of Panama's
independence from the Colombian territory on November 4, 1903,
Kam said that during the War of the 100 Days between liberals and
conservatives at the end of the 19th century, a Chinese settler
was killed by the conservatives who accused him of being a liberal
engaged in the struggle for independence.
</P>
<P>
In the 20th century, the Chinese community had the outstanding
figures, including Julio Yao, a political analyst specialized in
the United States-Panama canal treaties; Gissela Chung, a lawyer
and former legislator, and Jose Chen Barria, former General
Comptroller.
</P>
<P>
The arts and the letters of Panama have also felt the Chinese
presence with the contributions of Manuel Chong Neto, a painter of
Chinese background, and Gloria Young, a poet and legislator.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese were among a large number of Asian laborers who
participated in the construction of the Panama Canal, an
interoceanic waterway recognized as the eighth wonder of the world.
</P>
<P>
Today the Chinese community has assimilated itself completely
to the Panamanian society, taking an active part in the
socio-economic development of this country, the historian said.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian Football
Federation announced to launch a 78 million birr (11 million US
dollars) "Ethio Football Ten-Year Development Project" throughout
the country.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ethiopian Herald on Thursday, federation
President Gizaw Teklemariam told local reporters that although
Ethiopia is among the founders of the African Football
Confederation in 1957, its football has not shown progress as
expected.
</P>
<P>
Gizaw said football in Ethiopia is lagging far behind that of
some Western and Northern African countries such as Ghana,
Nigeria,Morocco, Egypt and Cameroon.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to reinvigorate the bad state of football, the
federation has recently launched a youth training project in
which over 6,800 youngsters (of up to 20 years of age) are
embraced for training by 340 coaches, 34 master coaches and two
national instructors, Gizaw noted.
</P>
<P>
As Ethiopia is preparing to stage the African Youth Football
Tournament after three years it becomes important for the public,
non-governmental and governmental organizations to support the
youth training project underway across the country, he said.
</P>
<P>
Gizaw urged for the active involvement of the public
throughout the progress of the project which, he said, can only
succeed if the public honestly supports it both financial terms
and through their genuine comments.

<P>
TIANJIN, November 6 (Xinhua) -- The former residence of Fu
Jinxiang, an elderly lady living in this large north China
metropolis, was far different from the one she moved into recently.
</P>
<P>
Four generations of her family lived in three old one-storey
rooms with a total floor space of 27 square meters.
</P>
<P>
In the rainy season, this shabby house in a low-lying area
couldn't kept the rain out. "So the nine members of our family
organized to build an earthen ramp in front of the threshold to
prevent the rain from entering our rooms," she said. "Household
appliances like the washing machine and refrigerator had to be
placed on stepping stones to avoid being soaked by the water
flowing into the room."
</P>
<P>
"My eldest son remained single for a quite a long time because
he lacked a bridal chamber," she added.
</P>
<P>
Early this year, the family moved into new quarters where they
have three two-room apartments equipped with central heating and
gas.
</P>
<P>
"I never dreamed of living in such a good apartment, almost
four times bigger than the old one," said the 63-year-old lady.
</P>
<P>
Fu's new residential area consists of eight highrise buildings
constructed on an area formerly crammed with ramshackle bungalows
which housed 1,900 households with 6,000 people before being
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin, the largest port city in north China with a population
of 9 million, had 25 neighborhoods covered with millions of
worn-out single-storey houses with simple and crude equipment five
years ago. In some places, several households shared a kitchen and
a wash room.
</P>
<P>
City Mayor Li Shenglin said Tianjin launched an urban housing
transformation plan in 1994. To date, 80 percent of the old shabby
and dilapidated houses have been replaced with skyscrapers, and
over 650,000 local residents have moved into new homes. The per
capita living space in the urban districts has expanded from 9.68
square meters in 1993 to last year's 12.3 square meters, higher
than the national average.

<P>
The city's plan was integrated with a new nationwide housing
reform program which will abolish the welfare system for
residential housing distribution that operated across the
country for nearly 50 years. People are now encouraged to buy
their own residences with the help of government subsidies and
loans.
</P>
<P>
Under the reform plan, high-grade apartments will be sold at
market prices, middle-income families will enjoy housing sold at
government-set prices, and low-income families will receive
government-run low-rent dwellings.
</P>
<P>
Fu, a low-income earner, paid 20,000 yuan for her new home,
apart from government compensation for her old house. The payment
was made from bank savings and accumulated housing subsidies
offered by the government since the start of housing reform.
</P>
<P>
Her neighbors, a couple with a combined monthly income of more
than 10,000 yuan, bought a luxury commercial apartment with more
than 100 square meters at a cost of 300,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
One real estate developer said that 90 percent of individual
buyers will look for more affordable apartments. Luxury commercial
apartments for the prosperous now make up about 10 percent of all
available housing.
</P>
<P>
In order to have a better living environment, a great number of
urban dwellers, especially newlyweds and those who have recently
moved, have been spending a lot on interior decoration in recent
years. Interior decorators across the country have seen their
businesses grow by 30 percent annually during the past decade,
with an annual average turnover of 100 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Xu Yin, manager of an interior decoration company in Tianjin,
said his company has shifted its emphasis from
public facilities to individual households because many people
want their services before moving into a new home.
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to alleviate pollution, Tianjin has increased the
use of gas and central heating in all new residential quarters,
and nearly 92 percent of its residents have replaced coal- and
firewood-burning stoves with gas for cooking. As a result, the air
in the city proper has become fresher and cleaner.
</P>
<P>
However, the per capita living space of more than 3 million
urban households throughout the country is still less than four
square meters. To increase the average per capita living space to
nine square meters for urban residents by the end of the century,
China must build 175 million square meters of housing annually.

<HEADLINE> Thailand, Vietnam, Laos to Streamline Transport Links </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Thailand, Vietnam and Laos are
looking at ways to streamline cross-border transport links for
less cost because of the economic recession.
</P>
<P>
Next month they will discuss ways to improve procedures for
trade and goods in transit under an Asian Development
Bank-supported agreement, which also includes Myanmar, Cambodia
and Yunnan province of China.
</P>
<P>
To improve the east-west corridor linking the nations of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), a second bridge is
to be built across the Mekong River, linking Mukdahan province,
northeastern Thailand, with Savannakhet in Laos.
</P>
<P>
Road links with Vietnam will be improved and Danang port in
central Vietnam will be upgraded.
</P>
<P>
The Bangkok Post Friday quoted Thai Transport and
Communications Ministry officials as saying that Thailand, Laos
and Vietnam have agreed to move ahead with the transport
agreement, without waiting for the participation of other ASEAN
members.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN transport ministers, who met in Singapore last September,
had failed to agree on details of agreements covering transport
and goods in transit.
</P>
<P>
But Thailand, Laos and Vietnam had the full support from the
Asia Development Bank (ADB) And Japan's Overseas Economic
Cooperation Fund (OECF), which are financing the construction of
the second Mekong bridge, to go ahead with their plan, a Thai
official said.
</P>
<P>
"The Japanese would like to ensure their money is spent
usefully. The ADB requires that the three countries cooperate in
minimizing red tape and customs and immigration procedures, while
the OFCF sets an unofficial condition that the bridge should be
used effectively by the countries concerned," he said.
</P>
<P>
The official said it was hoped that the three governments (of
Thailand, Laos and Vietnam) would approve the three-way agreement
before the second bridge is built next year or in 2000.
</P>
<P>
In a related move, Laos is looking at the Thai draft of an
agreement to replace the current three-year land transport pact
that is soon to expire.

<P>
BEIJING, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Beijing's ambitious cleanup of
its rivers and lakes, which started in April, is making progress
as winter approaches.
</P>
<P>
After six months, the wide-ranging cleanup and reconstruction
along the Tongzihe River has progressed to clearing garbage from
the river itself.
</P>
<P>
The Tongzihe River, the 600-year-old moat surrounding the
Forbidden City in the middle of Beijing, ahs long been known as
the city's necklace.
</P>
<P>
Today's China Daily quoted Liu Licheng, an official with the
Beijing River System Renovation Headquarters, as saying that the
whole project will be completed in two years.
</P>
<P>
For Teng Shutang, chief engineer of the Beijing Water
Conservancy Bureau, the most difficult part of the project was not
the engineering itself but stopping direct sewage discharges into
the river and removing illegal housing on the river banks.
</P>
<P>
Altogether, about 90,000 cubic meters of garbage and silt
have piled up on the river bed. Two-thirds of the deposits are
garbage, officials said.
</P>
<P>
The other important part of the whole Beijing clean up,
beautifying the Six Seas, has begun at Beihai Lake. Work on
Zhonghai and Nanhai lakes, which began in August, is officially
finished.
</P>
<P>
People along the Jingmi Diversion Works running from Kunming
Lake at the Summer Palace to Yuyuantan Lake at the Purple Bamboo
Park can see water in the river again after more than six months,
and it is clear for the first time in years.
</P>
<P>
According to latest report, the city has spent 336 million yuan
(40.5 million US dollars) on the project.

<HEADLINE> Men Take up Domestic Service Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 6 (Xinhua) -- The stereotype that domestic
service jobs have always been done by women is broken by more and
more men who have taken up such jobs.
</P>
<P>
According to today's China Daily, Jiang Tao, a laid-off male
worker at the age of 29, now does washing and kitchen cleaning for
two families everyday, with the payment of 6 yuan or 0.72
U.S. dollars per hour. He also repairs automobiles and does
electrical maintenance.
</P>
<P>
Jiang has signed a contract with the Daily Bridge Home Service
Company, a non-State enterprise, which will pay into his personal
pension, medicare and unemployment insurance accounts. Among the
63 employees who are laid-off workers, 16 are male, earning an
average 500 yuan, or 60 U.S. dollars per month.
</P>
<P>
The total number of male maids is not available right now, for
it is only recently that men have taken up home services. In the
past, few laid-off workers in Beijing would like to do home
services which were considered face losing. And most of the home
services at that time were done by rural girls.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Jiyuan, an official with the Beijing Municipal Bureau of
Labour and Social Security noted that the local government will
pay non-State enterprises 3,000-6,000 yuan (361-722 U.S. dollars)
if they sign contracts of two years or more with a laid-off woman
over 35 and man over 40.
</P>
<P>
There were 47,000 laid-off workers in Beijing by the end June,
according to bureau statistics.

<P>
The Shandong section of the Yellow River faces a number of
serious problems, according to a local government official, who
explained that water flow has been interrupted many times over the
past decade and the capacity to discharge flood waters in the
river has been reduced because of a rising riverbed caused by
silting.
</P>

Because little money was spent on flood prevention for many
years there are many hidden dangers that are in bad need of
attention and an immediate solution, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Spain has renewed demands that
the United States clear 2,000 anti-personnel landmines deployed on
its territory.
</P>
<P>
Spanish Foreign Minister Abel Matutes Y Juan raised the demand
in a letter to U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
Spain and the U.S. have held negotiations on landmine clearance
since the summer, but no agreement has been reached because the
U.S. is not a signatory to the international convention banning
landmines.
</P>
<P>
The landmines are mainly deployed in Rota, a joint naval and
air base in southern Spain. Under a defense agreement between the
two countries, Spain has retained sovereignty over the base.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. deployed the landmines a few years ago for the
possible use of its troops.
</P>
<P>
The Spanish government said that there are 800,000 landmines on
its territory. Special funds have been appropriated for landmine
clearance.

<P>
CHONGQING, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Chongqing Municipality is
stepping up its campaign against the smuggling of relics and goods
involving the use of fake documents.
</P>
<P>
The focus has been on the illegal shipping of relices uncovered
during construction of the Three Gorges Project -- the largest
water conservation project ever undertaken in China.
</P>
<P>
Latest figures show that since 1996, Chongqing Customs
officials have prosecuted 16 such smuggling cases involving 164
relics from the Three Gorges area.
</P>
<P>
Between January and August of this year, Customs also spotted
four smuggling attempts making use of counterfeit documents or
papers with false seals and signatures.
</P>
<P>
Another focal point is combating the evasion of tariffs. By
September, the Customs Office had prosecuted nine such cases, the
largest involving as much as 97 million yuan (10.843 million U.S.
dollars).

on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Real have now collected nine points and stood on top of the

</P>
<P>
Graz are eliminated and are the only side of the 24 in the
competition without a point after four games.
</P>
<P>
In a match put back from Wednesday because of a waterlogged
pitch, Austria striker Mario Haas put Sturm ahead after just four
minutes, but Real, who beat the Austrian side 6-1 in Madrid two
weeks ago, hit back immediately when Italian Christian Panucci
headed in a free kick in the seventh minute.
</P>
<P>
From then on Real completely dominated the pitch as Predrag
Mijatovic, Clarence Seedorf, Davor Suker and Panucci again all
found the net to give the Spanish side the convincing win.

<HEADLINE> ABL Opens While NBA Lockout Continues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 4 (Xinhua) -- When the American
Basketball League opens its third season today in Hartford, the
big question isn't who will win the game between the Philadelphia
Rage and New England Blizzard.
</P>
<P>
It will be "Is this the beginning of the end of the ABL?" The
ABL has been in trouble in the past two season.
</P>
<P>
The teams in Atlanta and Long Beach were foldong because of a
lack of fan support. Non-player league employees were askeke a 10% pay cut.
</P>
<P>
Two-time ABL All-Star and Olympian Dawn Staley has joined the
rival WNBA.
</P>
<P>
ABL co-founder Gary Cavalli says this season is crucial to the
league's future, but he says the ABL is starting to establish
itself as a part of the American sports scene.
</P>
<P>
"WE've had our share of skeptics since day one," Cavalli says.
"We've had a tough off-season from a business stand-point. But
we take pride in proving people wrong."
</P>
<P>
This season, the nine-team league will feature two expansion
teams - Chicago and Nashville - that will be stocked with players
from the defunct Long Beach and Atlanta franchises.
</P>
<P>
Along with Staley, the ABL also will be without fellow
Olympian Katrina McClain, who has been suspended from the Chicago
team for not reporting to camp.
</P>
<P>
With seven members of the world championship team, including
last year's ABL MVP Natalie Williams, and four-time Olympian
Teresa Edwards, the league still looks healthy.
</P>
<P>
But the ABL is losing the popularity battle to the WNBA. This
summer, the WNBA had an average attendance of 10,869. The ABL,
which plays in smaller arenas, hopes to bring in 6,000 a game, up
20% from last season.
</P>
<P>
ABL season ticket sales are up 30%. WNBA games are on NBC,
ESPN and Lifetime. The ABL will have 16 games on cable's Fox
Sports Net and two games of its championsip series on CBS.
</P>
<P>
However, the ABL might get an unexpected windfall of
television coverage should the NBA lockout continue. The NBA has
canceled all games through November 30, and with neither side
close to an agreement, the cancellations could run into December.
</P>
<P>
Cavalli says regional television networks that televise NBA
games have already contacted him about broadcasting ABL games in
those spots.
</P>
<P>
"The ABL should start a petition to canonize David Stern as a
saint and as the saving grace of the ABL," says Roger Noll, an
economics professor at Stanford. "The NBA have created a vacuum
and golden opportunity for the ABL to get the kind of public
exposure it needs, and then it will catch on."
</P>
<P>
Noll says the next two or three months will be crucial for the
ABL. He predicts NBA fans will react in the same way their major
league baseball counterpats did during the 1994 labour strife.
</P>
<P>
"The best year the minor leagues had was in 1995," Noll says.
"The fans didn't give up the sport, they gave up the
institution."

<HEADLINE> German Assistance for Yellow River Environmental Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, November 6 (Xinhua) -- An environmental protection
project will begin in the Yellow River Delta in China's Shandong
Province next April with two million German marks (about 1.2
million U.S. dollars) in backing, according to the head of a
German delegation that visited the province recently.
</P>
<P>
This will be the third phase of an environmental-monitoring
project with financial assistance from the German government that
began in 1994 to do environmental quality surveys of the Dongying
region of the Yellow River.
</P>
<P>
The first two phases used six million German marks to help local
environmental protection departments focus on environmental
protection. Specialists have worked on 69 technology renovation
programs to reduce pollution and enhance economic efficiency.
</P>
<P>
The third-phase will focus on treating pollution and provide
local people with more access to information on environmental
protection.

<HEADLINE> Northeastern China Protecting Natural Forests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, November 6 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government has
launched a program to reduce the amount of logging on the Da
Xing'an Ling mountain range to protect the natural forests there.
</P>
<P>
Lumber output in the forested areas there this year is to be
reduced by 290,000 cubic meters from last year to 3.1 million
cubic meters and will further decrease year on year to 2.1 million
cubic meters in 2000, according to a local forestry department
official.
</P>
<P>
Forested areas of the Da Xing'an Ling mountains provide a
substantial amount of lumber each year, with some of China's
largest forest reserves.
</P>
<P>
But, non-stop logging has upset the ecosystem in the mountains,
and a 1987 fire made matters even worse. So, the new program calls
for 1.2 million hectares of forest to be off-limits to logging,
and that area will be increased to 2.5 million hectares in 2000,
said the official.
</P>
<P>
Forest coverage in the mountains is expected to increase by six
percent to 80 percent in 2010, and the amount of new wood will
exceed that harvested.

<HEADLINE> Villa Sign Dublin at 9.5 Million Dol </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 5 (Xinhua) -- English Premier League leaders
Aston Villa completed a signing of striker Dion Dublin from
premier league neighbours Coventry for 5.75 million pounds (9.5
million U.S.dollars) on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The 29-year-old, who made his England debut last season, may
make his debut against Tottenham Hotspur on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the week Dublin snubbed a move to Leeds and also
rejected a move to Blackburn Rovers. Both clubs had offered more
than Villa but the player had a clause in his contract allowing
him to talk to any club who offered more than five million pounds.
</P>
<P>
Dublin made his name as a bustling lower league striker with
Cambridge United before securing a dream move to Manchester
United in 1992.
</P>
<P>
However, a broken leg and other injuries limited his first
team chances and he made just 12 appearances for the Old Trafford
club in two years, moving to Coventry for two million pounds in
1994.
</P>
<P>
He quickly became a firm favourite with the Coventry fans,
scoring vital goals in their regular battles against relegation
and finishing as the club's top scorer four years running. He
also performed admirably as a stand-in centre back.
</P>
<P>
Dublin signed a five-year contract in July, making him
Coventry's highest paid player ever.
</P>
<P>
He forced his way into the England reckoning in February and
although he did not make it into the World Cup 22, coach Glenn
Hoddle said he had been "very close."

<HEADLINE> Chinese Ambassador to UN on Question of Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Dialogue, consultation
and mutual trust building were the only ways to solve the question
of Iraq, China stressed here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the meeting of the Untied Nations Security Council,
Chinese Permanent Representative to the Untied Nations said the
Council should seriously reflect on the root causes of the
issues of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Qin said Iraq should fulfill in a comprehensive manner the
obligations under relevant U.N. resolutions, but the Council also
had the obligations to make a fair, objective assessment of Iraq's
compliance.
</P>
<P>
Qin said China was of the view that regarding some weapons
files, conditions were already ripe to move from the present
verification phase to the long-term monitoring phase.
</P>
<P>
Qin said but the fact that the Security Council had been unable to
make such a political decision was regrettable.
</P>
<P>
Qin said conducting the comprehensive review of Iraq, proposed
by the U.N. Secretary-General and accepted by the Security
Council, was still a way out of the present impasse.
</P>
<P>
Qin urged all sides concerned to exercise restraints and to try
to resolve their differences through dialogue and cooperation, and
to refrain from any actions that might sharpen the conflict.

<HEADLINE> Laudrup Put Chelsea in Last Eight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Brian Laudrup scored his first,
and the last goal for Chelsea on Thursday as the defending
champions beat FC Copenhagen 1-0 to go through to the Cup
Winners' Cup quarter-finals 2-1 on aggregate.
</P>
<P>
Laudrup's 32nd minute winner eliminated the team he is widely
expected to join upon returning home to Denmark in the next few
days.
</P>
<P>
Laudrup, who joined the English club from Rangers at the start
of the season, nodded home the rebound after Pierluigi
Casiraghi's header from a Graeme Le Saux cross rebounded from the
bar.
</P>
<P>
Chelsea survived fierce Copenhagen pressure in the second
half, with goalkeeper Ed De Goey in great form, to keep alive
their bid to become the first team to retain the trophy -- in its
final year of existence.
</P>
<P>
Lazio also progressed, beating Partizan Belgrade 3-2 in
Yugoslavia following their goalless first leg.
</P>
<P>
Real Mallorca were held 0-0 at home by Genk but went through
on the away goals rule after their 1-1 draw in Belgium.
</P>
<P>
Maccabi Haifa became the first Israeli team to reach the
quarter-finals of a European competition as their 4-1 victory was
enough to beat Austrian side Ried 5-3 on aggregate.
</P>
<P>
It was a memorable achievement for Haifa, who eliminated Paris
St Germain in the last round.
</P>
<P>
Ophir Kopel of Haifa and Reid's Gunther Steininger were sent
off in the first 10 minutes and Ried also had Farouk Hijdorogic
shown the red card in injury time.
</P>
<P>
Norwegian side Valerenga blasted three goals in nine
second-half minutes to wipe out a 3-0 deficit in Turkey, drawing
3-3 with Besiktas to go through 4-3 on aggregate.
</P>
<P>
Valerenga have been under the caretaker charge of Norway's
World Cup coach Egil Olsen since August and this result might be
enough to convince him to take on the job full time.
</P>
<P>
Miljenko Mumlek and Faik Kamberovic each scored twice as
Varteks Varazdin of Croatia ousted Dutch representatives
Heerenveen 4-2 after extra time for a 5-4 aggregate.
</P>
<P>
Mumlek hit the decisive goal three minutes from the end of
extra time.
</P>
<P>
Lokomotiv Moscow lost 1-0 at Braga but went through 3-2 on
aggregate to complete a miserable week for the Portuguese team
who sacked coach Vitor Oliveira on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Panionios Athens completed a 4-2 aggregate win over Apollon
Limassol with a 1-0 success in Cyprus, Antonis Sapountzis scoring
the only goal in the 18th minute from long range.
</P>
<P>
The competition, in its final year following UEFA's
re-organisation for next season, takes a break until March, when
the two-legged quarter-finals will be played.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Jobless Queue Down, First Time Since 1996 in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, November 6 (Xinhua) -- A Wellington-based newspaper
Friday attributed Thursday's rises in New Zealand dollar and share
 prices to a fall in unemployment, which, it said, raised hopes
that the economy in the country is "stronger than previously
thought."
</P>
<P>
According to figures released Thursday by the Household Labor
Force Survey of New Zealand, the unemployment rate in the third
quarter was at 7.4 percent, down from 7.7 percent in the previous
quarter, showing the jobless people dropping to 138,000 from
143,000.
</P>
<P>
Government officials and local economists had expected the rate
to rise above eight percent.
</P>
<P>
The Dominion quoted New Zealand Work and Income Minister Roger
Sowry as saying the fall in unemployment was good news in a
difficult global economy, and he was hopeful of an early return to
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
"It puts us in a very strong position," he said. "I'm not going
to make a prediction, but the feedback I get from the business
community is that they are doing better than they thought they
would a few months ago."
</P>
<P>
Local financial markets welcomed the fall in unemployment as a
sign that the economy in the country may have turned the corner.
The N.Z. dollar rose a third of a cent to 53.7 cents of the U.S.
dollar and the sharemarket galloped 3.25 percent higher with the
NZSE40 Index rising above the 2,000-point mark, first time since
August, to 2,030 points.
</P>
<P>
The Thursday's rise in sharemarket was built on its stunning
3.8 percent rise on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Don Turkington, managing director of the New Zealand Cavill
White Securities, said the sharemarket has broken out of the
downtrend established by the onset of the Asian crisis last year.
</P>
<P>
Minister Sowry said he believed there was "a real chance" that
the unemployment rate would not go above eight percent despite the
 New Zealand Treasury's prediction that it would reach 8.5
percent, and New Zealand economic growth would return sooner than
predicted.
</P>
<P>
"We can be a lot more confident than we have been," he said.
</P>
<P>
But different opinions could also be heard among local
economists. They said it is "too soon to say that the economy has
turned for the better." The fall in unemployment was due entirely
to a drop in the number of people actively seeking work, they
said.
</P>
<P>
Bernard Hodgetts, chief economist of the Australia-New Zealand
Bank (ANZ), said: "If you're not actually actively looking for
work, you're not classified as being unemployed."
</P>
<P>
Employment spokesman of the Labor Party Steve Maharey said the
fall in unemployment is "merely a blip." More than 11,000
redundancies have been reported by the media so far this year,
compared with 6,000 for all of last year, he said.
</P>
<P>
Many local economists still believe the unemployment rate will
rise to at least 8.5 percent by the middle of next year.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon Not Identified Cause for Gulf War Illness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The Pentagon said on
Thursday it was unlikely heavy smoke from more than 600 oil well
fires in the 1991 Gulf War caused long-term health problems for
U.S. troops in and near Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Pentagon said studies on oil smoke inhalation
were still under way, but results to date suggested only that
large smoke particles from the Kuwait fires were more likely to
cause short-term exacerbation of asthma, bronchitis or other
respiratory problems.
</P>
<P>
The raging fires, set by Iraqi troops as they retreated from a
U.S.-led military coalition in Kuwait, burned over a period of
about nine months in 1991 before all were extinguished.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of Gulf War veterans have made complaints ranging
from dizziness to memory loss, but there were no determination of
the cause of the illness after a series of studies in the past few
years.
</P>
<P>
Some symptoms among troops at the time included "coughing,
black mucous in nasal discharge, eye and throat irritation, and
the onset of skin rashes and shortness of breath," the Pentagon
said.
</P>
<P>
"Those highly visible, irritating effects of the oil well fires
were caused by carbon particles and oil droplets too large to
penetrate deeply into the soldiers' respiratory systems," it
added.
</P>
<P>
An extensive review of scientific literature on oil fire smoke
conducted by the private Rand Corporation indicated that "the
concentrations of contaminants contained in the smoke... were much
lower than the levels that are currently known to cause disease in
the long term," the Pentagon said.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon said earlier that thousands of U.S. troops may
have been exposed to low levels of chemical agents when American
military engineers blew up Iraqi rockets after the war. But no
link has been established between that possible exposure and the
medical complaints.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Urges Iraq to Resume Full </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The resolution was adopted after days of consultation among the
Council members. Iraq announced on October 31 that it had decided
to suspend all its ties with the United Nations Special Commission
(UNSCOM)in charge of dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
In the resolution, which did not threaten to use force
against Iraq, condemned Iraq's decision to cease cooperation
with UNSCOM as a flagrant violation of U.N. resolution 687 of
1991 and other relevant resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The Council demand that Iraq rescind immediately and
unconditionally the decision to suspend cooperation with UNSCOM
and to maintain restrictions on the work of the International
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), and that Iraq provide immediate,
complete and unconditional cooperation with UNSCOM and IAEA.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council expressed its full support for UNSCOM
and IAEA in their efforts to ensure the implementation of their
mandate under the relevant resolutions of the Council.
</P>
<P>
The Council also expressed its full support for the U.N.
Secretary-General in his efforts to seek full implementation of
the Memorandum of Understanding signed on February 23, 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Council reaffirmed its intention to honor its obligations in
accordance with the relevant provisions of resolution 687 of
1991.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Unemployment Steady and Payroll Growth Slower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. unemployment rate
remained steady at 4.6 percent in October following slow growth in
employers' payrolls and the seventh consecutive job dip at
factories in nine months, the Labor Department said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The unemployment rate held unchanged as of September, though
employers added just 116,000 positions to payrolls, according to
the department.
</P>
<P>
The unemployment rate remains low by historical standards,
although it is up significantly from April and May, when it
touched a 28-year low of 4.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
The weak payroll number boosted stock and bond prices because
it provided unanticipated evidence the economy is weakening. That
leaves open the strong possibility of another interest-rate
reduction from the Federal Reserve in mid-November.
</P>
<P>
At midafternoon, the Dow Jones average of industrial stocks was
up about 40 points. It had started the day by declining.
</P>
<P>
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said today that he saw
evidence "investor fright" was lessening. That's partly what had
prompted the Fed to twice cut short-term rates, on September 29
and October 15.
</P>
<P>
The payroll gain of 116,000 in October followed a revised
increase of 157,000 in September, up from an earlier estimate of
69,000.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturing employment declined by 52,000 jobs in October,
the seventh drop in nine months. This is the sector most affected,
so far, by the economic slump in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Retail employment fell by 10,000, mining and oil-drilling by
5,000 and state government by 11,000. However, jobs in business
services rose by 58,000, construction by 19,000, transportation
and public utilities by 19,000, finance, insurance and real estate
by 25,000, health services by 12,000, federal government by 18,000
and local government by 17,000.

UNITED NATIONS, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Three United Nations
bodies charged with auditing and oversight had agreeed to adopt a
balanced approach to accountability, a UN release said on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Board of Auditors, the Joint Inspection
Unit and the Office of Internal Oversight Services met on
Tuesday to enhance their cooperation. They agreed that oversight
agencies should not focus purely on punitive approach, but
should promote the concept of managers being empowered to take
responsibility for their action.
</P>

Participants agreed that the current coordination mechanisms
were working well, although there was also a need to strive
constantly to avoid overlap, while reorganizing the separate and
distinct role of the individual oversight services.

The three bodies also agreed to share information on
technological development and their impact on oversight.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Presses Japan to Broaden Deregulation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The United States said on
Thursday it would present Japan with about 270 proposals for
opening its economy in deregulation talks between the two world
economic giants on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The talks with his Japanese counterpart would cover the areas
of telecommunications, housing, pharmaceuticals, energy, Japan's
antitrust regime, retail distribution, legal and automotive
services, said Richard Fischer, U.S. deputy trade representative.
</P>
<P>
Fischer said the United States hoped the talks would yield an
agreement by the time the Group of Eight major nations meets for
their summit next year in Cologne, Germany.
</P>
<P>
"We have a great desire to have as successful an outcome by the
Cologne summit as we had with the Birmingham summit," Fischer told
a news briefing.
</P>
<P>
A first deregulation package was sealed at the G-8's last
meeting this year in Birmingham, Britain.
</P>
<P>
"There is a very strong feeling on this side of the Pacific
that these measures go hand in glove with the fiscal stimulus
measures that have taken place and the banking reforms that are
taking place in Japan," Fischer said.
</P>
<P>
Experts from both countries had already met in the last few
days to discuss the details and Fischer would meet his Japanese
counterpart, Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs Koichi Haraguchi,
on Friday.

<HEADLINE> Problems in Kosovo to be Solved Peacefully, Milutinovic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Serbian President Milan
Milutinovic said in Pristina on Thursday the accord reached with
the international community was a firm agreement to resolve
problems in Kosovo by political means.
</P>
<P>
While visiting the provincial capital, Milutinovic said the
ethnic Albanian terrorism had been defeated, "conditions have been
created to focus on political, economic, social and cultural
issues, which is evidenced by the strengthening of civilian
structures and the speedy normalization of overall circumstances
in the province," according to Tanjug news agency report.
</P>
<P>
He underlined that "It is of the utmost importance for Kosovo
and all its inhabitants that democratic, equality-based and
lasting political solutions be found as soon as possible. Courage,
determination, organization and patience are required if that is
to be achieved."
</P>
<P>
"Serbia has confirmed with its state policy and at the
diplomatic level that it is firmly committed to political means of
resolving problems in Kosovo...Serbia is absolutely ready to
defend and preserve the achieved peace and security of all its
citizens," the Serbian president added.
</P>
<P>
He underscored that remnants of terrorist gangs would not
succeed in their sporadic attempts to bring the political process
to a halt, and urged the ethnic Albanian parties to commit to
peaceful means of resolving problems.
</P>
<P>
"Terrorism cannot solve anything, and the political process
implies an immediate resumption of dialogue. We urge
representatives of ethnic-Albanian political parties to realize
that negotiations are a must," Milutinovic stressed.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the international community to allow Yugoslavia
to return to the international organizations and institutions.
</P>
<P>
If the international community truly wants to help improve
situation in Kosovo, it must be aware that the activating of the
full rights of Yugoslavia in international organizations and
institutions would constitute a major contribution to the stepping
up of the political process and the normalization of the situation
in Kosovo, to the political approach in resolving problems, and,
therefore, to the stabilization of the Balkan and southeast
European region as a whole," he said.

military engineers blew up Iraqi rockets after the war. But no
link has been established between that possible exposure and the
medical complaints.

<HEADLINE> Dow closes above 8,900 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, November 5 (Xinhua) -- U.S. stocks rebounded strongly
on Thursday, encouraged by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan's words about Lessening "investor fright".
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed 132.33 points higher to
8915.47, the first time seating above the 8900 level in three
months, according to preliminary calculations.
</P>
<P>
The Dow, seeing a six winning session streak of 417 points, was
down 68.23 points in the morning amid profit-taking. But it jumped
in the afternoon, finishing with a 1.5 percent gain which brought
the advance to nearly 550 points, or 6.6 percent, in the past
seven sessions and created the highest close since July 30.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan said on Thursday that he believed that the panic mood
in the financial markets following the contagion effects of the
Asian Financial crisis on Russia was abating.
</P>
<P>
The comment was in contrast to his assessment of the situation
before the Fed cut interest rates for the second time in less than
a month in mid October when he worried about a "fear-induced
psychological response" to Russia's woes.
</P>
<P>
The blue-chip barometer has now bounced back almost 1,500
points since plunging below 7,500 on October 8.
</P>
<P>
However, it is still 422 points, or 4.5 percent below its July
17 record high of 9,337.97.
</P>
<P>
Broader market indicators also rose, with New York Stock
Exchange composite index up 7.04 to 562.18.
</P>
<P>
Advancers beat decliners 3-2 on NYSE where trading volume
totaled 763 million shares down from 855 million previously.

<HEADLINE> Serbian Ruling Party Stresses Peaceful Solution to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The ruling Socialist Party of
Serbia (SPS) said on Thursday that Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic and the international community had reached a definitive
accord that problems in Kosovo be resolved by peaceful, political
means.
</P>
<P>
"The agreement is of a lasting, and not provisional character.
It has been endorsed by the U.N. Security Council and is
guaranteed by the whole international community," SPS spokesman
Ivica Dacic told a news conference in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
He said the agreement, reached between Milosevic and U.S. envoy
Richard Holbrooke on October 13, enabled all outstanding issues in
Kosovo to be resolved in the best possible way, by political
means, and had eliminated any possibility of military pressure on
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"The agreement has opened a possibility for a political
solution in Kosovo to be reached on the basis of the 11 agreed
points which were made public at a session of the Serbia
Government by President Milan Milutinovic," he said.
</P>
<P>
He underscored that the agreement signed by Yugoslav Foreign
Minister Zivadin Jovanovic and OSCE Chairman Bronislaw Geremek had
also been made public and that what was made public was "the only
substance of the reached accords and agreements."
</P>
<P>
Dacic said that the agreement President Milosevic has reached
with the international community was a political framework for
solving problems in Kosovo through talks between a state
delegation and representatives of the national communitee which
live in the province within the frameworks of the legal systems of
Serbia and Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
He said the agreement "has shattered all false dreams" about
the possibility of Kosovo's secession from Serbia and Yugoslavia
or the creation of some kind of a third federal unit within
Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Advises Russia on Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 5 (Xinhua) -- A senior U.S. official said
Thursday that the United States will find it harder to back
International Monetary Fund (IMF) lending for Russia if the
government prints massive amounts of new rubles.
</P>
<P>
In a speech prepared for delivery to the World Affairs Council
in Los Angeles, Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott expressed
concern Moscow may repeat past mistakes, like "the massive
printing of money."
</P>
<P>
In that case, he said, "the economic situation will probably
get worse before it gets better and we will be far less able to
help Russia through the International Monetary Fund."
</P>
<P>
According to a copy of his speech available here, Talbott
stressed "the Russians' future course is no one's choice but their
own.
</P>
<P>
Talbott is to make an even more comprehensive speech on Russia
on Friday at Stanford University. The address is expected to
contain the strongest U.S. public criticism yet of Russia's
retreat from free-market economics.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Russia unveiled a new economic plan that calls for
greater state control over the economy. It has been criticized
privately by U.S. officials and received a chilly reception from
foreign creditors.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Hails Accord to End Guinea-Bissau War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council Thursday expressed its welcome to a recent negotiated
peace agreement to end a civil war in Guinea-Bissau, the council
president, Peter Burleigh of the United States, said.
</P>
<P>
In a statement read to the press here after closed-door
consultations, Burleigh, charge d'affaires of the U.S. Mission to
the United Nations, said, "All members greatly welcomed this
achievement and commended the efforts of the ECOWAS (the Economic
Community of Western African States), the community of
Portuguese-speaking states."
</P>
<P>
The statement commended the efforts of President Yaya Jammeh,
in particular, to reach the peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council is expected to adopt a presidential
statement on the issue on Friday in a formal meeting, Burleigh
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Guinea-Bissau's government signed in Abuja, capital of Nigeria,
the peace agreement with rebels to end conflicts in the west
African country.
</P>
<P>
The pact calls for a new national unity government, including
rebel representatives, to be formed within 10 days and
presidential elections no later than March next year.
</P>
<P>
The talks began in Gambia's capital, Banjul, on Friday last
week and were moved to Abuja a day later to coincide with the
second day of a summit of the 16-member ECOWAS.
</P>
<P>
The conflict began on June 7 this year when disgruntled
military veteran seized the main army garrison and international
airport in the capital, Bissau. A ceasefire was signed in August,
but fighting broke out again earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
About half of the former Portuguese colony's 1 million people
have been displaced by the fighting.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Members Pledge Funds to Support Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 5 (Xinhua) -- More than 30 U.N.
members, mostly developing countries, have pledged funds in
support of U.N. development activities, while hoping that their
developed partners will also give more support to the U.N. system.
</P>
<P>
More countries will pledge their contributions at the on-going
1998 U.N. Pledging Conference for Development Activities here, the
U.N. Department of Public Information (DPI) said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Pledges were made by Algeria, Austria, Bangladesh, Belgium,
Benin, Bolivia, Bulgaria, China, Columbia, Cote D'Ivoire, Cuba,
Czech Republic, Ethiopia, Ghana, Greece, India, Kuwait, Lesotho,
Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Maldives, Myanmar, Netherlands,
Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Saudi Arabia, Singapore,
Switzerland, Turkey and Yemen, the DPI said.
</P>
<P>
In a statement at the conference, India's representative said
on Wednesday that the financial crisis that the U.N. faces has its
origin in non-payment of assessed contributions by some richer
industrialized members.
</P>
<P>
Unless assessed contributions are paid promptly, on time, in
full and without conditions, reforms of the U.N. will fail in
impact, the representative said.
</P>
<P>
Reductions in the funding of operational activities for
development "is yet another unfortunate dimension of the
widespread indifference to development and multilateralism among
donor countries", the representative added.
</P>
<P>
Despite a loss of over 20 billion U.S. dollars in this summers'
floods, China will do what it could to provide voluntary
contributions to U.N.funds and programs for development purposes,
said China's representative.
</P>
<P>
The past several years have seen a small but continuous
increase in China's pledged contributions.

<P>
WASHINGTON, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The Inter-American
Development Bank (IDB) Wednesday announced the approval of a 48
million U.S. dollar loan to assist Ecuador in its rehabilitation
and the reopening of main coastal roads.
</P>
<P>
The roads were damaged by heavy flooding during the climate
disruption that resulted from the 1997-1998 El Nino climate
phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
The resources will be used to help finance some 30 projects
that are needed to restore safe and minimum accessibility to about
1000 kilometers of main coastal roads.
</P>
<P>
It will also finance the preparation of studies and final
designs for highways and bridges for the permanent reconstruction
of the country's road network, as well as special studies in the
areas such as planning for emergencies, road management and
pavement design and quality control.
</P>
<P>
The IDB loan supplements 105 million dollars in financing the
Bank approved for Ecuador last year for prevention, recovery and
mitigation of the damages caused by El Nino.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Reports Rising Number of Children Used as Soldiers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The killing of civilians
and the recruitment of child soldiers are on the rise despite
worldwide campaign against this sort of human rights violations, a
U.N. official said here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Olara Otunnu, the U.N. special representative for children
and armed conflicts, cited Afghanistan, Sierra Leone and Kenya
as recent examples of brutal killings of women and children.
</P>
<P>
In Colombia, Sri Lanka, the Democratic Republic of the Congo
and Sierra Leone, children are recruited as soldiers, he told a
press conference.
</P>
<P>
"The deliberate targeting of civilian populations is on the
rise and the recruitment and use of children in combat also is
on the rise," he said.
</P>
<P>
"There is an urgent need to mobilize a major international
campaign to lean on parties in conflict to stop right now the
massive recruitment and use of children in theaters of
conflict," he said.
</P>
<P>
Otunnu cited massacres in August in Mazar-i-Sharif in
Afghanistan, where as many as 2,000 civilians from Hazara ethnic
group were murdered, raped and abducted by Taliban troops during
and after they took over the northern city.
</P>
<P>
In Sierra Leone in October, rebel forces herded 48 civilians
into a room and blew up the building. In northeast Kenya in late
October, 142 civilians, including pregnant women and children,
were killed in ethnic warfare.
</P>
<P>
Otunnu last month presented his annual report on children
and armed conflicts to the 53rd General Assembly session.

<HEADLINE> Romania Faces Serious Economic Crisis: Prime Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Romania's Prime Minister Radu
Vasile said on Thursday that the country's national economy is
confronted with a most serious crisis.
</P>
<P>
"Romania is currently undergoing a most serious economic
crisis," he told the press after government's weekly sitting.
</P>
<P>
The latest statistics proved his saying. Data provided by the
National Commission for Statistics showed that 1998 is the year of
the poorest economic performance after 1989.
</P>
<P>
Industrial output fell by 17.3 percent in the first three
quarters, due to lower production in the manufacturing sector,
piled-up stocks of finite products and lower consumption. The
trade deficit exceeded 2 billion U.S. dollars, from about 1.5
billion dollars last year, following the steady rise in imports
and diminished exports.
</P>
<P>
The periodic report on Romania released this week by the
European Commission also noted that "the macro-economic state is
obviously impairing, and the reform process in Romania is
delayed."
</P>
<P>
"The situation is worsening because of difficulties on the
capital market, as well as of the problems the European states,
particularly the ones of the ex-Soviet Union, are now facing,"
stressed the Prime Minister.
</P>
<P>
Radu Vasile estimated the tough period Romania is currently
going through will last for more three up to seven months, with
the first positive results likely to appear during the third term
of 1999.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Economy to Slow Down Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Canada's economy is not headed
for a recession despite a slowdown in growth next year, the Bank
of Montreal said in its annual economic outlook Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The Canadian economy will be driven by continued expansion in
the U.S. and a low Canadian dollar," said Tim O'Neill, chief of
the bank.
</P>
<P>
"Low long-term interest rates may also provide support to
consumer and investment spending," he was quoted as saying by a
news release.
</P>
<P>
He projects that Canada's gross domestic growth will achieve
2.1 percent in 1999, down from an anticipated rate of 2.9 percent
this year.
</P>
<P>
And the value of the Canadian dollar should remain flat in
1999, averaging 66.7 US cents by the fourth quarter of 1999
compared to an expected 66.2 US cents by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
The forecast expects the Bank of Canada to reduce interest
rates by another 25 basis points this year, lowering its Bank rate
to 5.25 percent.
</P>
<P>
"However, this (lowering rate) will still leave interest rates
up from levels that were already providing too much restraint to
the domestic economy," the economist said.
</P>
<P>
"Economic activity in the U.S. is expected to remain solid
which bodes well for Canadian exports continuing to expand. As
well, the low Canadian dollar will provide some support to the
trade sector," he added.
</P>
<P>
According to the forecast, Canada's employment growth is
projected to be 1.4 percent next year, down from an expected 2.4
percent this year.
</P>
<P>
This, combined with slower economic growth, will likely lead to
Canada's unemployment rate increasing slightly to 8.5 percent in
the year 2000.

BUCHAREST, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Romanian President Emil
Constantinescu Thursday asked the government to speed up the
reform process so as to show its ability of redressing the
national economy.
</P>
<P>
Constantinescu made the appeal at the Government's weekly
meeting, chaired by him at the invitation of Prime Minister Radu
Vasile.
</P>
<P>
"I accepted the invitation today, taking into account that the
meeting aims to resolve some very important economic and social
issues for Romania," the President said.
</P>
<P>
The President told the government "to start as quickly as
possible the restructuring and reorganization of the Finance
Ministry which is to lead the reform program, to ensure coherent
measures of collecting revenues and identify the spending."
</P>
<P>
He asked the Government to make sure the economy would bring
profit and would be efficient, to ensure the population's social
security, "when Romania is traversing a serious crisis period
which overlaps a difficult situation on the capital market
world-wide."
</P>
<P>
The President stressed that in order to meet these targets on
the redress of national economy, "a political solidarity is needed
to implement the measures."

WASHINGTON, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank Wednesday
approved an interest-free credit of 15 million U.S. dollars for an
operation to support continued economic reforms and regional
integration efforts in Burkina Faso.
</P>
<P>
At the Government's request, this one-tranche operation will
support Burkina Faso during the next year of fiscal adjustment,
while it lowers tariffs in line with the regional common export
tariff, carries out reforms in public finance, and improves the
functioning of its public administration. The credit will ensure
that funding of critical social programs in health and education
is not jeopardized.
</P>
<P>
The reforms have helped Burkina Faso increase its real GDP
growth to an average of 4.2 percent during 1994-97. To attest to
its determination to the reform progress, the Government has
completed the actions related to this credit and has already begun
to implement the reforms for 1999-2000.

<P>
MOSCOW, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Russia and the United States
failed to continue their talks on rendering American humanitarian
aid to Russia and purchasing food products in the U.S., the
Itar-Tass news agency reported early Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
The main reason for the suspension of the talks was that the
American side demanded to tax privileges for goods as services
which would be delivered to Russia within the framework of this
humanitarian aid program, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Gennady
Kulik was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Kulik is heading the Russian government delegation at the talks
in the U.S., the report said.
</P>
<P>
The American side insists that such terms were fixed in t he
protocol of 1996 signed at that time by Finance Minister of the
Russian Federation Vladimir Panskov.
</P>
<P>
Kulik stressed that Russian position is that "we will exempt
goods to be delivered as a humanitarian aid from customs duties on
the border but inside Russia the laws of the country will act."
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Russian vice-premier announced that Russia and the
U.S. have reached "all agreements" and will sign the corresponding
protocols.
</P>
<P>
Russia will be given a humanitarian aid at the size of 100,000
tons of different food products, which will be distributed mainly
through public organizations, Kulik said.

MOSCOW, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Russia intends to help
Tajikistan restore constitutional order in the troubled area of
Khodzhent in framework of existing bilateral and multi-lateral
agreements.
</P>
<P>
Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin told a
news briefing that Moscow "is ready to provide the necessary help
to Tajikistan in counteracting the armed provocation and restoring
the Constitutional order in Khodzhent."
</P>

He said a decision to take these measures is being considered,
in particular, within the framework of the 1992 agreement on
collective security.
</P>
<P>
"Russia, as Tajikistan closet ally and one of the guarantors of
implementing the inter-Tajik peace deals, firmly supports the steps
taken by the republic's leaders to counteract this armed
provocation and restore the Constitutional order in Khodzhent,"
the spokesman emphasized.
</P>

The situation in Khodzhent, northern Tajikistan, deteriorated
on Wednesday, when a 1,000-strong opposition force led by former
Soviet Colonel Makhmud Khudoiberdyev launched attacks on the
police department, the presidential guard and regional security
units located there.

alert, but are not interfering in the conflict.
</P>
<P>
After that the Tajik authorities and the armed rebels held
talks on settlement of the conflict, but the situation in
Khodzhent remains difficult on Thursday, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Turkey's Istanbul Mayor Removed From Office </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The supreme administrative court
of Turkey removed on Thursday pro-Islamic Istanbul Mayor Recep
Tayyip Erdogan from office, Turkish state-owned TRT television
reported.
</P>
<P>
The court said Erdogan could no longer serve as mayor because
of the conviction.
</P>
<P>
On September 23, Turkey's Supreme Court of Appeals upheld
the sentence of 10-month imprisonment for Erdogan.
</P>
<P>
Under the conviction, the 45-year-old Erdogan, who resigned
from the Islamist Virtue Party (FP) a week ago, would not be able
to hold an elective office for at least two years.
</P>
<P>
Erdogan was found guilty by the State Security Court in
Diyarbakir, southeast Turkey, in April "for inciting hatred based
on religious differences" in a speech at a political rally in
December last year.
</P>
<P>
"Minarets are our bayonets, domes are our helmets, mosques are
our barracks, believers are our soldiers," Erdogan said in the
rally, reading from a folk poem by nationalist poet Ziya Gokalp.
</P>
<P>
Erdogan, elected mayor four years ago on the Islamist Welfare
Party (RP) ticket, joined the FP after the RP was shut down early
this year.
</P>
<P>
Known as an orator, he was widely viewed as the person who
would eventually lead the Islamist movement in Turkey.
