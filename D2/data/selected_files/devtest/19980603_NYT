CLINTON URGES CONGRESS TO ALLOW NEW METHOD OF CENSUS COUNTING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to change dateline from Houston to Dallas and to make
corresponding adjustments in text.)  (sw) 
 By JAMES BENNET   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ President Clinton plunged into the debate over race,
politics and the U.S. Census on Tuesday, urging Congress to permit
the use of a new method for counting the population that Democrats
say is more accurate but Republicans contend is unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   The president, joining forces with other members of his party
and Census officials, contended that the 1990 Census missed whole
segments of the population, largely members of minority groups,
thereby throwing off decisions by government and business on
everything from health care to advertising. Statistical sampling,
Clinton said, would include in the count people who might be missed
by traditional techniques.
</P>
<P>
   ``An inaccurate census distorts our understanding of the needs
of our people,'' Clinton said, before sitting down in Houston with
a group of eight community leaders, activists and academics for a
discussion intended to promote sampling.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have filed suit to stop the use of sampling, arguing
that it is unconstitutional and designed to help the Democratic
Party by including more minorities, many of whom tend to vote
Democratic. Among other things, the Census helps determine how
congressional districts are drawn and so could affect which party
controls the Congress at the beginning of the next century.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever the count is, wherever the people are, this is not a
political issue,'' Clinton insisted. ``This is an American issue.''
His remarks on Tuesday were by far the most extensive Clinton has
made about sampling, and his first comments on the matter since
last year, when he promised to make the issue a high priority.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the Census Bureau have been arguing for many months
that statistical sampling would yield a far more accurate estimate
of the population than the old-fashioned head-count method, but
Clinton has said little on the subject, prompting complaints from
some Democrats. Tuesday's roundtable discussion seemed designed to
give encouragement to members of his party while putting pressure
on Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of sampling is of such importance that many who have
followed it believe it will inevitably be decided in the Supreme
Court. Politically, it is explosive. Many experts believe, for
instance, that if the 1990 Census had been adjusted to make up for
its acknowledged undercount, California would have gained yet
another congressional seat, while Wisconsin would have lost one.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, one key Republican accused Clinton of ``partisan
calculations.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather than committing himself to do the hard work necessary
to end the minority undercount,'' said Rep. Dan Miller, R-Fla., who
is chairman of the House subcommittee on the Census, ``the
president is out peddling statistical snake-oil to the public that
will add `virtual people' in some areas while deleting real people
from other areas.''
</P>
<P>
   The president downplayed partisanship, but politics was an
important part of his trip to Texas. He appeared at a
$5000-a-person lunch in Houston to raise $800,000 for congressional
Democrats, and he planned to raise another $500,000 here on Tuesday
night at a dinner for the Democratic National Committee. A handful
of protesters turned up at some of Clinton's appearances on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The new sampling approach advocated by Clinton would still rely
on the techniques the Census Bureau has used since 1970, mailing
out questionaires to the population as well as knocking on doors.
But instead of trying to count everyone, the bureau proposes to
count people in 90 percent of the households in each census tract,
a neighborhood of about 1,700 homes.
</P>
<P>
   Bureau statisticians would use those figures to try to determine
the number of people in the tract who had not been physically
counted. The bureau would check the results by conducting a survey
of 750,000 households nationwide and adjusting the total if
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed approach was developed by the Census Bureau after
the 1990 Census, which cost $2.6 billion, a huge increase over
previous surveys. The bureau later determined that it had missed
8.4 million people and double-counted 4.4 million others.
Nationally, the Census Bureau estimates that it undercounted the
population by 1.8 percent, a margin of error that the Clinton
administration argues sampling would reduce to 0.1 point.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans vehemently object to sampling. They say that it
violates the Constitution, which calls for an ``actual
enumeration'' every 10 years, and that it is much too complex to be
accurate.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Mallett, the deputy commerce secretary, said that the 2000
census was expected to cost $4.2 billion. Without sampling, he
said, it will cost far more, because the government will have to
hire at least 100,000 more ``enumerators'' _ beyond the 260,000 now
planned _ to count the population.

'97 BALKS BRING OUT '98 BUCKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PATRICK HIPES  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It was just about this time last year that Jeff
Weaver and Seth Etherton were deciding whether or not to leave
school early and play professional baseball. After the first round
of Major League Baseball's amateur draft Monday, both were glad
they stuck around.
</P>
<P>
   Weaver, the former Simi Valley High right-hander who led the
nation in strikeouts at Fresno State in 1997, was selected with the
14th overall pick by the Detroit Tigers, a spot that could solidify
the hard-throwing All-American a seven-figure signing bonus.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tough decision last year,'' said Weaver, who was 10-4
with a 2.98 ERA and 156 strikeouts for the Bulldogs this season.
``But you have to know deep down you have the ability and desire to
better yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Etherton, who saw both his velocity and stock rise markedly
after turning down a St. Louis Cardinals offer last season, went
surprisingly high at No.18 overall to the Angels. Edison Field is
25 minutes from the All-American's Dana Point home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very shocked,'' said Etherton, the Pacific-10
Conference' all-time strikeout leader who is 11-3 with a 2.77 ERA
with the Trojans _ still alive in the College World Series. ``It's
been a lifelong dream to stay home and play for the Angels. I
couldn't have wished for anything more.''
</P>
<P>
   The two right-handers' good fortune were highlights in an
interesting first day of the draft, considered deep this season by
most experts.
</P>
<P>
   As expected, Philadelphia used the first pick to select
University of Miami third baseman Pat Burrell. The first high
school player taken, outfielder Corey Patterson (Harrison High in
Kennesaw, Ga.) went to the Chicago Cubs with the third pick. Long
Beach Wilson third baseman Sean Burroughs, the son of former
American League MVP Jeff Burroughs, went No.9 to San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   J.D. Drew, who with agent Scott Boras held out for an $11
million signing bonus from the Phillies a year ago, went at No.5 to
St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, you've got to step up and take a risk,'' Cardinals
general manager Walt Jocketty said. ``We're going to give it our
best shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Boras also represents Weaver.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA outfielder Eric Valent, thought to be a first-round choice
of either the Dodgers, Yankees or Mariners, fell to the Phillies at
No.42 pick in a supplemental round.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a feeling I'd go higher,'' said Valent, who had 30 home
runs this season to break the all-time Pac-10 record. ``(The
Phillies) said they couldn't believe they got me.''
</P>
<P>
   Barry Zito, the gifted left-hander who left UC Santa Barbara
last season for Pierce College, was taken in the third round (83rd
overall) by Texas, one of several local pitchers coveted at the
next level. Former Quartz Hill High ace Darrell Hussman was
Cincinnati's fourth-round selection.
</P>
<P>
   Cal State Northridge left-hander Carey Novits was the only
Matador chosen on the first day, going in the 22nd round to
Cleveland. More visible teammates Nakia Hill and Darren Dyt were
bypassed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think I was going to sign,'' said Novits, who planned
to quit baseball before CSUN's program was cut last summer. ``I
don't think anybody expected it.''
</P>
<P>
   The top local high school player taken was Newbury Park
outfielder Barry Tolli, a .386 hitter with power taken by Detroit
in the eighth round. Monroe High teammates Victor Hall (12th round,
Arizona) and John Ennis (14th round, Atlanta) followed. Thousand
Oaks High left-hander Ryan Earl was a 22nd-round pick of the
Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, highly regarded players like Highland's Traviss
Hodge and El Camino Real's Woody Cliffords went undrafted through
the first 25 rounds. The final 25 rounds will be completed today.

FINAL ARRANGEMENTS FOR GOLDWATER'S ASHES UNCERTAIN
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS MOESER 
 and BETTY REID 
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Barry Goldwater's body will be
cremated after his funeral service Wednesday, but it's still
unclear what the family will do with his remains.
</P>
<P>
   Family members gave conflicting reports about arrangements for
Goldwater's ashes, but it appears likely that the remains eve
ntually will be scattered in the Grand Canyon. The ashes would be
left where the crystalline waters of the Colorado River meet the
muddy waters of the Little Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   That was Goldwater's favorite spot on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Goldwate r, Goldwater's widow, on Tuesday told Bill
Shover, director of public affairs for The Arizona Republic, that
the ashes would be scattered near the two rivers.
</P>
<P>
   But Joanne Goldwater, the sena tor's daughter, and Bob
Goldwater, his broth er, said no plans had been made.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Goldwater, who will deliver the eulogy at the service today,
said his brother always wanted the Grand Canyon to be his final
resting place. But no plans have been made, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody's saying we're going to be scattering anything,''
Goldwater said. ``I do know that Barry would have liked that. He
loved the Grand Canyon. But we don't want to do anything to upset
people.''
</P>
<P>
   As news reports leaked out Tues day about the p lan, that's
exactly what happened.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. James Henderson, D-Window Rock, issued a statement
saying the Navajo Nation opposed plans to scatter the ashes. Hender
son is running for president of the Navajo Nation.
</P>
<P>
   But George J oe, a Navajo Nation spokesman, disputed the
statement, saying the tribe had taken no position.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all speculation at this point,'' Joe said. ``The Navajo
Nation and the Goldwater family have had a long tradition. Anything
that wo uld happen, we would work with them.''
</P>
<P>
   To scatter ashes in the Canyon would be contrary to traditional
Navajo philosophy about death. Navajos believe that when a person
dies, the corpse enters the realm of an evil world and has the pow
er to haunt the living and inflict physical and mental pain on
them.
</P>
<P>
   It is their belief that the Holy People, known as Wind People
and Water People, live in the Canyon.
</P>
<P>
   During journeys to the confluence of the rivers, traditional
</P>
<P>
   Navajos bring corn pollen, sprinkle it into the Canyon and pray
that they might achieve ``hozho,'' a state of beauty and harmony.
</P>
<P>
   Navajos make a claim that the western boundaries of the Navajo
Reservation are defined by the Colorado
</P>
<P>
   River.
</P>
<P>
   There remain hard feelings among some Navajos toward Gold water
because he sided with the Hopi Nation during a land dispute while
he was in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Taylor Jr., the chairman of the Hopi Nation, was traveling
and
could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Grand Canyon officials say that each year, 20 to 30 people ask
to scatter remains in the Canyon.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Mengel, a park ranger who oversees the requests, said
remains are required to be scattered a way from public areas and
water, which could complicate a plan to scatter Goldwater's ashes
near the rivers. Mengel said families often sprinkle remains over
the Canyon by aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   The Goldwater family has not contacted park officials
</P>
<P>
   about a permit, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they do, we would be more than happy to help them,'' Mengel
said. &QL;

PITCHING'S SAD STATE BAFFLING FOR RANGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By GIL LeBRETON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On a sultry summer's night nearly three years ago, baseball fans
at The Ballpark in Arlington witnessed a matchup of the two best
pitchers in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Johnson and Hideo Nomo were more than All-Stars that week.
They were marquee superstars. The toasts of the All-Star Week
papparazzi.
</P>
<P>
   They looked like they were going to dominate baseball straight
into the next millennium.
</P>
<P>
   But, oops. Will the last one headed for the airport please turn
out the lights?
</P>
<P>
   With Johnson expected to be on his way out of Seattle and Nomo's
days in Los Angeles now officially numbered, the numbing state of
big-league starting pitching is being underscored again.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers general manager Doug Melvin confirmed yesterday that he
has talked to the Los Angeles Dodgers about acquiring Nomo, the
National League starter that 1995 night.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason I called is to find what they're looking for,''
Melvin said, ``whether they were looking to do something for
prospects or for major-league players.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers, Melvin learned, want players. Maybe they'll get
back to Melvin. Maybe not.
</P>
<P>
   There are indications that the Dodgers already are close to
finalizing a deal for Nomo. At least two general managers have
talked to the club and come away with that impression.
</P>
<P>
   But as the Randy Johnson Factory Liquidation Sale has reminded
us, closing a trade for a starting pitcher is not the same deal as
reporting about one.
</P>
<P>
   The American League standings today show the Rangers
quasi-solidly atop the Western Division. But how can this be, when
three-fifths of their starting rotation keeps turning the manager
gray?
</P>
<P>
   Collectively, Darren Oliver, John Burkett and Bobby Witt are
averaging seven earned runs and 12 boxes of Rolaids every nine
innings.
</P>
<P>
   They need a Hideo Nomo, even a struggling, lost-all-confidence,
can't-control-his-sinker Nomo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do have two guys pitching pretty well in Triple A,'' Melvin
said, noting the minor-league work of Matt Perisho and Todd Van
Poppel. ``Todd had an outstanding game (Monday) night _ 13 ground
balls, seven strikeouts, no walks. He threw the ball real well.''
</P>
<P>
   But Melvin has repeatedly said that the organization would
prefer to nurture their prospects carefully, letting them earn
success at each level, before calling them up to the big club.
</P>
<P>
   ``It depends,'' Melvin said yesterday. ``I think it depends on
how these guys go up here.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have a veteran player, you're limited in what you can
do, too. You keep giving them the ball, and hope things work out.''
</P>
<P>
   Veteran pitchers, in other words, have no-trade clauses and few,
if any, options. The pitcher's success may be a faint memory _ but
at least it's success.
</P>
<P>
   Take Nomo. Statistically, he has not been the same since being
struck in the elbow by a Scott Rolen line drive last July. The
injury required off-season surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Dodger-watchers say that Nomo has had trouble controlling his
once-diabolical sinker. He has fallen behind National League
hitters and, no longer mesmerized by his whirling delivery, they've
been able to sit and wait on his flat fastball.
</P>
<P>
   The same critics point to Nomo's record. His earned-run average
is up 1.92 runs since the injury, and his hits allowed have climbed
1.4 per game.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like a diamond in the rough to me.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles just bestowed a multiyear, $6 million-per-season
contract on Scott Erickson, whose hits-per-nine-inning ratio is
nearly the highest in the league. The Indians did the same for
Charles Nagy, who has been allowing home runs at a near McGwire-ian
pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times clubs get upset at young pitchers struggling,''
Melvin said. ``They always say, `When are they going to learn? When
are they going to develop?
</P>
<P>
   ``But we're not the only club whose veteran pitching is
struggling. I think you can take a look at the veteran pitchers,
and there's a whole list of veteran guys that are sitting on 5.00
and 6.00 ERAs.''
</P>
<P>
   Melvin sighed, sounding like a guy who doesn't expect to get any
you-won-the-Nomo-lottery phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``When league leaders in hits and home runs allowed get contract
extensions,'' Melvin wondered aloud, ``where's our pitching coming
to?''
</P>
<P>
   If the Dodgers call, therefore, what would Melvin be willing to
offer? Roberto Kelly, remember, is on the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   Rusty Greer? Ouch. The Dodgers dearly yearn for a left fielder.
But for more reasons than his batting average, the Rangers wouldn't
do it.
</P>
<P>
   The one intriguing player that Melvin could relinquish is center
fielder Tom Goodwin. But it would be difficult. Goodwin has been
the Rangers' second-biggest surprise (behind Aaron Sele), with his
patience at the plate and his defense.
</P>
<P>
   With Kelly out, however, who'd play center?
</P>
<P>
   It is only June, Melvin reminded yesterday. Things happen. A
good starting pitcher _ even a one-time All-Star pitcher _ might
fall from the sky.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, right. And I'm Randy Johnson.

ALABAMA GOVERNOR FORCED INTO RUNOFF 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By KEVIN SACK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTGOMERY, Ala. _ Gov. Fob James Jr. of Alabama, a
party-switching Republican whose fervid support for school prayer
has made him a national icon for religious conservatives, was
forced into a runoff in the gubernatorial primary here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Although he finished first in a five-candidate field, James, 63,
failed to win a majority and will face Winton Blount III, a
Montgomery businessman and longtime Republican loyalist, in the
runoff on June 30.
</P>
<P>
   James, who is running for reelection to his third term _ he
served the first as a Democrat from 1979 to 1983 _ nearly avoided
the runoff with a late surge as he moved steadily toward the 50
percent threshhold in the final week of campaigning. But the same
dissatisfaction that lured four Republican opponents to challenge
the incumbent apparently unsettled just enough voters to deny James
a first-round victory.
</P>
<P>
   James and Blount now face the arduous task of turning out their
voters for a midsummer runoff and competing for the support of the
three other Republican contenders.
</P>
<P>
   With 87 percent of the precincts reporting, James had 48 percent
of the vote, while Blount finished second with 41 percent. Former
Gov. Guy Hunt, who decided to run after being pardoned of the state
ethics conviction that forced his resignation in 1993, finished
third with 8 percent of the vote. Two other candidates, Lewis
Leslie McAllister Jr., a Tuscaloosa businessman, and Phillip
Williams, a former state finance director, shared the rest of the
vote.
</P>
<P>
   In the Democratic primary, Lt. Gov. Don Siegelman easily
defeated his top rival, Lenora Pate, a Birmingham lawyer. Siegelman
enters the general election with more than $3.5 million in his
campaign treasury, a team of experienced Democratic strategists and
an eye-catching policy proposal borrowed from the popular
Democratic governor of a neighboring state, Zell Miller of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Siegelman has pledged to push for a state lottery to finance
college scholarships, pre-kindergarten programs and school
construction. That plan is sure to strike a chord with Alabamians
desperate to improve the quality of the state's educational system.
But, as was the case in Georgia, it has already stirred opposition
from religious conservatives who view the lottery as a first step
toward the legalization of other forms of gambling. The Republicans
also plan to portray Siegelman as an unreconstructed liberal and a
captive of the state's trial lawyers' lobby.
</P>
<P>
   In neighboring Mississippi, meanwhile, voters in the Democratic
and Republican primaries selected congressional candidates who will
vie in the general election in November. The most closely watched
race came in the 4th District in southwestern Mississippi, where a
large field of candidates from both parties competed to succeed
Rep. Mike Parker, a Republican who is retiring after five terms.
</P>
<P>
   On the Republican side, Delbert Hosemann, a Jackson lawyer, and
Phil Davis, a banker from Magee, finished first and second
respectively in a nine-candidate field, forcing a runoff on June
23. In the Democratic primary, Ronnie Shows, a regional
commissioner for the state transportation department, won a
majority in his campaign against two opponents.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Alabama gubernatorial race has been depicted by James'
strategists and by national leaders of the Christian conservative
movement as an important electoral test for the religious right.
</P>
<P>
   During the last 16 months, James has taken a number of
provocative stands aimed at returning religious expression to
public schools and courtrooms, a mission with substantial grass
roots support in this deeply devout, conservative and populist
state. In each instance, James has assailed the federal courts as
the mortal foe of God-fearing Alabamians, a tactic used by his
predecessor, George Wallace, when this state's deep-seated
resentment of federal intrusion was stoked more by race than by
religion.
</P>
<P>
   The governor has threatened to call out the National Guard to
defend the right of a state judge in Gadsden, Ala., to display the
Ten Commandments on his courtroom wall. He also has waged an
aggressive campaign to defend a 1993 state law that permitted
voluntary, student-led prayer in the schools. A federal judge
rejected the law as unconstitutional, leading James to assert that
the Bill of Rights does not apply to the states and that state
officials need not obey Supreme Court rulings when they believe
that the high court has overstepped its authority.
</P>
<P>
   Those positions, and the perception that James has placed more
emphasis on school prayer than on economic development and
education, quickly alienated some of the state's business leaders,
who rallied around the candidacy of Blount, a longtime Republican
activist who owns car dealerships and other companies. Blount,
whose father was postmaster general in the Nixon administration,
finished third in the 1994 gubernatorial primary.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Blount has attacked James for raising taxes
during his first term as governor, and for profiting from a
family-owned landfill that does business with the state. All of the
state's major newspapers endorsed Blount, and his strategists hoped
that Hunt, a Primitive Baptist preacher, would siphon Christian
conservative votes from James.
</P>
<P>
   But Blount's momentum seemed to stall in the final week of the
campaign, as Alabamians focused on the race and moved toward James,
whose son, Forrest James III, was quoted in the Birmingham News
this week as describing his father as ``a God-fearing redneck.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last week of the race, James promoted his pledge not to
raise taxes, a promise that Blount rejected as irresponsible. And
James, who counts Ralph Reed, the former director of the Christian
Coalition, as a consultant, won endorsements from many of the
country's Christian conservative leaders, including Pat Robertson,
Jerry Falwell, Phyllis Schlafly, James Dobson and Donald Wildmon.

   One poll published on Sunday found that 56 percent of those who
believe the Bible is literally true said they would vote for James.

TEXAS WOMEN AIM TO END LSU STREAK IN NCAA OUTDOOR CHAMPIONSHIPS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By ANDY FRIEDLANDER 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1986, Texas won the NCAA outdoor championship in women's
track and field.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, there has been only frustration _ and only Louisiana
State.
</P>
<P>
   In the 11 NCAA outdoor meets since '86, the Longhorns have
finished second four times, including three of the past four years.
LSU, anchored by its dominant sprint corps, won them all.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it appears to be Texas' turn again. The Longhorns, who lost
to LSU by one heartbreaking point last year, head into the opening
session of the 1998 NCAA outdoor championships today in Buffalo,
N.Y., with the speed and depth to derail the LSU dynasty.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Longhorns, TCU's men are seeking redemption from '97,
when the favored Horned Frogs dropped the baton in the 4x100
meters. The '98 Frogs come to Buffalo with the nation's fastest
sprinter in Percy Spencer and the No. 2-ranked relay team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year was a bitter pill to swallow, but it made us a
better team this year,'' said Texas women's coach Bev Kearney, who
a year ago watched LSU roar from behind with 43 points on the
meet's final day to win 63-62. ``This year, we have enough
firepower to win.''
</P>
<P>
   The Longhorns proved that with an awesome display of sprint
might at the Big 12 Championships two weeks ago. Entering the
meet's final day, Texas had not scored a point. When the afternoon
ended, the Longhorns had exploded for 151 points, taking first and
second in the 400 meters, the first three places in the 100 and the
first four in the 200.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Longhorns won't match that feat Saturday, the last
day of the NCAA meet, they are expected to score big in every
sprint event, led by LaKeisha Backus, Angie Vaughn, Suziann Reid,
Toya Brown and the 4x100- and 4x400-meter relays.
</P>
<P>
   LSU, meanwhile, has fallen considerably since last year, in part
because the Tigers are missing Astia Walker, who scored 28 points
by winning the 100-meter hurdles, finishing second in the 200 and
leading off the national champion 4x100 team. Walker was ruled
ineligible for the outdoor season after it was discovered that she
ran in a meet as a sophomore at Riverside (Calif.) Junior College.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if we have the personnel to win the
championship,'' LSU coach Pat Henry said. ``Emotions are a big part
of track and field. Emotionally, you have to have the right things
happen. If you get on a roll, you can hit it.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas hit it in March, ending LSU's string of five consecutive
NCAA indoor titles with a victory in Indianapolis. To follow that
with an outdoor crown, Texas must outscore high-powered UCLA, which
will be hurt by nagging injuries to hurdler Joanna Hayes, and
Brigham Young, led by versatile Tiffany Lott. Both those teams are
capable of making a charge.
</P>
<P>
   TCU's men seemed to have a chance to make a title run, but coach
Monte Stratton took the conservative route with his star, Spencer,
entering him in the 100 but not the 200, in which he placed second
last year. That leaves the Frogs with enough potential points to
climb into the top five, but not enough for a realistic shot at the
team championship.
</P>
<P>
   Arkansas, with its strength in the distance events and jumps, is
a heavy favorite to win its eighth consecutive men's outdoor title.
Arizona, LSU and Clemson are other top contenders.
</P>
<P>
   Stratton said the decision not to double Spencer was made in
part because the senior from Jamaica was behind in conditioning
because of an early season injury and in part to give him a better
chance to win the 100, in which he is the No. 1 seed with a best
time of 9.96.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no easy races at the NCAA meet,'' Stratton said.
``If he doubled, he'd have to run six rounds of sprints and two of
relays against the highest level of competition in four days.
That's not to say he couldn't do it, but it would be very
difficult, and we prefer to take the cautious approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd rather do one thing exceptionally well than a lot of
things pretty good, and risk blowing up.''
</P>
<P>
   Stratton knows about that, having watched the Frogs
self-destruct last year in the NCAA 4x100 relay preliminaries,
dropping the baton before Spencer touched it.
</P>
<P>
   This year the Frogs, whose qualifying time of 38.71 is .02
behind No. 1 LSU, are again one of the teams to beat in the relay,
with Bryan Howard, Jarmiene Holloway and Syan Williams joining
Spencer. Spencer, Holloway and Howard could score in the 100, and
Williams is ranked fourth in the 200.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Khadevis Robinson's 1:46.06, the third-fastest 800
time in the nation, makes him dangerous in a race that includes big
names Seneca Lassiter and David Krummenacker. He will also anchor
the fourth-ranked 4x400 relay team.

RED SOX ROUT BLUE JAYS, STAY ON UPSWING 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-BLUE JAYS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ By any measure, this was not your typical
businessman's junket.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox, who left town last week with spirits scraping the
sidewalk on Yawkey Way, bottomed out in the belly of the beast in
the Bronx, overnighted on an airplane grounded by a divine light
show, then stumbled without sleep into an outbreak of Dennis Rodman
disease here.
</P>
<P>
   Who could have blamed the Sons of Jimy Williams if they'd made a
bonfire out of their boarding passes?
</P>
<P>
   And yet Tuesday night the Red Sox returned to the sweet embrace
of home jauntier than ever, sounding as if they'd just spent the
last two nights in Tahiti instead of Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   What could have been the trip from hell, especially when their
season-worst losing streak stretched to six games after their first
two nights in New York, instead was salvaged by four straight wins,
including Tuesday night's 11-3 victory over the Blue (and
Orange-Blond) Jays.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we go out and believe in ourselves and play the way we're
capable of, we can play with anybody,'' said Mo Vaughn, who was a
bit player in this one with an RBI double in the ninth but whose
cameo tirade Sunday in New York might have had a carryover effect.
``I'm not surprised we got ourselves some wins. I knew we could
play like this. That's why I reacted the way I did Sunday, to put
that into effect. I know we're capable. The key is the guys have to
know they can do it, too.''
</P>
<P>
   With lefthander Steve Avery unveiling a streamlined delivery and
Rich Garces flaunting his same XXL form, the Red Sox completed a
two-game sweep by hitting three home runs, including a three-run
jump starter by Nomar Garciaparra in the third and a three-run
nightcap by Darren Bragg in the eighth. The other, Troy O'Leary's
13th of the season, touched off a five-run rally in the eighth,
which all took place after two were out.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's tormentors _ the Blue Jays beat the Red Sox twice in
Fenway Park _ became this week's toast, if you don't mind peroxide
instead of jelly.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox, 9-5 winners Monday on a four-run ninth-inning
rally, scored six runs in the last two innings Tuesday night and
outscored the Blue Jays, 20-8, in the two-game set.
</P>
<P>
   While all that offense has been nice, and John Valentin threw
his glove into the mix, robbing Jose Canseco of extra bases with a
diving stop with the game still close in the fifth, the secret to
the Red Sox' road show revival was easy to detect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two words,'' reliever Jim Corsi said. ``Starting pitching. I
rest my case.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Sox left town last week, their starting pitching had
begun to look shabbier than Willy Loman's suitcase.
</P>
<P>
   But then Bret Saberhagen went out and stood down the Yankees
last Saturday, and suddenly, there was new life not only in his
artificial shoulder but in the rest of the rotation as well. Pedro
Martinez won the next day, Tim Wakefield held the Blue Jays to four
hits in six innings Monday, and Tuesday it was Avery's turn to
claim rebirth.
</P>
<P>
   Abandoning the straight overhand style that had made him a
playoff MVP at the age of 21, Avery dropped his arm down to a much
lower angle, something he first tried just four days earlier in a
practice session in New York. It wasn't entirely an artistic
success _ Avery walked six Blue Jays in five innings _ but he
allowed just three hits and three runs and emerged with his second
win of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ball had a little better movement, my delivery was a
little more deceiving, and my velocity was up,'' said Avery.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the most part, I was a little timid and nervous, trying
something new. At times, I was afraid to let it go. I told
(pitching coach Joe Kerrigan) as we were walking in from the
bullpen, `Joe, are you sure we want to do this?'''
</P>
<P>
   With Kerrigan's encouragement, and an unexpected assist from
Canseco, who twice was picked off first by Avery, the lefthander
took the plunge.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's inconsistent, as you might expect,'' Kerrigan said, ``and
there's a lot more work to do, but it looks like we've finally got
a place to go: forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Garces is looking anywhere but back. El Guapo (The
Handsome One), as he was nicknamed by teammates, is an easy target
because of his girth.
</P>
<P>
   But Garces, who relieved Avery, pitched a 1-2-3 sixth, then
pitched out of a first-and-third, no-out jam in the seventh by
striking out Jose Cruz and Shannon Stewart, then retiring Canseco
on a ground ball. He has not been scored upon in eight of his last
nine appearances.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can call me whatever they want,'' said Garces. ``As long
as I go out and do my job, they can call me whatever they want to
call me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a name: Richard Garces. El Guapo? That's OK, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Take it from a teammate who also has been accused of being fat.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can talk about size all you want,'' Vaughn said. ``It's
what you do on the field. And the kid has got a big heart.''

DODGERS SINGING OF CROSBY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Bubba Crosby, a power-hitting outfielder from Rice
University in Houston, was selected by the Los Angeles Dodgers on
Tuesday in the first round of the Major League Baseball amateur
draft.
</P>
<P>
   Crosby, who returned from an early-season hamstring injury to
bat .394 with 25 homers and 91 RBI in 58 games, has been labeled by
some scouts as the most well-rounded player in the draft.
</P>
<P>
   Crosby, 21, was taken with the 23rd selection overall. He is an
All-American selection of The Sporting News, Baseball America and
Baseball Weekly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really nervous this morning,'' said Crosby, who will be
represented by the Houston-based Hendricks brothers. ``We were
listening to the draft on the Internet and we were just looking for
the name Crosby. It was a cherished moment. I can't really explain
the feeling. I know I'm not in the big leagues yet, but this is the
first step.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers like Crosby's power but are more impressed with his
all-around skill.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think he could start at Single-A,'' Dodgers scouting
director Terry Reynolds said. ``He plays solid defense and runs
well. He adds up to a solid player. He brings all the intangibles
to the ballpark everyday.''
</P>
<P>
   __ McGwire out: Cardinals slugger Mark McGwire, who leads the
majors with 27 homers, will miss all three games of the Dodgers
series after suffering back spasms Monday night in San Diego. He
will not even take batting practice.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire said his back condition is not serious, but rest is the
best treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know my back like the back of my hand,'' said McGwire, who
missed playing time several years ago with lower-back pain. ``There
is no reason to push it. I'll be back soon.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Reyes in: At 5 p.m. Tuesday, Dennis Reyes didn't know what
the future held. He was told he would replace Hideo Nomo in the
Dodgers' rotation on Monday after Nomo was taken off the roster.
</P>
<P>
   That meant starting Friday night in Seattle. But then he was
told the Dodgers' negotiations with Mariners left-hander Randy
Johnson might change the day of his start.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was all pretty weird,'' Reyes said. ``Nothing was
certain.''
</P>
<P>
   Reyes is coming off a weird outing Friday night against
Cincinnati. He came on in relief after Scott Radinsky blew a
ninth-inning lead. He retired the first eight batters he faced then
gave up five straight hits in the 12th and lost 8-4.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers are confident, however, that Reyes can make the
transition to the starting rotation. He started the season at
Triple-A Albuquerque after pitching poorly this spring. He was
recalled after posting a 1.69 ERA in 18 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned a lot about concentration and focus down there,''
Reyes said. ``I kind of lost that during spring training. I'd be
out on the mound and let things get to me. Going to Albuquerque
helped me get that back.''

COWBOYS STUDY OPTIONS AT DEFENSIVE END
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ With Tony Tolbert's status still unclear, the
Cowboys offered a glimpse of their defensive-end plans without the
former Pro Bowler yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Kavika Pittman started at one end while first-round draft pick
Greg Ellis and veteran Hurvin McCormack alternated at the other the
first day of the team's final minicamp at the Valley Ranch training
complex.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys coach Chan Gailey said he considers Tolbert part of the
plans for next season _ though he said things could change,
considering Tolbert's salary and health.
</P>
<P>
   Tolbert, who will count $3,447,000 against the Cowboys' cap next
season, recently had surgery on both knees. It is uncertain whether
he will return. If he does, the Cowboys hope to sign him to reduced
contract. He also could retire or be released.
</P>
<P>
   ``So much depends on his knees, his feelings and where we are as
a team,'' Gailey said. ``There is so much going on there. Only time
will tell.''
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys defensive coordinator Dave Campo said the team can be
successful with Pittman, who recorded 11 tackles and one sack the
past two seasons combined, the rookie Ellis and McCormack, a former
tackle.
</P>
<P>
   His confidence is rooted in a defensive philosophy change that
he said maximizes the ability of that group while lessening the
impact of not having a Pro Bowl-caliber player at the position.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of having a definite right and left end as in the past,
the ends will change sides depending on the offense and defensive
call. Pittman plays rush end and will go to the weak side, while
McCormack and Ellis play the strong side, which will usually be on
the side of the tight end.
</P>
<P>
   McCormack and Pittman said they like the change. They said it
will allow them to blossom into productive players.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's better for me,'' Pittman said. ``I'm in open space and
I'm not cluttered up. I'm not a big guy or the strongest guy. But
I'm fast and quick. This gives me an opportunity to use it.''
</P>
<P>
   McCormack, who flip-flopped between end and tackle the past four
years, said he plans to battle Ellis for the starting job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Starting is my goal,'' McCormack said. ``It's definitely a
competitive state right now with the first-rounder. But I'm
comfortable with the position change. It suits my skills. I'm ready
to compete.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellis, however, said he understands that most of the pressure
and the spotlight will be on him, thanks to his draft position.
</P>
<P>
   ``Starting is realistic for me because of the coaching staff and
the owner,'' Ellis said. ``I think they drafted me to start. They
are not going to waste the eighth pick in the draft on somebody who
is not going to start and play a whole lot.'' &QL; 
BRIEFLY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gailey said the Cowboys are deciding whether safety Bill Bates
and running back Herschel Walker fit into their plans for 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys got a surprise at practice when former coach Barry
Switzer made a cameo appearance. Switzer talked briefly about his
blossoming film career. Switzer has filmed one movie and is being
courted by Oliver Stone for a part in an upcoming movie about
professional football.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie linebacker Darren Hambrick missed the afternoon workout
for personal reasons. Gailey said Hambrick should be back at
practice today.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Tolbert, cornerback Deion Sanders (ankle) and
receiver Macey Brooks (groin muscle) missed practice because of
injuries. Sanders is not expected back until training camp, while
Brooks is day-to-day.

USC OUSTS MISSISSIPPI STATE
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   OMAHA, Neb. _ USC freshman right-hander Rik Currier, who was
knocked early in his first start in the regional tournament, hurled
the Trojans into a rematch with powerhouse Louisiana State by
beating Mississippi State, 7-1, Tuesday night in the College World
Series.
</P>
<P>
   Currier gave up just four hits - two the first seven innings -
and struck out 12 to eliminate Mississippi State and leave just
four teams in the CWS, three of them from the West: USC, Long Beach
State and Arizona State.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth club is two-time defending champion LSU, which
outslugged USC in the first round, 12-10. The Trojans and Tigers
will meet again Thursday at 12:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Right fielder Brad Ticehurst slugged two homers, the sixth and
seventh of the Series for the Trojans, who pounded out a dozen hits
and, after three games, are the No. 1-hitting team, average-wise,
in the tournament, at .352.
</P>
<P>
   But, as Mississippi State coach Pat McMahon, pointed out, it was
the work of Currier that was the difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had such a well-pitched game, he made it difficult for
us,'' said McMahon, whose club finished its season 42-23.
</P>
<P>
   Or, as the Bulldogs' shortstop Brad Freeman, said, ``He was
nasty. He would have shut down a lot of teams tonight. He's a good
one. You've just got to tip your hat to him.''
</P>
<P>
   USC coach Mike Gillespie was quick to note how vital it was for
Currier to give the Trojans some quality innings after Monday
night's 11-inning, 12-10 marathon victory over Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some guys who might have normally been available were not,''
Gillespie said, ``so this was an extremely important game for us.''
</P>
<P>
   It helped, too, that the Trojans provided Currier a quick lead,
going in front, 4-0, after only three innings.
</P>
<P>
   Ticehurst hit the first of his two homers to lead off the
Trojans' second. Jason Lane then ripped the glove off the hand of
Mississippi State hurler Mark Freed with a single to center. Jeremy
Freitas walked, and Seth Davidson bunted for a single to fill the
bases with nobody out.
</P>
<P>
   Wes Rachels drove in Lane with a sacrifice fly, then, with two
outs, Robb Gorr singled home Freitas for a 3-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   In the third, Ticehurst again led off with an homer, his 17th of
the season. Ticehurst wasn't so sure about this one, which bounded
out of the right-center seats after a fan apparently got a hand on
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hit it well,'' he said, ``but I saw it come back on the
field. I thought I had a triple.'' He was promptly waved home.
</P>
<P>
   In the seventh, USC (46-17) scored twice more to take a 6-0
lead. Ticehurst was hit by a pitch, was balked to second, then Lane
doubled him home. Lane scored on Freitas' run-scoring single.
</P>
<P>
   Currier lost his bid for his first shutout - and first at the
CWS since two Cal State Fullerton pitchers combined for one three
years ago - in the bottom of the eighth. Brad Freeman's two-out
double drove in Brian Wiese, who had beat out an infield single to
third.
</P>
<P>
   Lane had three of the Trojans' 12 hits, and Gorr, Davidson and
Ticehurst each had two.
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Eric Munson said it was tough coming back after the long
game the night before, saying: ``It's tough after a long, tiring
game not to have a letdown. It's human nature. But we were able to
step up to the challenge, and we came out ready to play.''

CALIFORNIANS APPROVE MEASURE TO CURTAIL BILINGUAL EDUCATION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: The following is now the lead story on The New York Times
front page.) (sw) 
 By TODD S. PURDUM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Californians decisively approved a ballot measure
on Tuesday that would curtail three decades of bilingual
instruction in the public schools here, paving the way for similar
assaults on such programs around the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Majorities of every major ethnic and racial group _ blacks,
whites and Hispanics _ expressed support in public opinion polls
for the measure to effectively end bilingual education, though most
Hispanic elected officials and all the major candidates for
governor in both parties opposed it.
</P>
<P>
   The measure was sponsored by Ron Unz, a multimillionaire
software entrepreneur from Silicon Valley who ran unsuccessfully
for the Republican nomination for governor four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Unz financed the petition drive to qualify the measure for the
ballot with his own fortune. In doing so he tapped into widespread
dissatisfaction among parents, politicians and educators who
believed that existing bilingual education programs, a legacy of
the civil rights movement of the 1960s in which students are taught
basic subjects in their native language while they also learn
English, were not working well to prepare a huge new generation of
immigrant students for the job market.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Gov. Gray Davis, a 23-year veteran of state politics, rode a
wave of support from traditional liberal constituencies to soundly
defeat his richer, self-financed rivals for the Democratic
gubernatorial nomination, Rep. Jane Harman and Al Checchi, a
multimillionaire businessman who spent some $40 million on his
campaign, the all-time individual record for any non-presidential
candidate in American history.
</P>
<P>
   Davis will now take on the Republican state attorney general,
Dan Lungren, who faced only token opposition on Tuesday in the
state's new blanket primary in which the names of all candidates
appeared on the same ballot regardless of party, but who ran behind
Davis. They will compete for the right to succeed Gov. Pete Wilson,
a Republican who is barred from seeking a third term, in what
promises to be a classic liberal-conservative contest over
contrasting views of the Golden State.
</P>
<P>
   At stake is a major beachhead of presidential politics in 2000
and control of congressional redistricting in the nation's most
populous state for 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Other races, including a fight for the Republican nomination for
U.S. Senate between State Treasurer Matt Fong and Darrell Issa,
another wealthy businessman, remained too close to call, as did a
fight over a ballot measure that would require unions to obtain
written consent from members before using their dues for political
purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, it was the most expensive primary election campaign in
the nation's history, with about $100 million spent on races for
governor, U.S. senator and other statewide offices and on a handful
of ballot propositions pro and con, including the bilingual
initiative and the measure limiting the use of union dues.
</P>
<P>
   With California on a sharp rebound from years of economic
recession and natural disasters, voter interest was generally low
in a state famous for political apathy, and turnout was predicted
to reach no more than 40 percent of the state's 14.6 million
registered voters.
</P>
<P>
   As usual here, most of the campaign played out in millions of
dollars of television advertising, this year featuring charge and
counter-charge by candidates in contested gubernatorial and Senate
races.
</P>
<P>
   The most contentious issue on the ballot was Unz's initiative,
which will no doubt be subject to court challenges by opponents. It
would essentially limit help for non-native speakers to a year of
intensive English instruction, though parents could request a
waiver if they believed their children needed special help. Its
supporters contend it allows for flexibility and note that its only
requirement is that instruction in general subjects be primarily in
English.
</P>
<P>
   But the measure's opponents, which included the California
Teachers Association, the state Parent Teacher Association and
President Clinton, contended that the measure would impose a rigid,
one-size-fits-all solution on the state's diverse school districts,
many of which have already chosen on their own to end or greatly
modify bilingual programs.
</P>
<P>
   The race for governor reflected intense volatility in voter
sentiment, with each of the three Democratic candidates by turns
taking first _ and last -_place in pre-election public opinion
polls. But in the closing weeks of the race, Davis, 55, opened a
clear lead over his rivals, Ms. Harman, 52, a three-term
representative from the beachfront communities on the south edge of
Los Angeles, and Checchi, 49, the former co-chairman of Northwest
Airlines, who was making his first run for elective office.
</P>
<P>
   For months last year, most of the California Democratic
establishment assumed that the the state's most popular politician,
Sen. Dianne Feinstein, would come home to run for governor and
would be the overwhelming favorite to win the nomination. But
despite encouragement from the White House to run, Ms. Feinstein
announced in January that she would not, in part, she said, because
she loathed the prospect of millions of dollars in attack ads from
Checchi.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Harman entered the race on short notice, with her own
private wealth and most of Ms. Feinstein's political team behind
her, and promptly vaulted to the lead in the polls. But then
Checchi began a barrage of televised attacks on her record and
character that not only caused Ms. Harman to plunge in the polls
but backfired on him as well. By May, half of all voters in the
state viewed Checchi unfavorably, four times the level of February,
according to a statewide poll by the Field Institute of San
Francisco, and he never recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, meantime, who could not afford to begin television
advertising until well after his richer rivals, benefited from
their feud, appearing as a relatively unscarred, fresh face on the
scene the moment he began airing commercials touting himself as the
embodiment of ``experience money can't buy.'' In fact, Davis is one
of the longest-serving politicians in the state, with a career
stretching back 23 years, to his days as chief of staff to Gov.
Jerry Brown.
</P>
<P>
   On the Republican side, Lungren, 51, spent 10 years in Congress
representing his native Long Beach. He is a classic California
conservative in the Ronald Reagan mold, who as state attorney
general since 1990 has developed a reputation for toughness on
crime. But he has also been faulted for ineffective handling of the
state's ban on assault weapons and for being reluctant to join
other states in litigation against tobacco companies.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, his strong anti-abortion stance has been seen by
many political analysts as a potential vulnerability in a state
whose governor for the last eight years, Wilson, who is a
Republican, supports abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   Even as Lungren coasted to the nomination, Fong, 44, and Issa, a
multimillionaire car alarm entrepreneur, battled in an intense
primary for the right to take on Ms. Boxer, 57, in November. Ms.
Boxer, who was first elected to the Senate in 1992 after 10 years
in the House of Representatives, had once been viewed as highly
vulnerable this year, but recent polls have shown her leading both
of her potential Republican rivals.

TRADE OF JOHNSON NO REAL SOLUTION TO MARINER WOES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ So the Mariners have blinked. After 10 days of
discussions with at least the Dodgers, Randy Johnson is off the
trading block.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Johnson is now a ``valued member'' of the Mariner staff
and will pitch for the club ``through the season,'' club president
Chuck Armstrong said Tuesday in a one-paragraph statement.
</P>
<P>
   End of discussion.
</P>
<P>
   Right. As if anything short of a contract negotiation between
Johnson and the Mariners will end speculation about what's to
become of the Big Unit.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Mariners and Johnson's representatives appear gravely
dismayed at all the media hullabaloo surrounding the dominating
lefty, whose career could be building toward Hall of Fame
induction.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, we suppose, is hurt because he has asked the team to
trade him, and now he's been told he's staying.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners, we could understand, are miffed because they felt
they were caught in a no-win situation, so why should they have to
endure criticism for their stance on Johnson? They felt Johnson was
going to cost too much and might not have been committed to staying
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, if a team like the Mariners can't keep its payroll sane
and reject a skyrocketing market for free-agent pitchers (like
Pedro Martinez and Greg Maddux at $11.5 million or more per
season), who else is going to guard against baseball's ridiculous
spiral toward financial ruin? Rupert Murdoch? Hah!
</P>
<P>
   The answer _ as it has been since last November _ is that the
Mariners should at least have offered Johnson a contract extension.
Unless, of course, the M's truly did not want him and were afraid
he would have accepted $8.5 million or so a year.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, there is an even larger point for the Mariners to
consider. They were not getting the kind of offers for Johnson that
they had hoped. They found themselves hanging so far out on the
precipice they were about to commit an embarrassing act of historic
proportions. Trading Johnson now would have looked like throwing
deck chairs off the Titanic.
</P>
<P>
   Trading him this past winter at least would have shown that they
were committed to getting something for him. It would have allowed
the team to start the season fresh and let the chips fall where
they may.
</P>
<P>
   But trading Johnson now does nothing to improve the team,
because unfortunately for everybody _ fans, players and ownership _
the Mariner chips have fallen during this 1998 season, and they
have fallen with an incredible thud.
</P>
<P>
   After another blown save, after their 10 loss when seven or more
runs wasn't enough to win, and after 48 errors makes them the worst
defensive team in the American League, the M's finally discovered
that dealing Johnson now would have been beside the point.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Johnson is the least of the Mariners' problems. The
Mariners are a sub-.500 team despite a $53 million payroll and a
roster full of All-Stars and award winners _ and the flop is badly
timed, one year before their amazingly grand and expensive new
stadium is due to open.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the reason Woody Woodward has seemed so reluctant to carry
out his bosses' marching orders to deal Johnson is because deep
down, the club's vice president of baseball operations knows the
Mariners are far better off with Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   What baseball executive would want to be remembered as the man
who traded Randy Johnson for two guys no one remembers in two
years?
</P>
<P>
   But Woodward and his scouts are left with a bigger problem now.
This split-personality team with the wonderful bats and woeful
bullpen has lost its way.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can write anything you want,'' Lou Piniella said Tuesday
after the Mariners' horrendous 10th-inning loss to the Orioles _
the 12th blown save of this imploded season _ sent the Mariner
manager pacing, smoking, muttering.
</P>
<P>
   Who wouldn't smoke, pace and mutter now, searching for answers
that just won't come?
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners have had a three- or four-year window of
opportunity to rise to the difficult challenge of playing
championship-caliber baseball. They were supposed to be peaking now
and next season, when the new stadium opens in July. But now that
window quickly is slamming shut on Seattle's fingers.
</P>
<P>
   Woodward and his scouting staff must have an understanding that
almost every trading deadline deal he has made in the past three
seasons has done more to deplete the Mariners than shore them up.
</P>
<P>
   In '95, it was prospects like outfielder Mark Newfield and
pitcher Ron Villone peddled for rent-a-pitcher Andy Benes. It was
too much, too late.
</P>
<P>
   And in '97, it was outfielder Jose Cruz Jr. for relievers Mike
Timlin and Paul Spoljaric, and pitcher Derek Lowe and catcher Jason
Varitek for closer Heathcliff Slocumb _ a very high price because
the Mariners waited too long to jump in for deals with the White
Sox or the Phillies.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in a season that was supposed to be a set-up for the
opening of a new ballpark, the Mariners have come undone. Not for
lack of effort. Not for lack of heart. But for lack of good, timely
deals that would have improved the team instead of depleting it and
the farm system.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariner skipper told us to write what we want. His team is
trying. He is out of answers, and the Mariner problems are nothing
a Randy Johnson trade can fix.

RANGERS, WITT DOWN DEVIL RAYS, 7-3
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ The Rangers placed right-hander Bobby
Witt in their rotation partly for his ability to accumulate innings
and ease the burden on their bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Those days might now be beyond him.
</P>
<P>
   Witt earned the victory during last night's 7-3 triumph against
the Tampa Bay Devil Rays at Tropicana Field, but Witt, 34, failed
to record an out during the seventh inning for the seventh time in
11 starts this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't look like the same pitcher I had in Florida,'' said
Devil Rays manager Larry Rothschild, who served as Witt's pitching
coach in 1995 while both were with the Marlins. ``I don't know if
he's hurting or what. He spotted the ball at times tonight, but
he's pitching differently.''
</P>
<P>
   Witt, who entered the game ranked third among American League
pitchers in run support per nine innings with 7.95, once again
emerged as the beneficiary of the Rangers' offense.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers sponsored Witt with a six-run second inning, and he
pitched 5 1/3 innings for his fifth victory in eight decisions.
Witt averaged 5 1/3 innings during his previous 10 starts.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers manager Johnny Oates does not view Witt as a five-inning
pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope not,'' the manager said. ``Tonight he was.''
</P>
<P>
   Witt, though, remains a competitor.
</P>
<P>
   The Devil Rays tagged the right-hander for a run in the fourth
inning and scored twice during the fifth inning on a one-out,
two-run homer from third baseman Wade Boggs. First baseman Fred
McGriff then reached on a single, and Witt appeared in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, he induced an inning-ending, double-play ground ball off
the bat of second baseman Bobby Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to get a ground ball,'' Witt said, ``and I did
with a slider.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith hit the ball into the hole between second and third base,
but Domingo Cedeno _ playing for injured shortstop Kevin Elster _
made a backhand stop and accurate throw to second base. Luis
Alicea, playing for injured second baseman Mark McLemore, turned
the pivot cleanly to complete the second of two double plays in
which both were involved.
</P>
<P>
   It represented the tandem's first work together at those
positions this season, and the two worked at those positions
together only sparingly this spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``The second one was more difficult,'' Alicea said of the
momentum-changing play. ``He gave me a good, low feed, but we work
on that every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Alicea and Cedeno also contributed offensively during the
Rangers' six-run second inning. Cedeno, who can be described as a
free swinger, demonstrated selectiveness at the plate and drew a
bases-loaded walk that scored first baseman Will Clark with the
Rangers' first run.
</P>
<P>
   Alicea capped the inning with a two-out, three-run homer on a
3-2 fastball from right-hander Jason Johnson (2-3).
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just happy I hit the ball hard, but I definitely can't be
concerned about hitting home runs,'' said Alicea, who had hit only
11 during 2,469 previous major-league at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   Left-hander Scott Bailes and right-handers Al Levine, Xavier
Hernandez and John Wetteland gave the Rangers' 3 2/3 scoreless
innings after Witt surrendered three runs on seven hits and four
walks.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to give a lot of credit to our bullpen and bench,''
Oates said. ``We thought our bench was going to be good coming into
this season, and it's lived up to that expectation. The bullpen and
bench continue to do very, very well for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Witt, who along with right-hander John Burkett and left-hander
Darren Oliver has struggled much of this season, appeared upset by
Oates' decision to remove him after a one-out, sixth-inning double
by catcher Mike DiFelice. The Rangers led 7-3, and Witt had thrown
only 90 pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's his decision,'' Witt said. ``What am I going to say?
What is Burkie going to say? What is Darren going to say? We're all
capable of going out there and throwing 125-135 pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't continue to go out there to the bullpen. Those guys
have done an outstanding job all season, but you feel your job is
to go seven or eight innings so they don't have to get up every
night.''
</P>
<P>
   Witt apparently wanted that opportunity last night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to be happy,'' he said, ``until I finish a
game.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be a first this season.

CORA TELLS WRITER NEXT SEASON WILL BE HIS LAST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM STREET  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ Mariners second baseman Joey Cora is planning the
final chapter of his major league career. He told a reporter from
his native Puerto Rico it will be written after next season.
</P>
<P>
   The popular Mariner divulged his plans to the reporter from a
San Juan newspaper last weekend, although he wouldn't comment
Tuesday about the article.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the time to be talking about it,'' Cora said after
the Mariners dropped a 9-8, 10-inning decision to the Baltimore
Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to finish this season and take the option for '99
and that's it,'' Cora, 33, told El Nuevo Dia. ``I've thought it
over and feel comfortable with the decision. I'll retire after
1999.''
</P>
<P>
   The option actually belongs to the Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   Cora, who helped the M's get into the playoffs in 1995 and '97,
is making $1.65 million this season with a $1.8 million club option
for '99.
</P>
<P>
   His remarks were published in Saturday's editions of the
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Cora said the constant travel and a desire to spend more time
with family motivated the decision. Cora was married last November.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't understand that. In baseball, life is good and
there is good money, but the trips here are brutal,'' he said. ``I
want to enjoy life with my wife and my family. When you're in
baseball, you forget other things.''
</P>
<P>
   Cora, who was born in Caguas, Puerto Rico, played in 1987 with
the San Diego Padres and was traded in 1991 to the Chicago White
Sox. He signed with the Mariners in 1995 as a free agent and hit
.300 last season.
</P>
<P>
   Cora said he hasn't decided what he wants to do after 1999, but
would consider scouting or working with a team in Puerto Rico,
``but not as a coach and not as a manager.''

CONSERVATIVE EX-LAWMAKER WINS IOWA GOP PRIMARY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MIKE ALLEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jim Ross Lightfoot, the most conservative of three Republicans
seeking to succeed Gov. Terry Branstad of Iowa, easily won his
party's nomination in Tuesday's primary, while two little-known
Democrats were nearly tied.
</P>
<P>
   Branstad, the nation's longest-serving governor, is retiring
after four terms. The potential presidential field of 2000 was
closely watching the primary races as a barometer of the strength
of each party's factions in Iowa, an early weeder of White House
hopefuls.
</P>
<P>
   Lightfoot, 59, a former congressman and farm broadcaster, beat
two other Republicans, David Oman, a cable television executive,
and Paul Pate, the Iowa secretary of state. Potential Republican
candidates for president had long considered the frontrunner to be
Lightfoot, who stumped with Steve Forbes, Jack Kemp and Dan Quayle.
</P>
<P>
   Lightfoot told his supporters at the Hotel Fort Des Moines,
``With this vote of confidence we are ready to work together in a
unified effort to make Iowa the best neighborhood in America by
cutting taxes, improving schools and winning the fight against
crime and drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic candidates were Mark McCormick, a former justice
of the state Supreme Court who ran as a centrist, and state Sen.
Tom Vilsack, who stuck to the traditional, more liberal stands of
Iowa Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have not held the governor's mansion in Iowa for 30
years, and analysts said the Republicans once again go into the
fall with big advantages, including Branstad's continuing
popularity. The analysts said they expect Lightfoot to benefit from
the momentum of his big victory, and from the statewide name
recognition he built up during a losing bid for U.S. Senate in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Also, redistricting during his 12 years in Congress meant he
represented 44 of the state's 99 counties at one time or another.
Both Democrats, by contrast, were unknown even to some activists in
their own party.
</P>
<P>
   J. Ann Selzer, the director of the Iowa Poll, said Lightfoot had
appealed to ``the heart of the party'' during the nominating
contest. ``He's going to have to change his style and adjust his
message, but he understands that,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Lightfoot, who won the endorsement of Iowa Right to Life, aired
a television commercial last month in which his late mother
described how she had adopted him from an orphanage as an infant.
In an unusual twist for Republicans in today's anti-tax climate,
the other two candidates argued that Lightfoot's proposal for
cutting state income tax rates was too steep and could lead to
drastic cuts in education. Each proposed his own, more moderate
cut.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic race was more bitterly fought. Each candidate ran
television advertisements criticizing the other's legal clients.
Vilsack charged his opponent would ``give new tax breaks to
corporate real estate,'' while McCormick said his opponent
``represented banks on farm foreclosures during the farm crisis.''
Vilsack replied that in most cases, he had been on the side of
farmers.
</P>
<P>
   The five candidates spent nearly $4 million among them.
Lightfoot raised more than $1 million, compared with $710,000 for
Oman and $580,000 for Pate. On the Democratic side, McCormick had a
slight financial edge, with $780,000 in contributions and loans, to
Vilsack's $690,000.

<P>
   In the Democratic primary in New Mexico, Martin Chavez, a former
mayor of Albuquerque, topped a field of six to win a spot on
November's ballot against the first-term incumbent Republican, Gov.
Gary Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Two House races in New Mexico drew national attention. In one,
state Attorney General Tom Udall, a nephew of the longtime
Congressman Morris Udall, was seeking a chance to bring the Udall
name back to Washington. He was running in the Democrat primary for
the congressional seat held by Rep. Bill Redmond, a Republican
freshman. The other candidate was Eric Serna, who had sought the
seat in a special election last year. Mark Udall, a son of the
congressman, is running for a House seat in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   In another House race, for the seat of the late Rep. Steven
Schiff, a five-term Republican who died in March, the primary
winners were Heather Wilson on the Republican side and state Sen.
Phil Maloof on the Democratic side. In a preview of the November
race, the two already were slated to face off in a special election
on June 23 to fill out Schiff's term.
</P>
<P>
   In South Dakota, a member of the executive committee of the
Republican National Committee won a spot on the November ballot
against Sen. Tom Daschle, the Democratic leader, who was unopposed
for his party's nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican winner was Ronald Schmidt, 60, a lawyer from
Pierre. He said he stands for less government and lower taxes, and
plans to portray Daschle as being too focused on national causes.
``The people of South Dakota are going to have the most clear-cut
choice of philosophies of any voters in the country,'' Schmidt said
Tuesday night. Schmidt beat Alan Aker, a logging contractor, and
John Sanders, a businessman.
</P>
<P>
   In Montana, each party's candidate ran unopposed in the primary
for the state's single congressional district. The incumbent is
Rep. Rick Hill, a freshman Republican, who will face Robert
Deschamps, a Democrat, in November.

DODGERS PULL THE PLUG
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ After dragging fans, players and front-office
executives around for five days, the Randy Johnson trade saga ended
Tuesday with the 6-foot-10 left-hander remaining in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Dodgers' attempt at a second blockbuster trade
in the past two weeks failed when their final bid of right-hander
Ismael Valdes and two minor leaguers for Johnson was rejected by
the Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle still wanted right-hander Darren Dreifort, who started
Tuesday's game against the St. Louis Cardinals. When Dodgers
executive vice president Fred Claire said no, the Mariners said
Johnson will stay in Seattle for the rest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team is no longer in pursuit of Randy Johnson,'' Claire
said. ``It ended at 12 noon today as far as we were concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Dodgers, who have wilted under the distraction of the
Johnson trade talks, will attempt to regroup without him. Claire
addressed the team an hour before Tuesday's 7-4 loss to the
Cardinals and stressed the need to refocus after losing three in a
row over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not need a frenzy every night at Dodger Stadium,''
Claire said.
</P>
<P>
   Claire spent part of the day fielding inquiries about
right-hander Hideo Nomo, who was designated for assignment Monday
after demanding a trade. Claire spoke to more than a dozen teams,
including the Baltimore Orioles. Claire said there was nothing to
reports that the Dodgers were close to sending Nomo to the Orioles
for closer Armando Benitez.
</P>
<P>
   The deadline on the Johnson talks was an attempt by Claire to
reaffirm his control of the Dodgers' baseball operation.
</P>
<P>
   During the 5-for-2 trade May 15 with the Florida Marlins, Fox
television head Chase Carey was the point man in acquiring Gary
Sheffield, Bobby Bonilla, Charles Johnson and Jim Eisenreich for
Mike Piazza and Todd Zeile.
</P>
<P>
   Claire was so far from the action that many questioned his role
in the Dodgers hierarchy under new ownership.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the players there should be no misunderstanding that
the direction of baseball operations is Fred Claire,'' he said. ``I
am the man.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's primary focus, however, remained fixed on Johnson.
Dodgers players said they were pleased to have the distractions end
but were disappointed a pitcher of Johnson's caliber did not join
the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We definitely would have been better with him,'' Bonilla said.
``But it is time to regroup and get on with the season.''
</P>
<P>
   First baseman Eric Karros said the club should not be surprised
by the circus atmosphere that overtook the Johnson talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is baseball in the l990s,'' he said. ``This kind of thing
never happened in the Dodgers organization. Nothing ever gets done
out in the open. Now we are like everyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Raul Mondesi said the most important thing for the players is
not to look back later this season and wonder if Johnson would have
been the difference in overtaking the Padres.
</P>
<P>
   ``All along I've thought we had a good enough team to win,'' he
said. ``None of this has changed my feelings. He is a good pitcher,
but we are a good team.''
</P>
<P>
   Claire called Mariners general manager Woody Woodward Tuesday
morning and issued a noon deadline to accept or reject an offer of
three players that included Valdes, minor league utility player
Wilton Guerrero and pitcher Eric Weaver for Johnson, who is
eligible for free agency at the end of the season.
</P>
<P>
   When he did not hear from Woodward, Claire prepared to address
the players that they must move forward without Johnson and regain
focus on a season that has been derailed by distractions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has hurt us,'' manager Bill Russell said. ``I think a lot
of people thought he was coming. A guy like that makes you better.
Now that it's over, I think we'll be better. We've already made
some moves that improved the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Without Dreifort in the deal, the Mariners turned their
attention to having Johnson pitch this season and getting him to
sign a new contract at the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's own contract impasse, which began during spring
training, also has been a distraction for the Mariners. Expected to
win the American League West, they are 26-31 after losing 9-0
Tuesday night in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Randy Johnson is a valued pitcher for the Mariners, who is
under contract for the balance of the 1998 season,'' Seattle
president Chuck Armstrong said in a statement. ``Randy will pitch
for the Mariners throughout this season.'' &QL;

ALABAMA GOVERNOR FORCED INTO RUNOFF 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: Subs 5th graf for updating of vote) (mk) 
 By KEVIN SACK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTGOMERY, Ala. _ Gov. Fob James Jr. of Alabama, a
party-switching Republican whose fervid support for school prayer
has made him a national icon for religious conservatives, was
forced into a runoff in the gubernatorial primary here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Although he finished first in a five-candidate field, James, 63,
failed to win a majority and will face Winton Blount III, a
Montgomery businessman and longtime Republican loyalist, in the
runoff on June 30.
</P>
<P>
   James, who is running for reelection to his third term _ he
served the first as a Democrat from 1979 to 1983 _ nearly avoided
the runoff with a late surge as he moved steadily toward the 50
percent threshhold in the final week of campaigning. But the same
dissatisfaction that lured four Republican opponents to challenge
the incumbent apparently unsettled just enough voters to deny James
a first-round victory.
</P>
<P>
   James and Blount now face the arduous task of turning out their
voters for a midsummer runoff and competing for the support of the
three other Republican contenders.
</P>
<P>
   With 91 percent of the precincts reporting, James had 163,711
votes, or 48 percent of the vote, while Blount finished second with
139,941 votes, or 41 percent. Former Gov. Guy Hunt, who decided to
run after being pardoned of the state ethics conviction that forced
his resignation in 1993, finished third with 8 percent of the vote.
Two other candidates, Lewis Leslie McAllister Jr., a Tuscaloosa
businessman, and Phillip Williams, a former state finance director,
shared the rest of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   In the Democratic primary, Lt. Gov. Don Siegelman easily
defeated his top rival, Lenora Pate, a Birmingham lawyer. Siegelman
enters the general election with more than $3.5 million in his
campaign treasury, a team of experienced Democratic strategists and
an eye-catching policy proposal borrowed from the popular
Democratic governor of a neighboring state, Zell Miller of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Siegelman has pledged to push for a state lottery to finance
college scholarships, pre-kindergarten programs and school
construction. That plan is sure to strike a chord with Alabamians
desperate to improve the quality of the state's educational system.
But, as was the case in Georgia, it has already stirred opposition
from religious conservatives who view the lottery as a first step
toward the legalization of other forms of gambling. The Republicans
also plan to portray Siegelman as an unreconstructed liberal and a
captive of the state's trial lawyers' lobby.
</P>
<P>
   In neighboring Mississippi, meanwhile, voters in the Democratic
and Republican primaries selected congressional candidates who will
vie in the general election in November. The most closely watched
race came in the 4th District in southwestern Mississippi, where a
large field of candidates from both parties competed to succeed
Rep. Mike Parker, a Republican who is retiring after five terms.
</P>
<P>
   On the Republican side, Delbert Hosemann, a Jackson lawyer, and
Phil Davis, a banker from Magee, finished first and second
respectively in a nine-candidate field, forcing a runoff on June
23. In the Democratic primary, Ronnie Shows, a regional
commissioner for the state transportation department, won a
majority in his campaign against two opponents.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Alabama gubernatorial race has been depicted by James'
strategists and by national leaders of the Christian conservative
movement as an important electoral test for the religious right.
</P>
<P>
   During the last 16 months, James has taken a number of
provocative stands aimed at returning religious expression to
public schools and courtrooms, a mission with substantial grass
roots support in this deeply devout, conservative and populist
state. In each instance, James has assailed the federal courts as
the mortal foe of God-fearing Alabamians, a tactic used by his
predecessor, George Wallace, when this state's deep-seated
resentment of federal intrusion was stoked more by race than by
religion.
</P>
<P>
   The governor has threatened to call out the National Guard to
defend the right of a state judge in Gadsden, Ala., to display the
Ten Commandments on his courtroom wall. He also has waged an
aggressive campaign to defend a 1993 state law that permitted
voluntary, student-led prayer in the schools. A federal judge
rejected the law as unconstitutional, leading James to assert that
the Bill of Rights does not apply to the states and that state
officials need not obey Supreme Court rulings when they believe
that the high court has overstepped its authority.
</P>
<P>
   Those positions, and the perception that James has placed more
emphasis on school prayer than on economic development and
education, quickly alienated some of the state's business leaders,
who rallied around the candidacy of Blount, a longtime Republican
activist who owns car dealerships and other companies. Blount,
whose father was postmaster general in the Nixon administration,
finished third in the 1994 gubernatorial primary.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Blount has attacked James for raising taxes
during his first term as governor, and for profiting from a
family-owned landfill that does business with the state. All of the
state's major newspapers endorsed Blount, and his strategists hoped
that Hunt, a Primitive Baptist preacher, would siphon Christian
conservative votes from James.
</P>
<P>
   But Blount's momentum seemed to stall in the final week of the
campaign, as Alabamians focused on the race and moved toward James,
whose son, Forrest James III, was quoted in the Birmingham News
this week as describing his father as ``a God-fearing redneck.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last week of the race, James promoted his pledge not to
raise taxes, a promise that Blount rejected as irresponsible. And
James, who counts Ralph Reed, the former director of the Christian
Coalition, as a consultant, won endorsements from many of the
country's Christian conservative leaders, including Pat Robertson,
Jerry Falwell, Phyllis Schlafly, James Dobson and Donald Wildmon.
</P>
<P>
   One poll published on Sunday found that 56 percent of those who
believe the Bible is literally true said they would vote for James.

MARINER BULLPEN BLOWS ANOTHER ON PALMEIRO HOMER IN 10TH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM STREET  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ Six years and several million dollars ago, the
Mariners had a bullpen that pitched to expectations. Those
relievers lacked talent, and everyone knew it.
</P>
<P>
   Edgar Martinez remembers it well. Those Mariners were a 64-98,
last-place team.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a tough season,'' the M's designated hitter said
Tuesday, ``but this season is more frustrating. The way we have
lost so many games makes everyone get frustrated.''
</P>
<P>
   Shellshocked is more appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   Rafael Palmeiro beat the Mariners with a home run for the second
day in a row, this one a two-run shot off Bobby Ayala in the bottom
of the 10th to hand the Baltimore Orioles and 46,724 fans a 9-8
victory at Camden Yards.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Griffey Jr.'s second home run of the game, leading off the
top of the 10th off former teammate Norm Charlton, had put the M's
in position to win. But, thanks to Palmeiro, the 8-7 lead lasted
about as long as Seattle's earlier 2-0 and 5-2 leads.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I hit it pretty well,'' Palmeiro said. ``The ball
carries better in the day and the wind was blowing out. So all the
conditions were right.''
</P>
<P>
   He neglected to mention that Ayala, now 0-5 with a 7.57 ERA, was
pitching.
</P>
<P>
   The towering drive, coming after a Harold Baines single, sailed
over Griffey's head in center field, landing on the grass on the
other side of the fence.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got to the wall, I said, `Oh ...' and it wasn't for
Oriole,'' Griffey said. ``You can't put (what he said) it in a
newspaper.''
</P>
<P>
   Ayala, as usual, said nothing.
</P>
<P>
   His fifth blown save is the team's 12th and the bullpen is on
pace for 34 blown saves this season, obliterating the 27 they
accumulated last season to tie for the major league lead.
</P>
<P>
   The latest one came after two other relievers _ Paul Spoljaric
and Heathcliff Slocumb _ held the Orioles hitless for four innings.
</P>
<P>
   But manager Lou Piniella stuck with his guns and brought in
Ayala to pitch the 10th. The resulting backfire sounded like a
cannon going off at nearby Fort McHenry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not getting myself upset, I'm really not,'' Piniella said.
``I'm not getting myself upset anymore because I'm the one who
suffers. I'm not getting upset.''
</P>
<P>
   The mood outside the manager's office was understandably
subdued. Second baseman Joey Cora realizes the direction his team
is headed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should have won five of the six games on this road trip and
gotten back in the race,'' he said of the M's 3-3 Eastern showing.
``In all my years, I have never seen anything like this. We have
given away too many games and you don't win a division championship
this way.
</P>
<P>
   ``The players expect to win. The front office expects us to win.
Our fans expect us to win. This isn't the late '80s or early '90s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying anybody in particular is at fault, but you
can't be giving games away the way we have. When you get a team
down, keep it down and get out of town. But even when we win it's a
struggle. I don't think we've had a comfortable game all season.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been a couple of easy victories, but regardless how
many runs the Mariners offense can produce, too many times it isn't
enough. In 10 of their losses this season, the M's have put seven
runs or more on the board.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey hit his 20th and 21st home runs Tuesday and drove in
four runs. David Segui had three hits. Alex Rodriguez slugged his
21st home run in the first inning.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle has hit a club-record 13 homers in its past three games,
scored 28 runs _ and lost twice.
</P>
<P>
   ``This club goes out and plays hard every day,'' Piniella said.
``We battle our butts off but we just can't get the right things to
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The right things were happening, if only for a while, in the
bullpen Tuesday. Spoljaric retired all seven batters he faced,
striking out four. Slocumb retired all five batters he faced,
striking out three.
</P>
<P>
   Then Piniella, armed with the lead in the 10th, called for his
closer. Ayala faced two batters. Game over.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're shellshocked,'' pitcher Jeff Fassero said. ``How many
blown saves do we have? It's tough to swallow right now.''
</P>
<P>
   On a day the Mariners could have expected a solid effort from
their starting pitcher, left-hander Jamie Moyer was rocked for the
first time this season. He entered the game with a 2.98 earned run
average, but surrendered Cal Ripken's two-run homer in the second,
offsetting Rodriguez's two-run blast.
</P>
<P>
   The M's surged ahead 5-2 in the third on Griffey's three-run
homer, but Baltimore retaliated in the fourth, scoring four runs on
homers by B.J. Surhoff and Brady Anderson.

DODGERS CAN GET NO RELIEF IN LOSS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARC J. SPEARS  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ On this day when wild rumors on a possible Randy
Johnson deal ended, the Los Angeles Dodgers proved that talks for
some bullpen help probably need to begin.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers entered the game with three-straight losses at home,
including two that resulted from bad outings from closer Scott
Radinsky.
</P>
<P>
   And in game 1 of reality without Johnson or Hideo Nomo in blue,
the pen was battered again as Dodgers reliever Jim Bruske gave up a
two-out, three-run homer to Brian Jordan in the eighth inning to
give the Mark McGwire-less St. Louis Cardinals a 7-4 victory
Tuesday night in front of 36,367.
</P>
<P>
   Another loss at Chavez Ravine surely had the Dodgers wishing for
a return from Triple-A Albuquerque of reliever Brad Clontz or that
the rumors of a Nomo deal for Baltimore reliever Armando Benitez
were true.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for the Dodgers, however, neither were available
as Bruske replaced started Darren Dreifort in the eighth with two
outs. After working a 1-1 count, Jordan aired the ball into the
left-field bleachers to give the Cardinals a 7-4 lead in a game in
which they were down by four runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we (still) need is subjective,'' said Dodgers executive
vice president Fred Claire, who said the possibility of a deal for
Seattle ace Randy Johnson ended Tuesday afternoon. ``We haven't had
a settle down after everything that happened. I believe in this
club.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers' 4-0 lead came via some offensive punch from three
of the four ex-Marlins that they acquired in a May 16 blockbuster
trade. Los Angeles, however, is just 8-8 since making the move.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Bonilla entered the game batting just .237 with a homer in
15 games with the Dodgers and was dropped in the batting order from
cleanup to the sixth spot. The left-handed batter, however, gave
his club a no-out 1-0 lead with a RBI single in the second.
</P>
<P>
   An out later, Charles Johnson tagged a two-run home run into the
left-field seats off a 1-2 pitch from St. Louis starter Kent
Mercker to put the Dodgers up 2-0. Johnson, who had a career-high
19 homers last season, hit his third blast in the past four games
and now has 10 homers on the season.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Gary Sheffield, who entered the game batting .356 with 10
RBI as a Dodger, added an RBI popout in the third to give Los
Angeles a four-run cushion.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The chemistry) takes time, especially when you've got four
guys coming in here and get settled in,' said Dodgers manager Bill
Russell. ``We had an everyday lineup that was starting to jell,
starting to play well and was coming off a successful roadtrip.
Then all of the sudden came the Randy Johnson deal which was a big
distraction for us. These guys need to start playing together and
looking out for each other. Everything (improves) from playing
together every day.'
</P>
<P>
   For the first four innings, Dreifort (3-5) pitched well, got out
of two jams and showed why the Dodgers brass chuckled when the
Seattle Mariners reportedly inquired about him. The former
reliever, who entered Tuesday with a three-game winning streak,
reverted back to his early-season struggles by struggling in the
middle innings.
</P>
<P>
   This time, it was the fifth inning when the Cardinals scored
four runs and batted around to tie the game. Despite striking out a
career-high eight batters in 72/3 innings, Dreifort gave up six
runs and nine hits, threw a wild pitch and walked six. As for
Mercker (7-2), who threw a no-hitter at Dodger Stadium with the
Atlanta Braves in 1993, he allowed four runs on eight hits in seven
innings.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Californians on Tuesday approved a ballot measure
that would curtail three decades of bilingual instruction in the
public schools here, paving the way for similar assaults on such
programs around the nation, according to early election returns.
</P>
<P>
   Strong majorities across major ethnic and racial lines expressed
support in pre-election public opinion polls for the measure to
effectively end bilingual education, though most Hispanic elected
officials and all the major candidates for governor in both parties
opposed it.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, sponsored by Ron Unz, a multimillionaire software
entrepreneur from Silicon Valley, tapped into widespread
dissatisfaction among parents, politicians and educators. They
argued that existing bilingual education programs, a legacy of the
civil rights movement of the 1960s in which students are taught
basic subjects in their native language while they also learn
English, were not working well to prepare a huge new generation of
immigrant students for the job market.
</P>
<P>
   In another fiercely contested race, Lt. Gov. Gray Davis, a
23-year veteran of state politics, rode a wave of support from
traditional liberal constituencies to soundly defeat his richer
rivals for the Democratic nomination for governor, Rep. Jane Harman
and Alfred Checchi, a multimillionaire businessman who spent about
$40 million on his campaign, the individual record for any
non-presidential candidate in American history.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Harman conceded defeat shortly before 10 p.m., while Checchi
was running a distant third.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winning is more fun, but losing with honor ain't bad,'' Ms.
Harman said.
</P>
<P>
   Davis will now take on the Republican state attorney general,
Dan Lungren, who faced only token opposition on Tuesday in the
state's new blanket primary in which the names of all candidates
appeared on the same ballot regardless of party. They will compete
for the right to succeed Gov. Pete Wilson, a Republican who is
barred from seeking a third term, in what promises to be a classic
liberal-conservative contest over contrasting views of the Golden
State.
</P>
<P>
   At stake is a major beachhead of presidential politics in 2000
and control of congressional redistricting in the nation's most
populous state for 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Other races, including a fight for the Republican nomination for
U.S. Senate between State Treasurer Matt Fong and Darrell Issa,
another wealthy businessman, remained too close to call, as did a
fight over a ballot measure that would require unions to obtain
written consent from members before using their dues for political
purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, it was the most expensive primary election campaign in
the nation's history, with about $100 million spent on races for
governor, U.S. senator and other statewide offices and on a handful
of ballot propositions pro and con, including the bilingual
initiative and the measure limiting the use of union dues.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   With California on a sharp rebound from years of economic
recession and natural disasters, voter interest was generally low
in a state famous for political apathy, and turnout was predicted
to reach no more than 40 percent of the state's 14.6 million
registered voters. As usual here, most of the campaign played out
in millions of dollars of television advertising, this year
featuring charge and counter-charge by candidates in contested
gubernatorial and Senate races.
</P>
<P>
   The most contentious issue on the ballot was Unz's initiative,
which will no doubt be subject to court challenges by opponents. It
would essentially limit help for non-native speakers to a year of
intensive English instruction, though parents could request a
waiver if they believed their children needed special help. Its
supporters contend it allows for flexibility and note that its only
requirement is that instruction in general subjects be primarily in
English.
</P>
<P>
   But the measure's opponents, which included the California
Teachers Association, the state Parent Teacher Association and
President Clinton, contended that the measure would impose a rigid,
one-size-fits-all solution on the state's diverse school districts,
many of which have already chosen on their own to end or greatly
modify bilingual programs.
</P>
<P>
   The race for governor reflected intense volatility in voter
sentiment, with each of the three Democratic candidates by turns
taking first _ and last -_place in pre-election public opinion
polls. But in the closing weeks of the race, Davis, 55, opened a
clear lead over his rivals, Ms. Harman, 52, a three-term
representative from the beachfront communities on the south edge of
Los Angeles, and Checchi, 49, the former co-chairman of Northwest
Airlines, who was making his first run for elective office.
</P>
<P>
   For months last year, most of the California Democratic
establishment assumed that the the state's most popular politician,
Sen. Dianne Feinstein, would come home to run for governor and
would be the overwhelming favorite to win the nomination. But
despite encouragement from the White House to run, Ms. Feinstein
announced in January that she would not, in part, she said, because
she loathed the prospect of millions of dollars in attack ads from
Checchi.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Harman entered the race on short notice, with her own
private wealth and most of Ms. Feinstein's political team behind
her, and promptly vaulted to the lead in the polls. But then
Checchi began a barrage of televised attacks on her record and
character that not only caused Ms. Harman to plunge in the polls
but backfired on him as well. By May, half of all voters in the
state viewed Checchi unfavorably, four times the level of February,
according to a statewide poll by the Field Institute of San
Francisco, and he never recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, meantime, who could not afford to begin television
advertising until well after his richer rivals, benefited from
their feud, appearing as a relatively unscarred, fresh face on the
scene the moment he began airing commercials touting himself as the
embodiment of ``experience money can't buy.'' In fact, Davis is one
of the longest-serving politicians in the state, with a career
stretching back 23 years, to his days as chief of staff to Gov.
Jerry Brown.
</P>
<P>
   On the Republican side, Lungren, 51, spent 10 years in Congress
representing his native Long Beach. He is a classic California
conservative in the Ronald Reagan mold, who as state attorney
general since 1990 has developed a reputation for toughness on
crime. But he has also been faulted for ineffective handling of the
state's ban on assault weapons and for being reluctant to join
other states in litigation against tobacco companies.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, his strong anti-abortion stance has been seen by
many political analysts as a potential vulnerability in a state
whose governor for the last eight years, Wilson, who is a
Republican, supports abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   Even as Lungren coasted to the nomination, Fong, 44, and Issa, a
multimillionaire car alarm entrepreneur, battled in an intense
primary for the right to take on Sen. Barbara Boxer, 57, in
November. Ms. Boxer, who was first elected to the Senate in 1992
after 10 years in the House of Representatives, had once been
viewed as highly vulnerable this year, but recent polls have shown
her leading both of her potential Republican rivals.

CONSERVATIVE EX-LAWMAKER WINS IOWA GOP PRIMARY  (sw) 
 By MIKE ALLEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jim Ross Lightfoot, the most conservative of three Republicans
seeking to succeed Gov. Terry Branstad of Iowa, easily won his
party's nomination in Tuesday's primary. State Sen. Tom Vilsack,
the more liberal of two Democrats, won that party's primary.
</P>
<P>
   Branstad, the nation's longest-serving governor, is retiring
after four terms. The primary races were closely watched as a
barometer of the strength of each party's factions in Iowa, which
will be an early weeder of White House hopefuls in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Lightfoot carried about 70 percent of the Republican vote in a
three-candidate field. Vilsack won about 51 percent of that party's
vote.
</P>
<P>
   Vilsack, 47, attributed his victory to his emphasis on ``working
families.'' He stuck to the traditional liberal stands of Iowa
Democrats and won the endorsement of labor unions and other
Democratic interest groups. His opponent, Mark McCormick, a former
justice of the State Supreme Court, ran as a centrist and argued
that the party needed to broaden its appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Lightfoot, 59, a former congressman and farm broadcaster, beat
David Oman, a cable television executive, and Paul Pate, the Iowa
secretary of state. Lightfoot, long considered the front-runner,
had been courted by three possible Republican candidates for
president _ Steve Forbes, Jack Kemp and Dan Quayle.
</P>
<P>
   Lightfoot told his supporters on Tuesday night, ``We are ready
to work together in a unified effort to make Iowa the best
neighborhood in America by cutting taxes, improving schools and
winning the fight against crime and drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have not held the governor's mansion in Iowa for 30
years, and analysts said the Republicans once again go into the
fall with big advantages, including Branstad's continuing
popularity. The analysts said they expect Lightfoot to benefit from
the momentum of his big victory, and from the statewide name
recognition he built up during an unsuccessful bid for U.S. Senate
in 1996. Also, redistricting during his 12 years in Congress meant
that as one of Iowa's five House members, he represented 44 of the
state's 99 counties at one time or another. Both Democrats, by
contrast, were unknown even to some activists in their own party.
</P>
<P>
   J. Ann Selzer, the director of the Iowa Poll, said Lightfoot had
appealed to ``the heart of the party'' during the primary contest.
``He's going to have to change his style and adjust his message,
but he understands that,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Lightfoot, who won the endorsement of Iowa Right to Life, aired
a television commercial last month in which his late mother
described how she had adopted him from an orphanage as an infant.
</P>
<P>
   The other two candidates argued that Lightfoot's proposal for
reducing state income tax rates was too steep and could lead to
drastic cuts in education. Each proposed his own, more moderate
cut.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic race was more bitterly fought. Each candidate ran
television advertisements criticizing the other's legal clients.
Vilsack said that his opponent would ``give new tax breaks to
corporate real estate,'' while McCormick said his opponent
``represented banks on farm foreclosures during the farm crisis.''
Vilsack replied that in most cases, he had been on the side of
farmers.
</P>
<P>
   The five candidates spent nearly $4 million among them.
Lightfoot raised more than $1 million, compared with $710,000 for
Oman and $580,000 for Pate. On the Democratic side, McCormick had a
slight financial edge, with $780,000 in contributions and loans, to
Mr. Vilsack's $690,000.
</P>
<P>
   In the Democratic primary for governor in New Mexico, Martin
Chavez, a former mayor of Albuquerque, topped a field of six to win
a spot on November's ballot against the first-term incumbent
Republican, Gov. Gary Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez, 47, said his fall campaign will focus on education,
including his plans for smaller class sizes, better teacher pay and
full-day kindergarten. ``I don't know if New Mexicans want less
government, but they want their government to work properly,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Two House races in New Mexico drew national attention. In one,
State Attorney General Tom Udall, a nephew of the former longtime
congressman Morris Udall, won a chance to bring the Udall name back
to Washington in the Democrat primary for the congressional seat
held by Rep. Bill Redmond, a Republican freshman. Mark Udall, a son
of the congressman, is running for a House seat in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   In another House race, for the seat of the late Rep. Steven
Schiff, a five-term Republican who died in March, the primary
winners were Heather Wilson on the Republican side and State Sen.
Phil Maloof on the Democratic side. In a preview of the November
race, the two already were slated to face off in a special election
on June 23 to fill out Schiff's term.
</P>
<P>
   In South Dakota, a member of the executive committee of the
Republican National Committee won a spot on the November ballot
against Sen. Tom Daschle, the Democratic leader, who was unopposed
for his party's nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican winner was Ronald Schmidt, 60, a lawyer from
Pierre. He said he stands for less government and lower taxes, and
plans to portray Daschle as being too focused on national causes.
Schmidt beat Alan Aker, a logging contractor, and John Sanders, a
businessman.

MEASURE TO OVERHAUL BILINGUAL EDUCATION WINS EASILY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Will also move in the ``n'' California news file.) 
(Daily News Staff Writer Rick Orlov contributed to this report.) 
BY DAVID R. BAKER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Proposition 227, which would end a quarter-century
experiment with bilingual education in California public schools,
easily won passage with overwhelming voter support.
</P>
<P>
   But even before the votes were counted Tuesday, opponents
prepared to mount a legal challenge to block it in the courts.
</P>
<P>
   The English for the Children initiative would give non-English
speakers a year of intensive language instruction before placing
them in regular classes with some exceptions allowed. About 1.4
million California children have limited English skills.
</P>
<P>
   Statewide initiatives were all leading with the exception of a
measure affecting state contracting.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of Proposition 227 said the measure was needed to
salvage the education of children who aren't learning English
quickly enough, spending years in Spanish-language classes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If our initiative passes tonight, and it looks like it will,
it will be a tremendous victory for the people of California and
all of California's immigrant children,'' said Silicon Valley
entrepreneur Ron Unz, who drafted the initiative. ``They are the
ones who will benefit the most.''
</P>
<P>
   The measure faced broad opposition from educators for taking
away the ability of individual school districts to decide how to
educate children with limited English skills. Opponents also
complained it could damage such kids by throwing them into
English-only classes before they understood the language.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bad idea for all limited-English students,'' said Laura
Ferreiro, spokeswoman for the Mexican American Legal Defense and
Educational Fund. ``It would eliminate all flexibility that schools
have to teach these kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Another hotly debated statewide measure, Proposition 226, was
caught in a virtual dead heat. Voters appeared divided over the
proposal to require labor unions to have written permission from
their members before spending dues on political causes.
</P>
<P>
   Proposition 223, which would limit spending on administrative
costs in schools, was too close to call. The 95/5 measure would
impose a financial penalty on California public school districts
that do not limit their central administrative costs to a maximum
of 5 percent of their total district budget.
</P>
<P>
   Like earlier statewide initiatives that focused on immigration
and other racially or ethnically sensitive issues, the drive to
modify bilingual education provoked strong emotions among backers
and opponents.
</P>
<P>
   But support for the initiative did not follow strict ethnic
lines with many Latino parents strongly supporting the measure in
polls.
</P>
<P>
   Proposition 227 still might face the same legal hurdles that
have tripped up other hotly contested ballot measures. Several
groups, including United Teachers Los Angeles and the Mexican
American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, are considering legal
challenges.
</P>
<P>
   Organized labor mounted a vigorous campaign against Proposition
226, fearful that it would undercut the political vitality of
unions by hamstringing their political spending.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans, led by Gov. Pete Wilson, described it as a
matter of fairness, to guarantee that no worker represented by a
union would have a portion of his or her earnings deducted and
spent for political purposes against the wishes of the employee.
</P>
<P>
   Organized labor, and the Democrats it often supports, blasted
the proposition as a way to destroy their ability to raise funds.
The measure's backers, they said, want to muzzle the political
voice of workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people are not interested in the slightest in protecting
workers' paychecks -- they're interested in taking labor out of the
picture,'' said Steve Blazak, communications director for United
Teachers Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   In a demonstration of just how seriously UTLA took the threat,
Blazak said the organization had been forced to spend on
Proposition 226 most of the money it otherwise would have spent
fighting the bilingual education initiative.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the monster at the gates,'' Blazak said.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the fight over spending on administrative costs by
school districts had drawn relatively little public attention. But
Proposition 223, which would force many districts to sharply rein
in their outlays for administrative functions, has alarmed many
school district officials and leaders who see it as a financial
nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents expressed worry that the measure, created by UTLA to
target the Los Angeles Unified School District, would seriously
damage small school districts, which contend that they already have
relatively few administrators and therefore would be hard-pressed
to make cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a local battle UTLA was having with their own district,
and unfortunately, it applies to everyone in the state,'' said
Wayne Johnson, campaign consultant for Parents, Teachers and
Educators for Local Control, a group opposing the measure.

FORMER SONICS COACH CELEBRATES `GREAT RUN' WITH FANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first thing George Karl asked for was a cold bottle of Coors
Light. His second request was for closure.
</P>
<P>
   Karl, appearing carefree and somewhat content, hosted a party at
Floyd's Place Tuesday night. Between gulps, Karl jibed with media
and captivated a capacity crowd of fans.
</P>
<P>
   If it was Karl's intention to show that being labeled a ``former
Sonic coach'' hasn't worn on him, he played the part well.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I want to do is clear it up, get it over with and close,''
Karl said with an euphoric grin. ``I want to celebrate a good
run.''
</P>
<P>
   Karl entertained reporters for the first time since the Sonics'
playoff run ended May 12. He sat on a stool in a private section of
Floyd's Place with a pool table directly in front of him. Just 15
feet away was the occasional roar of fans, who came to pay tribute.
</P>
<P>
   Karl was forthright, witty and cheeky _ all the reasons Sonic
president Wally Walker cited last week while announcing the team
would not rehire Karl as coach.
</P>
<P>
   Walker had intimated that Karl was the source of many ``leaks''
within the organization. But Karl said hardly a bad word about
Walker.
</P>
<P>
   Given a chance to guess who will succeed him as Sonics coach,
Karl rolled off the name of Sonic legend Lenny Wilkens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lenny Wilkens has a Wally Walker feel to me,'' Karl said in
speculating about the Atlanta Hawks coach, who has four years left
on his current contract.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt, Karl and Walker were toxic toward the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime a relationship breaks down, it's a 50-50 thing,'' said
Karl, refusing to get specific. `` ... I have trouble with (blaming
me). I have to be honest with myself. I know that's gotten me in
trouble at times. But it's also earned me respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Karl won 72 percent of his regular-season games as Sonic coach.
But he had one Finals appearance, two first-round exits and two
second-round losses in seven postseason appearances with the
Sonics. Plus, his ``foibles'' drove Walker crazy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt pressure all year long. I felt if we went on a
five-game losing streak, we would get fired,'' Karl said. `` ...
Once we finished the season, the best business option for me was to
become a free agent anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was clear that (Walker) and I couldn't continue. (Team
owner) Barry Ackerley decided on Wally, and I respect that. It's
time to move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Although at no time did Karl seem bitter, he responded with a
simple ``no'' when asked if he could accept Walker's reason for
letting him go.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was funny when he said it wasn't personal,'' Karl
said later with a little prodding. ``Then he tried to divide the
team and me.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker made strong overtures about Karl's system wearing thin in
the playoffs. Walker questioned whether the trapping and pressure
defense could produce a title.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love my system,'' Karl said. ``I see teams stealing from us.
Pressure defense ... that wins everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Where Karl will wind up is anyone's guess. He has permission to
talk with the Denver Nuggets and Los Angeles Clippers, but Karl has
yet to do so. Other teams interested in Karl must get permission
from the Sonics, since Karl remains under contract until July 1.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Karl seems resigned to wait. He will play golf, hang
out and enjoy himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a sad time,'' Karl said. ``I've had a great run.
I'm juiced about coaching ... and I've got one more run in me.''

DAVIS ESCAPES DEMOCRATIC PACK TO FACE LUNGREN IN NOVEMBER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Will also move in the ``n'' California news file.) 
BY PAUL HEFNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ Rejecting a well-heeled airline executive and a
three-term congresswoman, Democratic voters _ aided by an unknown
number of crossover Republican votes in the open primary _ picked
party stalwart Lt. Gov. Gray Davis to take on GOP Attorney General
Dan Lungren in the fall campaign for governor.
</P>
<P>
   Once written off for lacking the campaign cash to keep pace with
Northwest Airlines executive Al Checchi or Rep. Jane Harman,
D-Torrance, Davis apparently won voters over with the slogan
``experience money can't buy.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis grabbed a sizable lead that grew into a landslide as more
votes were counted, with Checchi falling to a distant second and
Harman trailing in third place.
</P>
<P>
   ``The name `open primary' is really fitting,'' Davis said in a
victory speech at the Biltmore Hotel in Los Angeles. ``You've
opened your hearts and you've opened your minds to me and I will be
eternally grateful.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Republican side of the primary, Lungren breezed ahead of
four minor candidates. In a speech to supporters in Newport Beach,
Lungren said his campaign would press for school choice for
parents, cutting the crime rate and reduction of the state's car
tax.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a huge surplus in the state of California right now,''
Lungren said. ``I define a surplus as the government taking more
money from hard-working taxpayers than (it) should have. Some
portion of that should be returned to the rightful owners, the
people of the state of California.''
</P>
<P>
   Lungren also said Tuesday's results were a strong signal against
campaigns centered around 30-second television spots.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like virtual campaigning is not the campaigning of
the future for the state of California,'' he said. ``People want to
see their candidates, they want to hear from their candidates.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis said his top priority would be improvement of the state's
public schools, but he also touched on fighting crime, keeping
California's economy humming and protecting the environment.
</P>
<P>
   And he harkened back to the days before Republicans took over
the governor's office.
</P>
<P>
   ``The time has come to put an end to 16 years of stagnation,''
Davis said. ``It's time for us to move again, time for us to grow
again and time for us to aspire to do great things again.''
</P>
<P>
   Harman conceded defeat Tuesday night and pledged to help Davis
in his effort to defeat Lungren.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winning is more fun, but losing with honor ain't bad,'' Harman
told supporters. ``We ran a positive campaign, the only kind I have
ever run. We addressed the critical issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Partisan spin doctors were already giving their candidates the
edge in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to win,'' said Mike Madrid, political director for
the California Republican Party. ``Gray Davis is one of the last
liberal lions in California. It's basically a choice between Dan
Lungren and a Jerry Brown. That's the kind of contrast we want.''
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats said they believe Lungren is vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lungren has the six troubles,'' said Bob Mulholland, a
political adviser for the Democratic Party. ``Choice, education,
the environment, tobacco, assault weapons and Saturday night
specials. He's wrong on all those issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Mulholland also said that Democrats would focus on education in
the fall campaign, and blame 16 years of Republican governorship
for the disrepair of California's public schools.
</P>
<P>
   But Madrid countered that Republicans back charter schools and
other reform measures popular with parents _ and opposed by
teachers unions that support Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   And Lungren wins with voters with his tough-on-crime approach,
Madrid said. ``Dan Lungren owns the crime issue,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lungren enjoyed a free ride in the primary, facing only token
GOP opposition and assured of his party's nomination at the outset
of the campaign. He began advertising early _ due to uncertainty
over the new blanket primary, and because of appeals to
conservatives by some Democrats _ but Lungren emerged unscathed
compared to the Democratic nominee.
</P>
<P>
   In the bruising three-way Democratic primary, Davis, 55,
campaigned on his experience in California politics.
</P>
<P>
   One of his television ads lifted a line from a San Francisco Bay
Area newspaper which called him ``perhaps the best-trained
governor-in-waiting the state ever produced.''
</P>
<P>
   A Vietnam-era Army officer, the New York-born Davis was chief of
staff to Gov. Jerry Brown from 1974 to 1981.
</P>
<P>
   He then moved to the state Legislature, spending two terms in
the Assembly before winning his first statewide race in 1986 as
controller. He held that post until his election to the lieutenant
governor's job in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   But some experts credited missteps by Davis's primary opponents
for his success.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up until now, Davis has risen not because he has run a
particularly skilled campaign, but because Harman and Checchi have
blundered from one mistake to another,'' said Republican campaign
strategist Dan Schnur.

DODGERS CAN GET NO RELIEF IN LOSS
</HEADLINE>
 THROUGH-LADN (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARC J. SPEARS  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ On the night the Randy Johnson rumors finally
ended, the facts remained clear. The Dodgers need help in their
bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, after learning that Johnson was staying in
Seattle, the Dodgers dropped their fourth straight when reliever
Jim Bruske allowed a two-out, three-run homer to Brian Jordan in
the eighth inning of a 7-4 loss to the Mark McGwire-less St. Louis
Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan was the first batter Bruske faced after replacing Darren
Dreifort, the pitcher the Dodgers refused to send to Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   On the third pitch, Jordan made the crowd of Dodger Stadium
crowd of 36,367 forget McGwire, the major-league home run leader
(27), who will miss the series with back spasms.
</P>
<P>
   He also reminded the Dodgers (27-30) that they are getting no
relief from their bullpen. Over the weekend closer Scott Radinsky
blew two save attempts against the Cincinnati Reds. And the club
will not be getting Baltimore reliever Armando Benitez, whose name
was mentioned in a trade for deposed Dodger Hideo Nomo.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we (still) need is subjective,'' Dodgers executive vice
president Fred Claire said. ``We haven't settled down after
everything that happened. I believe in this club.'
</P>
<P>
   For Jordan, who leads the National League in hitting (.378), it
was his first homer since May 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Jordan) was sitting on a curveball and he got one,'' said
Bruske, who has appeared in a team-high 25 games. ``(The bullpen
is) struggling a little right now, but we haven't lost our
confidence.'
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers blew a 4-0 lead that was built by three of the four
ex-Marlins who were acquired in a May 15 blockbuster trade. The
Dodgers are just 8-8 since making the move.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Bonilla, dropped from cleanup to the sixth spot after
batting just .237 in his first 15 games with the Dodgers, gave the
club a 1-0 lead with an RBI single in the second.
</P>
<P>
   An out later, Charles Johnson made it 3-0 when he hit a two-run
homer into the left-field seats on a 1-2 pitch from St. Louis
starter Kent Mercker. Johnson, who had a career-high 19 homers last
season, hit his third in the past four games and now has 10 this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Sheffield, who has 11 RBI since joining the Dodgers, made
it 4-0 on a sacrifice fly in the third inning.
</P>
<P>
   But that was not enough for Dreifort, who said he was not
affected by the trade talks that involved him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those things happen upstairs, not down here,' Dreifort said.
``It is not like I've been thinking, `God if I pitch good I'm going
to Seattle, or if I pitch bad I'm going to Seattle.' It really
hasn't bothered me at all.''
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis was another matter.
</P>
<P>
   In the first four innings, Dreifort (3-5) got out of two jams
and showed why the Dodgers front office refused to make him a
Mariner. But the former reliever, who came in with a three-game
winning streak, struggled in the middle innings as he did earlier
this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals scored four runs in the fifth to tie the game.
Despite striking out a career-high eight batters in 72/3 innings,
Dreifort walked six and allowed six runs and nine hits.
</P>
<P>
   Mercker (7-2), who threw a no-hitter at Dodger Stadium with the
Atlanta Braves in 1993, recovered from his early problems, pitched
seven innings and did not allow a run after the third..
</P>
<P>
   ``I pitched (badly),'' Dreifort said. ``I walked six and how
many of them scored (three)? I made bad pitches and I failed to
make my adjustments.''

<P>
   BALTIMORE _ The Seattle Mariners last night ended 10 days of
Randy Johnson trade rumors with a surprise _ by vowing not to trade
him. But the baseball team wouldn't comment on whether trade or
contract talks regarding their star pitcher might resurface before
the end of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Randy Johnson is a valued member of the Mariners who is under
contract for the balance of the 1998 season,'' M's President Chuck
Armstrong said in a statement issued after yesterday's 9-8 loss to
the Orioles here. ``Randy will pitch for the Mariners throughout
this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Accordingly, we have no plans to trade Randy Johnson. The club
will have no further comment on Randy's status with the club.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if those ``plans'' could change, Armstrong said: ``I'm not
going to engage in further talk. The statement speaks for itself
and I have no further comment. That's all we're saying.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong also refused to comment on whether ownership would
reverse the decision it made last November and offer the winningest
pitcher in franchise history a contract extension.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who will be 35 on Sept. 10, is in the option year of a
four-year, $24 million contract and eligible for free agency at the
end of the season. He is due to start tonight at the Kingdome when
the M's open a two-game series against the Anaheim Angels.
</P>
<P>
   Although Armstrong called reports of trade talks
``unsubstantiated rumors'' in the opening line of his statement,
Los Angeles Dodgers officials acknowledged the team had given the
Mariners a final trade proposal yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers offered right-handed pitcher Ismael Valdes and
infielder-outfielder Wilton Guerrero for Johnson, who repeatedly
has asked to be traded since the M's refused to offer a contract
extension in November.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners originally asked the Dodgers for right-hander
Darren Dreifort, but the Dodgers refused and countered with Valdes,
agreeing to include either outfielders Todd Hollandsworth, Roger
Cedeno or Guerrero in the swap.
</P>
<P>
   The National League club finally settled on Valdes and Guerrero,
giving the Mariners a noon deadline yesterday to consummate the
trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had come to the decision that this had dragged on too
long,'' said Dodgers general manager Fred Claire. ... ``I told him
to call me back before 4 p.m. if he had any further thoughts. He
called me and said they were not going to trade Randy Johnson.''
</P>
<P>
   A source close to the Mariners said the organization was divided
on the proposal and that team ownership, fearing a public relations
nightmare, nixed the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was heading back to Seattle on the team's charter flight
last night when the M's made their announcement. But his agent,
Barry Meister, said he was disappointed that the deal with the
Dodgers collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, at this point, it's the right time for Randy to move
on,'' said Meister from his Chicago-area home. ``I would just like
to say the media and all of the other parties involved could have
handled this situation with a lot more dignity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way it played out showed very little regard for Randy and
his family. Through no doing of his own, he has been the subject of
a lot of rumors that were unsubstantiated.
</P>
<P>
   ``No person should be forced to go through what Randy has gone
through the past 10 days. The whole process has been difficult for
him. ... They could have put an end to this long ago instead of
having him twist in the wind.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked if Johnson would be willing to listen to a contract
extension offer, Meister said, ``I haven't even spoken to him about
that, but I think Randy's feelings on that subject are well
documented.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson has said it would be difficult, if not impossible, to
put everything behind him and extend his career with the Mariners
to a 10th season.
</P>
<P>
   He was acquired from the Montreal Expos in 1989, along with
pitchers Gene Harris and Brian Holman, for pitchers Mark Langston
and Mike Campbell. The deal is regarded as the best trade in
Mariners history.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, nicknamed ``The Big Unit'' because of his 6-foot-10
frame, developed into the most dominating major-league pitcher this
decade.
</P>
<P>
   His 105-44 record from 1991 to 1997 is the best among active
pitchers; he led the American League in strikeouts four consecutive
seasons (1993-96); won the AL Cy Young Award in 1995, finishing
second in '93 and '97; entered this season with more strikeouts
(1,845) than any active pitcher; pitched the franchise's first
no-hitter (1990); and struck out 19 batters twice last season.
</P>
<P>
   But so far, this has been his worst season in the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, admittedly distracted by the trade talks that began six
months ago and lasted into spring training, is 5-3 with a 5.47
earned run average.
</P>
<P>
   He won his last two starts, striking out 27 Tampa Bay Devil Ray
batters in 17 innings, demonstrating the emotion that helped
generate his success.
</P>
<P>
   Will that change now that he hasn't been traded?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Randy's job is to get prepared to pitch every fifth
day and everything else will take care of itself,'' Meister said.
</P>

 ENTERTAINMENT SUMMARY No 388 - JUNE 3, 1998  
<TEXT>
<P>
   1. HARRISON FORD : STARDOM WITH A SHRUG Harrison Ford can justly
claim to be the most popular movie star in the world, with more
than $2 billion in tickets sold. But in his latest film, Ford steps
away from his recent string of action-hero performances for a
romantic comedy/drama opposite Anne Heche - ``Six Days, Seven
Nights.'' Ford talks about the new movie, why he found it no
problem to be playing a romantic lead opposite one of Hollywood's
highest-profile lesbians, why he doesn't plan to ``stretch'' into
more atypical roles and why he expects to reappear as Jack Ryan and
Indiana Jones, but is just as happy not to be involved in the new
``Star Wars'' films. By Cindy Pearlman. 1,400 words + photo.

   2. JIM CARREY : A WILD MAN'S WALK ON THE SERIOUS SIDE Jim
Carrey's newest film, ``The Truman Show,'' is at once a typical,
eye-bulging Carrey special and something much more profound.
Directed by Australian visionary Peter Weir, it's the offbeat saga
of a man who learns that his whole world has been an artificial set
for a television show about him. Carrey talks about the new film,
the challenge of working with an internationally respected director
such as Weir, the art of balancing his madcap persona with his own
desire to stretch as an actor and why he himself often feels
imprisoned within a television program. By David Kronke. From
Canadian TV Guide. 1,300 words + photo.

   3. PETER WEIR : A ONE-OF-A-KIND DIRECTOR STEERS
</P>
<P>
   ``THE TRUMAN SHOW.'' Peter Weir may not be the world's richest
film director, but many observers think he is its most interesting
one. In films from ``Picnic at Hanging Rock'' (1975) and
``Witness'' (1985) to ``Dead Poets Society'' (1989) and his latest,
``The Truman Show,'' the Australian-born director has proven
himself a world-class master. Weir talks about the new movie, the
challenge of controlling zany star Jim Carrey, why he thinks film
directors are like mountain climbers and why he doesn't really care
if his film is a hit. By Ian Spelling. 1,400 words + photo.

   4. THE MAGIC WORDS Magic Johnson ruled the basketball court for
more than a decade. Now, with the June 8 launch of his TV show
``The Magic Hour,'' he's trying to capture the talk-show world as
well. Johnson talks about the show, his struggles to master the art
of the talk show, how new drugs have enabled him to get the upper
hand in his battle with AIDS and why the quintessential talk-show
guest thinks he may be just as good a host. By Frank Sanello. 1,400

   6. SANDRA BULLOCK KEEPS ``HOPE'' ALIVE It was the big action hit
``Speed'' that made Sandra Bullock a star, and the big action dud
``Speed 2 : Cruise Control'' that almost derailed her career. Now
she is looking for a hit in ``Hope Floats,'' a throw-back to the
lush, romantic women's films of old Hollywood. Bullock plays an
aging beauty queen who, when her marriage crumbles, returns to her
small Texas hometown and her larger-than-life mother, searching for
happiness. ``It's definitely a woman's piece,'' Bullock agrees. ``A
lot of men have a strong reaction to it one way or another. I was
so scared about that at first, but then again, when they're making
``Godzilla,'' do you think they're thinking about the women?
........'' By concentrating on work she deems vital to her own
happiness, Bullock has been able to weather the inevitable storms.
By Joshua Mooney. BPI Entertainment News Wire. 1,000 words.
_______________________________________________________________ 7.
LIVING TO THE BEAT ``The Last Days of Disco,'' the latest film by
writer-director Whit Stillman, finds its lifeblood in the disco
beat. Set during the early 1980s, it tells the stories of recent
college graduates and other young New Yorkers trying to make their
way in the city as disco was waning not only as popular music, but
as a way of life. Although its disco rhythm is important to this
film, Stillman believes the central story of people trying to find
personal and professional happiness in the big city ``could have
taken place any time in the last 50 years.'' By Renee Graham. From
The Boston Globe. 1,400 words.

DATA GENERAL LAYS OFF 400 WORKERS
</HEADLINE>
 
(Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  (For use by New York Times News Service clients) 
 By HIAWATHA BRAY   c.1998 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The price wars that staggered the computer industry took another
swipe at Data General Corp. The company Monday laid off 400 workers
_ 150 in Massachusetts _ and said it would take a $125 million
charge as it abandons the manufacturing of low-end server
computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prices have dropped so fast,'' said Data General's chief
executive, Ronald Skates, adding, ``we're just not going to be in a
position to design these products for ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Skates said, Westborough-based Data General will focus
solely on producing high-end server and data storage systems, which
bring in fatter profit margins than do low-end models.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1989, Data General, once among the hardware industry's
hottest companies, has slashed its work force from 18,000 to 5,100
as the industry has shifted to meet the rising popularity of
personal computers. Until recently, there was reason to believe
that the bloodletting at Data General was over and a turnaround had
begun. Prior to last quarter, it had reported 10 straight quarterly
profits, and booming sales of servers and data storage systems.
</P>
<P>
   But recently, prices for low-end servers have softened. Servers
are used to store or transfer information among PCs in a network.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we've seen in the last six to nine months is a lot of
pricing pressure, because demand has certainly fallen off,'' said
Peter Lieu, an industry analyst at Adams Harkness &AMP; Hill Inc. in
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Lieu said that Dell Computer Corp. is one of the few firms able
to grow market share and revenues, further squeezing weaker players
like Data General.
</P>
<P>
   Skates said that Data General will continue to offer a full
range of Aviion servers running the Unix and Microsoft Windows NT
operating systems. But lower-cost Aviion machines will be
manufactured for Data General by other companies. Skates declined
to say which firms would provide the machines, though he ruled out
the possibility that Compaq Computer Corp. would be among them.
Compaq is in the midst of acquiring Maynard-based Digital Equipment
Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Data General said it will also abandon its Thiin Line Internet
server products. These are low-cost Web server computers designed
for use by small businesses. According to Skates, the company found
that relatively few customers wanted the small, cheap servers,
while customers with major Internet sites preferred the high-end
machines.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the restructuring, Data General will transfer
about 100 employees to its Clariion data storage business unit.
Skates said that there was no room in the company for another 400
employees who designed and built the Thiin Line and low-end Aviion
systems.
</P>
<P>
   The job cuts will leave Data General with about 4,700 employees,
including 1,650 in Massachusetts. Skates lamented the layoffs,
saying that they would cost the company many talented engineers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something we hated to do,'' he said, ``but we had no
choice.''
</P>
<P>
   The stock price of Data General declined 5/8 Monday in trading
on the New York Stock Exchange, closing at 14 5/8.
</P>
<P>
   Data General in April reported a $4.5 million loss in its second
fiscal quarter, ending March 31 _ its first in 2 1/2 years. But
Skates says that loss was unrelated to the layoffs. ``If we had
made a lot of money in the last quarter, we'd have taken this same
action,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Skates blamed the loss on delays in bringing out a new line of
Clariion data storage devices. The new systems use a system called
Fibre Channel, which allows fast transfers of data between
computers and disk storage systems. Skates said that the full line
of products is now available.
</P>
<P>
   Skates said that although Aviion sales have continued to grow,
the company couldn't find a way to make money on the low-end Aviion
servers.
</P>
<P>
   According to a report issued Monday by International Data Corp.
in Framingham, overall unit sales of servers dropped 11 percent
both in the United States and worldwide during the first quarter of
1998. Because of lower sales and lower prices, there was a 17
percent decline in revenue from US server sales, and a worldwide
decline of 15 percent.

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   &HT;    Web offers alluring sites for fishing enthusiasts
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Your next fishing partner may have a 17-inch screen
and a keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   Now that regular folks _ people like you and me _ use computers
and the Internet on a daily basis, Web sites do a much better job
of representing the non-technical side of life. Take fishing, for
instance. You'll find literally hundreds of sites that offer
fishing reports for lakes in your area; tell you about the hottest
lures; and offer advice for experts and beginners as well.
</P>
<P>
   A good place to start is at a Web site called The Fishing
Network at http://www.iwn.com/fishing.html. Because this is a
national site, you start by clicking on the section of the country
where you live. Besides offering fishing tips for that section of
the country, you'll find some links that would be helpful to most
fishermen, including ways to get local weather conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Another good general interest site is called The World of
Fishing at http://www.fishingworld.com/. Some of the news stories
and information here seems to be aimed at the professional bass
fishermen and those who follow the action at bass tournaments. But
there are also sections that offer listings of fishing guides and
others that take you to classified ads for used fishing equipment.
There also are links to the sites of several manufacturers of
fishing equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The most helpful part of this site is the section that offers
forums on various types of fishing and fishing-related information.
You'll be able to use these forums to discuss subjects such as
lures, outboard motors and fishing spots with other anglers. And if
there is anything fishermen like as well as fishing, it's talking
about fishing.
</P>
<P>
   Fly-fishing can almost seem like a separate sport. Avid
fly-fishermen often look down their noses at those who merely drown
worms. And learning to fly-fish is a lot more difficult, too. But
the rewards are enormous for those who enjoy it. The art of making
a delicate cast to just the right place is almost as much fun as
catching a fish.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon is famous for some great fly-fishing rivers including the
Rogue, McKenzie, Smith and Umpqua. So an Oregon-based site called
the McKenzie Page is a terrific place to go. You'll find it at
http://zebu.uoregon.edu/cgi-bin2/Mckenzie/Mckfrontend.pl. A lot of
the information is specific to Oregon rivers, but you'll also find
some general information, including some great photography of
flies.
</P>
<P>
   Today's final site _ Flyfishing.com at http://www.flyfishing.com
_ is much more general in nature and has lots of instructional
material for beginners and seasoned fly-fishermen.
</P>
<P>
   One especially good feature of the site is the database of
information about various flies. Even veteran fly-fishermen will
enjoy looking through the many attempts to create a lure that looks
just right to a trout.

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   &HT;    Mac Report: Software makers hold key to Macintosh's fate
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Apple Computer faces no greater challenge than wooing
software developers back to the Macintosh. It is they who will make
or break this computer.
</P>
<P>
   With useful, entertaining and progressive software, the Mac will
thrive again. It won't matter how terrific a Mac looks if no one
wants to write software for the platform.
</P>
<P>
   Without developer support, the Mac will be like a jilted suitor,
all dressed up with nowhere to go.
</P>
<P>
   The problem isn't there is no software for the Mac. Apple
Computer counts some 12,000 existing titles. Yet this number is
misleading.
</P>
<P>
   It says nothing about the vibrancy of the market, how many
titles are new, how many are regularly improved. Software grows old
fast.
</P>
<P>
   Herein lies the problem. Two years ago, 70 percent of all
developers wrote either original Mac titles or Mac versions of
Windows software. Today, that number has dwindled to 20 percent.
That means a lot of those 12,000 titles are getting long in the
tooth.
</P>
<P>
   A vibrant, continually renewing roster of software titles is
especially important in the home market. Its growth has been driven
by exciting new computer games.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, most game developers are not writing for the Mac _ sadly,
for good reason. It's very difficult to sell Mac titles.
</P>
<P>
   Take id Software, developer of the popular shoot-'em-up game
``Quake.'' It did a Mac version of the original game but sold only
50,000 copies. Not surprisingly, it didn't bother with a Mac
version of ``Quake II.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Every month I take a look at the number of Mac titles sold,
and it is not good,'' says Luc Barthelet, general manager of game
maker Maxis. ``Sales are still declining month to month.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Barthelet has not decided yet whether Maxis
will release a Mac version of its upgrade to ``SimCity,'' scheduled
for release next fall.
</P>
<P>
   Maxis is not alone. Scores of developers never even bother with
a Mac version of their games. And many of those who do wait a year
or more before releasing Mac versions.
</P>
<P>
   That means Mac users rarely can play the hottest games on the
market. They're second-class citizens in this arena.
</P>
<P>
   This is a problem that must be solved. Apple Computer thinks the
key is its sizable presence in schools. It's nice that Apple
Computer continues to be the largest supplier to the educational
market, but this means little to kids.
</P>
<P>
   What they want at home is not the same computer as in school but
one that plays the most and the newest hot games. Unfortunately,
Macs are a distant second in this contest.

 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It looks like Windows 98 will be released on
Microsoft's original schedule of June 25. My guess is that the
publicity about the company's problems with the Justice Department
will end up hyping sales.
</P>
<P>

so many headlines must be danged important. So my job today is to
be a real TechnoBuddy and urge you not to rush to buy Windows
during the first month or so.

   This has nothing at all to do with the merits of Windows 98.
Sooner or later, you'll upgrade. But there are compelling reasons
to wait out the initial rush to install the newest version of
Windows.
</P>
<P>
   First, you can expect the technical support telephone lines at
both Microsoft and even at retailers will be jammed with calls for
help during the first few weeks Windows 98 is available.
</P>
<P>
   Installing a new operating system is like dumping two jigsaw
puzzles into one box and then trying to separate them. There are
literally thousands of chances for conflicts with installed
programs and hardware devices. You can bet lots of folks will be on
the phone in the days after Windows 98 is available trying to put
the pieces of the puzzle back together.
</P>
<P>
   If you wait a month or so, the initial rush should calm down and
you'll have a better chance of getting help by telephone. Remember
that _ worst case _ you can put your computer out of commission
when you install any new operating system. So unless you're
prepared to get sore ears while you're on hold waiting for help,
then don't join the initial rush.
</P>
<P>
   Second, while all companies _ including Microsoft _ do the best
they can to test new software for bugs, there will be some
unpleasant surprises when undiscovered flaws are discovered. All
new programs have enough bugs to populate a good-sized rotten log.
The beta testing program catches some of them, but when Windows 98
gets on the market, many more will be discovered. Let your friends
and neighbors find them, let Microsoft correct them, and then buy
Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   Now, let me make a safe assumption. Plenty of you are going to
ignore this advice. Heck, if the tables were turned, I might do
that, too. Some of us can't help getting caught up in the
excitement of trying something new that we've heard a lot about.
</P>
<P>
   So let's talk about some of the ways to protect yourself if you
do install Windows 98 in the first mad rush.
</P>
<P>
   The most important safeguard is to make a complete backup of
your hard disk. That way _ worst case _ you'll be able to put your
computer back the way it was before the installation. Windows 98
has an uninstall option that, in theory, will do the same thing.
But be safe and make a backup yourself.
</P>
<P>
   Also, follow the on-screen advice you'll get while you're
installing Windows 98 and take the options to make a recovery disk
as well as asking your computer to make a backup copy of your old
system files. Both of these steps can help you undo any problems
caused by the installation.
</P>
<P>
   OK. Follow my advice to wait a while if you can. And if you
insist on walking the high-tech tightrope, at least use a safety
net.

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   &HT;    Tech Report: 200 CDs, accessible by a touch
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's not so much trouble to reach for the stack of
compact discs, pick the one you suddenly have a hankering for, pop
it into the CD player and hit play. But wouldn't it be nice to just
tap the CD player and have that tune start playing?
</P>
<P>
   You can, if you have every single CD you own sitting in the CD
player. And you can have that if you have the cash to buy one of
the new Kenwood 200-disc CD mega-changers. One of the key
advantages CD technology has over tapes and records is random
access _ the ability to play the track you want without first
listening to a bunch of other stuff. The new Kenwood line means to
take that idea one step further by making the CD player your
storage unit as well.
</P>
<P>
   What if you have in mind a musical feeling, but you really don't
want to spend a long time picking out individual tunes? Each of the
new Kenwoods includes a memory function that lets users fill in
data about each disc, designating one of 26 pre-programmed
categories (rock, jazz, classical, etc.). Then if you wake up
Sunday morning and want to hear Sam and Dave, Aretha, Otis or the
Temptations, you just let the machine ``shuffle'' through the
Motown genre.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, if you want to play DJ for friends dropping
by late some night, you can program up to 32 consecutive tracks
that slide from Betty Carter to Frank Sinatra to Lena Horne to
Percy Sledge. Choose from any track among the up to 200 CDs loaded
in the machine.
</P>
<P>
   Kenwood has four machines in the 200-CD class, ranging from $230
to $500 in list price. The top of the line, the CD-2280M, can play
two discs simultaneously and send the audio to separate rooms. For
more information, contact Kenwood USA, Box 22745, Long Beach,
Calif. 90801.
</P>
<P>
   Burn your own
</P>
<P>
   The urge to make your own CDs is also gaining increased
momentum.
</P>
<P>
   It is still illegal, of course, to make those recordings and
sell them without a license from the owner of the songs.
</P>
<P>
   Most music aficionados have their own Greatest Hits collections
in their heads _ their own idea of what the best of Eric Clapton,
Miles Davis or Brahms would be. Digitization of music is making it
possible to put those theoretical Greatest Hits onto discs.
</P>
<P>
   For those with huge collections of vinyl they would love to put
on disc, or perhaps those who want to cherry-pick the tunes in
their own CD collections, then rearrange them in the right order,
there are CD recorders. Popular Science in its June issue offers a
primer on recording CDs, with sidelong glances at other formats
like DVD and mini-disc.
</P>
<P>
   But say you want to select from a much larger database than you
have on your shelves. How about choosing from tens of thousands of
songs? Then you might check out Custom Revolutions of Stamford,
Conn.
</P>
<P>
   The logic behind the company's business is the logic of Internet
commerce: the notion that billions of dollars in transactions will
soon be done over the Net. But the Net is not merely the conduit,
since the digital world of cyberspace makes possible many
arrangements that can play to consumer needs.
</P>
<P>
   At the Web site of Custom Revolutions
(http://www.customdisc.com), consumers are invited to select as
many or as few of the songs as they wish from the company library,
which the company says will eventually include about 100,000 tunes
it has licensed. Each 10-track CD costs $18 plus shipping, and
customers are also offered the option of ``personalizing'' the art
for the case. Browsers can listen to a 30-second clip from many of
the tunes before buying, the company says.
</P>
<P>
   Among the artists the company boasts so far is a fairly diverse
list, leaning heavily toward the oldies _ at least so far. Named by
the company are Buddy Guy, Charlie Parker, Hot Tuna, Jim Croce and
Nat King Cole.
</P>
<P>
   For information, visit the Custom Revolutions Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Stop and identify
</P>
<P>
   Just how picky are you about phone calls?
</P>
<P>
   Sure, we are all annoyed by that ill-timed call from a
telemarketer, eccentric uncle or neighborhood gossip artist _ not
to mention the boss. The question is, just how much screening do
you want your machines to do?
</P>
<P>
   And how many hoops do you demand a caller leap through before
you will deign to pick up your phone?
</P>
<P>
   Caller ID, which shows you the caller's number as the phone
rings, is the most obvious option and is available from your local
phone company for a monthly charge. But maybe that is not enough
for you.
</P>
<P>
   If so, you might consider the Tele-Screen from the Edge Co. of
Brattleboro, Vt.
</P>
<P>
   Would you like callers to be greeted by a voice that says
``Please enter the four-digit pass code''? If the caller doesn't
have your code, the phone doesn't ring and the call is
disconnected.
</P>
<P>
   For information, call the Edge Co. (1-800-732-9976) or visit the
company's site (http://www.edgeco.com).
</P>
<P>
   VCR verbal
</P>
<P>
   The videocassette recorder, despite its near-ubiquity in the
homes of America, just might be the least understood of our most
well-used products. You can pop in a movie, but can you actually
record on your VCR? Can you set it to tape something next week?
</P>
<P>
   Zenith responds with the SpeakEZ feature, an addition to its
VCRs that the company says will actually talk you through the
process of recording. It works something like calling an office
voice mail.Bela Lugosi
</P>
<P>
   The cost of the machines with the feature ranges from $170 to
$250. For more information, visit the Zenith site on the Net
(http://www.zenith.com).

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   &HT;    Tech Tools: Family tree programs excel at different tasks
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Family Tree Maker is the giant of genealogy computer
programs, with more than 1 million copies sold. It is an excellent
program, but my wife, Donna, the genealogist, believes much of its
popularity comes from the wealth of information on the nine CDs
that come with the deluxe version.
</P>
<P>
   Her report:
</P>
<P>
   You get the Family Finder index (a list of 130 million people
who can be traced through birth, marriage, census and miscellaneous
records); the Social Security Death Index (birth and death dates,
Social Security number and last ZIP code for 54 million people);
and the World Family Tree (130 million people on family trees
submitted by 27,000 family researchers). Another 13 World Family
Tree discs are available, 18 in all.
</P>
<P>
   The newest version _ 4.4 _ comes with expanded online services.
You can search the Internet for every name in your file, add a
Family Tree Maker book to your home page and take advantage of a
free record lookup from Genealogy Research Associates.
</P>
<P>
   Setting a home page was easy _ and free. I included our
immigrants by surname, where they settled, when they immigrated and
where they came from.
</P>
<P>
   Although you can have the ``agents'' on Family Tree Maker's Web
page search for every name in your file, there wasn't much point to
look for all our Elizabeths who were listed only by given name. At
FTM's suggestion, I scaled my search down from 3,700 names to 185.
I will be notified by e-mail when matches turn up.
</P>
<P>
   Entering information is intuitive _ the family group screen
includes information on both the husband and wife: birth, death and
marriage dates, parents and children. You can also include sources,
notes and facts.
</P>
<P>
   The program will help you print your book, and even check it for
spelling. You choose which reports you want to include and in what
order. You can even request a table of contents and index. Most of
FTM's reports are excellent, but each time a new version comes out
I have to figure out all over again how to print an ancestor tree
with multiple pages.
</P>
<P>
   Family Tree Maker lured me back into genealogy a couple of years
ago. I've used it to gather, record and share information. However,
two other programs, Generations and Ultimate Family Tree, are also
good.
</P>
<P>
   Your choice pretty much comes down to which approach is right
for you. I would recommend Family Tree Maker (about $90) for anyone
whose primary interest is gathering material _ not only are the
World Family Tree discs rich in information, but the publisher,
Broderbund, offers another 100 databases of government and
historical records. Although much of the material on the World
Family Tree needs to be verified, it will give you a starting point
for your search.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimate Family Tree's premiere version is an ideal choice for
anyone whose emphasis is on organization and verification, and a
bargain at $60. The program not only lists sources but rates them:
Is the source primary or secondary, and is there corroborating
evidence?
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Generations should appeal to those who are interested
in producing a book, and it's also a bargain at $50. The reports
are outstanding and intuitive; I particularly like the fact that
Generations saves reports in my word processor.

High-Tech Systems Easy to Set Up 
By Jonathan Marshall c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  If computers
could speak, they'd beg to be networked whenever two or more
inhabit the same office.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Networks can pay huge dividends by letting employees swap files,
share printers and hop onto the Internet at will. But they used to
require expensive consultants, exotic hardware and complicated
software, making them something to avoid whenever possible.
</P>
<P>
   Improved technology has slashed the cost and complexity of
networks. Today, even an amateur can set up a network for a few
hundred dollars and a few hours' time.
</P>
<P>
   On the hardware side, a network requires two or more computers,
each with a network interface card inside. It needs a central box
called a ``hub'' to which the computers all connect. And it needs
cables to link the network cards to the hub. Computer catalogs and
stores are full of such devices these days.
</P>
<P>
   For software, a simple network needs only Windows 95 on every
PC. Earlier versions of Windows and DOS won't work without
additional software. (The Macintosh operating system works fine for
networking Macs.)
</P>
<P>
   For shared Internet use, add a ``router,'' a device which
connects the network hub with the Internet connection, such as a
regular phone line or higher speed, digital ISDN line. The router
lets several people surf the Web at the same time and protects the
network against unauthorized sabotage by hackers.
</P>
<P>
   An efficient network also centralizes files on one computer,
called a ``server,'' a sort of file lending library. Employees can
call up client records, accounting information, old correspondence
and other files off the server. Files can then be backed up daily
in one simple operation.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that none of this equipment costs much.
</P>
<P>
   The server, which is optional, is the most expensive item. A
fancy server, with huge amounts of disk storage, a backup tape
drive and a redundant power supply, can cost as much as $4,000. But
an ordinary Pentium computeris perfectly adequate and costs only
$1,000, putting it well within the price range of most small
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   If you are outfitting a new office with computers, buy them with
network interface cards already installed. Otherwise, you have to
open up the computer case, push the card into an empty slot, and
hope that Windows recognizes the card properly. It doesn't take a
Ph.D. to do the job.
</P>
<P>
   Buy so-called ``10/100'' cards, capable of operating at 100
megabits per second as well as the usual network speed of 10 Mbps,
just in case you ever need the extra performance. Such cards
typically cost $40 to $70 each.
</P>
<P>
   You'll also need one or more hubs to connect all your computers.
Make sure the hubs have a few more ``ports'' than you have
computers, to make room for growth. For example, if you have five
computers, buy an eight-port hub. That will give you the capacity
to connect three more computers in the future.
</P>
<P>
   An eight-port hub from a top brand, such as 3Com or Intel,
should retail for about $76; cheaper but still capable hubs from
Netgear, NDC or D-Link sell for as little as $59.
</P>
<P>
   All these companies have good reputations. Netgear's product
line, however, recently won an ``Editor's Choice'' award from PC
Magazine for ``the best combination of extensive offerings, low
pricing, ease of use, and excellent technical support.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, you'll need cables to connect the network cards to the
hub. Ask for so-called ``category 5'' wiring with RJ-45 connectors.
Such cables don't cost much and come in a variety of lengths.
</P>
<P>
   If you have only a handful of computers, you can save time
buying a simple networking kit from a company such as Netgear or
3Com's OfficeConnect division. The boxes have everything you need
to get started, including cables, cards, a hub and simple
instructions.
</P>
<P>
   If your employees are power users, sending big graphics files
over the network, consider buying a faster hub, called a 100Base-T
hub. These operate at 100 megabits per second, 10 times as fast as
usual. Catalogs sell them for $215 to $350 for an eight-port hub.
</P>
<P>
   For Internet access, many small businesses choose ISDN
connections for speedy Web browsing along with two phone lines for
voice conversations. ISDN routers, which let users share the same
ISDN line for Internet access, now cost under $500 and often come
with a small hub built in.
</P>
<P>
   If your network grows beyond 15 or 20 computers (even fewer, if
you get powerful network accounting packages or other heavy-duty
applications), you may need to consider a more complex
``client-server'' network with a powerful network operating system
such as Windows NT or Novell's Netware.
</P>
<P>
   Such operating systems are more robust than Windows 95, so your
network will be less prone to crash. And they come with many
powerful features, such as the ability to give users access to
certain files but not others.
</P>
<P>
   The downside is, client-server networks aren't for novices. To
set one up and maintain it, ask around for a consultant who comes
with good references.
</P>
<P>
   Before you rush out and hire a consultant, however, learn the
basics from one of several excellent primers, such as ``Networking
for Dummies'' by Doug Lowe (IDG Books) or ``Absolute Beginner's
Guide to Networking'' by Mark Gibbs and Todd Brown (Sams).
</P>
<P>
   Also, check out 3Com's informative Web site (http:/
/www.3com.com/smallbusiness /basics/calculator/index.html), which
includes information on how to obtain a free ``network benefits
calculator'' to help you estimate the potential productivity gains
of a network.

Networking for Profits 
By Jonathan Marshall c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  Monica Frei,
head of a Bay Area nanny placement service, had all the people
skills she needed to spot a good housekeeper, nanny or personal
assistant. But until recently she was almost too petrified even to
touch a computer.
<TEXT>
<P>
   That all changed last year when associates finally convinced her
to install a computer network in the three Bay Area offices of Town
and Country Nannies and Mothers In Deed. By themselves, the firm's
computers weren't any friendlier than before, but networked
together they became too powerful a business tool for Frei to
ignore.
</P>
<P>
   The network has made ``a huge, huge difference to our
business,'' Frei enthused, noting that employees now share files
and communicate far more effectively between offices. ``Our
efficiency and thoroughness have increased dramatically.''
</P>
<P>
   Small businesses all over America are discovering similar
benefits from letting their computers communicate together.
</P>
<P>
   A computer network lets employees swap files with the push of a
button instead of walking from room to room with floppy disks. It
lets them share a high-speed printer instead of wasting desk space
and money putting printers by every workstation. And it permits
everyone in the office to share Internet access without the expense
of multiple dial-up lines and accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Networks also let offices centralize files on one hard disk,so
safety backups become easy and routine rather than onerous and
infrequent.
</P>
<P>
   The message hasn't sunk in everywhere. Eighty percent of
America's 7 million small businesses (those with formal offices and
fewer than 100 employees) have computers, but only about a quarter
have a computer network, according to International Data Corp., a
market research firm.
</P>
<P>
   Many more would take the plunge if they listened to Frei. Until
last year, her employees had computers but mostly relied on paper
files. If a client came to the Larkspur office seeking a nanny
whose file was in San Francisco, the offices wound up faxing piles
of paperwork back and forth.
</P>
<P>
   And when new references came in on a prospective housekeeper or
nanny, or a placement worker got important leads on new clients,
word didn't always get out to employees in other offices.
</P>
<P>
   With much apprehension about cost and complexity, Frei finally
gave the green light to the installation of a computer network last
year. Now all 25 staffers in Palo Alto, San Francisco and Larkspur
can call up files and communicate with each other instantly by
interoffice data links.
</P>
<P>
   When one employee updates a nanny's file, the new information is
instantly available on a central computer, called a server, to
everyone in the company. E-mail messages now pass important tips to
the entire staff without delay. And the offices can now communicate
via the Internet more readily with clients in the technology
industry, for whom e-mail is second nature.
</P>
<P>
   Employees can also work from home or on the road by dialing into
the office network to retrieve files from the server. ``I'm
expecting my first baby in September, and I'm excited to know it's
possible to work from home,'' Frei said.
</P>
<P>
   Between the three offices, the network hardware and installation
cost about $12,000, including a new server. Frei said it ``has
already paid for itself ten-fold in the amount of time we save and
the things we don't miss by communicating efficiently.
</P>
<P>
   Even the tiniest offices can benefit from networks. Based in San
Rafael, the U.S. subsidiary of Novacart, an Italian maker of baking
molds, linked together its two computers at the beginning of the
year and has already reaped big rewards.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Miglia, head of the office, said his desk used to be covered
with paper jottings about possible customer leads and where to send
samples. When he did use his computer to produce a document, he had
to detach the printer from his assistant Sarah Eitel's computer, a
messy process. ``It was a disaster,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Then he hired a consultant to network the computers together.
Printing is now automatic. He and Eitel share files instantly, so
they can keep track of customer inquiries on a single computer
database. ``Now if Joe's bakery calls up, I know if they already
talked to her,'' Miglia said.
</P>
<P>
   The database also reminds him when to follow up sample shipments
with sales calls to customers, a process that used to be haphazard
at best.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our productivity is way up,'' Miglia said. ``I tell Sarah
almost once a week, God, this system is great.''
</P>
<P>
   Networks become even more essential as a business grows. Tom
Pelton discovered that last year as he added employees to
Micro-Metric, a San Jose firm that makes precise measurement
equipment for makers of hard disks and semiconductors.
</P>
<P>
   When Pelton worked out of a garage and handled sales and
accounting himself, he didn't need a network. But, recently, he
hired a bookkeeper, office manager, purchasing agent and three
programmers who need to work on common files. The only practical
solution was to put files on a central server and share them over
the network.
</P>
<P>
   Pelton hired T&AMP;R Communications in Milpitas to install the
network last year for under $15,000, including three computers, an
uninterruptible power supply and other equipment and support. Today
he can't imagine living without it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the time you aren't aware that it's there,'' Pelton
said. ``But without it, I'd have a mutiny.''
</P>
<P>
   After Pelton installed the network, he soon discovered another
big advantage: the ease of backing up files off a single server
rather than many separate computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the old days, each person was responsible for his own
backups,'' Pelton said. ``If I didn't back up or my secretary
didn't or a programmer didn't, we were in a hurtin' way. Now every
night we have a tape drive that sucks everything up off the server.
A month ago the hard drive on my computer crashed completely. At
first, I was blown away. Then I realized everything I care about is
backed up on the network (server).''
</P>
<P>
   To install networks without costly interruptions to their
business, many small firms rely on consultants. Owners should pick
consultants with care, relying on personal recommendations from
satisfied customers, said Michael Boorstein, a Marin-based network
consultant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many consultants are hanging out shingles these days with no
experience,'' he said. ``They hooked up two computers at home and
found it was easy, then get out into the real world and find
bazillions of problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Consultants typically charge anywhere from $80 to $125 an hour.
But jobs often take only a few hours. Boorstein got a network of 12
Pentium computers up and running at Spirit Rock meditation center
in Marin in just four hours. (The center already had network wiring
in place.)
</P>
<P>
   Relatively simple networks of that size can often be installed
by computer-savvy business owners or employees without the help of
a consultant.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely not rocket science anymore,'' said Jim Novack,
a Larkspur-based computer consultant. ``It's almost as simple as
plugging your telephone into a socket.''

How to Avoid Problems Related to Year 2000 By Arthur M.
Louis c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  There's been a lot of fuss
lately about the Year 2000 computer problem and its potentially
devastating effect on big business. But the glitch could easily
trip up small businesses as well _ something most of their
proprietors don't seem to realize.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Year 2000 problem stems from a shortcut used by computer
programmers in the 1960s and '70s to store only the last two digits
of a year _ ``74'' instead of ``1974,'' for example. It could cause
computers to read January 1, 2000 as January 1, 1900, which in turn
could bollix accounting, payroll, tax and customer billing records,
inventories and supplier relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel this is a very serious issue,'' said Dan Hill,
director of the Small Business Administration's office of
technology in Washington, D.C. ``Every small business should
address it.''
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of organizations _ including the SBA,
Microsoft, the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco and a host of
technology-service providers _ that are eager to help. But
businesses must make the first move, by seeking that help.
</P>
<P>
   A new study sponsored by Wells Fargo Bank found that 82 percent
of all small businesses are ``at risk'' for Year 2000-related
problems, yet fewer than a third are taking the matter seriously
enough to act.
</P>
<P>
   Many small businesses believe the problem can't affect them if
their computers are relatively new and they recently bought
programs off the shelf from established vendors such as Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   It's true that most modern hardware and software come free of
Year 2000 (Y2K) problems. But even these computer systems can
become contaminated, Hill warns, ``if you've modified your software
_ for example by bringing in a file you had before that was not
Y2K-compliant.''
</P>
<P>
   Year 2000 can even derail businesses that don't have computers.
Your cash register may malfunction because its embedded chips won't
recognize the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you have no Year 2000 problems of your own, your
business could come to a halt because your suppliers haven't solved
their own problems. A dry-cleaning establishment may find itself
unable to get cleaning solution from a supplier that has shut down
to debug its inventory controls.
</P>
<P>
   If you are an auto-parts distributor, and you've told your
computer that ABC Garage must pay its bill by February 2000, the
computer might conclude that the payment is a century overdue, and
grind out a nasty letter.
</P>
<P>
   Experts advise every small business to thoroughly assess its
potential exposure to Year 2000 glitches.
</P>
<P>
   Once you've ensured that you are Year 2000-compliant, that fact
can be a selling point among customers. If you guarantee them
hassle-free service into the next century, ``it could make you more
competitive than your rival down the street,'' said Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Some small businesses have in-house technical staffs that can
cope with Year 2000 problems. But most will have to go to outside
service providers.
</P>
<P>
   There is lots of useful written material that will help you
determine whether your business might be vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco has prepared a booklet
entitled ``Are You Ready to Do Business in the Year 2000?'' It
offers a thorough analysis of Year 2000 problems from the small
business viewpoint, discusses remedies and includes a list of 10
Web sites where you can find more details.
</P>
<P>
   The bank prefers that you read that document on its own Web site
at www.frbsf.org/fiservices/cdc, because its supply of booklets is
limited and so is its staff time. But if you don't have Web access
try calling (415) 974-2861.
</P>
<P>
   The SBA includes a wealth of useful Year 2000 advice on its Web
site at www.sba.gov. It also provides hotlinks to other expert
sources.
</P>
<P>
   Many small businesses may discover that the vendor that
installed their computer system has gone out of business.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's Web site will help you pick another firm to lead you
through the Year 2000 maze. The company has compiled a database of
230,000 nationwide _ searchable by ZIP code. Go to
www.microsoft.com/ smallbiz, and click on ``Find a Technology
Consultant.''
</P>
<P>
   Nigel Burton, Microsoft's director of small-business programs,
said the list has been thoroughly vetted by his company's staffers.
``We telephoned each one, and made sure they were all interested in
doing this work,'' he remarks.
</P>
<P>
   One of the 25 that Microsoft lists within 32 miles of The
Chronicle's building is All Systems Go, of Redwood City.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are auditing all 250 of our customers for Year 2000,'' said
Renee Courington, the company's president. It costs $1,000 to
$2,000 ``to have every system looked at, every piece of software
analyzed.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, when a computer system is hopelessly outdated, All
Systems suggests buying a new one. More often it recommends hiring
independent programmers to ``make patches.''

From Accounting to Faxing, Software Can Do It All for You 
By David Einstein c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  Personal
computers can't run your small business for you. But they can make
it a heck of a lot easier.
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the right software, you can accomplish just about any task,
from managing your finances to designing a company newsletter to
creating a Web site. It can save you time and money and put you in
control of your business in a way never before possible.
</P>
<P>
   Following is a rundown of software that benefits almost any
small business, along with examples of the most popular programs
available. In each case, the price given is for one copy of the
program designed for a computer running Windows 95, and, in some
cases, Windows NT. Many of the programs also are available for the
Macintosh. If you need more than one copy of a program, check with
the manufacturer. Many companies offer a discount on multiple
copies.
</P>
<P>
   Office Suites
</P>
<P>
   No matter what kind of business you run, you are going to need a
good word processor, a spreadsheet program for crunching numbers
and probably a database for tracking customers and /or inventory.
Fortunately, you can get all these together in what's known as an
office suite.
</P>
<P>
   The top-selling suite, not surprisingly, is Microsoft Office. It
comes in a Professional Edition and a Small Business Edition. The
Professional Edition includes Word and Excel, the most popular word
processor and spreadsheet, as well as Access, a powerful database,
and Outlook, a personal information manager. The suite goes for
$530.
</P>
<P>
   The Small Business Edition, priced at $470, lacks the database
but includes the Microsoft Publisher desktop publishing program and
Expedia Streets, a program that locates addresses and puts them on
a map.
</P>
<P>
   Other choices are SmartSuite from Lotus and WordPerfect 8 Suite
Professional from Corel. SmartSuite includes a word processor,
spreadsheet, database and personal information manager, and lists
for $400. Corel's suite, which doesn't have a database, costs $302.
</P>
<P>
   You can mix components from different suites, but there is
little point to this. For one thing, it will cost you a lot more to
get individual programs than you will pay for a complete suite
(Microsoft Access lists for $300 when bought separately.) And
programs from one company are not designed for tight integration
with those from another.
</P>
<P>
   Desktop Publishing
</P>
<P>
   No software can save your business as much time and money as a
desktop publishing program. You can design your own newsletters,
brochures, business cards and fliers. In many cases, the materials
you can produce on a good office printer will rival the results you
would get from an outside print shop.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft Publisher, mentioned earlier, which sells for under
$100 by itself, is easily the best publishing program in its class.
And for all but the most ambitious jobs, it is every bit as good as
high-end programs used by professional publishers.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to produce highly sophisticated material, such as a
book, guide or manual, consider purchasing one of the big boys _
Adobe PageMaker ($550) or QuarkXPress (about $600). Each can handle
full-color publications of any length. But bear in mind that they
are pretty complicated programs, and are not nearly as easy to use
as Publisher.
</P>
<P>
   Accounting
</P>
<P>
   Why hire an accountant when you can get accounting software that
will do the same thing for a lot less money? Two of the best
programs are QuickBooks from Intuit ($100) and Peachtree Accounting
from Peachtree Software ($120). Either can handle payrolls,
invoices, time sheets, accounts payable and receivable _ in short,
most accounting tasks.
</P>
<P>
   The programs do all the math for you, and even let you analyze
your financial picture. And the numbers they generate can be put
into popular tax programs, saving you lots of time come next April.
</P>
<P>
   QuickBooks and Peachtree Accounting have ready-to-use forms for
most financial procedures. But you might also consider a
specialized forms program such as Formtool Express from IMSI ($40).
It offers 250 forms that you can customize for your own business.
Another program, OmniForm from Caere ($146), lets you use a scanner
to turn paper forms into electronic ones.
</P>
<P>
   Faxing
</P>
<P>
   Almost every business these days conducts a lot of its
communications via the fax machine. With fax software, you can use
your PC to send and receive faxes. This can be a time-saver,
especially if your fax machine is constantly busy.
</P>
<P>
   The top-ranked fax software for some time has been WinFax from
Symantec, which sells for $90. It's easy to use and gives you all
kinds of options for cover pages. You can set it to automatically
answer the phone and receive incoming faxes.
</P>
<P>
   Virus Fighters
</P>
<P>
   What could be worse than your business grinding to a halt
because a virus has laid your computer low? While the chance of
contracting a virus is slim, it never hurts to protect yourself
with a program that can detect all the latest computer bugs and
electronically squash them. Either Norton Anti-Virus or McAfee
VirusScan will do the job. Both of these $45 programs can be set to
scan your system for viruses each time you turn on your computer.
</P>
<P>
   Creating a Web Site
</P>
<P>
   More and more small businesses are climbing onto the Internet,
which is becoming a great way to reach potential customers. To
market your business on the Internet, you'll have to create a Web
site. You can have this done professionally, but you can also
create one yourself using the latest Web-authoring tools. Three
easy-to-learn and use programs are Microsoft FrontPage 98
($139.95), Adobe PageMill ($99) and Claris Home Page ($99.95).
</P>
<P>
   Shareware
</P>
<P>
   In addition to software available in retail stores, consider
downloading some first-rate shareware programs to round out your
arsenal. WinZip, from Nico Mak Computing, makes it a snap to
compress and decompress files. Compressed files take up less
storage space, and take less time to send as e-mail attachments.
</P>
<P>
   A must-have for anyone who deals with graphics is Paint Shop Pro
from Jasc Software. At $99, it is not the cheapest piece of
shareware, but it is one of the best. You can convert graphics from
one format to another, resize them and adjust their color.
</P>
<P>
   Both programs are available for downloading through
www.hotfiles.com or www.shareware.com.

How 3 Retailers Fared on the Web 
By Carol Emert c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  It seemed like a bad
omen for small businesses when Saks Fifth Avenue gave up on
electronic commerce earlier this year. After all, if a
sophisticated retailer like Saks couldn't make money on the Web,
how could more modest merchants?
<TEXT>
<P>
   Billy Blue, a San Francisco men's clothier, provides a more
optimistic model for cyber retailers: While its total online sales
have been relatively small, the site has sold more upscale apparel
in the past two months than Saks did in its 18 months on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saks will come back when they realize they made a mistake,''
says Billy Bragman, owner of Billy Blue.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Blue is just one of 700,000 small businesses with some
type of Web presence and one of 70,000 with secure ordering
capability, according to International Data Corp. Thousands more
small companies, defined as those with fewer than 100 employees,
are signing on each month.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows how many of these sites are profitable. As with
large retailers, it is possible for a small business to sink
hundreds or thousands of dollars into a Web site and see little or
no return. For many of the early entrants, profits aren't even
expected until significantly more consumers are spending
considerably more money on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   The three Bay Area merchants profiled below have each
established a presence on the Web with some degree of success.
</P>
<P>
   _Billy Blue (www.billyblue.com) has sold $7,000 worth of Web
merchandise in the last two months, including four horsehide coats
for $695 each and numerous packages of underwear. (By contrast,
Saks sold less than $3,000 of merchandise in a year and a half.)
</P>
<P>
   Billyblue.com has attracted a surprising amount of global
business, including an order for a coat from Belarus (part of the
former Soviet Union) and one for 20 pairs of boxers from Panama.
Bragman made the mistake of promising the Belarus customer free air
shipping before finding out the cost: $190.
</P>
<P>
   But it's all part of the learning process, and that will give
Billyblue.com an edge over Web latecomers, Bragman hopes.
``Ultimately there's so much earning potential that even if I lose
a couple of grand now (on mistakes), it's worth it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Billyblue.com, which offers 120 items, has gone through three
redesigns since a simple home page launch in 1995 on the Virtual
Village``shopping mall,'' a Web site that hosts a lot of retail
sites. Bragman estimates costs of the most recent redo, in March,
at $5,000, which includes graphic design, a $1,200 digital camera
and various service fees. The two earlier, simpler versions cost a
total of $1,200.
</P>
<P>
   Bragman expects Web volume eventually to top sales at his Geary
Street boutique, which he opened in 1986. But the biggest bonanza
to date came from attracting Netscape founder Marc Andreesen, who
became Billy Blue's best customer after first checking out the
online store.
</P>
<P>
   The site, which is updated with new products each month, is also
an effective advertisement for some existing Billy Blue customers,
who visit Billyblue.com occasionally and come into the store when
they see something they want.
</P>
<P>
   Bragman hopes to place ads for the site on Silicon Valley
corporate intranets, although so far he hasn't found anyone willing
to sell him space.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first mistake you can make as a retailer is not being on
the Web,'' Bragman said.
</P>
<P>
   _Frederick Douglass Designs (www.citycom.com/fddesigns/), an
African American greeting card company in Berkeley, has also found
an international clientele on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   The company, founded in 1983 by siblings Margot and Joseph
Dashiell, sells cards through a catalog and about 35 department and
specialty stores in the United States, including a headquarters
showroom on Folger Street.
</P>
<P>
   In a little more than a year on the Web, the company has
generated about $10,000 in online sales, including orders from
Brazil, the Netherlands and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the global orders come from U.S. military personnel
stationed overseas, but many others are from people of African
descent living in Europe and South America, said Margot Dashiell.
</P>
<P>
   Frederick Douglass Designs has hired part-time help to sift
through hundreds of e-mails received each week that include both
orders and requests for catalogs. By next month, the company hopes
to have secure transaction capability on the site, which should
streamline the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``The business we've done far outweighs the costs we've put into
it,'' said Dashiell. An added benefit are the thousands of new
names and addresses generated for the company's catalog mailing
list.
</P>
<P>
   The Dashiells started the site after being approached by
CityOnline, their Emeryville-based Internet service provider, to
work together on an online store. Although they had never even
surfed the Web before, ``We understood this was the kind of real
estate this was too good to pass up,'' said Dashiell.
</P>
<P>
   Startup costs totaled $800 and the company pays a $100 quarterly
service fee for the site.
</P>
<P>
   _Tara Thralls Designs (www.tiedyes.com) has tapped into the
massive Grateful Dead Web culture with its tie-dyed T-shirts,
spiral-rainbow mousepads and other hippie paraphernalia.
</P>
<P>
   The site has helped even out the seasonal ebb and flow of the
Point Reyes Station-based business, a small cabin on Highway 1 that
relies heavily on summer and weekend beach traffic.
</P>
<P>
   During the winter, Web sales can account for 20 percent of the
company's total revenues, said Tara Thralls, who owns the business
and runs it with her two daughters, Star and Patty.
</P>
<P>
   Tiedyes.com has also allowed Thralls to mine the wallets of
Deadheads as far away as Egypt, Australia, Malaysia and Finland.
Since launching the site in 1995, her single largest sale has been
a $5,000 order from a Japanese hippie.
</P>
<P>
   Thralls, who designed and maintains the vividly colored site
herself, has spent about $500 on software and photos, plus an $80
start-up fee and $30 monthly fees to her Internet service provider.
</P>
<P>
   ``The site has paid for itself 10 times over,'' Thralls said.
Sales have slowly picked up since Thralls redesigned the site a
year and a half ago, turning it from a simple home page with two
photos into an extensive site with dozens of pages and hundreds of
links to related sites.
</P>
<P>
   Thralls credits much of Tiedyes.com's success to its
self-explanatory domain name, which makes it easy for Web surfers
to find. ``Tiedye.com'' and ``Tiedyed.com'' were already taken when
she applied for a name three years ago. ``When I saw `Tiedyes.com'
was free, I got chills,'' she said. ``I knew how big the Internet
would be.''
</P>
<P>
   Thralls relies on Web search engines and word of mouth to
generate traffic to the site. She has registered Tiedyes.com, as
well as common misspellings of the word ``tie dye,'' with major
search engines. She said she plans to register other search words
such as ``hippie'' and ``counterculture.''
</P>
<P>
   When she can afford it, Thralls said, she would like to add the
capacity to handle secure credit card orders and run banner ads on
other sites.

How Firms Can Keep Pace With Technology 
By Tom Abate 
c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  When I ran a typesetting business
in the 1980s, one of my worries was figuring out what technology to
buy to keep pace with the changes in the industry.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The best advice I ever got on that score literally walked in my
front door one day, when a trio of local inventors showed me an
interface that plugged a PC into our typesetting machine.
</P>
<P>
   For a trivial cost, their invention more than doubled the amount
of text our machines could pump out.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to that little gadget, our mom-and-pop shop was able to
compete with big type shops nationwide for book and newsletter
contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Because most firms can't count on having dream technologies walk
up and grab their lapels, I'd like to suggest some strategies for
small businesses to figure out how to make their operations more
tech-savvy.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Stay Accessible: &LR;  Technology and computers are not synonymous.
Many small firms _ especially one-person or home-based businesses _
can get their best payback by investing in phones.
</P>
<P>
   When customers call, they want you now. Answering services,
pagers and cell phones are just the start. Maybe you need a service
that forwards calls from your ``headquarters'' to a cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   The faster you can handle queries, the happier your customers
will be. And that has to be the first order of business.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; FREE expert advice: &LR;  If you can't afford to hire a
management-consulting firm, you can still get free advice from
business school students who one day will become high-priced
consultants.
</P>
<P>
   Every fall and spring, the University of California at
Berkeley's Haas School of Business sends graduate students out to
help businesses with every problem imaginable. Program director
Stephanie Tibbetts said these grad student interns can help small
firms modernize or revamp the way they do business.
</P>
<P>
   For details, see her Web site: http:/
/haas.berkeley.edu/lester/bsg.html.
</P>
<P>
   California State University at Hayward and San Francisco State
University both offer similar programs. At CSU Hayward, contact Ron
Feldman through e-mail at BIZAMERICAaol.com.
</P>
<P>
   Rich McCline does the matchmaking at S.F. State. He's reachable
by phone at (415) 338-7886 or e-mail at rmcclinesfsu.edu.
</P>
<P>
   In the cheap-but-not-quite-free category is the Corporation for
Manufacturing Excellence in Fremont. It can help you completely
overhaul your widget-making operations. Call AnnMarie Winslow at
(510) 249-1480 for information.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Your tax dollars at work &LR; : The Small Business Administration
funds six Small Business Development Centers around the Bay Area.

<P>
   Elza Minor runs the Sunnyvale office at (408) 736-0680). ``We
have consultants who can help with every sort of problem,'' he
said. ``And you can't beat the price _ it's free.''
</P>

 &HT;    New Catholic Church committee offers swifter responses to priest
misconduct
 &HT;    By Dan Moffett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Alarmed by epidemic increases in reports
of sexual misconduct by priests, the Catholic Church four years ago
moved to deal with the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Which, for the first time, was an acknowledgment that there
really was one.
</P>
<P>
   The 300-member Council of Catholic Bishops created the Ad Hoc
Communicate on Sexual Abuse, a committee chaired by Bishop John
Kinney of Bismarck, N.D. Its mission was to restore faith in the
priesthood.
</P>
<P>
   The swift removal of Bishop J. Keith Symons from the Diocese of
Palm Beach, Fla., was example of the church's new philosophy on
handling molester clergymen: Within five weeks of first disclosure
of offenses, he resigned and was replaced and sent to Suitland,
Md., for treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Vatican, one of the oldest bureaucracies running, acted
quickly on the case, sending a replacement bishop to be available
for the public contrition.
</P>
<P>
   Monsignor Francis Maniscalco, director of communications for the
Bishops Conference in Washington, D.C., said the handling of the
Symons case is a reflection of a new approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was locally determined and locally done,'' Maniscalco
said, ``but the experience of the last five or six years and the
work of the Ad Hoc committee has helped crystalize action in these
cases.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Symons' high profile underscored the need for a quick
response.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think generally speaking, when the church now sees there are
issues to be dealt with, they are done so with immediacy,''
Maniscalco said.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say the church's reaction is still too slow,
particularly in reaching out to help the victim. They also charge
that spiriting priests away to treatment centers is a technique to
keep them out of the reach of legal action.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should have stepped in a lot sooner in the Symons case,''
said Barbara Blaine, president of SNAP (Survivors Network of Those
Abused by Priests), a Chicago-based support group for victims.
``They should have acted five weeks ago when the first abuse came
out. I put a challenge to the church: Do something for the
victims.''
</P>
<P>
   SNAP has about 4,000 members. Between 150 and 200 priests have
been removed by the church for molestation of children, according
to SNAP and other victims' groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that Symons says the molestation happened 40 years
ago really reflects the problem,'' Blaine said. ``How has he been a
priest for all that time? He is a man that does not belong in the
ministry. No risk to even one child is acceptable. They should put
him in a monastery but never let him work around people again.
There are no cures for this.''

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   &HT;    Gateway to offer browser choice
 &HT;    By Jerry Mahoney
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ In a move seen as loosening Microsoft Corp.'s
grip on the major computer makers, Gateway Inc. said recently that
it will include competing Internet browsers on desktop computers
with Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   PCs shipped to consumers in June will include Netscape Navigator
in addition to Microsoft's Internet Explorer 4.0, Gateway chief
executive Ted Waitt told reporters in New York.
</P>
<P>
   That will make it far more convenient to choose Netscape
Communications Corp.'s browser over Microsoft Corp.'s version than
is currently available among any of the major PC makers.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as we know, we are the only PC maker that has made it
as easy as possible'' to choose the browser, Waitt said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have worked with Microsoft and they have allowed us to do
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Gateway and Microsoft officials said they reached their
agreement recently but declined to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's bundling its Internet browser with its Windows
operating system is a major point of the recent antitrust lawsuits
filed against Microsoft last week by the U.S. Department of Justice
and 20 states.
</P>
<P>
   They charge that Microsoft uses its monopoly of the operating
system to steer computer users to its browser at the expense of
Netscape's browser.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft says the browser is integral to the operating system
and that blocking such steps will slow innovation on the computer
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Gateway will sell Windows 98 computers for June shipment that
enable users to click on its Internet service icon and immediately
be sent to another screen, designed by Gateway, that gives them a
choice of Internet access and browser.
</P>
<P>
   Users must choose Gateway's Internet access service to use
Netscape's browser.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, people who clicked on the Microsoft Internet access
icon were sent to Microsoft's own online service. Those who
preferred Netscape had to load it separately themselves or have
Gateway do it. Microsoft would not say whether the negotiations
with Gateway were spurred by the antitrust suits.
</P>
<P>
   Gateway officials recently said the company wanted more
flexibility on the browser issue in a deposition taken as part of
the Justice Department's case against Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   The comments by Gateway executive Rick Brownrigg were included
in the Justice Department's motion that sought a preliminary
injunction preventing release of Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   With 1997 revenues of $6.3 billion, Gateway is the
second-biggest direct seller of computers behind Dell Computer
Corp., whose revenues were $12.7 billion in the latest fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Dell said the company has no plans to change its
browser offering.
</P>
<P>
   Because Internet Explorer is bundled in the Windows operating
system, it is the default browser for the vast majority of
computers shipped by Dell. Dell's policy has been to add Netscape's
browser only for customers who request it.
</P>
<P>
   The cost is $66 extra for the software and $15 to load it during
the assembly process, said Dell spokesman T.R. Reid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Customers typically do not specify the type of browser they
want,'' Reid said.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq Computer Corp.'s computers feature Internet Explorer
exclusively unless a customer or reseller requests otherwise.
Presario models sold by Radio Shack have both browsers loaded at
the factory.

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A on the news
 &HT;    By Colin Bessonette
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail
him at q&AMP;a(at)ajc.com
</P>
<P>
   Q: I see that the decade-long renovation of Egypt's Sphinx has
just been completed. That reminds me of something I've heard over
the years, that the Italians used the Sphinx for artillery target
practice when they occupied Egypt. Is that so?
</P>
<P>
   A: Don't blame the Italians. In fact, the idea that it was used
by anyone for target practice probably is off base. Although locals
who guide tourists around the site for tips often tell them that
Napoleon's men used the Sphinx for target practice, it seems
unlikely. Napoleon's party was the first from the modern West to
catalog and praise the Egyptian antiquities, so the idea that they
then would harm something so significant is remote.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the ailments of the Sphinx appear to have stemmed from
the very rock it is made of: soft, relatively porous limestone,
hardly fit to stand eons of wind, sand, heat, water, pollution and
time.The Napoleon legend makes sense only because it's a good story
in the spirit of anti-colonialism. Absent logic and proof, however,
it's not believable.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When were the first TV commercials aired, and what were the
companies?
</P>
<P>
   A: The year was 1945. The first advertisers included Lever
Bros., Bulova Watch, Botany Worsted Mills, Pan American World
Airways, Firestone Tire &AMP; Rubber, RCA Victor, Gillette Safety
Razor, Esso gasolines, U.S. Rubber, and R.H. Macy &AMP; Co. The ads
were aired in New York on WCBW, WNBC and WABD.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Assuming an all-out nuclear attack with all available nuclear
weapons, what impact would a nuclear war between India and Pakistan
have on the Earth's environment?
</P>
<P>
   A: The effects of what would be the world's first nuclear
exchange are difficult to predict because so many variables remain
unclear. Neither country has said how many weapons it has or
intends to stockpile, or been open about the destructive power
(``yield'') of its weapons. Paul Beaver, spokesman in London for
defense publisher Jane's Information Group, said Pakistan and India
each are believed to have 12 to 18 nuclear weapons packing yields
equivalent to about 20 kilotons of TNT. That's the size of the
atomic bomb that the United States dropped on Hiroshima, Japan, on
Aug. 6, 1945. The U.S. bomb dropped on Nagasaki three days later
was more powerful.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than assuming both countries would unleash all their
weapons, consider what would happen if each attacked the other's
capital with one bomb. Nuclear experts say most of the death and
destruction would be within a half-mile radius of ground zero. Much
of the fallout would push into the stratosphere if even one bomb
exploded in the air; more fallout obviously would occur if there
were more than one explosion. People for miles around would be
threatened with radiation sickness and death, and the fallout
likely would spread worldwide through the air and water. Prevailing
winds, rain and other factors would figure into where the fallout
would go.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, the full effects of the radiation from World War II
atomic bombs exploded over Japan, and from the 1986 Chernobyl
(Ukraine, then part of the Soviet Union) nuclear reactor disaster,
which would include birth defects, aren't fully understood. So the
environment isn't the only concern outside Pakistan and India.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the Military District of Washington? I heard it
referred to after the Memorial Day concert in Washington on PBS,
and then saw it mentioned again in a Q&AMP;A item about the Tomb of the
Unknowns.
</P>
<P>
   A: The full name is U.S. Army Military District of Washington.
In 1941, about five months after the start of World War II, the War
Department created MDW to plan for a ground defense of the nation's
capital. During the WW II era, MDW gradually was reorganized as a
service and support command, with responsibility for servicing the
newly built Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, MDW has gained, lost and regained various
installations and support responsibilities.Today it's an Army
command with a three-fold mission: to respond to crisis, disaster
or security requirements in the National Capital Region; to operate
Arlington National Cemetery and provide base operations for Army
and Defense Department organizations throughout the National
Capital Region; and to conduct official ceremonies, in Washington
and worldwide, on behalf of the nation's civilian and military
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   MDW is the home of the Army's official ceremonial unit, the 3rd
U.S. Infantry (The Old Guard); and the U.S. Army Band, ``Pershing's
Own,'' units that represent the Army and the nation thousands of
times each year.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's the difference between DUI and DWI? An article about
Wal-Mart heiress Alice Walton said she was convicted of DWI.
</P>
<P>
   A: Different states use different terms, but by either DUI
(driving under the influence) or DWI (driving while impaired or
driving while intoxicated), it's the same thing: driving drunk or
under the influence of drugs. Walton was found guilty Friday of
driving while intoxicated, refusing to take a blood-alcohol test at
the request of police, driving without a seat belt, and failing to
properly maintain control of her vehicle after a single-vehicle
accident in January near her Arkansas home. She will be sentenced
in July.

   UNDATED: DUI vs. DWI?

   Q: I remember reading some months ago that the Fuller Brush Co.,
of Fuller Brush Man fame, still exists. I had assumed that with
changing technology and lifestyles, it was long gone. Do you have
any information, and where can I order products?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Fuller Brush Co. is still a booming business. Although
distributors nationwide still may call on customers occasionally,
the legendary ``brush man'' calling door-to-door is little more
than a memory, said company spokesman Larry Gray. These days, many
customers choose to order products by mail or electronic order, or
by phone to a toll-free number, he said. The company manufactures
more than 2,000 items, such as household cleaning aids, polishes
and wax products, cotton and synthetic mops, floor brushs and
brooms, hair care aids, lotions and fragrances, even silk-screen
graphics, at its plant in Great Bend, Kan. Information:

<P>
   Q: Over the past few years, Dean Johnson, host of ``Hometime''
on public television, has had three women who have helped him
build, and all seemed to be his wives. What's the story on these
women? What is Johnson's background?
</P>
<P>
   A: Johnson is married, but not to any of the women _ there have
been four, not three _ with whom he has co-hosted ``Hometime.''
There's reason for your confusion, though. The program makes it
appear as though Johnson and his co-hosts are married ``so we can
introduce situations that might realistically occur with a
husband-wife team,'' as the program's publicity material states.
</P>
<P>
   Peggy Knapp, the first co-host, started in 1986, but left after
the first season. Since then, she been hosting ``Newton's Apple,''
a public TV children's program. JoAnne Liebeler, the second
co-host, stayed with ``Hometime'' for four seasons, after which she
moved to the West Coast to pursue other acting opportunities.
Susanne Egli, who joined the show for one season, has since been
acting in regional theater and appearing in commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Current co-host Robin Hartl joined ``Hometime'' in July 1992.
She received a real estate license and spent two years selling real
estate in Eau Claire, Wis., before moving to Minneapolis, where she
worked in the commercial insurance business for eight years while
renovating homes in her off-time.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was an accountant, sales representative and residential
contractor before launching ``Hometime'' in 1984. He and his real
wife, Kathi, have two children.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How can someone from Jamaica participate in the National
Spelling Bee? Isn't it restricted to students of the United States
and its territories?
</P>
<P>
   A: The competition, sponsored by Scripps Howard Newspapers, has
only these restrictions: contestants must speak English and be
younger than 16, and cannot have passed beyond the eighth grade at
the time of their school finals. All have qualified by competing in
previous spelling bees sponsored by their local newspapers. The 249
contestants this year represented 49 states (no Vermont entry),
several U.S. territories, Mexico, the Bahamas and Jamaica.
</P>
<P>
   This year's winner was Jody-Anne Maxwell, 12, a seventh-grader
at Ardenne High School in Kingston, Jamaica. The only previous
winner from beyond the mainland United States was Hugh Tosteson of
Puerto Rico, who won in 1975. In light of Jody-Anne's victory and
the foreign participants this year, Scripps Howard officials said
they would consider renaming the 71-year-old contest, substituting
the world international for national.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I saw a newspaper photo showing a U.S. Army infantry veteran
wearing a Combat Infantryman Badge. The caption said he was a
veteran of Desert Storm. I thought the badge was given only to
those who had been in combat for at least three months, or had been
awarded a Purple Heart. Can you clarify?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Combat Infantry Badge is awarded to infantrymen who have
been under enemy fire in a combat zone, with no minimum time limit
specified, according to the Dictionary of the Modern U.S. Military.
The only restriction stated is that generals and
support/administrative personnel usually are ineligible to receive
it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I know a lot of people who use the product Ripped Fuel to
boost energy. I heard something on the news about a danger
associated with it, but I didn't get the details. Do you have any
information?
</P>
<P>
   A: You probably heard about concerns expressed by the Food and
Drug Administration relating to scores of herbal products and
supplements. Government and other experts have warned that a number
of such products can be risky. They have said that the pills,
tonics and teas are sold with little information for consumers to
judge whether they actually work or might have potential side
effects. The culprit named in Ripped Fuel is ephedra, also called
ma huang, epitonin and sida cordifolia. It contains stimulants
known chemically as ephedrine. Several months ago, the FDA reported
having 900 reports of side effects, including heart palpitations
and psychosis, heart attacks and strokes. Several states have
banned ephedrine-containing supplements. Federal limitations are
pending.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I saw that Tony Bennett sang ``Ave Maria'' at Frank Sinatra's
funeral. Knowing that Sinatra was an admirer of President John F.
Kennedy, I wonder if Sinatra sang ``Ave Maria'' at Kennedy's
funeral? If not, who did?
</P>
<P>
   A: It was Luigi Vena who sang Gounod's ``Ave Maria'' at
Kennedy's funeral service Nov. 25, 1963, at Washington's St.
Matthew's Roman Catholic Cathedral. Jacqueline Kennedy had
specifically requested him to do so. Vena had sung the same music
when she and Kennedy married at Newport, R.I., on Sept. 12, 1953.
Another vital participant at both ceremonies was Cardinal Richard
Cushing of Boston. He officiated at the wedding and sang the
requiem mass at the funeral.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Have the Atlanta Braves ever had a black announcer?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. Billy Sample, an outfielder for the Braves in 1986,
announced for the team for two years, 1988 and 1989, said Braves
publicist Glen Serra. Over the years after that, Sample held jobs
announcing for ESPN, the California Angels and the New York
Yankees. No longer in the broadcast booth, he now evaluates umpires
for the National League.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Some time ago, I heard about a doctor who grows Carolina Gold
rice, donating the crop to a church to sell. Can you tell me about
this venture, and where I might purchase some?
</P>
<P>
   A: You're referring to South Carolina ophthalmologist Richard R.
Schulze who, in an attempt to attract ducks, planted his first rice
seeds in 1979 on his 400-acre Turnbridge Plantation on the South
Carolina side of the Savannah River. Schulze and his wife switched
to Carolina Gold, the original variety grown in the state's Old
South heyday, after discovering a source for the seed in Texas.
Carolina Gold is the variety that European nobility prized for its
sweet, nutty taste and whiter-than-white color after it was washed.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Schulze family couldn't consume all the rice they
produced, they have, over the years, given generous amounts to
patients and friends. Even so, they still had a surplus, so Schulze
first donated it to the Savannah Association for the Blind to sell
as a fund-raiser. Now he donates it _ for the same fund-raising
purpose _ to the Episcopal Church of the Holy Trinity in Ridgeland,
S.C.
</P>
<P>
   The church still has a small supply of the Carolina Gold from
last December's harvest, a spokeswoman said Thursday. You can order
it by sending a check to Church of the Holy Trinity, Rt. 3, Box
260, Ridgeland, S.C. 29936. The cost is $10 for a 1 1/2-pound bag,
plus $1.50 for shipping. Once it is sold out, the next crop will be
available for shipping next December, the spokeswoman said.
Information: 803-726-3743.

   UNDATED: Carolina Gold rice . . .

<P>
   Q: Isn't there some law restricting the minutes of advertising a
network can show during TV programs? If not, there should be,
because advertisers are exceeding what we should have to endure.
</P>
<P>
   A: There's no law, but you're correct if you think you're
watching more commercials than ever. As reported previously, TV
Guide says a study by the American Association of Advertising
Agencies and the Association of National Advertisers found that the
amount of ads and network promos in prime time has increased 33
percent in the past nine years. The biggest culprit is ABC, which
has gone from 7 minutes and 22 seconds per hour to 9 minutes and 30
seconds per hour.
</P>
<P>
   Your options: when commercials interrupt your program, hit the
mute button on your remote, leave the room, or turn off the TV.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When I was growing up, I always heard the American soldiers'
final resting place and memorial at Arlington National Cemetery
referred to as the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. Now it seems to be
known as Tomb of the Unknowns. Why the change? When was the tomb
built?
</P>
<P>
   A: Originally, there was one unknown from one war. On March 4,
1921, Congress approved the burial of an unidentified American
soldier from World War I in the plaza of the new Memorial
Amphitheater. The tomb sarcophagus was placed above the grave of
the Unknown Soldier of World War I.

   The first Tomb of the Unknown Soldier was slightly smaller than
the present base. It was torn away when the present tomb was
started Aug. 27, 1931. The tomb was completed, and the area opened
to the public, April 9, 1932. West of the World War I Unknown are
the crypts of unknowns from World War II and Korea (whose
internments took place in 1958) and Vietnam (1984).
</P>
<P>
   The white marble sarcophagus has never been officially named,
according to the Military District of Washington, which oversees
Arlington. So it's referred to both ways: ``Unknowns'' and
``Unknown Soldier.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Since the Tomb of the Unknowns is so much in the news lately,
I'm curious: How many bodies, representing what wars, are entombed
there?
</P>
<P>
   A: One each from World War I, World War II, the Korean War and
the Vietnam War (the latter exhumed in May for an attempt at
identification).
</P>
<P>
   Q: A recent newspaper item listing U.S. deaths in major wars
omitted the Spanish-American War. This is the 100th anniversary,
and Teddy Roosevelt would be very put out. So what was the total
number of American dead in that war?
</P>
<P>
   A: The word ``major'' probably is the key here. The Defense
Department lists 385 battle deaths and 2,061 other fatalities in
that war, which took place from April to August 1898. Hopefully
none of the participants, including the Rough Riders under Lt. Col.
Theodore Roosevelt, would have felt insulted.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A recent Q&AMP;A item said the Vietnam War began in 1957. Didn't
it actually start in 1962?
</P>
<P>
   A: The item you saw was referring to American casualties in a
number of wars. U.S. civilian and military advisers began helping
the South Vietnamese in the '50s. The year 1957 was when Americans
first started taking casualties in a long, ongoing war in Vietnam,
picking up where the French left off in their war with the Viet
Minh (1946-54). In early 1965, the United States began sending
ground combat troops to Vietnam and began bombing North Vietnam.
Since the Vietnam War never officially was declared by the United
States, there's no one single starting date you can point to.

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A on the news
 &HT;    By Colin Bessonette
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: Start-date of the Vietnam war?
</P>
<P>
   Q: After reading about the Supreme Court's decision that Ellis
Island belongs to New Jersey and not New York, I looked at a map
and noticed that the Statue of Liberty appears to be at least a
half-mile inside New Jersey. Has New Jersey ever made a claim to
Miss Liberty also?
</P>
<P>
   A: No claim is necessary. There's no disputing that Liberty
Island and the Statue of Liberty are in New Jersey waters outside
New York harbor. But most people _ and guidebooks _ include them as
attractions of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What are the dates for next year's Chelsea Flower Show in
England? Where can I get information about tickets and travel
packages?
</P>
<P>
   A: Dates for 1999: May 25-28. The show is restricted to members
of the Royal Horticultural Society the first three days, and is
open to the public only on the last day, said Gillian Cooper of the
British Consulate. So she recommends joining the society for a
modest fee, which allows you to attend any of the days. For
information about joining, and a membership application, write:
Shows Department, Royal Horticultural Society, Vincent Square,
London SW1P 2PE, England. Information: 011-44-171-834-4333.
</P>
<P>
   The British Tourist Authority in New York says several tour
operators routinely offer travel packages that include tickets to
the show, if you don't want to join the horticultural society.
Information can be obtained from travel agents. For general tourism
information on Britain, including the Chelsea Flower Show, call
1-800-462-2748 or, on the Internet, check this address:
www//visitbritain.com
</P>
<P>
   Q: Other than the United Kingdom and Japan, in what countries do
people drive on the left side of the road?
</P>
<P>
   A: The American Automobile Association reports the following
worldwide: Antigua, Australia, Bahamas, Barbados, Bermuda, Bhutan,
Botswana, Brunei, Cayman Islands, Channel Islands, Cyprus,
Dominica, Fiji, Grenada, Guyana, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia,
Ireland, Jamaica, Kenya, Lesotho, Macao, Malawi, Malaysia, Malta,
Mauritius, Montserrat, Mozambique, Namibia, Nepal, New Zealand,
Pakistan, Papua-New Guinea, Peninsular Malaysia, Seychelles,
Singapore, South Africa, Sri Lanka, St. Christopher, Nevis &AMP;
Anguilla, St. Lucia, St. Vincent, Surinam, Swaziland, Tanzania,
Thailand, Trinidad &AMP; Tobago, Uganda, the Virgin Islands, Zambia and
Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is the new artificial sweetener sucralose available in
stores?
</P>
<P>
   A: You may have to wait awhile for the no-calorie sweetener,
which recently was approved by the Food and Drug Administration, to
become available. McNeil Specialty Products, a division of Johnson
&AMP; Johnson, which will market sucralose, says the product will be
rolled out over the next two years. It will be available as a table
sweetener, and will be added to processed foods. It has been
approved for use in beverages, dairy products, desserts, chewing
gum, puddings, jams and jellies, and sauces and syrups, among other
products. Information: 1-800-777-5363 or, on the Internet:
www.sucralose.com
</P>
<P>
   Q: NBC has canceled ``Union Square,'' but a recent article
listed it as the seventh-highest-rated program in the Nielsen
ratings for the season. Why was it canceled?
</P>
<P>
   A: The NBC sitcom ``Union Square'' played between ``Friends''
and ``Seinfeld,'' thus seeming to guarantee it a huge potential
audience. But it regularly lost a lot of ``Friends'' viewers, which
is a bad sign. Also, it generated no positive word of mouth and was
considered a creative disappointment by the network. So out it
went.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I once read about a particular type of berry British pilots
ate during World War II to improve their night vision during night
flying missions . Do you know anything about it?
</P>
<P>
   A: You're referring to bilberry (Vaccinium myrtiullus) which, on
the basis of folk beliefs, was consumed in the form of jam by Royal
Air Force pilots before flying off into the night. They had
discovered, as you say, that bilberry improved their night vision
by helping the eyes adjust from light to darkness. After the war,
scientists investigated the claim and confirmed that the berries
and bilberry extract contained compounds known as anthocyanosides
that help maintain visual sensitivity. Subsequent clinical trials
confirmed that bilberry extract improves night vision in air
traffic controllers, pilots and automobile drivers, and also
reduces eye strain and fatigue.
</P>
<P>
   Another antioxidant that has been demonstrated to improve
circulation to the eyes, with a possible benefit to eyesight, is
ginkgo biloba. Other herbs and nutrients that may help vision
include lycopene (in tomatoes), grape seed extract and vitamins C
and E.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I vaguely recall a kidnapping case involving Frank Sinatra.
Will you refresh my memory?
</P>
<P>
   A: On Dec. 8, 1963, Frank Sinatra Jr., 19, was abducted from
Harrah's Casino at Lake Tahoe, Calif. He was released unharmed Dec.
11 after the elder Sinatra paid $240,000 in ransom. The FBI
announced Dec. 14 that it had arrested three men _ one of them
being the accused mastermind, Barry Keenan, a stock market player
who had become addicted to drugs and alcohol _ and had recovered
most of the ransom money. The defense team later argued that Frank
Jr. dreamed up the kidnapping as a publicity stunt to jump-start
his career; it also was rumored that the Mafia was involved. On
March 7, 1964, a federal court convicted the three and sentenced
them all to prison.
</P>
<P>
   It was reported in January that Columbia Pictures had snagged
the rights to ``Snatching Sinatra,'' an article recounting the
episode, with plans to make a movie about it.

(Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  EPA'S PLAN TO POST CHEMICAL RISKS ON  INTERNET RAISES SECURITY
WORRIES &HT;     By JULIA MALONE    c.1998 Cox News Service   WASHINGTON _ The
<TEXT>
Environmental Protection Agency is setting off security alarms with
plans to post details about the nation's hazardous chemical sites
on the Internet.
<P>
   The EPA is preparing to collect and make public information
about the ``worst-case'' potential disasters for some 66,000 U.S.
facilities that store dangerous chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   The disclosures are required by Clean Air Act amendments passed
in 1990 to alert people to dangers in their neighborhoods, ranging
from small propane gas distributors and chlorine tanks used for
water treatment to major chemical manufacturing plants and oil
refineries.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists hope the glare of publicity will lead to
greater attention to safety.
</P>
<P>
   However, the CIA and FBI have quietly expressed concerns that
the EPA's plan to use the Internet to distribute the information
would make it too accessible to criminals and terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   The plan also seems to conflict with a new White House focus on
terrorism. In a speech this month to the graduating class at the
U.S. Naval Academy, President Clinton focused on the threat and
outlined new measures to protect domestic facilities.
</P>
<P>
   James Makris, the EPA official who is overseeing the chemical
information program, said Thursday his agency is negotiating with
the security agencies, but that plans are proceeding to post some
form of data on the Internet next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very awkward problem for us,'' he acknowledged.
``It's pretty hard for someone to be worrying about terrorism and
agree to put out information.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that the EPA is urging disclosure because the
probability of a chemical accident is much higher than of a
terrorism incident. There are about 500 accidental releases of at
least small amounts of toxic substances each week.
</P>
<P>
   Makris said that his agency is working on an electronic method
to limit access to the most sensitive data, although he said that
computer hackers can eventually overcome such obstacles.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists have said that they plan to post the
information on the Internet if the government makes it public in
more limited ways. They also argue that the security concerns are
overstated.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no credible history of terrorist threats'' involving
chemicals, said Fred Millar, an environmental consultant and former
official of Friends of the Earth, who helped write the disclosure
law.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's necessary to inform the public in order to get an
appropriate level of concern'' so that companies will ``reduce
their risks of accidents,'' Millar said.
</P>
<P>
   Security experts outside government raised questions about the
Internet posting, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's insane,'' said Damon Camp, associate professor of
criminal justice at Georgia State University. ``People who use the
Internet are anonymous. What would inhibit someone who is thinking
about dirty deeds?''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Baker, associate professor of international business law at
the University of Texas, agreed that a centralized source for
chemical storage information could encourage terrorists. ``Any
information that's more readily available will whet their
appetites,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Baker said that the government should proceed to post
the data, because otherwise ``we'd be living in fear'' of
terrorism.

<P>
   Make it safe
</P>
<P>
   Here are some general food safety rules to keep in mind anytime
you're heading outdoors for a picnic:
</P>
<P>
   _ Keep hot foods hot, above 140 degrees to prevent food-borne
illness. You can retain heat by wrapping warm foods in aluminum
foil, then a towel, and nesting it snugly in a basket. Some
containers have heat-reflective linings. A thermos is good for hot
or cold liquids.
</P>
<P>
   _ Keep cold foods cold. Use airtight containers and transport in
an insulated cooler with ice or ice packs.
</P>
<P>
   _ Put food out just before serving and store any leftovers
quickly. Foods should never be left out longer than two hours.
</P>
<P>
   _ Never partially precook chicken or burgers that you plan to
grill. If precooking is necessary, cook the food completely, chill
it and keep it cool until time to reheat on the grill.
</P>
<P>
   _ For maximum airflow, avoid overpacking coolers. Transport the
cooler in the back seat of the car instead of the trunk, where it
will warm up more quickly.
</P>
<P>
   _ Take garbage bags, paper towels and damp washcloths in
resealable plastic bags for cleanup.

 &HT;    Central Texans facing threat of 2nd drought in 3 years
 &HT;    By Pamela Coleman and Nichole Monroe
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ With no substantial rain since mid-March and a
rash of record-breaking heat, farmers and municipalities in Central
Texas are bracing for the possibility of a second drought in three
years.
</P>
<P>
   San Marcos city officials have imposed restrictions on water
use, and city leaders in Leander, Austin, Round Rock and elsewhere
in Texas are urging residents to voluntarily conserve water as the
area endured its third day of record high temperatures Monday, 6/1.
</P>
<P>
   Local farmers may be worst hit, however. Buoyed by high moisture
content in the soil early in the year, Williamson County growers
planted more corn and grain sorghum than ever, only to see hopes
for a record-setting crop wilt under the searing sun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who would have dreamed we would have gotten dry this soon?''
asked Williamson County Extension Agent Ronnie Leps. ``It looked
like we walked out of the rain forest into the Sierra Desert. ''
</P>
<P>
   After an unusually wet 1997, Williamson County growers hoped for
the best, planting 140,000 combined acres of corn and grain
sorghum. Then the rains stopped. Now it looks like many farmers
will lose most of their corn crop and much of their sorghum crop.
</P>
<P>
   And each day the heat continues, the outlook grows bleaker, said
William Albert, who raises corn and cattle and manages the Hutto
Grain Co-op.

   ``Any day with temperatures above 90, the corn is going to go
down,'' Albert said. ``We get yield damage every day.''
</P>
<P>
   If rain doesn't come soon, the face of agriculture in the county
will change drastically, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll see different people on tractors and land laying
idle,'' Albert said. ``Most will give up and quit. They'll try to
find another job in town.''
</P>
<P>
   Travis County growers are facing an equally dismal future, said
county Extension Agent Brad Pierce.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the corn is chest-high or below, and that's never a
good sign,'' Pierce said. ``Right now, it's looking like a
financial disaster for the agriculture producer.''
</P>
<P>
   Although it is too early to know how hard farmers will be hit
financially, Pierce said, the next 10 days will be the deciding
factor. The chances for improvement are faint, however. The Austin
area hasn't received any significant rainfall since March 16,
according to the National Weather Service.
</P>
<P>
   As the chance of rain becomes an increasingly dim possibility,
cities and water districts across the region have begun asking
residents to voluntarily conserve water.
</P>
<P>
   San Marcos City Manager Larry Gilley issued a stage one water
conservation order Sunday, prohibiting daytime sprinkler use and
limiting car washing to designated days.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have kept a close watch on aquifer levels for the past
month,'' Gilley said. ``Given this extended dry spell and the lack
of sufficient rain, it is time to strengthen our efforts to
conserve water.''
</P>
<P>
   Because San Marcos relies so heavily on water from the Edwards
Aquifer, the city traditionally has been among the first to declare
a drought warning when aquifer levels get low in the summer months.
</P>
<P>
   A stage one drought warning is declared in San Marcos if aquifer
levels fall below 660 feet above mean sea level. On Monday, the
level was at 649.2 feet, a drop of more than 16 feet since the
beginning of May, said Melissa Millecam, city spokeswoman. ``We're
having a real dry spring and terrible start to the summer in terms
of rainfall,'' Millecam said. ``We're trying to be proactive.
Historically, San Marcos has been a leader in whole issue of
protecting the aquifer and conserving the aquifer.''
</P>
<P>
   With a high of 98 degrees, Monday was the third consecutive day
Austin reached record-breaking temperatures. Elsewhere in the
state, decades-old high-temperature records fell in Del Rio, where
it reached 108 degrees; Lubbock, 105 degrees; Amarillo, 103
degrees; Midland, 106 degrees; and San Angelo, 105 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   The heat was being cited as a possible factor in the death of a
man found dead on a bicycle trail at Cedar Hill State Park south of
Dallas, Cedar Hill police said.
</P>
<P>
   While this week's forecast for Central Texas promises more of
the same, a weak cold front is expected on Saturday that could
bring temperatures into the low 90s and a slight chance of rain,
said Cliff Cole, meteorologist for the National Weather Service in
New Braunfels.
</P>
<P>
   Although Austin broke the record for water use Sunday, mandatory
water rationing is not imminent, said Dan Arguijo, spokesman for
the Austin Water and Wastewater Utility. However, Arguijo said
residents are asked to voluntarily conserve water to prevent
problems during the summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly want to bring about awareness that we are on this
long trip called summer,'' Arguijo said.
</P>
<P>
   Barton Springs/Edwards Aquifer Conservation District officials
said Monday that water levels in some areas of the Baton Springs
segment of the Edwards Aquifer have dropped close to drought
levels. They also are asking residents to conserve water.
</P>
<P>
   In Leander, city officials are asking residents to use
sprinklers on their yards on either odd or even days, depending on
their street addresses. If the drought continues, the city will ask
residents to water yards only once every five days, said City
Administrator Gary Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can keep the odd-even voluntary plan where it's working,
or stepping up to a five-day plan, then we might not have to go to
mandatory,'' Jackson said. ``That's what we're hoping.

 &HT;    Ohio community benefits from rehabilitation of homes
 &HT;    By Wendy Hundley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ In 1992, you could hardly give away one of the
dilapidated houses on Frank Street.
</P>
<P>
   Today, one home on the street recently sold for $85,000, and the
Dayton, Ohio neighborhood is on the rebound, thanks to
YouthBuilders Academy, a program that rebuilds lives by rebuilding
deteriorated properties.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gave me a goal,'' said Larry Smith, 22, who was on hand
Monday for the unveiling of four homes rehabilitated by the
YouthBuilders program.
</P>
<P>
   Six years ago, Smith was an uninspired high school student
scraping by on D's. Then he become involved in the program that
targets youths at risk for dropping out of school and gives them
hands-on training in the skills needed for jobs in the construction
trade.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, school had a purpose.
</P>
<P>
   ``It made it worth going to school,'' said Smith, who now earns
$16.10 an hour as an apprentice carpenter.
</P>
<P>
   YouthBuilders, originally known at the Builders Academy, is the
brainchild of Ann Higdon, the Dayton woman whose idea to replace
food stamps with a computer card is now a statewide initiative.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Higdon, with the backing of Citizen Federal Bank,
National City Bank and some some well-connected community leaders,
bought 12 condemned homes on Frank Street for $50,000 near the
Montgomery County Fairgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, more than 200 students, many of them involved in
drugs and the juvenile court, have spent time bringing those homes
back to life.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, they've found new direction for their own lives.
</P>
<P>
   Of those 200 students, 75 percent have finished high school, and
87 percent were employed, in the military or in college one year
after graduation.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we're doing it with hammers and nails,'' said Higdon,
founder of Improved Solutions for Urban Systems Inc., the initial
partner in the program that now includes Dayton Public Schools, the
Rotary Club of Dayton and four area construction trade
associations.
</P>
<P>
   Construction skills aren't the only lessons learned.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's taught me good work habits, like getting to work on time
and having all your tools with you,'' said Ebony Brown, a
17-year-old mother of two.
</P>
<P>
   She said she'll take those habits with her when she studies
cosmetology after she graduates next year from Greene JROTC
Academy, a Dayton school where students got involved in
YouthBuilders during their junior and senior years.
</P>
<P>
   The program also benefits prospective homebuyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not rich but I wanted to have a nice house,'' said
homeowner Lori Powers, who had shopped for homes in other areas but
discovered she could only afford a ``two-bedroom crackerbox that
needed repairs.''
</P>
<P>
   Then she found the renovated home on Frank Street. She bought it
for $64,900.
</P>
<P>
   Powers feels she got a lot for her money: a three-bedroom,
two-story home with a full basement where she and her husband Jeff
plan to add another bedroom and a family room.
</P>
<P>
   Helping at-risk youth and helping low-to-moderate income
families was the dual purpose for the program that now has a
waiting list of 200 students.
</P>
<P>
   Now Higdon _ who has a knack for turning her dreams into
realities _ has set her sights on other challenges for the
YouthBuilders team.
</P>
<P>
   With the money raised from selling the Frank Street homes,
YouthBuilders Academy has contracts to buy two more sites: the
dilapidated Rubicon apartment building at Rubicon Drive and Frank
Street, and a downtown building at 224 N. St. Clair St.
</P>
<P>
   ``These will be apartments,'' Higdon said. ``Now the focus is on
downtown development.''

 &HT;    Student arrested near school with pellet rifle
 &HT;    By Lady Hereford
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. _ An 11-year-old student suspended last
week for disrupting his class was arrested recently when he was
caught near his school with a pellet rifle. He made no threats
against students or teachers.
</P>
<P>
   The school resource officer found the Florida sixth grader
around 8:45 a.m. in an abandoned pavilion near school grounds on
Monday, June 1. Startled, the boy pointed the loaded rifle at the
deputy before dropping it. No shots were fired.
</P>
<P>
   The boy was charged with two felonies, possession of a dangerous
weapon on school property and aggravated assault on a law
enforcement officer, and a misdemeanor, trespassing on school
grounds.
</P>
<P>
   He was booked at the county jail and taken to St. Lucie Regional
Juvenile Detention Center. He was to appear before a judge today.
The Palm Beach Post is withholding his name because of his age.
</P>
<P>
   School officials have also suspended the boy, and he will be
recommended for expulsion under the zero tolerance policy,
Superintendent Bill Vogel said.
</P>
<P>
   A motorist near the school saw the boy riding his bike with the
gun across his handlebars. The woman pulled into the school parking
lot and notified the physical education teacher.
</P>
<P>
   The sheriff's deputy assigned to the school found him 10 minutes
later in the abandoned structure with the rifle pointed away from
the campus. When Deputy Steve Zaring approached the boy, ``he
automatically just swung that way,'' pointing the gun at Zaring, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Zaring said he drew his weapon and shouted at the boy to put
down the rifle. The boy later said he had the gun for protection
because he ran away from home, Zaring said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the student was suspended for three days for
disrupting his class. As students signed a get-well banner for an
ill classmate, the boy shouted, ``Die soon with a heart attack,''
principal John Townsend said.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks earlier, he was suspended for bringing a small
amount of alcohol to school.

GATES' MEETING FOCUSES ON MEETING CUSTOMER NEEDS, NOT LEGAL WOES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WARREN WILSON   c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer   SEATTLE _
Microsoft chairman Bill Gates spent much of Thursday meeting with
the CEOs of more than 120 Fortune 500 companies and said at midday
that he hadn't received a single question about the company's
antitrust woes.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Guests at Microsoft's second ``CEO Summit'' focused solely on
the meeting's core topic, Gates said: how information technology
can make their businesses more efficient and more attuned to
customers' needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The antitrust lawsuit has not come up,'' he said in a strained
question-and-answer session with reporters, who were excluded from
the CEO meetings so that the participants could speak more frankly.
</P>
<P>
   Gates was joined in the Q&AMP;A session by Jeff Raikes, Microsoft's
group vice president for sales and marketing, and CEOs Eckhard
Pfeiffer of Compaq Computer Corp. and Marilyn Carlson Nelson of
Carlson Companies, a $20 billion hotel and travel services company.
</P>
<P>
   Raikes set the terms of discussion in his opening comments,
saying, ``This summit has absolutely nothing to do with the
Department of Justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're really talking about is where technology is
going,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gates said he had talked with the CEOs about the ``digital
nervous system,'' his term for a technology infrastructure
companies can use to reduce costs, improve communications and
respond to competition and globalization.
</P>
<P>
   He introduced the concept at last year's CEO Summit and said
Thursday that it hasn't really changed since then.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Raikes' ground rules, most of the questions reporters
asked centered on the antitrust lawsuits filed last week and their
implications for Microsoft and its customers.
</P>
<P>
   In the lawsuits, since consolidated in one action, antitrust
regulators accuse Microsoft of exploiting its dominance in desktop
operating systems to gain unfair advantage in the market for
Internet browser software.
</P>
<P>
   But those questions went unanswered.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if it wouldn't make sense to discuss that topic with the
CEOs, Gates said simply, ``No,'' and moved on to the next question.
</P>
<P>
   Pfeiffer, asked if he had heard any discussion of that topic,
said, ``To tell you the truth, I have not.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson, asked if the antitrust issue concerned her, said, ``I
haven't spent much time even thinking about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Pfeiffer then was asked about a specific issue in the lawsuits,
the amount of flexibility Microsoft grants to computer makers to
customize the first screen or ``desktop'' that customers see when
they turn on a new computer equipped with its Windows operating
system.
</P>
<P>
   The question was prompted by Wednesday's announcement by direct
seller Gateway 2000 that it had negotiated new terms with Microsoft
and will soon offer computers that include a customized desktop and
Netscape's Navigator browser, the target of Microsoft's allegedly
unfair tactics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not have any disagreements'' with Microsoft, Pfeiffer
said. ``If we wanted to do something different (with the desktop),
we would.''

   Here's the dope: In some forms, the hemp plant ain't so bad for
the body.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it's jampacked with essential fatty acids and amino
acids, making it an ideal ingredient for beauty fare ranging from
soaps to face creams, shampoo, healing salves and even lip balm.

   Using cannabis-based cosmetics may bring to mind substance
abuse, but in fact the plant used to make beauty products _
industrial hemp _ is altogether different from the smokable kind.
It's virtually drug-free.

INTEL AND MICROSOFT FACE DIFFERING ANTITRUST PATHS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   (ja) 
 By JOEL BRINKLEY   c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Lawyers for Intel Corp. should be well acquainted
with antitrust inquiries by the Federal Trade Commission _ a
process different from the one followed in Justice Department
antitrust cases _ because the commission has been investigating the
microprocessor giant off and on throughout this decade.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, the agency began an antitrust investigation of Intel
based on complaints that the company was illegally trying to
squeeze smaller chip makers out of business.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, on July 14, 1993, the agency wrote to Andrew
Grove, Intel's chairman, saying that the trade commission was
dropping its long investigation of supposed ``unlawful tying or
exclusive dealing practices or other unfair methods of
competition.'' But the letter added: ``This action is not to be
construed as a determination that a violation may not have
occurred,'' and ``the Commission reserves the right to take such
further action as the public interest may require.''
</P>
<P>
   The agency opened a new Intel investigation last year, and now
that an antitrust suit against Intel seems imminent, the agency and
the company are about to enter an administrative and legal process
far different from the Justice Department's case against Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC and the Justice Department have equal jurisdiction to
enforce antitrust laws, and the two agencies decide between
themselves which will handle each new case.
</P>
<P>
   Though both cases could take months to conclude, a suit against
Intel will never reach a federal district court. The initial
judicial proceedings will take place at an administrative level.
</P>
<P>
   First, the trade commission's staff members who have been
investigating Intel will forward their recommendation to the
five-member FTC. Their complaint will most likely accuse Intel of
withholding key technical information about the company's chips
from computer makers with which Intel is involved in disputes.
Without those data, manufacturers are unable to design products.
</P>
<P>
   The staff report should hardly come as a surprise to the
commissioners. Generally, senior agency officials brief the
commissioners regularly on investigations.
</P>
<P>
   Once the recommendation is in the commission's hands, Intel's
lawyers and executives will be free to meet the commissioners and
offer their version of events. Finally, the commissioners will take
a vote that is roughly equivalent to a civil indictment. A vote in
favor of moving forward means the panel thinks enough evidence
exists for a trial.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, the case is forwarded to an FTC administrative
law judge who presides over a full trial in a courtroom within the
agency's Washington office building.
</P>
<P>
   After hearing evidence, the judge can dismiss the case or uphold
the charges and issue orders of compliance against the defendant.
Any initial appeal has to be made to the full commission, which
then asks for briefs and oral arguments from both sides and rules
on the appeal.
</P>
<P>
   If the company wants to appeal further, it takes its case
directly to the U.S. court of appeals, which reviews decisions by
administrative agencies like the FTC.
</P>
<P>
   After the FTC's first investigation of Intel was dropped, Intel
said it had put its employees through extensive antitrust training.
</P>
<P>
   ``Around 1987, we recognized that we might have a successful
product on our hands, and we increased our antitrust compliance
program and training to our salespeople,'' Thomas Dunlap, Intel's
vice president and general counsel, said in 1993. ``That training
program has been successful.''
</P>
<P>
   The FTC, it would seem, does not agree.

<P>
   Here's the dope: The hemp plant, also known as cannabis sativa
or marijuana, is one of the best moisturizers around.
</P>
<P>
   The evil weed is, in fact, jam-packed with essential fatty acids
and amino acids, making it an ideal ingredient for beauty fare
ranging from soaps to face creams, shampoo, healing salves and even
lip balm.
</P>
<P>
   Hemp seeds can be pressed to produce a protein-rich oil that is
particularly well suited to dry skin.
</P>
<P>
   Using cannabis-based cosmetics may bring to mind substance
abuse, but in fact the plant used to make beauty products _
industrial hemp _ is altogether different from the smokable kind.
It's virtually drug-free.
</P>
<P>
   While it's true that the two plants are different varieties of
the same species, industrial hemp is cultivated for its seeds and
stalks, which are used to make everything from textiles and paint
to margarine and paper products.
</P>
<P>
   That's why, in addition to being incredibly versatile, hemp
saves trees, prompting such eco-correct celebrities as Peter Fonda
and Woody Harrelson to sing the herb's praises.
</P>
<P>
   Harrelson is regularly spotted wearing hemp outfits. Last year
he even commissioned Giorgio Armani to design a deluxe hemp tux for
the Golden Globes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can make anything out of this stuff,'' raved the actor.
``And it's non-psychoactive.''
</P>
<P>
   The only hitch is that the Controlled Substances Act, passed in
1970, made it illegal to grow marijuana in the United States, and
hemp companies are forced to source the fiber overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, in recent years, a bumper crop of hemp beauty
brands has sprouted around the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The earth-friendly products are sold in alternative fashion
boutiques, environmental stores and hemp shops, such as Planet Hemp
in New York's SoHo district, Frankel Bros. Hemp Outfitters in San
Francisco and Hemp in the Hollow in Laguna Beach.
</P>
<P>
   For those who want to make a meal of it, The Galaxy Global
Eatery in New York stocks a cabinet of hemp cosmetics and a full
menu of hemp delicacies (including hemp burgers, which actually
taste better than they sound).
</P>
<P>
   Most hemp beauty lines have heady, aromatic fragrances _ not
recommended for those who dislike perfume. The packaging often has
a homemade feel, with boxes made of hemp or bamboo paper.
</P>
<P>
   Body Dope, a provocatively named line of shampoos, conditioners,
soaps, massage oils and lip balms from the Berkeley-based Two Star
Dog, is one of the best sellers at Planet Hemp, according to John
Powell, the store's managing director.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people are worried about the name,'' he says, ``their
resistance is overcome when they try the products.''
</P>
<P>
   There are many excellent handmade hemp soaps, such as Hempola's
hand-cut bars and All Around The World's cleansing soaps, which
contain high levels of essential oils.
</P>
<P>
   There's also a strange dark brown soap from Virgin Body Care
called Dirty Dan's that gently exfoliates skin with a blend of corn
meal, pumice and crushed hemp seed.
</P>
<P>
   Parched hands will benefit from an application of Sun Dog's hand
cake, a superstrength emollient packaged in a metal tin.
</P>
<P>
   In the realm of hair care, Alterna has a new line called Enzyme
therapy that is sold only in salons. The products are formulated
with hemp seed oil and each is packaged with a tiny packet of seeds
roped to its neck. Sterilized hemp seeds, that is.
</P>
<P>
   Not one to miss out on a natural-ingredient trend, Body Shop is
introducing a line of hemp products this summer. The company
intends to make the most of the herb's rich and varied history.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first draft of the Declaration of Independence was written
on hemp paper,'' a spokeswoman says. ``We intend to recycle that
wisdom.''
</P>
<P>
   Put that in your pipe and smoke it. &QL;

<P>
   Here's the dope: The hemp plant, also known as cannabis sativa
or marijuana, is one of the best moisturizers around.
</P>
<P>
   The evil weed is, in fact, jam-packed with essential fatty acids
and amino acids, making it an ideal ingredient for beauty fare
ranging from soaps to face creams, shampoo, healing salves and even
lip balm.
</P>
<P>
   Hemp seeds can be pressed to produce a protein-rich oil that is
particularly well suited to dry skin.
</P>
<P>
   Using cannabis-based cosmetics may bring to mind substance
abuse, but in fact the plant used to make beauty products _
industrial hemp _ is altogether different from the smokable kind.
It's virtually drug-free.
</P>
<P>
   While it's true that the two plants are different varieties of
the same species, industrial hemp is cultivated for its seeds and
stalks, which are used to make everything from textiles and paint
to margarine and paper products.
</P>
<P>
   That's why, in addition to being incredibly versatile, hemp
saves trees, prompting such eco-correct celebrities as Peter Fonda
and Woody Harrelson to sing the herb's praises.
</P>
<P>
   Harrelson is regularly spotted wearing hemp outfits. Last year
he even commissioned Giorgio Armani to design a deluxe hemp tux for
the Golden Globes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can make anything out of this stuff,'' raved the actor.
``And it's non-psychoactive.''
</P>
<P>
   The only hitch is that the Controlled Substances Act, passed in
1970, made it illegal to grow marijuana in the United States, and
hemp companies are forced to source the fiber overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, in recent years, a bumper crop of hemp beauty
brands has sprouted around the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The earth-friendly products are sold in alternative fashion
boutiques, environmental stores and hemp shops, such as Planet Hemp
in New York's SoHo district, Frankel Bros. Hemp Outfitters in San
Francisco and Hemp in the Hollow in Laguna Beach.
</P>
<P>
   For those who want to make a meal of it, The Galaxy Global
Eatery in New York stocks a cabinet of hemp cosmetics and a full
menu of hemp delicacies (including hemp burgers, which actually
taste better than they sound).
</P>
<P>
   Most hemp beauty lines have heady, aromatic fragrances _ not
recommended for those who dislike perfume. The packaging often has
a homemade feel, with boxes made of hemp or bamboo paper.
</P>
<P>
   Body Dope, a provocatively named line of shampoos, conditioners,
soaps, massage oils and lip balms from the Berkeley-based Two Star
Dog, is one of the best sellers at Planet Hemp, according to John
Powell, the store's managing director.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people are worried about the name,'' he says, ``their
resistance is overcome when they try the products.''
</P>
<P>
   There are many excellent handmade hemp soaps, such as Hempola's
hand-cut bars and All Around The World's cleansing soaps, which
contain high levels of essential oils.
</P>
<P>
   There's also a strange dark brown soap from Virgin Body Care
called Dirty Dan's that gently exfoliates skin with a blend of corn
meal, pumice and crushed hemp seed.
</P>
<P>
   Parched hands will benefit from an application of Sun Dog's hand
cake, a superstrength emollient packaged in a metal tin.
</P>
<P>
   In the realm of hair care, Alterna has a new line called Enzyme
therapy that is sold only in salons. The products are formulated
with hemp seed oil and each is packaged with a tiny packet of seeds
roped to its neck. Sterilized hemp seeds, that is.
</P>
<P>
   Not one to miss out on a natural-ingredient trend, Body Shop is
introducing a line of hemp products this summer. The company
intends to make the most of the herb's rich and varied history.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first draft of the Declaration of Independence was written
on hemp paper,'' a spokeswoman says. ``We intend to recycle that
wisdom.''
</P>
<P>
   Put that in your pipe and smoke it. &QL;

VIVA LA REVOLUTIONL! 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY   c.1998 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1937, Ernest Vincent Wright wrote a 50,000-word novel without
using the letter ``e.'' Perhaps exhausted by his labors, Wright
died the day his book was published.
</P>
<P>
   Wright's tragic end comes to mind as I contemplate a future
without Microsoft. No, they're not going out of business. I'm just
going to pretend that they have. I'm going to run a PC without
Microsoft's help, and live to tell the tale.
</P>
<P>
   It'll take some doing, but I'm going to set up my home computer
to rely entirely on non-Microsoft products. I'll try it for, say, a
month. Watch for occasional progress reports on my Web site
(http://www.monitortan.com).
</P>
<P>
   I won't be alone. Hang out in the geekier precincts of the
Internet, and you'll encounter legions of Microsoft-haters vowing
to seek a better way to compute. And the history of the past 20
years has taught me not to bet against the geeks.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly not now, when history appears to be on their side.
Regardless of their merits, the federal and state lawsuits against
Microsoft are helping to unleash years of pent-up rage at the
company's arrogance. That's been a godsend to a small but
burgeoning movement to supplant Windows with a radically different
software.
</P>
<P>
   You can't open a computer magazine any more without seeing an
article about ``open source'' software. These programs are
available free, along with the underlying computer code that makes
them work. With open source software, expert users can rewrite code
to suit their needs, while amateurs like me can get powerful
programs for little or no money.
</P>
<P>
   Even though it's free, open source software is no joke. Many of
the world's biggest Web sites are powered by a server program
called Apache. It's open source, and available for free. The most
popular program for running Internet e-mail systems is called
Sendmail _ another open source product. And the embattled browser
maker Netscape Communications Corp. is issuing an open source
version of Navigator, the world's most popular browser.
</P>
<P>
   I wrote a few months ago about the best-known open source
product. Linux is an alternative operating system for PCs that
works like the ultrapowerful Unix operating system developed by
AT&AMP;T Corp. in the 1970s. Developed by computer programmers around
the world in their spare time, Linux has come to be used at major
organizations like Xerox, Eastman Kodak and NASA.
</P>
<P>
   Linux's chief strength is that no one company owns it. That
means any programmer can create improvements and bug fixes. But
Linux's biggest drawback is also that no one company owns it.
That's a turn-off to most businesses who want a single source for
product service and support _ one of Microsoft's chief strengths.
</P>
<P>
   In my earlier column, I wrote that Netscape could win a new
lease on life by becoming a major distributor of Linux to
corporations. Give away the software _ sell the service and
support. Get rich quick. A few weeks later, I made the suggestion
to Netscape CEO Jim Barksdale. He rejected it out of hand, telling
me that an alternative operating system company wouldn't stand a
chance against Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Looks like this revolution will have to begin at the grass
roots, one PC at a time. I'll go first; you guys can follow me.
</P>
<P>
   I've already begun, with the help of System Commander Deluxe, a
cool disk utility available at any decent software store. System
Commander lets you chop your hard drive into multiple partitions
and store a different operating system in each one. To switch
operating systems, just reboot.
</P>
<P>
   I've got Windows 95, Windows 98 and Linux all happily
co-existing on my machine, and for the past couple of weeks I've
been tweaking the Linux setup, trying to get it ready for prime
time. It's not easy. Linux is geared to gearheads, and I'm being
forced to master cryptic commands like ``ls -alr''. (Go look it
up.)
</P>
<P>
   Linux must become a lot more user-friendly before it can win a
mass market. But If enough of us demand it, this will happen. After
another week of preparations, I'll begin my new job as designated
canary in the software coal mine. All Linux, all the time. No Gates
allowed. Will I wind up like Ernest Vincent Wright? Stay tuned.

EXPO CELEBRATES GAMES' SERIOUS BOOM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL SAUNDERS   c.1998 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Atlanta has been overrun several times in its history, but no
occupying army has had the flashy abandon of the hordes of computer
game professionals who descended on the city for the Electronic
Entertainment Expo.
</P>
<P>
   The bacchanal was equal parts gaudy trade show and
self-congratulatory celebration of the industry's unbridled boom.
One could argue that General Sherman's light show and fireworks
were more awe inspiring, but today's gamers would win any tussle
over who had the most financial impact. Sales of console video
games and PC game software rose 38 percent last year, making games
the fastest-growing segment of the entertainment industry,
according to the Interactive Digital Software Association.
</P>
<P>
   Total sales and rentals of games in 1997 was $5.6 billion, the
denomination that finally afforded ``those silly kid things'' a
measure of respect. There are about 16 million game consoles in US
homes, and about 40 percent of US homes have at least one personal
computer. First-tier games are unveiled with the same hype given
films and CDs, and often perform better. For example, Sony loves to
boast that the PlayStation game Final Fantasy VII made more money
than Demi Moore's film ``G.I. Jane,'' distributed by rival Buena
Vista. (Of course, this might be an apple and kumquats comparison:
Final Fantasy VII is one of the best games ever, and Moore is
nominated for Best Fight Scene in the 1998 MTV Movie Awards.)
</P>
<P>
   The expo, or E3, is most notable for game unveilings that offer
a view of the hot titles for the all-important holiday sales
season. There will be more games for girls, including a slate of
new titles from Purple Moon. These are based on reams of
sociological and market research that attempt to determine what
girls like and want in computer games. The newest Purple Moon game
is a sports adventure prompted by growing interest in girls'
athletics. Other games in the current stable focus on problem
solving and interactions _ exactly the kinds of things rarely found
in games geared toward boys.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of the testosterone set, there's another fast-twitch
fiber shooter on the horizon. Max Payne, a 3D game by the twisted
souls who set Duke Nukem loose on the world, will get its first
public preview at E3. This is likely to be one of the most
anticipated titles from 3D Realms, and one of the top sellers from
the new publishing and distribution house Gathering of Developers.
</P>
<P>
   It's expected to be a next-generation first-person action
shooter, but it has a rough release date of spring 1999. It's
likely to have some of the same campy elements of Duke Nukem,
especially the cheesy humor and high gore factor. So far, the story
reads like a classic Hollywood shoot-em-up: Max Payne is a tough
undercover cop on the lam after he was framed for the murder of his
boss. The setup may have been the work of the same people who
slaughtered Payne's family, so he becomes a one-man posse gunning
to rid New York City of its crime bosses, crackhead killers,
hitmen, sleazy pols, and a host of other ne'er-do-wells.
</P>
<P>
   Command &AMP; Conquer: Tiberian Sun is the third installment in the
wildly popular C&AMP;C series and will also preview at E3. The two
previous C&AMP;C titles (Command &AMP; Conquer and C&AMP;C: Red Alert) have
combined sales of 10 million games, making it the unrivaled leader
in the real-time strategy universe for PCs and console formats.
Last year, however, there was stiff competition on the PC front
from Total Annihilation, an excellent intergalactic war game from
Cavedog Entertainment that walked away with several top awards from
gaming magazines and industry press.
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, it's no surprise that this latest C&AMP;C is set
in the future, with a storyline that weaves the fates of the Global
Defense Initiative, or GDI, and its rival, the Brotherood of NOD.
Developer Westwood says Tiberian Sun will feature an all-new game
engine and improved controls, as well as more battlefield realism.
</P>
<P>
   There were also updates on developments in on-line gaming,
including the ongoing saga involving the Cyberathlete Professional
League, or CPL, and the Professional Gamers League, or PGL. The CPL
just scored marketing and promotional support from Babbage's and
Software Etc. The PGL is continuing to secure the services of some
of the world's hottest gamers, including Thresh, the Michael Jordan
of Quake.

answer Tripodistas' crucial questions on ``everything from keeping
the romance in a relationship and raising a family to dealing with

GERMAN INTERNET EXECUTIVE SENTENCED FOR PORNOGRAPHY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  (mk) 
 By ALAN COWELL c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BONN, Germany _ A judge in Bavaria sentenced the former head of
Compuserve Deutschland to two years in jail on charges of spreading
pornography, but suspended the sentence.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time in Germany that the manager of a provider
of Internet access had been held legally responsible for images
reached through its service.
</P>
<P>
   The manager, Felix Somm, was indicted in April 1997 on 13 counts
of distributing pornography involving children and animals in 1995
and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment raised an outcry among advocates of free
expression and among experts who argued that it was technically
impossible to block access to the material.
</P>
<P>
   Legislation approved after the indictment largely exempts
providers from legal responsibility for material beyond their
control.
</P>
<P>
   Under those laws, Somm's supporters said, it would have been
difficult to bring him to trial. Indeed, even in Somm's case, both
the defense and the prosecution in Munich argued Thursday in favor
of his acquittal.
</P>
<P>
   But the judge, Wilhelm Hubbert, responded, ``Even on the
Internet, there can be no lawless zones.''
</P>
<P>
   German authorities have set up police units to seek out Web
material they consider to be illegal, including child pornography,
bestiality, replication of Nazi symbols and material deemed to
``endanger youth,'' like violent games. But because many such sites
are managed from other countries, they have had no recorded
success.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling Thursday made little immediate difference in the
accessibility of pornographic sites by German computer users. One
computer operator said he had been able to obtain sexual material
involving children and animals through a variety of providers
Thursday.

BALANCE NEEDS WITH COST, LIFE SPAN
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   The two toughest columns to write each year are those in which I
suggest the minimum specifications for personal computer buyers.
The object of the exercise is to offer a configuration that will be
usable for a decent amount of time before inevitable obsolescence
sets in.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is what's called Moore's Law, the prime directive of
the computer industry, first laid out by Intel Corp. co-founder
Gordon Moore. It states that microprocessors _ the main brains of
personal computers _ get twice as powerful every 18 months, while
their prices stay the same.
</P>
<P>
   With ever-increasing power and ever-plummeting prices, many
prospective PC owners find themselves in consumer gridlock. They
hold off on buying, waiting forever for computer power to peak and
computer prices to bottom out.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, prices will always drop and computers will just get
more muscular. So, if you need a computer now _ buy one now. And
let the following recommendations be your guide:
</P>
<P>
   _ Processor: This always is the hardest decision to make. The
best way to approach it is to look at how you will use your
computer, both now and in the future.
</P>
<P>
   If your needs are minimal _ and you know they will be for a long
time to come _ you can do quite well with a standard Pentium MMX
system running at 233 megahertz. This is the kind of chip you'll
find powering a lot of the $999 PCs that are now available. If you
want a computer for word processing, tracking finances, Internet
access, children's software and basic game-playing, one of these
will do just fine.
</P>
<P>
   You also can consider Advanced Micro Devices' K6 chip, which
also powers some of the low-end systems.
</P>
<P>
   If you plan on working with graphics _ perhaps via a scanner or
digital camera _ then you should consider at least a 233-megahertz
Pentium II system. This also is a good choice if you want to set up
a home office. Working at home often requires running multiple
applications at once, faxing in the background and possibly
expanding to include a network.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, if you're interested in playing games, consider at
least a 266-or 300-megahertz Pentium II system. Nothing pushes a
PC's capabilities more than state-of-the-art games, a financial
irony. Serious gamers drop big money to have fun.
</P>
<P>
   _ Memory: The minimum amount of random access memory I'd
recommend remains at 32 megabytes, though if you can afford more,
get it. And make sure the system you buy has plenty of memory
expansion capabilities _ some of the sub-$1,000 machines are
severely limited in how much RAM they can hold. You want the option
of increasing to at least 96 megabytes.
</P>
<P>
   _ Hard Drive: The size of your hard drive, like the processor,
again depends on what you plan to do with it. For modest users, two
to three gigabytes of space is fine. Home-office users should
consider three or four gigabytes a minimum. And gamers should shoot
for four gigabytes or more.
</P>
<P>
   _ Video: This is another tough call to make, because video needs
vary depending on different factors.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a relatively small monitor _ 14 to 15 inches _
you'll likely be running at resolutions of 640-by-480 or 800-by-600
pixels. Users of larger monitors _ 17 to 19 inches and up _ will
use 800-by-600, 1,024-by-768 or possibly more. The more memory your
video card has, the greater the number of colors it can display at
higher resolutions, for a better on-screen look.
</P>
<P>
   Modest users with smaller monitors can get by with about two
megabytes of video RAM. If you have a larger monitor, four
megabytes is the minimum.
</P>
<P>
   And game-players will want a video card with fast 3-D
capabilities, supporting both Microsoft's Direct3D and Silicon
Graphics' OpenGL standards. Consider a separate 3-D add-on card
that uses 3Dfx Interactive's Voodoo or Voodoo2 chips if you're a
hard-core gamer.
</P>
<P>
   _ Monitors: Regardless of how you use a PC, you'll want at least
a 15-inch monitor with a maximum .28mm dot pitch. It should handle
resolutions up to 1,024-by-768 pixels or more at a refresh rate of
75 hertz.
</P>
<P>
   If you are the kind of user who runs several programs at once,
or are a gamer, you'll need maximum screen real estate and may want
to consider a 17-inch monitor.
</P>
<P>
   _ CD-ROM: Most off-the-shelf systems come with at least a 24X
CD-ROM drive, if not 32X, and this is beyond adequate. Most modern
software requires at least 2X or 4X drives.
</P>
<P>
   The big decision here is whether to get a DVD-ROM drive. There
is not much software that takes advantage of it now, though that
will change.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, there's no compelling reason to consider it if
you're on a budget, and it's something that can be added later.
</P>
<P>
   _ Audio: You'll want a 16-bit sound card with 32-voice wavetable
synthesis, which makes computerized MIDI music sound great. Gamers
may want to consider some of the new audio cards that plug into a
PCI slot and allow for realistic, 3-D sound.
</P>
<P>
   _ Modem: Nearly every system now comes with a 56K fax modem.
Make sure it's upgradable to the new v.90 56K standard, if it's not
there already. The two previous, conflicting standards, X2 and
K56flex, still are prevalent, so check with your Internet provider
to see which he or she has in place. The v.90 modem you buy likely
will support one or the other, but not both.
</P>
<P>
   _ Expansion: Even if you think you'll never want to add hardware
to your PC, consider any system's expandability. If the case can't
be opened and at least one card added, avoid it _ and the more open
slots, the better.
</P>
<P>
   Make sure the system can accept both PCI and ISA type cards. The
older ISA design is slowly being replaced by PCI, but you still
want the option to install an ISA card for now.
</P>
<P>
   So how much will the minimum cost you?
</P>
<P>
   A 233-megahertz Pentium II system with 32 megabytes of RAM, a

CHECK UPGRADE DATE TO FIND IF IT'S NEWER THAN WHAT YOU HAVE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I recently decided to see if a new driver was available for
my modem. I found the site but then realized that I couldn't tell
if this was an upgrade or not. How do I know when there is a new
driver available or if I am just reloading the already resident
driver?
</P>
<P>
   A: The best way to tell is by the date the upgrade was made
available, but first you have to determine the date of the driver
currently on your system.
</P>
<P>
   To do that, use the Device Manager feature of Windows 95.
Right-click on the My Computer icon, choose Properties and then
click on the Device Manager tab. You'll see a list of devices on
your computer _ double-click on Modem and you'll see the type of
modem you have. Now, double-click on that to bring up information
about the modem.
</P>
<P>
   You'll see a tab that says Driver. Click on it, and you'll see
information that includes a date.
</P>
<P>
   Next, go to your modem manufacturer's Web site and find the
upgrade. If the date of the downloadable driver is more recent than
what's on your screen, download it and install it. If not, leave it
alone.
</P>
<P>
   The process works for most of the other drivers on your system,
as well. And if you are having trouble locating the Web site for a
given manufacturer of a Windows-based piece of hardware or
software, try the list of company Web sites at Frank's World o'
Windows at www.conitech.com/windows/upmenu.asp.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My question regards the ``Suspend'' feature. I assume it puts
the computer in a low-power mode. Is suspend a good way to shut
down the computer after I'm done? I like the fact that you don't
have to wait for it to boot up, but I want to do what is best.
</P>
<P>
   A: The Suspend feature on newer computers works by saving what's
in memory to the hard drive, then partially powering down. When you
come back to the system and fire it up, your system is restored
just as you left it.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is with the ``just as you left it'' part.
</P>
<P>
   As you use Windows throughout the day, programs launch, grab
memory, and relinquish that memory when they are shut down _ or, at
least they are supposed to. Some buggy programs don't relinquish
memory, which eats away at your system's resources.
</P>
<P>
   Other programs may have small errors in them that aren't trapped
by Windows' error-snagging functions, which slightly destabilize
your system. You don't know this has happened until later, down the
road, when you have an odd glitch or, worse, a program crashes.
</P>
<P>
   The only way to clean out problems in Windows is to reboot the
computer. If you never reboot the computer and only use Suspend,
your system's memory becomes ``dirty.''
</P>
<P>
   I would suggest you use Suspend if you leave your computer on
all day and need to go away for a while. But at night, or for
extended periods, go ahead and shut it all the way down.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My system has a hard drive divided into three drives as C, D
and E. My C drive is getting full. When it fills up, will my system
automatically write programs on the next available drive? Or do I
need to start installing programs on D?
</P>
<P>
   A &UR; : &LR;  Once C is full, your system won't automatically start using
D. You'll have to manually install programs to your other drives.
</P>

<P>
   ``It's a phase!'' Gena Rowlands snaps at the notion that she may
be at height of her 50-year acting career. She's lived through
enough ups and downs to know better than to gloat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything's a phase,'' she adds, smiling drolly. ``I see most
things happening in 10- to 12-year increments. And when you've been
around as long as I have, you begin to see things more clearly.''
</P>
<P>
   Now in her mid-60s, Rowlands is a legend in the film world. But
as a woman she's not so easy to classify.
</P>
<P>
   Well-bred, worldly and streetwise at the same time, she manages
to be both a lady and a real broad _ an American Jeanne Moreau. In
fact, Rowlands has long been a popular icon in Europe, while she's
had more of a cult following at home.
</P>
<P>
   But even if her current renaissance is just a phase, it looks
like it will be a long one. She filmed three movies this year, a
thick pile of scripts arrives at her home every day _ and Sharon
Stone pays the questionable tribute of remaking ``Gloria,'' one of
the best films Rowlands made with her late husband, writer-director
John Cassavetes.
</P>
<P>
   Cassavetes (who died of liver cancer in 1989) had a bit of a
revival of his own last fall, when his last unproduced script,
``She's So Lovely,'' was directed by the couple's son, Nick
Cassavetes.
</P>
<P>
   Nick also directed his mother two years ago in ``Unhook The
Stars,'' a movie he wrote for her.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing an orange and claret Todd Oldham velvet robe and tightly
clutching her first coffee of the morning, Rowlands pads out of her
bedroom in the same Hollywood Hills home where Cassavetes shot the
movies ``Faces'' (1968), ``Opening Night'' (1977) and ``Love
Streams'' (1984).
</P>
<P>
   In the living room, her longtime makeup artist sits ready to
transform her for a photo shoot.
</P>
<P>
   ``See?'' she says, reiterating one of her oft-quoted lines, ``I
do look like a goldfish without my makeup.''
</P>
<P>
   With her live-in boyfriend, Bob Forrest, standing close by,
Rowlands immediately begins reminiscing about Cassavetes, the man
whom she credits for her success as an actress.
</P>
<P>
   ``My late husband made a lot of great pictures,'' she says. ``It
was a very creative time we were working in. That was followed by a
not-so-creative time, which I think we're still in. So people look
back with nostalgia. I think some of the magic of that time rubbed
off on me.''
</P>
<P>
   As the makeup artist works, Rowlands' thin red mouth becomes
more pronounced, her platinum bob gains a healthy pouf.
</P>
<P>
   ``Glamour was never my game,'' says the actress, who still
possesses her famously cool looks. ``I just hate that thing about
beauty. There's always someone out there better looking or worse
looking. Beauty and glamour are not real things. To depend on them
is very hard for anyone, but particularly hard for attractive
girls.''
</P>
<P>
   After finishing the photo session, Rowlands brings out pictures
that were taken on the set of ``Paulie,'' the film in which she
plays a woman who forms a bond with a talking parrot.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen different birds were used to play Paulie, as well as
several animatronic copies created by special-effects wizard Stan
Winston.
</P>
<P>
   ``The animated bird was very dear,'' Rowlands says. ``You forget
he's animated. But there was one live bird they used primarily _
and, well, I fell in love. It was unrequited, of course, but that
doesn't make it any less passionate!''
</P>
<P>
   In her most recent film ``Hope Floats,'' Rowlands plays a
taxidermist who's a constant source of embarrassment to her young
daughter, Sandra Bullock. Harry Connick Jr. plays Bullock's
boyfriend.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a studio picture, but it reads like an independent
picture because it's an examination of love,'' Rowlands says.
</P>
<P>
   She recalls dancing with Connick between takes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though we had tornadoes in Austin and some terrible
weather,'' she says, ``it might have been the happiest set I've
ever been on.''
</P>
<P>
   Happiness is not something one generally associates with Gena
Rowlands _ at least not onscreen. In most of her movies, she has
specialized in melancholy or madness, or something in between.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, I've had terrifying times of unhappiness,'' she
says. ``After John died, there were years of crippling insanity. I
couldn't work. But I've finally reconciled by realizing I had him
through all the good years. Nobody has everything all the time.
Yes, it's nine years ago this week that he died. And I have to say
I'm very happy. I adore my three children _ Nick, 39, and daughters
Alexandra and Zoe, both in their 20s. I have a lot of friends and a
lot of work.'' (Her third upcoming film is ``The Mighty,'' which
costars Sharon Stone.)
</P>
<P>
   Rowlands grew up in a small Wisconsin town, where her father was
a liberal politician. Her childhood wasn't entirely idyllic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a grandmother who didn't like me much,'' she says. ``I
only stopped blaming that on myself when I figured out she didn't
like my mother much, either. Nothing I did pleased her. And I was a
sickly kid, so that compounded things.''
</P>
<P>
   She decided early in her teens that she wanted to be an actress.
But after high school, she tried to put that goal aside and had a
brief, dispiriting stint at the University of Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a little breakdown, actually,'' she says. ``Now they'd
call it a `depression.' But we didn't have that word then. My
parents immediately understood _ they knew I was just in the wrong
place. So my mother took me to New York when I was 20 so I could
try to become an actress.''
</P>
<P>
   As a young adult, Rowlands says, she was ``terribly, terribly
serious _ as you can only be at that age. That's the nice thing
about getting older; you get somewhat lighter. We should all be
born old and finally return to our mother's wombs.''
</P>
<P>
   When she enrolled at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in
Manhattan, Rowland immediately noticed the brooding, intensely
handsome John Cassavetes _ but she did her best to avoid him.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I left Wisconsin, all I knew was that I didn't want to
get married or have children,'' she remembers. ``I assumed it
ruined your career. So I was desperate not to fall in love. I said
all the things people say _ only I meant them! Then one day I saw
John talking to someone and I thought _ `Oh, no!' And whenever I
saw him, I'd head the other way.''
</P>
<P>
   But when she performed in a production of Archibald MacLeish's
``Dangerous Corners,'' Cassavetes came backstage to seek her out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did have a very beautiful red dress on,'' Rowlands recalls
wistfully. ``I resisted him as long as I could.'' Which wasn't very
long: They married several months later.
</P>
<P>
   While Rowlands worked in the theater in the evenings, Cassavetes
formed an improvisational group with some fellow actors and began
working on what became his first film, ``Shadows.''
</P>
<P>
   While his films are considered classics now, Cassavetes and his
troupe were vilified at the time for dealing so directly with such
subjects as alcoholism, infidelity and mental illness.
</P>
<P>
   ``People attacked us wildly,'' Rowlands says. ``They were not
used to having their emotions so engaged or seeing anything so
intimate on screen. John's films weren't particularly sexual _ they
were all about love. People felt exposed. But years later, women
started coming up to me crying about ``A Woman Under the
Influence.'' They said it was a catharsis for them. And men
admitted it was something they'd never understood.
</P>
<P>
   Rowlands is still close with many of the actors who appeared in
Cassavetes' films, including Peter Falk, Ben Gazzara and Seymour
Cassell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not real sociable,'' she says. ``I never have been. But we
revealed ourselves through acting, and we often made fools of
ourselves. That created bonds. Acting is endlessly fascinating _ if
you expose yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Rowlands admits that she can still wake up profoundly
depressed _ ``I have great variations in moods,'' is how she puts
it _ but she tries to channel it all into her work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, `What'll it be today? Let's do something with this.'
For me, acting heals. To put one foot in front of another when
you're in an awful mood _ that kind of pressure is so good. I never
found acting scary. I found it an immense relief.''
</P>
<P>
   Although she has now worked with many other directors _ Woody
Allen on ``Another Woman,'' Lasse Halstrom on ``Once Around'' and
``Something to Talk About'' _ it's clear that she'll always
consider her partnership with Cassavetes to be her most precious
accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   Still, she's not the type to retreat into a nostalgic haze. In
fact, the older she gets, the more she feels the need to reinvent
herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives you new energy and keeps life exciting _ and most of
all, bearable,'' she says. ``I realized that after John died.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives you a chance to change your baggage and your opinion
of yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At a certain age,'' she adds, ``you realize that you must be
reincarnated throughout your life. You certainly don't have to wait
until you die.''

get married or have children,'' she remembers. ``I assumed it
ruined your career. So I was desperate not to fall in love. I said
all the things people say _ only I meant them! Then one day I saw
John talking to someone and I thought _ `Oh, no!' And whenever I
saw him, I'd head the other way.''
</P>
<P>
   But when she performed in a production of Archibald MacLeish's
``Dangerous Corners,'' Cassavetes came backstage to seek her out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did have a very beautiful red dress on,'' Rowlands recalls
wistfully. ``I resisted him as long as I could.'' Which wasn't very
long: They married several months later.
</P>
<P>
   While Rowlands worked in the theater in the evenings, Cassavetes
formed an improvisational group with some fellow actors and began
working on what became his first film, ``Shadows.''
</P>
<P>
   While his films are considered classics now, Cassavetes and his
troupe were vilified at the time for dealing so directly with such
subjects as alcoholism, infidelity and mental illness.
</P>
<P>
   ``People attacked us wildly,'' Rowlands says. ``They were not
used to having their emotions so engaged or seeing anything so
intimate on screen. John's films weren't particularly sexual _ they
were all about love. People felt exposed. But years later, women
started coming up to me crying about ``A Woman Under the
Influence.'' They said it was a catharsis for them. And men
admitted it was something they'd never understood.
</P>
<P>
   Rowlands is still close with many of the actors who appeared in
Cassavetes' films, including Peter Falk, Ben Gazzara and Seymour
Cassell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not real sociable,'' she says. ``I never have been. But we
revealed ourselves through acting, and we often made fools of
ourselves. That created bonds. Acting is endlessly fascinating _ if
you expose yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Rowlands admits that she can still wake up profoundly
depressed _ ``I have great variations in moods,'' is how she puts
it _ but she tries to channel it all into her work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, `What'll it be today? Let's do something with this.'
For me, acting heals. To put one foot in front of another when
you're in an awful mood _ that kind of pressure is so good. I never
found acting scary. I found it an immense relief.''
</P>
<P>
   Although she has now worked with many other directors _ Woody
Allen on ``Another Woman,'' Lasse Halstrom on ``Once Around'' and
``Something to Talk About'' _ it's clear that she'll always
consider her partnership with Cassavetes to be her most precious
accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   Still, she's not the type to retreat into a nostalgic haze. In
fact, the older she gets, the more she feels the need to reinvent
herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives you new energy and keeps life exciting _ and most of
all, bearable,'' she says. ``I realized that after John died.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives you a chance to change your baggage and your opinion
of yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At a certain age,'' she adds, ``you realize that you must be
reincarnated throughout your life. You certainly don't have to wait
until you die.''

COMPUTERS GIVE CHURCHES A DIGITAL HELPING HAND 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PARKER   c.1998 San Antonio Express-News   SAN ANTIONO _
Not long ago, most congregations kept their financial records in
ledger books, while membership activities were tracked by hand and
kept in many different files.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Compiling information for monthly reports was a slow, tedious
job.
</P>
<P>
   But computer software has revolutionized the gathering and use
of information.
</P>
<P>
   Need to know how much Joe Smith owes on his $2,000 pledge to the
building fund? Presto, punch a computer button and there it is.
</P>
<P>
   It's midmonth and you wonder how close the parish is to
exceeding the budget? Poof, up come the figures on the computer
screen, revealing that last Sunday's collection was higher than
expected, so there's a bit of a cushion.
</P>
<P>
   Or the youth group's bus broke down and 100 parents must be
notified that their children will be late arriving home.
</P>
<P>
   Make 100 phone calls? Nope. Record one message on the phone tree
and it does the rest, calling the parents automatically.
</P>
<P>
   ``Computers have absolutely revolutionized financial record
keeping and our ability to track people,'' said Ronnie Loughlin,
minister of education and administration at First Baptist Church in
San Angelo, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can record contacts with potential new members, track their
status and determine how many visits it takes before someone
decides to become a member,'' Loughlin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Financial records are up to date on any given day. You don't
have to wait until the end of the month.''
</P>
<P>
   Hal Campbell, president of Automated Church Systems, a church
software company in Florence, S.C., said technology can help
churches keep detailed information on people's interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether someone works on cars or does carpentry, the
information is readily accessible. If a widow needs work done, we
can pull up a list of members and see who can help,'' Campbell
said.
</P>
<P>
   Many large churches are creating ``cell groups'' that meet
regularly in homes, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell said such groups can obtain information from the church
by computer, saving a trip to the church.
</P>
<P>
   Ernie Hamilton, president of Shelby Systems in Memphis, Tenn.,
another church software company, said a secretary at one work
station can send electronic mail or hundreds of messages and
produce newsletters that once had to be contracted out.
</P>
<P>
   Debbie Vignes, business manager at Alamo Heights United
Methodist Church in San Antonio, said Shelby Systems' integrated
software makes her work much simpler.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keeping track of 3,800 members' activities would be awfully
tedious by hand. I don't know how any church does without
computers,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Vignes said the church staff knows how often each family
attends, how much they contribute, who visits and what ministries
interest them.
</P>
<P>
   The church welcomes them and gives them information on upcoming
activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone misses several Sundays, we call to say we missed
them and see if they have problems or needs,'' she said.

 CPT- COMPUTERS-BOMBAY-COLUMN-TEX 
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Dr. EMILIO BOMBAY c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram  DEAR DR.
BOMBAY: My desktop has an Internet icon that suddenly started
giving the following message: Windows cannot find iexplore.exe. I
can still get to the Internet via the Start menu.
<TEXT>
<P>
   _ Gone But Not Forgotten
</P>
<P>
   DEAR GONE: It's that sneaky Janet Reno again, going from house
to house, computer to computer, purging Internet Explorer along the
way to make democracy safe from Bill Gates and his evil minions.
</P>
<P>
   Well, either that or your desktop icon lost track of where IE is
stashed, maybe because you installed it to someplace other than the
usual folder. You could right-click on the icon, go into Properties
and point the thing in the right direction, but that's too much
work. Why not just drag a copy of the working shortcut out onto
your desktop? Just don't let Janet know I told you. She'll be
knocking on my door wanting to dismantle me next.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: Out of utter disgust with Windows and the fact
that Bill Gates is Satan _ only not as bright _ I thought of
converting to Macintosh. Since I don't want to pay $3,500 for a new
computer, I was wondering if it is possible to run the Mac
operating system on an Intel machine.
</P>
<P>
   _ Macinstein
</P>
<P>
   DEAR MACINSTEIN: Sure it is, if you don't mind great clouds of
smoke filling your house and sparks shooting everywhere. From time
to time, some well-meaning brainiac comes up with a way to run Mac
stuff on a PC, and it usually involves an expensive, circus-act
add-on microprocessor card. Listen, if you're going over to the
other side, stop straddling the fence.
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to spend $3,500, either. The lowest-priced G3 can
be had for $1,700. Once you add a monitor and modem, it's about
2,300 bucks. If you go nuts and want the top of the line fully
tricked out, you could spend as much as $9,000, but what sort of
loony would do that? These prices are direct from the Apple Store
at www.apple.com, so all you Appleheads, don't write another bunch
of nasty letters implying that my head is full of fertilizer.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't want to spend $2,300, then wait until August, when
you can get a new iMac for 1,300 bucks. It's got a dinky, built-in
monitor (13.8 inches viewable) and looks sort of like a Philco TV
straight out of the '50s, but it's packing a 233-MHz G3 chip and is
specially designed for cruising the Internet. Current specs list it
with a 33.6 modem, but let's hope that changes to 56K, because most
of us still connect through phone lines and won't be using the
iMac's network connector. Oh, and the last I heard, the floppy
drive is extra, although it does have a CD-ROM. The iMac is still a
lot of bang for your buck, though.
</P>
<P>
   But are you sure you really want to abandon the PC altogether?
It's not nearly as much fun to kick Steve Jobs around as it is Big
Bill.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: Being a senior citizen with a new computer, I
would enjoy seeing a list of all Internet providers, pros and cons,
monthly charges, etc.
</P>
<P>
   _ Hook Me Up
</P>
<P>
   DEAR HOOK: Go find somebody who's already online and check out
thelist.internet.com for a rundown of more than 4,500 providers.
But that sounds a little intense for me. I'd check out the Yellow
Pages first. Just remember, anybody who'd ask for more than 20
bucks a month for regular dial-up service is goofy in the head. You
can probably find a company that charges an ultra-cheap rate, say
100 bucks or so, if you sign up for a year. Others charge even less
for daytime-only use, and I assure you those pictures of Courtney
Thorne-Smith are just as hot at noon as at midnight.

3DO's Latest Incarnation 
By Julia Angwin c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  Trip Hawkins is
reinventing himself _ again.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hawkins, once one of Silicon Valley's most outspoken
personalities, has kept mum since his video game business crashed
two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Now he is launching himself _ and his company, 3DO _ back into
the public eye at the E3 gaming industry conference today in
Atlanta. With almost a dozen new games and a $30 million war chest,
3DO will unveil its transformation from a hardware maker to a
software company.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm back and I've brought an army with me,'' Hawkins says, in
joking reference to 3DO's nearly 300 employees.This is the third
time Hawkins has reinvented himself. His current attempt to rise
from the ashes illustrates that failure is a respectable business
credential in risk-driven Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people talk about his failures, but they don't talk
about how he got all these people to invest in his vision,'' said
David Cole, senior analyst at DFC Intelligence, a market research
firm in San Diego. ``That's pretty impressive to me _ I don't think
you can count the guy out.''
</P>
<P>
   Hawkins, 44, has always been a good salesman first and foremost.
In his initial incarnation, he was a brash young entrepreneur who
sold the game software industry on a new business model.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than follow the practices of the software industry, which
sells software through distributors, Hawkins saw that computer game
publishing was an entertainment business that needed to emulate
Hollywood's model.
</P>
<P>
   So he started selling software directly to retailers _ much as
movie studios pitch their movies directly to theaters.
</P>
<P>
   The game industry converted to the idea in the early '80s after
seeing the success of the company Hawkins founded, Electronic Arts.
The San Mateo software games behemoth now has sales near $1 billion
and is the No. 1 independent maker of software games.
</P>
<P>
   After building Electronic Arts into a monster, Hawkins decided
in 1993 to tackle another side of the games industry _ the
hardware. Hawkins pocketed approximately $100 million when he left.
</P>
<P>
   Fed up with the clunky video game machines on the market,
Hawkins came up with an idea for a game device called the 3DO _ a
video game machine that connected to TV sets and used CD-ROMs
instead of cartridges. It ended up being a forerunner of the Sony
PlayStation and Sega Saturn.
</P>
<P>
   In his second incarnation, Hawkins convinced investors such as
AT&AMP;T to pour nearly $75 million into his Redwood City-based
startup, called The 3DO Company. He pitched his story as a
patriotic one _ American boy up against the Japanese game
manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   The hype surrounding the machine was spectacular, running up the
company's stock to $48 five months after it went public at $15 per
share in May 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Hawkins, a trim, athletic man who spends his spare time climbing
mountains and in the front row at Giants games, also became a media
celebrity. He was named one of People Magazine's 50 Most Beautiful
People in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   But the 3DO game machine never panned out. At $700 each, the
devices were too expensive for most customers, especially compared
to cheaper machines from Sony, Sega and Nintendo.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, when 3DO's stock had sunk to $3 per share, Hawkins
decided to give up on the hardware business and turn 3DO's
attention to software. He says now the main problem was that 3DO
wasn't manufacturing its gaming devices _ it just licensed the
technology to manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a fundamentally unstable business structure because we
didn't have any control over anything,'' Hawkins said.
</P>
<P>
   However, there was one saving grace to his exit from the
hardware business. In 1996, Hawkins sold an advanced video gaming
technology to Matsushita for $100 million in cash.
</P>
<P>
   3DO has been riding on that cash infusion during the past two
years, as Hawkins _ in his third incarnation _ struggles to turn
the firm into a software games company.
</P>
<P>
   During the transition, Hawkins has been uncharacteristically
quiet, shunning industry functions and declining to hold press
conferences. He first resurfaced in public at an industry
conference in Napa last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Hawkins, who is known for his supremely confident attitude,
shocked the attendees by admitting that he'd made mistakes with
3DO.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought I would see the day where Trip said, `I was
wrong,''' said Johnny Wilson, editor-in-chief of Computer Gaming
World magazine and a longtime friend of Hawkins who attended the
conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any hint of what I used to perceive as ego or arrogance
appears to have disappeared,'' Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's a more subdued Hawkins who is leading the reinvention
of 3DO.
</P>
<P>
   The new 3DO is not seeking to shatter any business models or
take on the Japanese. It simply wants to build good-quality games
for personal computers and video game consoles.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in two years, 3DO has taken a booth at the E3
gaming software conference.
</P>
<P>
   At the show, 3DO will show off 11 new games to an industry where
many had assumed 3DO was dead. Rather than breaking new ground,
however, 3DO is pursuing the standard gamut of games _ from
medieval adventures to blackjack and war strategy.
</P>
<P>
   And it will unveil its new advertising campaign ``3DO _ We're
Here to Play.''
</P>
<P>
   Hawkins will also host the game industry's first awards ceremony
_ which is designed to be gaming's version of the Academy Awards.
</P>
<P>
   Hawkins said he expects to encounter skepticism about his new
vision but that he is committed to doing what he loves.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people have asked, `Why is Trip still at 3DO?''' he
said. ``My answer is, `Why not? This is who I am. What else would I
do?'''

Netscape's Grip on Browsers Slipping 
By Jon Swartz c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  Netscape
Communications is losing its grip on the Web browser market.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Mountain View company _ which pioneered Web browsing and
owned as much as 80 percent of the market in 1996 _ now has just
over half of the domestic browser market and is in danger of being
passed by Microsoft this year, a national Internet study shows.
</P>
<P>
   Navigator's market share in January was 54 percent, down from 63
percent a year ago. Microsoft's Internet Explorer, by comparison,
doubled to 39 percent from 21 percent in January 1997, according to
ZD Market Intelligence in La Jolla, San Diego County.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although more people use Navigator, the clear winner was
Microsoft,'' said senior analyst David Tremblay of ZD Market
Intelligence. ``The government's lawsuit against Windows 98 and
Netscape's decision to give away its browser could slow down the
rate, but all trends indicate that Internet Explorer will continue
to eat away at Navigator's share.''
</P>
<P>
   Some 24.2 million personal computers in the United States now
use a Netscape browser, while Internet Explorer is used on 17.3
million PCs, the survey said. Nearly 5.6 million PCs have both
products.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, based on information culled from 50,000 U.S.
households, echoes a Dataquest study released last year that
predicts Internet Explorer will bypass Navigator some time this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Among the report's other findings:
</P>
<P>
   _Nearly 45 million PCs in the United States have Web access, up
43 percent from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   _Some 10 million domestic PCs were used for shopping on the
Internet, compared with 3.7 million a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   _The average PC is connected to the Internet for 4.5 hours a
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``In just two years, the Internet has become a home-PC
mainstay,'' Tremblay said.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has made huge strides in the browser market by
including Internet Explorer with its market-leading Windows 95
operating system _ a tactic that the Justice Department says
violates a 1995 antitrust agreement. The two sides are scheduled to
meet in a federal court on September 8 to determine if Windows 98,
which will combine Web browsing and the operating system into a
single product, is anti-competitive.
</P>
<P>
   While the browser-share results represent a marketing victory
for Microsoft, it doesn't add anything to the bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Browser share is a nonissue in terms of revenues,'' said
analyst Jim Balderston of Zona Research in Redwood City. ``The
market has annual revenues of zero dollars, but it is crucial if
you want to establish an access point from which consumers surf the
Web.''
</P>
<P>
   Netscape agrees. After initially charging $50 for Navigator, it
started giving away its browser in January. The company is now
concentrating on selling software to corporations and building its
NetCenter Web site into a major Internet portal to attract
advertising and online transactions.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy comes with a downside, however. Netscape is losing
Navigator as a significant revenue producer and creating a
temporary hole in its financial results.
</P>
<P>
   It lost $88 million in its fourth quarter, forcing 300 layoffs,
and if not for creating an abbreviated quarter in January, it would
have reported a second-quarter loss on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a legal, but interesting bit of aggressive accounting,''
Balderston said. ``By shifting their yearly reporting cycle, they
were able to dump a $54 million loss in January so they could break
even (in May).''
</P>
<P>
   ``What these results and the browser-share numbers indicate is
that the anything-is-possible days of Netscape have passed,'' he
said. ``They can still be a profitable company, but they better do
it soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft shares improved $2.38, to $86, yesterday. Netscape's
stock was up $1.88, to $25.75.

COMMISSION REJECTS GERMAN MEDIA ALLIANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   (ja)  
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Europe's antitrust regulators Wednesday blocked an ambitious
digital television alliance among three of Germany's most powerful
media companies, marking a milestone in the growing power of the
European Commission over events in individual countries.
</P>
<P>
   After months of negotiations, the Brussels-based European
Commission rejected the proposed alliance among Bertelsmann AG,
Germany's giant publishing and media conglomerate; Deutsche Telekom
AG, the nation's dominant telephone and cable television company,
and the Kirch Group, the Munich-based company that owns the German
rights to billions of dollars worth of television programs and
movies.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was a big setback for developers of advanced
television services in Germany. Because Germany is by far the
largest television market in Europe, the collapse of the venture
could affect the balance of power among Europe's other media
conglomerates.
</P>
<P>
   It also creates major problems for Leo Kirch, the secretive but
highly successful founder of the Kirch Group. His privately held
company has invested billions of dollars in digital TV, much of it
by buying rights to Hollywood movies. But it lacks enough of its
own customers to make the gamble pay off.
</P>
<P>
   The three companies wanted to deliver a wide array of pay-TV
services, including dozens of television channels as well as
pay-per-view movies and live sports events.
</P>
<P>
   Karel van Miert, Europe's powerful and pugnacious competition
commissioner, has warned for months that the proposed pact would
create an unacceptable monopoly and has demanded numerous changes
in the deal that would give other companies a chance to compete.
</P>
<P>
   Among Van Miert's demands, Bertelsmann said, was that the
companies make their system accessible to competing TV programmers
and that they allow rivals to buy and resell their shows and movies
at prices favorable to the competitors.
</P>
<P>
   After a last-ditch meeting on Tuesday with Kirch and Michael
Dornemann, a top Bertelsmann executive, Van Miert announced that
attempts to reach a compromise had failed and that the European
Commission had formally rejected the alliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to find a solution that allowed the market to remain
open,'' Van Miert said. ``I went as far as to make a verbal
proposal that was agreed to by Kirch, but totally refused by
Bertelsmann.''
</P>
<P>
   Dornemann, who oversees Bertelsmann's BMG Entertainment group,
confirmed that his company had finally decided against making any
further concessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``They demanded a lot, and we agreed to several levels of
concessions,'' Dornemann said in a telephone interview. ``I call
their latest requests a demand to subsidize our competitors.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Dornemann said that Bertelsmann was still open to
discussions about other kinds of relationships with the Kirch
Group, he said the current plans to merge their pay-TV ventures
``are over.''
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, all three companies in the proposed alliance had
been preoccupied with gaining an advantage over the other.
Bertelsmann and Kirch both own stakes in Premiere, Germany's
existing pay-television service that delivers several channels of
hit movies by satellite. Kirch owns DF-1, an ambitious digital
television service that offers dozens of channels and elaborate
pay-per-view services.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Telekom is Germany's dominant cable TV operator, and
most German households receive their television programming over
cable rather than via satellite. It was trying to gain power as a
programming packager and marketer.
</P>
<P>
   Kirch's problem has always been a lack of customers _ it has
about 30,000 subscribers, and industry analysts estimate that it
needs at least 200,000 to break even. Kirch has wanted to combine
DF-1 with Premiere, which has more than a million customers and
would provide the core customer base. But Bertelsmann had long been
against the idea, and holds a veto over major decisions at
Premiere.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the three companies reached a precarious deal to work
together. But Van Miert quickly raised objections, arguing that the
three companies would have clear monopoly power unless there were
major changes to the plan.

The Well Is Leaking, But It's Not Yet Dry 
By Tom Abate 
c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  The Well, the online discussion
group that pioneered the notion of cyber communities, is in hot
water.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Membership, which peaked at 10,000 two years ago, has slumped to
7,000, and sources say about 400 members a month are bailing out.
</P>
<P>
   Well Executive Director Gail Williams disputed those attrition
figures and said the number of conference participants has
stabilized at around 7,000.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, The Well's owner, Rockport shoe millionaire Bruce
Katz, is searching for a buyer. But critics say his $2-million-plus
asking price is too high.
</P>
<P>
   The Well's troubles, like the woes at Wired Magazine, prove that
being first does not guarantee success in the Internet age.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1985 by visionary Stewart Brand, the Sausalito-based
Well became the favorite online hangout of writers and
intellectuals at a time when the Internet was peopled mainly by
nerds.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 90s, as the Internet was going mainstream, Katz
entered the picture. He bought half, then full ownership of The
Well for about $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   He pumped in more money, hoping to leverage The Well's
reputation to make it a leading Internet service provider as well
as a high-brow chat room.
</P>
<P>
   The expansion flopped, largely for want of direction from Katz,
who spends several months a year on his sailboat. In 1996, he hired
online entrepreneur Maria Wilhelm to help run the business.
</P>
<P>
   She quit in January after failing to buy The Well. Her
lieutenant, Ed Long, quit in April, leaving Williams in charge of
the diminished operation.
</P>
<P>
   The Well sold its ISP business _ Whole Earth Networks _ early
this year, making it mainly dependent on the $10 to $15 a month it
charges members to participate in conferences.
</P>
<P>
   No one expects The Well to dry up, as long as its core group of
conferees continue to make it one of the most provocative
think-holes on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still feel intimidated when I post there because there are
so many really smart people reading,'' said longtime Well-head
Bruce Koball.
</P>
<P>
   Katz e-mailed me, promising that The Well is ``not going away''
as he searches for ``just the right buyer for this most famous of
online communities.''
</P>
<P>
   And so The Well drifts, a backwater in the cyberspace that its
members helped create.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Docu-dreaming: &LR;  San Francisco filmmaker Jay Capela is praying
for angels to cough up the $400,000 he needs to finish editing a
three-hour documentary on Silicon Valley startups.
</P>
<P>
   Called WildStart, the film goes behind the scenes at 15 firms
ranging from the well-known WebTV to the wacky Rotary Rocket, a
Redwood Shores firm that dreams of building a rocket with
helicopter rotors in its nose cone, so it can swoop gently to the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``I envision this as a cross between Hoop Dreams and Triumph of
the Nerds,'' said Capela, who is co-producing the film with
software entrepreneur Eric Swildens (see www.wildatstart.com).
</P>
<P>
   After viewing a 12-minute trailer they're showing investors,
WildStart strikes me as a bit too ``Lifestyles of the Rich &AMP;
Famous.''
</P>
<P>
   Capela wants the production to be edgy and realistic, but so
far, all 15 of his subject firms are making it. In the real world,
90 percent of all startups fail.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll go back and find some bombs,'' he promises _ after they
get the money to bring his project to a happy ending.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; True lies: &LR;  Former Microsoft engineer Daniel Oran has penned a
new fiction, ``Ulterior Motive.'' It revolves around a
Seattle-based software giant, Megasoft, whose chairman, Jack
Malcolm, is running for President.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, the lead character is based more on Ross Perot than
Bill Gates,'' said Oran, who has posted a synopsis on his Web site
(www.book98.com).
</P>
<P>
   Oran won't say whether Malcolm wins the Oval Office (and fires
the antitrust department). But rest assured that when the
billionaire gets attacked at a public appearance, it isn't with
cream puffs!

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   &HT;    Game makes you pick: Rock, or hard place?
 &HT;    By Emily J. Minor
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ It's none of his business, but, still,
Randy Horn would like to know the answer to this very bizarre and
totally meaningless question:
</P>
<P>
   Would you rather lose your perspective, or your sense of
balance?
</P>
<P>
   And now, if you've got some time, the 30-year-old Mr. Horn has
1,499 additional questions all boxed up and ready for your
consideration and, of course, each and every one of them is of
equal absurdity and unimportance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am finding that some people think I am what's wrong with
America,'' says Horn about his new invention, the board game
Zobmondo!!
</P>
<P>
   Horn is hoping, of course, that he'll get rich, just like those
two bartenders who in the mid-'80s came up with that crazy game
called Pictionary. Those guys made about a gazillion dollars on a
game they played themselves for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're golfing now,'' Horn said.
</P>
<P>
   But Horn's a little realistic about this get-rich thing because,
you see, his game has an edge to it that Pictionary does not.
Mainly, you have to have a sense of humor, you have to be able to
take the questions with a grain of salt. And you have to be willing
to answer the situation, regardless of its grossness or
ridiculousness.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one's actually doing this stuff,'' Horn assures.
</P>
<P>
   Would you rather never be able to sleep lying down _ OR _
instantly fall asleep every time you sit down? (You win or lose by
trying to guess how players will answer and advancing on the
board.)
</P>
<P>
   The idea started about 10 years ago when Horn earned a
reputation in college for always asking the ridiculous questions,
whether at a party or on a date. His favorite:
</P>
<P>
   How much money, in cash, would it cost to eat a live, kicking,
two-inch cockroach?
</P>
<P>
   ``I could sit and talk with my friends about that question for
an hour,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   So, he devised a series of pizza parties for his UCLA classmates
to socialize and invent new questions. He ended up with about 800.
After that, he hired 30 comedy writers to write questions and ended
up with about 6,000. From that, he pared it down to 1,500 for
Zobmondo!! Horn figures he's got about $90,000 sunk into the game's
research and production.
</P>
<P>
   Some questions were even too over-the-edge for Randy Horn which,
of course, means we won't be telling you about them in this
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   But, we're curious.
</P>
<P>
   Would you rather yank 12 inches of masking tape off the hairiest
part of your body _ OR _ have to remove a fishhook wedged 1/8 of an
inch into your thumb?
</P>
<P>
   Don't `Oo, gross,' us. Blame Randy Horn.
</P>
<P>
   Zombondo!! retails for $34.95 and is sold in only one Florida
store, The Game Keeper, in the small town of Ocoee, west of
Orlando. Call that store at (407) 523-0966 to order by credit card
or call the Zobmondo!! toll-free number at (800) 417-0017.

 &HT;    Not one but two perfect SAT scores grace Florida's Suncoast High
School
 &HT;    By Stephanie Desmon
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIVIERA BEACH, Fla. _ Jason Kelly did it first. And if there's
any kid you want your kid to follow off that bridge, it's Jason
Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   The Suncoast High School junior scored a perfect 1,600 on his
SATs in March, so classmate Blake Gottlieb figured he'd better give
those study guides a workout.
</P>
<P>
   Gottlieb got the good news in a crisp envelope 10 days ago: He,
too, scored a 1,600.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little jealous,'' Gottlieb conceded Tuesday. ``If he
didn't get a 1,600, I don't know if I would have worked as hard. .
. . I kind of owe it to him a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Such perfection is pretty rare. Of last year's 1,127,021 U.S.
high school graduates who took the SAT _ now called the Scholastic
Assessment Test _ 453 earned top scores.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is the first time we've had two,'' Suncoast
Principal Kay Carnes said.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly and Gottlieb, both 17, will tell you they're good buddies
who don't compete for grades. They even studied together for the
SAT.
</P>
<P>
   And they'll tell you that getting a 1,600 doesn't mean they're
super brains.
</P>
<P>
   ``The SAT is not a measure of intelligence,'' said Gottlieb, who
lives in Palm Beach Gardens. ``It's all about knowing how to take
the test. We cracked it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gottlieb is one of those guys who loves math. He took advanced
placement calculus Advanced Placement Calculus as a freshman and
just kept going from there. He's in the Math Club (not to mention
the National Honor Society, the varsity swim team and more).
</P>
<P>
   He has a 4.0 grade average, mostly because he likes the
``symmetry'' of it. The 1,600 adds to that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a perfectionist,'' he said. Besides, ``you get one B,
everyone knows about it. You can't let that happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Fellow math lover Kelly has a classload filled with challenging
International Baccalaureate courses. He's in the National Honor
Society and Key Club and is a member of the chess team, which went
to nationals this year.
</P>
<P>
   As for the SAT, the Jupiter teen simply feels good because he
doesn't have to take it again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really is a big relief,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Neither student is sure where he'll attend college after
graduating next year. Kelly is fascinated by the field of genetic
engineering and said he'll probably choose a course of study to get
him there.
</P>
<P>
   Gottlieb has wanted to be an astronaut since fourth grade, when
he heard astronaut Mike Mullane lecture on the key to reaching the
heights he had.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `If you want to be an astronaut, here's what you do:
Study. Study. Study,' '' Gottlieb said. ``That's what I did.

REBOOTING BILL GATES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER   c.1998 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The eye-catching new product from Microsoft Corp.
cannot be found in a shrink-wrapped box or downloaded onto your
computer. But it is getting a vigorous tryout these days on the
nation's largest networks.
</P>
<P>
   TV networks, that is. And in major newspapers. And all over the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The rollout of Bill Gates, the new and improved version 2.0,
began a few months ago, long before Microsoft was hit last Monday
with potentially damaging antitrust complaints by the US Justice
Department and 20 state attorneys general. Now it's in high gear.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than using lawyers and surrogates, Microsoft has put its
billionaire chairman right out front to parry the government's
claims. It is a crucial role. The courtroom battle will not begin
until fall, but customers and business partners are forming
opinions about the company right now.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft wants to show that it is not some kind of
reincarnation of the 19th-century robber barons, but rather the
gutsy, leading edge of American prosperity, a company willing to
fight the government on behalf of consumers and entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lawsuit has them concerned about this negative impression
that they are some kind of monopoly that goes to any lengths to
achieve dominance,'' said Larry Weber, chairman of Weber Public
Relations Worldwide in Cambridge, Mass. ``It's going to impact the
way their customers view them, and maybe even stall some buying
decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft denies it is marketing or repackaging its most visible
executive. But in the months before the antitrust suit was filed,
Gates had made news by showing up at schools that receive free
Microsoft software. He hawked Big Bertha golf clubs, letting on in
the ad copy that he likes golf but, aw shucks, even a billionaire
finds the game frustrating.
</P>
<P>
   People who watch the sometimes-testy mogul say he has even
switched to trendier eyeglasses and has neatened up his haircut.
And the man who once walked out on a Connie Chung interview agreed
in January to sit for celebrity chit-chat with Barbara Walters. The
segment allowed Gates to reveal that he takes singing lessons and
expects his lifetime donations to charity to top $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   By design or not, Gates seems eager to show himself as less geek
and more chic, or at least something of a common guy.
</P>
<P>
   The apparent transformation came just in time for Gates to take
one of his most important roles: chief defender of Microsoft during
the landmark antitrust case.
</P>
<P>
   As talks to settle the lawsuit collapsed last weekend, Microsoft
filmed an in-house interview with its chairman and made it
available to TV stations by satellite. It posted a self-generated
question-and-answer interview with Gates on the Internet. And when
the lawsuit was finally filed, it was Gates himself who defended
the company at a press conference at Microsoft headquarters in
Redmond, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday (May 19), one day after the suit was filed, Microsoft
ran full-page advertisements in newspapers, billed as a letter from
Gates to customers, shareholders, and business partners. The
following day, The Wall Street Journal ran an opinion piece under
Gates's byline on its influential editorial page.
</P>
<P>
   The thrust of these ads and appearances was the same: The
company tried earnestly to settle the anti-trust suits, Gates said,
but government lawyers wanted it to trade away the right to make
better products for consumers. The company _ not the government _
should be trusted with the job of designing software.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is textbook public relations,'' Weber said.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft is smart to make Gates the front man for the company,
Weber and others said. His products introduced millions of people
to the computer age, and Gates created billions of dollars in
wealth for investors (and for himself) by guiding Microsoft to
fantastic success. The company is now the second-most valuable on
any US stock exchange, after only General Electric Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a helluva lot of people in this country who admire
his skill and entrepreneurial spirit,'' said John Brodeur, chief
executive of the Boston PR firm Brodeur Porter Novelli. ``When he
goes out in public, he's like a rock star. He's probably the
best-known businessman in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gates is also often accused of arrogance, and his geeky
demeanor is often described as smarmy rather than charming.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Shaw, a Microsoft spokesman, scoffed at claims that
Microsoft set out to soften Gates's image in advance of the
antitrust suit. The golf club ad, he said, came merely because a
friend at Calloway, which makes the Big Bertha, asked for his help.
Barbara Walters had sought an interview, and its January broadcast
was an accident of timing. Shaw said that anyone looking at other
key Microsoft moments _ like the release of Windows 95 or of
Gates's 1995 book on the future of technology _ would find that the
chairman has often been in the public eye. ``He's done the morning
shows. He's been on Jay Leno. He's been on David Letterman. This
isn't new,'' Shaw said.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft clearly timed one PR effort to coincide with a bit of
public policy. While attending a high-profile Senate hearing on
Microsoft in March, Gates kept a diary for the company's on-line
magazine, Slate. It showed him eating pizza for dinner and catching
part of a James Bond movie on his flight from the West Coast.
``Somehow they are not as good as the ones I saw when I was young,
or maybe it's me that is different,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   And Microsoft was at least considering a sophisticated PR effort
tied to the antitrust case, until the details were leaked last
month to The Los Angeles Times. The proposal reportedly called on
Microsoft to hire local PR firms across the country and solicit
letters to the editor and op-ed pieces from local business leaders,
suggesting a groundswell of support for the company.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw said the plan was merely a proposal from a consultant,
Edelman Public Relations, and that Microsoft decided not to adopt
it.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Microsoft is not alone in thinking about what
message to promote in the antitrust suit. Its nemesis in the
Internet browser wars, Netscape Communications Corp., has hired
former Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork, who has been writing
opinion pieces on antitrust law for major newspapers. Former
Senator Bob Dole has been working for a trade group opposing
Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Even the National Association of Attorneys General has hired
some outside PR help, for the first time ever in a prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   NAAG brought on the PR firm, the Hastings Group, about a year
ago to help arrange its annual meeting and to promote its efforts
in fighting telemarketing fraud. The firm has stayed on to handle
some organizational tasks and help the 20 attorneys general that
filed suit in the Microsoft case. It does not shape the
prosecutors' message or develop ``media strategy,'' said James
Doyle, the NAAG president and attorney general for Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors have their own PR challenge in suing a popular
company like Microsoft. The case not only involves technical
details of the software industry, but its purpose is partly to
prevent future harm to consumers who cannot be identified and
brought before the TV cameras.
</P>
<P>
   ``An antitrust case is not normally a case with a direct
victim,'' said Doyle. ``In a crime case, you see the physical harm
against a person. In a consumer protection case, we have complaints
where people say, `I got ripped off by $100 or $1,000.' But an
antitrust case by its nature is much more abstract.''
</P>
<P>
   The government certainly has a substantial staff and budget for
its case against Microsoft. But the software company has also added
to its arsenal of tools lately, and not just by highlighting its
chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few years ago, the company was barely visible in
Washington, as if the old-world ways of politics had no bearing on
the new digital world. It relied largely on trade groups to carry
the company's message as lawmakers began debating more issues of
importance, such as export rules for encryption software, changes
in copyright law, and policies on Internet access fees and
high-definition television.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft only recently started to hire lobbyists and give
significant donations to politicians, a routine practice for many
other businesses. Now, Microsoft has an established presence in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has given more money to candidates in the 1997-1998
election cycle so far than any other computer company, the
Washington-based Center for Responsive Politics reported last
month. The company's contributions totaled nearly $300,000 as of
May 1.
</P>
<P>
   And it has bolstered its roster of government and public
relations help. The list now includes Michael Deaver, Ronald

 &HT;    Trio charged in blasts at Ohio's Trotwood-Madison High School
 &HT;    By Lou Grieco and Joanne Huist Smith
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Three Trotwood-Madison High School students were
charged with a total of 13 delinquency felony counts after they
built and detonated three pop-bottle bombs at the high school
campus Monday, June 1, Trotwood police said.
</P>
<P>
   The students, two aged 15 and one 16, remain in Montgomery
County Juvenile Detention Center. School Superintendent Samuel C.
Brewer said the students have been suspended and may be expelled.
</P>
<P>
   With school shootings across the country since October _
including those in Springfield, Ore., West Paducah, Ky., Pearl,
Miss., Jonesboro, Ark., and Edinboro, Pa. _ school officials can't
afford to take chances with students and weapons, Brewer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very unfortunate incident,'' Brewer said. ``It was
certainly disturbing. Youngsters need to learn that decisions that
they make can be harmful to themselves or to others.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the second such case in a Miami Valley school since
Friday, when Morrow police discovered a crude explosive device in a
student's bookbag at Little Miami High School. Police said the teen
who made it showed off his handiwork to friends.
</P>
<P>
   In both cases, police said the students had no intent to harm
others. It was more of a ``look what I can do'' scenario, Trotwood
Lt. Fred Beck said.

</P>
<P>
   CONTINUED FROM 1A
</P>
<P>
   In Morrow, ``we and the police believe the student had no intent
to use the device to harm himself, other students or staff,''
Little Miami School Superintendent Michael Verelli II said. ``It
appears to be a case of when you create something you want to show
it off.''
</P>
<P>
   Little Miami school staff heard about the homemade bomb after
three students told them the student held a private ``show and
tell'' for a group of students.
</P>
<P>
   No one was injured and no property damage was reported in either
case. In Trotwood, the students made the devices by combining
household cleaning products into three plastic soda bottles, then
went outside and threw them. One landed on school grounds, two
others on a nearby lawn.
</P>
<P>
   Police Capt. Jim Borland said the chemicals become unstable
after they are mixed and could have exploded in the students'
hands. The acid formed would have burned them, he said.
</P>
<P>
   School officials heard loud ``pops,'' investigated, then sent
the students to the principal's office.
</P>
<P>
   The three students were shocked when police arrived, Borland
said. ``They didn't realize it was going to be such a big deal,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The students were charged with delinquency by reason of
possessing a dangerous ordnance on school grounds and manufacturing
a dangerous ordnance, Borland said.
</P>
<P>
   The three appeared Tuesday in Montgomery County Juvenile Court,
where Judge Nick Kuntz entered denials of responsibility for each
boy. The Montgomery County Prosector's Office has not decided
whether to ask Kuntz to transfer the boys to adult court, said
spokesman Jim Knight.
</P>
<P>
   Two are in the temporary custody of foster parents through
Montgomery County Children Services, Knight said.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami Valley Crime Lab is testing the device found at Little
Miami to determine how dangerous it is, Warren County Prosecutor
Tim Oliver said.
</P>
<P>
   The 16-year-old Morrow student made the device after a friend
called him on a boast that he could make a bomb, Oliver said.
</P>
<P>
   Morrow police took the student into custody Friday. He remains
in the Warren County Juvenile Detention Center, where he will
undergo psychological testing. He was suspended from school and
could be expelled.
</P>
<P>
   In Trotwood, Brewer said he is waiting for a report from the
school principal before deciding whether to expel them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes kids just don't think. You see the apologetic look
on their faces after the fact, but by then it's too late,'' said
Verelli, the Little Miami school superintendant.
</P>
<P>
   Educators across the Miami Valley look forward to the end of a
school year marred by violence and threats of violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to pull out all the stops to show kids it's still
safe to go to school,'' said Robert Bixler, principal of Little
Miami High School. ``Our parents know what's going on. When they
call, we invite them to come in walk down the halls and see that
everything is okay.''
</P>
<P>
   Summer break for Trotwood and Little Miami begins Thursday
afternoon, but school officials are preparing for September
</P>
<P>
   After many school violence incidents around the country, people
later said there were warning signs. Trotwood-Madison
Superintendent Brewer said the district plans to develop a list of
warning signs to help staff determine if a student is headed toward
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``These incidents are like a cry for help and attention,''
Brewer said. ``We as a society have to decide if we value our
children more than guns or weapons.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Fifty years of love
 &HT;    By Vicki Marsh Kabat
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a story Dad loves to tell. He's the gangly country boy,
just back from serving a short spell overseas at the tail end of
World War II. She's the city girl, a majorette for the high school
band in the small town where they both grew up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took one look at her sashaying across that football field
and fell instantly in love,'' Dad recalls with a smile. Then he
regales us with how he had to win her away from a gaggle of
admirers, but with perseverance and no small amount of charm, was
able to do so.
</P>
<P>
   The rest is history. Fifty years of it, actually, a milestone we
will soon celebrate with an open house at their church in the same
small town where they grew up and lived all their lives. My
brother, sister and I, and our families, will return to our
hometown, slice up the three-tiered cake, pour the gold punch, try
desperately to remember the names of our parents' friends we
haven't seen in 20 years, and videotape it all for posterity. We
will do it up as right as we know how, because it's an occasion
worthy of celebration and honor. As the children of this union, we
are exceedingly grateful for it, and for what it has taken to
maintain it.
</P>
<P>
   My mother was one month shy of 18 when they married; my father
was four years older. Nine months later they had their first child.
They lived in a small, wood-frame house with no indoor plumbing and
a coal-oil stove in the kitchen that provided the only heat during
cold Midwestern winters. They hauled water in from town once a
week.
</P>
<P>
   Mom, raised in town, learned how to slop the hogs, feed the
chickens, can food from the garden and heat goose eggs under a lamp
in the kitchen until the goslings hatched. She also learned how to
drive cattle from one pasture to another, roust errant hogs from
the cornfield and separate squealing newborn pigs from their irate,
charging mothers.
</P>
<P>
   None of this could have been easy. At the same time, Dad learned
how to be a man _ in the shadow of his own parents who lived up the
hill and still ran the farm on which the two families now jointly
worked. It was a large shadow Papa cast. They agreed and disagreed,
fumed and fought, but still planted and plowed and harvested crop
after crop, side by side, year after year.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of the hard work, screaming kids and hovering
parents, my folks also had fun. They went dancing on Saturday
nights and to this day can glide around a dance floor with more
grace than my husband and I ever managed. They had card parties
with friends, staying up late into the night, laughing and telling
stories as they played hand after hand. They had barbecues and pig
roasts, inviting the whole neighborhood over, farm folks just like
themselves who came laden with potato salad and cole slaw, creamed
new potatoes and peas, cobblers, pies and homemade ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   They went to church every Sunday and made sure we went with
them. No argument, no discussion. Every Memorial Day, we filled
huge baskets with peonies and irises from our gardens and solemnly
went around to the cemeteries to remember our deceased ancestors.
</P>
<P>
   And my parents loved each other. Every morning began with a
kiss. Dad would slip up behind Mom, who was standing at the stove
before a pan of sizzling bacon, to nuzzle her neck. Waiting in the
car together for Mom to run into a store, Dad would watch her come
toward us and ask for the hundredth time, ``Don't you have a
beautiful mama?'' Yep, I sure do.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty years of watching kids grow up, get in trouble, helping
them out of trouble, seeing them wed and helping out with
grandbabies' births. Fifty years of illnesses, both mild and
frightening. Fifty years of stoking the same home's oil furnace,
washing the same windows every spring, putting up the same storm
windows every fall. Fifty years of planting petunias and
snapdragons in the backyard flower bed and watching for the
hummingbirds each summer.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Dad loves to tell the story of how he met and fell in love
with Mom. And, 50 years later, we still love to hear it.
</P>

 &HT;    Is the Gipper getting gypped?
 &HT;    By Charles Elmore
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ A new state law now in effect says Florida's
Turnpike shall be designated Ronald Reagan Turnpike. But the bill's
sponsors and turnpike officials are not interpreting it as a true
name change, and are not revising any maps, stationery or existing
signs.
</P>
<P>
   Reagan will be honored with 10 new signs of unspecified size and
content, placed every 75 miles, at a cost of $2,500.
</P>
<P>
   The result has been confusion not only among the general public
but also among those who pushed to honor the Republican
ex-president.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was my idea,'' said Jim McConnell, a self-described
conservative activist in Gainesville. ``I lit the fuse. I thought
it was renamed . . . now it looks like we may have to go back next
year and get it straightened out.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Kamburowski, executive director of the Ronald Reagan
Legacy Project in Washington, D.C., said he also thought
``designated'' meant a name change.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was more concrete than that,'' Kamburowski said.
Designated is the same word used in legislation that changes the
name of Washington's National Airport to include Reagan's name,
Kamburowski noted.
</P>
<P>
   The bill's sponsor, House Majority Leader Jim King,
R-Jacksonville, acknowledged, ``Sure, the Ronald Reagan fan clubs
say, `Why don't we spend $9 million to change all the signs?' ''
</P>
<P>
   But that was not necessary to honor Reagan, King said. Both
names will be correct, though he added, ``I think people will
continue to refer to it as Florida's Turnpike.''
</P>
<P>
   McConnell said, ``Some people say it honors the spirit of Ronald
Reagan because it's frugal. I was hoping for a little bit more than
that.''

(Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  
 (For use by clients of the New York Times News Service) 
Microsoft Gives Gateway Some Freedom 
By David Einstein c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  Backing down just
a bit in the face of a landmark antitrust suit, Microsoft yesterday
allowed a major computer maker some limited freedom in customizing
its Windows operating system.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The software juggernaut agreed to let Gateway include an option
on the Windows 98 startup screen that will take new customers
directly to Gateway's own Internet access service, rather than to
Microsoft's Internet setup feature.
</P>
<P>
   Gateway, the nation's fourth-largest personal computer maker,
also will give users the choice of setting Netscape's Navigator
rather than Microsoft's Internet Explorer as their default Web
browser.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, these two changes will make it easier to choose
Internet services other than Microsoft's. They won't affect the
basic look of the Windows desktop.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's decision to bundle its browser with Windows 98
(which goes on sale next week), and its unwillingness to let PC
makers alter the software, were key issues leading to antitrust
suits filed by the U.S. Department of Justice and a group of 20
state attorneys general. The suits, which have been combined into
one, charge Microsoft with using its control of the PC operating
system to crush competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday's move was seen as a show of flexibility by Microsoft
intended to strengthen its defense in the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a fairly good pre-emptive strike against the
Department of Justice,'' said analyst Mary Ryan of Ragen MacKenzie
in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal called it a step
in the right direction that could signal a trend. ``But really
nobody can say at this point it is the beginning of a different
kind of practice on the part of Microsoft.''
</P>
<P>
   PC makers have sought greater leeway in customizing Windows as a
way to differentiate themselves in an era when different brands of
computers are almost identical.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the very least this will let them change the initial user
screen to better reflect what they want to present, as opposed to
what Microsoft has told them they have to present,'' said analyst
Rob Enderle of Giga Information Group.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Waitt, chief executive of Gateway, which is based in North
Sioux City, S.D., said his company has been negotiating with
Microsoft for some time to get more leeway in customizing Windows.
He also said he'd like even more freedom.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to offer our customers the flexibility and
customization that they want,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   By easing up on its licensing agreement with Gateway, Microsoft
opened the door for other companies to demand similar freedom. But
most big PC makers may still be wary of making demands on
Microsoft, which provides the operating system for nearly every new
PC.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq, the nation's top PC maker, said it had no plans to
replace Microsoft's browser with Netscape's on its PCs. And Dell,
the No. 2 company, said it does not intend to change the look of
the Windows desktop.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has consistently claimed that it gives PC makers a
wide berth in modifying the Windows experience, letting them
pre-install any software they like, including the Netscape browser.
</P>
<P>
   But the giant company remains adamant about not wanting PC
makers to change the basic look of Windows.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to allow users to know that when they get this out
of the box they're getting a fully featured Microsoft Windows
operating system,'' said Microsoft spokesman Adam Sohn. ``That's
important because otherwise, you could have Windows computers that
cause serious problems because users won't know they've got
everything they need.''

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  
 UNDATED: advise selling. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One skeptic is Larry Woods, an independent technology analyst in
Stony Creek, Ontario, and author of The Tech Review newsletter. He
said: ``Investors are paying more for less and less profitability
at Intel. The stock holds up because Wall Street analysts say that
everything will be sweet in the second half. I say nonsense.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts are notoriously upbeat, of course. And their optimism
grows even rosier the further out their estimates go. For example,
according to First Call, the consensus estimate for Intel's first
quarter among analysts following the company back in July 1997 was
$1.13 a share. Six months later, when the new year rolled in, the
consensus had fallen to 93 cents a share. The actual number Intel
reported for the quarter: 81 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   What most Wall Street analysts don't want to talk about is how
much Intel's world has changed. Gone are the days when Intel had
virtually no competition. Today, Advanced Micro Devices Inc. is
producing an impressive chip called the K-6 that in many
measurements matches the speed of Intel's Pentiums at a price 25
percent less. And National Semiconductor's Cyrix chips _ the
higher-priced Media GX and lower-priced MIIs _ are winning
converts.
</P>
<P>
   Computer manufacturers that once put only Intel chips inside
their boxes are moving to other suppliers. Compaq Computer, the
world's largest computer maker, and IBM, the No. 2, are using
Advanced Micro Devices chips as well as those from Cyrix. IBM is
making its own chips and chips for Advanced Micro to compete with
Intel, too. And last week, Packard Bell-NEC, the world's
fifth-largest PC producer, announced that it was ending its
exclusive use of Intel chips in its machines. Its new supplier:
National Semiconductor's Cyrix, at much lower prices.
</P>
<P>
   Increased competition isn't Intel's only problem. The company,
which got the majority of its revenues from Pentium and related
board products last year, is selling into a computer market that is
becoming saturated. In spite of PC price cuts in the neighborhood
of 50 percent, the portion of U.S. households owning computers has
inched up only 3 percentage points over the past year-and- a-half
to 43 percent.
</P>
<P>
   According to PC Data Inc., a research company that tracks the
industry, PC sales in April were up only 6 percent from a year
earlier, way down from the double-digit increases that computer
makers have grown accustomed to in recent years. The slowdown
appears to be worsening: compared with March 1998, unit sales were
down 31 percent in April and revenues fell 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Those computers that do sell go for bargain-basement prices, not
a positive factor for manufacturers' margins. The average selling
price of a PC at retail is now about $1,000, down from the $2,200
average for the past few years. Even Dell Computer, the industry's
stellar performer, saw its average sales price for a PC drop 9
percent in the most recent quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The computer industry was counting on sales overseas to pick up
some of the slack from falling demand in the United States. But the
economic turmoil and currency woes in Asia, particularly Japan,
mean computer purchases are no longer a priority for consumers
there.
</P>
<P>
   One relatively new approach for Intel is to focus on the low-end
chip market with its two-month-old Celeron chip designed for use in
under-$1,000 PCs. But users report the chip is slower than the
competition's, and it is not doing well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Intel has to protect its margins to protect its stock price,''
said Fred Hickey, technology analyst and author of the High-Tech
Strategist newsletter. But this may no longer be possible. Although
Intel will not divulge its average selling price per chip, an
industry source estimates it at $200. Advanced Micro Devices has
said it can make money with an average selling price of $100 a
chip.
</P>
<P>
   Even more ominous to some Intel watchers is how many insiders
are exiting the stock. ``For years, Intel insiders were reluctant
to part with their stock,'' said Bob Gabele, who follows insider
transactions at CDA Investnet in Rockville, Md. ``Now, the
inclination of Intel insiders to sell increasing numbers of shares
into weakening share prices is troubling.''
</P>
<P>
   From July through early October 1997, Intel executives sold less
than 150,000 shares. When the shares started to tumble in October,
insiders sold almost 700,000 shares at prices of $80.86 to $85.44.
In January 1998, Intel executives sold 916,000 more shares at $75
to $82.50 each. Three months later, six insiders announced plans to
sell 800,000 shares at prices of $74 to $84.
</P>
<P>
   ``The increased selling seen at Intel is not reflected across
the semiconductor industry,'' Gabele said.

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A on the news
 &HT;    By Colin Bessonette
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail
him at q&AMP;a(at)ajc.com
</P>
<P>
   Q: I see that the decade-long renovation of Egypt's Sphinx has
just been completed. That reminds me of something I've heard over
the years, that the Italians used the Sphinx for artillery target
practice when they occupied Egypt. Is that so?
</P>
<P>
   A: Don't blame the Italians. In fact, the idea that it was used
by anyone for target practice probably is off base. Although locals
who guide tourists around the site for tips often tell them that
Napoleon's men used the Sphinx for target practice, it seems
unlikely. Napoleon's party was the first from the modern West to
catalog and praise the Egyptian antiquities, so the idea that they
then would harm something so significant is remote.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the ailments of the Sphinx appear to have stemmed from
the very rock it is made of: soft, relatively porous limestone,
hardly fit to stand eons of wind, sand, heat, water, pollution and
time.The Napoleon legend makes sense only because it's a good story
in the spirit of anti-colonialism. Absent logic and proof, however,
it's not believable.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When were the first TV commercials aired, and what were the
companies?
</P>
<P>
   A: The year was 1945. The first advertisers included Lever
Bros., Bulova Watch, Botany Worsted Mills, Pan American World
Airways, Firestone Tire &AMP; Rubber, RCA Victor, Gillette Safety
Razor, Esso gasolines, U.S. Rubber, and R.H. Macy &AMP; Co. The ads
were aired in New York on WCBW, WNBC and WABD.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Assuming an all-out nuclear attack with all available nuclear
weapons, what impact would a nuclear war between India and Pakistan
have on the Earth's environment?
</P>
<P>
   A: The effects of what would be the world's first nuclear
exchange are difficult to predict because so many variables remain
unclear. Neither country has said how many weapons it has or
intends to stockpile, or been open about the destructive power
(``yield'') of its weapons. Paul Beaver, spokesman in London for
defense publisher Jane's Information Group, said Pakistan and India
each are believed to have 12 to 18 nuclear weapons packing yields
equivalent to about 20 kilotons of TNT. That's the size of the
atomic bomb that the United States dropped on Hiroshima, Japan, on
Aug. 6, 1945. The U.S. bomb dropped on Nagasaki three days later
was more powerful.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than assuming both countries would unleash all their
weapons, consider what would happen if each attacked the other's
capital with one bomb. Nuclear experts say most of the death and
destruction would be within a half-mile radius of ground zero. Much
of the fallout would push into the stratosphere if even one bomb
exploded in the air; more fallout obviously would occur if there
were more than one explosion. People for miles around would be
threatened with radiation sickness and death, and the fallout
likely would spread worldwide through the air and water. Prevailing
winds, rain and other factors would figure into where the fallout
would go.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, the full effects of the radiation from World War II
atomic bombs exploded over Japan, and from the 1986 Chernobyl
(Ukraine, then part of the Soviet Union) nuclear reactor disaster,
which would include birth defects, aren't fully understood. So the
environment isn't the only concern outside Pakistan and India.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the Military District of Washington? I heard it
referred to after the Memorial Day concert in Washington on PBS,
and then saw it mentioned again in a Q&AMP;A item about the Tomb of the
Unknowns.
</P>
<P>
   A: The full name is U.S. Army Military District of Washington.
In 1941, about five months after the start of World War II, the War
Department created MDW to plan for a ground defense of the nation's
capital. During the WW II era, MDW gradually was reorganized as a
service and support command, with responsibility for servicing the
newly built Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, MDW has gained, lost and regained various
installations and support responsibilities.Today it's an Army
command with a three-fold mission: to respond to crisis, disaster
or security requirements in the National Capital Region; to operate
Arlington National Cemetery and provide base operations for Army
and Defense Department organizations throughout the National
Capital Region; and to conduct official ceremonies, in Washington
and worldwide, on behalf of the nation's civilian and military
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   MDW is the home of the Army's official ceremonial unit, the 3rd
U.S. Infantry (The Old Guard); and the U.S. Army Band, ``Pershing's
Own,'' units that represent the Army and the nation thousands of
times each year.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's the difference between DUI and DWI? An article about
Wal-Mart heiress Alice Walton said she was convicted of DWI.
</P>
<P>
   A: Different states use different terms, but by either DUI
(driving under the influence) or DWI (driving while impaired or
driving while intoxicated), it's the same thing: driving drunk or
under the influence of drugs. Walton was found guilty Friday of
driving while intoxicated, refusing to take a blood-alcohol test at
the request of police, driving without a seat belt, and failing to
properly maintain control of her vehicle after a single-vehicle
accident in January near her Arkansas home. She will be sentenced
in July.

   Q: I remember reading some months ago that the Fuller Brush Co.,
of Fuller Brush Man fame, still exists. I had assumed that with
changing technology and lifestyles, it was long gone. Do you have
any information, and where can I order products?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Fuller Brush Co. is still a booming business. Although
distributors nationwide still may call on customers occasionally,
the legendary ``brush man'' calling door-to-door is little more
than a memory, said company spokesman Larry Gray. These days, many
customers choose to order products by mail or electronic order, or
by phone to a toll-free number, he said. The company manufactures
more than 2,000 items, such as household cleaning aids, polishes
and wax products, cotton and synthetic mops, floor brushs and
brooms, hair care aids, lotions and fragrances, even silk-screen
graphics, at its plant in Great Bend, Kan. Information:

   Q: Over the past few years, Dean Johnson, host of ``Hometime''
on public television, has had three women who have helped him
build, and all seemed to be his wives. What's the story on these
women? What is Johnson's background?
</P>
<P>
   A: Johnson is married, but not to any of the women _ there have
been four, not three _ with whom he has co-hosted ``Hometime.''
There's reason for your confusion, though. The program makes it
appear as though Johnson and his co-hosts are married ``so we can
introduce situations that might realistically occur with a
husband-wife team,'' as the program's publicity material states.
</P>
<P>
   Peggy Knapp, the first co-host, started in 1986, but left after
the first season. Since then, she been hosting ``Newton's Apple,''
a public TV children's program. JoAnne Liebeler, the second
co-host, stayed with ``Hometime'' for four seasons, after which she
moved to the West Coast to pursue other acting opportunities.
Susanne Egli, who joined the show for one season, has since been
acting in regional theater and appearing in commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Current co-host Robin Hartl joined ``Hometime'' in July 1992.
She received a real estate license and spent two years selling real
estate in Eau Claire, Wis., before moving to Minneapolis, where she
worked in the commercial insurance business for eight years while
renovating homes in her off-time.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was an accountant, sales representative and residential
contractor before launching ``Hometime'' in 1984. He and his real
wife, Kathi, have two children.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How can someone from Jamaica participate in the National
Spelling Bee? Isn't it restricted to students of the United States
and its territories?
</P>
<P>
   A: The competition, sponsored by Scripps Howard Newspapers, has
only these restrictions: contestants must speak English and be
younger than 16, and cannot have passed beyond the eighth grade at
the time of their school finals. All have qualified by competing in
previous spelling bees sponsored by their local newspapers. The 249
contestants this year represented 49 states (no Vermont entry),
several U.S. territories, Mexico, the Bahamas and Jamaica.
</P>
<P>
   This year's winner was Jody-Anne Maxwell, 12, a seventh-grader
at Ardenne High School in Kingston, Jamaica. The only previous
winner from beyond the mainland United States was Hugh Tosteson of
Puerto Rico, who won in 1975. In light of Jody-Anne's victory and
the foreign participants this year, Scripps Howard officials said
they would consider renaming the 71-year-old contest, substituting
the world international for national.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I saw a newspaper photo showing a U.S. Army infantry veteran
wearing a Combat Infantryman Badge. The caption said he was a
veteran of Desert Storm. I thought the badge was given only to
those who had been in combat for at least three months, or had been
awarded a Purple Heart. Can you clarify?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Combat Infantry Badge is awarded to infantrymen who have
been under enemy fire in a combat zone, with no minimum time limit
specified, according to the Dictionary of the Modern U.S. Military.
The only restriction stated is that generals and
support/administrative personnel usually are ineligible to receive
it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I know a lot of people who use the product Ripped Fuel to
boost energy. I heard something on the news about a danger
associated with it, but I didn't get the details. Do you have any
information?
</P>
<P>
   A: You probably heard about concerns expressed by the Food and
Drug Administration relating to scores of herbal products and
supplements. Government and other experts have warned that a number
of such products can be risky. They have said that the pills,
tonics and teas are sold with little information for consumers to
judge whether they actually work or might have potential side
effects. The culprit named in Ripped Fuel is ephedra, also called
ma huang, epitonin and sida cordifolia. It contains stimulants
known chemically as ephedrine. Several months ago, the FDA reported
having 900 reports of side effects, including heart palpitations
and psychosis, heart attacks and strokes. Several states have
banned ephedrine-containing supplements. Federal limitations are
pending.

<P>
   Q: I saw that Tony Bennett sang ``Ave Maria'' at Frank Sinatra's
funeral. Knowing that Sinatra was an admirer of President John F.
Kennedy, I wonder if Sinatra sang ``Ave Maria'' at Kennedy's
funeral? If not, who did?
</P>
<P>
   A: It was Luigi Vena who sang Gounod's ``Ave Maria'' at
Kennedy's funeral service Nov. 25, 1963, at Washington's St.
Matthew's Roman Catholic Cathedral. Jacqueline Kennedy had
specifically requested him to do so. Vena had sung the same music
when she and Kennedy married at Newport, R.I., on Sept. 12, 1953.
Another vital participant at both ceremonies was Cardinal Richard
Cushing of Boston. He officiated at the wedding and sang the
requiem mass at the funeral.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Have the Atlanta Braves ever had a black announcer?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. Billy Sample, an outfielder for the Braves in 1986,
announced for the team for two years, 1988 and 1989, said Braves
publicist Glen Serra. Over the years after that, Sample held jobs
announcing for ESPN, the California Angels and the New York
Yankees. No longer in the broadcast booth, he now evaluates umpires
for the National League.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Some time ago, I heard about a doctor who grows Carolina Gold
rice, donating the crop to a church to sell. Can you tell me about
this venture, and where I might purchase some?
</P>
<P>
   A: You're referring to South Carolina ophthalmologist Richard R.
Schulze who, in an attempt to attract ducks, planted his first rice
seeds in 1979 on his 400-acre Turnbridge Plantation on the South
Carolina side of the Savannah River. Schulze and his wife switched
to Carolina Gold, the original variety grown in the state's Old
South heyday, after discovering a source for the seed in Texas.
Carolina Gold is the variety that European nobility prized for its
sweet, nutty taste and whiter-than-white color after it was washed.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Schulze family couldn't consume all the rice they
produced, they have, over the years, given generous amounts to
patients and friends. Even so, they still had a surplus, so Schulze
first donated it to the Savannah Association for the Blind to sell
as a fund-raiser. Now he donates it _ for the same fund-raising
purpose _ to the Episcopal Church of the Holy Trinity in Ridgeland,
S.C.
</P>
<P>
   The church still has a small supply of the Carolina Gold from
last December's harvest, a spokeswoman said Thursday. You can order
it by sending a check to Church of the Holy Trinity, Rt. 3, Box
260, Ridgeland, S.C. 29936. The cost is $10 for a 1 1/2-pound bag,
plus $1.50 for shipping. Once it is sold out, the next crop will be
available for shipping next December, the spokeswoman said.
Information: 803-726-3743.

<P>
   UNDATED: Carolina Gold rice . . .
</P>
<P>
   Q: Isn't there some law restricting the minutes of advertising a
network can show during TV programs? If not, there should be,
because advertisers are exceeding what we should have to endure.
</P>
<P>
   A: There's no law, but you're correct if you think you're
watching more commercials than ever. As reported previously, TV
Guide says a study by the American Association of Advertising
Agencies and the Association of National Advertisers found that the
amount of ads and network promos in prime time has increased 33
percent in the past nine years. The biggest culprit is ABC, which
has gone from 7 minutes and 22 seconds per hour to 9 minutes and 30
seconds per hour.
</P>
<P>
   Your options: when commercials interrupt your program, hit the
mute button on your remote, leave the room, or turn off the TV.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When I was growing up, I always heard the American soldiers'
final resting place and memorial at Arlington National Cemetery
referred to as the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. Now it seems to be
known as Tomb of the Unknowns. Why the change? When was the tomb
built?
</P>
<P>
   A: Originally, there was one unknown from one war. On March 4,
1921, Congress approved the burial of an unidentified American
soldier from World War I in the plaza of the new Memorial
Amphitheater. The tomb sarcophagus was placed above the grave of
the Unknown Soldier of World War I.
</P>
<P>
   The first Tomb of the Unknown Soldier was slightly smaller than
the present base. It was torn away when the present tomb was
started Aug. 27, 1931. The tomb was completed, and the area opened
to the public, April 9, 1932. West of the World War I Unknown are
the crypts of unknowns from World War II and Korea (whose
internments took place in 1958) and Vietnam (1984).
</P>
<P>
   The white marble sarcophagus has never been officially named,
according to the Military District of Washington, which oversees
Arlington. So it's referred to both ways: ``Unknowns'' and
``Unknown Soldier.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Since the Tomb of the Unknowns is so much in the news lately,
I'm curious: How many bodies, representing what wars, are entombed
there?
</P>
<P>
   A: One each from World War I, World War II, the Korean War and
the Vietnam War (the latter exhumed in May for an attempt at
identification).
</P>
<P>
   Q: A recent newspaper item listing U.S. deaths in major wars
omitted the Spanish-American War. This is the 100th anniversary,
and Teddy Roosevelt would be very put out. So what was the total
number of American dead in that war?
</P>
<P>
   A: The word ``major'' probably is the key here. The Defense
Department lists 385 battle deaths and 2,061 other fatalities in
that war, which took place from April to August 1898. Hopefully
none of the participants, including the Rough Riders under Lt. Col.
Theodore Roosevelt, would have felt insulted.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A recent Q&AMP;A item said the Vietnam War began in 1957. Didn't
it actually start in 1962?
</P>
<P>
   A: The item you saw was referring to American casualties in a
number of wars. U.S. civilian and military advisers began helping
the South Vietnamese in the '50s. The year 1957 was when Americans
first started taking casualties in a long, ongoing war in Vietnam,
picking up where the French left off in their war with the Viet
Minh (1946-54). In early 1965, the United States began sending
ground combat troops to Vietnam and began bombing North Vietnam.
Since the Vietnam War never officially was declared by the United
States, there's no one single starting date you can point to.

<P>
   UNDATED: Start-date of the Vietnam war?
</P>
<P>
   Q: After reading about the Supreme Court's decision that Ellis
Island belongs to New Jersey and not New York, I looked at a map
and noticed that the Statue of Liberty appears to be at least a
half-mile inside New Jersey. Has New Jersey ever made a claim to
Miss Liberty also?
</P>
<P>
   A: No claim is necessary. There's no disputing that Liberty
Island and the Statue of Liberty are in New Jersey waters outside
New York harbor. But most people _ and guidebooks _ include them as
attractions of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What are the dates for next year's Chelsea Flower Show in
England? Where can I get information about tickets and travel
packages?
</P>
<P>
   A: Dates for 1999: May 25-28. The show is restricted to members
of the Royal Horticultural Society the first three days, and is
open to the public only on the last day, said Gillian Cooper of the
British Consulate. So she recommends joining the society for a
modest fee, which allows you to attend any of the days. For
information about joining, and a membership application, write:
Shows Department, Royal Horticultural Society, Vincent Square,
London SW1P 2PE, England. Information: 011-44-171-834-4333.
</P>
<P>
   The British Tourist Authority in New York says several tour
operators routinely offer travel packages that include tickets to
the show, if you don't want to join the horticultural society.
Information can be obtained from travel agents. For general tourism
information on Britain, including the Chelsea Flower Show, call
1-800-462-2748 or, on the Internet, check this address:
www//visitbritain.com
</P>
<P>
   Q: Other than the United Kingdom and Japan, in what countries do
people drive on the left side of the road?
</P>
<P>
   A: The American Automobile Association reports the following
worldwide: Antigua, Australia, Bahamas, Barbados, Bermuda, Bhutan,
Botswana, Brunei, Cayman Islands, Channel Islands, Cyprus,
Dominica, Fiji, Grenada, Guyana, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia,
Ireland, Jamaica, Kenya, Lesotho, Macao, Malawi, Malaysia, Malta,
Mauritius, Montserrat, Mozambique, Namibia, Nepal, New Zealand,
Pakistan, Papua-New Guinea, Peninsular Malaysia, Seychelles,
Singapore, South Africa, Sri Lanka, St. Christopher, Nevis &AMP;
Anguilla, St. Lucia, St. Vincent, Surinam, Swaziland, Tanzania,
Thailand, Trinidad &AMP; Tobago, Uganda, the Virgin Islands, Zambia and
Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is the new artificial sweetener sucralose available in
stores?
</P>
<P>
   A: You may have to wait awhile for the no-calorie sweetener,
which recently was approved by the Food and Drug Administration, to
become available. McNeil Specialty Products, a division of Johnson
&AMP; Johnson, which will market sucralose, says the product will be
rolled out over the next two years. It will be available as a table
sweetener, and will be added to processed foods. It has been
approved for use in beverages, dairy products, desserts, chewing
gum, puddings, jams and jellies, and sauces and syrups, among other
products. Information: 1-800-777-5363 or, on the Internet:
www.sucralose.com
</P>
<P>
   Q: NBC has canceled ``Union Square,'' but a recent article
listed it as the seventh-highest-rated program in the Nielsen
ratings for the season. Why was it canceled?
</P>
<P>
   A: The NBC sitcom ``Union Square'' played between ``Friends''
and ``Seinfeld,'' thus seeming to guarantee it a huge potential
audience. But it regularly lost a lot of ``Friends'' viewers, which
is a bad sign. Also, it generated no positive word of mouth and was
considered a creative disappointment by the network. So out it
went.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I once read about a particular type of berry British pilots
ate during World War II to improve their night vision during night
flying missions . Do you know anything about it?
</P>
<P>
   A: You're referring to bilberry (Vaccinium myrtiullus) which, on
the basis of folk beliefs, was consumed in the form of jam by Royal
Air Force pilots before flying off into the night. They had
discovered, as you say, that bilberry improved their night vision
by helping the eyes adjust from light to darkness. After the war,
scientists investigated the claim and confirmed that the berries
and bilberry extract contained compounds known as anthocyanosides
that help maintain visual sensitivity. Subsequent clinical trials
confirmed that bilberry extract improves night vision in air
traffic controllers, pilots and automobile drivers, and also
reduces eye strain and fatigue.
</P>
<P>
   Another antioxidant that has been demonstrated to improve
circulation to the eyes, with a possible benefit to eyesight, is
ginkgo biloba. Other herbs and nutrients that may help vision
include lycopene (in tomatoes), grape seed extract and vitamins C
and E.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I vaguely recall a kidnapping case involving Frank Sinatra.
Will you refresh my memory?
</P>
<P>
   A: On Dec. 8, 1963, Frank Sinatra Jr., 19, was abducted from
Harrah's Casino at Lake Tahoe, Calif. He was released unharmed Dec.
11 after the elder Sinatra paid $240,000 in ransom. The FBI
announced Dec. 14 that it had arrested three men _ one of them
being the accused mastermind, Barry Keenan, a stock market player
who had become addicted to drugs and alcohol _ and had recovered
most of the ransom money. The defense team later argued that Frank
Jr. dreamed up the kidnapping as a publicity stunt to jump-start
his career; it also was rumored that the Mafia was involved. On
March 7, 1964, a federal court convicted the three and sentenced
them all to prison.
</P>
<P>
   It was reported in January that Columbia Pictures had snagged
the rights to ``Snatching Sinatra,'' an article recounting the
episode, with plans to make a movie about it.

<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail

<P>
   Q: I see that the decade-long renovation of Egypt's Sphinx has
just been completed. That reminds me of something I've heard over
the years, that the Italians used the Sphinx for artillery target
practice when they occupied Egypt. Is that so?
</P>
<P>
   A: Don't blame the Italians. In fact, the idea that it was used
by anyone for target practice probably is off base. Although locals
who guide tourists around the site for tips often tell them that
Napoleon's men used the Sphinx for target practice, it seems
unlikely. Napoleon's party was the first from the modern West to
catalog and praise the Egyptian antiquities, so the idea that they
then would harm something so significant is remote.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the ailments of the Sphinx appear to have stemmed from
the very rock it is made of: soft, relatively porous limestone,
hardly fit to stand eons of wind, sand, heat, water, pollution and
time.The Napoleon legend makes sense only because it's a good story
in the spirit of anti-colonialism. Absent logic and proof, however,
it's not believable.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When were the first TV commercials aired, and what were the
companies?
</P>
<P>
   A: The year was 1945. The first advertisers included Lever
Bros., Bulova Watch, Botany Worsted Mills, Pan American World
Airways, Firestone Tire &AMP; Rubber, RCA Victor, Gillette Safety
Razor, Esso gasolines, U.S. Rubber, and R.H. Macy &AMP; Co. The ads
were aired in New York on WCBW, WNBC and WABD.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Assuming an all-out nuclear attack with all available nuclear
weapons, what impact would a nuclear war between India and Pakistan
have on the Earth's environment?
</P>
<P>
   A: The effects of what would be the world's first nuclear
exchange are difficult to predict because so many variables remain
unclear. Neither country has said how many weapons it has or
intends to stockpile, or been open about the destructive power
(``yield'') of its weapons. Paul Beaver, spokesman in London for
defense publisher Jane's Information Group, said Pakistan and India
each are believed to have 12 to 18 nuclear weapons packing yields
equivalent to about 20 kilotons of TNT. That's the size of the
atomic bomb that the United States dropped on Hiroshima, Japan, on
Aug. 6, 1945. The U.S. bomb dropped on Nagasaki three days later
was more powerful.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than assuming both countries would unleash all their
weapons, consider what would happen if each attacked the other's
capital with one bomb. Nuclear experts say most of the death and
destruction would be within a half-mile radius of ground zero. Much
of the fallout would push into the stratosphere if even one bomb
exploded in the air; more fallout obviously would occur if there
were more than one explosion. People for miles around would be
threatened with radiation sickness and death, and the fallout
likely would spread worldwide through the air and water. Prevailing
winds, rain and other factors would figure into where the fallout
would go.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, the full effects of the radiation from World War II
atomic bombs exploded over Japan, and from the 1986 Chernobyl
(Ukraine, then part of the Soviet Union) nuclear reactor disaster,
which would include birth defects, aren't fully understood. So the
environment isn't the only concern outside Pakistan and India.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the Military District of Washington? I heard it
referred to after the Memorial Day concert in Washington on PBS,
and then saw it mentioned again in a Q&AMP;A item about the Tomb of the
Unknowns.
</P>
<P>
   A: The full name is U.S. Army Military District of Washington.
In 1941, about five months after the start of World War II, the War
Department created MDW to plan for a ground defense of the nation's
capital. During the WW II era, MDW gradually was reorganized as a
service and support command, with responsibility for servicing the
newly built Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, MDW has gained, lost and regained various
installations and support responsibilities.Today it's an Army
command with a three-fold mission: to respond to crisis, disaster
or security requirements in the National Capital Region; to operate
Arlington National Cemetery and provide base operations for Army
and Defense Department organizations throughout the National
Capital Region; and to conduct official ceremonies, in Washington
and worldwide, on behalf of the nation's civilian and military
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   MDW is the home of the Army's official ceremonial unit, the 3rd
U.S. Infantry (The Old Guard); and the U.S. Army Band, ``Pershing's
Own,'' units that represent the Army and the nation thousands of
times each year.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's the difference between DUI and DWI? An article about
Wal-Mart heiress Alice Walton said she was convicted of DWI.
</P>
<P>
   A: Different states use different terms, but by either DUI
(driving under the influence) or DWI (driving while impaired or
driving while intoxicated), it's the same thing: driving drunk or
under the influence of drugs. Walton was found guilty Friday of
driving while intoxicated, refusing to take a blood-alcohol test at
the request of police, driving without a seat belt, and failing to
properly maintain control of her vehicle after a single-vehicle
accident in January near her Arkansas home. She will be sentenced
in July.

   Q: I remember reading some months ago that the Fuller Brush Co.,
of Fuller Brush Man fame, still exists. I had assumed that with
changing technology and lifestyles, it was long gone. Do you have
any information, and where can I order products?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Fuller Brush Co. is still a booming business. Although
distributors nationwide still may call on customers occasionally,
the legendary ``brush man'' calling door-to-door is little more
than a memory, said company spokesman Larry Gray. These days, many
customers choose to order products by mail or electronic order, or
by phone to a toll-free number, he said. The company manufactures
more than 2,000 items, such as household cleaning aids, polishes
and wax products, cotton and synthetic mops, floor brushs and
brooms, hair care aids, lotions and fragrances, even silk-screen
graphics, at its plant in Great Bend, Kan. Information:

<P>
   Q: Over the past few years, Dean Johnson, host of ``Hometime''
on public television, has had three women who have helped him
build, and all seemed to be his wives. What's the story on these
women? What is Johnson's background?
</P>
<P>
   A: Johnson is married, but not to any of the women _ there have
been four, not three _ with whom he has co-hosted ``Hometime.''
There's reason for your confusion, though. The program makes it
appear as though Johnson and his co-hosts are married ``so we can
introduce situations that might realistically occur with a
husband-wife team,'' as the program's publicity material states.
</P>
<P>
   Peggy Knapp, the first co-host, started in 1986, but left after
the first season. Since then, she been hosting ``Newton's Apple,''
a public TV children's program. JoAnne Liebeler, the second
co-host, stayed with ``Hometime'' for four seasons, after which she
moved to the West Coast to pursue other acting opportunities.
Susanne Egli, who joined the show for one season, has since been
acting in regional theater and appearing in commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Current co-host Robin Hartl joined ``Hometime'' in July 1992.
She received a real estate license and spent two years selling real
estate in Eau Claire, Wis., before moving to Minneapolis, where she
worked in the commercial insurance business for eight years while
renovating homes in her off-time.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was an accountant, sales representative and residential
contractor before launching ``Hometime'' in 1984. He and his real
wife, Kathi, have two children.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How can someone from Jamaica participate in the National
Spelling Bee? Isn't it restricted to students of the United States
and its territories?
</P>
<P>
   A: The competition, sponsored by Scripps Howard Newspapers, has
only these restrictions: contestants must speak English and be
younger than 16, and cannot have passed beyond the eighth grade at
the time of their school finals. All have qualified by competing in
previous spelling bees sponsored by their local newspapers. The 249
contestants this year represented 49 states (no Vermont entry),
several U.S. territories, Mexico, the Bahamas and Jamaica.
</P>
<P>
   This year's winner was Jody-Anne Maxwell, 12, a seventh-grader
at Ardenne High School in Kingston, Jamaica. The only previous
winner from beyond the mainland United States was Hugh Tosteson of
Puerto Rico, who won in 1975. In light of Jody-Anne's victory and
the foreign participants this year, Scripps Howard officials said
they would consider renaming the 71-year-old contest, substituting
the world international for national.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I saw a newspaper photo showing a U.S. Army infantry veteran
wearing a Combat Infantryman Badge. The caption said he was a
veteran of Desert Storm. I thought the badge was given only to
those who had been in combat for at least three months, or had been
awarded a Purple Heart. Can you clarify?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Combat Infantry Badge is awarded to infantrymen who have
been under enemy fire in a combat zone, with no minimum time limit
specified, according to the Dictionary of the Modern U.S. Military.
The only restriction stated is that generals and
support/administrative personnel usually are ineligible to receive
it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I know a lot of people who use the product Ripped Fuel to
boost energy. I heard something on the news about a danger
associated with it, but I didn't get the details. Do you have any
information?
</P>
<P>
   A: You probably heard about concerns expressed by the Food and
Drug Administration relating to scores of herbal products and
supplements. Government and other experts have warned that a number
of such products can be risky. They have said that the pills,
tonics and teas are sold with little information for consumers to
judge whether they actually work or might have potential side
effects. The culprit named in Ripped Fuel is ephedra, also called
ma huang, epitonin and sida cordifolia. It contains stimulants
known chemically as ephedrine. Several months ago, the FDA reported
having 900 reports of side effects, including heart palpitations
and psychosis, heart attacks and strokes. Several states have
banned ephedrine-containing supplements. Federal limitations are
pending.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I saw that Tony Bennett sang ``Ave Maria'' at Frank Sinatra's
funeral. Knowing that Sinatra was an admirer of President John F.
Kennedy, I wonder if Sinatra sang ``Ave Maria'' at Kennedy's
funeral? If not, who did?
</P>
<P>
   A: It was Luigi Vena who sang Gounod's ``Ave Maria'' at
Kennedy's funeral service Nov. 25, 1963, at Washington's St.
Matthew's Roman Catholic Cathedral. Jacqueline Kennedy had
specifically requested him to do so. Vena had sung the same music
when she and Kennedy married at Newport, R.I., on Sept. 12, 1953.
Another vital participant at both ceremonies was Cardinal Richard
Cushing of Boston. He officiated at the wedding and sang the
requiem mass at the funeral.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Have the Atlanta Braves ever had a black announcer?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. Billy Sample, an outfielder for the Braves in 1986,
announced for the team for two years, 1988 and 1989, said Braves
publicist Glen Serra. Over the years after that, Sample held jobs
announcing for ESPN, the California Angels and the New York
Yankees. No longer in the broadcast booth, he now evaluates umpires
for the National League.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Some time ago, I heard about a doctor who grows Carolina Gold
rice, donating the crop to a church to sell. Can you tell me about
this venture, and where I might purchase some?
</P>
<P>
   A: You're referring to South Carolina ophthalmologist Richard R.
Schulze who, in an attempt to attract ducks, planted his first rice
seeds in 1979 on his 400-acre Turnbridge Plantation on the South
Carolina side of the Savannah River. Schulze and his wife switched
to Carolina Gold, the original variety grown in the state's Old
South heyday, after discovering a source for the seed in Texas.
Carolina Gold is the variety that European nobility prized for its
sweet, nutty taste and whiter-than-white color after it was washed.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Schulze family couldn't consume all the rice they
produced, they have, over the years, given generous amounts to
patients and friends. Even so, they still had a surplus, so Schulze
first donated it to the Savannah Association for the Blind to sell
as a fund-raiser. Now he donates it _ for the same fund-raising
purpose _ to the Episcopal Church of the Holy Trinity in Ridgeland,
S.C.
</P>
<P>
   The church still has a small supply of the Carolina Gold from
last December's harvest, a spokeswoman said Thursday. You can order
it by sending a check to Church of the Holy Trinity, Rt. 3, Box
260, Ridgeland, S.C. 29936. The cost is $10 for a 1 1/2-pound bag,
plus $1.50 for shipping. Once it is sold out, the next crop will be
available for shipping next December, the spokeswoman said.
Information: 803-726-3743.

<P>
   UNDATED: Carolina Gold rice . . .
</P>
<P>
   Q: Isn't there some law restricting the minutes of advertising a
network can show during TV programs? If not, there should be,
because advertisers are exceeding what we should have to endure.
</P>
<P>
   A: There's no law, but you're correct if you think you're
watching more commercials than ever. As reported previously, TV
Guide says a study by the American Association of Advertising
Agencies and the Association of National Advertisers found that the
amount of ads and network promos in prime time has increased 33
percent in the past nine years. The biggest culprit is ABC, which
has gone from 7 minutes and 22 seconds per hour to 9 minutes and 30
seconds per hour.
</P>
<P>
   Your options: when commercials interrupt your program, hit the
mute button on your remote, leave the room, or turn off the TV.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When I was growing up, I always heard the American soldiers'
final resting place and memorial at Arlington National Cemetery
referred to as the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. Now it seems to be
known as Tomb of the Unknowns. Why the change? When was the tomb
built?
</P>
<P>
   A: Originally, there was one unknown from one war. On March 4,
1921, Congress approved the burial of an unidentified American
soldier from World War I in the plaza of the new Memorial
Amphitheater. The tomb sarcophagus was placed above the grave of
the Unknown Soldier of World War I.
</P>
<P>
   The first Tomb of the Unknown Soldier was slightly smaller than
the present base. It was torn away when the present tomb was
started Aug. 27, 1931. The tomb was completed, and the area opened
to the public, April 9, 1932. West of the World War I Unknown are
the crypts of unknowns from World War II and Korea (whose
internments took place in 1958) and Vietnam (1984).
</P>
<P>
   The white marble sarcophagus has never been officially named,
according to the Military District of Washington, which oversees
Arlington. So it's referred to both ways: ``Unknowns'' and
``Unknown Soldier.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Since the Tomb of the Unknowns is so much in the news lately,
I'm curious: How many bodies, representing what wars, are entombed
there?
</P>
<P>
   A: One each from World War I, World War II, the Korean War and
the Vietnam War (the latter exhumed in May for an attempt at
identification).
</P>
<P>
   Q: A recent newspaper item listing U.S. deaths in major wars
omitted the Spanish-American War. This is the 100th anniversary,
and Teddy Roosevelt would be very put out. So what was the total
number of American dead in that war?
</P>
<P>
   A: The word ``major'' probably is the key here. The Defense
Department lists 385 battle deaths and 2,061 other fatalities in
that war, which took place from April to August 1898. Hopefully
none of the participants, including the Rough Riders under Lt. Col.
Theodore Roosevelt, would have felt insulted.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A recent Q&AMP;A item said the Vietnam War began in 1957. Didn't
it actually start in 1962?
</P>
<P>
   A: The item you saw was referring to American casualties in a
number of wars. U.S. civilian and military advisers began helping
the South Vietnamese in the '50s. The year 1957 was when Americans
first started taking casualties in a long, ongoing war in Vietnam,
picking up where the French left off in their war with the Viet
Minh (1946-54). In early 1965, the United States began sending
ground combat troops to Vietnam and began bombing North Vietnam.
Since the Vietnam War never officially was declared by the United
States, there's no one single starting date you can point to.

<P>
   UNDATED: Start-date of the Vietnam war?
</P>
<P>
   Q: After reading about the Supreme Court's decision that Ellis
Island belongs to New Jersey and not New York, I looked at a map
and noticed that the Statue of Liberty appears to be at least a
half-mile inside New Jersey. Has New Jersey ever made a claim to
Miss Liberty also?
</P>
<P>
   A: No claim is necessary. There's no disputing that Liberty
Island and the Statue of Liberty are in New Jersey waters outside
New York harbor. But most people _ and guidebooks _ include them as
attractions of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What are the dates for next year's Chelsea Flower Show in
England? Where can I get information about tickets and travel
packages?
</P>
<P>
   A: Dates for 1999: May 25-28. The show is restricted to members
of the Royal Horticultural Society the first three days, and is
open to the public only on the last day, said Gillian Cooper of the
British Consulate. So she recommends joining the society for a
modest fee, which allows you to attend any of the days. For
information about joining, and a membership application, write:
Shows Department, Royal Horticultural Society, Vincent Square,
London SW1P 2PE, England. Information: 011-44-171-834-4333.
</P>
<P>
   The British Tourist Authority in New York says several tour
operators routinely offer travel packages that include tickets to
the show, if you don't want to join the horticultural society.
Information can be obtained from travel agents. For general tourism
information on Britain, including the Chelsea Flower Show, call
1-800-462-2748 or, on the Internet, check this address:

</P>
<P>
   Q: Other than the United Kingdom and Japan, in what countries do
people drive on the left side of the road?
</P>
<P>
   A: The American Automobile Association reports the following
worldwide: Antigua, Australia, Bahamas, Barbados, Bermuda, Bhutan,
Botswana, Brunei, Cayman Islands, Channel Islands, Cyprus,
Dominica, Fiji, Grenada, Guyana, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia,
Ireland, Jamaica, Kenya, Lesotho, Macao, Malawi, Malaysia, Malta,
Mauritius, Montserrat, Mozambique, Namibia, Nepal, New Zealand,
Pakistan, Papua-New Guinea, Peninsular Malaysia, Seychelles,
Singapore, South Africa, Sri Lanka, St. Christopher, Nevis &AMP;
Anguilla, St. Lucia, St. Vincent, Surinam, Swaziland, Tanzania,
Thailand, Trinidad &AMP; Tobago, Uganda, the Virgin Islands, Zambia and
Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is the new artificial sweetener sucralose available in
stores?
</P>
<P>
   A: You may have to wait awhile for the no-calorie sweetener,
which recently was approved by the Food and Drug Administration, to
become available. McNeil Specialty Products, a division of Johnson
&AMP; Johnson, which will market sucralose, says the product will be
rolled out over the next two years. It will be available as a table
sweetener, and will be added to processed foods. It has been
approved for use in beverages, dairy products, desserts, chewing
gum, puddings, jams and jellies, and sauces and syrups, among other
products. Information: 1-800-777-5363 or, on the Internet:
www.sucralose.com
</P>
<P>
   Q: NBC has canceled ``Union Square,'' but a recent article
listed it as the seventh-highest-rated program in the Nielsen
ratings for the season. Why was it canceled?
</P>
<P>
   A: The NBC sitcom ``Union Square'' played between ``Friends''
and ``Seinfeld,'' thus seeming to guarantee it a huge potential
audience. But it regularly lost a lot of ``Friends'' viewers, which
is a bad sign. Also, it generated no positive word of mouth and was
considered a creative disappointment by the network. So out it
went.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I once read about a particular type of berry British pilots
ate during World War II to improve their night vision during night
flying missions . Do you know anything about it?
</P>
<P>
   A: You're referring to bilberry (Vaccinium myrtiullus) which, on
the basis of folk beliefs, was consumed in the form of jam by Royal
Air Force pilots before flying off into the night. They had
discovered, as you say, that bilberry improved their night vision
by helping the eyes adjust from light to darkness. After the war,
scientists investigated the claim and confirmed that the berries
and bilberry extract contained compounds known as anthocyanosides
that help maintain visual sensitivity. Subsequent clinical trials
confirmed that bilberry extract improves night vision in air
traffic controllers, pilots and automobile drivers, and also
reduces eye strain and fatigue.
</P>
<P>
   Another antioxidant that has been demonstrated to improve
circulation to the eyes, with a possible benefit to eyesight, is
ginkgo biloba. Other herbs and nutrients that may help vision
include lycopene (in tomatoes), grape seed extract and vitamins C
and E.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I vaguely recall a kidnapping case involving Frank Sinatra.
Will you refresh my memory?
</P>
<P>
   A: On Dec. 8, 1963, Frank Sinatra Jr., 19, was abducted from
Harrah's Casino at Lake Tahoe, Calif. He was released unharmed Dec.
11 after the elder Sinatra paid $240,000 in ransom. The FBI
announced Dec. 14 that it had arrested three men _ one of them
being the accused mastermind, Barry Keenan, a stock market player
who had become addicted to drugs and alcohol _ and had recovered
most of the ransom money. The defense team later argued that Frank
Jr. dreamed up the kidnapping as a publicity stunt to jump-start
his career; it also was rumored that the Mafia was involved. On
March 7, 1964, a federal court convicted the three and sentenced
them all to prison.
</P>
<P>
   It was reported in January that Columbia Pictures had snagged
the rights to ``Snatching Sinatra,'' an article recounting the
episode, with plans to make a movie about it.

A NMIGHTMARISH DREAM TEAM
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By EILEEN McNAMARA 
c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What, no press conference to denounce the international child
abuse cult for concocting drunken driving charges against their
colleague?
</P>
<P>
   No medical experts to swear that the inability to recite the
alphabet beyond the letter ``N'' is indicative of a ``pre-existing
condition,'' not drunkenness?
</P>
<P>
   No support for claims by the only female member of the Louise
Woodward defense team that their colleague was abused and sexually
harassed by a State Police trooper?
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take Harvey Silverglate, Andrew Good, and Barry Scheck
long to cut Elaine Whitfield Sharp loose, did it?
</P>
<P>
   It's certainly true that the British-born barrister's version of
her predawn arrest by State Trooper Randy Cipoletta on the Lynnway
on May 22 strains credibility. She could not speak clearly; could
not walk a straight line; could not recall the second half of the
alphabet, but Ms. Whitfield Sharp would have us believe that a
trooper with an unblemished record was so overcome by desire that
he offered to drop the charges if she had sex with him.
</P>
<P>
   She insists she never told Trooper Cipoletta that she was
distressed because she now believes her client is guilty of the
murder of 8 1/2-month-old Matthew Eappen, that she never threatened
to sue him, that she never struck the EMT called to transport her
to the hospital after she had staged something of a sit-down strike
on the floor of the State Police barracks in Revere.
</P>
<P>
   The trooper made it all up, Whitfield Sharp claims, in order to
justify arresting her. No, it doesn't ring true to me, either.
Weaving across three lanes of traffic and bumping into guard rails
would seem like probable cause enough to arrest someone for driving
under the influence of alcohol. But I thought incredible defenses
were the specialty of the Sharp-Silverglate-Good-Scheck legal team.
Where are their imaginations?
</P>
<P>
   Wasn't this the crew, after all, that tried to convince a jury
that Louise Woodward put Matthew Eappen down for an afternoon nap
on Feb. 4, 1997, and his skull spontaneously ruptured without any
precipitating action on the part of the British au pair?
</P>
<P>
   That creative defense failed, of course. After deliberating for
27 hours over three days, the jury convicted their client of
second-degree murder last fall, accepting the prosecution's
contention that a frustrated Woodward caused Matthew's injuries by
violently shaking him and slamming his head against a hard surface
in his home in Newton Highlands. He died five days later.
</P>
<P>
   It was only the intervention of Judge Hiller Zobel that saved
the now 20-year-old baby sitter from a mandatory minimum of 15
years in state prison. The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court is
still reviewing Zobel's decision to reduce the jury's verdict to
involuntary manslaughter and credit Woodward with time served, 279
days. A ruling is expected within the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   If the high court finds that Zobel abused his discretion, the
jury's verdict could be reinstated and Woodward could be returned
to Framingham state prison. Those accommodations are a far cry from
Whitfield Sharp's spacious Colonial in Marblehead, where Woodward
lived for months after Zobel set her free last October. She moved
out at the end of March.
</P>
<P>
   Why Louise left is still an open question, but Whitfield Sharp's
former colleagues are not beneath casting aspersions in her
direction. ``Unfortunately, Ms. Sharp has at times exhibited an
aberrant pattern of behavior, as at the time of her arrest,''
Silverglate, Good, and Scheck said in a stunning display of
disloyalty that accompanied their announcement that Whitfield Sharp
had been fired from the Woodward defense team.
</P>
<P>
   If only they had elaborated. What, one can only wonder, is
Harvey Silverglate's idea of ``an aberrant pattern of behavior?''
Could anything Whitfield Sharp has done been more bizarre than the
sight of the wild-eyed Silverglate on national TV accusing some of
the world's best doctors of being part of a ``child abuse cult''
because they testified to their conviction that Louise Woodward
battered Matty Eappen to death?
</P>
<P>
   A fatal case of child abuse has devolved into a game of
competitive defamation among a pack of deranged lawyers.
Silverglate defames the doctors. Whitfield Sharp defames the
trooper. Silverglate, Good, and Scheck defame their colleague. This
is one dream team that deserves the nightmare it has spawned.

Agency is setting off security alarms with plans to post details
about the nation's hazardous chemical sites on the Internet. The
EPA is preparing to collect and make public information about the
``worst-case'' potential disasters for some 66,000 U.S. facilities
that store dangerous chemicals. By Julia Malone.
</P>
<P>
   GATEWAY29-COX (Austin) _ In a move seen as loosening Microsoft
Corp.'s grip on the major computer makers, Gateway Inc. said
recently that it will include competing Internet browsers on
desktop computers with Windows 98. By Jerry Mahoney.
</P>
<P>
   LUCENT-STRIKE-BLOOM (Washington) _ Lucent Technologies Inc. said
it reached agreement with two unions to end a strike against the
telephone-equipment company over health-care costs, job transfers
and subcontractors. By Dawn Hayes.
</P>
<P>
   DIGITAL-SFCHRON (Undated) _ When I ran a typesetting business in
the 1980s, one of my worries was figuring out what technology to
buy to keep pace with the changes in the industry. The best advice
I ever got on that score literally walked in my front door one day,
when a trio of local inventors showed me an interface that plugged
a PC into our typesetting machine. By Tom Abate.
</P>
<P>
   SMALLWEB-SFCHRON (Undated) _ It seemed like a bad omen for small
businesses when Saks Fifth Avenue gave up on electronic commerce
earlier this year. After all, if a sophisticated retailer like Saks
couldn't make money on the Web, how could more modest merchants?
Billy Blue, a San Francisco men's clothier, provides a more
optimistic model for cyber retailers: While its total online sales
have been relatively small, the site has sold more upscale apparel
in the past two months than Saks did in its 18 months on the Web.
By Carol Emert.
</P>
<P>
   SOFTWARE-SFCHRON (Undated) _ Personal computers can't run your
small business for you. But they can make it a heck of a lot
easier. By David Einstein.
</P>
<P>
   YEAR2000-SFCHRON (Undated) _ There's been a lot of fuss lately
about the Year 2000 computer problem and its potentially
devastating effect on big business. But the glitch could easily
trip up small businesses as well _ something most of their
proprietors don't seem to realize. By Arthur M. Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   NETWORK-SFCHRON (Undated) _ Monica Frei, head of a Bay Area
nanny placement service, had all the people skills she needed to
spot a good housekeeper, nanny or personal assistant. But until
recently she was almost too petrified even to touch a computer.
That all changed last year when associates finally convinced her to
install a computer network in the three Bay Area offices of Town
and Country Nannies and Mothers In Deed. By themselves, the firm's
computers weren't any friendlier than before, but networked
together they became too powerful a business tool for Frei to
ignore. By Jonathan marshall.
</P>
<P>
   NETWORKSIDE-SFCHRON (Undated) _ If computers could speak, they'd
beg to be networked whenever two or more inhabit the same office.
By Jonathan Marshall.
</P>
<P>
   TECHTOOLS-COLUMN-COX (Atlanta) _ Family Tree Maker is the giant
of genealogy computer programs, with more than 1 million copies
sold. It is an excellent program, but my wife, Donna, the
genealogist, believes much of its popularity comes from the wealth
of information on the nine CDs that come with the deluxe version.
Her report: By Jack Warner.
</P>
<P>
   TECHREPORT-COX (Undated) _ It's not so much trouble to reach for
the stack of compact discs, pick the one you suddenly have a
hankering for, pop it into the CD player and hit play. But wouldn't
it be nice to just tap the CD player and have that tune start
playing? You can, if you have every single CD you own sitting in
the CD player. By Michael Kannell.
</P>
<P>
   TECHNOBUDDY02-COX (Atlanta) _ It looks like Windows 98 will be
released on Microsoft's original schedule of June 25. My guess is
that the publicity about the company's problems with the Justice
Department will end up hyping sales. By Bill Husted.
</P>
<P>
   MACREPORT-COX (Atlanta) _ Apple Computer faces no greater
challenge than wooing software developers back to the Macintosh. It
is they who will make or break this computer. By Charles Haddad.
</P>
<P>
   CYBERSCENE-COX (Atlanta) _ Your next fishing partner may have a
17-inch screen and a keyboard. Now that regular folks _ people like
you and me _ use computers and the Internet on a daily basis, Web
sites do a much better job of representing the non-technical side
of life. By Bill Husted.
</P>
<P>
   DATA-LAYOFFS-BOS (Undated) _ The price wars that staggered the
computer industry took another swipe at Data General Corp. The
company Monday laid off 400 workers _ 150 in Massachusetts _ and
said it would take a $125 million charge as it abandons the
manufacturing of low-end server computers. By Hiawatha Bray.

   CALIF-ANALYSIS (San Francisco) _ California to millionaire

SULLIVAN.

<P>
   NURSING-SHORTAGE (Houston) _ Hospital recruiters are offering
sign-up bonuses and flying to Canada to recruit applicants.
Analysts say the broader choices in the field are triggering the

   SKIN-CANCER (Albany, N.Y.) _ When he was diagnosed with a form
of skin cancer three years ago, Harry Livingston figured it might
be a death sentence. Livingston, 64, is lucky. His cancer was
detected early, when the chance of survival is as high as 95
percent. The key is early detection. This year, about 7,300
Americans will die from melanoma, which left untreated can spread.

wildflowers _ colorful, fragrant and short-lived. By SYD KEARNEY.

<P>
   WALES (Llangammarch, Wales) _ At a time when much of the world
is acquiescing to Anglo-American cultural hegemony, Wales seems to
be moving in the opposite direction. From the sign that greeted us
as we crossed the River Severn bridge _ ``Croeso I Cymru,''
``Welcome to Wales'' _ to the red-dragon flags, it was obvious that

balmy winter, a vicious January ice storm in New York's North
Country and into Canada, a towering tornado in a rolling community
where none has ever formed before? Is this the product of Global
Warming? El Nino? Who knows? By DAN LYNCH.
</P>
<P>
   NUKE-TESTS (Albany, N.Y.) _ The nuclear tests carried out by the
Indian government of India were in fact a desperate effort to

present right-wing coalition. By PARTHA BANERJEE.

 &HT;    The search for simplicity -- not as easy as it looks
 &HT;    By Emily J. Minor
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A bowl with two peaches.
</P>
<P>
   Eight pebbles in a stone crock.
</P>
<P>
   A bottle of water. A single piece of perfect, perfect pie.
</P>
<P>
   I am reading a simple book, about simple living, called Pure
Style.
</P>
<P>
   You've seen the type. On page after pretty page, they show us
photos of perfect places, where there are no apples, forgotten and
moldy on the kitchen counter.
</P>
<P>
   No homework on the dining room table.
</P>
<P>
   No piles of clothes all over the bed and bedroom floor.
</P>
<P>
   No nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Just a bed made from tree branches. A night stand adorned with
one rose in a spare and linear vase. A glass pitcher with two
floating sprigs of mint. Everything is plain. Everything is simple.
</P>
<P>
   Simple is good.
</P>
<P>
   Simple is everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   But I have just a few _ yes, simple _ questions for the people
who think up these simple thoughts and take these pictures and
write these books and then, quite simply, make a bunch of money:
</P>
<P>
   People? Where do you put all your crap?
</P>
<P>
   OK, I confess. I went looking for them. But in one 10-minute
sprint through the office last week I collected a virtual library
of books outlining how I, a person who wears denim overalls to work
three days out of five, can simplify my life. What a bonanza! And I
didn't even have to take a simple little drive to Barnes &AMP; Noble.
</P>
<P>
   The Simpler Life. Pure Style. Pure Style Outdoors. Simplify Your
Life with Kids. Simplify Family Travel. And, my personal favorite,
Simple Curtains, although there is nothing simple about any of
these curtains, including the zigzag jobbies on Page 58, and I know
this because _ and pardon me if I digress and boast for a moment
here _ I made an actual tea towel in eighth-grade Home Economics.
</P>
<P>
   From Simple Curtains. Step 7: Place the front panel right side
down on top of the lining. Pin and baste the layers together,
taking in the piping. Using a piping foot (a piping foot????),
machine stitch all around the sides and along the zigzag bottom of
the valance. (Enough. Enough. If this was really a book on simple
curtains wouldn't it just say, ``Order all curtains with your
credit card from Pottery Barn?'')
</P>
<P>
   But I can't help sighing when I see this stuff. Beautiful stuff.
Quiet little corners with soft cushions and glasses of iced tea.
Simple stuff where even the yard tools are precious. An old rake. A
traditional pitchfork. A shovel with a heavy wooden handle, the
likes of which would probably be worth $100 at an antique fair
because it's so damn old. Soft colors, colors that won't be in the
Crayola box for another 10 years. It's all so inviting that on the
day the Crate &AMP; Barrel catalog arrives I cannot cook or clean or
supervise math problems. All I can do is drool because it's all so
cool.
</P>
<P>
   Maya Gottfried, a publicity assistant with Stewart, Tabori &AMP;
Chang in New York, which has published a series of books by Jane
Cumberbatch, ``a pioneer in the down-to-earth-approach to interior
design,'' says we people with the complicated lives eat this stuff
up. Although she is quick to point out that she does not follow the
Cumberbatch credo because she is (gasp) messy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's attractive and it's something everyone can do and those
elements combined make it an easy style for everybody,'' says
Gottfried, earning her New York City salary for the day.
</P>
<P>
   Right, easy style. Unless you are messy. Like Maya. And me.
</P>
<P>
   So, why? Why do I wish my back yard looked more like these sweet
little scenes and less like the Clampetts'?
</P>
<P>
   Is it because my life is too complicated? Is it because I have
good taste? Could I be the long-forgotten daughter of an old Amish
farmer?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps I will find the complicated answer to this simple
question by reading an actual review of an actual book called The
Natural Home: Living the Simple Life:
</P>
<P>
   A sofa slipcovered in khaki sits next to a wicker table holding
a creamy tableau: a candlestick lamp, a crock filled with
wildflowers and Queen Anne's lace, seashells and a pair of baby
shoes. The Queen Anne-style chair painted white is dressed with a
delicately flounced gray-and-white-striped seat cover, and a rustic
folding table is just wide enough for a stack of coffee-table books
or a tray set for afternoon tea.
</P>
<P>
   Afternoon tea? A-ha. It dawns on me. No one has afternoon tea!
We might have coffee. We might have a Diet Pepsi. We might even
have a beer if it's a Saturday. But, afternoon tea? I don't think
so.
</P>
<P>
   People, it's all a scam. And the minute you open the door to
that armoire on Page 66 you will find the homework and the old
bowls of ice cream and heaven knows what else. A body or two?
</P>
<P>
   Life, you see, is not simple. It is roller skates in the laundry
room and three good books, each with a dog-eared page to alert you
where to start again, on the floor next to your bed. It is today's
mail and tomorrow's homework on the table by the front door. It is
a scooter in the driveway, right next to the two weeks' worth of
recycling.
</P>
<P>
   Life, when you live it, is cluttered and messy and complicated.
Indeed, all this clutter, all these complications, all this mess,
is what I've hoped for since I was 10. A husband with big feet who
leaves his tennis shoes in front of the couch every night. A
7-year-old who deposits his wet towel on the wood floor every
morning. These are the lovely signs that I've made it! I'm happy!
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the day I wake up and find two polished stones and a
wilted mint leaf on my nightstand is the day I'll realize, dear
God, it's finally happened:
</P>
<P>
   I've turned into a simpleton with no life.

   &UR; World-renowned Harvard University is an institution increasinly

   HARVARD-I-SPCL (Undated) _ With an endowment of nearly $13

 &HT;     ISRAELI GOVERNMENT HOLDS OFF ON CLOSING CONSULATES IN U.S.
 &HT;     By LARRY KAPLOW 
 &HT;     c.1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has
``frozen'' budget-cutting proposals that might have closed Israel's
consulate in Atlanta, a spokesman said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the Atlanta-area Jewish community were protesting the
suggestions after they surfaced in a report in an Israeli newspaper
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But, Netanyahu spokesman David Bar-Illan said the prime minister
had decided earlier in the week to postpone any consulate closings
and look for other ways for the Israeli Foreign Ministry to meet
across-the-board budget cuts set out by the country's finance
ministry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have frozen all the closures,'' Bar-Illan said. ``We're
starting from square one again ... we feel that we'll have to find
another way to meet the budget.''
</P>
<P>
   Israel keeps 10 consulates and one embassy in the United States
and has 107 missions around the world, according to Foreign
Ministry Spokesman Aviv Shir-On. The Atlanta consulate serves five
states.
</P>
<P>
   He said staff in the ministry suggested more than 20 Israeli
missions that could be closed to save money, but the proposals were
in discussions, not a formal plan or memo.
</P>
<P>
   Shir-On said Israel, a country of just 6 million people,
supports more missions than most countries its size but has so far
avoided closing any.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu has filled in as foreign minister since David Levy
resigned from the job several months ago. Bar-Illan said he
reviewed the budget-cutting proposal last week and decided to hold
off.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Atlanta consulate was important because several
large companies that do business in Israel, including Coca-Cola,
Home Depot and BellSouth, are based there.
</P>
<P>
   Also, he called the southern United States ``important
politically'' for Israel. He said he believes some Christian
Zionist groups, in addition to local Jewish groups, objected to the
possibility of closing the consulate.

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; After President Neil Rudenstine stunned Harvard by taking a
three-month leave of absence for exhaustion in 1994-95, he relaxed
his pace and delegated more tasks. Now, concerns about his
well-being have given way to complaints about his laissez-faire
management style and seeming reluctance to fight for his vision.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Since taking over in 1991, he has guided a remarkably
successful fund-raising drive. But critics say he's such a nice guy
that he doesn't like to say no _ especially to the powerful deans
of Harvard's 12 schools. They say he's missed opportunities to lead
on a range of issues, including the integration of computers into
teaching and reform of the university's governing structure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harvard needed a leader who would push ideas that are new and
different and require a change in the way people think about the
university,'' says Jerry R. Green, a Harvard Business School
professor who spent two years as Rudenstine's first provost. ``Neil
Rudenstine has not met that standard.''
</P>
<P>
   Counters the current provost, Harvey V. Fineberg: ``He has
constantly turned the crank without creating confrontation. Neil's
presidency has never been about Neil. It's always been about
Harvard.''
</P>
<P>
   Rudenstine, 63, was paid $270,057 in 1997 _ modest compared to
other Ivy League presidents _ plus free use of a mansion off
Brattle Street and $28,107 in benefits. He also has $227,000 in
outstanding loans from Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   Approachable and unassuming, Rudenstine has the slightly
absent-minded manner of the Renaissance scholar he once was. He
often arrived late at key meetings before hiring Jacqueline O'Neill
as his staff director. The daughter-in-law of the legendary
politician, Thomas P. ``Tip'' O'Neill Jr., now makes sure he sticks
to a schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Rudenstine still works as many as 85 hours a week, and &UR;  &LR; accepts
so many speaking invitations that he's booked until the year 2000.
He writes speeches in longhand at his desk, and tends to rush
through his delivery as he peers at his audience over his glasses.
He's a voluminous practitioner of the near-forgotten art of writing
letters.
</P>
<P>
   Although not naturally outgoing, he mingles with the Harvard
community. &UR;  &LR; He holds office hours for students, and often brings
pizzas and Cokes to freshmen who live in a dormitory above his
Massachusetts Hall office. As a former dean of students at
Princeton in the turbulent '60s, Rudenstine excels at calming
aggrieved students and alumni. Like another president, he feels
their pain.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Professor Henry Louis Gates Jr., Rudenstine  &UR;  &LR;  has
recruited an unprecedented array of black scholars. And unlike his
predecessor, Derek Bok, Rudenstine relishes one key task:
fund-raising. While Bok was uncomfortable begging, Rudenstine
enjoys making donors' dreams come true. When
publisher-philanthropist Walter Annenberg expressed a desire to
help freshmen, Rudenstine proposed a three-pronged gift _ for
financial aid, seminars, and a new dining commons. Annenberg handed
over $25 million.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Rudenstine has rarely devoted his fund-raising skills to the
ventures that form the cornerstone of his oft-expressed vision of a
more unified Harvard. Contributions have lagged for the
interfaculty initiatives that cross the entrenched boundaries of
Harvard's fiefdoms.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say that he's afraid of challenging the deans, while
supporters say he's just unselfish. ``The president doesn't like to
ask for himself,'' says one staffer.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Beyond Harvard, Rudenstine has kept a low profile on most
education issues, such as the furor over testing of Massachusetts
schoolchildren. He has lobbied to preserve affirmative action in
student admissions and increase government funding for scientific
research.
</P>
<P>
   Rudenstine acknowledges that he had a difficult transition to
Harvard, where he received his doctorate before leaving as an
assistant professor in 1968. Returning as an outsider in 1991, he
faced immediate pressures.
</P>
<P>
   The budget was running a deficit, the endowment suffered from
poor investments, and eight major administrative slots were vacant
_ all as the university was gearing up for a fund-raising campaign.
He couldn't afford to make a mistake _ or take a vacation. After
oversleeping and missing a flight to a fund-raising event in New
York, he realized he needed a break.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't collapse my whole calendar for one or two weeks to
go away,'' he says. ``There was too much hanging on it. I was no
longer 30, I was no longer 40, I was no longer 50, I was well along
in my 50s when I took the job, and 30 months of that was just
sleep-depriving. So I raised up and said, `Look, I'm not doing
myself any good, I'm not going to be able to do the university any
good unless I can really get rest.'''
</P>
<P>
   When he returned from his leave, he says, he realized he had
already made most of the hard decisions. The jobs were filled, the
endowment was flourishing, the campaign was humming. He immediately
scheduled a month's vacation for the next year.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Rudenstine says, he's had ``four or five very
fruitful years.'' Fineberg and O'Neill have assumed much of the
workload, along with assistant Marc Goodheart, who collaborates on
many of Rudenstine's speeches.
</P>
<P>
   Their boss remains a gentle, bookish conciliator _ the polar
opposite of a certain outspoken, swaggering former college
president on the other side of the Charles River. Contrasting him
with John Silber and the Boston University leadership, one Harvard
administrator says, ``I can't imagine Neil abolishing the football
team.''

   CHILD-HEART-MED _ EMBARGOED FOR RELEASE WEDNESDAY AT 5 P.M.
EASTERN _ A new study offers compelling evidence that the
underlying processes causing heart disease begin during childhood.
</P>
<P>
   And as the number of heart disease risk factors increases, so
does the severity of heart disease in young people, according to a
new report based on the autopsies of 93 people ages 2 through 39.
</P>
<P>
   The findings, which appear in Thursday's issue of The New
England Journal of Medicine, are likely to re-fuel a debate on when
heart disease prevention strategies and screening tests should be
implemented.
</P>
<P>
   In the study, researchers compared risk factors for heart
disease _ smoking, elevated cholesterol levels, high blood pressure
and sedentary lifestyle _ with the extent of plaque build-up in the
heart arteries among the patients, all of whom lost their lives due
to various causes, primarily trauma.
</P>
<P>
   ``Interventions related to modifiable risk factors, such as the
prevention of smoking, weight control, and the encouragement of
physical exercise and a prudent diet, if undertaken early in life,
may retard the development of atherosclerosis,'' or hardening of
the heart arteries, according to the study authors.(500 WORDS)

<P>
   ESTROGEN-INCONTINENCE-MED _ EMBARGOED FOR RELEASE WEDNESDAY AT 4
P.M .EASTERN _ SAN DIEGO _ A new study finds that estrogen
supplements are an effective and inexpensive way to significantly
reduce urinary incontinence in menopausal women, Canadian
researchers reported here.
</P>
<P>
   Women ages 62 through 72 given estrogen via an estradiol vaginal
ring experienced significantly fewer episodes of urinary
incontinence and complete resolution of symptoms including painful
urination and frequency of urgency compared to those treated with
placebo, reported Dr. Lynn Stothers of Vancouver. Estradiol is a
synthetic form of the female hormone estrogen.
</P>
<P>
   And 70 percent of women treated with the estrogen therapy
reported a more than 25 percent improvement in their quality of
life compared to only 20 percent among those treated with placebo.
The lifetime cost of using the estradiol ring was $4,500 per
patient compared to $21,500 for women taking a placebo. Part of the
reduced cost was due to the women's less frequent use of protective
garments.
</P>
<P>
   The estradiol ring provides a continuous dose of 2 milligrams
per day of estrogen and lasts for three months.
</P>
<P>
   Stothers is expected to present her findings Wednesday at the
annual meeting of the American Urological Association. (500 WORDS)

<P>
   OPTIMISM-IMMUNITY-MED _ Optimism under stress may improve more
than a person's mood _ a new study suggests that it may also boost
the immune system, or at least ward off the immune-related effects
of stress.
</P>
<P>
   Among 50 first-year law students, those who began the semester
confident that they would succeed had more white blood cells known
as helper T cells than more pessimistic students midway through the
semester. At the beginning of the semester, both groups had nearly
identical levels, noted lead researcher Suzanne Segerstrom, who is
now an assistant professor of psychology at the University of
Kentucky in Lexington.
</P>
<P>
   Helper T cells are the ``conductors'' of the immune system, and
help direct and amplify the body's reaction against foreign agents
such as bacteria or viruses.
</P>
<P>
   In the study, other white blood cells that can kill cancer cells
in the laboratory, known as natural killer cells, were more
effective in optimistic students mid-semester than in pessimistic
students.
</P>
<P>
   This suggests that optimism may affect physical health as well
as psychological health when healthy people are exposed to stress,
according to the report, which appears in the June issue of the
Journal of Personality and Social Psychology. (500 WORDS)

<P>
   HIV-SURVEY-MED _ WASHINGTON _ A survey of physicians reveals
that many are not treating patients with HIV and AIDS according to
recommended national guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Leading AIDS physicians, including Dr. John Bartlett, chief of
the infectious disease division at Johns Hopkins University, and
Dr. Paul Volberding, professor of medicine at the University of
California, San Francisco, are expected to discuss why doctors
might not be following these guidelines and potential solutions to
make sure each AIDS patient receives the best possible treatment.

<P>
   LLANGAMMARCH, Wales _ What in the name of David Lloyd George is
coming out of my television set? The picture _ of a rugby game _ is
perfectly clear, but the sound seems hopelessly, bizarrely,
garbled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ac mae Neil Jenkins newdd drosi cais,'' says the announcer,
``i Bontypridd yn erbyn Llanelli.'' (As it's later translated for
me: ``... and Neil Jenkins has just converted a goal for Pont y
Pridd against Llanelli.'')
</P>
<P>
   What I am hearing is, by some accounts, the oldest spoken
language in Europe, a tongue heard in this misty and mountainous
country since the time of the Roman legions. What I am hearing is
the voice of an ancient and storied culture.
</P>
<P>
   What I am hearing is ``Cymraeg'' _ Welsh.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when much of the world is acquiescing to _ if not
downright welcoming _ Anglo-American cultural hegemony, Wales seems
to be moving in the opposite direction, slowly but inexorably
reasserting its Welshness.
</P>
<P>
   From the sign that greeted us as we crossed the River Severn
bridge _ ``Croeso I Cymru,'' ``Welcome to Wales'' _ to the
red-dragon flags flapping from the battlements of crumbling
castles, to the newly built Druid stone circles in the villages, it
was obvious that Wales may be part of Great Britain, but _ as the
Welsh will be the first to tell you _ it is most definitely not
part of England.
</P>
<P>
   After more than 700 years of trying to remake Wales in its own
image, London has in recent years reversed course, permitting the
Welsh to vote on a measure of self-rule, which they narrowly
approved last year, and spending $120 million a year to broadcast
television in Welsh. (To hear it, turn to channel 4 in Wales; it's
called S4C.) In part because of this, the number of Welsh speakers,
which for years had held steady at 20 percent of Wales' population,
is actually on the upswing.
</P>
<P>
   Like many Americans, I tended to think of Wales _ when I thought
of it at all _ as a loosely defined place, somewhere west of
London, where Prince Charles reigned: a place where he could
practice in relative obscurity before becoming the British monarch.
</P>
<P>
   I tended to think of Wales as the home of the singer Tom Jones,
the actor Richard Burton and the singing coal miners of the film
``How Green Was My Valley.'' I tended to think of it as a place
whose language, with its confounding clusters of consonants, looks
like my tray in Scrabble after a particularly bad draw. (Think I'm
exaggerating? The Welsh word for beer is ``cwrw.'')
</P>
<P>
   And, like most Americans, I hardly ever went there. Of the 3.4
million U.S. citizens who visited Great Britain last year, only
about 170,000 made it to Wales. Most of them toured the rural
north; on this trip I wanted to see the more populated south, with
its old coal-mining valleys, its Dylan Thomas seaside villages and
its capital city, Cardiff, the future home of Wales' new national
assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Heading west on the M4 motorway from London, I crossed the River
Severn bridge, entered Wales and almost immediately encountered a
castle. Chepstow Castle, guarding the old strategic crossing of the
River Wye, was begun by William the Conqueror's troops in 1067, one
year after the Battle of Hastings.
</P>
<P>
   Like many of the others, it was built in a
not-entirely-successful attempt to subdue the Welsh.
</P>
<P>
   With more than 200 stone fortresses in its 8,000 square miles,
Wales claims to be the most densely castled place on Earth. This
will give you some idea of how common they are: Bernard Llewellyn's
father-in-law bought one by mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Carreg Cennen, standing acropolis-like on a hilltop above the
tiny hamlet of Trapp, was built in 1248 as a Welsh stronghold. It
fell into English hands 30 years later and stayed there, more or
less, until Llewellyn's father-in-law came along in 1953.
</P>
<P>
   By then the castle, in ruins, was part of a vast estate
belonging to the ninth Earl of Cawdor, whose distant predecessor
figures prominently in Shakespeare's Macbeth. Financial trouble
forced the earl to sell off parts of his estate, and when
Llewellyn's family bought a parcel it discovered to its surprise
that the deed included the castle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody thought much about it for a long time,'' Llewellyn told
me over a steaming cup of tea in his shop. ``Then the earl came
back and said he'd never meant to include the castle in the sale.
He tried to buy it back, but my father-in-law would have none of
it. Carreg Cennen was finally back in Welsh hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Another castle that has figured prominently in Wales in recent
years is Caernarfon, in north Wales, where Charles was invested as
Prince of Wales in 1969. Since its construction in 1281 it has
served as a symbol of English domination over the Welsh. The
following year, the English defeated Llewellen ap Gruffydd, the
last Welsh Prince of Wales, and, ever since then, the title has
gone to the heir to the English throne.
</P>
<P>
   It's an entirely ceremonial appellation; Charles, Prince of
Wales, actually has no official standing in Wales. Still, for Welsh
nationalists, this is a recurring thorn in the side. Perhaps it's
no coincidence that the Welsh nationalist movement is strongest
around Caernarfon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody here considers Charles our prince,'' a man told me one
night in a pub near Cardiff. ``He's not a bad fellow _ he's managed
to learn a few words of our language and he visits more often than
some of the others. But nobody in the royal family maintains an
official residence here.''
</P>
<P>
   The official capital of Wales is not Caernarfon, but Cardiff.
It's a young city by British standards: in 1800 it was a fishing
village with fewer than 1,900 residents. Cardiff is often dismissed
as not very Welsh and not very interesting _ the latter charge, I
thought, rather unfair. Its thriving downtown is an appealing mix
of Victorian, Georgian and Edwardian architecture, and its National
Museum of Wales houses a surprisingly good collection of Monets,
Renoirs, Cezannes _ and what is believed by some to be Van Gogh's
last painting.
</P>
<P>
   (MORE ... MORE)
</P>
<P>
   The impressionist collection, the gleaming white-stone building
that houses it and pretty much everything else in Cardiff owe their
existence to the dirty-black substance once found in great seams
deep beneath the valleys to the north. Most of the coal extracted
from southern Wales _ a third of the entire world's supply _ was
shipped through the docks of Cardiff, transforming it from a sleepy
backwater into one of the world's busiest ports.
</P>
<P>
   The owner of the docks, the wealthy and eccentric third Marquis
of Bute, also owned the castle in town, and in the late 1800s he
hired an even more eccentric architect, William Burges, to help him
spruce it up.
</P>
<P>
   Burges had a fondness for smoking opium and walking around town
with a parrot on his shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   One chamber of his castle is an exquisitely detailed celebration
of Chaucer; another is filled with sensuous Islamic wood carvings.
The marquis looked over the artisans' shoulders constantly during
construction, and when the rooms were completed he never set foot
in them.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the castle, in a vast park incorporating its old
grounds, stands a circle of Druid stones, looking a bit like a
low-budget Stonehenge. I assumed they were ancient until our guide,
Emyr Griffith, told me they were installed in recent years for an
``eisteddfod,'' the annual Welsh cultural festival held at a
different site each year in August.
</P>
<P>
   At these festivals, which include music, dance, poetry and other
arts, Wales invokes its ancient Celtic heritage with Druid rituals
and pageantry. Participants attend ceremonies in robes and hoods,
and young maidens dance with flowers and mistletoe; the president
of the eisteddfod is called the Archdruid.
</P>
<P>
   It's a pointed reminder that the culture of Wales predates the
Anglo-Saxons, the Normans, even the Romans.

<P>
   The coal mines that built Cardiff have nearly all shut down, but
today the city is enjoying new prosperity as the burgeoning
political capital of Wales. A number of government and media
institutions have moved there from London, and construction will
begin soon on a hall for the new national assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Signs of growing political confidence are everywhere. Alongside
the Union Jack _ and sometimes independent of it _ flaps the
red-dragon flag of Wales, which is believed to be a direct
descendant of a Roman standard. Outside the museum stands a statue
of the most famous Welsh politician of them all, David Lloyd
George, the only Welshman ever to serve as British prime minister,
from 1916 to 1922.
</P>
<P>
   He is a hero in Wales, and the sight of the statue caused
Griffith to break out into the old Welsh schoolboy song, ``Lloyd
George Knew My Father.''
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, the following day we were in Swansea, Wales'
second city, when word came down that it had lost out to its bitter
rival, Cardiff, as the home for the national assembly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wrong! Wrong! Wrong!'' screamed a headline in the
Swansea-based South Wales Evening Post, a newspaper that once
employed a cub reporter named Dylan Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   Swansea has a bit of an inferiority complex, which has not been
helped by Thomas' oft-repeated description of it as an ``ugly,
lovely town.'' The phrase, it must be said, is fairly apt. Bombed
heavily by the Nazis during World War II, it was rebuilt at a time
that surely will not go down as a golden age of architecture. Yet
Swansea has a roguish charm, and, as its residents rarely tire of
pointing out, it's much more Welsh than Cardiff. You're more likely
to hear people speaking Cymraeg there.
</P>
<P>
   We spent a morning at the Dylan Thomas Centre, a museum and arts
center devoted to Swansea's most famous native son. The poet may be
more closely associated with the town of Laugharne, where he did
much of his writing, but he was born, raised and schooled in
Swansea.
</P>
<P>
   In the Thomas center, Pat Hughes, a former city council member,
and Vyz Jones staged an impromptu, 15-minute recitation of part of
Thomas' ``Under the Milk Wood Tree,'' a BBC radio play depicting a
day in the life of LLareggub, a fictional southern Welsh seaside
town. Hughes pointed out that the impish Thomas intentionally chose
the town's name, which is ``bugger all'' spelled backwards. (The
BBC changed the spelling to Llaregyb in its promotional
literature.)

   Thomas knew little of the Welsh language _ when he was growing
up students who dared speak it in class were marched off to the
headmaster's office _ but the rhythms, cadences and bold words he
used were pure Welsh in style. He's regarded as one of the finest
products of a country that takes its poetry seriously _ Wales'
national anthem proclaims it ``gwlad beirdd a chantorion, enwogion
of fri'' (``land of poets, singers and eminent men'').

   Like John Steinbeck in Salinas, Thomas is beloved much more in
his home town in death than he ever was in life. ``When he lived
here he was thought of as a drunkard, a womanizer and a sponger,''
acknowledged Hughes. One exhibit in the museum appears to confirm
two out of three: It is Thomas' long and detailed liquor bill,
marked ``cf'' for ``carried forward,'' or unpaid.

<P>
   One day we drove up through one of the great coal valleys to the
town of Blaenafon. The landscape surprised me: I'd expected to see
slag heaps, scarred hillsides and other industrial-age desolation.
But the countryside was verdant and pastoral. Only the
grass-covered lumps of the old slag heaps gave any hint of what
once transpired here.
</P>
<P>
   In the 20 years since the coal mines shut down, the countryside
of ``How Green Was My Valley'' has become green once again.
</P>
<P>
   On a hillside above town we donned miners' helmets, headlamps
and heavy battery packs and descended 300 feet into the Earth. Big
Pit, once one of south Wales' most productive coal mines, is now
one of its prime tourist attractions.
</P>
<P>
   Like everyone else who works there, our guide, Terry Mason, is a
former miner. ``See that?'' he said, pointing to a 3-foot-high
alcove cut into a shiny black wall of coal. ``I worked in spaces
just like that for seven years.''
</P>
<P>
   As we walked through the dank, dripping tunnels of the old mine,
Mason explained that children as young as six once worked all day
in pitch-darkness, opening and closing doors for ponies pulling
coal trains. Methane explosions were a constant threat, and the
mine used the proverbial canaries to detect the gas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their metabolism is faster than ours, so they'd pass out first
if the methane got too high,'' he said. ``We wouldn't just leave
them to die _ we'd carry them up to the surface.''
</P>
<P>
   In the mine's museum is a box with an oxygen cylinder used to
revive the little birds.
</P>
<P>
   At its height, around World War I, Big Pit employed nearly 1,500
miners working in three shifts. It shut down in 1980, exactly a
century after it opened, and reopened three years later as a
tourist site. It now employs about 50 former miners.
</P>
<P>
   After Mason had finished telling us about the long hours of
back-breaking labor, the low pay, the omnipresent coal dust and the
constant threat of accidents, I asked him what it was like the day
the mine shut down. He looked me straight in the eye and said: ``It
was the saddest day of my life,'' and I believed him.
</P>
<P>
   One drizzly night we drove up the most famous coal valley of
them all, the Rhondda, to the town of Treorchy. In a little stone
schoolhouse, stout, barrel-chested men in their 50s and 60s were
filing in and taking their places in concentric half-circles.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly unemployed coal miners, these men are members of the
world-renowned Treorchy Men's Choir. ``In the old days we used to
sing together in the pits,'' one of them, Meurig Hughes, told me.
</P>
<P>
   Begun in 1883 as a way to keep miners out of trouble, the choir
has performed for royalty, toured the United States and recorded
with Ella Fitzgerald and local-boy-made-good Tom Jones. It has
produced 46 records and CDs, making it possibly the most-recorded
male choir in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually all proceeds from recordings and performances go to
charity.
</P>
<P>
   As the men took their places for their weekly rehearsal, I
couldn't help concluding that the choir has filled a huge void in
their lives, sustaining a sense of purpose and community since the
closing of the mines.
</P>
<P>
   In blue jeans and sweat shirts, hands clasped behind their
backs, the men peered through bifocals at their sheet music. They
sang in English and Welsh, but it was the latter that captivated
me. Spoken Welsh does not fall sweetly on my ear, but as the mens'
voices blended and echoed off the wooden floor and metal pipes of
the schoolhouse, the sound was hauntingly beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ah, Welsh,'' Hughes said during a break. ``We call it the
language of heaven.''

BACK TO SCHOOL ON SHOOTINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Two weeks after the latest school shooting, the
television networks are still doing specials on guns and schools.
</P>
<P>
   The supposed epidemic of school shootings has led legislators in
several states to propose trying juveniles as adults, and even
allowing them to be sentenced to death.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of gun control have been thrown into a tizzy. Instead
of going after guns sold out of automobile trunks in the inner
city, they are forced politically to deal with the hunting guns
used by kids in the rural shootings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are legislating by sound bite instead of sound policy,''
says Vincent Schiraldi, in a pretty good sound bite.
</P>
<P>
   He's used to having to make them. As director of the Center for
Justice Policy Institute, this San Francisco man has had to go on
CNN and add some needed facts to the uproar after the May 21 school
shooting in Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   CNN's Greta Van Susteren didn't believe him when he said there
is no epidemic of school shootings. But here are some statistics:
In 1992, 55 killings occurred in America's schools. In 1997 it was
down to 25.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, 88 people were killed by lightning in 1997.
Schiraldi says he hates to see rural schools start spending money
on metal detectors and security guards instead of books.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the functional equivalent of everyone buying lightning
rods,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Schiraldi says that in the last eight months, while the five
highly publicized rural school shootings occurred, 933 juveniles
were murdered in the inner city. He says people invariably ask if
the kids were shot in the schools, and he responds, ``No, but
they're just as dead. Stop looking in the schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider that the Los Angeles County School System, with about
600,000 students, has not had a homicide since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, consider that while the homicide rate in the United
States dropped 20 percent between 1992 and 1996, the number of
homicides reported on network news increased by 721 percent.
</P>
<P>
   It's good for ratings, even if it may be bad for the psyches of
children, voters and politicians. Fear sells. Kids are
impressionable and may become copycats. Adults are impressionable
and may pass bad laws.
</P>

HAND-BUILT CASTLE REMAINS A MYSTERY _ EVEN TO ITS PRINCESS

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ As a child, Mary Lou Gulley would build sand castles
on the beach near her Seattle home. And she would sit on her
father's lap, listening to stories about dragons and princesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please, Daddy, build me a big and strong castle someday that I
can live in,'' she remembers pleading almost seven decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   But then Daddy ran away.
</P>
<P>
   For 16 years, Mary Lou Gulley and her mother, Francis, were
unaware of Boyce Gulley's whereabouts. They were unaware that when
informed by doctors that he had tuberculosis, Gulley fled toward
the desert to spare his family his burden.
</P>
<P>
   They also were unaware that he was hand-building his daughter's
castle in the foothills of a mountain range 10 miles south of
downtown Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Combining wit, ingenuity and hard work with knowledge gained
from two years of architectural studies at Texas A&AMP;M University,
Gulley meticulously constructed an 8,000-square-foot native stone
castle that includes 18 rooms; 13 fireplaces; a mind-boggling
hodgepodge of arches, parapets, bell towers, columns, sun decks,
stairways and trap doors; eclectic interior decorations bought or
borrowed from old railroad depots, from Mexican or Indian
marketplaces, from the vast desert landscape or from Gulley's
imagination. ...
</P>
<P>
   And now a real-life princess.
</P>
<P>
   Since learning of her father's adventure following his death
from cancer in 1945, Mary Lou Gulley has reigned over her castle.
She has lived here year-round, conducting tours nine months a year,
four days a week, to make ends meet. She introduces visitors to a
remarkable, one-of-a-kind home known as the Mystery Castle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here is the chapel; over there is the bar,'' she says. ``This
room in between, we call purgatory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure what my father meant by the room located nine
feet beneath the trap door in purgatory. He called it the
inlaw-outlaw room. We use it for guests who like to stay more than
three days.''
</P>
<P>
   A tombstone is positioned near the bar. The inscription: ``From
beer to eternity.'' Nearby, a makeshift bed: ``Bunks for drunks,''
Gulley explains.
</P>
<P>
   An 1860s pump organ still functions in the foyer leading to the
chapel. ``It was the first in the Tombstone Territory,'' the
Mystery Castle princess says. ``It was once played by the chocolate
widow. She supposedly killed six husbands with her chocolate cake.
And I've got the recipe.''
</P>
<P>
   Couples come from miles around to get married in the chapel.
``We give the bride the chocolate recipe,'' Gulley says, ``and we
show the groom the trap door.''
</P>
<P>
   Each room is striking in its originality. And its practicality.
</P>
<P>
   A circular window is made from wire-wheel rims of the Stutz
Bearcat Boyce Gulley drove to Arizona. Another set of windows is
made from old refrigerator dishes originally intended for storing
food. A two-level bedroom is built around the skeleton of an
enormous saguaro cactus. A brass bed is constructed on tracks so
that it can be rolled away and hidden in a wall.
</P>
<P>
   Built-in tequila bottles help stabilize the bar. The 13
fireplaces serve both as structural pillars and as an effective
heating mechanism on chilly evenings, and sunken conversation pits
beside them are considered forerunners of modern architecture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, they'd call this organic architecture,'' Gulley says.
``It's the first totally recycled castle in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at these bricks my father used,'' she says. ``They're
rejects from the kiln. In his day, they were called clinkers. Then
Frank Lloyd Wright started using them, and now they're called
expensive.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Gulley, Wright and Boyce Gulley became friends and
learned from each other. Unlike Wright's, her father's legacy is
concentrated on this one contribution, but the Mystery Castle's
unique architecture has received numerous regional and national
awards.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, it's pure fun. Mary Lou Gulley points to a sign
fronting a steep, twisting, free-standing outdoor staircase that
says: ``If these stairs you dare to climb, you'll be pushing up
daisies before your time.''
</P>
<P>
   The main wonder is that Boyce Gulley labored alone in building
the Mystery Castle, logging water from nearby canals and mixing
native caliche with goats' milk, a technique he learned from
American Indians.
</P>
<P>
   He constructed almost every room on a different level and with
an individual shape, whimsically including secret nooks and
crannies _ and, yes, those trap doors. There was no running water;
indeed, Gulleyand her mother lived there for a quarter-century
before water and electricity became available.
</P>
<P>
   Boyce Gulley toiled part time as a shoe salesman to earn money
to pay for materials and for artifacts associated with desert life
_ and, as his daughter puts it, his dreams.
</P>
<P>
   The setting was _ and is _ spectacular: Even as the
Phoenix-Scottsdale area continues to expand, the Mystery Castle
stands alone _ save for the green cactuses that seem to spread
forever _ on the edge of a hillside, affording a wondrous panorama
of the sprawling metropolis.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Lou Gulley opens her home to visitors October through
June,11 a.m.-4 p.m. Thursdays through Sundays. She guides tours in
small groups. Cost is $4 for adults, with discounts for children.
</P>
<P>
   From the downtown area, drive south on Seventh Avenue (with one
easy zigzag at Baseline Road) to the foothills of 16,500-acre South
Mountain Park, about 10 miles. Turn left (east) on Mineral Road;
you will see the castle, and ample parking is provided.
</P>
<P>
   For information, write to Mystery Castle, 800 E. Mineral Road,
Phoenix, Ariz., 85040. Or call 602-254-6500 for information on this
and other Phoenix-area attractions.

IN HOLLYWOOD, LOVE CONQUERS ALL DESPITE AGE DISPARITIES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLIFFORD PUGH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Gabrielle Cosgriff loved ``Bulworth.'' But she was put
off by the huge age difference _ 32 years to be exact _ between
Warren Beatty and his love interest, Halle Berry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just drove me crazy,'' said Cosgriff, a Houston writer who
has co-authored a new book, ``Chicks on Film: Video Picks for Women
and Other Intelligent Forms of Life'' (Avon Books, $12). &UR;  &LR; ``I kept
praying she would say `goodbye and good luck' and get on with her
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Fat chance.
</P>
<P>
   A slew of big-budget movies this summer might as well be
subtitled ``The Geezer Gets the Gal'' because each pairs an aging
movie star with an actress young enough to be his daughter or, in
some cases, granddaughter.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Bulworth,'' Beatty, 61, romances Berry, 29.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Horse Whisperer,'' 37-year-old Kristin Scott-Thomas
falls for Robert Redford, 60.
</P>
<P>
   In ``6 Days, 7 Nights,'' which opens June 12, Harrison Ford, 55,
is stranded on a desert island with Anne Heche, 28.
</P>
<P>
   In ``A Perfect Murder,'' which opens Friday, Michael Douglas,
53, plots to kill his 25-year-old trophy wife, played by Gwyneth
Paltrow.
</P>
<P>
   And in ``As Good As It Gets,'' recently released on video, Helen
Hunt, 34, is charmed by 61-year-old Jack Nicholson.
</P>
<P>
   After the Academy Award-winning movie came out late last year,
it triggered lively discussions among women movie-goers who had
bones to pick with the May/December romance depicted. True,
sometimes the age disparity isn't a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a difference when it's Harrison Ford or Sean
Connery,'' said Anne Reifenberg, co-author with Cosgriff and
Cynthia Thomas of ``Chicks on Film.'' ``With some men, it just
doesn't matter.''
</P>
<P>
   But with Nicholson, well, some of the physique critiques were
less than kind. Words like ``wrinkles'' and ``age spots'' got
tossed around.
</P>
<P>
   And how realistic was that romance anyway? Or any of the older
man/younger couplings we're always seeing in the movies?
</P>
<P>
   Not very.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the talk about ``trophy wives,'' relationships
between older men and younger women don't happen that often in real
life, says clinical psychologist Betty Cartmell, president of the
Houston Psychological Association. And when they do, they don't
tend to last, she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it does happen, as a psychologist I think less of the
male who's involved, generally speaking. He's trying to cope with
the aging process by having someone who's newer and younger on his
arm,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the message at the multiplex is drastically different, says
Beth Olson, associate professor of communications at the University
of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``What it tells women is that you can be a participant in a
romantic relationship as long as you look good,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Lentz, vice president of Actresses(at)Work, a
California-based coalition of actresses who are over 40, is more
blunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main message they're putting out is you will disappear
once you are no longer without lines and lumps. And that's a real
shame.''
</P>
<P>
   The older man/younger woman syndrome is nothing new in the
movies.
</P>
<P>
   Audrey Hepburn was romanced by much older actors, including Cary
Grant in ``Charade'' (1963), and Gary Cooper in ``Love in the
Afternoon'' (1957). Clark Gable often was paired with much younger
actresses, including Lana Turner in ``Honky Tonk'' (in 1941) and
Marilyn Monroe in ``The Misfits'' (in 1961).
</P>
<P>
   ``It goes back to Bogey and Bacall,'' says Lentz. ``But at least
back then, there were still women over 40 in the films. Now they're
almost invisible. You think about Jane Fonda having played opposite
Robert Redford in three films and now she's too old for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Redford and Fonda are, in fact, the same age _ 60.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood producers say the simple fact of life is male stars
outlast their female counterparts in popularity.
</P>
<P>
   While Clint Eastwood, 67, remains a superstar, along with Ford,
Redford and Beatty, such female icons as Fonda, Sally Field, 51,
Diane Keaton, 52, and Meryl Streep, 48, don't command anywhere
close to the same salaries, roles or attention.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps only Barbra Streisand, 56, measures up in terms of
clout. But no one is thinking of casting her in a movie with
23-year-old Leonardo DiCaprio as her love interest.
</P>
<P>
   Cosgriff believes producers often cast attractive young women
with established male box office stars to appeal to a younger
audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``It covers all their bases,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Olson, who teaches a course on gender and communication at the
University of Houston, points out that older anchormen are paired
with younger women on TV newscasts all the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We as a society allow men to age more gracefully than we do
for women. So men have a longer career and we see them in films, on
the news sets or on the television set when they're into their 60s
and 70s,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   She points out that nowadays, a few newswomen over 40 are
popping up on TV screens. ``But there is still a disparity,'' she
says.
</P>
<P>
   In real-life romances, even though factors vary, Cartmell
believes anything more than a 10-year age difference can cause some
long-term relationship problems because each person is in a
different place in life.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(MORE) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   She adds that relationships seem to work best when people have a
lot in common, including race, religion, shared values _ and age.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you think about it, most people connect in high school or
college where age is a common factor,'' she says. ``It puts the
couple in the same place developmentally.''
</P>
<P>
   However, some factors may mitigate age differences between a
couple, she says. If it's a second marriage and the children are
the same age, the family may function well even if there's more
than a 10-year age gap between the parents.
</P>
<P>
   The couple's ages when they get together also makes a
difference. ``There's more differences between (ages) 20 and 30
than there is between 40 and 50,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   But psychotherapist Eugene Webb _ author of ``Men Are No Damn
Good! (Pending Further Research)'' (Resource Publications Inc.,
$14.95), a book that explores the pitfalls of being male in a
gender-conscious age and culture _ believes some older men seek out
younger women because they view them as developmental equals
despite the age difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of older men who are grown-up little boys,''
he says. ``That's as good as it gets for them.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In real life, Webb says couples regularly enter into a
relationship where one is the caretaker. It's a role an older man
often likes to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately we guys have a lot of trouble getting out of
that phase,'' he says. ``We go through a marriage and a woman often
is ready for a more equal relationship. And that's the kiss of
death.''
</P>
<P>
   So the couple splits up and the man gets together with a younger
woman to re-create the same kind of unequal relationship he had
before, Webb says.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   In the movies, Woody Allen is the prime example of a man who
can't seem to deal with a woman his age, says Cynthia Freeland,
professor of philosophy at the University of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   In most of Allen's movies, the 62-year-old actor/director ends
up with a much younger woman who finds him irresistible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some men can't deal with women their own age because they are
afraid that the women will see through them,'' says Freeland.
``Women their age won't be so mystified by their aura of authority
and wisdom because they can see their foibles.''
</P>
<P>
   However, as far as the silver screen goes, attitudes may be
slowly changing. Some reviews have poked fun at the absurdity of
such large age differences in ``Bulworth'' and ``The Horse
Whisperer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is more awareness and commentary on it now than there
used to be when it was Jimmy Stewart or Cary Grant,'' says
Freeland.
</P>
<P>
   And the flip side will be showcased this fall when the movie
version of Terry McMillian's 1996 novel, ``How Stella Got Her
Groove Back,'' opens. The story features a 40-year-old divorced
mother, played by Angela Bassett, who is relentlessly pursued by a
hunk 20 years her junior (Taye Diggs) while on vacation in Jamaica.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, some critics point out that some of the actors are
acknowledging their age in these movies. ln ``6 Days, 7 Nights,''
Ford tells Heche he's too old for her before they decide love
conquers all. Beatty tells Berry the same thing in ``Bulworth.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But then he kisses her,'' says Lentz. ``I would have liked for
him to say, `I'm way too old for you so I'll introduce you to my
son.' But that's not going to happen.''

By SYD KEARNEY 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   STOCKHOLM, Sweden _ One of the rewards of a harsh winter is the
prospect of a brilliant summer.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere is that more true than in Sweden, where the winters can
be cold and dark and cruel, and the summers ... well, the summers
are like wildflowers _ colorful, fragrant and short-lived.
</P>
<P>
   So the Swedes do not waste a minute of summer, rising early for
work, stopping for a sack lunch on a park bench, then bathing in
the last rays of evening sunshine on a cafe patio.
</P>
<P>
   The Swedes also spend many of these long summer days on the
water. Their playground: the Stockholm Archipelago. Comprising more
than 24,000 islands, the archipelago offers a Viking's bounty of
shoreline and recreational opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to see this region in summer is by boat, exploring
the freshwater Lake Malaren or venturing into the brackish Baltic
Sea. Along the way, you can barbecue on a rocky island, hike
through a wooded preserve or shuffle around a centuries-old castle.
</P>
<P>
   All of these activities are part of a exceptional nine-day tour
called ``Impressions of a Swedish Summer.'' The outfitter, Special
Expeditions, has long been a leader in ecotours to the Galapagos
Islands and other environmentally sensitive destinations. Wanting
to introduce travelers to the culture of his ancestral home,
Special Expeditions founder Sven-Olof Lindblad began these tours
three years ago. This season's first tour departs June 14, with six
more scheduled throughout the summer.
</P>
<P>
   The trip is lovely in its simplicity. During the day passengers
observe the rugged beauty of the Swedish coast from the deck of a
private cruiser. At night, they check into historical inns, where
traditional Swedish meals await. The excursions are varied and
memorable: a private music recital, a chatty visit with a
lighthouse keeper.
</P>
<P>
   This holiday begins in the village of Mariefred, home of the
14th-century Gripsholms Castle. Mariefred is the kind of town you
dream about: teens picnic in the park, streetlights romantically
illuminate the alleys, bikes and cars share the roads in harmony.
</P>
<P>
   I spend an afternoon at the Royal Deer Garden, a partially
wooded tract on the edge of Lake Malaren. Trudging along a
well-worn path, I spot a few fleeing tails. It is only after a stop
for a drink of water that I notice the beasts peeking out from the
brush. Dozens of tall deer are gazing back at me. We watch one
another for several minutes and then move on.
</P>
<P>
   Gripsholm Castle serves as Sweden's portrait gallery, with more
than 4,000 works in its collection. Although the castle dates to
1380, it appears now as it did in 1530 when it was remodeled by
King Gustav Vasa. The most remarkable room is the theater, which
was built in 1781 for King Gustav III, a patron of the arts who
frequently was the star of his own productions. Squeezed into a
castle tower, the theater makes the most of its space. Its
neoclassical design and the stage's odd slant make the theater
appear much larger than it really is.
</P>
<P>
   The kings' guests would have been seated on the cushioned
benches below the royal box, while high above, elaborate peepholes
provided a view of the stage for the servants.
</P>
<P>
   A private concert at the castle _ arranged by Special
Expeditions _ takes place in the Throne Room. A flute and guitar
piece commissioned by Greenpeace recalls whale songs, and the
experience is heightened by the sound of gulls over the lake.
</P>
<P>
   I watch the gulls through an open window and daydream of
Vikings. The lady next to me dozes, occasionally jerking awake to
the sound of applause.
</P>
<P>
   We spend the night across the road from the castle at Gripsholm
Vardshus, Sweden's oldest hotel. The hotel was built on the site of
a 15th-century monastery and began business as an inn in 1609. Its
parquet floors and painted walls make for appealing public areas.
The hotel's restaurant is candlelighted and formal. I opt for a
meal at the hotel's pub. Located at the rear of the hotel, the pub
is popular with the locals, who pack the place each night to enjoy
live music.
</P>
<P>
   An unscheduled performance begins on the patio with a drunken
troubadour serenading diners. He croons ``Sitting on the dock of
the bay ...'' but becomes distracted after the opening line. A few
moments later, he begins a Jimmy Buffett tune.
</P>
<P>
   I retire before he remembers the second line, heading to the
hotel's wide front lawn, where comfortable wooden chairs are
strategically placed for the best views of the lake. The last
golden rays of the day create a living zoetrope as a young boy
skates on in-lines skates past a white picket fence.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A LEISURELY CRUISE &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Days aboard the Swedish Islander, our cruiser, are leisurely.
There's always a snack handy, the bar is open and the deck
inviting. The 19 passengers, mostly couples and mostly seniors, are
cordial. This tour often attracts families with children, but this
was the last trip of the summer, traditionally drawing a more
mature crowd.
</P>
<P>
   The ship's crew is young and handsome. Their genuine camaraderie
translates well with the passengers. Our guide is Jenny Hartzell, a
young women from Stockholm who is well-versed in her country's
history and culture. This is Hartzell's seventh Expedition trip;
she is efficient and friendly, but no mother hen. Her claim to fame
could be knowing every ice cream stand in the archipelago.
</P>
<P>
   After a stop for nature walk on a wooded island, it is Hartzell
who guides us out of the woods and into a ice cream shop where they
make their own frozen dessert. The choices are strawberry, pear and
an egg custard with chocolate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Exquisite,'' says Fred Atton of the pear-flavored ice cream.
``Every bit is exquisite.''
</P>
<P>
   Atton and his wife, Joan, are one of two British couples on the
trip. Atton's fine head of snow-white hair reminds me of Pa Kettle.
</P>
<P>
   His interest in botany is sated on several short hikes we make
as a group, including a walk on the island nature reserve Bullero.
Bullero once was home to wildlife artist Bruno Liljefors, who
acquired it in 1908. It has been a wildlife preserve since the late
1960s and, like all the islands in the archipelago, welcomes
day-trippers.
</P>
<P>
   Sweden's public access laws give one and all the right to enjoy
the shores of its 24,000 islands. You can camp, fish, hike and swim
on any island, as long as you are not on farmland and not too close
to a home.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more interesting stops along our water route is
Landsort, where we visit one of Sweden's oldest lighthouses. The
reward for climbing the more than 100 steep steps to the top is a
magnificent view of scores of tiny wind-raked islands and the
village, which, with a population of 31, has many more buildings
than people.
</P>
<P>
   A livelier but no less lovely setting awaits in Trosa, where we
bunked for two nights at the Trosa Stadshotellet. A river snakes
charmingly through this colorful town where boats seem more useful
than cars. The houses are painted lemon, mustard and cotton-candy
pink. The traditionally painted houses are red, trimmed in white
and topped with tiles the color of cloud berries.
</P>
<P>
   Cloud berries are a local delicacy. I enjoyed them as a tart
topping for vanilla ice cream. I would like to say that I
discovered the little place that served them, but with all the ice
cream shops in the archipelago, Hartzell was there first.
</P>
<P>
   She drew a map for me.
</P>
<P>
   The nine-day ``Impressions of a Swedish Summer'' tour is being
offered June 14, 24 and 29, July 9 and 14, and Aug. 8 and 13. Trips
originate and end in Stockholm. Per-person fares start at $2,890
and cover lodging and most meals. Air fare is not included. Call

<P>
   The recent nuclear tests in the South Asian subcontinent have
shaken the international community. Their consequences are much
more than just the start of a regional nuclear-arms race.
</P>
<P>
   Some people are already saying that nuclear non-proliferation
and disarmament is now a lost cause. That may turn out to be true,
but only if the policy makers of major powers confine themselves to
short-term reaction, without drawing appropriate conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   But some of the suggestions being made in the wake of the tests
could lead to exactly the wrong conclusions. Some see them as a
pretext for refusing to ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty
and even abandoning negotiations on reducing and eliminating
nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubt in my mind that by their recent actions India
and Pakistan have not strengthened their security. To the contrary,
by launching the mechanism of mutual threats they have added a
strong element of unpredictability to the already difficult
security equation in the subcontinent. Any perceived gain in status
or ``clout'' too is a delusion. The euphoria will pass, but the
angry global reaction will continue to cause both countries serious
problems, not only international but domestic as well.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, one must recognize the validity of much of the
criticism directed at the five nuclear powers, particularly the
United States and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   After all, it has long been obvious that the Non-Proliferation
Treaty is bound to be shaky unless there is real movement toward
nuclear disarmament. Yet, of late both the United States and Russia
have been making it increasingly clear that they intend to rely for
their defense on nuclear weapons, advanced delivery systems and
anti-ballistic missiles. As was to be expected, the indefinite
extension of the Non-Proliferation Treaty failed to lock in the
status quo or to increase the treaty's credibility and
effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   We have to face the truth today: That status quo has now been
broken.
</P>
<P>
   Economic sanctions offer no solution. Indeed, as we have seen,
they can cause resentment and bitterness and make the situation
even more difficult. Nevertheless, the international community
cannot afford to ignore the contempt with which it has been treated
by New Delhi and Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
   More important, however, is to seek constructive courses of
action, primarily within the United Nations. Only a serious,
no-nonsense dialogue can persuade India and Pakistan that they must
cease the nuclear escalation and adhere to non-proliferation and
comprehensive test ban treaties.
</P>
<P>
   But the other nuclear powers too must do a lot. It can no longer
be business as usual. They must act concretely to prove that they
are serious about nuclear disarmament.
</P>
<P>
   I would also urge greater attention to the problem of nuclear
delivery systems. The United States and Russia are observing the
treaty banning intermediate and shorter-range missiles that
President Reagan and I signed in 1987. Negotiations should now
begin on enlarging this treaty to include other countries, since
missiles with a range of about 300 miles to 3,500 miles are
particularly dangerous on a regional level.
</P>
<P>
   I want to recall what happened in 1991, when the United States
and the Soviet Union agreed, on the basis of an informal
arrangement, to drastically reduce their arsenals of tactical
nuclear weapons. Similar steps today, taken unilaterally, without
engaging in protracted negotiations, would go a long way toward
normalizing the situation and persuading people that world leaders
are capable of acting to assure their security.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, I have to put the actions of India and Pakistan within
the overall context of the world's post-Cold War evolution. It has
been adversely affected by the mistaken conclusion that one side
won the Cold War and thus secured for itself the right to
unconstrained leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the intentions were, things went wrong. Over the past
years, all kinds of things have been tried _ but little or nothing
was ever done to strengthen the United Nations, or to coordinate on
a regular and systematic basis the nuclear policies of the existing
powers and seriously consult with the threshold states.
</P>
<P>
   It should now be clear that in this as in other matters, one
power center is simply not capable of being the sole decision-maker
and regulator. This is a lesson to be learned if we are to have
fewer unpleasant surprises in the future.

   EDITORS: The following identification line must be printed with
the column. Thank you.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (This commentary is adapted from a panel discussion entitled
``Democracy: Is It for Everyone,'' held at the Council on Foreign
Relations, in New York, on May 19, 1998.) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Is democracy for everyone? I think the answer is no, not yet,
but it certainly is for more people now than it used to be.
</P>
<P>
   Undoubtedly, the single-most important political phenomenon of
the late 20th century has been the expansion of democracy in
country after country around the world.
</P>
<P>
   And by democracy I refer to electoral democracies _ which I
define as a political system whose most powerful decision makers
are selected through relatively fair, honest, periodic elections,
in which candidates can freely compete and in which virtually all
the adult population is eligible to vote.
</P>
<P>
   By that definition, the number of democracies in the world has
gone up very substantially in the past few decades, from about 40
back in 1970, to 66, according to Freedom House, in 1988, to 117
now. This expansion has, in considerable measure, been worldwide;
it has affected every part of the globe.
</P>
<P>
   There is a heavy concentration of democracies, obviously, among
wealthy countries and among those who were part of, shall we say,
Western civilization. But at least one democratic regime exists in
every major civilization or culture in the world.
</P>
<P>
   What is happening to democracy as it spreads around the world? I
think it is becoming more variegated; it is taking on different
forms and acquiring different characteristics in different
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Second, democracy, as I've defined it, is simply a way of
constituting, limiting and changing governments. There is often a
tendency, however, to see it as something much more _ as, for
example, to suppose that the introduction of democracy will bring
about peace, equality, prosperity, harmony among nations and
classes and so forth.
</P>
<P>
   I don't think that is the case. For governments produced by
elections can be inefficient, corrupt, shortsighted or
discriminatory. They can pursue aggressive nationalistic policies
and pursue ruinous economic policy. Democracy is no guarantee that
other good things will happen, although they may.
</P>
<P>
   There is a tendency among people to assume that democracy won't
have unhappy consequences. However, I think we have to confront the
fact that, in this world, elections will produce results which
don't necessarily make us happy; they may produce anti-Western
governments, illiberal governments, ones that we find very
difficult to deal with _ including, when they are weak and resting
on fragile coalitions, even governments which will go off, as India
just has, and explode nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   To underline this point, I think this sort of caution,
concerning democracy, is desirable because of the widespread
assumption that, if other countries will simply democratize _ if we
can encourage them to move in that direction _ they will be
friendly and cooperate with us.
</P>
<P>
   For example, this assumption underlies the thinking of virtually
everybody on every side of the China debate. If only we could make
China democratic, the thinking goes, it would be so much more easy
to deal with. Well, perhaps it would be, but, on the other hand, it
is not difficult to conceive of a democratic China simultaneously
being a China which is highly nationalistic, in which politicians
competing for office appeal to Chinese nationalism and find it
worth their while, in terms of votes, to denounce the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   So while I am all in favor of promoting more democracies, I
think we ought to do it in a realistic way, with our eyes open.
</P>
<P>
   I don't think instituting a democratic system of government is
necessarily going to guarantee greater prosperity, greater
equality, elimination of ethnic conflict or the solution of a lot
of other social problems and ills. I do not mean that it will be
impossible for democratic governments to do that; only that there
is no guarantee.
</P>
<P>
   I think democracy is desirable for two reasons: One, it provides
order and a mechanism for incremental change, and it provides a way
of removing from office political leaders who have turned out to be
total flops.
</P>
<P>
   Two, it is also one way _ not the only way _ of protecting
liberty in a society. And I agree that violations of liberty are
less likely if you have a democratic system of elected officials
who are going to have to run for re-election.
</P>
<P>
   It is timely, of course, to consider that India is a democracy.
Yet one of the reasons why the recent nuclear explosions took
place, it seems to me, was the existence of a weak coalition
government and a minority party that obviously wants to build
popular support. Indeed, apparently _ so far, at least _ it has
been extraordinarily successful in building popular support.
</P>
<P>
   Secondly, I think it is necessary, even though India is a
democracy, to recognize that lots of things make the relations
between the United States and India very difficult.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent conference at Harvard University, where people
attended from the major countries and regions of the world, and
discussed the attitudes of their political intellectual elites
toward the international system, the use of force, and so forth,
one of the points that came through loud and clear was the seething
resentment under the surface, in large part, in many areas of the
world about the United States. We are the superpower and people
don't like that.
</P>
<P>
   This came through particularly clear in a paper prepared by a
scholar from India. He wrote of the divisions among the Indian
elites, including the Gandhians, yet concluded: ``For all Indian
elites, the United States represents the major diplomatic and
political threat. On virtually every issue of concern to India, the
U.S. has veto or mobilizational power, whether it is nuclear,
technological, economic, governmental or political matters. That
is, the United States can deny India its objectives and can rally
others to join it in punishing India.''
</P>
<P>
   Who, if any, on the globe will remain in the authoritarian camp?
Today 55 percent of the people in the world live under democratic
government, according to Dr. Gideon Rose, at the Council on Foreign
Relations. I believe that 50 years from now a larger percentage of
the world will be democratic. I would not guess exactly what
percentage or who will and won't be. But I will say there will be
some non-democratic regimes.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically perhaps, given such a pivotal role on the world
stage, the situation of democracy in the United States, I believe,
is not as good as it should be. It certainly seems to have been
more vigorous in the past.
</P>
<P>
   The major problem is the extent to which political competition
now has become increasingly competition among candidates, or
between candidates, rather than between parties, and the parties
have tended to become service organizations for candidates.
</P>
<P>
   And of course, there is the tremendous impact of television, not
just in terms of the influence on voters. Rather, the big influence
of television is the tremendous demand for money, and that's what
has made fund-raising such a central preoccupation.
</P>
<P>
   To glance through the daily newspapers, it seems that our
president now probably spends more time fund-raising for his party
than any other single activity. I don't know that any of the bills
in Congress are going to remedy that. Very probably there may have
to be some drastic action, such as provision of public funds for
campaigns, or at least for advertising on television.
</P>
<P>
   But then, democracies are not necessarily going to introduce
lots of good things. One can even think of democratic governments
that have been aggressive and that, in one way or another, have
terrorized parts of their population.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the young people of the country are inclined to wait for
the ideal world, or not wait, will depend upon, in large part, what
governments do and how governments act.
</P>
<P>
   And I don't think youth, or students in particular, are
necessarily going to be the central force for change in the coming
years _ and not necessarily a force for positive change. They may
be, but like so many other parts of the equation, that isn't at all
certain.

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   EDITORS: The following identification line must be printed with
the column. Thank you.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (This commentary is adapted from a panel discussion entitled
``Democracy: Is It for Everyone,'' held at the Council on Foreign
Relations, in New York, on May 19, 1998.) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Is democracy for everyone? I think the answer is no, not yet,
but it certainly is for more people now than it used to be.
</P>
<P>
   Undoubtedly, the single-most important political phenomenon of
the late 20th century has been the expansion of democracy in
country after country around the world.
</P>
<P>
   And by democracy I refer to electoral democracies _ which I
define as a political system whose most powerful decision makers
are selected through relatively fair, honest, periodic elections,
in which candidates can freely compete and in which virtually all
the adult population is eligible to vote.
</P>
<P>
   By that definition, the number of democracies in the world has
gone up very substantially in the past few decades, from about 40
back in 1970, to 66, according to Freedom House, in 1988, to 117
now. This expansion has, in considerable measure, been worldwide;
it has affected every part of the globe.
</P>
<P>
   There is a heavy concentration of democracies, obviously, among
wealthy countries and among those who were part of, shall we say,
Western civilization. But at least one democratic regime exists in
every major civilization or culture in the world.
</P>
<P>
   What is happening to democracy as it spreads around the world? I
think it is becoming more variegated; it is taking on different
forms and acquiring different characteristics in different
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Second, democracy, as I've defined it, is simply a way of

and pursue ruinous economic policy. Democracy is no guarantee that

Zuckerman's ``America Will Remain No. 1'' _ BC-PRO-AMERICA-IS-
TOPS. The current sense that the United States is on top of the

good years here and a few bad years elsewhere. In no sense is the
United States on the verge of crisis. But future historians will

Zuckerman's ``America Will Remain No. 1'' _ BC-PRO-AMERICA-IS-

world is based on a huge exaggeration of the implications of a few
good years here and a few bad years elsewhere. In no sense is the
United States on the verge of crisis. But future historians will

   (1,300 words) It is presumptuous to think the Asian financial
crisis foretells Asian acceptance of American ways. The Asian
economies holding up the best may be those with the most political
freedom, but the real key may be competent government. East Asia is

states on some issue or another. Why is France so difficult to deal
with? It is, quite simply, in a bad mood, unsure of its place and
status in a new world. The French are jealous of America, which
seems to run the world; afraid of globalization; and ambivalent
about European unity.

ASIAN AMERICANS GIVE FONG BOOST OVER MILLIONAIRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LANCE WILLIAMS  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A surge of crossover votes from Asian-American
Democrats may have helped state Treasurer Matt Fong edge car alarm
magnate Darrell Issa in the extraordinarily close Republican
primary for U.S. Senate, an exit poll indicated.
</P>
<P>
   Fong won the right Tuesday to challenge incumbent Democrat
Barbara Boxer in November. He won the state's first open primary,
22 percent to nearly 20 percent for Issa. The open primary allowed
Californians to cross party lines to vote for candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer won the nomination for a second term with 44 percent of
the vote.
</P>
<P>
   It was a dramatic come-from-behind victory for Fong, who was
elected treasurer in 1994. He is the son of March Fong Eu, a
Democrat who was California's secretary of state for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   An exit poll conducted by San Francisco political consultant Tom
Hsieh Jr. indicated that Asian-American voters had crossed over in
droves to vote for Fong.
</P>
<P>
   Hsieh said more than 80 percent of Asian Americans in San
Francisco voted for a Democrat in the gubernatorial primary. But
when it came to the Senate race, 76 percent of those same people
voted for Fong.
</P>
<P>
   In San Francisco, with its high concentration of Asian
Americans, Boxer won about 20 percent of Asian-American vote and
Issa got about 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Hsieh said he thought the San Francisco survey ``is going to
mirror the rest of the state.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think his (Fong's) candidacy has brought Asian Americans out
to vote,'' Hsieh said. ``... For Asian Americans, no matter what
party they're in, Matt Fong is a very credible candidate, from a
political family with great name ID.''
</P>
<P>
   If he beats Boxer in the November general election, Fong would
become the second senator of Asian descent from California. S.I.
Hayakawa served from 1976 to 1982.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer said she expected a close race in November, but she said
the general election would give voters a clear choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the only pro-choice candidate, the only pro-environment
candidate,'' she said. ``I'm the only one endorsed by the Sierra
Club and by the California Organization of Police and Sheriffs ...
so there are some major differences here.''
</P>
<P>
   Fong was outspent by more than 4-to-1 by Issa, a San Diego
electronics tycoon who spent $12.8 million of his personal fortune
on his first stab at politics.
</P>
<P>
   Issa's television commercials began appearing in July 1997,
while the cash-strapped Fong didn't take to the airwaves until
three weeks ago. Largely as a result, the San Diego millionaire led
in the polls for most of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But as the election neared, Issa was rocked by news stories
casting doubt on claims he had made about his military service, and
raising questions about an arson fire that destroyed a factory
shortly after Issa had increased his fire insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Fong hammered Issa about his background, then launched a
statewide TV blitz of his own. Fong said he knew he could never
afford to match the expensive ad campaign Issa was mounting. So he
deliberately held back until the very end.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lesson I learned in my freshman year at the Air Force
Academy,'' he said. ``Don't shoot till you see the whites of their
eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Fong said he thought Boxer was vulnerable, noting that she had
polled less than half of the votes cast.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have accused Boxer of being an out-of-touch liberal
who could be defeated by a strong Republican candidate.
</P>
<P>
   But two conservative Republicans who seemed able to make a
strong race, Reps. David Dreier and Christopher Cox, opted not to
give up powerful positions in the House of Representatives to take
on Boxer. Another high-profile Republican, University of California
Regent Ward Connerly also backed away.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans said, `We're waiting for Boxer because we're
going to go after her, she's cooked,' but there was no campaign,''
Mark Petracca, a political science professor at the University of
California at Irvine. ``It's an amazing thing, the failure of
Republicans to really mobilize.''
</P>
<P>
   They left the field to Fong, a former Air Force officer, and
Issa, a political neophyte who founded Directed Electronics Inc.,
the world's largest maker of car alarms.

HOUSTON HOSPITALS COURTING NURSES FROM AS FAR AWAY AS CANADA 

</HEADLINE>

(Attn: Ottawa) 
 
By MARY SIT-DuVALL 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ A month before 32-year-old Lisabeth McCall graduated
from nursing school, she already had her first choice of jobs.
</P>
<P>
   McCall, who received a bachelor of science degree from Houston
Baptist University College of Nursing nearly two weeks ago, says
she and all her classmates were inundated with offers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would get letters, at least three a week from hospitals.
Please come to our job fair, we have excellent job opportunities. I
got everything from hospitals to prison systems,'' recalls McCall.
``It was awesome. I knew what I wanted, and I could just get what I
wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   McCall starts a new job Monday at M.D. Anderson Hospital in
Houston, specializing in gynecological care. She'll be making
$30,600 as her base salary, but hopes to earn $40,000 with overtime
pay and night shifts.
</P>
<P>
   McCall's experience isn't unique. Houston hospitals, in the
midst of a nationwide nursing shortage, are jostling to hire new
graduates and court nurses from other hospitals, enticing them with
sign-on bonuses and specialized, hands-on training courses.
Recruiters are even flying to Canada to convince northern neighbors
to settle in the Sun Belt.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts and other observers say the current shortage reflects
several factors: a typical supply-and-demand cycle, a declining
enrollment in nursing school and a broader array of career choices
as the health care field undergoes changes.
</P>
<P>
   And some are warning that unless educators develop a formal
system of identifying and training future nurses, the current
shortage will explode into a crisis in 20 years as middle-aged
nurses retire, just when aging baby boomers require more health
care.
</P>
<P>
   If a hospital has a higher than 7 percent vacancy rate in
positions available for registered nurses, the shortage is
considered a serious one, according to The American Hospital
Association, the largest trade group representing hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Houston hospitals are already grappling with a higher than 7
percent vacancy rate.
</P>
<P>
   At Houston's largest hospital chain, Columbia/HCA's 16 hospitals
have an average 10 percent vacancy rate. Hermann Hospital has an 8
percent vacancy rate. Texas Children's Hospital has a 12 to 15
percent vacancy rate with an annual average of 8 to 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The shortage of nurses varies according to specialty.
</P>
<P>
   Critical care nurses and operating nurses are in limited supply,
and there's also a need for home health care nurses as managed care
companies enforce shorter hospital stays and send patients home as
soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's definitely a shortage of experienced nurses,'' says
Patti Stone, senior recruiter of employment at Methodist Health
Care System. ``It cuts across the board. We can get as many new
grads as we want. The problem is most of the hospitals won't hire
new grads straight onto the units because they need to go through a
training program first.''
</P>
<P>
   To entice graduates to choose their hospital and to give them
more practical training, hospitals have started internship programs
or work-study programs for soon-to-graduate nurses.
</P>
<P>
   After its merger with the Memorial hospitals six months ago,
Hermann developed systemwide internships, offering three-month
internships in seven clinical areas, says Kathy Walsh, chief
nursing officer and vice president of operations for Hermann.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really pooled our strengths to attack the nursing shortage
as a system,'' says Walsh. ``All the nurse executives meet monthly.
And this is one of the things we talk about first and foremost.''
</P>
<P>
   Tenet Healthcare Corp., Houston's second-largest hospital system
with Northwest Medical Center and Park Plaza, started a six-week
internship program in January for graduates and a preceptor program
that matches new hires with experienced registered nurses who can
function as mentors.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to offering specialized training programs, hospitals
are resorting to more aggressive recruiting techniques to entice
nurses. Sign-on bonuses of $2,000 to $3,000 are becoming
commonplace.
</P>
<P>
   Hospitals are conducting ``one-stop shopping'' job fairs where
nurses can drop off a resume, be interviewed by a hiring manager _
and walk away with a job offer all on the same day. They are
sending mass mailings to local nurses working at other hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   One hospital is enticing new hires with computers and trips to
Disney World.
</P>
<P>
   The competition for nurses has driven up salaries, which have
doubled in the past eight years. Starting salaries range from $14 a
hour for graduates to $30 an hour for nurse managers or those with
five years' experience. A year ago, starting salaries were $12.50
to $13 an hour. The average nursing salary in Houston is $20 an
hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's such a price war going on in Houston,'' says Mary Ann
Euliarte, chief nursing officer at Spring Branch Medical Center.
``We're seeing the specialty centers offering higher salaries to
recruit away. That's been going on for the last six months.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(MORE) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Euliarte says she hired about 100 Canadian nurses for Columbia's
16 Houston hospitals in the past seven years. Her most recent trip
was six weeks ago when she offered jobs to 23 nurses. She's
received 17 commitments so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't had that much difficulty,'' says Euliarte. ``They
obviously need to work and are happy there are job opportunities
and are able to get work permits to come here.''
</P>
<P>
   Take, for example, Tanie Whitby, a 27-year-old nurse who moved
to Houston from Ottawa two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The floor I was working on was closing. I was working on-call.
I would have had to get several jobs working part time,'' says
Whitby, who just completed a three-month internship in the surgical
intensive care unit at Spring Branch Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Votour, 38, a registered nurse at Methodist, also moved to
Houston from Ottawa.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was an advertisement in The Ottawa Citizen. I had an
interview in Toronto a month later, and three months later was in
Houston,'' says Votour, who has nine years' experience. ``The
opportunities here are endless.''
</P>
<P>
   But those myriad opportunities _ prompted by a shift from
physician-controlled health care delivery to managed care companies
in charge _ are partially what's triggering the current nursing
shortage, say analysts.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of dynamics being created that make market
opportunities for nurses _ in nursing homes, hospices, day/night
programs, HMOs, PPOs, corporate-sponsored wellness programs. All
these create fertile opportunities for nurses,'' says Art
Dickerson, a health care consultant at William M. Mercer, a human
resources consulting firm specializing in health care, retirement,
compensation and benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The current shortage cycle began about four years ago when
hospitals nationwide downsized, shrinking nursing staffs to pare
expenses. But the cost-cutting measure backfired in many cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (the hospitals) had more problems,'' says Carolyn
Gunning, dean of the College of Nursing at Texas Women's University
at the Texas Medical Center. ``Patients were more dissatisfied and
not choosing to go back to those hospitals. There were more
infections and longer stays.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Patricia Starck, professor and dean of the University of
Texas Health Science Center at Houston: ``When you downsize
professional nursing staff, very likely you will see complication
rates go up that eat into the bottom line.''
</P>
<P>
   Just how badly is the current nursing shortage affecting the
care patients are receiving? Hospitals insist they are making up
for the shortfall with temporary ``fill-in'' nurses.
</P>
<P>
   Hermann Hospital, for example, has a float pool staff of travel
nurses who work three-month assignments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Definitely, patient care gets affected, but I don't think it's
to the point where the patient is left alone without care,'' says
V. Kumar, professor of marketing at the University of Houston.
``Hospitals won't let that happen. They make the nurses work more
shifts, but they won't let patients' health be in jeopardy.''
</P>
<P>
   But nurses admit their days are hectic and the pace fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like sometimes I can't give as good as quality care as
I would like to,'' says Cynthia Hart, 38, a Houston-area pediatric
and surgical nurse with 19 years' experience. ``Sometimes I feel
like the doctors will walk in and do what they have to do and
finish and be gone and ready for the next patient, and I'm still
trying to finish up with the first one.''
</P>
<P>
   Industry observers don't see a quick fix to the current
shortage.
</P>
<P>
   The average age of nurses nationwide is 44; only 9 percent of
all nurses are below age 30, according to American Association of
Colleges of Nursing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all concerned about the graying of nurses,'' says
Starck. ``For faculty, the average age is 50. We're concerned about
who's going to be around to teach.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, hospitals are scrambling for creative ways to
keep the nurses they do have.
</P>
<P>
   Since there are not many areas where nurses can advance,
hospitals are offering continuing education courses _ complete with
tuition reimbursement _ so nurses can learn new specialities and
move around to pre-empt boredom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other than the monetary thing, what is exciting to nurses is
an opportunity to learn,'' says UH's Kumar. ``It's important they
are recognized and trained. Science is becoming more complex, and
therefore a need for more trained nurses.''
</P>
<P>
   The health care field, which suffers from one of the highest
turnovers of all industries, must learn new ways to reward
employees, says Dickerson of William M. Mercer.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do employees value?'' Dickerson says. ``Different things
are important to different demographics. Couples over 40 with no
kids are focusing on how to save for retirement. Couples under 40
and not married want more time off, more flexible schedules, casual
work dress. Companies are trying to get people what they value, and
not just say, `We know what's best.'''

   PARIS _ Tourists coming to France, like armies, march on their
stomachs.
</P>
<P>
   So during the next couple of months, the great rush will be on
to the renowned restaurants of Paris and the provinces by visitors
armed with the latest editions of gastronomic guides reporting on
which chefs are up, which are displaying less genius than in the
past and which are the newcomers to watch.
</P>
<P>
   Some Americans I know spend all their time in France doing
little but having lunch and dinner at famous and breathtakingly
expensive eating places. Their real thrill isn't the food itself
but their anticipation of telling their envious friends at home
about the experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife would sooner die than admit to her friends that we
hadn't been able to get a table at the most talked-about Paris
restaurant of the moment,'' an American businessman confesses.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, a pal of mine has avoided France for years
because he says he is intimated by the fact that, not being that
interested in eating as an art form, he knows little about the
finer points of gastronomy compared with the average French person.
``I felt embarrassed dining in a top French restaurant, so I
stopped,'' he explains.
</P>
<P>
   There's a lot of myth involved in France's fabled cuisine. It
may come as a shock, but the fact is that the famous restaurants
these days depend almost exclusively on foreign customers,
especially Americans. If they relied on natives, they would go
broke _ as several of them have done in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Few French people can afford the likes of Alain Ducasse (around
$250 a head) or Taillevent (more than $200). Even fewer of the
French would spend that much in a restaurant assuming they could.
</P>
<P>
   The bleak truth is that in the past 20 years or so, this has
become largely a country of fast-food eateries, carryouts and
sandwich bars.
</P>
<P>
   According to sociologist Claude Alencon of the University of
Paris, ``The French have defiantly turned away from the obsession
with good food that was characteristic of previous generations. The
young in particular regard serious interest in food as
old-fashioned, even archaic.''
</P>
<P>
   Many young French women proudly proclaim their inability to boil
water. Their male companions claim to prefer Burger King to the
Tour d'Argent, cost aside.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, while American visitors reserve tables at L'Arpege
or Grand Vefour even before they reserve their hotel rooms, the
French view their own lack of concern about what they eat as
typically American and therefore enviably modern.
</P>
<P>
   ``Interest in good food has declined to the point that within a
few years France will have only about 30 or 40 luxury
restaurants,'' predicts cultural historian Alain Lemoine. ``The
remainder will be fast-food places and inexpensive Asian
restaurants. Talented French chefs will be forced to emigrate in
order to pursue their profession.''

CALIFORNIA'S $64 MILLION RACE AN EMBARRASSMENT OF RICHES 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ California to millionaire candidates: You can't
buy us.
</P>
<P>
   Well, you can buy us, but you have to do it the old-fashioned
way, the Gray Davis way, with rubber-chicken dinners, pressed flesh
and contributions from big-money interests other than yourself.
</P>
<P>
   The whole world is watching, and this has been a real
embarrassment for California. Four candidates for governor spent at
least $64 million on a primary election few voters cared about.
(Never mind car-alarm magnate Darrell Issa dumping nearly $13
million of his own dough into a failed effort to become a senator.)
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-four million. That's $64 million. No matter how you write
it, or how you say it, it's an astonishing figure. Make that
obscene.
</P>
<P>
   For that dough, the candidates who professed to care so much
about schools could have bought more than 3 million books for
California school libraries.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Gavin, who buys books for the San Francisco Unified School
District, said the average library book costs $20, and each school
gets only $600 a year.
</P>
<P>
   After contemplating the primary spending, she said, ``I remember
the teachers who had an impact on me. I don't remember who was
governor.''
</P>
<P>
   No one will remember the also-rans in this race, that's for
sure. Sorry, Al Checchi, who was seeking the Democratic nomination
for governor. You shouldn't have promised just to run once. This is
politics, land of few instant gratifications.
</P>
<P>
   The problem in this election was that when a candidate spends
gobs of his own money on himself, he is his own leading
constituency. And he has a fool for a constituency.
</P>
<P>
   Money isn't just filthy lucre that talks too loudly. It
represents a transaction and a commitment. Spending only your own
money, as Checchi did with nearly $40 million, is an egotistical
act, not a political act.
</P>
<P>
   You should have taken some contributions and gotten out a little
among the people, Al. We used to call it campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   Those are the lessons of this primary election. The lessons of
California elections change every four years, and the political
consultants are always fighting the last war.
</P>
<P>
   California to consultants: We are not complete television
victims.
</P>
<P>
   All your lousy ads do is keep us away from the polls, or turn us
against your candidate. Those ads stunk. Not just because they were
negative. I'd rather watch the worst Snapple ads.
</P>
<P>
   If that $64 million primary had been a movie, it would have
closed the first weekend.
</P>
<P>
   California to the East Coast: We're not so weird. OK, we are.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, we've had four gubernatorial candidates, ranging from
unknown to bland, do expensive, vacuous battle on TV. But now we're
into an old-fashioned, liberal-conservative battle between Davis,
the lieutenant governor and now the Democratic nominee, and Dan
Lungren, the Republican attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, they're already scrambling for the middle. It's decaf
Jerry Brown vs. Nixon Lite.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the main charge that Lungren will level against Davis is
right across the San Francisco Bay, heading for the office of mayor
of Oakland. Former Gov. Jerry Brown does have an unusual career
path. He may yet end up on a school board somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   But lo, outside of Jerry Brown's headquarters was something
rarely seen this year, a rally. Sure, it was a small one, but it
had bands and barbecue.
</P>
<P>
   Remember rallies?
</P>
<P>
   In San Francisco, all politics is personal. That was what was
missing in the governor's race. Even when Checchi got personal
against Rep. Jane Harman, another Democratic candidate for
governor, it was in those dreary, impersonal ads.
</P>
<P>
   Huge egos drive multimillionaires to try to spend their way into
office, so it isn't likely that huge defeats like Checchi's will
stop them. The Supreme Court said spending your own money on
campaigns is ``free speech,'' thus millionaires are free to shout.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign reform, forget it. At some point television, which uses
public airwaves, must provide free air time for candidates. Most
local stations don't cover politics, thus forcing candidates to buy
ads between the freeway chases.
</P>
<P>
   What's a non-jillionaire to do? Sen. Barbara Boxer, a Democrat,
hopes to hold 1,000 house parties before the election is over, each
raising perhaps $1,000. She calls it ``1,000 Points of Loot,'' but
it's about more than loot, and the loot will be worth more than if
she wrote a check to herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find people are so happy to do something and get together
and talk,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe they'll talk about some of the things that could have been
bought with the $64 million that went down the tubes, on the tube,
over the last few months.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates could have bought music programs for 574 schools,
including music teachers and instruments for a 40-piece band.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates could have funded 17 charter schools like the
Garfield School in Menlo Park, which has a yearly budget of $3.6
million for 645 kids.
</P>
<P>
   Well, none of them would have done that. But they could have
saved California the embarrassment of their own riches.

HOUSTON PORT GETS BOOST FROM NEW BEETLE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Attn: Calif., Del., Ga., Mass. and Mich.) 
 
By JENALIA MORENO 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ German Beetles have invaded the country, and Port of
Houston Authority officials are counting their profits.
</P>
<P>
   The Port of Houston was chosen as one of the five ports of entry
in the nation for Volkswagen's New Beetle, &UR;  &LR; all of which are made
in the company's plant in Puebla, just southeast of Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   The other ports of entry for the Beetles include Boston;
Brunswick, Ga.; San Diego and Wilmington, Del. &UR;  &LR; But Houston's Port
gets the bulk of the Beetles.
</P>
<P>
   More than a third of the 50,000 Beetles sent to the United
States in this first year of its production are imported through
Houston because of its proximity to Mexico and other markets in the
Southwest. From Houston, the vehicles are taken by truck or train
to dealerships throughout the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a central location for a lot of the dealerships in the
country,'' said Tony Fouladpour, spokesman for Volkswagen of
America in Auburn Hills, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   Beetles aren't the only Volkswagen products pouring through the
Port. A third of all vehicles made in Volkswagen's plants in
Germany and Mexico also enter the country here.
</P>
<P>
   In 1968, Volkswagen of America leased a 16-acre lot from the
Port and has since unloaded its Passats, Jettas, old Beetles and
its luxury vehicle, the Audi, on Houston docks. The old Beetle is
no longer sold in the United States, though it is still produced in
Puebla and sold in Latin American countries.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the company leases 70 acres near the Turning Basin and
for the past four months that lot has been filled with Beetles.
Motorists driving over a nearby bridge can see rows and rows of
colorful white, red, yellow, green or blue Beetles.
</P>
<P>
   Imports have not slowed despite a recall of the popular vehicle
last month. Volkswagen voluntarily recalled 10,100 Beetles in the
United States and Canada because of of an electrical wiring
problem.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those repairs have been made at the company's Puebla
plant or its dealerships, and a small percentage were made at the
five U.S. ports of entry.
</P>
<P>
   The Port has benefited from the popularity of Volkswagen's New
Beetle, helping to nearly double its automobile imports for the
first four months of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Auto imports at the Port increased to 19,742 for the first four
months of 1998, compared with 10,208 for the same period last year.
More than a third of those imported vehicles have been the
New &UR;  &LR; Beetle. The Port also receives a few other brands of vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Volkswagen imports 7,500 of its Jettas, Audis, Beetles
and other vehicles in its line a month by ship or rail to its
facility at the Port.
</P>
<P>
   At this pace, Port Operations Director John Scardasis expects
revenues from automobile imports to reach $300,000 by year's end.
That's only a small percentage of the $83 million in revenues the
Port earned last year, but double the amount it earned in 1997 from
imports.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Port assesses higher wharfage fees for more
expensive commodities, the auto importing business is a profitable
one for both the Port Authority and the longshoremen who unload the
ships.
</P>
<P>
   Depending upon the size of the vessel that carries the vehicles,
the Port earns more than $9,000 for every 1,000 cars unloaded on
the waterfront.
</P>
<P>
   Port officials expected the Volkswagen's Beetles to be brought
to the Port from Puebla by rail, but were surprised when most were
shipped here from the Mexican port city of Veracruz.
</P>
<P>
   For the last few years, Volkswagen officials have preferred to
transport their vehicles from Mexico by ship instead of rail.
</P>
<P>
   ``We decided to go with shipping because of the rail problems in
the U.S.,'' Fouladpour said. ``There is a lack of supply of rail
cars and a record of substandard performance.''
</P>
<P>
   For longshoremen, the increased auto imports also have meant
more work with less manual labor compared to lifting bagged goods
or heavy cargo.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've gotta lift the keys and that's all you gotta lift,''
quipped longshoreman Patrick Davis as he drove Audis and Passats
off the Automobil Ace vessel, which had just docked from Germany.

   UNIONS-IMPACT _ WASHINGTON _ Pro-reform forces in Congress were
strengthened when Californians defeated Proposition 226, which was
designed to require unions to get individual union members'
permission before using union dues for political campaigns. Union
leaders rejoiced and business leaders seemed resigned in the wake
of the measure's defeat. Similar amendments on reform bills now are
less likely when the House resumes its debate on campaign finance
laws this week. And the argument by reformers that any limits must
apply equally to both corporations and unions gained strength.

   CHURCH-MOLESTERS _ Alarmed by epidemic increases in reports of

moved to deal with the problem. The 300-member Council of Catholic
Bishops created the Ad Hoc Communicate on Sexual Abuse, a committee
chaired by Bishop John Kinney of Bismarck, N.D. Its mission was to
restore faith in the priesthood. The swift removal of Bishop J.

   REAGAN-TURNPIKE _ TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ A new state law now in

Turnpike. But the bill's sponsors and turnpike officials are not
interpreting it as a true name change, and are not revising any
maps, stationery or existing signs. The result has been confusion

WHEN A BANK MOVES IN, SOME BROKERS MAY MOVE OUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BRUCE RAMSEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The stockbroker on the phone had a familiar name. I had written
about him 16 years before, when he left Foster &AMP; Marshall Inc.,
then Seattle's largest brokerage firm. The story then was that the
firm had been sold, and this broker didn't like the new owner. It
was the same story now: firm changes hands, broker walks. Piper
Jaffray Inc., his employer for 16 years, had been bought by the
holding company for U.S. Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Banks, he said, are driven to cut costs, and in his business
that comes down to cutting commissions. ``They say they're not,''
he said, but he didn't believe it. He said, ``What brokers want is
a home; what they don't want is a bank.''
</P>
<P>
   He went to work for D.A. Davidson &AMP; Co., a much smaller firm
than Piper, based in Great Falls, Mont. Davidson, founded in 1935,
has been in Seattle for just 14 months. Its operation here is
headed by Bob Magnuson, the former regional managing director of
Piper. Magnuson left, too. At Piper, Magnuson directed 165 brokers
in Washington, and more in other states. These brokers are the
cherries among which he is trying to pick.
</P>
<P>
   All businesses say employees are their No. 1 asset, but in stock
brokerage it is more true than most. The best brokers will take 90
percent or more of their customers with them; less stellar
performers, 50 to 70 percent, Magnuson says. For joining a new
firm, top brokers can sometimes get up-front payments of 45 to 50
percent of a year's gross. Their old firms can attempt to tie them
with offers of stock.
</P>
<P>
   Brokers are enticed not only by a package but by a philosophy,
which implies how they will be treated in the future. Magnuson's is
the old-time religion of the customer's man. He is suspicious of
moves to replace commissions with fees. Fees have the smell of
banks; fees undercut the broker and, he argues, do not benefit the
client. To his chagrin, the brokerage industry has added
transaction fees ($5 per trade at Piper, $3.25 at Davidson), and in
some firms, a $50 fee for closing an account.
</P>
<P>
   Magnuson is worried, too, about the tie-ins that come with being
owned by a bank. Banks will have more in-house investment products,
and they will want their brokers to sell them, he says. He recalls
some disasters over the years from such products _ stock in WTD
Industries and Bonneville Pacific, for example. With an in-house
deal, he says, the broker is biased: ``The payout is higher.''
</P>
<P>
   He thus makes a virtue of Davidson's limitations. While the
Montana firm has some capability to underwrite, it is much smaller
than that of Piper, which just underwrote a $975 million issue of
paper from the Los Angeles Unified School District.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, he questions the confidentiality of personal
information in a big company. Piper clients were recently notified
that their financial records would be made available to U.S. Bank
unless they asked that records remain private.
</P>
<P>
   Piper Jaffray, as might be expected, views it all differently.
Take the letter about sharing records. Ross Rogers, director of
individual investor services at the headquarters in Minneapolis,
says, ``We are all one company here. We did give clients an
opportunity to say no, but those individuals do shortchange
themselves somewhat. Our goal here is to meet their needs.''
Perhaps the client would appreciate a consultation from the bank's
trust department, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers says in-house products increase customer choice, and that
brokers are not given a higher payout on them.
</P>
<P>
   Piper does offer fee-based accounts, though less than 10 percent
of customers choose them. Most prefer the customary commission
account. And as for the idea that U.S. Bank will squeeze these
commissions to cut costs, Rogers says, ``That's one of the old
myths that floats. When U.S. Bank bought Piper Jaffray, they bought
it with the full knowledge of how we're compensated.'' Compensation
might change, he said, ``but not on the basis of that argument.''
</P>
<P>
   Says James McColley, Piper's director for Washington state,
``Change is difficult for some people, and they long to do business
the way it was done 10 years ago. We're looking forward.''
</P>
<P>
   With the consolidations now under way in banking and investments
_ with Smith Barney, Salomon and Travelers all becoming sister
companies of Citibank, for example _ these questions are guaranteed
to come up a lot. What do terms like ``financial supermarket''
mean? When you go to a supermarket, they often don't even know your
name. Here, they know how much money you have.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution will come not from what managers say but by what
brokers and customers do. Each side will be motivated partly by
money, but also by a level of comfort. Investment is a business
where not all values are financial.
</P>

   THREE GORGES DAM, China _ Here are some key facts about the dam
for purposes of making maps and graphics. In addition, several
diagrams of the dam itself are available for faxing:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE CONSTRUCTION PROJECT: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   - Excavation: 102.6 million cubic meters of earth and stone (134
million cubic yards).
</P>
<P>
   - Concrete: 27.2 million cubic meters (35.5 million cubic
yards).
</P>
<P>
   - Steel reinforcing bars: 354,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
   - Dam height: 185 meters (607 feet).
</P>
<P>
   - Dam length: 2,309 meters (1.4 miles) divided into three parts.
In the center will be a 484-meter spillway section with 23 bottom
outlets and 22 sluice gates. On the left and right of the spillway
will be two giant power stations (see below).
</P>
<P>
   - Timing: Phase 1 began in 1994 and ended in 1997 with the
initial diversion of the Yangtze River. Phase 2 began in 1998 and
is due to end in 2003 when the water level rises to 156 meters (511
feet) and the dam starts generating electricity. Phase 3 should end
in 2009 when the water level reaches 175 meters (574 feet) and full
power generation begins.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE DOWNSIDE CONSEQUENCES: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   - Water pollution in the dammed Yangtze will double _ at least _
as the dam traps more than 50 types of pollutants from mines,
factories and human settlements that were formerly flushed out to
sea by the swift Yangtze currents.
</P>
<P>
   - About 1,300 archaeological sites will be moved or flooded.
</P>
<P>
   - Critics contend that the heavy silt in the river will form
thick deposits near the upstream end of the dam, clogging the major
river channels of the city of Chongqing.
</P>
<P>
   - Facing Inundation: 632 square kilometers (244 square miles),
19 cities, 326 villages, including 27,000 hectares (66,700 acres)
of farms and orchards.
</P>
<P>
   - Facing resettlement: 1.1 million to 1.9 million people.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE FUTURE RESERVOIR: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   - Average width: 1.1 kilometers (0.7 miles).
</P>
<P>
   - Length: 600 kilometers (370 miles).
</P>
<P>
   - Storage: 39.3 billion cubic meters of water (51.4 billion
cubic yards).
</P>
<P>
   - Water level: elevated 175 meters (574 feet) above Yangtze
River surface.
</P>
<P>
   - Runoff: 451 billion cubic meters (589 billion cubic yards) of
Yangtze River water will flow into the reservoir annually.
</P>
<P>
   - Silt: The muddy Yangtze will discharge 530 million tons of
silt into the reservoir in a typical year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE ELECTRICITY: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   - Machinery: The two power stations flanking the dam's central
spillway will operate 26 of the world's largest turbine generators,
700 megawatts each.
</P>
<P>
   - Capacity: Total generating capacity will be 18,200 megawatts,
or as much as big 18 nuclear power stations.
</P>
<P>
   - Transmission: Fifteen 500,000-volt transmission lines will
send electricity to Shanghai and elsewhere throughout East China,
Central China and eastern Sichuan Province.
</P>
<P>
   - Output: 84.7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity annually,
equivalent to burning 40 million tons of coal.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE SHIPPING: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   - Ship lock will consist of five locks, each 280 meters (918
feet) long and 35 meters (114 feet) wide, with a water depth of 5
meters (16.4 feet). Supposed to handle 10,000 ton barges.
</P>
<P>
   - Ship lift will be a one-stage vertical lift capable of
carrying a 3,000-ton passenger or cargo vessel.
</P>
<P>
   - River shipping through central Yangtze estimated to increase
from 10 million to 50 million tons annually, with transportation
costs cut by 30-37 percent.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE FLOOD CONTROL: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   - Dam sponsors say the reservoir's 22.1 billion cubic meter
(28.9 billion cubic yards) flood control storage capacity should
lessen the frequency of big downstream floods from once every 10
years to once every 100 years.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE RANKINGS OF WORLD'S TEN LARGEST HYDROELECTRIC PROJECTS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   (in megawatts of installed generating capacity)
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE BOTTOM LINE (THREE GORGES COSTS INCLUDING INTEREST AND
INFLATION): &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Latest official estimate: 203.9 billion Chinese yuan ($25
billion)
</P>

factories and human settlements that were formerly flushed out to
sea by the swift Yangtze currents.
</P>
<P>
   - About 1,300 archaeological sites will be moved or flooded.
</P>
<P>
   - Critics contend that the heavy silt in the river will form
thick deposits near the upstream end of the dam, clogging the major
river channels of the city of Chongqing.
</P>
<P>
   - Facing Inundation: 632 square kilometers (244 square miles),
19 cities, 326 villages, including 27,000 hectares (66,700 acres)
of farms and orchards.
</P>
<P>
   - Facing resettlement: 1.1 million to 1.9 million people.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE FUTURE RESERVOIR: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   - Average width: 1.1 kilometers (0.7 miles).
</P>
<P>
   - Length: 600 kilometers (370 miles).
</P>
<P>
   - Storage: 39.3 billion cubic meters of water (51.4 billion
cubic yards).
</P>
<P>

silt into the reservoir in a typical year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE ELECTRICITY: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   - Machinery: The two power stations flanking the dam's central
spillway will operate 26 of the world's largest turbine generators,
700 megawatts each.
</P>
<P>
   - Capacity: Total generating capacity will be 18,200 megawatts,
or as much as big 18 nuclear power stations.
</P>
<P>

   BADONG, China _ In their spick-and-span, open-front shop, a
patient Chinese couple sat on a humid afternoon waiting for their
future to happen.
</P>
<P>
   Their one-room storefront was new, brimming with sundries from
shampoo to socks. Their street was new. Their five-story building
perched on the hillside was new. In fact, the entire block of
mostly vacant shops and apartments was entertaining the finishing
touches of construction.
</P>
<P>
   The problem for Li Damin and his wife was that no cars travelled
the street, no people strolled past to eye their wares.
</P>
<P>
   Few others had moved in yet from the old town's shabby
riverfront that in five years will disappear under muddy water,
once the Three Gorges Dam bottles up the mighty Yangtze River and
turns 370 miles of churning energy into a calm reservoir.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were in the first stage of resettlement,'' Li, 45, placidly
acknowledged. By the time the next stage is finished in four years,
the couple should have plenty of customers in the new city,
assuming they can pay the monthly $43 rent that long.
</P>
<P>
   For now they are isolated here, their lifeline to the old town a
pocked and muddy road winding across steep hillsides.
</P>
<P>
   The new heights of Badong are China's resettlement at its best,
where the government brings visitors to sample its handling of
perhaps the most controversial facet of the immense dam project
that will uproot between 1.1 million and 1.9 million Chinese
people.
</P>
<P>
   When the dam is finished in 2003, the Yangtze waters will begin
a climb of 175 meters _ nearly 575 feet _ inundating 66,700 acres
of farms and orchards, 657 factories and mines, 19 cities and 326
villages.
</P>
<P>
   The government promises that change spurred by the dam will
create a fresh new life, most importantly a life safe from floods
for 15 million people downstream, but also one flourishing with new
economic potential.
</P>
<P>
   ``The construction of the dam has brought a rare opportunity for
the opening of the region, for the changing of thoughts and
liberation of minds,'' said Chen Gong, an earnest, 34-year-old
economic development official interviewed in the Hubei Province
capital of Wuhan, a two-day float downstream.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have realized the aim of being able to remove, to resettle
and to become rich,'' he said, describing the early resettlement as
going perfectly.
</P>
<P>
   On the opposing side, critics in China and abroad warn the
process is becoming a sociological nightmare in which funds are
squandered, resettlements botched and families ruthlessly cut from
generational moorings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Official statements give the impression that resettlement is
proceeding smoothly, but in reality it has been plagued by
mismanagement, official corruption, inadequate compensation, a
shortage of farmland and lack of jobs for the resettlers,'' said a
Chinese sociologist who wrote under the pseudonym Wu Ming
(``nameless''), in a study this spring for the U.S.-based groups
International Rivers Network and Human Rights in China.
</P>
<P>
   Many Chinese river people have nice things to say about this
project the government so strongly endorses, but some signs of
unrest have appeared.
</P>
<P>
   Cox News Service interviews found feelings running strong in
Fengdu, population 40,000, where residents confided that agitated
workers recently took to the streets in protest. Their food
processing factory was sold, probably for scrap, and they received
no compensation to tide them over till finding jobs in the new town
being built on a higher bank across the river.
</P>
<P>
   It is troubling to imagine everything underwater in the lively
little city full of stores and homes, its streets crowded with
shoppers and vendors carrying loads of vegetables on shoulder poles
or hawking smoked pork bellies from corner stands. The
flower-filled park and shrine to Tianzi, known as King of the Dead,
will be lost with the rest.
</P>
<P>
   Even an official guide was unexpectedly candid about emotions in
Fengdu, as she led cruise ship tourists through the ancient city's
sites last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``The older people don't want to leave. It's also hard for the
people aged 40 or 50,'' said Zheng Manman, 22. ``Younger people
don't mind because the city will be bigger. There will be new
opportunities for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Middle-aged workers, as throughout China, already are losing
jobs as economic reform shuts down old, inefficient enterprises,
she said. But in these low-lying waterfront towns every single old
factory will be closed. Resettlement plans envision modern industry
and business for which these mountain people lack skills.
</P>
<P>
   Zheng personally is stymied at how to save the 30,000 yuan, more
than $3,700, she said she will need within five years for the new
apartment she must buy in the new city.
</P>
<P>
   Even if she earned a monthly salary as high as 600 yuan _ a lot
in a Chinese country town _ her entire earnings in five years would
come to only 36,000 yuan, or about $4,460. The government would
sell her the apartment well below its construction cost. Even so,
buying it would leave Zheng with only $760 to support herself for
the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   In Badong, the merchant Li borrowed from a bank, from friends
and from family to purchase the couple's 30,000-yuan apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow they will have to pay that back. But they live in a
bigger, nicer space now. And they are better off than Xiong
Changlin, who was down on the waterfront wielding sizzling pans in
his grime-covered cafe on a recent morning.
</P>
<P>
   Xiong, 41, said he will be glad enough to move with the second
wave of resettlers, though he doesn't know exactly how he will live
in the sparkling new hilltop town. He doesn't have a shop or cafe,
or any job at all up there.
</P>
<P>
   He wouldn't comment any further on the dam and resettling
process.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have some ideas of my own,'' he said cryptically, ``but
since it's the project of the state, I have to support it.''

CALIFORNIA VOTERS STRIKE DOWN BILINGUAL EDUCATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CAROL NESS  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Californians voted decisively to replace
bilingual education with one-year English immersion classes,
approving a ballot initiative that was being watched nationally by
proponents and critics of special programs for students who lack
proficiency in English.
</P>
<P>
   With nearly all votes in Wednesday, the margin was 61 percent
for Proposition 227 and 39 percent against.
</P>
<P>
   Just as they did in 1994 with Proposition 187, which denied
education and medical care for undocumented immigrants, and the
anti-affirmative action Proposition 209 in 1996, the losers in
Tuesday's vote are asking the court to block the initiative from
taking effect this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't intend to sink or swim,'' San Francisco school
Superintendent Bill Rojas told a spirited crowd of Proposition 227
opponents Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``The `lucha' has just begun,'' he added, using the Spanish word
for struggle.
</P>
<P>
   Six civil rights groups said they would go to federal court to
block Proposition 227, Rojas said, adding that the San Francisco
school district would support the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Rojas also said the San Francisco schools would not abide by the
initiative.
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles, an ecstatic Ron Unz, the Palo Alto software
entrepreneur who got the measure on the ballot using $500,000 of
his own money, said the outcome proved that California voters
agreed with him that bilingual education was not best for immigrant
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were outspent by about 20-to-1 on advertising, but we had
the people of California on our side because they believe the
simple truth _ that children should be taught English when they go
to school and be taught English as quickly as possible,'' Unz said
in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a tremendous victory for the people of California and
for immigrant parents in California,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The vote drew national attention because California's
increasingly multiracial population is seen as the face of the
country to come. Ten other states require bilingual education, and
others offer it. As with its bold moves against undocumented
immigrants and affirmative action, California's vote is expected to
strengthen opposition to bilingual education elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   While Proposition 187 was ultimately thrown out in federal
court, Proposition 209 was ruled constitutional in a case that went
all the way to the Supreme Court. It took effect last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will follow the same course,'' Rojas said of the
anti-biligual education measure.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature will be another line of attack, Rojas said.
While Gov. Pete Wilson supported Proposition 227, both candidates
to replace him _ Democrat Gray Davis and Republican Dan Lungren _
opposed the initiative. The Legislature could overturn Proposition
227 with a two-thirds vote.

<P>
   THREE GORGES DAM, China _ Every day 18,000 Chinese mobilize to
build the most powerful _ and most disparaged _ hydro-electric dam
in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Each day they crunch more rocks, dig deeper pits, pour more and
more concrete for the edifice that within five years will stretch
1.4 miles across the Yangtze River and create a mammoth reservoir
370 miles long.
</P>
<P>
   With swells of national pride, some Chinese call this dam the
modern Great Wall.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not a place that politically cautious visitors like
President Clinton _ soon due to spend nine days in China _ will
come and admire as a new national icon. For the dam is suffused in
controversy as thick as the river mists that enfold construction
cranes angling high over the Yangtze.
</P>
<P>
   These workers and thousands more still to come will reconfigure
not just this site, but will flood the mystically beautiful Three
Gorges canyons that have inspired Chinese poets for centuries. And
they will trigger the eviction of more than one million Chinese who
fish and farm and trade along the river that carries their
livelihood and sometimes their destruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``China is still a poor country,'' Lu Youmei, general manager of
the China Three Gorges Project Corp., told Cox News Service
recently. ``To catch up to modern conditions in developed
countries, we may need half a century or even a century. The
Chinese have many things to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Lu is convinced the state-constructed hydroelectric dam will
boost China in its run toward modernity, producing electric power
equivalent to the output of 18 nuclear plants, diminishing the
deadly threat of floods and making navigation more cheap, reliable
and efficient.
</P>
<P>
   The 26 generating units at this single site will have an
installed
</P>
<P>
   capacity of 18,200 megawatts, fully half the production
capability of the
</P>
<P>
   entire, multi-state Southern Company, the largest producer of
electricity
</P>
<P>
   in America.
</P>
<P>
   A visit to this central Yangtze region shows that Western
opponents who think they still can stop the Three Gorges Dam _
warning of environmental devastation and social dislocation _ had
better think again.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of Chinese peasants and villagers already have
been relocated, as new towns rise on riverbank heights to replace
the low-lying buildings exploded into rubble.
</P>
<P>
   Early stages of the dam itself are an imposing physical
presence.
</P>
<P>
   In five years, Lu's corporation has spent $3.7 billion,
harnessed the Yangtze into a channel to drain a river bed building
site, planted one stout end of the dam and blasted a massive
stair-stepped pit into the reddish-brown earth where shipping locks
will carry multi-ton vessels past the dam.
</P>
<P>
   A new high-speed road and new airport funnel supplies and people
here, new apartment buildings shelter the workers, and a new
Chinese-British joint venture every year produces 6 million
chickens, 60,000 pigs, and eggs from 200,000 hens to feed them.
</P>
<P>
   The dam is all but a fact. Yet fateful uncertainties remain:
</P>
<P>
   -- Will the dam actually end horrific Yangtze floods such as the
three major deluges that killed more than 300,000 people in this
century?
</P>
<P>
   -- Will a tangle of environmental complications result, such as
choking siltation that some predict will clog the very ports this
project is supposed to enhance? And will heavy upstream pollution
concentrate even further into a reservoir of bile as the dam
reduces river flow?
</P>
<P>
   -- Will the 1.1 million to 1.9 million people being resettled
end up with better housing and work opportunities, as the
government promises? Or will Three Gorges follow the pattern of
earlier Chinese dam projects, in which peasants were uprooted with
marginal help and resettlement funds got squandered?
</P>
<P>
   -- Does the dam itself carry the threat of deluge, either as a
wartime target or as result of earthquake or construction fault?
</P>
<P>
   They add up to the overall question of whether the dam, power
plant and resettlement, now carrying a $25 billion official price
tag by completion of Phase 3 in 2009, will be worth the many
dimensions of cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should be stopped. The project is merely political,
masquerading as a development project,'' said Owen Lammers,
executive director of the International Rivers Network, a San
Francisco-based coalition of environmental groups. ``If the Three
Gorges project is implemented, it will only reinforce the hardline
elements of the government, reinforce the power of state-owned
enterprises.''
</P>
<P>
   Ecologists propose a series of smaller dams that would be
gentler to the environment and to the people while also
contributing long-needed flood control and electric power.
</P>
<P>
   The dam opponents say dissent within China has been stifled on
this issue, as on other political questions, so pressure must be
built from outside the country. With China still short of funds to
complete the dam, opponents think the most effective pressure point
is the international financial community.
</P>
<P>
   Rumblings of dissatisfaction sound faintly in the countryside
areas directly affected by the dam. Negative reports from
hydrologists or archaeologists determined to state their case were
considered, then in most cases filed away or publicly refuted.
</P>
<P>
   Whether repelled by the controversy or mistakenly thinking the
dam already has diminished the river's scenic views, only half as
many tourists visited Three Gorges this year as came at this point
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   What has long been one of China's most spectacular attractions
will not be altered until Phase 2 of the dam is finished in the
year 2003. Then the rising waters will form a narrow reservoir
through the Three Gorges and beyond, ultimately reaching a water
level 175 meters _ about 575 feet _ higher than at present.
</P>
<P>
   The reservoir will bury not only towns and orchards, but also
Chinese artifacts thousands of years old _ ancient barge haulers'
tow paths, hanging coffins and mysterious rock engravings _ and it
will cut by a third or more the majestic height of sheer-sloped
gorges that today dwarf river travelers in misty drama.
</P>
<P>
   Yet officials like Lu sound confident of reaching all the worthy
goals listed in their brochures and headquarters signboards. At the
same time, they dismiss critics as simply being wrong, either
through naivete or intent to try to sabotage an important Chinese
project.
</P>
<P>
   And the Three Gorges Dam is almost exclusively a Chinese work.
</P>
<P>
   That is partly because some financial institutions heeded the
campaign that Western environmental groups mounted against the dam
by calling _ the erratic and powerful Yantgze waters are brought
under control, a clean new source of electric power opens more of
China to modernization and development, and river cargo transport
is expanded and made more affordable _ those huge achievements will
help propel what in many ways is a Third World country into the
21st century circle of wealthy nations.
</P>
<P>
   That will be the case assuming other consequences of the massive
dam are tolerable.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Environmental aftermath is among the most troubling questions.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese journalist and engineer Dai Qing published a book of
stinging critiques of the dam written by Chinese scientists, then
spent ten months in prison for it after the 1989 Tiananmen Square
massacre.
</P>
<P>
   She warns that little progress has been made in treating waste
water flowing freely into the Yangtze from cities and from big and
little industries that line the river banks. Even more polluting
factories have been allowed to locate in the new areas, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Three Gorges Dam defenders say they will prevent the reservoir
from becoming a catchment of lethal filth. Since the dam project
was approved in 1992, however, they have done little except tell
ships to stop dumping waste and sewage in the river.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are making local laws now for environmental protection of
the reservoir,'' assured Chen Gong, a development official in
Wuhan, the capital of Hubei Province which includes the dam. ``The
regulations will come out very soon.''
</P>
<P>
   The China sturgeon and three other species of Yangtze fish
already are endangered, and dam-influenced changes to their habitat
are unpredictable. Other experts worry about endangered Siberian
cranes and Swan Geese that winter downstream.
</P>
<P>
   Worries also remain about the impact of cramming at least
another 1.1 million people onto already heavily populated forest
and farmland at higher elevation, much of it more sharply sloped
than the fertile riverside banks that will be inundated.
</P>
<P>
   For China, the issues boil down to tradeoffs on a scale that the
rest of the world has seldom faced except in wartime.
</P>
<P>
   Lu, the general manager of the Three Gorges corporation, cited
hydroelectric power as the cleanest, safest way to generate
electricity, without radiation hazards of nuclear plants or the air
pollution of coal and oil generation. It does require reservoir
inundation, whose consequences he believes not only can be
controlled, but are far outweighed by gains.
</P>
<P>
   ``First, with completion of the project we are going to
contribute a great deal to protecting the property and life of 15
million people living in downstream areas,'' he said. ``The threat
of flood will be remote. People can develop the economy that will
lead to a better life in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``And second, it will generate enormous power which will
contribute to Central China, eastern China, Sichuan Province, to
the areas in all the Yangtze River. The power is cheap and is
clean. People will benefit from that.''

<P>
   THREE GORGES DAM, China _ Every day 18,000 Chinese mobilize to
build the most powerful _ and most disparaged _ hydro-electric dam
in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Each day they crunch more rocks, dig deeper pits, pour more and
more concrete for the edifice that within five years will stretch
1.4 miles across the Yangtze River and create a mammoth reservoir
370 miles long.
</P>
<P>
   With swells of national pride, some Chinese call this dam the
modern Great Wall.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not a place that politically cautious visitors like
President Clinton _ soon due to spend nine days in China _ will
come and admire as a new national icon. For the dam is suffused in
controversy as thick as the river mists that enfold construction
cranes angling high over the Yangtze.
</P>
<P>
   These workers and thousands more still to come will reconfigure
not just this site, but will flood the mystically beautiful Three
Gorges canyons that have inspired Chinese poets for centuries. And
they will trigger the eviction of more than one million Chinese who
fish and farm and trade along the river that carries their
livelihood and sometimes their destruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``China is still a poor country,'' Lu Youmei, general manager of
the China Three Gorges Project Corp., told Cox News Service
recently. ``To catch up to modern conditions in developed
countries, we may need half a century or even a century. The
Chinese have many things to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Lu is convinced the state-constructed hydroelectric dam will
boost China in its run toward modernity, producing electric power
equivalent to the output of 18 nuclear plants, diminishing the
deadly threat of floods and making navigation more cheap, reliable
and efficient.
</P>
<P>
   The 26 generating units at this single site will have an
installed
</P>
<P>
   capacity of 18,200 megawatts, fully half the production
capability of the
</P>
<P>
   entire, multi-state Southern Company, the largest producer of
electricity
</P>
<P>
   in America.
</P>
<P>
   A visit to this central Yangtze region shows that Western
opponents who think they still can stop the Three Gorges Dam _
warning of environmental devastation and social dislocation _ had
better think again.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of Chinese peasants and villagers already have
been relocated, as new towns rise on riverbank heights to replace
the low-lying buildings exploded into rubble.
</P>
<P>
   Early stages of the dam itself are an imposing physical
presence.
</P>
<P>
   In five years, Lu's corporation has spent $3.7 billion,
harnessed the Yangtze into a channel to drain a river bed building
site, planted one stout end of the dam and blasted a massive
stair-stepped pit into the reddish-brown earth where shipping locks
will carry multi-ton vessels past the dam.
</P>
<P>
   A new high-speed road and new airport funnel supplies and people
here, new apartment buildings shelter the workers, and a new
Chinese-British joint venture every year produces 6 million
chickens, 60,000 pigs, and eggs from 200,000 hens to feed them.
</P>
<P>
   The dam is all but a fact. Yet fateful uncertainties remain:
</P>
<P>
   -- Will the dam actually end horrific Yangtze floods such as the
three major deluges that killed more than 300,000 people in this
century?
</P>
<P>
   -- Will a tangle of environmental complications result, such as
choking siltation that some predict will clog the very ports this
project is supposed to enhance? And will heavy upstream pollution
concentrate even further into a reservoir of bile as the dam
reduces river flow?
</P>

end up with better housing and work opportunities, as the
government promises? Or will Three Gorges follow the pattern of

will cut by a third or more the majestic height of sheer-sloped

goals listed in their brochures and headquarters signboards. At the

through naivete or intent to try to sabotage an important Chinese
project.
</P>
<P>
   And the Three Gorges Dam is almost exclusively a Chinese work.
</P>
<P>
   That is partly because some financial institutions heeded the
campaign that Western environmental groups mounted against the dam
by calling it an ecological and social time bomb.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Export-Import Bank for example, opposed the dam in
1996, based on strong recommendations against the project from the
U.S. National Security Council. It asked the Chinese to bring plans
up to acceptable environmental standards before it would consider
financing any projects related to the dam, but never received a
response, said Linda Formella, a spokeswoman at the bank's
headquarters in Washington D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Some foreign banks have been more friendly, such as the
Canadians who issued export credits on behalf of General
Electric-Canada, or the Germans who are helping finance Siemens
generators for the power plant.
</P>
<P>
   But the few Americans who have grabbed a piece of Three Gorges
project _ including Caterpillar with a $30 million contract for
construction equipment and Rotec Industries winning $30 million for
concrete conveyor systems _ are supplying mostly hardware.
</P>
<P>
   An noticeably disappointed senior project manager Alfred Roider
of the giant German construction firm Philip Holzmann lamented that
the project was so ``political'' that the Chinese shut out
foreigners from engineering and building contracts.
</P>
<P>
   It's impossible to assess whether the Chinese did not want to be
hamstrung by potential foreign demands for stronger environmental
and social protections, or whether the Three Gorges Dam simply is
too important to national pride to let outsiders take credit for
building it.
</P>
<P>
   The notion has kicked around since one of China's first
revolutionary leaders, Sun Yat Sen, first proposed a dam in the
gorges in 1919. But war or revolution or politics always
intervened.
</P>
<P>
   Now if the dam's major aims are fulfilled _ the erratic and
powerful Yantgze waters are brought under control, a clean new
source of electric power opens more of China to modernization and
development, and river cargo transport is expanded and made more
affordable _ those huge achievements will help propel what in many
ways is a Third World country into the 21st century circle of
wealthy nations.

CANYON TO BE `WILDERNESS'  
 MANAGEMENT PLAN TO BLOCK DEVELOP MENT, VEHICLES 
</HEADLINE>
 RESENDING FOR ALL NEEDING   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE YOZWIAK  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ It looks like wilderness, feels like wilderness and _
usually _ sounds like wilderness. But Grand Canyon National Park is
not officially wilderness. Not yet.
</P>
<P>
   But it soon will be, in all but in name.
</P>
<P>
   Under a proposal released Monday, the National Park Service by
year's end would manage 94 percent of the 1.3 million-acre park as
if it were officially designated wilderness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wilderness'' is the highest level of protection granted any
federal land.
</P>
<P>
   The new management plan, which would not require congressional
approval, would prevent development of roads and buildings,
prohibit motorized vehicles and require that more than 120 miles of
old roads be turned into trails or restored to their natural
condition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's only been in recent times that the hierarchy of the Park
Service has recognized the significance of wilderness management,''
said Linda Jalbert, the park's outdoor recreation planner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though it's a national park, we get a lot of pressure for
new uses.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the proposals have been new helicopter landing pads, a
gondola from the rim to the river, new hotel lodges and even
floating casinos.
</P>
<P>
   The new plan could even mean that park rangers would repair
trails with less intrusive picks and shovels, as opposed to chain
saws and jackhammers, to protect the serenity of the wilderness. It
also calls for stepped-up education programs for back-country
hikers and scientific investigators. In the past decade, several
hikers have died and thousands more have been evacuated because of
heat exhaustion and dehydration.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1980, when most of the park was first proposed as
wilderness, the Park Service has bought grazing, mining and other
private development rights, conducted land-use studies and
increased the acreage proposed for wilderness by nearly 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The new draft Wilderness Management Plan also goes further,
calling for 1,109,257 acres to be immediately designated wilderness
as soon as Congress could act. That would include nearly all of the
Canyon's inner gorges, most of the North Rim, and the South Rim
west of Hermit's Rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the footwork has been done,'' Jalbert said. ``The next
step would be to present a bill to Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   How far such a bill may get in the current Congress is
questionable. Just last year Congress proposed just the opposite _
designating millions of miles of roadways in federal forests and
parks to maintain access for developers. Under pressure from park
advocates and a veto threat from President Clinton, the roads
proposal was dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Deb Gullett, administrative assistant to Sen. John McCain,
R-Ariz., said she was not aware of any plans to designate official
wilderness areas in the Grand Canyon.
</P>
<P>
   The Park Service plan released Monday also calls for 29,820
acres _ the Colorado River that flows for 277 miles through the
park, and its shorelines _ to be designated as proposed wilderness,
and that studies be done to include the river in the nation's
``Wild and Scenic'' river program.
</P>
<P>
   The ``wild and scenic'' designation, which could be done by
Congress or the secretary of the Interior, would forever prohibit
dams or diversions, such as were proposed in the 1950s and 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, 39 miles of the Verde River above Horseshoe Lake is
the only Arizona waterway with such protections, although
environmentalists have called for up to 1,700 miles of the state's
rivers and streams to be added.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed wilderness management plan covers virtually the
entire park except for the major trails (Bright Angel and Kaibab)
that cross the canyon from the South Rim to the North Rim.
</P>
<P>
   It also excludes the few areas inside the park _ mostly
surrounding Grand Canyon Village and the South Rim east of the
village _ that already are developed or have paved roads. Those
areas, which handle most of the park's 5 million visitors each
year, are subject to other park management plans.
</P>
<P>
   Designated campsites would be established and natural vegetation
restored at several backcountry sites where visitors now camp
wherever they please: Deer Creek, Cape Final, Point Sublime, Fire
Point, Swamp Point and Pasture Wash.
</P>
<P>
   Campsites and trails would be rehabilitated at Horseshoe Mesa,
Hermit Creek, Monument Creek and Upper Tapeats.
</P>
<P>
   Trails that would be rehabilitated: Tanner, New Hance, South
Bass, South Canyon and Nankoweap.
</P>
<P>
   Among the roads that would be converted to trails are more than
40 miles of former fire roads along the North Rim.
</P>
<P>
   The plan would retain 10 primitive roads that lead to wilderness
trail heads, and retain seven wilderness trails for use with horses
or mules.
</P>
<P>
   Citizens have until July 15 to submit comments on the proposed
management plan. More information is available at: http:// &QL;

   PHOENIX _ Genius? Him? Bill McDonald thought it was a joke when
he answered the phone Wednesday at his isolated ranch near the
Mexican border.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, right, he thought, as the caller said he'd been picked to
receive a ``genius grant'' of $285,000 over five years from the
MacArthur Foundation for his work forging compromises among
ranchers, environmentalists and government agencies.
</P>
<P>
   But the call (begin ital) did (end ital) sound like it was
long-distance.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald's hand went numb.
</P>
<P>
   Then he thought about his tax consultant.
</P>
<P>
   ``My God, my taxable income has just tripled,'' McDonald said of
his first reaction.
</P>
<P>
   Such are the problems that follow good deeds, said Sandy
Eastlake, executive vice president of the Arizona Cattle Growers
Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill is a brilliant man who has looked at the big picture to
see what we can do to keep ourselves in business in the future,''
Eastlake said.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald was recognized for his part in forming the Malpai
Borderlands Group, an organization of 25 environmentally aware
ranchers in Arizona and New Mexico. It has done some very
unorthodox things on the 800,000 acres the cattle growers graze in
the adjoining corners of the two states.
</P>
<P>
   The group has worked on increasing the numbers of the threatened
Chiricahuan Leopard Frog in their stock tanks and on reintroducing
jaguars in the area.
</P>
<P>
   They have enthusiastically backed the use of natural fires on
their range for ecological cleansing; 150,000 acres have burned in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   And the non-profit Malpai group has spent more than $400,000 to
buy ``conservation easements'' on land in their area to ensure that
it stays range and is not developed.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald said he is considering using much of the $285,000 award
to buy additional conservation easements in the area, which is
located east of Douglas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't just bang heads and make noise,'' McDonald said.
``We've worked with all the agencies and environmental groups and
have formed some true partnerships.''
</P>
<P>
   McDonald said the group first came together in 1992 ``to try to
take care of wide open spaces and biological diversity at the same
time.''
</P>
<P>
   One idea the ranchers quickly came up with was using ``grass
banks,'' which allow ranchers low on forage to use the grass of his
neighbor rather than overgraze his range.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've also had good success on the riparian areas on my
ranch,'' said McDonald, who has 350 head of cattle on the 21,000
acres he owns and leases. ``I learned that you need to move cattle
a lot more in tune with the needs of vegetation. I've got deep
grass, young cottonwoods and more pools of water all through my
riparian areas now.''
</P>
<P>
   The next project the group has planned is marketing low-fat beef
products from its herds on the natural-grass rangelands, McDonald
said.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald is one of 29 winners of stipends ranging from $220,000
to $375,000 awarded annually by the John D. and Catherine T.
MacArthur Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other winners were Tim Berners-Lee, a researcher at
Massachusetts Institute of Technology who was credited with
starting the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   It is not possible to apply for the grants, and there are no
strings attached as to how the winners spend their money. &QL;

Emily Post's ``Etiquette.'' The stamp _ a 1920s place-setting with
Lafayette Towle silver, a goblet and hand-painted Copeland Spode
China plate _ is elegant and extremely proper. But beneath that

America, so thoroughly front-porched and picket-fenced, that it
could pass for a movie set. This is what the producers of ``The
Truman Show,'' which opens Friday, were looking for _ and what they

VICTORIOUS JERRY BROWN VOWS FIGHT TO STRENGTHEN MAYOR'S DUTIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KATHLEEN SULLIVAN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ Former California Gov. Jerry Brown, calling
his election as Oakland's next mayor the ``first step,'' now has a
tougher task ahead _ convincing city voters to give him the tools
he says he needs to transform the job from ceremonial figurehead to
chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who won about 59 percent of the vote, took the lead at
the start. For his 10 rivals, it was a scramble for second place,
each hoping to win enough votes to force the flamboyant Brown into
a run-off race.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Blakely, who emphasized his urban planning expertise, came
closest to Brown, winning 15 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, a liberal Democrat who recently turned 60, put in long
hours on the campaign trail. He attended about 100 meetings in the
homes of supporters, where he emphasized that he had came to
listen, not lecture.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's star power frustrated his rivals, as did his popularity
with ethnic residents and blacks, who make up 43 percent of the
city's population. Eight black candidates competed with Brown for
the job, which has been held by an African American since 1977.
</P>
<P>
   The next step, Brown said, is to collect 44,000 signatures over
the next three weeks to put his ``strong mayor'' initiative on the
November ballot so it could be in place when he takes office in
January.
</P>
<P>
   Similar measures were defeated in 1989 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But Brown, who regularly denounced Oakland's city manager system
during the campaign, is confident the people of Oakland are ready
for a change.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just the first step,'' he said of his victory. ``Next
is the petition drive. Then voting on the initiative. Then there's
the carrying out of the urban agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who was governor of California from 1974 to 1982, moved
to Oakland three years ago from San Francisco. His campaign motto
was ``Oaklanders First'' and he adopted the city symbol, a gold oak
tree, as his campaign logo.
</P>
<P>
   If Brown's proposal to amend the City Charter passes, the mayor
could hire, fire and direct the city manager. The mayor would no
longer serve on the eight-member City Council and would vote only
when needed to break a tie. If the mayor vetoed legislation, it
would take six votes to override it.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said a strong mayoral form of government would dismantle
the barriers between the mayor and the people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under a city manager form of government, there is no
connection between the people and the executive branch,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Brown dismissed critics who said the measure would create an
anti-democratic form of government.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not true of Willie Brown,'' he said, referring to the
mayor of San Francisco. ``That's not true of Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what would happen if the charter change failed, he said:
``That makes the job a lot harder,''
</P>
<P>
   Brown's proposal faces opposition on the City Council.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sets up an imperial mayor,'' said council member Dick
Spees. ``If you want to get something done, you'd have to go to the
mayor.''

STUFFING WITH STYLE

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; June is busting out all over.
</P>
<P>
   Literally.
</P>
<P>
   Yep, according to experts in the breast-enhancement industry,
it's their best month of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Beth Higgins of Intimate Image in West Hills says, ``It's the
beginning of the swimsuit and wedding season. It's amazing, but
brides want to look their best even if the groom knows it's not all
her.''
</P>
<P>
   Higgins adds that 1998 is doing better than ever, with the
fashion trend to sheer, flimsy fabrics and tight tank tops.
</P>
<P>
   The best customers? ``Women who aren't quite brave or rich
enough to get permanently larger breasts. They include actresses,
models, teen-agers and also baby boomers who want to give their
sagging bustline a boost,'' explains Higgins, who with her business
partner Joan Mann, cater to breast-cancer survivors and the
naturally less endowed.
</P>
<P>
   According to Higgins, ``We sell both because the prosthesis
companies discovered the silicone pads worked better than the
polyester pads in traitional push-up bras like the WonderBra.''
</P>
<P>
   So, after years of young women stuffing their bras with facial
tissue, socks and their mother's foam-rubber shoulder pads (it was
an '80s thing), there's finally a fab falsie that warms to body
temperature, bounces when you walk, adds cleavage in a low-cut
dress, can survive swimming laps, and also passes the hug test.
</P>
<P>
   But even among these silicone wonders that can boost you from an
A to a D cup, there are, er, front runners.
</P>
<P>
   The one most folks see, whether they know it or not, is Curves,
manufactured by Belmont-based Body Lines Inc. A mail-order company
(they advertise in fashion magazines) created by homemaker Julie
Sautter in 1994, Curves has generated more than $50 million in
retail sales.
</P>
<P>
   The hefty silicone enhancers are referred to as Hollywood's
best-kept secret, according to company spokeswoman Rebecca Brooks.
``More than 500,000 pairs have been sold, and they're worn by
numerous actresses, including Amy Pietz of `Caroline in the City'
and the cast members of such shows as `Melrose Place,' `Buffy the
Vampire Slayer,' `ER' and ``Beverly Hills, 90210.' ''
</P>
<P>
   And also ``Baywatch.''
</P>
<P>
   What? You thought all those babes' breasts were real? Or
surgically enhanced?
</P>
<P>
   According to the show's costume designer, Karen Braverman,
``They're what you'd call an accessory in the industry ... and some
actresses find it a nice option to plastic surgery.''
</P>
<P>
   Even RuPaul admitted on his radio show that he wears them when
he's in drag, so we had to give them a try.
</P>
<P>
   To help America look better in a sweater, I tested Curves for
two days. My husband loved the look, even though he knew they were
fake.
</P>
<P>
   They quickly warm up to your body temperature, and they cling,
so there's no fear of slippage, and feel very natural within a
half-hour. In fact, I hardly knew I had them on (they're almost
weightless) until I passed by a mirror.
</P>
<P>
   And they bounce like the real (or implanted) thing, because of
the medical-grade silicone gel-filled pads. Best of all, they'll
fill out a fitted sheath.
</P>
<P>
   Other details? They're ideal for a woman with an A or B cup who
wants to be a C cup, and they fit best in an underwire bra. If you
want to go up to a D cup, you may require a size-bigger bra.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, they do go swimming _ in fact, Curves and other brands now
offer their own swimsuits with special ``envelopes'' to keep the
pads in place. But almost any suit with an underwire bra in it will
do.
</P>
<P>
   However, don't dive or they'll slip out and float to the top ...
just like tissue.
</P>
<P>
   Curves deliver what they promise, but because they are costly _
priced at $100 _ I went on the trail of other fab fakes and gave
several brands a try.
</P>
<P>
   At Intimate Image, I tried styles by Le Breast, Nearly Me and
Amoena. Some were smaller than others, heavier, squishier and
didn't always have a nipple. According to Mann, some women,
especially more mature ones, think nipples are too sexy, so they
offer a choice (and also a choice of flesh tones).
</P>
<P>
   Of the various styles offered at Intimate Image, my preference
was the Intrigue model by Amoena because it was closest to Curves,
and lower priced at $92. And for those who want the nude look under
their evening gown, there's also a special adhesive so you don't
need a bra.
</P>
<P>
   While there, I also tried on their old foam models, which feel
fake, don't bounce and get heavy in water. But they're only $9 a
pair.
</P>
<P>
   Scouting the mall, I found more silicone styles: Robinsons-May
sells Fashion Form Enhancers for $49.99 in the lingerie department;
they're an OK fit if you're on a budget and need just a little
boost. At Frederick's of Hollywood, there are several styles to
choose from _ from tiny booster pads to major coverage and
cleavage. I tried the largest, and found them a good value at $60,
but they don't come with a nipple ... and they're a little too
squishy.
</P>
<P>
   After trying on falsies all day, I thought back to the '60s when
Annette Funicello and Frankie Avalon starred in ``How to Stuff a
Wild Bikini.''
</P>
<P>
   They had no idea...

HUMORIST RETURNS TO COMPUTER GAMES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID BLOOM  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Leave it to Douglas Adams, the author of ``The
Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy,'' to turn interstellar disaster
into a good time, returning to computer gaming after 13 years with
the release of the three-CD interactive adventure Starship Titanic.
</P>
<P>
   The sumptuously produced game is a hoot of the first order, a
warped hybrid of Myst and Monty Python in space, aided and abetted
by ex-Pythonite Terry Jones, who provides the goofy voices of many
of the starship's daft robotic characters and one hysterically
squawky parrot.
</P>
<P>
   The premise is that the starship, on its maiden voyage as the
universe's greatest space liner, crashes into your house. You are
begged to come on board and fix things by Fentible, the butlerlike
Doorbot.
</P>
<P>
   Fentible also mentions that though the starship is supposed to
be the galaxy's grandest ride, it is in fact the worst incarnation
of Murphy's Law currently cruising the stars. You seek free
upgrades to first class, and try to save the liner, without going
slightly bonkers.
</P>
<P>
   The new game marks a return to computer gaming for Adams, who
had a hand in one of the best-selling adventure games of all time,
the text-only 1985 Infocom title based on his ``Hitchhiker'' book.
</P>
<P>
   In the years since that game came out, CD-ROMs have replaced
floppy disks as the medium of choice, allowing developers the room
to create gorgeous graphics and sound. But the knock-out look of
many games has often overwhelmed the stories they contain, Adams
said.
</P>
<P>
   So when he went to work on a new computer game, as part of a
London company he co-founded called the Digital Village, Adams said
he focused on creating a new set of interactive story lines, rather
than recycling the linear narrative of one of his many books.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very conscious of recalling into this medium some of the
complex interaction between author and player that was
characteristic of the early adventure games, but which got lost
when the medium progressed technologically and more attention
focused on the graphics,'' said Adams.
</P>
<P>
   The game's goofy humor will regularly transport fans of Adams
and Jones into Extended Guffaw Mode, while its game play is complex
enough to challenge the kinds of exploration-minded folks who have
made Myst and its sequel such huge sellers.
</P>
<P>
   For a quick taste of the game's humor, check out its Web site on
the Internet, which echoes Adams' tone and seems to have virtually
nothing to do with marketing the game itself.
</P>
<P>
   Located at www.starshiptitanic.com, it purports to be the
in-house publication of Starlight Travel, whose Starlight Lines
include the Titanic. It's a lot of fun, though you won't directly
learn much more about the game itself.
</P>
<P>
   You are eventually asked, however, to give your e-mail address
as part of a series of goofy ``personal'' questions mocking the
kinds of data other Web sites routinely gather from their readers.
</P>
<P>
   Publisher Simon &AMP; Schuster Interactive is counting on a
Myst-like market reaction, with its biggest-ever initial release of
200,000 copies to be shipped to 13 countries. Alas, the game has
only been released in Windows 95 format, though its sleek graphics
and liquid movement would look lovely on a Macintosh.
</P>
<P>
   It's that time of year again, when people seem to be graduating
from school or celebrating Father's Day all over the place. If you
haven't the time for a trip to the card shop, there are plenty of
online ways to show you care.
</P>
<P>
   One place to look is Blue Mountain Arts' site, which sends off
animated, musical e-mail greetings for free. Fill in the blanks,
and ship them to the one you love. The site, at
www.bluemountain.com, includes 18 different cards for those wired
young grads, and 15 more for Father's Day. Look out, Hallmark.
</P>
<P>
   Fans of the foul-mouthed cable cartoon hit ``South Park'' can
get their fill of video and audio clips from the show, along with
stills, schedules and other goodies related to the thrill-seeking
third-grade menaces at www.comedycentral.com/southpark/
</P>
<P>
   Tell 'em Kenny sent ya, before he was killed. Again.

THE SUCCESS OF STAX RECORDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; The soulful sound of Stax Records is so ingrained
in pop music, it's almost hard to believe it all came out of one
tiny recording studio.
</P>
<P>
   The Memphis studio that produced groundbreaking records by Otis
Redding, Booker T. &AMP; the MG's, Sam and Dave, Wilson Pickett,
Johnnie Taylor, Albert King and so many others may be gone, but the
sound lives on.
</P>
<P>
   Stax, the company that created a beat that resounds through
music to this day, is the subject of a Bravo Profiles documentary,
``The Soul of Stax,'' which begins airing at 8 and 11 p.m. Sunday
on the Bravo channel.
</P>
<P>
   The program digs up vintage music videos and concert footage,
'60s news clips, and interviews such Stax stars as Isaac Hayes,
Mavis Staples and Steve Cropper, legendary guitarist of the Stax
house band, the MG's.
</P>
<P>
   ``At Stax, we sort of took ethnic-based blues and upgraded it,''
Cropper said in an interview. ``And that's about all we did. We cut
a lot of ballads and lot of blues, but I think our success was
being able to make dance music. And I give all the credit to (late
MG's drummer) Al Jackson.''
</P>
<P>
   The show starts with a visit to the Memphis suburb where Jim
Stewart and Estelle Axton first set up a studio after Axton
second-mortgaged her home to buy equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The two soon realized they needed to be closer to the city and
after a year moved to an ex-movie theater on East McLemore Avenue
in Memphis. There, they recorded Rufus Thomas and his daughter,
Carla , performing ``Cause I Love You,'' a local hit in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   Gradually, Stax built a roster of hitmakers. The label's
greatest success came with Redding, whose ``Dock of the Bay'' and
``Try a Little Tenderness'' made him the king of r&AMP;b. When Redding
died in a plane crash in 1968, Stax never really recovered.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people told us they could always tell a Stax
record,'' Cropper said. ``And it did, I guess, have an identity. I
wasn't thinking of it in those terms, but the public knew
different.''
</P>
<P>
   During times of racial strife in America, Stax thrived with an
integrated cast.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the early '60s, Stax was kind of like a forerunner for the
integration scene in Memphis,'' songwriter-singer William Bell says
during the documentary. ``We worked together as a group, but we
weren't too well-received outside of our little realm.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stax story is also told in a thoroughly researched new book,
``Soulsville, USA: The Stax Records Story'' (Schirmer Books, $25)
by Rob Bowman, a professor of music at York University in Toronto.
Bowman was also instrumental in the making of ``The Soul of Stax.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nashville-based Cropper, now touring as part of the ``Blues
Brothers'' band, says if he knew how to write hits like those that
came out of Stax in the '60s, ``I'd write three of 'em a day. It
was a phenomenon.''

RACE NOT ALWAYS A HARMONIOUS SUBJECT IN CLASSICAL MUSIC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WAYNE LEE GAY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   From her seat in the orchestra, violinist Rosalyn Story surveyed
the crowd at last month's opening gala at the Nancy Lee and Perry
R. Bass Performance Hall. The audience was virtually all white.
</P>
<P>
   Story was concerned, but she was not surprised. The only
African-American in the Fort Worth Symphony, she is also the author
of the 1990 book ``And So I Sing: African-American Divas of the
Opera and Concert,'' and is a leading authority on the role of
African-Americans in classical music in America.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, the classical music arena has been mostly closed
to African-Americans. The breakthrough has been in the female
operatic voice sector, where Marian Anderson paved the way for
Leontyne Price, who in turn opened the door for a whole generation
of African-American divas. Friday, the latest addition to the
roster of African-American operatic stars, mezzo-soprano Denyce
Graves, will make her debut in Fort Worth in a gala concert at the
Bass hall.
</P>
<P>
   Graves says that her skyrocketing career has, in recent years,
elevated her above racial discrimination. As the reigning Carmen at
the Metropolitan Opera, she can write her own ticket anywhere in
the world. But it hasn't always been that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the beginning, there was some blatant discrimination,'' she
says. Once, she flew from Houston, where she was a member of the
Houston Opera Studio, toNew York for an audition; the director
looked at her, asked her what her voice category was, and then
informed her that he didn't need a mezzo-soprano. A week later, she
talked to a white, Canadian mezzo who told her that the same man
had listened to her enthusiastically.
</P>
<P>
   A later experience had a more positive outcome. Cast as
Giulietta in Offenbach's ``Tales of Hoffmann,'' she learned that
the designer of the production ``made no bones about it. He did not
want a black Giulietta.''
</P>
<P>
   She arrived for rehearsals a week before the designer, and
remembers that, the day before he was to arrive: ``I went to bed
with an upset stomach. The next morning, I worked out, put on my
best dress and makeup. At the rehearsal, he hardly spoke to me.''
</P>
<P>
   But she proved herself so cooperative and talented that he began
to relent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We became friendly, and he wanted me for another production,''
she says. ``We really got past color together. I showed him I was
committed and a hard worker. He came to respect me.''
</P>
<P>
   Although it is African-American women who have made the most
spectacular inroads in the field of opera, bass Raymond Bazemore,
an associate professor of voice at Texas Christian University who
has had a broad and distinguished career, says that, at times,
ethnicity has been to his advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``You begin with an extraordinary talent, and you get
encouragement,'' he says. ``As you get encouraged, you go
further.''
</P>
<P>
   Bazemore says that being a true bass helped him in his career,
which has included major traditional bass roles around the world as
well as unusual roles such as Caiaphas in ``Jesus Christ
Superstar.'' But he also says that the African-American community
as a whole tends to support talented individuals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has always been the case that blacks collectively encourage
the very talented among us to pursue our talents,'' he says. And he
points out that numerous roles can be sung only by blacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Porgy and Bess gave many of us, including me, an opportunity
to display our skills,'' he says. ``If you have talent, and the
chance to keep doing it, you will succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   Story, however, says that racism persists in the operatic
community.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are different kinds of racism,'' she says. ``One that is
happening now is the racism of being invisible.''
</P>
<P>
   She cites the scarcity of black singers at the Metropolitan
Opera and at other companies, the stereotyping of roles and the
lack of the same inroads for black men as for black women.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are threatened by a black male lead in a romantic
role,'' she says. ``Black men are seen as threat.''
</P>
<P>
   She also points out that certain roles are still seen as more
appropriate than others for African-American women.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carmen and Aida are easier for black women,'' she says.
``Carmen is a dark gypsy. Aida is an Ethiopian. They both match the
stereotype of dark exoticism, and are seen as more acceptable roles
for black women.''
</P>
<P>
   And, Story says, the real breakthroughs have come only at the
top, for the stars such as Price, Kathleen Battle, Jessye Norman _
and, recently, Graves.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the same as in athletics,'' she says. ``It's the lower
levels that are difficult for blacks. Unless you're among the
greatest, you compete with whites, and whites are preferred. In the
1960s and 1970s, there was an agenda of choosing and helping
blacks. Now, black people have gone back to being invisible.''
</P>
<P>
   Graves, who was born in Washington, D.C., grew up close to the
black gospel tradition, singing in a family music group before she
was introduced to opera.
</P>
<P>
   ``Black people have a heritage of song,'' she says. ``There are
those of us who take the trouble to study properly. It's natural
that an African-American woman should sing on the stage.''
</P>
<P>
   And, although she has experienced discrimination, she says, ``I
see my race as an advantage in everything I do. I'm proud to be an
African-American woman.''

AT MTV'S FILM AWARDS, REEL LIFE BGATS REAL OFFBEAT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; You knew you were in a parallel universe when the
award for best prosthetic device went to the head on a stick from
``Men in Black.''
</P>
<P>
   At the 1998 MTV Movie Awards _ the evil stepchild of the Golden
Globes _ the camera immediately cut to the audience, where the
notorious fake male organ from ``Boogie Nights'' _ wearing a bowler
hat _ was grumbling to its manager about losing.
</P>
<P>
   It was the kind of awards show where actress Milla Jovovich
announced backstage that she was playing Joan of Arc in an upcoming
movie and a reporter immediately asked what type of character that
might be.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's kind of cool,'' Jovovich answered at the awards show
taping Saturday in Santa Monica.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in a nearby tent, a rabid pack of photographers _ the
kind that makes the throng terrorizing the Academy Awards each year
seem like a crew from the Vatican _ was demanding that
model-actress-whatever Carmen Electra take her top off. She
declined.
</P>
<P>
   The MTV Movie Awards is the most unconventional of awards shows.
As a result, the stars let their hair down, appearing more honest
and less scripted than at other public appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Along with unusual categories such as best screen smooch, best
fight and dance sequence, the program offers musical performances
and spoofs. ``Jackie Brown'' actor Samuel L. Jackson hosted the
two-hour show, which will be broadcast for the first time at 9 p.m
today on MTV and repeated often afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the best moments took place backstage. Before Australian
ex-soap opera star Natalie Imbruglia appeared in the press tent, an
assistant announced that the singer of the hit ``Torn'' would
accept ``no personal questions.''
</P>
<P>
   Who knew anything personal about Imbruglia beyond her
much-copied pixie haircut to begin with? A gossip maven from E!
Entertainment Television filled us in: One of her ex-boyfriends is
David Schwimmer of TV's ``Friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Award winners included ``Titanic'' for top movie of the year and
John Travolta and Nicolas Cage for best on-screen duo from
``Face/Off,'' which also won for best action sequence for its
speedboat chase.
</P>
<P>
   According to MTV viewers, Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore
delivered the best kiss in ``The Wedding Singer''; Neve Campbell
got best female performance for ``Scream 2''; and Heather Graham,
who played Rollergirl in ``Boogie Nights,'' gave the year's
breakthrough performance.
</P>
<P>
   Will Smith and Mike Myers each won two awards: Smith for his
theme from ``Men in Black'' and for the best fight with a giant
cockroach in the same film, and Myers as best villain in ``Austin
Powers: International Man of Mystery'' and for his dance sequence
in the same movie.
</P>
<P>
   Myers and Sandler both dedicated their awards to Phil Hartman,
their fellow ``Saturday Night Live'' alum who was murdered last
week at his Encino home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phil Hartman was one of the greatest character actors ever,''
Myers said. ``And his wife, Brynn, was a wonderful person and a
wonderful mother.''
</P>
<P>
   In one of the show's best bits, MTV gave its Lifetime
Achievement Award to character actor Clint Howard, who starred in
``Gentle Ben'' as a youngster and went on to appear in a host of
films, including many of brother Ron Howard's productions.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Landau introduced Howard as ``a great artist, a great
man, a true American original ... four of his films have grossed
more than $1 million at the box office!''
</P>
<P>
   Best comedic performance award winner Jim Carrey (for ``Liar,
Liar'') predictably gave a knockout turn at the podium, pretending
to be the devil while snickering, ``I'd like to thank my fans who
have always supported my comedies but don't know how to take me in
a drama.''
</P>
<P>
   After it was all over, before audience members and stars hoofed
it to the after-show bash, Jackson told what he liked best about
hosting the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's loose, everyone can be themselves,'' he said. ``It's
really a lot of fun.''
</P>
<P>
   We second that emotion.

 By DOUGLAS FOSTER  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    Jerry Brown teeters atop a table in an oakland cafe, his arms
akimbo like a jack-in-the-box. Surprise, it's me! It's early on a
Saturday morning, and droopy-eyed customers drift past him,
bellying up to the counter. But Brown won't be ignored.
 &HT;    ``Oakland has been on the verge of greatness for so long, it's
time to push it past the verge!'' he shouts as the black table
wobbles beneath him.
 &HT;    The cafe, called Brewberry's, is wedged between storefronts in
the city's working-class Laurel District, one of the most
integrated neighborhoods in one of the most diverse cities in the
country. Down the street are Cornerstone Missionary Baptist Church,
Sun Sun Alterations and La Ultima Restaurant. Inside the coffee
shop, Brown, dressed in a black collarless shirt and black Gap
pants _ denounces the power of moneyed interests in politics and
``the old boys network.''
 &HT;    It's vintage Brown rhetoric. This time, however, the ``old
boys'' targeted by Brown are the blacks and Latinos who run
Oakland's City Hall.
 &HT;    A woman in stretch pants finally speaks up, asking him, ``Why do
you want the job?'' Brown leans toward her and shoots back,
``Because it will be a major contribution to political life in the
whole country.''
 &HT;    He promises to limit the influence of lobbyists, generate ``full
citizen participation'' in local government, enforce ``zero
tolerance for crime,'' improve the schools, stimulate development,
even spark a ``revitalized cultural life.'' Brown rhapsodizes about
``the power of ideas,'' then asks, ``Anybody want to offer an
idea?''
 &HT;    When no one steps forward, he promptly fills the void. ``Ideas
have to be tested in the crucible of reality,'' he exclaims.
``Oakland is the crucible of reality!''
 &HT;    Why does Brown want to be mayor of a largely nonwhite city of
just 388,000 people in which the post is a relatively weak one?
Since Oakland is known more for the size of its underclass (and its
embrace of Ebonics) than for the stature of its political leaders,
many observers have sneered that the mayor's office here is beneath
Brown.
 &HT;    But the pundits have it wrong. In Oakland, crime is down,
employment is up and there are signs of a long-delayed economic
boom _ creating the possibility of a showcase turnaround. Moreover,
at 60, how many more times can he mount unsuccessful bids for the
presidency? Following years of high-flying talk _ he has even been
a radio chat-show host lately _ Brown seems to want to ground
himself, at last, in Oakland.
 &HT;    If it's clear why Brown wants to be mayor, the motivations of
Oakland voters are murkier. Brown is almost always met with a mix
of familiarity and perplexity, the kind of reaction Mario Cuomo
might encounter if he decided to run for mayor of Poughkeepsie. In
front of Brewberry's picture window, an elderly Mexican-American
woman doubts that Brown will stay long at City Hall if he's
elected.
 &HT;    ``I worry about him winning and taking off,'' she says. A
middle-aged black woman proves more enthusiastic. ``The black
leadership hasn't accomplished much,'' she says flatly, creasing
her lips. ``Brown can change the whole picture. He's energetic,
dynamic. Besides, he's the Kennedy of California. The native son
can do what he wants, don't you think?''
 &HT;    Brown's celebrity may grab headlines, but that is far easier
than battling school boards or fighting the local drug trade. And
even some of his admirers worry that Brown _ a man so prone to
pie-in-the-sky visions that he once earned the nickname Governor
Moonbeam _ simply isn't suited for the managerial challenges that
face urban mayors today.
 &HT;    Brown is a newcomer, having moved to Oakland in 1994. And this
is a city where only a quarter of the residents are white (43
percent are black, 14 percent Latino and 14 percent Asian). Not
surprisingly, his opponents have portrayed him as an interloper.
 &HT;    For much of its 146-year history, however, Oakland was run by a
clubby conservative circle that produced only white mayors. In the
1970s, around the time Jerry Brown began his first term as governor
_ following in the footsteps of his father, Edmund G. Brown, who
held the post between 1959 and 1966 _ the militant Black Panther
Party shook things up with a series of voter-registration drives.
 &HT;    In 1977, Lionel Wilson, a judge, became the city's first black
mayor; Wilson was followed in 1990 by Elihu Harris, a black state
legislator. (Harris chose not to run for a third term this year.)
Against this backdrop, Brown's regular denunciations of
``mediocrity at City Hall'' during ``the past 20 years'' have hit a
nerve.
 &HT;    Exhibit A in Brown's brief against the status quo is the costly
deal that local politicians struck with Al Davis to lure the
Raiders football team back to play in the Oakland Coliseum. (The
deal, aimed at giving the city's anemic economy a shot in the arm,
relied on inflated revenue estimates.) Brown has called for a
criminal investigation.
 &HT;    ``Brown's just playing to the cheapest seats,'' replies Mary
King, one of his key opponents in the mayoral race. King is a black
woman who worked her way up from library aide to the powerful
position of Alameda County Supervisor. At a public forum, she
vents, ``It's a fascinating moment when a white man _ the son of a
governor! _ can accuse a woman who started out as a single mother
on welfare of being too imbedded in the system.''
 &HT;    King places the blame for Oakland's economic collapse in the
1980s on a California taxpayer revolt two decades ago _ when Jerry
Brown was governor. After passage of Proposition 13 in 1978, state
money for cities fell. An economic skid grew into a sustained
statewide recession, hitting Oakland particularly hard.
 &HT;    ``Certainly we can take responsibility for not having done
enough, for not having moved farther,'' King murmurs. ``But it's
been uphill all the way.''
 &HT;    King is clearly frustrated by Brown's popularity. ``People have
gotten caught up in a kind of 'white man's ice is colder'
syndrome,'' she says acidly.
 &HT;    Another of Brown's chief competitors is a member of the City
Council, Ignacio De La Fuente, an immigrant from Mexico who started
out in Oakland as a dishwasher 27 years ago and rose through
trade-union leadership ranks to become the city's first Latino vice
mayor. In a drive around the city, De La Fuente animatedly points
out a group of new town houses on the waterfront and the first new
shopping center in his district, Fruitvale, in two decades.
 &HT;    ``Ask anybody who pulled that out of the fire,'' he demands.
``Saying and doing are two different things. Jerry talks a good
line about development and creating jobs. But damn it, I've been
accomplishing what he only talks about.''
 &HT;    With California's boom economy ratcheting up real-estate prices
elsewhere, Oakland is the only major Bay Area city left with a
surfeit of affordable space. A decommissioned 422-acre Army base
will be conveyed to the city soon, another plum opportunity. There
are also plans to dredge the port and expand the airport, fueling a
potential job surge. De La Fuente ticks off these facts, and winces
at the idea of Brown in charge as they come to pass.
 &HT;    ``I like Jerry,'' De La Fuente says. ``But he just doesn't have
the attention span to be mayor.''
 &HT;    If a person's home provides a window into his psyche, the $2
million warehouse that Jerry Brown built from the ground up in 1995
is a fascinating case study. Stretched over a quarter block of land
near Oakland's waterfront, it looks austere from the outside, a
vast expanse of corrugated steel.
 &HT;    Inside, there's 17,000 square feet to rattle around in, with a
garden outside for organic vegetables. It's where Brown's campaign
was run _ from a series of cubicles along the left side of the
room. On the opposite side are two long wooden tables.
 &HT;    ``Here's the only thing about the whole place that matters to
me,'' Brown says, waving his hand. ``The monastic table _ to sit
there and have conversations.''
 &HT;    Brown's longtime friend, the French-born intellectual Jacques
Barzaghi, painted a large red circle in the center of the floor
downstairs _ ``to signify unity,'' he says, fingering his polished
prayer beads. Barzaghi, who has been part of Brown's inner circle
since his gubernatorial days, is a man with a gleaming shaved head
given to sudden proclamations. (``Life is good!'' he regularly
exclaims.)
 &HT;    Barzaghi and his wife occupy one of 10 loft bedrooms upstairs.
Brown sleeps in a room down the way, and other political supporters
and friends periodically bed down in the rest. (Brown's regular
date for the past eight years, Anne Gust, is general counsel for
the Gap; she maintains her own home in San Francisco.) It's not
your average Oakland politician's digs.
 &HT;    None of his opponents in the mayoral campaign made much of
Brown's living in a commune, perhaps because his unconventionality
_ from his affair with the singer Linda Ronstadt while running for
president in 1980 to his tendency to speak in long, vaguely
oracular phrases _ has become, after all these years, familiar to
Californians.
 &HT;    Reporters continue to poke fun, however. ``They write that I'm
quirky,'' he says, sounding genuinely flummoxed. ``But the whole
thing I'm doing here is pure practical, nuts and bolts. You've been
around. Have you seen anything quirky?''
 &HT;    One afternoon in the warehouse, Brown pulls out a worn album
that his father kept under his bed. The tattered clippings
chronicle his father's early career. Jerry recites his father's
campaign slogan, laughing: ``'Crack down on crime, pick Brown this
time.' Boy, some things never change.''
 &HT;    His father was an avuncular, beloved politician of the old
school who made his reputation as a grand builder through the
state's high tide of economic expansion in the 1960's. When the
younger Brown dropped out of a Jesuit seminary in 1960, he bided
his time at law school and a clerkship, waiting to begin his own
political hegira until 1969, three years after his father lost his
bid for a third term to Ronald Reagan.
 &HT;    ``The point I'm trying to make with all this,'' he says now, in
a kind of reverie as he pages through his father's scrapbook, ``is
that Edmund G. Brown, father and son, have been involved in
California politics since 1946. It's an unbroken chain.''
 &HT;    This comment seems particularly surprising _ because after Jerry
Brown leapfrogged in 1975 into the governor's office while still in
his mid-30s, he expressed icy disdain for 1960's Big Government
spending on infrastructure and social programs, the hallmark of his
father's career.
 &HT;    He openly decried ``the obvious manipulation and role-playing''
in his father's style of politics. Watching him embrace his
father's legacy so fully now, referring casually to their
similarities, you can see how agile he is, how strong his penchant
for reinvention.
 &HT;    Brown regularly touts his experience as governor, citing ``the
tremendous burst of creativity'' in state government during his
years as chief executive. But there's the other side of history too
_ notably, his reputation for poor administrative skills. ``He's
absolutely the worst administrator I've ever seen,'' says a former
member of his cabinet.
 &HT;    In any case, Brown himself admits that what's required
politically of a governor is vastly different from what confronts a
mayor. ``Being governor is much more abstract,'' Brown
acknowledges. ``This is upfront, in-your-face detail.''
 &HT;    Does Brown have the discipline _ and the consistency _ needed to
slog through such details?
 &HT;    Shortly after he announced his candidacy in October, the media
had a field day with an environmentalist manifesto commissioned by
Brown and titled ``Oakland Ecopolis: A Plan for a Green Plan.'' The
plan upbraided advocates of ``mere economic growth,'' envisioning
an ``ecologically friendly'' city where ``solar generators quietly
hum'' next to ``farm kiosks and craft bazaars.''
 &HT;    This spring, however, he reined himself in, talking almost
exclusively about crime, schools _ and economic development.
Pressed about this change, Brown bristles. ``I do want to do a
sustainability plan for Oakland,'' he says. ``It'll take a few
years to do it. But we'll work it in there.''
 &HT;    As a newcomer who has only had a crash course in Oakland's
reality, I ask, can he really set the city's political direction?
``Look, I could do something else _ like enjoy life,'' he says.
``There's everything here that I've ever cared about _ poverty,
environmental issues, labor, crime, schools, transportation. In a
concrete way, everything I've been concerned about in my entire
life is at issue in Oakland.''
 &HT;    Brown's capacity for reinvention could flourish, or founder, in
the pitted streets of Oakland. A mayor in a city like Oakland is
held responsible for the conditions in the schools and on the
streets. With hopes raised high, the citizens of Oakland are
unlikely to cut him any slack once he's in office. Power seduces,
but it also stings.
 &HT;    Come next January, Jerry Brown had better know whom to call
about those potholes.

elected.
 &HT;    ``I worry about him winning and taking off,'' she says. A
middle-aged black woman proves more enthusiastic. ``The black
leadership hasn't accomplished much,'' she says flatly, creasing
her lips. ``Brown can change the whole picture. He's energetic,
dynamic. Besides, he's the Kennedy of California. The native son
can do what he wants, don't you think?''
 &HT;    Brown's celebrity may grab headlines, but that is far easier
than battling school boards or fighting the local drug trade. And
even some of his admirers worry that Brown _ a man so prone to
pie-in-the-sky visions that he once earned the nickname Governor
Moonbeam _ simply isn't suited for the managerial challenges that
face urban mayors today.
 &HT;    Brown is a newcomer, having moved to Oakland in 1994. And this
is a city where only a quarter of the residents are white (43
percent are black, 14 percent Latino and 14 percent Asian). Not
surprisingly, his opponents have portrayed him as an interloper.
 &HT;    For much of its 146-year history, however, Oakland was run by a
clubby conservative circle that produced only white mayors. In the
1970s, around the time Jerry Brown began his first term as governor
_ following in the footsteps of his father, Edmund G. Brown, who
held the post between 1959 and 1966 _ the militant Black Panther
Party shook things up with a series of voter-registration drives.
 &HT;    In 1977, Lionel Wilson, a judge, became the city's first black
mayor; Wilson was followed in 1990 by Elihu Harris, a black state
legislator. (Harris chose not to run for a third term this year.)
Against this backdrop, Brown's regular denunciations of
``mediocrity at City Hall'' during ``the past 20 years'' have hit a
nerve.
 &HT;    Exhibit A in Brown's brief against the status quo is the costly
deal that local politicians struck with Al Davis to lure the
Raiders football team back to play in the Oakland Coliseum. (The
deal, aimed at giving the city's anemic economy a shot in the arm,
relied on inflated revenue estimates.) Brown has called for a
criminal investigation.
 &HT;    ``Brown's just playing to the cheapest seats,'' replies Mary
King, one of his key opponents in the mayoral race. King is a black
woman who worked her way up from library aide to the powerful
position of Alameda County Supervisor. At a public forum, she
vents, ``It's a fascinating moment when a white man _ the son of a
governor! _ can accuse a woman who started out as a single mother
on welfare of being too imbedded in the system.''
 &HT;    King places the blame for Oakland's economic collapse in the
1980s on a California taxpayer revolt two decades ago _ when Jerry
Brown was governor. After passage of Proposition 13 in 1978, state
money for cities fell. An economic skid grew into a sustained
statewide recession, hitting Oakland particularly hard.
 &HT;    ``Certainly we can take responsibility for not having done
enough, for not having moved farther,'' King murmurs. ``But it's
been uphill all the way.''
 &HT;    King is clearly frustrated by Brown's popularity. ``People have
gotten caught up in a kind of 'white man's ice is colder'
syndrome,'' she says acidly.
 &HT;    Another of Brown's chief competitors is a member of the City
Council, Ignacio De La Fuente, an immigrant from Mexico who started
out in Oakland as a dishwasher 27 years ago and rose through
trade-union leadership ranks to become the city's first Latino vice
mayor. In a drive around the city, De La Fuente animatedly points
out a group of new town houses on the waterfront and the first new
shopping center in his district, Fruitvale, in two decades.
 &HT;    ``Ask anybody who pulled that out of the fire,'' he demands.
``Saying and doing are two different things. Jerry talks a good
line about development and creating jobs. But damn it, I've been
accomplishing what he only talks about.''
 &HT;    With California's boom economy ratcheting up real-estate prices
elsewhere, Oakland is the only major Bay Area city left with a
surfeit of affordable space. A decommissioned 422-acre Army base
will be conveyed to the city soon, another plum opportunity. There
are also plans to dredge the port and expand the airport, fueling a
potential job surge. De La Fuente ticks off these facts, and winces
at the idea of Brown in charge as they come to pass.
 &HT;    ``I like Jerry,'' De La Fuente says. ``But he just doesn't have
the attention span to be mayor.''
 &HT;    If a person's home provides a window into his psyche, the $2
million warehouse that Jerry Brown built from the ground up in 1995
is a fascinating case study. Stretched over a quarter block of land
near Oakland's waterfront, it looks austere from the outside, a
vast expanse of corrugated steel.
 &HT;    Inside, there's 17,000 square feet to rattle around in, with a
garden outside for organic vegetables. It's where Brown's campaign
was run _ from a series of cubicles along the left side of the
room. On the opposite side are two long wooden tables.
 &HT;    ``Here's the only thing about the whole place that matters to
me,'' Brown says, waving his hand. ``The monastic table _ to sit
there and have conversations.''
 &HT;    Brown's longtime friend, the French-born intellectual Jacques
Barzaghi, painted a large red circle in the center of the floor
downstairs _ ``to signify unity,'' he says, fingering his polished
prayer beads. Barzaghi, who has been part of Brown's inner circle
since his gubernatorial days, is a man with a gleaming shaved head
given to sudden proclamations. (``Life is good!'' he regularly
exclaims.)
 &HT;    Barzaghi and his wife occupy one of 10 loft bedrooms upstairs.
Brown sleeps in a room down the way, and other political supporters
and friends periodically bed down in the rest. (Brown's regular
date for the past eight years, Anne Gust, is general counsel for
the Gap; she maintains her own home in San Francisco.) It's not
your average Oakland politician's digs.
 &HT;    None of his opponents in the mayoral campaign made much of
Brown's living in a commune, perhaps because his unconventionality
_ from his affair with the singer Linda Ronstadt while running for
president in 1980 to his tendency to speak in long, vaguely
oracular phrases _ has become, after all these years, familiar to
Californians.
 &HT;    Reporters continue to poke fun, however. ``They write that I'm
quirky,'' he says, sounding genuinely flummoxed. ``But the whole
thing I'm doing here is pure practical, nuts and bolts. You've been
around. Have you seen anything quirky?''
 &HT;    One afternoon in the warehouse, Brown pulls out a worn album
that his father kept under his bed. The tattered clippings
chronicle his father's early career. Jerry recites his father's
campaign slogan, laughing: ``'Crack down on crime, pick Brown this
time.' Boy, some things never change.''
 &HT;    His father was an avuncular, beloved politician of the old
school who made his reputation as a grand builder through the
state's high tide of economic expansion in the 1960's. When the
younger Brown dropped out of a Jesuit seminary in 1960, he bided
his time at law school and a clerkship, waiting to begin his own
political hegira until 1969, three years after his father lost his
bid for a third term to Ronald Reagan.
 &HT;    ``The point I'm trying to make with all this,'' he says now, in
a kind of reverie as he pages through his father's scrapbook, ``is
that Edmund G. Brown, father and son, have been involved in
California politics since 1946. It's an unbroken chain.''
 &HT;    This comment seems particularly surprising _ because after Jerry
Brown leapfrogged in 1975 into the governor's office while still in
his mid-30s, he expressed icy disdain for 1960's Big Government
spending on infrastructure and social programs, the hallmark of his
father's career.
 &HT;    He openly decried ``the obvious manipulation and role-playing''
in his father's style of politics. Watching him embrace his
father's legacy so fully now, referring casually to their
similarities, you can see how agile he is, how strong his penchant
for reinvention.
 &HT;    Brown regularly touts his experience as governor, citing ``the
tremendous burst of creativity'' in state government during his
years as chief executive. But there's the other side of history too
_ notably, his reputation for poor administrative skills. ``He's
absolutely the worst administrator I've ever seen,'' says a former
member of his cabinet.
 &HT;    In any case, Brown himself admits that what's required
politically of a governor is vastly different from what confronts a
mayor. ``Being governor is much more abstract,'' Brown
acknowledges. ``This is upfront, in-your-face detail.''
 &HT;    Does Brown have the discipline _ and the consistency _ needed to
slog through such details?
 &HT;    Shortly after he announced his candidacy in October, the media
had a field day with an environmentalist manifesto commissioned by
Brown and titled ``Oakland Ecopolis: A Plan for a Green Plan.'' The
plan upbraided advocates of ``mere economic growth,'' envisioning
an ``ecologically friendly'' city where ``solar generators quietly
hum'' next to ``farm kiosks and craft bazaars.''
 &HT;    This spring, however, he reined himself in, talking almost
exclusively about crime, schools _ and economic development.
Pressed about this change, Brown bristles. ``I do want to do a
sustainability plan for Oakland,'' he says. ``It'll take a few
years to do it. But we'll work it in there.''
 &HT;    As a newcomer who has only had a crash course in Oakland's
reality, I ask, can he really set the city's political direction?
``Look, I could do something else _ like enjoy life,'' he says.
``There's everything here that I've ever cared about _ poverty,
environmental issues, labor, crime, schools, transportation. In a
concrete way, everything I've been concerned about in my entire
life is at issue in Oakland.''
 &HT;    Brown's capacity for reinvention could flourish, or founder, in
the pitted streets of Oakland. A mayor in a city like Oakland is
held responsible for the conditions in the schools and on the
streets. With hopes raised high, the citizens of Oakland are
unlikely to cut him any slack once he's in office. Power seduces,
but it also stings.
 &HT;    Come next January, Jerry Brown had better know whom to call
about those potholes.

 FROM: The Boston Globe Magazine  
 (Distributed by The New York Times Syndicate)  
 &HT;    It's not the kind of thing you usually have to worry about.
 &HT;    But there's no mistaking the urgency in the voice of
zero-gravity test director Judy Rickard.
 &HT;    Several of us are floating upside down in the airplane cabin _
not that it's easy to tell upside from down, with gravity
temporarily suspended _ and the half-minute of weightlessness is
about to end.
 &HT;    Landing headfirst can be a real hazard on zero-G flights, even
though the floor, like the rest of our aircraft's interior, is well
padded, so Rickard and the other instructors are keeping a vigilant
eye on the suspended novices.
 &HT;    With a quick kick to the ceiling, I propel my legs back down
below head level _ just in the nick of time.
 &HT;    As ``down'' abruptly reasserts its existence, I crumple to the
floor, more or less feet first, and settle in for a couple of
minutes of double-strength gravity. Keeping track of which way the
floor lies is just one of the bewildering tasks that confront the
passengers on NASA's reduced-gravity test aircraft, otherwise known
as the ``vomit comet.''
 &HT;    There's nothing stomach-churning about the plane itself _ it's
essentially like a commercial Boeing 707 with interior padding
instead of windows _ but its two-hour flight can produce nausea in
even a seasoned sailor.
 &HT;    The aircraft follows a roller-coaster flight path consisting of
40 parabolic arcs, and at the top of each curve, passengers float
weightless for 25 seconds. Then come two minutes of almost double
gravity as the plane dives, levels off and begins another climb.
 &HT;    On this flight, the 21 passengers _ 19 students and two
journalists _ are getting their first and maybe their last taste of
zero gravity. Even for the unlucky ones who are sidelined by motion
sickness, it's the ride of a lifetime. But the students all have
experiments to conduct, so after the first thrill of floating up
off the floor, most of them are knuckling down to work.
 &HT;    Two members of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology team _
Mandy Chambers, an aspiring astronaut, and Onier Villarreal, a
premed student _ float over to their equipment and pull themselves
into position to start their test of weightless welding.
 &HT;    About three dozen parabolas later, though, the students realize
it's their last chance to have some gravity-free fun. One by one
they abandon their experiments and begin _ gingerly at first, then
with increasing gusto _ to attempt things they can do only in these
weightless moments, such as spinning upside down or doing midair
quadruple somersaults.
 &HT;    Chambers tries slithering ``up'' one wall, across the top, and
headfirst ``down'' the other side, and finds herself convinced that
the floor is the ceiling.
 &HT;    All too soon, the plane is rolling back into Ellington Field,
north of the Johnson Space Center, in Houston, and the sense of
letdown has begun. We stumble down the stairs into the blazing
Texas sun and line up by the plane for the obligatory group photo,
once more firmly in the grip of gravity.
 &HT;    The NASA craft went into service in 1959 to train the Mercury
Seven astronauts, and it and a successor have been used by every
U.S. astronaut since for initial training. The converted KC-135
military plane was also the stage for space scenes in ``Apollo
13,'' the first movie ever to include authentic zero-G footage
rather than simulations.
 &HT;    But this is only the second year that a shot at the unique ride
has been offered to college students across the nation, who compete
for a spot by planning zero-G research projects to be conducted on
board.
 &HT;    The program is the brainchild of NASA zero-G test director Bob
Williams, a veteran of 71,000 weightless parabolas, and University
of Texas space researcher Burke Fort. They started the program
three years ago with just a few teams from local Texas colleges,
then expanded nationwide in 1997. This year, the program flew
almost 200 students from 47 colleges and universities, and it
expects to double the number of students next year.
 &HT;    The program costs NASA about $170,000, which its managers
consider a small price for the educational benefits _ not to
mention the public-relations value of sending the students back to
their campuses full of enthusiasm.
 &HT;    For the MIT team, and most of the others, the trip to Houston
began last summer on the Internet. Some received e-mail messages
from friends or professors, others stumbled onto the NASA
zero-gravity site on their own.
 &HT;    The terms of the offer were simple: Come up with an experiment
to be carried out in weightlessness, submit a proposal to the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and teams of up to
four students could test their experiments _ and their stomachs _
aboard the vomit comet.
 &HT;    For Chambers, an MIT sophomore from Dallas, the lure of zero-G
was irresistible. Since she was 5 years old, Chambers has dreamed
of becoming an astronaut _ and more than dreamed: She earned her
pilot's license at 18, has made dozens of skydives, and spent three
summers at Space Camp, a privately run facility in Huntsville, Ala.
 &HT;    She chose her college and her major, mechanical engineering,
with an eye to NASA's future needs, and joined the Air Force ROTC
in hopes of becoming a test-flight engineer.
 &HT;    A successful bid for the vomit comet would get her in the door
of the Johnson Space Center, and she might even meet members of the
astronaut selection committee. Best of all, she would get a taste
of what it feels like to be in space _ a few minutes of real
weightlessness.
 &HT;    In September, Chambers and three fellow students, one of whom
later dropped out, set to work planning their proposal. They
started with tedious searches of Internet and library sources,
checking what kinds of experiments others had done in zero-G and
what might be possible.
 &HT;    In the end, their inspiration came from team member Hernan
Mercado's summer job. Working in a machine shop, Mercado, a
20-year-old junior from Puerto Rico, had learned a bit about arc
welding; a search of the literature showed that it was an area ripe
for exploration.
 &HT;    It would not be just abstract research; astronauts may have to
make such repairs in space, possibly in an emergency situation like
last year's air leak on Mir, the aging Russian space station. ``I
can think of a couple of Russians last year who wouldn't have
minded having a welding torch,'' Chambers says.
 &HT;    Their experiment, Mercado explains, would examine ``the quality
of the weld _ can we weld at all? _ and the way zero-gravity
affects the melt density and surface tension.'' The MIT team put
together a formal proposal and e-mailed it to NASA. Early in
December, just before first-semester exams and winter vacation,
they got word that their project had been approved.
 &HT;    That was the easy part, compared with the task they faced after
vacation. With a March deadline looming, the team got to work on
constructing the equipment they needed.
 &HT;    But first, they had to scrounge up some money. NASA would cover
the costs of the flight, but all equipment and travel expenses were
up to the students _ and figuring out how to pay for it turned out
to be a big part of the learning experience.
 &HT;    As in many a real-world research enterprise, ``Money was the
hardest part of the whole project, by far,'' Mercado says. After
weeks of begging and bargaining, the roughly $7,000 they needed to
pay for welding equipment and two weeks in Houston was eventually
collected from various MIT offices and departments; in return, the
equipment will end up in an MIT machine shop.
 &HT;    There were logistical problems as well. None of the team members
was old enough to rent a car _ almost a requirement for getting
around Houston. They decided they'd have to make do with cabs. Then
a freight company refused to ship their tank of argon gas, a
crucial part of the welding equipment. They would have to find
another argon tank in Houston.
 &HT;    But those problems were behind them, and soon forgotten, when
they pulled into Ellington Field on March 16 and joined the other
teams in the NASA hangar, where students were setting up equipment
on a series of long tables flanked by an exotic assortment of NASA
test and training aircraft.
 &HT;    Forty-eight teams had been accepted from this year's 98
applications, and some were taking the concept of team spirit to
picturesque lengths. Several teams were decked out in matching
T-shirts, including the pessimistically named ``Team Hurl'' from
George Washington University. The Pomona College team, two men and
two women, had all dyed their hair deep blue.
 &HT;    The teams' projects were almost as various: One group was
studying the use of power tools in weightlessness _ something that
astronauts assembling the International Space Station later this
year will have to deal with. For instance, what's the best way to
anchor a power drill so that it's the bit that turns, rather than
the person holding the drill?
 &HT;    Another group was looking at ways of putting out a fire in
space, something that's trickier than you might think. In zero
gravity, water from a sprinkler system, for example, wouldn't fall
``down'' but would have to be directed at the flames under
pressure.
 &HT;    Another team would observe how goldfish in a sealed tank reacted
to the absence of gravity: Would they swim cheerfully and
omnidirectionally or fishily freak out as they lost their moorings?
 &HT;    Like commercial airline passengers, the students can't fly till
they've had their safety instructions. NASA's version, though, is a
bit more complicated than the flight attendant's memorized spiel:
It starts with a full day of lectures, attendance required, on
dealing with sudden decompression and moves on to the high-altitude
chamber for a sample of actual oxygen deprivation.
 &HT;    Decompression _ a loss of the cabin air pressure that makes
high-altitude flight survivable _ can happen in any airplane, as
passengers are reminded before every flight. But on a commercial
flight, you're strapped in inches from the oxygen mask. On the
KC-135, passengers could be anywhere in the 61-foot-long empty
cabin, far from the seats in the rear, where the oxygen masks are
stowed, if a decompression occurs. They need to know how to
recognize the confusion that signals oxygen deprivation, or
hypoxia, before it's too late to respond.
 &HT;    There are other uncomfortable effects of decompression too, the
lecturers explain: Gas will expand to several times its original
volume, so it's important to avoid gas-producing foods before the
flight _ and, in the unlikely event of a decompression, not to be
shy about relieving a sudden pressure buildup.
 &HT;    Burke Fort, the lanky and genial director of the program,
explains that the altitude chamber would simulate suddenly being
transported to a 24,000-foot mountaintop. Even experienced
mountaineers require weeks of acclimatization to function at that
altitude, so being ``transported'' rapidly to such heights is
guaranteed to make anyone black out within minutes; the brain
simply can't get enough oxygen to keep functioning.
 &HT;    The trick _ and the purpose of the training _ is to recognize
the symptoms of impending hypoxic unconsciousness in time to get
one's oxygen mask on.
 &HT;    The chamber itself _ World War II vintage, and ``older than most
of your parents,'' as one instructor points out to the students _
is a big steel cylinder that looks a bit like a used fuel tank.
 &HT;    Originally used to train pilots, since the 1950s it has been a
testing ground for every U.S. astronaut from the Mercury and Apollo
pioneers through today's space shuttlers, as well as anyone
(including Tom Hanks and the rest of the Apollo 13 cast and crew)
planning to fly on the vomit comet.
 &HT;    On the morning of the flight, everyone assembles early at the
Ellington hangar, nervous, excited, and just a little scared.
First, there's a round of preflight briefings, and everyone is
issued a Scop-Dex capsule _ standard issue for astronauts before a
flight. It's a combination of scopolamine, to combat nausea, and
dexedrine, to counteract the drowsiness scopolamine causes. It's
optional, but everyone agrees that it drastically improves the odds
of keeping down your breakfast.
 &HT;    The students get one last stern warning about keeping track of
their feet as they move around in zero gravity. ``If you kick me, I
will kick you back,'' Williams says gruffly, ``and it will hurt.''
Then, finally, it's time to strap into the seats in the plane's
rear and prepare for the unknown.
 &HT;    The takeoff, though smooth and uneventful, already has an eerie
feel; with no windows nearby, you can't quite tell when you've left
the ground. Once in the air, the student teams scramble into
position next to their experimental apparatus, all well padded and
reinforced to protect both people and equipment against unforeseen
collisions when the gravity changes.
 &HT;    Most people, it turns out, get sick during the minutes of
increased gravity, not while floating weightless. ``I'm really not
feeling well, really not,'' says one student _ and the zero-G
hasn't even started yet.
 &HT;    Then, abruptly, the heavy weight lifts, and the students begin
to drift slowly up from their places on the floor. Yelps, whoops,
and laughter fill the cabin.
 &HT;    ``This is by far the coolest thing I've ever done,'' says one
grinning George Washington student. Some students begin right away
to experiment with the new sensation, trying aerial somersaults and
spins. Others are more cautious, just letting themselves drift a
little or grabbing straps to hold themselves down.
 &HT;    After a few parabolas of getting used to the new freedom, and
trying to get stomachs back down out of throats, the students
settle in to do what they came here for. Most of the experiments
deal with basic engineering, chemical reactions or fluid dynamics,
but a few are more offbeat.
 &HT;    One team, from the San Francisco Art Institute, is experimenting
with painting and dancing in weightlessness. As Fort explains, such
creative endeavors might be important for maintaining psychological
balance during long-duration space missions, such as a six-month
flight to Mars.
 &HT;    MIT's welding is less glamorous, though perhaps of more
practical value. The students find it's harder than they expected
to hold themselves in position while welding, but the steel welds
they complete appear smooth and strong _ potentially good news for
some future astronaut in a leaky craft.
 &HT;    And then, suddenly, it's all over; our feet are planted on the
floor again, the plane heads home, and zero-G is just a memory.
 &HT;    A few veterans of the vomit comet, inspired by the experience,
may reappear at the Johnson Space Center in years to come, perhaps
to train for missions on the shuttle, the space station, or even
the first human flight to Mars. But even those who will never
return are taking home, along with their used equipment and
hard-won research data, memories and photos of a truly exotic trip.
 &HT;    And stories they'll be telling for the rest of their lives.

though the floor, like the rest of our aircraft's interior, is well
padded, so Rickard and the other instructors are keeping a vigilant
eye on the suspended novices.
 &HT;    With a quick kick to the ceiling, I propel my legs back down
below head level _ just in the nick of time.
 &HT;    As ``down'' abruptly reasserts its existence, I crumple to the
floor, more or less feet first, and settle in for a couple of
minutes of double-strength gravity. Keeping track of which way the
floor lies is just one of the bewildering tasks that confront the
passengers on NASA's reduced-gravity test aircraft, otherwise known
as the ``vomit comet.''
 &HT;    There's nothing stomach-churning about the plane itself _ it's
essentially like a commercial Boeing 707 with interior padding
instead of windows _ but its two-hour flight can produce nausea in
even a seasoned sailor.
 &HT;    The aircraft follows a roller-coaster flight path consisting of
40 parabolic arcs, and at the top of each curve, passengers float
weightless for 25 seconds. Then come two minutes of almost double
gravity as the plane dives, levels off and begins another climb.
 &HT;    On this flight, the 21 passengers _ 19 students and two
journalists _ are getting their first and maybe their last taste of
zero gravity. Even for the unlucky ones who are sidelined by motion
sickness, it's the ride of a lifetime. But the students all have
experiments to conduct, so after the first thrill of floating up
off the floor, most of them are knuckling down to work.
 &HT;    Two members of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology team _
Mandy Chambers, an aspiring astronaut, and Onier Villarreal, a
premed student _ float over to their equipment and pull themselves
into position to start their test of weightless welding.
 &HT;    About three dozen parabolas later, though, the students realize
it's their last chance to have some gravity-free fun. One by one
they abandon their experiments and begin _ gingerly at first, then
with increasing gusto _ to attempt things they can do only in these
weightless moments, such as spinning upside down or doing midair
quadruple somersaults.
 &HT;    Chambers tries slithering ``up'' one wall, across the top, and
headfirst ``down'' the other side, and finds herself convinced that
the floor is the ceiling.
 &HT;    All too soon, the plane is rolling back into Ellington Field,
north of the Johnson Space Center, in Houston, and the sense of
letdown has begun. We stumble down the stairs into the blazing
Texas sun and line up by the plane for the obligatory group photo,
once more firmly in the grip of gravity.
 &HT;    The NASA craft went into service in 1959 to train the Mercury
Seven astronauts, and it and a successor have been used by every
U.S. astronaut since for initial training. The converted KC-135
military plane was also the stage for space scenes in ``Apollo
13,'' the first movie ever to include authentic zero-G footage
rather than simulations.
 &HT;    But this is only the second year that a shot at the unique ride
has been offered to college students across the nation, who compete
for a spot by planning zero-G research projects to be conducted on
board.
 &HT;    The program is the brainchild of NASA zero-G test director Bob
Williams, a veteran of 71,000 weightless parabolas, and University
of Texas space researcher Burke Fort. They started the program
three years ago with just a few teams from local Texas colleges,
then expanded nationwide in 1997. This year, the program flew
almost 200 students from 47 colleges and universities, and it
expects to double the number of students next year.
 &HT;    The program costs NASA about $170,000, which its managers
consider a small price for the educational benefits _ not to
mention the public-relations value of sending the students back to
their campuses full of enthusiasm.
 &HT;    For the MIT team, and most of the others, the trip to Houston
began last summer on the Internet. Some received e-mail messages
from friends or professors, others stumbled onto the NASA
zero-gravity site on their own.
 &HT;    The terms of the offer were simple: Come up with an experiment
to be carried out in weightlessness, submit a proposal to the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and teams of up to
four students could test their experiments _ and their stomachs _
aboard the vomit comet.
 &HT;    For Chambers, an MIT sophomore from Dallas, the lure of zero-G
was irresistible. Since she was 5 years old, Chambers has dreamed
of becoming an astronaut _ and more than dreamed: She earned her
pilot's license at 18, has made dozens of skydives, and spent three
summers at Space Camp, a privately run facility in Huntsville, Ala.
 &HT;    She chose her college and her major, mechanical engineering,
with an eye to NASA's future needs, and joined the Air Force ROTC
in hopes of becoming a test-flight engineer.
 &HT;    A successful bid for the vomit comet would get her in the door
of the Johnson Space Center, and she might even meet members of the
astronaut selection committee. Best of all, she would get a taste
of what it feels like to be in space _ a few minutes of real
weightlessness.
 &HT;    In September, Chambers and three fellow students, one of whom
later dropped out, set to work planning their proposal. They
started with tedious searches of Internet and library sources,
checking what kinds of experiments others had done in zero-G and
what might be possible.
 &HT;    In the end, their inspiration came from team member Hernan
Mercado's summer job. Working in a machine shop, Mercado, a
20-year-old junior from Puerto Rico, had learned a bit about arc
welding; a search of the literature showed that it was an area ripe
for exploration.
 &HT;    It would not be just abstract research; astronauts may have to
make such repairs in space, possibly in an emergency situation like
last year's air leak on Mir, the aging Russian space station. ``I
can think of a couple of Russians last year who wouldn't have
minded having a welding torch,'' Chambers says.
 &HT;    Their experiment, Mercado explains, would examine ``the quality
of the weld _ can we weld at all? _ and the way zero-gravity
affects the melt density and surface tension.'' The MIT team put
together a formal proposal and e-mailed it to NASA. Early in
December, just before first-semester exams and winter vacation,
they got word that their project had been approved.
 &HT;    That was the easy part, compared with the task they faced after
vacation. With a March deadline looming, the team got to work on
constructing the equipment they needed.
 &HT;    But first, they had to scrounge up some money. NASA would cover
the costs of the flight, but all equipment and travel expenses were
up to the students _ and figuring out how to pay for it turned out
to be a big part of the learning experience.
 &HT;    As in many a real-world research enterprise, ``Money was the
hardest part of the whole project, by far,'' Mercado says. After
weeks of begging and bargaining, the roughly $7,000 they needed to
pay for welding equipment and two weeks in Houston was eventually
collected from various MIT offices and departments; in return, the
equipment will end up in an MIT machine shop.
 &HT;    There were logistical problems as well. None of the team members
was old enough to rent a car _ almost a requirement for getting
around Houston. They decided they'd have to make do with cabs. Then
a freight company refused to ship their tank of argon gas, a
crucial part of the welding equipment. They would have to find
another argon tank in Houston.
 &HT;    But those problems were behind them, and soon forgotten, when
they pulled into Ellington Field on March 16 and joined the other
teams in the NASA hangar, where students were setting up equipment
on a series of long tables flanked by an exotic assortment of NASA
test and training aircraft.
 &HT;    Forty-eight teams had been accepted from this year's 98
applications, and some were taking the concept of team spirit to
picturesque lengths. Several teams were decked out in matching
T-shirts, including the pessimistically named ``Team Hurl'' from
George Washington University. The Pomona College team, two men and
two women, had all dyed their hair deep blue.
 &HT;    The teams' projects were almost as various: One group was
studying the use of power tools in weightlessness _ something that
astronauts assembling the International Space Station later this
year will have to deal with. For instance, what's the best way to
anchor a power drill so that it's the bit that turns, rather than
the person holding the drill?
 &HT;    Another group was looking at ways of putting out a fire in
space, something that's trickier than you might think. In zero
gravity, water from a sprinkler system, for example, wouldn't fall
``down'' but would have to be directed at the flames under
pressure.
 &HT;    Another team would observe how goldfish in a sealed tank reacted
to the absence of gravity: Would they swim cheerfully and
omnidirectionally or fishily freak out as they lost their moorings?
 &HT;    Like commercial airline passengers, the students can't fly till
they've had their safety instructions. NASA's version, though, is a
bit more complicated than the flight attendant's memorized spiel:
It starts with a full day of lectures, attendance required, on
dealing with sudden decompression and moves on to the high-altitude
chamber for a sample of actual oxygen deprivation.
 &HT;    Decompression _ a loss of the cabin air pressure that makes
high-altitude flight survivable _ can happen in any airplane, as
passengers are reminded before every flight. But on a commercial
flight, you're strapped in inches from the oxygen mask. On the
KC-135, passengers could be anywhere in the 61-foot-long empty
cabin, far from the seats in the rear, where the oxygen masks are
stowed, if a decompression occurs. They need to know how to
recognize the confusion that signals oxygen deprivation, or
hypoxia, before it's too late to respond.
 &HT;    There are other uncomfortable effects of decompression too, the
lecturers explain: Gas will expand to several times its original
volume, so it's important to avoid gas-producing foods before the
flight _ and, in the unlikely event of a decompression, not to be
shy about relieving a sudden pressure buildup.
 &HT;    Burke Fort, the lanky and genial director of the program,
explains that the altitude chamber would simulate suddenly being
transported to a 24,000-foot mountaintop. Even experienced
mountaineers require weeks of acclimatization to function at that
altitude, so being ``transported'' rapidly to such heights is
guaranteed to make anyone black out within minutes; the brain
simply can't get enough oxygen to keep functioning.
 &HT;    The trick _ and the purpose of the training _ is to recognize
the symptoms of impending hypoxic unconsciousness in time to get
one's oxygen mask on.
 &HT;    The chamber itself _ World War II vintage, and ``older than most
of your parents,'' as one instructor points out to the students _
is a big steel cylinder that looks a bit like a used fuel tank.
 &HT;    Originally used to train pilots, since the 1950s it has been a
testing ground for every U.S. astronaut from the Mercury and Apollo
pioneers through today's space shuttlers, as well as anyone
(including Tom Hanks and the rest of the Apollo 13 cast and crew)
planning to fly on the vomit comet.
 &HT;    On the morning of the flight, everyone assembles early at the
Ellington hangar, nervous, excited, and just a little scared.
First, there's a round of preflight briefings, and everyone is
issued a Scop-Dex capsule _ standard issue for astronauts before a
flight. It's a combination of scopolamine, to combat nausea, and
dexedrine, to counteract the drowsiness scopolamine causes. It's
optional, but everyone agrees that it drastically improves the odds
of keeping down your breakfast.
 &HT;    The students get one last stern warning about keeping track of
their feet as they move around in zero gravity. ``If you kick me, I
will kick you back,'' Williams says gruffly, ``and it will hurt.''
Then, finally, it's time to strap into the seats in the plane's
rear and prepare for the unknown.
 &HT;    The takeoff, though smooth and uneventful, already has an eerie
feel; with no windows nearby, you can't quite tell when you've left
the ground. Once in the air, the student teams scramble into
position next to their experimental apparatus, all well padded and
reinforced to protect both people and equipment against unforeseen
collisions when the gravity changes.
 &HT;    Most people, it turns out, get sick during the minutes of
increased gravity, not while floating weightless. ``I'm really not
feeling well, really not,'' says one student _ and the zero-G
hasn't even started yet.
 &HT;    Then, abruptly, the heavy weight lifts, and the students begin
to drift slowly up from their places on the floor. Yelps, whoops,
and laughter fill the cabin.
 &HT;    ``This is by far the coolest thing I've ever done,'' says one
grinning George Washington student. Some students begin right away
to experiment with the new sensation, trying aerial somersaults and
spins. Others are more cautious, just letting themselves drift a
little or grabbing straps to hold themselves down.
 &HT;    After a few parabolas of getting used to the new freedom, and
trying to get stomachs back down out of throats, the students
settle in to do what they came here for. Most of the experiments
deal with basic engineering, chemical reactions or fluid dynamics,
but a few are more offbeat.
 &HT;    One team, from the San Francisco Art Institute, is experimenting
with painting and dancing in weightlessness. As Fort explains, such
creative endeavors might be important for maintaining psychological
balance during long-duration space missions, such as a six-month
flight to Mars.
 &HT;    MIT's welding is less glamorous, though perhaps of more
practical value. The students find it's harder than they expected
to hold themselves in position while welding, but the steel welds
they complete appear smooth and strong _ potentially good news for
some future astronaut in a leaky craft.
 &HT;    And then, suddenly, it's all over; our feet are planted on the
floor again, the plane heads home, and zero-G is just a memory.
 &HT;    A few veterans of the vomit comet, inspired by the experience,
may reappear at the Johnson Space Center in years to come, perhaps
to train for missions on the shuttle, the space station, or even
the first human flight to Mars. But even those who will never
return are taking home, along with their used equipment and
hard-won research data, memories and photos of a truly exotic trip.
 &HT;    And stories they'll be telling for the rest of their lives.

SAN FRANCISCO VOTERS REJECT MAYOR'S PLANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CHUCK FINNIE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ San Francisco voters rejected Mayor Willie
Brown's plans for the former naval base at Treasure Island and
public financing for his protocol office.
</P>
<P>
   Proposition K, which urges the Board of Supervisors to kill a
Brown-created development authority for Treasure Island, won with
56 percent of the vote Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Proposition F, which would end public financing for the mayor's
protocol office and impose firm rules on how space in a refurbished
City Hall is used, was approved by 59 percent of the voters.
</P>
<P>
   Both ballot measures were sponsored by state Sen. Quentin Kopp,
an Independent, and Clint Reilly, the political consultant turned
real estate investor who is considering a bid for mayor in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Treasure Island power grab by the mayor was seen
through by the voters,'' Reilly said. ``It ought to be a signal to
voters who are disenchanted with city management by the mayor that
they have ways to make their disenchantment heard.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Kopp: ``Both measures represent voters' dismay at the
mayor's overreaching.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown said voters had never been told the whole story about the
measures' contents and that it would be a mistake to draw any
conclusions about the vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``The measures are as well-disguised as was Prop. 209,'' Brown
said, referring to the 1996 state ballot measure that ended
affirmative action in government contracting and school admissions.
``Many people who voted for 209 said, `I didn't mean that. I didn't
mean to block kids from going to the University of California.'''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to Proposition F, the mayor said, ``I'm sure there'll
be many people, if it goes badly, who will say, `I didn't intend to
keep child care centers out of City Hall. I didn't intend to block
handicapped access to City Hall. No, that was not my intention. My
intention was to keep it from being a party palace.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, it's not a party palace, it's what the liars of the
world call a party palace.''
</P>
<P>
   When Brown ran for mayor in 1995, he said he would build a Monte
Carlo-style casino on Treasure Island after the Navy left. He
backed away from the statement days later, but the damage was done.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of City Hall, the mayor originally said he wanted to
bring hundreds fewer city workers back to the building after the
restoration, to leave more space for celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Board of Supervisors, objecting to extra rent the
city would pay to house displaced workers, nixed the plan. Brown
backed away from it, too.
</P>
<P>
   Proposition K calls for repeal of the Treasure Island
Development Authority, a nonprofit entity incorporated by the mayor
and governed by his appointees, which has the power to make
redevelopment decisions for the former Navy base.
</P>
<P>
   But the measure was put on the ballot as a policy statement and
requires the supervisors to pass an ordinance to give it the force
of law.
</P>
<P>
   Board of Supervisors President Barbara Kaufman said the
Brown-created authority was a logical approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have a hard time voting to repeal it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Proposition F, however, is an ordinance that binds the board and
the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   It calls for an end to the use of tax dollars to pay for
party-throwing, gift-giving and other activities of the mayor's
protocol office.

   In times past, they suffered indignities offstage and adulation
onstage. Today, the public in Europe and America expects that there
should be at least one great female African-American opera singer _
almost as if there is a permanent niche to be filled.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas-based author Rosalyn Story, who is also a violinist in
the Fort Worth Symphony, outlined the succession of
African-American divas in her 1990 book ``And So I Sing:
African-American Divas of Opera and Concert.'' Their stories range
from the lonely, often degrading life of the pioneers to the
triumphal international careers of today's stars.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, soprano Sissieretta
Jones (1869-1933) was hailed as ``the Black Patti,'' in comparison
to the leading Italian soprano of the day. She sang for presidents,
drew crowds as large as 75,000 for concerts, performed Dvorak's
music with the composer conducting and was hailed in London and
Berlin. However, because of her race, she was never hired for a
legitimate operatic production; she died of cancer, largely
forgotten and in poverty, in a hospital in Providence, R.I.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia-born contralto Marian Anderson (1897-1993) won fame
in Europe in the early 1930s, then blazed onto the American concert
scene in 1935. She won her place in the history books in 1939, when
the Daughters of the American Revolution rejected impresario Sol
Hurok's request to book her for a concert at Constitution Hall in
Washington, D.C. In a striking gesture that was one of several
roots of the civil rights movement, she sang the concert, at the
urging of first lady Eleanor Roosevelt, from the steps of the
Lincoln Memorial. In 1955, she made history again as the first
African-American to sing at the Metropolitan Opera.
</P>
<P>
   With the color barrier broken by Anderson, Mississippi-born,
Juilliard-trained Leontyne Price (born 1927), became the undisputed
leading dramatic soprano of the 1960s and 1970s, favorite of
concert and operatic audiences around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Although the field is now rich with African-American operatic
talent, only two have emerged to the same level of household
recognition as Price. Ohio-born lyric coloratura soprano Kathleen
Battle, 49, is known for an incredibly sweet voice and incredibly
difficult temperament; Georgia-born dramatic soprano Jessye Norman,
52, continues to overwhelm audiences with the power of her voice,
her unfailing musical intellect and her imperial stage presence.
</P>
<P>
   Although she emerged too late for inclusion in Story's book,
mezzo-soprano Denyce Graves, in light of her successful appearances
as Bizet's Carmen and as Saint-Saens' Dalila at the Metropolitan
Opera, is a good candidate to join the succession. She is also
blessed with a charismatic, media-friendly personality. Graves, who
sang ``Carmen'' in Dallas in 1996, will make her Fort Worth debut
Friday night at the Nancy Lee and Perry R. Bass Performance Hall.

   CIR-ATM-SAFEGUARDS (Undated) _ It is a fantasy for modern times:
You ask an automated teller machine for $100 from your account and
like a slot machine showing three cherries, it just keeps spitting

manufacturers say. The machines contain a series of safeguards to

<P>
   EMILY-POST-STAMP (Undated) _ In her 1923 classic book
``Etiquette,'' Emily Post observed that ``older people invariably
feel that the younger generation is speeding swiftly on the road to
perdition.'' And so it is with stamps. Last week, the first
domestic image ever to appear on a stamp was unveiled, heralding
Emily Post's ``Etiquette.'' The stamp _ a 1920s place-setting with
Lafayette Towle silver, a goblet and hand-painted Copeland Spode
China plate _ is elegant and extremely proper. But beneath that
white damask tablecloth lurks a radical shift in the design and
subject matter of the United States postage stamp, from America's
calling card to adhesive pop icon. By Patricia Leigh-Brown.

<P>
   GULFCOAST-TV-TOWN (Seaside, Fla.) _ Where do you go to shoot a
movie about a perfectly ordinary American whose whole life,
unbeknownst to him, is a scripted show for television? Ideally
you'd find a place that looked so stereotypically small-town
America, so thoroughly front-porched and picket-fenced, that it
could pass for a movie set. This is what the producers of ``The
Truman Show,'' which opens Friday, were looking for _ and what they
found in Seaside, Fla. By Michael Pollan.

<P>
   While the mobile computer industry seeks new market niches _ the
big PC companions being one of the latest _ standard and
subnotebooks are continuing to shrink and add new features.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the most recent products are subnotebooks by
Hewlett-Packard and Sony. But while their profiles are slim, their
prices aren't: Hewlett-Packard's Sojourn is $5,799, while Sony's
VAIO 505 (available in July) will be priced at $1,999.
</P>
<P>
   Each is less than an inch thick and encased in a lightly tinted
magnesium alloy case, which gives extra rigidity and keeps each
model's weight to around three pounds _ until the user starts
slapping on extras and heavy longer-life batteries.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, money buys power, which means shorter battery life.
The Sojourn's 233-megahertz Pentium processor runs faster than the
VAIO 505's 200-megahertz Pentium chip. Sony predicts up to three
hours of continuous use from its rechargeable battery, while
Hewlett-Packard reports half as much.
</P>
<P>
   The VAIO 505 has ports to attach an external CD-ROM or floppy
drive; an optional pair of speakers snap on either side of the
10.4-inch display, giving it a decidedly Mouseketeer-like
silhouette. Also unusual is the touch pad, which can be written on
with a stylus to sign letters or scribble in simple drawings or
notes.
</P>
<P>
   The Sojourn has a 12.1-inch display, and its features include a
multimedia ``slice,'' a base that snaps onto the unit's underside.
It also has a pair of built-in stereo speakers that pop out on
either side, floppy and CD-ROM drives, and the usual ports for
connecting peripherals.
</P>
<P>
   Another snap-on base _ a $799 battery that extends usage to six
hours, increasing the total price to $6,598 _ completes the
initially lean profile, swelling the multilayered Sojourn's total
weight to a hefty six pounds. So much for keeping things light and
easy.

WINDOWS 95 AND ITS SMALLER SIBLING 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JOE HUTSKO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Microsoft's colossal Windows 95 and its two-year-old little
brother, Windows CE, do essentially the same thing: act as the
computer's central nervous system and traffic cop, determining how
all other software will operate.
</P>
<P>
   Windows 95 and its forthcoming upgrade, Windows 98, run on
desktop and notebook computers with lots of moving parts: CD-ROM
drives, mice and so on. Windows CE runs on computers with no moving
parts except, in certain models, their keyboards.
</P>
<P>
   It first showed up on handheld computers, then palmtop
computers, and it is now running on the new PC companions, which
look like tiny notebook computers but are really just handhelds
with larger keyboards and color screens. Instead of a mouse, the CE
devices get their on-screen cues from a penlike stylus that is used
for tapping icons and menus on touch-sensitive displays.
</P>
<P>
   Like the machines it runs on, Windows 95 is big and able to work
with a bunch of complicated programs at the same time; Windows CE,
on the other hand, is small, simple and able to pay attention to
only one or two modest tasks at a time.
</P>
<P>
   Although Microsoft boasts that Windows CE has a Windows 95-like
interface, Windows CE is a separate operating system that includes
only a few pared-down portions of code borrowed from its full-grown
sibling. The Windows CE handhelds cannot run Windows 95 programs
like Adobe Premiere for Windows 95 or the 3-D shooting game Quake.
</P>
<P>
   Windows CE is shipped with a core suite of pared-down Microsoft
applications, including Pocket Word, Pocket Excel, Pocket Internet
Explorer and Pocket Outlook. Each can exchange information with its
desktop counterpart, though none of the programs will actually run
on a Windows 95 computer.
</P>
<P>
   But conversions of files are not complete. A desktop Word
document dragged over to Pocket Word keeps only minimal text
formatting, like the choice of font and style, and only bare-bones
outlining.
</P>
<P>
   While computers running Windows 95 can have either a few
megabytes or many gigabytes of hard disk space for loading programs
and storing files, the main Windows CE programs have a scant 4 to
16 megabytes of space for adding extra programs and storing
information.
</P>
<P>
   While the hard disk in a typical home PC running Windows 95 is
big enough to store the Bible, the complete works of Shakespeare
and an entire encyclopedia's worth of text and pictures, Windows CE
has room to store the text of four or five novels.
</P>
<P>
   Windows CE is showing up inside things other than computers,
including car radios that respond to voice commands and a
forthcoming video game system from Sega called Dreamcast.
</P>
<P>
   One thing both operating systems have in common is Microsoft,
which earns a licensing fee for every machine they run on, be it a
PC, handheld computer, car radio or, someday, a microwave oven.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Goldilocks would have had no end of criticism for portable
computing devices. They're either too big or too little. They're
either too smart (read: short battery life because the bigger
processors eat electricity) or too dumb (read: stripped-down
functions).
</P>
<P>
   And manufacturers never cease to try to please Goldilocks. There
are mobile computers large and small, from no-frills travelers to
big alternatives to desktop machines. There are various personal
digital record keepers and palmtop computers, none big enough for
comfortable typing.
</P>
<P>
   There is the lone Toshiba Libretto, a tiny full-fledged computer
with an even tinier keyboard. And now, in the continuous birth and
blending of categories, there is something else.
</P>
<P>
   The analysts and companies call it one of the PC companions, a
category that includes palmtops and handhelds. Like the other PC
companions, it's more than an organizer, less than a notebook and
of real use only to people who already have a full-fledged Windows
computer (most PC companions are not Macintosh-friendly).
</P>
<P>
   Like the early PC companions, which have keyboards too small to
do anything but hunt and peck, the new companions include word
processors, e-mail programs, Web surfing ability and more. And they
are meant to synchronize data with primary computers through cable
connections. Printing is most conveniently done via the desktop,
although they can print directly to a printer if it has an infrared
port.
</P>
<P>
   What's new is that these companions are bigger, with keyboards
large enough for touch typing. What to call them is a puzzle _
little sisters, minimicro-almost-notebooks, the new thing. For lack
of a better term, let's call them big PC companions. Three of them
are available now.
</P>
<P>
   Mike McGuire, a senior analyst who studies mobile computers for
Dataquest, a market research company in San Jose, Calif., that
specializes in technology, called the latest PC companions ``very
important precursors'' to the size and shape of mobile PCs to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not the user's primary computer but a companion to it,
like a snapshot of the desktop PC for taking work and presentations
away from the office, on trips or to work or at home, without all
the hassles of a notebook,'' McGuire said. ``With prices around
$900, they make an awful lot of sense.''
</P>
<P>
   The three big PC companions _ sold by NEC, Hitachi and LG
Electronics _ cost less than $1,000 and are under two pounds. They
are a little bigger than a VHS videocassette, measuring slightly
more than an inch thick and about 10 inches by 5 inches.
</P>
<P>
   They offer color screens that are wider than the screens of
their sibling handheld PCs, batteries that last up to 10 hours and
keyboards large enough for many people to type on comfortably.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the keyboards, the new PC companions are an
alternative for frustrated notebook users like Vince Broady,
editorial director of Gamespot, a Web-based magazine in San
Francisco. He said that the notebook he bought last year for $4,000
``was expensive and had extremely short battery life _ less than an
hour'' and that it also had frequent problems with its CD-ROM,
pointer, hard drive and modem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I barely got any work done and eventually stopped using it,
except to play `You Don't Know Jack' at parties,'' he said. ``That
was the end of the line for major notebook purchases for me.
They're too expensive, too quickly outdated and too unreliable.''
</P>
<P>
   Ben Goetter, principal programmer at Angry Graycat Designs,
based in Seattle, also prefers a big PC companion to a notebook.
``I prefer it to a notebook for its cost, instant-on feature,
battery life, and relative ruggedness,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The new big PC companions run a less powerful operating system,
so they have less powerful programs and functions, offering only a
fraction of the performance of notebooks or desktop PCs. Based on
Microsoft Windows CE, a bantam operating system that draws its look
and feel from its big brother, Windows 95, the big PC companions
come with drastically scaled-down programs that capture the basics
of what most people do on their desktop PCs.
</P>
<P>
   For some, like Broady, the compromise is acceptable. He bought a
big PC companion after he re-evaluated his needs. ``They're pretty
basic,'' Broady said. ``e-mail, word processing, Web browsing.''
But the big PC companions, with Windows CE, do those things on a
slower, smaller scale than machines with Windows 95.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, users with PCs running local area network, or LAN,
software based on Novell Netware report problems with getting their
PC companions and desktop computers to speak the same language.
Most complain that the CE software necessary to link the big and
little computers together conflicts with Netware.
</P>
<P>
   Only after complicated tweaking by network administrators do the
two get along, and they still have some problems.
</P>
<P>
   Discussing their troubles on the newsgroup
microsoft.public.windowsce, frustrated users accused Microsoft of
dragging its feet in providing Novell-friendly support for the
popular network software because it competes with Microsoft's own
office networking software.
</P>
<P>
   The product manager for Microsoft Windows CE, Phil Holden, said
in an interview that Netware support was in the works, but he would
not say when it would be available.
</P>
<P>
   A partial solution is offered by a company called River Run
Software (www.riverrun. com), which sells add-on programs that let
the CE-based PC companions dial in to a Novell-based network and
share information over a modem connection.
</P>
<P>
   The machines have clear limits. John Carter, a computer
technician for United Parcel Service, said he preferred the fuller
features and performance of what he called a ``real'' notebook in a
PC-companion-size package. ``I would occasionally read
100-plus-kilobyte text files and it would take forever to load them
into the CE machine,'' Carter said.
</P>
<P>
   He prefers the Toshiba Libretto, called a micronotebook, which
runs Windows 95. It is about the size of the new big PC companions
and is ``more functional than a CE machine,'' Carter said. It can
handle common peripherals.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   McGuire, of Dataquest, predicts that by 2001, around eight
million PC companions will be sold worldwide. Will they take a big
bite out of the notebook market? ``I don't think so,'' McGuire
said. ``Notebook users create a lot of data, and some make it their
primary computer.'' Broady expressed a similar verdict: ``A lot of
people will still buy notebooks to replace their existing
desktops.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, McGuire said that positive responses to the new big PC
companions would ``put the fear of God'' in the makers of the more
expensive notebooks as the gap between each category's features
narrows. As the CE-based devices get larger and more useful,
vendors are continuing to slim down the proportions of the
full-power notebooks as prices continue to rise.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Hewlett-Packard's magnesium-cased 3.2-pound
Sojourn, which can run Windows 95, NT or the forthcoming Windows 98
operating system, is less than an inch thick and has a full-size
keyboard and large screen. But it costs nearly $6,000 and runs only
one and half hours on the built-in battery.
</P>
<P>
   An optional battery ``slice,'' which is like an added base for
the machine, is supposed to add four and a half more hours of use _
plus an additional two pounds to the total weight.
</P>
<P>
   The Libretto models, which cost $699 to $2,499, also run Windows
95. While a PC companion's battery lasts up to 10 hours, the
Libretto runs for about 2 hours. McGuire says this may contradict
what most people would expect for battery life in the small
Libretto. ``With these ultraportables, people think, `Wow, better
battery life,' but the smaller size means smaller batteries.''
</P>
<P>
   Curiously, the keyboard on the more robust Libretto is smaller
than the keyboards on the new, less capable big PC companions. Yet
that doesn't bother Carter. ``I don't see myself needing to type
much on the Libretto,'' Carter said. He intends to use his new
little computer to stay on top of e-mail, get access to the Web,
work with spreadsheets and lists of contacts, and ``play an
occasional game,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   But Broady said, ``I'd considered the Libretto, but the keyboard
was too small for me to type at anything approaching normal
speed.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for NEC, Kristin Fabos, said the company's
engineers had determined that ``the smallest possible key pitch you
can type on is 15.5 millimeters'' _ a reference to the space
between one key's center and the next _ and had added an extra
millimeter to the company's big PC companion keyboard just to be
safe.
</P>
<P>
   After the first few hours with his new big PC companion, a
Hitachi HPW-200EC, Broady said, ``I can already type at about 80
percent normal speed.''
</P>
<P>
   His enthusiasm wasn't limited to the keyboard. ``The styling is
really cool,'' he said. ``And I'm `connected' to it already in a
way that I haven't been since my first Mac _ the original model.''
</P>
<P>
   A close look at the first three big PC companions turns up their
pros and cons.
</P>
<P>
   All three devices are priced at $899. The NEC Mobile Pro 750C
(www.necnow. com) has a silvery finish and squarer edges. The
Hitachi HPW-200EC (www.hitachi.com) and LG Electronics' Phenom
Ultra (www.lgeus.com) are identical, except for their names and
labels; their keys are slightly larger than the NEC Mobile Pro.
</P>
<P>
   All three offer the same basic programs, though the Mobile Pro
also includes a program called Calligrapher, by Paragraph PI
(www.paragraph.com), for converting handwritten words scribbled on
the screen to text. The devices have backlighted color
touch-screens that measure just over eight diagonal inches and have
640-by-240-pixel resolution.
</P>
<P>
   They are large enough to show about 16 lines of a full-width
word processing document in a 10-point font. All include styluses
for tapping the screen to select icons and menus.
</P>
<P>
   Because the keyboards are more accommodating than those on a
micronotebook and will encourage real typing, McGuire, of
Dataquest, wonders if the stops and starts necessitated by the use
of a stylus _ it is picked up to tap the screen then put down to
resume typing _ is a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll work to a degree,'' he said, ``but the cost and power
requirements are coming down enough to add touch pads,''
electronically sensitive surfaces that are activated by touch. That
would mean smoother typing.
</P>
<P>
   The vendors promise up to 10 hours of battery life from their
units, due in large part to the fact that they have none of the
vulnerable, power-hungry moving parts found in ordinary notebooks,
things like hard and floppy disks and fans to keep the processors
from overheating. And unlike notebooks, which often make the user
wait up to a minute for them to ``wake up,'' the CE devices turn on
instantly.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of having a floppy or CD-ROM drive, each of the big PC
companions connects to, and utterly depends on, a desktop Windows
PC for loading new programs and sharing information. The connection
is made with either a cable, a wireless infrared port or an
Ethernet PC card wired to an office network.
</P>
<P>
   A program called Active Sync keeps a watchful eye on both the
small computer and the big one _ as long as they are connected _
swapping bits back and forth to insure that both share the same
data on contacts, schedules, tasks, e-mail, documents and
spreadsheets.
</P>
<P>
   That makes it easy for the user to coordinate between the
desktop computer and the portable, which illustrates an important
point: a PC companion is just that, a limited partner to a user's
existing desktop or notebook PC, whereas notebooks, despite their
small size, are full-fledged PCs.
</P>
<P>
   Broady acknowledges that the big PC companion's dependency on
desktops may count as a small strike against it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure at some point I'll wish I could run a standard PC
program like a game or that I had a built-in floppy drive,'' he
said. He also expressed some concern about the trend toward Web
sites with complex designs that may require features the big PC
companions lack.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Broady is already sold on the devices. He figures that
he can buy the next three generations of Windows CE machines for
the cost of a notebook. ``And since I like to shop for
technology,'' he said, ``that's a big advantage.''

<P>
   Many homeowners find it difficult to maintain the borders around
the patio, driveway and sidewalks. Frequently, the lawn overgrows
onto these surfaces, narrowing them and making them look unkempt
and uncared for. The usual way to service these areas is with an
edger that trims and cuts back the grass to form a neat, defined
edge.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, there are other solutions to the edging problem.
Most garden and home centers sell rolls of edging material made of
metal or plastic. This material is economical and easy to install,
but it is flimsy and many need to be replaced every few years.
</P>
<P>
   Well, there are other options. You can, for example, put down
wood or masonry materials to emphasize and define the edges. You
can also put in plants that look good but do not encroach upon the
paved surfaces. All of these solutions require an initial
installation effort but afterward, they will require less upkeep
than a grass edge demands.
</P>
<P>
   Creating a border of wood trim involves implanting rot-resistant
boards into the soil adjacent to the paved surface. Bury them deep
enough so the top surface is flush with the ground.
</P>
<P>
   It's best to anchor the boards so that heaves in the underlying
soil do not pull them away from the pavement. There are two easy
methods of anchoring. You can drill a hole through the boards (one
hole at each end) and drive a 2-foot long, 1/2-inch rebar (concrete
reinforcing bars) through it into the ground. You can also drive a
2-foot-long stake, made of 1 by 2 inch pressure-treated wood, next
to the ends of each board. Secure the stakes by driving nails
through them into the sides of the border boards.
</P>
<P>
   Cedar and heart-redwood are naturally rot-resistant and make
attractive borders. Unfortunately, both are expensive.
Pressure-treated lumber is less attractive but more economical.
</P>
<P>
   Some landscapers use railroad ties to create a rustic border,
but this may not be a good idea because of the preservatives used
to make the ties rot-resistant. Many are treated with creosote,
mercury compounds or pentachlorophenol. These chemicals can leach
toxins into the surrounding ground and damage neighboring plants.
Pressure treated lumber isn't toxic, so it makes an acceptable
edger.
</P>
<P>
   Masonry borders may be made of bricks, concrete edging blocks or
natural stone. These materials are heavy and abrasive, so work
carefully and wear heavy gloves to protect your hands. Regardless
of whether you choose bricks, blocks or stone, they should be
embedded in a shallow trench dug beside the pavement. Ideally, you
should lay down a 2-inch bed of carefully leveled sand before you
position the masonry.
</P>
<P>
   Bricks should be placed on end (masons refer to bricks in this
position as ``sailors''). Bricks are designed with letters, SW, MW
and NW, to indicate their resistance to weathering. Severe
weathering (SW) bricks are the best choice for outdoor
applications. Since standard bricks measure 8 by 3 1/4 by 2 1/4
inches, it is relatively easy to order the amount you will need by
measuring the length of the border to be edged, then dividing that
figure by 3 1/4 (this calculation assumes that the bricks will be
butted against each other without mortar). Obviously, you'll have
to round off any fractions to the nearest whole number.
</P>
<P>
   Natural stones are another option but require more effort
because they are heavier and irregular in shape. In order to fit
them together, you may have to chisel off bumps and projections.
Use a brick chisel and a small sledge hammer for this and always
wear safety goggles.
</P>
<P>
   Ground cover plants create a softer edge than wood or stone
materials, yet they do not require much more maintenance. Talk to
the dealer at your local nursery to find out what plants are best
for your needs; ask how tall, lush and how dense they will grow.
</P>
<P>
   Not all edging problems occur around paved surfaces. It is often
difficult to trim the grass near or under a perimeter fence. Plant
cover may eliminate the need for trimming, but this is not always a
good solution, particularly if the fence is made of wood. The
plants will hold moisture and provide a possible shelter for
insects. Both could affect the fence. A better solution involves
digging a small trench under the fence and filling it with gravel.
The gravel bed will provide drainage so water will not collect, and
it will eliminate the need for hand trimming.

PERCEPTION ANALYZER ALLOWS STUDENTS TO GRADE THEIR PERFORMANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mich.)   (af)  
 By ADAM BRYANT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Teachers, of course, make their living grading students. But
with a device known as a Perception Analyzer, students can now turn
the tables (or the lecterns) on their teachers and grade their
performance.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Perception Analyzer has been used for years by
corporations and politicians to test the mass appeal of their
products and messages, Market Strategies, the company that makes
it, is pushing into academia with its system. It includes
dial-mounted handsets that a test group can twiddle to give
real-time feedback to a main computer about their opinions.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Malone, a research psychologist who is with Market
Strategies, a Detroit-based company that, with about 80 clients
worldwide, dominates the market for such systems and the Perception
Analyzer could help teachers get candid feedback from students
about whether they really understood the material being presented.
</P>
<P>
   It is not an easy sell, and not just because a basic system with
12 handsets costs about $10,000. Many teachers, Malone said, wince
at the notion of students rating their talks in real time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Faculty hate it,'' he said. ``But if every kid in the class is
having problems, maybe the problem is with the faculty member.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there have been some takers. Portland State University
bought the system to give its professors a way to check whether
students really understand the material being presented.
</P>
<P>
   The Perception Analyzer has proved to be an effective tool in
measuring student responses, said Devorah A. Lieberman, director of
teaching and learning excellence at the university.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, the system is not used by Portland State to evaluate
its professors. Instead, the professors use it to test whether
their messages are getting across clearly.
</P>
<P>
   So instead of students having to admit publicly that they don't
understand something, they can, without embarrassment, turn the
dial of their Perception Analyzer to respond to just about any form
of question the teacher puts to them, including a snap quiz on what
they; have just learned.
</P>
<P>
   The system is also used by students in public-speaking courses.
``I think it's really got an incredible amount of potential,'' Ms.
Lieberman said.
</P>
<P>
   Given the cost of a college education, Malone said, he expects
that students and their parents will, over time, start insisting on
more accountability for teachers.
</P>
<P>
   After all, he added, power in the marketplace is gradually
shifting to consumers, and there is no reason why the people who
pay for college education _ students and their parents _ should not
be part of that shift.
</P>
<P>
   ``If organizations engaged in any kind of commerce do not meet
consumers' specific requirements, they're toast,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But is education really commerce? At some point, students in a
lecture hall have to do their part and pay particularly close
attention to difficult materal that is not so easily spoon-fed.
</P>
<P>
   Given his line of work, it is perhaps not surprising that Malone
often faces grillings about the Perception Analyzer at dinner
parties and other gatherings. Can't this shift of power to
consumers go too far and lead to a more homogenized society?
</P>
<P>
   Malone counters that, despite the growth of market research, the
breadth and depth and variety of content in American society is
expanding. The role of the Perception Analyzer, he added, is merely
to deliver opinions that are less filtered than if they were voiced
in a group of people who, because of peer pressure, are more likely
to keep their thoughts to themselves or sugar-coat them so as not
to offend.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is absolutely no evidence that greater information in
the hands of decision-makers chokes creativity,'' Malone said.
``The American consumer cannot be manipulated. They are cynical
enough.''

TAKE FISHIN' OFF THE BACK BURNER, AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ART CHAPMAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's been too long since I've fished.
</P>
<P>
   Like most people, I have relied on restaurants to supply my
cooked fish. It's easy enough, sometimes not too expensive, and
always dependable.
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't the case when I was fishing.
</P>
<P>
   Fishing never was easy. I never lived by a river, where all I
had to do was walk from my home to a secret rock where I could sit
and drop my line deep down to the black home of hungry catfish. I
didn't have a crappie hole where the water boiled with fish. The
lake shore never lapped outside my door.
</P>
<P>
   I always had to GO fishing.
</P>
<P>
   And it wasn't cheap. There was the boat, the motor, the trailer.
Also the depth finder, the tackle, the sunglasses with big elastic
straps, and the vests with a lot of really neat little pockets. Did
you know a fishing license costs $19 these days?
</P>
<P>
   And, I dare say, fishing was never dependable. I was a fair hand
with a rod and reel, but if my casting had to bring in dinner,
there would have been some lean times.
</P>
<P>
   Still, I found out recently that I really miss it.
</P>
<P>
   On the Memorial Day weekend, we went to Lake Nocona, where we
met with my daughter's future in-laws, who are from Bowie. They are
nice people, Bob and Sue Romine. They fish.
</P>
<P>
   Along with several of their friends, they have created a private
camp on the lake. They swim, picnic, boat, relax. Mostly they fish,
and then they eat them.
</P>
<P>
   That was the part I liked best.
</P>
<P>
   The Romines, Sam Williams and Ray Murphy collected a batch of
crappie, sand bass and catfish for the weekend fish fry. None of
the fish came from the grocery store. Most were caught just a few
hundred yards from where they were about to be deep-fried in three
cookers sitting side by side.
</P>
<P>
   I must say that I have become accustomed to farm-raised catfish,
and for the most part, the sweet taste and even size make the farm
variety my favorite.
</P>
<P>
   People argue that the catfish they caught as youths in some
slow-rolling river tasted better, and I don't doubt them. But I
doubt that the rivers are as clean as they once were, and catfish
can bring the taste of the river to the table.
</P>
<P>
   Catfish from the lake, however, are a different matter.
</P>
<P>
   Those big chunks of flaky fish were moist and rich. If
restaurants make a mistake with their much-thinner farm-raised
fillets, it's that they cook them until the ends turn up dark and
brown. They look and taste like a wet shoe left to dry in the sun.
</P>
<P>
   The catfish I had with the Romines tasted fresh and fleshy, with
just a tang from the mustard coating.
</P>
<P>
   The mustard is important. Most catfish recipes just call for the
fillets, or the whole fish for that matter, to be simply rolled in
cornmeal and dropped into the hot oil.
</P>
<P>
   Some call for a milk wash, but the really good ones call for
mustard. Don't dilute it, don't try to make it a fancy spiced
mustard. Just plain old yellow hot dog mustard will do.
</P>
<P>
   Roll the fillets through the mustard, then drag them in a
mixture of half cornmeal and half flour. Salt and pepper should be
added to the mixture. Maybe a little cayenne, too. The standard
recipes don't call for this much flour in the coating; usually it's
either straight cornmeal, or three-to-one cornmeal over flour.
</P>
<P>
   I like the half-and-half better, though. It helps carry the
taste of the mustard, yet it doesn't overpower the catfish.
</P>
<P>
   The Romines do it right, and I hope we get back there soon.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Romine was kind enough to take me fishing for an hour or so
after we ate. We didn't catch anything, but just being out there
was like a rich dessert. It made me feel a part of the whole day,
even though I didn't contribute to the stringer.
</P>
<P>
   I hope to, next time. I've already bought a couple of lures and
a fresh tube of sunblock. I'm working on the vest.
</P>
<P>
   I paid the $19 for the license.
</P>

A SINGLE WOMAN AT 60, FACING UP TO FINANCES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Md.)   (ART ADV: Photo is being sent to NYT photo clients. Non-subscribers
can make individual purchase by calling 212-556-4204 or 1927.)  
 (bl)  
 By ALEX WITCHEL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WOODSTOCK, N.Y. _ ``I am a woman of 60 with no savings and no
investments,'' Colette Dowling says. ``I have no disability
insurance, but I feel very strong physically and emotionally. All
things being equal, I should work until I'm 75. But who knows if
all things will be equal?''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dowling, the author of seven books, including the
best-selling ``Cinderella Complex'' (Summit, 1981) is standing in
the kitchen of her rented house making a salad and telling all.
From 1989 to 1994 she spent her entire $250,000 retirement account
(paying penalties and interest on premature withdrawal) and went
into debt to the IRS for $80,000 in unpaid taxes. She lost
everything she had, including two houses here (and all the
furnishings), an apartment in New York City and the advance she was
paid for her newest book, ``Maxing Out: Why Women Sabotage Their
Financial Security'' (Little, Brown).
</P>
<P>
   Just by the subtitle, you can tell that Ms. Dowling is willing
to court controversy. Not all women sabotage their financial
security _ by a long shot. But Ms. Dowling's theory is that in her
generation particularly, women have been raised with the
expectation that someone else (usually a husband or a father) will
take care of them, or rescue them from having to assume
responsibility for their financial independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt that if I took good care of myself, I would always be
alone,'' she says. ``It wasn't conscious. I never in my life was
taught to expect I'd have large amounts of money I'd have to manage
wisely, and when I did, I found it quite frightening and
disturbing. I also didn't think I'd have to support myself for the
rest of my life. My story is dramatic because of the sums involved,
but the process is one with which women are particularly
familiar.''
</P>
<P>
   Sitting here in the kitchen of a house heated only by a
wood-burning stove, Ms. Dowling looks out at a living room adorned
with exposed beams and throw rugs. Wind chimes hang on the porch.
The surroundings are warm and cozy, motherly.
</P>
<P>
   But the woman who lives here isn't, quite. She has the edge of
someone who learned her lesson the hard way, but that seems to be a
way with which she is uncannily comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   Tall and thin, dressed in black jersey pants and top, and
stylish black sandals, she looks more Soho than Woodstock. And
though she is open and articulate (and makes a beautiful salad)
there is something unsettling about her, a feeling that she is
somehow untamed. Which is a characteristic she seems to have
nurtured.
</P>
<P>
   Raised in a Catholic family in Baltimore, Ms. Dowling was forced
by her father to marry the man by whom she became pregnant _ which
was the last time she seemed to obey anyone. Though she had three
children with her husband, they later divorced and she moved to
Rhinebeck, N.Y., with another freelance writer, a man 10 years her
junior. That relationship lasted 15 years, until 1989, when she
resolved to live alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``My life has been lived in rebellion against the whole thing,''
she says. ``The father patriarch taking up all the space, the
mother who was subservient to him. I hated it, and I was willing to
sacrifice a lot in order to have something different. There's no
reason why I couldn't have married a doctor or dentist and had a
life more financially predictable, as my mother's was.''
</P>
<P>
   Though when Ms. Dowling wrote ``The Cinderella Complex,'' a best
seller that was translated into 20 languages, her financial future
seemed secure.
</P>
<P>
   ``For so many years I had so little money and no regular
paycheck,'' she says, ``that I felt triumphant just making ends
meet, even though the seeds of my carelessness and of overspending
to fulfill other needs started then.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Ms. Dowling's thesis in ``The Cinderella Complex'' was
that, liberation aside, women have a hidden fear of independence.
When she moved to Rhinebeck with the writer, she said she
immediately found herself depending on him to support her and her
children. Needless to say, many women, including those who reviewed
the book, excoriated her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it has to do with the depth of our conditioning as
women,'' Ms. Dowling says, ``which has been a theme of mine all
along. It's hard for some of the academic feminists to understand
how emotional conflict about independence could continue decade
after decade. It's hard for a lot of women to admit that after what
we HAVE done, there are still these issues holding us back.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dowling became aware of her own issues after her
relationship ended. ``Bit by bit, I began mismanaging my money,''
she says. ``I made a decision to buy out his share of the house and
was saddled with a mortgage. I also left 15 years of analysis. I
had a book bomb, called `Perfect Women.' My parents were ill and
died. Menopause hit with a bang. I became depressed.''
</P>
<P>
   To compensate, she made expensive improvements on her house. ``I
built stone walls, planted fruit trees, put in a new foundation for
half the house and raised the roof. I should have put my foot down
when the architect told me he couldn't renovate without doing that,
but there was that self-destructive moment of `the hell with it.'''
</P>
<P>
   She shakes her head. ``And why I thought I should spend my
retirement money to do it, I don't know,'' she says. ``It was the
illusion that I was more in control and had some kind of power I
didn't have. I think now a part of me didn't want to be viewed by
the world as a single woman in her 50s on her own and struggling,
God forbid. This crisis has forced me to change a lot of that.''
</P>
<P>
   What helped her the most, she says, was joining Debtors
Anonymous in 1995. ``I had to sell everything to pay off this
debt,'' she says, ``and I still had other bills, and I thought,
`I'm not going to get through this unless I join a support group.'
It's a very rock bottom feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   But once there, ``there was such a degree of openness,'' she
continues, adding: ``DA gets you past experiencing shame at what
you've done and what's happened to you. And it's practically
oriented from Day One. They asked me to make a wish list of things
I wanted to purchase for myself, and here I was the biggest spender
known to mankind, but I wasn't used to thinking about myself as
deserving of things that I wanted, so I could actually state my
desires and plan to go after them. The spending I had done before
was to meet unconscious needs, unconsciously.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Debtors Anonymous is not only for women, though Ms. Dowling says
in her group she counted 15 women and 3 men. ``This whole money
business is the last arena in which these old but persistent
feelings women have are showing themselves,'' she maintains. ``It's
one thing to be productive, make money and be aggressive in a
career, another to acknowledge in an accepting, open way the
responsibility you have for supporting yourself indefinitely.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last book I wrote, `Red Hot Mamas,' about women in
their 50s,'' she goes on, ``I interviewed 65 women and only two of
them had an investment plan for the future. And I do think it does
still relate to conflicts with dependency. Money savvy is connected
with masculinity in our culture. That leaves women with the feeling
that if they want to take care of themselves and are good at it,
the quid pro quo is they'll never hook up with a relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly, says Jane Bryant Quinn, the financial expert and
author, who recently revised and updated her classic, ``Making the
Most of Your Money'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster).
</P>
<P>
   ``It IS more socially acceptable for women not to manage their
money,'' she said in a telephone interview. ``But the Y chromosome
is not a money management chromosome. In all the studies, if you
control for earnings, age and experience, women are the same as
men. At 23, out in the working world staring at a 401(k) plan, they
are equally confused. But if those women quit working they will
know less and less about finance, while the man, who keeps working,
knows more and more. He will not necessarily be better at it, just
less anxious. It's simply knowledge and experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Quinn has not read Ms. Dowling's new book. ``I would not in
any way undercut her personal experience, because she's obviously
had a bad time,'' she said. ``But it's not because she's female.
Someone else could write a book called `You Could Do It,' based on
65 widows who got out there and learned and drove their advisers
wild.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dowling replies: ``I think that saying money management is
socially acceptable for men is very much more insidious in its
effects on women than she seems to allow for. The question is
whether women understand they HAVE to assume responsibility, and be
equally involved in money, savings, investments, all those
decisions and how they get made. It's not enough to say one of us
is good at this, the other is good at that and we have an equal
marriage.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dowling expects her debt to be paid off next fall when the
sale of her New York apartment is finalized. ``That will be a big
relief,'' she says. She also feels more secure about her own
financial future since joining a women's investment group, which
she recommends to others. ``You are able to learn in an uncritical
atmosphere where you don't feel you're being judged, and there's
something empowering about that,'' she says. ``It seems to take it
out of the arena that only men can do this.''
</P>
<P>
   She does stress that the difficult situation she has found
herself in these last four years has not been all negative. She is
close to her son and daughters, all in their 30s. ``One daughter is
struggling with her finances,'' Ms. Dowling says, ``the other is
beginning an investment plan.'' Their brother owns his own business
in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   ``For most of my adult life, my mother and I were estranged,''
she says. ``I was so different from her and her expectations. My
mother at 60 had no idea of how to support herself, or structure
things. It was wind-down time. Women now have the latitude to have
a life that goes on productively and adventurously longer than most
of our mothers, certainly. It's almost as if an extra 20 years were
handed to you without having expected it. What to do?''
</P>
<P>
   She plans to write a new book (she won't divulge the topic) and
to appreciate what she has learned. ``The things I care about that
give me quality of life have changed,'' she says. ``I've created a
life in which I have a lot of deeply connected relationships. I
feel supported, not alone. One thing that creates a feeling of
stability is understanding how things work in the world, not to be
so caught off balance as I was when I was younger. It's that
feeling of arriving at some sort of intelligence about the world
and people in it _ not the inner shrinking girl feeling I had for
so many years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very big thing to have learned how to come up with
$80,000 to pay off my debt. I have learned to make choices about
how to spend my money. I think now, `Yes, I can deal with it.'''
Her smile is genuine. ``There's some relief in actually feeling
like a grown-up.''

TWO HORSERACING SYNDICATES FLOURISH ON LINE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Horseplayers are by nature second-guessers. So perhaps it is not
surprising that, in 1994, a group of racing fans who had been
second-guessing trainers and owners regularly on an Internet
mailing list decided to see if they could do better. So they pooled
their money and bought a horse.
</P>
<P>
   Racing ownership syndicates are not new. But Virtual Owners
Partnership (http://www.ttinet.com/vop/), formed in September 1994,
and Cyberspace Racing Team (http://www.crt-stable.com), started by
several Virtual Owners members in 1995, have taken the concept
digital.
</P>
<P>
   The two groups are small-time as syndicates go. The best-known
syndicate in the world of horse-racing, Team Valor, has won many
major stakes races, and its runners earned over $1.5 million last
year. By contrast, Cyberspace Racing has owned 13 horses in its
history, and its greatest success has come with Born Wild, who won
a minor stakes race at an Arizona track. Still, buying in is much
less expensive than in a typical syndicate: under Cyberspace
Racing's system, $1,000 buys one-150th of a four-horse ``stable.''
Virtual Owners allows an investment as low as $400.
</P>
<P>
   Many decisions _ excluding training decisions _ are made by
majority rule, with partners weighing in via e-mail, said Toni
Richardson, general manager of Cyberspace Racing. For day-to-day
decisions, like which race to enter a horse in, the partners rely
on their trainers. But before a horse is bought or sold, members
are polled.
</P>
<P>
   Most partners were recreational bettors. Only a few had any
experience in the field, and most were attracted through the
mailing list, a horse racing newsgroup or the groups' web pages.
</P>
<P>
   Virtual Owners Partnership races primarily in Illinois.
Cyberspace Racing Team, which has been racing primarily in Arizona
and California, is expanding into New York with a horse set to run
at Belmont Park.
</P>
<P>
   Even the teams' jockey silks reflect their computer origins.
Cyberspace Racing's sport a big ``(AT)'' sign, a reference to an
Internet address, while Virtual Owners' silks feature the winking
emoticon, ;). (The New York Jockey Club has frowned on the
``(AT),'' and Cyberspace Racing will sport modified silks there.)
</P>
<P>
   For a sport that relies heavily on accurate data, racing has
been slow to embrace online technology. Soon after the introduction
of off-track betting, attendance at tracks fell as bettors started
betting near their homes. Wagering by telephone has also been a big
success. A few hundred fans are taking part in an online betting
experiment at http://www.youbet.com.
</P>
<P>
   Betting on sports like football and baseball on line is illegal
in most of the country, and in March the federal government
arrested several online bookmakers. With betting on horse-racing
legal in most states at the track or by phone, there are few legal
obstacles to online betting on horses.
</P>
<P>
   Data on horses' past performances are now available on some
tracks' web sites, usually for a dollar or two. And results and
race calls are quick and easy to get at many sites. A site at
http://www.racingchannel.com provides real-time odds. Pedigree
information is available, notably at
http://owl.frontier.com/pedigree/.
</P>
<P>
   Race horse ownership is still dominated by the wealthy. But the
online groups have offered the chance for $2 bettors to experience
racing in a new way.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Zorn, a law professor at Pace University and a
Cyberspace Racing partner who has been betting on horses since high
school, said winning as a part-owner is ``much more exciting than
winning a bet.''
</P>
<P>
   Syndicate members say making money is not the object. The cold
truth is that most horse owners at any level lose money.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Zorn said, ``It's a thrill to be in the winners'
circle.''

   Q. Where can I find the commands to make my screen icons bigger?
</P>
<P>
   A. Since you did not specify whether your computer is
Windows-based or a Macintosh, let's look at the methods for the
current versions of both operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   For a personal computer with Windows 95, go to the Start menu
and select Settings, then Control Panel. The various icons there,
with names like Sounds, Mouse and Keyboard, are for controls that
let you customize the look of your computer.
</P>
<P>
   Double-click on the Display icon, and the Display Properties box
will pop up. Click on the Appearance tab. In the bottom part of the
box, go to the Item pop-up menu and select Icon. In the Size box to
the right, type in a number that is larger than the one you see,
and the icons will become larger. You can also change the font and
font size of the icons' labels in the boxes just below. When
finished, click Apply, then OK.
</P>
<P>
   If you work on a Macintosh running OS 8,look under View in the
Finder's Menu bar. Pick View Options, and click the button for the
icon size you'd like. There are two sizes available for desktop
icons. To change the size of icons that appear in folder windows,
open any folder and repeat the process (there are three icon sizes
to choose from). You can change the font and font size for your
icons with the Preferences option in the Finder's Edit menu. &QL;

`BULWORTH' BORROWS FROM EARNEST POLITICAL GEMS OF THE '70s 
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: of its residents.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The other quasi-political movies about the Oval Office have been
thrillers, like the less-than-memorable ``Murder at 1600,'' in
which the president is barely necessary. Clint Eastwood starred in
a pair of them, ``In the Line of Fire''.MDBU/.MDNM/ and ``Absolute
Power,'' movies in which the presidential figure is mostly a
nuisance. In ``Air Force One,'' Harrison Ford turns the chief
executive into a fierce anti-terroristist who must have been
inspired by the old ``Super President'' cartoon series of the '60s,
in which the president was literally the alter ego of a
superpowered being. In ``Independence Day,'' Bill Pullman is a
president who gets his credibility back when he has aerial
dogfights with creatures from another world.
</P>
<P>
   But those films have nothing to do with politics, strictly
speaking. Rather, they are about the contempt that has grown in
most of us for the political process. It's a deeply cynical ploy
for a movie to suggest that, essentially, the only way the most
powerful elected officeholder in the world can show any muscle is
to strap on a gun. When the level of discourse for the president in
most recent films consists of him disarming an alien, it's no
wonder Beatty felt he had to make ``Bulworth.'' At least the
president in Stanley Kubrick's ``Dr. Strangelove'' was supposed to
be a cartoon that no one took seriously. But in most movies, no one
takes politics seriously. There are those who say that Oliver Stone
keeps political debate alive in film, but most of Stone's movie's
are about ... well, Oliver Stone.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe movies about politics, and the presidency in particular,
have sacrificed weight since Watergate and its consequences. ``All
the President's Men'' was the final word that we couldn't trust the
people we voted into office. But some of the most important movies
about politics have a defeated air. ``The Candidate,'' an absorbing
and keenly corrosive satire of young liberal candidate (Robert
Redford) being hustled as a product, ends on a disquieting note. It
amplified, even during an era of hope, the disorder and compromise
that politics cause.
</P>
<P>
   The satires ``Wag the Dog, Primary Colors'' and ``Bulworth''
also end with a bad taste. These are all the visions of major
directors, who felt these movies had to be made and forced the
issue. ``Wag the Dog'' was made by Barry Levinson (''Rain Man)''
quickly and cheaply; ``Primary Colors'' was based on a bestselling
novel and featured major star John Travolta; ``Bulworth'' came
about because Fox contractually owed Warren Beatty a movie and
didn't want to be dragged through the courts.
</P>
<P>
   As a producer, Beatty has used politics as a backdrop more than
anyone, including two of his most interesting movies, ``Reds'' and
``Shampoo,'' which was set during the 1968 presidential election.
Perhaps in an era in which things are good, as they were during the
time before the Depression _ which galvanized filmmakers to make
movies about the state of the world in a way we haven't seen since
_ we don't want to be reminded in movie of just how little we
demand of our politicians.

INDIA, PAKISTAN CAN ILL AFFORD NUKE TESTS 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PARTHA BANERJEE  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ First India and now Pakistan have carried out
tests of nuclear weapons. In India, a jingoist and ultrapatriotic
atmosphere now prevails, arguably created by the
government-controlled mass media and mainstream press.
</P>
<P>
   The nuclear tests carried out by the Hindu government led by the
Indian Peoples' Party, or BJP, were in fact a desperate effort to
divert common Indians' attention from the government's own
political turmoil and coalition crises. During the past few weeks,
the new government was shaken by corruption charges, dissensions,
the intraparty feuds. A serious diversion was needed to sway
opinion in its favor. The nuclear tests that were readied by the
previous centrist governments came in handy for the present
right-wing coalition.
</P>
<P>
   This shaky coalition is now reincarnated to possibly serve a
full five-year term. All the anti-nuclear opposition launched by
environmentalists, anti-war protesters, progressive social and
political leaders, and a section of scientists have been termed by
the ruling coalition and its supporters as anti-national agents,
traitors, and communists.
</P>
<P>
   The same is happening in Pakistan. Contrary to the opinion put
forward by some U.S. leaders and columnists, India's nuclear test
is a true fascist-like action with no regard for the rest of the
world. India and Pakistan, since their creation as two separate
countries by the British in 1947, have fought three brutal wars and
have remained hostile to each other. The jingoism exhibited by the
BJP government has severed the lines of communication that had only
recently opened up between India and Pakistan, and severely damaged
India's slowly normalizing relationship with China.
</P>
<P>
   In the 50th anniversary year of Mahatma Gandhi's assassination,
Indians have every reason to mourn the total destruction of the
Gandhian tradition of nonviolence because of this nuclear gesture.
Many Indians feel disgraced by the belligerent actions of their
government.
</P>
<P>
   Now many Pakistanis feel the same way about their
administration.
</P>
<P>
   It is now a likely scenario that the arms race will heat up
severely in the subcontinent, putting millions of poor people in
serious jeopardy. The U.S. government pressed Pakistan not to
conduct its own tests and tried to lure it with economic and
military incentive packages. It failed. The rulers of India and
Pakistan have renewed their royal game in the name of patriotism
and national security. The poor people of the subcontinent keep
paying the dear price.
</P>
<P>
   Pro-BJP politicians and analysts cite that India is not on the
best of terms with its two big neighbors, China and Pakistan,
hence, for security reasons, making nuclear bombs is justified.
True, China is a nuclear power.
</P>
<P>
   However, in 1971, China and the United States were allies of
Pakistan during the Indian-Pakistani war over Bangladesh, but none
of them, despite their big arsenals of nuclear weapons, could
prevent East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) from surrendering to the
Indian army.
</P>
<P>
   China has a longstanding border dispute with India, but the
reality is, it could not move an inch into the Indian territory
since becoming a nuclear weapons state. It is very likely that no
country acquiring new nuclear weapons would ever be able to use
them in a war, and Hiroshima is not a possibility anymore.
</P>
<P>
   The right-wing Indian government's so-called patriotic
justification of nuclear weapons is practically baseless. The tests
will only help them boost their sagging image within the country.
We can say the same about the right-wing Pakistani government. The
implications of the BJP government's radical departure from India's
traditional foreign policy for peace in South Asia and the
consequent potential of a nuclear arms race in the region, however
brainless that might be, is something that should concern all
peace-loving people of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Other than the massive expenses to build nuclear weapons,
expenses India and Pakistan can hardly afford, environmentalists
are extremely worried about possible radioactive fallout from such
tests.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and other Western nations that possess nuclear
weapons and those who have upheld the unequal nuclear order have
questionable rights to impose sanctions on India and Pakistan. Many
of my Indian and American friends tell me that they are having a
hard time convincing people to sign their anti-nuke petitions not
because these people support the tests, but rather they do not
support the sanctions by the U.S. government, an act they find
biased and based on double standards.
</P>
<P>
   Fact is, the Republican-led Congress has yet to ratify the
Clinton government's signing of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban
Treaty, a treaty the United States nonetheless wants other
countries to sign.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the above, we should have nothing but strong
condemnation for the jingoist gesture of the Hindu supremacist
government in India and the Pakistan's Islamic government. The
common peace-loving people of the Indian subcontinent must not be
provoked by the irresponsible actions of their rulers.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Mahatma Gandhi, who fought throughout his life for
secularism, tolerance, and peace, would not have smiled at such
pointless warmongering.

   In rain, snow, sleet and hail, and even wind that will ruin a
teen-ager's perfect hair, students around the country are trudging
outside daily to gather precise weather data that will be used by
teams of scientists studying the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these students gather their information on Saturdays and
Sundays, and a few have even shown up on holidays to record data on
temperature, cloud cover, precipitation and the pH of rain and snow
for a program called Global Learning and Observations to Benefit
the Environment. As students become more advanced in their
data-gathering skills, they add hydrology, land cover and soil
studies.
</P>
<P>
   After gathering the data, the students enter it on the Globe Web
site (www.globe.gov). Students in more than 4,000 schools in the
United States and 1,000 schools in 70 countries are using the
Internet in this way to report their weather observations.
</P>
<P>
   Nine teams of government and university scientists use the data
from the Globe Web site, which gets 30,000 hits a day from
students, teachers and anyone else who is interested.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of talking about what scientists do, we are doing what
scientists do,'' said Joe Grande, a teacher and chairman of the
science department at Abington Junior High School in a suburb of
Philadelphia. ``They love to go outside and collect the
information. It gives the kids an ownership of the data.''
</P>
<P>
   The Globe program was started in April 1994 by Vice President Al
Gore as a way to give elementary and high-school students hands-on
science and computer training. Based in Washington, it receives
about $13 million each year from the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration, the National Science Foundation and
National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, some Republican leaders have tried to cut the
program. Rep. John R. Kasich, R-Ohio, who is chairman of the budget
committee, said in a 1996 speech that the program ``says to
children, `We will give you millions of dollars to measure rainfall
by collecting it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But the program has enough fans in both parties in Congress that
it has been financed for the past three years. The next proposed
budget requests $13 million for the program, said Ann Elise
Hardison, Globe's communications director.
</P>
<P>
   In Grande's seventh-grade science class, students take turns
gathering information for the project. Every day two of them walk
out to a steel box on the school's lawn with a Globe clipboard.
</P>
<P>
   Students need to make their observations within an hour of solar
noon. Checking the instruments in the box, they record the maximum
and minimum temperature in the previous 24 hours (in Celsius, of
course), the amount of rainfall and the extent of cloud cover. If
there has been rain or snow, they measure the accumulation and pH
level.
</P>
<P>
   When the students return to the classroom, they go to the Globe
Web site and record the data on the computerized form. Students can
check data from around the world, call up weather maps and see if
weather predictions matched reality.
</P>
<P>
   Grande's class has also monitored the weather on most weekends.
On Saturdays, Dan Scharle, 12, goes to the weather box to get the
data; his classmate Allison Tausek, 13, does the same on Sundays.
``It's cool to realize that everyone around the world will see the
numbers I give to Grande,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, 300 students from 22 countries who have
participated in Globe will attend a Globe conference in Helsinki,
Finland, where they will get a chance to tell scientists about the
data they are gathering.
</P>
<P>
   Globe's budget is used to support the scientists who work with
the program, to provide free teacher training and educational
material and to maintain the Web site. The schools also spend $400
to $900 apiece for weather-measuring equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest concern about the program early on, Ms. Hardison
said, was whether students could be trusted to collect data. ``That
has been proven,'' she said. ``Students can be counted on to gather
useful environmental science data.''
</P>
<P>
   When Republicans tried to cut the program, many teachers spoke
up to defend it. A teacher in Kasich's district called it the best
science program since the Manhattan Project.
</P>
<P>
   The administration, defending the Globe program, said it gave
students hands-on training. Killing the program would have wasted
the schools' investment in equipment and training for it, officials
added. Most of the cost is carried by the school, although some
federal grants have been available.
</P>
<P>
   A soil scientist, Dr. Elissa Levine, who works at the NASA
Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., uses the weather
data to see how weather patterns have affected soil
characteristics. Dr. Levine visits schools regularly and exchanges
e-mail with students.
</P>
<P>
   Several times a year, she gets on the Web to tell the students
about her research and give them a chance to ask her questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Web chats are wonderful,'' she said. ``The questions range
all over the place.''
</P>
<P>
   Students are also able to talk on the Web to students in the
Globe program at other schools. At the Dwight School in Manhattan,
on Central Park West at 89th Street, students in the elementary
division have asked children in Boulder, Colo., about their weather
and have asked children in Finland what their school is like, said
the division's dean, Nancy Burton.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've found kids all over the world live lives that are more
similar than different,'' Ms. Burton said. The school's students
use the data in science and math classes.
</P>
<P>
   They have plotted their numbers on charts and graphs and checked
out Globe's historic weather data on Central Park. Once a month,
the students go down to the 79th Street Boat Basin on the Hudson
River and check the river's temperature and pH level.
</P>
<P>
   Entering the data has been the easiest part for the students,
Ms. Burton said. ``Kids are much more computer-literate than
adults,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   A long-term benefit of the program may be that it will encourage
students to go into the fields of technology and science, Dr.
Levine said. She received a letter from a sixth-grade girl who said
she had wanted to be a doctor or a veterinarian. ``Now,'' Dr.
Levine said, ``she wants to be a soil scientist for NASA.''

`BULWORTH' BORROWS FROM EARNEST POLITICAL GEMS OF THE '70s 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Whatever else you might say about ``Bulworth,'' part of what
makes it exciting and different is that it has reintroduced the
idea of politics in a major studio movie. For those of us who think
movies should be about something, ``Bulworth'' offers ideas: the
corruption of a man's ideals as seen from the eye of the hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   It is a refreshing concept that has mostly disappeared from
movies; empty-headed junk like ``Deep Impact'' and ``Godzilla''
couldn't be less interested in giving audiences something to talk
about.
</P>
<P>
   As the disillusioned senator, Warren Beatty is so eager to give
the movie a political context that ``Bulworth'' seems a little
incoherent, like someone who has so much to say that he rushes
through it all so that we end up with no idea of the point he is
trying to make.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the audacity feels a little worn. Beatty never deals
with the fact that a number of African-Americans don't like rap,
and in fact that's probably the audience segment most likely to be
offended when Halle Berry murmurs to Beatty, ``You know you my
nigga.''
</P>
<P>
   There is also a hint of Beatty trying to have his cake and eat
it, too. By using rap, he connects with both the prime movie-going
audience _ white 12- to 24-year-olds _ and a black audience
underserved by movies in general.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bulworth'' comes at a time when we're seeing more movies about
politics _ ``Wag the Dog'' and ``Primary Colors'' also touch on the
subject _ than we've seen in years. But Beatty's ``Bulworth'' is an
anachronism, a healthy throwback to the old-fashioned political
context that flourished in movies a few years back, a period that
ended about the time of ``Apocalypse Now.'' These days, the only
politics you find in movies is capitalism: getting audiences to
vote with their dollars, so the pictures make a profit.
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when politics and movies were so intertwined
that a political subtext was inescapable. Even ``Star Wars'' lifted
the last sequence _ the military procession _ from Leni
Riefenstahl's ``Triumph of the Will'' in order to make a subtle
point about the fascist implications of the Force.
</P>
<P>
   For the longest time, politics had to be sneaked into movies the
way sex was hidden in films before the MPAA ratings came along;
politics was part of the subtext in such films as ``Bonnie &AMP;
Clyde'' and ``Chinatown.'' And I say ``had to'' because the nation
was torn apart by civil rights issues, the Vietnam War and U.S.
involvement in South America. Those issues created a schism across
the country, and filmmakers were proud to get their attitudes into
their films, like the lumnious and insane ``Burn,'' with Marlon
Brando. It was in the '70s that politics had its last flowering as
a subject for movies, when fervor and anger and mistrust boiled
into a potent stew in the national consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   The high point of that cinematic unrest is the little-seen and
not-quite-successful thriller ``The Parallax View,'' with its
merciless paranoia and Beatty starring as a reporter pulled into an
assassination conspiracy. (''Parallax View'' has been acknowledged
by ``X-Files'' creator Chris Carter as an inspiration for that
show's suspicious purview.)
</P>
<P>
   But ``Parallax View'' wasn't the first _ or the best _ of such
movies. The picture that set the tone of fear and powerlessness in
politics happens to be one of the craftiest comedies ever made:
``The Manchurian Candidate,'' based on the novel by Richard Condon.
Essentially a vaudevillian, All-American turn on Graham Greene, in
which a soldier is brainwashed into killing the president,
``Candidate'' was set into motion by Frank Sinatra, who produced
and starred in the film. When John F. Kennedy, Sinatra's friend,
was slain by an assassin's bullet, the heartsick producer withdrew
the movie from circulation.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Bulworth,'' Beatty skimmed off the earnestness that used to
be such a part of the political backdrop in movies, using slickness
as a concession to the audience's need to be entertained. But all
of the other recent movies about politics, like the softhearted
``Dave,'' prize the entertainment factor so highly that they never
really get around to displaying any brains. ``Dave,'' along with
``The American President'' and ``My Fellow Americans'' relinquished
significance in a desperation to inflict pleasantries. They danced
around the issues. ``The American President'' and ``Dave'' were
romantic comedies about how the Oval Office can put a crimp in your
love life. (Which, clearly, isn't a problem for some of its
residents.) MORE &QL;

<P>
   UNDATED: of its residents.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The other quasi-political movies about the Oval Office have been
thrillers, like the less-than-memorable ``Murder at 1600,'' in
which the president is barely necessary. Clint Eastwood starred in
a pair of them, ``In the Line of Fire''.MDBU/.MDNM/ and ``Absolute
Power,'' movies in which the presidential figure is mostly a
nuisance. In ``Air Force One,'' Harrison Ford turns the chief
executive into a fierce anti-terroristist who must have been
inspired by the old ``Super President'' cartoon series of the '60s,
in which the president was literally the alter ego of a
superpowered being. In ``Independence Day,'' Bill Pullman is a
president who gets his credibility back when he has aerial
dogfights with creatures from another world.
</P>
<P>
   But those films have nothing to do with politics, strictly
speaking. Rather, they are about the contempt that has grown in
most of us for the political process. It's a deeply cynical ploy
for a movie to suggest that, essentially, the only way the most
powerful elected officeholder in the world can show any muscle is
to strap on a gun. When the level of discourse for the president in
most recent films consists of him disarming an alien, it's no
wonder Beatty felt he had to make ``Bulworth.'' At least the
president in Stanley Kubrick's ``Dr. Strangelove'' was supposed to
be a cartoon that no one took seriously. But in most movies, no one
takes politics seriously. There are those who say that Oliver Stone
keeps political debate alive in film, but most of Stone's movie's
are about ... well, Oliver Stone.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe movies about politics, and the presidency in particular,
have sacrificed weight since Watergate and its consequences. ``All
the President's Men'' was the final word that we couldn't trust the
people we voted into office. But some of the most important movies
about politics have a defeated air. ``The Candidate,'' an absorbing
and keenly corrosive satire of young liberal candidate (Robert
Redford) being hustled as a product, ends on a disquieting note. It
amplified, even during an era of hope, the disorder and compromise
that politics cause.
</P>
<P>
   The satires ``Wag the Dog, Primary Colors'' and ``Bulworth''
also end with a bad taste. These are all the visions of major
directors, who felt these movies had to be made and forced the
issue. ``Wag the Dog'' was made by Barry Levinson (''Rain Man)''
quickly and cheaply; ``Primary Colors'' was based on a bestselling
novel and featured major star John Travolta; ``Bulworth'' came
about because Fox contractually owed Warren Beatty a movie and
didn't want to be dragged through the courts.
</P>
<P>
   As a producer, Beatty has used politics as a backdrop more than
anyone, including two of his most interesting movies, ``Reds'' and
``Shampoo,'' which was set during the 1968 presidential election.
Perhaps in an era in which things are good, as they were during the
time before the Depression _ which galvanized filmmakers to make
movies about the state of the world in a way we haven't seen since
_ we don't want to be reminded in movie of just how little we
demand of our politicians.

<P>
   NEWBURGH, N.Y. _ A river ran through them. Clouds still linger
on the craggy green cliffs overlooking the Hudson River. And if you
stand on the wide Gothic revival verandas of houses that began a
19th-century design revolution here and squint past the
subdivisions, it is possible to feel the kinship that Andrew
Jackson Downing, Calvert Vaux and Frederick Clarke Withers had with
this place. But the story has largely slipped into history's mists.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the most ugly house you can imagine _ really nasty,''
Julian Hogan, a 48-year-old psychologist, said of the hilltop house
she later learned was built in 1857 by a young architect named
Vaux, who would meet Frederick Law Olmsted, a sometime farmer, on
Newburgh's fertile ground and go on to design Central Park with
him. ``But something about the light was amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   After buying it she removed an inch and a half of wire-lathed
stucco _ and uncovered an extraordinary, forgotten legacy. ``I kept
thinking, If people only knew.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon they will know. On June 6 and 7, this scrappy river city,
home to one of the state's largest and most significant historic
districts, will be the host of ``Taste Makers of an Era,'' a
two-day symposium and house tour that will examine the lineage of
four 19th-century apostles of taste _ Downing, Vaux, Withers and
Olmsted _ and the city that nurtured them.
</P>
<P>
   Among the featured scholars at the event will be Francis Kowsky,
whose new book ``Country, Park and City: The Architecture and Life
of Calvert Vaux'' (Oxford University Press) has prompted a
reappraisal of the more silent partner in Olmsted &AMP; Vaux.
</P>
<P>
   Downing, Vaux's mentor and the son of a Newburgh wheelwright and
nurseryman, became the leading taste maker of his generation,
mostly through his writings. He drowned in the Hudson when fire
broke out on a steamboat ferrying him to visit clients. It was
1852. He was 36. Vaux, the ``clever young architect'' Downing had
plucked from obscurity in England and and eventually made his
partner, grimly identified the body. The coffin was laid out in the
library of Highland Garden, Downing's house in Newburgh. ``A
terrific storm burst over the river and crashed among the hills,''
an observer wrote, ``and the wild sympathy of nature surrounded
that blasted home.''
</P>
<P>
   Downing had forged a naturalistic link between house and garden,
a revolutionary idea that _ perhaps forever in America _ threw the
corset of classical formality to the winds.
</P>
<P>
   Frederick Withers, another young English architect discovered
and hired by Downing, would become a leading church designer and
architect of wondrous Gothic revival buildings like the Jefferson
Market Courthouse in Greenwich Village. The last collaboration
between Vaux and Olmsted would be a park in Newburgh in Downing's
memory.
</P>
<P>
   Downing's historical timing was perfect. He appeared at a moment
before the Civil War when a generation of home builders, the new
American middle class, was seeking to define American style. It was
in need of an oracle, an ``apostle of taste,'' in the words of
David Schuyler, an architectural historian.
</P>
<P>
   In popular books and in The Horticulturist, his journal of
``rural art and rural taste,'' Downing set forth his ideas about
picturesque houses and gardens, advocating the Gothic revival
style. He loved the Gothic for its ``artistical irregularity.'' The
variety of its forms, proportions, color, light and shade, Vaux
later wrote, appealed to the eye ``and through the eye to the
mind.''
</P>
<P>
   An architectural evangelist, Downing told America's new middle
class what it yearned to hear: that taste could be learned. At
Highland Garden and other houses in and around Newburgh _ some of
which, designed in partnership with Vaux and Withers, are on the
tour _ Downing put his ideas about landscape into practice. (The
houses were designed by Vaux and Withers; Downing had no formal
architectural training).
</P>
<P>
   From his property on the Hudson's steep slopes, he established a
design firm catering to Newburgh's middle class; Vaux and Withers
would continue the business for three years after his death. The
grounds were poetry, with shadowy pathways, fragrant beds of moss
and thyme and rustic log and bark shelters, so one could ``linger
and quietly communicate with the genius of the place,'' in Francis
Kowsky's words.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Newburgh _ listed as one of the most
endangered historic districts by the National Trust for Historic
Preservation _ has a subculture of homeowners who consider
themselves keepers of the flame. They have inherited french doors,
breezy verandas, side porches, bay windows and quirkily placed
chimneys. Like Downing, they tend to be messianic. This may be the
only city in America where homeowners can quote verbatim from
dogeared editions of ``Cottage Residences,'' Downing's 1852
classic.
</P>
<P>
   Lillie and Dan Hodge live in a house above the river that Vaux
designed for William Warren, treasurer of the Delaware, Lackawanna
&AMP; Western Railroad and deputy comptroller of New York City.
Conceived as a platform for viewing nature, the house is subtly
planned, its public front tall and ornamental, with a simple, more
horizontal back that has a view of the river.
</P>
<P>
   Though Vaux ``didn't invent a style of architecture,'' Kowsky
notes, he had an eye for spatial arrangement, adapting each house
to its location and allowing those who lived there to feel intimate
with the landscape. That talent would be extravagantly expressed
later in Central Park in spots like Bethesda Terrace, where the
views were from naturally elevated areas ``in a manner analogous to
the way Vaux sited his houses,'' he writes.
</P>
<P>
   The house has been in the Hodge family since 1953. Mrs. Hodge
still has some of Warren's books, including a Bible with a big
silver clasp. Not long ago, the Hodges hired Tom Pope, a house
painter from Chatham, N.Y., to paint the place, which was
originally coated in stucco.
</P>
<P>
   Vaux was drawn to ``soft, quiet tones,'' but because the
exterior had been sandblasted to reveal the brick, Pope felt it was
OK to ``make it jump out a bit.'' He striped the tin canopies,
spruced up the rosettes and chose what he calls ``an Olana theme''
_ an allusion to the painter Frederic E. Church's sensuous Moorish
reverie farther up the Hudson, designed by Church and planned by
Vaux.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Hodges' house now has a whimsical air. Lillie Hodge feels
herself admiring it, especially when cleaning her pair of
ballrooms. ``It's a museum, really _ that's how I see it,'' she
said. ``But it's well lived in. There's no furniture you can't sit
on.''
</P>
<P>
   Downing's romantic presence is palpable even in the driveway
that wends its way to the 23-room Downing-Vaux ``cottage'' owned by
Linda Anderson Henry and Scott Henry. As it turns, the drive
reveals a three-quarter profile of the house, its irregular roof
lines deliberate echoes of the distant hills.
</P>
<P>
   The house was built after Downing's death beside a stream in
what Downing called ``the Rhine style,'' and it has been an object
of passionate _ some might say obsessive _ interest for the couple
since they purchased it in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Henry, a freelance political consultant, and Ms. Henry, a
psychologist, had a ``coming out party'' for their house to which
they invited leading Downing and Vaux scholars. Henry, who studied
architecture at Brooklyn Tech, has made a career out of researching
the history of his property. He speaks grandly of ``classic Downing
effects.''
</P>
<P>
   Though few Downing landscapes survive, there is a strong
suspicion among landscape historians that Henry's and Ms.
Anderson's yard, with its tulip trees, Osage orange trees, European
beeches and native specimens, may be among them.
</P>
<P>
   Newburgh residents who own and love these houses seem determined
not to be intimidated by their illustrious architectural pedigrees.
Though they proudly show off the original drawings of their house,
designed by Withers in 1859, Carla and Robert Decker were bent on
making it comfortable. While they restored the parlor, with its
original gaslight ceiling fixture, they let the rest of the house
``kind of just be 1998,'' as Mrs. Decker put it.
</P>
<P>
   Houses like the Deckers' are testaments to an optimistic era in
which the towns along the Hudson boomed with the river. Recent
history, however, has not been kind to Newburgh, whose depressed
economy and high vacancy rates are taking their toll on the
historic district.
</P>
<P>
   In 1977, Morningside, an 1859 Withers house, was in such
disrepair that its Gothic revival library was removed and
reconstructed in the American Wing of the Metropolitan Museum of
Art. (The house, on the June 7 tour, has since been restored.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Poverty is a preserver of sorts,'' said Winthrop Aldrich, the
deputy commissioner for historic preservation in the state Parks
Department.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are signs of a rebound. The National Trust has
recently set up a nonprofit development corporation to create
affordable housing in the historic district. And the 35-acre city
park designed by Vaux and Olmsted in Downing's memory _ finished,
poignantly, by their sons, including one named Downing Vaux _ has
been rejuvenated by the Downing Park Planning Committee. Downing is
buried nearby, beneath a medieval-looking gravestone designed,
naturally, by Vaux.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like having a wonderful painting you scratched and
discovered was a Rembrandt,'' Henry said of the city's uncommon
lineage. ``So what do you do? You keep on scratching.''

 By PETER H. LEWIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   You filthy-minded little pervert! The Kingdom of Tonga
admonishes you. Now go back and think of another name that you
wouldn't be embarrassed to say to your mother.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, the shame, being scolded by a computer. But more about that
later.
</P>
<P>
   All I wanted to do was to get an Internet domain name of my own.
The problem is that Lewis is a very common name, and lewis.com was
already taken.
</P>
<P>
   So, like millions of Internet users before me, I began looking
elsewhere for a domain I could call home, the Internet equivalent
of 40 acres where I could grow electronic mail, raise a small herd
of Web pages and maybe someday _ this is the Internet dream _ open
a little electronic cottage industry of my own, all with my own
unique electronic brand. Lewis dot something. Lewis dot anything.
</P>
<P>
   It used to be technically difficult for average computer users
to get their own personal, second-level Internet domain names _ the
part of an e-mail address to the right of the ``(AT)'' and the part
of the World Wide Web address that typically follows www. But if
you could figure out how to do it, registering a domain name was
free, and good names were plentiful.
</P>
<P>
   No more. The Internet is now the world's fastest-growing
economy, and the commercialization of the Internet has created a
feeding frenzy for domain names. A combination of greed, government
bureaucracy, technical jingoism and wild consumer speculation has
thrown the Internet addressing system into chaos.
</P>
<P>
   This week, after months of debate and policy wrangling, the
Clinton administration is expected to issue its revised proposal
for turning the management of the Internet domain naming system
over to a private nonprofit international organization. If all goes
according to plan, individuals and businesses alike will find it
easier to register and begin using a domain name.
</P>
<P>
   With 100 million people on the Internet, domain names are
already a precious commodity. After all, an Internet domain name is
not just the computer equivalent of a telephone number and mailing
address but also a status symbol, a powerful marketing tool and a
vanity license plate.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, someone in Texas was reported to have paid $150,000
for the rights to the name business.com.
</P>
<P>
   Although alternatives will soon abound, nearly everyone agrees
that no other Internet address carries the cachet of a personal
``dot com'' domain, the equivalent of a 212 area code for a phone
number or a Fifth Avenue address. It is the largest top-level
domain on the Internet, with more than two million unique secondary
domains (like nytimes.com). More than 100,000 new ``dot com''
domains are added each month.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are still good dot-com names available,'' said Doug
Wolford, senior vice president for marketing and sales at Network
Solutions, a for-profit company that for the past five years has
had a virtual monopoly on registering .com domains because of an
early agreement with the National Science Foundation, the original
Internet overseer.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people don't get their first choice, obviously they're
going to say all the good names are gone,'' Wolford said. ``But
with a little creativity, there are lots of good names left.''
</P>
<P>
   Network Solutions, known in the industry as NSI, is a case in
point. Someone else nabbed the address nsi.com before NSI did, so
the company took the less intuitive netsol.com. And now, facing the
end of its government-mandated monopoly on Sept. 30, the company
has been marketing itself as ``The Dot Com People''
(www.thedotcompeople.com) and adopting a much more friendly
demeanor to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   I tried to be creative. Peterlewis.com had been registered by a
fire-and-brimstone Christian group in Kansas called the Friend to
Friend Foundation (www.friendtofriend. com) that apparently
finances its ministries by registering Internet domains and
releasing them to others in return for donations.
</P>
<P>
   Pete.com already belongs to a guy named Pete in Hawaii.
Peter.com was taken by a chap named Jimmy in England. Phoenix Home
Life got to my initials before I did, so I had to scratch phl.com.
</P>
<P>
   As expected, lewis.org and lewis.net _ .org and .net being
arguably the two most desirable top-level domains after .com _ had
been snatched already. Lewis.edu belongs to Lewis Middle School in
San Diego, which has a dandy Web site. Lewis.gov or lewis.mil are
available, but since I have neither my own government bureaucracy
nor an army, I don't qualify.
</P>
<P>
   A group of Internet mullahs called the Internet Assigned Numbers
Authority last year proposed adding seven more top-level domains:
.firm, .shop, .web, .arts, .rec, .info and .nom. But those
proposals fell into an electronic limbo in January when the Clinton
administration first proposed its overhaul of the domain naming
system.
</P>
<P>
   And besides, my swifter relatives and an assortment of domain
bandits quickly signed up for lewis.nom, lewis.info and others.
</P>
<P>
   So, like my Irish and Welsh forebears more than a century ago, I
began looking for a virtual homestead in another country.
</P>
<P>
   Using the ``whois'' command (neatly automated for novice
computer users at rs.internic.net/cgi-bin/whois), I quickly
scratched from my list Sweden, Denmark, South Africa, Switzerland,
New Zealand and Australia, all of which had been electronically
homesteaded by Lewises, or pretenders, before I got there.
</P>
<P>
   But the world is a big place, and the Internet is spreading.
More than 200 countries now offer Internet domain registrations
under their own two-letter country codes, like .jp for Japan and
.uk for Britain. The .us for the United States has until now been
used primarily by state and local governments.
</P>
<P>
   It is significant that more than 70 of these 200-plus countries
have no local residence requirement (most require merely some sort
of local presence) and, shall we say, relaxed concepts of trademark
law. Some have policies that allow any paying customer to register
names on a first-come, first-served basis, allowing a swift and
unscrupulous entrepreneur to register microsoft.xx or mcdonalds.xx.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Turkmenistan's country code .tm, might be mistaken for
a trademark notice, which has made it very popular. Turkmenistan is
one of many unlikely countries trying to capitalize on the demand
for Internet domain names and generate some income.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, domain registries have been marketing little
pieces of Bhutan (.bt), the Cocos Islands (.cc), Tuvalu (.tv),
Congo (.cd), Niue (.nu) and American Samoa (.as), among many
others.

 UNDATED: many others.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many of these burgeoning Internet paradises have no meaningful
communications infrastructure, at least in terms of the
big-bandwidth demands of the Internet, so they form partnerships
with Web-savvy companies in major cities like New York, San
Francisco and London. The all-important name-server computers,
which keep track of all the names and addresses of all the clients
in the given domain, are often tethered to high-capacity phone
lines thousands of miles away from the namesake country.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, I was beaten to lewis.tm by just one day, by someone in
England named Jones. Another British rival had registered lewis.cc,
from the Cocos. Even the microscopic island of Niue had already
issued lewis.nu to someone else.
</P>
<P>
   So I raced through the global Internet Packet network to the
South Pacific island of Tonga, only to discover that the same
Jones, who fittingly lives on Robin Hood Street in Gloucester, had
also snatched lewis.to just ahead of me. An information
superhighwayman, indeed.
</P>
<P>
   In frustration, I tried to register the first word that came to
mind _ one that cannot be printed in this newspaper _ prompting the
stinging rebuke from the Tongan computer. Tonga and its Internet
overseer, His Royal Highness Crown Prince Tupouto'a, are extremely
proud of the island's Christian heritage and ban pornography and
foul language.
</P>
<P>
   Turkmenistan recently suspended all new domain registrations
after it discovered that people were registering obscene and unholy
words. At this point I resolved to find the most remote speck in
the ocean, where the fame and prestige of the Lewis clan has not
yet spread. Spinning my globe, I picked a spot almost precisely at
the opposite end of the earth from my home and there found
Christmas Island.
</P>
<P>
   Christmas Island, a territory of Australia, has fewer than 900
residents. Surrounded by sharks, the island is home to one
television station, one AM radio station, one casino and several
million scuttling crabs. It is a veritable crab paradise, with 18
different species, including one so large and powerful that it
cracks coconuts with its pincers.
</P>
<P>
   But to me, the island's most interesting resource was _ at last!
_ an unclaimed spot for lewis.cx. A search of the domain's official
records revealed the welcome news that Christmas Island's domain is
administered by four name-server computers in London, presumably on
robust, crab-tolerant phone lines.
</P>
<P>
   With the end of my search so tantalizingly near, and with no
desire to navigate a foreign technical bureaucracy on my own, I
decided to use a domain name agent. One of the best agents is
Netnames USA (www.netnamesusa.com), which is based in New York and
boasts that it can easily and painlessly, if not exactly
inexpensively, register secondary domain names almost anywhere on
the globe.
</P>
<P>
   Netnames typically charges a onetime fee of $75 to set up each
.com, .net or .org domain and $249 to set up a national domain.
National domains also charge their own registration and annual
fees, which vary widely. The customer can also hire the agent to
administer the domain, in effect renting the use of the agent's
name servers.
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement can be temporary (until the domain name is
transferred to a local Internet service provider) or long-term.
Netnames allows the user to set up as many as five e-mail accounts
on the new domain without charge. Mail sent to pete(AT)lewis.cx,
for example, assuming I get the name, will automatically be
forwarded to my preferred e-mail account.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, requests sent to www.lewis.cx would be automatically
forwarded to the humble Web site that my preferred ISP provides
free _ but now I won't have to use a Web address that contains lots
of squiggles and dots and dashes and slashes.
</P>
<P>
   So for the bargain price of $249, I bought a piece of Christmas
Island. My application will be evaluated by the Christmas Island
domain administrator and will be operational as soon as I am
determined to be a good citizen, electronically speaking.
</P>
<P>
   And if I'm rejected, well, there can't possibly be many Lewises
in Antarctica or Tajikistan. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you're interested in getting your own domain name here are a
few helpful hints.
</P>
<P>
   Following are some of commercial registries for top-level
Internet domains, including national two-letter country code
domains. They handle, for a fee, all aspects of registering and
maintaining domestic and international domain names.

CHOOSE SOME `GOOD OLD DAYS' AND SEE HOW THEY REALLY WERE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Want to prove to your wisecracking, history-challenged progeny
that ``Roll Over Beethoven'' _ and not old Ludwig himself _ was all
the rage when you were born?
</P>
<P>
   For an instant dose of personal nostalgia, just beam your Web
browser to the dMarie Time Capsule (dmarie.com/asp/history.asp).
Once there, type in a birthday or other significant date. The Time
Capsule will reward you with a quick recap of the top headlines for
the three months surrounding that date and the sports achievements
and most popular songs from the year.
</P>
<P>
   You can find out other ephemera from that period, including
average income, the prices of a stamp and a gallon of milk, and
Academy Award winners. The site offers specific data for the years
1900 to 1997, although some facts from 1995 to 1997 are not
available yet.
</P>
<P>
   The Time Capsule comes courtesy of dMarie.com, a do-it-yourself
site that lets its users compile and lay out their own virtual
scrapbooks and also features chat rooms, discussion boards and a
poetry database.
</P>
<P>
   ``The information here is to serve as a fun, reminiscent stroll
through past days,'' reads a disclaimer on the Time Capsule page.
``Use it to put together a heritage page for your scrapbook _ NOT
for your school history report!''
</P>
<P>
   While the Capsule provides a soft-focus-lens look at a certain
time, surfing scholars looking for events occurring on a particular
day may need to dig a little deeper. The History Channel's Web site
has an online version of its popular ``This Day in History''
television spot (historychannel.com/thisday).
</P>
<P>
   After selecting a date, users are treated to a page of
historical and pop-culture events that took place on that day. For
instance, on this day in 1939, the first grocery-store shopping
cart was introduced in Oklahoma City. June 4 is also the birthday
of England's King George III (in 1738), and ``Love Me Do'' by his
future countrymen the Beatles was topping the American pop charts
on this date in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo also boasts an extensive list of time-specific tidbits on
its Today in History page. It includes a link to the Library of
Congress' Today in History site, illustrated with items from the
library's collection.
</P>
<P>
   More focused efforts, like the Literary Calender, Mathematicians
Throughout the Year and Today in Movies, also round out Yahoo's
collection (www.yahoo.com/Arts/Humanities/History/TodayinHistory).
</P>
<P>
   The brief synopses these history pages offer _ particularly if
you search, say, on your high-school graduation date _ are enough
to transport you, emotionally at least, back in time. And if you
can't remember all the words to what were your favorite songs, you
might find them at the Lyrics Library Homepage
(web2.kw.igs.net/wgarvin/ lyrics.html). You can find all the words
to ``American Pie'' there.

 By MICKEY MEECE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Nixon administration did it. So did Oliver North. And so
does Carole Harris.
</P>
<P>
   Shred, that is.
</P>
<P>
   Every day during the summer, Ms. Harris, 65, opens her mail on
the sun porch of her summer cottage in Buchanan, N.Y. She sorts it,
then shreds what she doesn't need in her $29 Royal Jaws personal
shredder, which sits on top of her wastebasket.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had always torn up my charge receipts into pieces before
putting them in the wastebasket,'' she said. Then last fall, she
said, she watched an NBC News report on how thieves needed only a
name and address to steal a person's identity, using that
information to set up fraudulent credit accounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, well, if I've got to tear up envelopes and anything
with names and addresses, that's a lot'' to do by hand or with
scissors, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The popularity of personal shredders has increased tremendously
in the past few years, said Jean Papagni, a Staples spokeswoman.
After the NBC News report in November, she said, there was an
uptick in sales, then steady sales throughout the holidays and into
tax season.
</P>
<P>
   Fear of so-called identity fraud _ said to be the nation's
fastest-growing type of consumer fraud _ is reason enough for some
people to buy shredders, said Todd W. Henreckson, director of the
General Binding Corp.'s Shredmaster division, in Northbrook, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public's becoming paranoid _ and not in an unreasonable
nature _ about their personal identity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Shredders have been around since the 1930s, and they became part
of the public vernacular during the Watergate years in the 1970s.
The Iran-Contra affair in the 1980s and a range of scandals in the
1990s drew more attention to shredders. For a long time, only
government agencies and corporations could afford them or the space
it took to store the shredders, which cost thousands of dollars and
took up about six cubic feet apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Then in 1990, Fellowes Manufacturing, the leading maker of
shredders, introduced two desktop versions, which sold for $149 and
$199. Other companies began making the machines, and prices
dropped; some 100,000 shredders were sold in that year in the
United States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Based on recent sales, manufacturers estimate that 3 million
personal shredders will be sold this year in stores like Staples,
Office Max, Office Depot, Best Buy, Wal-Mart and Sears, making the
machines the fastest-growing home office product.
</P>
<P>
   The buyers of small shredders include schools, people working at
home and professionals like lawyers, doctors and tax preparers.
Just the thought of someone rifling through their garbage is
motivation enough for many people to buy shredders.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court ruled in 1988 that the minute garbage is put
out to be picked up, it becomes part of the public domain and is no
longer private.
</P>
<P>
   Evan Hendricks, editor of Privacy Times, a newsletter based in
Washington, said shredding documents was smart because ``identity
theft is a growing problem to the extent of becoming a national
epidemic.''
</P>
<P>
   Shredders appeal to people like Carol Story, a member of a co-op
board on the New York's Upper West Side who plans to ask the board
to buy one. She routinely has to shred by hand or with scissors
applications that are two or three inches thick. ``We get people's
private information, a lot of it,'' she said. ``What do you do with
it? I spend a fair amount of time destroying these papers. I sit in
front of the television and shred it myself.''
</P>
<P>
   To protect personal information, shredders aren't the last line
of defense. While shredders can help prevent the theft of personal
information from garbage, professional thieves often steal things
like credit card applications in the mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like the wild, wild West out there,'' Hendricks said,
``and to protect your privacy you have to be Jesse James.'' He
recommends that you try to keep private any information like names,
addresses, Social Security numbers, dates of birth, mothers' maiden
names and driver's license numbers. You should also check your
credit report once a year.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps not surprisingly, retired people, like Ms. Harris, seem
to be on the leading edge of shredder buying. Tony Storrie, vice
president and general manager of the Fellowes Powershred Division
in Itasca, Ill., said: ``A lot of retired or elderly people who
have a lifetime's worth of documents are also sensitive to the
criminal issues. They are more likely to take precautions.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Harris enjoys her Royal shredder so much that she bought a
shredder for each of her four children, and she plans to take her
shredder back home to Harrisburg, Pa., in the fall and use it there
for the rest of the year. She shreds the name and address labels
that she tears off envelopes and catalogs, along with credit card
receipts and credit card applications. ``It's there all the time,''
she said. ``I use it every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Choosing a Shredder
</P>
<P>
   Choosing among personal shredders depends upon how you intend to
use the machine and, more important, how much security you feel you
need.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT KIND OF MATERIAL DO YOU WANT TO SHRED?
</P>
<P>
   _Junk mail, documents from work, tax information? That
determines the throat size needed.
</P>
<P>
   HOW OFTEN DO YOU EXPECT TO USE IT?
</P>
<P>
   _That will help you decide how many sheets you want the machine
to handle at once.
</P>
<P>
   DOES IT MATTER WHICH TYPE OF CUT THE SHREDDER MAKES?
</P>
<P>
   _Some shredders cut paper in spaghetti-like strips, while others
cross-cut to make what resembles confetti.
</P>
<P>
   The portable Shredmaster Confidential from GBC, for example,
weighs two pounds and costs $24.99. It is good for shredding ATM
and credit card receipts, but a standard sheet of paper must be
folded in half before shredding. More practical for light use is
the company's best-selling model, the 40S, which sells for $29.99
and weighs four pounds. In an unscientific test, the unit performed
nicely on up to three stapled sheets of regular-sized paper, but it
slowed when fed four and five sheets. With the long, thin strips,
your wastebasket is likely to fill up quickly (a plus if you need
packing material).
</P>
<P>
   If you believe those spaghetti strips could somehow be pieced
together, you can spend more for a cross-shredder, which reduces
your potentially revealing documents to tiny pieces of paper.
</P>
<P>
   Fellowes's Powershred PS60 CC, a cross-cutter that costs
$159.99, works like a paper tiger, chewing up to seven sheets at a
pass. The biggest drawback, however, is its size and weight _ it
weighs 18 pounds. It is hard to lift the shredder on and off the
wastebasket it comes with.
</P>
<P>
   Less impressive is the GBC 55X cross-cutter, which sells for
$99, weighs 12 pounds and is supposedly designed for up to three
sheets at a time. The machine works noticeably hard to make its
confetti. Two sheets are about as much as it can take before
getting stuck. Once the shredder sticks, you have to use the
reverse and forward buttons to free the paper. If that doesn't
work, you have to unplug it and turn it upside down for a good
shake.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of getting stuck, all the shredders display warnings
regarding long hair, jewelry and ties: all candidates for getting
caught in the machines.

TURNING DESKTOPS INTO THEME PARKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
(th) 
 By MICHELLE SLATALLA    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The only defense I will offer for my recent behavior _ I just
spent hours playing with dinosaurs _ is this: My children made me
do it.
</P>
<P>
   My young daughters are obsessed with dinosaurs. Yours probably
are, too, so I would not be surprised to learn that you have also
been sucked into the vortex of the ``desktop theme'' craze that is
overtaking home computer users.
</P>
<P>
   Theme programs are the next iteration of screen savers; they're
screen savers on speed. Not only do they change the background on
your monitor, but they often use video and sound to transform other
elements of your desktop into, well, a theme park, or, in my case,
a two-dimensional facsimile of Jurassic Park.
</P>
<P>
   PC desktop customizing has come a long way since the old days,
when the definition of a mind-bending screen saver was something
that projected images of tropical fish swimming languidly. Today's
theme programs take various components of your desktop _ the
wallpaper, the screen saver, fonts, icons, sounds _ and repackage
them around a single theme.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the Dinosaurs program written for Windows
computers by Hank Van Winkle, a graduate student at Northern
Illinois University, mutated all the icons on my desktop. The My
Computer icon became a little image of the head of an angry T. rex,
and the Recycling Bin turned into a skeletal version of same. The
background on the monitor was a hungry T. rex rudely mauling an
unlucky triceratops. When I started up my computer, I heard a roar.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and the mouse pointer turned into a claw. That was the part
my daughters liked most.
</P>
<P>
   If you are wondering just how hot the themes trend is, consider
that in the three weeks since Tucows Interactive opened a new site,
www.freethemes.com, traffic to the site has grown to 100,000 views
a day. ``That's what we call popular,'' said Elliot Noss, vice
president of Tucows. ``It's probably because themes allow you to
control the look and feel of your desktop in a way you couldn't
before.''
</P>
<P>
   At www.hotfiles.com, ZDNet's download site, one of the most
requested software programs is a simple shareware utility called
Desktop Themes, which enables the Windows operating system to
recognize and accept themes.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few months ago, this shareware program didn't even exist,
and now it has become one of the most popular programs in our
library,'' said Preston Gralla, executive editor for the ZDNet
software library.
</P>
<P>
   The reason that themes are proving so popular is that people
identify with their computers. Computers aren't just machines
anymore. They have become little buddies who take us to new places,
introduce us to new activities and claim more and more of our
waking hours.
</P>
<P>
   Most computers look relatively generic _ could you really pick
out a particular Windows box from a lineup? But users want to
invest them with a personality. Remember when all your Macintosh
friends used to give their machines friendly names like Mabel,
Skeezer or Rover? In that same spirit, you can now load a desktop
theme.
</P>
<P>
   And you can choose from thousands of themes: sports themes; pop
culture themes, like Titanic or the Spice Girls or the Rug Rats, or
themes that send alien space invaders scurrying across your
desktop. I even ran across a program titled Kill Them Seagulls,
described rather drily as capable of importing 605 kilobytes of
anti-seagull sentiment to your desktop.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cool,'' said Zoe, my 9-year-old. ``Let's get that one next.''
</P>
<P>
   Why not? Putting aside for the moment any fears I had of
inciting the wrath of animal rights activists, installing a theme
on my Windows machine is incredibly easy. Soon, I was enjoying the
spectacle of dozens of seagulls flying across my screen;
occasionally, one is shot and falls from the sky with a strangled
squawk.
</P>
<P>
   And I did not even have to download the Desktop Themes utility
because my computer maker chose to install Microsoft Plus in the
factory. Introduced in 1995 as an enhancement to Windows, Microsoft
Plus is a package of entertainment and utility programs that was,
in fact, responsible for spawning the themes revolution. Plus has a
program in it that hangs, like a hook, off the Windows operating
system. You can, in turn, hang any desktop theme on the hook.
</P>
<P>
   Plus comes with about a dozen themes of its own, including a
Mystery theme that reminds me of the Clue board game, a science
theme and an artsy Leonardo da Vinci theme that displays sketches
and his famous signature on screen.
</P>
<P>
   If you have Plus and want to check out the themes furnished by
Microsoft, look in your Control Panel. Double click on the Desktop
Themes icon to sample them all.
</P>
<P>
   For those of you feeling like Hamlet, trying to decide whether
it is worth the bother to upgrade to the Windows 98 operating
system (``Alas, poor 95! I knew it, Horatio.''), Microsoft is
offering this inducement: more themes! After soliciting feedback
from focus groups, Microsoft decided to upgrade Plus 98 to include
themes based upon favorite characters from the Cathy or Doonesbury
comic strips.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did it because we got a wish list of the things that users
wanted to add to the operating system,'' said Kim Akers, a
Microsoft product manager. ``And this was one of the top things on
the list.''
</P>
<P>
   I doubt that the Dinosaurs theme will linger on my home-office
computer for long. My daughters will soon tire of it, and after
all, it really does not reflect my own personality.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, I do not look forward to the household
discussion about a replacement. Something tells me a Godzilla theme
may be in my future.
</P>
<P>
   __
</P>
<P>
   To use desktop themes, you need a computer that runs Windows 95.
If you don't have Microsoft Plus (which costs about $39 in stores),
you can download a shareware tool. Here are some helpful sites:
</P>
<P>
   _ TUCOWS INTERACTIVE: www.freethemes.com
</P>
<P>
   Has themes and a handful of other tools.
</P>
<P>
   _ ZDNET'S DESKTOP THEMES: www.hotfiles.com
</P>
<P>
   Allows you to download theme programs.
</P>
<P>
   _ ZDNET'S CUSTOM THEMES: www.hyperactivex.com
</P>
<P>
   Helps you create a customized theme. You need to run Microsoft's
Internet Explorer browser to use this site, where you can choose
things like screen backgrounds and screen savers.

MOM ENDED THE FIGHT OF THE CENTURY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MONICA FRAZIER ANDERSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I'm really not a true boxing fan. Sure, I watched Mike Tyson
bite a hunk out of Evander Holyfield's ear, but other than a few
highly publicized matches, I haven't seen many fights.
</P>
<P>
   So you can take it with a grain of salt or you can suspend
disbelief and roll with me on this, but the best fight there ever
was took place in Fort Worth, 18 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   It was a lightweight match between two of the strongest,
meanest, maddest pugilists in Cowtown.
</P>
<P>
   This wasn't one of those pretty-boy, celebrity matches where the
fans wear suits and the ring announcer is in a tuxedo. There
weren't any ringside analysts describing the action and recalling
their own days between the ropes.
</P>
<P>
   The media did not cover this event, though goodness knows I wish
I had a video of that match. In fact, this fight wasn't even
announced in advance because it was totally spontaneous. A few of
us just happened to be around when the melee began.
</P>
<P>
   When we heard the loud arguing between the two opponents, we
formed a circle around them and stood there waiting for the
punchfest to begin. We didn't have to wait long, either.
</P>
<P>
   Sherri Bodine said: ``Is that my blouse you have on? Didn't I
tell you not to borrow my clothes without asking?''
</P>
<P>
   Her sister, Terri Bodine, answered: ``So what? I look better in
this blouse than you do anyway; at least that's what your boyfriend
said.''
</P>
<P>
   Sherri's boyfriend, Karl, who had been quietly observing this
exchange, started doing the moonwalk, and he just kept sliding
backward until he was out the door. Luckily for him, school had
just been dismissed so he could retreat to the safety of his home
until the next day.
</P>
<P>
   Sherri was furious for good reason. Terri hadn't borrowed just
ANY blouse. No, this was one of those classic white polyester
blouses with ruffles around the collars and the sleeves. It even
had a big bow in front for no apparent reason. It certainly wasn't
a blouse you would ordinarily wear to school, unless it was picture
day.
</P>
<P>
   To add insult to injury, there was a red ketchup stain on the
front of the blouse and two large wet spots under the arms. I would
have been mad, too, if it had been my blouse.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, they argued some more, and then Sherri pushed Terri. Oh,
it was on after that!
</P>
<P>
   Sherri was jabbing and bobbing like a professional, but Terri
fought like a wildcat. She was doing that windmill thing, where you
just swing your arms furiously and hope you hit something. We were
all laughing and egging them on like the moral and compassionate
teen-agers that we were. At one point, Sherri grabbed a fistful of
the blouse and pulled so hard that one sleeve came off.
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, the fans became hysterical. In response, Terri
did a swan dive and grabbed the hem of Sherri's skirt. Both the
skirt and Terri ended up on the floor. The place went wild. We were
enjoying ourselves so much that we were all startled when we heard
a very deep, very familiar, grown-up voice say, ``What is going on
here?''
</P>
<P>
   That stern voice belonged to the last person on Earth any of us
wanted to upset: Mrs. Bodine.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Bodine was 6 feet 2 inches in her bare feet. She drove a
truck before it was cool for women to drive pickups. Her arms were
as big as our principal's legs.
</P>
<P>
   As she approached, we parted like the Red Sea. It was so quiet,
you could have heard a gnat sneeze. Mrs. Bodine just stood there a
moment, looking at her daughters and breathing fire. The rest of us
ran like scared rabbits. I zoomed past Karl in the parking lot,
still moon-walking toward the bus. I don't know what happened to
the Bodine girls that day, but they were awfully nice to each other
for the rest of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The other morning, my youngest son came downstairs in his
brother's favorite baggy shorts. He didn't think I noticed. I
didn't say a word as I watched him lace up his athletic shoes for a
game of basketball with some of the neighborhood boys.
</P>
<P>
   When my older son yelled out from his room, ``Mom, I can't find
my JNCOs!'' The little one headed for the door in haste.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tyler, wait!'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, mom?'' he answered with one foot out the door.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you wearing a good pair of underwear?''

TWISTER: THE REALITY HITS HOME 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN LYNCH  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MECHANICVILLE, N.Y. _ There were two of them, a man and a woman.
They were huddled beneath a single umbrella on a rain-soaked
hillside where, just a few hours earlier, God had let loose with a
ferocious sneeze.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard it before I saw it,'' Joe Thomas was telling me. ``It
sounded like a train coming through. Then it came right down this
street. There are trees here, they're a hundred years old, and it
just picked them up, pulled them right out of the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   As he spoke, a jagged ribbon of lightning flashed across the
leaden sky. It bathed the wreckage that was Mulberry Street in a
brief, eerie glow. Joe Thomas wrapped his arm more tightly around
his wife, Maryann. She was worried about rain pouring through a
ragged, gaping wound in the house in which they had lived for 32
years, before a tornado touched down in a part of the world where
tornadoes aren't supposed to exist.
</P>
<P>
   Twisters are supposed to be creatures of the prairie. They're
supposed to come to life in flat, rectangular states where tiny
farming towns field five-man high school football teams. But this
one touched down Sunday evening on a hilltop in Mechanicville, an
old mill town on the west bank of the Hudson just north of the
state capital of Albany. It leveled the hill's crest, spraying the
remains of the houses it consumed for thousands of yards in every
direction, snapping power poles, picking up cars as if they were
made of Styrofoam. Then it tore down the hill and toppled one of
the two towering brick smokestacks of an old paper mill before it
whirled across the river to die as it hit the Hudson's eastern
shore.
</P>
<P>
   Miraculously, in its life of only a minute or so, the twister
killed no one and injured only a few. It left that mangled and
bleeding, but it took no lives _ only the possessions that people
accumulate as they live.
</P>
<P>
   The red Mustang, for example. I found it up the hill on
Stillwater Street Sunday night. Imagine a car with its roof
flattened as if by a huge, almighty fist. It sat there in the
street, electrical wires wrapped around it like pythons, its
headlights still gleaming in the darkness.
</P>
<P>
   ``There had to be two of them,'' Joe Thomas was saying. ``You
look here at Nassau Street, and you can see what it did. Well, it
did the same thing one street over. And the street in between
wasn't hit at all. But up the hill, way up, My God. The houses are
just gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe and Maryann Thomas weren't supposed to be on the hill that
night. Rescue workers had come through to evacuate everybody after
the tornado touched down. But this was home, and they were hanging
around, hoping to get back inside.
</P>
<P>
   I'd been blocked as I drove into Mechanicville from the south. A
rescue worker directing traffic told me I'd have to walk to the
scene, a distance of several miles, in a downpour. When I got there
I found television vehicles all over the place and a checkpoint of
cops keeping people off the hill.
</P>
<P>
   So, I walked down the road, found the path of the twister and
followed it in the darkness. It led behind a shopping center and
across a set of railroad tracks surrounded by chain link fencing _
until the twister came through.
</P>
<P>
   I crossed the tracks and found two fire hoses hanging down a
muddy bank. I grabbed one hose and climbed hand over hand up the
bank until I reached a flat site. Looking around in the darkness, I
realized I was standing where a 30-foot house trailer has been
picked up by the twister and thrown aside as though it were no more
than a tin can.
</P>
<P>
   The power of a thing like this boggles the mind. And, oddly
enough, I'd actually seen another one, a miniature version, only a
few days before. On Friday afternoon, traveling west on the New
York Thruway, I'd found myself in a driving rain and buffeted by
strong winds. Then, next to the highway just as I passed the spot,
a flying collection of dust and dirt swirled into a distinct
funnel.
</P>
<P>
   The wind hit my two-ton vehicle with a ferocious thump. For a
brief moment, I felt the two right wheels leave the pavement. Then
I stomped on the gas and watched in my rearview mirror as the
mini-twister evaporated. And two days later, a vaster larger,
meaner version of the same thing ripped through a community only
miles from where I live.
</P>
<P>
   So, what is this _ the Northeast's balmy winter, a vicious
January ice storm in New York's North Country up near the Canadian
border, a towering tornado in a rolling Northeastern community
where none has ever formed before?
</P>
<P>
   Is this the product of Global Warming? El Nino? Who knows?
</P>
<P>
   Although, I did read where some guy in California named Al Nino
got 100 phone calls when the weather got weird out there last fall.
People were demanding to know why he was doing this horrible thing
to them.
</P>
<P>
   That explanation makes as much sense as anything else.
</P>

 GREETING CARDS, JUST A CLICK AWAY  (js) 
 By TINA KELLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The appearance of the site www.bluemountain.com at the top of
various lists of popular sites has left Web watchers scratching
their heads. Blue Mountain Arts is a small greeting card company
based in Boulder, Colo., and known for its sincere if slightly
treacly sentiment. But on the net, the Blue Mountain site is
beating out big names like Disney Online, the bookseller Amazon.com
and the Hotmail free e-mail service.
</P>
<P>
   The site, which attracted more than 5,085,000 individual
visitors in April, offers electronic personalized greeting cards
commemorating everything from first holy communion to the death of
a pet. For those occasions when you care enough to click the
``send'' button, you can send messages which can include a picture
and room for a personal sentiment; some feature animation and
music.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just goes to show how different the web is from anything
else before it, in terms of business,'' said Stacie Leone of Media
Metrix, a New York firm that measures web audiences and recently
found Blue Mountain to be the most popular shopping website. ``A
site like this that doesn't advertise and doesn't make any money
out of its website can skyrocket to the top.''
</P>
<P>
   Media Metrix found the site ranked 13th among home computer
users and 15th among people using their computers at work.
RelevantKnowledge Inc., an Atlanta firm that tracks a panel of web
users, ranked it 17th most popular among all domain names in April.
</P>
<P>
   To send greetings to friends who have e-mail accounts, senders
pick designs and messages, or write their own, fill out address
labels, and send the completed greetings to another part of the
company's web page. Recipients automatically get e-mail
announcements including a website address and a message number.
Visit the website, plug in your number, see the picture and
message, and consider yourself duly greeted.
</P>
<P>
   James McQuivey, an analyst of online retail strategies for
Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass., explained part of the
site's success. ``They have this little secret going for them. When
you use one of their cards and send it to a friend, he or she has
to log into the site to receive it,'' thereby doubling the number
of visitors, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Blue Mountain, which also sells cards on paper, has been able to
find a market for electronic cards for Waitress Day, World
Environment Day, the Jewish holiday of Shavuot and Eid Norouz, the
Persian holiday.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the physical greeting card industry, you don't have the
market there, but on the web, it's not like those cards are taking
up retail real estate,'' said Jared Schutz, Blue Mountain's
director of business development. ``We can offer cards for holidays
we wouldn't necessarily offer in a store.''
</P>
<P>
   Blue Mountain's competitors include Greet Street
(http://greetstreet.com/) which charges 50 cents per greeting, and
the greetings are sent directly to the recipient's e-mail address.
Another site, 123Greetings (http://123greetings.com/) features
messages in the form of kisses, cats, pizzas, virtual money
(missives with pictures of bills, you choose the denomination) and
Cuddly Tuddly, a collection of alarmingly cute stuffed animals. The
site is slow, requiring the sender to click through nine screens to
send a message.
</P>
<P>
   Hallmark (www.hallmark.com) charges $2.50 for greetings
featuring animation and sound. The site requires customers _ even
those ordering the free, lower-tech virtual greetings _ to sign in
with a mailing address and password. The form asks ``Would you like
to receive information about Hallmark products, services and
events?'' Not surprisingly, the default answer, Yes, is already
checked.
</P>
<P>
   (This is not the first time Hallmark is losing out to the
smaller card company, which in 1986 successfully sued Hallmark to
keep it from producing a line of cards copied from Blue Mountain
Arts' line.)
</P>
<P>
   Another site, based in Hong Kong, (http://www.icard.com.hk/)
allows senders to add their own photos and sound files to their
greetings. An alphabetical listing of electronic postcards,
covering topics from AngelWinks Heavenly Postcards to the Zodiacal
Zephyr Card Shop, is available at
(http://www.wp.com/annag/ecards.htm).
</P>
<P>
   And check out the Amstel site (http://www.amstel.nl/cam2.htm),
with sendable views from a live camera. What better way to say
``Having a wonderful time. Wish you were here''?

A CALL TO GAME DESIGNERS TO HEAR THE BEAT 
</HEADLINE>
  (gm) 
 By J.C. HERZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Entrain,'' Brian Moriarty said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the hundreds of video game designers assembled at the
Computer Game Developers' Conference in Long Beach, Calif., not one
seemed to have the slightest idea what he was talking about.
</P>
<P>
   They had shown up because Moriarty is one of the industry's old
soldiers, someone who wrote early text adventures like Beyond Zork
and has stuck around long enough to oversee an online multiplayer
game network, Mpath Interactive, on the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``The word has its origin in the Middle French verb entrainer,''
Moriarty continued. ``It means to draw along. To induce into a
rhythm. To coax into a flow. Entrainment is a ubiquitous natural
phenomenon. It occurs in the vicinity of any rhythmic expression of
energy. Play a note on a violin, and you'll hear the same note
ringing on an adjacent piano. Rotate a magnet inside a coil of
wire, and the vortex of flux will induce a sympathetic pulse of
electric current. Opera singers use entrainment to shatter glass.''
</P>
<P>
   Games, he argued, produce entrainment effects as well. Look at
someone playing Quake, with the attendant body movements,
breathing, yelps of fear, howls of frustration and grunts of
satisfaction. ``You will find yourself in the presence of a curious
creature: a twitching, blinking, buzzing bundle of nerves deeply
engaged in a frantic conversation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This creature has its own language _ a language with
sentences, paragraphs and all kinds of punctuation. Be still,
observe, and you will notice certain chronic tendencies in the
communications of this creature. It keeps coming back to the same
few subjects, circling around and back, around and back. The image
and sound also manifest a succession of repeating sensations.
There's a regular alternation of shadow and light. A cycle of
action and response.
</P>
<P>
   ``Be still, observe, and you will recognize periodicity.
Periodicity in time, also known as rhythm. And periodicity in
space, which we call patterns. Rhythms and patterns. Every game has
them. Solitaire. Hopscotch. Chess. Quake. Myst. Gemstone. Ultima.
These games and all others can be described as entrainment engines.
Systems designed to coax the behavior of participants into mutually
satisfying rhythms and patterns. As a game designer, you are an
entrainment engineer.''
</P>
<P>
   Viewing computer games through this new lens, it was suddenly
obvious why they are so much fun, and why it is so difficult to
explain the thrill to non-gamers.
</P>
<P>
   Non-gamers cannot see the payoff because they are looking only
at what is on the screen: The graphics. The 3-D architecture. The
cinematic violence. And because they cannot work the controllers,
because, for whatever psychological or generational reason, they
can't participate in the experience, non-gamers see a player
immersed in a video game and think his rapturous attention stems
from the particular qualities of those images. To a critic of video
games, it looks as if the spectacle of cinematic violence is
triggering little outbursts of joy.
</P>
<P>
   After all, that is how other moving images work. They are
stimuli. They trigger a response. The causality is clear. When
non-gamers see people playing Nintendo 64, they see it as analogous
to watching television and movies.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, this analogy is so flawed that it is useless. The
appeal of video games _ the whole point of them, really _ is that
you are not simply receiving a signal. You are a signal. You act,
and the environment responds. And vice versa. It's a channel of
continuous two-way feedback. Playing a video game is not like
watching television. It's like dancing. It's like playing music.
</P>
<P>
   Computer-rendered violence _ the martial arts strikes, the
gunshots, the laser fire _ is appealing not because it looks good
on the screen; it is appealing because it's percussive. It's a
drum. It's a cymbal. If you're going to strike a note, destruction
is satisfying because it makes the loudest bang. Your targets don't
need to be figurative. You could be blowing up beautifully rendered
abstract blobs and it wouldn't make much of a difference.
</P>
<P>
   Critics are obsessed with the esthetics of video game violence.
But the debate about increasing levels of realism in computer games
is a red herring. It is not the visual component of violence that
players find so compelling.
</P>
<P>
   It's the rhythm: Duck. Fire. Duck. Fire. Fire. Reload. Fire.
It's the patterns of action and reaction, patterns that are
spontaneous and jagged and almost entirely dissonant. It makes
perfect sense that most of the people who play violent computer
games are adolescent boys and young men. Look at the music they
listen to. Dissonance is a selling point. And dissonance has its
place. The world has room for punk rock _ or for Stravinsky's
``Rite of Spring.''
</P>
<P>
   But it also has room for other kinds of music, and the
interactive entertainment industry has been loath to fill that
space. Games that prompt reflection rather than survival-related
stress are viewed with some disdain among game designers. They hold
Myst in the same contempt that Bartok aficionados reserve for
Pachabel and Brahms. But Myst continues to outsell Duke Nukem for
the same reason that Bach will always outsell the Polish composer
Krzysztof Penderecki. Dissonance alienates people. Sometimes it
alienates them in thought-provoking ways, but it begs for
justification. Meter and harmony justify themselves. People like to
sing along. They like to dance. They like to join.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do sports fans create and sustain the Wave?'' Moriarty
said. ``Why is it such a joy for 50,000 people to coordinate their
behavior? For the same reason it's such a joy for two people.
Because we are wired for it. Just look at those fans, with their
goofy hats, loud Bermuda shorts and T-shirts stained with mustard.
Tens of millions of them. They are the potential audience for
multiplayer games. They enjoy coordinating their behavior. They
want to play together. The designer who figures out how to reach
these people with the online equivalent of the Wave will be a hero.
A very wealthy hero.''
</P>
<P>
   A roomful of game designers smelled the catnip. They pondered
the challenge. As the lights came up, without the slightest
provocation, the crowd burst into the synchronous cacophony
otherwise known as applause. All those video game designers are
back in their cubicles now, writing code. Let's hope the next
inning of game development produces something worthy of the Wave.

SORTING OUT YOUR LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   (ART ADV: Photo is being sent to NYT photo clients. Non-subscribers

 (bl)  
 By PHIL PATTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Is it warm weather that inspires the desire to put household
objects in order? Something that provokes the taking up of arms
against a winter's accumulation, the determination to stem the
relentless tide of miscellany, to put things at last in their
place?
</P>
<P>
   Sorting things implies a greater order in one's life. I'm drawn
by the grids of such order, and fascinated by those tiny sets of
clear plastic drawersthat give nuts and bolts the precision and
randomness of fishing tackle. I'm drawn to cunning Rubbermaid
plastic organizers, to the magazine boxes at Ikea or Sam Flax, to
everything that holds things at Hold Everything and to such pieces
of furniture as the round gridded shelves called RD2 11 displayed
by Lush Life, a Los Angeles design group, at a recent furniture
show.
</P>
<P>
   Many people seem convinced that if they just had the right
closet organizer, kitchen pantry or sorting bins they could get
everything under control at last. It is the furniture equivalent of
the desires that draw people to date-and-address systems like the
Dayrunner or Franklin planner or their electronic equivalents: the
Palm Pilot, the Rex or the Psion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personal organizers,'' such devices are called, are as much
about taking hold of your personality as your personal effects. In
the home, furniture works the same way.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the current fashionable pinnacle of organizing: the
French postal sorting desk, with its 36 square compartments of
metal mesh arranged in a Cartesian gird, with a work surface and
swing-away seat. Cristina Grajales of 1950, a furniture store on
Lafayette Street in Manhattan, sold her first postal sorter seven
years ago. She came upon it in a Paris flea market and later found
a steady French supplier; she now has 50. In 1950 and other stores,
the sorters retail for about $4,000.
</P>
<P>
   Applying some kind of ultimate imprimatur, Martha Stewart uses a
postal sorter she bought from 1950 as a desk. Ms. Grajales sold one
to a fashion designer and another to a photographer, who converted
the work surface into a light table. Susan Orlean, an author and
writer for The New Yorker, uses one to stow her collections of
green pottery and globes, as well as her bills.
</P>
<P>
   Designed by Roux Spitz in the 1930s, the postal sorter remained
in use through the 1960s. Perhaps the fact that it is French
increases its appeal. The French, after all, invented the Cartesian
grid of the pigeonholes and, with their passion for surrealism and
collage, pioneered the sort of meaningful juxtaposition the postal
sorter makes possible.
</P>
<P>
   Many things fit no neat category of pigeonhole or drawer; many
don't fit at all. Ms. Orlean has come up with a high concept
category in her kitchen. ``I have a drawer,'' she said, ``just for
measuring equipment.'' There she keeps not just measuring spoons
but the candy thermometer and the dry-weight scales.
</P>
<P>
   In urban apartments, simply fitting it all in is a challenge.
When hiding things is not possible, displaying them becomes
performance art. Making a virtue of necessity, organizational
furniture can become a means of personal expression, somewhere
between kindergarten cubby and Joseph Cornell box. Laden with
objects of personal meaning _ whether car keys or vacation
souvenirs _ organizer furniture can become a dovecote for flights
of fancy.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Collector's Cabinet,'' a show at the National Gallery in
Washington, explores the 17th-century tradition of the
Wunderkammer, or cabinet of curiosity, encompassing art, craft and
natural specimens. The miscellany aimed to be encyclopedic and
expressive: Chinese porcelain sat beside a rare shell, beside a
clever sextant.
</P>
<P>
   I think of the miscellaneous collection on my discount
veneer-composite shelves as a modern Wunderkammer. There, bird's
nests and wasp's nests, a mini flashlight, a Super Bowl XXX
matchbook and three microcassettes coexist with a glass insulator
that once held up electric lines.
</P>
<P>
   Small wonders, perhaps, but my own.

TENSIONS FLARE ANEW WITH NEIGHBORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DANIEL GOLDEN AND JOHN YEMMA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; When they drew up the guest list for President Clinton's
commencement address Friday at Massachusetts Institute of
Technology , MIT officials remembered the adage, ``All politics is
local.'' So President Charles Vest invited the Cambridge city
council.
</P>
<P>
   But Cambridge's other world-famous university neglected to pay
the councilors the same courtesy. Harvard did not invite them to
its graduation Thursday (June 4) until a Globe reporter asked about
the omission.
</P>
<P>
   Such oversights only inflame the re-emerging tensions between
Harvard and its neighbors. Unlike competitors Stanford and Duke,
which enjoy thousands of acres of elbow room, Harvard is hemmed
into 446 acres in Boston and Cambridge, which has the sixth-highest
population density in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   After a decade in which Harvard sold twice as much Cambridge
property as it bought and renovated rather than built, the
university is expanding. Its ambitions are colliding with a
grass-roots resistance Harvard administrators term ``BANANA,'' _
Build Almost Nothing Anywhere Near Anything.
</P>
<P>
   Unquestionably, town-gown relations have improved since 1956
when former Cambridge Mayor Alfred Vellucci proposed paving Harvard
Yard. Now, a revolving door is replacing the brick wall between
campus and community.
</P>
<P>
   Kathy Spiegelman, former assistant Cambridge city manager, heads
Harvard's office of planning and real estate, and former Boston
School Committee member Kevin McCluskey is its liaison to Allston.
Cambridge Mayor Francis Duehay and Councilor Kenneth Reeves are
Harvard alumni, while Councilor Kathleen Born, an architect, has
renovated homes of Harvard officials.
</P>
<P>
   But superficial goodwill masks tensions. ``I hold most Harvard
administrators personally in very high regard,'' Born says. ``But
I'm baffled by some of the decisions coming out of there.''
</P>
<P>
   Born is puzzled by Harvard's plan for a massive home for the
government department on the northeast edge of campus, behind the
Graduate School of Design. The 60,000-square-foot, six-story
building could imperil two historic homes and a tree-lined
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   The building would sit just inside the ``Red Line,'' the campus
boundary set by Harvard and Cambridge a quarter-century ago. Local
activists complain that the university is overloading its frontier.
They call for a gradual transition from the campus to the
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because the campus has a traditional core, Harvard's path of
least resistance is to push at the edges,'' says John Pitkin,
president of the mid-Cambridge Neighborhood Assocation. ``It's the
neighborhood's job to push harder.''
</P>
<P>
   Cambridge activists pushed so hard that they drove Harvard
across the Charles River into Allston. Taking the neighborhood by
surprise, Harvard announced last year that it had secretly acquired
14 properties totalling 52 acres. Combined with the medical school,
the Allston purchases give Harvard as much land in Boston as in
Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard is likely to use the Allston property for administrative
functions. While many residents are pleased at the upgrade from
auto repair shops and deserted warehouses, they worry about higher
rents _ and becoming a battleground between Harvard and Boston
University. Both are eyeing the Conrail yards on either side of the
turnpike.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bought my house here 20 years ago and I couldn't afford to
rent here today,'' says Paul Berkeley, who represents Allston on
task forces with Harvard and BU. ``If you're a person of average
means, the universities make it tougher.''
</P>
<P>
   But the price of gentrification must be balanced against the
economic benefits provided by Harvard: 5,000 jobs for Boston and
Cambridge residents; nearly $300 million a year in contracts for
local vendors; and millions of dollars in tourist income for hotels
and restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard, which owns 2,300 housing units in Cambridge, sold 100
units to the city last year at one-third of market value to ease
the end of rent control. Harvard pays taxes on commercial property,
including University Place and the Inn at Harvard Square. It makes
payments in lieu of taxes to Boston ($1.3 million) and Cambridge
($1.5 million). By contrast, BU pays Boston $1.6 million, Yale pays
New Haven $1.6 million and MIT pays Cambridge $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   But Cambridge officials aren't satisfied; they also want to tax
Harvard and MIT on now-exempt research facilities that develop
lucrative products.
</P>
<P>
   Many faculty and students volunteer in community service. Law
students represent thousands of low-income clients each year;
medical students help to fight Hepatitis B in Boston's Asian
community; business students act as mentors, tutors, coaches, and
pen pals in a Boston middle school; and undergraduates teach dance
and movement to Cambridge fourth- and fifth-graders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harvard is deeply committed to being a resource in our local
communities, particularly the public schools,'' says Mary Power,
Harvard director of community relations.
</P>
<P>
   But it may not be committed to Stamatis Eliades. For 22 years,
he's run Three Aces Pizza in Cambridge, one of four small
businesses near Harvard Law School. Harvard, their landlord, has
raised their rents nearly 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Spiegelman says Harvard is asking the market rate, but she
acknowledges that the law school will eventually take over the
location. Eliades says the university wants to drive out the
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people are supporting us,' Eliades says. ``They're very
upset with Harvard, what it's doing around here, trying to take
over the city.''

 c.1997 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The May edition of Harvard's in-house library journal contains a
glowing tribute to Jeanne T. Newlin, former curator of the Harvard
Theatre Collection, announcing her appointment as honorary curator.
</P>
<P>
   The article fails to mention that this distinction was granted
following the settlement last January of her lawsuit against
Harvard. In it, she alleged that she was fired because a homosexual
administrator discriminated against her as a heterosexual. The case
pitted the university against prominent supporters of Newlin,
including Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and oil tycoon
Frederick Koch.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute that heated up the climate-controlled library system
illuminates a weakness of Harvard's decentralized governance. Power
struggles and personal animosities fester unchecked in the
subterranean bastions where outsiders rarely stray.
</P>
<P>
   The Theatre Collection melodrama featured a strong-willed
heroine, let go for supposed insensitive treatment of employees,
who then herself claimed to be a victim of a type of discrimination
_ anti-heterosexual _ unrecognized by state law and unprecedented
in Harvard legal history. ``This is unique in my experience,'' says
Anne Taylor, Harvard vice president and general counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Newlin and her attorney, Nancy Shilepsky, declined comment.
Supporters call her a ``superstar,'' as renowned in her sphere as
Alan Dershowitz or Stephen Jay Gould in theirs.
</P>
<P>
   After taking over as curator in 1972, she built the collection
into the nation's most complete archive of theatrical scripts,
photographs, and other memorabilia. Loyal to Harvard and fiercely
protective of her piece of it, she attracted major donations and
bequests. ``Much of the department's current reputation is based on
the commitment Jeanne Newlin devoted to it over the past two and
one-half decades,'' states the article in May's Harvard University
Library Notes.
</P>
<P>
   Her downfall began in 1991, when she discovered that a male
subordinate was violating conflict-of-interest guidelines by
privately collecting documents that Harvard wanted to acquire. She
asked her supervisor to discipline him.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, according to court documents, the supervisor sided with
the employee, who was openly homosexual, and began undermining
Newlin. He downgraded her evaluations, refused to replace departing
members of her staff, and instigated a five-month investigation
into her treatment of employees.
</P>
<P>
   The supervisor's investigation culminated in a June 1994 report
characterizing Newlin as curt to employees and careless about
returning donors' phone calls. That November, a committee of
Harvard library administrators upheld the report, citing a
``serious and longstanding problems with Ms. Newlin's performance
and conduct.'' Five days later, Newlin filed a complaint with the
Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination, alleging gender
bias.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1995, Newlin was fired. The following month, the MCAD
dismissed her complaint. But she persisted, suing Harvard in

   This time she contended that her supervisor was bisexual or
homosexual and ``overtly favored gay male employees'' _ including
appointing a ``less qualified bisexual man'' over a ``more
qualified woman'' for a staff position. The supervisor, who has
left Harvard, declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor said Harvard does not acknowledge having discriminated
against Newlin, despite settling the lawsuit. ``If we had tried it,
we would have prevailed,'' Taylor says.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor declined to explain why Harvard settled. Insiders point
to Newlin's powerful backers, including Ginsburg and Koch.
Ginsburg, an alumna of Harvard Law School, became close to Newlin
through one of the justice's cousins, the late David Bader, who
co-owned the Wilbur Theater in Boston. His collection of theatrical
treasures was left to Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   Sources say Ginsburg, who declined comment, wrote to Harvard
applauding Newlin's honorary appointment.
</P>
<P>
   Koch, a former Harvard and Yale student who has an estimated
$600 million fortune from his family's oil services and refining
firm, is a major art donor and collector. Sources say that as a
protest against Newlin's firing, he threatened to shift a major
gift from Harvard's theater collection to archrival Yale.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether Koch has withdrawn his multimillion-dollar
commitment to Harvard, a spokesman declined comment. But, he added,
Koch is ``totally supportive'' of Newlin.

   240&AMP;ADD  FEMA LAUNCHES PREVENTION PROJECT TO CUT
DISASTER COSTS
 &HT;     By SAMAR ABULHASSAN 
 &HT;     c.1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Urging communities to ``learn from past
experiences,'' the federal government's disaster response chief
launched a nationwide project Wednesday that aims to cut the cost
of natural disasters before they strike.
</P>
<P>
   James Lee Witt, director of the Federal Emergency Management
Agency, said communities must take measures to protect their homes
and businesses before a flood, earthquake or hurricane occurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have seen too much devastation and destruction in the last
five years,'' Witt said at a National Press Club briefing. ``We
must end this damage-repair, damage-repair cycle.''
</P>
<P>
   FEMA's Project Impact seeks to reduce federal costs of cleaning
up after natural disasters by encouraging local partnerships
between businesses and government leaders and promoting public
awareness. This can mean buying flood insurance, installing storm
shutters or hosting prevention forums.
</P>
<P>
   Every dollar spent in damage prevention saves $2 in repairs,
Witt said. He pointed to the Anheuser Brewery in earthquake-prone
Northern California, which spent $15 million in the 1980s to
protect its facilities. After a 1994 quake whose epicenter was only
12 miles away, the company estimated it escaped damage that could
have topped $300 million.
</P>
<P>
   Last October, the agency launched a pilot program in seven
cities, including Deerfield Beach, Fla. Boasting the success of
these models, FEMA will stretch its resources to a first round of
localities in all 50 states. Each of the chosen communities will
receive from $500,000 to $1 million to implement their initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   In the past 10 years, FEMA has spent more than $20 billion to
help communities bounce back after a disaster. That doesn't include
lost jobs and insurance claims, Witt said.
</P>
<P>
   One avenue to reducing FEMA costs, Witt said, is for communities
to take the initiative, such as passing bond proposals. He cited
Austin, Texas, which recently approved a $25 million bond
proposition to build a flood tunnel for Waller Creek. Another $10
million proposition was allocated to protect 175 East Austin homes
from Walnut Creek flooding.
</P>
<P>
   ``They see the difference it makes,'' he said, emphasizing that
areas not chosen for FEMA aid ``can be a part of this.''
</P>
<P>
   For the pilot coastal community of Deerfield Beach, 1992's
Hurricane Andrew was a ``wake-up call,'' said Mayor Albert
Capellini.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a new sense of awareness,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   This spring, high school students, Americorps volunteers, and
local leaders began to install hurricane straps on the city's only
high school and hung storm shutters on the homes of elderly
residents. Four homes have been completed, with at least 50 more
expected to be shielded.
</P>
<P>
   Witt emphasized that people need to protect themselves first _
particularly by taking tornado and hurricane warnings more
seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing we can do is protect lives and
injuries,'' he said, noting that ``communities can always be
rebuilt.''

<P>
   The Wyndham Anatole Hotel, just outside Dallas, exudes
extravagance. It boasts 240,000 square feet of meeting space, 1,620
guest rooms, 13 restaurants, 10 original Picassos, and a basketball
court that NBA teams practice on. ``You could put the
Marriott-Copley in one of the lobbies,'' boasts vice president and
general manager Marc L. Messina.
</P>
<P>
   But one of the hotel's financial backers isn't a Stetson-wearing
oilman. It's the staid bastion of the eastern Establishment _
Harvard University.
</P>
<P>
   Like Harvard's academic influence, its financial tentacles
extend far beyond Cambridge. Although officials declined to
identify individual investments, and the university uses a web of
interlocking companies to ensure secrecy, sources and public
records show that its hidden realm ranges from oil wells to
cosmetics, auto dealerships to Internet search engines, luxury
apartments to subsidized housing.
</P>
<P>
   Since the '50s, when it became the first university to invest
its endowment in the stock market, Harvard has brought an
aggressive, unorthodox approach to financing its future. While most
universities, including Yale, farm out their investments, Harvard
manages most of its money through a downtown Boston subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   Although most colleges invest conservatively in domestic
securities, Harvard takes chances on emerging companies and
international stocks. And its prestige, massive resources, and
well-placed alumni bring Harvard opportunities that other colleges
can only dream of. The result: an impressive 18.9 percent annual
return over the past five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have less plain vanilla than the typical institution,''
says Jack Meyer, president of Harvard Management, which has 170
employees and is located in the Federal Reserve building.
</P>
<P>
   Some of its flavors may not satisfy everyone's taste. Like most
universities, Harvard invests to make money, not reform society.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, when Harvard divested its tobacco holdings,
then-president Derek Bok explained that it did not want to be
associated with companies whose products ``create a substantial and
unjustified risk of harm to other human beings.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite that standard, federal filings at the end of last year
show, the university owns nearly $24 million worth of Mirage
Resorts casinos, more than $6 million worth of Seagram liquor
company, and nearly $500,000 worth of Playboy Enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   ``Playboy is clearly inappropriate for a university,'' says Amy
Domini, who manages a fund that invests in ``socially responsible''
companies as measured by indices such as employee relations and
environmental impact. The fund regularly out-performs the Standard
and Poor's 500 Index.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard treasurer D. Ronald Daniel said that divesting tobacco
stocks, particularly Phillip Morris, hurt the university
financially. Whether to divest from alcohol or gambling companies,
he said, ``gets very complicated. You can write a series of
scenarios that could constrain our investment universe into a very
small one. Automobiles kill people too. Does that mean we shouldn't
invest in automobiles?''
</P>
<P>
   Even when Harvard's own advisory committee recommends a
favorable vote, the university often opposes or abstains from
stockholder resolutions urging firms to stop polluting the
environment or doing business with repressive regimes.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the advisory committee, composed of alumni,
faculty, and students, last year unanimously supported a resolution
by shareholders of Unocal. Harvard has nearly $5 million at stake
in Unocal, an oil and gas exploration company and the leading US
investor in Burma, one of the world's most repressive regimes.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution pushed Unocal to investigate allegations that its
Burmese partner was a conduit for laundered drug money. But the
Harvard Corporation, the governing board overseeing university
finances, abstained from the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel, a member of the corporation committee on shareholder
responsibility, acknowledged that it tends to be ``a little more
cautious'' than the advisory committee. But over several years, he
said, the corporation often comes around to the advisory
committee's viewpoint.
</P>
<P>
   While Harvard has only small stakes in Seagram, Unocal, and
other giant corporations, it has a bigger share _ and often a seat
on the board _ of an array of smaller companies. For example, it
owns 15 percent of United Auto Group, which buys and operates car
dealerships, and 5 percent of Immunogen in Norwood, which develops
cancer therapies.
</P>
<P>
   The university was majority owner of National Housing
Partnership, a major landlord of subsidized apartments, before
selling the company last year to Apartment Investment and
Management Co. Harvard retained a 3.5 percent share of AIM. At the
other end of the housing spectrum, it's an investor in a string of
luxury apartments under construction nationwide _ including a
Waltham complex cited last year for safety and labor violations.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard owns nearly 5 percent of Playtex Products, the women's
cosmetics company, whose biggest investor is Boston financier
Thomas H. Lee. That's only one aspect of the close relationship
between Harvard and Lee. Harvard is a limited partner in his
private equity funds. Lee, a 1965 alumnus, gave $22 million to the
university in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Not all of Harvard's gambles pay off. In the early '90s, Harvard
Management wrote off $250 million in poor investments, particularly
in wildcat oil and gas exploration in the Southwest. The
Massachusetts state pension fund, which had followed Harvard's
lead, lost tens of millions of dollars in the venture as well. More
recently, Harvard's 6.6 percent share of Cambridge Neuroscience, a
biotech firm, plunged in value due to the disappointing performance
of an experimental drug.
</P>
<P>
   But winners outweigh losers. Harvard was an early investor in
Kleiner Perkins, a West Coast venture capital firm that has backed
many high-tech start-ups, including Netscape.
</P>
<P>
   The Wyndham Anatole is not Harvard's only hotel. Although the
university sold the Copley Plaza in 1996 for a reported $70
million, it still has an interest in six hotels, several shopping
centers, and 35 office buildings, including Crystal City near
Reagan Washington National Airport. ``We have been trying
vigorously to increase our real estate ratio in the portfolio,''
Meyer says.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard doesn't always have to pay for real estate. Alumni
donate everything from subdivisions to summer homes. In 1992, one
alumnus donated a Colorado ski area for his 50th class reunion.
Harvard unloaded the property for $23 million, much to the athletic
department's consternation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a call from the ski coach saying, `You'd never sell it,
right?''' says Thomas Reardon, vice president for alumni affairs
and development. ``I said, `We're in the education business, not
the ski business.'''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On a Tuesday morning in Queens, two students in baggy
pants prepared to get digitized. As strobe lights flashed in a
small room, they stuck out their tongues and twisted their bodies
in comic break-dance moves as their life-size images were projected
onto the wall in front of them.
</P>
<P>
   Rows of consecutive portraits streamed from a laser printer like
a miniature, moving Warhol poster. With a pair of scissors, the two
teen-agers could cut and paste later the old-fashioned way,
assembling the shots in order into a souvenir flipbook.
</P>
<P>
   This was yet another highlight of a field trip to Oz _ or, as it
is better known, the American Museum of the Moving Image. Behind
the curtain was not an avuncular wizard but a modest 32-year-old
named Carl Goodman, AMMI's curator of digital media and the person
responsible for developing the museum's burgeoning collection of
electronic exhibitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever you do,'' Goodman said as he stepped past the lights,
``don't call me a cybercurator.'' He prefers to call himself the
museum's ``ambassador'' to new media. Since the AMMI matured
alongside Silicon Alley, Goodman has become a popular fixture in
the new media community of downtown New York. Last year, The
Silicon Alley Reporter, a newsletter, called him the ``most
insightful chronicler of media in Silicon Alley.''
</P>
<P>
   For many museumgoers, AMMI is most strongly associated with
motion pictures. Built in Astoria, where Paramount had studios in
the 1920s, AMMI opened on 36th Street at 35th Avenue in 1988 to
offer a behind-the-scenes look at how movies and television shows
were made. ``Behind the Screen,'' the core exhibition, is a
historical journey from a 19th-century zoetrope, which created
moving images by having a viewer gaze at a series of illustrations
through a slotted, spinning spool, to a digital animation station
from the late 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond a demonstration of the gadgetry, the goal of the
exhibitions is to illuminate the human experience of storytelling.
``It's all about the people and the process,'' Goodman explained,
continuing past rows of ancient movie cameras, ``computers are just
another tool.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike curators who spend their time acquiring old pieces,
Goodman collaborates in new interactive projects, conceiving
installations, then hiring freelance designers and programmers who
create magic. Goodman prefers keeping the technology in the
shadows. He said his mission was to present digital arts as part of
the broader evolution of storytelling media, like television and
film. ``The biggest compliment I get is when visitors forget
they're using a computer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One exhibit that uses special software lets visitors dub their
own voices into classic film scenes like Robert DeNiro's ``You
talking to me?'' soliloquy from ``Taxi Driver.'' For an exhibit on
computer editing, Goodman worked with a group of programmers and
designers to develop an interactive station where visitors can
piece together a variety of images.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want someone to sit here doing weatherman-style
tricks against a blue screen,'' Goodman said, as he sat at the
editing station and clicked together a surreal montage of tropical
fish swimming inside a burning television set.
</P>
<P>
   An early 1980s synthesizer was the tool that booted Goodman into
the world of digital media. The keyboard was a gift he received for
his 13th birthday from his parents, both musicians. Later, at
Wesleyan University in Middletown, Conn., Goodman studied
philosophy and music; inspired by the work of the composer John
Cage, he created his own electronic compositions. When he arrived
in New York, he began writing jingles, then wound up as an
executive recruiter on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   One day, he got a call that his friend's mother needed help
setting up the digital audio at a museum she had opened in Astoria.
Goodman has been at the museum, AMMI, ever since, orchestrating the
museum's digital offerings.
</P>
<P>
   His curatorial impulses inspired ``Computer Space 98,'' an
exhibition of video arcade games. Since 1989, Goodman has procured
classic video-game machines like Pong and Space Invaders. In a
downstairs gallery of the museum, game machines line the walls for
visitors to play. Nearby, for context, a bank of computers features
contemporary computer games, like the popular multiplayer shoot 'em
up game Quake.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Goodman said, his head is firmly planted six months
into the future. That is when, with a $1.3 million grant from the
National Science Foundation, AMMI will take an improved version of
``Behind the Scenes'' around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Goodman faces the daunting task of developing a portable
high-tech exhibit that will survive the perils of travel.
Eventually, he would like AMMI's Web site to play a more active
role in the museum's collection (www.ammi.org). He is currently
exploring the possibility for a ``History of the Web'' exhibit on
the site, featuring work from the early era of the medium's
development. ``AMMI to me is both a media museum and a way to
explore the notion of museum as medium,'' he explained via e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Goodman makes an effort to maintain close ties with the local
high-tech community. Six times a year, he organizes museum events
that feature digital artists and innovators discussing their craft.
Recent programs have explored the makings of movies that emphasize
special effects, like ``Titanic'' and ``Alien Resurrection.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodman uses the word ``cheerleader'' to describe his role in
the community. Goodman makes an effort to support and critique the
innovations made by the countless start-ups struggling to survive.
``I respect and admire these bungee jumpers of digital media,'' he
said. ``I'm excited about how they're always trying new concepts,
even if they fail. They're really the kamikaze pilots of the
industry. I encourage them to keep getting in those planes.''

<P>
   Dr. Paul Prusky attended Harvard Medical School on scholarship.
Now he's offering his alma mater at least $15 million for financial
aid awards _ an amount that would make any other university swoon.
Says Prusky: ``I'm trying to do for others what Harvard did for
me.''
</P>
<P>
   But Harvard is balking at conditions attached to the gift, torn
between its traditional zeal to raise money and its reluctance to
spend it. And Prusky, who left medicine for money management, is so
fed up that he may give the millions to his foundation instead.
</P>
<P>
   With an endowment of nearly $13 billion _ which would rank it in
the top quarter of Fortune 500 companies _ Harvard is far and away
the richest university in America. This Thursday in Harvard Yard,
in a commencement day ritual as cherished as the student-delivered
Latin oration, grateful reunion classes will offer up eight-figure
checks to the university, adding to its lucre.
</P>
<P>
   Such tribute is warranted, administrators say, because Harvard
is not as financially secure as it seems.
</P>
<P>
   But critics say Harvard is obsessed with fund-raising and
regards its wealth not just as a means to providing the best
education for its students but as an end in itself. By stockpiling
for the future, they say, Harvard may be shortchanging the present.
It spends less than 4 percent of its skyrocketing endowment _ and
the percentage is steadily dropping. Its frugality translates into
large classes, lagging salaries for junior faculty, and inadequate
financial aid, particularly for graduate students.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have always felt strongly that our spending is quite
conservative,'' says Henry Rosovsky, the former dean of arts and
sciences. ``We should look at expenditures more as investments than
as costs. The better Harvard University is, the easier it is to
attract whatever funds it needs.''
</P>
<P>
   By nearly every measure, Harvard stands at a pinnacle of power
and prestige. It boasts an unmatched 90 libraries, 35 Nobel
Prize-winners, 12 museums, 41 varsity teams, and dozens of think
tanks that help shape national policy and rebuild faltering
economies from Latin America to the Pacific Rim.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the pressure of maintaining excellence carries a cost.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard's growing internationalization and eagerness to function
as a shadow State Department abroad can make it look too cozy with
repressive regimes; its aggressive and secret land acquisition in
Allston and its planned Cambridge expansion have alienated
neighbors at home. The university's strict tenure process routinely
discards promising faculty. And its students are so driven to
achieve that many suffer from undue stress in what should be one of
the most enjoyable times of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Parents, meanwhile, must grapple with higher-than-inflation
hikes in tuition and room and board _ up 3.5 percent to $31,132
next year. Despite vowing to remain competitive, Harvard has not
matched Princeton's recent well-publicized initiative to ease the
burden on the middle class by boosting financial aid.
</P>
<P>
   Internal fund-raising rivalries have hampered President Neil
Rudenstine's push to transform a group of entrenched fiefdoms into
one university. Harvard's 12 schools _ arts and sciences, medicine,
law, etc. _ compete fiercely for donors such as
dropout-turned-tycoon Bill Gates, who left Harvard under pressure
in 1975 but gave it $15 million two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Nearing the $2.1 billion goal it set for the biggest
fund-raising campaign in the history of higher education, and aided
by the stock market's spectacular climb, Harvard has increased its
endowment fivefold in 15 years and doubled it in five years. As of
last June 30, Harvard led the University of Texas, its nearest
competitor, by $4.6 billion, and Yale by $5.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the endowment represents only a portion of Harvard's
wealth. Not included is $1.1 billion in cash and working capital,
as well as facilities and land. The facilities, ranging from
buildings on campus to a villa in Italy for Renaissance scholars,
are worth $4.1 billion, according to a 1997 Harvard financial
report. And Harvard does not estimate the value of 420 acres it
owns in Boston and Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   The endowment also does not account for the numerous treasures
in the university's museums and libraries _ from glass flowers to a
Gutenberg Bible, from Lewis and Clark's birds to Emily Dickinson's
manuscripts. Harvard is prohibited from selling some of these
artifacts. In any case, according to Jack Meyer, president of
Harvard Management, the Boston-based subsidiary that invests the
endowment, Harvard does not place a value on them because ``the
number would be too high.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Sophisticated operation targets potential donors &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Harvard bans reporters from its development office on the third
and fourth floors of University Place in Cambridge. But sources say
that the cubicles there contain a different sort of treasure: A
two-inch-high printout, updated weekly, listing prospective donors
with a coded rating based on giving capacity.
</P>
<P>
   These ratings are far more than guesswork. Harvard has long
boasted the most sophisticated fundraising operation in higher
education. In 1919, embarking on a $15.25 million campaign, it
became the first university to hire professional fund-raisers.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I cease to be president of Harvard College, I shall join
one of the mendicant orders, so as to have less begging to do,''
then president A. Lawrence Lowell once lamented.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Harvard spent $35 million on fund-raising _ and
raised $427 million. The development office has 250 employees,
aided by 4,000 alumni volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   Identifying prospects is the first step. Some alumni draw
Harvard's attention by reporting high incomes on the five-year
reunion surveys, or boasting of lavish lifestyles in their class
reports. Other alumni are ``rated'' by classmates.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I see a proxy statement or a prospectus involving a Harvard
graduate, I send it to the development office,'' says Ernest
Monrad, an alumnus and Boston money manager who has endowed two
Harvard chairs. ``If a fellow just got a $5 million bonus and he
says he can't afford a $10,000 gift, you can say, `Come on!'''
</P>
<P>
   Harvard's researchers double-check the ratings, using public and
commercial databases on everything from real estate holdings to
yacht ownership. The office's fourth-floor library holds 10,000
volumes, including Harvard class reports dating back to 1880.
Social registers dating to 1960 are stored at another location.
</P>
<P>
   Most donors are alumni, but fund-raising researchers also look
for prospects with any Harvard connection. Katherine Loker, who
endowed the new freshman dining commons and recently gave $17
million to renovate the libraries, is the widow of an alumnus.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard produces three times as many chief executives of leading
businesses as any other university. Through these contacts, Harvard
solicits corporations. In return for their gifts, the companies
often expect an edge in recruiting students and gaining access to
research.
</P>
<P>
   According to a 1995 Harvard report, its largest corporate donors
_ and major prospects for the current campaign _ include Dupont
($15 million from 1978-94), IBM ($8.5 million), Exxon Corp. ($7.5
million) and Merck &AMP; Co. ($4.14 million).
</P>
<P>
   Given abundant data, Harvard fund-raisers _ both alumni
volunteers and professionals who handle all gifts above $250,000 _
know how hard to squeeze the ``pale, frail, white males,'' as one
insider describes typical donors.
</P>
<P>
   ``A guy sits there and has palpitations,'' says Thomas Reardon,
vice president for alumni affairs and development. ``He's saying,
`Give me a break, I've got to pay 12 tuitions.'''
</P>
<P>
   The university expects to raise about two-thirds of the current
campaign's $2.1 billion target in chunks of $1 million or more.
Gifts of at least $10 million are expected to account for the
remaining $760 million. Rudenstine personally negotiates with major
benefactors over dinner at the president's house on Elmwood Avenue
in Cambridge, or jets off to see them.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard steps up pressure on alumni during reunion years. One
alumnus, who requested anonymity, pledged a substantial gift in
advance of his 25th reunion. But during the festivities, he enjoyed
seeing old friends and haunts so much that he decided to double his
donation.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On a Tuesday morning in Queens, two students in baggy
pants prepared to get digitized. As strobe lights flashed in a
small room, they stuck out their tongues and twisted their bodies
in comic break-dance moves as their life-size images were projected
onto the wall in front of them.
</P>
<P>
   Rows of consecutive portraits streamed from a laser printer like
a miniature, moving Warhol poster. With a pair of scissors, the two
teen-agers could cut and paste later the old-fashioned way,
assembling the shots in order into a souvenir flipbook.
</P>
<P>
   This was yet another highlight of a field trip to Oz _ or, as it
is better known, the American Museum of the Moving Image. Behind
the curtain was not an avuncular wizard but a modest 32-year-old
named Carl Goodman, AMMI's curator of digital media and the person
responsible for developing the museum's burgeoning collection of
electronic exhibitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever you do,'' Goodman said as he stepped past the lights,
``don't call me a cybercurator.'' He prefers to call himself the
museum's ``ambassador'' to new media. Since the AMMI matured
alongside Silicon Alley, Goodman has become a popular fixture in
the new media community of downtown New York. Last year, The
Silicon Alley Reporter, a newsletter, called him the ``most
insightful chronicler of media in Silicon Alley.''
</P>
<P>
   For many museumgoers, AMMI is most strongly associated with
motion pictures. Built in Astoria, where Paramount had studios in
the 1920s, AMMI opened on 36th Street at 35th Avenue in 1988 to
offer a behind-the-scenes look at how movies and television shows
were made. ``Behind the Screen,'' the core exhibition, is a
historical journey from a 19th-century zoetrope, which created
moving images by having a viewer gaze at a series of illustrations
through a slotted, spinning spool, to a digital animation station
from the late 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond a demonstration of the gadgetry, the goal of the
exhibitions is to illuminate the human experience of storytelling.
``It's all about the people and the process,'' Goodman explained,
continuing past rows of ancient movie cameras, ``computers are just
another tool.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike curators who spend their time acquiring old pieces,
Goodman collaborates in new interactive projects, conceiving
installations, then hiring freelance designers and programmers who
create magic. Goodman prefers keeping the technology in the
shadows. He said his mission was to present digital arts as part of
the broader evolution of storytelling media, like television and
film. ``The biggest compliment I get is when visitors forget
they're using a computer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One exhibit that uses special software lets visitors dub their
own voices into classic film scenes like Robert DeNiro's ``You
talking to me?'' soliloquy from ``Taxi Driver.'' For an exhibit on
computer editing, Goodman worked with a group of programmers and
designers to develop an interactive station where visitors can
piece together a variety of images.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want someone to sit here doing weatherman-style
tricks against a blue screen,'' Goodman said, as he sat at the
editing station and clicked together a surreal montage of tropical
fish swimming inside a burning television set.
</P>
<P>
   An early 1980s synthesizer was the tool that booted Goodman into
the world of digital media. The keyboard was a gift he received for
his 13th birthday from his parents, both musicians. Later, at
Wesleyan University in Middletown, Conn., Goodman studied
philosophy and music; inspired by the work of the composer John
Cage, he created his own electronic compositions. When he arrived
in New York, he began writing jingles, then wound up as an
executive recruiter on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   One day, he got a call that his friend's mother needed help
setting up the digital audio at a museum she had opened in Astoria.
Goodman has been at the museum, AMMI, ever since, orchestrating the
museum's digital offerings.
</P>
<P>
   His curatorial impulses inspired ``Computer Space 98,'' an
exhibition of video arcade games. Since 1989, Goodman has procured
classic video-game machines like Pong and Space Invaders. In a
downstairs gallery of the museum, game machines line the walls for
visitors to play. Nearby, for context, a bank of computers features
contemporary computer games, like the popular multiplayer shoot 'em
up game Quake.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Goodman said, his head is firmly planted six months
into the future. That is when, with a $1.3 million grant from the
National Science Foundation, AMMI will take an improved version of
``Behind the Scenes'' around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Goodman faces the daunting task of developing a portable
high-tech exhibit that will survive the perils of travel.
Eventually, he would like AMMI's Web site to play a more active
role in the museum's collection (www.ammi.org). He is currently
exploring the possibility for a ``History of the Web'' exhibit on
the site, featuring work from the early era of the medium's
development. ``AMMI to me is both a media museum and a way to
explore the notion of museum as medium,'' he explained via e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Goodman makes an effort to maintain close ties with the local
high-tech community. Six times a year, he organizes museum events
that feature digital artists and innovators discussing their craft.
Recent programs have explored the makings of movies that emphasize
special effects, like ``Titanic'' and ``Alien Resurrection.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodman uses the word ``cheerleader'' to describe his role in
the community. Goodman makes an effort to support and critique the
innovations made by the countless start-ups struggling to survive.
``I respect and admire these bungee jumpers of digital media,'' he
said. ``I'm excited about how they're always trying new concepts,
even if they fail. They're really the kamikaze pilots of the
industry. I encourage them to keep getting in those planes.''

6 DEGREES OF NETWORKING 
</HEADLINE>
  (gm) 
 By SHELLY FREIERMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Six degrees of separation, the theory that everyone on the
planet is connected by a chain of only six people, carries the
grace of logic and the tantalizing lure of being impossible to
disprove. The idea of six degrees of separation was advanced by
Guglielmo Marconi, the inventor of the wireless telegraph, and
popularized in the 1990 play of the same name by John Guare.
</P>
<P>
   It has fueled countless conversations pondering connections to
the famous and infamous, the dead and living. It has also come to
the Web in the form of a networking site called Six Degrees
(www.sixdegrees.com).
</P>
<P>
   Six Degrees, which has 675,000 members and adds 3,000 more every
24 hours, uses the standard tools of the Net _ e-mail, bulletin
boards and search engines _ to offer links to friends and friends
of friends. What makes Six Degrees different from other public
online services is that a member has a connection to all the other
people on the site through a series of mutual acquaintances.
</P>
<P>
   A participant can either sign up at Six Degrees' Web site or
join by responding to a member's e-mail invitation. Participants
choose an initial circle of friends (the first degree), and they in
turn recruit their friends (the second degree), who can repeat the
process. Members control who can see their personal information,
and there is a limit to how far into the network a question can be
distributed. Users can communicate via e-mail only within their
first or second degree.
</P>
<P>
   As with similar networking tools at other membership-based sites
like Geocities (geocities.com), Six Degrees offers an opportunity
to ask people with shared interests for information. So, reaching
into a network for a car repair shop, chiropractor or a good place
to go birding in eastern Pennsylvania can yield useful
recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   One of the enjoyable features at Six Degrees is being able to
look up the path of acquaintances between yourself and another
member. The resulting ``I know her through Barker at the printing
shop and his cousin Trisha'' list is reminiscent of those
conservations about how you are connected to Warren Beatty.
</P>
<P>
   David Barton, a systems engineer in Stockholm, Sweden, the
country with the highest per-capita membership in Six Degrees,
recruited several members after he joined. ``I use the site to keep
track of my friends and business contacts,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The owner of the site, Macroview Communications of New York,
promises not to sell members' names to marketing businesses, though
it does sells banner ads for the site and demographic statistics
based on the site's membership. The company has also formed
partnerships with sites like Job Direct (www.jobdirect.com) and
College Beat (www.collegebeat.com). If a member registers with Six
Degrees through one of these sites, his or her personal information
belongs to both partners.
</P>
<P>
   According to the company, half the site members joined Six
Degrees because friends had registered them, but they never do any
networking. One such member is Derek Whiteside, a software engineer
from Corvalis, Ore., who uses other online sources for getting
advice and parts from owners of American Motors cars, which he
collects. Only two of his friends joined Six Degrees when he listed
them in his initial circle, and he said he is not comfortable
pushing membership. ``The site has the feel of a multilevel
marketing thing,'' Whiteside said. ``Before you can reap the
benefits, you have to get others to join.''

 UNDATED: ... demand there is.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With its elegant chandeliers and handpainted Chinese wallpaper,
the dean's mansion on the campus of Harvard Business School is an
unlikely setting for a revolution. But there, at a Saturday brunch
for 15 guests in 1990, then-dean John McArthur launched a startling
challenge to the tub system.
</P>
<P>
   McArthur had invited the deans of Harvard's small schools _
education, divinity, public health, design _ and wealthy business
school alumni who took an interest in those subjects. Playing
matchmaker, he encouraged the alumni to put aside their loyalty to
the business school in the upcoming campaign, and devote their
money and energy to its poor relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to collectively accept responsibility to see that
sufficient resources are brought to bear for all schools,'' says
McArthur, now a professor at the business school.
</P>
<P>
   Although the prosperous business school could afford the
gesture, such altruism violated Harvard practice. By tradition,
each school holds a death-grip on its own alumni and researches its
own prospects, although the small tubs sometimes consult the
central office's ratings.
</P>
<P>
   McArthur's band heeded his call.
</P>
<P>
   John Hobbs, MBA '65, became cochair of the education school's
campaign with his wife, Elisabeth, a 1961 education school
graduate. Together they have given more than $4 million. And
Vincent L. Gregory Jr., MBA '49, retired chairman of a chemical
company that had been linked in lawsuits to deaths of 50 employees
from cancer, raised $10 million for a cancer-prevention center at
the school of public health. Overall, business school alumni have
contributed $45 million to other tubs.
</P>
<P>
   After taking over, Rudenstine promoted more cooperation,
including five inter-faculty initiatives on such topics as the
environment, the mind, the brain, and behavior. Environment quickly
became one of Harvard's most popular majors.
</P>
<P>
   Liberated from tub constraints, major donors thought big. Rita
and Gustave Hauser, who had previously given a building to the law
school, their alma mater, now underwrote a university-wide center
for the study of nonprofit institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Many split their gifts. John L. Loeb, the late New York
investment banker, divided his $70.5 million donation in 1995
between Harvard College, the schools of design and public health,
the Loeb drama center, and Memorial Church in Harvard Yard.
``There's a tremendous amount of cross-fertilization,'' Rudenstine
says.
</P>
<P>
   But as the effort wore on, the altruism waned. Reverting to
form, the tubs put their own needs first, and the central office
capitulated. Harvard hosted a fund-raising weekend for the
environment program that reaped $2 million, but similar weekends
for the other four interfaculty initiatives were quashed. As a
result, Harvard has only garnered $34 million of its $75 million
goal for the university-wide programs.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the development office terminated an experimental
program that raised money for small schools from non-alumni.
Reardon says that the ``Partners Program'' was bringing in fewer
dollars than had been hoped, but the schools say it made a
difference. ``It was very important to us,'' says Ronald Theimann,
divinity school dean. ``We miss it.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the resistance came from Harvard's largest school, arts
and sciences, which was worried about meeting its $965 million goal
and saw its alumni giving $130 million to other schools. As of
April 1, it had raised $821 million, or 85 percent of its goal.
</P>
<P>
   Under campaign policy, only one school can contact each
prospect. Since each school has dibs on its own graduates, the
central administration is supposed to mediate tugs of war for
alumni with two Harvard degrees, and for non-alumni.
</P>
<P>
   But the small tubs complained that arts and sciences was given
preferential treatment. And these tensions came to a head over the
biggest prospect of all, Bill Gates. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gates provided window of opportunity &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gates could only spare 10 minutes. So his hosts hustled him
upstairs in Memorial Hall, where a scale model of the campus lay on
a table.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard College Dean Harry Lewis did the honors. With a
flourish, he removed the Aiken Computation Laboratory from the
model and substituted a proposed building to be funded by Gates and
a fellow Microsoft executive.
</P>
<P>
   The Harvard contingent around the table that May afternoon in
1996 relished the moment. Two presidents, several deans, and an
overseer had wooed _ and fought over _ the Microsoft mogul for a
decade. Now they were close to landing a major gift, and they had
no doubts they would get it from the dropout who had been virtually
chased out of Harvard two decades earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Gates has said that he withdrew from Harvard to pursue his
career. However, according to interviews, he left after a dispute
over alleged rules violations at the Aiken Lab, including using its
computers for private business.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a flap, no question about it,'' says his father,
William Gates Sr., who now runs his son's charitable foundation.
``My son felt a little put upon by the Harvard administration's
attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Gates lived in Currier House at Radcliffe, but the Aiken Lab was
his true Harvard home, where he often worked through the night. His
troubles began when a lab administrator discovered that Gates was
using the Aiken computer to write computer code for a New Mexico
company. Because the federal government was funding the computer
time, the administrator felt that Gates was misusing not just a
Harvard facility but also public funds.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Gates was sharing his computer access with a high
school friend: Paul Allen, the future cofounder of Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Gates's student file is protected by privacy rules, but
university officials, friends, and family say he was not expelled.
According to sources and a 1993 unauthorized biography by Stephen
Manes and Paul Andrews, Gates avoided expulsion by agreeing to put
the code in the public domain. He was, however, reprimanded.
</P>
<P>
   Gates' parents were devastated. His mother was ``very, very
apprehensive'' about his future, says his father.
</P>
<P>
   Those worries had eased by the late 1980a, when Gates had made
his fortune and Harvard began courting the computer wunderkind.
Gates's father recalls that then-president Derek Bok made the first
overture _ a dinner in Seattle with Gates and other
Harvard-affiliated Microsoft executives. The hopes of Harvard
fund-raisers rose in 1991 when Gates's dorm mate, Steven Ballmer, a
1977 alumnus and executive vice president at Microsoft, was elected
to the board of overseers.
</P>
<P>
   The pursuit quickened. After Gates's mother, Mary Maxwell Gates,
died in June 1994, Rudenstine sent him a sympathy note. According
to sources, Gates responded that his mother's greatest
disappointment was that he had not graduated from Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   Gates seemed ripe for a proposal. But from which tub? Since he
had attended Harvard College, arts and sciences staked its claim to
him. But as a dropout, Gates was technically up for grabs. In late
1994, sources say, the Kennedy School invited Gates to a
conference.
</P>
<P>
   Because most of its alumni enter public-service careers, the
Kennedy School must poach to survive. Of the $136 million it has
raised in the current campaign, its graduates contributed only 5
percent, while other Harvard alumni accounted for 36 percent. (The
rest came from non-Harvard donors.)
</P>
<P>
   Although Gates declined the invitation, it alarmed arts and
sciences fund-raisers. At their behest, the central office said
that henceforth, small schools would need its approval before
considering any prospects who were not their own alumni.
</P>
<P>
   With the Kennedy School rebuked, the courtship of Gates took a
high-tech turn in April 1996, over a videophone linking the
business school and Microsoft. Lewis, Reardon, and Rudenstine made
their pitch to Gates and his father. Lewis, a former computer
science professor who had spotted Gates's potential two decades
earlier, emphasized that Harvard could ill afford to fall behind in
a field so crucial to its future. Gates bargained, pointing out
that Stanford had named a building after him for $6 million,
considerably less than Harvard was asking.
</P>
<P>
   After Gates committed $15 million and Ballmer $10 million,
Harvard wasted no time. The Maxwell-Dworkin laboratory,
memorializing their mothers' maiden names, will open next summer.
</P>
<P>
   But while Harvard moved quickly to stay abreast in computer
technology, and satisfy Gates's need for veneration, it has dragged
its feet on Paul Prusky's less glamorous offer to relieve
six-figure debts for medical students.
</P>
<P>
   Tomorrow, Prusky is scheduled to meet with two members of the
Harvard corporation to discuss the condition attached to his $15
million-plus gift. He wants Harvard to spend two-thirds of earnings
generated by the money. If the gift grows 15 percent a year, the
medical school would give students 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But that would exceed Harvard's 4 percent rate of endowment
spending, and the university is loathe to make an exception. How
the Prusky negotiations play out will be closely watched as a case
study of Harvard's priorities and educational values.
</P>
<P>
   Says Treasurer D. Ronald Daniel: ``It's an unfinished story.
We're flexible, but not unreasonably so.''

EVER POLITE, ALWAYS CONVENIENT, SUPERBLY EFFICIENT: THE ATM

(th) 
 By HENRY FOUNTAIN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is a fantasy for modern times: You ask an automated teller
machine for $100 from your account and like a slot machine showing
three cherries, it just keeps spitting out money.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, such a scene is extremely unlikely, ATM manufacturers say.
The machines contain a series of safeguards to make sure that only
the exact amount of money requested is dispensed.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, said Thomas McBride, director of worldwide product
marketing for Diebold, a major ATM manufacturer based in Canton,
Ohio, the machines test and retest the bills during each
transaction in much the way that a human teller counts and recounts
money several times before handing it over.
</P>
<P>
   One common testing method uses infrared light. After a bill is
selected from a supply hopper, it passes over a beam of infrared
light. Varying amounts of light will pass through different parts
of a bill to be picked up by a sensor on the other side.
</P>
<P>
   Each denomination has a printing ``signature'' that the sensor
can be programmed to detect. The portrait of Andrew Jackson on a
$20 bill, for example, will be read differently than that of
Alexander Hamilton on a $10 bill. The sensor can also easily detect
bills that are stuck together.
</P>
<P>
   ATMs also have electromechanical devices that conduct similar
tests. These are usually a series of pivoting rollers that check
each bill's thickness and size and whether it is skewed and likely
to jam the machine. All the devices, whether optical or
electromechanical, are calibrated to accommodate anything from a
crisp, new bill to a worn one.
</P>
<P>
   A bill that fails any test is diverted to a reject hopper, and
another bill is drawn from the supply hopper to be run through the
testing sequence. Only when the correct number of bills of the
right denomination have passed the tests is the money actually
dispensed.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than issuing too much cash, what is more likely to happen
_ though it is still rare, ATM manufacturers say _ is that a
machine will dispense too little. You might ask for $100, for
example, but something will jam inside the machine and only $80
will be dispensed. In such a case, only $80 will be deducted from
your account because the electronic transaction with your bank
takes place only after the money is given out.
</P>
<P>
   A far different problem arises when an ATM hands over the right
amount of money to the wrong person. A personal identification
number is the chief means by which an ATM knows that a card user is
legitimate, and both card and PIN can be stolen.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers are working to increase security, testing
verification technologies like voice and face recognition as well
as iris and fingerprint scanning. While there are some pilot
projects under way, they are small, localized efforts.
</P>
<P>
   A small group of customers may have iris scans stored, for
example, in a single ATM. Privacy issues that would be raised by
any effort to create a large, centralized database of scans or
other information are likely to keep such projects limited, at
least for now.
</P>
<P>
   But a different kind of digital effort has some potential, said
Bill Witte, vice president for product management at Fujitsu-ICL
Systems, an ATM manufacturer in La Jolla, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   With all the advances in storing computer data, ATMs can now
keep electronic, rather than paper, records of all transactions. It
would be simple to add to each transaction record an image of the
customer taken by a digital camera on the front of the machine.
While such a system might not stop a thief in the act, it could
make it easier to track one down later.
</P>
<P>
   HOW IT WORKS
</P>
<P>
   Less than three decades after the ATM was introduced in the
United States (at a bank in Georgia), it has become as ubiquitous
as the gasoline pump. There are now more than 165,000 ATMs in the
United States, performing more than 11 billion transactions
annually, or about 1.2 million every hour.
</P>
<P>
   Three-quarters of Americans 18 to 34 years old carry ATM cards,
according to the American Bankers Association, compared with only
one-third of people 65 and older. Here is a look at how a typical
ATM works.
</P>
<P>
   __
</P>
<P>
   Say you want to withdraw $100.
</P>
<P>
   1. You slide the card into the reader.
</P>
<P>
   The ATM reads the information on the magnetic strip, including
the electronic address of your bank, your account number there and
your personal identification number. Some card stripes carry
personalized information so the ATM can greet you by name: Welcome,
Bob Smith.
</P>
<P>
   2. You enter your PIN.
</P>
<P>
   3. The ATM connects to the bank's computers.
</P>
<P>
   The ATM computer checks the PIN with the bank's computers. Then
it checks the balance on your account to see if there is enough
money for your withdrawal. If there is, the bank's computers
authorize the transaction.

   4. The ATM counts the money.
</P>
<P>
   Rotating rubber rollers feed one bill at a time to the conveyor.
(Some machines use a suction mechanism.) Along the conveyor, a
sensing device shines light, often infrared, through the bill to
detect whether a single bill of the proper denomination has been
picked up. Other electromechanical devices check each bill's size,
length and thickness. If a mistake is detected, the money is
diverted to a reject box.
</P>
<P>
   The sequence is repeated until the correct number of bills are
ready at the holding area to be dispensed to you, through another
set of rollers.
</P>
<P>
   5. The ATM closes the connection.
</P>
<P>
   Once the money has been dispensed, the ATM sends a completion
message to your bank, and the host computer updates your account
accordingly.

 UNDATED: ... double his donation.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just then, he was approached by a classmate who had volunteered
as a fund-raiser. ``I'm increasing my gift,'' the donor told him,
and named the amount.
</P>
<P>
   The fund-raiser then reached into his pocket for a slip of
paper. Written on it were the donor's name and the exact amount he
had just offered to give. ``I'm glad I didn't have to ask you for
it,'' the fund-raiser said. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Half of graduates just say no &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Why do people keep giving so much money to a university that is
already the country's richest?
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone does. Some alumni prefer to support needier
charities. Only half of Harvard College graduates donate each year,
a participation rate lower than Princeton's and Dartmouth's.
</P>
<P>
   Major donors express a variety of motives. Some want to thank
the university where they chose careers, met spouses, or received
financial aid. Still others believe that, as Harvard goes, so goes
America.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an enormous ripple effect,'' Monrad says. ``You're
dealing with the young, you're dealing with the future. You can
give to a homeless shelter, but those people are not the future.''
</P>
<P>
   To get, Harvard often has to give. In return for a $20 million
pledge from Chelsea-born entrepreneur Warren Alpert in 1993,
Harvard Medical School not only named a building after Alpert and
hung his portrait in the lobby, it agreed to shine a light on the
painting 24 hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   Other donors' names are attached to professorships,
scholarships, even the athletics staff; head football coach Tim
Murphy is the Thomas Stephenson Family Coach for Harvard Football.
And if children of donors are denied admission, university
officials will help in finding another college.
</P>
<P>
   Major donors are often nominated by the Harvard Alumni
Association for election to the 30-member board of overseers. Or
they sit on visiting committees that monitor Harvard's departments
and report to the overseers. (The overseers are less powerful than
the other governing board, the seven-member corporation.)
</P>
<P>
   Some donors tailor their gifts to Harvard's needs, but others
take a hard line. One insisted on endowing an arts and sciences
professorship in law and psychiatry, even though those subjects are
usually taught by the law and medical schools. The chair stay
vacant for five years until it was taken by an English professor,
who fulfills the terms of the gift by applying legal and
psychiatric analysis to literature.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard seeks as much latitude over gifts as possible without
alienating donors. In one major bequest from the estate of a
childless California couple, Harvard interpreted the terms of their
will very broadly. In return, it yielded to their trustee an
unusual say over spending.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Lefler, a direct-mail pioneer who died in 1994 from
Alzheimer's disease, and his wife, who died before him, left $7
million for a ``home or other facility'' for ``treatment and care''
of Alzheimer's and similar diseases. Their will suggested four
Alzheimer's organizations as potential recipients.
</P>
<P>
   But Harvard courted the Leflers' accountant and trustee, Daniel
Bernstein. It offered to spend the money on an ``intellectual
center'' that would sponsor research not just on Alzheimer's, but
on all aspects of brain cell degeneration.
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein signed on, after extracting one key concession.
Despite a university policy that donors ``ordinarily'' cannot ``in
any way'' direct the use of their funds, he now sits on a
three-member committee overseeing the expenditures. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Many wonder: How much is enough? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If Harvard is zealous about raising money, it is equally
cautious about spending it.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the university has nearly completed its fund-raising
drive, and its investments have earned an annual rate of 18.9
percent over the past five years, relatively little of that
windfall is being applied to urgent academic problems.
</P>
<P>
   Many Harvard officials _ especially Rudenstine _ worry about
having enough money in the future to continue to attract top-flight
faculty, build modern labs and dorms, and make sure that every
applicant it accepts can afford to attend.
</P>
<P>
   ``You dare not spend too much because you have to get through
the rough years,'' Rudenstine said in his modest, colonial-style
office. ``You need that cushion.''
</P>
<P>
   Every fall, the Harvard Corporation establishes the endowment's
budget contribution for the next academic year. Although those
contributions have increased an average of 9 percent per year over
the past decade, they have not kept pace with the endowment's
skyrocketing growth.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Harvard will spend 3.72 percent of its endowment _
down from nearly 5 percent in 1993, and less than the national
average of 4.2 percent among private colleges. At the other
extreme, Stanford spends up to 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In a boom era, Harvard has continued to economize. For example,
12 positions funded by the current campaign this year were the
first new slots authorized for thearts and sciences faculty in the
last six years. Jeremy Knowles, dean of arts and sciences,
acknowledges that Harvard has a higher student-to-faculty ratio
than other elite private universities.
</P>
<P>
   This frugality makes many people around Harvard wonder: How
large an endowment is enough?
</P>
<P>
   Some educators urge Harvard to send a signal by holding the line
on tuition. Rudenstine counters that next year's 3.5 percent
increase is necessary because only the richest one-fourth of
Harvard students pays full freight, and their tuition subsidizes
financial aid for the rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The higher the total endowment gets, the better the central
fund-raisers look,'' says Hale Champion, Harvard's former financial
vice president. ``Harvard has allowed those financial aspirations
to hold that payout down. If I were a dean at Harvard now, I'd
stand on the rooftop and shout about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Rudenstine acknowledged that financial aid for graduate students
is in ``terrible shape,'' and faculty salaries should be increased.
On the other hand, he said, Harvard needs reserves as a hedge
against inflation or a stock market crash. As recently as 1991,
when Rudenstine took over, the endowment earned only 1.1 percent on
its investments and Harvard ran a $42 million deficit in its
operating budget. Even today, Harvard ranks only fifth nationwide
in the ratio of endowment dollars to students.
</P>
<P>
   Rudenstine also argued that Harvard cannot easily remedy its
weaknesses because restricted gifts dominate its endowment. The
university's flexibility is also hampered by its administrative
structure, known to Harvard managers since 1817 as ``every tub on
its own bottom.''
</P>
<P>
   Every Harvard school sets its own tuition, balances its own
budget, and has a separate endowment. If a school borrows from the
central administration, which acts as sort of a university bank, it
has to pay interest. Little has changed since 1970, when a
university report described Harvard as ``financially...a
confederation of semi-independent baronies.'' Tubs even compete for
faculty.
</P>
<P>
   Both the John F. Kennedy School of Government and the Faculty of
Arts and Sciences _ comprising Harvard College and graduate
programs in those fields _ recently tried to hire the same
Princeton economist.
</P>
<P>
   To paraphrase George Orwell, all tubs are equal, but some are
more equal than others. The business school boasts a $728 million
endowment, but earns so much from publications and executive
programs that it barely dips into its nest egg. But the Divinity
School, with Harvard's lowest tuition and few wealthy alumni,
depends on the annual payout from its $250 million endowment for 40
percent of its operating budget.
</P>
<P>
   The tub system has served Harvard well. It encourages grassroots
initiative, efficiency, and accountability. But it also strengthens
individual deans at the expense of the president, hindering
Rudenstine's ability to reallocat resources. Like a weak baseball
commissioner, he is forced to beg powerful barons to share their
wealth for the good of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Although the central administration has nearly $1 billion in
university-wide funds, most of the money consists of restricted
gifts. According to Elizabeth C. Huidekoper, vice president for
finance, Rudenstine only controls $4 million in discretionary
funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The deans of the smaller tubs are lining up at his door,''
Huidekoper says. ``You can imagine how much demand there is.'' &QL;

 c.1997 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   J. Terence Patterson, who will be a junior at Harvard next fall,
could have gone to many other top-ranked universities _ for free.
</P>
<P>
   He graduated in the top 5 percent of his high school class and
was such a good football player that the University of Virginia,
among others, offered him a full athletic scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the 20-year-old Memphis native chose Harvard, paying
full tuition and joining the most elite student body in the
country. But Harvard does not come cheap. Tuition, room and board,
and other standard fees is $31,132 and rising faster than the
inflation rate. Patterson and his parents have taken out
substantial student loans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming here was something that I knew would always help me in
my career,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   For his money, academic experts say, Patterson is getting a leg
up on his career by allying himself with the Harvard name and
hooking into a global network of alumni in business, government,
and academia who might open the door to a better job and higher
salary than if he had gone to another college.
</P>
<P>
   What he's not necessarily getting is the best undergraduate
education in the country.
</P>
<P>
   After competing fiercely for high grades, top SAT scores, and
outside achievements that win them admission, Harvard's
undergraduates often are so competitive and success-oriented that
they forfeit the slow-paced intellectual maturation that should be
occurring during their college years, say academic specialists.
Students, faculty, and administrators acknowledge that competitive
pressures for undergraduate and graduate students at Harvard are
exceptionally high.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're coming to us already electrically overcharged,'' says
Harvard's president, Neil Rudenstine. ``Our kids are the highest of
all higher tiers, so a lot of the pressure they put on themselves
is internal. You know, they set standards for themselves that make
it hard for them to meet.''
</P>
<P>
   Adam Hickey, a 21-year-old government major from Fort
Lauderdale, Fla., puts it more bluntly: ``Harvard can be a pool of
competitive piranhas, but that's how the real world is.''
</P>
<P>
   Is college supposed to be like the real world? Many academics
don't think so. Education is increasingly about collaborative
learning, close teacher-pupil contact, and hands-on experience,
whether in a lab or beyond the campus. Harvard is an excellent
research university, a first-class name, a well-endowed treasure in
American higher education, but it is not, experts say, the place to
go for an undergraduate education that emphasizes intimate
scholarly contact, risk-taking, and intuitive thinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``There must be 25-30 other schools that provide the same
quality of education as Harvard. It is true that Harvard is an
excellent university, but Harvard's brand name is what students are
going for,'' says Arthur Levine, president of Teachers College,
Columbia University, and author of ``When Hope and Fear Collide: A
Portrait of Today's College Student.''
</P>
<P>
   Sol Gittleman, provost of Tufts University, questions the
fixation that students and parents have with famed universities
such as Harvard and Stanford, institutions with powerful graduate
programs and superstar faculty doing cutting-edge research but not
necessarily focusing on teaching. A report this spring by the
Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching charged that
research universities like Harvard give undergraduates ``little or
no attention.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our research universities are the envy of the world,'' says
Gittleman. ``But it is throwing sand in your eyes if you think the
educational experience of undergraduates at a Harvard is better
than a Middlebury or a Georgetown.''
</P>
<P>
   There are other trade-offs to a coveted Harvard degree. Be
prepared, for instance, to have virtually no choice in housing
(though the housing is extremely comfortable by college standards),
to be placed in relatively large classes taught by teaching
assistants instead of tenured faculty and, especially, to be
competitive with fellow students from day one.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you come here as a first-year student, everyone is trying
to outdo each other,'' says Daniel Suleiman, a 21-year-old social
studies major. ``People take themselves so seriously because they
are at Harvard. They think that what they are doing here bears a
large consequence for the rest of their lives, so there is a
feeling of self-importance. And the last thing Harvard does is try
to squash that feeling.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Beating the bushes for hot prospects &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But still they come. More than 200 of the top high school
juniors in the Baltimore-Maryland region were out in force on a
soggy night last month in the grand ballroom of the Hyatt Hotel in
Bethesda, Md. The computers of the New York-based College Board had
coaxed their names off of PSAT tests, the warmup for the crucial
SAT exam, and forwarded them to the admissions departments of
Harvard and other universities. Personal invitations were sent,
encouraging phone calls made.
</P>
<P>
   These students, after all, are the hottest prospects for the
class of 2003, the top percentile on the PSAT. In many cases they
have already been looked over by one or more of the 6,000 Harvard
alummni who are part of a worldwide network prospecting for the
world's best students.
</P>
<P>
   There were 16,819 applicants for 1,650 freshmen slots this fall.
By May 1, 80 percent of the students that Harvard had accepted for
the fall term said they would attend. That is the highest ``yield
rate'' among American colleges, even though Harvard is among the
most expensive universities in the nation and has come under new
competitive pressure from Ivy League schools with more attractive
financial-aid packages.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Annis, a trial lawyer in Potomac, Md., who volunteers his
time as cochair of the Harvard alumni committee for Maryland,
typically spends 50 hours between January and March and up to 80
hours between November and December examining the dossiers of
Harvard prospects. ``The kick is talking with bright, enthusiastic,
energetic kids,'' he says, although he acknowledges that because
only a handful of the brightest students interviewed will be
accepted, ``it can be a shock for kids who have never heard `no' to
be told `no' by Harvard.''
</P>
<P>
   This spring, more than 15,000 of the best students in the nation
were told ``no'' by Harvard, including 2,146 valedictorians. Among
them could be a future president or Nobel Prize winner. ``No one
wants to be turning down 15,000 people,'' says Harvard's dean of
admissions, William Fitzsimmons. ``But if you want to build that
great class you have to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   If the benefit to Harvard is that it builds a great class, the
drawback is that its rejection of so many top students often irks
high school principals, counselors, and parents. Fitzsimmons gets
hate mail and threatening phone calls every year after the
rejection letters go out.

 By SUZANNE MACNEILLE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's 9 a.m. and the streets are packed in Jerusalem's Old City
souk. Middle Eastern pop music blares from boom boxes, shoppers
jostle one another and just ahead of me, a bicyclist nearly crashes
into a 500-year-old wall.
</P>
<P>
   In search of more tranquil surroundings, I head off for the
quieter Via Dolorosa, but on the way have second thoughts. Why not
a cruise down the Seine instead? Or perhaps a trek to Mount
Kanchendzonga in the Himalayas?
</P>
<P>
   By 10 a.m. I've managed to squeeze in all three sites and the
Grand Canyon besides. Yet, even for a virtual traveler, scouring
half the globe in an hour is no small accomplishment. My feet may
not ache, but my head is spinning.
</P>
<P>
   Never has the life of an armchair traveler been so exhausting.
Travel sites crowd the Web. Guidebooks to anyplace with a name and
a scenic overlook jam bookstore shelves.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the Travel Channel, the National Geographic
specials, Michael Palin and his ilk, leaning their heads out of
train windows in Siberia and bobbing around in walrus-skin boats in
Alaska. Who needs to pack a suitcase any more? There are far
cheaper ways to get that exotic view.
</P>
<P>
   The destination CD-ROM is one of those ways. Not to be confused
with practical and popular road-map or trip-planning CD-ROMs,
destination disks are glossy productions with photographic essays,
music and narratives, video clips, historical text, endless
point-and-click opportunities, glossaries and occasionally,
interactive games.
</P>
<P>
   Seldom do they bother with mundane stuff like hotels and
restaurants or how to get from Point A to Point B. While that may
fuel the criticism that destination CD-ROMs have no real practical
use, it also sidesteps the problem of their limited shelf life.
</P>
<P>
   Hotel rates vary. Museum hours change. Restaurants close. So why
not leave details to the guidebooks _ or the Internet, where sites
(if they're any good) are continually updated?
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, destination CD-ROMs steer so far away from modern
events that it is difficult to catch a glimpse of anything that
remotely suggests the 20th century. In EMME Interactive's Countries
of Romance, for example, it is not the real Italy we encounter, the
Italy of summer crowds and screeching tires, but the timeless
Italy, accompanied by period music and enticing graphics of things
that are generally no younger than 200 years old.
</P>
<P>
   What CD-ROMs can give the armchair traveler is depth and
immersion in a virtual experience. Their success, of course,
depends on how well they can persuade their viewers to suspend
their disbelief. While the CD-ROMs reviewed here may not be able to
simulate the bumpiness of a mountain bus ride, say, or the
smokiness of a flamenco club, they all perform very well as
destinations in and of themselves. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   COUNTRIES OF ROMANCE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (EMME Interactive; $38.99; Windows 3.1 and 95.) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Like a lushly illustrated coffee table book, Countries of
Romance is pretty to look at but lacks much detailed information.
The France, Spain and Italy we find in this set of three CD-ROMs
are the idealized versions, presented in broad strokes and caught
in centuries past.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the viewer who will get the most out of this collection
_ which is a perennial in stores _ is the art-history student
planning a first trip to Europe. Produced by EMME Interactive, the
Paris-based company that has also published CD-ROMs on the Louvre,
the Vatican and the Sistine Chapel, Countries of Romance is most
informative and innovative when it deals with art and historic
architecture.
</P>
<P>
   In Spain, three of the five main menu items focus solely on
architecture, including Roman, Islamic, Baroque and Renaissance
styles. A photographic sequence devoted to Antonio Gaudi's
surrealistic Barcelona buildings is especially appealing.
</P>
<P>
   In each of the CD-ROMs, at least one section is devoted to that
country's major artists, like Monet in France, Goya in Spain and
Piero della Francesca in Italy. Biographical texts and lists of
major works and their museum locations are given for each entry, as
is a selection of five or six paintings that the viewer can magnify
and examine.
</P>
<P>
   Photographs, graphics (including lovely but not particularly
useful maps), lots of period music and extensive narration make up
most of the format used here. There is some written text, but not
much.
</P>
<P>
   If you search for them, you will find short video clips on
bullfighting, flamenco, the Palio horse race in Siena, Florentine
football and, surprisingly, the May 1968 student riots in Paris,
the only nod at recent history in the collection.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best features in the entire set is the beautiful and
remarkably detailed graphic of the Grand Canal in Venice. You can
move along the right or left banks and click on a highlighted
building, like the Church of the Scalzi or the Doge's Palace, and
get a close-up photograph of the building accompanied by a brief
narrated history.
</P>
<P>
   The seemingly arbitrary selections of cities and subjects for
each country might make you wonder about what was left out. In
Voyage Through the Wonders of Italy you will find Venice, Rome,
Siena and Florence (albeit of several centuries ago), but you will
have to resort to your Baedeker or Michelin if you are looking for
anything on Milan, Bologna, Naples or the Tuscan countryside.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Voyage in Spain has nothing about Cadiz, Valencia or
the lovely white towns of Andalusia, and the France CD-ROM offers
virtually nothing on French cuisine or wine.
</P>
<P>
   Another element that has been ignored is the late 20th century.
Madrid is a sprawling, largely modern city, but one sees little
beyond the Prado or a nearly empty Plaza Mayor. And is it possible
that I never encountered a single car in traffic-ensnared Rome? &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Jerusalem is an exhaustive and realistic treatment of a
complicated city and, for the traveler, the most practical of the
CD-ROMs reviewed here. It manages to make good use of multimedia
without a lot of hype and without making you feel, as often happens
with destination disks, that you are about to embark on the journey
to end all journeys.
</P>
<P>
   Given the city's controversial history and politics, that is
quite an accomplishment. The makers of this CD-ROM have pulled off
a balanced yet complex introduction to Jewish, Muslim and Christian
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   This straightforward and thorough product is a good
advertisement for destination CD-ROMs that focus on single cities
rather than entire countries.
</P>
<P>
   The moment you start up this disk, you sense that there is a lot
of information to be gained. Compared with the other CD-ROMs
reviewed here, Jerusalem contains considerably more written text
and more video. The video segments are accompanied by ambient
sounds, like footsteps, conversation and the chattering of birds
rather than a musical score.
</P>
<P>
   There are few graphics. The most elaborate is a map of Jerusalem
on which the viewer can point and click to visit a particular spot.
A browser lists all the photographs and video clips, which is a
convenient option, given the extensive use of both.
</P>
<P>
   As in other destination disks, the narrator's tour-guide manner
and tireless bonhomie can be grating, but he imparts more detailed
information than most hosts of this type of CD-ROM.
</P>
<P>
   There are three main menu entries: Explorations, Religion and
History. Explorations includes the map mentioned above, tours of
the Old City market, the Dome of the Rock and a walk along the
ramparts, as well as scenic views from different vantage points
around the city.
</P>
<P>
   In Religion, you can, for example, visit the al-Aksa mosque at
prayer time, join a Jewish family for a Sabbath meal, walk up to
the Wailing Wall or view the crowded Easter procession on the Via
Dolorosa.
</P>
<P>
   In History, a surprisingly thorough entry, you can visit
different historical periods by clicking on a time line at the
bottom of the screen that starts at 3000 B.C. and runs through the
20th century. Bronze Age Jerusalem, Byzantine Jerusalem, Roman
Jerusalem, Ottoman Jerusalem, the Crusades, the British mandate,
1948, the present day _ no major period is ignored.
</P>
<P>
   To illustrate and explain the various historical periods, there
are videotaped interviews with archeologists, historians and
representatives of the three main religious groups and many photo
sequences, accompanied by written text, with links to other parts
of the disk, including a glossary.
</P>
<P>
   The present-day segment includes interviews with people like
Teddy Kollek, the outspoken former mayor of Jerusalem, and Dr.
Albert Aghazarian of Bir Zeit University in Ramallah.
</P>
<P>
   The attempt to explain the Jerusalem of today is particularly
admirable although it is a nearly impossible task because this
CD-ROM came out late last year. After all, anything published on
Jerusalem even in the last 24 hours would already be outdated. &QL;

   UP TO THE HIMALAYAS: KINGDOM IN THE CLOUDS (DNA Multimedia
Corp.; $49.95; Windows 3.1 and 95, and Macintosh.) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's not hard to be impressed by the fiery red tectonic plates
colliding in a noisy 3-D simulation as you witness the birth of the
Himalayas. It's the background effects _ the pulsating music, the
loud echoing voice of the narrator, the references to ``pure
being'' _ that make you think that the introduction to Up to the
Himalayas is getting way, way over the top.
</P>
<P>
   Once you get past the initial hard sell, however, things settle
down. Most viewers will find quite a bit to keep them entertained
on this 20-hour CD-ROM, produced by DNA Multimedia, based in
Vancouver, as they blithely wander around the small kingdom of
Sikkim (India's 22d state), high in a verdant section of the Indian
Himalayas. Lavish and sometimes showy use has been made of 3-D
animation, and tricks and puzzles are scattered throughout.
</P>
<P>
   The main directory offers a variety of sites to choose from: The
Palace, Mount Kanchendzonga, Gangtok, Caravans in the Clouds (an
explanation of ancient trade routes) and Archery (the national
sport). If you choose a destination, you must choose your mode of
transportation to get there: honking bus, squeaky Jeep, rickety van
or, for impatient Westerners, flying monk.
</P>
<P>
   For those who opt for conventional transportation, a lengthy
video of your vehicular travels along Sikkim's bumpy roads follows.
Though limited in size to less than a quarter of the computer
screen, this video sequence is especially rewarding for those who
enjoy precarious mountain drives, although I was somewhat
disappointed that the same footage was used for every destination.
</P>
<P>
   Up to the Himalayas also includes a relatively complicated
interactive game: you use your growing knowledge to find clues to
the reincarnated whereabouts of the recently deceased Lama Dorje,
whom the narrator calls a ``great Buddhist scholar.''
</P>
<P>
   To aid you, there is a diary where you can save scraps of
information for future reference. There is also a Book of Wisdom in
which you must answer detailed questions about Sikkim's history and
customs.
</P>
<P>
   If you would rather not play, there is also a captivating tour
of the town of Gangtok. Here you can meet food and trinket sellers
or enter buildings, including a dark Buddhist library where you can
flash a spotlight around and spy on the readers.
</P>
<P>
   The barely discernible whispers of a person reading to himself
is an especially nice touch. But a chiding voice telling me that I
must walk on the street ``like any mortal being'' whenever I
clicked on the confusing map of Gangtok was annoying.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Gangtok you will also find the quintessential resting
spot for weary electronic travelers, a terrace at the Hotel Tashi
Delek. You can click through the major phases of the day _ I like
the sunset option _ and enjoy the view of twinkling lights, jumbled
buildings and shadowy valleys before a little six-armed deity at
the bottom of your screen reminds you to reach for the mouse and
continue your journey.

SCIENTISTS GIVE `DEEP IMPACT' LOTS OF THUMBS-UP
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: yes. Fiction, no. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``They did a rather remarkable job,'' says Helin, of the Jet
Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., who was among several
scientists by moviemakers consulted in pre-production. ``I've been
involved for the last 20 or 25 years in these types of productions,
and this by far is the best that's been done.''
</P>
<P>
   `tHE SMOKING GUN'
</P>
<P>
   Until fairly recently, even most of the scientific world
pooh-poohed the danger posed by big pieces of celestial junk. That
began to change in 1980, when geologists first proposed that the
impact of a massive asteroid caused the extinction of the dinosaurs
and most other species 65 million years ago.
</P>
<P>
   That hypothesis was effectively confirmed this decade with the
discovery of a massive crater in Mexico, where scientists believe
an immense space boulder, probably six miles in diameter, crashed
into Earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was rather a widespread feeling that this was the
smoking gun,'' says Brian Marsden, a prominent Harvard astronomer.
</P>
<P>
   That discovery caused a collective shudder in the scientific
world. But in truth, Marsden says, evidence of the celestial danger
has been with us on every moon-filled night since the beginning of
man. After all, those aren't acne scars on the moon's tattered
surface.
</P>
<P>
   In 1908, a relatively small asteroid exploded in the atmosphere
above Siberia, flattening trees across an area larger than Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, the Shoemaker-Levy 9 comet provided one of history's
most dramatic demonstrations of the threat when pieces of it
smashed into Jupiter. Much of the resulting carnage was visible
through backyard telescopes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think we would see anything of the effects of impact
on Jupiter, but it was really quite dramatic,'' Marsden says. ``It
threw a lot of stuff up in big high plumes that were clearly
visible. Then, as Jupiter rotated, there was a dramatic black spot
where the hit occurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the Earth, looking at those consequences, knowing that
Jupiter is somewhat larger than the Earth, that would frighten
anybody out of their wits.''
</P>
<P>
   In March, Marsden was the first to predict that a huge, newly
discovered asteroid would pass dangerously close to Earth.
Additional observations and calculations quickly showed that the
original concern was somewhat overstated. But 30 years from now,
Asteroid 1997 XF11 will come closer than any known asteroid of that
size (perhaps as much as a mile in diameter) in recorded history.
</P>
<P>
   Someday, a big one won't miss. Hence the increasingly urgent
call from astronomers for the Earth to get ready. A top priority is
identifying the rest of the 2,000 large, threatening asteroids
still out there, an effort that could take a decade or more, and
cost between $5 million and $10 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   Technology must also be perfected to intercept and deflect
heavenly rocks headed for Earth. In the case of comets, that will
be difficult because of the relatively high speed with which they
hurtle across the solar system. Conventional rocketry would be
hard-pressed to keep up. But comets are relatively rare. Asteroids
present a much greater threat and will be easier to deflect.
</P>
<P>
   ``The basic idea is that you send up a rocket with a nuclear
explosive, an unmanned one, and you set it off about one radius of
the asteroid away,'' Hills says. It can be done. People have
analyzed it, and it looks quite tractable.''
</P>
<P>
   But not overnight, he says, and it's possible that asteroids
could approach with comparatively little warning.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you start fresh, and just wait until the asteroid is about
to hit us, nothing can be done,'' Hills says.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a congressional subcommittee heard testimony about
the threat and discussed funding to deal with it, but so far
nothing. President Clinton has vetoed funding for anti-asteroid
space missions.
</P>
<P>
   The possible consequences, scientists say, are now playing in a
theater near you.

<P>
   But tonight's mission is to attract, not reject. And 16-year-old
Aaron Niedermayer, a junior at Walt Whitman High School in
Bethesda, is listening. Harvard is one of five schools he would
consider attending; Duke, Northwestern, the University of
Pennsylvania, and Princeton are the others. A visit to Harvard last
summer kindled his interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have these stereotypes of Harvard as a place where
everybody is arrogant and a genius, but I didn't get that
impression when I went there,'' says Niedermayer as he leans on a
table in the back of the ballroom.
</P>
<P>
   Fighting Harvard's reputation for arrogance and elitism is one
of Fitzsimmons's main jobs. On this night, he is making a pitch for
his alma mater and employer alongside counterparts from Georgetown,
Penn, Duke, and MIT. A taut, scrubbed-looking marathoner in his
mid-50s, Fitzsimmons is wearing a green day-pack on his back, much
as a student would.
</P>
<P>
   He tells the crowd that when he was attending Catholic school in
Weymouth in the early '60s the nuns discouraged him from going to
Harvard, which they said was filled with ``atheists, communists,
and rich snobs _ which sounded interesting to me.'' Even then, he
says, that was not accurate. Today's Harvard is ``totally
different,'' he assures parents and students.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzsimmons spends several weeks each semester on the road,
meeting with students, parents, guidance counselors, and Harvard
alumni. Harvard takes the building of each year's freshman class
very seriously, looking not just for academic achievement but for
other traits _ including musical talent, community service,
athletics _ that show students have a passionate interest.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Harvard's image as a rarefied realm for the
intelligentsia, it has, in recent years, recruited a remarkable
collection of athletes for its 41 NCAA teams _ the highest number
of any university in the nation. It lured a world-class female
high-jumper from Hungary and has a strong women's basketball team
that upset top-seeded Stanford in the NCAA tournament before being
eliminated. Two members of the gold-medal US women's Olympic hockey
team will be returning in the fall. The privately funded football
recruiting budget has increased dramatically in the four years that
Tim Murphy has been coach, enabling him to search nationwide for
athletes such as Patterson, the Memphis native _ academically
strong and athletically gifted. Harvard won the Ivy League
championship last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard's athletes must reflect the makeup of the overall
student body in terms of class rank and SAT scores. One-third of
the members of the football team, for instance, finished first or
second in their high school class. Only one-quarter of Harvard
students have combined SAT scores below 1300, says Fitzsimmons, and
athletes are no different from the average.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard offers no financial reward for athletic or academic
skills, only grants, loans, and on-campus jobs. Armed with
full-tuition offers from other universities, Patterson tried to
negotiate for more of a grant, but was turned down. He is the
starting wide receiver on a football team that draws loyal, if
meager, crowds. He will have to repay student loans after
graduation, but he says it is worth it.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dream was big-time NCAA football,'' he says. ``I forewent
that dream, but I think it is a good trade-off.''
</P>
<P>
   Although they do not like to talk about it, Harvard officials
give preference to two other groups _ minorities and children of
alumni. Almost 35 percent of each year's freshmen class is drawn
from minority ranks, with blacks making up 8 to 9 percent, Latinos
8 to 9 percent, native Americans less than 1 percent, and
Asian-Americans 17-20 percent. Around 10 percent of each year's
class are so-called legacies. Officials say all legacies and
minorities qualify academically.
</P>
<P>
   After explaining the elaborate reviews that Harvard performs on
the thousands of applications it receives each year, Fitzsimmons
gets a big laugh when he tells the Bethesda audience: ``I know it
sounds like we have a perfect admissions process, but you must
remember that we admitted Theodore Kaczynski, who later became the
Unabomber.''
</P>
<P>
   Parents dominate the question-and-answer session, peppering the
deans with questions about financial aid, admissions
considerations, and research opportunities for undergraduates. As
Lee Stetson, dean of admissions at Penn puts it: ``It's not just a
degree they want, it's the best degree. They view college like a
durable consumer good and are willing to invest for it and borrow
for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvard's tuition is increasing faster than the inflation rate,
even though the school's $12.8 billion endowment generates enough
income each year that it could drastically lower tuition if
utilized. But to do that, Rudenstine and other administrators say,
would be irresponsible to future generations of students. Those who
can pay full fare are charged full fare. The middle class and poor
get financial aid on a sliding scale.
</P>
<P>
   All financial aid at Harvard is based on need, and almost 50
percent of students get direct grants averaging $14,500 a year,
just under half the tuition bill. All grant recipients also receive
loans, as do another 20 percent of the stuents. The average loan is
$4,600. Because of Harvard's substantial grant-giving, it is
considered one of the better values in higher education _ although
even after grants are taken into account, Harvard's overall price
still makes it more expensive than Stanford, Yale, and a dozen
other schools.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzsimmons is aware that other schools are offering more
attractive financial packages to the students they and Harvard are
pursuing. So this year, students accepted at Harvard were invited
to fax aid offers from other schools to Cambridge to see if Harvard
could do better. This helped Harvard reach the 80 percent yield
rate and bought the university time to decide if it will match the
financial breaks offered by Yale, Stanford, and Princeton.
</P>
<P>
   Niedermayer, the Bethesda prospect, is watching the slide shows,
which color all the campuses in a golden light. It's the parents
who ``go on and on about the money issue,'' he says, as his father
_ a Yale graduate with a Harvard law degree _ listens with
amusement. ``Kids don't care about it that much.''
</P>
<P>
   Niedermayer has not yet made up has mind, but as the deans hold
court in separate corners of the ballroom, he makes his way to
Fitzsimmons. Harvard, he says, is sounding more and more
interesting, which is what other students seem to be thinking as
well, for as the evening winds down, the Harvard crowd is growing
in size as the crowds around the deans of Penn, Duke, MIT, and
Georgetown shrink.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could coast, but you'd begin to see it very quickly _ like
the next year,'' says Fitzsimmons, who keeps talking to students
and parents late into the evening. ``If we are not out there with
our information, I assure you others will be. There are too many
other good options out there. The days are long gone when any
institution could get by only on its name.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Despite ranking, critics see unfulfilled potential &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Academically, Harvard again was No. 1 in this year's US News &AMP;
World Report annual survey of best colleges. Its graduate schools _
law, business, and medicine _ also consistently place in first or
second place in various rankings. Harvard's influential scholarship
and the output of new ideas, techniques, and inventions by faculty
and graduate students put it among the top research universities in
the country.

 is earning strong reviews from critics of an altogether different
sort: scientists working to ferret out deadly asteroids and comets
that might be headed toward Earth.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Zowie! We finally have a reasonable depiction of the
concern,'' planetary scientist Eleanor Helin says.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a movie it was pretty good, and as a piece of science it
was pretty good, too,'' says Clark Chapman, another prominent
astronomer. ``Scientists are critical people, but here they have
made a serious attempt to try and get it right. They didn't always
succeed, but it's roughly right in a lot of respects.''
</P>
<P>
   Which might be good news for ``Deep Impact,'' but bad news for
civilization as we know it. The movie chronicles the attempts of
earthlings to deal with a massive comet racing toward a collision
with our planet. Suffice it to say that they are not completely
successful. A large piece of comet lands just off the Atlantic
coast and spawns a tidal wave 100 yards high. Moviegoers observe as
New York City and Washington, D.C., are quite believably
obliterated.
</P>
<P>
   Thus goes the latest in a spate of celestial disaster dramatics.
In last year's ``Asteroid'' TV miniseries, Dallas got creamed.
Coming soon is ``Armaggedon,'' in which space hero Bruce Willis is
dispatched to save the world by taking on an asteroid the size of
Texas. (Scientists roll their eyes at this.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Deep Impact'' they say, is easily the best of the lot. What
happens in the movie could happen in real life. That and worse.
It's not likely any moment soon, perhaps, but planetary experts say
the risk posed by asteroids and comets justifies far more concern
than is currently exhibited by politicians and the general public.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, the threat is real,'' says Jack Hills, an
asteroid specialist with Los Alamos National Laboratory in New
Mexico. ``It doesn't happen very often, which is fortunate in one
respect. But in many ways it's unfortunate, because we won't do
anything before the next one comes.''
</P>
<P>
   And the consequences of such inaction should a huge piece of
space junk be headed our way?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're toast,'' Hills says.
</P>
<P>
   AN UNIMAGINABLE DEATH TOLL
</P>
<P>
   Astronomers have charted 120 asteroids more than a kilometer in
diameter whose orbits intersect with Earth, and the number grows
almost monthly. So far, calculations show that none poses a real
threat. But scientists estimate that 2,000 space rocks of that size
(the terms ``asteroid'' and ``meteor'' are essentially
interchangeable) zip about the solar system, most of them as yet
unseen.
</P>
<P>
   Should one that size strike land, dust and vapors thrust into
the stratosphere by the impact would plunge Earth into darkness for
months, killing off much plant and animal life. The human species
probably would not be entirely lost, but the death toll would be
unimaginable.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a huge celestial object slamming into the Atlantic
Ocean would produce ``a tsunami that goes all the way up to the
Appalachian Mountains in the upper two-thirds of the United
States,'' Hills says. ``In Europe, the coast of the Iberian
peninsula, Spain and Portugal, is basically wiped out, and the
(seacoast) of France. So it's quite severe.''
</P>
<P>
   Scientists put the odds of such a catastrophe happening this
year at about 1 in 300,000, considerably greater than those for
drawing a royal flush in poker (1 in 649,000). Odds for a lesser
but still disastrous collision are much greater, they say.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably about 1 in 3,000 or 1 in 5,000,'' Hills says.
``That is, something large enough to devastate many kilometers of
coastline. It would certainly be devastating regionally.''
</P>
<P>
   So it is a mistake to dismiss ``Deep Impact'' as science
fiction, as many have done. Science, yes. Fiction, no. MORE &QL;

MICHAEL DOUGLAS DISCUSSES LATEST ROLE IN ``A PERFECT MURDER''
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Ask Michael Douglas to play the old acting-class game
of which animal he'd see himself as, and it takes him only a second
to reply, ``A fly on the wall.'' But it never has worked out that
way, especially in his latest film, ``A Perfect Murder,'' opening
Friday. Smiling and checking sports scores in a paper as he settles
into a sofa in an East Side hotel, Douglas says of his new role, as
a raging Wall Street cuckold, ``I guess you'd call me a great white
shark.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, there's some dipping back to Gordon Gekko'' _ the part
in ``Wall Street'' for which Douglas won an Oscar _ ``in terms of
this guy's job as a financier and his behavior. I mean, he kind of
eats everything in his way.''
</P>
<P>
   In the film, Douglas simmers at the center of a lethal triangle
with Gwyneth Paltrow as his silk-stocking district trophy wife and
Viggo Mortensen as a painter with whom she's having an affair. ``A
Perfect Murder'' bears little resemblance to the film on which it's
based, Alfred Hitchcock's ``Dial M for Murder.'' Douglas, who says
he hasn't seen most of his own movies because he doesn't enjoy the
experience, says he hasn't seen many of Hitchcock's, either. He
liked ``Rear Window.'' ``Psycho'' _ heading for a remake with Anne
Heche _ is part of his personal history.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of my first jobs was as an assistant film editor on
`Lonely Are the Brave,' which is my favorite of the pictures my dad
(Kirk Douglas) did. It was at Universal Studios. Down the hall they
were editing and cutting `Psycho.' In those days they didn't have
commissaries and such. We brought brown bag lunches. So we used to
go down at lunchtime with our brown bags and watch the outtakes of
Janet Leigh in that shower scene in `Psycho.' Then when I came on
board for this picture, I didn't want to go back and see the
original.''
</P>
<P>
   The film he couldn't help thinking back to, Douglas says, was
``Fatal Attraction.'' ``In that picture, I had the role Gwyneth
Paltrow plays here. I was the adulterer in that picture. She plays
an adulteress here. I was surprised how quickly people forgave me
in `Fatal Attraction.' People have been cheering Gwyneth in the
previews. But, you know, adultery is one thing, and attempted
murder is another. So it's just a question of how bad you are. Real
evil roles are relatively easy to play because there's something
unrealistic to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what the attraction and fantasy are from the
audience's point of view. We have a big attraction to villains. I
was making comparisons to my dad, who got his first acknowledgment
in `Champion,' where he played a bad guy. I guess whereas most of
us in life are censored in our actions, villains aren't. So there's
that little piece in all of us that loves to watch somebody act out
those things we only think about in our deepest, darkest secrets.
It gives you a freedom. But you have to be unpredictable. A lot of
the appeal with Gwyneth is that she looks as if she has a secret.
So I thought Steven Taylor (Douglas's character) should have a
secret too.''

<P>
   When told that Paltrow, speaking via satellite from London,
described him as smooth, together, and in control, and said she
always felt like addressing him as ``sir,'' Douglas laughs. ``She
should! I've known her mother, Blythe Danner, since we both
auditioned for Lincoln Center in 1968, and I met her father, Bruce,
soon afterward. I remember Gwen as a girl in high school. This guy
I play, well, yeah, there's a slickness to him. He's really a kind
of coverup guy, trying to act more charming and looser than he
really was.
</P>
<P>
   ``You try to create sympathy for your character, by showing his
rags-to-riches story played against his wife's inherited money and
position. Yeah, there was an anger to him. Yet in the first act,
you want to create sympathy for him because he was the one being
cheated on. Like, awwwww, Mikey, awwwww. What he didn't give his
wife, though, was passion and time. I mean, usually what happens
when you go into affairs, somebody's giving you something you're
not getting. I think her life is pretty much focused on his
attention. Then all of a sudden, here's somebody who's focusing all
of his energies and expertise on her,'' says Douglas, 54, recently
single after the end of his own marriage.
</P>
<P>
   The buzz around the film centered largely on a reshot ending.
Douglas minimizes its importance, saying the differences between
the two endings weren't nearly as divergent as the two wrap-ups of
``Fatal Attraction.'' In the first ending of ``Attraction,'' Glenn
Close's angry spurned lover frames Douglas's adulterer for murder.
In the one the public saw, he got off and returned to his family.
The two resolutions of ``A Perfect Murder,'' Douglas says, without
giving away the outcome, have to do with a final killing. In one
ending, it's done in self-defense. In the other, it's coldblooded.
``Which one you prefer depends on how dark and sick you are,'' he
says, smiling.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas says he hadn't planned to do ``A Perfect Murder,''
especially on the heels of ``The Game,'' in which he portrayed a
San Francisco millionaire plunged into a terrifying loss of control
over his life. ``The last thing I was looking for was another
Prince of Darkness role, after `The Game.' But it was what was
ready, and I make choices based on lack of comfort. It's exciting
when there's an element of danger, and the fun here was to make
this guy more than a two-dimensional villain. Comedy is not
something that comes naturally to me. But I liked doing `American
President,' and I love dark comedy, like `War of the Roses.' My
next role will be a heroic one, a good commander of a World War II
submarine, called `U-571,' so that will be fun.''
</P>

   Then there's the project Douglas says he must do, the one
alongside his father, now 82. ``It's coming along,'' he says of
``Songs for David.'' ``It's getting closer. It's a tough one to do
right. We both feel we don't wanna do it unless it's done right.
And we only have one shot at it. It's a father-son piece involving
the construction business in New York. It's about a retired
chairman of the board, and his son is taking over, and the
struggles and dilemma and ultimate resolution.''

   The Oedipal resonances between the story and Michael Douglas's
relationship with his father are obvious. Douglas's parents
divorced early. He was raised by his mother, and he sidled into
acting in low-key fashion. ``In my father's generation, movie stars
were larger than life,'' he says, explaining the difference. ``In
my movies, people kind of relate to me. I mean, most people feel,
`that could be me up there. I could play that part. I could be that
person.'''
</P>
<P>
   Kirk Douglas tended toward the flamboyant. Michael Douglas,
Prince of Darkness roles notwithstanding, has been a readily
identifiable beleaguered Everyman in films ranging from ``Falling
Down'' to ``Disclosure.'' Anger is a part of his persona, too, but
in more layered, less immediately apparent ways. His on-screen
identity has also been influenced by wearing two hats
interchangeably over many years: actor and producer. Years after
his father's play, ``One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,'' flopped on
Broadway, Douglas bought the screen rights and made his father rich
from the Oscar-winning film starring Jack Nicholson. Douglas has
successfully produced some of his own films, ranging from ``The
China Syndrome'' to ``Romancing the Stone.'' Yet he says he can't
stand producing films he acts in.
</P>
<P>
   ``This one was a pleasure. Just acting is cool. At the end of
the day, you go home. `Bye-bye, see ya. The dailies were great last
night? Glad to hear it!' Doing both is contradictory. I mean,
acting is about being selfish. It's about what's in front of you.
You are the most important thing in the world. Most really good
actors are very self-involved. You almost have to have a degree of
selfishness to be so much in demand of attention for yourself.
Producing is about being involved in everything that's going on
around you. If I'm producing, I'm watching all the other actors,
and seeing if I think they're fulfilling not only their
responsibility to the scene, but to the picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would I direct? It's beginning to be of more interest to me.
It's been starting to haunt me a little bit as we get into
reshooting endings like this. Certainly, I've been accused by
enough directors of meddling. But my acting career didn't really
take off until `Wall Street' and `Fatal Attraction.' So it's only
been about 13-14 years. Producing keeps me busy too. But I'm
recently single, my son is an adult, and I've got a lot of free
time on my hands. I better stay busy. I'm not good with a lot of
time on my hands. I like sporting events because you never know
what's going to happen until the end. In the movies, usually 20
minutes into the picture you kind of guess where it's going to go.
I'd love to get involved in a picture about sports. And my golf
game is getting good. I hope to make the Senior Tour one of these
days!''

 is earning strong reviews from critics of an altogether different
sort: scientists working to ferret out deadly asteroids and comets
that might be headed toward Earth.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Zowie! We finally have a reasonable depiction of the
concern,'' planetary scientist Eleanor Helin says.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a movie it was pretty good, and as a piece of science it
was pretty good, too,'' says Clark Chapman, another prominent
astronomer. ``Scientists are critical people, but here they have
made a serious attempt to try and get it right. They didn't always
succeed, but it's roughly right in a lot of respects.''
</P>
<P>
   Which might be good news for ``Deep Impact,'' but bad news for
civilization as we know it. The movie chronicles the attempts of
earthlings to deal with a massive comet racing toward a collision
with our planet. Suffice it to say that they are not completely
successful. A large piece of comet lands just off the Atlantic
coast and spawns a tidal wave 100 yards high. Moviegoers observe as
New York City and Washington, D.C., are quite believably
obliterated.
</P>
<P>
   Thus goes the latest in a spate of celestial disaster dramatics.
In last year's ``Asteroid'' TV miniseries, Dallas got creamed.
Coming soon is ``Armaggedon,'' in which space hero Bruce Willis is
dispatched to save the world by taking on an asteroid the size of
Texas. (Scientists roll their eyes at this.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Deep Impact'' they say, is easily the best of the lot. What
happens in the movie could happen in real life. That and worse.
It's not likely any moment soon, perhaps, but planetary experts say
the risk posed by asteroids and comets justifies far more concern
than is currently exhibited by politicians and the general public.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, the threat is real,'' says Jack Hills, an
asteroid specialist with Los Alamos National Laboratory in New
Mexico. ``It doesn't happen very often, which is fortunate in one
respect. But in many ways it's unfortunate, because we won't do
anything before the next one comes.''
</P>
<P>
   And the consequences of such inaction should a huge piece of
space junk be headed our way?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're toast,'' Hills says.
</P>
<P>
   AN UNIMAGINABLE DEATH TOLL
</P>
<P>
   Astronomers have charted 120 asteroids more than a kilometer in
diameter whose orbits intersect with Earth, and the number grows
almost monthly. So far, calculations show that none poses a real
threat. But scientists estimate that 2,000 space rocks of that size
(the terms ``asteroid'' and ``meteor'' are essentially
interchangeable) zip about the solar system, most of them as yet
unseen.
</P>
<P>
   Should one that size strike land, dust and vapors thrust into
the stratosphere by the impact would plunge Earth into darkness for
months, killing off much plant and animal life. The human species
probably would not be entirely lost, but the death toll would be
unimaginable.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a huge celestial object slamming into the Atlantic
Ocean would produce ``a tsunami that goes all the way up to the
Appalachian Mountains in the upper two-thirds of the United
States,'' Hills says. ``In Europe, the coast of the Iberian
peninsula, Spain and Portugal, is basically wiped out, and the
(seacoast) of France. So it's quite severe.''
</P>
<P>
   Scientists put the odds of such a catastrophe happening this
year at about 1 in 300,000, considerably greater than those for
drawing a royal flush in poker (1 in 649,000). Odds for a lesser
but still disastrous collision are much greater, they say.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably about 1 in 3,000 or 1 in 5,000,'' Hills says.
``That is, something large enough to devastate many kilometers of
coastline. It would certainly be devastating regionally.''
</P>
<P>
   So it is a mistake to dismiss ``Deep Impact'' as science
fiction, as many have done. Science, yes. Fiction, no. MORE &QL;

 UNDATED: ... on Limerick.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Few challenge Harvard's verdict. The university conciliates some
tenure victims, such as Berkowitz, with an extra year on staff;
others fear being blackballed if they complain. One exception was
Clare Dalton, who sued after being denied tenure by the law school
in 1987. Harvard settled the case in 1993 by paying $260,000 to a
domestic violence institute she heads at Northeastern University. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Junior faculty need not apply &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was, junior faculty members agreed as they listened to their
elders discuss fringe benefits a decade ago, classic theater of the
absurd. The tenured historians on the Committee to Improve Junior
Professorships were trying to patch the roof while the foundation
was collapsing.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, someone dared to ask Professor Bernard Bailyn, who
chaired the committee, why the department had not offered tenure to
a junior Americanist since 1959.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bad luck,'' Bailyn replied.
</P>
<P>
   Bailyn, the great historian of colonial America, knew better. He
and post-World War II contemporaries such as Oscar Handlin, had
themselves risen through Harvard's ranks to tenure, and forged its
pre-eminence in American history.
</P>
<P>
   Then the upheavals of the '60s reshaped the field. Ambitious
books devoted to entire eras, such as Arthur Schlesinger Jr.'s
``The Age of Jackson'' (1945), gave way to narrow studies of
oppressed groups _ women, blacks, Native Americans.
</P>
<P>
   To Harvard's elders, interest-group politics had supplanted
scholarship. In a 1970 jeremiad, Handlin lamented the ``erosion of
the basic skills, atrophy of familiarity with the essential
procedures, dissipation of the core fund of knowledge.'' Promotions
and appointments, complained Handlin, ``rest on strategic or
ideological considerations rather than on merit.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe elsewhere, but not at Harvard. Its wise men pulled up the
drawbridge against an entire generation. Then, in 1986, Brinkley
came knocking. A magnetic teacher, he turned down offers elsewhere
because he had been assured of breaking the Harvard impasse. But at
a key department meeting, sources say, several senior Americanists
voted against him, on the grounds that his scholarship was too
shallow.
</P>
<P>
   ``The university should have stepped in and said, `We can't have
this,''' says Donald. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Entrenched historians ignore committee's advice &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the administration blinked. Although Brinkley had won a
narrow majority in the department vote, A. Michael Spence, then
dean of arts and sciences, quashed his candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard has occasionally placed departments paralyzed by
factional disputes over appointments, such as sociology in the
1980s, in a kind of academic receivership. But it did not confront
the entrenched historians. And while the visiting committee for
history, part of a system that monitors all Harvard departments,
urged a more welcoming attitude toward junior faculty, its advice
went unheeded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their reputation in American history has suffered,'' says one
scholar who has served on the committee, and requested anonymity.
``It was once the place to study American history. It's still good,
and they've got some fine historians. But I don't think it's at the
very top any more.''
</P>
<P>
   Brinkley's ouster particularly upset students and junior
faculty. The number of undergraduate history majors, which then
stood at 497, plunged immediately and has never recovered; there
are currently 260. Junior faculty took refuge in gallows humor.
They joked that the Dunwalke Chair in American history, held by
Brinkley and other untenured associate professors, was aptly named:
When they were done, they walked.
</P>
<P>
   They referred to their pot luck suppers as ``Dinners of the
Ephemeral Faculty.'' And they held an annual get-together marking
the anniversary of the last book by Professor Donald Fleming, who
specializes in American intellectual history.
</P>
<P>
   Junior faculty say Fleming blocked one candidate after another,
citing insufficient publications. Yet Fleming has not authored a
book by himself since 1954.
</P>
<P>
   At 74, Fleming remains a popular teacher. He barely avoided
mandatory retirement, turning 70 soon after the policy was
abolished in 1993. In a telephone interview, he defended the
rejections of junior faculty, but added that some of them should
have been ``brought back'' later on.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1954, Fleming said, he has written several monographs and
edited and contributed to scholarly volumes. Then he said, ``I take
it you'll turn this into a personal attack,'' and hung up. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Restoring the luster to American history &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After nearly two decades with hardly any new blood in US
history, Harvard in recent years has tried to restock from outside
_ only to see most of its offers rejected. ``We have too few
Americanists, period,'' acknowledges William Kirby, the department
chairman.
</P>
<P>
   The hiring of Ulrich, a Pulitzer Prize-winning specialist in
women's history, from the University of New Hampshire in 1995
signaled a long-awaited glasnost. In 1996, she and Kirby invited
several luminaries _ including the previously exiled Limerick _ to
a brainstorming session. The topic: How to restore Harvard's luster
in American history.
</P>
<P>
   Their advice eventually translated into three offers of tenured
positions. Lizabeth Cohen, a widely-respected 20th-century
historian at New York University, accepted, but the other two
outsiders declined.
</P>
<P>
   Richard White, a specialist in western US history from the
University of Washington, opted for Stanford. And Pulitzer
Prize-winner Alan Taylor decided to stay at the University of
California's Davis campus because his wife, a classics professor,
was on track for tenure there. At Harvard, she would have no such
expectation.
</P>
<P>
   In US News and World Report's 1998 rankings of graduate
programs, Harvard stood sixth overall in history, and seventh in
modern US history. ``Harvard is within striking distance of making
the claim that they're as good as any American history
department,'' Taylor says. ``They need more hires and to build the
morale of junior faculty....It's a harder task to turn around a
luxury liner than a more modest craft.''
</P>
<P>
   By rejecting Fitzpatrick, Harvard missed an opportunity to
reverse the liner's course, and end a 39-year drought. Now at the
University of New Hampshire, she articulates the blighted hopes of
all those young scholars discarded in the name of excellence by a
harsh and, at times, capricious system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite all the evidence to the contrary, it's difficult not
to begin to think that you can be the exception,'' Fitzpatrick
says. ``You get on the hamster wheel, and you start spinning.''

   SEASIDE, Fla. _ Where do you go to shoot a movie about a
perfectly ordinary American whose whole life, unbeknownst to him,
is a scripted show for television?
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, you'd find a place that looked so stereotypically
small-town America, so thoroughly front-porched and picket-fenced,
that it could pass for a movie set.
</P>
<P>
   This is what the producers of ``The Truman Show,'' which opens
Friday, were looking for _ and what they found in Seaside, Fla.,
the famous neotraditional town on the Gulf Coast. But there was one
thing missing from the real Seaside that the producers felt their
hero absolutely had to have: a lawn.
</P>
<P>
   That's right, there are no private lawns in Seaside. The town's
strict design guidelines prohibit them. So the set designers for
``The Truman Show'' had to rip out the garden of native plants
surrounding Truman Burbank's perfect little house on Natchez Street
in order to roll out the carpet of Kentucky bluegrass his cliched
existence demanded. For how was this perfectly ordinary American
going to spend his Saturday mornings if he had no lawn to mow?
</P>
<P>
   In the last few years a million or so words have been written
pointing up the environmental and philosophical folly of the Great
American lawn. Lawns consume unconscionable amounts of energy and
chemicals, while producing little more than landscape conformity
and social anxiety. People complain _ but people continue to mow,
as if it were their solemn civic duty.
</P>
<P>
   Except, that is, in Seaside.
</P>
<P>
   By permitting only native species in front yards, and by
outlawing sod, Seaside has seceded from the great green river of
lawn that joins Americans, yard by unfenced yard, from Maine to
California. In March, I spent a couple of days at Seaside, and
though it would be foolish to proclaim I've seen the future, I had
a vision of what post-lawn America might look like.
</P>
<P>
   Much about Seaside was revolutionary when it was founded 17
years ago, but perhaps nothing about it remains as radical as its
landscape: the exuberant thickets of native plants (live oak,
Southern magnolia, beach rosemary and a host of others) that
threaten to burst their tidy picket enclosures.
</P>
<P>
   By now the town's neotraditional houses look downright familiar,
for the simple reason that Seaside helped bring back such
traditional elements as the front porch.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time the town-planning concepts that Robert Davis,
Seaside's developer, and Andres Duany and Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk,
its designers, pioneered here _ houses on tiny lots pulled up close
to walkable streets leading to public spaces _ have gone on to
inspire a national movement.
</P>
<P>
   But if the reach of Seaside's influence has blunted the novelty
of its architecture and layout, the town's gardens _ just now
coming into their own _ have lost none of their power to astonish.
Seaside's landscaping may well be the most revolutionary thing
about the place. It's one thing to challenge the architecture and
planning of the American subdivision, but it's quite another to
abolish something as fundamental as the American front lawn.
</P>
<P>
   When I asked Davis why a real estate developer hoping to sell
houses to Americans would challenge their inalienable right to mow,
he smiled. ``I suppose I didn't know enough to know how crazy it
was,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides being a developer, Davis was a child of the '60s, an
ardent environmentalist who happened to inherit 80 acres of scrubby
Gulf Coast beachfront and decided to experiment with them. When
Douglas Duany, Seaside's landscape architect (and Andres Duany's
younger brother), first met with Davis to discuss the town's
landscape style, Davis simply pointed out the window at the low,
windswept scrub clinging to the sugary white sand and said, ``I
sort of like what's out there now.''
</P>
<P>
   This was 1982, years before nurseries in the area began carrying
the sand live oak, woody goldenrod and wild lupins that make up the
local scrub forest. Yet, growing turf on a barrier island would
have been, in Davis' words, ``dumber than dirt.'' For one thing,
there WAS no dirt, only sand.
</P>
<P>
   So Douglas Duany drew up a list of the plants Seaside would
allow, and turf grass was not among them. To preserve as much of
the existing vegetation as possible, builders were told they could
disturb no more than a four-foot zone surrounding the house. ``One
contractor almost took my head off when I told him he couldn't
simply scrape the lot with a bulldozer and fix it later with grass
and shrubs,'' Duany told me.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, Seaside's sales force encountered some resistance,
too, though they soon learned the ``grass question'' was a good way
to identify serious buyers. ``Prospects who gagged on the `no lawn'
rule usually had trouble with the rest of the concept, too,'' one
broker explained.
</P>
<P>
   Which makes sense: Seaside posed a challenge to the whole
suburban regime of private castles surrounded by vast moats of
lawn; those home buyers who welcomed the idea of shrinking their
private realms were the ones least wedded to their Toros.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that only a tenth of Seaside's 300-plus families live
here year round also helped, since the landscape rules promised
homeowners almost complete freedom from yard chores.
</P>
<P>
   At first, I didn't get it when Davis described Seaside's garden
style as ``Gertrude Jekyll gone native.'' Walking down one of
Seaside's older streets for the first time, I wasn't sure these
yards even qualified as gardens _ many of them looked untended and
disorganized, as if the ``gardener'' had merely thrown a fence
around a patch of the scrub forest to keep it from escaping. Yet,
the more I walked, the more these yards came into focus as
exquisitely subtle gardens.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it wasn't until I went for a jog through the scrub
forest just beyond Seaside's town line that I understood the
Seaside yard wasn't simply a restoration of the native plant
community but a carefully edited representation of it. It was, like
all gardens, a metaphor of nature.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Where the real scrub formed a low, impenetrable thicket,
Seaside's trees, protected from the salt spray by the architecture,
have by now risen well above head height, creating an agreeably
shady canopy that shelters walkers. The contorted branches of the
live oaks throw webs of spooky shadows against the freshly painted
houses.
</P>
<P>
   Since much of Seaside's architecture tends to err on the side of
sweetness and light, this unexpectedly Gothic inflection renders
the houses more interesting, less wholesome.
</P>
<P>
   The typical Seaside garden is layered vertically. Beneath the
canopy of oak and magnolia leaves is a relatively open space at eye
level that affords a welcome sense of prospect; then, around waist
level, the density resumes, with informal plantings of beach
rosemary, woody goldenrod, lupins, gopher apple and bluestem grass.
</P>
<P>
   A few small areas have been carved out for barbecues, benches or
paths, but for the most part, human life is meant to take place on
porches and decks _ realms of Culture set within patches of
seemingly unreconstructed Nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gardening by subtraction'' is how Randy Harelson explained the
method. A garden designer by training, Harelson moved from New
England to Seaside six years ago. Nowadays he consults with the
Town Council on horticultural issues, designs private gardens for
homeowners and runs the Gourd Garden, a native-plant nursery two
miles east of Seaside.
</P>
<P>
   ``The landscape here gets very little credit for putting Seaside
on the map,'' he told me. ``But if you try looking at the
architecture by itself, mentally removing the scrub and replacing
it with lawn and foundation plantings, it gets boring very
quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   The point is proven by Truman Burbank's intentionally trite
yard, as well as by most of the new houses rising on the west side,
where trees have yet to subdue the noisy parliament of
Architectural Expression.
</P>
<P>
   It's the rub between the neat white picket fences and the
luxuriant, heedless plantings that gives Seaside's best gardens
their power. Remove the tidy enclosures and the plantings would
immediately look slovenly or go slack _ the fate of all too many
wild or native gardens.
</P>
<P>
   Gertrude Jekyll understood it wasn't enough to bring England's
native plants into the garden; they needed the frame of
architecture if they hoped to make the leap from meadow to garden.
The tight, controlling picket fences set off Seaside's raucous
planting much the same way that Sir Edwin Lutyens' formal walls and
paths set off Gertrude Jekyll's relaxed perennial borders. At
Seaside the juxtapositions reach an almost violent pitch that I
suspect would have popped Miss Jekyll's spectacles. But the
underlying principle is the same.
</P>
<P>
   Harelson says Seaside residents have taken the town's landscape
to heart, especially now that the tree canopy has matured. ``The
challenge was getting people to prune from below to create an
understory, rather than from above, which is what most of us are
accustomed to,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Definitive proof that Seaside's landscape has set deep roots in
the community came a few years back when the town planners decided
that the scrub crowding the median strip of Seaside Avenue, a main
axis, should be replaced with grass. Residents on the avenue
rebelled, defending their corridor of wilderness in a battle that
some say marked the moment when Seaside _ residents and plants
alike _ slipped from the control of developers and designers.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, for one, regards this as healthy, part of the town's
inevitable passing from idea into history. He described a recent
conference at which a visiting English architect criticized
Seaside's landscaping. ``He told us it was time to cut everything
back _ hard _ since the foliage was now obscuring the
architecture,'' Davis said. ``We had to explain that that's exactly
what people like about it. There are so many tourists passing by
that our porches would be fishbowls if not for the trees.''
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the town's celebrity, sure to increase with the
release of ``The Truman Show,'' a porch wreathed in a tangle of oak
and magnolia is a blessing. The sheer wildness of Seaside's gardens
is thus an inadvertent byproduct of the town's success.
</P>
<P>
   As I walked Seaside's streets, I wondered why Seaside's many
imitators have so far failed to imitate it. Other New Urbanist
communities have managed to shrink the front lawn and fence it in,
but I don't know of another town in America that has dared to do
away with it entirely. In fact, at Disney's town of Celebration _
where Truman Burbank would have fit in without changing a thing _
the rules actually require homeowners to maintain a minimum amount
of lawn.
</P>
<P>
   Seaside's landscape is a special case, one that may not lend
itself to imitation. It has taken everything from the abundance of
gawkers to the paucity of humus to the conviction of its slightly
naive developer to make lawns untenable here. It is also true that
landscape styles, rooted as they are in the particularities of
place, never traveled as easily as architectural styles.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Seaside points a way, ONE way, and if we Americans ever
do declare our independence from the tyranny of lawns, we will look
back at Seaside as our exuberantly overgrown and unmowable Bunker
Hill.

 UNDATED: ... in the country.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Still, some critics charge that Harvard is indeed coasting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harvard is the greatest university in the world,'' says former
provost Jerry R. Green, now a professor at the Harvard Business
School. ``Given its strength and the resources it has, it could be
doing better. It could offer better education to graduate students
and undergraduates. But it's very hard to aim at a high target like
that when you're already in first place. Why make changes and do
that?''
</P>
<P>
   Loren Pope, an educational consultant and the author of
``Looking beyond the Ivy League: Finding the College that is Right
for You,'' says the elements most students and their parents want _
close faculty-student relationship, collaborative learning, a sense
of academic community _ cannot be found at a place like Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure you get some of the brightest kids at Harvard, but
academic intelligence is only one sliver of intelligence,'' he
says. ``When kids come to college assured of success, they have no
need to struggle for greater understanding.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeremy Knowles, dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, says
that a major part of Harvard's capital campaign will be devoted to
increasing the faculty-to-student ratio and boosting the advising
and mentoring of students in order to ``reshape the nature of the
undergraduate experience.'' Nevertheless, Harvard is known for its
tradition of merit and scholarship, and that is unlikely to change.
Fads and innovations in higher education are not viewed favorably.
A case in point is ``service learning.''
</P>
<P>
   At many colleges, volunteerism is now coupled with academics in
a way that brings practical skills to community service projects _
tutoring in schools, working at soup kitchens _ and enables
students to learn from the experience while receiving academic
credit.
</P>
<P>
   Every school at Harvard is deeply involved in community
outreach. Most student-organized charity takes place through the
Phillips Brooks House Association, which places undergraduates in
programs ranging from aid to migrant farm workers to operating an
emergency winter shelter at the University Lutheran Church in
Harvard Square. By the time they graduate, more than 70 percent of
students have performed community service. But the motive is pure
volunteerism, say Harvard officials, not academic credit. The
university is not interested in service learning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harvard is not a vocational school,'' says Judith Kidd,
director of the Phillips Brooks House. ``It is the rare student who
wants credit for service.''
</P>
<P>
   But that's a shame, says Robert Diamond a professor at Syracuse
University who specializes in higher education. ``How much more
potent their experience would be if it were orchestrated so that
they learn from it'' with give-and-take in the classroom, he says.
``If any group in the world needs to understand the underlying
sociological problems they are encountering it is Harvard kids.
They are the ones who will be in the greatest position to influence
those problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Diamond, who has conducted large-scale studies of the academic
quality of leading research universities, also questions whether
the best teaching and learning is taking place at Harvard. Because
of the high quality of the students, he says, it is almost
impossible to judge what sort of intellectual growth is happening.
Academic work is no problem to the brightest of the bright.
</P>
<P>
   ``At Harvard I could be pretty damn bad as an instructor,''
Diamond says, ``and my students are still going to succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   Ninety-eight percent of students who enter Harvard graduate;
only the California Institute of Technology has a higher graduation
rate. Many Harvard students acknowledge that classes, studying,
writing, and learning are not problems for them. Consequently,
students put large amounts of time into extracurriculars _
community service, athletics, the Crimson, singing groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harvard has been very disappointing academically,'' says a
junior English major who attended prep school in the South and was
surprised by what he considers the university's parched
intellectual climate. ``I expected knowledge to drip from the walls
of this place, but it didn't. But the thing to remember about
Harvard is that if you want something you have to go and get it.''
</P>
<P>
   Like several other students, he did not want his name used for
fear that professors will grade him more rigorously because of his
critical comments. His view, however, is not shared by all Harvard
undergraduates.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a place for self-starters, people willing to take the
initiative,'' says Lamelle Rawlins, a 21-year-old junior from
Macomb, Ill., who was president of the student body last year.
``But I have found it very rigorous, though people coming from
elite prep schools might feel differently. I am uncomfortable with
people who characterize Harvard as easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether it is academics or extracurriculars, Harvard students
and administrators acknowledge that the undergraduate population is
so single-minded in its pursuit of excellence that students often
do not recognize when they are under strain. And when they do, many
are reluctant to ask for help. It is another of the hidden costs
associated with the world's most sought-after college degree.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1997-'98 academic year, two undergraduates and two
graduate students committed suicide _ twice the national average on
college campuses. Each was a separate tragedy (one of the
undergraduates had withdrawn from Harvard at the time) and the high
number in one year may have been a fluke. But Dr. David Rosenthal,
director of Harvard health services, acknowledged that stress
levels at the school are ``as high as everywhere else'' and that a
common theme among students is that they ``fear letting people
down.''
</P>
<P>
   The father of one of the students, David Okrent, a junior, said
his son felt that ``because of the great expense of this place, he
didn't think he was performing at the level he should be.'' A 1995
murder-suicide at Harvard's Dunster house shook the school and
prompted a book _ ``Halfway Heaven: Diary of a Harvard Murder'' by
former Harvard tutor Melanie Thernstrom _ that was critical of the
university's super-competitive environment and counselors'
unfamiliarity with students' mental health.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard administrators say almost all the suicide victims and
students afflicted with depression had problems before they ever
arrived in Cambridge. The school has 350 counselors, tutors, and
advisers ready to assist students in trouble. The problem, they
say, is that most students are not aware of the services _ or are
reluctant to seek them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Students feel a great deal of pressure here to succeed,''
acknowledges Archie C. Epps 3d, dean of students. ``We need to
overcome the perception that we are only concerned about success.''
</P>
<P>
   When studentscluding musical talent, comfortable at Davidson, he
also felt somewhat isolated from the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was told in my interview that if I was looking for a close
experience with faculty I should apply to Princeton. That was the
tradeoff. But I came in expecting that I would have to build my own
experience, so I wasn't disappointed. I realize that I'm my own
little world.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You can feel very alienated in a large class, but I have a
class with 100 people that is very good. Not all profs put the same
emphasis on teaching.''

SCIENTISTS GIVE `DEEP IMPACT' LOTS OF THUMBS-UP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TIM MADIGAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Forget Siskel and Ebert. The movie ``Deep Impact'' is earning
strong reviews from critics of an altogether different sort:
scientists working to ferret out deadly asteroids and comets that
might be headed toward Earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Zowie! We finally have a reasonable depiction of the
concern,'' planetary scientist Eleanor Helin says.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a movie it was pretty good, and as a piece of science it
was pretty good, too,'' says Clark Chapman, another prominent
astronomer. ``Scientists are critical people, but here they have
made a serious attempt to try and get it right. They didn't always
succeed, but it's roughly right in a lot of respects.''
</P>
<P>
   Which might be good news for ``Deep Impact,'' but bad news for
civilization as we know it. The movie chronicles the attempts of
earthlings to deal with a massive comet racing toward a collision
with our planet. Suffice it to say that they are not completely
successful. A large piece of comet lands just off the Atlantic
coast and spawns a tidal wave 100 yards high. Moviegoers observe as
New York City and Washington, D.C., are quite believably
obliterated.
</P>
<P>
   Thus goes the latest in a spate of celestial disaster dramatics.
In last year's ``Asteroid'' TV miniseries, Dallas got creamed.
Coming soon is ``Armaggedon,'' in which space hero Bruce Willis is
dispatched to save the world by taking on an asteroid the size of
Texas. (Scientists roll their eyes at this.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Deep Impact'' they say, is easily the best of the lot. What
happens in the movie could happen in real life. That and worse.
It's not likely any moment soon, perhaps, but planetary experts say
the risk posed by asteroids and comets justifies far more concern
than is currently exhibited by politicians and the general public.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, the threat is real,'' says Jack Hills, an
asteroid specialist with Los Alamos National Laboratory in New
Mexico. ``It doesn't happen very often, which is fortunate in one
respect. But in many ways it's unfortunate, because we won't do
anything before the next one comes.''
</P>
<P>
   And the consequences of such inaction should a huge piece of
space junk be headed our way?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're toast,'' Hills says.
</P>
<P>
   AN UNIMAGINABLE DEATH TOLL
</P>
<P>
   Astronomers have charted 120 asteroids more than a kilometer in
diameter whose orbits intersect with Earth, and the number grows
almost monthly. So far, calculations show that none poses a real
threat. But scientists estimate that 2,000 space rocks of that size
(the terms ``asteroid'' and ``meteor'' are essentially
interchangeable) zip about the solar system, most of them as yet
unseen.
</P>
<P>
   Should one that size strike land, dust and vapors thrust into
the stratosphere by the impact would plunge Earth into darkness for
months, killing off much plant and animal life. The human species
probably would not be entirely lost, but the death toll would be
unimaginable.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a huge celestial object slamming into the Atlantic
Ocean would produce ``a tsunami that goes all the way up to the
Appalachian Mountains in the upper two-thirds of the United
States,'' Hills says. ``In Europe, the coast of the Iberian
peninsula, Spain and Portugal, is basically wiped out, and the
(seacoast) of France. So it's quite severe.''
</P>
<P>
   Scientists put the odds of such a catastrophe happening this
year at about 1 in 300,000, considerably greater than those for
drawing a royal flush in poker (1 in 649,000). Odds for a lesser
but still disastrous collision are much greater, they say.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably about 1 in 3,000 or 1 in 5,000,'' Hills says.
``That is, something large enough to devastate many kilometers of
coastline. It would certainly be devastating regionally.''
</P>
<P>
   So it is a mistake to dismiss ``Deep Impact'' as science
fiction, as many have done. Science, yes. Fiction, no. MORE &QL;

 UNDATED: ... of performance.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``It's a snare and a delusion,'' Rudenstine says. ``If you don't
want a bitter person on your hands, sooner or later you're going to
make them a professor even if you've made a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   But sticking to its principles puts Harvard at a competitive
disadvantage. Some of its best junior faculty leave for tenured
positions elsewhere years before they would come up for tenure at
Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real issue is that Harvard does not tenure at the
associate professor level,'' Ulrich says. ``Everyone else does. So
people who would fully qualify for tenure at any other university
in the US are forced to compete for a full professorship with a
kind of star system.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Harvard historian emeritus David Donald: ``If you have a
young person coming along who you would really like to keep, who
will reshape the field, but has only published a PhD thesis,
somebody else will steal him off.''
</P>
<P>
   Although competitors such as Stanford have elevated the
importance of teaching in tenure verdicts, Harvard adheres to the
aphorism, ``Publish or perish.'' Officials contend that the
judgment of a candidate's peers is more meaningful than that of
easily-impressed undergraduates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without the scholarship, you're just not going to remain a
part of the community,'' Rudenstine says. ``It's miserable for
someone who's totally outclassed in his department to be going
around knowing they're not a major scholar and almost everyone else
is. You can be a good teacher at the undergraduate level, but when
you move to the graduate level or faculty colloquia, you either
have it or you don't, and it's very obvious right away.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Competition is fierce for world's best minds &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Harvard faculty of the future takes shape every Wednesday
morning in a conference room in University Hall. Under a portrait
of architect Charles Bulfinch, Knowles and his staff take stock of
their courtships of the world's best minds.
</P>
<P>
   In an era of two-career couples, they realize that recruiting
isn't as simple as it used to be. Have they helped find a job for
one scholar's spouse, a school for a second's children, a
low-interest mortgage for a third? Are they offering enough lab
space to a scientist, enough graduate students to a humanist?
</P>
<P>
   Such perks only sweeten what is still one of the most desirable
jobs in academia. According to Knowles, nearly 70 percent of
Harvard job offers are accepted. Tenured Harvard professors enjoy
brilliant colleagues and students, vast libraries, six-figure
salaries supplemented by consulting work, a bully pulpit on talk
shows, op-ed pages, and Congressional committees, and near-total
job security. They may be fired only for ``grave misconduct or
neglect of duty.'' No wonder Harvard professors rarely quit, not
even economist Robert Barro, who wavered this spring before
rejecting a lucrative offer from Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing more important than drawing here the very best
faculty we can identify,'' Knowles says.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, junior faculty at Harvard earn half as much as
senior colleagues and live on borrowed time. The winnowing starts
after four years, when assistant professors may be promoted to
associate _ or not. If promoted, they receive a letter from the
department assessing their tenure prospects. A negative letter is a
signal to start job-hunting.
</P>
<P>
   But if an associate professor has written a prize-winning book
or two, he or she may be considered for tenure in three years. The
ordeal starts with a unique Harvard ritual _ blind letters, which
ask outside experts to assess six or more scholars in a given
field. They are called blind because they don't identify which
scholar Harvard is interested in hiring.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1990 amicus curiae brief to the US Supreme Court defending
the confidentiality of tenure, Harvard offered a rare glimpse into
the blind-letter process. ``The conscientious evaluator must be
specific, searching, and blunt in his or her appraisals,'' Harvard
wrote. ``He or she must have the intellectual honesty to say that
Professor A is no longer doing prime research, or that Assistant
Professor B's work is largely derivative of others in the field, or
that Professor C, although pursuing innovative concepts, has been
erratic, and that only Professor D, though not widely known, has
the creativity, discipline, and potential that characterizes a
truly innovative and influential thinker at the threshold of a
distinguished career.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the ideal. But in reality, critics say, the outside
experts are often unfamiliar with little-known, brilliant Professor
D from the junior faculty, and instead opt for the older,
established professors A, B and C.
</P>
<P>
   More and more, Harvard faculty regard blind letters as an
anachronism. Starting next year, letters from the economics
department will name its candidate. ``Blind letters are silly,''
says Jeffrey Williamson, the economics chairman. ``The rumor mill
works so fast that Berkeley knows in a few minutes who we're
interested in.''
</P>
<P>
   After reading the evaluations, the department's tenured faculty
vote at a meeting closed to junior faculty. The candidate needs a
favorable consensus; any substantial opposition spells doom.
</P>
<P>
   If the candidate prevails, the department forwards the name to
Knowles, who presides over another Harvard wrinkle. Each tenured
member of the department must write a confidential letter about the
candidate to the dean. It's an invitation to frank evaluation _ or
backstabbing.
</P>
<P>
   The dean may deny tenure. More often, he proceeds, selecting a
committee of three outside experts and two Harvard professors in
related departments. The ad hoc committee, a Harvard innovation
dating back more than half a century, gives the president veto
power over appointments to stop departments from becoming cliques
for friends and proteges.
</P>
<P>
   Chaired by Rudenstine, who has read each candidate's file at
least twice, the committee gathers in Massachusetts Hall. Over a
morning, it typically hears testimony from four people: the
candidate's chairman, two supporters, and an opponent. The
committee caucuses over lunch at the Faculty Club before leaving
Rudenstine to ponder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll read the file again afterward if I feel I need to do any
further checking,'' Rudenstine says. ``I'll make some phone calls
or whatever. Just to make sure my instincts are right. And then
I'll decide the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the past five years, Rudenstine has rejected 15 percent of
candidates considered by ad hoc committees. He doesn't have to
follow the committee's recommendation; indeed, Bonnie Honig
reportedly was reportedly favored, 4-1.
</P>
<P>
   Although outside candidates are supposed to jump through the
same hoops as in-house candidates, the system sometimes bends for
them. Rudenstine waived the ad hoc committee for an organic chemist
Harvard wooed from the California Institute of Technology in April.
</P>
<P>
   Rejected applicants are rarely given a reason. Limerick learned
that she would not be promoted when she walked into the otherwise
sparse office of the history chairman and saw three words written
on a legal pad: ``No on Limerick.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   When Ellen Fitzpatrick, a well-regarded scholar and teacher of
modern US history, was denied tenure by Harvard University last
November, it extended a streak unparalleled in academia.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1959, when Dwight Eisenhower was president and Fidel
Castro assumed control over Cuba, Harvard has not tenured any
junior faculty members in US history, rejecting such standouts as
Alan Brinkley, a National Book Award winner, and Patricia Limerick,
recipient of a MacArthur ``genius'' grant. Once one of Harvard's
signature strengths, US history has become its version of the
Shaker religion, which died out because it forbade having children.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's vital to change the perception out there that coming to
Harvard as a junior faculty member is a dead end,'' says Harvard
historian Laurel Ulrich. ``Creating a more flexible tenure system
is the wave of the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Harvard's reputation for excellence rests largely on the
quality of its faculty, administrators regard the granting of
tenure, or lifetime appointment, as their most important decision.
To prevent mediocrities from sullying its ranks, Harvard has
established the nation's strictest tenure process. At a time when
other universities are rethinking tenure, or placing teaching on a
par with research, Harvard clings to a trial-by-fire system that
anoints a select group of scholar-kings, and consigns everyone else
to also-ran status.
</P>
<P>
   Yet its decline in US history offers a stark example of the
price Harvard sometimes pays for its lofty standards: poor morale
and intellectual stagnation. US history, a specialty within the
history department, is one of several fields suffering from what
Henry Rosovsky, the former dean of arts and sciences, has called
the ``classic pathology'' of being unable to find anyone worthy of
joining its ranks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time for Harvard to reconsider its tenure process,'' says
Harvard Law Professor Charles Nesson. ``We've had a long history of
embarrassment with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, Harvard has farmed out junior faculty _ untenured
assistant and associate professors _ to other schools, confident
that it can hire them back if they set the world on fire. Like a
wealthy baseball team, it recruits expensive free agents instead of
promoting promising minor leaguers.
</P>
<P>
   The risks of this approach are familiar to sports fans: internal
dissension, bidding wars, and an aging roster past its prime. And
because federal law has abolished mandatory retirement, the
``extinct volcanoes,'' as one Harvard official privately calls
them, can stay as long as they want, denying slots to talented
newcomers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tenure plus no retirement age presents big problems,''
Rosovsky says. ``Older people are inevitably very influential. I'd
like to see people gain more of a voice at a younger age.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, many junior faculty, including some Harvard would like
to retain, are so intimidated that they give up and leave early.
Even as Fitzpatrick appointment was being torpedoed last year, two
other associate professors in US history left for tenured jobs
elsewhere rather than run the tenure gantlet at Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   Being a junior faculty member at Harvard, recalls Limerick, now
at the University of Colorado, ``was a little like being a
terminally ill child. People were very nice to me since I wasn't
going to be around very long.''
</P>
<P>
   Under President Neil Rudenstine, prospects for junior faculty
have brightened somewhat, particularly for women and minorities. Of
111 junior faculty hired from 1987-1990, the most recent group to
be considered for tenure, about one in five survived the long
march, compared to one in 10 for earlier colleagues, according to
Harvard statistics. Thirty-eight percent of the 406 tenured
instructors in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences were appointed from
within _ still far less than competitors such as Princeton (50
percent) and Columbia (60 percent).
</P>
<P>
   This progress doesn't impress the casualties _ or their
supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Rudenstine stirred up the campus by rejecting two
junior faculty in the government department, Bonnie Honig and Peter
Berkowitz. Fifteen women faculty signed a letter supporting Honig,
now tenured at Northwestern University. Nesson flouted Harvard's
policy of confidentiality by publishing Berkowitz's tenure
documents on the World Wide Web. Nesson also invited private
detective Terry Lenzner to investigate whether Harvard had violated
its own tenure rules.
</P>
<P>
   Rudenstine, who left Harvard as an assistant professor in 1968
for a tenured position at Princeton, now spends 25 18-hour days a
year judging tenure cases _ much more time than the average
university president spends on the issue. ``If there is a doubt, it
is better to resolve the doubt in terms of not promoting than
promoting,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you find yourself looking for reasons for tenure, then you
have to stop and say, `Wait a minute, we're supposed to be over the
bar, not creating a ladder to climb up and over.' I don't want to
sound negative, but if that is not the standard, then you're not
going to have the Harvard faculty.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Not all appointments are treated equally &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The tenure process at Harvard is as decentralized as other
administrative functions. The powerful schools of law, business,
and medicine choose faculty with little presidential scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   Yet all appointments are supposed to meet Harvard's tenure
standard, the most rigorous in American education. Tenured
appointments are made ``only if the candidate is among, or shows
promise of joining, the very best scholars in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The selection process of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences,
Harvard's largest school, is designed to fulfill this boast. ``If
no one is ever turned down, there's no point in having a process,''
says Jeremy Knowles, the dean of arts and sciences.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike competitors such as Stanford, Harvard has no tenure track
that assures junior faculty will be considered. ``There's never any
guarantees,'' says Theda Skocpol, professor of government and
sociology, who was denied tenure in 1980 but filed a successful sex
discrimination grievance. ``There's a million stages where you can
lose your tenure fight right up to the end. This system is more
likely to make the mistake of not appointing an excellent person
than of appointing a second-rate person. The sins are of
omission.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvard is virtually the only major university in America that
never gives tenure to associate professors _ the middle rung on the
academic ladder of assistant, associate, and full professorships.
</P>
<P>
   Other universities do award lifetime jobs to associate
professors, while still dangling promotion to full professorship as
an incentive. Harvard used to. As an associate professor, Ernest
May was the last junior faculty member tenured in US history in
1959. But Harvard stopped giving tenure to associate professors in
1968 because it found that departments would eventually promote
them regardless of performance.

CANCER SURVIVOR CRUSADES TRIES TO WARN SUN GODS AND GODDESSES 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ When a doctor diagnosed Harry Livingston with a
type of skin cancer known as melanoma three years ago, the New York
man figured it might be a death sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told my doctor, when the odds are a million to one, I'll be
the one,'' Livingston said.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston is lucky. His cancer was detected early, when the
chance of survival is as high as 95 percent. The key is early
detection. This year, about 7,300 Americans will die from melanoma,
which left untreated can spread.
</P>
<P>
   Melanoma is a growing problem. Since 1973, the incidence of
melanoma has increased 4 percent each year, with white people at
greatest risk.
</P>
<P>
   At this time of year, with warm temperatures and sunny skies,
Livingston, who celebrated his 64th birthday Tuesday, encourages
people to take heed.
</P>
<P>
   While working at Victory Lane Speedway in his hometown of
Schodack, N.Y., he proselytizes for sunscreen and hats while
helping customers into their Go-Karts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see these young girls come in and you can tell they're sun
worshipers. I try not to become a fanatic and scare them away.''
Instead, this born-again cancer survivor hands out pamphlets and
shows off a scar on his back. ``It looks like two craters on the
moon because the skin grafts fell off.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors also are busy this time of year getting out the message
that skin cancer kills. Many are trying to counter a recent study
that questioned the effectiveness of sunscreens.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of skin type, they suggest using a sunscreen with a
sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 15.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell Singer, a dermatologist in Schenectady, N.Y.,
recommends a facial sunscreen with moisturizer ``and wear it on
your face and arms from Memorial Day to Labor Day.''
</P>
<P>
   Research shows we get up to 80 percent of our lifetime sun
exposure before we turn 18, so Dr. Singer is adamant about
discouraging teen-agers from basking by pools or in tanning salons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I scare the hell out of them. I show them somebody with half
their face missing,'' Singer said.
</P>
<P>
   Today, protecting yourself from the sun has never been easier.
Besides sunscreens and sun blocks, there is a new line of
protective clothing approved by the Food and Drug Administration
and manufactured by Sun Precautions in Everett, Wash. For
information, call 800-882-7860.
</P>
<P>
   Those most at risk for melanoma include anyone who has had a
blistering sunburn, a family history of the disease, more than 20
moles or an outdoor occupation.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston isn't taking any chances. Since his wife first
spotted the cancerous moles on his back, he examines himself
frequently for any skin changes. Two years ago, he spotted a woman
in a sleeveless shirt with a growth on her shoulder. He encouraged
her to see a doctor, who diagnosed cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``She comes in and gives me a hug and a kiss, she tells people,
`I do this to Harry because he saved my life.'''
</P>
<P>
   Livingston blames his malignant melanoma on too much surfing in
Baja California as a teen-ager. While he wears sun blocks, hats and
protective clothing, he isn't giving up on summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``In life, you've got to have some pleasure without killing
yourself doing it,'' he said.

 UNDATED: ... Moscow operation.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shleifer and Hay were dismissed from their HIID jobs and the
Moscow office was shut down after USAID canceled the final $14
million of its contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Russia thing was a big deal for us,'' says HIID head
Sachs, an economist intimately involved in Russian economic reform.
``Russia was damaging to HIID's name because it was a high-profile
event. It caused us all to take a breath.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, HIID was being criticized by human rights
advocates because one of its program officers, former Massachusetts
Representative Thomas Vallely, was working on a UN project in Burma
at a time when the free-Burma lobby wanted to further isolate the
military regime in Rangoon. Vallely, an outspoken advocate of
``constructive engagement'' with Burma, was already running a
successful program in Vietnam. He acknowledges he wanted to ``grow
the Vietnam program'' by extending it to Burma.
</P>
<P>
   But Burma is very different from Vietnam, say human rights
activists. In 1990, Burmese generals refused to yield power to
triumphant democratic forces led by Nobel laureate Aung San Suu
Kyi. Burmese peasants are subjected to forced labor. The Harvard
name attached to projects in Burma would legitimize the regime,
which takes any sign of cooperation as endorsement of its
oppressive rule.
</P>
<P>
   Vallely was attacked by free-Burma advocates after he publicly
called Suu Kyi's position on sanctions ``wrong'' and spoke
supportively of the ruling junta. Back at HIID, staff members moved
to bar Vallely from operating in Burma under HIID auspices. Last
year, after what one official called ``a shootout at the O.K.
Corral,'' all HIID work on Burma was transferred to economist
Robert Rotberg.
</P>
<P>
   ``HIID will not work with the present government of Burma in any
way, shape and form,'' says Rotberg.
</P>
<P>
   Maureen Aung-Thwin, director of the Burma Project for the Open
Society Institute, a New York-based human rights group that was
critical of Vallely, says ``HIID is wise not to go into Burma under
the present conditions. Being involved in the country now would
tarnish its image while burnishing the junta's.''
</P>
<P>
   Vallely and colleague David Dapice are still involved in Burma,
but say they are working on their own time for the UN Development
Agency. Though Dapice and Vallely have offices side-by-side at
HIID's Mt. Auburn Street office, a recent report they produced on
Burma was published on Tufts University letterhead, where Dapice is
a professor of economics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I put my foot in the water with Burma,'' says Vallely. ``The
water was (expletive) cold, OK? It hurt me so that I don't want to
put my foot in the water again.''  &QL; 
 &QL; 
Agency has its wings clipped &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There are rarely real casualties in academic warfare _ not by
the standards of broader society, where disputes can cost real jobs
and real lives. Shleifer remains a tenured professor at Harvard. He
is back from Moscow, has an office in the Littauer Building and is
teaching economics. And though Vallely got burned on Burma, he is
still running a widely praised program in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   But HIID has had its wings clipped. Harvey Fineberg, the Harvard
provost to whom HIID reports, acknowledges that university
officials had been ``concerned about'' HIID for some time. Though
he and other university officials characterize what has happened
with HIID as coincidence, insiders see it differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a hostile takeover,'' says Vallely.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, Nye, the Kennedy School dean, told Harvard's top
administrators that he had an unnamed donor who wanted to give him
the money to purchase HIID headquarters for the Kennedy School next
door. One Eliot Place was owned by the central administration, not
HIID, and in Harvard's arcane ``every tub on its own bottom''
system, the Kennedy School was forced to buy the building from the
administration.
</P>
<P>
   Nye borrowed against the donor's promise and bought the building
for an undisclosed amount. Sachs and other HIID people could remain
on the top three floors, but not as HIID. They would be part of a
new operation called the Center for International Development.
Sachs, who will head the center, calls it a joint venture between
HIID and the Kennedy School. HIID is contributing $10 million _
half its reserves _ to endow the center, a significant amount for
an institute that operates without an endowment.
</P>
<P>
   The center will be ``within the Kennedy School,'' says Nye, who
will be the Harvard officer in charge. The tie to the Kennedy
School will make the center ``woven more into the academic fabric''
of Harvard than HIID has been, says Fineberg.
</P>
<P>
   Nye's squeeze play on HIID shows how ascendent the Kennedy
School is at Harvard. The university has an archipelago of
world-class foreign affairs operations _ the Fairbank Center for
Asian Research, the Davis Center for Russian Studies, the
Weatherhead Center for International Affairs, the Gunzberg Center
for European Studies, the David Rockefeller Center for Latin
American Studies. But the rising power in foreign affairs is
clearly the Kennedy School.
</P>
<P>
   Long associated with domestic policy _ temporary home to
out-of-work politicians ranging from former Massachusetts governor
Michael S. Dukakis to former Wyoming senator Alan Simpson _ the
Kennedy School has been pushing aggressively into the international
arena under the leadership of the even-tempered Nye, a former
assistant secretary of defense.
</P>
<P>
   Nye has long been world-minded. In 1990, when he was associate
dean in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Nye wrote an influential
report for former president Derek Bok on how Harvard should
internationalize itself. Though the Kennedy School already had
groups conducting international security studies, as dean Nye has
moved much further in an international direction and is now
``showcasing the international component'' says Kay King, director
of the Association of Professional Schools of International
Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-six percent of the student body is now international, up
from 28 percent five years ago. Fifty percent of the cases written
for the school's case-study program now deal with international
issues or have international protagonists. Since Kennedy School
cases are used at more than 500 other colleges and universities
around the world, the new international push is significant.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the visiting programs for Russian and Chinese ruling
elites _ a program unmatched in American higher education _ and
assorted fellowships for mid-career bureaucrats from areas as far
afield as Upper Volta, the Kennedy School has usurped the role of
Radcliffe, Harvard's sister college, by developing two
internationally oriented programs involving women in public policy.
</P>
<P>
   Paula Rayman, director of Radcliffe's public policy institute,
says there is plenty of room in women's issues for both schools.
Within Radcliffe, however, there is concern that the Kennedy
School's move into women's policy issues has crowded Radcliffe at a
time when Radcliffe is searching for a new mission.
</P>
<P>
   In May, the Kennedy School held a summit of eight women world
leaders, including former Pakistani prime minister Benazir Bhutto,
former Turkish prime minister Tansu Ciller, former Polish prime
minister Hanna Suchocka, and former Nicaraguan president Violeta de
Chamorro. And Swanee Hunt, former US ambassador to Austria, is
running a program on women and public policy that focuses on women
at lower tiers of government.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be the place that trains women for leadership
positions around the world,'' says Nye.
</P>
<P>
   Nye's strategy has been to broaden the scope of his school _
moving it from its traditional liberal Democratic base and
decreasing its domestic-policy focus while boosting academic
courses that emphasize the private sector and non-profit
organizations. These are elements of the ``soft power'' _ economic
and cultural influence as opposed to military muscle _ that he
believes the United States must learn to wield in the post-Cold War
world.
</P>
<P>
   Nye recognizes that there will be controversy along the way, but
says that is the price of global clout. Not many of those Saudi,
Nigerian, Chinese, and Burmese officials who come into contact with
Harvard, for instance, will leave as Jeffersonian democrats, but
their exposure to Western ideas is beneficial, he says. The
powerful and corrupt need to understand democracy and human rights
at least as much as the good and the just do.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is always a risk that somebody you have is not going to
be perfect, but what is the alternative?'' Nye asks. ``If you
insist on clean hands you are not going to get anything done.''

FIRE ANTS TO BLAME FOR 23,000 DEAD TROUT IN GUADALUPE RIVER 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By THADDEUS HERRICK 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ They have killed birds, toads, rats _ even fawns.
They have obliterated native ant populations. And, of course, they
have caused endless frustration _ and much pain _ to folks across
Texas and the South.
</P>
<P>
   Now the venom of the dreaded ``Solenopsis invicta,'' otherwise
known as the fire ant, has claimed another victim: the rainbow
trout.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department say winged
fire ants that landed in the Guadalupe River following an airborne
mating ritual are to blame for the death of at least 23,000 trout
just north of New Braunfels.
</P>
<P>
   The kill occurred late last week along a well-stocked, 15-mile
stretch of the river that provides the state's only year-round
trophy trout fishing, a spot known to anglers for cool water, deep
pools and not a few keepers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a blow to our trout program,'' said Steve Magnelia, a
fisheries biologist for the parks and wildlife department.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say the ravenous fish gobbled up the venomous ants as
they fell in the water, in some cases consuming as many as 500 of
the dreaded insects. Though some trout were more than a foot long,
the majority of the dead fish were 3 inches to 5 inches and had
been released only within the last 60 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know their stomachs were packed with fire ants,'' said
Magnelia. ``There was nothing wrong with the water quality.''
</P>
<P>
   Though parks and wildlife officials cannot recall a fire-ant
fish kill of this magnitude, they say the incident is not the
first. The same thing has happened annually along the Guadalupe
since 1994, officials said, always triggered by a spring or summer
rain storm that sends the winged ants into the air.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the ants may be to blame for fish kills that date even
farther back, though state officials paid little attention before
the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Once airborne, the thousands of mating ants are attracted to
shiny surfaces, which is why they end up in swimming pools, pick-up
trucks and trout streams. Parks and wildlife officials found a
number of dead frogs and sunfish along the Guadalupe, also victims
of the ants.
</P>
<P>
   The reddish-brown ants, which make their homes in large mounds
and are known to sting when disturbed, are believed to have been
mistakenly imported to the United States from South America in the
1930s in ships carrying earth to stabilize their loads.
</P>
<P>
   Fire ants are quarantined in at least nine states. The scourge
of animal and plant life, their attraction to electricity has also
led them to chew through insulation, triggering blackouts and
fires.
</P>
<P>
   The trout that swim the Guadalupe apparently made easy victims
because of their tendency to snap up anything that floats on the
water's surface.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the fire ants actually stung the fish internally is a
matter of debate. Bart Drees, an entomologist who heads the Texas
A&AMP;M Imported Fire Ant Research and Management Plan, theorized that
the females (the only gender capable of stinging) had done just
that killing the fish.
</P>
<P>
   Parks and wildlife officials, on the other hand, were operating
on the assumption that the fire ants were dead when they were
consumed and that the fish succumbed to the insects' toxicity.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the state agency's divers found piles of trout
lodged behind boulders at the bottom of pools of 4 to 5 feet of
water. Because trout have small air bladders, they tend to fall to
the bottom instead of floating when they die. Still, the scene
along the Guadalupe was plenty grim.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty-three thousand fish is a sizable kill,'' said Jack
Ralph, a member of the parks and wildlife team that investigates
``kills and spills.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't compare to the 21 million that went down in the red
tide, but it's sizable.''
</P>
<P>
   State parks officials had recently finished stocking the
Guadalupe near New Braunfels with about 250,000 3- to 5-inch trout,
of which they expect to lose at least 10 percent with the latest
kill.
</P>
<P>
   The area below Canyon Lake is the only stretch of Texas river
that stays cool enough to provide trout fishing year round. Its
trophy trout designation, meaning anglers stand a good chance of
catching a big fish, attracts fly fishermen from around the state.

 UNDATED: ... of government.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Executive education programs are short, intensive courses _
usually lasting two to nine weeks _ taught by Harvard faculty using
the case-study method and capped with the ceremonial presentation
of a Harvard certificate. A few weeks of attending Harvard seminars
is all it takes to make a military officer in Ukraine or a deputy
finance minister in Malaysia into a ``Harvard product.'' Executive
programs have helped the university forge extensive ties with
ruling elites around the world, especially in Russia and China.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our stakes in those two systems are so great that we will do
anything to get a front-line conversation with key people,'' says
Peter Zimmerman, who runs executive education programs for 2,200
people a year at the Kennedy School.
</P>
<P>
   In the past six years, virtually all senior Russian military
officers have become Harvard products, says Galvin, who has
participated in the program and taken the Russians on daylong tours
of Wakefield, the suburb north of Boston billed as an average
American community. In the past year, more than 100 senior Chinese
civil servants _ including several dozen colonels and intelligence
officers _ have gone through a similar program funded by Hong Kong
businesswoman Nina Kung.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harvard's name is obviously a major asset to us because of its
prestige abroad,'' says Robert D. Blackwill, who runs the Russia
and China programs for the Kennedy School. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Scholars program came at the `perfect time' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was in May of 1996 that Kung, a petite woman who wears her
hair in pigtails, arrived unbidden in Harvard Yard with what
Blackwill describes as ``an idea about Harvard helping interaction
between American and Chinese elites.'' Rudenstine's office
immediately referred her to Joseph S. Nye, dean of the Kennedy
School. Kung walked over to the Kennedy School and laid out her
plan.
</P>
<P>
   With $3.3 billion in assets, Kung is one of the richest women in
the world. She has close ties to Beijing and at high levels in
Washington, having met Clinton in the White House and breakfasted
with the First Lady. She also has become mixed up in the Clinton
campaign fundraising imbroglio.Republicans in Congress questioned a
$50,000 donation she made to Clinton's birthplace foundation in
Hope, Ark.
</P>
<P>
   With Kung contributing $7 million, a Kung scholars program
quickly took shape at the Kennedy School and won ``startlingly
rapid'' approval from top brass of the People's Liberation Army,
says Blackwill. By January 1997 the first Chinese were arriving in
Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not dealing with twentysomethings here. These are
senior Chinese military officers and civil servants,'' says
Blackwill. ``They are very serious people. They do nothing
casually.''
</P>
<P>
   The program came along at what Blackwill says was ``the perfect
time'' _ after the 1996 Taiwan missile crisis, a time of US-China
brinksmanship that caused military and political leaders in both
nations to look urgently for ways to improve relations. It is now
the largest program of academic interaction with Chinese elites in
the world. It is not without critics, however, among them
professors and students who question whether it makes sense for
Harvard to accommodate Chinese military and intelligence
operatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the Russian generals are Neanderthals, but it is
probably a good thing for them to have the experience. I think the
China program is subject to more questions,'' says Marshall
Goldman, associate director of Harvard's Davis Center for Russia
Studies. ``Almost all the Chinese are intelligence people.''
</P>
<P>
   When students at the Kennedy School tried to organize a protest
resolution over Jiang's visit last fall, they ran into stiff
resistance from Kung scholars and other Chinese government
officials in residence at the school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find it hard to believe that those Chinese scholars all
acted all on their own,'' says Naheed Nenshi, a Canadian masters
student at the school who was caught up in the debate. ``We all saw
the e-mails from Chinese agents saying `Come out, there will be
flags and lunch.' I'm sure this was organized.''
</P>
<P>
   And when Nenshi and other students later invited Chinese
dissident Wei Jengsheng to speak at the school, they ran into more
opposition _ this time from administrators. A Kennedy School
faculty member, Nenshi says, told him the school did not want to be
seen ``taking the side of dissidents.'' After students threatened
to make that comment public, the school relented.
</P>
<P>
   When Wei spoke on May 6, he praised the anti-Jiang protests at
Harvard for helping put pressure on Beijing to lighten up on
political prisoners. He criticized Americans who, in their zeal to
win friends in Beijing, ``lack a sense of urgency'' about human
rights. Wei pointed out that in China, where he was still
imprisoned until last November, only ``the welcoming part'' of the
Jiang visit to Cambridge played on Chinese TV _ a point not lost on
other dissidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be nice to think that exposing Chinese officials to
the western system will change them forever,'' says Lobsang Sangay,
a Harvard law student who is active in the free-Tibet movement.
``But I fear they learn the jargon of human rights and use it
against human rights.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Think tank is victim of `hostile takeover' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   They could also learn from Harvard about academic infighting.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, Harvard maintenance workers will set up ladders in
the lobby of One Eliot Place, which opens onto the courtyard of the
Kennedy School complex, and begin scraping the letters HIID off the
portal. One Eliot is now owned by the Kennedy School. Workers at
the Harvard Institute for International Development will be
scattered around Harvard Square _ above Tweeter Etc. on Mt. Auburn
Street, in the old Architects Collaborative building on Story
Street.
</P>
<P>
   HIID's headquarters was lost in what insiders describe as a
``hostile takeover'' engineered by Nye, dean of the Kennedy School,
on behalf of an administration worried about the loosely supervised
activities of the influential think tank.
</P>
<P>
   Former HIID director Dwight Perkins, who ran the institute for
15 years, is more circumspect. He talks of ``a compromise between
taking over and having an informal relationship'' with the Kennedy
School. Whatever the case, HIID real estate, money, and key
personnel are now under Nye's umbrella. HIID will remain in Harvard
Square, but in a much less visible form.
</P>
<P>
   HIID is an odd duck, even at a school that prides itself on its
autonomous ``tubs.'' It is, in effect, a global consulting service
operated by Harvard since the 1960s. Harvard faculty _ mostly
economists and social scientists _ work for HIID, which
subcontracts with organizations such as the US Agency for
International Development, the World Bank, and the United Nations.
The institute runs projects in 60 countries _ from a feasibility
study for a 25-mile bridge in Argentina to a reform plan for the
Bank of Zambia.
</P>
<P>
   The institute has 55 resident advisers in the field and sends
200 consultants abroad a year. Some are straight from Harvard Yard,
others rarely see Cambridge. Most of HIID's work earns high praise.
But in such a far-flung operation, something occasionally goes
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, things went horribly wrong in Russia, where HIID had
been managing a $57 million USAID project on economic reform.
Following an audit, the agency accused the two main HIID officers
in Moscow _ Harvard economics professor Andrei Shleifer and legal
expert Jonathan Hay _ of letting their staff provide services for
investment projects run by Shleifer's wife and Hay's girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   USAID alleged that Shleifer and Hay had ``gained influence''
over the Russian capital markets that they were helping to set up
and had sought ``personal gain.'' Neither would comment for this
article, but the scandal revealed a wide circle of loosely
monitored operations in Moscow operating with tenuous Harvard
affiliations and tied to a clan-like power structure run by former
deputy prime minister Anatoly Chubais, a leading Russian reformer.
</P>
<P>
   Along with a Russian counterpart, Hay had ``ultimate control
over the entire privatization effort in Russia,'' Veniamin Sokolov,
head of the Russian government's auditing agency, the chamber of
accounts, said last week in an interview with the Globe. ``This
route to privatization led to a disaster for Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   And it was the Harvard name that opened doors for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here were people saying they were connected with Harvard. In
this part of the world, that put stars in people's eyes,'' says
Janine Wedel, a research professor at George Washington University
who raised early questions about the HIID Moscow operation.

RESCUING OUT-OF-PRINT BOOKS, INTERNET ADDICTION, HIGH-TECH GIRLS

 A High-Tech Rescue For Out-of-Print Books 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ At the Book Expo America show in Chicago this week,
the most popular attraction by far was a new technology for
on-demand book printing. Print Lightning, a division of the book
wholesaler Ingram, hauled its entire operation to Chicago to
demonstrate the new process, which uses state-of-the-art IBM
printing equipment and software.
</P>
<P>
   When a title goes out of print or demand for a book falls so low
that publishers hesitate to reprint it, in steps Lightning. ``Books
really never have to go out of print again,'' said Larry Brewster,
Lightning Print's general manager. ``For $100 to $150, you set the
book up in the digital library, and books can be printed as
booksellers order them.'' A 300-page book costs about $5 to print
after the initial setup, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Once Ingram receives an order for even one book from a
bookseller, Lightning prints the book at the Ingram headquarters in
La Vergne, Tenn., and ships it to one of three major distribution
centers.
</P>
<P>
   A 300-page book takes about 30 seconds to print, and the books
are printed in no particular order. Out comes Freeman Dyson's
``Disturbing the Universe'' one minute, and ``The Collected Stories
of Phillip K. Dick'' the next.
</P>
<P>
   The books are expected to cost $15 to $20 apiece, Brewster said.
</P>
<P>
   At the book show, people were taken with the quality of the
books, especially the covers. ``Unless you were in the production
business, you'd have a very difficult time telling the difference
between these covers and offset printing,'' Brewster said.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the Lightning system prints only paperbacks, but
Brewster said the company hoped to offer hardcover editions as well
by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Lightning recently finished a pilot project with 150 titles from
three dozen U.S. publishers, like Random House and Princeton
University Press. The company plans to have 10,000 titles in its
digital library by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A New School for Girls Aims To Make High-Tech Seem Phat &LR;
</P>
<P>
   For the past three years, Kathleen Bennett, a high-tech
businesswoman in Silicon Valley and former middle school teacher,
has been on a mission to give adolescent girls a better chance at
becoming technical stars. In September, she will open the doors of
the Girls' Middle School, a private school for sixth through eighth
grade in California that will focus on math, science and
technology. Ms. Bennett said she believed that the school would be
the first of its kind in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   According to a report by the Commerce Department, men were three
times more likely to choose computer science as a field of study
than were women in 1994. Ms. Bennett believes that an all-girl
environment will give students the confidence they need to nurture
an interest in the sciences at an age when the pressure to be cute
and popular can be overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   ``Silicon Valley is engineering-driven,'' Ms. Bennett said.
``It's not OK to have paradigms where the men are the technologists
and the women do everything else because that means the men are
going to go make the technology decisions for the next
millennium.'' The school's first class, sixth grade only, will have
36 students.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bennett has raised $1 million so far and hopes to raise an
additional $7 million. At first, the school will share space with a
church in Mountain View, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bennett has still more ambitious plans, including
after-school and summer programs. ``We want to take what we learn
and reach out into our communities,'' she said. ``We're trying to
be the beginning of a place in Silicon Valley that will grow to be
a center that provides young women and girls with a positive
experience with math, science and engineering.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Can the Internet Be Addicting, Or Is the Problem Elsewhere? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The results of a small, new study cast some doubt on the notion
of Internet addiction as a psychiatric problem. The report,
presented earlier this week at the annual meeting of the American
Psychiatric Association in Toronto, suggests that people who seem
unable to curtail the number of hours they spend on the Internet
may suffer from a raft of other psychiatric disorders.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers, at the University of Cincinnati, interviewed 14
people who had spent so much time on line that they were facing
problems like broken relationships and job loss. The most striking
finding of the survey, the researchers said, were the other
psychiatric problems that turned up. Eleven of the 14 people had
been diagnosed with manic-depression.
</P>
<P>
   The study's authors said it was unclear whether the Internet
problem should be considered an addiction; a symptom of something
else, like manic-depression; a disorder caused by faulty impulse
control, similar to compulsive shopping or trichotillomania (a
compulsion to tear your hair out).
</P>
<P>
   The small number of study subjects has generated skepticism.
``Based on 14 cases, I don't know that we'd conclude much of
anything,'' said Malcolm Parks, an associate professor of speech
communication at the University of Washington. ``The question is,
could you find 14 people equally weird who didn't use the
Internet?''
 &UR; Delay of the New Intel Chip Won't Affect Consumers Much &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The manufacturing problems that have set the delivery of Intel's
next-generation chip back by at least six months mean a blow to
Intel, but for the average personal computer user, the impact of
the delay is likely to be imperceptible.
</P>
<P>
   Code-named Merced, the powerful new chip is designed primarily
for servers and work stations. It processes 64 bits of data at a
time, rather than the 32 bits handled by Intel's current crop of
microprocessors. The new chip was expected to be available late
next year, but now the company doesn't expect to deliver commercial
quantities of the chip until the middle of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   For consumers, the chip will eventually mean more sophisticated
computer games, with more realistic images and further advancements
toward virtual reality. For corporate users, the chip's
computational power will help with the manipulation of huge
databases.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts say that consumers will not see the benefits of
Merced for at least five years. ``It's a much longer ramp than
we've seen before because Merced is so different and so high end,''
said Rob Enderle, an analyst with Giga Information Group.
</P>
<P>
   Intel stockholders, on the other hand, are feeling the impact of
the announcement. Intel is already suffering from razor-thin profit
margins on low-cost chips. The popularity of PCs costing less than
$1,000 has altered the economics of the computer chip marketplace,
increasing the importance of more profitable high-end sales. Since
the announcement of the delay, and the news last week of an
imminent antitrust suit by the Federal Trade Commission against
Intel, the company's shares have fallen.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; Praise for an Ayatollah  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The Internet already has a smattering of unofficial tributes to
the revolutionary leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. Now Iran
plans its own electronic homage. On Monday, an Iranian official
said the ayatollah's 210 works in Persian and 107 of his texts,
translated into 16 languages, would be made available on the Web,
but it did not specify when.  &QL; 
 &UR; Taking Traffic's Pulse &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Seattle is a relative newcomer to traffic madness, but it's one
of the first clogged metroplexes to come up with an innovative
solution to the problem: a Weather Channel for traffic. Traffic TV,
a new University of Washington cable television channel, broadcasts
real-time, rush-hour traffic updates. The channel provides live
video footage of various traffic choke points around Seattle.

<TEXT>
<P>
   On a windswept Saturday last fall, as Cambridge streets teemed
with demonstrators, Chinese President Jiang Zemin stepped to the
podium in Sanders Theater, smiled thinly and delivered a major
foreign policy address to Harvard students, faculty, and
administrators.
</P>
<P>
   For an institution accustomed to foreign visitors and global
influence, the speech _ Jiang's only talk at an American university
_ still represented an academic coup, evidence of Harvard's
extraordinary standing in world affairs.
</P>
<P>
   In China, Harvard is the most widely known and respected
university in the world. And Harvard is equally impressed with
China. Next week, Harvard's president, Neil Rudenstine, leaves for
his second trip to China in three months. Quoting Winston
Churchill, Rudenstine speaks of a bold effort to use the university
to create ``empires of the mind'' in an ``increasingly
internationalized, competititve, and demanding new world.''
</P>
<P>
   But Harvard itself is being altered by its growing globalism, as
its president acknowledges. The university is making an
unprecedented push into international waters, opening a series of
research offices in Asia, Europe, and Latin America, hosting
top-flight Chinese and Russian military and intelligence officers
in Cambridge, advising developing nations from Kenya to Vietnam on
economic reform, and prospecting for faculty and students around
the world.
</P>
<P>
   Given the breadth of its involvement in so many different arenas
in so many countries _ plus the large number of Harvard graduates
in influential positions in Washington and abroad _ the university
is now functioning as a seedbed for the global leadership class.
</P>
<P>
   But at times, internationalism has blown up in Harvard's face.
Critics say Harvard faculty members have become too cozy with
oppressive regimes such as China and Burma and too easily corrupted
in graft-filled societies like Russia, where last year the Moscow
office of the $40-million-a-year Harvard Institute for
International Development was embroiled in scandal.
</P>
<P>
   And documents obtained by the Globe show that around 1994, the
Faculty of Arts and Sciences received $1 million from Nigeria, a
military dictatorship, as part of a ``nucleus fund'' for the
current fund-raising campaign. Harvard officials said they were
unaware of the gift.
</P>
<P>
   But such is the give and take of an international university,
says Rudenstine: ``The reality is the world infringing on the
university and the university trying to study the reality of the
world. It's there. It's crucial.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also controversial. Students last fall howled when Harvard
made concessions to Jiang that it would never be make for an
American politician. Faculty members critical of China's human
rights record say they were excluded from the event. Whether they
were or not, bad feelings clearly remain among the many faculty
members involved in east-Asian affairs.
</P>
<P>
   For the question-and-answer session at the end of Jiang's
speech, Harvard officials replaced the open microphone _ a
tradition at a university where students and faculty are expected
to challenge those in authority _ with prescreened questions
delivered by polite faculty members led by Ezra Vogel of Harvard's
Fairbank Center for Asian Research.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vogel gave in on various Beijing demands and ended up with a
format like Jiang gets in China,'' says Ross Terrill, a China
scholar long associated with the Fairbank Center and currently
teaching at the University of Texas at Austin. ``The Harvard visit
cost tens of thousands of dollars to please Jiang Zemin, but as an
intellectual occasion it was utterly banal.''
</P>
<P>
   Vogel, however, points out that several of the questions had
been supplied by Chinese dissidents and were pointed on the issue
of human rights. In the end, Jiang took one question from the
floor. Vogel also defends the educational value of the Jiang
speech, pointing out that it has sparked dialogue between Chinese
and Tibetan students on campus.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what Harvard is about,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   China's hand in Harvard affairs was not limited to the Sanders
Theater speech, however. Beforehand, over a Chinese community
e-mail network, pro-Jiang operatives organized a massive turnout of
supporters outside the theater, busing them in and providing them
with Chinese and American flags. Pro-Jiang Chinese far outnumbered
anti-Jiang Chinese on the streets of Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, they achieved their goal: impressing the audience
back home. ``If ordinary Chinese see people protesting against the
president, they think these are bad American ways,'' explained
Xiaojing Hu, a Harvard PhD candidate in sociology who cheered
Jiang's motorcade. ``In China we are still trying to learn that if
there is a protest it doesn't mean you are going to overthrow the
government.''
</P>
<P>
   Chinese media dubbed Jiang's speech a triumph. Chinese tourists
now trek to Sanders Theater, which they have taken to calling
``Jiang Zemin Speech Hall.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Harvard name goes far in China &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although the United States and China have patched together their
relationship since the dark days of the 1979 Tiananmen Square
massacre, it remains controversial _ as President Clinton's trip to
Beijing later this month shows. The Harvard-Beijing relationship,
meanwhile, is downright cozy.
</P>
<P>
   When he visited China in March, Harvard's president was received
by Jiang in the Communist Party leadership compound of Zhongnanhai.
Chinese television and newspapers gave the visit prominent
coverage. A Rudenstine lecture at Beijing University, which was
founded by Harvard alumni 100 years ago, was jam-packed. The
audience was eager to hear him, Rudenstine says, ``not because they
know me, but they know Harvard and they know the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvard is called ``Ha Fo'' in China _ literally ``laughing
Buddha'' _ and Chinese scholars say it is one of the most widely
recognized American names in their country. As the oldest
university in the United States, with Adamses, Roosevelts, and
Kennedys among its alumni, Harvard has always had an advantage in
international affairs. Today, foreign students are commonplace on
American campuses and most big universities are strong in
international studies, but none rival Harvard for its extensive
hands-on involvement in the day-to-day affairs of other countries.
Its name recognition and global clout elicit envy from other
universities and make world leaders want it in their corner.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard professors, led by economist Jeffrey Sachs, have played
roles in the remaking of a dozen economies _ from Bolivia to
Poland, Mongolia to Russia. Harvard alumni sit in cabinet meetings
in Seoul and Singapore. A ``Harvard speech,'' a ``Harvard
adviser,'' a ``Harvard study'' confer credibility from Rangoon to
Rabat _ so much so that the university has begun to crack down on
tenuously connected academics who appropriate the name in order to
boost their standing in the United States and abroad. In the
spring, Harvard announced new rules for attaching its name to a
report or project.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everywhere you look in the world, you find somebody with a
Harvard connection,'' says John Galvin, dean of Tufts University's
Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy and former supreme allied
commander of NATO. ``That happens with Harvard and no place else.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvard's business school is so well known and so keen to
exploit its academic advantage in the Far East that in September it
will open an Asian-Pacific research center in Hong Kong, the first
of at least six that will be opened around the globe in the next
few years. Centers in Latin America and Europe will be up and
running by the end of next year. The centers will serve Harvard
business school researchers and act as a regional base for
executive education. More than a quarter of the Harvard Business
School's student population is international.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that there is increased demand for
business management expertise in China,'' says Yasheng Haung, a
professor in the Harvard Business School. ``There is a tremendous
interest in Harvard MBAs in China. The Harvard name is very, very
significant in China.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past few years, Harvard has developed a new tool to win
friends and influence abroad: an array of executive programs for
working professionals, especially at the business school and the
John F. Kennedy School of Government.

 TOBACCO LOBBY WILL FAIL TRYING TO MAKE McCAIN SAY ``UNCLE'' 
(For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN 
c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Mayday! Mayday! Tiger Two to Naval Command. I'm taking flak
from my left and heavy ack-ack from my right. Fuel is low, and I'm
out here alone. The bad guys just winged me. Looks like I'm going
in. Mayday! Mayday!''
</P>
<P>
   The last time John McCain was in a similar pickle, he was shot
down over Vietnam and landed in pain, in prison, and in the hands
of torturers. Now, Big Tobacco is trying to do what the North
Vietnamese prison guards couldn't do in six years of trying: make
him say ``Uncle.''
</P>
<P>
   The senator from Arizona is on the receiving end of the torture
treatment from the tobacco executives. The Big Tobacco companies _
undoubtedly represented in the 401(k) plans and mutual funds of
many Americans who sympathize with McCain _ are spending big money
to smear the chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee. The Bully
Boyz of the Burley Biz are spending what some estimate as upwards
of $50 million on advertising that is designed to demoralize
Congress and demonize McCain. It is not pretty.
</P>
<P>
   The tobacco companies are buying air time and running broadcast
and print ads in lots of places, including Arizona and the two
early presidential testing ground states, Iowa and New Hampshire,
to turn public opinion against McCain.
</P>
<P>
   So low have they gone in their desperate attempt to stop tobacco
legislation that they are trying to destroy the political future of
one of the only Republicans in Washington with the gumption to
stand up to the most free-spending lobby of them all.
</P>
<P>
   The nicotine peddlers are worried that McCain's peculiar
combination of hero status and his committee chairmanship in the
Senate may give him the unique kind of outside-inside clout that
will decide the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   For the tobacco company chiefs, a lot rides on their struggle
with the onetime US Navy pilot who was shot down in Vietnam and
offered early release by his captors for propaganda purposes.
McCain's father and grand-father were Navy admirals who had ships
named after them. But McCain foiled North Vietnam's propaganda aim
by refusing to go home ahead of his turn, and he was roughed up
considerably by his torturers.
</P>
<P>
   Now the torture is the electronic kind _ death by a thousand
negative ads. McCain is thinking of running for president. At 61,
as a conservative hero to many Americans across the ideological
spectrum, the 2000 election is his last shot. He's earned his right
to have a go.
</P>
<P>
   But there's no free pass in politics, war hero or no. They all
get the same kind of flak. And what shot him down over North
Vietnam is a lot deadlier than the gimmicky junk fired off by the
greasy tobacco lobby.
</P>
<P>
   From the left, Teddy Kennedy hammers at McCain for not wishing
to impose a $1.50-per-pack tax on the evil weed. From the right,
Newt Gingrich denounces him as an apostate advocating ``a
big-government liberal tax-and-spend'' philosophy. Senate majority
leader Trent Lott, always the chief water-carrier for Big
Tobaccycq, undermines McCain's $1.10-per-pack tax, saying it'll
break the cigarette barons, harm the farmer, and weaken America's
moral fiber: ``Greed has just gone hog wild here,'' cautions the
greediest PAC-money porker of them all.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has come to terms with the Clinton White House _
something remarkable in this toxic waste dump called D.C. _ by
agreeing with Erskine Bowles, Clinton's chief of staff, to trim the
tobacco package in the direction of curbing youth smoking. With
3,000 kids daily initiating the smoking habit, McCain and Bowles
have settled on their version of a deal.
</P>
<P>
   But the cancer-stick lobby seeks to sow fear and dissent among
our lawgivers. And all the fire their millions can buy focuses on
McCain. The message to more cowardly congressmen? If we can savage
McCain, imagine what we can do to you, Senator, or you,
Congressman.
</P>
<P>
   Fear of saddling millions of teens with inevitable lung cancer
runs a poor second to fear of losing campaign cash from Tobacco Row
or, worse, having all that boodle go to your opponent next fall. So
stakes are huge, and McCain is in their gunsights, just like the
day his Navy fighter was knocked from the sky.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is a real hardhead, as the North Vietnamese learned. He
does not flinch. He takes on the TV networks, the piggish interests
of the anticampaign-finance-reform coalition, the wealthiest
lobbies in America, and now Big Tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   The tobacco propagandists misread their man. You cannot break
McCain's will. You cannot make him quit. You cannot coerce him with
threats, bribes, bluster, or 30-second attack ads. He is a stranger
to the Tobacco Boys, because the senators they know are craven,
boot-licking, lily-livered, cash-sucking, yellow-bellied political
warblers. McCain has been in tougher spots than having Big Tobacco
blackmail him in Iowa or New Hampshire. If his fellow senators
abandon him on this one, they deserve the craven reputation they
have earned.

GOLD TILTED THE COUNTRY WESTWARD
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARTIN F. NOLAN 
c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ A few tiny nuggets of bright metal discovered
at Sutter's Mill in January 1848 tilted this continent westward,
brought in people and wealth, and made California a restless
nation's destination. The state is celebrating for the next three
years because were it not for the Gold Rush, California today would
be a place of stunning geography, a large, peaceful, sylvan ``Baja
Oregon.''
</P>
<P>
   In June 150 years ago, a Massachusetts native, Thomas O. Larkin,
wrote to the secretary of state ``of the most astonishing
excitements and state of affairs now existing in this country.''
Larkin, US consul general when Mexico ruled the West, told James
Buchanan that the gold ``is situated on public land.'' Forget it,
Uncle Sam. This gold would not be federalized but instead became a
symbol of frenzied opportunity and the basis of fortunes that still
rule California today.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the celebration, the California Historical Society
has published a double issue of its magazine, lavishly depicting
pregold California, ``The Contested Eden.'' At the Oakland Museum
of California, ``Gold Fever!'' has attracted crowds to its art,
artifacts, and photography. The exhibit moves this summer to Los
Angeles, then Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1840s, Isaac Wallace Baker prospered in Beverly, Mass.,
as an illustrator. But after he came to the California diggings,
his drawings and daguerreotypes of life in Murphy's Camp, on
display here, enthralled America. The search for gold intensified
divisions between the East's smugness and the West's suddenness,
between ingenuity and adventure, between pluck and luck.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1850s, California's population swelled by 245 percent, as
documented in J.S. Holliday's book, ``The World Rushed In.'' Larkin
warned that when ``the whale ships visit San Francisco, I think
they will lose most all their crews.'' Excavations for modern
skyscrapers confirmed his prediction, finding whole ships buried in
muck.
</P>
<P>
   California became synonymous with luck and hope until, as the
phrase went, things ``didn't pan out.'' Mark Twain and Bret Harte
arrived, their stories enriching the American imagination.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone cheered. ``The recent rush to California,'' wrote
Henry David Thoreau in 1852, ``appears to me to reflect the
greatest disgrace on mankind.'' The sage of Walden Pond derided
``the lottery of gold-digging,'' as did his neighbor, Ralph Waldo
Emerson: ``I do not think very respectfully of the designs or the
doings of the people who went to California in 1849. It was a rush
and a scramble of needy adventurers, and, in the western country, a
general jail delivery of all the rowdies of the rivers.''
</P>
<P>
   Rowdy they were, and are. With human nature in thrall to Mother
Nature, an outlaw romantic image evolved, one that enlivened the
self-image of the state long after it entered the Union in 1850.
``A truly Homeric number of homicides fills the literature of the
Gold Rush, a catalogue of slit throats, gunshot wounds, and crushed
skulls,'' the historian Kevin Starr writes in ``Americans and the
California Dream,'' the first of his multivolume history. ``Murder,
especially from the latter part of 1850, through 1851, became a way
of life.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1860, Emerson declared, ``In America, the geography is
sublime, but the men are not,'' meaning that ``events so grand as
the opening of California'' prove that ``most of the great results
of history are brought about by discreditable means.''
</P>
<P>
   An untidy randomness is California's heritage, as real as ``the
blowing dust'' of gold seen by another New Englander in his youth.
Robert Frost was born in San Francisco after his father joined the
Gold Rush. In the 1870s, gold was still in the air and the memory,
as he later wrote:
</P>
<P>
   ``Such was life in the Golden Gate:
</P>
<P>
   Gold dusted all we drank and ate.
</P>
<P>
   And I was one of the children told,
</P>
<P>
   ``We all must eat our peck of gold.''

BLACK CHURCH ATTACKED FOR ALLEGED BIAS AGAINST HOMOSEXUALS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIEGO RIBADENEIRA 
c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Rev. Irene Monroe, a doctoral candidate at Harvard Divinity
School, is exploring, as she describes it, the ``relationship
between misogyny and homophobia in the black church and in the
Nation of Islam.''
</P>
<P>
   Monroe is rapidly becoming a prominent figure on the Boston
religious scene, and is not shy about expressing her views. Her
blunt style and academic credentials have made her increasingly
popular on the lecture circuit.
</P>
<P>
   Monroe's growing renown comes from a willingness to do what few
others with her educational and theological pedigree dare to do _
publicly attack the black church.
</P>
<P>
   Within the black community, the church is viewed as the
foundation of the civil rights movement and the institution
unequaled for providing spiritual and physical comfort in times of
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   But Monroe, a lesbian who lives with her partner in a row house
near Cambridge's Inman Square, is outspoken in her criticism of the
black church and the Nation of Islam for their treatment of women
and homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   In historically black Baptist and African Methodist Episcopal
churches, homosexuality is rarely mentioned. And if it is,
homosexuality is usually treated as a sin against God.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to speak out every opportunity I get because black
lesbians and gay men are virtually invisible in our churches and in
society,'' says Monroe, a youthful-looking 43-year-old who is also
a teaching assistant for the Rev. Peter Gomes at Harvard Divinity
School.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of the treatment of women is equally troubling to
Monroe. While black women are the backbone of most African-American
churches, they are often relegated to second-class status and
forced to take a back seat to male clergy. ``It's an entrenched
patriarchy,'' Monroe says.
</P>
<P>
   Monroe traveled a long, hard road to make it to the citadel of
academic excellence on the banks of the Charles River. She was
abandoned in a Brooklyn, N.Y., park as a baby, where she was found
by garbage collectors. She was reared by abusive foster parents.
</P>
<P>
   Monroe recalls one of her foster mother's favorite putdowns:
``You come from nothing. You are nothing. You'll be nothing.'' She
found refuge in a Brooklyn public library and in the sanctuaries
inside black churches. Monroe won a scholarship to attend Wellesley
College and went on to earn a master's degree at New York's Union
Theological Seminary.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, she became increasingly aware that the black
church was not always a welcoming place for women or gays. The bias
against gays and women extended to other black religious
institutions, Monroe said, in particular, the Nation of Islam.
</P>
<P>
   She wrote an essay titled ``Louis Farrakhan's Ministry of
Misogyny and Homophobia'' for a recent anthology on Farrakhan that
also included contributions from Henry Louis Gates Jr., Michael
Eric Dyson, Stanley Crouch, and other noted black intellectuals.
</P>
<P>
   The black church's attitude toward homosexuality is not solely a
question of civil rights, Monroe believes, but also involves
serious public health issues.
</P>
<P>
   Because of their views on homosexuality, many black churches
have been reluctant to talk about AIDS, which has ravaged the black
community, says Monroe, who will be a grand marshal for the Gay
Pride parade on June 13. The following day she is scheduled to
preach at Old West Church in Boston as part of Gay Pride Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Among blacks, and especially among many black clergy, Monroe
says ``there is a hierarchy of oppression. Being black is at the
top of the hierarchy and everyone else, women, queers, Latinos,
Asians are below. We need to realize that we don't have a patent on
oppression.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, Monroe describes herself as a ``public theologian''
moving between academia and ``the streets'' to challenge
traditional black religious institutions to become more
egalitarian.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who are secure in themselves and in their faith don't
go around preaching hate, they preach love and acceptance,'' she
says. ``The only way to change the dynamics of the black religious
experience is to educate people.''

   _While it might be premature for most people, Pope John Paul II
has already released his schedule for the year 2000. John Paul, the
most traveled pope in history, is planning to stay in Rome to
welcome the hordes of visitors expected to visit the Vatican to
mark Christianity's third millennium.
</P>
<P>
   The only possible change to the pontiff's agenda might be a trip
to the Holy Land, a pilgrimage John Paul has long been eager to
make. So far, the politics and complexity of such a trip have made
it impossible to coordinate.
</P>
<P>
   About 20 million people _ triple the usual number _ are expected
to visit Rome during 2000 and the Vatican hopes to spread the
number of visitors by scheduling different events throughout the
year. The Vatican has set aside specific days to honor
entertainers, refugees, health workers, journalists, farmers and
police, among others.

TED TURNER MAKES SOUNDS ABOUT A NEW PRO FOOTBALL LEAGUE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GREGG KRUPA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ted Turner thinks the fans are ready for more football.
</P>
<P>
   Turner, vice chairman of Time-Warner Inc., and NBC broached the
idea of a new football league in January. Few observers thought the
idea was serious. And many thought it merely a fit of pique over
having lost the national rights to broadcast professional football
to CBS, Fox, ABC, and ESPN. The four paid a total of $17.6 billion
for those rights.
</P>
<P>
   But NBC reported last week that Time-Warner and General Electric
_ the owners of Turner Sports and NBC, respectively _ are ``moving
forward'' with plans. Some sources say they include a franchise for
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Sports industry observers say that Turner, who is believed to be
worth at least $3.5 billion, and NBC sports boss Dick Ebersol
believe the league can thrive. They are believed to be working now
to convince their bosses at Time-Warner and GE to let them play
with the money it would take to make the league a success.
</P>
<P>
   Reaction has been immediate _ and utterly equivocal. Some
advertising and sports insiders consider the concept laughable and
implausible. Others say it would fly, and might even amount to the
most severe challenge the National Football League has faced since
it organized under that name in 1922.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Ted Turner's got the deep pockets to sustain a new
football league as long as he wants to sustain it,'' said David
D'Alessandro, senior executive vice president of the John Hancock
Mutual Life Insurance Co. ``How long he would want to take losses
is another story.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been five other attempts to start rival leagues.
Three _ in 1925, 1974, and 1983 _ were the spectacular failures of
entrepreneurs who thought there was enough room in professional
football to make more money, only to be proven wrong in less than
two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; cl10.5 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Two other attempts _ by the All-American Football Conference
from 1946 through 1949, and by the American Football League from
1960 through 1970 _ were partially successful. The AAFC died before
the 1950 season, but three of its eight original teams became NFL
franchises with long, storied histories. The 10-team AFL was
incorporated fully into the NFL in the great merger of 1970.
</P>
<P>
   Any confidence about the viability of yet another run at
starting a new professional football league is based on Turner's
reputation. Among the nation's richest men, Turner is often
spoiling for a good fight. More importantly, his track record in
business often backs his brazen boastfulness. ``Everything I touch
turns to gold,'' is one of Turner's mantras.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time-Warner and GE are going to listen to him because he's
created a lot of very valuable assets that a lot of people thought
were crazy ideas to begin with,'' said one media stock analyst.
</P>
<P>
   No one thought CNN would work. Now much of the planet relies on
it for television news. Before Turner Sports was inaugurated, there
was a consensus that there was simply too much sports on
television. Years later, a sports-crazy nation is yet to be
satiated.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta Braves were among the perennial doormats of Major
League Baseball _ until the 1990s. Now, they are perennial winners,
and their TBS broadcasts to much of the nation have turned them
into the only thing resembling America's Team. Turner also was
heckled from the balcony for buying the MGM movie archives. Today,
he continues to reap returns on that investment.
</P>
<P>
   But how much the proposed new league would cost is a fiercely
debated topic in sports business circles. There appears to be an
expensive strategy, and an inexpensive one.
</P>
<P>
   Some think the league will survive only if Turner and NBC get
leeway to rack up losses approaching a total of $100 million for
the first several years. Others say that because Turner and NBC own
media outlets, they could create bargains for potential
advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they can price the units of advertising very affordably,
and they may well be able to do that, some advertisers are going to
have to take a look at it,'' said Rick Burton, director of the
Warsaw Sports Marketing Center at the University of Oregon. And if
the games in the new league are able to attract a minimal two or
three market share on TV, they would have the same number of
viewers as NHL hockey, tennis, golf, and many car races.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't even know what it is yet, really, so it is tough to
speculate,'' said Steve Grubbs, who runs national buying for the
advertising firm BBDO, in New York. ``Is it something that is going
to go head-to-head with the NFL in terms of a season in the fall,
with Sunday broadcasts? That might be a really tough sell. Is there
some market at another time? Almost certainly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Football is kind of eternally attractive,'' Grubbs said.
``Heck, arena football is still around, isn't it?''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to garnering advertising, sports industry experts
say the new league will have to be successful in the hunt for
venues. And the Turner-NBC campaign for stadiums with capacities in
excess of 50,000 has already begun.
</P>
<P>
   According to advertising sources, the new league might begin in
eight cities: New York, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Boston, Atlanta,
Salt Lake City, Orlando, Fla., and Birmingham, Ala. Meanwhile,
officials in Houston _ recently abandoned by the NFL's Oilers _ say
they have been contacted, too. Ditto San Antonio. And business
officials in Portland, Ore., have stated publicly they will work to
attract a franchise.
</P>
<P>
   It is considered unlikely that Patriots owner Robert Kraft would
have much to do with encouraging the new league, even if it meant a
substantial off-season tenant for his stadium. In the Boston area,
that would leave a franchise with a thin list of alternatives,
including Nickerson Field at Boston University, where the capacity
is less than 18,000, and Harvard Stadium, with a capacity of less
than 38,000.
</P>
<P>
   Boston College would be unlikely to ask its neighbors to
withstand pro football fans at the 45,000-capacity Alumni Stadium.
And the new league also should forget about Fenway Park, where the
Boston Patriots played some 35 years ago for the upstart AFL.
</P>
<P>
   But assuming advertisers were paying up, and places were found
to play the games, Turner and NBC would be free to engage the NFL
in a pitched battle for the talent while providing a reasonably
entertaining product.
</P>
<P>
   Football and sports insiders agree that, to be viable, the new
league would have to snare two or three ``franchise players,'' on
the level of a Drew Bledsoe or a Deion Sanders, an additional 12 to
18 ``stars,'' and 30 or 40 current NFL players _ most of them in
the first year of operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ability to attract star players for the long term is an
absolutely crucial consideration in this,'' D'Alessandro said.
``Even if the league is presented properly, can you close the deals
with enough quality players for a sustained period of time? I think
it takes five years, and you are talking stratospheric numbers.''

WILLIAM GIBBONS NEAR END OF MONUMENTAL HISTORY OF US IN VIETNAM
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ALOYSIUS FARRELL  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONROE, Va. _ Nestled in a 200-year-old cabin, using aged
fountain pens to fill hundreds of legal pads with a messy scrawl,
William Gibbons is nearing the end of an assignment he began two
decades ago. Alone, he is writing the US government history of the
war in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Authors and scholars of the Vietnam era scramble for
superlatives when asked about Gibbons and his five-volume work,
``The US Government and the Vietnam War.'' He has gone through
thousands of boxes of government documents, interviewed the most
important US officials, and laid out his findings in a
comprehensive and comprehensible manner.
</P>
<P>
   The Gibbons volumes are ``by far the best books on the
subject,'' said William Bundy, who helped shape Vietnam policy at
the State and Defense departments in the early 1960s. ``They are
balanced. Full. I think I can say _ and I have read a hell of a lot
of stuff on the subject _ that this is the best of the breed.''
</P>
<P>
   Gibbons is a courtly, sandy-haired Virginian with the tanned
face, scruffy dogs, and battered pickup truck of a gentleman
farmer, and the youthful attitude demanded by the two young foster
children he and his wife, a Lynchburg, Va. lawyer, have adopted.
His winning smile and good looks belie his 71 years and make him a
natural companion to telegenic contemporaries like David McCullough
or Shelby Foote.
</P>
<P>
   But in an age of celebrity, Gibbons labors in anonymity. In an
era of omnipresent media, Gibbons declines to practice the art of
historian-as-talking-head. In a time of seven-figure book deals,
his work is published quietly by the Congressional Research Service
and the scholarly Princeton University Press, and he receives no
royalties.
</P>
<P>
   Gibbons relishes his rural corner of the Blue Ridge as ``my own
little world of thought, where I can figure out things.'' Now his
scholarship is emerging as a standard reference work and foundation
for a flock of popular histories and biographies.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``Bill is an overlooked hero,'' said Paul Hendrickson, the
author of a book about former defense secretary Robert McNamara and
the Vietnam War. ``His is a very thankless job in this culture,
which wants pop and dash and sizzle. But for people like myself,
well, just watch how much his name comes up in the footnotes.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Indeed, it is in the footnotes and acknowledgements that
today's historians record their debt to Gibbons. To Boston
University's Robert Dallek, who just published the second volume of
his biography of Lyndon B. Johnson, Gibbons loaned his
yet-unpublished manuscripts. Brian VanDeMark, who co-authored
McNamara's 1995 memoir, calls Gibbons's work ``magisterial,'' and
both he and McNamara acknowledged the Virginian's help.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Stanley Karnow, author of the best-known one-volume history of
the war, worked with Gibbons on the PBS television series
``Vietnam: A Television History.'' Karnow also drew from Gibbons's
``terrifically useful'' manuscripts and calls the work ``one of the
most valuable studies of the formulation of Vietnam policy during
the Kennedy and Johnson administrations.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Gibbons is not the first government historian to trace the US
involvement in Vietnam. In the late 1960s, McNamara ordered his
Pentagon staff to go through its files and produce a series of
reports that became known, after being leaked to the press, as the
Pentagon Papers amid great controversy in 1971. Each of the armed
services has since studied and documented the various failings of
US military strategy in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; But such works as the Pentagon Papers ``only give you a
glimpse _ enough to tantalize you, make you want to fill in the
blanks and put the whole thing together,'' Gibbons said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Gibbons, more thoroughly than other historians, has recorded
how mistakes in judgment and analysis, concerns about public
opinion, and domestic politics afflicted US policymakers. He fuses
poll results, White House memos, CIA analyses, congressional
debate, presidential speeches, and Pentagon decision papers into a
long, chilling chronological narrative that tracks the best and
brightest US officials as they blunder into tragedy. His most
recent volume, covering the months between July 1965 and January
1968, is 969 pages long.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Some of the most poignant episodes from Gibbons's writings
describe the doubts that America's leaders privately harbored and
the repeated warnings they ignored as they plunged the nation into
war.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey in February 1965
urged Johnson to resist escalation and ``cut our losses'' in
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``We now risk creating the impression that we are the prisoner
of events in Vietnam,'' Humphrey wrote in a secret memo to the
president. ``If ... we find ourselves leading from frustration to
escalation and end up ... embroiled deeper in fighting in Vietnam
over the next few months, political opposition will steadily
mount.'' After LBJ's landslide victory in 1964, Humphrey argued,
the administration had a unique opportunity to withdraw.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's response, Gibbons learned, was to bar Humphrey from
all meetings on Vietnam for more than a year. Gibbons also shows
how LBJ turned a deaf ear to the urgent warnings of CIA analysts
who told the president that the US strategy, based on air power and
attrition, was worse than useless _ it was counterproductive, as it
stiffened Communist resolve. The CIA analysts ``were ignored,''
Gibbons said.
</P>
<P>
   Gibbons was commissioned in 1978 to write this history, as the
result of a series of conversations with Norvill Jones, who led the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee staff under Senator William
Fulbright of Arkansas, one of the war's most outspoken opponents.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the next two decades, with the blessings of
Fulbright's Republican and Democratic successors, Gibbons has
worked exclusively on the Vietnam project. Having retired from the
government, he is now researching and writing the fifth and final
volume, chronicling the Nixon administration's handling of the war.
</P>
<P>
   With top-secret security clearance and his government title,
Gibbons has had superior access to documents and policymakers. But
such entry has a price, Bundy acknowledged. Any work produced under
``official auspices'' is open to charges of being a whitewash.
</P>
<P>
   When filmmaker Oliver Stone suggested in the movie ``JFK'' that
President Kennedy was assassinated because he was ready to withdraw
US troops from Vietnam, Gibbons's work was used by Stone's critics
to rebut that contention. Gibbons himself then came under attack as
an official apologist.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are those to whom `official auspices' suggests either
bad writing or stereotyped thinking, neither of which is true of
Bill Gibbons' books. A lot of people think that his work is not as
likely to be as sprightly or original as something in the private
sector,'' Bundy said. ``But for my money, he has not had a bias nor
an organizational tie that corrupts his judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   Gibbons has moved between government and academia during his
long career. Before joining the Congressional Research Service in
1970, he worked as a Senate aide to LBJ, as a lobbyist for the
Johnson administration, and as a staffer for eventual critics of
the war such as Democratic Senators Mike Mansfield of Montana and
Wayne Morse of Oregon. Gibbons joined the Army at age 18 during
World War II, made an unsuccesful run for Congress as a Democrat in
Virginia in the early 1960s, and has taught at several colleges.
</P>
<P>
   Gibbons strives to meet the research service's ideal of rigid
objectivity and apparently has succeeded. Even the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee chairman Jesse Helms of North Carolina has
supported the Democrat historian's work. Gibbons used only one
``confidential source'' in his writing _ he says now that it was
McNamara. All else is on the record. His work is checked by former
officials, the Senate Foreign Relations staff, the research
service, and academic specialists before publication.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is a fetish of mine _ to be as accurate as possible,''
Gibbons said, while taking a break to sit on the porch of his cabin
and watch his neighbor's children ride their horses over his
meadow. ``I don't like historians who inject themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   After studying the history of the Vietnam conflict for 20 years,
Gibbons has one lesson for his countrymen: It could happen again.
</P>
<P>
   Gibbons said the presidency is still ``imperial,'' and Congress
needs to assert its war-making powers over presidents prone to
intervene in places like Grenada, Lebanon, Somalia, Bosnia, or
Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our system is such that the president has the power to get us
into these things, to get us trapped. We are still making foreign
policy decisions without the necessary knowledge and with the
arrogance that only comes from being American,'' said Gibbons. ``I
think we are in for some very dangerous times in the days ahead.''

THE CHOSEN, FROZEN FEW
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM 
c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pawing through a magazine profile of Ralph Merkle, a nerdy West
Coast scientist, I noticed a curious biographical detail: Mr.
Merkle is one of the few people in the world who have paid to have
their bodies cryonically suspended _ frozen _ after death. He hopes
that scientists will discover a way to revive human life from
frozen tissue before the Apocalypse, or before his yearly payments
to Arizona-based Alcor Life Extension Foundation run out.
</P>
<P>
   OK, it's a bet. But more intriguing, Merkle's Web site provides
a link to ``quite a few people well known in the fields of computer
science, software development and other high-tech areas'' who've
opted for the deep freeze. There are 26 of them and, not
surprisingly, they have some things in common:
</P>
<P>
   1. They are all nerds.
</P>
<P>
   2. Twenty-five of the 26 are men.
</P>
<P>
   3. Most of them, with the exception of Cambridge's own Marvin
Minsky, live in California.
</P>
<P>
   So here's your first peek at post-Armageddon America: a bunch of
cockroaches scurrying around the pant legs of 25 computer and
biotech nerds, who are in turn scouring the Santa Cruz Moutains for
frozen women to revive and fraternize with. It's a chilling
thought.
</P>
<P>
   Interest in cryogenics has been heating up, slowly, since the
1964 publication of Robert Ettinger's book ``The Prospect of
Immortality.'' Ettinger now runs the Michigan-based Cryonics
Institute, which charges a one-time, $28,000 suspension fee for
clients who want to be around for the release of Windows 64. On his
Web site ( &UR; www.cryonics.org &LR; ) Ettinger plays awful music and boasts
of his company's ``proven track record,'' whatever that means.
</P>
<P>
   Several other outfits will either suspend you or put you in
touch with someone who will. The above-mentioned Alcor charges an
annual $360 Emergency Response Fee (half price for students!) to
fly the dry-ice guys to your bedside just before, or shortly after,
you cross the Rainbow Bridge. (That's the term ferret owners use
when their smelly, rabidoferous little companions go to the big
litter box in the sky. But I digress.)
</P>
<P>
   As with everything, it pays to shop around. Wilmington,
Del.-based CryoSpan claims to flash-freeze ``humans and their
companion animals at the lowest possible price,'' which turns out
to be an annual $250 for ``neuro'' (brain only) or $1,500 for the
full monty. The Cryonics Society of Canada does not perform cryonic
suspensions, but has done permafrost interments _ prices not
available at press time.
</P>
<P>
   So who wants to stick around, and why? Minsky, who has several
major research proj-ects cooking over at MIT's Media Lab, explains
that &UR;  &LR; he could use the extra time: ``At the moment, I'd estimate
that I'd need about 500 years to complete some of my current
proj-ects. To be sure, in its present state, cryonics is very
unlikely to help _ but right now, it's the only game in town.''
</P>
<P>
   Robin Hanson, a 38-year-old health policy scholar at the
University of California at Berkeley, explains on his Web site,
``For a few hundred dollars a year, I estimate I'm buying a 0.5
percent chance of living for thousands of (subjective) years.'' His
favorite musicians are Vangelis and Enya, so plan on hearing lots
of ethereal sounds if you end up spending the Third Millennium with
Robin.
</P>
<P>
   The only woman who may be available for soulful chats at sunset
is Kennita Watson, a Libertarian activist who has run for statewide
office several times in California. On the Internet, Watson calls
herself ``a kinder, gentler Libertarian, because I think that most
people are at least trying to do the right thing, and that (this
being reality) we can't teleport from here to the promised land of
Libertopia; we'll have to trek across the coercion-strewn
wastelands to get there.'' See you in 2175!
</P>
<P>
   Is it worth risking freezer burn to see if there really will be
500 channels on TV? I don't think so. But as the cryonicists like
to point out, this is one experiment you're already participating
in. They're the experimental subjects. You and I are the control
group.

SCULPTOR SALLY FINE PUTS BROKEN CROCKERY AND GLASS TO USE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRISTINE TEMIN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Broken crockery and glass have been important, if unexpected,
materials for art making throughout the 20th century, from the
mosaic exteriors of buildings by turn-of-the-century Catalan
architect Antoni Gaudi to the plate-encrusted, Gaudi-inspired
paintings Julian Schnabel started making in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Gaudi and Schnabel use broken china more for texture than
meaning; the Boston sculptor Sally Fine uses the same material for
both reasons, to suggest people, usually women, who have been
broken apart and partly reassembled. In Schnabel's work, there's a
macho tone to the Humpty-Dumpty breakage; in Fine's, it seems more
important to put the pieces back together.
</P>
<P>
   Fine calls her new show at Boston Sculptors at Chapel Gallery in
West Newton ``Happenstance,'' a nod to the random, chance aspects
of life. An artist known in the past primarily for work in tree
branches and bark _ there's a prime example in a prime spot near
the new entrance of the DeCordova Museum in Lincoln _ she's now
expanded her materials and emotional range.
</P>
<P>
   All the Chapel Gallery works, both small and large, are in some
sense figurative. A couple of the smallest are under bell jars that
protect but also suffocate: There's a parallel in Sylvia Plath's
novel ``The Bell Jar,'' where the glass dome is a metaphor for the
depressed person's isolation from the rest of the world. One of
Fine's bell-jar pieces, ``Sounding Stone,'' shows a child's hands
rising out of rock, with a spiny shell delicately balanced on the
fingertips. The upward thrust of the piece suggests optimism about
the possibility of escape.
</P>
<P>
   Several works are female torsos, covered in broken china or, in
the case of ``Wasp's Nest,'' in birch bark with fungi sprouting
from it and a ruff of bright green moss around the neck. The
whiteness of the bark recalls a Victorian lady's skin, but the
markings suggest the skin has been flayed. The torso is installed
facing the wall, so you see its back, a gaping hole lined in black
velvet that makes the depth of the space unreadable. Inside is a
lyrically bending twig with a wasp's nest clinging to it, stand-ins
for arteries and a heart. Hung inside another torso, called
``Property,'' are a variety of house keys with at least two
meanings: women locked away, and women's role as keeper of domestic
stores.
</P>
<P>
   The most glorious works in the show are the largest, including
``Blue Glass and Pen Shells,'' a neck-to-knees female figure hung
by a metal rod through her shoulders. A baroque extravaganza of
voluptuous shells and jagged, dangerous spikes of aqua glass, the
figure is lit from within, but only at womb level, as if that were
the only part of her that counted. One of her breasts wears shell
armor; the other one is missing, a void. The literal-minded might
see this as a mastectomy. But it also suggests images of strength:
a mythical Amazon warrior cutting off her breast so it won't
interfere with her archery; the icon that conflates Artemis and
Apollo into a single potent person, half woman, half man.
</P>
<P>
   Fine's ``Birch Maiden'' suggests a female crucifix, with
additional references to classical mythology and Native American
craft. Frontal and hieratic, the maiden hangs in the center of a
wall in front of the apse of this gallery, which used to be a
chapel. Behind her flares a skeletal fan of metal (actually a
dismembered satellite dish). The maid is made of birch bark, like
an American Indian basket, and her head and arms are replaced by
wayward, antlerlike twigs, which makes her seem a sister to Daphne
turning into a laurel. Hung off the floor, powerless to move, she
may be a sacrifice _ but she's a potent one, with her own magic.
</P>
<P>
   The only complete figure in the show, ``Winged Jardiniere,'' is
also the only male. While the fragmentary women are covered with
floral or lacy china patterns, this guy gets more masculine solids
or stripes. He also gets a cute little teapot spout for a penis.
(It's tempting to read this as some sort of size-does-matter
comment.) He seems poised for takeoff, hanging from rusty, thick
chains, with only the toes of one foot still touching the floor,
his satellite dish wings jutting behind him. Yet this Man of Action
looks weighty and awkward. His attempt to soar seems as doomed as
that of Icarus, or those of the flying machines of Leonardo and
Vladimir Tatlin.
</P>
<P>
   Sally Fine's ``Happenstance'' is at Boston Sculptors at Chapel
Gallery, 60 Highland St., West Newton, through June 21. Gallery
hours are Wednesday through Sunday, 1-5:30 p.m. The show's opening
reception is Sunday 2-5 p.m. Fine gives a gallery talk on June 14
at 11:15 a.m.

<P>
   Carl Belz, Princeton basketball star, rock music chronicler,
and, for nearly a quarter-century, director of the Rose Art Museum
at Brandeis University in Waltham, is retiring early from that
post, at the ungracious request of a university administration that
wants a fund-raiser in the job. It was Belz who built what has
become the largest collection of contemporary art in New England,
and who brought more high-level contemporary shows to this region
that any other curator or director has. That's his most visible
achievement. Belz was also a whiz at explaining art, and not only
to grown-ups. The Rose never patted itself on the back for its
school programs _ that's not Belz's style _ but area teachers and
students remember them as masterful introductions to
sometimes-challenging work. And Belz was a tireless visitor to
artists' studios, tracing careers over years, even decades.
</P>
<P>
   A great many people in the Boston art community have reason to
be grateful to Carl Belz. They'll have a chance to say thanks in
person Sunday, when Brandeis and the Rose overseers host a
reception in his honor inside the museum and on its grounds.
Everyone's invited. Hours are 3-5 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't the end of Belz's presence on the Boston scene. He's
agreed to be the guest juror for the Triennial at the Fuller Museum
of Art in Brockton next year. The Triennial is the region's largest
regular contemporary art pulse-taking: Selecting its participants
is an appropriate assignment for a man with such extensive
knowledge of the art community. And, on a national level, Belz has
been approached about contributing to the catalogue raisonne of
Robert Motherwell's paintings.

   Editors know when a big book is coming down the pike. If the
author is a Paula Wolfert, a Patricia Wells or a Madeleine Kamman,
you know the work will be worth considering.
</P>
<P>
   But then there are the cameos, the unexpected surprises of the
publishing world. Just such a one is ``Cool Kitchen: 125 Delicious,
No-Work Recipes for Summertime or Anytime _ No Oven, No Stove, No
Sweat!'' by Lauren Chattman (Morrow, $22).
</P>
<P>
   You'd never know by the ``cookable'' quality of this book that
Chattman is a chef and a first-time author. The recipes are
straight-ahead, light on ingredients and approachably ``outre.''
It's easy to see the pretty plating possibilities of Baja shrimp
salad with avocado dressing (eight ingredients), Cheddar and apple
sandwiches with honey mustard (five ingredients) and goat cheese
wrapped in grape leaves (three ingredients).

   This is a great book for those inevitable Texas weekends when

   Wednesday morning, residents of Rapid City, S.D., awakened to a
record low temperature of 32 degrees as a push of unusually cold
air poured southward from Canada. This pool of cool air will remain
over a large section of the Northern states Thursday, stretching
from the northern Rockies to the Great Lakes and onto New England.
</P>
<P>
   Milder winds gliding over the cold air will cause chilly rains
to fall from eastern Wyoming to South Dakota and Nebraska. Snow is
likely in some of the higher elevations of the Front Range, mainly
above 6,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Clusters of showers and strong thunderstorms will occur from the
lower Mississippi Valley to the Southeast coast as sultry winds
from the south intercept a nearby stationary front.
</P>
<P>
   Later Thursday, a jet stream disturbance will pass over the
front, causing a few of these storms to become severe. Winds
changing direction and increasing speed with altitude will impart
rotation to a few of these storms. These rotating thunderstorms,
known as supercells, are capable of spawning tornadoes.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, uncomfortable heat and humidity will persist from
southern Texas to southern Georgia and Florida. Elsewhere, isolated
strong thunderstorms will erupt Thursday afternoon in west Texas as
a front separating dry air from humid air advances east through the
region.
</P>
<P>
   Brisk winds from the northwest will direct very cool air into
the eastern Great Lakes and Northeast. A disturbance rotating
around low pressure over eastern Canada will bring chilly showers
to portions of northern New England. The remainder of the region
will have a mixture of clouds and sunshine.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacific states will be dry and sunny, though patchy clouds
will shroud sections of the California and Oregon coasts. Much of
California will continue to be seasonably cool.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: JUNE SNOW
</P>
<P>
   As a meteorologist at the National Weather Service at Rapid City
ventured outside to prepare for a weather balloon launch, he was
met with a surreal scene. With heavy snow falling from a lightning
illuminated sky, water sprinklers rhythmically swayed across a
newly whitened lawn earlier parched by hot, dry weather. By early
Wednesday, three inches of snow had fallen, the city's second
greatest June snowfall. June snow is rare. Since records began in
1888 at Rapid City, it had previously snowed twice in June _ 0.5
inches on June 13, 1969, and 3.6 inches on June 1, 1951. &QL;

 &HT;      SALMON GROWERS, LAWMAKERS ON CHILEAN OFFENSIVE
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Paul Kane  
 &HT;    c. 1998 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, June 3 -- Maine's lawmakers and fishermen argued
Wednesday that the state's Atlantic salmon industry is ``a shadow
of what it could be'' because of heavily subsidized Chilean imports
eating away at Mainers' profits.
</P>
<P>
   In a hearing before the International Trade Commission, the
delegation laid out a case for the alleged harm done to the salmon
industry caused by Chile's imported salmon, noting the decline in
Maine salmon producers from 19 companies to 10.
</P>
<P>
   But the Maine industry faced off with a well-financed opponent,
backed by Chile's salmon growers and various U.S. industries that
benefit from the imports of cheap salmon.
</P>
<P>
   For a hired gun, the opponents have brought in retired Senate
Majority Leader Bob Dole, who is a partner at the high-powered
Washington lobbying firm of Verner, Liipfert, Bernhard, McPherson
-- which is also the legal home of George Mitchell, the retired
majority leader from Maine. Mitchell, however, has not been
involved in the salmon case.
</P>
<P>
   Dole did not appear at Wednesday's hearing because he was in
Arizona for the funeral of Barry Goldwater, but in prepared
testimony he contended that ``there is no injury to the domestic
salmon industry caused by Chilean imports.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The imposition of tariffs (against Chile) would do far more
harm than good,'' added Dole, who was representing American
Airlines, United Airlines and the National Restaurant Association,
among others. The airlines benefit from flying Chile's salmon cargo
from South America up to Florida, where most of it is processed,
and the restaurants prefer buying cheap salmon.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the high-profile opposition, Maine's position received a
boost Tuesday from a U.S. Commerce Department final ruling that
found 38 companies from Chile did indeed ``dump'' its salmon on
U.S. markets at prices below market prices.
</P>
<P>
   It was not as widespread an indictment of the Chilean salmon
industry as Maine's fishermen would have liked, but that ruling set
in motion the process that could lead to anti-dumping duties
imposed on Chilean salmon, anywhere from $2.24 to $10.91 for every
$100 of salmon sent to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   For that to occur, the ITC must issue a ruling, due by July 15,
that the U.S. salmon industry has in fact been harmed by the salmon
dumping, otherwise the prices will remain the same despite the
Commerce decision.
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, Maine's representatives tried to hammer home
the point that the industry has suffered greatly from Chilean
dumping. ``I just can't go toe to toe with them,'' said Eric
Swanson, president of Trumpet Island Salmon Farm. ``It's important
to send a message out: you have to play fairly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This threat is very real, and deadly, to our industry,'' said
Sen. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, whose comments were echoed by Sen.
Susan Collins and Rep. John Baldacci.
</P>
<P>
   All three lawmakers noted that the salmon industry is the second
largest form of acquaculture in Maine, worth $44 million a year in
revenue, accounting for about 960 jobs in the economically
challenged Downeast counties of Washington and Hancock.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a place where good jobs are few, the salmon industry has
indeed been a blessing,'' Collins said, adding, ``This illegal
dumping makes the industry a shadow of what it could be.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Baldacci: ``The deck is stacked and the Chileans have the
stronger hand.''
</P>
<P>
   While demand for salmon has risen 100 percent this decade,
profits have fallen for U.S. salmon growers, 13 of which have
closed the past three years in Maine and Washington, the two states
that produce salmon.
</P>
<P>
   But Dole and other supporters of Chilean salmon say the domestic
industry focuses on producing whole salmons, while Chile focuses
sales on salmon filets, the product most responsible for boosting
U.S. demand for the fish. The domestic industry, they contend,
cannot keep up with the demand for filets, and Chilean salmon
growers should not be punished for finding a niche market.
</P>
<P>
   Further, Dole says there are 1,400 jobs in southern Florida
alone, 7,600 nationwide, directly related to distributing,
transporting and marketing Chilean salmon. Any duties imposed on
Chilean salmon would endanger those jobs. ``It would create
significant injury to other sectors of the U.S. economy, injury
that is far out of proportion to any beneficial impact derived by
(Maine salmon growers),'' Dole said.
</P>
<P>
   But Snowe disputed her former colleague, saying Maine's salmon
is just as good and could be easily substituted for Chilean filets
to meet the rising demand -- if everyone was on equal footing.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the day, we must ask: Who is winning, and at
whose expense?'' she said.

   NEW YORK _ Show houses in New York are generally not racially or
ethnically diverse, from the designers for whose works they are a
showcase to the ticket buyers who come by to gawk and sometimes
hire. The first Harlem United Show House, which opens Saturday and
will remain on view through July 3, however, aims to change that
situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time to show what we've been doing for all these years,''
said Roderick Shade, an interior decorator, who organized the show
house to raise funds for the Harlem United Community AIDS Center
and also to raise the visibility of African-American designers.
</P>
<P>
   Staged in an imposing brick and limestone 1906 town house at 459
West 141st Street, between Columbus and Amsterdam avenues, the show
house will present the work of 24 African-American designers. They
include Shade himself, who is paving a guest room's walls with
rough mosaic tiles, and Patsy Johnson, whose romantic roof garden
design employs Oriental motifs.
</P>
<P>
   For directions and information, the number is (212) 531-1300,
extension 415.

CHOOSING A SHREDDER 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Choosing among personal shredders depends upon how you intend to
use the machine and, more important, how much security you feel you
need.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT KIND OF MATERIAL DO YOU WANT TO SHRED? Junk mail, documents
from work, tax information? That determines the throat size
needed. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   HOW OFTEN DO YOU EXPECT TO USE IT? That will help you decide how
many sheets you want the machine to handle at once. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DOES IT MATTER WHICH TYPE OF CUT THE SHREDDER MAKES? Some
shredders cut paper in spaghetti-like strips, while others
cross-cut to make what resembles confetti.
</P>
<P>
   The portable Shredmaster Confidential from GBC, for example,
weighs two pounds and costs $24.99. It is good for shredding ATM
and credit card receipts, but a standard sheet of paper must be
folded in half before shredding. More practical for light use is
the company's best-selling model, the 40S, which sells for $29.99
and weighs four pounds.
</P>
<P>
   In an unscientific test, the unit performed nicely on up to
three stapled sheets of regular-sized paper, but it slowed when fed
four and five sheets. With the long, thin strips, your wastebasket
is likely to fill up quickly (a plus if you need packing material).
</P>
<P>
   If you believe those spaghetti strips could somehow be pieced
together, you can spend more for a cross-shredder, which reduces
your potentially revealing documents to tiny pieces of paper.
</P>
<P>
   Fellowes's Powershred PS60 CC, a cross-cutter that costs
$159.99, works like a paper tiger, chewing up to seven sheets at a
pass. The biggest drawback, however, is its size and weight _ it
weighs 18 pounds. It is hard to lift the shredder on and off the
wastebasket it comes with.
</P>
<P>
   Less impressive is the GBC 55X cross-cutter, which sells for
$99, weighs 12 pounds and is supposedly designed for up to three
sheets at a time. The machine works noticeably hard to make its
confetti. Two sheets are about as much as it can take before
getting stuck.
</P>
<P>
   Once the shredder sticks, you have to use the reverse and
forward buttons to free the paper. If that doesn't work, you have
to unplug it and turn it upside down for a good shake.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of getting stuck, all the shredders display warnings
regarding long hair, jewelry and ties: all candidates for getting
caught in the machines.

<TEXT>
<P>
   I don't usually hand out bold advice I wouldn't take myself.
Still, I was glad to hear the Manhattan Theater Club of New York
City, which has a reputation for presenting new plays and talent,
has decided to go ahead with a touchy play after getting threats
said to come from Catholic extremists.
</P>
<P>
   The play was fated for controversy. Details are sketchy. The New
York Times hears the play is about 13 gay men celebrating the
passion of Christ and sex is involved. Furious protests arrived
punctually, threatening death to playwright, theater staff and
actors. The play was canceled, then reinstated a week later after
intellectuals squawked censorship.
</P>
<P>
   Catholics are hardly alone in objecting when values are
affronted. Name an ethnic or religious group, and you'll find an
insult that cannot be trivialized out of existence. Blacks, the
Irish, the churched and unchurched, Jews, women, Asians, Hispanics,
gays, you name it, have lines that cannot be crossed. And the lines
are movable, one person's insult being another's political
correctness. I would not find a jolly parody of Auschwitz a
liberating aesthetic experience.
</P>
<P>
   As a response, violence raises the stakes far too many notches.
Art is judged by its content and moral underpinnings. If playwright
Terrence McNally has gone too far, he will be found out, and
rejected in the marketplace. The only lesson to be learned as
things now stand is that someone has invented the ultimate
heckler's veto.

   THE `MAGIC NUMBER'
</P>
<P>
   Q. I tried to grow sweet corn several years ago and failed
miserably. I have heard that you need a certain minimum of plants
so that they can cross-pollinate, a necessity for the plants to
yield corn. Is this true? What is that minimum number? Is it too
late to plant this year?
</P>
<P>
   A. No, it's not too late at all. Corn does best when planted in
warm soil and grown in hot weather. Then, ideally, just as the
ripening starts, nights will begin to cool off. Heat is great for
vegetative growth, but the plant will produce ears that have more
carbohydrates (including sugars) when temperatures are moderate.
</P>
<P>
   As far as pollination goes, your informant is on the right track
but not great on the specifics. Cross-pollination between varieties
usually results in starchy, bland corn, so different strains should
be separated, either by large distances or staggered ripening
times.
</P>
<P>
   Yet pollination itself is essential, and though each plant is
both male and female, corn plants don't fertilize themselves
because the two parts reach sexual maturity at slightly different
times. The ear is the female part. Each corn kernel on it is
attached to a strand of silk. A grain of pollen from a tassel, the
male part, must fall on it in order for that kernel to develop. The
pollen is shed over a period of several days, but each grain is
only viable for about four hours. So the trick is to be sure those
grains get a good wide distribution.
</P>
<P>
   You can't call in the bees for help; corn is pollinated by a
combination of wind and gravity, and that's where the ``minimum
number of plants'' comes in. It's not so much a matter of numbers
as it is of how they're arranged _ they should be in blocks rather
than single rows.
</P>
<P>
   You should have at least four rows 36 inches apart. That means
that a block will be nine feet on a side. So the plants should be
about 10 inches apart, with a total of 10 or 11 plants per row.
That may sound like a lot, but since two ears per stalk is average,
there isn't much point in planting less.
</P>
<P>
   GREENERY VS. TOXINS
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have read that certain houseplants are particularly
effective at removing toxic substances from the air. (Those
mentioned include the spider plant, English ivy and dracaena.) Is
there any truth to this?
</P>
<P>
   A. The most impressive tests of this hypothesis were conducted a
decade ago by NASA scientists. They put plants and pollutants
together in sealed containers and measured marked reductions in
gases, including formaldehyde, benzene and carbon dioxide.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the sealed environment is central to the effect.
Open a window, and the impressive results fly out of it. As
skeptics, including Robert Axelrad, senior policy adviser in the
indoor environments division of the Environmental Protection
Agency, have pointed out, it would probably take hundreds of plants
to refresh the air as well as proper ventilation does.
</P>
<P>
   Indoor air pollution is in large part caused by ``outgassing,''
the release of toxic substances by a host of common products. From
plywood to permanent-press fabrics, the synthetic rug to the
ceiling tiles, many furnishings of daily life constantly exude
chemicals like formaldehyde, xylene, toluene, ammonia and benzene.
Plants can remove small quantities of these from the air, but they
cannot stop the outgassing itself; so control at the source should
not be ignored. Score another point for natural fibers.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. B.C. Wolverton, an environmental engineer who worked on the
NASA studies, has retired from the space agency but continues his
research under the sponsorship of the nonprofit Plants for Clean
Air Council in Davidsonville, Md., an organization supported by the
houseplant industry.
</P>
<P>
   His enthusiastic but regrettably footnote-free ``How to Grow
Fresh Air'' (Penguin, 1996) lists 50 houseplants recommended for
their air-cleaning ability. He gives high marks for chemical vapor
removal to the Areca palm (Chrysalidocarpus lutescens), the rubber
plant (Ficus robusta) and the Gerbera daisy (Gerbera jamesonii), as
well as English ivy (Hedera helix) and a couple of dracaenas. The
spider plant is also in the book, but rather low on the list.
</P>
<P>
   EDIBLE OR POISONOUS?
</P>
<P>
   Q. If I plant edible plants like herbs next to plants that are
listed as poisonous, will the edible one still be safe to eat?
</P>
<P>
   A. Toxins being formed by growing plants don't migrate through
the soil and wouldn't be taken up by the neighbors even if they
did. And plants of different species do not cross-breed naturally.
So the short answer is sure, no problem.
</P>
<P>
   But there are a couple of things to watch out for:
cross-contamination, in which toxic plant parts fall on the
innocents next door, and skin rashes, known to doctors as contact
dermatitis.
</P>
<P>
   Cross-contamination is seldom a problem, since most poisonous
plants must be eaten _ or made into tea and drunk _ before they can
hurt you. But a few, including angels' trumpet (Datura), foxglove,
oleander and some lobelias are potentially so virulent you could be
sickened just by nectar or sap that fell on an adjacent edible and
didn't get washed off.
</P>
<P>
   Contact dermatitis is a lot more common. It would be so easy to
brush against an ornamental as you reach for the food. Allergic
reactions to plants vary widely, but many people get rashes from
such garden stalwarts as comfrey, spurge and feverfew, and I can
personally vouch for the devastating effects of the beautiful
blue-flowered Phacelia parryi.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, I'd say all bets are off if small children will be
visiting the garden. They might easily come to the wrong
conclusions if they saw pretty poison in the vegetable patch, and
they're a lot more likely to be seriously hurt if they make a
mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Address questions to Garden Q&AMP;A, The New York Times, 229 West
43rd St., New York, N.Y. 10036, or by e-mail to

FAN WANTS HARTMAN THE PLANET FOR PHIL THE STAR
</HEADLINE>

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bill O'Reed of Lancaster, Ohio, thinks the world of Phil
Hartman, the late comedian-actor.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, O'Reed wants a world named for the former ``Saturday
Night Live'' performer who died a week ago in a murder-suicide.
</P>
<P>
   O'Reed's Phil Hartman Tribute (www.maggie-roo.com/phil) asks
that visitors to his site write to their congressional
representatives and suggest ``Phil'' or ``Hartman'' as names for a
planet recently discovered by the Hubble Space Telescope.
</P>
<P>
   The planet, known as TMR-1C, was officially announced May 28,
the day Hartman was found dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be coincidence, but the planet was found near the same
time a star dimmed on Earth,'' O'Reed said. ``It may sound quirky,
but it would be a great tribute.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Reed's page is one of several sites official and unofficial
that pay tribute to Hartman and his work.
</P>
<P>
   A rundown of some of the others:
</P>
<P>
   Chip Howland's Phil-Hartman-izer
(www.skypoint.com/members/howland/hartman.html) translates any text
into coded swear words that Hartman made up as a child.
</P>
<P>
   Brian LeBail's The Phil Hartman Show
(www.geocities.com/Hollywood/6422/hartman.html) features sound
files of Hartman from ``NewsRadio'' and ``SNL.''
</P>
<P>
   Phil Hartman, Man of 1,000 Voices and Faces
(members.aol.com/kathster1) has an image gallery and an online
guest book.
</P>
<P>
   Hartman fans can get a biography and a collection of his work on
these sites, or they can turn to official sites set up by NBC's
``NewsRadio'' and ``SNL'' or Fox's ``The Simpsons.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Reed's site might be the most complete Hartman tribute, with
images, sound files, links, guest book and chat options. O'Reed
said he admired Hartman's talent and character.
</P>
<P>
   ``I design Web pages for many different people, and this time, I
designed one from the heart _ for Phil,'' O'Reed said.

<P>
   (Undated) - Peter Zwagerman staggered from the river and
collapsed in a heap.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when I just started trembling,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The ``post-adrenaline syndrome'' of kayaking had spent his
energy that day in 1986, when Zwagerman experienced the Santa Rita
Hole on the Animas River in Durango, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to exit the hole _ an area formed by water rushing over a
rock or obstruction _ by turning upside down and putting his paddle
into the current rolling downstream didn't work. Zwagerman
eventually managed to escape by rocking back and forth, and finally
out of the raging current.
</P>
<P>
   Zwagerman is no amateur when it comes to kayaking. As the owner
of Tempe's Permagrin Canoeing and Kayaking School, he knows the
thrill and the risk of running white water. He coined the term
``post-adrenaline syndrome'' after experiencing the rush of
kayaking and the letdown that follows.
</P>
<P>
   This year was especially good for the sport after El Nino rains
fed Arizona waterways, notably the upper Salt River.
</P>
<P>
   ``The upper Salt River Canyon is probably one of the premier
river runs in the Southwest. It's absolutely beautiful,'' said Paul
Tuohy, president of the Central Arizona Paddlers Club.
</P>
<P>
   Another prime kayaking spot in Arizona is the Verde River near
Camp Verde, where the white-water season usually runs from February
to April.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot of fun. Boy, it's fun,'' Zwagerman said.
</P>
<P>
   When Arizona's rivers become too shallow, many kayakers chase
white water around the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of boaters who live for the river. They're going
from river to river,'' said Nancy ``Kanu'' Kaplan, owner of
Phoenix's Canyons &AMP; Coastlines Kayak School.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the season on the upper Salt River is winding to a
close, kayakers' next big event is Animas River Days on June 27 and
28 in Durango.
</P>
<P>
   Other kayaking destinations are the Green River in Utah, the
Lochsa in Idaho, the Kern in California and the Rio Grande in New
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Kayakers do all that traveling for one reason: The sport is too
much fun to pass up.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Murbach of Scottsdale, Ariz., lives in a small house and
drives an old car so she can spend her money on kayaking trips.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kayaking is a blast,'' Kaplan said.
</P>
<P>
   What makes white water such a rush is playing in the water in
the highly maneuverable boats.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easier to do the trick moves in a shorter, flatter
boat,'' Zwagerman said.
</P>
<P>
   Those moves might include surfing a wave or standing the boat
vertically in the current.
</P>
<P>
   White-water kayaking presents a physical and mental challenge
for its practitioners.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I'm out on the water, I don't think about anything else.
It's very intense, but not in a dangerous way. It's intense in a
stimulating way,'' Zwagerman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's challenging. It's a place where I can enjoy myself and
benefit from the rewards of being challenged.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides running fast water, kayakers can choose touring or sea
kayaking. Touring is peaceful paddling that takes boaters along a
lake's shoreline or on relatively flat river water. Sea kayakers
have to reckon with waves and swells.
</P>
<P>
   Training is important in all types of kayaking, but it's
imperative with white water. A river can kill a kayaker.
</P>
<P>
   Water is rated from Class 1 to Class 6, ranging from flat water
easily navigated to water that is unrunnable and could mean death
for anyone who tries. Kayakers who run Class 5 rapids push the
envelope.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of rapid would likely contain ``hydraulics'' that can
suck in kayaks and not let go.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rivers have all kinds of hazards,'' Kaplan said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those are visible, such as when a horizon line suddenly
appears. That means a drop is ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We pull over and look at it. An everyday Joe will just run it
and get into trouble,'' Kaplan said.
</P>
<P>
   About a year of hard work and training is required to become
proficient at paddling, Tuohy said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably the hardest thing is developing the mental end of it,
knowing that you can roll back up when you flip over,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Flipping over and having to execute an Eskimo roll to right the
craft is an inevitable part of white-water kayaking.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know you're going to get flipped over eventually,'' Tuohy
said. ``It's not a bad thing. It's kind of fun, especially when
it's hot out.''
</P>
<P>
   Beginning white-water kayakers should start with at least 15
hours of flat-water training, learning moves such as the Eskimo
roll and basic strokes. Then they can move up to slow moving water
to learn peel outs, eddy turns, ferrying, and side and bow surfing,
Zwagerman said.
</P>
<P>
   How to read and swim moving water, basic river safety and
running a river with a group of people are other must-learn topics.
</P>
<P>
   Intermediate instruction takes kayakers to Class 3 white water.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's certainly a large level of skill involved,'' Tuohy
said.
</P>
<P>
   Having the right equipment is another requirement. Kaplan
remembers one man running the upper Salt River who strapped a
mixing bowl to his head and called it a helmet.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `I'm not going to pay no $65 for a helmet,' '' she
said. ``We see the wacko-est people up there.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting started in kayaking will cost about $1,000 to $1,500 for
a boat, paddle, spray skirt, life jacket, wet suit and helmet.
</P>
<P>
   A life jacket is a critical piece of equipment, Tuohy said, and
a kayaker needs to have one that can be depended on to float.
</P>
<P>
   ``Always buy a new life jacket,'' he said. &QL;

   450&AMP;ADD  CHRISTIAN COALITION CAMPAIGNING
HARD FOR SCHOOL PRAYER AMENDMENT
 &HT;     By EUNICE MOSCOSO 
 &HT;     c.1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With a vote scheduled Thursday on a constitutional
amendment to guarantee school prayer in public schools, the
Christian Coalition has stepped up its campaign in favor of the
measure.
</P>
<P>
   The religious organization this week distributed hundreds of
thousands of church bulletins urging constituents to call their
leaders in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, they are targeting 50 congressional districts with
phone calls, radio ads and 150,000 postcards _ some of which accuse
opponents of religious bigotry.
</P>
<P>
   Arne Owens, spokesperson for the Christian Coalition, said the
amendment is one of the group's highest priorities because
intolerance of religion is spreading throughout society, not just
in schools.
</P>
<P>
   Owens cites a case in which a judge was not allowed to display
the Ten Commandments in a courtroom, and another in which a menorah
was not allowed as a decoration on a government building's lawn.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see it all over,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents say a constitutional amendment is a first step in
changing the social climate.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, introduced by Rep. Ernest Istook, R-Okla., states
that ``the people's right to pray and to recognize their religious
beliefs, heritage or traditions on public property, including
schools, shall not be infringed.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's vote will be the first of its kind in 27 years. A
similar amendment fell 28 votes short of the needed two-thirds
approval in the House in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the measure _ including President Clinton _ say
voluntary prayer is already allowed in public schools.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, many fear that the amendment would lead to a
majority religion being imposed on schoolchildren, and to
government intervention in religious activities.
</P>
<P>
   Leading the opposition in the House is Rep. Chet Edwards,
D-Texas, whose district includes Baylor University, one of the
nation's leading Baptist colleges.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of his stance, Edwards has been the topic of one of
the coalition's mail campaigns. In a postcard sent this week to his
constituents, the coalition accuses him of trying to silence people
of faith.
</P>
<P>
   The postcard states: ``The Edwards bigotry directed at
Christians and other people of faith is outrageous and must be
stopped.''
</P>
<P>
   Edwards said the postcards are ludicrous and hateful.
</P>
<P>
   ``I respect the Christian Coalition's right to support an
amendment, but their tactics of accusing Istook opponents of
religious bigotry smacks of old-time McCarthyism,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows how far the far right has gone when it is now
anti-American to defend the Bill of Rights,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Many members said Wednesday they remained undecided.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards said he is not surprised at that, because the measure is
politically sensitive. He said several of his colleagues have told
him they would vote for the measure because they know it won't
pass.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   In Edwards' district, more than 100 pastors are involved in the
public awareness campaign to support the amendment, according to
Joe Carbajal, who works with the Christian Coalition in central
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Carbajal, pastor of the non-denominational Mighty Wind Worship
Center in Waco, said the amendment will ensure that children won't
be punished for practicing their religion at school.
</P>
<P>
   But opponents say motives behind the measure are not
ideological, but political. They say it will give the far right a
chance to paint their opponents as ``voting against God.''
</P>
<P>
   The vote will be featured on the Christian Coalition's voting
scorecard, which will be distributed to members later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards said the tactics are backfiring.
</P>
<P>
   On the postcard distributed to Edwards' district, the coalition
says ``his attitudes have no place in Texas or anywhere in
America.''
</P>
<P>
   Edwards said this kind of intolerance is exactly why he opposes
the amendment.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've made my point,'' he said.

`STEEP CREEKING' TAKES SPORT TO NEW EXTREME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JULIE NEWBERG  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) - Brian Tuten could easily be classified as an
extremist. He runs waterfalls in a kayak.
</P>
<P>
   There's a term for this move, and it's not crazy, suicidal or
nuts. It's called ``steep creeking.''
</P>
<P>
   Waterfalls are a bit more than steep creeks, especially when the
tallest Tuten has run is 38 feet, at Little River Canyon in
Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   Not many steep creeks exist in Arizona, though there is talk of
the ``Monsoon Warriors,'' a group of kayakers that runs washes
during summer rains.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's more a legend than anything,'' said Peter Zwagerman,
owner of Arizona's Permagrin Canoeing and Kayaking School.
</P>
<P>
   Steep creekers do their sport with a wide kayak that carries
more air than smaller models. That extra buoyancy coupled with
rounded ends on the bow and stern make landing relatively safe.
</P>
<P>
   Note the word ``relative.'' Tuten is an expert kayaker who has
built skills to enable him to do such moves in a tiny boat. He
still runs the risk of broken legs, ribs or worse every time he
does it.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the thrill of running waterfalls draws him to the sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doing the steep creeking is the ultimate adrenaline rush,''
Tuten said. ``You can never know too much. I'm always learning.''
</P>
<P>
   Landing perfectly at the bottom in super-aerated water is ``like
landing on a pillow,'' Tuten said.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Murbach of Scottsdale, Ariz., recently returned from a
trip to Mexico where she ran waterfalls.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was one that was 23 feet. That was the highest one,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Proper waterfall-jumping technique includes keeping the paddle
up and away from the face, leaning back slightly to keep balanced
in the boat and putting the boat into the water at 45 degrees.
Landing flat could result in back injuries, Murbach said.
</P>
<P>
   After landing, the kayaker could get caught in the flow at the
bottom.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one that we did on the bigger river, the hydraulic was
interesting because it took you under water and spun you around a
little,'' Murbach said. &QL;

AMERICAN ARTIST LEAVES GERMAN HOLOCAUST PROJECT 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ The American sculptor Richard Serra has
abruptly pulled out of a project to design a massive and
much-debated Holocaust memorial in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   Serra, who had teamed up with the American architect Peter
Eisenmann to submit a design that was strongly favored by Germany's
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, said he had quit for ``personal and
professional reasons'' that ``had nothing to do with the merits of
the project.''
</P>
<P>
   The surprising announcement by Serra, whose giant abstract works
have both enraptured and infuriated people for the last several
decades, was yet another twist in the tortuous efforts by German
leaders to build a memorial to Jewish victims on land at the heart
of Hitler's Third Reich, almost on top of the line where the Berlin
Wall once stood.
</P>
<P>
   Though Kohl and other German leaders had hoped to build a
memorial to the Holocaust in Berlin by the time the city resumes
its role next year as the capital of the reunited Germany, the
project has been bedeviled by philosophical and political battles
at every turn.
</P>
<P>
   Though German leaders have not officially decided on a design,
the proposal by Serra and Eisenmann, one of four competing designs,
has been the clear favorite of Kohl and of the nonprofit
organization that has led the decade-long effort to build a
memorial.
</P>
<P>
   As envisioned by the two Americans, the memorial would feature a
forbidding labyrinth of 4,000 huge pillars that would sprawl over
an area of 180,000 square feet. It would be located between
Berlin's Brandenburg Gate and Potsdamer Platz, the huge new
commercial and office complex being built on what used to be the
no-man's-land between East and West Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   Much like the years of debate in the United States over building
the memorial to Vietnam veterans in Washington, the proposed Berlin
memorial has engendered endless argument and infighting over both
details and fundamental philosophical issues.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, German leaders almost selected an entirely separate
design for the memorial that consisted of a huge tilting slab of
concrete that was to have been covered with the names of 4.2
million known victims of the Holocaust. Kohl vetoed that design in
1996 and a new competition led to the selection of the four
competing designs, including that of Serra and Eisenmann.
</P>
<P>
   But the arguments did not end. Many critics argued that the
design should include names of victims, as well as the numbers of
people killed and the places where the killings occurred. Several
months ago, a group of leading German intellectuals, including
Germany's best-known writer, Guenter Grass, argued that the
monument should be abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   The opponents of a memorial argued that no artistic monument
could faithfully represent the full horror of the Holocaust, and
that the new monument would be an ``abstract installation of
oppressively gigantic proportions'' that would be ``neither a
witness to the past nor a sign to the future.'' The letter said the
memorial should include other groups persecuted by the Nazis, such
as Gypsies, homosexuals, Soviet prisoners of war and the disabled.
Others are proposing that instead of building a monument, Berlin
should rename Potsdamer Platz ``Juden Platz'' or ``Jews' Place.''
</P>
<P>
   It remained unclear on Wednesday whether Serra's unexpected
withdrawal would lead to further delays in the memorial. In a
statement issued by Serra's dealer, the Gagosian Gallery in SoHo,
the sculptor said he continued to support the design. Eisenmann
said he would proceed on his own and that the design was nearly
complete.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``As far as we're concerned, the project is more than either
Richard Serra or Peter Eisenmann,'' the architect said. ``In 50
years, nobody will remember who the artist and the architect
were,'' Eisenmann added, dismissing the matter as ``a tempest in a
teapot.''
</P>
<P>
   Lea Rosh, head of the nonprofit organization that has lobbied
for a Holocaust museum since 1988, said Serra's decision would not
cause a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is important is that Eisenmann stands by his proposal and
that his design is finally put on display,'' Ms. Rosh said on
Wednesday
</P>
<P>
   A decision on the memorial has already been delayed for several
months, and proponents are now hoping to reach a final agreement by
the end of June. But Kohl is still insisting on numerous changes,
though Eisenmann has indicated he can accommodate the requests.
</P>
<P>
   Berlin's mayor, Eberhard Diepgen, remains opposed to all of the
final four designs and is supposed to have a say in the ultimate
decision. Diepgen, who has been lukewarm about the project all
along, recently questioned whether any monument could ``deal with
this horror artistically.''

CYBERSPACE GURU JOHN PERRY BARLOW GOES TO COLLEGE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NATHAN COBB  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE _ John Perry Barlow is walking slowly and almost
daintily along John F. Kennedy Street near Harvard Square, as if
his black cowboy boots are too tight. ``Have you ever had a sake
hangover?'' he asks, his sandpaper voice a few grades coarser than
normal.
</P>
<P>
   When his companion allows as how he can't remember, Barlow
scowls darkly. ``If you'd had one,'' he announces, ``you'd
remember.''
</P>
<P>
   Such is life in meatspace, which is how Barlow, the 50-year-old
Internet guru and techno-libertarian who used to raise cows in
Wyoming and write songs for the Grateful Dead, refers to the
nonvirtual world. Lately much of his own time in meatspace  &UR; xr &LR; has
been spent at Harvard University, where he recently completed an
associate fellowship at the Kennedy School of Government's
Institute of Politics before landing a similar gig at the Harvard
Law School's Berkman Center for Internet and Society. ``If I'm not
younger, smarter, and better-looking by the time I leave here, I
haven't taken advantage of the situation,'' he muses.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't feel this way a few months ago. ``He expected people
here to be closed-minded and arrogant,'' says Berkman Center
professor Lawrence Lessig, a cutting-edge scholar on cyberspace and
the law. ``But he didn't find that at all.''
</P>
<P>
   What he found instead was that he could wander into a place like
Grendel's Restaurant &AMP; Bar in Harvard Square for dinner, make some
new friends among the graduate students hanging out there, and
repair to a dorm room for some long hours of conversation while
knocking back a few glasses of that sake.
</P>
<P>
   ``My preconceptions of Harvard students, based on visits here
during the 1960s and '70s, are no longer valid,'' Barlow says.
``The culture has changed considerably. It's a true meritocracy
now. The reason people are here is because they're smart and
they're diligent in applying their intelligence, not because eight
generations of their forebears came here and they know exactly how
to get their clothes fitted at Brooks Brothers.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; if,,.07l &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In addition to this glowing report card, Harvard is getting what
Lessig _ who is also the court-appointed ``special master'' in the
US government's antitrust suit against Microsoft Corp. _ calls ``a
towering figure in the first generation of thinking about how to
deal with cyberspace.'' The university is also experiencing what he
terms a ``Wyoming/Republican character,'' something of a Robert
Preston look-alike who rides a motorcycle while spitting out the
word ``government'' as if it were an unexpected chicken bone.
</P>
<P>
   Ironic, isn't it, that Barlow this year found himself holding
court at one of the country's foremost schools of government? ``Oh,
there's plenty of irony there,'' answers the cofounder of the
Electronic Frontier Foundation, a group that promotes freedom of
expression in digital media and has been major thorn in the side of
the US government whenever it has tried to put a leash on
cyberspace. ``But I love irony. I mean, I'd like to dramatically
reduce the number of lawyers in the world and here I am at a school
of law.''
</P>
<P>
   Here he is indeed, dressed typically in black _ invariably
including a scarf _ a cyberitic Paul Revere riding to warn the
populace of the danger of those redcoats down in Washington. (He
usually votes for ``one wing nut or another'' in national
elections, he says.) In the course of several conversations, the
self-described ``old hippie,'' registered Republican, and divorced
father of three daughters comes across as insightful, combative,
articulate, grandiose, charming, holier-than-thou, egotistical, and
self-effacing. At one moment he declares, ``I think I have the same
sense of inevitability that Marx must have had all the time because
I'm so certain I'm right about a lot of this stuff.'' But remember
that he's also &UR;  &LR; been known to refer to what he does as ``cyberspace
jiving.''
</P>
<P>
   And listen, you want irony? One of America's most wired
individuals _ this high-profile writer, lecturer, and consultant on
digital media _ often scribbles messages to himself not on a
personal digital assistant (PDA) but on the palm of his hand.
``This is the original PDA,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Barlow's rants and raves are nothing if not strongly felt. He
rants against television, suburbia, and especially government
regulation of communications. (The only way in which the federal
government should possibly mess with the Net, he says, is by wiring
public libraries.) Meanwhile, he raves about the value of
close-knit communities, whether they exist in cyberspace or
meatspace. Regarding this particular belief he is likely to fall
back on Friedrich Nietzsche, declaring solemnly that ``sin is that
which separates.''
</P>
<P>
   But he can also sound like Hunter Thompson, particularly when he
declares, say, that the US government is no longer a democracy but
has become ``government by hallucinating mob, driven mad by
television.'' There's some Timothy Leary in there too: ``I've been
trying to expand consciousness by whatever means are available to
me, whether it's writing Grateful Dead songs or trying to wire the
consciousness of the planet with the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   To borrow from a Dead song Barlow didn't write, ``What a long
strange trip it's been.'' ``When I was growing up, one could
imagine being a fireman or a businessman or a movie star, or
whatever,'' he says. ``One could not have imagined being an
Internet guru.''
</P>
<P>
   The only child of third-generation Wyoming cattle ranchers,
Barlow was a devoted Mormon until the age of 14, whereupon he lost
his faith and found a motorcycle. His father, who was president of
the state Senate and also ran the powerful statewide cattle
association, was so unimpressed that he shipped the boy off to prep
school in Colorado. Young Barlow later majored in comparative
religion at Wesleyan University in Connecticut, avoided the
military draft by forging a letter from a doctor, wrote poetry, and
spent a year in India. He then set off for San Francisco to become
what he calls, borrowing from a Rolling Stones song, ``an under
assistant West Coast promotion man'' in the recording business.
</P>
<P>
   He never got there. The 7,000-acre Bar Cross Land &AMP; Livestock
Co., his family's spread in tiny Pinedale, Wyo., (population: about
1,200) was having management difficulties, so he decided to spend
six months straightening matters out. He stayed 17 years. He not
only raised cows and calves, but also, as he puts it, ``developed a
reputation as a place where you could send your highly potentiated
but basically miscreant kid'' to work. (John F. Kennedy Jr., he
says, came for a while in 1978.) He became county chairman of the
Republican Party and lost a race for state Senate by a single vote.
He also began writing tunes with an old prep school buddy, Bob Weir
of the Grateful Dead. Over a two-decade period, he would co-write
more than a dozen songs that would be recorded by the Dead, the
best known _ and his personal favorite _ being ``Cassidy.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time Barlow sold the Bar Cross in 1987, he'd found
cyberspace. He landed there after learning that hard-core Grateful
Dead fans, a.k.a. Deadheads, were communing together on ARPANET,
later known as the Internet. He'd purchased an early Compaq
computer that ``looked like a sewing machine,'' and when he first
went on line he was astounded by what he found:
</P>
<P>
   ``I said to myself, `Whoa, this is like a small town. This is
like a restoration of everything I care about. This is not
televisionland. This is not suburbia. This is the beginning of
another future.' That's what I thought. And I was right.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't misunderstand. It's not like it's a substitute for a
community. I mean, it ain't no Amish barn-raising. But it is a
means to a real connection, so that people can come together in
cyberspace and break through the tension of separation. See, my
purpose in life is to connect everything to everything else, to
make people understand that we are one and that there is no such
thing as being alone.''
</P>
<P>
   There was something else that attracted Barlow to cyberspace,
something more practical. ``I felt,'' he says, ``that I could
become as much an expert on it as anyone, and pretty quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   So he did. He became a writer, lecturer, consultant, and
pontificator. He was the first person to popularize the term
``cyberspace'' to refer to the nexus of computer and
telecommunications networks. (Although science fiction writer
William Gibson apparently coined the word.) He helped fire up the
Electronic Frontier Foundation. He wrote the much-circulated
``Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace,'' thereby
declaring a new ``civilization of the mind.'' He gained a
reputation as a Net hypester as well as a Net hipster, someone who
saw limitless good in cyberspace. It's an estimation of himself he
finds inaccurate. ``To say that the Internet is going to bring
nothing but good is like saying the weather is going to bring
nothing but good,'' he fusses.
</P>
<P>
   At Harvard's Kennedy School earlier this semester, he taught a
weekly study group called Cyberspace vs. Meatspace and participated
eagerly in the social aspects of a fellowship program one staff
member described as ``an intellectual Club Med.'' (His duties at
the Law School have yet to be defined by the administration.
Yesterday Barlow himself declared his title to be ``Emissary and
Gadfly.'') He talked, as he often does, about the inevitable fall
of the world's federal-level governments, about the rise of a kind
of libertarian Net Nation, and especially about how the new
information economy will totally renegotiate the planet's current
power relationships.
</P>
<P>
   ``For example, look at the relationship between men and women,''
he says. ``Traditionally, women have been economically unempowered.
But women are naturally advantaged (in cyberspace) because they
know about relationships and consensus-making. They aren't
physically disadvantaged, because strength doesn't matter. And they
aren't threatened, because they're separated physically. So I think
women will do pretty well in cyberspace.''
</P>
<P>
   So will John Perry Barlow. He already has.

DAVIS DEFEATS BIG MONEY, FACES LUNGREN IN BIG FOR GOVERNORSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT SALLADAY and ZACHARY COILE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Lt. Gov. Gray Davis grabbed a victory few would
have envisioned three months ago, trouncing the best-financed
gubernatorial candidates in U.S. history to win the Democratic
nomination and the chance to take on the Republican candidate,
Attorney General Dan Lungren.
</P>
<P>
   Dismissed by political insiders as too dull, Davis ran a steady
campaign built on a powerful slogan _ ``Experience money can't
buy.''
</P>
<P>
   Bland ambition defeated two wealthy Democratic challengers,
former Northwest Airlines co-chairman Al Checchi and U.S. Rep. Jane
Harman.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Davis campaign spent about $12 million, nearly a
record, Davis didn't come close to his rivals.
</P>
<P>
   The race for California governor has cost an astonishing $64
million so far, with five months to go before the general election.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday morning at the Biltmore Hotel in Los Angeles, the
losing candidates joined Davis to promise a united front against
Lungren.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a strong, united party that is headed for victory in
November,'' Davis said. ``I'm very proud to head a strong ticket
that's going to win from top to bottom.''
</P>
<P>
   Harman said, ``Gray, you won a stunning victory yesterday. You
are going to lead our state to prosperity in the 21st century.''
</P>
<P>
   Checchi praised Davis' ``wealth of experience, intelligence and
tenacity.'' But when asked whether he would support Davis
financially, Checchi responded curtly, ``Next question.''
</P>
<P>
   He later stormed out of the hotel, declining to answer
questions.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, after the outcome was clear, Davis told a
cheering crowd of supporters, ``My friends, this is truly an
experience money can't buy.''
</P>
<P>
   During his expensive campaign, Checchi promised dramatic change,
but his message failed to resonate in a state experiencing
prosperity. Harman ran as the only woman in the race, but her
reliance on gender politics seemed dated.
</P>
<P>
   Davis sold his government experience, and it seemed like the
right message in this state of 33 million.
</P>
<P>
   Davis captured 35 percent of the vote, while Checchi received
almost 13 percent and Harman 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Lungren, the Republican, tallied 34 percent. Tuesday's primary
was the first in which California voters could cast a ballot for
any candidate, regardless of party affiliation.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Gov. Pete Wilson, who has served two terms, was
barred from seeking another term.
</P>
<P>
   It was a remarkable victory for the Bronx-born Davis, who
survived the removal of a benign brain tumor 14 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Just three months ago, Davis looked destined for political
obscurity, after a solid but uninspired 24-year career as state
assemblyman, controller and, since 1995, lieutenant governor.
</P>
<P>
   Longtime Democrats didn't take his fund-raising calls, reporters
largely ignored him and early in the campaign, he didn't have
enough money to run television commercials. He was behind in the
polls. Even former California Republican Chairman John Herrington
was encouraging Republicans to vote for Davis so Lungren would face
a weak opponent in November.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his two well-financed Democratic opponents, Davis
captured a higher percentage of the popular vote Tuesday than
Lungren, who ran nearly $5 million in biographical commercials who
faced only token opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``You defied the experts,'' Davis told jubilant supporters at
the Biltmore. ``You proved the pundits wrong, and you know what? I
think we're gonna win again in November!''
</P>
<P>
   An exit poll conducted by the Los Angeles Times found Davis also
benefited from the $20 million effort to defeat Proposition 226,
which would have restricted the use of union dues for political
lobbying.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever an anti-226 phone bank worker called up a potential
voter during the past few weeks, the campaign worker also reminded
people to vote for Davis. The AFL-CIO produced a campaign brochure
for Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Checchi bet nearly $40 million that he could win the nomination
by appealing to the state's surging numbers of independent voters,
moderate Republicans and Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, voters went for the familiar _ a longstanding liberal
Democrat and a conservative Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Although Davis and Lungren both plan breaks, the November
campaign is expected to begin right away. In some ways, it already
has.
</P>
<P>
   Lungren is anxious to associate Davis with the last Democratic
governor, Jerry Brown, who was elected Oakland's mayor Tuesday.
Davis worked as Brown's chief of staff, and he has repeatedly
mentioned his old boss on the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   ``He obviously thinks it's important to be identified with Jerry
Brown,'' Lungren said. ``If that's what he wants, then fine. I'll
be happy to acknowledge that.''
</P>
<P>
   Each candidate carries enough political baggage from a combined
44 years of public service that the campaign could get ugly.
</P>
<P>
   While Lungren paints Davis as a bleeding-heart liberal aligned
with Jerry Brown, Davis will hit Lungren for his anti-abortion
stand and for questionable enforcement of the state's
assault-weapons law.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will have an honest, straightforward debate on the
issues,'' Lungren told cheering supporters in Newport Beach. ``We
will show two visions of California. ... Let's make sure that we
have a campaign that's based on issues, that talks about what the
people of California want to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Lungren already has asked for a series of debates with the
Democratic nominee.

`EVERYMAN': MORALITY MADE JUST A BIT TOO PRECIOUS

 By PETER MARKS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the Royal Shakespeare Company's revival of
``Everyman,'' the 15th-century morality play, Beauty wears one red
high heel, Strength sports a weight lifter's belt and Goods flashes
a wad of bills.
</P>
<P>
   They are among the allegorical figures who meet up with Everyman
on his journey to death, characters on whom the directors, Kathryn
Hunter and Marcello Magni, can't refrain from bestowing modernist
touches. Sometimes, the embellishment gets carried away, and it
appears as if the ghost of ``Godspell'' has arrived. ``This matter
is wondrous precious,'' a character observes, and given some of the
sillier bits of business _ like having Everyman's relatives speak
with Italian accents _ you think you know exactly what she means.
</P>
<P>
   Although the tinkering is, on the whole, restrained, it's too
bad that the company felt the need to toy at all with ``Everyman,''
which is being presented through Sunday at the Brooklyn Academy of
Music's Majestic Theater. What's best about the piece, popular with
college theater groups and medievalists alike, is its stark
simplicity; the primitive directness puts you in mind of a
children's play.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the work, believed to have been written around the time
Columbus discovered the New World, was unusual among the English
morality plays of the period, like ``The Castle of Perseverance''
and ``Mankind,'' because it did not require the kind of elaborate
costume or scenery changes to which audiences 500 years ago had
grown accustomed.
</P>
<P>
   This version works well whenever the company takes its cue from
the past, and plays it straight. ``Everyman'' is a poignant story
about that task that puts us all on equal footing, coming to terms
with mortality. Upon receiving news of his fate from Death,
portrayed enchantingly by Josette Bushell-Mingo as a kind of virgin
deceiver, Everyman (Joseph Mydell) sets off on the adventure during
which he must undergo various trials and sacrifices before he can
achieve the state of grace.
</P>
<P>
   The play is mostly taken up with Everyman's struggles with
actors posing as embodiments of abstract concepts (Confession, Good
Deeds, Five Wits) who are either aids or impediments in his quest.
Often, the actors are encouraged not to trust the text, and they
search inappropriately for moments in which they can turn up the
volume. Some of their inventions are effective: Everyman's
back-slapping friend, Fellowship (the excellent Edward Woodall), is
accompanied by a two-piece band, and God (Paul Hamilton) is drolly
conjured as a stringy-haired curmudgeon.
</P>
<P>
   At other times, however, the conceits can seem transparent, Rosa
Maggiora's parched set places ``Everyman'' on the plateau of a
timeless, sunbaked sierra, where the minimal adornments include a
woodshed and, wholly unnecessarily, a Jesus figurine. (Yup, it's
about religion, we get it.)
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is enough of the sweetly unvarnished framework of
the play to sustain this ``Everyman'' as a humbly inviting
experience. The cast is uniformly nimble; Mydell is a dignified,
though at times a bit affected, Everyman. And despite the
late-20th-century padding, the play remains an absorbing window
into a creative mind of the late Middle Ages.
</P>

`FICTIONAL' WAR OF THE SEXES 
</HEADLINE>
  (gm) 
 By MARTIN ARNOLD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Why can't a woman write like a man? Or perhaps more precisely,
why is it perceived that in serious fiction male writers have
grander thoughts and crisper styles? Why do so many reviewers and
editors act as if male and female literary writers have genetically
staked out their own neighborhoods of vocabulary and concerns, like
street gangs?
</P>
<P>
   These questions were the talk of book publishing last week
because of a critical essay in the June issue of Harper's magazine
by Francine Prose which asked, ``Are Women Writers Really
Inferior?''
</P>
<P>
   That question has passionately concerned serious female writers
since they began publishing their work. Hence, the male pseudonyms
George Sand and George Eliot.
</P>
<P>
   For female writers of literary fiction, the implications of the
question whiz by dangerously, as Ms. Prose pointed out. Perhaps
most important historically was, who is doing the judging of
literature in general? Which led naturally to, who decided that the
subjects women mostly wrote about (before their breakout in the
workplace) and still often write about _ domestic issues, love _
are of less consequence then the depth of thought produced by male
writers?
</P>
<P>
   In short, who determined the difference in importance between a
woman's inner or outer life and a man's? The answer, until recently
at least, has been men.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Prose attacked the perception that there is a discernible
womanly prose style, which is emotional and sentimental, for
instance, as opposed to the more muscular cadence of sentences by
men.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Galassi, editor-in-chief at Farrar Straus &AMP; Giroux,
which publishes much literary fiction, tends to agree that often
such generalizations about writing style are nonsense. ``There's
all those male weepers out there writing, who tend to be very
sentimental about themselves,'' he said. ``When you read Pat
Barker'' _ the award-winning English fiction writer _ ``you can't
tell her gender unless you have the title page in front of you. A
great author is usually recognized as great.''
</P>
<P>
   Why is all this important other than as a cerebral exercise?
Because it all gets back to what is important in any business,
including that of making books: cash.
</P>
<P>
   The success of a literary novel most often depends on the high
wire of reviews, which in turn helps feed word-of-mouth. So good
reviews for a first novel can mean that the writer will more easily
get a second novel published with a higher advance. From that seed,
a career can be born that can make money for both the author and
the publisher. (Literary prizes also help, and Ms. Prose feels
women get shorted on those too.)
</P>
<P>
   Book publishing at the editorial level is largely dominated by
women. And The New York Review of Books has a woman co-editor, and
the editors of The Washington Post and Chicago Tribune weekly book
review sections are women.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, despite this woman power, Ms. Prose had statistics
to show that more literary fiction written by men was reviewed than
that written by women, and that indeed more actual reviews of books
in the weekly journals were written by men than by women.
(Moreover, she was critical of The New Yorker and Harper's magazine
for printing many more short stories written by men than women.)
</P>
<P>
   All this criticism despite the fact that most people in
publishing believe that more literary fiction is still written by
men than women. The evidence, however, is largely inferential.
</P>
<P>
   The Harper's essay was particularly critical of The New York
Times Book Review and The New York Review of Books for the
discrepancy between the number of books of literary fiction written
by men or women and the number that were actually reviewed, and by
the disparity between the number of reviews written by men compared
to the number by women. The Times was also criticized for not
giving serious fiction by women enough prominence in its ``editor's
choice'' selections.
</P>
<P>
   This Sunday The Times Book Review is reviewing seven works of
fiction, five by men and two by women. Three of the seven books are
reviewed by women, including the cover review, which was written by
Ms. Prose. Three of the four books topping The Times's hardcover
fiction best-seller list this Sunday were written by women,
including Anna Quindlen's ``Black and Blue'' (Random House), which
is No. 4 and decidedly literary fiction. Last Sunday The Times
reviewed six works of fiction, three by women. Three of the
reviewers were women.
</P>
<P>
   But that's two weeks in many, and Charles McGrath, editor of The
Times Book Review, said that the number of women reviewers ``is
roughly in proportion to the number of women writers, not that we
say a woman has to review a woman writer's book.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that ``we are aware of what appears to be a pattern of
more male reviewers, and we don't think it's a good one and we are
trying to examine our decisions to be sure we are not falling into
the pattern.'' He added that ``when we pick the best books we try
to judge them on their merits.''
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Epstein, co-editor of the New York Review of Books, said
that ``I hate to comment. I like Francine. To refute it would take
many hours of work.'' Repeated attempts over nearly three days to
get comment from her co-editor, Robert B. Silvers, failed. But the
June 11 issue had 16 contributors, five of them women. There were
26 reviews and articles, with eight of them reviews of books
written by or articles about women. Included was a review of the
Nobel laureate Toni Morrison's ``Paradise'' (Knopf). In the issue
dated May 28 all 12 contributors were men.
</P>
<P>
   If Ms. Prose is correct, is it because of prejudice or even lack
of attention? No to the first, perhaps yes to the second. Nina
King, editor of The Washington Post Book World, said: ``I think we
are guilty but not intentionally. It's probably a very complicated
psychological predilection, coming from our whole culture. There
are still more men in power and influence and it probably trickles
down to what we review and who reviews.'' She said that several
years ago her review conducted an ``informal count of male versus
female, of blacks, of all minorities, and females were way
under-represented as authors and reviewers. We decided the only way
to correct it was to be more conscious of the problem, and I hope
we succeeded.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, despite such good intentions, many women authors of
serious fiction are outraged at what they perceive to be their
treatment in book review journals, and one woman connected to a
most prestigious review weekly said that she was sure there
remained in reviewland the attitude toward women that the Jack
Nicholson character expressed in the movie ``As Good as It Gets.''
The actor, playing the part of a grumpy writer, when asked by a
literary groupie how he managed to write so knowingly about women
replied: ``I think about a man, and I take away reason and
accountability.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ These are sweet times for the Roundabout Theater
Company, the comeback kid of Off Broadway and Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years after filing for bankruptcy, 15 years after voting
to close its doors only to escape extinction by a last-minute gift,
a company that staged its first plays in a supermarket basement
with 150 seats has become a producing powerhouse, the nation's
second biggest nonprofit theater after Lincoln Center's.
</P>
<P>
   It has three hits on Broadway, many new productions in the
wings, an annual audience of 400,000 and a blanketing presence at
this Sunday's Tony Awards ceremony, much of which is credited to a
management-trained artistic director whose only performing
experience was the title role in a P.S. 6 kindergarten version of
``Mary Poppins.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically I'm incredibly insecure and don't take myself
seriously as an artist,'' said the director, Todd Haimes, 42, in a
recent series of interviews. ``But somehow my taste seems to match
up with what the public wants.''
</P>
<P>
   The Roundabout formula now includes a growing number of new
works by successful contemporary playwrights like Beth Henley and
Paula Vogel as well as offbeat musical revivals like the coming
``Little Me,'' along with the theater's more predictable repertory
of classic drama _ Shaw, Ibsen, Strindberg, Williams and Miller.
The Roundabout has also courted a younger audience, with
subscriptions at prices about half those on Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   With three big revivals on Broadway _ ``Cabaret,'' ``1776'' and
``A View From the Bridge'' _ the Roundabout has also just begun
previewing a new play, ``Side Man,'' on one of its two stages at
Criterion Center on Broadway at 45th Street, where two other
productions recently ended their 12- and 15-week runs.
</P>
<P>
   Three new productions _ the Henley and Vogel plays and a new
Harold Pinter play _ and three revivals are to follow over the next
year. The company is also planning a move in the fall of 1999 to a
new home in the refurbished 1918 Selwyn Theater on West 42d Street,
down the block from two entertainment behemoths, Disney and Livent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cabaret,'' playing to sellout crowds in a dissolute
mock-Berlin Kit Kat Klub on West 43d Street, has become perhaps the
hottest ticket on Broadway, a celebrity rendezvous where Roundabout
subscribers find themselves knee to knee at cafe tables with the
likes of Steven Spielberg, Madonna, Mel Brooks and Anne Bancroft,
Mikhail Baryshnikov and Walter Cronkite. (Baryshnikov and Cronkite
were pulled up onstage on different nights to dance with the
raunchy master of ceremonies, played by Alan Cumming.)
</P>
<P>
   And now come the Tonys. Crowning what has been its most
commercially successful season since its debut in 1966,
Roundabout's three Broadway productions have been nominated for 17
Tony Awards in 14 of the 21 categories, including best play and
musical revivals, best direction and best leading and featured
actors and actresses. The winners will be announced on Sunday in a
televised ceremony at Radio City Music Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm jealous of them _ don't quote me,'' said Bernard Gersten,
executive producer of Lincoln Center Theater, which has three
nominations this year, for ``Ah, Wilderness!'' and ``Ivanov.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh,'' he said, ``you can quote me.'' (In 1988, three Lincoln
Center productions were nominated for 18 Tonys, winning four, for
``Anything Goes'' and ``Speed-the-Plow.'')
</P>
<P>
   The Roundabout's $17 million annual budget is exceeded only by
Lincoln Center's $21 million theater budget. Of the $17 million, a
full 80 percent is covered by ticket sales.
</P>
<P>
   While the Roundabout has had its share of flops and missteps _
it recently yanked a scheduled musical, ``What the World Needs
Now,'' with songs by Burt Bacharach and Hal David, substituting
``Side Man'' _ and it has never sought distinction as a
particularly experimental theater, its rebound has drawn interest
and envy in a struggling industry where success stories stand out.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've done a very good job of identifying their audience,''
said Rocco Landesman, president of the Jujamcyn theater chain, who
admitted to mixed feelings about competing for Tonys against
nonprofit theaters aided by public funds.
</P>
<P>
   The Roundabout also appears to exemplify a trend toward a firmer
business hand at the controls. Some leading nonprofit theaters,
Lincoln Center's and the Manhattan Theater Club among them, have
divided the directorship into artistic and management components.
</P>
<P>
   In the Roundabout's case, it comes down to the same person, the
soft-spoken, hard-driving Haimes, whose background _ his title of
artistic director notwithstanding _ is more in business than in
art.
</P>
<P>
   A liberal arts graduate of the University of Pennsylvania who
went through the Yale School of Management, Haimes is widely
credited with stanching the flow of red ink and blending a
repertory that draws audiences and by and large commands critical
respect, if not always raves. He does this over long days and
nights, time spent away from his wife, Alison, a neuro-radiologist,
and their daughter, Hilary, 11, and son, Andrew, 9.
</P>
<P>
   Associates say Haimes's personable manner has won him strong
staff and artist loyalty. Rob Marshall, the co-director, with Sam
Mendes, and choreographer of ``Cabaret,'' who has been nominated
for two Tony Awards and is directing the theater's fall ``revisal''
_ a combination revision and revival _ of the Neil Simon and Cy
Coleman musical ``Little Me,'' said Haimes had given artists a
great sense of freedom and support.
</P>
<P>
   ``Todd takes characters and actors and puts them in a room and
says, `Go play,''' Marshall said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   In the past, some critics have faulted the Roundabout as overly
tried-and-true, an indictment that Haimes challenges as no longer
applicable, if it ever was.
</P>
<P>
   ``We take enormous risks,'' he said, citing plays like ``London
Assurance'' that ``if we don't do, are not going to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Had `1776' flopped, it would have devastated us,'' he said. In
fact, it became the theater's biggest success, with ticket sales of
$2 million in 17 weeks before moving to Broadway. That show and ``A
View From the Bridge'' have been licensed to commercial producers
for their Broadway runs; the Roundabout is itself presenting
``Cabaret'' in space subleased from a nightclub that has taken over
the Henry Miller Theater, a location that took Haimes four years to
find. Yet, he said, with the capacity limited to 500 seats,
``Cabaret'' would have to sell out for a year and a half before the
costs are recovered.
</P>
<P>
   For all the luster of the theater's prospects today, they were
bleak indeed when Haimes arrived as managing director in 1983, at
age 26, from two years of managing the Hartman Theater in Stamford,
Conn.
</P>
<P>
   The Roundabout _ founded in 1965 by a director, Gene Feist, and
his wife, Elizabeth Owens, an actress, and installed first in the
basement of a supermarket on West 26th Street, then in an RKO movie
house on West 23d Street _ had filed for bankruptcy in 1978. By
1983 it had run up a $2.5 million deficit, the equivalent of a
year's budget. Two weeks after Haimes arrived, the directors voted
to shut down altogether. That day, too, his mother died.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew they were in Chapter 11,'' Haimes recalled. ``I didn't
know they were completely out of money.'' The only bright side, he
said, was that things were so bad they were ready to take a chance
on a neophyte like him.
</P>
<P>
   At the last minute, the chairman of the Roundabout board,
Christian Yegen, who ran a leasing and insurance business in New
Jersey, donated $100,000, allowing the company to continue
operating. But then the Roundabout lost its lease to its 299-seat
theater in the movie house. The following year, 1984, Haimes found
new quarters in the former Tammany Hall on 17th Street and Park
Avenue South, then owned by the International Ladies Garment
Workers Union.
</P>
<P>
   While renovations went on, the Roundabout, still in bankruptcy,
rented the Haft Theater at the Fashion Institute of Technology,
where it presented ``Joe Egg,'' with Jim Dale and Stockard
Channing. The production moved to Broadway, winning Tony Awards and
other prizes.
</P>
<P>
   By 1985, the company had moved into the 17th Street theater that
is now the Union Square Theater and emerged from bankruptcy, with
the help of a general manager, Ellen Richard, whom Haimes recruited
from his former Stamford theater. In 1989 Feist retired, and Haimes
became artistic director.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping a tight rein on expenditures, he instituted zero-base
budgeting. ``We started each year with zero and had to prove that
every expense was justified,'' he said. The deficit began to
shrink, and subscribers signed up, attracted by revivals like ``The
Crucible'' and ``The Subject Was Roses.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1990 the lease expired on 17th Street, and the company was
facing homelessness again. Haimes found new quarters in the
Criterion Center on Broadway, signing a 20-year lease on a 499-seat
theater.
</P>
<P>
   The 1992-93 season offered mixed blessings. There was an
acclaimed ``Anna Christie'' starring Natasha Richardson and Liam
Neeson, who met there and later married. (Ms. Richardson is up for
a Tony for her current role in ``Cabaret.'') There was also a
widely derided ``Hamlet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a learning curve,'' Haimes said.
</P>
<P>
   Promotionally, however, he scored with innovative marketing
programs and earlier curtains to draw after-work audiences. It took
10 years, but by 1993 the deficit was erased.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994 a second performance space opened up inside the
Criterion, and a 399-seat theater was built, affording
opportunities to present new plays as well as revivals. Between
1989 and 1995, the number of subscribers nearly doubled, to 35,000,
where it has leveled off. But with the clamor for ``Cabaret''
tickets, the Roundabout is unashamedly using the demand to woo new
subscribers and benefactors. With every seven-play package, a
subscriber can buy one ticket to ``Cabaret'' at 25 percent off.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the Roundabout began discussions about moving into the
Selwyn Theater, a prospect that took on some immediacy last year
when the owner of the Criterion Center, Charles B. Moss Jr.,
reacting to rapidly rising real estate values in Times Square,
invoked a provision in the lease to prematurely terminate the
Roundabout's tenancy.
</P>
<P>
   Haimes said, however, he was grateful that the Roundabout has
been allowed to remain there for now. He said he couldn't face
another move just yet.

   FEZ, Morocco _ Upraised, passionate voices sang the names of God
in Arabic, Latin, Hebrew, French, Greek, Spanish, Turkish, Hindi,
Italian, German, Gaelic, Farsi and English during the fourth Fez
Festival of World Sacred Music, presented here during the last week
of May.
</P>
<P>
   Under the giant keyhole arch and the crenellated ramparts of Bab
Mekina, one of the gates into this 1,000-year-old city, and in the
courtyard of the Batha Museum, a former sultan's palace, musicians
from four continents gathered to perform devotional songs, setting
aside doctrinal differences to praise the divine.
</P>
<P>
   On opening night, an American opera singer, Barbara Hendricks,
sang spirituals, sharing a bill with Monajat Yulcheva from
Uzbekistan, performing songs rooted in the Sufi tradition of
mystical Islam. The final two concerts, on Saturday, were given by
a Javanese gamelan group and whirling dervishes from Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   In between were performances of Greek Byzantine chants,
Andalusian Jewish songs, Indian ragas, medieval cantigas from
Spain, Celtic Christian music and songs from various traditions of
Sufism.
</P>
<P>
   Fez was founded by a Sufi saint and is considered the spiritual
heart of Morocco.
</P>
<P>
   It was a festival, by and large, of contemplative music,
centered in meditative drones and finely detailed improvisations.
The music kept returning to the human voice and the glides and
quavers that are shared by cantorial singing, Koranic chant and
plainsong; in Fez, the sound of praise was the sound of the
melisma, a single syllable sustained through many notes. And for
some performers, contemplation led to joyous release.
</P>
<P>
   Mohammed Soussi, performing under the ruins of a Roman arch in a
concert at Volubilis, 30 miles outside Fez, sang classical Arabic
poems called qasidas in music that gradually accelerated from
stately call and response to ecstatic hand-clapping rhythms and
blasts from six-foot-long trumpets.
</P>
<P>
   The Fez Festival of World Sacred Music is so unworldly that it
doesn't even offer a souvenir T-shirt for sale. But it was created
in response to a distinctly earthbound event: the Persian Gulf war
of 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time, all the cultures were in great conflict because
of the media,'' said Dr. Faouzi Skali, the festival's general
director. ``I was convinced it was important to have a direct
meeting between people, not through the media.''
</P>
<P>
   His first effort was an international film festival in Fez in
1992; he called it Desert Colloquium as a direct answer to the
Desert Storm military campaign. The festival also included some
concerts of Sufi music, and the response convinced Skali that
``music could be a very good medium,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``With film, there is the problem of language. But with music
there is a direct connection that can be larger and deeper. It's
not a question of what you think and don't think. It is a direct
experience of the Other.''
</P>
<P>
   So he decided to make his next gathering a music festival. He
chose sacred music, he said, because, ``It is a crossroads of so
many questions about our time.'' He added: ``It is about values,
about spirituality, about the future, about the connections between
cultures and about the identity of a culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Held in 1994, 1996, 1997 and 1998, each sacred-music festival
has drawn larger audiences. This year, bus loads of New Age
tourists from the United States and Europe sat alongside Moroccans
from across the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have begun to discover what we are losing without
spirituality,'' Skali said. ``Progress has given us computers and
global markets, but no feeling, no passion, no flavor of life. Then
when we discover the beauty of spirituality and the traditions of
the sacred, it's just so strong and so deep that it reminds us of
what we have lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is impossible to live spiritually now the way people lived
many years ago, when you grew up in a tradition and it was your
universe. Now, with media and travel, we don't have that. We have
to discover a new culture of living spirituality: to be yourself
but to be aware of what's around you and to recognize the worth of
the other person.''
</P>
<P>
   The music this year came from udaism, Christianity and Islam.
(Although the Indian musicians, Begum Parveen Sultana and Ustad
Dilshad Khan, were playing in a style generally associated with
Hinduism, they adapted song texts to make Islamic references.)
</P>
<P>
   The festival also included films and academic symposiums on
subjects that included the cultures of India and Borobodur, the
great Buddhist monument in Java. But religions from Shinto to
santeria also have remarkable music associated with them, and for
the Fez festival in the year 2000 Skali hopes to have an even more
ecumenical lineup, what he called ``a great meeting of all
traditions.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   The festival is devoted to styles that date back through the
centuries. ``These are ancient forms that have traveled through
time,'' said Gerard Kurdjian, the festival's artistic director, who
chooses the musicians each year. ``We live in a society in which
time is understood as an obstacle. We want to make more things in a
shorter time; we want to communicate instantly.
</P>
<P>
   ``But these forms of music are full of time. They are old forms,
but they are absolutely up-to-date. They express something coming
from the heart of the performer and from the heart and mind of a
culture, society and social group. And whether you are talking
about Sufism, Christianity or even Buddhism, they correspond to
something that crosses time and goes across all cultures.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the music at the festival was not liturgical music used
directly in religious rituals but concert music with songs about
God. ``Ritual aspects have to be performed in specific places,''
Kurdjian said. ``When you take them out of those places, they lose
their meaning. But the sacred is something much larger than the
liturgical and ritual. The thread that links them is the emotion
that all these musics provoke in the heart of the listener.''
</P>
<P>
   The festival's lineup might have been designed to argue that all
sacred styles meet in the Middle East. The Byzantine Choir of
Greece bridged Gregorian chant and Middle Eastern singing.
</P>
<P>
   Performing in a Greek Orthodox tradition that survives at the
monastic Mount Athos, the group sang in the pure-toned unison of
European plainsong, but soloists' voices took on the rougher
timbres and microtonal turns of Arabic music.
</P>
<P>
   Another European-Arabic link emerged when Begonia Olavide and
the Mudejar Ensemble, a medieval-music group from Spain, performed
cantigas written 400 to 700 years ago; the music moved between
European polyphony and the stark single lines of Arabic music,
backed by clay drum and oud.
</P>
<P>
   Laude Novella, a medieval- and Renaissance-music trio from
Sweden, performed ``In Stadio Laboris,'' a song from ancient
seminaries, with triple-time Middle Eastern-flavored rhythms; Ute
Goedecke, its singer, used a nasal delivery akin to the sound of
the oboelike ghaita used in Morocco's jajouka music. It was a
musicological coincidence; Ms. Goedecke said she had not heard
jajouka before arriving in Morocco.
</P>
<P>
   Anuna, from Ireland, used the courtyard of the Batha Museum for
antiphonal effect, deploying singers all around the audience. Its
arrangements of ancient songs, which used Far Eastern
throat-singing for drones and sometimes added strangely jazz-tinged
harmonies, were probably anachronistic, but the purity of the
voices imbued the music with reverence.
</P>
<P>
   Albert Bouhadanna, a cantor from Morocco who now officiates at a
synagogue in Paris, performed in a tradition called piyyout that
was preserved by Jews in Morocco after they were expelled from
Spain in the 15th century. Working with the Arabo-Andalusian
Orchestra of Fez, conducted by Mohammed Briouel, he sang with a
genteel intricacy in both Hebrew and Arabic.
</P>
<P>
   But the most spectacular singing came from performers in the
Sufi tradition. For many Westerners whose only exposure to Sufi
music has been the serene melodies of Turkish dervishes and the
driving, flamboyant improvisations of the late Nusrat Fateh Ali
Khan, here were other points on the spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein al-Azami, whose trip from Iraq to Fez began with a long
taxi ride from Baghdad to Amman, Jordan, brought a rich,
magisterial tone to classical Iraqi maqams, groups of songs with
plenty of room for melodic ruminations.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Yulcheva, the Uzbek singer, has taken up a repertory
formerly reserved to men; her voice was suffused with a thoughtful
tenderness, almost turning Sufi poetry into intimate revelations.
Alim Kassimov of Azerbaijan hurled his voice skyward, in grand arcs
that merged fervor and control, making every delicate ripple or
soaring phrase sound momentous.
</P>
<P>
   It was a festival of music by believers, but not for believers
alone. As virtuosity met devotion, the pleasure of music was
inseparable from the profundity of faith.

MEASURE CHEERS NATIONAL REFORMERS
</HEADLINE>
   580&AMP;ADD  CALIFORNIA VOTE AGAINST UNION-DUES &HT;     By ANDREW MOLLISON 
 &HT;     c.1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Federal campaign reformers Wednesday cheered the
defeat in California of Proposition 226, which would have reduced
the political power of unions.
</P>
<P>
   By about 53 to 47 percent, voters in the nation's most populous
state on Tuesday rejected a measure that would have required unions
to obtain permission annually from each union member before using
any part of that person's dues for political purposes.
</P>
<P>
   House Republican leaders had hoped that the proposal would be
``so popular that House members would be forced to vote for it'' as
an amendment to any campaign finance bill, said Ann McBride. She is
president of Common Cause, which leads a coalition of national
advocacy groups that support a bipartisan federal bill.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's results ``really take this off the table as a
potential poison-pill amendment'' that would keep House Democrats
from voting for a bipartisan bill, said McBride, whose organization
was neutral on Prop. 226.
</P>
<P>
   The House Rules Committee will try Thursday to streamline the
House debate by agreeing on a way to eliminate some of the
record-setting 600 amendments proposed by members to 11 rival
bills.
</P>
<P>
   The fight over the California initiative was itself a prime
example of big-money politics, even though many California business
leaders stayed aloof. Some executives didn't want to pick a fight
with unions and others didn't respond as enthusiastically to
appeals from the measure's chief fund-raiser, California Gov. Pete
Wilson, as they used to before he was a lame duck.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of us (outside California) who thought it was
overblown to begin with,'' said Bernadette Budde of the
Business-Industry Political Action Committee (BIPAC), which
conducts political research for hundreds of businesses. ``Labor has
a lot more sources of political money than dues.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson did obtain some $6 million to $8 million in help from his
fellow Republicans, some tax-exempt groups and businessmen as far
away as Georgia and Pennsylvania. House Speaker Newt Gingrich of
Georgia and other Republican leaders endorsed the proposal as well.
</P>
<P>
   But exit polls showed that support for the proposition, measured
at 71 percent among union and non-union voters alike in polls last
February, slid to a statistical even split among non-union voters
and 29 percent among union voters by Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   The proposition was rejected because opponents ``spent a lot of
money and they lied about what it was about,'' said Mary Mead
Crawford, spokeswoman for the National Republican Congressional
Committee, which gave $145,000 to the losing side.
</P>
<P>
   Unions from as far away as Washington and Boston, some
tax-exempt organizations and Democrats _ who get the bulk of union
contributions _ spent about $17 million opposing the proposal, and
President Clinton and other Democratic leaders spoke out against
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope the defeat of Prop. 226 will also send a message to the
United States Congress that working families and our unions are fed
up with phony campaign reform schemes and ready for the real
thing,'' AFL-CIO President John Sweeney said Wednesday afternoon.
``That means passing campaign finance reforms outlawing soft money
and slamming the lid on what contributors can give, what candidates
can spend and what political parties can accept and spend.''
</P>
<P>
   He declined to be pinned down on whether organized labor would
settle this year for a less sweeping bill sponsored by Reps. Chris
Shays, R-Conn., and Martin Meehan, D-Mass., and endorsed by the
coalition led by Common Cause.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows)
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We are monitoring the debate on campaign finance and assessing
various bills (and) amendments that are going to be introduced,''
Sweeney said. ``We will see which is going to be the best from the
point of view of the AFL-CIO.''
</P>
<P>
   McBride said that, regardless of labor's stand, she expected
House Democratic leaders to continue to round up votes for ``an
unamended Shays-Meehan bill.''
</P>
<P>
   However, several attempts at bipartisan reforms have been killed
in recent years by an unlikely alliance of Democrats who wanted
more restrictions and Republicans who wanted fewer.

<P>
   In her 1923 classic book, ``Etiquette,'' Emily Post observed
that ``older people invariably feel that the younger generation is
speeding swiftly on the road to perdition.''
</P>
<P>
   And so it is with stamps. Last week, the first domestic image on
an American stamp was unveiled, heralding Mrs. Post's
``Etiquette.'' The stamp _ of a 1920s place-setting with Lafayette
Towle silver, a goblet and hand-painted Copeland Spode china _ is
elegant and extremely proper (note the archaically correct
placement of the salad fork, prongs up, next to the plate). But
beneath that white damask tablecloth lurks a radical shift in the
design and subject matter of these miniature snippets of everyday
Americana.
</P>
<P>
   In the not-so-recent past, ``Etiquette'' would have been
depicted by _ in the words of Terry McCaffrey, the senior art
director at the U.S. Postal Service _ a ``dead head,'' a sober
engraving of Emily Post's profile, not a stylish photograph worthy
of a shelter magazine.
</P>
<P>
   But today, in part to lure a generation for whom e-mail is mail,
and facing competition with everything from faxes to the Internet,
the Postal Service is looking to produce stamps that sell, pushing
the tasteful limits of stamp design. In the process, the agency is
becoming ever more populist, designing stamps that are no longer
simply the nation's calling cards but adhesive pop icons.
</P>
<P>
   For the second time (the first was for Elvis), the Postal
Service has held a public referendum on stamps. A vote that ended
Sunday, offering figures and trends to represent the 1960s,
included Medicare but also the twist, Woodstock, shopping malls and
the Ford Mustang. Those worried about the state of the nation will
probably not find solace in the returns from a vote on 1950s
images, with drive-in movies and ``I Love Lucy'' the most popular
vote getters. President Dwight D. Eisenhower finished 16th, in a
futile bid to appear on a U.S. stamp a ninth time.
</P>
<P>
   The most conspicuous example of stamps' new look _ dismissed by
serious collectors as ``wallpaper'' _ may be in Times Square, where
a triumphal billboard of the new Tweety and Sylvester stamp hangs
from the Warner Brothers Studio Store. At the recent dedication,
Bugs Bunny, who was the first in the Looney Tunes' series of stamps
and whose initial printing of 300 million sold in one month, passed
a mailbag to his speech-impaired successors.
</P>
<P>
   Visions of envelopes desecrated with Looney Tunes characters
have caused many old-guard philatelists _ who still mourn the
purple 3-cent monochromes _ to contemplate rash acts with their
tongs.
</P>
<P>
   Local post offices have begun to resemble a Warner Brothers
store, filled with Tweety and Sylvester hats, ties and other
synergistic souvenirs. (Shoppers, take note: they're cheaper at the
post office.) According to Azeezaly Jaffer, the executive director
of stamp services for the Postal Service, Warner Brothers, like
other companies, provides images for the stamps royalty-free, but
profits from merchandise are divided in an ``equitable split.''
</P>
<P>
   Jaffer, the Postal Service's Louis B. Mayer, added, ``Tweety is
going to be important.''
</P>
<P>
   The very mention of Bugs and Tweety has caused a phlap in the
world of philately. As outlined by the Postal Service and the
Citizens' Stamp Advisory Committee, which reviews more than 40,000
stamp proposals annually, the official criteria for stamp selection
says that stamps will not be issued to ``honor commercial
enterprises or products.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Stamps are windows on the soul of the nation,'' said Gary
Griffith, a columnist for Stamp Collector magazine. ``They ought to
be a place of honor, not a marketing gimmick.''
</P>
<P>
   The new accessibility, in which Wolf Man and the Mummy are now
on stamps, is in part a marketing response to the slow, painful
demise of American stamp collecting. In past generations, America
was a fertile seedbed of philately, a cherished stamp collection
under the bed a fixture of childhood. But the future of this
now-quaint pastime is in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our kids today are growing up amidst a technological
revolution, a society in which they want and demand immediate
gratification,'' Jaffer said. ``Kids today don't go to post
offices. Kids tomorrow won't go to post offices.''
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of how commercial stamps have become, they now have
their own lobbying blocks. Like a movie studio campaigning for
Oscars, Ford Motor Co. had ballots shipped to 500 Ford dealerships
in an effort to secure a stamp for the Mustang, according to Linn's
Stamp News, a weekly based in Sidney, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Commerce aside, there is another force at work. ``Too often,
we've been afraid to embrace some of our greatest American
figures,'' said the historian Douglas Brinkley. ``We somehow think
there's something cheap or tawdry about the U.S. government giving
respect to an Elvis, a James Dean or a Marilyn Monroe.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Postal Service is wisely looking at the fullness of
decades. The 1920s was not just about Calvin Coolidge, but also
Josephine Baker and Langston Hughes.''
</P>
<P>
   It was also about etiquette. In keeping with the broadening of
stamps' graphic appeal, the Emily Post stamp was designed for a
visually sophisticated audience. Until five years ago, photography
was rarely used as a medium on stamps; today, McCaffrey said, about
20 percent of American stamps are illustrated with photos.
(Children in particular ``like the immediacy and reality of
photographs,'' he said.) The Post stamp went through many ``image
gyrations'' _ the art of opening doors was considered briefly _
before a table setting was picked.
</P>
<P>
   There were some faux pas along the way. Peggy Post, Emily Post's
granddaughter-in-law, an adviser on the stamp, noticed that the
placement of the salad fork was incorrect for the 1920s, so the
image was ``digitally flip-flopped,'' McCaffrey said. Now it
appears next to the plate, a la 1920s protocol. (A proper fish fork
is nowhere to be found.)

WITHOUT GINGER, SPICE GIRLS FANS FACE BLAND FUTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RANDY CORDOVA  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Last Sunday won't exactly go down in history as the
day the music died. Instead, think of it as the beginning of the
end of one of pop music's fluffier chapters.
</P>
<P>
   In a tersely written statement, Geri Halliwell _ Ginger Spice to
millions of fifth-graders and ``Penthouse'' readers _ said farewell
to her bandmates and announced plans to launch a solo career.
</P>
<P>
   The thought of Gingerless Spices isn't exactly heart-wrenching.
Sure, that was her screaming ``tell me what you want, what you
really, really want!'' on the irrepressible ``Wannabe'' to assure
her place in history.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of personality among the Spices, Ginger wins hands
down. She's the cheeky one who always was carping about girl power,
the same one who gave Prince Charles a pinch on the bum. That may
not make her the John Lennon of the group, but she was the
brightest light among some pretty dim bulbs.
</P>
<P>
   Still, this is the Spice Girls. It's cotton candy. It's
marshmallows. It's helium-filled balloons with big smiley faces
painted on them. The loss of Ginger isn't akin to Diana Ross
leaving the Supremes or Stevie Nicks walking away from Fleetwood
Mac. It isn't even ABBA without Agnetha Faltskog.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, the Spice Girls was a manufactured product.
This wasn't a bunch of women who discovered they could harmonize
while hanging out in a coffee shop, no matter what image the
big-screen ``Spice World'' portrayed.
</P>
<P>
   Even the women's names _ Posh, Sporty, Scary and Baby are the
Spices that Ginger is leaving on the rack _ came from a British
teen magazine. Musical ability was not key: ``No singing or dancing
experience necessary'' read the ad that announced auditions for the
group.
</P>
<P>
   When the fivesome exploded in 1996 with its spritely
choreography, big hair and chipper personalities, it was a fully
formed phenomenon. The end result was a live-action version of
Josie and the Pussycats with flame-haired Ginger serving as a buxom
Josie.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing wrong with man-made groups. The Monkees made
some pretty sublime pop at their best before they began to splinter
apart. The Bay City Rollers? Purists may carp, but their version of
``I Only'' Want to Be With You'' was a heckuva lot more fun than
Dusty Springfield's. Even the New Kids on the Block had their
moment in the sun with the stuttered ``oh-oh-oh-oh-oh'' hook of
``(You Got It) The ``Right Stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   The thing with manufactured pop is that it tends to be
imminently disposable. Little Debbie products usually have a longer
shelf life. Kids outgrow the music. The groups splinter and die,
becoming increasingly uninteresting as personnel changes occur. By
the time the Monkees were down to a trio in 1969, hardly anyone
cared.
</P>
<P>
   Critics have been predicting the end of the Spice Girls ever
since ``Wannabe'' fizzed and popped its way to No. 1. Their other
singles _ the percolating Latin rhythms of ``Spice Up Your Life,''
the dreamy make-out ballad ``2 Become 1'' _ were fine and fluffy,
just as pop should be.
</P>
<P>
   By that point, the Girls already seemed to be beating the odds.
But you can only outrun the inevitable for so long. With Ginger's
goodbye, the final act has started to begin.
</P>
<P>
   And, strangely enough, the loss of Ginger probably will cause
more damage than if any other Spice left.
</P>
<P>
   Victoria Adams plays the Gucci-loving Posh Spice, the same way
the childlike Baby is a role that Emma Bunton fills. You could
replace them, the same way one mustachioed biker easily takes over
for another in the Village People. But Geri Halliwell actually is
Ginger, a chirpy, chattering British bird.  &QL;

 &HT;    (STORY ENDS HERE. OPTIONAL SIDEBAR FOLLOWS)
 &HT;     
 STAMPS AND POP CULTURE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 UNDATED: be found.)  
 &HT;    The shift toward user-friendly images, of which the Elvis stamp
is still the apogee, began with the Postal Reorganization Act of
1972, which established the U.S. Postal Service as a
quasi-government agency with no taxpayer support. In the late 1970s
the Postal Service, under the aegis of the Citizens' Stamp Advisory
Committee, issued its first decorative package: a solid block of
butterflies and owls.
 &HT;    ``People went wild,'' said Mary Anne Owens, a leading collector
who recently retired from the committee. ``Before then, stamps were
primarily historical, mostly anniversaries, depending on who got
talking to their congressman,'' she said, adding, ``The post office
said, `Well, this is what the public wants.'''
 &HT;    Lighthouses, puppies and Elvis followed (the postal pelvis has
had greater retention than any U.S. stamp _ 38 million in its first
1{ years). ``It didn't take them long to realize that revenue from
stamps retained and not used was money in the bank,'' said Michael
Laurence, the editor and publisher of Linn's Stamp News.
 &HT;    ``That's how Tweety Bird and Sylvester have come to displace
George Washington and Abe Lincoln, much to the dismay of old-fogy
stamp collectors like myself.''
 &HT;    Virginia Noelke, a historian and the chairwoman of the citizens'
advisory group, said that Looney Tunes and other commercial images
raise ``serious questions'' but that the Bugs Bunny stamp is
``historically defensible.'' Bugs ``is an early bit of Americana,''
she said. ``The notion is the greater good _ to get young people
back to stamp collecting.''
 &HT;    Future stamps are likely to contain more colorful and complex
images, with a greater emphasis on photography and illustration.
Advances in printing will also affect design: Last year saw
star-shaped perforations and the first American triangle stamps.
Controversial subjects, like war, will in all likelihood continue
to be treated generically. (A 1994 proposal to depict the 50th
anniversary of the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki with a
mushroom cloud aroused such furor that it was replaced by the image
of Harry S. Truman announcing the war's end.)
 &HT;    Stamps continue to be symbols of broad cultural approval,
Brinkley said. ``You won't find too many radical uneven figures,''
he said. ``You'll get Rosa Parks but probably not Stokely
Carmichael or Abbie Hoffman. The twist and Barbie dolls were not
going to undermine the status quo.'' He thinks Bob Dylan will make
his way onto a stamp and, if Al Gore becomes president, possibly
the Grateful Dead. Think of the joint marketing ventures.
 &HT;    At the recent Metropolitan Stamp Show in New York, where grown
men huddled over lamps with their magnifying glasses, the country's
fate seemed to hang in balance over the question of what is to
become of philately. ``If Tweety is what it takes to interest kids
in stamp collecting, absolutely,'' said Jeff Fishman, a dealer from
Arlington Heights, Ill. ``We're competing with high exciting things
like Nintendo and the Internet. But we wouldn't have half the
problems we have if kids stayed home and collected stamps.''
 &HT;    There were signs that Bugs might eventually endear himself to
collectors. Recently, an imperfection _ the philatelists' reason
for living _ was found on the Bugs sheet. On the decorative half of
the pane, a single stamp is inserted next to a blown-up image of
Bugs. On some sheets, however, it appears that the Postal Service
forgot to perforate that stamp. So much for being cutting edge.
 &HT;    News of the flawed Bugs has swept swiftly through the
beleaguered world of philately. ``It's much rarer than the
others,'' said Ken Lawrence, a columnist for The American
Philatelist, with a twinge of rapture, noting that imperforate
Bugses are already selling for about $150 a pane.  By BARTH HEALEY

<P>
   Popular culture has been a dominant international theme in
stamps for 20 years. Chad honors Einstein, Mongolia honors the
X-Men comics. When it comes to pop postage, America is way behind
tiny Antigua, where 220 stamps have been designed by Walt Disney
Co. with images ranging from Donald Duck to Sleeping Beauty.
</P>
<P>
   Disney has yet to design a stamp for the American market, but
then, the Inter-governmental Philatelic Corp., a private stamp
marketer, has Disney sewed up. That's why the Postal Service went
with Warner Brothers' Tweety and Sylvester.
</P>
<P>
   Among Inter-governmental's coups: giving the Grenadines its own
James Dean stamps, as part of a series honoring ``100 Years of
Cinema.'' Inter-governmental, founded in 1957, saw its fortunes
blossom in 1979, the United Nations International Year of the
Child, when Inter-governmental asked Disney to design appropriate
stamps. In the usual deal, said Lonnie Ostrow, the company's
director of marketing, the company collects a basic fee and a
percentage of sales of stamps outside the country producing them.
Ostrow declined to estimate the company's annual income.
</P>
<P>
   So it goes: The company has arranged Elvis Presley stamps for 36
countries (Graceland got royalties). It arranged for five countries
to mark the 20th anniversary of ``Rocky'' with Sylvester Stallone
(who, Ostrow said, got such a kick out of seeing the stamp that he
did not charge royalties). There are philatelic souvenirs of Barbra
Streisand's 1993 tour.
</P>
<P>
   Is there any cultural logic to such stamps? Yes, Ostrow said.
For example, in each country honoring ``Rocky'' _ Ghana, Gambia,
Uganda, Grenada and St. Vincent _ the film had been a big
box-office grosser. On the other hand, Inter-governmental helped
both Antigua and Lesotho issue stamps with Disney cartoon
characters celebrating the Lunar New Year.
</P>
<P>
   Ostrow insists that two regulations of the Universal Postal
Union be met in order to have the stamps declared legal tender:
that the stamps be of high quality, and that a certain number be
available in the country of issue.
</P>
<P>
   For many countries, stamps are crucial for foreign-exchange
earnings. The numbers are startling: In the 38 years since
independence, Antigua (population 65,000) has issued 2,016 stamps;
during this period, the United States (population 268 million) has
issued 2,018.
</P>
<P>
   What this has done, however, is to deny foreign countries their
patrimony. In some countries that are clients of Inter-Continental,
only half of the stamps issued honor local culture. The rest borrow
from American pop culture or present weirdly eccentric
juxtapositions.
</P>
<P>
   Once, stamps, with their engraved monochrome images of national
leaders and famous events, taught history. But there is not much
history to be learned from a handful of James Deans.

MTV MOVIE AWARDS: HONORS WITH A WINK BUT WITH NO DICAPRIO (LIVE) 
</HEADLINE>

   When Leonardo DiCaprio didn't show up for the Oscars ceremony
this year (some said because he hadn't been nominated as best actor
for his role in ``Titanic''), there was a little public grumbling.
</P>
<P>
   When DiCaprio didn't show up for the MTV Movie Awards last
Saturday but thanked the voters on tape for his best male
performance award, the producers followed his thank you with ``The
Making of the Leonardo DiCaprio Acceptance Speech.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The 1998 MTV Movie Awards,'' taped in Santa Monica and being
shown Thursday night, specializes in parodies. Between the awards
presentations this year, there were also takeoffs on the taxi chase
scene from ``Godzilla'' (with Christopher Lloyd in character as Jim
Ignatowski from the series ``Taxi''); ``Dawson's Creek,'' WB's hit
show about articulate teen-agers with physical needs (featuring the
series' real stars), and a pitch meeting for a ``Titanic'' sequel,
in which Ben Stiller tells James Cameron not to worry if they can't
``get Leo.'' ``You put Buddy Hackett on that boat, you got a
billion dollars, OK?'' Stiller tells him.
</P>
<P>
   This year's show isn't as consistently inspired as last year's,
but it's still a shining example of what other awards shows should
be.
</P>
<P>
   MTV starts with some unorthodox categories. John Travolta and
Nicolas Cage, for instance, were named best on-screen duo for
``Face Off.''
</P>
<P>
   Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore received the best kiss award for
a scene in ``The Wedding Singer,'' a movie that advertised itself
as nostalgia for 1986. In his acceptance speech, Sandler thanked
his sixth-grade girlfriend for having given him kissing tips.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Myers won two awards for a dual role: as best villain in
``Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery'' and for best dance
sequence _ Austin's mod, mod London street sashay _ in the same
film.
</P>
<P>
   Only 15 awards are presented during the two-hour show, and the
MTV audience voters have definite tastes of their own. Neve
Campbell received the award for best female performance this year
for her role in Wes Craven's horror sequel ``Scream 2.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, ``Titanic'' was named best movie, in a rare
case of agreement with the Academy Awards. In the past, MTV had the
good sense to honor ``Pulp Fiction,'' when the Oscars passed it
over for ``Forrest Gump.'' (In the MTV Awards' first year,
``Terminator 2: Judgment Day'' was named best movie.)
</P>
<P>
   The MTV show's musical numbers are a lot better than those at
the Oscars, maybe because they have nothing to do with the actual
nominees for best song. This year's numbers included the
Wallflowers, with Jakob Dylan sounding particularly Dylanesque,
doing ``Heroes,'' from the ``Godzilla'' soundtrack, and Natalie
Imbruglia singing ``Torn,'' which isn't even from a movie.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Carrey, who is having an especially good week (a brilliant
turn on the ``Larry Sanders Show'' finale last Sunday and the
opening of his film ``The Truman Show'' tomorrow), received the
best comedic performance award for ``Liar Liar.'' Accepting the
award, Carrey went into character from that film, forced to tell
the truth about his own greatness. Nobody was arguing.
</P>
<P>
   The lifetime achievement award went to Clint Howard, Ron
Howard's brother and an unsung but recognizable actor specializing
in nerd roles. Previous recipients include Chewbacca, Godzilla and
Jackie Chan.

   WORKS IN PROGRESS
</P>
<P>
   New music by Augusta Read Thomas, Pierre Boulez and Wolfgang
Rihm is being commissioned by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and
the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra. The first of the works is a
piano concerto by Rihm, a German composer; Daniel Barenboim will be
conductor and soloist at its premiere next May at the Berlin State
Opera's new Mozart Festival Berlin. Barenboim, the music director
of the Chicago Symphony and the Berlin State Opera, took the
initiative in bringing the two orchestras together. The Berlin
Philharmonic will present the new festival in cooperation with the
Berlin State Opera. The composition by Ms. Thomas, the Chicago
Symphony's composer in residence, will receive its premiere at the
festival in June 2000. And the work by Boulez, the Chicago
Symphony's principal guest conductor, will have its premiere in
2001. Each work will receive its second performance in Chicago.

   The Oscar, Grammy, Emmy, Tony and Golden Globe award-winning
composer Marvin Hamlisch will be among the performers when the
Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival opens its 66th season with a benefit
on June 20 on the festival grounds in Becket, Mass. Other
performers include Mark McVey of ``Les Miserables'' and principal
dancers from Ballet Hispanico. The occasion will also celebrate the
renaming of the Studio/Theater as the Doris Duke Studio Theater in
recognition of the $1 million gift to Jacob's Pillow this year by
the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation.

`A MONK SWIMMING': A TRAGEDIAN'S BROTHER FINDS MORE COMEDY IN
LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: publication notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Malachy McCourt, the author of this amusingly intemperate
memoir, ``A Monk Swimming,'' is a younger brother of Frank McCourt,
whose best-selling ``Angela's Ashes'' won both the Pulitzer Prize
and the National Book Critics Circle Award for the best
autobiography published in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   So right away, you can't help thinking that ``A Monk Swimming''
is an exercise in me-tooism. After all, the McCourt brothers, who
were born in Depression-era Brooklyn and raised in the slums of
Limerick, Ireland, have teamed up before. As Malachy tells it,
``The brother Frank had somehow got to the U.S.A. in 1949, at the
age of 19, and then saved up enough money to send for me in 1952,
when I was 20.''
</P>
<P>
   Years later, they performed together in ``A Couple of
Blaguards,'' a musical revue about their Irish youth. At a time
when it was not politically incorrect to make generalizations about
people of like cultural backgrounds, you might have said they
shared the Irish gift of gab. (As Malachy puts it, introducing one
of the several Irish songs he quotes, ``To make fine wine, it is
necessary to crush the grapes, and the English crushed us Irish,
hence the vintage wine of words.'') Since they have so much in
common, why shouldn't the McCourt brothers produce matching volumes
for the bookshelf?
</P>
<P>
   Yet a reading of ``A Monk Swimming'' reveals that if Malachy is
horning in on Frank's act, he has managed to do so in a most
un-imitative way. Where ``Angela's Ashes'' is about the McCourts'
childhood in Limerick, ``A Monk Swimming'' picks up the story after
the brothers return to America. Where the older brother writes in
the modulated lyricism of an Irish-American looking back to a
distant time and place, the younger brother speaks in the raucous
brogue of a native freshly landed on a foreign shore.
</P>
<P>
   Where Frank is restrained and tragic, Malachy is outrageous and
comic. Where the title ``Angela's Ashes'' refers to the author's
mother's suffering, ``A Monk Swimming'' is a whimsical evocation of
the way its author as a child misheard ``Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou amongst women'' as
``Blessed art thou, a monk swimming.'' The only sense you can make
of this is to think of the book as an expression of the author's
somewhat distorted behavior ``amongst women.''
</P>
<P>
   McCourt's recollection of this behavior begins somewhat
unpromisingly with a series of disconnected but mildly amusing
stories about his adventures as a longshoreman, actor and barfly
after he first arrived in New York. One night at P.J. Clarke's, Ed
Wilcox, ``a sometime gossip columnist,'' saw the Giants football
players Kyle Rote and Frank Gifford heading back to the pub's
lavatory, and ``without a moment's hesitation'' shouted ``for all
to hear, `See what the backs in the boys' room will have.'''
</P>
<P>
   Another evening McCourt arrived at a restaurant to meet a friend
and was asked by the bartender to please check his overcoat in
accordance with the establishment's dress code. Because McCourt did
not like to be ordered around, he repaired to his car, took off ALL
his clothes, put on his overcoat again and returned to the bar.
When the bartender once again asked him to check his coat, McCourt
complied, leaving himself buck naked in front of the diners and
causing a near riot.
</P>
<P>
   But wherever he went and whatever he did, people seemed to take
to him, to want him at their parties or on their television talk
shows. So he played the stage Irishmen for all it was worth, drank
up everything that was poured for him, did his own pouring in a
singles bar called Malachy's that he helped start, slept with every
willing woman he could stay awake for, acquired a wife and fathered
two children with her, and drank a great deal more.
</P>
<P>
   McCourt does not boast about these feats. Rather he describes
them ruefully in language that would not be badly misplaced in John
Millington Synge's great drama ``The Playboy of the Western
World,'' in which the author acts at one point in his narrative.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his irresponsibility as a husband and father and the
infantile way he behaves when his wife finally leaves him and asks
for a divorce (he forces his way into her apartment and begins to
demolish the place), one grows to like McCourt for his honesty and
to sympathize with him for the struggle he wages with a mind that
he describes as ``leaping about like a caged and vicious rodent''
whenever he wakes up after a night of drink. When he is eventually
reduced to smuggling gold bars into Bombay, India, wearing a vest
that makes him precariously top-heavy, you laugh when he nearly
tips over from the weight of it, and you sweat when the authorities
seem to be closing in.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, you know from the book's flap copy that McCourt at 66
is now happily married, the father of five children and the
grandfather of three. This is a long way from a low point in his
story, when he returned to New York from Europe after an extended
drinking spree with assets consisting of ``three shoes (apparently
one had taken a walk by itself), some tattered drawers, some
defeated shirts, a woebegone suit, a drove of dead socks, a balding
toothbrush, a well-worn passport and a tie, that if immersed in
water, would have made a thick, nourishing soup for to feed most of
Calcutta.''
</P>
<P>
   How he got from then to now is not told in this volume. But
apparently the pitilessness with which he could gaze at his past
sent his demons to a place they could no longer torment him.
Whereupon peace came and allowed him to write this funny, oddly
winning book.

YOUTHFUL R&AMP;B ACT ON THE ROAD TO STAR DOM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN MURPHY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Only one word can capture the feeling of having a No.
1 single on the ``Billboard'' charts, touring with Boyz II Men and
having a video in heavy rotation on MTV all at the tender age of
22.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blessed,'' says Tweety, one-third of the R&AMP;B act Next.
</P>
<P>
   Next, which also includes R.L., 21, and Tweety's brother T-Low,
23, is one of the opening acts for Boyz II Men's current
three-month tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels like family,'' Tweety says of the tour, which also
features Uncle Sam and K-Ci &AMP; JoJo. ``Everybody embraces each other
on the tour.''
</P>
<P>
   The masses also have been quick to embrace Next, whose single
``Too'' ``Close,'' from the album ``Rated Next,'' was just recently
certified platinum. Fresh from the Twin Cities, the trio croons
``sensual R&AMP;B'' with sometimes explicit sexual content.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a stamp on there that lets you know that some of the
songs are built with explicit content,'' Tweety says.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we try to make an album that, no matter who you are,
you'll like at least one thing on the album.''
</P>
<P>
   While some may be attracted to the lyrical content, others may
be interested in the fact that Naughty By Nature deejay Kay Gee
handles most of the production work on the album _ which was a
stroke of luck for the members of Next.
</P>
<P>
   Tweety recalls the meeting for probably the hundredth time.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know how they say . . . it was just being in the right
place at the right time.''
</P>
<P>
   While hanging out at the Foot Locker in the Mall of America
outside Minneapolis, Tweety and T-Low spotted Naughty By Nature,
which was in town for a tour stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was like, `I know them from somewhere,' but I couldn't
really place it because it happened so fast,'' Tweety says.
</P>
<P>
   Although his brother dissuaded him from saying anything, Tweety
told himself that if he saw them again, he was going to approach
them and talk to them about their group.
</P>
<P>
   And wouldn't you know? Tweety eyed them again.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I stopped and told him our name, and he said, `Yeah, I
heard of you guys.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Tweety stopped in his tracks, amazed that a group with national
prominence had heard of them. The next night at the concert,
Tweety, T-Low and R.L. gave Kay Gee, who heads the Divine Mill
record label, a demo tape, and ``he called us back and, God bless
him, we're here today.''
</P>
<P>
   Next was the first group signed to Kay Gee's Divine Mill label,
a subsidiary of Arista Records.
</P>
<P>
   But Next has not relied solely on luck. The guys are more than
pretty faces dancing in unison on a video. They wrote nine out of
the 14 tracks on ``Rated Next,'' giving the group little worries
about being a flash in the pan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sing about what's going on around us or what we've
experienced,'' Tweety says. ``We won't have to date back years and
years and we won't get lost in the shuffle with time, because we
talk about the times.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as being young, I think that's a good thing. We're
still able to use our creative minds, and we'll only get stronger
as the years go by.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, the guys have handled fame like true gentlemen, leaving
little time to act like 20-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   ``You do have to watch what you do in public because you never
know who's watching you,'' Tweety says. ``I was in a Kmart in Los
Angeles and a little boy recognized me, and as soon as I told him
who I was, he just ran off, `Mom! Mom!' I met his mother, I met his
little sister. I never thought I'd go in Kmart and be
recognized.'' &QL;

MORDECAI SHEHORI: A RECITAL INTERRUPTED 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JAMES R. OESTREICH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mordecai Shehori, a pianist who has developed a
considerable reputation among connoisseurs, found himself unable to
finish his recital on Tuesday evening at Merkin Concert Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Shehori began the program with Beethoven's Fantasy in G minor,
playing with his typical searching intensity though experiencing
difficulty in passage work. Then he started Schumann's Fantasy in C
but fell to a halt in the fiendishly difficult second movement.
</P>
<P>
   After a brief attempt at a restart, he stood and spoke to the
audience. ``I am not feeling well,'' he said. ``I cannot continue
to play like this.'' He left the stage, but the audience stayed for
a time to applaud.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did something very stupid,'' Shehori said from his home
Wednesday, explaining that he had not taken his medication for high
blood pressure. ``It dulls my senses,'' he added, ``and I wanted to
play explosively.'' The demanding program consisted entirely of
fantasies, including Chopin's F minor Fantasy and
``Polonaise-Fantaisie'' and Balakirev's ``Islamey.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I blacked out,'' said Shehori, who is 52. ``My left hand was
not going to the right place.''
</P>
<P>
   Although nothing like this had ever happened to him before, he
said, he is haunted by the awareness that his father, an actor,
died onstage, as did one of his piano teachers. His father was 62
at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was basically saving my life,'' Shehori said.
</P>
<P>
   Shehori was born in Israel but studied at the Juilliard School
and lives in New York. His annual recitals here have a small but
committed following.
</P>
<P>
   His playing is prized by many for its individuality,
thoughtfulness and poetry despite its occasional unevenness in both
expression and technique. He has made fine recordings for
Connoisseur Society and, more recently, his own label, Cembal
d'Amour.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will do this another time,'' Shehori said from the stage,
adding that ticket money would be refunded. But any future recital
plans, he said Wednesday, would have to await a clean bill of
health from his doctor.

WOMEN, MINORITIES DELAY AIDS TREATMENT, GET LESS EFFECTIVE CARE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By EUN LEE KOH  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Women and minority men are more likely than white
men to delay seeking treatment for AIDS and they tend to receive
less effective care for the deadly disease, according to a new
study released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers from the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore and
the University of California at San Francisco found that a larger
proportion of women and minorities than white men sought treatment
for HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, after their immune system had
already broken down.
</P>
<P>
   According to the study, 36 percent of women, 42 percent of
blacks and 43 percent of Hispanics waited until their T-cell count
dipped below 500 to seek treatment while 27 percent of white men
did. T-cells are white blood cells that protect the body against
diseases.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Health and Human Services recommends treating
AIDS patients before their T-cell count dips below 500, but many of
the patients who delayed treatment had T-cells below the
recommended level. Healthy people have more than 1,000 T-cells per
one milliliter of blood.
</P>
<P>
   The study did not examine the causes for the disparity, but
researchers suggested that economics probably played a large role
in the difference in the quality of AIDS treatment that patients
receive.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Volberding, professor of medicine at UC San Francisco, said
poorer patients tend to put off treatment to avoid early medical
costs until they begin experiencing symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   Women and minorities infected with HIV are generally poorer than
infected white men.
</P>
<P>
   ``Early in the disease, there's almost no physical change to the
body,'' Volberding said. ``Patients mistakenly believe that just
because they seem healthy, they don't need to be treated right
away.''
</P>
<P>
   In order to slow the breakdown of the immune system, Volberding
said a patient should seek treatment immediately after being
diagnosed with HIV.
</P>
<P>
   The study also found that 76 percent of women, 68 percent of
blacks and 65 percent of Hispanics infected with HIV sought care
from physicians who did not specialize in AIDS treatment, compared
to 54 percent of white men who did.
</P>
<P>
   John Bartlett, chief of infectious diseases at the Johns Hopkins
University medical school, said physicians with little experience
in AIDS treatment tend to offer their patients ``second-best''
treatment options.
</P>
<P>
   Again, researchers blamed the trend on economics.
</P>
<P>
   Volberding said physicians who specialize in AIDS treatment cost
more than those who have little or no AIDS background and are less
accessible to poor patients.
</P>
<P>
   A telephone survey of 476 physicians around the nation who had
treated at least one AIDS patient showed that doctors with minimal
AIDS background waited longer to begin treatment for their patients
and prescribed fewer medications than recommended by the U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services, according to the study,
</P>
<P>
   HHS recommends fighting HIV with at least three different types
of medicine to slow the virus in its attack of the immune system.
But some doctors in the survey said they have prescribed only one.
</P>
<P>
   ``The disparity in the treatment of HIV, especially for
particular populations, signals an urgent need to educate
physicians and patients more aggressively,'' Volberding said.
</P>
<P>
   Volberding said delayed treatment can lead to earlier death
because the disease becomes harder to treat once it develops into
full-blown AIDS and the immune system starts breaking down. There
is no cure for AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Although the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
in Atlanta reported last January that, over-all, AIDS-related
deaths are declining for the first time since the beginning of the
epidemic in 1981, women and minority men have experienced the least
amount of decrease in AIDS-related deaths.
</P>
<P>
   The CDC reported that the estimated number of deaths among women
fell by 13 percent in 1996 from the previous year, while among
minorities the number went down by 19 percent. The number of deaths
among white men, however, plummeted by 33 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A follow-up study will be conducted later this year by the two
universities to determine causes for the disparity.

KING-SIZE CHANGE FOR ROYAL CROWN REVUE? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RANDY CORDOVA  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - That which does not kill us makes us stronger: It's an
old adage made famous by Nietzsche, not to mention Olympia Dukakis
in ``Steel Magnolias.'' It means something to the guys in Royal
Crown Revue, as well.
</P>
<P>
   After all, these are fellas that showed up in full zoot-suited
glory to swing away in front of a Nebraska audience all primed to
see Kabuki rockers Kiss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we got most of our fears out when we opened for
them,'' says Mando Dorame, the group's tenor sax player. ``It was
the scariest half-hour of my life. These die-hard Kiss fans,
tattooed everywhere, and they're booing us as soon as we walk on.''
</P>
<P>
   Scary, but exhilarating. By the end of the band's high-energy
set two years ago, they actually managed to get the crowd of
Kissphiles standing on its feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gratification of winning them over was so good for us,''
Dorame says, taking a cigarette break during recording sessions for
the band's fourth album. ``But at the same time, it was like, `I
know I don't want to do this again.' ''
</P>
<P>
   With any luck, they won't have to. The band's stylish
re-creation of the punchy '40s sound, combined with the group's
occasionally biting lyrics, have made RCR stand out from other
revivalists currently flooding the scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fred and Ethel sure the hell ain't next door,'' the band sings
in ``Trouble in Tinsel Town,'' one of its originals, and that helps
nail down the guys' attitude. These aren't a bunch of poseurs
pretending to live in the '50s; instead, it's a modern variation on
classic themes.
</P>
<P>
   Royal Crown Revue emerged from the Los Angeles club scene in the
late '80s. Unlike other acts that adapted the tailored suits and
pomaded hair, it was a look that came naturally to Dorame and his
bandmates.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad always watched old war movies, so I had this
fascination about the look,'' Dorame says. ``George Raft _ I just
thought he was coolest. I'm also half-Mexican, so the whole
zoot-suit thing came kind of natural.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a perfect fit with the other guys in the band. Dorame
didn't come late to the party; he grew up playing jazz and big-band
sounds, so the Tropicana-style rave-ups of RCR made him feel at
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the '80s, there wasn't nothing going on for the horn,'' he
says. ``I just did shows in bars, trying to dress up like a midget
George Raft. I used to think it would be cool if I could do this in
front of my peers. It's wild that it did catch on.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that it's caught on _ and big _ watch Royal Crown Revue move
away from its distinctive swing origins. Plans call for the group's
upcoming disc to be called ``The Contender.'' Due for an August
release,it may take the band out of swing circles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our presence will probably be the same,'' Dorame says. ``But
we're trying to do something different, something with more of an
alternative sound. There's still some jazz in it, some R&AMP;B, but
we're just trying to reach for something different.''
</P>
<P>
   The band may be picking up different fans on its next tour, as
well. RCR is set to open for the B-52's and the Pretenders. The
'80s nostalgia fest is tentatively scheduled for the Valley on July
28.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's going to be great,'' Dorame says. ``It's a
different spectrum of people, but I figure the more, the merrier.
The audiences might be a little older, but it will be arenas, so
that will be fun.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Mini reviews of the latest sounds
 &HT;    By Eileen M. Drennen, Shane Harrison, Al Levine, and Sonia
Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   -- RAP
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Dark and Hell Is Hot''
</P>
<P>
   DMX. Def Jam Music Group.
</P>
<P>
   19 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Granted, ``anticipated'' is an overused adjective, but here it
applies. The momentum created by DMX's guest appearances on
underground tapes and the No. 2 rap single by the Lox (``Money,
Power, Respect'') had retailers ordering 800,000 copies of this
debut _ meaning that it shipped gold (500,000 copies or more). Even
better, all that dues paying says that it hit the shelves sealed in
that intangible of street credibility, a key factor in hip-hop in
these times. A line from ``Crime Story'': ``Put the harness on the
dog / Load up the weapons / Murder's on my mind / No half
stepping.'' Well, that's not necessarily true. Like Master P and
his ``ugghhhs,'' DMX barks too much. His bite is in his emotional
storytelling _ detailing nightmares as clear as day.
</P>
<P>
   -- COUNTRY
</P>
<P>
   ``Wish You Were Here''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Wills. Mercury. 11 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   They should package a large box of tissues with this album. Mark
Wills has uncovered two of the best weepers to come out of
Nashville in years. In the title track, the woman gets her man's
postcard with just the word ``heaven'' on it right after the call
telling her that his plane has gone down. ``Don't Laugh at Me''
brings you lower. ``I lost my wife and little boy when someone
crossed that double line. / The day we laid them in the ground is
the day I lost my mind, / and right now I'm down to holding this
cardbard sign.'' But there's enough upbeat stuff on the second
album from the former house singer at the Buckboard to make this a
solid sophomore effort.
</P>
<P>
   -- DANCE / ROCK
</P>
<P>
   ``Mezzanine''
</P>
<P>
   Massive Attack. Virgin. 11 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   Something's afoot in Bristol, England. Massive Attack was the
originator of trip-hop, an atmospheric, fluid style that takes
hip-hop's innovations to exotic musical locales. Fellow Bristolians
Portishead and Tricky followed the Attack's lead and have created
some of this decade's most vibrant music. Now, with this third
outing, Massive Attack reasserts dominance over the competition.
Cocteau Twin Elizabeth Fraser lends her ethereal voice to three
tracks, including the gorgeous first single, ``Teardrop.'' This is
a fiercely original piece of work that's an early entry in the race
for album of the year.
</P>
<P>
   -- POP
</P>
<P>
   ``Beautiful World''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Carrack. ARK 21. 10 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   With a shiny-happy keyboard backdrop that brings Bruce Hornsby
to mind, Paul Carrack and company have crafted a radio-friendly mix
of rhythmic pop that should get constant airplay at Star 94. Not
that there's anything wrong with that _ if you like that sort of
thing. Perched at the programmed end of the blue-eyed-soul
spectrum, Carrack _ best known for his vocals with '80s pop outfits
Squeeze, Ace and Mike + the Mechanics _ is at his best on the
strutting ``You Give Me Something'' and the gospel-powered
``Beautiful World.'' Actually, this is perfect for the gym.

 &HT;    COLUMN:`Big doings': Colorful days at the Capitol
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL JUNE 7: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Celestine Sibley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Channel 8, the Georgia Public Television station, has been a
favorite of mine since Gene Moore used to run a book show there.
Gene read the books, which is not true of every television
interviewer, and when he invited me out to the studio, then on
Stewart Avenue, I knew we were in for a lively discussion. Now the
station has moved to 14th Street, and I don't believe they have a
book program by an erudite, well-read commentator, as they had in
Gene's day.
</P>
<P>
   But they do have some staffers who are knowledgeable and
enthusiastic about the state Capitol building. Rosy Bailey, a tall,
thin man who grew up in Georgia, and his photographer sidekick,
Wayne Baumgardner, have been covering the restoration of the
Capitol. They've spent many hours interviewing people about it and
standing by when the workers come out at night to scrape paint and
repair plaster in the House or Senate chambers.
</P>
<P>
   They invited me to meet them over there and talk about so-called
``old days'' in the Capitol. I was delighted to accept because I
have always loved the old building and have seen some interesting
and exciting times there. Just to walk through the near-deserted
halls filled me with nostalgia and a sadness for so many people who
are there no longer. The swearing in of Ellis Arnall as Georgia
governor was my first assignment over there, and I was hooked. I
wanted to be there when things happened.
</P>
<P>
   Rosy asked me how you can get the public interested in that
building, and I was surprised. How can the public not be
interested? It's the heart of the state, where people from all the
counties assemble once a year, and it's wonderfully colorful and
exciting and sometimes disgraceful.
</P>
<P>
   When senators dressed up in togas and drank quantities of
whiskey on adjournment day, even a fan like me couldn't call it
statesmanlike behavior. I did think it was funny when House Speaker
Georgie L. Smith and Reps. Frank Twitty and Jack Ray put on Beatles
wigs and marched into the chamber in defiance of some editorial
criticism of them from the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   And I loved it when Mr. H.P. McGibbony, the old peanut man who
sold his wares outside the House chamber, warned me that ``big
doings'' were going on inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you know, Mr. Mac?'' I asked. His cart was outside, and
he plainly couldn't hear the debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it's big controversy, they eat lots of peanuts,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The aisle was ankle-deep in peanut shells. The debate was on the
hot rural-roads question.
</P>
<P>
   It probably takes too much explaining to convince kids that the
Capitol is a fascinating place. They may never have heard of the
stormy January when we had two governors vying for the office and
one in the wings, waiting for a nod from the state Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   They may not sense the bigness and the diversity of the state
just sitting in those rather grand chambers and hearing the
arguments of representatives of the people _ say cotton or tobacco
growers. It may not amuse them that the man from a tobacco county
always tried to put a new tax on Coca-Cola to retaliate for the tax
on tobacco products.
</P>
<P>
   When they are older, I can tell them about the day a prostitute
visited the House or the woman patient from the mental hospital,
who sang and played the piano in impersonation of Sophie Tucker.
</P>
<P>
   But you can't really explain the kindness and helpfulness of
workers in all those big offices, or the aide who had a hollow
walking stick filled with little vials of whiskey for adjournment
night. And I didn't explain much to the men from Channel 8.

 &HT;    Platform sandals flatten the competition

   Size matters. Don't let anybody tell you differently.
</P>
<P>
   Keep that two-word truism in mind and you won't make a bad shoe
purchase all summer long.
</P>
<P>
   These days, ``summer'' is just another word for ``blockbuster.''
</P>
<P>
   And the platform sandals that look so right for this season have
blockbuster stamped on their soles.
</P>
<P>
   The sold-out signs are already flashing above some of the 2- to
4-inch-high sandals stores brought in. And there's good reason why
this style's so popular.
</P>
<P>
   Platforms accentuate legs and elongate physiques just about as
well as stilettos _ without the clear and present danger of pain or
injury.
</P>
<P>
   That's one thumb up.
</P>
<P>
   And they basically put women on pedestals.
</P>
<P>
   That's two.
</P>
<P>
   So, it's settled then. Size matters. Women who think otherwise
this summer are only selling themselves short.
</P>
<P>
   Some sandal styles this summer:
</P>
<P>
   Lucite wedge sandal ($420) by Gucci. At Bob Ellis Shoes.
</P>
<P>
   An airy multi-colored thong ($20) by Mixed Blues. At JCPenney.
</P>
<P>
   Linen-soled sandal ($370) by Prada. At Bob Ellis Shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Leopard print sandal ($20) by Mixed Blues. At JCPenney.

 &HT;    South Carolina scandal turns into a book
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the early 1980s, James Kilgo was presented with a tantalizing
story that no writer could resist. A cousin told him about a murder
and suicide in 1918 that left two brothers dead and a South
Carolina county scandalized. At the center of the tragedy was a
distant relative, a mixed-race woman who was loved by one brother
and lusted after by the other.
</P>
<P>
   Kilgo's re-creation of the story led him through years of
research into family secrets. One of his best sources was an older
family member who had been in his teens at the time. The man gave
Kilgo much of the background, but left out the part about the
woman. Then, a few weeks before his death, he revealed the woman at
the heart of the story and gave Kilgo a picture of her.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, Kilgo faced a dilemma of either telling the true
story and hurting some family members or casting it as a novel. He
took the fictional route.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once I started working on it,'' Kilgo says, ``the characters
started talking to each other, and that's when I really got excited
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The result is ``Daughter of My People'' (University of Georgia
Press, $24), Kilgo's debut novel, which early reviews have
described as ``sad, vivid, and haunting.'' Kilgo's earlier works
were two books of essays, ``Deep Enough for Ivorybills'' and
``Inheritance of Horses.''
</P>
<P>
   While the two brothers in the real-life story wound up dead, the
woman at the center of the tale lived into the 1960s. Kilgo wasn't
able to locate her burial site, but he knows that she married and
was around 85 at the time of her death.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to tell a story that evokes its time and place,''
Kilgo says, ``and I wanted to write a book that would touch and
move people.''
</P>
<P>
   -- RIDING HIGH: Georgia novelist P.T. Deutermann has just signed
a $500,000, two-book deal with St. Martin's Press. The former naval
commander has been slowly building a readership with military
thrillers such as ``Sweepers'' and ``Official Privilege,'' both of
which have been optioned for movies. Wesley Snipes is scheduled to
star in ``Official Privilege.'' Deutermann's next book, ``The
Trainman,'' is about a Unabomber-like terrorist.
</P>
<P>
   -- CHRISTMAS GIFT: Sometimes it pays to start small. Utah
legislator Richard Siddoway's first novel, ``The Christmas Wish,''
was published by Bookcraft, a small Utah press. Now Harmony Books
has bought the novel for repackaging, and CBS will air an
adaptation as a Sunday-night movie, starring Debbie Reynolds and
Neil Patrick Harris, in December. The story is about a man who
returns to his home in upstate New York after his grandfather dies
to discover how important the old man was to the town.
</P>
<P>
   -- WINNERS: The American Booksellers Association has selected
Charles Frazier's ``Cold Mountain'' as the 1998 Book of the Year in
the adult category. Jan Brett's ``The Hat'' won in the children's
category. The award honors titles that independent booksellers most
enjoyed recommending to their customers.

 &HT;    Uncovering the tale of a good etouffee
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL JUNE 7: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)

   Breaux Bridge, La.--Ailene Champagne Guidry died a couple of
years ago, but people in Cajun country will never forget the mother
of crawfish etouffee.
</P>
<P>
   She didn't create the most famous crawfish dish; people from
Baton Rouge to Lake Charles had long been cooking something like
it. She did, however, make an early version of it and give it a
name. And that's why her sepia-toned portrait hangs in a place of
honor in the Cafe des Amis, a restaurant on the main street of
Breaux Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   As the cafe's Dickie Breaux tells it, Miss Ailene learned the
recipe from two sisters who ran a hotel, and she served it when she
opened her own restaurant, the Rendezvous. One day in the
mid-1940s, a visitor from Lafayette asked her how she made the
dish, and she answered with a literal description in French: She
cooked it ``smothered'' (etouffee), meaning that she left the lid
on the skillet.
</P>
<P>
   ``She used to come in here and talk about how she'd catch the
Landry boys (competing restaurateurs) peeking in her window to see
how she did it,'' Breaux says. ``But she didn't really consider it
her dish. It was everybody's.''
</P>

<P>
   This is a simpler, kitchenized version of the Cafe des Amis
etouffee. ``It's not the same as the original,'' says Cynthia
Breaux. ``The original had more crawfish and a thinner sauce. Most
etouffees have thicker sauces these days.''

there; there are 72 crawfish recipes, from dips and salads to
breads and casseroles, in its promotional booklet (available by

   The crawfish boil is a rite of spring and early summer in
Louisiana. But if you didn't grow up with the little critters, as
most of us in Georgia didn't, it can all seem mysterious. Here's
what you do.
</P>
<P>
   Live crawfish are available through July at major farmers
markets such as DeKalb and Harry's. Keep them alive, cool and moist
(but not submerged in water). Before boiling, you'll have to clean
them well (they're ``mudbugs,'' after all). The easiest way is to
take them outside and douse them thoroughly with a sprayer hose on
a screen or old sweater rack. Look for the few that have died and
discard. Plan on cooking 4 or 5 pounds for every person.
</P>
<P>
   After boiling comes the intricate part: peeling and picking out
the tail meat. Take the crawfish with both hands and twist it apart
in the middle. If you want, suck the head to taste the juices and
the dab of yellow liver that's as buttery as foie gras. To eat the
tail, peel off the top ring of shell, hold the tip of the tail
between thumb and forefinger and squeeze the meat into your mouth.
If you pinch it right, the vein _ the crawfish's digestive canal _
will pull out along with the tail armor.
</P>
<P>
   When live crawfish season is over, you can get frozen, cleaned
tail meat year-round. The folks in Breaux Bridge would appreciate
it if you looked for the ``Product of Louisiana'' label.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the crawfish boil recipe we improvised over Memorial Day
weekend. At outdoor boils, crawfish are usually cooked in large
kettles or trash cans over a propane flame. We cooked them in small
batches at a kitchen stove, using the largest pot we had _ a
5-gallon canning steamer. Same taste, better air conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   Boiled Crawfish
</P>
<P>
   Makes 4 servings Preparation time: 30 minutes Cooking time: 30
minutes
</P>
<P>
   3gallons water
</P>
<P>
   1/2cup salt
</P>
<P>
   1package seafood boil
</P>
<P>
   1tablespoon creole seasoning
</P>
<P>
   1tablespoon cayenne pepper
</P>
<P>
   1teaspoon granulated garlic
</P>
<P>
   1teaspoon white pepper
</P>
<P>
   1teaspoon black pepper
</P>
<P>
   6pounds live crawfish
</P>
<P>
   In a large pot, place the water, salt, seafood boil, creole
seasoning, cayenne, granulated garlic and white and black pepper.
Stir and bring to a rolling boil. Pour in live crawfish. Boil for
10 minutes. Turn off heat and allow crawfish to soak up spices for
another 15 minutes. Strain out crawfish. If you're cooking more of
them, put them in an ice chest and sprinkle creole seasoning over
each new batch. Change the water and seasonings after two boils.
</P>
<P>
   Many Louisianians also boil vegetables in the crawfish water.
Tradition calls for new potatoes, whole onions and ears of corn.
Cook as much as you want by putting them into the water before the
last batch of crawfish. Then pour in the crawdaddies and let the
veggies soak up the flavor.

 &HT;    Lowly no more: The crawfish is king in Cajun country
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL JUNE 7: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Jim Auchmutey
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Breaux Bridge, La.--Kenneth ``Half Pint'' Thibodeaux _ that's
how he's listed in the phone book _ sounded like a Cajun musician
playing washboard as he scraped a spoon across the bottom of a pot
burbling with rich brown gravy. He was making a kind of music, all
right; he was fixing crawfish etouffee in the hope of beating 17
competitors in a cook-off. But unlike his rivals, he didn't seem
particularly curious about what the Guidrys and the Heberts and the
others were up to at their stoves. ``I eat at their houses all the
time,'' he said, ``so I know what their etouffee tastes like.''
</P>
<P>
   And they know what his etouffee tastes like?
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly. ``What I'm making today is all crawdaddies,''
Thibodeaux said, pausing for a swig of beer. He pulled closer and
lowered his voice. ``When I cook for company, I put some cream of
mushroom soup in there to stretch it. Crawfish is expensive.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when crawfish (or crayfish, as biologists and
Yankees call them) were as cheap as mud and about as respectable.
When outsiders first came to work in the Louisiana oil fields
decades ago, they cringed to think anyone would eat the grubby
critters they saw skittering through the drainage ditches. The
locals actually were eating a cleaner breed of crawfish from
freshwater bayous, but that didn't keep them from acting sheepish
about it. ``People ate them at home, but when they went out they
hid it,'' says Dickie Breaux, a restaurateur in Breaux Bridge, who
remembers how the old Cajun dining establishments had private rooms
with closed doors.
</P>
<P>
   No one is ashamed of crawfish nowadays. Not only do people peel
and suck them right out in the open, they celebrate them at events
like the crawfish festival they've held every May since 1960 in
Breaux Bridge, a town of 6,000 near Lafayette. The little
crustacean has become a big red banner of Cajun pride, a cultural
trademark as distinctive as a spicy French drawl or a jumping
accordion on Saturday night. Mr. Mudbug has gone to town.
</P>
<P>
   Cajuns love crawfish for their taste, of course; the chef Paul
Prudhomme likens the tender curl of tail meat to lobster dipped in
butter _ only you don't need the butter. But Cajuns love crawfish
for another reason as well: It reminds them of themselves. It's a
culinary underdog from the backwoods that had to scrap and claw its
way to acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say a crawfish is the bravest thing in the world. It'll
take its pincers to a train,'' says Elaine Hardy, a supervisor in a
crawfish processing plant near Breaux Bridge, her voice filled with
an admiration that's common in southern Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   Crawfish have been part of life for all her 59 years. ``I grew
up down in Butte la Rose when there was no roads, no electricity,
no nothing,'' she says. ``Whenever we wanted to have a party, we'd
just go out in the swamp with some bait and dip our basket in a
hole and get all the crawfish we wanted. We'd boil them bright red
and lay out some newspapers and, oh, it was delicious. I don't
think crawfish taste that good anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   When Hardy was a girl, Louisiana had no crawfish industry to
speak of. Today there are 98 plants processing crawfish from 3,600
farmers and fishermen. The fishermen bring in the bulk of the
catch, knifing into the bayous before dawn in pointed canoes called
pirogues. The rest comes from farmers who grow crawfish in ponds
created from flooded, off-season rice paddies.
</P>
<P>
   At midafternoon, the harvest starts arriving at plants like
Bayou Land Seafood, a gamey-smelling complex on a murky bayou
outside Breaux Bridge. The crawfish men pull into the loading bay,
their thigh boots still wet, and deliver bags full of live
crustaceans that beckon through the mesh with their tiny claws.
Most of them are flash-boiled and peeled for tail meat. Eighty
percent of it never leaves Louisiana. ``The main market for
crawfish is as far as a coonass can drive in a day,'' says Tom
Hymel, the local extension agent, using a slang term for Cajuns
that a non-Cajun would use only if he had good health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Like wine, the quality of crawfish varies from year to year.
Last season's mudbugs were sweet and large due to favorable weather
conditions. Not so this season's. As he examines the specimens
coming into Bayou Land, owner Roy Robin cannot hide his
disapppointment. ``Look at those peanuts,'' he says, poking at a
bag.
</P>
<P>
   Size and taste aren't the only worries in crawfish country. In
the early '90s, China started flooding the American market with
tail meat at less than half the domestic price. Soon the imports
were outselling Louisiana crawfish. Last year, under pressure from
the industry, the federal government enacted tariffs on Chinese
crawfish that have brought prices closer to parity and given the
domestic producers the break they say they needed to survive.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those producers are concentrated around Breaux Bridge,
where the biggest landmark is a drawbridge over Bayou Teche with
the image of a crawfish across the superstructure. It was there,
along a street marked ``Rue Pont,'' that crawfish fans started
gathering on an overcast Saturday morning last month for the parade
that kicked off their shellfish Mardi Gras. One of the topics of
conversation, as always, was the delicate matter of sucking.
</P>
<P>
   There are two types of people when it comes to eating crawfish:
those who suck and those who decline to suck. Make of it what you
will, but those who decline to suck the peppery juices and buttery
fats from the head section of a boiled crawfish tend to be women.
The gung-ho suckers _ the party-hearties who wear T-shirts that
plead, ``Pinch me, peel me, suck me'' _ are usually men.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never met a woman who sucks the head,'' declared Cherie
Bourque, the recently crowned Miss Etouffee, as she sat in a
convertible waiting for the parade to begin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just nasty,'' chimed in Mrs. Etouffee, Dawn Taylor, as
she straightened her tiara.
</P>
<P>
   The etouffee twosome were part of a royal turnout that included
a cracklin' queen, a boudin queen, a tamale queen and a crawfish
queen, king and pre-k queen identified by her sash as ``Li'l Miss
Pincer.'' They were joined in the procession by, among others, a
group of bon vivants who called themselves the Krewe d'Ecrevisse
(that's French for crawfish). Their float featured a 20-foot mudbug
with claws that might give Godzilla pause. ``We're confident that
we have built the world's biggest crawfish,'' said Steve Hebert,
resplendent in his sunglasses, Tabasco shirt and tie crawling with
plastic crawfish.
</P>
<P>
   After the parade, the festival got down to the serious business
of mass consumption. While hundreds stood in line for plates of
boiled crawfish, eight men with more ambitious appetites took their
places at a table in front of TV crews and a raucous crowd of
spectators. It was time for the ultimate test, the crawfish-eating
contest. There were eight entries from Louisiana (introduced to
cheers) and one from New York (booooooo!). ``You don't have to suck
the heads,'' the emcee told them mercifully, ``but you do have to
eat all the tail meat. We will be checking the shells.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd counted down the seconds, and they were off like a
pack of thoroughbred pigs. For 45 minutes, they peeled and
swallowed and guzzled beer and sweated and turned as red in the
face as their prey. Whenever a contestant looked like he was about
to keel over, someone in the audience would prod him on by shouting
something like, ``Go, big daddy, go!'' Halfway through, New York
threw in the towel. A few minutes later, another man stumbled off
the stage looking stunned and as bloated as a summer sausage.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the biggest daddy of all turned out to be a jowly
paper mill worker named Dane Howell. He laid waste to 19 pounds of
crawfish _ far short of the record set by a bar owner everyone knew
as ``Big Nick'' _ but an awesome performance nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   Howell had a novel explanation for his triumph. ``My wife left
me in December and I went from 260 to 180 pounds, so I've got
plenty of room for crawfish.''
</P>
<P>
   They always do in Louisiana.

MODERN GEORGIA'S YOUNG FOUNDING FATHERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Foreign Journal)  
(js) 
 By STEPHEN KINZER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TBILISI, Georgia _ Sitting in his Manhattan office in the spring
of 1995, Mikheil Saakashvili had every reason to look forward to a
lucrative career as a big-city lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Only 26, he had attended schools in Kiev, Strasbourg and
Florence, held a degree from Columbia Law School and was winning a
reputation for diligence and legal talent. After nightfall he was
likely to be found either at the Metropolitan Opera or cheering for
the New York Knicks at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Now he is a superstar of Georgian politics, hugely admired and
widely viewed as having unlimited potential.
</P>
<P>
   Saakashvili is among the most prominent of several dozen bright
and energetic young people who are playing important roles in
building a new post-Communist order here. The president of the
central bank, Mikheil Chkuaseli, was a swiftly rising 27-year-old
business manager when he was tapped for his new post last year.
More recently, a 30-year-old World Bank official, Irakli Managadze,
was named finance minister.
</P>
<P>
   Youth is on the rise not only in government but also in hundreds
of private groups that support causes ranging from organic farming
to protection of homeless children.
</P>
<P>
   Many organizers of these groups admire the new breed of
politician, but complain that while President Eduard Shevardnadze
encourages them, he refuses to purge older loyalists with whom he
worked in his days as Georgia's Communist boss when the republic
was part of the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not what he does that bothers us, but what he doesn't
do,'' complained Levan Ramishvili, a 26-year-old human rights
advocate who works for a group called the Liberty Institute. ``He
talks a lot about democracy, but when people around him are proven
to be corrupt or to violate human rights, he keeps them on as long
as possible because he values their loyalty. The reformers are
always having to fight the bad guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Saakashvili's transformation from freewheeling New York lawyer
to someone seen as a crusading hero of a struggling democracy began
when an old friend, Zura Zhvania, arrived at his New York office
with a remarkable offer. He said he had been sent by Shevardnadze
to recruit talented young Georgians to enter politics. The desired
qualifications were intelligence, energy, idealism and no
connection to the old Communist elite.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia was then in chaos, staggering under the weight of
corruption, separatist wars in breakaway provinces, deep poverty,
pressure from a resentful Russia, and criminality so severe that
few people dared to walk the streets after dark. Saakashvili
quickly succumbed to his friend's appeal and went with his
Dutch-born wife to Tbilisi, the Georgian capital.
</P>
<P>
   When Georgians voted in national elections in December 1995,
both Zhvania and Saakashvili won seats in Parliament. Since then
they have helped shape their country's resurrection and transition
to democracy. Zhvania, now 34, is the president of Parliament.
Saakashvili, 29, is chairman of a powerful committee charged with
creating a new electoral system, an independent judiciary and a
non-political police force.
</P>
<P>
   In public opinion surveys Saakashvili often rates as the second
most popular person in Georgia, trailing only Shevardnadze. A panel
of journalists and human rights advocates named him the country's
1997 ``man of the year.'' Some foreign diplomats are already
treating him as a future president.
</P>
<P>
   ``He drives the older politicians crazy,'' said Zurab Karumidze,
editor of a new English-language magazine. ``They're used to the
Soviet style, and suddenly they have to deal with this completely
Western-oriented guy. It's not just his beliefs that are Western,
but his style and his whole approach to politics and life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's smart and full of ideas, and it's really amazing what
he's accomplished in two years,'' Karumidze said. ``But we still
don't know what kind of a politician he'll make over the long term.
It's a jungle here.''
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in his parliamentary office, where a Georgian flag hangs
above a copy of the 1789 Declaration of the Rights of Man,
Saakashvili obviously relishes his role as one of modern Georgia's
founding fathers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, there are still people in positions of power here who
were brought up in the old regime, and they have a certain
suspicion of us,'' he said in rapid-fire, idiomatic English. ``They
accuse us not only of being radical, but also pro-Western. We admit
it. For us being pro-Western is not a matter of tactics but of
values.''

   ``Our goal is to make Georgia a model democracy for the whole
region, a stable country that will be successful internationally.
America taught me that you can go from nowhere to somewhere. I had
a lot of problems at the beginning, but in just a few years I had a
good job and an apartment on Central Park West. That shows a
society that's open and rewards work and merit. If we can
transplant those values here, our place in the history of this
country will be secure.''

 &HT;    Master P's `Last Don' puts reality on record
 &HT;    By Sonia Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Remarkably, Master P has stormed the charts with some pretty
simplistic music. But now, as the rapper, filmmaker and owner of No
Limit Records focuses on his obviously numerous outside interests,
he uses his double-CD farewell to tell a multidimensional story of
a hustler.
</P>
<P>
   First, he's a hustler. So he spends a good deal of this record
(like his others) basically yelling hustler mottoes in the guise of
songs: ``Get Your Paper,'' ``Ride,'' etc. Second, this is gangster
rap, so the language used is often harsh and the scenarios can be
violent (``Let's Get Em'').
</P>
<P>
   But unlike many in this subgenre, Master P does a good job of
explaining why those components have to be a part of ``Da Last
Don.'' They are a part of his life. And it's made easy to
understand that, after the violent loss of a younger brother and
two of the ghetto heroes (Tupac Shakur and the Notorious B.I.G.)
whom you may very well replace, if you want to be honest on record,
it might not always sound happy.
</P>
<P>
   But Master P doesn't wallow in the losses, either. He ends many
of these same graphic tracks with admonitions such as ``The
ghetto's got us crazy, but we've got to overcome.''
</P>
<P>
   Moving even further beyond the expected and the limitations of
some pretty unremarkable production, Master P uses his husky chants
to reveal his vulnerabilities. ``I'm a thug, but still mama's
baby,'' goes the chorus of ``Mama Raised Me.'' And the kinetic
``Thug Girl'' is directed to certain women with love. Then, on
``Black and White,'' he charges designer Tommy Hilfiger with
discrimination while assailing blacks for not supporting their own
retail outlets.
</P>
<P>
   Rapper Jay-Z once said that the better a rapper is, the closer
he can bring you to his experience. Here, Master P makes his
reality so clear that much more than his signature grunt resounds
in your ear long after the record goes off.
</P>
<P>
   ``MP Da
</P>
<P>
   Last Don''
</P>
<P>
   Master P. No Limit Records.
</P>
<P>
   29 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Master P saves his best for ``Da Last Don.''

<P>
   -- ``Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil'' (R) _ Director
Clint Eastwood did the unimaginable with the screen version of John
Berendt's fact-based book: He made it into an overlong, unfocused
bore. You can't argue with the ways the film compresses or alters
parts of the book; Berendt himself juggled the facts a little
cavalierly. But 30 minutes into the movie, renamed hustler ``Billy
Hanson'' (Jude Law) has been gunned down by Jim Williams (the
ill-used Kevin Spacey), and the film spins its wheels for the next
two hours. It hinges on a crime it can't convince us we should care
about. What we get is a tepid murder trial with sidebar excursions
into the eccentricities of Savannah. Even in his better work,
Eastwood's direction has been marked by flat, uninflected scenes.
That describes this whole movie. Eastwood keeps pulling the Lady
Chablis into the frame to liven things up. But it's more than one
hard-working girl can do. Grade: C -
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Home Alone 3'' (PG) _ The latest installment in the most
successful film franchise ever to center on child neglect.
Confident and precocious, Alex D. Linz is a more than adequate
replacement for Macaulay Culkin. He has at least a sequel in him
before the cuteness wears off. It's the central gimmick of these
movies that has become problematic. Like the first two, this was
written and produced by kiddie king John Hughes, and his knack for
figuring out ways to strand children without their parents is
getting kind of creepy. The series' cartoonish violence is at a
crowd-pleasing peak here, with the bad guys experiencing cranial
trauma, testicular bruising, hypothermia and electrocution.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B -
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Fall'' (R) _ If you're looking to replace your
``Showgirls'' tape for guilty-pleasure midnight viewing, you're in
luck. If you thought writer-director-producer-star Eric Schaeffer's
last flick, ``If Lucy Fell,'' was a vanity production, oh baby,
wait. He made out with Elle Macpherson in that one; this time
around he angles for sex scenes with Amanda De Cadenet. She plays a
married supermodel who falls (oh yeah, right) for Schaeffer's
cabdriver. He writes bad poetry and _ I swear, this is in the movie
_ inspires her to, um, maximum excitement by talking dirty to her
in the kitchen. It gets worse. Fabulously worse. Grade: D

 &HT;    The sure bet rides on `Oscar &AMP; Lucinda'
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Oscar &AMP; Lucinda'' (R)
</P>
<P>
   You have every reason to expect this period drama to lift you
away. After all, it stars smoldering Brit heartthrob Ralph Fiennes
(``The English Patient'') as the first half of the titular couple
and up-and-coming Australian actress Cate Blanchett (``Paradise
Road'') as the second.
</P>
<P>
   It's directed by Gillian Armstrong (``My Brilliant Career'') and
based on an award-winning contemporary novel. Set in the 19th
century, the film introduces us to our heroes by degrees _ Oscar, a
gawky British minister; Lucinda, an unexpected Australian heiress,
who funnels her money into a glassworks. What they have in common
is a love of gambling, at the time as scandalous a pursuit as
anything Pamela or Tommy Lee might have done.
</P>
<P>
   As the movie unfolds their kind-of-almost love story, the
old-fashioned frame of the narrative gets peppered by modern
notions of fate, chance and plain old miscommunication. The result
is like the glass Lucinda loves: ravishingly beautiful, but chilly,
distant and brittle. Grade: B -
</P>
<P>
   Other films by Armstrong: ``Starstruck,'' ``High Tide,'' ``Mrs.
Soffel,'' ``The Last Days of Chez Nous.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Manhattan Tap took a trip around the world in
``Excursion Fare'' on Tuesday night at the Joyce Theater. And with
this imaginative new show, the company comes close to bridging the
gap between old- and new-style tap, with dancing that is intimate
and as intimately involved with the music as any tap soloist and
instrumentalist.
</P>
<P>
   It was an inspired idea to join Manhattan Tap with the
Crosspulse music ensemble. The six dancers and five musicians are
equal as performers in this program. One duet is a whispered
conversation between the dancing feet of Heather Cornell, director
of the dance company and of ``Excursion Fare,'' and the soft
percussive tapping of sticks manipulated by Keith Terry, director
of the musicians. It soon becomes clear that the dance and the
music are two ways of using the body to make music.
</P>
<P>
   Terry also performs the old ``patting Juba'' or ``hambone'' folk
style of slapping the body. And Jackeline Rago nearly steals the
show in a maraca solo whose hushed beat magically fills the
theater. The accent throughout the evening is on quiet pleasures,
enhanced by the subtly shifting color that fills the stage space,
designed by Stephan Quandt. The choreography is by Ms. Cornell,
Germaine Ingram, Michael Minery and Terry.
</P>
<P>
   The staging is sleek but a little cute at times and the music
and dance can come perilously close to sheer appropriation of other
cultures.
</P>
<P>
   But a flamenco number, performed by Olivia Rosenkrantz, is
typical of the richly textured footwork of the entire dance
company, which also included Charon Aldredge, Maria Bostwick,
Parris Mann and Minery.
</P>
<P>
   The similarly textured, burnishing music was performed on
everything from guitars and drums to the Balinese gamelan and South
Indian solkatu. The Crosspulse ensemble was completed by Edgardo
Cambon, Claudia Gomez and Raymond Graham. ``Excursion Fare'' will
be performed through Sunday at the Joyce, 175 Eighth Avenue, at
19th Street.

 &HT;    Smashing Pumpkins try new route, but its a dead end
 &HT;    By Doug Hamilton
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Why do potentially potent rockers equate maturity with
diminished energy and growth with, well, not rocking? It happens
all too often: Your favorite artist describes the latest opus as a
``more serious, more adult work.'' Then you go out and buy the
thing and find it as limp as overcooked linguine.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Corgan is the latest rock hero to succumb to
mature-artist-itis. The front man and primary visionary for the
Smashing Pumpkins, Corgan has signaled in recent interviews that
he's moving away from their signature sound (loud, layered guitars
and mucho screeching). Rumor had it that the follow-up to 1995's
sprawling smash ``Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness'' would be
an acoustic set, but it's not so much that as it is muted.
``Adore,'' the Pumpkins' fourth album, begins with a whisper _ the
tepid ballad ``To Sheila'' _ and never rises above a dull roar
(emphasis on the ``dull''). Keyboards and cheesy electronic
percussion sub for guitars and ex-member Jimmy Chamberlain's
much-missed drumming. Corgan's pinched vocals, always their best at
full scream, flirt with wispiness.
</P>
<P>
   The album is not without low-key charms. ``Ava Adore,'' the
synth-driven first single, is a canny impression of Depeche Mode.
``Behold! The Night Mare'' lifts the disc's second half out of its
torpor with a lovely, Brian Wilson-inspired melody. But, overall,
the mournful motif feels forced. It's as if Corgan took the
``Infinite Sadness'' part of the previous album's title to its
literal extreme. And, coming from one of rock's last angry young
men, that's a crying shame.
</P>
<P>
   ``Adore''
</P>
<P>
   Smashing Pumpkins. Virgin.
</P>
<P>
   16 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Even hard-core fans may not adore the Pumpkins'
largely languid latest.

 &HT;    `Truman' lets Carrey `Show' his stuff
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's time for the question. The question that has put Jim Carrey
on the cover of Time, Movieline, New York and Entertainment Weekly
in recent days. The question he's facing all over as he talks to
journalists about his new film, ``The Truman Show,'' opening
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the question comes out something like this: How does
Jim Carrey, the movies' bona fide premier funny guy, make the
transition to bona fide premier funny guy ... and more?
</P>
<P>
   ``I already have,'' he replies simply in a telephone interview.
``I made the movie. Whether it comes together financially is out of
my hands.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``comes together financially'' is a guarded reference to
1996's ``The Cable Guy,'' the first _ and thus far, only _ disaster
in a foolproof career built on such foolishness as the two ``Ace
Ventura'' flicks, ``Dumb and Dumber'' and ``The Mask.'' ``The Cable
Guy'' was supposed to introduce moviegoers to a ``different''
Carrey. A ``darker'' Carrey. Just how a script written originally
for the now-late Chris Farley was supposed to do that was never
quite clear. But the film bombed, and Carrey took the brunt of the
criticism for trying to be ``different'' and ``darker.''
</P>
<P>
   Now comes ``The Truman Show,'' which has also been tagged with
those ``d'' words. But this is no Chris Farley discard. Directed by
Peter Weir (``Witness,'' ``Gallipoli''), it's a complex, funny,
multileveled meditation on matters ranging from the pervasiveness
of our TV nation mentality to theological questions filtered
through a camera lens.
</P>
<P>
   Carrey plays Truman Burbank, an insurance salesman who, without
knowing it, is actually the star of a hugely successful
long-running TV series. Everyone in his life is an actor, from his
pert wife (Laura Linney) to his loyal best friend (Noah Emmerich).
</P>
<P>
   Linney, for one, isn't surprised by her co-star's range.
``There's always more to someone than just one thing. And when
you're really talented, you want to be able to explore that,'' she
says.
</P>
<P>
   Carrey puts it this way: ``This is an opportunity for me to show
more colors. But there was no master plan. No telling my agent, `Go
out and find me a drama!' It simply came my way and I chose to do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean he'll never talk through his butt again, as he
did in ``Ace Ventura, Pet Detective.'' ``It's not like I never want
to do that stuff again. But I absolutely want to have a career
where you make'em laugh and make'em cry. It's all theater. ''
</P>
<P>
   It's a career that sounds a lot like, oh, say, Tom Hanks'. It's
a comparison he's heard before. He says of Hanks: ``He's had an
incredible career. He's really done it right.''
</P>
<P>
   But here's one he hasn't heard: With his leading man good looks
and his funny man reflexes, could he be a Danny Kaye of the '90s?
The reply is unintelligible, like Robin Williams channeling Michael
Jackson. Say what? He laughs. ``Oh, that's just how `Wonderful
Copenhagen' (a song in Kaye's ``Hans Christian Andersen'') sounds
in my head.''
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is, Carrey simply doesn't want to be stuck in a
rut. He points out, ``In a lot of ways, that's what `Truman' is
about, a man who feels repressed and trapped. But every day he puts
a smile on his face and goes out the door.''
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, Hollywood's $20 million man knows a thing or two
about being trapped. He watched his father, a Canadian businessman,
put a smile on his face and go out the door every day to a job he
loathed. Then, at age 51, after 30 years with the company, he was
laid off. Carrey and his siblings had to quit high school and take
menial jobs at a tire factory. At one point, the family was living
out of a VW van.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps those hard times gave Carrey his Silly Putty
resiliency; it took him 15 years to become an overnight sensation.
Up next is ``Man on the Moon,'' in which he plays Andy Kaufman, the
cutting-edge comic who died of lung cancer at 35. Then it's back to
the dumb 'n' dumber stuff in ``The Incredible Mr. Limpet,'' a role
originated, if that's the word, by Don Knotts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lineup is really exciting.'' Carrey says. ``It's amazing
the things I've tripped into. But you can't settle for things.
You've always got to try doing something different. You've got to
have a choice.''
</P>
<P>
   He laughs again. ``I could do `Ace Ventura 6,' but the fact is,
you'd get tired of me a lot quicker than you think.''

 &HT;    EVOLUTION OF A CAREER: JIM CARREY
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   -- ``Ace Ventura, Pet Detective'' (1994). A gunshoe goofball is
born. Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   -- ``The Mask'' (1994). The actor shows some depth. Carrey plays
a mild-mannered clerk who flips out and comes off as sweet as he is
manic. Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Dumb and Dumber'' (1994). Road trip. The most lowbrow, and
possibly the funniest, of Carrey's 1994 ``Doofus Trilogy.'' Grade:
B+
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls'' (1995). The sequel has the
same winning combination as the original: idiotic plot, inspired
Carrey. And that scene inside the rhino. Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Batman Forever'' (1995). As the Riddler, Carrey is the
film's best special effect _ leering, prancing and spouting his
riotous nonsense. Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   -- ``The Cable Guy'' (1996). A horror, but not one of Carrey's
making. Its signals are so disastrously scrambled that not even its
hard-working $20 million star can rescue it. Grade: D
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Liar Liar'' (1997). A selfish Carrey goes over the top,
wears out his welcome. Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   -- ``The Truman Show'' (1998). Carrey loses the silliness and
gains an even brighter future. Grade: A.
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Man on the Moon'' (Release TBA): With his next film, Carrey
may well complete his transformation to dramatic leading man with
the bitter-funny biopic of comedian Andy Kaufman.

 &HT;    CNN Newsstand finally hits the air on Sunday
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sunday night, for the first time in 17 years, James Earl Jones
will not intone ``This is CNN.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he'll say, ``This is CNN NewsStand.''
</P>
<P>
   That brief but telling break with tradition is the network's way
of signaling that ``NewsStand'' is not news as usual. The new
magazine series, a co-operative venture with Time, Fortune and
Entertainment Weekly, is CNN's biggest initiative ever, an attempt
to get viewers to think differently about the network.
</P>
<P>
   Another sign of the importance of ``NewsStand'' within CNN: In
President Richard Kaplan's office, the photos on the shelves behind
his desk are all of his family, save one. It's an 8x10 publicity
photo of the five ``NewsStand'' anchors in a silver frame.
</P>
<P>
   And yet Kaplan knows the hard truth of starting a TV
newsmagazine show.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is all magazine shows start in the dumper almost,
or at least they start off needing fixing,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``NewsStand'' is CNN's most extensive attempt to fix its largest
problem: the peaks and valleys of Nielsen ratings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have these enormous (ratings) spikes when something
important really hits the fan,'' says Tom Johnson, chairman of the
CNN Newsgroup and Kaplan's boss. ``But when that news environment
becomes more calm, people go back to watching sports or movies or
soap operas.''
</P>
<P>
   So Kaplan, aided by more than 100 CNN staffers over nine months
of brain-storming, development, prototypes, a three-month delay,
new hires and incessant on-air promotion, is bringing forth
``NewsStand'' with the idea that it will evolve into what TV
executives call ``appointment TV.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal, if I may put it modestly,'' says anchor Jeff
Greenfield, ``is to be a place where people know that at 10 o'clock
at night, they might find something interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   Joining Greenfield, who left ABC to come work for CNN and
``NewsStand,'' will be Bernard Shaw for the Time and CNN shows.
Willow Bay and Judd Rose, also defectors from ABC (where Kaplan
worked for years) will anchor ``CNN &AMP; Entertainment Weekly,'' and
Bay and CNN veteran Stephen Frazier will anchor ``CNN &AMP; Fortune.''
</P>
<P>
   It's difficult to overstate how much work has gone into
``NewsStand,'' although the results remain to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trying to translate a magazine to television is incredibly
hard,'' says Teya Ryan, executive producer of ``CNN &AMP; Fortune.''
``They are fundamentally such different mediums, and there are just
infinite details.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The tough job is to find the right stories,'' says Rose.
``Very smart, serious, edgy stuff that I don't see a lot of on
television.'' He says ``EW,'' like the magazine it's based on, will
be much more in-depth than CNN's ``Showbiz Today'' or the
syndicated ``Entertainment Tonight,'' more about the business of
show business than the latest movie premiere.
</P>
<P>
   ``NewsStand'' will be the only network newsmagazine show
actually based on magazines. Time, EW and Fortune are all owned by
Time Warner Inc., which also owns CNN. To insiders, this represents
smart synergy. To outsiders, it may look more like cross-promotion
from a network that values its credbility.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Time Warner chairman) Gerald Levin and Ted Turner took an
attitude of 'If you can work it out, great, if you can't, fine. We
don't want to push people into unnatural relationships,' '' says
Kaplan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Judge us by what we do,'' Greenfield says of the corporate
co-operation.
</P>
<P>
   The show enters a TV marketplace already saturated with network
newsmagazines. ``Dateline NBC'' expands to five nights a week in
the fall, ABC pushes ``20/20'' to three times a week, and CBS's two
hours (``60 Minutes,'' ``48 Hours'') make 10 hours a week of
network newsmagazines, plus the four ``NewsStands.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The clutter doesn't really concern me,'' says Kaplan. ``When
shows like 'PrimeTime Live' (which Kaplan produced at ABC) or
'Public Eye With Bryant Gumbel' come on, people wonder: What is it
about? Everybody knows what Time, Fortune and Entertainment Weekly
are about, so defining ourselves is not an issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, CNN is expecting what Pat Mitchell, president of CNN
Productions, calls ``a very slow build.'' Advertisers have been
told to expect no increase (fewer than 500,000 homes watching) at
first in the ratings over the regular newscasts ``NewsStand'' is
replacing. ``These shows don't do well when they premiere,'' Kaplan
says.
</P>
<P>
   They also run the risk of being dramatically re-worked at the
last minute in the event of breaking news. The shows are all taped,
but the anchors will be on stand-by to go live if needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will throw out the show to go to breaking news,'' says
Mitchell. ``'Cause that's what CNN does.''

 &HT;    ``NewsStand'': a closer look
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Each ``NewsStand'' hour will have three major stories and lots
of smaller bits, the briefest of which are called
``interstitials.'' ``Dateline NBC's'' Timeline feature is an
example of an interstitial.
</P>
<P>
   But each show will reflect the elements of the magazine it's
based on:
</P>
<P>
   -- Time: Sunday's premiere will feature a Peter Arnett report
that CNN is keeping under wraps. It involves a new disclosure of a
secret U.S. operation inside Laos. Each show will end with an essay
called ``The Looking Glass,'' similar to Time's back page, with
Jeff Greenfield doing several. His first, on Sunday, will be on the
responsibility of the TV viewer for much of what's wrong with TV
news coverage. Bits will include People and Milestones.
</P>
<P>
   -- Fortune: Wednesday's premiere will look at ``Face Reading,''
a business consultancy that says it can tell bosses whom to hire
based on facial features. A weekly spot will be Coolest Office,
going inside the offices of famous and not-so-famous business
leaders. Bits will include Techno-File, From the Pages Of (editors
and writers' column), Fortune Investor (news-you-can-use help).
Upcoming stories: Michael Jordan's endorsement empire, Magic
Johnson's movie chain and an agent who represents Silicon Valley
software designers.
</P>
<P>
   -- Entertainment Weekly: The June 11 premiere will have an
interview with Sean Lennon and a look at Hollywood spin doctors.
One of readers' favorite features, Jim Mullen's Hot Sheet (a
broader-based, funnier version of Letterman's Top 10), will be an
interstitial, with an animated Mullen. (The real one wasn't very
telegenic.) EW's critics and editors will do a weekly roundtable,
and Encore (the where-are-they-now back page) will be a weekly
feature. Upcoming stories: How focus groups sometimes change the
endings of movies, a look at TV's ``The X-Files'' and Burt
Bacharach's comeback.

 &HT;    Fences not enough; other protective measures for pool safety
recommended
 &HT;    By Alma E. Hill
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA--It requires more than just a big fence to prevent
children from drowning in pools. Although that helps, keeping a
close eye on children and using other protective measures are more
effective, health experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Drowning is the third-leading cause of death in children under
5. In Georgia, 241 people younger than 19 drowned between 1990 and
1994, according to the Injury Control Section in the state
Department of Human Resources. The most recent occurred Sunday in
metro Atlanta, when 6-year-old twins drowned in a residential
swimming pool.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every year we hear about drownings. The horrible thing is that
they are preventable,'' said pediatrician Karen Dewling of the
Emory Clinic.
</P>
<P>
   To help prevent drowning accidents, Dewling advises parents and
caregivers to watch young children at all times when they are near
any body of water.
</P>
<P>
   Children who are good swimmers also should be supervised,
Dewling said, because they could have muscle cramps or other
physical problems while swimming that could lead to an accident.
Children can drown in as little as 30 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   The Centers for Disease Control recommends that residential
pools be surrounded on all four sides with a fence and
self-latching gate, in addition to having a fence around the yard.
</P>
<P>
   If it is possible to walk from inside the house or yard directly
to the swimming pool, ``you don't have appropriate prevention
strategies to prevent small children from gaining access to the
pool,'' said Christine Branche, director of the Division of
Unintentional Injury Prevention at the CDC's National Center for
Injury Prevention and Control.
</P>
<P>
   But pool fences alone are not enough to prevent the majority of
drownings in children. Only 19 percent of the fatalities might have
been prevented with proper fencing, according to a CDC study of 584
children who drowned in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Laws in Georgia regulating residential swimming pools vary by
county. For example, in Fulton County pools must be surrounded by a
5-foot fence. However, one side of the barrier can be the house.
The fence can be wrought iron, wooden, aluminum or chain link, and
the links must be set closely together to prevent climbers.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to adequate fencing, Branche recommends that
homeowners use pool covers or alarms when the pools are not in use.
A cover would conceal the water, making it less appealing to a
child. An alarm would send off a warning that an object, such as a
toy or a child, had broken the surface of the water.

ANALYSIS: EVEN BRAVE THEATERS MUST COURT THEIR BACKERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By PETER APPLEBOME   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK: Last month, before his play `Corpus Christi'' was
canceled and then reinstated, the playwright Terrence McNally gave
a luncheon speech to a theater group in Manhattan listing the nine
things every playwright needed to know.
</P>
<P>
   ``Write plays that matter,'' he said, getting to No. 7 on the
list he read to the New Dramatists on May 12. ``Raise the stakes.
Shout, yell, holler, but make yourself heard. It's time for
playwrights to reclaim the theater. We do that by speaking from the
heart about the things that matter most to us. If a play isn't
worth dying for, maybe it isn't worth writing.''
</P>
<P>
   The chill that swept the theater world when McNally's play was
canceled after the Manhattan Theater Club received telephoned death
threats was precisely about the fear that raising the stakes can be
particularly risky at a time of raw political and religious
sensitivities and when serious drama is increasingly dependent on
revenue from image-conscious contributors.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of ``Corpus Christi,'' the Catholic League for
Religious and Civil Rights threatened to wage war against anyone
who staged the play, which features a gay Jesus-like figure who has
sex with his disciples offstage.
</P>
<P>
   The Manhattan Theater Club, one of the most respected theatrical
groups in the city, last Thursday agreed to reinstate McNally's
play after announcing a week earlier that it was removing it from
its fall schedule following the threats. The Catholic League
disavowed knowledge of the calls and said it condemned the threat
or use of violence.
</P>
<P>
   The theater club said its decision to withdraw the play was
based solely on security. But beyond the threats, much of the alarm
occasioned by the incident stemmed from the recognition among
theater people that serious drama depends in large part on outside
donors, like politically sensitive corporations, and how vulnerable
that can leave theater groups seeking both adventurous fare and a
broad audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Funding for the arts is becoming more and more difficult for
those out there chasing money,'' said Jim Nicola, artistic director
of the New York Theater Workshop, one of the city's major nonprofit
theaters, which also include the Roundabout and Lincoln Center
Theaters. ``There's very little fortitude among the funders for any
scent of scandal or controversy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The interesting thing to me about `Corpus Christi' was TWA's
withdrawal of its support,'' he added. ``What this really showed
was that if we're going to proceed, we need partnerships and
funders with courage and reliability, and that's getting harder and
harder to find.''
</P>
<P>
   Some theater people said the incident was a reflection of just
how intimidating the current political atmosphere can be.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very conservative time for the arts,'' said the
playwright Tony Kushner. ``You have the dismantling of the National
Endowment for the Arts, the defunding of arts organizations and the
increasing timidity of corporate sponsors. It has arts groups
running scared. Everyone's trying to be brave and hold the line,
but they remember how debilitating the debacles with the NEA were
and they're afraid to go through it again.''
</P>
<P>
   But the courts have created an environment hostile to outright
censorship of the arts, Kushner said. And other theatrical veterans
said that for all the ruckus, they did not find the current
political environment much more daunting than in the past,
certainly not more daunting that the McCarthy era of the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Producers are still willing to break their necks to put good
material onstage, and we have playwrights who are afraid of
nothing,'' said Alexander Cohen, a longtime Broadway producer.
``But plays of this kind of substance are essentially going the way
of the dodo bird, because the money is going to grand spectacles
featuring special effects. So we turn to our nonprofit theaters for
these kind of adventurous productions.''
</P>
<P>
   To many experts, that's the real difference between a
controversy that inflames public passions now and those in the
past, like the one surrounding ``The Deputy,'' by Rolf Hochhuth, a
German playwright. It created a furor in 1964 with its message that
Pope Pius XII was morally bankrupt in not denouncing Hitler and the
Nazi death camps.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, controversial fare essentially had to depend on the
interest and support of theatergoers and investors. Now the vast
majority of truly challenging fare is presented by nonprofit
theaters. And they are dependent for their money on more than box
office and traditional investors.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, tickets sales provided about $4.3 million, or less than
half the Manhattan Theater Club's $10 million budget. Private and
government grants accounted for just over $3 million, and the rest
came from special events, royalties and subsidiary rights and other
sources.
</P>
<P>
   Jed Bernstein, executive director of the League of American
Theaters and Producers, said that in the end both for-profit
theaters and their nonprofit sisters faced pretty much the same
pressure: the need to attract audiences. In that sense, a boring
noncontroversial production sometimes can be just as lethal as one
that is deemed offensive.
</P>
<P>
   But the comparison with ``The Deputy'' may still be instructive
in other ways.
</P>
<P>
   In his review in The New York Times, Howard Taubman wrote, ``Our
theater rarely touches on moral issues of this magnitude,'' both a
tribute to the play and a commentary on how rare truly
groundbreaking theater, at least on Broadway, was then and is now.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest difference, several people in the theater said, is
that the potential for violent protest or genuine terrorism is much
more on people's minds now. They said that left less room for
second-guessing the sincerity if not necessarily the wisdom of the
Manhattan Theater Club's initial decision to back away from the
play.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy for the sideline sitters to be judgmental, but when
you have 11-year-olds committing massacres, you look at these
things differently than you used to,'' said Emanuel Azenberg,
another veteran producer.

 &HT;    Ohio teams get ready for upcoming State rivalry
 &HT;    By Hal McCoy
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ They are on the banks of San Francisco Bay at
Candlestick Point, but some can't help but let their minds drift
toward the shores of Lake Erie.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as the Cincinnati Reds finish their chores with the San
Francisco Giants, they return home to hopefully play ungracious
hosts to the Cleveland Indians over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Taubensee, Jeff Shaw, Danny Graves and Scott Winchester _
all former Indians _ admit their anticipation rivals Christmas Eve
when they were greedy-minded kids. For Taubensee, the spike is on
the other foot. He played briefly for the Indians in 1991 _ 105
losses, dreary Cleveland Municipal Stadium, manager John McNamara.
</P>
<P>
   ``McNamara got fired and Mike Hargrove was hired,'' Taubensee
said. ``They were beginning their transition period . . . and I was
part of the transition. They made me a transaction.''
</P>
<P>
   After the 1991 season, Taubensee and pitcher Willie Blair were
traded to Houston for Dave Rohde and some character named Kenny
Lofton.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time, the Reds had just won the World Series (1990), so
everybody said Cincinnati had the great organization,'' Taubensee
said. ``Now that the Indians are winning, everybody says that's the
great organization. That's the definition of a great organization .
. . a winning organization.''
</P>
<P>
   Taubensee is looking forward to the three-game set in Cinergy
because the stadium will be packed, even though he realizes the
majority will be Cleveland fans who can purchase tickets in
sold-out Jacobs Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's fine,'' he said. ``Maybe we can win some of them over.
Hopefully we don't lose some of our fans to them. But we're
defending state champions. We beat them two of three in Cleveland
last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaw carries an ingrained dislike for Hargrove and general
manager John Hart. He was Cleveland's No. 1 draft choice in 1986,
but he remembers the day in late 1992 when Hargrove called him into
his office and told him, ``You'll never pitch in the major leagues.
You aren't good enough.''
</P>
<P>
   That stuck in Shaw's craw like a chicken bone and to this day he
says, ``Every time I get a save I hope Hargrove picks up the paper
and sees it. I never got a fair shake there and I can't care if you
are a No. 1 draft pick or a No. 100 draft pick you don't treat
people that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitchers Graves and Winchester are recent-vintage former
Indians, from the successful days, acquired last July in the trade
that sent John Smiley to Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Winchester, a starter, won't face the Indians _ but wishes he
were.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be kinda fun,'' he said. ``You like to face a team
that signed you (14th, 1995) and it would be a great challenge with
that lineup and those hitters.''
</P>
<P>
   Winchester calls the two organizations, ``Two teams going in
different directions. The Indians are trying to win the World
Series and utilize their minor leaguers (in trades) to put them
over the top. Cincinnati operates right now by using veteran
major-league players to get young minor-league players . . . the
two organizations are in two different points of time _ the Indians
trying to win now, the Reds trying to win later.''
</P>
<P>
   Graves is full of anticipation at the possibility of facing his
former team out of the bullpen and has been since last winter when
he told his wife, Andre, ``I hope I'm in the big leagues with the
Reds when they play Cleveland.''
</P>
<P>
   Why?
</P>
<P>
   ``Not that I think they made a mistake trading me, but you
always want a chance to show your old team you can pitch in the big
leagues,'' he said
</P>
<P>
   Difference in the two organizations? Plenty.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in the young and cheaper development stage,'' Graves
said. ``Over there, they're ready to win the World Series. The
situation for young players is better with the Reds. The Indians
don't have time to develop players at the major-league level. The
Reds do and that's better for young players. You can't learn to
pitch in the minors watching major-league games every night on
SportsCenter. You learn by pitching in the majors.''
</P>
<P>
   And Graves hopes part of his education advances this weekend
against the Indians.

 &HT;    Futures of Bates, Walker unsure
 &HT;    By Rick Cantu
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Two of the most popular football players in
Dallas were absent when Cowboys coach Chan Gailey introduced
special teams at Tuesday's minicamp.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bates and Herschel Walker, two of the league's best
special-teams players, have not been offered contracts for 1998 and
are not eligible to attend camp. It's unclear whether either player
will be offered a contract before the start of summer camp on July
16.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey said Bates and Walker have not been forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   ``As for Herschel, we're still in the decision-making process
with that,'' Gailey said. ``Right now we have that on hold. Bill
Bates is in the same situation. We're trying to evaluate where we
are as a football team.''
</P>
<P>
   Bates and Walker are unrestricted free agents, meaning they are
free to negotiate with any team. Both, however, are hoping to
extend their careers with the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of the three-day camp at Valley Ranch is to install
special teams and ``rehash'' the offense Gailey installed earlier
this spring. After Tuesday's practice Gailey said the players have
been taught 85 percent of the offense.
</P>
<P>
   No player has benefited more from Gailey's offense than Billy
Davis, who is No. 2 on the depth chart at wide receiver.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to put myself on a pedestal but, at the same
time, I'm not going to put myself on any lower step than someone
else,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey has installed four- and five-receiver sets. At times the
Cowboys line up three receivers on one side of the field. Gailey
stopped short of calling it a ``gimmick'' offense, saying he wants
to have a run-pass balance.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys are expected to keep six receivers _ Davis, Michael
Irvin, Stepfret Williams, Ernie Mills, Macey Brooks and newcomer
Jimmy Oliver.
</P>
<P>
   On defense, veteran defensive end Tony Tolbert remains with the
team but no one is certain how much longer he'll be around. Chronic
knee problems have hurt Tolbert, who counts about $3.4 million
against the salary cap. The Cowboys would save $2 million against
the cap if they cut him.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt that a healthy Tony Tolbert would help this
football team,'' Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   NOTES: Nate Newton reported to minicamp at 293 pounds, an
all-time low for the 13-year veteran who weighed nearly 380 last
season. Strength Coach Joe Juraszek wants Newton to gain 25 pounds
of muscle by training camp. ... Center Clay Shiver weighed in at
285 pounds, an increase of 20 pounds from last season.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys have a tentative scrimmage set against New Orleans
on Aug. 11 in Shreveport. ... Wide receiver Michael Irvin, after
learning that the temperature in Wichita Falls has hovered near the
100-degree mark for weeks, said, ``As soon as Deion (Sanders) heard
that, he decided his ankle started to hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Troy Aikman said he recently encouraged Denver's
John Elway to return for his 16th NFL season. ``Selfishly, I wanted
him to come back. He's great for the NFL. I have a lot of respect
for John in the way he handles himself. He's a goodwill ambassador
for the game, and you hate to see the league lose guys like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Cowboys Coach Barry Switzer attended minicamp Tuesday,
talking about his new movie ``Varsity Blues,'' which was filmed in
Austin.

AS MODERN AND SWANKY AS ALL THOSE SWELLS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 7) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 Art Spiegelman is a contributing artist to the New Yorker. His most
recent children's book is ``Open Me ... I'm a Dog.''  
 By ART SPIEGELMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Cartoonists have often been, um, caricatured by the
lay public as semiliterate louts whose art training consisted of
doodling nasty pictures in notebook margins during high school.
</P>
<P>
   This is indeed how I honed my own craft as a cartoonist, but the
dismissive attitude toward cartoons has left me feeling insecure
about where my discipline is perceived in the hierarchy of the
arts. A walk through the National Portrait Gallery's current
exhibition in Washington, ``Celebrity Caricature in America,''
offers overwhelming reassurance that at least one branch of my
stunted family tree gracefully reached the celestial heights of the
so-called high arts.
</P>
<P>
   The 229 drawings, paintings and artifacts on view through Aug.
23 trace the rise of a new, formally playful approach to caricature
that flowered in the years between the two world wars. These images
are not in the tradition of Daumier's or Nast's scathing
19th-century visual indictments of the corrupt and powerful, but
offer a light, almost judgment-free abstract portraiture born in
response to that new 20th-century creation, the celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   Celebrity, a notion that came into being through movies,
theater, radio and mass-media magazines, is fame lite, based at
least as much on personality as actual achievement.
</P>
<P>
   This show shimmers with luminaries like Babe Ruth, Will Rogers
and Josephine Baker. Bootleggers, strippers and even politicians
could enter this new pantheon of the caricatured if they were
colorful enough.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition includes enticing sideshow attractions like a
flapper's silk dress with a pattern made of famous Hollywood faces,
a reconstruction of a Sardi's banquette complete with framed
original caricatures of Broadway celebrities and continual
screenings of vintage films in which Mickey Mouse and other
animated creatures frolic with caricatured stars.
</P>
<P>
   All of this attests to the fadlike popularity of this
phenomenon, and the exhibition's curator, Wendy Wick Reaves,
admirably pursues the sociological and historical implications of
it all; more important, by returning repeatedly to a handful of
significant artists who are especially well represented here, she
calls attention to an overlooked tribe of modernists.
</P>
<P>
   I realize that it would be safer to categorize these
caricaturists as sophisticated clowns or, at most, popularizers of
modern art. One might be seduced into nostalgia by the sounds of
George Gershwin, Irving Berlin, Cole Porter and Noel Coward that
literally accompany the show. It would be a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rhapsody in Blue,'' for example, does conjure up the glamorous
world of Manhattan's cafe society, the white-tie-and-tails crowd of
the rich and talented who are the subjects of many of these images,
but it also provides an important clue to the art on display.
</P>
<P>
   Gershwin's jazz symphony is the perfect musical analogue to the
complex interaction between ``high'' and ``low'' forms that
resulted in modernism and inspired this new,
stripped-to-its-essentials approach to portraiture.
</P>
<P>
   A small black-and-white drawing for The New York World by
William Auerbach-Levy reduces Gershwin to a disembodied profile cut
off at the neck, virtually suspended from the enormous cigar that
is clamped in his mouth at a jaunty angle.
</P>
<P>
   There is a mysterious Easter Island solemnity to this spare
drawing that is emphasized by the total absence of even an eyeball
and only partly undercut by that goofy cigar. Cartoonists are often
noted as iconoclasts, but these caricaturists applied their skills
as icon makers, carving totems of the new secular gods ushered in
by the mass media.
</P>
<P>
   They portrayed the celebrity's persona, not the person's inner
soul, and they did it with the precision of a corporate logo, the
grace of a Matisse painting and the astringent wit of a Noel Coward
lyric.
</P>
<P>
   A rich watercolor portrait of Coward, also by Auerbach-Levy,
tints his face yellow so that it resembles a jaundiced,
nicotine-stained, grimacing plaster cast. The majestic swoop of the
Brooklyn Bridge seen through the window behind him rhymes with the
angle of his arm, functioning as a reminder of how dominant
Manhattan was to the world portrayed here. (How could this show not
have been picked up by a museum or gallery in New York?)
</P>
<P>
   The whole painting seems to be a direct illustration of a quote
by Coward: ``It's all a question of masks, really, brittle painted
masks. We all wear them as a form of protection; modern life forces
us to. We must have some means of shielding our timid, shrinking
souls from the glare of civilization.''
</P>
<P>
   A strenuous reductionism is at work in Auerbach-Levy. He was the
Giacometti of caricature, and one can feel the heavy lifting
involved in stripping the drawing down to its essentials.
</P>
<P>
   Al Frueh, whose theater caricatures were regularly showcased in
The New Yorker from its beginnings in 1925 until his death in 1968,
is another pioneer minimalist well represented in the gallery. His
economical lines are as playful as Auerbach-Levy's are grave. The
few marks that form his gestural 1911 caricature of a faceless,
cakewalking George M. Cohan strut and twirl as buoyantly as their
subject.
</P>
<P>
   Alfred Stieglitz exhibited Frueh's drawings in his 291 Gallery,
having become interested in caricature through the soft-focus
charcoal caricatures of Marius de Zayas, an artist closely linked
to the most avant currents of New York's avant-garde. De Zayas
befriended Picasso on a trip to Paris. They had a bicycle with
square wheels constructed and parked it near a bistro in order to
caricature the double takes of those who passed by.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   De Zayas's development as a caricaturist eventually led him to
one of the more peculiar but fascinating tributaries on display
here: totally abstract, virtually nonrepresentational, caricatures.
A composition of vigorous black strokes and futurist zigzags was
intended to suggest Teddy Roosevelt, but at least suggests to what
extremes the essentializing impulses of modernism and caricature
could travel together.
</P>
<P>
   Al Hirschfeld, The New York Times's theatrical caricaturist for
almost 50 years, is the last reigning giant of this cluster of
artists. His line drawings, with the clarity and authority of a
typeface, have become emblematic of elegant theatrical caricature,
and some are appropriately on view here as are some of his other,
less familiar gouache paintings.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Barton, a central player among the 20s cafe-society mugs
he caricatured, deployed a line as febrile and overheated as
Hirschfeld's is calculated and cool. Seeing his original drawings
is one of the special pleasures of this show, since his solidly
constructed cartoons seem a shade more conventionalized when
reproduced, even when they're printed as well as in the lush
catalogue.
</P>
<P>
   Also on view is work by Miguel Covarrubias, the Mexican muralist
and later an important anthropologist. He was once Hirschfeld's
roommate, friend and mentor.
</P>
<P>
   A virtuoso graphic artist, his definitive watercolor and
charcoal portrait of Paul Whiteman is a witty take on Cubism as
well as an effective likeness. Its abstracted shapes and colors
personify hot jazz as well as the famous band leader and, although
it's a tough call, it gets my vote as the picture I'd most like to
filch and take home.
</P>
<P>
   Covarrubias's playful formal mastery was put to good use in his
memorable series of ``Impossible Interviews'' for Vanity Fair.
These gouache paintings would couple two unlikely personalities in
one scene, usually from opposite ends of the cultural spectrum, and
probe the common denominators of their celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   One image from 1934, for example, has the burlesque queen Sally
Rand, painted nude, all frothy pink undulating curlicues, dancing
under a spotlight with a green-complexioned, angular Martha Graham
striking an anguished pose in a shrill red gown. (More than six
decades later our culture of celebrity has become so pervasive that
Covarrubias's unlikely combinations have become reality: at Time
magazine's recent centennial gala, notables like Sharon Stone
partied with Louis Farrakhan; Mikhail Gorbachev, Martha Stewart,
President Clinton and Tom Hanks all really did sit down to dine
together.)
</P>
<P>
   Two other artists who effectively used color as an emotive part
of their visual vocabulary were William Cotton (his sumptuous
pastel portrait of various members of the Algonquin set playing
poker manages to be both ridiculous and majestic in its evocation
of Giotto) and Peggy Bacon, whose caustic faces were rendered in a
style that still retained distant echoes of Daumier.
</P>
<P>
   These artists, indeed all the caricaturists touched on here,
have a visual sophistication that matches their subject matter
well. As many of the once-famous personalities depicted here fade
into obscurity, remembered only in fading photos and old movies,
the personalities of the respective artists becomes clearer, and
the formal elements of the pictures remain.
</P>
<P>
   The light epigrammatic quality of these images and the milieu
they defined make it an effort to remember the bleaker aspects of
the period. This, in fact, was part of their function. It may be
necessary to turn to some of the impassioned and indignant satire
of other fine art cartoonists like George Grosz or Ben Shahn for a
corrective.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, it's probably not useful to think of Hitler
or Sacco and Vanzetti as celebrities. In any case, one can't demand
that every court painter of note have Goya's social conscience, and
within their own domain the artists in the National Portrait
Gallery were consummate. They did for celebrities what Cezanne did
for apples.

 &HT;    Test Drive: Tweaking pays off for new Accord
 &HT;    By Russ DeVault
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Face it. Mainstream family sedans -- both domestics
and imports -- don't get much glory.
</P>
<P>
   They're like washing machines in the sense that they only get
attention when they're not working properly. But Honda set out to
change that with the '98 Accord, and it's paid off for the
Japanese-based manufacturer and buyers.
</P>
<P>
   Billed as the ``All-American'' because it's built in Marysville,
Ohio, with Japan supplying only 15 percent of its parts, this
Accord really is new. The badging is the same, but the 22-year-old
Accord's other characteristics are new or carefully improved. It's
no head-turner, but it is better looking, drives and rides
noticeably smoother, and has moved up to midsize status.
</P>
<P>
   To settle behind the wheel is to notice that the seats are a
touch larger and supportive in a non-sporty way, the instruments
are easier to read, controls have been moved up and about, and the
view is remarkably unimpeded.
</P>
<P>
   Take it to the road, and things get better. The 200-horsepower
V-6 engine, although not hushed, is keenly responsive, the
automatic four-speed generally glides through the gears, and the
Accord handles docilely and adroitly. It's no sports sedan, but it
will mimic one, if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   But here's what many of the 300,000-plus expected to buy Accords
this model year will seize on: The prices are virtually unchanged.
Critics can't miss this because Honda's elaborate press kit --
football-themed and with a hidden noisemaker that produces the roar
of a crowd when it's opened -- comes with a price list red-shirted
from '97.
</P>
<P>
   What that means is the test Accord LX sedan is base-priced at
$21,550, as it was last year. The bottom line is $22,024, with
floor mats adding $79 and destination charges totaling $395.
</P>
<P>
   It's that way all up and down the line, which includes DX and EX
sedans and a coupe whose exterior shares only headlights with the
sedan and is available in LX and EX trim. Prices range from about
$15,000 for the base sedan to about $24,000 for decked-out sedans
and coupes.
</P>
<P>
   Engine choices, in addition to the 200-horsepower V-6, are a
150-hp, 2.3-liter four-cylinder and a 135-hp four-banger. (A
four-cylinder that meets California's Low Vehicle Emission standard
is available nationally.)
</P>
<P>
   A five-speed manual is offered on four-cylinder Accords, while
the automatic four-speed is standard on V-6-powered Accords and
available for the four-cylinder cars.
</P>
<P>
   Move past the base cars, and the Accords have most of the
amenities covered, making options passe. Sure, some may whine about
the lack of ashtrays and lighter and rear-seat drink holders, but
there's little else to invoke protest, other than the engine and
road noise that penetrates the cabin and the automatic transmission
-- sometimes the shifts make it seem it's adapting to driving
style, and other times it seems to be a slacker.
</P>
<P>
   At the end

 &HT;    Beware of bad air-conditioning retrofits
 &HT;    By Nora Carter
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- With summer approaching and temperatures climbing
higher, more air-conditioning systems will require servicing. As
the price for R-12 -- or Freon, the most common but now banned
refrigerant -- continues to escalate, owners of older vehicles with
A/C systems that use this refrigerant will become the prime targets
for the retrofit hawkers.
</P>
<P>
   These are shops that will encourage you to switch your air
conditioning system over to a money-saving, alternative
refrigerant.
</P>
<P>
   Beware! While there are legitimate circumstances where a system
should be retrofitted, there are many instances where minor repairs
and a recharge will suffice. It's still legal to use R-12 in
systems that already are using it; it's the manufacture of more
R-12 that's outlawed because of the damage it does to the Earth's
upper-atmosphere ozone layer.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, steer clear of shops using refrigerants other than
R-12 or 134-A, the approved replacement for R-12. Although the
other ``accepted'' refrigerants may work well and their price is
attractive, it could prove to be a nightmare when needing future
service.
</P>
<P>
   Most reputable shops recommend retrofitting an A/C system only
when the situation warrants it, such as compressor failure or the
need to replace multiple components. Major repairs of this sort
require that the entire system be flushed out with a cleaning
chemical that removes all traces of debris, old refrigerant and
lubricating oils. This, in turn, provides the best possible
environment for the 134-A replacement, along with the new oil,
neither of which are compatible with R-12.
</P>
<P>
   The end result is a system that is environmentally friendly,
less expensive to maintain (the cost of the refrigerant in the
event of future repair) and, most importantly, uncontaminated by
residue from old R-12.
</P>
<P>
   There are claims and plenty of arguments throughout the industry
that ridding the system of the old chemical is unnecessary and that
it is acceptable simply to ``evacuate and recharge'' using the
replacement refrigerant and oil. However, the use of refrigerant
identifiers is uncovering a flaw.
</P>
<P>
   Greg, a mechanic friend of mine, told me about a customer whose
car needed some air-conditioning repairs, including a compressor
and 134-A retrofit. She declined the work at that time but returned
sometime later with a knocking compressor. While inspecting the
system, Greg noticed the old R-12 service fittings had been
replaced with new 134-A type, indicating the system had been
serviced elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   When he ``sniffed'' the system with his identifier, it confirmed
that the refrigerant had indeed been replaced with 134-A and also
contained contamination from a little of the old R-12. He could
neither recover nor dispose of the contaminated refrigerant, so he
closed the hood and sent her and her knocking compressor on their
way.
</P>
<P>
   I'd like to think that the shop that ``retrofitted'' her system
didn't knowingly contaminate it. The fact they were using the
industry-accepted 134-A instead of one of the other replacements
gives them some credence. I'm more inclined to believe that the
R-12 was residual. Unfortunately, it was a costly mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps she'll find a shop that won't identify the contaminated
refrigerant. In turn, that refrigerant will be recovered and
recycled and find its way into another system, maybe yours.

 &HT;    Journalists test Dodge Neons with a 'race within a race'

   Part of the Memorial Day program included two Dodge Neon
Challenge races. The Neon Challenge is a series of events where
Sports Car Club of America racers have the opportunity to compete
for prize money.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the program, Dodge invited three journalists to
compete in the event: Car &AMP; Driver's Steven Cole Smith, Popular
Science's Dan McCosh and me. For McCosh, it was his first outing.
Smith has spent some time on dirt tracks in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   And I've made a lap or two on tracks for some 20 years. I missed
all the practice sessions, so my weekend began with qualifying.
Smith qualified fastest of the three of us. I was second and McCosh
third.
</P>
<P>
   When the green flag dropped, I passed Smith going into the first
turn and led for 19 laps of the 20-lap event. On the final lap, I
moved over to let the guys by who were racing for the money. The
leader cleared with no problem, but the second-place car bumped me
in the turn. Smith went by while I was spinning in the weeds.
</P>
<P>
   The second race began from our finishing positions from the
first. Smith was ahead of me. He had also mastered the art of
blocking. This time it took five laps for me to get by.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the race, I was some six seconds ahead of Smith.
He claimed he ``let me by'' and was ``planning to make his move on
the last lap.'' Fact is, we were 27th and 28th in a 34-car field.
</P>
<P>
   Steve rationalized that our stock Dodge Neon ACR's, which had
only safety equipment as extras, were 100 pounds heavier than the
club race cars, had smaller tires and that the rear wing caused
more drag. He finally got Dodge to concede that there was at least
a two-second difference in the cars' performance.
</P>
<P>
   That says a lot for a stock Neon compared with one with about
$10,000 worth of preparation.
</P>
<P>
   The Lime Rock Dodge Neon Challenge will be broadcast July 5 at
12:30 p.m. and July 11 at 6 a.m. on ESPN2.

MANY CALIFORNIANS CROSSED PARTY LINES IN STATE'S FIRST OPEN
PRIMARY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIN McCORMICK and DIANA WALSH  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ It was a day to abandon the party line.
</P>
<P>
   In California's first open primary election, voters were allowed
to try on new political hats and choose primary contenders from any
party.
</P>
<P>
   There appeared to be plenty of side-switching in Tuesday's
election.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people voted all over the map,'' said Kim Alexander,
director of the nonprofit California Voter Foundation. ``A lot of
voters thought it was fun to cross party lines and vote on the
other side.''
</P>
<P>
   It appeared that people from all political parties flocked to
vote in the most exciting contest going _ the Democratic primary
race for governor among Lt. Governor Gray Davis, millionaire Al
Checchi and U.S. Rep. Jane Harman.
</P>
<P>
   While in other races only about 48 percent of the voters chose
Democrats, in that race 61 percent of the voters chose a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would indicate that a lot of Republicans voted
Democrat,'' said pollster David Binder. ``It might be because of
the race's visibility. The Democratic campaign attracted so much
attention that Republicans decided to cross over.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To have Republicans selecting the Democratic nomination and
vice versa is kind of weird,'' said Simon Brown of San Francisco,
who said he enjoyed voting in the open primary anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Some voters said they used the open primary to attempt sabotage
by casting a vote for the opposing party's weakest candidate.
</P>
<P>
   With Attorney General Dan Lungren facing only token opposition
for the Republican nomination for governor, former California
Republican Party Chairman John Herrington saw it as a chance to
throw a wrench into the workings of the Democratic machine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I voted for Gray Davis, because I believe Lungren can beat him
better than any other candidate,'' said Herrington, who added that
Jane Harman was the candidate his party feared most. ``I voted that
way and I urged my friends to do it too.''
</P>
<P>
   But Herrington and a number of political pundits said they
doubted that such sophisticated cross-voting was used by many
voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe that will happen in six or eight years when people get
the hang of the open primary,'' said Garry South, campaign manager
for Gray Davis, who won the Democratic nomination. ``But now there
are frankly not that many voters who are aware of the change.''
</P>
<P>
   Deciphering exactly how the open primary affected the vote may
take days or weeks. But clearly it added to both the confusion and
the excitement of Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   Voters were faced with one of the most imposing ballots in state
history, with a long list of candidates not separated by party. The
election was the first time that independent or non-partisan voters
could participate in a primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt good,'' said Ray Murray, a Noe Valley independent who
cast his vote for the first time in a primary Tuesday. ``I've
always had a concern about the primary and I've considered signing
on with a party just so I could vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Others found the system long-winded and perplexing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ballot's so vague. You can't tell who's who,'' said Bernal
Heights voter Teresa Taylor, who said she sat with her four grown
daughters for an hourlong ballot study session before even
venturing to the polls. ``Just getting ready to vote was
time-consuming.''
</P>
<P>
   The open primary, approved by voters in 1996, was designed to
increase turnout and give moderate candidates a better chance.
</P>
<P>
   Long before voters ever went to the polls, the system was making
profound changes in the way campaigning is done in California.
</P>
<P>
   With the new format, primary candidates could no longer focus
solely on members of their own political party. They had to cater
to independents and moderates in the other parties as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has increased campaign costs,'' said Herbert Alexander, an
emeritus political science professor at the University of
California at Los Angeles. ``One state senator told me it used to
cost him $100,000 to send mailers to the people on his mailing
list. Now it costs him $250,000 because he has to mail to
independents and members of the other party as well.''
</P>
<P>
   The open primary also meant that candidates who had no
challengers in their own party couldn't just sit out the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``The open primary forced Dan Lungren to spend $4 million in the
primary,'' said Bob Mulholland, campaign adviser to the Democratic
Party.
</P>
<P>
   Lungren complained that the open primary is one more thing
making it more expensive to run for office.
</P>
<P>
   ``For those who were selling the idea of these open or blanket
primaries as being better for the public, I think they ought to
take another look at that,'' he said. ``This ups the ante, this
causes the entry fee to run for political office, raises it
tremendously.''

AMID PROTESTS, CLINTON SEEKS TRADE STATUS RENEWAL FOR CHINA 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton triggered the annual battle over
U.S. trade relations with China on Wednesday but this year's fight
quickly became ensnared with questions of Chinese government
political contributions and U.S. technology transfers to Beijing,
in addition to the usual criticism of China's human rights
policies.
</P>
<P>
   In defending his decision to grant China ``most favored nation''
trading status, Clinton described China as the linchpin of U.S.
strategic interests in Asia that are now under challenge by the
nuclear testing of India and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   The president promised to ``deal forthrightly'' with China on
what had been the main area of contention between Washington and
Beijing: human rights. But he made clear that human rights would
take a back seat to strategic concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not to renew (China's trading status) would be to sever our
economic and .... strategic relationship with China, turning our
back on a fourth of the world at a time when cooperation for world
peace and security is especially important,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Congress now has 90 days to disapprove Clinton's decision to
renew ``most favored nation'' trading status for China. Because the
president could veto such a resolution of disapproval, a two-thirds
vote of the House and Senate would be needed to override such a
veto and cancel the administration's decision.
</P>
<P>
   Absent that, U.S.-Chinese trade relations would continue
uninterrupted for another year.
</P>
<P>
   Reaffirmation of China's most favored nation trading status puts
China at the same level as virtually all U.S. trading partners in
terms of import tariffs, normally in the four to six percent range.
</P>
<P>
   The president stressed the role that China plays in the U.S.
economy. U.S. exports to China have more than tripled in the past
decade to $12.8 billion and an estimated 170,000 U.S. jobs depend
on these exports, Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship is no one-way street; China exports $62 billion
annually to the United States, according to the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce, thus creating a huge trade imbalance in favor of China.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's bid for renewal of China's trading status drew
skepticism from some members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a tough vote,'' said House Majority Dick
Armey, R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans in both the House and Senate are launching
investigations of a complicated web of allegations involving New
York-based Loral Space &AMP; Communications Ltd. and its chairman,
Bernard Schwartz, who has contributed $1.3 million to Democrats in
the six years since Clinton's election.
</P>
<P>
   Last February, Clinton granted a waiver to Loral to launch a
satellite atop a Chinese rocket even though the Justice Department
was investigating whether Loral in 1996 gave China missile
technology with military applications.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, the Justice Department is probing allegations by
former Democratic fundraiser Johnny Chung that he funneled
large-dollar contributions to Democrats from Chinese aerospace
executive Liu Chaoying, daughter of a retired prominent Chinese
Army commander.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a shame that President Clinton has endangered a strong,
bipartisan trade policy by his slow reaction to serious national
security questions raised by the questionable transfer of sensitive
technology to China,'' said Rep. John Boehner, R-Ohio. ``To ensure
that we can continue our free trade approach, the president must
come clean right away and offer complete, forthright answers to
these serious questions.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House has defended the Loral waiver, saying it came
only after assurances by the Pentagon and State Department that no
sensitive technology would be compromised.
</P>
<P>
   In previous years, an alliance of liberal Democrats and
conservative Republicans on Capitol Hill has cited Chinese human
rights violations in their unsuccessful efforts to derail the
annual renewal of China's trading status. The renewal process has
become a yearly ritual in which all aspects of America's often
testy relationship with China bubble to the surface for
re-examination.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, some Democrats on Capitol Hill again cited human
rights as a reason to oppose Clinton's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must not reward the Chinese Communist government for its
continuing political repression and tyranny,'' said House Minority
Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said she was ``disappointed once
again'' with Clinton's decision. Pelosi accused China of providing
nuclear technology to Pakistan, running a $63 billion trade surplus
against the United States and continuing to hold political and
religious dissidents in jail.
</P>
<P>
   Since November, China has released two prominent dissidents,
Wang Dan and Wei Jingsheng. But according to Amnesty International,
at least 250 others involved in the 1989 democracy protests in
Tiananmen Square in Beijing are still in jail.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday marks the ninth anniversary of the Chinese government's
crackdown on the Tiananmen Square protesters.

</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, representatives of human rights organizations
downplayed the significance of the trade issue as a wedge against
China on human rights.
</P>
<P>
   Renewal of China's trade status ``doesn't serve as an effective
instrument on human rights'' because Clinton declared in 1994 that
U.S. trade policy toward China would not be affected by human
rights issues, said Xiao Quiang, executive director of the New
York-based organization, Human Rights in China.
</P>
<P>
   ``The release of the dissidents is a significant achievement and
the administration deserves credit,'' he said. ``But that's not
enough. We need a consistent policy (in which the administration)
exerts pressure on the Chinese government.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Jendrzejczyk, Washington director of the Asia division of
Human Rights Watch, said his organization is focusing on Clinton's
summit meeting in Beijing later this month and using China's desire
to join the World Trade Organization as a wedge to improve human
rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``MFN (most favored nation trading status) has become much more
routine,'' he said. ``Joining the World Trade Organization is a
much bigger carrot to the Chinese.'' Admission to the World Trade
Organization would help China open markets and lower trading
barriers around the world, he added.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Chamber of Commerce praised renewal of China's trading
status. ``There's been tremendous progress in China on human
rights, and that's because of the U.S. policy of engagement,'' said
Myron Brilliant, manager of the chamber's Asia division. Cutting
off Chinese trade would be ``shooting U.S business in the foot,''
he added.

AMERICAN ARTIST LEAVES GERMAN HOLOCAUST PROJECT

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ The American sculptor Richard Serra has
abruptly pulled out of a project to design a massive and
much-debated Holocaust memorial in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   Serra, who had teamed up with the American architect Peter
Eisenmann to submit a design that was strongly favored by Germany's
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, said he had quit for ``personal and
professional reasons'' that ``had nothing to do with the merits of
the project.''
</P>
<P>
   The surprising announcement by Serra, whose giant abstract works
have both enraptured and infuriated people for the last several
decades, was yet another twist in the tortuous efforts by German
leaders to build a memorial to Jewish victims on land at the heart
of Hitler's Third Reich, almost on top of the line where the Berlin
Wall once stood.
</P>
<P>
   Though Kohl and other German leaders had hoped to build a
memorial to the Holocaust in Berlin by the time the city resumes
its role next year as the capital of the reunited Germany, the
project has been bedeviled by philosophical and political battles
at every turn.
</P>
<P>
   Though German leaders have not officially decided on a design,
the proposal by Serra and Eisenmann, one of four competing designs,
has been the clear favorite of Kohl and of the nonprofit
organization that has led the decade-long effort to build a
memorial.
</P>
<P>
   As envisioned by the two Americans, the memorial would feature a
forbidding labyrinth of 4,000 huge pillars that would sprawl over
an area of 180,000 square feet. It would be located between
Berlin's Brandenburg Gate and Potsdamer Platz, the huge new
commercial and office complex being built on what used to be the
no-man's-land between East and West Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   Much like the years of debate in the United States over building
the memorial to Vietnam veterans in Washington, the proposed Berlin
memorial has engendered endless argument and infighting over both
details and fundamental philosophical issues.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, German leaders almost selected an entirely separate
design for the memorial that consisted of a huge tilting slab of
concrete that was to have been covered with the names of 4.2
million known victims of the Holocaust. Kohl vetoed that design in
1996 and a new competition led to the selection of the four
competing designs, including that of Serra and Eisenmann.
</P>
<P>
   But the arguments did not end. Many critics argued that the
design should include names of victims, as well as the numbers of
people killed and the places where the killings occurred. Several
months ago, a group of leading German intellectuals, including
Germany's best-known writer, Guenter Grass, argued that the
monument should be abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   The opponents of a memorial argued that no artistic monument
could faithfully represent the full horror of the Holocaust, and
that the new monument would be an ``abstract installation of
oppressively gigantic proportions'' that would be ``neither a
witness to the past nor a sign to the future.'' The letter said the
memorial should include other groups persecuted by the Nazis, such
as Gypsies, homosexuals, Soviet prisoners of war and the disabled.
Others are proposing that instead of building a monument, Berlin
should rename Potsdamer Platz ``Juden Platz'' or ``Jews' Place.''
</P>
<P>
   It remained unclear on Wednesday whether Serra's unexpected
withdrawal would lead to further delays in the memorial. In a
statement issued by Serra's dealer, the Gagosian Gallery in SoHo,
the sculptor said he continued to support the design. Eisenmann
said he would proceed on his own and that the design was nearly
complete.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``As far as we're concerned, the project is more than either
Richard Serra or Peter Eisenmann,'' the architect said. ``In 50
years, nobody will remember who the artist and the architect
were,'' Eisenmann added, dismissing the matter as ``a tempest in a
teapot.''
</P>
<P>
   Lea Rosh, head of the nonprofit organization that has lobbied
for a Holocaust museum since 1988, said Serra's decision would not
cause a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is important is that Eisenmann stands by his proposal and
that his design is finally put on display,'' Ms. Rosh said on
Wednesday
</P>
<P>
   A decision on the memorial has already been delayed for several
months, and proponents are now hoping to reach a final agreement by
the end of June. But Kohl is still insisting on numerous changes,
though Eisenmann has indicated he can accommodate the requests.
</P>
<P>
   Berlin's mayor, Eberhard Diepgen, remains opposed to all of the
final four designs and is supposed to have a say in the ultimate
decision. Diepgen, who has been lukewarm about the project all
along, recently questioned whether any monument could ``deal with
this horror artistically.''

   MILMED _ WASHINGTON _ The Senate is waiting to take up a
House-passed bill that would open the Federal Employees Health
Benefit Plan to a relatively small vanguard of retired military
people. The bill, opposed by the Defense Department, would create a
``demonstration project'' with up to 70,000 retirees who are
elegible for Medicare, either because they are over 65 or because
they are disabled. Some Defense Department officials have warned
that opening the flood gates of military health care beneficiaries
to FEHBP, the plan that provides health insurance to civilian
employees and retirees, would ultimately destroy the military
health care system. (Nesmith, Cox News Service).

of the measure's defeat. Similar amendments on reform bills now are

   TOKYO _ The Great Japan Money Rush is on.
</P>
<P>
   With $9 trillion in private savings up for grabs, international
banks and money managers are hurtling into Tokyo to stake their
claims. Japan's ``big bang'' market liberalization, which began in
April, is breaking down the barriers and luring the likes of
Travelers Group , which this week bought a 25 percent share of
Nikko Securities, the country's third-largest brokerage.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. and General Electric Capital have already
picked up ailing Japanese institutions or their branches and are
now trying to rescue them with Western-style management and
marketing techniques. And still other American companies will be
making a giant push over the next few months, in part because by
December foreign institutions will be allowed for the first time to
sell mutual funds in partnership with Japanese banks.
</P>
<P>
   In their struggle to win a larger share of the market in the
world's second-biggest economy, the Americans are redrawing the
rules of the financial playing field here and sending shock waves
down the halls of their Japanese competitors. And though foreigners
have stumbled in the dark for years in Japan, this time the prize
is too big to ignore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's any other opportunity in the world
three, five, 10 years from now that's a larger opportunity than
Japan in the asset management business,'' said John R. Alkire, a
managing director who heads Morgan Stanley Asset Management in
Japan, a unit of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. ``If you want to stake
out your house in this gold rush, you want to make sure you get
your pegs out there as far as you can.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not just the Americans who are rushing in; the Swiss Bank
Corp., for example, has formed an asset management venture with
Japan's Long-Term Credit Bank. But while other Western institutions
are also prospecting here, it is the Americans who have put down
the most claims.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is a chunk of the savings of people like Megumi Narita,
a young training consultant who keeps her money in a neighborhood
bank _ earning less than 1 percent interest. The Japanese are
enormously conservative investors, leaving the bulk of their
savings in banks and the postal savings system, but young people
like Miss Narita are increasingly fed up with the dismal interest
rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I often see middle-aged men on the train reading the stock
market tables in the newspaper, and I want to buy, too,'' Miss
Narita said the other day, discussing investments with friends.
``But as a young woman, I've always been a bit embarrassed to do
so. And I never can figure out what the tables say anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   The challenge for the Americans will be to persuade Miss Narita,
and millions more like her, to take the first step and actually
make new investments. Indeed, the money management and insurance
landscape has proved to be a minefield for starry-eyed foreign
companies in the past. For years, foreign companies banged on doors
here, trying to break into this intensely clubby, closed and
secretive market.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch opened three branches in the late 1980s and 1990,
only to close them in 1993. Fidelity Investments, the giant mutual
fund arm of the Boston-based FMR Corp., has had an office here
since 1969, but its sleepy business did not get very far, until
recently. Likewise, after winning its first pension management
account in April 1990, Mercury Asset Management Japan Ltd., a unit
of Merrill Lynch, had to wait two years before it got a second.
</P>
<P>
   What is different now is that Japan's big bang is liberalizing
the arcane rules that have fettered the financial industry. Under
international pressure to revive its sinking economy and its rigid
markets, Japan seems willing to let foreign companies acquire its
institutions, or pieces of them, to gain a place on an inside
track.
</P>
<P>
   In short, the Americans are now knocking on doors that the
Japanese government appears eager to open.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the last 50 years, we have been relatively isolated,
insulated from the rest of the world in terms of information
technology and finance,'' said Eisuke Sakakibara, vice finance
minister for international affairs. ``That has to change.''
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, American companies are betting, as they roll
out their new marketing strategies, that profits will pile up.
After all, many of them remember just how well they did after
London's big bang in 1986 and New York's May Day liberalization in
1975. Those efforts led to a broad restructuring of the financial
markets in Britain and America, and now Americans and Japanese
alike are hoping that the liberalization will do the same for
Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Japanese companies are also petrified by what they call the
Wimbledon phenomenon: since Britain opened up its national tennis
tournament to foreigners, few Britons have won the title.
Similarly, while Britain's big bang made London a major
international financial center, British companies wound up playing
only a minor role.
</P>
<P>
   It is far too soon to say that the same thing will happen here,
but one trend seems clear: American companies are competing with
Japanese institutions on their home turf and, in the process,
changing the way the market works.
</P>
<P>
   ``Foreigners have been a catalyst for change in Japan,'' said
Clifford J. Shaw, president of Mercury Asset Management Japan.
``Whatever way it happens, we are going to get from here to there.
We are going to get a more efficient financial system.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Japanese and American companies have been tying the
knot in droves through alliances, partnerships and cooperative
ventures in asset management and insurance. Bankers Trust New York
Corp. is forming a business arrangement with Nippon Credit Bank,
for instance, while American International Group is interested in
acquiring Aoba Life Insurance. And in discussing his company's deal
with Nikko, Sanford I. Weill, chairman and chief executive of
Travelers, said that a similar arrangement with a Japanese
insurance company might be next.
</P>
<P>
   Other American companies are increasing their marketing efforts,
and the response has been promising. When Fidelity ran color
advertisements in Japanese newspapers last December, telephone
inquiries came tumbling in, even though the first ads did not
include a phone number. When Fidelity did display its number this
spring in two more ads, there was a flood of several thousand
calls.
</P>
<P>
   For several companies, business is already rolling in, along
with nice fees. Goldman, Sachs Investment Trust Management Japan
Ltd., a unit of Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co., began selling investment
trusts just over two years ago, and now it has $6 billion under
management. Similarly, within four months from opening its first
trust in December last year, Merrill Lynch brought in $2.5 billion
and had to slow sales. Alliance Capital Investment Trust Management
Inc. has gathered $5 billion in 17 months.
</P>
<P>
   The competition, of course, is going to become extremely fierce,
the profit opportunities are likely to shrink and not everyone,
including the operations run by foreigners, may survive. For now,
though, there should be enough business to go around, especially
because there are so few formidable players.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   And while the rules have already been relaxed in pension
management, regulations will soon allow companies to offer new and
varied kinds of trusts that are similar to American-style mutual
funds.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese investors are wary of their own stock market, which has
been depressed since the early 1990s, so they have shied from
Japanese investment trusts, which tend to put money in domestic
stocks and bonds. But many Japanese are now flocking to foreign-run
trusts that invest in overseas stocks and bonds because they
believe _ sometimes mistakenly _ that the foreign managers have
more expertise and better results. Indeed, in April, foreign
companies for the first time sold more investment trusts here than
the Japanese did.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear that Japanese customers fully understand what
they are getting into, for foreign investments often carry a
currency risk, namely that a rising yen will wipe out profits
earned abroad. It could take just one bad wave _ a turn in exchange
or interest rates _ and the Japanese might go running back to their
friendly local brokers, who have visited them in their homes for
years and worked hard at forging strong relationships.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Nomura Securities was caught in a financial scandal
and some of its businesses were suspended for up to five months.
Commercial customers fled to other underwriters, including Merrill.
But now Nomura has recovered and nearly all of that newly won
business has disappeared, Merrill says.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't underestimate the value of relationships that
Japanese banks have had for many, many years,'' said John P.
Sievwright, the new president of Merrill Lynch Japan Ltd. ``They
don't fall apart overnight, and they certainly won't fall apart
because of big bang.''
</P>
<P>
   But those relationships are at least fraying, and the American
companies are jockeying for position to catch the stray cash.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill is taking over 33 branches and 2,000 employees from
Yamaichi Securities, a fraction of the operations of Japan's
fourth-largest brokerage firm, which filed for bankruptcy last
fall. Merrill estimated that it would incur net costs of $125
million for leases, furniture, salaries, technology and market
development this year. This summer, Merrill will operate the
largest non-Japanese brokerage-firm network in the country, though
it says its branches will look pretty much the same as when
Yamaichi was running them.
</P>
<P>
   There will be important differences, though, aside from new
products and the absence of uniforms that female employees had to
wear when Yamaichi was in charge. Merrill's employees will be
trained as financial planners to offer advice to customers, rather
than merely act as brokers. Still, when it opens its doors this
summer, Merrill is counting mainly on the old Yamaichi customers to
provide business.
</P>
<P>
   As for Fidelity, it is taking a different approach, one much
like its direct strategy at home: reliance on the telephone. In
addition to a small phone center it has already set up, Fidelity
may use land it recently purchased on the outskirts of Tokyo to
build a larger telemarketing operation. So far, it has gathered
nearly $3 billion to manage, up nearly 40 percent from the end of
1997.
</P>
<P>
   GE Capital spent $575 million to take over 500 sales offices and
the new business of the Toho Mutual Life Insurance Co. _ without
the debt and other demons from the Japanese company's past _ and
has already hung its signs on the doors. Analysts hailed the deal
as a smart way to gain entry.
</P>
<P>
   But General Electric is wary of overconfidence, and it says that
to win business it will simply have to do a better job than its
Japanese counterparts. It brings with it a few ideas to lower
costs, like centralizing the back office processing activities and
standardizing credit decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't come here and find we can walk all over them, by any
means,'' said K. Ronnie Baldwin, president of GE Capital Japan.
``The fact is that Japanese companies have an enormous capability
to improve and change. When challenged, they have been historically
able to rise to the occasion.''

CLINTON TAKES STEP TO RENEW CHINA'S TRADE STATUS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton moved Wednesday to renew most
favored nation trade status with China, saying the United States
must continue to engage the Asian giant.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton cited China's cooperative role in trying to contain the
escalating nuclear arms race between India and Pakistan and its
economic importance to the United States in making the annual
renewal.
</P>
<P>
   His decision immediately was condemned by members of Congress
who have 90 days to try to pass legislation blocking the MFN trade
status. Clinton may face a battle with lawmakers from both parties
in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not to renew would be to sever our economic and, to a large
measure, our strategic relationship with China, turning our back on
a fourth of the world at a time when our cooperation for world
peace and security is especially important in light of the recent
events in South Asia,'' Clinton said in a Rose Garden event.
</P>
<P>
   But House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., said, ``I
oppose the president's actions. We must not reward the Chinese
Communist government for its continuing political repression and
tyranny.''
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, said, ``It is going
to be, I believe, a tough vote, and I believe it will be in fact
now a tougher vote than it was a year ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton met early Wednesday with Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright, who left for Geneva, where the United States has convened
the foreign ministers of the five permanent United Nations Security
Council members. China will chair the session intended to craft a
united response to the India-Pakistan crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an important example of how our engagement with China
serves America's interest: stability in Asia, preventing the spread
of weapons of mass destruction, combatting international crime and
drug-trafficking, protecting the environment,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the same time, we continue to deal forthrightly with China
on those issues where we disagree, notably on human rights; and
there clearly have been some concrete results as a result of this
engagement as well,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Albright, appearing with Clinton in the Rose Garden, said, ``It
is very clear that the better the relations are between the United
States and China and the United States and Russia, the better we
can protect and serve the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright also sounded dire warnings on the state of play between
India and Pakistan, rivals who conducted underground nuclear tests
and threatened to deploy nuclear weapons aimed at each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing both sides can do is to cool it and
take a deep breath and to begin to climb out of the hole they have
dug themselves into,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The five permanent Security Council members _ the United States,
Russia, China, France and Britain _ also are the only five nations
with declared nuclear capability, and Albright said they intend to
keep the number limited to five.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (nonproliferation treaty) will not be amended to
accommodate either country,'' she declared of India and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   Albright pledged to do her best to craft an international
response to the crisis. However, she added, ``But do not make a
mistake: the risks of the moment are high and, for the moment, the
key choices will be made in New Delhi and Islamabad.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials have praised China for its
behind-the-scenes effort to contain the arms race. India's five
underground tests also were intended to rattle China, its neighbor
who has been allied with Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   China first received MFN status in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton noted, despite the name, the status does not provide
special privileges but extends the same tariff treatment provided
to almost all other nations.
</P>
<P>
   China's trade status has sparked an annual battle since 1989
when the communist government massacred pro-democracy student
demonstrators in Tiananmen Square and cracked down on a growing
dissident movement.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt, the House's top Democrat, said he and other opponents
again would move to block the trade status. Last year, they drew
only 173 of the 218 votes needed to overturn Clinton's decision.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt said, ``Human rights is a principle that can not be
allowed to fall prey to politics. America must stand for more than
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., however, said he expected the Senate
to endorse the trade renewal because ``on balance, it is in the
best interest of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Three Republican House members _ Speaker Newt Gingrich of
Georgia, Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer of Texas and
Phil Crane of lllinois, wrote Clinton a letter saying: ``We welcome
the determination you made today to recommend the renewal of MFN
trade status for China, and we pledge to work with you in a
bipartisan manner to preserve our long-standing policy of
commercial and diplomatic engagement with the Chinese.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, however, there are additional controversies
enveloping China, and the three Republicans pledged in their letter
that the House would continue its investigation of those issues.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic donor Johnny Chung recently alleged a portion of the
money he gave to the Democratic Party came from a Chinese
corporation owned by the military there. His accusations continued
to spur an investigation into whether the Chinese government
attempted to influence the 1996 U.S. elections.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also came under fire for granting a waiver allowing a
satellite company owned by a major Democratic contributor to send
its satellite into orbit aboard a Chinese-launched rocket. The
company was under investigation by the Justice Department for
passing along sensitive rocket technology to China following a
previous rocket explosion that destroyed one of its satellites.
</P>
<P>
   The House, where critics charged that Clinton endangered
American security, voted overwhelming to ban U.S. companies from
launching satellites aboard Chinese rockets.
</P>
<P>
   The escalating Chinese controversy comes just weeks before
Clinton plans an official state visit to the country. Republicans
have called on him to cancel the trip until they investigate the
campaign finance allegations, and other critics have assailed him
for planning to attend an official greeting at Tiananmen Square. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate next week is expected to take up a bill
seen by supporters as an initial step toward allowing retired
members of the military to enroll in the federal government's
civilian health care plan.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would establish a ``demonstration program'' under which
some retired military personnel who are eligible for Medicare would
be permitted to enroll in the Federal Employee Health Benefits Plan
(FEHBP), with the Defense Department paying 72 percent of their
premiums.
</P>
<P>
   The House of Representatives last week passed a similar plan
with only one dissenting vote.
</P>
<P>
   Allowing all retired members of the armed services to opt out of
the military's TRICARE health benefits plan in favor of FEHBP would
be a move that the Pentagon warns could have ``drastic
consequences'' for the military medical care system.
</P>
<P>
   But veterans groups and other organizations that have been
lobbying in recent years to allow retirees to leave TRICARE hail
the bills as a move toward opening FEHBP to their members.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first step (toward) providing America's military
retirees guaranteed access to quality health care, as they were
promised many years ago,'' said John Moon, commander-in-chief of
the Veterans of Foreign Wars.
</P>
<P>
   Both the House measure and the Senate bill, introduced by Sen.
Max Cleland, D-Ga., would be limited to retired military personnel
who are covered by Medicare, either because of disabilities or
because they have reached age 65.
</P>
<P>
   The Defense Department has long opposed shifting any retirees to
FEHBP _ even though its TRICARE program provides no health care
benefits to retirees who are eligible for Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have strong concerns about proposals allowing military
retirees to enroll in the FEHBP, particularly under-65 retirees who
already have TRICARE,'' Defense Secretary William Cohen said in an
April 30 letter to House National Security Committee Chairman Floyd
Spence, R-S.C.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen noted that the Congressional Budget Office has estimated
that requiring the Defense Department to pay FEHBP premiums for
over-65 retirees would cost the government $1.4 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Expanding FEHBP enrollment to retirees under age 65 would
increase these costs drastically,'' Cohen wrote. ``Requiring the
department to bear these additional costs would have drastic
consequences for the military health system.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those who are the most unhappy with TRICARE are military
retirees who are covered by Medicare, because as soon as they
become eligible for that plan, they are dropped from TRICARE by the
Defense Department.
</P>
<P>
   The House bill would require the Pentagon to use funds it
receives from selling surplus stockpiles of chromium, industrial
diamonds, paladium and platinum to pay FEHBP premiums for up to
70,000 Medicare-eligible retirees, a cost estimated at up to $100
million a year, depending on how many chose to enroll in the plan.
</P>
<P>
   The retirees could then use the FEHBP coverage to supplement
their Medicare benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Cleland's bill would provide for a smaller demonstration group
but would also require the Pentagon to extend TRICARE to
Medicare-eligible retirees and to set up a test program to provide
mail-order prescription drugs to retirees who do not live near
military hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   The measure was approved in April by the Senate Armed Services
Committee as an amendment to the Defense Authorization Bill for the
next fiscal year. The authorization bill is expected to be voted on
as early as Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the Defense Department Office of Health
Affairs have warned that requiring the department to fund FEHBP
participation for some retirees will force it to reduce benefits it
currently provides in military hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   That could motivate others to opt out of TRICARE and into FEHBP,
creating a ``slippery slope'' that could wreck the military health
care system, Gary Christopherson, acting assistant secretary of
defense for health affairs told a House subcommittee in April.
</P>
<P>
   But Retired Army Col. Chuck Partridge, legislative affairs
director of the National Association for the Uniformed Services,
disagrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have this slash-and-burn policy of cutting back on
military health care,'' Partridge said. ``If these retirees could
get into military hospitals, they wouldn't even want FEHBP.''

GOLF'S RULE MAKERS CONSIDER CRACKDOWN ON EQUIPMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (ja)

Golf World magazine.

<TEXT>
<P>
   It was, perhaps, inevitable that the friction between tradition
and technology in golf would spark a controversy and set it ablaze.
The question confronting the industry now is how to control it
before it does irreparable harm to the game.
</P>
<P>
   On the side of tradition is the U.S. Golf Association, which has
been preparing to address its concern that technological advances
in equipment enable players to hit the ball with greater distance
and accuracy, in the process imperiling the integrity of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our franchise is to preserve and protect the game's ancient
and honorable traditions,'' said F. Morgan ``Buzz'' Taylor Jr., the
USGA president, and its point man on the technology issue. ``I
intend to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   When he was installed as the USGA president in January, Taylor
suggested in his inaugural address that an influx of better
athletes armed with high-tech equipment ``combine to threaten
obsolescence of many of golf's historic venues.''
</P>
<P>
   On the side of technology are equipment manufacturers, who are
aggressively defending the status quo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's inconceivable anybody would want to make the game
tougher,'' said Ely Callaway, founder and chairman of Callaway
Golf, the world leader in the sales of golf clubs.
</P>
<P>
   The approaching millenium has given the USGA pause to consider
further legislation on several fronts, among them whether to roll
back advances on the golf ball, limit the lengths of drivers and
putters, limit the minimum and maximum lofts of clubs, and whether
a 14-club limit is too many.
</P>
<P>
   But the most highly charged issue the USGA is confronting
involves woods, specifically whether thin-faced titanium woods
produce what commonly is called a trampoline effect. Such an effect
is in violation of 4-1e in the Rules of Golf, which states that the
clubface cannot ``have the effect at impact of a spring.''
</P>
<P>
   A trampoline effect occurs when the face of a clubhead deforms
at impact with a ball, then rebounds to its original position, in
theory propelling the ball farther than it would have gone had the
clubface been rigid. The expanded surface of a titanium clubface is
said to contain more elasticity than a smaller face, in much the
same way that the membrane of a larger drum would have more give
than it would on a smaller drum.
</P>
<P>
   The USGA has concluded from its tests that a trampoline effect
indeed exists in titanium drivers, according to Richard
Helmstetter, chief of new products for Callaway Golf. The USGA has
not publicly revealed the results of its tests, but it has informed
Helmstetter of its testing methods and what they demonstrate.
</P>
<P>
   According to Helmstetter, the USGA took an air cannon and fired
a golf ball at the center of a titanium plate at 160 feet per
second and measured the rebound speed of the ball. It used all
different thicknesses of plates, he said. ``They're charging that
some of the plates, the thinner ones, have a rebound speed that was
faster than it was on the thicker ones,'' Helmstetter said.
</P>
<P>
   The manufacturers are concerned that the USGA is preparing to
declare that some of their clubs do not conform to the Rules of
Golf and at some point in the future will be declared illegal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not beyond logic to conclude that they'll take some
action with the drivers they're concerned about, maybe saying that
they're OK now, but as of a certain date they'll be
nonconforming,'' said Wally Uihlein, president of Titleist and
FootJoy Worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   The USGA's alternative is to grandfather in all existing
equipment, but to establish a standard that in the future will
limit the distance a club can hit a ball in testing procedures
established by the USGA. Such a standard would effectively curtail
technology advancing unabated as it has in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   David Fay, executive director of the USGA, recently said he
believes ``there will be some announcement beyond `we're looking at
it''' at the U.S. Open, scheduled for the week of June 15 at the
Olympic Club in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are substantial and conceivably include the USGA's
ability to retain its role as the governing body of the game in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Callaway Golf has sold conservatively upward of 5 million
drivers in its Big Bertha line. A USGA declaration that existing
woods do not conform to the Rules of Golf would mean that those
golfers who continue to use them would in essence be using illegal
clubs.
</P>
<P>
   In the event they ignored the USGA's edict and continued to use
these woods in violation of the rules, the USGA's relevance as the
governing body of golf in the United States might be dramatically
diminished.
</P>
<P>
   The manufacturers' argument is that the millions of titanium
drivers in play around the world, purchased at costs upward of
$300, had already been judged by the USGA to conform to the rules.
By reversing its position regarding the conformity of the woods,
the USGA almost certainly would invite lawsuits from manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   The USGA is almost certain to rewrite its Overall Distance
Standard for golf balls, tightening tolerances that have existed
since 1976. The Overall Distance Standard currently states that a
ball ``shall not cover an average distance in carry and roll
exceeding 280 yards plus a tolerance of 6 percent (an additional
16.8 yards).''
</P>
<P>
   Said Fay, ``A promise we made when we introduced the Overall
Distance Standard in 1976 remains unfulfilled, that once we got
better testing procedures, we'd tighten up the tolerances.''
</P>
<P>
   The net result of proposed legislation would be diminished fun,
Callaway said, adding that by nullifying technological advances
that have made the game more enjoyable for millions might
ultimately drive them from the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, cooler heads will prevail,'' Callaway said.

BOEING TO HALT MD-11 OUTPUT, LAY OFF SOME WORKERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Utah, Ark., Toronto)   (bl)  
 By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Boeing Co. announced Wednesday that it would stop producing the
MD-11 wide-body jet late next year and lay off some workers because
of slumping demand for the aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing, based in Seattle, said the move would not result in a
special charge against earnings, as many analysts had feared. But
it will reduce second-quarter earnings, though the company declined
to specify by how much.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing inherited the MD-11 last year when it bought McDonnell
Douglas Corp. for $16.3 billion. In November, Boeing announced that
it was phasing out the MD-80 and MD-90, two narrow-body jets
produced by what is now called Boeing's Douglas Products division.
</P>
<P>
   Executives had hoped that they could continue to sell the
three-engine MD-11, which has a passenger capacity ranging from 233
to 410, primarily as a freighter. But the financial crisis in Asia
has forced many airlines there to shed older wide-body planes,
which are expensive to operate, creating a large number of
passenger jets that can be converted into cargo planes at a
fraction of the cost of a new MD-11.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite our best marketing efforts,'' said Ronald B. Woodard,
president of Boeing's commercial aircraft division, ``it became
clear to us that there simply was not enough customer interest in
either the passenger or freighter versions of this airplane to
justify keeping the production line open.''
</P>
<P>
   Boeing said it had commitments for 22 more MD-11s and planned to
deliver the last plane in February 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement leaves only the 717, a 100-seat, twin-engine
jet formerly called the MD-95, as the remaining Douglas model in
the Boeing stable.
</P>
<P>
   About 3,000 workers at the former Douglas plant in Long Beach,
Calif., now build the MD-11. An additional 600 workers build the
plane's wings in Toronto along with 75 workers each in Salt Lake
City, Utah, and Melbourne, Ark.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Boeing announced it would eliminate 6,200
jobs in Long Beach, most of that the result of phasing out
production of the MD-80 and MD-90. But the company has more
recently transferred some work on a new version of the 737, a
narrow-body passenger jet, to Long Beach and is considering opening
a line to assemble the 737 there.
</P>
<P>
   Woodard said Boeing would do its best to find new jobs for the
workers, adding, ``But ultimately we will have to lay off employees
for whom we do not have work.''
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian Press quoted Boeing Canada president George Capern
as saying that the Toronto wing plant, which employs about 2,000,
would be phased out unless additional work was found.
</P>
<P>
   But Sean O'Donnell, a Boeing spokesman, said: ``We are looking
to place additional temporary work in Toronto.''

KUDOS FOR NEWT, PRAISE FOR HOPE, FOOT-TAPPING FOR STARR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Random comments on people in the news:
</P>
<P>
   NEWT GINGRICH: The speaker of the House is taking all kinds of
heat because he committed the unthinkable faux pas of speaking out
on behalf of Israel. Seems that the speaker sided with Israel on an
issue or two that are points of contention in the ongoing sham
known as the Middle Eastern peace process and suddenly found
himself under attack by the Palestinians and their apologists.
</P>
<P>
   Israel, the best and most reliable friend the United States has
in today's dangerous world, is perfectly willing to negotiate a
peace agreement _ but not at the expense of its national security.
The Clinton administration, which ought to be siding with America's
loyal and trusted ally, is instead cozying up to the Palestinians
and their terrorist-loving leader, Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   Good for Newt for reminding the Israelis that they still have
friends in high places.
</P>
<P>
   JOHN KASICH: John ``who?'' OK, John Kasich may not be a
household name just yet, but the chairman of the House Budget
Committee is gearing up for a compelling arrival on the national
political scene. The 46-year-old congressman from Ohio is
reportedly laying the groundwork for a run at the Republican
presidential nomination in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush, of course, is the runaway favorite to
head the GOP ticket _ and if he runs, he'll win.
</P>
<P>
   If Bush doesn't run, however, the race will be wide open, and
rank-and-file Republicans might just be in the market for a new
face to lead their party into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   Kasich has a solid record of achievement _ he's as responsible
as any politician in Washington for steering the nation toward a
balanced budget _ and he has energy and charisma to spare. If
nothing else, Kasich would be an excellent running mate for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   PRESIDENT CLINTON: Is the president feeling distracted and
defeated by independent counsel Ken Starr's relentless
investigation of Clinton's relationship with Monica Lewinsky? Or is
Slick Willie going about his business, unflappable and secure in
the certainty that no mere prosecutor can trip him up?
</P>
<P>
   Hard to say. As soon as one of the so-called experts tells
Geraldo Rivera that Starr has stripped the gears of the Clinton
presidency, another tells Larry King that Clinton is doing just
fine and is cruising comfortably toward January 2001 and the
second-term finish line.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is probably in between: Clinton is distracted, but
he's not defeated. Not by a long shot.
</P>
<P>
   KEN STARR: It's way past time for this guy to put up or shut up.
If he has evidence of lawbreaking by Clinton or others, let's see
it.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's critics are convinced that he has nothing, or next to
nothing, and that he's dragging out his investigation to embarrass
Clinton and disrupt his presidency. Starr's fans believe that he's
methodically closing in on a guilty Bill and is simply being
careful to dot every legal ``i'' and cross every ``t.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever. Legions of just-plain-Americans who have no strong
feelings about either Starr or Clinton are ready for all this to
end. If the president broke the law, he must be held accountable;
if he didn't _ or if Starr can't prove that he did _ then Clinton
should be allowed to get back to the business of running the
country.
</P>
<P>
   BOB HOPE: We always seem to wait until some legendary figure
dies to praise him to the heavens. The tributes to Frank Sinatra
are still coming in _ and some of them are coming from people who
never said a kind word about the Chairman of the Board before he
kicked the bucket. Well, Bob Hope turned 95 the other day, and I've
decided not to wait.
</P>
<P>
   Hope is the greatest comedian who ever lived. He virtually
invented the art of stand-up comedy, paving the way for all the
Carsons, Lenos, Lettermans and Seinfelds. He was cracking wise
about politicians when most comics wanted no part of political
humor. And he made the Academy Awards worth watching, year after
year.
</P>
<P>
   Here's hoping that Hope knows how much the world appreciates
him.

<P>
   TBILISI, Georgia _ Sitting in his Manhattan office in the spring
of 1995, Mikheil Saakashvili had every reason to look forward to a
lucrative career as a big-city lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Only 26, he had attended schools in Kiev, Strasbourg and
Florence, held a degree from Columbia Law School and was winning a
reputation for diligence and legal talent. After nightfall he was
likely to be found either at the Metropolitan Opera or cheering for
the New York Knicks at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Now he is a superstar of Georgian politics, hugely admired and
widely viewed as having unlimited potential.
</P>
<P>
   Saakashvili is among the most prominent of several dozen bright
and energetic young people who are playing important roles in
building a new post-Communist order here. The president of the
central bank, Mikheil Chkuaseli, was a swiftly rising 27-year-old
business manager when he was tapped for his new post last year.
More recently, a 30-year-old World Bank official, Irakli Managadze,
was named finance minister.
</P>
<P>
   Youth is on the rise not only in government but also in hundreds
of private groups that support causes ranging from organic farming
to protection of homeless children.
</P>
<P>
   Many organizers of these groups admire the new breed of
politician, but complain that while President Eduard Shevardnadze
encourages them, he refuses to purge older loyalists with whom he
worked in his days as Georgia's Communist boss when the republic
was part of the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not what he does that bothers us, but what he doesn't
do,'' complained Levan Ramishvili, a 26-year-old human rights
advocate who works for a group called the Liberty Institute. ``He
talks a lot about democracy, but when people around him are proven
to be corrupt or to violate human rights, he keeps them on as long
as possible because he values their loyalty. The reformers are
always having to fight the bad guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Saakashvili's transformation from freewheeling New York lawyer
to someone seen as a crusading hero of a struggling democracy began
when an old friend, Zura Zhvania, arrived at his New York office
with a remarkable offer. He said he had been sent by Shevardnadze
to recruit talented young Georgians to enter politics. The desired
qualifications were intelligence, energy, idealism and no
connection to the old Communist elite.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia was then in chaos, staggering under the weight of
corruption, separatist wars in breakaway provinces, deep poverty,
pressure from a resentful Russia, and criminality so severe that
few people dared to walk the streets after dark. Saakashvili
quickly succumbed to his friend's appeal and went with his
Dutch-born wife to Tbilisi, the Georgian capital.
</P>
<P>
   When Georgians voted in national elections in December 1995,
both Zhvania and Saakashvili won seats in Parliament. Since then
they have helped shape their country's resurrection and transition
to democracy. Zhvania, now 34, is the president of Parliament.
Saakashvili, 29, is chairman of a powerful committee charged with
creating a new electoral system, an independent judiciary and a
non-political police force.
</P>
<P>
   In public opinion surveys Saakashvili often rates as the second
most popular person in Georgia, trailing only Shevardnadze. A panel
of journalists and human rights advocates named him the country's
1997 ``man of the year.'' Some foreign diplomats are already
treating him as a future president.
</P>
<P>
   ``He drives the older politicians crazy,'' said Zurab Karumidze,
editor of a new English-language magazine. ``They're used to the
Soviet style, and suddenly they have to deal with this completely
Western-oriented guy. It's not just his beliefs that are Western,
but his style and his whole approach to politics and life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's smart and full of ideas, and it's really amazing what
he's accomplished in two years,'' Karumidze said. ``But we still
don't know what kind of a politician he'll make over the long term.
It's a jungle here.''
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in his parliamentary office, where a Georgian flag hangs
above a copy of the 1789 Declaration of the Rights of Man,
Saakashvili obviously relishes his role as one of modern Georgia's
founding fathers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, there are still people in positions of power here who
were brought up in the old regime, and they have a certain
suspicion of us,'' he said in rapid-fire, idiomatic English. ``They
accuse us not only of being radical, but also pro-Western. We admit
it. For us being pro-Western is not a matter of tactics but of
values.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to make Georgia a model democracy for the whole
region, a stable country that will be successful internationally.
America taught me that you can go from nowhere to somewhere. I had
a lot of problems at the beginning, but in just a few years I had a
good job and an apartment on Central Park West. That shows a
society that's open and rewards work and merit. If we can
transplant those values here, our place in the history of this
country will be secure.''

HINGIS MOVES TO SEMIFINALS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ROBIN FINN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Since the French Open is conveniently located in Paris,
Venus Williams already had a Plan B in mind after top-seeded
Martina Hingis robbed her of the opportunity to activate Plan A and
join the elite group of four who will square off at Roland Garros
on Thursday for a spot in the women's finale on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I have all the time in the world, again, to shop; I
wish it weren't so,'' said the 17-year-old Williams, whose
quarterfinal finish in 1998 was a marked improvement on the
second-round exit she made here last year in her slam debut. But it
wasn't good enough to close the gap that separates her from the
17-year-old Swiss avenger who won every slam except this one in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   So while Williams is off scouring the Champs Elyses for fresh
beads and baguettes on Thursday, Hingis will be trying to improve
her imposing career record against Monica Seles to 6-0, and Arantxa
Sanchez Vicario, a two-time French Open champion, takes a 6-2
career edge against second-seeded Lindsay Davenport.
</P>
<P>
   Though Davenport is a first-time semifinalist at Roland Garros,
she was thrilled to reach her third consecutive slam semifinal, a
spot she claimed by dethroning the defending champion, Iva Majoli.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, I never would have imagined I'd be in the semifinals
here; I'm not far from the finals,'' said Davenport, who has never
before survived a slam semifinal and whose fondness for clay has
yet to be proven.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's improving: instead of trying to slow her game down and
do her fair share of eternal rallying, Davenport has decided to
treat clay like a hardcourt and play the kind of game that comes
most naturally. Davenport is well aware that she's unlikely to win
a war of clay court attrition against the fourth-seeded Spaniard.
</P>
<P>
   ``She loves playing here, she's the clay court player, and I
feel like I'm probably the underdog,'' said Davenport, who hasn't
faced Sanchez Vicario on clay since 1994. ``But since the last time
I played her on clay, I'm a little faster, a little smarter. I'm
going to try to beat her playing my game.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the same tactic Seles, who owns three French Open titles
among her collection of nine slams, will use. She's been unable to
muster the necessary concentration level over the past two years as
she coped with the terminal illness of her father, Karolj. But she
vowed this year's Seles is a more determined Seles than the weary
competitor who ran out of steam against Hingis in this same round
last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's coming back,'' Seles said of her focus. ``For the
past two years, I haven't the chance for my mind to be there as it
was when I was number one; since I was six, seven years old I had
that. I wish that it would come back in one match. But I really
expect myself to beat every single player when I step on the court,
whether it's the 100th-ranked player or number one.''

TOP TALENT MANAGER JOINS MIRAGE RESORTS 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ In a move designed to alter the type of
entertainment now seen in Las Vegas, Stephen Wynn, chairman of
Mirage Resorts Inc., announced the appointment Wednesday of Sandy
Gallin, a top talent manager, to join his company and start new
theaters, arenas and cabarets.
</P>
<P>
   Wynn, who helped transform modern-day casinos into legitimate
businesses with entertainment suitable for families, said that he
had hired Gallin to create theatrical shows that will eventually
end up on Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see anything in New York we can't do as well or better
here in Las Vegas,'' said Wynn. ``We will have relationships with
creative people in New York and London. I foresee a time when a hit
musical will open in Las Vegas and have a second venue in New
York.''
</P>
<P>
   Gallin, 57, a talent manager for more than 30 years, now
oversees the careers of performers such as Neil Diamond, Dolly
Parton and Mariah Carey. Over the years he has also handled Michael
Jackson, Barbra Streisand, Cher, Whoopi Goldberg and Richard Pryor.
Gallin's company, Gallin-Morey Associates, also produced films like
``Father of the Bride'' and ``Fly Away Home,'' as well as the
television series ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer.''
</P>
<P>
   Gallin said he would spend the bulk of his time in Las Vegas but
would still serve in a consulting role with his management company,
which will be run by his long-time partner, Jim Morey, who was
named chairman. Gallin said he would continue his management
relationship with some of his most important clients ``as long as
they'll have me.''
</P>
<P>
   But the bulk of Gallin's time will be spent developing what he
termed ``new and different entertainment for Las Vegas, attracting
people who normally don't work in Las Vegas.'' He declined to name
entertainers, but Wynn cited such director-performers as Tommy
Tune, Rob Marshall, the co-director and choreographer of the
current revival of ``Cabaret,'' and Marvin Hamlisch, the composer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're making friends and forming relationships with Broadway
people,'' Wynn said.
</P>
<P>
   Wynn said that entertainment in Las Vegas was destined to
undergo enormous changes in the next few years. He said concert
tours, in which performers play in 20,000-seat arenas, have
substantially replaced traditional night club acts that were
developed in Las Vegas with such performers as Frank Sinatra, Dean
Martin, Jerry Lewis and Sammy Davis Jr.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he said, lavishly-produced shows like the ones
featuring the live animal act of Siegfried and Roy, who perform
twice nightly at the Mirage and bring in $50 million in yearly
revenue, has underlined the need for theatrical-style spectacles.
Wynn said he was building an 1,100-seat Broadway-style theater at
his new 3,000-room Bellagio Hotel, which opens next year, as well
as a 15,000-seat concert arena near the Mirage.
</P>
<P>
   Wynn said he also expected Gallin to oversee the creation of
several smaller cabarets, with capacities of 600 to 700 seats,
including one at his Treasure Island resort in Las Vegas. ``The
cabaret has been reduced to virtually minute proportions and
there's no reason we can't revive it,'' said Wynn, who is also
opening Beau Rivage, a $600 million, 1,780-room resort on the
Mississippi Gulf Coast next year.

PRESSURE COOKERS HAVE COME A LONG WAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BY LISA CARY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Remember diving for cover every time your mom or
grandmother was cooking with a pressure cooker? You always feared
that the ``chtt, chtt, chtt, chtt'' noise was signalling an
eruption.
</P>
<P>
   Pressure cookers have come a long way since then. The newer
versions are safer, quieter, and increasingly popular. And, when
the weather turns hot, pressure cooking doesn't heat the kitchen as
oven or stovetop cooking would.
</P>
<P>
   Before microwave ovens became as commonplace as a toaster in the
kitchen, home cooks used the pressure cooker for fast, hot meals. A
pressure cooker can cook a soup or stew in minutes, a boneless
chicken breast within five minutes and is the fastest method for
preparing dried beans and peas, making them popular with
vegetarians.
</P>
<P>
   A wide variety of foods can be pressure-cooked, from hearty
stews to soups to cheesecake. Clam chowder takes five minutes to
cook and another 10 to simmer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It keeps your kitchen virtually cool,'' said Melanie
Northfield, who is an associate sales and marketing manager for
Fagor, a pressure-cooker manufacturer based in Spain. ``It's an all
season houseware product.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``Florida Times-Union'' reported last year that an estimated
1 million pressure cookers are sold in the United States each year,
and the number has been increasing over the past five years.
</P>
<P>
   The recent interest in pressure cookers can probably be
attributed to nostalgia and health concerns, said Robin McKenzie,
marketing vice-president for Kuhn-Rikon, a Swiss manufacturer of
pressure cookers. ``We've found all over the United States sales
are going up.''
</P>
<P>
   JoAnne O'Gara, home economist/consumer service coordinator for
National Presto Industries, a long-time American manufacturer, said
that an older age group was buying pressure cookers five to 10
years ago to replace the ones they had for years, but today, a
younger generation is also buying them.
</P>
<P>
   ``However, there's still a fear factor for people who are in
their mid-30s and older because they remember the pressure cooker
generation of old with the jiggler valves,'' O'Gara said.
</P>
<P>
   Those older than baby boomers used pressure cookers, but
children of the boomers never used them.
</P>
<P>
   However, people who are getting educated about them are buying
them, O'Gara said. ``The proper training is really starting to pay
off. People are becoming more knowledgable.''
</P>
<P>
   Northfield said the pressure cooker never lost popularity in
Europe, where it continued to develop into what it is today. ``Most
people own two to three cookers in Europe. They're on their stoves
night and day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pressure cookers today are very fast to use, they save up to
70 percent in cooking time. So it's great for anyone working,
either a woman or a man. No one seems to have time to cook healthy
these days and that's really the way to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   National Presto Industries introduced the first saucepan-style
pressure cooker in 1939 and gave it the trade name ``Presto,''
which soon became synonymous with pressure cooking. In 1949 the
Duromatic pressure cooker was developed by Kuhn Rikon in
Switzerland. More companies have emerged including Fagor, Mirro and
T-Fal, among others.n Pressure cookers aren't cheap, ranging from
$70 to $340, but if you're constantly on-the-go and don't have a
lot of time to spend in the kitchen, one can be worth the
investment.
</P>
<P>
   Cooks who are new to this cooking method are encouraged to
attend classes and demonstrations, and check out pamphlets,
booklets and video tapes to learn how to use the pressure cooker so
it won't sit on the shelf.

EPHEDRINE PROPONENTS ADMONISH TEXAS BOARD OVER PROPOSED
REGULATIONS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Optional trim included) 
 
By KATHY WALT 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ It was supposed to be a public hearing on a
proposal to restrict the sale of diet supplements and other
over-the-counter products containing ephedrine.
</P>
<P>
   But a hearing Wednesday before the Texas Board of Health _ which
has proposed classifying ephedrine as a dangerous substance and
prohibiting sales without a prescription _ sounded more like a
daylong infomercial for dietary supplements containing the
controversial substance. Ephedrine has been linked to depression,
psychosis, high blood pressure and death in some cases.
</P>
<P>
   One by one, hour after hour, though, physical therapists,
doctors, body-builders and businessmen and women from around the
country trooped to a lectern to give testimony to the weight-loss
and energy-boosting properties of the ephedrine-containing products
_ and to admonish the board that the proposed measures would have
dire financial implications not only on the Texas economy but also
on their personal lives.
</P>
<P>
   Ephedrine, an amphetamine-like stimulant, is an ingredient found
in many dietary supplements and so-called energy boosters. But
ephedrine also is a central ingredient in the illegal drug
methamphetamine, known as speed, and another illegal drug known by
the street name ``ecstasy.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of those criticizing the proposed regulations are
distributors either for Wellness International Network Ltd. or
Metabolife, two companies whose products would be regulated, under
the health board proposals.
</P>
<P>
   While many states already have regulated sales of
ephedrine-containing products, Texas health officials did not act
until after getting more than 1,200 complaints of adverse effects
dating back to 1993. Eight Texas deaths have been linked to
ephedrine in the past four years, state health officials said, and
many adverse reactions occurred in children and teen-agers. Those
reactions included headaches, high blood pressure, seizures,
strokes and death.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe it's an economic issue disguised as a health
issue,'' Philip Sindler of Dallas told commissioners.
</P>
<P>
   Individual distributors whose incomes are based on product
sales, he said, would lose out and profits would be shifted to
greedy, global pharmaceutical companies if the products become
available by prescription only.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a health issue,'' he added. ``It's an issue of where
are the profits from the sales of the products going to go.''
</P>
<P>
   What he didn't tell commissioners was that he and his wife are
among Wellness International's top money earners, with commissions
of $55,000 during a one-month period, according to an Internet site
for the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Board of Health is concerned about public safety,'' said
Health Department spokesman Doug McBride. ``They do not have a
responsibility to see that someone does make money or does not make
money.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the regulations, if adopted, would be among the toughest
in the nation. The board first proposed the rules earlier this
year. It will continue to take public comment through June 29, and
is scheduled to vote on the regulations at its September meeting.
If the regulations are passed, they would take effect in October at
the earliest.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new rules, current over-the-counter products like
Ripped Fuel, Thermajetics, Formula One, Herbal Ecstasy, Cloud 9,
Mini Thins (now sold as Mini Two-Way Action) and MaxBrand (formerly
sold as MaxAlert) would be available by prescription only under
their current formulation.
</P>
<P>
   Over-the-counter asthma products, like Primatene, would not be
affected by the proposed rules, although they contain ephedrine.
</P>
<P>
   No one at the hearing testified about the dangers of ephedrine,
however.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this really is a dangerous product, where are the
supporters of this legislation?'' asked Andy Sikora, a product
distributor who did not identify his hometown.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Among the medical experts who criticized the proposed
regulations was Theodore M. Farber, a toxicology consultant from
Maryland, who said most of the data that the federal Food and Drug
Administration has collected is anecdotal and does not support
limitations proposed by the FDA.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA has proposed labeling diet aids to warn consumers not to
take the product for more than seven days and to warn that taking
more than the recommended amount could lead to heart attack,
stroke, seizure or death.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Ketchen of Dallas, another ephedrine product distributor,
told commissioners that he had struggled with obesity all of his
life, his weight like a roller coaster _ losing 30 pounds and then
gaining it back, losing 40 pounds and then gaining that back.
</P>
<P>
   He started taking an ephedrine product about a year ago and
within five months had lost 56 pounds ``without all the pain and
suffering'' normally attributed to dieting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't take away my hopes and put me on that ugly roller
coaster I'd been on all my life,'' he pleaded.

CRISIS CALLS A DIMINISHED YELTSIN TO ACTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (See also RUSSIA-ECON)  
(ja) 
 By CELESTINE BOHLEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ There is nothing like a crisis to propel Boris Yeltsin
into action, and the bottoming out of Russia's financial markets in
recent weeks did the trick once again.
</P>
<P>
   Night after night, the 67-year-old president has been shown on
television, filling the airwaves with proof of a crisis-packed
schedule, meeting in turn with media chiefs, bankers and government
officials, threatening and cajoling each group with his familiar
bluster.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in a long time, he teamed up squarely with
his own government, placing calls to foreign leaders on its behalf
and taking upon himself the politically difficult task of selling
its package of painful budget cuts at a special meeting of
parliamentarians planned for late June.
</P>
<P>
   The financial panic that hit Russia was Yeltsin's second crisis
this spring. The first, in March, was self-inflicted when he fired
his long-time prime minister, Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, and muscled
his young nominee, Sergei Kiriyenko, through a recalcitrant
Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   For a leader with a record for short days, long absences and
uncertain attention span _ problems that are only partly explained
by his heart surgery in late 1996, Yeltsin's recent performance has
convinced many here and abroad that he is back on the job _ maybe
not to the extent that his appearances are intended to suggest, but
enough to prove that he is still in command. The question once
again is: How much longer he can keep it up?
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the evidence over the past several weeks, it
seems more and more certain that he is not giving any serious
consideration to retirement,'' noted one Western diplomat.
``Running for a third term is something that is very definitely on
his mind.''
</P>
<P>
   With Russia's next presidential elections two years away, the
jockeying for political position has already begun, and not only in
the Kremlin. The bankers and business executives who assembled
around Yeltsin's table on Tuesday were there not only to help sort
out Russia's finances, but to resume a relationship that will be
crucial if Yeltsin chooses to run again. So far, he has given mixed
signals; the most recent signal came in March, when he said he
would not run again.
</P>
<P>
   Much has changed since the 1996 election, when Yeltsin was able
to summon the near-unanimous support of business tycoons and their
news media. Several of those tycoons _ including Vladimir Gusinsky,
a media mogul who was at the Kremlin meeting, and Boris Berezovksy,
a powerful financier who was not invited _ have stated that they
are looking for alternative candidates to back.
</P>
<P>
   But Yeltsin, whose career has been a string of remarkable
comebacks, can not be counted out, particularly now that he has no
obvious political heir. And his performance over the last few
months offers evidence that he is keeping his options open, hoping
his new government will give him a record he can defend before the
voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``He strongly believes that Mr. Kiriyenko and his young team
will promote economic growth,'' said Sergei Markov, director of the
Institute of Political Studies. ``That is why he chose them. Also
because they are young: That way his rivals do not know whether to
accuse him of being too old, or the government of being too young.
As for himself, he wants to create an image of a president who is
not a sleeping lion.''
</P>
<P>
   As the father figure of a new government, Yeltsin had no choice
but to commit the power and prestige of his office to the all-out
effort to dig Russia out of its latest crisis.
</P>
<P>
   That in turn has required him to adopt the government's economic
goals, and terminology, as his own, abandoning the ambiguous
phraseology of his last prime minister, whose views and experience
as a Soviet-era manager had acted as a brake on the reformers.
</P>
<P>
   The president's task has been helped by the performance of
Kiriyenko, who comes across as a sober-minded, clear-spoken
technocrat, in stark contrast with Chermomyrdin, whose tortured
language had made him a favorite target of spoofs.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews published Wednesday in the newspaper Kommersant,
several of the executives who met with Yeltsin complemented him on
his performance during the one-and-a-half-hour talk _ though some
noted that he appeared to tire towards the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have met with Yelstin several times,'' Gusinsky noted in
Kommersant. ``For the first time I saw that the president was
completely involved with economic problems. He does not listen to
opinions, but has his own position. That is a big difference. This
position is absolutely adequate to the real situation. ``
</P>
<P>
   Aleksandr Smolensky, head of the SBS-Agro bank, suggested that
Yeltsin's main purpose in calling the executives together was to
``share responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps,'' he said, ``it is the system of checks and balances
that the president is so fond of _ as in, here sits the prime
minister but I keep the right to consult with others.''
</P>
<P>
   But those present also acknowledged that it is mostly Kiriyenko
who provided answers to questions. Someone would propose something,
said Vitali Malkin, president of Russian Credit Bank, and
``Kiriyenko said he agreed, did not agree, we are going to do that,
we have already done it, we are going to pass this or that law.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeltsin understands nothing about economics,'' said Markov,
recalling how Yeltsin's support swung in the early 1990s from
Russia's first team of economic reformers to the more protectionist
policies of Chernomyrdin. ``Now he has the next wave of new
reformers. He has to trust them, because he chose them. Mr.
Yeltsin's job is to keep power, and to run the country. He is good
at the first, and not so good at the second, so he chooses the
people who will run the country on his behalf.''
</P>
<P>
   And while he has embraced the Kiriyenko government and its
deficit-cutting program, there is nothing to stop Yeltsin from
distancing himself if the results are not successful, Markov noted.
</P>
<P>
   Even as Yeltsin geared up for his latest crisis, there were
signs of the unsteadiness that has often puzzled Kremlin watchers.
His speech seems slurred at times, his facial grimaces almost
grotesque. And there were veiled suggestions from some people at
the meeting that he was not registering everything they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last time we saw him engage in real dialogue in public
dates back to the election campaign,'' noted the Western diplomat.
``Those problems are still out there, and no one really knows what
is wrong with him.''
</P>
<P>
   But the recent crisis has again demonstrated that Yeltsin's role
at the helm of the Russian state is already a prescribed one.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't have to be very active to function,'' the diplomat
said. ``What he needs to understand is a limited number of
things.''

PRESSURE COOKER BASICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LISA CARY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - The concept of a pressure cooker is quite simple.
Because a pressure cooker is airtight, pressure builds up inside as
the liquid inside comes to a boil. The trapped steam causes the
internal temperature to rise beyond what it would be capable of
doing under normal room pressure.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure limit for a cooker is 15 pounds or 250 degrees. At
that point, if the heat is not turned down, the pressure cooker
will release steam so it won't explode. In older cookers the
pressure could build up and the steam would literally shoot the
regulator to the ceiling. After that, food could be propelled
through the vent.
</P>
<P>
   The new pressure cookers have at least two backup safety vents
and the lids must be locked into place before the pressure will
even rise. An expanding rubber gasket inside the lid prevents the
lid from being removed or unlocked until all the pressure has been
released.
</P>
<P>
   In a worst-case scenario, if the pot is left over heat for an
extended amount of time, it will not explode. All the steam will
eventually escape, the liquid will evaporate and the pot will burn.
</P>
<P>
   There is a a wide range of pressure cooker sizes and features,
and for the money you will spend, it pays to shop around. Most
kitchen stores, home accessory stores and even department stores
now carry them.
</P>
<P>
   T-Fal makes a version (the Safe 2 Visio Cooker) with a glass lid
so you can see the contents cooking. It retails for $139.99.
Kuhn-Rikon's ``Cadillac'' version has a nonstick waffle-bottom and
a glass lid that can be used in the oven up to 350 degrees. It
retails for $289.
</P>
<P>
   Pressure cookers are constructed of either aluminum,
enamel-coated carbon steel or stainless steel. Aluminum is best
known for heat conduction, but the stainless steel and
enamel-coated carbon steel has no interaction between the metal and
the food being prepared. Look for a pressure cooker of heavy-gauge
metal with an easy to clean interior and surface.
</P>
<P>
   Also look for a heat-resistant handle with a helping handle on
the other side for easier lifting.
</P>
<P>
   Soem pressure cookers can't go in the oven, although you do
brown foods in some recipes on top of the stove before pressure
cooking commences. Some kinds won't go in the dishwasher. The
rubber gaskets that help keep the lid airtight may need to be
replaced from time to time if you use the cooker often. Fagor
recommends replacing its cookers' gaskets every year.
</P>
<P>
   Other utensils that may be needed are a steam basket for
vegetables and fish, and a heat diffuser that comes in handy with a
gas stove. Some recipes call for a cake pan or a pudding mold and a
trivet.
</P>
<P>
   Look for an 800 help line, which most of the manufacturers have,
as well as websites where consumers can e-mail questions. For
preliminary research or materials, contact:

</P>
<P>
   There's also several websites that offer pressure cookers for
sail over the internet. These include: IQVC, Cybershop, Crescent,
Cendant and the Virtual Kitchen Store.

FURNISHING WITH NATURAL FIBERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS.: Zendoow is cq.)  
 (ja)  
 By MARIANNE ROHRLICH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In summer, furniture made with natural fibers is as welcome as a
cool breeze. This year, designers are returning to the basics _
straw, hemp, string, paper, reeds, even banana leaves _ for
furniture, rugs and textiles. Because many pieces are handmade,
they may be expensive, despite the humble materials.
</P>
<P>
   1. A wood bar stool wrapped with fiber string is $135 at
Interieurs, 114 Wooster St. The Italian Tulle chair has a chromed
steel frame. The back and seat are of a strong linen rope
originally used for fishing nets; $560 from New York Works at Out
of Time Architects, (212) 206-0642.
</P>
<P>
   2. Ralph Lauren's Alcade club chair is woven of banana tree
fibers. The cushion, in plaid wool, is available in other fabrics
or in leather; $6,765 at Polo Ralph Lauren, 867 Madison Ave.
</P>
<P>
   3. An Alexander Calder straw rug, 56 inches by 82 inches, has
the artist's initials and the date '74 woven into the design. It
will be auctioned on June 10 at Phillips New York, 406 E. 79th St.,
which estimates the rug will bring $3,000 to $5,000. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   4. A ``floor'' with a trompe l'oeil wood-grain design is
actually an Aleman/Moore straw rug called Zendoow. The imported
straw is hand-dyed and hand-sewn by two former milliners. The
6-by-9-foot rug, made in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, is $7,425 at
Innovations (to the trade) in the D&AMP;D Building, 979 Third Ave.
Other Aleman/Moore rugs begin at $800.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Louis XVI might cringe if he saw one of his dining chairs
upholstered in woven leaves. The Hermina chair by a Filipino
designer, Antonio ``Budji'' Layug, has a Louis XVI frame of South
Pacific rosewood, but the seat and the back are woven of the outer
peel of the rattan palm; $1,925 from Niermann Weeks (to the trade),
232 E. 59th St.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   5. Lloyd Looms introduced its first collection of woven kraft
paper furniture in 1922. Now, Lloyd/Flanders makes indoor-outdoor
furniture in 13 colors, including light green. The Reflections
rocker, which has a protective polyurethane finish, is $696 at
Gracious Home, 1220 Third Ave.
</P>
<P>
   6. A decorative centerpiece of paper twine by Ritva Puotila, a
Finnish artist, is $400 at the American Craft Museum Store, 40 W.
53rd St.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   7. A desk and dining table, named Louis XV, has hand-forged iron
legs and a top of woven Italian straw. Thirty-six inches wide by 72
inches long, it's $3,600 at Modern Stone Age, 111 Greene St.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Place mats of straw, bamboo and banana leaves cost $15 to $48;
natural straw coasters, $4. All from Kitchen Classics, (800)
251-2421. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hemp twill, which can be used for upholstery or draperies, comes
in 15 colors and costs $20 to $25 a yard at Hempinstead, 353 W.
47th St.

A CULTURAL WARD OF THE STATE BECOMES AN ORPHAN  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 7)

<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ Picture a society that has world-renowned
architects design spacious, beautiful museums, open to its citizens
free of charge; that spends millions renovating buildings into
concert halls and theaters; that goes out of its way to found new
institutions dedicated to the experimental and the avant-garde;
that invites performing artists from around the globe to come and
work, and gives them spaces in which to display their work when
they're done.
</P>
<P>
   Now picture a society that has no money for the arts: where the
museums charge steep admission fees for shows that in some cases no
one wants to see, where the opera can afford to give only a handful
of performances each month, where dance companies close and visual
and performing artists leave town because they're no longer able to
do their work.
</P>
<P>
   The first society is Frankfurt 10 years ago. The second society
is Frankfurt today. And the transformation illustrates all that's
best and worst about the German system of government-subsidized
culture _ a system that in today's economic landscape is facing the
prospect of significant structural change whether it wants it or
not.
</P>
<P>
   Frankfurt is an extreme case. Frankfurt is broke. Germany's
banking center, styled ``the city of the euro,'' is $4.5 billion in
debt. The city is a fine example of the perils of living beyond
one's means: it tries to support all of the amenities of a major
metropolis, from a subway system to its generously proportioned
cultural life, with the tax revenues from a mere 650,000 citizens
and with very little support from the state.
</P>
<P>
   In the Federal Republic of Germany, public arts financing is
borne primarily by the states, not the national government. The
states had to cut back support to their cities after they were
compelled to start ``solidarity payments'' to help finance German
reunification in the early 1990s, and they tend to give state
capitals the biggest share of their subsidies in any case.
</P>
<P>
   Munich, for example, one of Germany's wealthiest cities, has two
state opera houses, two state theaters and two state museums: 51
percent of its cultural financing comes from the state of Bavaria.
But in the state of Hessia, it is Wiesbaden, not Frankfurt, that is
the capital, and Frankfurt receives only 6 percent of its cultural
budget from Hessia; Frankfurt's cultural institutions are municipal
rather than state (the Stadtische Buhnen, or City Theaters, rather
than the Staatsoper, or State Opera).
</P>
<P>
   So a city half Munich's size, with only a fraction of its
resources, is trying to compete with the Bavarian capital and other
German cities as well. Small wonder that when the crunch hit in
1993, Frankfurt found itself so strapped that it started dimming
its street lights after 9 p.m. to save on its electric bill.
</P>
<P>
   In its heyday, however, Frankfurt put itself on the German
cultural map. In the 1980s, it had both the money and the
initiative. Hilmar Hofmann, who ran the city's cultural scene for
two decades as cultural adviser, did his best to use his power to
create an artistic utopia.
</P>
<P>
   From the late 70s to the early 90s, 12 major museums were built
or completely renovated. The Alte Oper, the bombed-out old opera
house that had sat in ruins since the war, was painstakingly
restored and reopened as a concert hall in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   At the Stadtische Buhnen, the conductor Michael Gielen led
operas staged by avant-garde directors like Ruth Berghaus and Hans
Neuenfels; the Playhouse (Schauspiel) erupted with scandals over
works by the filmmaker Rainer Werner Fassbinder and the theater
director Einar Schleef; and the choreographer William Forsythe
arrived in 1984 to take over the ballet company and transform it
into the critically applauded blend of ballet and modern
Tanz-theater that it is today.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller institutions opened, too, and flourished: the
experimental Theater am Turm, or TAT, presented cutting-edge
companies from around the world (the Wooster Group was one); the
Mousonturm, with a similar program, also cultivated in-house groups
like Rui Horta's innovative dance company, SOAP. At its height,
12.5 percent of the city's annual budget went to support culture.
</P>
<P>
   Like New York's &UR;  &LR; in a long bull market, Frankfurt's overspending
had a certain manic quality. ``We knew it couldn't last,'' says
Martina Aschmies, the Mousonturm's communications director. ``But I
think it's good that Mr. Hofmann created such a flourishing
cultural landscape. All you can do is set it up and hope it has the
strength to survive.''
</P>
<P>
   The question now is what will survive. When the $4.5 billion
deficit first became evident in 1993 (it has held steady since), it
was clear that arts support would have to be reduced, although
cultural spending still represents some 8.5 percent of the city
budget.
</P>
<P>
   How to implement cuts was less clear. Any cut was bound to raise
howls of pain from Frankfurt arts administrators. In Frankfurt's
continuing cultural crisis, the politicians have been so roundly
criticized, so often derided as philistines, that one might think
they were willfully making senseless cuts on a whim, rather than
reacting to a financial crisis so severe that Hessia at one point
threatened to take away Frankfurt's financial autonomy altogether.
</P>
<P>
   It takes the objectivity of a resident foreigner like Forsythe
or Christopher Hunt, the recently departed director of the Alte
Oper, to note that ``the politicians' position is impossible; there
is no money,'' as Hunt puts it.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Being democratic, the politicians opted for evenhanded
reductions across the board. The Mousonturm's Ms. Aschmies, and
most other cultural administrators in Frankfurt, object to what
they call ``the lawn mower principle'' of reducing financing.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was needed were concepts,'' says Ms. Aschmies. ``If there
had to be closures, they should have been made decisively, not just
these small cuts every year so the whole thing withers away.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Aschmies feels that the Mousonturm has been penalized for
its willingness to cooperate and work within the tighter budget,
that the politicians' attitude is, well, if you can work so well
with that little money, we'll trim off a bit more.
</P>
<P>
   The conductor Sylvain Cambreling, who took over as Artistic
Director of the Frankfurt Opera in 1993, just as the crisis struck,
watched his budget dwindle, too, until he left in disgust in 1997.
``It's like taking a three-star gourmet restaurant and turning it
into a McDonald's,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Defenders of across-the-board cuts question the authority of
politicians to make what amount to judgment calls, the
pronouncement that one arts institution ``deserves'' to survive
while another must close.
</P>
<P>
   An unspoken reason for Germany's generosity and decentralized
largess in its public-arts spending has been a desire to avoid what
happened when a previous national government took an aggressive
role in arts policy: book burnings, exhibitions of ``degenerate
art'' and the like.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians all over Germany are also restrained by what a
Frankfurt City Councilman, Felix Semmelroth, describes as ``the
German fear of closing down an existing institution.'' This was
demonstrated in Berlin when the Schiller Theater closed in 1993.
Never mind that the theater, however long and glorious its
tradition, was playing to about 50 percent of capacity; never mind
that reunified Berlin was and is bursting at the seams with the
glut of institutions resulting from joining two separate cities.
</P>
<P>
   Every newspaper in the country rose up to beat on the same drum,
attacking the philistinism and ignorance of politicians depriving
the city of a national treasure. Few politicians want to repeat the
experience by actually closing something down in Frankfurt.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians are also hampered by the entrenched nature of the
system. Most year-round spoken and operatic theaters in Germany _
and there are more than 150 of them _ are not only
government-supported but also entrenched bureaucracies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The City Theaters are Office No. 46,'' says Semmelroth. ``I
have to approve the Intendant's application when he wants to go on
a business trip.'' All of a theater's employees _ singers, actors
and musicians as well as administrative staff _ are technically
government officials, with full benefits, paid six-week vacations
and total job security.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, a theater's budget is allocated in certain ways:
staff can't be laid off, and, says Forsythe, ``if you need an extra
20,000 for sets and you have it in costumes, you can't trade it
in.'' Because of this, a theater's fixed operating costs are not
negotiable, which means if the budget is cut, the money has to come
out of the sum that goes toward actually mounting productions.
</P>
<P>
   This fact has been very evident in Frankfurt in months when the
opera house staged a mere seven or eight performances, rather than
playing every night.
</P>
<P>
   An alternative to this system is the GMBH (company with limited
liability, or incorporated), exemplified by the Mousonturm. Still
relatively new in Germany in its application to cultural
institutions, such privatization gives an institution the autonomy
to decide how to allocate its subsidies for itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why pay year round for 20 seamstresses I use for 15 days a
year when I can hire 5 tailors for 2 weeks?'' asks Forsythe, who
explored turning his ballet company into a GMBH in his contract
negotiations this spring. But as the Mousonturm also illustrates,
the drawback of an incorporated company, from the point of view of
German arts administrators, is that the government then has no
legal obligation to maintain the subsidy.
</P>
<P>
   In general, Germany, an essentially conservative country,
doesn't take well to change. Suggestions regarding the virtues of
private arts financing on the American model were received with the
polite but firm opinion that it could never work in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Now in Frankfurt, after some years of much-touted and undeniable
crisis, you can actually hear people talking about the necessity
for change.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we want to save our culture at all,'' says Dr. Martin
Steinhoff, business director of the Frankfurt Opera, ``we have to
be prepared to change our structures.'' Administrators and
politicians are adopting a quasi-capitalist vocabulary from the
American-style model: incorporated structures, private foundations,
corporate sponsorship (the latter still in its infancy here).
Semmelroth even talks with feeling about ``trying to convince
museum directors to open museum shops.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't think that way,'' he adds.
</P>
<P>
   While no one wants to relieve politicians of the obligation to
pay for culture, cultural administrators in Frankfurt can now
regard public arts support as something other than their God-given
right.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ridiculous to say, I need this much money or I can't
operate,'' says Michael Hocks, director of the Alte Oper. ``You
have to say, `I have this much; now, what can I do with it?' ''

 FRANKFURT: with it?'''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hocks represents what could be a new breed of German Intendants.
On Jan. 1, he took over a hall whose subsidy has fallen by half
since it opened in 1981, from $14 million to $7 million, and is
slated to drop a further $2 million by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   But rather than wringing his hands, Hocks exudes a confident
optimism: the Alte Oper, recently plagued by financial difficulty,
is in his view still the ``flagship'' of Frankfurt's culture. The
Alte Oper is a GMBH, so it's been able to streamline, reducing its
personnel from a high of 400 to the current 30: concessions are
rented out and technical staff brought in from outside for big
productions.
</P>
<P>
   Hocks plans to restructure the subscription series, building on
the hall's standing relationships with the Ensemble Modern or the
Chamber Orchestra of Europe while continuing a program of visiting
groups that already extends from the Bavarian Radio Orchestra to
James Taylor to touring productions of shows like ``West Side
Story.''
</P>
<P>
   Hocks is perhaps abler than any other German administrator to be
flexible about state support: he comes to the Alte Oper after a
decade at the Hoechst Jahrhunderthalle (Century Hall), a private
facility run by the chemical company Hoechst: a virtually
unparalleled example of corporate arts financing in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   For all the gloom and doom about Frankfurt's situation _
headlines on Frankfurt's crisis have become standard on German
newspapers' arts pages _ there are signs that the city's cultural
life is, collectively, getting its second wind.
</P>
<P>
   As Hocks gets the Alte Oper on its feet, William Forsythe is
about to take over the TAT, which he hopes to build up into the
kind of avant-garde center it used to be under Tom Stromberg in the
1980s (with, of course, a special emphasis on dance). While some
museums struggle, others, like the Museum for Modern Art under
Jean-Christophe Amman, continue to attract attention.
</P>
<P>
   And the opera, which fell back on a regimen of ``greatest
hits,'' from ``Carmen'' to ``La Boheme,'' after Cambreling's
departure, is also continuing its commitment to the modern.
</P>
<P>
   In March, a mini-festival called ``Henze Days'' surrounded a new
production of ``Boulevard Solitude'' by Hans Werner Henze, a living
composer whose works tend to appeal to audiences; the critic
Gerhard Rohde described this Frankfurt attempt to be ``a little bit
modern'' as a link with ``the good old days'' of Gielen and
Cambreling. And next season, the composer Wolfgang Rihm arrives to
head a new, permanent workshop for contemporary opera.
</P>
<P>
   Germany's state support of the arts has allowed the development
of a performing arts culture unequaled in the world, supporting
progressive developments in stage direction, in musical
performance, in contemporary composition.
</P>
<P>
   But the generosity has also supported a certain level of
mediocrity, as institutions become overly comfortable and their
structures increasingly unwieldy. Germany's industry is pulling out
of the recession of the early 1990s, but the arts continue to
struggle.
</P>
<P>
   Like the lumbering vessels of the Spanish Armada, the
established city and state arts institutions are proving less
maneuverable than other models, and people are beginning to
question whether there is really need for four opera houses within
a 50-mile radius of a city like Frankfurt.
</P>
<P>
   The best argument against closing an institution is probably
still the presence of vital, high-quality art. And events in
Frankfurt may be demonstrating not the hopeless incompetence of
politicians but the fact that change doesn't have to mean the end
of the world, that ``crisis'' can serve as a wake-up call.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bad years are behind us,'' says the opera's Steinhoff.
``The other German cities, those which have more money, still have
their bad years ahead.''

`PEOPLE OF THE CENTURY' IS A HALF-HEARTED EFFORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Go figure. Maybe it's because of Time magazine's
affiliation-by-merger with CNN, but if ever there was a
half-hearted special on TV, it's CBS's ``People of the Century: CBS
News/Time 100 _ Artists and Entertainers'' Thursday night. (Check
local listings.)
</P>
<P>
   What could have been a riveting two- or even three-hour look at
some remarkably talented, inspirational and just plain weird people
is instead a one-hour rush job that seems to have produced as an
afterthought. Not that it's badly done. The editing, in fact, is
laudable. Try cramming 20 people (24, actually) into a 60-minute
format (about 45, after commercials) and see what you can come up
with.
</P>
<P>
   But if everyone on this list of the century's top
arts-and-entertainment types were to get equal time, we're talking
roughly two minutes per listee. Instead, CBS chose to do
mini-profiles of a handful _ Lucille Ball, Louis Armstrong, Jim
Henson, Steven Spielberg, Marlon Brando, Aretha Franklin and Frank
Sinatra among them _ and had to reduce most of the others to less
information than is contained in this paragraph. So Charles-Edouard
Jeanneret, the Swiss architect and design guru known more widely as
Le Corbusier, gets about as much air time as a deadbeat cellphone
customer.
</P>
<P>
   What's odd is that the list is not just a parroting of something
conceived by Time magazine. CBS clearly had input; Mike Wallace,
who hosts tonight's special, even persuaded Time's managing editor,
Walter Isaacson, to yank Elvis Presley off the arts/entertainment
Top 20 _ can you say ``Return to Sender''? _ and replace him with
Sinatra. Wallace's argument was that, in terms of their influence
on personal style, the Chairman of the Board had more sway than the
King.
</P>
<P>
   I could quibble with that, but I'm 47 years old. Mike Wallace
hasn't seen 47 since the Johnson administration, and generational
differences are what help to make these list-making endeavors so
enjoyable. And frustrating.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, the ``Artists and Entertainers'' top 20, with the
Beatles and Rodgers &AMP; Hammerstein each counting as one entry, are:
Lucille Ball, Oprah Winfrey, Jim Henson, Louis Armstrong, Igor
Stravinsky, James Joyce, T.S. Eliot, Pablo Picasso, Steven
Spielberg, Marlon Brando, the Beatles, Bob Dylan, Aretha Franklin,
Richard Rodgers/Oscar Hammerstein, Martha Graham, Le Corbusier,
Coco Chanel, Charlie Chaplin, Frank Sinatra and Bart Simpson.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Bart Simpson. Never mind that he's fictional. Wallace, or
at least Wallace's script, says Bart is ``as funny as Lucy, as
angry as Dylan, as deep as Joyce.''
</P>
<P>
   Ay, carumba!
</P>
<P>
   We could argue all day about who isn't on the list, which, not
surprisingly, centers on people who made their names in the United
States, with the remainder all hailing from Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Such wasn't the case with the first list, ``Leaders and
Revolutionaries,'' which Time published (and CBS aired) in April.
Along with the likely suspects _ Churchill, Lenin and Roosevelt
(Theodore/Franklin/Eleanor) _ there was a smattering from outlying
precincts, such as Gandhi, Mandela, Mao Zedong, Ho Chi Minh and the
``unknown rebel'' who stood in front of the column of tanks near
Tiananmen Square in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   If you're wondering why someone like Muhammad Ali isn't on the
latest list, it's because sports figures _ entertainers in my book
_ will be included in the ``Heroes and Adventurers'' segment next
year. Also still to come: ``Builders and Titans,'' slated for
December, ``Scientists and Healers'' next year, and a final special
exploring the life and impact of the CBS/Time Person of the
Century.
</P>
<P>
   With six episodes committed to this one project on ``the 100
most important people of the 20th century,'' it's easy to see why
CBS is condensing each subcategory of 20 individuals into a
60-minute box. Too bad. In the hands of A&AMP;E or Discovery, this
could have been a wonderfully enriching, seasonlong series of
biographical specials.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Time insisted that CBS not steal too much of its
thunderWhatever the case, CBS tonight offers viewers a good reason
to seek out this week's edition of Time or visit the magazine's Web
site (www.pathfinder.com/time/). Don't bother with CBS's Web site
(www.cbs.com). You'll only find information on the people mentioned
in the mini-profiles. Nothing on Le Corbusier. Or Bart, for that
matter.
</P>
<P>
   When TV sets and computers are totally wired and we're all
nauseatingly interactive, a lip-service approach like tonight's
won't matter much. We'll just click on the remote and go barreling
off to a site that provides more ``stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   But as we wait for that time to come along, CBS would do well to
remember that information was power to the people of this century.
It will be in the next, too.

 &HT;     CLINTON WARNS INDIA, PAKISTAN AGAINST `ARMS RACE;' RENEWS
FAVORED TRADING STATUS FOR CHINA
 &HT;     By BOB DEANS 
 &HT;     c.1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Hoping to press India and Pakistan to ``reverse
course and to avoid a dangerous arms race,'' President Clinton
dispatched his top diplomat Wednesday to Geneva to huddle with the
envoys of four other major powers over how best to reduce mounting
tensions on the Indian subcontinent.
</P>
<P>
   Standing beside Clinton at the White House, Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright vowed to ``do my very best,'' in Geneva, but
warned that there were stark limits to U.S. influence in the
region.
</P>
<P>
   ``The risks of the moment are high, and, for the moment, the key
choices will be made in New Delhi and Islamabad,'' she said,
referring to the Indian and Pakistani capitals. ``We must all hope
and pray those choices are the right ones.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton praised the efforts of China, which will chair
Thursday's meeting in Geneva, and said such cooperation underscored
the importance of renewing most favored nation trading status with
Beijing, a step the president took Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Albright said one goal in Thursday's meeting is to try to bring
India and Pakistan together to discuss the single most contentious
security issue between them: the fate of Kashmir, seat of four
decades of sectarian strife that has left tens of thousands dead.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan has sought U.S. assistance in addressing the subject,
but India's government has insisted that third countries stay out
of the matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Indians have not wanted it to be discussed,'' Albright
told reporters at a State Department briefing shortly before she
left for Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither side is blameless,'' in the complicated conflict,
Albright said. ``The bottom line here is, they've got to stop.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has been wrestling for weeks over
escalating tensions and a series of nuclear tests by India _ which
detonated five nuclear devices last month _ and neighboring
Pakistan _ which responded by detonating six last week.
</P>
<P>
   In both cases, Clinton had tried to use diplomacy, including
several personal phone calls to Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif, to head off the tests.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of both countries, however, said their own national
security concerns outweighed the pleadings of the American
president, who insisted Wednesday that both countries refrain from
further tests, agree to not attach nuclear weapons to delivery
systems such as missiles and join in a dialogue to allay
longstanding tensions between them.
</P>
<P>
   ``India and Pakistan are great nations with boundless potential,
but developing weapons of mass destruction is self-defeating,
wasteful and dangerous. It will make their people poorer and less
secure,'' Clinton told reporters gathered in the Rose Garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``The international community must now come together to move
them to reverse course and to avoid a dangerous arms race in
Asia.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright's mission to Geneva is aimed at coordinating a broader
response that might better make use of the influence that Russia
has on India and China has on Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting Thursday of top diplomats from the five permanent
members of the United Nations Security Council _ the United States,
Britain, China, France and Russia _ is being chaired by the
Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   China stands accused of clandestinely assisting the Pakistanis
in developing long-range missiles and other potentially offensive
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, though, who plans to visit Beijing later this month,
praised the Chinese, saying they were playing a constructive role
in global non-proliferation efforts and calling for improved ties
between the two giant Pacific powers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is further evidence of the important role China can play
in meeting the challenges of the 21st Century,'' Clinton said.
``This is an important example of how our engagement with China
serves America's interests _ stability in Asia, preventing the
spread of weapons of mass destruction, combating international
crime and drug trafficking, protecting the environment.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Engagement is the administration's term for working closely with
the Chinese government and the Chinese people, as opposed to
isolating Beijing or imposing trade and economic sanctions _ as is
U.S. policy toward Cuba, which, like China, is a one-party
communist state infamous for widespread human rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
   Buttressing his engagement policy, Clinton renewed China's most
favored nation trading status, or MFN, on Wednesday, the day before
the annual June 4 deadline for doing so, according Chinese products
the same low tariffs in this country as the exports of most U.S.
trading partners.
</P>
<P>
   The president's renewal of MFN will stand unless it's overturned
by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Some representatives oppose MFN for China, claiming that the
country should be denied favorable trading terms with the United
States unless and until it improves its human rights record. Others
have raised concerns over Clinton's decision last year to allow the
transfer to China of sensitive satellite technology, which critics
maintain Beijing could use for military purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said, however, that the best way to work for change in
China is to improve relations and build common ground, not punish
Beijing with sanctions that most of rest of the world would not
match.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not to renew (MFN) would be to sever our economic, and, to a
large measure, our strategic relationship with China, turning our
back on a fourth of the world,'' Clinton said. ``This policy
clearly is in our nation's interests, and I urge Congress to
support it.''

ADVERTISING: INTERNET AD DEALS PICK UP 
</HEADLINE>
  (dc) 
 By COURTNEY KANE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The pace of deals involving interactive advertising accelerated
Wednesday as three acquisitions and affiliations were announced.
</P>
<P>
   In one deal, 24/7 Media Inc. in New York acquired Cliqnow Sales
Group, the Internet advertising sales representation division of K2
Design Inc. in New York, for $1 million in cash and $3 million in
convertible preferred stock of 24/7.
</P>
<P>
   Cliqnow, which K2 started in 1996, has 10 employees who handle
ad sales for 75 Web sites including those of The Associated Press,
PR Newswire and the Women's Forum. Cliqnow will operate as an
autonomous unit of 24/7 with sales staffs in Chicago, Los Angeles,
New York and San Francisco, and the Cliqnow sub-networks, offering
computer users content on topics like finance and travel, will
operate separately from the 24/7 network.
</P>
<P>
   Though Cliqnow has been successful, said Matthew de Ganon,
president at K2, ``we need to focus specifically on our core
interactive advertising and media business.'' The sale, he added,
would enable K2 to concentrate on that ``and pursue aggressive
growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Paternoster, 32, president at Cliqnow, and Joe Apprendi,
31, executive vice president, will continue in those roles and also
become senior vice presidents at 24/7.
</P>
<P>
   The second deal involved Double Click Inc. in New York, an
interactive advertising network, and Ad Knowledge in Palo Alto,
Calif., which provides tools for Internet media planning and buying
and campaign management. The two companies have formed a strategic
partnership; financial terms were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of the affiliation is to integrate the technologies of
the two companies to create standard industry platforms for Web ad
management that would help make buying and selling online
advertising more efficient and effective. Ad Knowledge will now
focus primarily on operations intended to help advertisers and
agencies buy ads on the Internet while Double Click will support
the Ad Knowledge operations focused on selling ads on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, customers of Click Wise, the Ad Knowledge Web site
ad management software, will now be about to use the Double Click
DART service, a proprietary technology offering ad server,
reporting and tracking abilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the online ad industry continues to expand, there is
significant benefit to creating uniform standards for site
publishers and advertising agencies,'' said Kevin O'Connor,
chairman and chief executive at Double Click. ``With the
standardization that this partnership represents, we believe that
online advertising will improve industry-wide. And, by
consolidating our efforts with Ad Knowledge, we believe we can
expand DART's reach and market penetration.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Kauffman, president and chief exective at Ad Knowledge
said, ``We believe DART provides the best solution for Web site
publishers and we are confident our Click Wise customers will
benefit tremendously from the power of Double Click advanced
technology.'' Both Kauffman, 41, and O'Connor, 37, will continue in
their respective roles.
</P>
<P>
   The third deal involved Interactive8, an online marketing agency
in New York, which acquired Tuckett/Parshall Interactive in New
York, a specialist in interactive advertising aimed at black
consumers. Financial terms were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Tuckett/Parshall, which will be renamed as the TPI division of
Interactive8, has estimated billings of $500,000 from clients like
Essence magazine, Motown Records and Morgan Stanley, Dean Witter &AMP;
Co. TPI will be headed by Lawrence Tuckett, 43, founder and partner
at Tuckett/Parshall, who also becomes creative director, and
Michael Waite, 30, partner, who becomes executive producer.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition ``puts us at the forefront of urban online
marketing and will greatly benefit companies expanding into the
African-American consumer demographic,'' said Bill Markel, partner
at Interactive8. Interactive8 has 37 employees and estimated
billings of $4.9 million from clients like AT&AMP;T Corp., the Citibank
unit of Citicorp and the M&AMP;M/Mars unit of Mars Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The quickening pace of deal-making in cyberspace is echoing the
frenzied deal-making among traditional agencies as well as
reflecting how the dynamics of interactive advertising and
marketing are changing rapidly as the industry grows.
</P>
<P>
   Other Internet-related deals in the last month included two
acquisitions by Agency.com in New York; the purchase of Digital
Cafe, a digital media agency in St. Paul, by Campbell Mithun Esty
in Minneapolis, which is majority owned by the Interpublic Group;
the acquisition of Circle Interactive in Boston by Arnold
Communications, a unit of Snyder Communications in Boston, and the
expansion of the online career services of TMP Worldwide in New
York through the purchase of two Web sites, About Work and Student
Center, from Ivillage in New York for $1.7 million in cash.

 &HT;     CLINTON WARNS INDIA, PAKISTAN AGAINST `ARMS RACE;' RENEWS
FAVORED TRADING STATUS FOR CHINA
 &HT;     By BOB DEANS 
 &HT;     c.1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Hoping to press India and Pakistan to ``reverse
course and to avoid a dangerous arms race,'' President Clinton
dispatched his top diplomat Wednesday to Geneva to huddle with the
envoys of four other major powers over how best to reduce mounting
tensions on the Indian subcontinent.
</P>
<P>
   Standing beside Clinton at the White House, Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright vowed to ``do my very best,'' in Geneva, but
warned that there were stark limits to U.S. influence in the
region.
</P>
<P>
   ``The risks of the moment are high, and, for the moment, the key
choices will be made in New Delhi and Islamabad,'' she said,
referring to the Indian and Pakistani capitals. ``We must all hope
and pray those choices are the right ones.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton praised the efforts of China, which will chair
Thursday's meeting in Geneva, and said such cooperation underscored
the importance of renewing most favored nation trading status with
Beijing, a step the president took Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Albright said one goal in Thursday's meeting is to try to bring
India and Pakistan together to discuss the single most contentious
security issue between them: the fate of Kashmir, seat of four
decades of sectarian strife that has left tens of thousands dead.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan has sought U.S. assistance in addressing the subject,
but India's government has insisted that third countries stay out
of the matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Indians have not wanted it to be discussed,'' Albright
told reporters at a State Department briefing shortly before she
left for Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither side is blameless,'' in the complicated conflict,
Albright said. ``The bottom line here is, they've got to stop.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has been wrestling for weeks over
escalating tensions and a series of nuclear tests by India _ which
detonated five nuclear devices last month _ and neighboring
Pakistan _ which responded by detonating six last week.
</P>
<P>
   In both cases, Clinton had tried to use diplomacy, including
several personal phone calls to Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif, to head off the tests.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of both countries, however, said their own national
security concerns outweighed the pleadings of the American
president, who insisted Wednesday that both countries refrain from
further tests, agree to not attach nuclear weapons to delivery
systems such as missiles and join in a dialogue to allay
longstanding tensions between them.
</P>
<P>
   ``India and Pakistan are great nations with boundless potential,
but developing weapons of mass destruction is self-defeating,
wasteful and dangerous. It will make their people poorer and less
secure,'' Clinton told reporters gathered in the Rose Garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``The international community must now come together to move
them to reverse course and to avoid a dangerous arms race in
Asia.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright's mission to Geneva is aimed at coordinating a broader
response that might better make use of the influence that Russia
has on India and China has on Pakistan.

   CHICAGO-THEATER (Chicago) _ Even though the second-largest,
after New York, Chicago's theater community is probably the
nation's most tightly knit, arguably its most adventurous and
almost certainly its most important incubator of young talent. By
Bruce Weber. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   BROADWAY-SEASON-PLAYS (New York) _ There were occasions during
the recent New York theater season, which is celebrated by the
presentation of Sunday night's Tony Awards, when the gasp sound
flew out of audiences who had achieved a rapt, respectful communion
with what was happening on the stages before them. The inspirations
for these abrupt responses, which are surely more gratifying to
actors than even standing ovations, are wildly varied and, taken
out of context, unremarkable. By Ben Brantley. (Moved). Photo.

   FILMS4KIDS (Undated) _ Brief reviews of films and their

Heroes''; ``The Truman Show'' and ``I Got the Hook-Up.'' (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   BALZAC-FILMS (Undated) _ Suddenly, movie makers are landing on
Planet Balzac. On Friday, two films on the French writer Honore de
Balzax, representing two extremes of his oeuvre, are opening. One
is ``Passion in the Desert,'' an impressionistic allegory that has
been adapted by the American director Lavinia Currier for her first
feature from an eight-page short story of 1830. The other is a new
adaptation of ``Cousin Bette,'' the sprawling 1847 drama of manners
that is one of Balzac's best-known novels; this movie is the first
to be directed by the Tony-winning theater director Des McAnuff
(``Big River,'' ``The Who's `Tommy' ''). By Jean Nathan. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   COMDEN-GREEN-FILMS (New York) _ Eight MGM musicals with Betty
Comden and Adolp Green screenplays or lyrics _ the earliest is from
1947, the latest from 1960 _ will be shown at the Film Forum
starting Friday and running through June 25, and the series gleams
with their powers of invention. By Nora Sayre. (Moved).

   &UR; DANCE  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   AMERICAN-DANCE-FESTIVAL (Undated) _ One of the most significant
accomplishments of the American Dance Festival in its 65-year
history has been its shedding light on the rich but often
little-known contributions of black choreographers to American
modern dance. The festival, in Durham, N.C., will continue the
programming this Thursday through Sunday with ``Masterpieces of the
Black Tradition.'' By Jennifer Dunning. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   SCHORER-DANCE (New York) _ At 5-feet-2-inches tall, Suki Schorer
perches precariously on a ballet barre, giving her the maximum
overview of her students in Studio 3 at the School of American
Ballet at Lincoln Center. She needs the extra height to conduct a
rehearsal of Balanchine's challenging ``Donizetti Variations,'' one
of three ballets presented this weekend at SAB's Workshop
Performance at the Juilliard Theater. By Hilary Ostlere. (Moved).

   &UR; CLASSICAL MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ARIANNA-OPERA (New York) _ ``Arianna,'' which will be given its
first American performance Sunday by the Opera Theater of St.
Louis, is not exactly a new work and not exactly an old one. Quite
who wrote it is also in doubt. According to the title page of the
score, it is a ``lost opera by Claudio Monteverdi ... composed
again by Alexander Goehr,'' the English composer who, now 65, has
steadily been gaining a reputation for music at once serious and
playful, beautiful and quirky, as this is. By Paul Griffiths.
(Moved).
</P>
<P>
   HEADLINE-OPERA (Undated) _ The fad for headline opera, a genre
that began so promisingly in 1987 with John Adams's ``Nixon in
China'' and fizzled last year with Michael Daugherty's ``Jackie
O,'' seems to have passed. Breathe a sigh of relief, knowing that
we have been spared operas based on O.J., Tonya and Paula. Yet a
new recording of ``Harvey Milk'' (Teldec 0630-15856-2; two CDs),
with music by Stewart Wallace and libretto by Michael Korie, shows
that the attempt to link the opera house to the nightly news may
have been a missed opportunity rather than a cynical marketing
strategy. By David Schiff. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   BRAHMS-BIO (Undated) _ Some biographers see clearly. They keep
their affections in tow and tell the unpleasant facts. Jan
Swafford's ``Johannes Brahms'' (Alfred A. Knopf) does this, at
least to a point. What Swafford writes about Brahms and the people
around him rarely flinches from the fact that the great German
composer was in many ways not a nice man at all. By Bernard
Holland. (Moved).

   KURT-COURTNEY-FILM (Undated) _ Courtney Love has a genius for
alienating people. That's one indisputable fact that emerges in
``Kurt and Courtney,'' the documentary by Nick Bloomfield that
opened on Friday. Ex-boyfriends, ex-employees, acquaintances and
even Ms. Love's father are more than happy to say nasty things
about her. By Jon Pareles. (Moved). &UR;

   CARICATURE-ART (Washington) _ The National Portrait Gallery's

America,'' with 229 drawings, paintings and artifacts on view
through Aug. 23 trace the rise of a new, formally playful approach
to caricature that flowered in the years between the two world

   BERLIN-ART (Undated) _ For Berlin's latest incarnation as

works. By Michael Z. Wise. (Moved).
</P>

   FRANKFURT-ARTS (Frankfurt, Germany) _ Frankfurt illustrates all

three-hour special ``Robert F. Kennedy: A Memoir'' (beginning
Sunday night at 8), based on Jack Newfield's 1969 book, is about
politics, of course. It's about the Senate racket hearings, the
civil rights movement, presidential campaigns, power plays and the
Vietnam War. But the personal side of Kennedy, who was assassinated
in Los Angeles 30 years ago (June 5, 1968), comes across with just
as much impact. By Anita Gates. (Moved).

<P>
   SEINFELD-SCRIPTS-ANTIQUES (Undated) _ As they say on television,
stay tuned: On June 18, little more than a month after the
quintessentially self-involved quartet from ``Seinfeld'' went the
way of the barroom busybodies on ``Cheers'' and the medics on
``M-A-S-H,'' Christie's East is scheduled to auction the 68-page
script with all the ``alrights.'' Christie's East estimates that
the script from the 1992-93 season will go for $1,500 to $2,000. By

ECONOMIC SCENE: IMF'S RX FOR RUSSIA RAISES CONCERNS 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also RUSSIA-ECON, RUSSIA-YELTSIN) 
(mk) 
 By PETER PASSELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Yet another emerging-market economy has been forced to the brink
by financial panic. And yet again the International Monetary Fund
is riding to the rescue.
</P>
<P>
   Only this time around the economy at risk is Russia, which is
far more feeble yet far more important in geopolitical terms than
the Asian Tigers. And the drumbeat is growing from critics of the
IMF, which places an enormous premium on stabilizing currency
exchange rates, sometimes at very high costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia is being asked to crush the opportunity for economic
growth in the name of short-term market stability,'' said Jeffrey
Sachs, the director of Harvard's Institute for International
Development.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, in a world of capital markets that can move
billions at the stir of a rumor, the alternatives to the IMF
prescription seem almost as problematic.
</P>
<P>
   President Boris Yeltsin gets a passing mark on economic reform
only if you grade on a curve. True, much of the economy's
industrial base has been privatized. Inflation is down to single
digits. And though the budget deficit in the first quarter of this
year _ at 4.6 percent of gross domestic product _ was high by
Western standards, it was right on the track set by the IMF.
</P>
<P>
   What has not been done, though _ or has been done badly _ haunts
the government. Sachs, for one, makes a big distinction between its
rapid privatization of manufacturing and its sale of natural
resources, notably oil and gas reserves.
</P>
<P>
   The former was a step forward, since the only hope for
modernizing Soviet enterprises was to introduce free market
incentives. But the ``virtual giveaway of hundreds of billions of
dollars in natural wealth deprived the state of desperately needed
revenues and created a powerful class of robber barons,'' Sachs
argues.
</P>
<P>
   The search for revenue has compounded Moscow's problems,
suggests Richard Medley, a New York adviser on financial risk
management. Under pressure from the IMF, tax rates were set high _
``so high,'' Medley said, ``that no one can afford to pay them.''
As a result, tax evasion has become the norm and, in the
time-tested fashion of politicians seeking to shed blame, Yeltsin
has ousted the tax collector.
</P>
<P>
   While the proximate cause of the financial panic of the last few
weeks was the failure of the government to sell off the Rosneft oil
enterprise for some $2 billion, no one doubts that the stage was
set by the financial troubles in Asia. And to some, the Asian
Tigers' continuing wobble suggests that the IMF has prescribed the
wrong medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Wade, a visiting scholar at the Russell Sage Foundation,
argues that the high interest rates and tight fiscal policy that
the IMF has demanded as a means of restoring confidence in the
Asian currencies is destroying indebted, but otherwise healthy,
businesses. ``The IMF spends too much effort defending old
orthodoxies _ not to mention the interests of Asia's foreign
creditors,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For such skeptics, the big question is whether the IMF is again
applying flawed priorities and policies in Russia. Over the last
three years, Russia's domestic inflation has outpaced the
depreciation of the ruble by about 35 percent, Sachs noted,
attracting the attention of speculators even before Asia caught the
currency flu. Yet the IMF is encouraging the Yeltsin government to
use its dwindling credibility and foreign currency reserves in a
last-ditch defense of the exchange rate.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Sachs is convinced the effort will ultimately fail. But even if
it does not, struggling Russian businesses could be shattered by
the exorbitant interest rates the government is paying to hold the
line on the ruble. This week, the government raised more than $1
billion in a debt sale that included one-week bills yielding just
under 40 percent. To service this debt, the government will have to
shift some resources that otherwise could have gone to keeping
pensioners fed and coal miners paid.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble is, the major alternative, a sharp depreciation of the
ruble, would also inflict a blow to the feeble Russian economy from
which it would not easily recover. With Russian banks and
enterprises owing roughly $30 billion on securities coming due in
the next year, Rudi Dornbusch of the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology reckons that letting the ruble go would ruin the banks.
</P>
<P>
   ``One way or another, Russia faces a big balance-sheet
problem,'' Dornbusch said: Either it will be devastated by high
interest rates, or debtors will face huge liabilities in dollars
they probably will not be able to repay.
</P>
<P>
   Dornbusch prefers the high-interest-rate devil he knows to the
collapse-of-the-ruble devil he doesn't. And that view will almost
certainly prevail for a while longer, since the West is apparently
committed to sustaining the exchange value of the ruble.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a lesson here, it is that short-term capital is no
friend to emerging economies. Russia's anarchic capitalism may have
little in common with the highly organized cronyism of Asia. But in
both cases, ``hot money'' has proved an Achilles' heel, magnifying
the impact of more fundamental institutional weaknesses and
immensely complicating rescue efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Genuine reforms, ranging from changes in the tax system to
application of the rule of law, are surely necessary to get the
Russian economy moving. As long as Russia depends on the good
opinion of international capital markets, though, those reforms may
not be sufficient.

   ESCHEDE, Germany _ A high-speed passenger train roaring through
northern Germany crashed into a concrete bridge pillar at 125 mph
Wednesday, spun from the tracks and killed at least 80 people,
possibly including children on a school excursion. Hundreds more
were injured.
</P>
<P>
   German Railways officials called it the worst crash in post-war
German history and the worst in Europe in decades. The crash
stunned Germany, which prides itself on the safety and speed of the
aerodynamic silver-and-red Inter-City-Express system.
</P>
<P>
   Rail officials said the final toll could exceed 100. Wednesday
night, huge cranes were still trying to lift debris from two
crushed railroad cars in which anyone still living, a medical
official said, had only a ``minimal'' chance of surviving.
</P>
<P>
   Inter-City-Express 884 crashed just south of the small station
in Eschede, a town of 6,000, 35 miles north of Hanover. As it
approached the station, on its 500-mile journey from Munich to
Hamburg, it had been right on time at 10:59 a.m. The bullet-nosed
locomotive pulling a 13-car train sped under a road-bridge as the
carriages behind it twisted out of control, according to accounts
by rescue workers, police and railway officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw nothing on the tracks as I went under the bridge,'' said
the driver, who survived unharmed. His name was not immediately
released. ``Then there was a vibration. Then the automatic brakes
came on,'' he told German television.
</P>
<P>
   The brakes came on, railway officials said, because the
locomotive had been severed from the rest of the 1,200-foot-long
train. It sped alone unscathed for hundreds of yards along the
tracks until it came to a halt. Only at that point, said Gisel
Lunig, an official investigator, did the driver realize what had
happened.
</P>
<P>
   The first two carriages immediately behind the locomotive seemed
to have remained crookedly on the tracks. But others behind them
careened over a leafy embankment, leaving their iron wheels in
place as the carriages sheared away.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the bridge came crashing down, burying two cars full of
people as five or six more cars folded together like playing-cards,
creating a sculpture of horror that rose up where the road-bridge
had once been.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a loud noise, like a helicopter, a crashing, and
then there were railway carriages in front of my door,'' said a
woman living near the tracks, who asked not to be identified by
name.
</P>
<P>
   Then, for a moment, all was quiet. ``There was the silence of
the dead,'' said Gerhard Bleyl, a former mineworker, who said he
was among the first to arrive at the wreck. ``Then we saw about 20
or 30 people who had managed to escape. Noone said anything. Then
we heard whimpering and screams.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There were legs, arms, from adults and children, men and
women,'' said one rescue worker who lives near the tracks and who
asked not to be identified by name.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could hear children crying for their mothers,'' said
Bleyl, whose home is also close to the tracks. ``This is the worst
thing I have ever seen,'' said a fire service officer, Andreas
Koch. ``It is the worst thing anyone has seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Seats and suitcases had been thrown clear of the train along
with splinters of metal and chunks of concrete from the bridge.
Some passengers smashed their way out of the windows.
</P>
<P>
   Railway officials and police said they believed two groups of
school-children may have been been aboard the train and were
possibly in the cars trapped under the debris of the collapsed
road-bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Medical workers set up a field-hospital to perform emergency
surgery on survivors while others were taken by helicopter to
hospitals in Hamburg, Hanover, Bremen and elsewhere. Hearses queued
to take the dead away.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, around 1,200 rescue workers _ both civilian and
military _ were drafted into the battle to locate survivors from
the 759-seat train. ``There was one woman. She was injured herself.
But all she could do was scream for her three-year-old child,''
said Barbel Joachim, a rescue helper, ``So I went to look for the
child and she was injured.''
</P>
<P>
   Railways officials and police originally said around 300 people
were injured in Wednesday's crash. By Wednesday evening, nine hours
after crash, German television said that more than 100 bodies had
been pulled from the wreckage, but police did not confirm this
figure.
</P>
<P>
   The ICE trains can travel at speeds of up 175 mph on special
tracks and routinely travel at 125 mph on the stretch where the
accident happened, railway officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The train is regarded as the safest in Germany,'' a German
Railways spokesman said. Since the ICE trains came into service in
1991, none of the 104 trains in the fleet had been involved in a
fatal accident, he said. The ICE trains have airline type seats,
restaurants and telephones.
</P>
<P>
   By Wednesday night, there was no clear explanation of why the
train had derailed and struck the central pillar supporting the
road-bridge. Police and railways officials said they could not
confirm early reports that a car atop the road-bridge had somehow
swerved through safety barriers to land on the tracks in the path
of the train or on the train itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as the cause of this accident is concerned, we are
still in the area of speculation,'' said Joachim Lindenberg, a
police spokesman. He confirmed, however, that the ruins of a car
had been found in the wreckage, but said it was unclear whether the
car finished up there after the bridge collapsed when the train
ploughed into it.
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl cut short a visit to Italy to return to
Germany. His challenger in September's election, Gerhard Schroder,
called off a political rally in Hanover. The authorities in Bonn
ordered that flags be flown at half-staff on public buildings. ``I
am lost for words to comfort the bereaved,'' Kohl said.
</P>
<P>
   The worst previous rail disaster in western Germany in the past
53 years was just after World War II when a U.S. transport train
loaded with tanks collided with a trainload of German war
prisoners. The disaster claimed 102 lives.
</P>
<P>
   Europe's worst rail crash in recent decades was in 1974 when a
train traveling from Belgrade to Germany derailed in Croatia,
killing 153 people

HISPANIC VOTE MAY DECIDE CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS, ANALYSTS SAY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CRAGG HINES 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Growing Hispanic political activism in California
could be decisive in key elections this year, analysts said
Wednesday after primaries moved Latino candidates into almost half
the statewide races.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're ready for a breakthrough,'' Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a
political scientist at Claremont Graduate University, said of the
fastest-growing segment of the California electorate. ``Whether or
not it will come is another question.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats especially are counting on Hispanic voters to help
them retake the California governorship after 16 years of
Republicans holding the top job in the nation's most populous
state.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans, aware they have alienated some Hispanics with
strong backing for ballot initiatives that have been labeled
anti-immigrant, promised a strong effort in the minority community.
</P>
<P>
   Leading the parties' efforts will be gubernatorial candidates
who emerged from the primary Tuesday: Democrat Gray Davis, the
lieutenant governor, and Republican Dan Lungren, the state attorney
general. They seek to succeed Republican Gov. Pete Wilson, who must
leave office because of term limits.
</P>
<P>
   Lungren, in a calculated public break with Wilson and other
Republicans leaders, and Davis opposed the anti-bilingual education
proposition that was overwhelmingly approved by voters Tuesday.
Proposition 227 would allow most students one year of intensive
English instruction before requiring a return to regular classes.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund said it
filed suit Wednesday in U.S. District Court in San Francisco
seeking to have the measure thrown out, contending it would deny
equal educational opportunity to English-deficient students.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic leaders Wednesday attacked Lungren for his support of
two earlier initiatives that have drawn the ire of Hispanics, the
1994 measure to deny almost all state services to illegal
immigrants and the 1996 proposition scuttling the state's
affirmative action program. Davis opposed both measures.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats hope they have a magnet for Hispanic voters in their
lieutenant governor nominee, Cruz Bustamante, the first Hispanic
speaker of the California Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Bustamante, whom operatives in both parties regard as an
effective campaigner, said Wednesday he would fight to ``keep my
party in the center _ where I think the heart of my party is.''
</P>
<P>
   Lungren countered by signaling he will try to portray Davis,
whose first governmental experience was as chief of staff to
Democratic Gov. Edmund G. ``Jerry'' Brown Jr. in the 1970s and 80s,
as a classic liberal.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, whose last political ventures were failed presidential
races, returned to elective life Tuesday, winning the mayor's race
in Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats outlined Lungren's ``troubles,'' leading off with his
opposition to abortion _ an issue that separates the Republican not
only from Davis but also from incumbent Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   In seeking to appeal to Hispanics, Republicans have turned to
San Mateo County Supervisor Ruben Barrales as their candidate for
state controller. Barrales is one of only three Hispanic
Republicans in California holding an office with a countywide or
larger constituency.
</P>
<P>
   Bustamante and Barrales are two of four Hispanics in the nine
major statewide races. Democrat Diane Martinez, daughter of Rep.
Matthew G. Martinez, D-Calif., is running for insurance
commissioner. Gloria Matta Tuchman, a Republican who supported the
anti-bilingual initiative, is challenging an incumbent Democrat who
opposed the measure, in a race for the post of superintendent of
public education.
</P>
<P>
   Only one Hispanic has made it to the statewide general election
ballot in modern California history, political operatives and
analysts said. Former state Sen. Art Torres, now the state
Democratic chairman, ran for insurance commissioner in 1994 but
lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't really have a history to go on'' of whether Latino
candidates draw fellow minorities to the polls, said Mark
Baldassare of the Public Policy Institute of California. ``This
ballot is going to be a real test of that issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Baldassare estimates that one in six California voters is
Hispanic, ``so they can definitely make the difference in a close
election _ which is what I expect in the gubernatorial and U.S.
Senate races.''
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. House contest in Orange County may serve to re-enforce
any Hispanic discontent with Republicans. The primary set up a
rematch of the bitter 1996 race between former GOP Rep. Robert
Dornan and the Democrat who defeated him two years ago, Rep.
Loretta Sanchez.
</P>
<P>
   In another U.S. House race of note, Republican Rep. Jay Kim, the
only Korean-American in Congress, became the first incumbent to be
defeated this year. Kim is currently under house arrest in
Washington on a campaign finance conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Matt Fong, the state treasurer, won the Republican
nomination to challenge Sen. Barbara Boxer.

SPRINT CORP. RAISES CURTAIN ON NEW TELECOMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TED SICKINGER  
 c. 1997 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sprint Corp. staged a full-scale Broadway production
this week to showcase technology that could radically change the
way telecommunications services are delivered, what they cost and
how customers are billed for them.
</P>
<P>
   The presentation _ featuring actors, a stage set and a
supporting cast of Sprint executives _ played to a full house of
securities analysts, corporate customers and reporters Tuesday at
the Richard Rodgers Theater.
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of the show was a radical new network design
that Sprint calls the Integrated On-demand Network, or ION.
</P>
<P>
   Basically it's a $2 billion upgrade to the company's fiberoptic
long-distance network. But more important, experts say, it's a
technological advance that could vault Sprint into the lucrative
market for local phone services and breathe new life into
futuristic communications services such as videoconferencing, video
on demand and ultrafast Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint released the outlines of the integrated network Monday.
In the Broadway presentation Tuesday, Sprint executives stressed
that the technology was not some pipe dream in a laboratory but was
set for delivery to businesses and consumers in the next year and a
half.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other companies may have bits and pieces of this,'' said
Sprint Chairman William T. Esrey, ``but only Sprint has it all. And
only Sprint has it now.''
</P>
<P>
   Sprint may be the first to the market with such a system,
analysts said, but other phone companies are working on similar
networks.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, Sprint intends to replace the current telephone
system, which relies on a 100-year-old technology of copper lines
and electronic switches, with a digital-age network that can handle
the exploding audio, video and data traffic generated by the
Internet, corporate intranets and wide-area networks.
</P>
<P>
   By modern standards, the existing system is a hugely inefficient
user of calling capacity. From the time you make a call to when you
hang up, the system opens a dedicated end-to-end circuit. And as
any frustrated Web surfer or parent of teen-agers can attest, while
that call is in progress, the line cannot be used for anything
else.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the tangled patchwork of facilities pieced together by
most large phone companies is full of traffic bottlenecks and being
rapidly overloaded by the demands of a digital age. The time needed
to send most audio and video over standard phone lines makes them
practically useless for those applications.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, Sprint intends to abandon dedicated-circuit
switching in favor of a vastly more efficient network that dices up
traffic into digital bits and bytes, sends them at light speed over
many parallel avenues to their destination and reassembles them
there.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint already operates one of the most efficient networks in
the business, a web of fiberoptic rings that it began building in
1984 and marketed for its ``pin drop'' call clarity.
</P>
<P>
   By overlaying high-speed switches, routers and proprietary
software, the company says, it can generate almost unlimited
capacity while reducing the cost of a long-distance call by up to
70 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The company also plans to extend its fiberoptic network to 60
cities by the end of 1999, which will allow it to bypass local
phone companies and push its high-tech services directly to
business and residential customers.
</P>
<P>
   The company plans to run its lines directly into most large
businesses. To provide high-speed service to smaller companies and
residential customers, it plans to employ cable modems, wireless
systems or technology that will allow it to send high-speed digital
signals over copper lines. That technology is known as XDSL.
</P>
<P>
   ``This announcement marks Sprint's entry into the local
market,'' said Ronald LeMay, the company's president. ``Where I
come from, that's called killing two birds with one stone.''
</P>
<P>
   To illustrate how the ION network will work, Sprint executives
compared it to an electric utility that delivered as much power _
or in this case communications bandwidth _ as a customer needed at
any moment, through a single connection.
</P>
<P>
   Residential customers would have to buy a $200 box that
allocates capacity and meters usage. Through the box, they would be
able to control their own bandwidth use, adding phone lines, fax
machines or Internet connections at will, just as they can switch
on lamps and run the dishwasher and a hair dryer at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   For example, people in the same household could simultaneously
conduct a videoconference, surf the Internet, download a video and
send a fax using the same line.
</P>
<P>
   Businesses, however, are slated to be the first customers for
high-bandwidth service, and the potential benefits are enormous.
Sprint's network promises to facilitate telecommuting, distance
learning for employees, real- time desktop collaboration and
electronic commerce. It could also alleviate the pressure on
businesses to maintain dedicated technical support staff to deal
with the endless problems on their networks.
</P>
<P>
   At Tuesday's presentation, actors on an elaborate stage
portrayed the contrast between the old and new phone systems as
envisioned by Sprint.
</P>
<P>
   In the first act, four members of a fictional family vied for
control of the single line running into their home, which resulted
in a high-volume family feud and a cacophonous systems crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you think that was bad, imagine what it's like at a
business,'' Esrey said as he stepped back into the footlights. That
led into a similar demonstration of pandemonium as three business
colleagues tried to collaborate on an on-line marketing
presentation.
</P>
<P>
   Both acts were followed by idyllic depictions of what would have
occurred had they been using the new network. MORE
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ the new network.
</P>
<P>
   The company also mounted several live demonstrations in which
employees put some prototype residential equipment through its
paces.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the realization that Sprint's famed guerrilla
marketers had reached their zenith in terms of corporate theater,
typically skeptical analysts and customers were impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the real deal,'' said Kenneth McGee, an industry
analyst with the Gartner Group. ``We think this vision is terrific.
It's clearly where every carrier has to head.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts also warned that Sprint would soon face competition
from other phone companies building similar networks.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Sprint still has a way to go before it totally realizes
its vision. It said it expected to spend about $400 million in the
next two years as it rolled out its network.
</P>
<P>
   The company and two strategic partners _ Bellcore and Cisco
Systems _ are still working on upgrades to the network and software
that will ensure reliability and functionality, which are critical
to persuade customers to adopt the service.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one thing to say you've entered the market, and another
for customers to believe it's safe to use the network,'' McGee
said.
</P>
<P>
   Another big hurdle that analysts foresee is Sprint's ability to
strike deals with local carriers to gain access to small-business
and residential customers using their copper lines. To do that,
Sprint must lease space in the local companies' switching centers
and install their own equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the amount of bandwidth that Sprint can provide to
some customers may be limited by the condition of the copper lines
that run to most homes and small businesses. In some cases, those
lines may be incapable of carrying high-speed service.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Brauer, president of Sprint's national integrated services
division, said the company was ``close to an agreement with a
couple of the regional Bell companies.''
</P>
<P>
   And, he said, the company's research shows that 70 percent of
households are capable of receiving some level of broadband
service. For those that aren't, he said, the company has other
options, including wireless technology or cable modems.
</P>
<P>
   One of the immediate effects of Sprint's move will be on the
$250 billion market for telephone equipment and software. By
abandoning a circuit-switched network, Sprint is pushing aside
traditional suppliers in favor of new partners.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the investment community has figured that out
yet,'' McGee said.

STEALTH TAX INCREASES DO LITTLE TO REFORM SOCIAL SECURITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: When The Kiplinger Washington Letter recently advised
its business clients to anticipate a boost of the Social Security
taxable wage base to as high as $71,700 next year, it raised a
question of why this method of increasing the payroll tax
continues.
</P>
<P>
   The question is pertinent because Social Security is overtaxing
Americans to no good purpose except to provide bigger and bigger
windfalls for Washington. A recent fund-raiser from United Seniors
Association Inc. sought support for proposed legislation that would
minimize Social Security's cash cow function. The letter estimated
that this year's payroll tax would generate $80 billion more than
is needed to fund benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The money, as usual, will be spent on general budget outlays and
Social Security's trust fund will get an IOU. While the public is
starting to become increasingly aware of this scam, the practice of
enhancing Social Security receipts by expanding Social Security's
taxable wage base remains largely overlooked. And even if there
were more awareness there probably wouldn't be all that much
breast-beating because these tax increases hit only the highest
wage-earners.
</P>
<P>
   That's not the point, though. While there may be a convincing
case to be made for removing the cap from Social Security's taxable
wage base, this is something apart from Washington's yearly
practice of milking more revenue at the margin to create more
spendable income.
</P>
<P>
   Those interested in true reform can claim a righteous cause only
if a substantial expansion of the taxable wage base is accompanied
by relief for taxpayers at the bottom rungs of the wage scale.
Social Security is the most regressive tax ever devised because of
the way it hits low-wage workers much harder than high-wage
workers.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, in theory at least, lack of means-testing means the
taxes of workers earning less than poverty-level wages could be
funding the benefits of millionaire Social Security recipients.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, the practice of expanding the taxable wage base each
year benefits nobody but Washington's big spenders because the
so-called trust fund doesn't exist except as markers issued by
Uncle Sam. Since excessive Social Security taxation was mandated in
the early 1980s to prevent the system's insolvency, the Treasury
has taken in about $630 billion in excess taxes and spent the
money.
</P>
<P>
   The wage base expansions aren't small potatoes, either. They
affect both employers and employees, and an increase next year to
$71,700 would be an increase of 40 percent for the wage base this
decade. For those lucky enough to have earned the maximum
throughout the 1990s, the combined employee-employer Social
Security tax bill has risen substantially.
</P>
<P>
   This might be defensible if Social Security needed the money,
but it doesn't because the system is overfunded.
</P>
<P>
   The point man for the bill being pushed by United Seniors is
Rep. Mark Neumann of Wisconsin, who seeks to force the Treasury to
invest Social Security's surpluses in real financial assets with
market value. The IOUs being deposited in the trust fund are
nonmarketable securities and thus have no practical value except as
a future claim on the Treasury.
</P>
<P>
   Both Neumann's reform and the efforts to privatize the system
are worthy goals, but the time has come to stop the annual stealth
tax increases imposed by automatic expansions of the taxable wage
base.

COMMENTARY: ENTER THE SUPREMES 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Next Monday, the Supreme Court _ acting swiftly,
even in a jam-packed June with more than 30 decisions to be handed
down _ will hear argument on whether a dead man can be forced to
tell his tale.
</P>
<P>
   It stems from the abuse of power known as (1) Travelgate. Just
before Vincent Foster committed suicide, he unburdened himself to
his lawyer, presumably including Hillary Rodham Clinton's role in
the firing and smearing of seven government employees.
</P>
<P>
   For two years, Ken Starr's grand jury has been trying to get the
three pages of notes taken that day by Foster's lawyer to make the
case that Hillary lied about this. The lawyer, James Hamilton,
argues that attorney-client confidentiality should continue after
the client's death.
</P>
<P>
   Although lawyers have often been examined about the intentions
of dead clients in wills, most people assume that what they tell
their lawyers remains privileged forever. So did a trial judge, but
an appeals court reversed, holding that death protected the client
from prosecution and the need to do justice outweighed the need for
confidentiality.
</P>
<P>
   This case is what learned counsel call a toughie, but that's why
we have a Supreme Court. As a privacy nut, I hope the justices
decide to extend the privilege beyond the grave _ but in criminal
cases, to allow a judge to examine a lawyer in camera to see if
such testimony is essential for a grand jury to do justice to the
living.
</P>
<P>
   The Supremes will not have to decide President Clinton's claim
of (2) executive privilege to shield his PR aide Sidney Blumenthal
because when Starr went eyeball-to-eyeball with the White House on
this, Clinton blinked. I think the president knew this claim on a
matter unrelated to national security was a loser all along, but
made it in lower court to run down the clock. Smart; it bought him
four months.
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal, lest we forget, may be Colson Revisited. Watergate
buffs will recall that Nixon counsel Charles Colson pled guilty to
disseminating derogatory information from Daniel Ellsberg's FBI
file to influence the outcome of the Pentagon Papers leaker's
trial.
</P>
<P>
   Especially coming from a federal official, such defamation was
obstruction of justice; Special Prosecutor Leon Jaworski wrote on
June 12, 1974, that Colson's Section 1503 conviction was ``of great
national significance in helping to insure the sanctity of the
judicial process with respect to cases involving controversial
defendants.'' I suspect Starr will charge that a defamation
conspiracy is obstruction whether aimed at defense or prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Though Clinton has fled the field at least temporarily on
stretching executive privilege, he hopes the Supremes will not take
action on (3) government attorney-client privilege, which he has
claimed to keep his notorious consigliere, Bruce Lindsey, from
testifying.
</P>
<P>
   Should the high court review this now, as Starr urges, or wait
till next year, thereby easing Clinton past the midterm elections?
The 8th Circuit Court of Appeals has already agreed with Starr in
deciding a similar case, ordering White House lawyers to testify
about two Hillary debriefings; the Supremes refused a Clinton plea
to review. Because the latest White House maneuver aims strictly to
delay, the court should sink its teeth into this ripe tomato
forthwith.
</P>
<P>
   And to be consistent, it should deal expeditiously with
Clinton's most egregious reach, bypassing the legislative branch to
assert a royal prerogative: (4) the see-no-evil bodyguard
privilege. The White House pretends to have nothing to do with the
claim that turns the Secret Service into the Silent Service _ as if
the Treasury Department, represented in this by Clinton Justice,
were independent of the executive branch.
</P>
<P>
   Bodyguards need to stick close to a president when he is in
crowds or in potential danger, not when he is in the Oval Office or
speaking tete-a-tete to an adviser or visitor who has been
electronically scanned. The notion that he would push away
protection while exposed in a crowd is ludicrous. The court should
tell the agents they can maintain their tradition of discretion
without seeking special privilege through judicial fiat.
</P>
<P>
   I realize all this burdens the justices in their busiest time,
but then they can hit the beaches until the first Monday in
October.

RUSSIAN BOND SALE JUDGED A MODERATE SUCCESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also RUSSIA-YELTSIN, RUSSIA-ECONSCENE) 
(th) 
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russia's unsteady economy survived a critical test
Wednesday as the government sold nearly $1 billion in treasury
bills without paying the colossal interest rates that the bonds
traded at just a week ago.
</P>
<P>
   Anxious foreign investors, fearing the treasury bill auction
would fail to draw enough investors, breathed a sign of relief.
While the auction did not raise all the money the government
sought, it was judged a moderate success. Stock prices rose in
Russia for a second day. A more skeptical bond market pushed prices
lower.
</P>
<P>
   Russia also sold $1.25 billion in long-term bonds, so-called
Eurobonds, to international investors mostly in Europe and the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday's auction also illustrated Russia's economic
predicament. Since the government did not raise all of the money it
needed to cover debts that are coming due it will be forced to dip
into its reserves.
</P>
<P>
   And the auction raised the question of how long Russia will be
able to stagger on without billions of dollars in additional
financing from the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have done well so far,'' said Al Breach, an economist at
the Russian-European Center for Economic Policy. ``But this has
been a very hairy week, and each week is going to be hairy until
investors have more confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Another 5.5 billion rubles in Treasury bills, or about $900
million, comes due next week. The following week treasury notes
worth another 8.1 billion rubles, or $1.3 billion, mature. That has
led many investors to argue that billions of dollars in additional
loans from the IMF and other international organizations are needed
to help Russia keep its currency stable and restructure the cost of
its short-term debt.
</P>
<P>
   In Wednesday's auction, the interest rates ranged from 40
percent to 54 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Russia depends on the sale of treasury bills to finance its huge
budget deficit, which last year was 6.1 percent of the country's
gross domestic product. The goal is to reduce the deficit to 5
percent of GDP this year through a combination of spending cuts and
tax increases.
</P>
<P>
   Reducing the deficit is a crucial goal because interest payments
on the debt amount to about a third of total spending, more than
double the level in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Russian government cannot carry on paying 50 percent
interest rates for a long period of time,'' said Breach. ``It will
kill the budget.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As Russia's financial markets have been pounded by the global
economic crisis, the Yeltsin government has been desperately trying
to reassure investors both at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Foreigners own about about a quarter of the treasury bills,
making Russia's financial stability vulnerable to the calculations
and whims of far-off investors who have a tendency to abandon a
distressed country just when the money is needed most.
</P>
<P>
   Russia had been making progress pushing down the interest rates
of the treasury bills when the currency crisis in Asia erupted. As
investors lost confidence in emerging markets, however, rates began
rising as they began cashing in Russian treasury bills for rubles.
</P>
<P>
   The investors had contracts with Russian banks that allowed them
to convert the rubles into dollars, creating a surplus of rubles
and weakening the value of the ruble value against the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's auction followed several failed attempts to raise
enough money to pay short-term maturing debt. The auction actually
involved three types of treasury bills known as GKOs: One type
matured in 343 days, another matured in 126 days and the third was
a seven-day bill, the shortest treasury bill Russia has ever
issued.
</P>
<P>
   To stir up demand, President Boris Yeltsin summoned Russia's 10
leading businessmen and financiers to the Kremlin on Tuesday and
told them they had a duty to invest in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   In selling the bills, the Finance Ministry was determined to
hold down its borrowing costs. It was operating on the expectation
that investors will soon regain confidence in the market or that
less costly interest rates will become available after the monetary
fund leads a bailout.
</P>
<P>
   It sold the seven-day bills with an average interest rate of 40
percent. The other bills had an average interest rate of 54
percent.
</P>
<P>
   While those rates are very high for an economy in which
inflation is running at about 11 percent or 12 percent, they are a
far cry from the 80 percent and 90 percent interest rates of last
week. They are even a bit lower than the interest rates paid
Tuesday by the secondary market in treasury securities.
</P>
<P>
   But holding down interest costs also meant that the Russian
government did not sell all the bills it offered. The Finance
Ministry, for example, was ready to sell 2.5 billion rubles worth
of seven-day bills. It sold half a billion rubles worth.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Wednesday's auction raised 5.83 billion rubles, or
about $950 million. That meant that the Finance Ministry had to dip
into its reserves to pay 2.58 billion rubles, or about $420
million, to redeem treasury bills that matured Wednesday. &QL;

BAHRAIN'S LEADER IN U.S. TO COURT INVESTORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ELAINE SCIOLINO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In his first visit to the United States in seven
years, the Emir of Bahrain came not to buy U.S. military hardware
or ask for more protection against Iraq's Saddam Hussein, but to
woo American investors. Quietly.
</P>
<P>
   That's because Sheik Isa bin Salman al-Khalifa doesn't like to
play rainmaker.
</P>
<P>
   The emir did not stop by New York's citadels of capitalism the
way Chinese President Jiang Zemin did last year, when he visited
the New York Stock Exchange and IBM. Instead, during his stopover
in New York, the emir chose to recover from jet lag and meet
privately with the U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
   The man who has been Bahrain's monarch for 36 years did not give
one speech, grant one interview or hold one news conference during
his stay.
</P>
<P>
   Bahrain has loyally acted as host to the U.S. Navy's 5th Fleet
for decades and even accepted more U.S. troops and equipment during
the recent crisis with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   But the emir did not demand a state dinner, with flags flying
along Pennsylvania Avenue and a 21-gun salute on the White House
lawn, as a payoff. He settled for the less lofty ``official'' visit
instead, which at least gave him lodging at Blair House, the
official residence across the street from the White House.
</P>
<P>
   For most countries, the art of commercial diplomacy is to get
out and tell your story. And if Bahrain had more oil, perhaps the
emir's reticence wouldn't make much of a difference.
</P>
<P>
   But Bahrain is the smallest, the least wealthy and the most
densely populated of the six monarchies on the Persian Gulf.
Seventy percent of its population is under the age of 27.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years it has survived by building itself up as a
service-based economy, the banking center of the Persian Gulf and
an oasis for Saudi-based Westerners who can drive across the
causeway from Saudi Arabia to relax and drink alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   Now it wants to diversify beyond oil and aluminum.
</P>
<P>
   So why not tell your story?
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with the Bahrainis is that they just don't have
the PR gene,'' said an American businessman with long ties to the
country. ``They don't understand how to project their image. Poor
guys.''
</P>
<P>
   The emir did rub shoulders with corporate America at a dinner
given by six corporations _ Caltex, Turner Broadcasting System
Inc., Lockheed Martin, Citibank, Chevron and Leo Daly _ at the Four
Seasons Hotel on Monday night. He made a few opening remarks, but
left it to his finance minister to give a speech on why Bahrain is
such a good place for American investors.

<P>
   ASMARA, Eritrea _ Heavy fighting broke out early Wednesday
morning between Ethiopian and Eritrean troops along the common
border of their two countries, dealing a serious blow to diplomatic
efforts to avert a full-scale war between the former allies,
Eritrean officials and witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   Eritrea said the Ethiopian troops crossed the border and mounted
an attack at 5:30 a.m. on Eritrean positions in the Ambesete Geleba
region just west of the border town of Zala Ambessa, about 60 miles
southeast of this capital.
</P>
<P>
   The Ethiopian troops used tanks and heavy artillery in the
assault, a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry, Amdemicael Kahasai,
said. The fighting continued into the late afternoon, but by
nightfall the guns where silent, Eritrean officials said. No
casualty figures were available, and it was unclear where the
battle lines stood.
</P>
<P>
   ``This attack represents a new and dangerous escalation of the
crisis between Eritrea and Ethiopia,'' Amdemicael said.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate confirmation of the fighting from the
Ethiopian government. Instead, the Ethiopian Foreign Ministry
issued a statement saying Eritrean forces had tried once again to
take the towns of Alitena and Ayga, which lie about 15 miles west
of Zala Ambessa and were the focus of another clash last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The fighting has dampened hopes for a peaceful settlement to the
crisis, diplomats said. An American team of diplomats who were
trying to bring the two sides to the negotiating table remained in
the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The two countries had been close allies since Eritrea became
independent in 1993, but until recently they had disagreed
peacefully about their common border.
</P>
<P>
   Ethiopia asserts that it has jurisdiction over a number of areas
that used to be part of the Ethiopian administrative province of
Tigray, but Eritrea claims those regions are now within its
territory and has cited turn-of-the-century treaties between the
Italian colonizers and the Ethiopian emperor as proof of their
claims.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute turned violent on May 6 when Eritrean troops clashed
with Ethiopian forces near the border town of Badame, about 90
miles southwest of Asmara. Both sides accuse the other side of
invading.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, both governments have sent tens of thousands of
soldiers, backed by tanks and artillery, into the disputed regions,
while American diplomats and regional leaders have shuttled between
the capitals in an attempt to find a peaceful solution to the
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   But Ethiopia has insisted that Eritrea withdraw its troops from
what it considers Ethiopian territory before talks can begin.
Eritrea has refused to withdraw, asserting that its soldiers had
never crossed what it says is the border.
</P>
<P>
   Eritrea has also said its troops in Badame only took back land
the Ethiopians had occupied last year. For more than nine months,
Eritrean officials said, Ethiopian officials in Tigray have tried
to extend their influence northward by sending settlers into the
Eritrean territory and setting up administrations.
</P>
<P>
   A full-scale conflict would be disastrous not only for the two
countries, which are still trying to rebuild after decades of civil
war, but also for the stability of the entire region, diplomats
say.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Wednesday, Amdemicael said the clash was
the fifth occasion in the last week that Ethiopian troops had
attacked Eritrean positions along the border.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Three of these attacks, he said, took place in the region around
Badame last week. The most recent occurred on Sunday near the town
of Alitena, about 15 miles east of Wednesday's fighting.
</P>
<P>
   In Sunday's clash, Ethiopian officials say Eritrean troops
crossed the border and fought Ethiopian militiamen at the town of
Dal Geda. The militia later withdrew. Ethiopian troops then engaged
the Eritreans and pushed them back into Eritrea, these officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Eritrea's version of the clash near Alitena is radically
different. Eritrean military officials deny invading Ethiopia and
maintain it was the Ethiopian troops who penetrated nearly 12 miles
into Eritrean territory.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the renewed fighting Wednesday, Amdemicael said Eritrea
remained committed to finding a peaceful solution. He said Eritrea
is still calling for both countries to pull their troops back from
the border and create a demilitarized zone. Eritrea has also called
for a third country or for the United Nations to arbitrate the
dispute and demarcate the border once and for all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, the Ethiopian government persists in its
intransigent position of launching a full-scale war unless Eritrea
withdraws unconditionally from territories that are indisputably
Eritrean,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews this week, Ethiopian officials said the Eritrean
actions around Badame and Sheraro amounted to an invasion and that
to start negotiations before Eritrean troops withdraw would be to
surrender Ethiopian sovereignty over the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless you draw the line here, nobody will be able to know
what the Eritreans might do tomorrow,'' the deputy foreign minister
of Ethiopia, Tekeda Alemu, said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Eritrea has a regular army of about 35,000 men, most of them
battle-hardened veterans from the 30-year war for independence that
ended in 1991 with the defeat of Ethiopia's Marxist dictator,
Mengistu Haile Mariam. In recent days, it has also called up at
least 10,000 reservists, many of them former guerrillas, and sent
them to the frontier.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, Ethiopia has about 120,000 men under arms, though
it is unclear how many of them are in Tigray. Many of the top
commanders and enlisted men in the Ethiopian army are former rebels
from the Tigray region who fought hand in hand with the Eritrean
rebels to overthrow Mengistu. Some were even trained by the
Eritrean rebel movement that now controls the country.
</P>
<P>
   Both armies have experience fighting conventional battles in the
region they are now fighting over, military experts said. Both have
artillery and tanks as well as small air forces.
</P>
<P>
   In the Eritrean capital Wednesday, the mood was muted as news of
the fighting spread through town. Many people said they cannot
believe the border dispute is on the verge of exploding into
another war, yet many also expressed a grim determination to defend
their territory whatever the cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fighting is no solution,'' said one taxi driver, Habte
Frezghy, who is a former rebel. ``They need to sit down at the
table and talk.''

Wednesday morning, sitting in the third row at Trinity Episcopal
Cathedral in Phoenix, watching working men and woman walk slowly
past the casket of Barry Goldwater, some of them stopping, some of
them reaching out to touch the flag-covered coffin, gently, the way
a parent touches a sleeping child. There was no choice. Any hack

   NEW YORK _ the new network.
</P>
<P>
   The company also mounted several live demonstrations in which
employees put some prototype residential equipment through its
paces.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the realization that Sprint's famed guerrilla
marketers had reached their zenith in terms of corporate theater,
typically skeptical analysts and customers were impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the real deal,'' said Kenneth McGee, an industry
analyst with the Gartner Group. ``We think this vision is terrific.
It's clearly where every carrier has to head.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts also warned that Sprint would soon face competition
from other phone companies building similar networks.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Sprint still has a way to go before it totally realizes
its vision. It said it expected to spend about $400 million in the
next two years as it rolled out its network.
</P>
<P>
   The company and two strategic partners _ Bellcore and Cisco
Systems _ are still working on upgrades to the network and software
that will ensure reliability and functionality, which are critical
to persuade customers to adopt the service.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one thing to say you've entered the market, and another
for customers to believe it's safe to use the network,'' McGee
said.
</P>
<P>
   Another big hurdle that analysts foresee is Sprint's ability to
strike deals with local carriers to gain access to small-business
and residential customers using their copper lines. To do that,
Sprint must lease space in the local companies' switching centers
and install their own equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the amount of bandwidth that Sprint can provide to
some customers may be limited by the condition of the copper lines
that run to most homes and small businesses. In some cases, those
lines may be incapable of carrying high-speed service.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Brauer, president of Sprint's national integrated services
division, said the company was ``close to an agreement with a
couple of the regional Bell companies.''
</P>
<P>
   And, he said, the company's research shows that 70 percent of
households are capable of receiving some level of broadband
service. For those that aren't, he said, the company has other
options, including wireless technology or cable modems.
</P>
<P>
   One of the immediate effects of Sprint's move will be on the
$250 billion market for telephone equipment and software. By
abandoning a circuit-switched network, Sprint is pushing aside
traditional suppliers in favor of new partners.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the investment community has figured that out
yet,'' McGee said.

SPRINT CORP. RAISES CURTAIN ON NEW TELECOMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TED SICKINGER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sprint Corp. staged a full-scale Broadway production
this week to showcase technology that could radically change the
way telecommunications services are delivered, what they cost and
how customers are billed for them.
</P>
<P>
   The presentation _ featuring actors, a stage set and a
supporting cast of Sprint executives _ played to a full house of
securities analysts, corporate customers and reporters Tuesday at
the Richard Rodgers Theater.
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of the show was a radical new network design
that Sprint calls the Integrated On-demand Network, or ION.
</P>
<P>
   Basically it's a $2 billion upgrade to the company's fiberoptic
long-distance network. But more important, experts say, it's a
technological advance that could vault Sprint into the lucrative
market for local phone services and breathe new life into
futuristic communications services such as videoconferencing, video
on demand and ultrafast Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint released the outlines of the integrated network Monday.
In the Broadway presentation Tuesday, Sprint executives stressed
that the technology was not some pipe dream in a laboratory but was
set for delivery to businesses and consumers in the next year and a
half.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other companies may have bits and pieces of this,'' said
Sprint Chairman William T. Esrey, ``but only Sprint has it all. And
only Sprint has it now.''
</P>
<P>
   Sprint may be the first to the market with such a system,
analysts said, but other phone companies are working on similar
networks.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, Sprint intends to replace the current telephone
system, which relies on a 100-year-old technology of copper lines
and electronic switches, with a digital-age network that can handle
the exploding audio, video and data traffic generated by the
Internet, corporate intranets and wide-area networks.
</P>
<P>
   By modern standards, the existing system is a hugely inefficient
user of calling capacity. From the time you make a call to when you
hang up, the system opens a dedicated end-to-end circuit. And as
any frustrated Web surfer or parent of teen-agers can attest, while
that call is in progress, the line cannot be used for anything
else.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the tangled patchwork of facilities pieced together by
most large phone companies is full of traffic bottlenecks and being
rapidly overloaded by the demands of a digital age. The time needed
to send most audio and video over standard phone lines makes them
practically useless for those applications.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, Sprint intends to abandon dedicated-circuit
switching in favor of a vastly more efficient network that dices up
traffic into digital bits and bytes, sends them at light speed over
many parallel avenues to their destination and reassembles them
there.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint already operates one of the most efficient networks in
the business, a web of fiberoptic rings that it began building in
1984 and marketed for its ``pin drop'' call clarity.
</P>
<P>
   By overlaying high-speed switches, routers and proprietary
software, the company says, it can generate almost unlimited
capacity while reducing the cost of a long-distance call by up to
70 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The company also plans to extend its fiberoptic network to 60
cities by the end of 1999, which will allow it to bypass local
phone companies and push its high-tech services directly to
business and residential customers.
</P>
<P>
   The company plans to run its lines directly into most large
businesses. To provide high-speed service to smaller companies and
residential customers, it plans to employ cable modems, wireless
systems or technology that will allow it to send high-speed digital
signals over copper lines. That technology is known as XDSL.
</P>
<P>
   ``This announcement marks Sprint's entry into the local
market,'' said Ronald LeMay, the company's president. ``Where I
come from, that's called killing two birds with one stone.''
</P>
<P>
   To illustrate how the ION network will work, Sprint executives
compared it to an electric utility that delivered as much power _
or in this case communications bandwidth _ as a customer needed at
any moment, through a single connection.
</P>
<P>
   Residential customers would have to buy a $200 box that
allocates capacity and meters usage. Through the box, they would be
able to control their own bandwidth use, adding phone lines, fax
machines or Internet connections at will, just as they can switch
on lamps and run the dishwasher and a hair dryer at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   For example, people in the same household could simultaneously
conduct a videoconference, surf the Internet, download a video and
send a fax using the same line.
</P>
<P>
   Businesses, however, are slated to be the first customers for
high-bandwidth service, and the potential benefits are enormous.
Sprint's network promises to facilitate telecommuting, distance
learning for employees, real- time desktop collaboration and
electronic commerce. It could also alleviate the pressure on
businesses to maintain dedicated technical support staff to deal
with the endless problems on their networks.
</P>
<P>
   At Tuesday's presentation, actors on an elaborate stage
portrayed the contrast between the old and new phone systems as
envisioned by Sprint.
</P>
<P>
   In the first act, four members of a fictional family vied for
control of the single line running into their home, which resulted
in a high-volume family feud and a cacophonous systems crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you think that was bad, imagine what it's like at a
business,'' Esrey said as he stepped back into the footlights. That
led into a similar demonstration of pandemonium as three business
colleagues tried to collaborate on an on-line marketing
presentation.
</P>
<P>
   Both acts were followed by idyllic depictions of what would have
occurred had they been using the new network. MORE

STEALTH TAX INCREASES DO LITTLE TO REFORM SOCIAL SECURITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: When The Kiplinger Washington Letter recently advised
its business clients to anticipate a boost of the Social Security
taxable wage base to as high as $71,700 next year, it raised a
question of why this method of increasing the payroll tax
continues.
</P>
<P>
   The question is pertinent because Social Security is overtaxing
Americans to no good purpose except to provide bigger and bigger
windfalls for Washington. A recent fund-raiser from United Seniors
Association Inc. sought support for proposed legislation that would
minimize Social Security's cash cow function. The letter estimated
that this year's payroll tax would generate $80 billion more than
is needed to fund benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The money, as usual, will be spent on general budget outlays and
Social Security's trust fund will get an IOU. While the public is
starting to become increasingly aware of this scam, the practice of
enhancing Social Security receipts by expanding Social Security's
taxable wage base remains largely overlooked. And even if there
were more awareness there probably wouldn't be all that much
breast-beating because these tax increases hit only the highest
wage-earners.
</P>
<P>
   That's not the point, though. While there may be a convincing
case to be made for removing the cap from Social Security's taxable
wage base, this is something apart from Washington's yearly
practice of milking more revenue at the margin to create more
spendable income.
</P>
<P>
   Those interested in true reform can claim a righteous cause only
if a substantial expansion of the taxable wage base is accompanied
by relief for taxpayers at the bottom rungs of the wage scale.
Social Security is the most regressive tax ever devised because of
the way it hits low-wage workers much harder than high-wage
workers.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, in theory at least, lack of means-testing means the
taxes of workers earning less than poverty-level wages could be
funding the benefits of millionaire Social Security recipients.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, the practice of expanding the taxable wage base each
year benefits nobody but Washington's big spenders because the
so-called trust fund doesn't exist except as markers issued by
Uncle Sam. Since excessive Social Security taxation was mandated in
the early 1980s to prevent the system's insolvency, the Treasury
has taken in about $630 billion in excess taxes and spent the
money.
</P>
<P>
   The wage base expansions aren't small potatoes, either. They
affect both employers and employees, and an increase next year to
$71,700 would be an increase of 40 percent for the wage base this
decade. For those lucky enough to have earned the maximum
throughout the 1990s, the combined employee-employer Social
Security tax bill has risen substantially.
</P>
<P>
   This might be defensible if Social Security needed the money,
but it doesn't because the system is overfunded.
</P>
<P>
   The point man for the bill being pushed by United Seniors is
Rep. Mark Neumann of Wisconsin, who seeks to force the Treasury to
invest Social Security's surpluses in real financial assets with
market value. The IOUs being deposited in the trust fund are
nonmarketable securities and thus have no practical value except as
a future claim on the Treasury.
</P>
<P>
   Both Neumann's reform and the efforts to privatize the system
are worthy goals, but the time has come to stop the annual stealth
tax increases imposed by automatic expansions of the taxable wage
base.

   PALMA, Majorca _ After sunset on a balmy evening in May,
Salvatore Paradore prepared for another profitable night's fishing
and launched his huge nets from the stern of the B. Colleoni into
the Mediterranean. There was no wind, little moonlight and no doubt
in the mind of the Italian skipper that soon he would haul in
plenty of swordfish and tuna.
</P>
<P>
   But luck ran out for the trawler from Sicily.
</P>
<P>
   At the crack of dawn, a Spanish Navy vessel pulled alongside,
detained the trawler and escorted it to a Spanish port. Paradore
and his crew were held in custody aboard their vessel and accused
of using illegal drift nets. Their gear and fish were confiscated.
</P>
<P>
   The Spanish authorities said the boat was one of hundreds still
using enormous drift nets although nets longer than 1.5 miles are
banned worldwide because of their devastating effect on marine
ecology.
</P>
<P>
   Set out at night, the nets form a nylon wall in the water
anywhere from 2 to 20 miles long and up to 50 feet deep, and allow
a small crew to harvest tons of fish. But scientists and government
officials have called the nets ``walls of death'' because they trap
many species the fishermen do not want and every year kill
thousands of seabirds and protected creatures like seals, dolphins
and whales.
</P>
<P>
   The United States led a drive in the United Nations to ban the
large drift nets and applied enormous pressure on Asian users,
mainly Japan, Taiwan and South Korea, until they agreed to give
them up. The ban took effect on June 30, 1992. But six years later
the practice continues in much of the Mediterranean and parts of
the Atlantic Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those nets are a menace, not just for the animals but also for
the other boats that can't see them,'' said Jaime Grimalt, director
of fisheries on the island of Majorca. Spain abolished its own
drift nets but foreign trawlers often come into the rich fishing
grounds off the Balearic Islands, which at this time of year are
brimming with yachts and sports fishermen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boatmen are scared because those nets cause a lot of
accidents,'' Grimalt said. ``Propellers get tangled up in them and
then boats have to be towed ashore.''
</P>
<P>
   The capture of the B. Colleoni on May 17 and of a second Italian
boat in Spanish waters on May 20 has drawn attention to the
continuing defiance of the ban.
</P>
<P>
   By law, the U.S. government must apply trade sanctions against
countries using the banned nets. For the last three years, the
State and Commerce departments have quietly put pressure on Italy
but have preferred to avoid a confrontation that could mean a
boycott of fish-related Italian exports. A State Department
fisheries expert said that Italy had plans to scrap the illegal
nets and that there had not been enough ``credible evidence'' to
recommend sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   European Union officials say Italy is by far the worst offender
against the U.N. ban, which also became law in the European Union.
Italy has some 650 trawlers using drift nets, they say, many of
them of illegal length. Every summer for the last decade the
trawlers have fanned out across the Mediterranean to hunt for the
profitable swordfish and bluefin tuna.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 boats from Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia with
illegal nets plow the rich fishing grounds off North Africa,
although the governments deny this. About a dozen vessels from
Britain and Ireland and about 40 from France use drift nets of both
legal and illegal length in the Atlantic, European Union officials
say.
</P>
<P>
   The main problem, they say, is that many boat owners can ignore
the 1.5-mile limit on nets because government monitoring is poor.
And plans of several governments to scrap the nets, convert the
vessels and pension off the oldest fishermen have been slow to be
carried out.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, several European governments now want all drift
nets banned, even the short, legal kind. But France, Italy and
Ireland have been trying to block the move. Fisheries Ministers of
15 European countries are expected to discuss the issue on June 8.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see these nets as such a threat to the fish stock and the
marine mammals that we have proposed a total ban,'' Filippo di
Robilant, spokesman for the European Commissioner for Fisheries in
Brussels, said, adding that some nets still in use were up to 20
miles long. ``We have to decide now if we want rules to conserve
our resources or if we want the law of the jungle.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   This kind of argument angers Paradore and his five-man crew from
Messina, Sicily, who were intercepted in Spanish waters and
detained in the port of Palma. Aboard their 75-foot vessel, they
said they were waiting for a bank transfer to pay the bail of close
to $27,500. Spanish authorities who confiscated the boat's nets
said they were close to five miles long, three times the permitted
size.
</P>
<P>
   Paradore said he had cut the five-mile net into three, each one
of a legal size, but Spanish authorities said this trick was not
acceptable. Pacing the deck and venting his frustrations, the
skipper went on:
</P>
<P>
   ``We worked like crazy, and now we are ruined. Fishing is one of
the oldest professions. Now it's suddenly a crime. It's not drift
nets that ruin the sea. It's the industries and the cities with
their pollution.''
</P>
<P>
   The fishermen showed disdain for people who fussed about
endangered animals like dolphins. ``There are thousands of dolphins
everywhere,'' Paradore said. ``They are the plague of the fishermen
because they eat all the fish.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts say they do not know how many turtles, seals or
cetaceans like whales, dolphins and porpoises live in the
Mediterranean or what proportion are killed. Biologists who record
large animals washed ashore say that in the western part of the sea
they find several hundred a year, often with pieces of nets still
caught over their heads or tails. The mammals that need to come up
for air are most vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once they get entangled, they can easily drown,'' said
Assumpta Gual, a biologist who has monitored fishing for
Greenpeace, the environmental organization.
</P>
<P>
   More is known about the Bay of Biscay, a coveted fishing ground
in the Atlantic. The French government ordered a study of the
impact of about 40 French vessels that were using drift nets four
to eight miles long. Observers found that between June and
September of 1993 the vessels caught 85 percent albacore tuna,
which was their target species. Their unwanted catch included 1,700
dolphins and 80,000 blue sharks.
</P>
<P>
   Loic Antoine, a government biologist who took part in the study,
said the dolphins killed represented about 1.5 percent of the
area's dolphins. ``That is not a high mortality rate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Those results are one reason why the French government is
against the European proposal to ban even short drift nets for the
French vessels. ``They represent about 1,000 jobs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Italy, many more jobs are at stake. Giuseppe Ambrosio,
director of fisheries in Rome, said that about two-thirds of
Italian boat owners using drift nets had said they would be willing
to convert to different technology with the help of government
grants. The program has been discussed for several years, but has
not yet started.
</P>
<P>
   Ambrosio conceded that overfishing of swordfish was indeed a
problem. But he said Italian violations of the drift-net ban were
few because the government was inspecting the boats. This
contrasted starkly with reports from Greenpeace, which used
surveillance aircraft and ships during its most recent campaign
against drift netting and in May reported 14 Italian vessels using
illegal nets to Italy's port authorities.
</P>
<P>
   As the region's fishermen come under pressure, a new problem may
loom. European Union officials are following tips that Spanish
fishermen have sold their banned nets to Moroccans. And they are
investigating reports that Italian skippers are applying for
licenses in Albania and Croatia.

COMMENTARY: THE SKY DIDN'T FALL 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By BOB HERBERT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Finally the benefits of the nation's long-running economic
expansion are reaching the folks at the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   It was an article of faith not too long ago that an unemployment
rate of 6 percent or less was bad news, a harbinger of runaway
inflation and all the ills that accompany it. (Not surprisingly,
this was never a doctrine advanced by the unemployed. It was a
belief most fervently held by well-fed professors with tenure.)
</P>
<P>
   Well, in April the jobless rate fell to 4.3 percent, the lowest
level in nearly three decades, and the sky hasn't fallen with it.
The numbers for May are not yet out, but over the past year or two
there has been reasonably good news across the board for low-wage
workers, and without a hint of accelerating inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Jared Bernstein, an economist with the Economic Policy Institute
in Washington, noted that from 1996 to 1997 the hourly wages of the
bottom 20 percent of workers increased by 3.2 percent in real
terms. That compared with a 1.5 percent increase in the top 20
percent of wage and salary workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's an example not only of strong wage growth, but stronger
at the bottom than at the top,'' said Bernstein. ``You couldn't
find a 3.2 percent increase at any point in this recovery for
workers at the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   ``That said, these workers are in such a deep hole that these
conditions would have to persist for a long time if they ever hope
to make up their two decades of wage declines.''
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein and others have cited three principal reasons for the
recent wage growth: tight labor markets, continued low inflation
and increases in the minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, when Bob Dole was running for president, it was
an article of faith among conservative Republicans that an increase
in the minimum wage would result in job losses for low-wage
workers. According to this doctrine, large numbers of employers
would rather let workers go than give them a modest raise.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Armey, the House majority leader and holder of a Ph.D. in
economics, denounced the Democratic proposal to hike the minimum
wage by 90 cents an hour as ``a cruel hoax on the least-advantaged
workers in the system.'' He said the minimum wage should be
abolished.
</P>
<P>
   William Niskanen, chairman of the conservative Cato Institute,
told a House committee, ``It is hard to explain the continued
support for increasing the minimum wage by those interested in
helping the working poor.''
</P>
<P>
   Return with us now to reality. Bernstein is the co-author, with
John Schmitt, of a rigorous study of the impact of the 1996-97
minimum wage increase. It found that the increase raised the wages
of nearly 10 million workers, most of them adults and more than
half of them women, without causing job loss.
</P>
<P>
   The study said: ``The benefits of the increase
disproportionately help those working households at the bottom of
the income scale. Although households in the bottom 20 percent
(whose average income was $15,728 in 1996) received only 5 percent
of total national income, 35 percent of the benefits from the
minimum wage increase went to these workers. In this regard, the
increase had the intended effect of raising the earnings and
incomes of low-wage workers and their households.''
</P>
<P>
   I am still waiting for Armey, Niskanen and their brethren to
explain how this is a bad thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited about the way things are lining up,'' Bernstein
said. He noted that even the groups facing the most difficult
employment hurdles, including young and less-well-educated
African-Americans, are experiencing some improvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``A 20 percent unemployment rate is still a Depression-level
number,'' he said. ``But it's better than 25 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   The challenge now is to keep the economy moving in a way that
benefits everyone, not just those at the top. It won't be easy.
When the April unemployment numbers were released, the inflation
hawks got their usual jitters. Was it time to raise interest rates
and curb this spreading prosperity? Were workers making 10 or 15
grand a year becoming a threat to the nation's millionaires?
Wouldn't it be prudent, at least, to jack up the jobless rate?
</P>
<P>
   Stay tuned.

WHY CIENA AGREED TO THE TELLABS DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (dc) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just as Ciena Corp. was announcing Wednesday that it had agreed
to be acquired by Tellabs Inc. for about $7.1 billion in stock,
Lucent Technologies Inc. was illustrating why Ciena saw little
future in remaining independent.
</P>
<P>
   Ciena had an early lead on Lucent _ and the rest of the
telecommunications industry _ in making a complex type of equipment
that can increase the capacity of long-distance networks by a
factor of 16 or more.
</P>
<P>
   But Lucent has made great strides closing the gap, and Wednesday
Lucent announced a trial in which Microsoft Corp. had agreed to
outfit its internal network with Lucent's version of the sort of
equipment made by Ciena.
</P>
<P>
   By itself, Lucent's announcement was not all that significant.
But set against the backdrop of Ciena's acquisition by Tellabs, it
served as a demonstration of the market power of Lucent, the former
unit of the AT&AMP;T Corp. that is North America's largest maker of
telecommunications equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition was another reminder that in the high-technology
world even the highest sorts of technology can fail to provide a
long-term business foundation. Ciena has good technology, but it
does not have the solid relationships with big customers that
companies like Lucent and Tellabs enjoy. In a market where big
telecommunications carriers want to focus on a handful of big
suppliers, Ciena was starting to feel like doors were closing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The suppliers are limited in companies like Bell Atlantic and
Ameritech and SBC,'' said Patrick Nettles, Ciena's chief executive,
referring to three of the local phone carriers. Explaining part of
the reason why Tellabs was an attractive suitor, he added, ``Having
existing relationships there can certainly truncate the process of
product acceptance.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucent is strong in the relationships department, especially
with other former members of the AT&AMP;T family. Like Lucent, the five
Bells were once part of AT&AMP;T. When Microsoft turned to U S West for
some new technology, U S West turned to Lucent.
</P>
<P>
   Tellabs is less than 5 percent of Lucent's size, with $1.2
billion in revenue last year compared with Lucent's $26.4 billion.
But as a company that has been in business since 1975, Tellabs does
have a track record, and it does have established relations with
the regional Bells, also known as RBOCs.
</P>
<P>
   Tellabs' main product, called a digital cross-connect, allows
many circuits to communicate with one another without being
soldered together.
</P>
<P>
   For Ciena, the deal ``is a recognition that a lot of incumbent
carriers, like the RBOCs, are going to take a more evolutionary
route which requires working very closely with companies like
Tellabs,'' said Steven D. Levy, a networking analyst for Salomon
Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   One reason relations with the Bells are beginning to matter to
Ciena is that the gear that Ciena makes, known as wave division
multiplexing, or WDM, equipment, is beginning to find its way from
the long-distance market into local networks.
</P>
<P>
   As local phone companies begin to offer high-speed data services
to consumers, they need to beef up their systems _ hopefully
without having to rip up streets to lay new cables. WDM is well
suited for that, but Ciena is facing the expensive prospect of
revamping many of its products for use in the local market. Tellabs
could also help Ciena's future product development.
</P>
<P>
   Tellabs tried to catch up in WDM on its own, but, ``we began to
realize that we were a little bit too little and a little bit too
late,'' said Michael Birck, who will remain Tellabs' chief
executive. Nettles will be named president.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the deal, Ciena's shareholders will receive
one share of Tellabs stock for each share of Ciena. Tellabs' shares
closed at $65.875, up 6.25 cents, in Nasdaq trading on Tuesday,
before reports of the deal emerged; Wednesday, the stock ended at
$63.8125, down $2.0625. Ciena's shares closed at $57.5625 on
Tuesday after a run-up of $6.1875 on takeover speculation;
Wednesday, its share price closed at $61.75, up $4.1875.
</P>
<P>
   Tellabs wants to treat the deal as a pooling of interests, which
would allow Tellabs to avoid having to take charges against its
future earnings to cover the difference between what it is paying
for Ciena and the assessed value of Ciena's assets. The companies
expect to complete the deal in the third quarter, after Tellabs
finishes another planned acquisition _ that of Coherent
Communications Systems Corp., a maker of equipment that enhances
sound quality on telecommunications networks, for $670 million.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco Systems Inc., which has a marketing arrangement with
Ciena, was left out in the cold by Wednesday's deal, though Cisco
could mount a run of its own for Ciena. After digesting Coherent
and Ciena, Tellabs could make bids for Ascend Communications Inc.
or Advanced Fibre Communications Inc., people on Wall Street said.

SCHOOL SHOOTINGS PROMPT A LOOK AT STATISTICS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
GRACIE BONDS STAPLES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We had barely gotten over the carnage in Jonesboro, Ark., when a
young gunman sprayed a high school cafeteria with a barrage of
bullets in Springfield, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   When he was done, 24 students had been hit. Two died. Police
have accused 15-year-old Kipland Kinkel of killing those students,
and his parents, who were shot earlier.
</P>
<P>
   And so the speculation begins anew. What is this world coming
to? Why are kids so violent? And why aren't we doing a better job
of socializing them?
</P>
<P>
   But despite what appears to be a wide and growing tide of
violent juvenile crime, statistics show declines at the local,
state and national levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are horrible events that shock us, and should shock
us,'' said Alfred Blumstein, professor of operations research and
public policy at John Heinz School of Public Policy and Management
at Carnegie Mellon University. ``But a few incidences a year,
however distressing, are still short of a tide.''
</P>
<P>
   A study released in January by the Texas Criminal Justice Policy
Council bears that out, showing a significant drop in violent
juvenile crime.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, violent and weapons offenses by Texas juveniles dropped
12 percent, despite a 1.4 percent rise in the juvenile population.
</P>
<P>
   And in May, the Department of Public Safety reported a 2.4
percent drop in juvenile arrests statewide last year, the first
decrease since 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Violent offenses such as homicides, aggravated robbery and
sexual assaults have been declining in Tarrant County for the past
several years, said Carey Cockerell, director of Tarrant County
Juvenile Services.
</P>
<P>
   Cockerell attributed the local decline to better community
programming, such as the Tarrant County Advocate Program, YMCA,
Boys and Girls Clubs, community policing and efforts that ``put
resources with kids and their families in their neighborhoods.''
</P>
<P>
   If children are more violent, he said, it is because ``we
haven't provided the right skills for kids to deal with conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm convinced that a lot of adolescents do not have
appropriate role models who care about them enough to set limits,''
he added.
</P>
<P>
   Cockerell and others blame the media for the growing negative
perception of juveniles and say that media coverage might encourage
juveniles to commit crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``What never gets conveyed is, we're still talking about a very
small minority of kids that commit the most heinous crime,'' said
Judy Briscoe, chief of staff at the Texas Youth Commission.
</P>
<P>
   At least one major newspaper _ the ``Chicago Sun-Times'' _
agrees that teen-agers are influenced by the news they see and
read, and accordingly opted to change the way it covered the
Springfield shooting. Instead of running the story on the front
page, Editor in Chief Nigel Wade decided to play it on Pages 2 and
3. On the front was a message to readers explaining the newspaper's
``concern that more prominent coverage might harm or frighten
vulnerable children.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some children see only the front page of a newspaper, in a
box, on the street, on the porch or over the breakfast table,''
Wade said in a ``New York Times'' column. ``I did not want to take
the risk that another front-page story about another school
shooting might cause some unbalanced 15-year-old to add one more
disaster to the recent series.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason, Briscoe says, children do seem more violent
than they were 20 years ago. But so are adults, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1973, when I got into this business, the predominant
offense for which kids were committed was stealing and then
disobedience (running away,)'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, 35 percent of our kids are committed for violent
offenses, but children aren't doing anything adults aren't doing.
Our youth violence is a microcosm of what's going on in society.''
</P>
<P>
   Blumstein, however, is not convinced that youths are more
violent. They just have more access to lethal weaponry, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the access to the weaponry that results in the tragic
consequences, because youth have always fought with each other,''
he said. ``But when it's a battle with fists, the dynamics run much
more slowly. With a gun it evolves very rapidly, too fast for a
third party to intervene. That also raises the stakes and
encourages others to arm themselves, thereby triggering a
pre-emptive strike: `I better get him before he gets me.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Although schools have been the focal point of much of the
tragedy, a survey of major North Texas school districts shows that
few weapons were confiscated from students this past year.
Arlington had the highest number, with five. Fort Worth officials
confiscated four, and none was found in the Hurst-Euless-Bedford
district.
</P>
<P>
   Cecelia Speer, director of student affairs, said the Fort Worth
school district has seen a dramatic drop in the number of guns
confiscated. The district has gone from a high of 69 guns in
1991-92, to 39 guns in 1992-93, to 24 in 1993-94, and down into the
single digits. The number crept back up to 10 during 1996-97, but
dropped again this year to four (one of which was confiscated from
a nonstudent).
</P>
<P>
   What is most shocking is the number and power of the guns
students have been using in their crimes, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In the Jonesboro shooting, investigators found 22 spent shell
casings in the copse of trees from where the suspects _ a
13-year-old boy and an 11-year-old boy _ are believed to have shot
at their schoolmates. Five casings were from a .30-06 rifle.
Fifteen were from a .30-caliber rifle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that I find astonishing is not that a 13-year-old
kid is angry at his girlfriend,'' said Blumstein, ``but that he has
access to the arsenal that he is reported to have had.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he would favor some type of punishment _ civil or
criminal _ for people who give children access to guns, just
bartenders are liable for letting someone become drunk if that
person commits vehicular homicide.

TICKET SALES SAG FOR THE HOLYFIELD-AKINWANDE BOUT 
</HEADLINE>
  (dc) 
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If Evander Holyfield chops down the 6-foot-7-inch
Henry Akinwande on Saturday night at Madison Square Garden and
there is no one around to hear it, will it make a sound?
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield doesn't care.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody has this thing that they like to feel like they're a
draw,'' Holyfield said. ``I'd love to see the place packed. That
inspires me. But if it's just me, Henry and the referee, that would
be OK. I just want to know that I'm better.''
</P>
<P>
   Ticket sales have been sagging for the heavyweight championship
bout, the first at Madison Square Garden since Riddick Bowe fought
Michael Dokes in 1993. The reasons are as varied as ticket prices
(from $1,000 for ringside to $100 for the least expensive seat),
another major sporting event in the area on the same day (the
Belmont Stakes) and the spring weather that invites outdoor
activities. As of Wednesday afternoon, just over 7,000 tickets had
been sold for the fight, which will be broadcast live on
pay-per-view by Showtime Event Television ($39.95).
</P>
<P>
   The promoter Don King set the ticket prices, which are expensive
even by New York standards. By comparison, tickets are priced
between $350 (ringside) and $30 for Oscar De La Hoya's WBC
welterweight title defense against Patrick Charpentier at the Sun
Bowl in El Paso on June 13, a bout for which more than 50,000
tickets have been sold.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's happening in New York is a disservice to Evander
Holyfield,'' said Bob Arum of Top Rank Boxing, De La Hoya's
promoter and a rival of King. ``He's a great champion. But the
price of the tickets means that even though people would like to
see Holyfield fight, they can't afford it. It's ludicrous.''
</P>
<P>
   Another reason for flagging sales might be that true boxing fans
view the bout between Holyfield and Akinwande as a stinker.
Akinwande, who was disqualified for excessive clutching in his last
title fight, against Lennox Lewis, is suspect as a quality
opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Ticket sales have never been a question for Holyfield because in
the last 10 years he has fought only twice outside a
casino-sponsored venue in Las Vegas, Lake Tahoe and Atlantic City.
He fought Bert Cooper at the Omni in Atlanta on Nov. 23, 1991, and
he fought Bobby Czyz at Madison Square Garden on May 10, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield and his lawyer, Jim Thomas, say they don't believe
they're involved in a bad show.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still think you are discounting how good a fight this could
be,'' Thomas said. ``You've got a guy who is big and skilled.
Evander brings out the best in his opponents. I think you'll see
the best Akinwande you've ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody has kind of shamed the guy by telling him he doesn't
deserve the fight,'' Holyfield said of Akinwande. ``The man has
been listening to that for eight weeks. This guy is coming here
with something to prove to himself and everybody who says he
doesn't have a chance. You know he's going to work hard and be at
his very best. He feels like he doesn't have anything to lose. He's
going to try to prove a point to the whole world that he's worthy
even if he doesn't win the fight.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an interesting fight from a pay-per-view standpoint,''
said R. Thomas Umstead of Multi-Channel News, a weekly trade
publication that follows the pay-per-view industry. ``You know
Akinwande doesn't bring anything to the table, because he has no
name recognition. You don't know what Holyfield brings to the
table. He hasn't fought in a while, so there will be interest to
see him fight. I think it's going to do anywhere between 300,000
and 500,000 buys. It's going to do less than Holyfield-Moorer.''
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield's last bout, against Michael Moorer, did 550,000 buys.
</P>
<P>
   Although Holyfield has been involved in four of the top five
boxing pay-per-view shows (two with Tyson and one with George
Foreman), he is not in the same class as Tyson when it comes to
attracting an audience. Tyson has been involved in 7 of the top 10
boxing pay-per-view shows.
</P>
<P>
   But Holyfield discounts the fact that Tyson has a certain
mystique that makes him an attractive draw.
</P>
<P>
   Said Holyfield: ``A man comes out of jail and the whole world
watches him come out. `Oh, he's dangerous!' People came to see if
he's going to hurt the guy. People are into the hurt business to
the point where if you say we're going to kill a chicken and we're
going to cut his head off, people are going to come out and see
somebody kill the chicken.''
</P>
<P>
   As far as the crowd at the Garden is concerned, Holyfield
believes that the die-hard boxing fans are going to show up, if for
no other reason than to see him lose.
</P>
<P>
   ``People come out and say, `Well, he's a nice guy, but I've got
to see him get whupped,''' he said. ``They like to see how I
respond if I get whupped good. They'll be waiting a long time for
that. I've already took all my whuppings from my mom.''

PUBLIC INVITED TO HELP CLEAN AREA TRAILS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRETT PAULY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The saw and pickax. The scythe and Pulaski. As
many varieties of hoes, shears and shovels as are forged.
</P>
<P>
   These are the tools that scratched out the countless miles of
pathways crisscrossing the nation. The same tools are depended upon
to maintain those trails that are beaten by more than 47 million
Americans who hike at least once a year.
</P>
<P>
   But tools alone don't make a trail. It takes a strong back and
steely will. The American Hiking Society is looking for both
Saturday during its sixth annual National Trails Day, an event
organizers expect will draw at least one million people to more
than 3,200 trail-work and celebratory activities planned across the
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to let people know that they have ownership of their
local trails and to take pride in them,'' said Gwyn Fletcher Hicks,
spokeswoman for the Silver Spring, Md.-based American Hiking
Society, founded in 1976 to establish, maintain and protect
trekkers' corridors. ``National Trails Day was created to promote
trails and public appreciation for them, and this is our way of
getting people to take the next step and get them involved in trail
initiatives.''
</P>
<P>
   Initiatives that would free up funding to help ensure that
trails are not engulfed by development or left so idle that
disrepair makes them obsolete.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about awareness of the fragility of trails _ the fact
that they don't maintain themselves and are encroachable,'' said
Bob Ballou, executive director of the Pacific Crest Trail
Association. ``When you take away trails, you take away
recreational opportunities, you take away wildlife and open space,
and you contribute to the uglification of America.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to build a constituency for trails and have that
constituency make its feelings known to Congress (and state
governments).''
</P>
<P>
   X X X
</P>
<P>
   There are a couple of local events on the National Trails Day
registry slated for Saturday. Volunteers are asked to wear long
pants and layered clothing and bring work gloves, their own lunch,
at least two quarts of water, a hat, sunglasses, sunscreen and bug
repellent. Tools are provided, though attendees are welcome to
bring their own. No previous trail-work experience is required.
</P>
<P>
   Backbone Trail: The project will restore a section of the
pathway in Malibu's Upper Solstice Canyon damaged by El Nino-fueled
storms.
</P>
<P>
   Take Pacific Coast Highway (1) to Corral Canyon Road (3.75 miles
east of Kanan-Dume Road and 2.35 miles west off Malibu Canyon
Road). Drive north 5.5 miles to its terminus and park. Parking
spaces are limited and carpooling is recommended.
</P>
<P>
   The event runs from 8:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. To participate,
volunteers must be at the parking lot by 8:30. However, they are
welcome to leave at any time. About 140 people are expected.
</P>
<P>
   Information: (818) 222-4531, (805) 370-2301 or (310) 473-4574,
ext. 3011.
</P>
<P>
   Vasquez Rocks County Park: The day will feature maintenance
along the Pacific Crest Trail through the Agua Dulce parkland and a
celebration marking the renewal of official Pacific Crest Trail
Association partnerships with the Bureau of Land Management, U.S.
Forest Service and National Park Service.
</P>
<P>
   The trail work takes place from 7:30 a.m. to 2 p.m. No parking
fee will be charged for volunteers; all others must pay the
customary $3 charge. Take the Golden State Freeway (5) north to the
Antelope Valley Freeway (14) east, exit at Escondido Canyon Road
and turn left. Turn left again at Agua Dulce Canyon Road.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the day's activities are designed for PCTA members, but
the public is welcomed to most, including the following:
</P>
<P>
   _A day hike and a fund-raising ``poker hike run'' through the
Sierra Pelona section of the Angeles National Forest, 9 a.m. to
noon. Meet at the Mint Canyon Road Trailhead, intersection of Agua
Dulce Canyon Road and Sierra Highway.
</P>
<P>
   _Two one-hour guided nature hikes through Vasquez Rocks County
Park, 9 to 11 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   _Education and speaker's program, noon to 3 p.m., Agua Dulce
Women's Club, 33201 Agua Dulce Canyon Road.
</P>
<P>
   _Public remarks, recognition and press conference, 3 to 4 p.m.,

FISH FREE AND GET HOOKED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRETT PAULY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As altruistic as Free Fishing Day might sound, the
Department of Fish and Game has ulterior motives behind its
biannual event.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, while fishing licenses are required for anglers 16 and
older 363 days a year, none is needed Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   And, sure, no charge is asked at various fishing events slated
around the state to enlighten novices and first-timers.
</P>
<P>
   But you just know there's a ... hook.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who enjoy the experience are more likely to become
licensed anglers or supporters of Fish and Game programs,'' said
Jack Edwards, a DFG spokesman at the state office in Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, the rub, and surprisingly revealing. Using a comp day on the
water as the carrot, tyros are lured into the department's web,
compelled to buy a license to satisfy their newfound lust for
another outing, and another and another.
</P>
<P>
   Simply ingenious, for the plan benefits everyone. The funds are
employed to plant more fish, increase the number of available
loaner rods and reels and develop additional free fishing clinics
to teach anglers the finer points of fish biology, tackle,
technique, safety, ethics and fish handling.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives the public recreational opportunities that they might
not have otherwise,'' Edwards said. ``And it's a great way to spend
time with your kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Bravo, DFG, bravo. Your scheme is sound and sincere.
</P>
<P>
   Free Fishing Day is scheduled the first Saturday in June and the
last Saturday of September to correspond to National Fishing Week
and National Hunting and Fishing Day, respectively. The DFG program
started in 1991 on the approval of the State Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Free Fishing Day participants never buy a license or
fish again, the knowledge they gain in a single morning or
afternoon can go to a greater benefit. A learning experience for
greenhorns, a chance to share their wisdom for graybeards, a
confidence boost for all involved. And Mother Nature gets some of
the trickle-down.
</P>
<P>
   ``People increase their knowledge of the aquatic habitat and
become more interested in caring for the environment, building
stewardship,'' said Jackie Kourassis, coordinator of the DFG's
Fishing in the City program for Los Angeles and Orange counties.
</P>
<P>
   So try your luck Saturday at any of a number of bodies of water.
</P>
<P>
   Four area urban lakes will be stocked with catfish for the
event:
</P>
<P>
   _Peck Road Park, 5401 N. Peck Road, Arcadia; (626) 334-1065.
</P>
<P>
   _Santa Fe Dam, 15501 E. Arrow Highway, Irwindale; same phone as
above.
</P>
<P>
   _Puddingstone Lake, 120 E. Via Verde, San Dimas; (909) 599-2667
or (909) 599-8411.
</P>
<P>
   _Downey Wilderness Park, 10999 Little Lake Road, Downey; (562)
904-7131.
</P>
<P>
   The DFG is planning one free local event, at Santa Fe Dam. It
will include fly-tying and fly-casting instruction and five
learning stations operated by volunteers. Some loaner rods and
reels will be available; ID is required. For more information, call
the facility or the DFG at (562) 590-4835 or (562) 590-4824.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous creeks, rivers and reservoirs are regularly stocked
with trout and/or catfish, including these in Los Angeles and
Ventura counties: Big Tujunga Creek, Bouquet Canyon Creek, Casitas
Lake, Castaic Lake and Lagoon, Elizabeth Lake, Little Rock Creek
and Reservoir, Matilija Creek, Piru Creek and Lake, Rancho Simi
Park Lake, Reyes Creek, San Gabriel River (all forks) and Rose
Valley Lakes.
</P>
<P>
   See the Fishing Report on page 11, call the DFG's 24-hour Fish
Stocking Information at (562) 590-5020 or visit the department's
Web site at http://www.dfg.ca.gov to determine which were to be
stocked this week.

STUDENTS DEMAND HABIBIE'S RESIGNATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By SETH MYDANS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ Singing, chanting, blowing kisses, waving
flags, Jakarta's students were out in force again on Wednesday in
motorcades of buses and cars that wove through the city demanding,
in the happiest manner possible, the downfall of the government.
</P>
<P>
   Bursting with the energy of youth, flush with their recent
victory in helping to oust President Suharto, the students seemed
to have become an unstoppable force, maintaining momentum for
democratic change.
</P>
<P>
   They rejected the slow, deliberate constitutional procedures
outlined on Tuesday by President B.J. Habibie, who said in an
interview that he could not transfer power to a new leader before
the end of next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Habibie must go!'' they shouted. ``Reform now!''
</P>
<P>
   And many of their elders seemed to agree. A number of opposition
figures whom Habibie is consulting _ notably the pro-democracy
leader Amien Rais _ are demanding new elections this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look happy but inside we are sad,'' said Hermanjosef, a
24-year-old student studying psychology. ``We are sad about the
government. It is not the same as our inner voice.''
</P>
<P>
   The military turned out in force along the students' route,
blocking key intersections with cordons of soldiers armed with
metal staffs and automatic weapons. Though they exchanged smiles
and thumbs-up signals with the students, the soldiers were a
reminder that demonstrations can turn violent and deadly.
</P>
<P>
   In another reminder, the country's leading human rights group
said Wednesday that at least 1,188 people had died in Jakarta in
the riots that swept the city from May 12 to May 15 after at least
four students were shot dead in a demonstration on the campus of
Trisakti University. This death toll is more than double the
initial estimate by the military.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, the toll is believed to be much higher. Devastating
riots broke out in many cities as weeks of mostly peaceful student
demonstrations were suddenly transformed into a chaos of rioting
and looting.
</P>
<P>
   The rights report did not say how the deaths occurred, but
evidence in Jakarta suggests that the overwhelming majority of the
victims were looters trapped in stores that were set on fire by
rioters who drove around the city hurling gasoline bombs.
</P>
<P>
   In one hospital in Jakarta where nearly 200 bodies were
collected, all but a handful had burned to death. A small number
had been shot or stabbed by unknown assailants.
</P>
<P>
   An uncounted number of those burned to death were also ethnic
Chinese trapped inside shops or homes that were attacked by rioters
in a familiar pattern here in this overwhelmingly Muslim and ethnic
Malay nation. ``One of the targets of the unrest was the ethnic
Chinese group, which in reality is an inseparable part of the
Indonesian society,'' the rights group said.
</P>
<P>
   The group, the National Commission on Human Rights, blamed the
armed forces for failing to contain the damage and death.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``When the unrest took place, there was no visible evidence of
serious efforts from the security forces to prevent it,'' the
report said. ``The security forces did not adequately anticipate
the strong possibility that the unrest could have broken out.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the deaths, the report tallied an extraordinary
swath of devastation in the capital, saying 40 large shopping
centers, 4,083 shops, 1,026 private homes, 383 offices and 1,119
automobiles had been attacked, burned or looted.
</P>
<P>
   Echoing many accounts, the commission said unidentified
``organized groups'' had been involved in some of the burning and
vandalism. Witnesses reported seeing men in trucks or on
motorcycles traveling through the city identifying Chinese-owned
homes and businesses or handing out gasoline bombs.
</P>
<P>
   The city is filled with theories about these groups, and it
remains unclear whether they involved thugs, representatives of
radical organizations or provocateurs from some branch of the
security forces.
</P>
<P>
   The commission, which is financed by the government but has
earned a reputation for independence, called on Habibie to
``thoroughly investigate'' the security forces for ``not preventing
or immediately dealing with the riots.''
</P>
<P>
   The military said on Wednesday that 10 low-ranking officers
would go on trial on Saturday in the shooting deaths of the
university students, the incident that led to the rioting.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were 10 people who did the shooting without orders,''
Chief of Military Police Maj. Gen. Syamsu said in a report on
Wednesday in the Indonesian Observer, a newspaper. ``They were
soldiers and noncommissioned officers.''
</P>
<P>
   His exoneration of higher officials was greeted with skepticism
by students. The newspaper reported that some students at Trisakti
University said they had received threats and had been told not to
come forward with information about the deaths. &QL;

PIOLINE CRASHES AN ALL-SPANISH FINAL FOUR
</HEADLINE>
  (With TEN-FRENCH-OPEN)  
(ja) 
 By ROBIN FINN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Cedric Pioline was commanding full attention on the
wind-whipped center court at Roland Garros today, working a big wad
of gum and pretending to be pluckier than he felt. He was one game
from winning a five-set epic with the acrobatic Hicham Arazi, one
game from reaching his first French Open semifinal after a decade
of disappointment at his hometown Grand Slam tournament.
</P>
<P>
   As the Moroccan Arazi, in deep trouble at 2-5 in the final set,
scuffed toward the baseline to try to stave off disaster with his
serve, Pioline's frenzied fans began a vehement version of the
wave. Around and around the jammed stadium it went, picking up
momentum with each revolution until, by the fourth go-round, it had
turned into a tidal wave. At the behest of the chair umpire, the
wave faded away. But the 24-year-old Arazi did not: he held his
ground with an annoying ace, forcing Pioline to serve out the match
and earn his accolades honestly.
</P>
<P>
   Pioline, who turns 29 on June 15, seemed close to collapse. But
he delivered a desperate seat-of-the-pants volley at 0-15 while
tumbling to the clay, saved a break point with a bullish backhand
approach and converted his first match point for a 3-6, 6-2, 7-6
(8-6), 4-6, 6-3 victory when Arazi fluffed a forehand long.
</P>
<P>
   Chic or not, the place went ballistic. Even the typically stoic
Roland Garros groundskeepers could not refrain from clapping as
they hustled to prepare the net for a doubles match.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I'm going to jump into the Seine River, commit
suicide,'' Arazi said after converting only 4 of the 21 break
chances Pioline gave him. ``If I compare myself with Cedric, he
looked very tired, but he was much more aggressive than I was,
really moved up to the net and made quite a few volleys. Instead of
running to the net only to shake his hand at the end, I should have
been more to the net before that.''
</P>
<P>
   The valiant performance by the 17th-ranked Pioline earned him a
semifinal match against 14th-seeded Alex Corretja of Spain, who
advanced with relative ease by trouncing Filip Dewulf of Belgium,
7-5, 6-4, 6-3. Pioline, the only Frenchman to reach the finals of
two different Grand Slam tournaments in the open era _ the 1993
U.S. Open and last year's Wimbledon _ is the only non-Spaniard, and
the only unseeded player, to reach the semifinals here this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is history in our tennis, but I hope the people
in Spain don't believe this is really easy,'' said Corretja, who
joined 12th-seeded Carlos Moya and 15th-seeded Felix Mantilla in
the semifinals. ``We've been practicing on clay through our life,
and now is the moment to forget about the small tournaments and go
for the big one, as we did here.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the first time three Spaniards have reached the
semifinals of a Grand Slam event. Four times in Grand Slam history,
representatives of a single nation have filled the semifinals, most
recently at the Australian Open in 1995, when an all-American crew
of Pete Sampras, Andre Agassi, Michael Chang and Aaron Krickstein
reached the final four.
</P>
<P>
   Pioline crashed this final four by refusing to cave in during
his 3-hour-43-minute quarterfinal. He saved a set point against him
in the third set with a second-service ace that helped force a tie
breaker, in which he saved another set point with a high backhand
volley that pulled Arazi off the court and produced a forehand
error. Once Pioline broke Arazi for a 4-2 lead in the fifth set, by
outlasting him in a junkball rally in which the impatient Arazi
netted a backhand at break point, he scraped his way through for
the victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I could have gone on,'' said Pioline, who
needed nearly two hours of restorative treatment, including
intravenous rehydration, after the ordeal. It was his third
five-setter of the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MATCH POINTS  &LR;  The only American left in the junior boys'
competition, 17-year-old Taylor Dent, reached the quarterfinals
Wednesday with a 6-4, 7-6 (7-2) defeat of Guillermo Coria of
Argentina. . . . The Grand Slam committee announced that the French
Open's 1997 champion, Gustavo Kuerten, who lost in the second round
in singles and was disqualified from his doubles quarterfinal
Tuesday night for hurling his racquet at the umpire Bruno Rebeuh,
will be fined just $7,000 rather than his approximately $40,000 in
winnings. The devastated Kuerten, who will also lose the 22 ranking
points he earned here, said he deeply regretted the incident and
hoped it would make him become ``a more mature person.''

 &HT;    Nostalgia _ but with gadgets _ next trend in home building
 &HT;    By Susan Harte
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Cozy but high-tech Tudor houses on tree-lined streets
could replace multi-gabled suburban mini-mansions with two-story
foyers and Palladian windows as America's next dream homes.
</P>
<P>
   That's what some 5,000 architects and designers will be told as
they gather today through Saturday for the fifth annual Southern
Building Show. A longing for simpler days, a changing family and a
computer in every home will be among themes discussed at the event,
held at the Cobb Galleria Centre.
</P>
<P>
   The show is not open to the public. It showcases new products,
the latest software and forward-looking design trends for members
of the building trades.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Reimer, president of Omaha, Neb.-based Design Basics,
thinks people are looking for ways to recapture memories of
friendly, grandmotherly houses.
</P>
<P>
   ``People live in the suburbs, but they are starting to want the
feeling of a smaller community, one with lampposts, where you can
walk at night,'' said Reimer.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want places to sit and visit _ like porches. And inside
of the house, they want very flexible room spaces _ a dining room
now but a library after the kids leave home.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with Boca Raton, Fla., architect Quincy Johnson, Reimer
will talk today about other features she believes will sell in the
cutting-edge housing market:
</P>
<P>
   Airy, light rooms are no longer limited to Florida but are
showing up all over.
</P>
<P>
   Bigger bathrooms and wider doors for walkers or wheelchairs for
a time when the owners grow older or their parents move in.
</P>
<P>
   Lots of storage space in the garage.
</P>
<P>
   Computer niches, where users can sit for a few minutes at a
time, replacing ``computer rooms'' or computer set-ups in family
rooms.
</P>
<P>
   New products will include vinyl flooring that looks like wood,
ceramic or stone; windowpane films that block ultraviolet rays and
diminish nighttime reflections; and maintenance-free exteriors with
siding and fencing that needs no painting. Baby boomers have
neither the time nor the inclination to toil over maintenance, said
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the largest group of home buyers in the free world,''
he said. ``Even though it is a diverse group ranging in age from 34
to 52, it is interested in lifestyle. The first-move-ups continue
to be status seekers, wanting the most impressive houses their
money can buy . . . but others are developing a
been-there-done-that attitude about big houses with big yards.''

 &HT;    Woodruff Arts corporate support is second only to Lincoln Center
 &HT;    By Maria Saporta
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- The Woodruff Arts Center's annual corporate campaign
has passed the $6 million mark for the first time in its history.
</P>
<P>
   Allen Franklin, chairman of the campaign and president of
Georgia Power Co., will announce the campaign's success at a
reception today hosted by Gov. Zell Miller and his wife, Shirley.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign surpassed the $5.9 million goal. The corporate
campaign now is the second largest corporate arts fund in the
nation behind New York's Lincoln Center. The fund benefits the
Woodruff Arts Center and its four divisions _ the Alliance Theatre
Co., the Atlanta College of Art, the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra and
the High Museum of Art.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the campaign raised $5.7 million, a $500,000 increase
over the year before.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things we wondered about after last year's dramatic
increase was whether it could be sustained this year,'' Franklin
said. ``Happily, we were able to sustain it and bump it up another
notch.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest donors were: Georgia Power ($100,000); Community
Foundation for Greater Atlanta ($100,000); Cook Family Foundation
($100,000); Primerica Financial Services ($100,000); United Parcel
Service ($50,000); Crawford &AMP; Co. ($30,000); and the Katherine and
John Murphy Foundation ($25,000).
</P>
<P>
   Franklin attributed part of the growth to the addition of 15 new
members to the Patron Circle of Stars, companies that give $10,000
or more: General Electric Power Systems ($25,000); ING North
America Insurance ($25,000); Premiere Technologies ($25,000); and
Miller Industries ($15,000).
</P>
<P>
   Next year, the campaign will be led by James R. Lientz Jr.,
president of NationsBank-Georgia, followed by Roger Kintzel,
publisher of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Despite strong corporate response to the Woodruff Arts Center
campaign, arts leaders recently have grumbled it does not receive
enough support from the Atlanta community.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly see the business community taking a leadership
role,'' said Shelton G. Stanfill, president of the Woodruff Arts
Center, ``where Atlanta is lacking is in individual giving. Not to
take anything away from the individuals who are giving, overall, it
would not begin to match what people are giving in Washington, San
Francisco, Denver, New York, Minneapolis and Chicago. Corporations
give more here than in most other cities I just named.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Woodruff Arts Center board held its annual
meeting Wednesday afternoon. John W. Spiegel, CFO of SunTrust Bank,
is chairman of the board, succeeding G. Joseph Prendergast,
chairman of Wachovia-Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Newly named to the Woodruff Arts Center board was M. Douglas
Ivester, chairman and CEO of Coca-Cola Co.
</P>
<P>
   Women's Fund strong
</P>
<P>
   Come July 1, the Atlanta Women's Fund will become a stand-alone
foundation _ emerging from under the umbrella of the Community
Foundation for Greater Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel we have achieved our womanhood and maturity as an
organization,'' said Stephanie Davis, executive director of the
Atlanta Women's Fund, which will become the Atlanta Women's
Foundation.``We are practicing what we preach for women and girls,
which is autonomy, independence and self-sufficiency.''
</P>
<P>
   For 12 years, the women's fund has been part of the Community
Foundation, where it has been able to give more than $1.2 million
for organizations dealing with the homeless, domestic violence and
other needs of women. It also has built up $1.1 million in endowed
funds, which will continue to be managed by the Community
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are really enthusiastic about this,'' said Alicia Philipp,
executive director of the Community Foundation, whose board
approved the change Wednesday. ``We see our foundation as a
nurturer of goals.''
</P>
<P>
   The two organizations also were taking diverging paths. The
Community Foundation attracts significant givers for its endowment
funds, and then it makes donations based on the proceeds of its
endowment. The Atlanta Women's Fund has become known for its
widely-attended receptions hosted by its partners (such as Women in
Finance, Women in Law and Medicine, Women in Media and Commercial
Real Estate Women). Those funds are doled out to organizations
supporting women and girls.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are considered one of the fastest-growing women's funds in
the country,'' Davis said. ``We now have 3,000 donors. Numerically,
that is more than the Community Foundation. But financially, it's
nowhere close.''
</P>
<P>
   The foundation will relocate to its own offices on the same
floor of the Hurt Building as the Community Foundation. It also
will have its own governing board, largely made up of members from
its existing advisory board.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth T. West, advisory board chair and partner at King &AMP;
Spalding, also was excited about the change, saying, ``We want to
show the power of women in a way that's very imaginative, very
aggressive and fully on our own.''

   The gains of Spain &QL; 
are plain in Paris
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
PARIS _ The, uh, Spanish Open?
</P>
<P>
   France's Cedric Pioline finds himself surrounded on his own
turf. The heroic homeboy, he of the daily five-set Houdini gig, has
the Roland Garros garrison overwhelmingly in his corner, but in
truth, it's he who has been cornered at the French Open.
</P>
<P>
   They're everywhere, the Spaniards. Basques. Andalusians.
Catalans. Tall ones. Short ones. Drop-dead gorgeous ones. Long
hair. Short hair. Weird hair. They constitute a late-20th-century
Armada, a swarm of baseline-hugging dirt-ball maestros who swarmed
through the Pyrenees to settle their internecine differences on
French soil, the burnt-amber terre battue.
</P>
<P>
   The reign of Spain looks pretty sunny. The Americans had their
day, as did the Germans, the Swedes and, of course, the
once-dynastic Australians. But of late, tennis has begun to acquire
an Iberian tilt, certainly on red clay.
</P>
<P>
   The ATP season began with 16 Spaniards ranked among the top 100,
six more than the American contingent, which was hanging in second,
one ahead of Germany. The Roland Garros semifinals, however, will
habla espaol, save for Cedric.
</P>
<P>
   Six of Spain's hombres reached the final 16, half of whom
advanced to the quarters, each of whom then stormed
unapologetically into the semis.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Corretja would be the latest, whipping Belgian upstart
Filip Dewulf on Wednesday. Carlos Moya and Felix Mantilla had
already achieved the penultimate round the previous afternoon, the
former knocking out the favorite to win the tournament, Marcelo
Rios.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone surprised
</P>
<P>
   Also, old-timer Arantxa Sanchez Vicario continues to pursue a
third women's title. She's a likely finalist _ sorry, Lindsay
Davenport _ meaning Spain could be front and center on Court
Central for the whole weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Corretja, having almost flawlessly disposed of the Dewulf in
sheep's clothing, was asked if he has been surprised by the
dominance of his cadre of compadres.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am only surprised,'' he replied, ``that we aren't four in
the semifinals.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a sore leg muscle might have prevented Alberto
Berasategui from beating Pioline's worthy Wednesday foil, Hicham
Arazi, in the round of 16. Berasategui, no stranger to success on
the terre battue, had himself been a finalist in 1994, losing to _
naturally _ another Spaniard, Sergi Bruguera.
</P>
<P>
   Bruguera was the point man, the fellow who announced the
gathering Spanish invasion to the world by conquering Paris
back-to-back in 1993-94. Now, Sergi's just another among many faces
in the Spanish crowd, and a lesser light at that.
</P>
<P>
   The Spanish are so omnipresent that one of them, rising star
Julian Alonso, has even discreetly become Martina Hingis' secret
amor. Not bad for a country that could fit into Arizona with little
spillover.
</P>
<P>
   You probably wonder what's going on here. There have been a
smattering of Spanish champions through the years, most notably the
two Manuels _ Santana and Orantes. But they have never arrived in
waves like this.
</P>
<P>
   Close-knit countrymen
</P>
<P>
   The secret of their toasting France is a no-quarter work ethic
and a mutual support structure that lets them draw strength from
each other. These guys are friends in every sense of the word.
</P>
<P>
   ``On court, we are fighting hard,'' explains Moya, who reached
the Australian Open final last year and appears to be the best of
his class by a slim margin. ``But off the court, we are doing
everything to help each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Same as Connors and McEnroe used to, right?
</P>
<P>
   If any of the trio wins Sunday _ you tend to like the odds _ the
two who don't will nonetheless feel better about themselves.
They're a team, a concept foreign to tennis since the Aussies'
Golden Age, although the Edberg-era Swedes briefly had a similar
chemistry, if not the same camaraderie.
</P>
<P>
   From widely disparate backgrounds and locales, the Spaniards
have gravitated to Barcelona, where they live, train and party
together.
</P>
<P>
   Corretja, heretofore most famous for losing a memorable five-set
U.S. Open quarterfinal to an upchucking Pete Sampras, has been as
high as No. 4 in the world. Moya rose to fifth in the rankings in
1997 and established himself as an international heartthrob.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Corretja nor Moya, however, is currently in the top 10 _
nor is the yellow-haired Mantilla _ and they won't receive their
full due until they accomplish elsewhere what they have done en
masse at Roland Garros.
</P>
<P>
   Wimbledon's lawns remain a particularly treacherous adversary
for the Spaniards, treating them no more hospitably than the
British navy did the original Armada.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need somebody who can play well just once on grass,''
Corretja says. ``Then, the others will think they can as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Caramba! Today Paris, tomorrow todo el mundo.

   Tired of biting into mushy tomatoes or rock-hard cantaloupe?
Here are a few hints on choosing the best fresh fruits and
vegetables. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WATERMELON
</P>
<P>
   In the store: I hate to break it to you, but thunking, floating
or balancing a watermelon is useless. Instead, look for an attached
stem that is discolored and shrunken; that's a good sign. If the
stem has fallen off, the watermelon is over the hill and will be
mushy and dark red. The melon should be heavy for its size. The
underside should be pale or creamy yellow, and the rind should have
a healthy sheen.
</P>
<P>
   At home: Store watermelon in a cool place (but not the
refrigerator), away from sunlight. Depending on the temperature,
and the condition of the melon, it can keep for a week. Cut melon
should be wrapped tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerated. It
should last a day or two in the refrigerator, but the texture can
become mushy.
</P>
<P>
   CORN-ON-THE-COB
</P>
<P>
   In the store: Choose fresh-looking ears with tight, green husks
and a sweet smell. The kernels should be plump and juicy and packed
closely on the husk. Color of kernels varies by variety, from white
to buttercream to crocus-hued. Big, tough kernels can indicate
over-the-hill corn that will be more starch than sugar.
</P>
<P>
   At home: Cook as soon as possible. (There's an old adage that
you should start boiling the water as you head out the door to pick
the corn.) If dinner isn't imminent, store in refrigerator. Don't
store corn longer than two days.
</P>
<P>
   CANTALOUPE
</P>
<P>
   In the store: Select melons that are slightly oval with a golden
background under the netting. Sniff the stem end to find melons
with a distinct aroma, and look for tiny cracks at the stem end:
Both indicate ripeness.
</P>
<P>
   At home: Store melons at room temperature. A cantaloupe should
last a couple of days on the counter. If you want the fruit
chilled, place in refrigerator shortly before serving.
</P>
<P>
   OKRA
</P>
<P>
   In the store: Look for bright green pods that are 2 to 4 inches
long. Larger pods can be tough. The pods should snap easily.
</P>
<P>
   At home: Refrigerate in a brown paper bag or in a plastic bag
lined with paper towels. Don't store longer than two days.
</P>
<P>
   PEACHES
</P>
<P>
   In the store: Don't pinch the peaches. Instead, let the
background color of the fruit be the key. It should be
cream-colored or yellow. Unripe peaches will ripen at room
temperature; they won't get sweeter, but they will get juicier.
Don't buy peaches that have a green undercast; they won't ripen.
</P>
<P>
   At home: Refrigerate fully ripe peaches, but only for one or two
days. Otherwise, leave them on a counter.
</P>
<P>
   TOMATOES
</P>
<P>
   In the store: Looks can be deceiving when it comes to tomatoes.
Although winter tomatoes look nicely shaped, smooth and firm, they
have no flavor. Instead, choose tomatoes that are heavy for their
size and still have stems attached (they'll stay fresher longer).
And smell _ a good tomato smells like a tomato. Greenish tomatoes
will turn red eventually, but the redder the farm-stand tomato, the
more ready it is to eat.
</P>
<P>
   At home: Keep tomatoes out of the refrigerator. Instead, store
on a counter top away from heat and moisture. Some tomatoes will
keep for a day, some for a week.
</P>
<P>
   GREEN BEANS
</P>
<P>
   In the store: Days were when green beans needed to be strung of
their string. No longer. Now the strings have been bred out of
beans. But the snap remains. Look for beans that are small to
medium with a velveteen texture and bright green color. If you can
chew the bean uncooked, it will be just as tender out of the pot.
</P>
<P>
   At home: Refrigerate unwashed green beans in a paper bag or
unsealed plastic bag for no more than one or two days.
</P>
<P>
   CHILE PEPPERS
</P>
<P>
   In the store: Jalapenos, serranos and any other chile pepper
should be crisp, with no sign of wilting or bruising. Peppers with
woody striations have usually been water-deprived and/or
heat-stressed, and can be hotter than the norm.
</P>
<P>
   At home: Store peppers in the crisper for no more than a couple
of days. Left at room temperature, peppers will go limp quickly.

MEXICO DENOUNCES U.S. ROLE IN MONEY-LAUNDERING STING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PHILIP TRUE  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Foreign Minister Rosario Green said Mexico was
``obligated'' to investigate, charge and seek the extradition of
U.S. agents who violated this country's sovereignty during a recent
money-laundering sting operation.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of a three-year investigation that the U.S. Justice
Department last month termed the largest of its kind in American
history, at least 22 Mexican bank officials were enticed to the
United States, then arrested on charges of laundering money
allegedly belonging to Mexican drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   But Mexican judicial authorities have said that at least some
undercover aspects of ``Operation Casablanca'' took place on
Mexican soil, without knowledge or consent of Mexican officials,
violating anti-drug agreements and Mexican sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is one line to which we Mexicans are obligated: There
was a series of violations of Mexican law, and this will be pursued
officially,'' Green told Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a very precise instruction from (President Ernesto
Zedillo) that we will not desist ... we are going to insist on ...
the investigation of the crimes and that arrest warrants be issued
... to solicit extradition,'' Green said.
</P>
<P>
   He said American officials ``must be educated (to understand)
that other legal systems exist in other parts of the world, just as
solid as theirs, and that they have to respect them.''
</P>
<P>
   Green spoke with Albright privately at a meeting of ministers of
the Organization of American States in Caracas, Venezuela, earlier
this week.
</P>
<P>
   Their conversation was revealed by the foreign minister in a
radio interview here on Tuesday, and a transcript of the interview
was released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   State Department officials could not be reached for comment on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   During the investigation, U.S. agents masqueraded as drug
sellers. Their contacts then put them in touch with Mexican
bankers, who were allegedly willing to participate in
money-laundering schemes.
</P>
<P>
   The bankers, mostly mid-level managers, were lured to Nevada
with the promise of attending the opening of a gambling casino.
</P>
<P>
   Green said U.S. undercover agents had themselves committed
money-laundering violations punishable under Mexican law while
entrapping the bankers and usurped Mexican authority because they
acted without notification of the Mexican government.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo and top Mexican anti-narcotics officials have emphasized
national sovereignty and multilateral cooperation in the
international drug fight, a position strongly backed by Barry
McCaffrey, the White House drug policy director.

ANALYSIS: WILL LEWINSKY'S LAWYERS SEEK TO CHART NEW COURSE? 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also LEWINSKY-LAWYERS) 
(sw) 
 By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Monica Lewinsky's new team of lawyers has inherited
a legal strategy built on two seemingly irreconcilable goals. The
aim was to head off an indictment of their client, without putting
her in a position of becoming the witness who threatened to topple
a president.
</P>
<P>
   The unappealing set of possible options _ to become either
history's next John Dean or its next Susan McDougal _ has been
guided almost exclusively by the protective instincts of Ms.
Lewinsky's parents. Divorced and not always of one voice, Ms.
Lewinsky's father and mother have struggled since the outset of the
inquiry nearly five months ago to spare their daughter from either
the pain of an indictment or the agony of a protracted impeachment
proceeding where she would become the president's accuser-in-chief.
</P>
<P>
   It was on that tightrope that William Ginsburg, a close friend
of Ms. Lewinsky's father, walked for the last four months, wobbling
between the president and the prosecutor as he sought to steer
clear of either an impeachment effort or an indictment, and
ultimately falling off this week.
</P>
<P>
   Like any good criminal lawyers, the new legal team, Plato
Cacheris and Jacob Stein, are moving quickly to see if there may be
room for a deal that averts an indictment. The pair spent a good
part of Wednesday meeting with two other lawyers who have been
working on the case, familiarizing themselves with the history of
the inquiry in preparation for a possible new round of talks with
the independent counsel, Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
   It was a sign that the two defense lawyers may be tacking to a
different wind when, moments after they were appointed on Tuesday,
their first decision was to pay a private courtesy call to the
independent counsel's office. Lawyers said they wanted to announce
their appointment to the prosecutors before they would learn about
it on the news.
</P>
<P>
   The two defense lawyers, according to participants at the
meeting, did not explicitly hold out the prospect of a new deal.
But it was clear that they understood from decades of experience
that by simply setting an initial tone of courtesy and
conciliation, they had begun to build a new reservoir of goodwill
that could be useful as the process moves along.
</P>
<P>
   ``The landscape changed yesterday,'' said one lawyer in Starr's
office. ``This was an honorable thing to do. It didn't surprise any
of us at all because these are two experienced and
independent-minded lawyers who are looking after the best interests
of their client.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not a statement that one of Starr's lawyers would ever
have made about Ginsburg, who alienated prosecutors days into the
inquiry when he kept them waiting by a telephone for hours,
neglecting to return a call as the investigation began to become
public. Prosecutors would later complain that Ginsburg, a
California specialist in civil malpractice cases, had little
understanding of how a criminal inquiry worked.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to Ginsburg, who seemed to revel in his ties to the
Lewinsky family, the two new lawyers are able to offer an
arms-length and dispassionate expertise that associates of Starr
say could lead to a serious new round of talks.
</P>
<P>
   Any new thaw in the frosty relations between prosecutors and Ms.
Lewinsky's lawyers does not bode well for the White House, which as
a political matter had an ally in Ginsburg. Not only did he
regularly criticize Starr, but he also occasionally would make
statements undermining Ms. Lewinsky, statements that could prove
useful to the White House were she to ever testify against the
president.
</P>
<P>
   White House aides on Wednesday would not comment on the new
legal team or about any future agreement between Ms. Lewinsky and
the prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   But it remains far from clear whether a deal with the
prosecutors can be reached as long as Ms. Lewinsky holds to a
strategy of not wanting to be seen as injuring the president.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky's bind is in no small part of her own making. What
has made her lawyers' job so difficult is that prosecutors have
seen two faces of her.
</P>
<P>
   One, on the tapes recorded by her one-time confidante, Linda
Tripp, presents the picture of a young woman acknowledging she will
lie under oath to protect the president, urging Ms. Tripp to lie
and describing steps that may have been taken to conceal evidence
subpoenaed by the lawyers in the Paula Jones sexual harassment
lawsuit, according to people who have heard the tapes.
</P>
<P>
   The other, presented by Ginsburg in a series of proposals on the
testimony his client would be willing to offer prosecutors, shows
Ms. Lewinsky as acknowledging that she had sex with the president
but not being urged by anyone to lie about it, according to lawyers
familiar with the proffers.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the proposals were rejected because prosecutors
apparently came to believe the Linda Tripp tapes. As a result, the
investigators have spent months attempting to corroborate every
important and mundane detail mentioned on them. The process will
enable them to exert enormous pressure on Ms. Lewinsky to
ultimately acknowledge what she said on the tapes in a criminal
settlement or, failing that, to use the corroborative evidence as
the backbone for an indictment.
</P>
<P>
   Her new lawyers made clear on Wednesday that, while talks may
resume soon, they are prepared to fight an indictment if no
agreement is reached.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an absolute misimpression to think that we were only
brought in to cut a deal,'' one of them said. ``We know how to try
a case just as well as to settle one.''

FDA APPROVES FULL-SCALE TEST OF AIDS VACCINE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Colo., Calif., Pa., Mo., Thailand)  (th) 
 By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration has given a California company
approval to conduct the world's first full-scale test of a vaccine
to prevent infection with the AIDS virus, the company announced
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The experiment is to involve 5,000 uninfected individuals in up
to 40 clinics in the United States and Canada and 2,500 volunteers
in 16 clinics in Thailand over the next four years, the company,
VaxGen Inc. of South San Francisco, said. It said it expects to
receive approval from Thai health officials to begin testing in
that country later this year.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement brought expressions of cautious hope among
health officials and advocates for people with AIDS. HIV, the AIDS
virus, has infected an estimated 30 million people in the world,
and many experts say it will take a vaccine to stop the worsening
epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   But scientists are sharply divided over when and which
experimental vaccines to approve for full-scale testing. No vaccine
is 100 percent effective. Some experts favor testing any promising
vaccine, even if it is likely to protect only a small proportion of
recipients, arguing that something is better than nothing in a
health emergency.
</P>
<P>
   But other experts say that full-scale tests should be conducted
only when laboratory and animal research shows a solid scientific
understanding of how an experimental vaccine works.
</P>
<P>
   The VaxGen vaccine was safe in earlier tests involving 1,200
volunteers beginning in March 1992 and induced antibodies in more
than 99 percent of the vaccinated participants, the company said.
The major question the new tests aim to answer is how effective the
experimental vaccine will be among people who are exposed to HIV
because of high-risk sexual practices or injecting drug use.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for people with AIDS and many scientists expressed
hope that the vaccine would protect a large proportion of
recipients.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a watershed event in the AIDS crisis,'' Dr. Seth
Berkley, president of the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative, a
nonprofit group that seeks to accelerate the development of safe
and accessible AIDS vaccines.
</P>
<P>
   But Berkley said he expected that a number of additional trials
in developed and developing countries would be needed to test the
safety and effectiveness of a number of anti-HIV vaccines.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Zingale, a spokesman for the AIDS Action Council, said
his Washington-based national advocacy organization was pleased at
the FDA action and ``cautiously hopeful'' that it would work.
</P>
<P>
   Other scientists expressed doubts about the vaccine's prospects,
saying that the earlier tests showed it boosted only one part of
the immune system involving antibodies, and thus is unlikely to
protect substantial numbers of recipients. Antibodies are proteins
are formed to destroy invading germs in the blood.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Baltimore, a Nobel Prize winner and head of a
government advisory committee on AIDS vaccines, said that it was
``unlikely that the vaccine would be totally protective.''
</P>
<P>
   The main reason is that most experts believe an anti-HIV vaccine
needs to boost another arm of the immune system known as killer
T-cells that destroy virus-infected cells, said Baltimore, who is
president of the California Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore questioned whether the trial's design could determine
whether illness was less severe among those vaccinated, if they
became infected. He called on VaxGen to disclose the trial's
scientific blueprint. VaxGen officials did not respond to a call
asking for it.
</P>
<P>
   In the trial, three injections of the genetically engineered
vaccine, known as Aidsvax, will be given to each volunteer over
several months. The vaccine is made from a portion of HIV's outer
coat, known as gp120, that attaches to cells to infect them.
</P>
<P>
   The first shots are expected to be given in about a month in the
United States. For participants, the company is seeking gay men and
the uninfected partner among discordant couples. In Thailand, the
participants will be uninfected injecting drug users.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The vaccine is an updated version of one made by Genentech that
an advisory panel of experts rejected four years ago for similar
federally-financed large-scale testing in the United States; the
experts expressed doubts about the vaccine's effectiveness. An
earlier panel had recommended proceeding with such tests.
</P>
<P>
   In accepting the second panel's recommendation, Dr. Anthony
Fauci, the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious
Diseases, left the door open for a company or another country to
test the vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   Fauci said in an interview that he doubted that VaxGen's vaccine
would prove totally effective. ``If it shows a measurable effect,''
then scientists would study the vaccine more intensively to
determine what component was effective in hopes of using it to
develop a stronger vaccine, Fauci said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, federal health officials are supporting research on a
number of different experimental anti-HIV vaccines, Fauci said.
</P>
<P>
   The new effort is being led by Dr. Donald Francis, a virologist
who has also conducted research on hepatitis B, Ebola and other
viruses. Genentech is the largest shareholder in VaxGen.
</P>
<P>
   Francis, VaxGen's president, said in an interview that he
followed a tradition of medical research by testing the vaccine on
himself before on others. He said the company submitted its initial
proposal on the AIDS vaccine in June 1997, a final version in April
and received approval for the large-scale trials in May.
</P>
<P>
   The new vaccine is derived from two strains of HIV instead of
the single strain used in the vaccine that was rejected four years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   The vaccine to be tested in North American is derived from two
strains of HIV prevalent in North America. The Thai vaccine
contains formulations designed to protect against two strains
prevalent there. The new vaccine induced a stronger immune response
in animals to a broader range of strains of HIV than did the
earlier vaccine, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   The first tests of the vaccine will be in five cities: Chicago,
Denver, Los Angeles, Philadelphia and St. Louis. About 300 people
are expected to participate in Denver, Dr. Franklyn Judson, the
director of the Denver Public Health Department, said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Francis declined to name the clinics in the four other cities
where tests are expected to begin this month. The tests will expand
to another 10 clinics within three months.
</P>
<P>
   Francis also declined to name the 40 cities where the study is
to take place in North America because contracts are still being
negotiated. He said it will take one year to recruit all the
participants and then three years to determine the vaccine's
effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds of the participants in the North American tests will
receive the experimental vaccine and the remaining one-third will
receive a shot containing a placebo, Francis said.
</P>
<P>
   In the Thai studies, half the group will receive the vaccine and
half a placebo. The difference is to adjust for the higher rates of
HIV infection among the Thai participants.
</P>
<P>
   HIV vaccine trials have an inherent conflict. For ethical
reasons, researchers must continuously educate participants not to
ease up on safer sex practices and other measures that can prevent
infection without a vaccine. In addition, each participant will
receive a written warning not to expect any protection from the
injections because they may have received a placebo, not the
vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   But, if participants follow such advice, the chances of
measuring the effectiveness of the vaccine are vastly reduced.
</P>
<P>
   In such trials, some participants have become HIV-infected
before they completed the full series of shots.

RUNNING BACK JOHNSON TO BE TREATED FOR CANCER 
</HEADLINE>
   (ja)  
 By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Wednesday morning at Giants Stadium, Giants Coach Jim
Fassel gathered his players around him as he always does at the
conclusion of practice, but on this occasion, Fassel did not
discuss football.
</P>
<P>
   With most players on one knee, Fassel led the team in prayer for
running back LeShon Johnson, a recent free-agent acquisition, who
Wednesday received a diagnosis of lymphoma, a form of cancer. Team
doctors detected an abnormality after a routine chest X-ray last
month and, in subsequent tests, determined that Johnson, 27, had a
cancerous tumor.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants declined to reveal the course of treatment Johnson
would receive in the coming weeks, but team officials said
privately that the preliminary opinion of Johnson's doctors was
that he would receive radiation treatments and that the prognosis
for a full recovery was good. He is not expected to have surgery. A
team doctor added that the cancer was discovered at an early stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``My doctors tell me we have a good chance to cure this,''
Johnson said in a statement released by the team. ``My family and I
believe that with the help of the doctors and with the strength of
our faith in God, we will get through this and I will be back on
the field in 1998.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson signed a free-agent contract with the Giants on March 10
and worked out regularly at Giants Stadium thereafter. There were
no symptoms of his cancer, Fassel said. Johnson participated fully
in the three-day minicamp May 4-6, a week after he had been
married. He and his wife, Nalani, have a 5-month-old son.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, the team noted Wednesday, had a chest X-ray last year
as a member of the Arizona Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was nothing unusual on that X-ray then,'' Giants General
Manager Ernie Accorsi said. ``The doctors have told us they are
optimistic they can contain this.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson will be treated by Dr. David Wolf, a hematology
oncologist at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   Giants coaches and executives were reluctant to answer questions
about Johnson's football future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our concern is his health and that he gets the best possible
treatment,'' said Fassel, who coached Johnson in 1996 when he was
the offensive coordinator in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Other team officials who asked not to be identified said that
while Johnson's chances of a full recovery were excellent, it
appeared unlikely that he would return to play this season.
</P>
<P>
   In August 1987, Karl Nelson was a star offensive lineman for the
Giants when he received a diagnosis of Hodgkin's disease, a type of
lymphoma. He missed the 1987 season and returned to play in 1988
before there was a recurrence of his cancer. Free of the disease
since 1989, Nelson retired to a career as a broadcaster and
insurance executive.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants have contacted Nelson, who was also treated by Wolf,
to enlist his aid in Johnson's treatment and recovery. ``I talk to
a lot of people who are going through this,'' Nelson said
Wednesday. ``The important thing for LeShon is that he stay
mentally tough and positive. Generally, athletes can do that
better. They are used to fighting through things _ dealing with
things when you are physically and mentally tired.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Johnson has been with the team fewer than three months,
he becomes the fifth active Giants player to have cancer in the
last 18 years. Dan Lloyd, a linebacker, had lymphatic cancer in
1980 and recovered. Running back Doug Kotar died in 1983 of a brain
tumor. John Tuggle, also a running back, died of cancer in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   After Tuggle's death, the New Jersey Sports and Exposition
Authority financed a study of the Meadowlands complex and nearly
10,000 current and former employees there. The study found there
was no conclusive link between the Giants Stadium environment and
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure that's one of the first things people said,'' Nelson
said. ``The Giants and cancer. But LeShon just got here.''
</P>
<P>
   When the team convened this week for a passing camp at Giants
Stadium, Johnson attended but was not in uniform as he awaited the
results of a biopsy. Fassel told reporters that Johnson wasn't
feeling well, unwilling to say more until there was a more
definitive diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   ``LeShon was in excellent spirits,'' said Jim Skipper, the
offensive coordinator, who also coached Johnson as an assistant in
Arizona. ``He came to all our meetings and asked questions. He
acted the same. His nature is to be positive, which should be a
major plus for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who is 6 feet and 207 pounds, played with the Cardinals
for parts of three seasons, leading the team with 634 rushing yards
in 1996. The Giants signed Johnson to add speed to a deep backfield
that includes Charles Way, Tyrone Wheatley, Tiki Barber and Gary
Brown. &QL;

Giants Are Showing They're Experts at Winning  c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Cincinnati are a chalk outline of a ballclub, one of a
growing number of anonymous teams that filter in and out of town
without leaving a single memory in their wake. To the Giants, teams
like the Reds come carrying bouquets. Teams like the Reds are the
very best guests.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants have made a living off these teams the past two
seasons. They dispatch them and move on to the next day. When
you're looking to separate teams that will contend throughout the
season from those that might, you could do worse than use games
like Tuesday night's as your guide.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants won their fifth in a row. They're 11 games over .500
_ ahead of last season's pace. They're now 11/2 games behind the
Padres in the National League West. They're showing the same kind
of stubborn professionalism they showed last season.
</P>
<P>
   Not that long ago, it seemed the Padres were going to run away
like a bunch of steroid-enhanced sprinters, never to be seen again.
</P>
<P>
   It's all great stuff, but it would be more noticeable if it
didn't seem so inevitable. The Giants have established a routine:
They win the ones they should win and then move on. They're experts
at winning games that are forgotten before the exhaust lifts from
the parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   And with the way the National League shapes up this year, with a
lot of teams like the Reds and Diamondbacks finding their way onto
the schedule, it's the best way to ensure an interesting summer.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night was the perfect night to think about nights to
come. There were about 10,000 people in the stands, and the crowd
had the knowledgeable nastiness unique to Candlestick. They gave
Danny Darwin a standing ovation when he walked off after 62/3
innings of four-hit ball, making it clear they understand what it
takes for him to keep it together that well and that long. They
gave Darryl Hamilton a standing ovation after his tremendous
running catch at the wall in the eighth inning. They harassed Reds
left fielder Chris Stynes, just because he was there.
</P>
<P>
   And if you're really insistent upon looking ahead, you could say
the Giants are a power-hitting right fielder and one late-season,
rent-an-ace starter away from taking this to the ultimate level.
</P>
<P>
   On that front, the latest round of Randy Johnson-to-the-Dodgers
rumors drifted through the clubhouse around 5:30 Tuesday night, and
there wasn't a concerned look in the place. The talk was later
silenced by both sides, but the feeling among the Giants was
exemplified by Brian Johnson, who said, ``If it happens, it'll make
this all a lot more fun.''
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen if this is the way for this team to win
the division _ the same M.O. worked last year _ but it appears to
be the way to ensure a spot in the race for the rest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Darwin was out there inning after inning, flicking the ball up
there toward the nearest available corner. Just as Bill Mueller
drops off, J.T. Snow shows his most significant signs of awakening.
But most of all, Tuesday night was Hamilton's game.
</P>
<P>
   He made a diving catch to end the top of the first. He singled
and scored in the bottom half. He homered to lead off the fifth.
Then, to beat all, he made the running catch of an Eddie Taubensee
liner at the wall in left-center to save a run in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton had a great time out there. After the eighth-inning
catch, he smiled at the fans in the bleachers, laughed with Barry
Bonds and then took a quick look over his shoulder to watch the
replay on the big screen.
</P>
<P>
   Attempting to describe his team's attitude, Dusty Baker said,
``We play everybody. Everybody is in on our victories. Everybody
contributes.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants, whether valid or not, see themselves as the
outsiders in the National League West. It's an odd identity for a
defending champion to adopt, but it's the same one that worked last
year.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants get a lot of credit for playing hard and playing with
intensity, and Baker rightfully gets considerable credit for
instilling those qualities. But there's another way to think about
this: Why wouldn't this particular group play hard and with
intensity?
</P>
<P>
   This seems to cut to the root of their success. Aside from Barry
Bonds and now Robb Nen, this isn't a group that can afford to be
comfortable. The mix is young guys attempting to prove themselves
star-worthy (Bill Mueller, Shawn Estes), established veterans who
constantly push to prove themselves (Darry Hamilton, Charlie Hayes,
Kirk Rueter, Brian Johnson), borderline guys who are getting the
chance of a lifetime (Rich Rodriguez, Rich Aurilia, Chris Jones)
and old guys who are here because they like the atmosphere and want
one more chance to win (Orel Hershiser, Danny Darwin).
</P>
<P>
   It's not the Orioles or the Dodgers, which means the team
doesn't come equipped with the violent mood swings of the teams
that are predominantly ego-driven.
</P>
<P>
   Put it another way: They're as blue-collar as a room filled with
millionaires can be.

SURGING GIANTS LOOKING MORE LIKE '97 EVERY DAY 
BY HENRY SCHULMAN
</HEADLINE>
   c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
   Reds catcher Eddie Taubensee hit a two-run homer off Danny
Darwin of the Giants in the first inning Tuesday night. Thus, the
Giants had the Reds right where they wanted them.
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's uncanny how the Giants seem willing to spot their opponents
runs at the outset the way kindergarten teachers hand out milk
tickets, only to come back and win. It happened in Monday night's
16-3 rout, it happened in Tuesday night's 4-2 victory and it's
happened several times before. The Giants have won 35 games this
year. Seventeen have been comebacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't like getting behind, but certainly it happens,''
Giants manager Dusty Baker said. ``These guys don't worry when they
get behind, especially early. This team is really positive in that
respect.''
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to be positive when the offense is working like it
should.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Bonds had two hits and an RBI, and Jeff Kent had a single
and an RBI. But Tuesday night's game was marked by production from
unlikely sources, a hallmark of last year's division-title team.
</P>
<P>
   Darryl Hamilton hit his first homer of the season to tie the
game 2-2 in the fifth inning after reading in the paper that no
other Giants regular has gone longer without one. Later in the
inning, J.T. Snow ripped a two-out single to right that drove in
the go-ahead run, a positive sign in his bid to reach .200.
</P>
<P>
   Bonds' run-scoring single in the sixth, scoring Brent Mayne, who
had doubled, produced the 4-2 final. The Giants won their fifth in
a row, improving to 5-1 on a homestand that ends today, took their
14th in the last 17 games at home and moved within 11/2 games of
the first-place San Diego Padres, the closest they have been to the
division lead since April 9.
</P>
<P>
   The key Tuesday night was the ability of Darwin (5-3) to shut
down the Reds after allowing the two first-inning runs. After that,
he blanked them for 52/3 innings, even surviving rare back-to-back
errors by himself and Kent that put two Reds on to start of the
fifth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Reed, Rich Rodriguez and Robb Nen, who earned his 15th
save, also kept Cincinnati off the board, Rodriguez benefiting from
Hamilton's fine running catch of a long drive to center that robbed
Taubensee of an RBI in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're playing good baseball,'' Baker said. ``Despite the three
errors we made, we put pressure on them and came away with the
victory.''
</P>
<P>
   While Tuesday night's game was certainly more sanguine than
Monday night's 16-3 carnival, it did not start out that way as the
Reds scored twice in the first on Taubensee's homer and the Giants
got a run back on Hamilton's single, a Bill Mueller grounder that
pushed him to second and Kent's single through the left side of the
infield.
</P>
<P>
   Darwin and Reds starter Scott Winchester then engaged in a
standoff until Hamilton's leadoff homer in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton had gone 190 at-bats without a homer, going back to
last September 19, a fact he read in yesterday's paper.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was nice after all the pressure that's been on me the last
few days,'' he said. ``Everybody had one and I didn't have one. I
almost felt left out. I wasn't brought here to hit home runs. I was
brought here to get on base and score runs. I know my job is not to
hit home runs, but it's fun to hit one.''
</P>
<P>
   While Winchester gave, Darwin did not. He pitched a scoreless
sixth and left in the seventh with two out and a runner on second.
Darwin looked more like the pitcher who had a 16-inning scoreless
streak last month than the one who was shelled for seven runs in
each of his two previous starts. His trip back to Texas to watch
his daughter graduate from high school on Saturday must have done
him some good.
</P>
<P>
   And, at 42, Darwin proved that his reflexes are still OK when he
speared a wicked liner through the box by Willie Greene to end the
sixth inning. As Darwin walked off the field, the pitcher who was
drilled in the knee by a line drive in spring training and in the
breadbasket during his first start of the year simply said,
``Wow.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That,'' he said later, ``might have hurt.

49ERS ARE IN NO RUSH OVER RICE THIS TIME 
BY IRA MILLER
</HEADLINE>
   c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA CLARA, Calif. _ Jerry Rice is finding his second comeback
taking longer than his first, and he is anxious to speed it up. In
the long run, though, he might be better off because he is taking
it slowly.
</P>
<P>
   Although Rice and 49ers coach Steve Mariucci insist they have no
regret over Rice's rush back to the field last December, just 31/2
months after major knee surgery, they are pursuing a much more
measured pace with his rehabilitation from the second operation.
</P>
<P>
   It is now nearly six months, and even in a no-pads, no-contact
minicamp like the one the team is holding this week, Rice runs his
pass patterns mostly against the air. He is held out of full team
drills, just running his routes and working on timing with the
quarterbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to do a little more, but Steve is being very
cautious, and he's really driving me crazy, too, because I believe
in practicing and getting yourself ready,'' Rice said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Mariucci says he is handling it that way because there is no
urgency: The season does not begin for more than three months. Left
unsaid is that, as remarkable as it was for Rice to return during
the 1997 season, it became somewhat of a hollow accomplishment when
he was reinjured before halftime in his first game back.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, even Rice says now, ``I wouldn't change that for
the world, just to be able to run back on that field again. That
night, the atmosphere was unbelievable.'' And Mariucci says he
won't second-guess the decision, either.
</P>
<P>
   But this time, it is clear there is a different plan. Rice has
the entire offseason to get ready, and the 49ers are making sure he
uses it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no choice,'' he said. ``Steve's controlling everything.
If it was left up to me, I would probably take the same approach
(as last time). But everything is going to work out. I feel like
I'm getting stronger day by day and it's just a matter of time
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice has been running _ and running fast, but he acknowledges
his surgical left knee is not yet at full strength. He said it
feels good, especially since two irritating screws were removed in
a procedure last month. But he admits he still does not have full
confidence in the knee and needs to strengthen the muscles around
it.
</P>
<P>
   Until last September, Rice never had suffered a major football
injury. Now he has gone under the knife three times: the two
operations and the screw-removal procedure which, while technically
minor, Rice called the most painful of them all because he did it
under only a local anesthetic.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you sustain an injury like that, you have a tendency to
favor that injury,'' Rice said. ``Basically, I'm going to try to
fight through that. I think it's all about confidence. If you can
gain confidence in that knee again, you're not going to think about
it; you just go out there and react.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, I'm looking forward to that first hit, and
hopefully I can jump up from it and go back to the huddle.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been expected Rice will be ready when training camp
begins for the veterans on July 21. With five exhibition games,
however, Mariucci might continue to hold Rice back until sometime
in August. As usual, Rice wants to play as much as he can. He is so
anxious to do more than he is doing that, at one point, he lined up
on defense and ran step-for-step down the field with wide receiver
J.J. Stokes.
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, it is clear the 49ers are counting on Rice's return
for the season. Mariucci and quarterback Steve Young talk of making
frequent use of three-wideout formations, not just on third down.
Young wants to see the 49ers' offense become more aggressive,
especially on first downs.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Young said he expects Rice will be 100 percent by September
``because I don't know how else to think about him.'' But he
strayed from the company line on another topic. With the hindsight
of history, Young questioned the wisdom of Rice's rapid return last
year, saying, ``Everybody got really hyped up about the moment, but
clearly, probably, should have used a little more time.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, Rice is using the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see any reason why I can't come back and do the things
I'm accustomed to doing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;   &LR;   &UR; Doleman Absent: &LR;  Defensive end Chris Doleman, who agreed
to a restructured contract last month, is absent from the minicamp.
That was one of his conditions for accepting the deal.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  ``He had some golf plans, I think,'' said vice president
Dwight Clark.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Money Matters:  &LR; The 49ers are about $870,000 under the salary
cap limit, so they'll need to clear about $1.4 million more to sign
their draft choices. The 49ers' rookie salary pool is $2,294,831,
although they do not have to spend it all. Negotiations with the
draft choices have not started yet.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;   &UR; Ailing:  &LR; Jamie Brown, the recently acquired left tackle,
strained a calf muscle while working out last week, so he's not
practicing in the mini-camp. Two other veteran linemen, Harris
Barton and Frank Pollack, still are on the mend from surgeries. So
is defensive end Gabe Wilkins, an offseason acquisition, and free
safety Merton Hanks.

APARTHEID-ERA CRIMINAL TESTIFIES AT BOTHA TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By SUZANNE DALEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   GEORGE, South Africa _ One of apartheid's most notorious killers
took the witness stand Wednesday to say he was rewarded with rare
medals and congratulated by generals and at least one Cabinet
minister for his work in killing political opponents.
</P>
<P>
   The former police colonel, Eugene de Kock _ who is serving two
life sentences and 212 years for six murders and a host of other
crimes, most of which he says he committed under orders _ testified
in the contempt trial of former President P.W. Botha, who says he
never sanctioned such activities.
</P>
<P>
   Botha is on trial for ignoring subpoenas to appear before the
Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which is investigating South
Africa's brutal past. The 82-year-old Botha has called the panel a
circus, saying he will answer only to God for his deeds.
</P>
<P>
   But if he hoped to avoid political theater he appears to have
miscalculated. While the issue may be whether Botha is compelled to
appear before the commission, the prosecution has offered a small
parade of witnesses in the last three days who have made the horror
and pain of the government's covert operations come to life.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, the prosecution has concentrated on Botha's role
in the bombing of a church building in Johannesburg in 1988, an
attack that injured 21 people. One of Botha's former Cabinet
ministers has said that Botha personally ordered him to destroy the
building. The prosecution has called victims of the explosion and
de Kock, who carried out the assignment.
</P>
<P>
   Botha's lawyers have objected to the testimony as irrelevant.
But the judge, Victor Lugaju, has allowed it, saying it was
important that information about the bombing of the church
building, known as Khotso House, be heard.
</P>
<P>
   Botha, who sits on a special padded seat outside the dock
because of hip replacement, appeared to clench his jaw at times
during de Kock's testimony, and to studiously avoid eye contact
with him.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Tuesday, a security guard who was sucked into the basement
during the blast described his terror as the walls crumbled around
him. And the Rev. Peter Storey told how elderly and mentally
disabled residents of the building across the street staggered from
their rooms bleeding from glass and other shrapnel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a scene out of hell,'' said Storey, whose church owned
the apartment building. ``Utter devastation. I've never seen
anything like it.''
</P>
<P>
   De Kock testified that as a specialist in covert operations he
was called in by a police general to blow up Khotso House after a
local police effort failed. Local police had tried to use land
mines but apparently the grocery bags carrying the explosives to
the underground parking garage burst and the mines rolled down the
street.
</P>
<P>
   De Kock was experienced in blowing up buildings. He had blown up
a building belonging to the African National Congress in London in
1981. For that, he received a medla, the Star of Excellence, which
was usually given only to generals and which required the approval
of Botha.
</P>
<P>
   De Kock described how his men planted the mines and intended to
kill anyone who got in the way, including, if need be, other police
officers who stumbled on to their operation. He cleared this with
his commanding officer, he said.
</P>
<P>
   De Kock testified that he believed low-level operatives like
himself had been ``hung out to dry'' by politicians such as Botha
who have repeatedly maintained that they knew nothing of ``dirty
tricks'' operations. During Botha's period in office between 1978
and 1989, thousands of political activists and family members were
tortured or killed by security forces.
</P>
<P>
   But many former Cabinet members have said that terms like
eliminate, neutralize and remove permanently from society _ phrases
that have been found in policy documents approved by Botha and his
inner circle _ did not mean kill. De Kock said such assertions were
nonsense. Politicians who said such things ``want to eat lamb but
don't want to see blood and guts,'' he said. ``They're cowards.''
</P>
<P>
   The head of the Truth Commission, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, also
took the stand Wednesday to deny Botha's claim that he ever made a
deal allowing Botha to avoid a public appearance before the
commission in exchange for answers he gave in writing to commission
questions. Ignoring usual court protocol, Tutu began by making a
statement that he was pained to find himself in court. ``I stand
here with the greatest possible reluctance and filled with
considerable distaste,'' Tutu said.
</P>
<P>
   Tutu, in often passionate tones, testified that he had gone out
of his way to accommodate Botha and show him that he would be
treated with dignity if he came before the commission, but to no
avail. Tutu said he would still be willing to ask the prosecutor to
drop the charges if Botha changed his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not seeking to humiliate him and I am not seeking to set
him up,'' the bishop said.

LEGEND OF SECRETARIAT'S TRIPLE CROWN RUN REVIVED BY REAL QUIET'S
BID 
BY DAVID EINSTEIN
</HEADLINE>
 QUIET-SFCHRON   c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Belmont Stakes on Saturday will generate more than ordinary
interest, because one of the horses, Real Quiet, has a chance to
become the first Triple Crown winner since Affirmed in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   But for me, and I suspect for many, many others, the race will
be run in the shadow of what happened 25 years ago, when the great
Secretariat turned the Triple Crown into a tour de force and won
the Belmont by an unheard-of 31 lengths.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, 1973 was a lousy year. The Vietnam War was
essentially over, but the wounds it had inflicted on the American
psyche still festered. Five original defendants in the Watergate
break-in pleaded guilty and began to spill the beans on Nixon.
Spiro Agnew resigned the vice presidency and pleaded no-contest to
tax evasion. Israel and its Arab neighbors duked it out in the Yom
Kippur War, and the Arabs retaliated against American support for
Israel with an oil embargo that plunged us into an energy crisis.
</P>
<P>
   When I look back on 1973, however, the picture that emerges is
of a chestnut colt in blue- and white-checkered blinders thundering
at 38 miles an hour and blowing the bad memories aside like autumn
leaves in Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came around when we needed him,'' one observer wrote in an
America Online message board set up last month for the silver
anniversary of Secretariat's Triple Crown.
</P>
<P>
   The son of Bold Ruler out of Somethingroyal, Secretariat seemed
predestined to become the monarch of the sport of kings. By the age
of 2, he was the size of a 3-year-old, with a barrel chest and
perfect legs. Naturally they called him Big Red.
</P>
<P>
   If he was breathtaking standing still, Secretariat left people
gasping when he ran. Combining power and poetic rhythm with a an
irrepressible joie de vivre, he fashioned a record of 16 victories
in 21 starts that put him in the company of Citation and Man O'War.
Many call him the greatest horse of all.
</P>
<P>
   How impressive was Secretariat on the track? The late
sportswriter Red Smith once asked Charlie Hatton, the trainer, how
Secretariat had done in his morning workout. ``The trees swayed,''
Hatton replied.
</P>
<P>
   Secretariat, who had been named horse of the year after his
first season in 1972, won the 1973 Kentucky Derby in record time,
and nearly set a record in winning the Preakness.
</P>
<P>
   In the Derby, he came from last place to take the lead in the
stretch. Astonishingly, he ran each quarter-mile faster than the
previous one. In the Preakness, he pulled off a risky maneuver by
passing the pack wide at the first turn and never looked back.
</P>
<P>
   Those performances in the first two legs of the Triple Crown
captured the public's imagination. In one week, Secretariat
appeared on the covers of Time, Newsweek and Sports Illustrated,
and the Belmont Stakes _ the final leg of the Triple Crown _ was
anticipated more as a coronation than a contest.
</P>
<P>
   With nearly 70,000 fans in attendance at Belmont Park and
millions more watching on TV, Secretariat broke lackadaisically
from the gate on the afternoon of June 9. Ron Turcotte, who rode
him in 18 of his 21 races, including all three in the Triple Crown,
said it was not necessary to push him. ``He was a good breaker,''
the jockey said. ``I never tried to make him lead. I just gave him
time at the start to get his legs under him.''
</P>
<P>
   Midway through the back stretch, Secretariat made his move, and
you could see Sham, the only horse in the five-horse field given
any chance against him, sag visibly. The race was over, and all
that was left was for Secretariat to gallop into the realm of myth.
</P>
<P>
   Coming around the final turn Big Red pulled away handily, and
down the stretch he widened the lead with every stride. He put the
length of a football field between himself and the field and was
still gaining at the end.
</P>
<P>
   A famous photo shows Turcotte turning his head to look back as
he crosses the finish line. ``I just had to turn around,'' he said.
``I kept hearing the announcer saying how far ahead we were, and I
had to look for myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Turcotte, who won 3,033 races in his career, including 14 aboard
Secretariat, did not need much expertise for this race.
Essentially, he was just along for the ride, never once using his
whip. ``He was running on his own,'' Turcotte said. ``If I asked
him to go harder through the stretch, I don't know how fast he
would have gone.''
</P>
<P>
   It was arguably the greatest two-plus minutes in the history of
sports, rivaled perhaps only by Joe Louis' first-round knockout of
Hitler's Aryan standard-bearer Max Schmeling at Yankee Stadium in
1938.
</P>
<P>
   Secretariat's winning time of two minutes and 24 seconds still
stands as a record for a 11/2-mile dirt track. Sham, who might have
achieved glory in a different year, finished fifth and never raced
again, his spirit shattered.
</P>
<P>
   The impression left by Secretariat's magnificent performance was
considerable _ the sort of once-in-a-lifetime experience you relate
to your grandchildren with a faraway look in your eyes and a lump
in your throat. Some 5,300 winning tickets went unclaimed, becoming
souvenirs and proof that their holders had been there.
</P>
<P>
   Secretariat would run six more races, winning four. At his final
appearance, in the Woodbine Canadian International, the track
announcer, departing from the traditional call of ``Ladies and
Gentlemen, the horses are on the track,'' said instead, ``The horse
is on the track.''
</P>
<P>
   Syndicated for more than $6 million, an astronomical figure for
the time, Secretariat was retired to stud at Claiborne Farm in
Paris, Ky. There he sired 663 offspring, 46 percent of whom won
races. One, Risen Star, took both the Preakness and the Belmont in
1988.
</P>
<P>
   Even in retirement, Secretariat remained a star. More than 8,500
people visited him each year at Claiborne, watching him frolic and
perhaps having the chance to pet him or give him a handful of grass
_ the horse-world equivalent of getting an autograph.
</P>
<P>
   ``People loved to come see him, it was exciting,'' said Gus
Koch, longtime assistant manager at Claiborne. ``The horse had such
presence. He was the king and he knew it.''
</P>
<P>
   Koch recalls one time a car pulled up late in the afternoon with
a family who had come to see Secretariat. Koch told them visiting
hours were over, but they persisted. ``They said they'd driven all
the way from Michigan,'' he said, ``so I told them, OK, come on,
let's go see him.''
</P>
<P>
   Turcotte visited Claiborne once just before the Kentucky Derby
in 1977. The following year, he would be paralyzed in a fall at the
Belmont and confined to a wheelchair. Today he lives in a little
town in New Brunswick on the east side of his native Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stood at the fence and called to him, saying `Come over
here, Big Red,''' Turcotte recalls. ``It seemed as if he recognized
me. He put his head on my shoulder.''
</P>
<P>
   Secretariat was euthanized in October 1989 at the age of 19,
victim of an incurable hoof disease. The autopsy revealed that his
heart was twice normal size. That didn't surprise anybody.
</P>
<P>
   A true measure of greatness is the ability to transcend
generations, and Secretariat has that magic. Folks still place
flowers on his grave, and youngsters who were not alive at the time
marvel at the power and the beauty he conveyed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I could have been born earlier,'' said one young fan on
AOL's message board. ``I would have given anything to see that
horse run.''

 &HT;    BellSouth today offers an option to cable, satellite
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- BellSouth Corp. today will launch a wireless
television service that will serve much of metro Atlanta, a
160-channel, digital offering that pits the phone company against
established cable providers.
</P>
<P>
   The service, beamed from four towers in and around the city, is
available immediately to 700,000 households _ about half the
households in metro Atlanta _ with plans for expansion in the
months to come, said John Hartman, vice president of BellSouth
Entertainment, the unit offering the service.
</P>
<P>
   The move makes Atlanta one of the few cities in the nation where
consumers can choose between rival cable television providers. But
some entrenched cable companies are planning their own
counterattack by upgrading their networks. Moreover, MediaOne has
started offering phone service in some parts of Atlanta and
Norcross, challenging the phone monopoly held by BellSouth.
</P>
<P>
   The wireless offering can be seen as a pre-emptive strike by
BellSouth, since cable company upgrades are time-consuming and
costly, requiring construction and visits to new customers.
BellSouth only has to send technicians to a customer's home or
apartment to install wireless cable. They will put a receiver on
the roof or in a tree, then run a cable into the home and to its
televisions.
</P>
<P>
   MediaOne, the largest area cable provider with 540,000
customers, is spending $400 million to add broad-band service while
awaiting the entry of BellSouth, said company spokesman Dave Wood.
``We are certainly ready to meet them head on. I think we've had
more time in the business with a proven technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone in metro Atlanta can receive wireless service.
Homes blocked from transmission by hills or large buildings, and
even homes that are too close to broadcast towers, will not get the
service. On the other hand, the service can be delivered to
isolated homes that would be expensive to serve with wired cable.
BellSouth has a license to provide service within a 35-mile radius
of the NationsBank building in Atlanta, where one broadcast tower
is placed.
</P>
<P>
   Other towers are in Peachtree City, Stone Mountain and Sweat
Mountain in Marietta. BellSouth decided to limit the service's
availability at first, largely because the company fears being
faced with demand it cannot meet. Even so, BellSouth expects a slew
of orders and has hired several hundred technicians, Hartman said.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for company and customers alike, the areas where
the service is available at first do not follow a neat geographic
pattern. BellSouth said it cannot precisely describe which homes
can sign up for the service _ setting the stage for some consumer
confusion.
</P>
<P>
   About 75 percent of Atlanta households now receive television
either by cable or satellite broadcast. Hartman declined to say how
much of the market BellSouth expects to capture, except to say,
``We expect to be a very major player in the home entertainment
business.''
</P>
<P>
   He agreed that 30 percent of the market would make BellSouth a
major player, representing more than 200,000 households and annual
revenue of well over $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on which plan a customers chooses, BellSouth's service
costs between $60 and $200 to install and $40 a month for basic
service to two televisions.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth intends to lure customers not with price but with the
promise of a the crystal clear picture of a digital broadcast and
an array of choices, including up to 50 pay-per-view channels _
features far beyond what most cable companies offer. And while
satellite offers high-quality pictures and a variety of channels,
it has no local programming. BellSouth will deliver local broadcast
channels.
</P>
<P>
   Few consumers connect the BellSouth name with television, but
the company hopes to capitalize on its reputation as a dependable
provider of phone service. By contrast, cable companies have
struggled to overcome a legacy of customer dissatisfaction. More
than anything else, BellSouth must overcome the tendency of
consumers to stick with whatever they do now for television _
whether cable, satellite or rabbit ears, Hartman said. ``From my
perspective our largest competitor is inertia.''
</P>
<P>
   Several thousand people _ mostly BellSouth employees _ are
already testing the service. But one tester is telecommunications
analyst Jeff Kagan, who said he found the service ``awesome'' but
challenging. Accustomed to an old-style remote, Kagan said it took
some time to learn how to use the controls needed for to customize
directories, block inappropriate shows for children and order
pay-per-view. ``Moving to the BellSouth entertainment remote from a
cable remote is like moving from a dashboard of a Geo Metro to an
F-14 fighter jet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth now offers wireless cable in New Orleans, competing
with an established cable operation run by Cox Communications,
which is majority owned by Cox Enterprises, owner of The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution. Later this year, BellSouth plans to offer
wireless service in Dayton, Jacksonville and Orlando.

STOCKS DECLINE AMID CONCERNS ABOUT TECHNOLOGY ISSUES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By SHARON R. KING   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Resilient concerns about weakness in the technology
sector pushed stocks lower Wednesday, with the Nasdaq composite
index falling more than 1 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average
was down 87.44 for the day.
</P>
<P>
   The declines among technology shares contributed to a late-day
selling spree that spread throughout the market. It was exacerbated
by a wave of computer-generated sell programs, which were
responsible for chopping more than 93 points off the Dow.
</P>
<P>
   Intel Corp., the bellwether semiconductor issue, led the
declines among technology issues. It fell 3 5/16, to 65 15/16, its
lowest level since April 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The stock came under pressure after a research analyst, Robert
Chaplinsky of the Hambrecht &AMP; Quist Group, lowered his
second-quarter earnings estimate due to expectations of slowing
sales abroad.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, traders said, a rumor that Intel would warn that
the April-June quarter earnings could disappoint _ coming in at 65
cents a share compared with the 70 cents widely forecast _
contributed to the decline.
</P>
<P>
   Intel's problems illustrated investors' persistent concerns
about the technology sector. Worries about the impact of Asia's
financial crisis on earnings as well as dampening domestic consumer
demand have pressured chipmakers, computer companies such as Dell
Computer and software companies such as Hewlett-Packard.
</P>
<P>
   Investors are worried that disappointing earnings from
technology shares, which have been among the leaders of the current
rally, could signal similar declines in other sectors, said Anthony
Conroy, a managing director for Bankers Trust Global Investment
Management in New York. Such concerns have heightened investors'
unwillingness to buy stocks, cotinuing a recent trend in which
early market gains evaporate into declines by the day's end.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still a kind of skittish market and there's no real
trend,'' said Charles W. Washington, head equity trader for
Blaylock &AMP; Partners in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market is not capitalizing on the good news,'' said
William E. Barker Jr., chief investment strategist at Dain
Rauscher. He noted that recent planned merger deals such as Tellabs
purchase of Ciena and American Home Products' coupling with
Monsanto have failed to excite investors and cause strong gains in
those stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow, which traded higher briefly during the day, closed down
87.44 points, at 8,803.80. One sell program during the last 40
minutes of trading took 80 points off the blue-chip index,
according to to Birinyi Associates, a Greenwich, Conn.-based
research firm.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index fell 10.49 points and the Nasdaq
plunged 19.48 points, to 1,761.79, a 1.11 percent decline.
</P>
<P>
   However, the long-term sentiment remains bullish with analysts
like Goldman Sachs' Abby Joseph Cohen forecasting that earnings
growth will resume later in the year and propel stock prices
higher.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks are currently priced at fair value, Mrs. Cohen said in a
recent market comment. The current climate of low interest rates
and attractive fundamentals, such as the federal budget surplus,
well-managed corporations and solid financial institutions will be
the catalysts to push prices higher, she said.
</P>
<P>
   And investors like Barker and Alan Bond, chief investment
officer at Bond Procope Capital Management said they are ready to
pick up stocks like Intel if their prices continue to fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Intel looks pretty cheap here,'' said Bond, who recently sold
some shares of the stock at a price above $80 a share.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be a buyer on weakness, but I would make darn sure the
company has visible earnings growth and a reasonable valuation,''
said Barker.

FINALS IS REMATCH OF AGE, WISDOM 
BY DAVID STEELE
</HEADLINE>
   c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Salt Lake City _ The teams are the same, and most of the names
are the same. The question now, as the NBA Finals begin Wednesday
night, is whether the games will be the same.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago Bulls and Utah Jazz meet again to decide the
championship _ the 11th rematch in Finals history and the first
since 1988 and '89, when the Lakers defeated the Pistons and lost
to them the following year. The major players have not changed
since last year, when the Bulls defeated the Jazz in six games. The
featured performers are still Michael Jordan, Karl Malone, Scottie
Pippen, John Stockton, Dennis Rodman and coaches Phil Jackson and
Jerry Sloan. The home-court advantage belongs to the Jazz this
time, which means the first two and last two games (if necessary)
will be at the Delta Center.
</P>
<P>
   However, this year is not like last year. Both teams, among the
most experienced (a kind euphemism for ``old'') in the NBA, are a
year older. The Jazz are no longer newcomers to the increased
pressure and heightened attention from fans and media the Bulls are
accustomed to.
</P>
<P>
   And in several major areas, the Jazz are more intact from last
season. The Bulls are missing two key players whose absence will be
felt greatly. Center Brian Williams and forward Jason Caffey were
far from All-Stars; they were not even starters. But they were big
bodies who could help defend Malone and keep him from running wild
inside.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping Malone in check is as critical to the Bulls' chances as
controlling Jordan is to the Jazz's. Now the Bulls are left with
Luc Longley _ whom Jackson said Tuesday is his first choice _ and
Rodman, who once again has the potential to be more sideshow than
solid contributor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dennis will be matched up with him at times, but that's out of
necessity. Our main guy has always been Longley,'' Jackson said.
``Dennis takes the also-rans and does the help defense and the
rebounding.'' That comment could be just another tactic to prod the
flighty Rodman, but based on Rodman's disinterested, distracted
performance in last year's Finals, it holds a germ of truth.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Rodman griped again about officiating and Jackson's
decision to bring him off the bench in the previous series against
Indiana. ``It's just very difficult to play when you can't play.
You get into foul trouble, you come off the bench, you're back on
the bench, come off the bench,'' he said. ``Hopefully, this year
will be a lot different for me in the Finals.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, a late-season pickup last year, was the inside
presence at both ends that the Bulls needed to neutralize Malone in
the Finals; however, with the Bulls limited in what they could
offer him to retain him as a free agent, he left for substantially
more money with the Pistons last summer. Caffey played only 17
minutes total in the Finals last year but probably would have
played more this time around _ except that general manager Jerry
Krause inexplicably traded the free-agent-to-be to the Warriors in
February for two second-round picks and David Vaughn, whom they cut
a week later. Asked late in the season why he thought the Bulls
would give him away like that, Caffey shook his head and said,
``You tell me. I don't understand it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jazz, meanwhile, come in with the same players playing the
same roles as last June. Once again, small forward Bryon Russell
(11.9 points, 49.5 percent shooting) and center Greg Ostertag (4.6
rebounds, 2.57 blocked shots a game in just 20 minutes) have
stepped up in the playoffs after mediocre regular seasons. Shandon
Anderson (who missed most of the Finals last year after his father
died) and Chris Morris also have turned in strong performances off
the bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, I see it as a lot better than last year,'' Russell
said, comparing the Jazz's two Finals berths, ``because we're
getting more support, not just from me but from everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Most important, the Jazz are a year older but a year wiser about
the Finals experience. ``Last year we came in and were too happy.
This year we're more relaxed,'' Russell said.
</P>
<P>
   Malone agrees, about his team and himself. He admitted he might
have pressed too much last year after winning the Most Valuable
Player award; his bad free-throw shooting all but sealed the Jazz's
losses in games 1 and 6 in Chicago. ``I don't know what kind of
attitude I have; it's not an excitement attitude, and it's not an
`I don't care' attitude,'' he said. ``It's kind of in the middle,
and sometimes I feel like I play my best when I have that feeling
or that kind of attitude.''

TWINS JUMP ON A'S EARLY IN ROUT 
BY STEVE KETTMANN
</HEADLINE>
   c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Minneapolis _ The Minnesota Twins made their 10-3 win over the
A's look so easy, it wouldn't have been surprising to see Twins
third baseman Brent Gates trot onto the field wearing a big pink
bubble-gum bubble stuck to the top of his batting helmet.
</P>
<P>
   During Monday night's game, TV cameras had shown Gates strolling
around the Twins dugout, unaware that a mischievous teammate had
stuck a bubble to his cap. The gag might have helped Gates, a
former A's second baseman. He tied a career high Tuesday with four
hits _ three in the first three innings when the Twins scored eight
runs off starter Tom Candiotti _ and lifted his average 40 points
to .181.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know who did it yet,'' Gates said of the gag. ``You
have to have fun. We have a great bunch of guys here. I got off to
a slow start this year. It's just something I think will turn
around.''
</P>
<P>
   The A's were having a bad enough day even before reliever Dave
Telgheder sprained his knee fielding Otis Nixon's little nubber in
the fifth. Telgheder's spikes caught in the turf enough to put
unusual stress on the knee. Depending on the results of an MRI
today in Oakland, he's likely to go on the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of those freak things, I guess,'' Telgheder said.
</P>
<P>
   Candiotti (4-6) has been a good addition to the A's staff this
year, but lately he's been struggling. The Twins clobbered him for
eight runs in just 22/3 innings, the second-worst showing of
Candiotti's 15-year big-league career. In his worst, he gave up 10
runs in four innings against the Giants at Candlestick in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Since May 1, Candiotti has just one win against three losses. He
has an 8.51 ERA in those games and has lasted five innings or less
in four straight games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to find a way to get him turned around,'' A's
manager Art Howe said. ``I don't know what we can do. This is the
second time he had extra time between starts and he wasn't sharp. I
was told in warm-ups he had a good knuckleball going. It seemed
like everything fell in.''
</P>
<P>
   The Twins piled up eight hits against Candiotti, but it wasn't
as if they were all rockets. Nixon led off the first with a bounder
up the middle that second baseman Scott Spiezio gloved, but he had
no chance to get the speedy Nixon. All it took after that for the
Twins to throw up three runs in the inning was a Gates single
followed by a Paul Molitor double and three groundouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looked like they were just trying to make contact,''
Candiotti said. ``You look at the lineup they put out there. Otis
Nixon is a perfect example of a guy who just tries to put the bat
on the ball and run.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not that Candiotti isn't concerned. But at 40, he knows
that shrugging off a bad stretch is a big part of turning it around
on the field. The ups and downs are what get to you, especially
when you're young.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you go bad, you can just mentally kill yourself,'' he
said. ``The results to me haven't been good. But my approach isn't
going to change. I'm sure if this were my first year or two in the
big leagues, my confidence might be affected. But when I go good, I
go good, and when I go bad, I go extremely bad.''

IN THE BANKBOSTON DEAL, MONEY WAS EVERYTHING FOR SANDY 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARK VEVERKA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
Sandy Robertson's 11th-hour negotiations to stay aboard the
BankBoston gravy train produced a higher contract offer, but it
wasn't enough to keep him in the deal.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sources close to the talks between BankBoston and the investment
bank that Robertson co-founded say his proposed ``personal
side-deal'' threw a wrench into the works shortly before the buyout
was slated to be finalized.
</P>
<P>
   Around 4 a.m. last Friday, BankBoston announced that it agreed
to buy Robertson Stephens from BankAmerica for about $800 million.
</P>
<P>
   But it was a story leaked to the Wall Street Journal published
Thursday that raised hackles at BankBoston headquarters, sources
say. The Journal reported that BankBoston was buying the investment
bank and also revealed that Sandy Robertson, instead of remaining
with the firm after the sale, was going to start his own investment
bank.
</P>
<P>
   More important, perhaps, was the story's suggestion that
Robertson Stephens might fetch a lower price because Robertson was
no longer going to work for it.
</P>
<P>
   To their chagrin, BankBoston's board of directors saw their deal
exposed in the paper before getting to sip their Thursday morning
coffee. Later that day, they were scheduled to give a thumbs-up to
the bank's tentative agreement to buy Robby Stephens.
</P>
<P>
   Sources contend that Robertson, or associates of his, wanted the
story in the Journal so that he could squeeze more money and
authority for himself out of BankBoston. At that point in the
negotiations, Robertson had been offered$5 million over three
years, and he was asking for $15 million, sources say. Robertson
denies that he planted the story.
</P>
<P>
   Understandably, the BankBoston directors and officers weren't
thrilled that their buyout plans had been spilled to the papers.
But &UR;  &LR; the board told BankBoston Vice Chairman Paul Hogan and
President Henrique Meirelles to go ahead and ``work out their Sandy
deal,'' a source says.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; So with their marching orders in hand, they hopped on a plane
for San Francisco immediately after the board meeting adjourned
Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Later that day, a meeting was held to announce the buyout to
Robertson Stephens employees.
</P>
<P>
   But bankers on both coasts continued to work through the night
to iron out the deal.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Sandy Robertson rejected BankBoston's final offer.
He would not reveal the size of it, but sources say it was about
$10 million.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson says the Journal article ``did precipitate a very
generous offer from (BankBoston). It was a huge offer. But it was a
different kind of offer'' than the original one presented to him by
Meirelles early last week.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson, who is 67 and hasn't been running the investment bank
for a few years, says he plans to ``do some kind of offshoot'' but
wouldn't call it an investment bank.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Robertson has a no-compete clause with BankAmerica,
but as most lawyers in this state will tell you, they are difficult
to enforce in California.
</P>
<P>
   NO. 2 REDUX
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco is playing second fiddle to Charlotte ... again.
First, it was the battle for the corporate headquarters of the
merged NationsBank-BankAmerica. Now, it's the right to host a
global economic gabfest, er, business conference.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that the North Carolina metropolis beat out our
fine city as the location for next year's Trans-Atlantic Business
Dialogue conference. The news was released (where else?) yesterday
at NationsBank headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Topping the guest list is President Clinton. But I don't see
what the big deal is. It seems like the president is in the Bay
Area every other week passing the fund-raising hat for somebody.
</P>
<P>
   CORRECTION
</P>
<P>
   The leveraged buyout of Northwest Airlines led by Gary Wilson
and Al Checchi occurred in 1989. Monday's column incorrectly stated
the year as 1987.
</P>
<P>
   And as for whether Mr. Checchi should receive credit for turning
around the airline, that could be debated at length.
</P>
<P>
   But airline analyst Michael Boyd in Golden, Colo., makes this
point: Checchi and Wilson hired current chief executive John
Dasburg, who has successfully recast Northwest into a profitable
and successful carrier. ``They did one thing: They brought in
someone who could run the airline,'' Boyd says.

to iron out the Sandy deal.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Sandy Robertson rejected BankBoston's final offer.
He would not reveal the size of it, but sources say it was around
$10 million.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson says the Journal article ``did precipitate a very
generous offer from (BankBoston). It was a huge offer. But it was a
different kind of offer'' than the original one presented to him by
Meirelles early last week.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson, who is 67 and hasn't been running the investment bank
for a few years, says he plans to ``do some kind of offshoot'' but
wouldn't call it an investment bank.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Robertson has a no-compete clause with BankAmerica,
but as most lawyers in this state will tell you, they are difficult
to enforce in California.
</P>
<P>
   NO. 2 REDUX
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco is playing second fiddle to Charlotte ... again.
First, it was the battle for the corporate headquarters of the
merged NationsBank-BankAmerica. Now, it's the right to host a
global economic gabfest, er, business conference.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that the North Carolina metropolis beat out our
fine city as the location for next year's Trans-Atlantic Business
Dialogue conference. The news was released (where else?) yesterday
at NationsBank headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Topping the guest list is President Clinton. But I don't see
what the big deal is. It seems like the president is in the Bay
Area every other week passing the fund-raising hat for somebody.
</P>
<P>
   CORRECTION
</P>
<P>
   The leveraged buyout of Northwest Airlines led by Gary Wilson
and Al Checchi occurred in 1989. Monday's column incorrectly stated
the year as 1987.
</P>
<P>
   And as for whether Mr. Checchi should receive credit for turning
around the airline, that could be debated at length.
</P>
<P>
   But airline analyst Michael Boyd in Golden, Colo., makes this
point: Checchi and Wilson hired current chief executive John
Dasburg, who has successfully recast Northwest into a profitable
and successful carrier. ``They did one thing: They brought in
someone who could run the airline,'' Boyd says.

THIS WEEK:OLD ORDER AMISH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY JIM JONES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One in a series or articles on religions of the world.
</P>
<P>
   OLD ORDER AMISH &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MEMBERSHIP: about 80,000 in 22 states, Canada and Central
America. Most Old Order Amish live in Pennsylvania, Ohio and
Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   HISTORY: The Amish sect began as part of the Mennonite movement,
which arose in Europe in the 1500s. Differences arose regarding
church-state relations and infant baptism, and in 1693, Jacob Amman
broke from the Mennonites. His followers became known as the Amish.
The two groups still share beliefs regarding nonresistance and
basic Bible doctrine, but they differ in their views on technology,
dress and forms of worship. The Old Order Amish represent the most
conservative of the Amish and Mennonite groups.
</P>
<P>
   BELIEFS: The basic doctrine differs little from orthodox
Christianity: faith in God through Jesus Christ, belief in the
Bible as the inspired word of God, a conviction that faith should
be reflected in a lifestyle of good works and discipleship.
However, the Old Order Amish emphasize the teaching of Romans 12:2
and other verses that encourage believers to separate themselves
from the world. Therefore, Old Order Amish forgo electricity,
television, radios, automobiles and public schools because of the
connection these things create with the outside world.
</P>
<P>
   DAILY LIFE: Most Amish are trilingual, speaking a German dialect
called Pennsylvania Dutch at home, High German in worship services
and English with outsiders. Amish children receive an education
through the eighth grade in one-room private school buildings. A
1972 Supreme Court ruling upheld the group's right to operate its
own schools and deny its children a high school education.
</P>
<P>
   Transportation is limited to horse-drawn buggies. However,
members may hire a car and driver for specific tasks, and they may
use other modern conveniences such as bottled gas for light, heat
and refrigeration.

 Komag to Cut 10% Of Workers   By Jon Swartz  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
The personal computer glut claimed another victim yesterday.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Komag Inc., a maker of platters used in computer disk drives,
said it will slice its 4,800-person workforce by 10 percent and
take a one-time charge of up to $185 million in its second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The struggling San Jose company _ the latest components
manufacturer to be sideswiped by an oversupply of PCs _ did not
disclose how many jobs would be affected in the Bay Area, where it
employs 2,000. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A company spokesman said the job cuts would be ``across the
board'' and ``throughout the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Komag said it will close one of its two San Jose plants by July
1999, but it declined to say how many jobs would be eliminated.
Nearly three-fourths of Komag's manufacturing capacity is outside
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials are predicting a second-quarter loss on par
with its first-quarter loss of $58.2 million ($1.10 a share).
</P>
<P>
   Komag is forecasting that sales in its second quarter ending
June 28 will be $75 million to $85 million, significantly lower
than the $100 million to $125 million it expected earlier. In the
same quarter a year ago, Komag reported revenues of $175.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   The disk supplier warned that it does not expect to be
profitable until the first half of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have been swept up by adverse conditions in the PC
market,'' said analyst Jim Porter of Disk/Trend Inc. in Mountain
View. ``Management will need to hunker down over the next year and
survive a difficult period.''
</P>
<P>
   Komag joins a growing list of companies in the disk-drive
industry who have recently made cutbacks to offset dwindling market
share and oversupply problems caused by a softening PC market.
</P>
<P>
   Seagate Technology Inc. and Quantum Corp. already have slashed
workforces this year, and Western Digital has warned of
disappointing earnings. The stocks of all three companies have
plummeted in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Komag made the announcement after the close of trading. Shares
of Komag dipped 44 cents, to a 52-week low of $9.19.

 Forbes Names New Publisher, Bay Area Base   By David Einstein  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
Forbes Inc. named a new publisher for its flagship business
magazine yesterday _ a 43-year-old technology booster who will
preside from a West Coast headquarters in Silicon Valley.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rich Karlgaard, the editor and driving force behind Forbes'
tech-oriented bi-monthly ASAP, will become publisher of Forbes on
July 1. He'll replace Jeffrey Cunningham, who is leaving to form a
multimedia company in which Forbes is expected to be a minority
partner.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes is the latest East Coast media power to relocate its
nerve center to Silicon Valley, bowing to the growing influence of
technology in the U.S. economy. Newspaper chain Knight Ridder,
publisher of the San Jose Mercury News, is moving its headquarters
from Miami to San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   Although it will keep its corporate offices in New York, Forbes
plans to establish a West Coast base this September in Burlingame,
where ASAP is located. The company will consolidate ASAP's staff,
an expanded Forbes editorial bureau and advertising and sales
personnel on the top floor of a new five-story building.
</P>
<P>
   Karlgaard's appointment signals Forbes' intent to put greater
emphasis on technology coverage _ a strategy embraced by its rival,
Fortune. Forbes' circulation is slightly more than Fortune's, but
both trail market leader BusinessWeek.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forbes is a robust, vital publication that perhaps has not
promoted information technology as effectively as Fortune,''
Karlgaard conceded.
</P>
<P>
   It's uncertain whether Karlgaard will imbue Forbes with the
refreshing irreverence that characterizes the writing in ASAP. But
Steve and Tim Forbes, who run the Forbes family empire these days,
made it clear they expect Karlgaard to bring a new voice to the
staid publication that began life 81 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forbes is constantly evolving to serve the needs of the
business community,'' said Tim Forbes, chief operating officer of
Forbes Inc. ``Rich's selection as publisher reflects a new phase in
the magazine's commitment to technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Forbes, the sometime-political candidate who serves as
Forbes' chief executive, hailed Karlgaard as ``a forward-looking
original thinker who understands the information needs of top
executives in the new economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Karlgaard co-founded Upside magazine, another opinionated
technology publication, in 1989. In 1992 he left to help Forbes
start ASAP.
</P>
<P>
   Highlights of his tenure there included the week he spent
following Bill Gates around the clock. He also came up with the
idea for an annual issue in which noted writers like Thomas Wolfe
and Kurt Vonnegut are asked to weigh in on a major technology
issue.
</P>
<P>
   Karlgaard, a 1976 Stanford graduate who lives in Los Altos with
his wife and two young children, called Forbes' decision to let him
stay in California a bold move.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes a lot of sense and gives Forbes great balance with a
lot of eyes and ears on Silicon Valley and the Pacific Rim,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In his new job he plans to be ``a chief evangelist for the
digitally driven economy.'' He'll write a column for Forbes every
other week and spend a good deal of time giving speeches.

 `Stealth' Web pages feed off addresses   By Jon Swartz  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
When a congressional staffer recently went surfing for information
on the White House, what he stumbled across was hardly
presidential.
<TEXT>
<P>
   At the infamous Whitehouse.com Web site, the flummoxed aide
encountered a digitally enhanced caricature of Hillary Rodham
Clinton _ resplendent in black leather and whip _ leading the
president by a dog leash, and a banner cooing, ``Our nation's young
teens, hot lesbians and hardcore nymphomaniacs all gather here to
serve you and serve their country.''
</P>
<P>
   The aide's boss, U.S. Senator Lauch Faircloth, R-N.C., was not
amused.
</P>
<P>
   ``It upsets the senator that children can punch up `White House'
and look at this stuff,'' said Jim Hyland, Faircloth's legislative
director.
</P>
<P>
   The bait and switch (the official Oval Office Internet address
is  &LR; www.whitehouse.gov &LR; ) has driven Faircloth to draft legislation
that would put a lid on some ``stealth'' Web sites. It prohibits
private parties from using government agency names for commercial
Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Hyland said the proposal is being crafted as a stand-alone
bill or as an amendment to pending legislation from Indiana Senator
Dan Coats. The latter legislation, which is scheduled for a Senate
vote this month, would require operators of commercial sites
``harmful to minors'' to put up barriers to prevent access by
anyone under 18.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  But industry insiders and legal experts say Faircloth's bill
_ in whatever form _ is a blatant affront to the First Amendment. &LR; 
 &LR; They say the law won't clear up the murky realm of online
trademarks, nor will it arrest an onslaught of &UR;  &LR; stealth Web sites
that promote everything from adult-oriented businesses to political
parodies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many sites with misleading names, (the bill)
would be difficult to enforce,'' said Shyla Welch, a spokeswoman
for Enough is Enough, a Fairfax, Va., nonprofit organization that
supports Coats' bill.
</P>
<P>
   Enterprising Web operators are increasingly invoking the
monikers of government agencies and well-known companies to mask
their content and get extra attention among an estimated 1 million
online sites.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Steamy Web sites have excelled at the digital diversion to
reach a large commercial audience _ and the results can be jolting
to unsuspecting Web surfers.
</P>
<P>
   _Those expecting to get Internet services by typing
 &LR; www.yahhoo.com &LR;  instead are getting an eyeful of a nude Pamela Lee
Anderson with breathless promises of ``See Pamela f--- Tommy Lee.''
</P>
<P>
   A Yahoo spokeswoman said the Santa Clara company (real site:
 &LR; www.yahoo.com &LR; ) is aware of the site &UR;  &LR; but that the firm's lawyers
have not contacted it.
</P>
<P>
   _NASA officials (real site: &LR;  www.nasa.gov)  &LR; thought they had rid
themselves of an embarrassing situation when they invoked the
National Space Act of 1958 _ which makes it illegal for a private
group to identify itself as NASA _ to shut down the X-rated site &LR; 
www.nasa.com &LR;  last year.
</P>
<P>
   Not entirely. Now there is  &LR; www.nassa.com &LR; , which also features
eye-popping nude photos.
</P>
<P>
   Although Faircloth's bill would ban such misappropriation of
government names, it does not tackle the scores of Web sites that
mask their content with corporate names or well-known phrases. For
example, dumbfounded nerds looking for free shareware software are
surprised to find pornographic images at  &LR; www.sharware.com &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Faircloth's ire, however, is directed squarely at
Whitehouse.com.
</P>
<P>
   After plunking down $10,000 to buy the rights to
 &LR; www.whitehouse.com &LR;  in May 1997, Dan Parisi of Secaucus, N.J.,
started the site as a ``pure parody of U.S. politics,'' but few
cared.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was losing $10,000 a month until I discovered how popular
adult sites are,'' Parisi said.
</P>
<P>
   The site's traffic also has surged to 50,000 visitors per day
from just 100 daily a year ago. Even with all those visitors,
Parisi said he's just now breaking even, but he expects to turn a
profit soon.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials aren't amused, however.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  ``We object to your use of the names and images of the White
House, the President and the First lady on that Website to sell
memberships in an adult video club,'' presidential counsel Charles
Ruff stated in a curt December 1997 letter. ``We too believe in the
First Amendment _ and in humor, although we see nothing humorous in
your use of the White House domain name to draw children and other
unwitting Internet users to your website.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the warning, the site is still up. It includes the
disclaimer: ``We are in no way endorsed by or associated with the
U.S. government. You must be 18 years or older to enter this
site!''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are plenty of other companies with Web sites that
contain the words `White House,''' Parisi said. ``I have just as
much right to that name as they do.''
</P>
<P>
   Many agree with Parisi that legislation is not the answer.
</P>
<P>
   Industry observers argue that the Clintons are public figures,
making the parody of them _ no matter how distasteful _ legal. And
the site's other content is protected under the First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a huge encroachment of free-speech rights, &UR;  &LR; which allow
for parody and conflicting opinions,'' said Wayne Rash, senior
technology editor at InternetWeek magazine in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Trademark lawyers, meanwhile, are divided on whether the White
House should receive the same protections as NASA and Coca-Cola.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are federally mandated super trademark protection for
Olympics, Girls Scouts and Daughters of the American Revolution,''
said Carl Oppedahl, an intellectual-property attorney in Frisco,
Colo. ``I'm sure Congress could do the same to White House.''
</P>
<P>
   Sally Abel, a Palo Alto attorney and board member of the
International Trademark Association in New York, said the Internet
industry is trying to ``hash out'' its role in online-naming
rights. &UR;  &LR; She said victims of stealth sites have three options: They
can lobby domain-name dispenser Network Solutions to protect their
trademarked name online, sue the offending party or ``grin and bear
it.''
</P>
<P>
   If legislators don't get their way, they might get an assist
from cybersquatters _ people who register Web addresses that
include the names of companies, celebrities or products, with the
intent of reselling them at a profit.
</P>
<P>
   Parisi and others routinely pay $100 to $1,000 to buy the legal
rights to domain names. Some cybersquatters say they are wary of
being misled into selling their names to hard-core Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will absolutely not sell the rights to `teens.com' so
someone can slap nude photos on a Web site,'' said Martin Turnbull,
a 57-year-old grandfather and domain-name speculator in Colorado
Springs, Colo. ``I'm sick and tired of being abused by those
people.''

AUTOS POST BEST SALES MONTH IN 12 YEARS 
</HEADLINE>
 (dc) 
 By MICHELLE KREBS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ May was the best month for car and truck sales since
September 1986 for the nation's auto industry, with sales totaling
1,511,661 cars and trucks, a 12.1 percent increase from May 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, fueled by hefty price discounts, the seasonally
adjusted annual selling rate for light vehicles reached 16.3
million cars and trucks last month, the highest level since October
1987. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sales of both cars and trucks increased though truck sales
showed a higher rise. Car sales totaled 793,066 units, up 6.9
percent; light truck sales topped 718,575 units, up 18.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fundamentals of the economy are very strong,'' said
Michael DiGiovanni, the chief forecaster at General Motors Corp.
``A lot has been written about the industry slowing down, but
frankly it's hard to see that happening because of low
unemployment, low interest rates and high consumer confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Sales, however, were buoyed by attractive incentive programs.
Automakers spent as much as $1,600 a vehicle on incentives in May,
up from about $1,100 a year earlier, according to analysts. In
mid-April, G.M. sent certificates worth $500 to $1,000 to previous
buyers of G.M. products to use toward the purchase of 50 different
models, above and beyond other cash rebate and low-interest loan
incentives.
</P>
<P>
   The program was an effort to rebuild GM's market share in the
United States, which had dropped to below 30 percent early in the
year. In May, G.M.'s share of the U.S. car and truck market rose to
32.5 percent. Ford Motor and Chrysler Corp. matched G.M.'s Loyalty
First program with their own customer loyalty plans and agreed to
accept GM certificates. GM did not agree to take Ford and Chrysler
coupons. The loyalty programs run through July 2.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors said Wednesday that it sold 487,151 cars and
trucks in May, an increase of 12.4 percent over May 1997. GM's
truck sales increased 19.2 percent, to 229,097 vehicles, the third
consecutive month GM has set a record for truck sales, pushing G.M.
well ahead of Ford in truck sales. GM's car sales also increased,
up 7 percent at 258,054 units.
</P>
<P>
   Ford reported Wednesday that it sold 353,693 cars and trucks in
May, up 1.2 percent from May 1997. Car sales totaled 139,622, down
5.5 percent; truck sales were 214,171, up 6.2 percent from last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Chrysler said Tuesday that it had its best month ever in May,
selling 250,031 cars and trucks, a 27 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
   Also reporting higher sales this week were Honda, Mitsubishi,
BMW, Volkswagen, Audi, Land Rover, Kia, Mercedes-Benz and Subaru.
Nissan sales, which include sales for its Infiniti luxury division,
were off 12 percent at 52,992 cars and trucks. Volvo, Mazda and
Hyundai also reported lower sales.
</P>
<P>
   Based on May's strong performance, GM and Ford said they
expected sales for the full year to come in at the high end of
their original forecasts, about 15.2 million cars and trucks. G.M.
and Ford had predicted full-year sales would total 14.7 million to
15.2 million cars and trucks.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While automakers and analysts predict a healthy year for vehicle
sales, the quick pace of spring sales may have borrowed sales from
the second half of the year. ``The terrific numbers in May aren't
sustainable,'' said David Healy, an auto analyst with Burnham
Securities Inc. in New York. ``The coupons are bringing in car and
truck sales from the second half into the spring. But at some
point, the auto makers will have to start paying the piper.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the highly competitive vehicle market is likely to keep
the level of consumer incentives relatively high throughout the
year, analysts said.

 More People Thinking About Saving   By Laura Castaneda  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
The number of Americans who have attempted to calculate how much
money they may need for retirement jumped from 32 percent in 1996
to 45 percent this year, according to a new survey.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The bad news, though, is that despite a booming economy, 36
percent of Americans still aren't saving for retirement, primarily
because they believe they are burdened with too many financial
responsibilities, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
   The findings, which were released yesterday, are part of the
eighth annual Retirement Confidence Survey, which gauges the views
and attitudes of working and retired Americans regarding a wide
range of retirement issues.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; This year's survey also included for the first time a Small
Employer Retirement Survey and a special analysis of the retirement
views of African Americans, Latinos and Asian Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of the survey is to provide information to
public-policy makers, entrepreneurs and average citizens about
retirement issues and barriers to saving.
</P>
<P>
   ``My hope is that these findings have an impact on a grass-roots
level and motivate people to take action,'' said Paul Yakoboski, a
senior research associate for the Employee Benefit Research
Institute, a co-sponsor of the survey.
</P>
<P>
   Among both savers and nonsavers, more than 50 percent said in
the survey they believe they could save an extra $20 every week for
retirement, the study found.
</P>
<P>
   That would give each person $1,040 per year of extra savings.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can (save this amount) for decades, we're talking about
potentially hundreds of thousands of dollars, especially if you
factor in starting early, increasing the amount you save, and
getting an employer match (with a 401k) plan,'' Yakoboski said.
</P>
<P>
   The findings were released to coincide with the 1998 White
House-Congressional National Summit on Retirement Savings tomorrow
and Friday in Washington, D.C., which will focus attention on a
number of retirement issues.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  The small employer survey noted many reasons why small
businesses don't offer retirement plans to their employees,
Yakoboski said.
</P>
<P>
   About 50 percent said one major reason is that employees would
prefer higher wages or other benefits.
</P>
<P>
   About 51 percent cited uncertain revenue; 45 percent said
required employer contributions are too high; 35 percent cited
excessive government regulations; and 35 percent cited the expense
of starting and administering a plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``You combine all of these factors, and you see real barriers
for small employers when it comes time to think about offering a
retirement plan,'' Yakoboski said. ``We have to work on addressing
employer concerns and making this a priority.''
</P>
<P>
   Turning to the analysis of minorities and retirement, the survey
said 62 percent of Asian Americans indicate they've begun saving
for retirement.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, 52 percent of African Americans and 62 percent of
Latinos indicate they're not currently saving any money for
retirement.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, 32 percent of Asian Americans aren't confident that
they'll have enough money to support themselves in retirement, no
matter how long they live, compared to 43 percent of African
Americans and 43 percent of Latinos.
</P>
<P>
   Yakoboski said there's been a heavy emphasis on the importance
of saving for retirement. But that message is not getting across to
minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``This quick snapshot raises questions about whether there are
better ways to reach out to different parts of the working
population. Does one size really fit all, or do we have to rethink
our approach a bit?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   The survey is co-sponsored by Employee Benefit Research
Institute, the American Savings Education Council, and Mathew
Greenwald &AMP; Associates, a market research firm. All are based in
Washington D.C.

 PCs Will Bring Personal Touch to Political Campaigns   By Tom Abate  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
Former political technology guru Dan Jones helped me see the silver
lining inside another election clouded by big money and negative TV
ads.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jones, now with an Internet startup in San Francisco, said that
when he started doing political work for the Democrats in the
1970s, it took a mainframe computer to run a door-to-door campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, a PC can do it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Schweitzer, a Republican tech specialist from Washington
state, said the idea is to build a database of ``swing'' voters _
people not loyal to either party. The high-tech campaign tries to
reach these voters with direct mail or other appeals.
</P>
<P>
   So why do the major candidates throw all their money at the Boob
Tube? San Francisco State University professor Gary Selnow, author
of several books on campaign technology, blames inertia.
</P>
<P>
   ``TV has a long history of success in politics, and politicians
go with what they know,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Selnow thinks that database techniques, combined with
Internet delivery, could revolutionize campaigns, replacing
mass-media appeals with one-on-one tactics that grassroots groups
could employ as readily as the rich.
</P>
<P>
   Net campaigns will start by using e-mail and Web sites to reach
supporters, and graduate to sending video clips that cost far less
than TV ads.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really think a new generation of techniques is arising that
will, to some extent, bring back the type of person-to-person
campaign we haven't seen for a while,'' said Elisabeth Provinse, a
Washington, D.C., political expert since 1970.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Reality check &LR; : Whatever their future, Net campaigns ain't all
ready for prime time _ yet.
</P>
<P>
   When the pro-226 campaign bought a modest $5,000 banner ad on
the Hotmail Web site, the Net-heads and politicos had a tiff over
the meaning of GIF.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Hotmail) called us and said, `You need to get a jiff
(file),''' said campaign spokesman Mitch Zak. ``I said, `What's
that ... peanut butter?'''
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; S.F. confidential: &LR;  The e-mail marked ``confidential'' should
never have reached my in-box.
</P>
<P>
   But Alexander Communications goofed and sent me an in-house
message, in which a staffer at this high-tech PR firm blasted
writer and PR critic Michael Wolff.
</P>
<P>
   Wolff is the author of ``Burn Rate,'' a kiss-and-tell book about
an Internet publishing company he founded in the mid-'90s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Burn Rate'' is Wolff's account of how he lost control of his
startup and got screwed by former associates _ like his PR firms.
</P>
<P>
   Writing ``Burn Rate'' apparently wasn't cathartic enough for
Wolff, now a columnist for the Industry Standard in San Francisco.
In the magazine's May 4 issue, he took a shorter swipe at PR firms.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``I'm mad because I didn't get my name in the paper enough''
after spending tens of thousands of dollars on PR fees, Wolff
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   That column provoked one Alexandrian to e-mail her colleagues _
and by accident, me. Wolff's startup stiffed Alexander for $48,869
in unpaid PR fees, she said, to let colleagues ``know the kind of
character we're dealing with here.''
</P>
<P>
   I phoned Wolff, who didn't deny the deadbeat-client claim.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hire these PR people to get your name in the paper and
they don't,'' he said. ``My position finally was: No ink, no
money.''
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Political ink: &LR;  Alexander, which wants to be the PR firm that
marries tech to politics, has been helping TechNet bring Republican
lawmakers through Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's guest was Representative Michael Oxley, the Ohio
Republican who will play a key role in passing a bill banning
``frivolous'' lawsuits in state courts.
</P>
<P>
   I asked Oxley why the recent GOP interest in what has been
Clinton-Gore country.
</P>
<P>
   ``We might have given up on Hollywood,'' he said. ``All the
Republicans out there are dead. Hell, we lost John Wayne, Frank
Sinatra. But we're not giving up on Silicon Valley. The way they
give out stock options, a lot of these companies are turning
employees into capitalists, big time.''

MEXICO TO PROSECUTE UNDERCOVER U.S. CUSTOMS AGENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JULIA PRESTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Mexico has advised the United States that it will
prosecute U.S. Customs agents and informers who carried out an
undercover money-laundering operation on Mexican soil and will seek
the agents' extradition to face criminal trial here.
</P>
<P>
   In a meeting on Monday in Caracas, Venezuela, Foreign Secretary
Rosario Green of Mexico handed Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright a list of Mexican laws that the customs agents violated,
according to preliminary results of Mexican investigations.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico is preparing to accuse the agents of entrapment, engaging
in money-laundering and usurping the authority of Mexican law
enforcement, Ms. Green said in news interviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our legal action is going forward and that's final,'' Ms.
Green told a Mexican radio interviewer on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The three-year undercover operation, code-named Casablanca, was
described by officials of the U.S. Customs Services as the largest
and probably the most successful in U.S. law enforcement history.
According to indictments in Los Angeles stemming from the
investigation, employees of 12 Mexican banks laundered at least
$110 million for drug organizations based in Colombia and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   But the operation has badly shaken the close relations that the
Clinton administration built with Mexico. U.S. officials
embarrassed their Mexican counterparts by not informing them about
the secret operation until hours before its results were announced
publicly in Washington on May 18. Mexican officials have come under
a barrage of criticism here for being cowed by the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The indictments in the case make it clear that several customs
agents and confidential informers who did not work for the U.S.
government met with bankers and narcotics dealers inside Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The operations centered on a painstakingly constructed sting, a
front company run by customs called Emerald Empire Corp. based near
Los Angeles. Through this company, undercover customs agents
received instructions from Colombian and Mexican traffickers and
relayed them to bankers in Mexico. Customs also used elaborate
ruses to lure Mexican bankers suspected of money-laundering out of
Mexico so they could be arrested in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Sting operations are illegal under Mexican law.
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting of the Organization of American States in Caracas,
Ms. Albright acknowledged that ties with Mexico had been damaged.
``Obviously there needs to be better cooperation,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Green said Ms. Albright issued a straightforward apology
in the private meeting. Mexico's foreign minister said Ms. Albright
was angry that she, too, had been left in the dark about the
operation.

 (For use by clients of the New York Times News Service)   HMO Bankrolled By Physicians Fails  
   
 By Sabin Russell  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
The California Medical Association has pulled the plug on its
two-year venture into the the world of managed care.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Oakland-based California Advantage Inc., which set out to prove
that organized physicians can compete against commercial HMOs, will
file for bankruptcy today and lay off most of its 30 employees.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, California Advantage had signed up fewer patients
than it had doctor investors. The roughly 7,000 subscribers to the
CMA's health plan had 7,600 physician investors to choose from.
Another 30,000 doctors were available to treat the patients who, in
effect, never showed up.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very sad and distressing event for us,'' said Jack
Lewin, chief executive of the California Medical Association. The
venture ran up a deficit of $10 million, most of it absorbed by
7,600 doctors who each ponied up $1,000 to get the health plan off
the ground.
</P>
<P>
   But California Advantage lacked one advantage even its founders
recognized they needed from the start: money. To make the health
plan work, the CMA figured they would need to sign up twice as many
doctor investors as they eventually did.
</P>
<P>
   The health plan was unable to market itself effectively and
couldn't guarantee that it would remain in business for more than a
year _ not a strong selling point to insurance brokers. California
Advantage charged more than typical HMO's because it allowed
members to opt out of the care provided by plan doctors for partial
coverage of any doctor in the state. Patients would have to pay
more out-of-pocket for out-of-plan service.
</P>
<P>
   As a consequence, Lewin acknowledged, the health plan attracted
a somewhat sicker population of customers whose health care costs
were higher.
</P>
<P>
   But Lewin was hopeful that a partnership the CMA was building
with the California Hispanic Health Care Coalition and a
physician-owned malpractice insurance company would solve the
problems. The group was poised to cover 30,000 low-income patients
under Governor Wilson's Healthy Families program, but last week the
effort collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, the problem was money. California Advantage needed
$3 million to pass a state solvency test in order to participate in
the Healthy Families program. The capital-raising effort came up
short.

 3Com Seeks New Exec To Run Daily Operations   By Jonathan Marshall  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
3Com Corp., the Santa Clara computer networking company, said it is
recruiting a new senior executive to help manage day-to-day
operations.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The company has interviewed a handful of candidates since it
began the search in late April. Depending on his or her
qualifications, the person 3Com hires could become chief operating
officer or president, under Eric Benhamou, 3Com's current
president, chief executive and chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Benhamou is said to be seeking more time to focus on strategic
issues while off-loading some of his daily responsibilities. His
job has grown far more complex since 3Com acquired U.S. Robotics
last year, roughly doubling the company's size and giving it a huge
new stake in the consumer market.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, 3Com has been buffeted by severe price competition
in many of its product lines and by slower than expected demand for
its latest generation of 56K modems.
</P>
<P>
   The company's slumping profits contributed to a collapse of its
share price, from nearly $35 in early May to a close of $24
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Pyykkonen, an analyst with CIBC Oppenheimer, said 3Com
has failed to make up in volume for drastic price cuts on modems
and network interface cards, which let computers plug into company
networks. The price of such cards has fallen by half over the past
year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   3Com has also failed to gain significant market share for
higher-end corporate networking equipment, which enjoys higher
margins, Pyykkonen said.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge for a new chief operating officer, Pyykkonen said,
will be to help 3Com improve its manufacturing efficiencies and
retail distribution of mass production items like modems. The new
hire will also have to find ways to drive new product development
without raising expenses and squeezing profits.

VATICAN UNDER SCRUTINY IN ESCAPE OF PRO-NAZI CROATIANS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Only months after Pope John Paul II apologized for the
Catholic Church's silence during the Holocaust, the Vatican is once
again under scrutiny for its possible role in aiding the escape of
pro-Nazi Croatian leaders after World War II.
</P>
<P>
   A new report by the State Department says Catholic priests in
Rome helped Croatian leaders, who sent up to 700,000 Serbs, Jews
and others to death camps, to hide in Italy after the war and
eventually flee to South America. The report, which focuses on how
Nazi gold was shipped through neutral countries to finance the
German war effort, points out that much of its information, from
British and American intelligence files, could not be confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   But the report says it is quite likely that the Vatican was
aware of the efforts by priests at the San Girolamo Croatian
College in Rome to help the Ustasha, as the Croatian fascist rulers
were known.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no evidence in U.S. archives that the Vatican
leadership knew of or gave support to the Ustasha activities
outside its walls,'' the report says. ``But given the location of
the college, troubling questions remain.''
</P>
<P>
   The report added that the college ``appeared to operate with at
least the tacit acquiescence of some Vatican officials'' as ``it
helped fugitive Croatian war criminals escape to the Western
Hemisphere in the early postwar years.''
</P>
<P>
   The writers of the report urge the Vatican to make available all
its relevant archives.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Vatican, Joaquin Navarro-Vals, Wednesday
denied any Vatican knowledge of the underground effort to help
Ustasha leaders and said that the Vatican had no control over the
college.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only control from the Holy See is intellectual control,
making sure the college is teaching according to Catholic dogma,''
Navarro-Vals said. ``We don't think they were involved in such
activities, but we do not have any records or control over these
institutions.''
</P>
<P>
   He described the State Department's reference to ``troubling
questions'' about the Vatican as gratuitous assumptions.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time that the Vatican has been accused of
aiding the Croatian fascists. Last year the producers of a
documentary for the A&AMP;E cable television network released a U.S.
Treasury Department memo from 1946 that reported that the Vatican
still held 200 million Swiss francs, or $170 million today, for
Croatian fascists for safekeeping. The Vatican vehemently denied
the charge.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department report does not address that sum of money
or suggest that the Vatican treasury was part of network of Swiss
and other European banks where the Nazis stored plundered gold and
money.
</P>
<P>
   The report points out how American and British intelligence
services, preoccupied with the Cold War, also colluded in helping
Croatian fascists escape Soviet-occupied territory in the late
1940s and 50s and made no real effort to capture the Croatian
fascist leader, Ante Pavelic, when he was hiding in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   The 200-page document, which is careful not to accuse directly
the Vatican leadership of direct knowledge or involvement, is most
unlikely to unleash a major scandal at the Holy See. But it has
revived demands by historians and Jewish groups that the Vatican
reveal more secrets.
</P>
<P>
   Navarro-Vals said that in 1975 the Vatican released all relevant
information about the church's activities in the war in 11 volumes
of documents covering 1939 to 1945. But it was the Vatican that
decided what papers to release.

NEW TREATMENT FOR CHRONIC HEPATITIS C IS APPROVED 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DENISE GRADY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday approved a
powerful combination of two antiviral drugs to treat chronic
hepatitis C, a liver infection that can lead to cirrhosis, liver
cancer and liver failure.
</P>
<P>
   Four million Americans are estimated to have chronic hepatitis
C, and 10,000 die from it each year. The disease is the leading
reason for liver transplantation.
</P>
<P>
   The newly approved treatment, known as Rebetron, works far
better than sole standard treatment. But it is expensive, it poses
serious side effects and works in only about half the patients who
take it. Although it can eradicate signs of infection, it cannot be
called a cure. And doctors say that not everyone with hepatitis C
needs it.
</P>
<P>
   The treatment consists of a six-month course of interferon
injections and ribavirin capsules. The full course of therapy will
cost $6,400 to $8,600, depending on how high a dose a patient
needs.
</P>
<P>
   Rebetron, which is made by Schering-Plough Corp. of Madison,
N.J., has been approved for use only in people who relapse after
the standard treatment for hepatitis C, which is a course of
interferon injections. That therapy eliminates the disease in only
10 percent to 20 percent of patients. About half do not respond to
interferon at all. The remaining 30 percent to 40 percent respond
to interferon and then relapse, and those are the patients for whom
Rebetron has been approved.
</P>
<P>
   Tested in such a group, Rebetron reduced the virus to
undetectable levels in 45 percent, an effect that persisted when
the patients were tested again six months after treatment ended. In
patients given interferon alone, only 5 percent had undetectable
levels.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Dr. Leonard Seeff, a senior scientist for hepatitis C research
at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney
Diseases, who was not involved in the study, said those results
meant there was a good chance that the effects would last. In
studies of patients who responded to interferon alone, he said,
those who were free of the virus at six months remained so at six
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm not sure we won't find people with recurring disease
as we go further out,'' Seeff said. ``We need a much longer time to
follow all these people. The proof will come 20 years from now.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though Rebetron has been approved only for patients who
have relapsed after trying interferon, doctors will be free to
prescribe it as they see fit. Seeff and Dr. Jay Hoofnagle, director
of the division of digestive diseases and nutrition at the national
institute said they expected that many doctors would prescribe it
for all hepatitis C patients, including those who have not taken
interferon or who did not respond to it.
</P>
<P>
   Hoofnagle said data had been presented at medical meetings
showing that when the combination was given for one year to people
who had never been treated before, the relapse rate was only 20
percent. Given the poor response rate with interferon alone, he
said, it seems reasonable to go straight to the combination.
</P>
<P>
   But the drugs can have serious side effects. While interferon
alone is associated with flulike side effects, ribavirin can cause
severe anemia that comes on suddenly, Hoofnagle said, and in people
with cardiovascular disease that can touch off a heart attack or
stroke. It can also cause birth defects, so women must avoid
pregnancy while they take it and for six months after. Psychiatric
problems have also been reported. In addition, the interferon
component of the treatment causes flulike symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the risks of treatment, and its partial success rate,
Hoofnagle said, doctors have tried to determine which patients
truly need it rather than just giving the drugs to everyone with
hepatitis C. Only 20 percent to 30 percent of people with chronic
infections develop cirrhosis, liver failure or cancer. It is
impossible to predict just which ones will become severely ill, but
medical authorities now recommend treatment only for patients who
have detectable viral levels and abnormal results on tests of liver
enzymes. Others can be monitored and treated later if the disease
seems to be progressing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's mild, I say let's follow it carefully and wait it out
until we have a little bit better therapy,'' Hoofnagle said. ``Some
people don't want to be treated at all, but others are so anxious
that they don't care what you tell them and they just want to be
treated.''

REAL QUIET ARRIVES AT BELMONT TO A WINNER'S WELCOME 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN.: Ky.)   (ja)  
 By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Like a king who has been proclaimed but not yet
crowned, Real Quiet arrived in New York on Wednesday amid
movie-star fanfare and with an entourage that declared him ready to
win the Belmont Stakes and become the 12th horse in racing history
to sweep the Triple Crown.
</P>
<P>
   The extravaganza, staged with comic touches, began at 8 o'clock
in the morning when Real Quiet left Churchill Downs in Louisville,
where he won the Kentucky Derby four and a half weeks earlier. It
reached a peak when his cargo plane landed at Kennedy Airport two
hours later, the wing door swung open and the chief members of the
cast stood there with index fingers over their mouths, signifying
``real quiet.''
</P>
<P>
   Then they let the horse leave the plane, and everybody headed
for nearby Belmont Park, where Real Quiet joined most of the
expected 11 contenders who will try to foil him on Saturday. It was
the second such trip in two years for Baffert, who led Silver Charm
into town last June after victories in the Derby and the Preakness.
That story had an unhappy ending when Silver Charm lost in the
final strides to Touch Gold. But for Kent Desormeaux, Real Quiet's
jockey, this trip was novel and exciting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hair-raising, it gave me chills,'' he said after they
had reached Belmont Park. ``I felt like a throwback to the early
part of the century when the winners would get on the train and
travel to the next city.''
</P>
<P>
   But would Real Quiet supply the desired ending? After all, 13
horses have won the Derby and Preakness but failed in the Belmont,
and they included some great ones like Carry Back, Northern Dancer,
Spectacular Bid, Alysheba and Sunday Silence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will say I'm 98 percent sure of winning,'' Desormeaux said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just that so many things have to go right. I mean, you
could stumble in the gate. So, I won't guarantee victory. But I am
very, very confident.''
</P>
<P>
   Baffert was asked to comment on suggestions that Real Quiet
might be considered below standard as a Triple Crown winner because
so many rivals had dropped out of contention with injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's going to be answered Saturday,'' he said. ``He
has to win before we can think about things like that. And if we
don't win, we're still going to love him.''
</P>
<P>
   Baffert has become the first trainer to win the Kentucky Derby
and the Preakness two years in a row, but he is 0 for 7 in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Real Quiet will test the Belmont track Thursday morning but
won't hold any formal workout. He worked five-eighths of a mile
Tuesday at Churchill Downs in 1:00 4/5, and Baffert pronounced the
team's theme, which he repeated after arriving in New York: ``He's
ready. We're ready.''
</P>
<P>
   The draw for post positions will be held Thursday, and Belmont
Park will stick to tradition and make it a random draw. Both
Churchill Downs and Pimlico switched this year for the Derby and
Preakness, in the interests of TV ratings, and held a draw that
decided an order of selection, rather than post positions. The
owners then chose their post positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why change something that's been done for 200 years?'' asked
David Cross, who trains Classic Cat, third in the Preakness. ``It
doesn't matter where you draw, you've got a mile and a half to
overcome any problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the horses in the Belmont confined themselves to walking
or jogging for exercise Wednesday, but Hanuman Highway held a full
workout that also served to test his new shoes. The colt went four
furlongs in 45 3/5 seconds and galloped out five furlongs in 58
seconds, prompting his trainer, Kathy Walsh, to say, ``We're very
happy with the shoes.''
</P>
<P>
   The shoes were glued onto the hooves of Hanuman Highway after a
high nail from his regular shoe had caused an irritation and heat
in his right front foot.
</P>
<P>
   One bit of intrigue was prolonged: Grand Slam, who won the
Futurity and the Champagne at Belmont Park last fall and the Peter
Pan last week, was likely to be entered in the Belmont Stakes. But
the final decision on running him may not be made until later by
his trainer, D. Wayne Lukas, who spent Wednesday flying from his
home in Los Angeles to New York.

WIND BLOWING IN GOOD NEWS FOR TROJANS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GORDON VERRELL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OMAHA, Neb. _ The weather has turned here at the College World
Series - it's downright cold.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, from a pitcher's standpoint, the wind is suddenly
blowing in. At least it was during Wednesday night's game, and it's
expected to continue that way this afternoon (Thursday) when USC,
facing elimination, tackles two-time defending champion Louisiana
State, which is still unbeaten.
</P>
<P>
   The first time the Trojans took on LSU, it was hot and humid,
and the wind was blowing out - Gorilla Ball weather. The result:
LSU pounded USC All-American Seth Etherton for six of its
CWS-record eight home runs on the way to a 12-10 victory.
</P>
<P>
   After that game, USC coach Mike Gillespie, citing the
conditions, remarked, ``The wind's blowing out, it's a small
ballpark and the bats are nuclear.''
</P>
<P>
   And now?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still a small park,'' he said Wednesday, smiling, ``and
the bats are still nuclear.''
</P>
<P>
   But he'll take that two-out-of-three anytime.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're capable of playing with anybody,'' Gillespie said
shortly after the Trojans knocked Mississippi State out of the
tournament on Tuesday night. ``It's no upset for us to win.''
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans are 46-17 for the season. They've also had
experience working through the loser's bracket. USC lost its
opening-round game in the East Regional at Clemson, S.C., to
Virginia Commonwealth, 14-4, then won three games in a row, the
final two by one run, to earn its record-19th trip to the College
World Series.
</P>
<P>
   In the Trojans' first-round game at the CWS against LSU they
owned a 10-5 lead after six innings, thanks to Robb Gorr's grand
slam in the sixth. Then came the explosion. LSU tied the score with
a five-run seven, then broke the tie an inning later.
</P>
<P>
   Etherton, back down off Cloud Nine following his first-round
selection by the Angels in Tuesday's draft of eligible amateur
players, is again Gillespie's choice to start the rematch with LSU.
</P>
<P>
   It's not like Etherton didn't have success the first time around
against one of college baseball's most powerful lineups. He struck
out 10 in six innings, and he scattered nine hits. Trouble is, six
of them were scattered among the fans in the left and right field
seats.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, USC has rebounded impressively. The Trojans knocked
out top-seed Florida, 12-10, in 11 innings on Monday night, then
bounced Mississippi State, 7-1.
</P>
<P>
   For the Trojans to reach the College World Series championship
game for the 14th time - but first time in 20 years - they'll have
to whip LSU twice. And the Tigers have won 10 consecutive CWS
games, including their first two this year.
</P>
<P>
   But after three games, USC is the No. 1-hitting team in the
tournament, average-wise, at .352. The Trojans' Jason Lane and Brad
Ticehurst are 1-2 in total hits, with eight and seven,
respectively, and the Trojans lead in runs scored.
</P>
<P>
   LSU, though, has powered 14 home runs, twice as many as USC, and
in one fewer game.

CLINTON SAYS HE WILL RENEW CHINA'S TRADING PRIVILEGES
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By JAMES BENNET   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton announced on Wednesday that he
would renew China's trading privileges, signaling that he would not
back away from his policy of engagement despite the rising
congressional clamor over whether the Chinese government illegally
contributed to his campaign and used protected American technology
to improve its missiles.
</P>
<P>
   In a Rose Garden ceremony, Clinton argued that links with China
supported a range of American economic and security interests. And
he called trade ``a force for change in China, exposing China to
our ideas and our ideals, and integrating China into the global
economy.''
</P>
<P>
   While Congress is expected ultimately to approve China's trade
status after the president returns from a visit there later this
month, Republicans made clear on Wednesday that they intend to
exact a high political price. The House and Senate have 90 days in
which to reject Clinton's formal recommendation of what is known as
``most-favored-nation status'' for China.
</P>
<P>
   The threat of revoking the status _ the benefit that the United
States grants to almost every country in the world except those it
regards as terrorist states _ is one of the main instruments
Congress has used to show its displeasure with China over human
rights abuses and other problems. The threat has been raised
repeatedly through the Bush and Clinton administrations, although
the United States has never actually revoked the status.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, has said he
is reconsidering his long-held support for extending the trade
status. Rep. Dick Armey of Texas, the House majority leader, said
on Wednesday: ``I think the current circumstances make this a very
difficult vote. While most of us embrace trade as something that's
healthy for the peoples of all countries, we really have a serious
group of national security concerns before us.''
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Newt Gingrich threw his support behind renewing
China's trade privileges. ``Seeking to keep China open to the West
has proven to be the most effective way to advance our democratic
values in this turbulent region of the world,'' Gingrich wrote in a
letter to the president on Wednesday that was also signed by two
other Republicans, Reps. Bill Archer of Florida, the chairman of
the House Ways and Means Committee, and Philip Crane of Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even as they pledged to work with Clinton in a ``bipartisan
manner'' on China trade, the three congressmen indicated that they
would make the most of charges against him. Rehearsing what they
called disturbing accusations, they promised full investigations.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have accused Clinton of risking American security by
permitting the Chinese to launch satellites for an American company
that contributed heavily to the Democrats. As a result, they argue
the Chinese may have been able to obtain technology that permitted
them to improve their missiles. Congressional committees and the
Justice Department are investigating whether the Chinese government
illegally contributed money to the Democrats during Clinton's
re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   As a candidate, Clinton derided the policy of engagement with
China, but as President he came to accept and then embrace it. On
Wednesday, he praised it as a means of assuring American security.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our engagement with China serves American interests,'' Clinton
said, citing ``stability in Asia, preventing the spread of weapons
of mass destruction, combatting international crime and drug
trafficking, protecting the environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that cooperation with China had become even more
important in light of the nuclear standoff between India and
Pakistan. He appeared in the Rose Garden on Wednesday with
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who was preparing to depart
for a meeting in Geneva among five nuclear powers to discuss the
situation in South Asia. The meeting is to be chaired by China.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Warning that developing nuclear weapons would make the Indian
and Pakistani people ``poorer and less secure,'' the president
said, ``The international community must now come together to move
them to reverse course and to avoid a dangerous arms race in
Asia.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, in a briefing at the State Department, Ms. Albright
acknowledged past Administration concern that the Chinese helped
Pakistan develop its nuclear capability. But she said that ``in
recent years they have changed their behavior vis-a-vis the
Pakistanis'' and ``are not providing any assistance to
unsafeguarded projects.''
</P>
<P>
   In their one-day meeting, the five nations _ the United States,
Britain, China, France, and Russia _ hope to draw up joint
proposals concerning India and Pakistan. The administration wants
to persuade both nations not to arm missiles with nuclear warheads
or to engage in more provocative rhetoric or military activity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, the most important thing both sides can do is to
cool it and take a deep breath and to begin to climb out of the
hole they have dug themselves into,'' Albright said in the Rose
Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Every president has renewed normal trade status with China since
it was first extended in 1980, and Congress has always gone along.
</P>
<P>
   American trade with China now amounts to about $75 billion a
year, with China vying with Japan as the nation contributing the
most to the American trade deficit. While the United States
imported $62.5 billion in goods from China last year, it exported
only $12.8 billion in goods.
</P>
<P>
   But American companies are jostling for a foothold in China in
hopes of exploiting its vast market, and they have put heavy
pressure on Congress to support the president's stance. American
business groups, such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the
National Association of Manufacturers, were quick to support
renewing China's trade privileges on Wednesday. On the other side,
unlikely allies have coalesced, including labor unions and
conservative supporters of religious freedom and human rights.
</P>
<P>
   The China issue divides both political party. On Wednesday, Rep.
Dick Gephardt of Missouri, the House Democratic leader, declared
that he would once again oppose most-favored-nation status for
China.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must not reward the Chinese Communist government for
continuing political repression and tyranny,'' Gephardt said in a
statement.

   The problem Wednesday afternoon was that Evander Holyfield was
the guy behind the curtain. The champ _ encamped in a sea of
television lights just 40 feet from the boxing ring in which
Akinwande was to spar _ was doing an hour's worth of national
satellite interviews and the TV folks didn't want him disturbed.
Worse, the lights around the ring had been shut off to assure an
appropriate background.
</P>
<P>
   To appease Akinwande's complaining manager, panicked Madison
Square Garden officials quickly erected a flimsy curtained barrier
near the ring and then tried convincing the challenger to train in
the dark. And that's about the time a Frenchman approached and
asked Akinwande to autograph a photo.
</P>
<P>
   As Akinwande began to sign, he noticed the image. It showed him
desperately clutching Lennox Lewis in the heavyweight title fight
last July where he was disqualified for excessive holding. It was
the lone _ but monumental _ stain in his career. He was hooted out
of the Nevada ring and back in England, headline writers who had
tagged him ``Henry the First'' changed it to ``Henry the Worst.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's reminder of that soured him even more. And the final
straw came while he was sparring. Looking up from a clinch, he saw
Holyfield _ already a 7-to-1 favorite _ peeking around the curtain
and laughing. By the time Akinwande's training was done, he was in
no mood to talk and let new trainer Emanuel Steward serve as his
mouthpiece:
</P>
<P>
   ``Of all the pictures the guy could have handed him, it was from
that Lewis fight. Henry is upset because that's all people want to
talk about. So now he won't talk.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Akinwande did talk. ``People say I have no guts, that I
have no heart,' he said in a quiet voice steeped with a Nigerian
accent. ``They do not know what I've been through in my life. If
they did ,they would know how much I love this game, how much I've
sacrificed.''
</P>
<P>
   As the 6-foot-7 challenger told his story, you couldn't help but
like him _ as a person, not a guy about to pull a heavyweight
upset. Still, that's not saying he hasn't beaten the odds before.
He did with his dad.
</P>
<P>
   Akinwande was born in Dulwich, England, but his father _ whose
lucrative import-export business afforded the family a pair of
Mercedes Benz autos and college opportunities for the kids _ moved
the family back to Lagos, Nigeria when Henry was seven.
</P>
<P>
   Dad's plan was that Henry would go to college, then take over
the family business. Instead, when Akinwande was 14, he became
fascinated with boxing and secretly began working out. ``When my
dad found out, he nearly killed me,'' he said. ``He tried to have
the trainer arrested.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Africa, the father says everything. It doesn't matter if
you're 30, 35 years old, if he says sit, you sit. No questions
asked. When I told him that I was not giving boxing up, that it was
the one place where I found peace, he told me I was no longer his
son. That's when I left home and when he told me not to come
back.''
</P>
<P>
   Akinwande went back to England and a rough part of south London.
He joined a boxing club and for a while lived in abandoned
buildings while subsisting on a loaf of bread a day. He got a job
at a fast food restaurant, then - donning the traditional green
uniforms and Dr. Suess stove pipe hat _ he manned an oversized
broom as a Trafalgar Square street sweeper.
</P>
<P>
   With a sculpted body, an unmatched 86-inch wingspan and a
noteworthy left jab, he began to make his mark in boxing. He made
the British Olympic team for the 1988 Games in Seoul, though he
didn't medal. Turning pro, he won his first 18 fights before Axel
Schultz managed a disputed draw in Germany. After that he
dispatched of the likes of Jimmy Thunder, Schultz in a rematch,
Tony Tucker, Jeremy Williams for the lesser known WBO heavyweight
crown, and Columbus' Alexander Zolkin.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, family friends stepped in and spoke to his
father. They convinced Joseph Akinwande, who hadn't seen his son in
five years, to relent. ``They told him, 'Look he's proved you
wrong. He's doing what he loves and making more money than those
people who studied to be doctors and engineers,''' Akinwande said.
``We got back together and now we talk like gentlemen. We're
friends, though my father still hates boxing and doesn't come to my
fights.''
</P>
<P>
   It's just as well his dad wasn't there for the failure against
Lewis in Lake Tahoe. After issuing repeated warnings for clutching
rather than fighting, referee Mills Lane had enough and
disqualified Akinwande, who could barely catch his breath and was
being heartily booed in the fifth round.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward Akinwande's trainer Don Turner _ who also co-trains
Holyfield _ was at a loss to explain his heavyweight's actions.
Since then some in Akinwande's camp has blamed his demise on the
altitude and neglect from Turner, whom they claimed treated the
challenger as a second-class citizen with Holyfield in the same
stable.
</P>
<P>
   Back in Lagos _ where Akinwande owns a home as he does in London
and Orlando _ he said friends waited for him in front of his home:
``They were crying. They were sure I was drugged.''
</P>
<P>
   With Turner committed to Holyfield for this fight, Akinwande has
spent the past seven weeks with Steward, who toughened him up at
his fabled Kronk Gym in Detroit. Although he said Steward has
taught him a lot, Akinwande said his best lesson came in the Lewis
fight:
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned I am not invincible, that I must do whatever is
necessary to win. If that means fight naked, that's how I'll do it.
That's how we did it when we were kids in Lagos. It's mental
tactics. You do what you have to to survive. On the streets I'd
take my shirt off and the guy might think I was crazy and run. And
if that didn't work, I'd take my pants off. And when they start
seeing your panties, they usually do run. Saturday I will do
whatever it takes.''
</P>
<P>
   Which means the Madison Square Garden folks might want to keep
that portable curtain near the ring.

PANEL NAMED TO URGE REFORMS IN ULSTER POLICE FORCE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBLIN _ Responding to complaints from the Irish government,
Britain Wednesday announced the creation of an expanded commission
that will recommend reform of the Royal Ulster Constabulary,
Northern Ireland's police force.
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen M. O'Toole, the Massachusetts secretary of public
safety, is one of the members of the commission which was created
by the Northern Ireland political settlement and which will be
chaired by Chris Patten, the last British governor of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   But the formal announcement of the commission and its members
was delayed for several days after the Irish government complained
that its list of candidates had been ignored. In response, the
British government added Gerald Lynch, an academic from John Jay
College in New York, who had been recommended by the Dublin
government.
</P>
<P>
   The British also decided to hold off from announcing the
commission's formation on Tuesday at the annual conference of the
Royal Ulster Constabulary, after Dublin suggested that doing so
would undermine nationalist confidence in the commission's
independence.
</P>
<P>
   But while the British added Lynch to the commission they also
added Peter Smith, a Belfast lawyer and a prominent Protestant
unionist who would be seen as sympathetic to the Royal Ulster
Constabulary, bringing the commission's membership to eight.
</P>
<P>
   Other commission members include Maurice Hayes, the former
Northern Ireland ombudsman; Lucy Woods, the chief of British
Telecom in Northern Ireland; Clifford Sheering, a criminologist at
the University of Toronto, and John Smith, former deputy
commissioner of the Metropolitan Police in London.
</P>
<P>
   Reform and restructuring of the nearly 13,000-member police
force is considered essential to cementing the political settlement
and helping to end 30 years of sustained sectarian and political
violence.
</P>
<P>
   The Royal Ulster Constabulary is 93 percent Protestant, and the
biggest challenge facing administrators is how to downsize a force
that was just 3,000 when violence erupted in 1968 while also
increasing Catholic representation on, and confidence in, the
force.
</P>
<P>
   In no other area is the gap between Catholic nationalists and
Protestant unionists in Northern Ireland more evident than in
attitudes toward the RUC. Protestants strongly support the RUC and
are deeply suspicious of attempts to reform it.
</P>
<P>
   Many Catholics, however, have had negative experiences with the
RUC. Some Catholics want the RUC disbanded. But even those who
think disbanding the force is unrealistic want it reformed and want
its ranks to more closely reflect the 43 percent of the population
that is Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   The April 10 accord acknowledged the need to change the RUC, and
established an independent commission to recommend how to ``ensure
that policing arrangements, including composition, recruitment,
training, culture, ethos and symbols, are such that in a new
approach, Northern Ireland has a police service that can enjoy
widespread support from, and is seen as an integral part of, the
community as a whole.''

TEAM BAFFERT ARRIVES, READY TO WIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DEBBIE ARRINGTON  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELMONT, N.Y. &UR;  &LR; _ With a full police escort worthy of VIPs, Team
Baffert rolled into Belmont Park late Wednesday morning, ready for
its assault on the Triple Crown.
</P>
<P>
   Real Quiet, the convoy's most important passenger, took the pony
paparazzi in stride as he walked confidently off the horse van
before some 150 reporters and photographers. With his dappled coat
gleaming like bronze, the bay colt looked fresh and ready to
rumble.
</P>
<P>
   After a two-hour flight from Louisville, Real Quiet looked happy
to be back on the ground and in a barn. The Kentucky Derby and
Preakness champion playfully tried to kick trainer and co-passenger
Bob Baffert before being led into a stall.
</P>
<P>
   Also making the flight aboard the chartered 727 were owner Mike
Pegram and jockey Kent Desormeaux. ``We're just along for the
ride,'' joked Pegram.
</P>
<P>
   Jockeys usually don't arrive days early, even for a race as
important as Saturday's Belmont, when Real Quiet will attempt to
win the first Triple Crown in 20 years. And they certainly don't
travel with the horse. But Pegram convinced Desormeaux that the
occasion was special enough to make the trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Mike gave me the invitation, he told me that no jockey
had ever realized that, the opportunity to arrive with the horse,''
said Desormeaux, who had never flown on a horse plane before. ``I
felt like we were back in the early 1900s when the whole clan jumps
on the train to ride to the next town.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Baffert and Pegram suffer from severe allergies and riding
in a plane decked out in hay for the horse didn't help. ``The horse
took the flight a lot better than I did,'' said Pegram, who could
barely talk. ``I lost my voice, but he didn't turn a hair.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What a nerve-wracking experience!'' added Desormeaux. ``And
the horse -- his ears rubbed the roof the entire flight. It's not a
natural situation for him. Somehow he managed to keep his balance
during turbulence.''
</P>
<P>
   Baffert flew the whole trip in the cockpit to get away from the
hay. ``Real Quiet is a cool customer,'' he said. ``Nothing bothers
him. He acted like a big kid, looking around. But he looks like 5
million bucks.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the size of the bonus, kicked in by Visa, that goes with
winning a Triple Crown. On Wednesday, Desormeaux sported a new
button: ``Go Fish for $5 million!'' Baffert dubbed the
narrow-framed Real Quiet the Fish shortly after he got him.
</P>
<P>
   Jockey Gary Stevens guaranteed the media last year that he'd win
the Triple Crown aboard Silver Charm, but finished just short of
that goal.
</P>
<P>
   Desormeaux wouldn't make that same claim, but came close. ``I'm
98 percent sure we'll win,'' he said. ``So many simple things can
go wrong. He could stumble leaving the gate. There's no guarantee,
but I am extremely confident. I just want to be in that winner's
circle with Mike and Bob and get that bonus for these two guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Real Quiet will be ready to do his part, assured Baffert. ``He's
healthy and happy. He's ready to run.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Team Baffert waits for its Saturday date with
destiny. Some 200 family members and guests - including about 50
Bafferts -- were expected to arrive by Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   While Baffert supervises the horse, the family are headed to
Broadway to see Disney's stage version of ``The Lion King.'' Friday
night, Baffert will take time out for the kids and a Yankees game,
where he'll throw out the first ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``My oldest son Taylor is really excited about that,'' said
Baffert, who had the same honor last year. ``He tells me, `Dad,
people think I'm a celebrity now, too.'''

CASE OF ACCUSED MOLE STRAINS RELATIONS BETWEEN CIA AND GERMANY 
</HEADLINE>
  (EXCLUSIVE; 10:45 p.m. ET EMBARGO for print media; 12:01 a.m. ET
EMBARGO for electronic media.)

 By JAMES RISEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When messages filtering out of Russia reached the
headquarters of German intelligence earlier this year, alarm bells
began to sound throughout the upper reaches of the German
government. Russian intelligence sources had delivered shocking
news: The German official charged with rooting out spies was
himself a Russian spy _ Moscow's leading mole in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The official, Volker Foertsch, was subjected to a prolonged
investigation. His home was searched and a video camera placed in
his office. Later he was put on annual leave. After the
investigation, German prosecutors concluded that they did not have
enough evidence to charge him with espionage.
</P>
<P>
   The 63-year-old Foertsch _ a widely-respected career
intelligence officer known by his alias, ``Fleming'' _ resumed his
duties as head of counter-intelligence in May, and the German
government pronounced him exonerated.
</P>
<P>
   But that finding has not put an end to the controversy
surrounding the Foertsch matter in either Germany or the United
States, where the case has raised troubling new questions at the
CIA about the possible betrayal of U.S. secrets.
</P>
<P>
   CIA officials have been left to wonder if German intelligence,
which was regularly compromised by communist agents during the Cold
War, is once again being infiltrated by Moscow. CIA officials say
Russia has never stopped spying on the United States and European
countries despite the collapse of the Soviet Union, and may be
rebuilding its spy network for the post-Cold War period.
</P>
<P>
   German intelligence officials acknowledge that they are
continuing to investigate a series of unexplained failures of
German intelligence operations and that they are convinced that
material from its spy agency has been handed over to Moscow,
according to recent German press accounts.
</P>
<P>
   With so much intriguing, if contradictory, bits of information,
the truth behind the Foertsch affair now appears lost in the
wilderness of mirrors that so often bedevils major espionage cases.
U.S. intelligence officials trying to fathom the case must try to
determine whether Foertsch is indeed a Russian mole or the innocent
victim of the vicious internal politics that have long plagued
German intelligence. The German decision to allow Foertsch to
return to his job relatively quickly has only added to the mystery
surrounding the case.
</P>
<P>
   Foertsch's supporters in German intelligence believe the
allegations against him were without merit and expressed anger that
the case was ever referred to German prosecutors, according to
recent German press accounts. They have speculated that he has
either been vicitimized by political adversaries or has been
targeted by a sophisticated Russian disinformation campaign
designed to paralyze the German spy service.
</P>
<P>
   Another possibility is that if Foertsch is not a mole, then
someone else at the agency, known as the BND, mght be handing over
information while attention is focused on Foertsch.
</P>
<P>
   Foertsch returned to his job on May 18 after prosecutors in
Karlsruhe were unable to develop any solid evidence to substantiate
the charges leveled against him, German officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials were reluctant to discuss the
case publicly. A State Department spokesman stressed that the case
is an internal German matter, adding that it is premature to
determine whether it will have any impact on U.S.-German relations.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. intelligence officials also refused to discuss publicly
either the nature or the extent of their discussions with the
Germans about the Foertsch case. But the CIA has a longstanding
liaison relationship with German intelligence, and if the
allegations of a high-level penetration of the BND prove true, old
fears will be revived in Washington about the dangers of trusting
Germany with American secrets.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the Cold War, the Stasi, the East German secret
service, along with the KGB in the Soviet Union, feasted on West
Germany, recruiting spies from among its military, intelligence and
political officials. Those German spies sometimes gave the Soviet
Union valuable insights into NATO, but American intelligence
officials learned early on in the post-World War II era to be wary
about which secrets they could share with the Germans. The BND has
``a history of penetration, and the truth is we have never really
taken them too seriously as an intelligence organization,'' said
one American intelligence official.
</P>
<P>
   Such American fears began to recede in the post-Cold War era,
once the CIA and German intelligence obtained the old files of the
Stasi, enabling the German government to eliminate old communist
moles.
</P>
<P>
   But the Foertsch controversy is the latest in a series of recent
incidents that have begun to place new strains on the relationship
between the German and American intelligence services.
</P>
<P>
   While Germany's sieve-like security has long concerned the CIA,
Germany has begun to tire of its traditional role as a playground
for American spies fighting Russia and other adversaries. Just last
year Germany ordered a CIA officer to leave the country after being
caught trying to recruit a German government official as an
American spy. The German action came after years of quiet reminders
by Bonn to Washington that the Cold War was over and that it was
time for the CIA to reduce its presence in the country.
</P>
<P>
   But even given such problems in their relationship, Germany
remains one of the CIA's most important bases of operation for
American espionage. Now, however, the CIA uses Germany not as a
staging area for spy attacks on Eastern Europe, but against
post-Cold War adversaries in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   American officials say that one of the CIA's largest overseas
bases is in Frankfurt, Germany, where agency officials supervise
clandestine espionage operations targeted against countries like
Iran, Iraq and Libya.

PHILIP O'CONNOR, ACERBIC MEMOIRIST, 81, DIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (dc) 
 By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Philip O'Connor, an incorrigible, flamboyant and decidedly
self-absorbed British eccentric who turned a fulsomely frank
account of his abject childhood and misspent youth into a
rollicking literary sensation in 1958, ``Memoirs of a Public
Baby,'' died on Friday at his home near Uzes in southern France. He
was 81.
</P>
<P>
   During a life in which he dabbled in painting and poetry, turned
out a series of published and unpublished works, flirted with
communism, did a turn as a radio interviewer, succumbed to a
succession of adoring women and supported himself largely by
sponging off friends and various of his six wives, O'Connor wrote
incessantly, mainly about himself.
</P>
<P>
   The material, at least, was there.
</P>
<P>
   By his own account in ``Memoirs,'' which covered the first 25
years of his life, O'Connor was lucky to survive his childhood with
a sense of humor, albeit a distinctly acerbic one.
</P>
<P>
   The son of a well-educated Irish father he never knew and a
woman of mixed Irish and Burmese ancestry whose aristocratic tastes
exceeded her reach, he was born in Leighton Buzzard in Bedfordshire
and taken almost immediately to France, where his mother abandoned
him for two years in the care of a woman who ran a pastry shop.
</P>
<P>
   When he was 7 his mother reclaimed him, took him back to England
and then, after setting up housekeeping in a Soho cellar, abandoned
him again, this time, he recounted, to the care of a one-legged
bachelor civil servant who lived in a hut in Surrey.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving school at 17, O'Connor plunged into the bohemian life in
the artistic quarter of London known as Fitzrovia, declaiming
doggerel at bars frequented by Dylan Thomas and others, giving
impassioned, if not always comprehensible, speeches at Hyde Park
Corner, tramping across England and Ireland and receiving treatment
at a mental hospital for schizophrenia, a possibly erroneous
diagnosis of a condition later aggravated by chronic alcoholism.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way he took up with a woman who earned her living
taking baths with older men, then improved his lot by marrying a
wealthy woman who financed a high-living fling that ended when her
money and her sanity ran out. (After she tried to kill him, she was
confined to a mental hospital and O'Connor went on to charm other
women.)
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor, who began his literary career turning out surrealistic
poetry, also took to buttonholing literary lions, not always to
their delight.
</P>
<P>
   He once sent a note up to Aldous Huxley's hotel suite demanding
5 pounds and on another occasion jumped out from behind a door and
shouted ``Boo!'' at T.S. Eliot.
</P>
<P>
   One literary figure who did not shrink from such antics was
Stephen Spender, who wrote an admiring introduction to ``Memoirs''
and another when the book was reissued by Norton in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   The book, hailed for its uncompromising honesty, was greeted in
England with almost unremitting acclaim, which included an entire
BBC broadcast devoted to its merits and lavish praise from Cyril
Connolly and Philip Toynbee.
</P>
<P>
   The book eventually drew praise from the disparate likes of Saul
Bellow, Paul Bowles, Joseph Brodsky, William Burroughs, Arthur
Miller and Dorothy Parker, but generally the appreciation on this
side of the Atlantic was not unremitting.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the daily book reviewer for The New York Times, Orville
Prescott, couldn't seem to decide which he loathed more, the
``sickening book'' or the ``sick man'' who had produced it.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor, who emerged from his childhood with a lifelong disdain
for the British middle class, fared better in the Times' Sunday
Book Review, where John W. Aldrige, a professor of literature at
New York University, likened O'Connor to Yeats, praised him for his
``sharply epigrammatic wittiness'' and hailed him for revealing
himself as ``an unspeakable cad, scoundrel and snob _ in short a
brutally honest man.''
</P>
<P>
   Two autobiographical sequels, ``The Lower View'' (1960), about
bicycle visits to writers and artists, and ``Living in Croesor''
(1962), describing his sojourn in a Welsh village, were less well
received. But ``Vagrancy'' (1963), a study of those on the bottom
of British society, enjoyed a vogue on university reading lists.
</P>
<P>
   During the early 1960s O'Connor conducted a series of radio
interviews with drug addicts, alcoholics and other misfits,
including Quentin Crisp, the flamboyant eccentric who credited
O'Connor with inventing him.
</P>
<P>
   By 1967 O'Connor professed to find life in Britain so
stultifying that when he caught the eye of Panna Grady, a wealthy
New York woman 20 years his junior, he allowed her to take him to a
comfortable refuge in France, where he lived for the rest of his
life, writing thousands of letters to friends, often with abject
apologies for past hurts, and keeping a daily journal that runs to
millions of words.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his companion, Mrs. Grady; his daughter
Allaye, also of Uzes; seven other children, and eight
grandchildren.

   NEW YORK _ Call it the mystery of the vanishing premium.
Typically, when a company is taken over, shareholders get a fat
premium over the current stock price in order to entice them to
sell.
</P>
<P>
   But this week, shareholders of the Monsanto Co. were offered a
mere 19 cents a share over Monsanto's stock price of $55.375 to
fall into the arms of American Home Products, the big
pharmaceuticals company. Though another bidder may emerge, and a
shareholder suit was filed Tuesday seeking to block the deal,
investors seem likely to go along.
</P>
<P>
   Acquirers are rarely tightwads. The average premium paid,
calculated before the target company's stock price reflects some
speculation about a possible deal, is about 30 percent, according
to Houlihan Lokey Howard &AMP; Zukin, an investment banking firm in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Only three of the 25 largest combinations in the United States
have involved no premium to the current stock price, according to
the Securities Data Co. of Newark. In addition to the
Monsanto-American Home Products deal, Nationsbank's proposed
acquisition of BankAmerica, announced in April, and Bell Atlantic's
takeover of Nynex two years ago were for prices at or below the
market values of the companies the day before the announcement.
</P>
<P>
   For these companies, it seems, the premium is not missing but
simply misplaced. All three stocks had been driven up by investors
who guessed that a deal of some nature was in the works.
</P>
<P>
   In some instances, shareholders agree to accept little or no
premium because they do not have other options, and the executives
of the acquiring companies, who are using their own high-priced
stock to pay for these deals, may be reluctant to pay more for fear
of putting their own shares in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The higher the premium, the more risk you build in,''
explained Mark L. Sirower, a professor at New York University, who
has written a book on acquisitions. By paying a higher premium, a
company incorporates even more of investors' performance
expectations into its current stock price. If the deal does not
work out, the stock is likely to drop sharply.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Monsanto, for example, the stock had already run
up significantly by the time the deal was announced, according to
Donald V. Smith, a senior managing director of Houlihan Lokey. If
one calculates the premium before the move up last year, American
Home Products' bid represents a premium of roughly 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Both BankAmerica and Nynex had also benefited from investors'
expectations that a deal might be in the offing. BankAmerica had
traded in the low 60s in January before shooting up to the $86.50
Nationsbank offered, and Nynex had seen its shares increase almost
7 percent in the four months before Bell Atlantic announced its
deal.
</P>
<P>
   Surging stock prices over all have helped bring premiums down,
according to Smith. In the late 1980s, his firm calculates that
shareholders were paid premiums that averaged 50 percent or more
when their companies were taken over. Investors in RJR Nabisco
received nearly twice the value of their stock in 1988, for
example.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, shareholders may simply not be able to get anything
more for their stock. The company may be in some difficulty or need
to combine. In the case of Nynex, one of the regional Bell
operating companies, it was clear that no other bidders were
waiting in the wings willing to pay more, according to Harbir
Singh, a management professor at the University of Pennyslyvania.
What's more, both companies would have been worse off without the
deal.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Monsanto, the company and its board may have
decided that American Home's bid was the highest it would receive
even if it was somewhat below the stock's recent high of nearly
$59.
</P>
<P>
   ``Premiums are only a reflection of what people are willing to
pay on an absolute basis,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   But the lack of a premium does not necessarily indicate that the
acquiring company is getting a bargain. Monsanto, despite its
promising ventures in biotechnology, was hardly a cheap stock,
trading around 118 times its trailing earnings for each share.
</P>
<P>
   The management of American Home ``could not have afforded to pay
a higher price,'' said Tom Burnett, the director of Merger Insight,
a New York research firm. Even without a premium, the deal is
already expected to dilute American Home Products' earnings by as
much as 15 percent the first year and somewhat less the following
year.
</P>
<P>
   And even when companies don't pay a premium, the transaction can
be a disaster, Sirower of New York University noted. He cited the
Quaker Oats acquisition of Snapple, the iced-tea and juice company,
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Though Quaker did not pay a premium for the company, Snapple
lost $100 million in 1995 and continued to struggle. Last year,
Quaker sold it for $300 million, about $1.4 billion less than it
had paid for it.
</P>
<P>
   How investors react to the news on the day of the announcement
is a good indication of whether the acquiring company is
overpaying, according to Sirower. When SBC Communications paid a 27
percent premium for the Pacific Telesis Group two years ago, for
example, SBC's stock sank about 5 percent, signaling that the price
was too high.
</P>
<P>
   What about the Monsanto deal? American Home Products' stock
barely moved, gaining less than $1 to close on Monday at $49.25.
The company may not have paid a premium, but investors were in no
hurry to conclude that American Home was getting a steal.

EVANGELISTS PREACHING TO EVANGELISTS IN SALT LAKE CITY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM JONES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Consider it a theological shootout between two of the country's
most avidly evangelical faiths.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend, thousands of Southern Baptists armed with books
and videos challenging Mormon beliefs will sweep into Salt Lake
City to combine their annual convention with a door-to-door blitz
seeking to convert Mormons.
</P>
<P>
   The Mormons, secure in their own religious heartland, plan to
welcome the Baptists.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to do everything we can do to make them feel at
home. These are our brethren and sisters,'' said Gordon B. Hinkley,
the Mormon president and highest prophet of the 10 million-member
church.
</P>
<P>
   The Baptist blitz will come before and during the Southern
Baptist Convention, to be held June 9-11 in the city where half the
residents say they are members of the Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter-day Saints.
</P>
<P>
   Anson Shupe, a well-known writer on American religion and a
sociology professor at Indiana University-Purdue University in Fort
Wayne, said some wonder why Southern Baptists would venture into
the Mormon stronghold.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a bunch of mongoose going into cobra territory,''
Shupe said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a symbolic face-off of sorts,'' he said. ``But I think
Mormons will be polite hosts. It's their chance to show how
Christian they are.''
</P>
<P>
   Baptists, he said, will have their say and come away feeling
good about having made their point. And they won't be converted by
the devout Mormons they meet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baptists aren't going to suddenly see the light and soften
their beliefs,'' Shupe said. ``Neither will the Mormons.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``Crossover Salt Lake City'' evangelism effort is expected
to draw more than 3,000 Baptists _ including 500 college students _
for door-to-door witnessing, block parties, special musical events,
dramas and sports programs planned to entice converts, said the
Rev. Mike Gray, a Salt Lake City Baptist pastor and one of the
local coordinators.
</P>
<P>
   Baptist TV spots, billboard messages, newspaper ads, offers of
religious literature and a free Jesus video will be a part of the
mix.
</P>
<P>
   Hinkley urged his fellow believers to prove themselves to the
visiting Baptists.
</P>
<P>
   ``They accuse us of not being Christian,'' he said. ``I hope
that our people will try to show them, by the very manner in which
they act, that they are truly disciples of the Lord.''
</P>
<P>
   Gray, pastor of the 1,400-member Southeast Baptist Church, the
largest Baptist church in Utah, said the influx is catching the
attention of the state where Mormons are predominant.
</P>
<P>
   An editorial cartoon in a Utah newspaper recently proclaimed:
``The Baptists Are Coming _ The Baptists Are Coming,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Like the 15.9 million-member Southern Baptist denomination, the
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints focuses on winning
converts.
</P>
<P>
   The Latter-day Saints, nicknamed Mormons because they hold as
sacred the teachings of ``The Book of Mormon,'' have 58,000 young
male and female missionaries who witness door-to-door worldwide.
The latest Mormon reports say the church averages 950 new members a
day.
</P>
<P>
   One reason that Southern Baptists say Mormons are not Christian
is because they do not rely solely on the Bible as their standard
of faith.
</P>
<P>
   Mormons base their faith on the Bible and other religious
writings, such as the ``The Book of Mormon,'' which is held to be
another testament of Jesus Christ as translated by church founder
Joseph Smith from gold tablets he said an angel revealed to him.
</P>
<P>
   Two other books, ``The Pearl of Great Price'' and ``The Doctrine
of the Covenants,'' are also used in Mormon teachings.
</P>
<P>
   One of the big differences between the Mormon doctrine and that
of some other Christian denominations is that Latter-day Saints
believe God still speaks to human prophets, just as he did in
ancient Israel, said Stephen D. Posey, president of the
Euless-based office for Mormon missionaries who work in the Fort
Worth area, far West Texas and parts of New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Heavens are not closed,'' Posey said. ``God spoke to
Joseph Smith and each successive prophet of the church, even Gordon
B. Hinkley.''
</P>
<P>
   Baptists and Mormons agree on many lifestyle and social issues;
both decry the drinking of alcoholic beverages and oppose abortion
and pornography.
</P>
<P>
   Shupe said the excursion to Salt Lake City is part of a trend in
recent years in which the Southern Baptist denomination has chosen
convention sites where they could make a symbolic statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``They even met in Las Vegas,'' where they marched through ``The
Strip'' gambling district, Shupe said. ``If Sodom and Gomorrah
still existed, you can bet Baptists would book a convention
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Baptists decided several years ago to meet in Salt Lake City as
a means of boosting what they call their ``pioneer'' work in the
western states. The ``crossover'' campaigns have been held along
with national conventions for several years.
</P>
<P>
   Baptists say they are just following biblical commands to share
their faith.
</P>
<P>
   Mormons ``are not Christian as we see it,'' said the Rev. Claude
Thomas, pastor of the First Baptist Church of Euless and president
of the Southern Baptist Pastors Conference. Thomas said more than
100 volunteers from his church will be working in the evangelism
push.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas said the Mormons shouldn't be offended.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have missionaries proselytizing all over the world. I
would think they would give us the same latitude.''
</P>
<P>
   The Southern Baptists started pointing toward the Salt Lake City
convention last year at their convention in Dallas with the first
showing of ``The Mormon Puzzle,'' a video that has been sent to
about 40,000 Baptist churches.
</P>
<P>
   It quotes Mormon leaders' statements about their beliefs but
adds commentaries from Southern Baptist leaders saying that Mormons
are not true Christians.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, R. Philip Roberts, , director of the Interfaith
Witness Division of the Baptist North American Mission Board in
Alpharetta, Ga., has written ``Mormonism Unmasked.''
</P>
<P>
   Roberts contends that Mormons try to deceive people into
believing they are orthodox Christians. His book is filled with
advice to Baptists on how to approach Mormons.
</P>
<P>
   ``In seeking to win Mormons to Christ, don't get involved in
discussing temple undergarments or secret handshakes or the hidden
and sordid secrets of the life of Joseph Smith,'' he writes.
``Sharing the gospel must take priority over all other elements of
discussion.''
</P>
<P>
   He ends his book with the paragraph: ``Keep lovingly pointing
Mormons to the Christ of the Bible's gospel. In him they will find
the salvation that eludes them and yet is so near.''

CALIFORNIANS SELECT EXPERIENCED CANDIDATES, REJECT BILINGUAL
EDUCATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also CALIF-LABOR) 
(th) 
 By TODD S. PURDUM    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Despite record spending by a handful of wealthy
candidates, Californians embraced the established political order
in their primary election on Tuesday, and set the stage for a fall
contest between two conventional career politicians, Democratic Lt.
Gov. Gray Davis and Republican state Attorney General Dan Lungren.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the signs of contentment with the status quo, voters
sent a powerful signal of discontent with the once renowned
California public schools, decisively passing a ballot measure to
curtail three decades of bilingual instruction.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative was opposed by President Clinton and much of the
state's educational establishment, and Wednesday a coalition of
civil rights groups announced that they had filed suit to block it
as unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the overwhelming message was one of relative satisfaction
in a state that has rebounded sharply from economic and natural
disasters, with two-thirds of voters saying California was
generally moving in the right direction, according to surveys of
voters leaving the polls by The Los Angeles Times and CNN.
</P>
<P>
   Davis defeated his richer Democratic rivals, who drew heavily on
their personal fortunes to make their campaigns, by a margin of
nearly 3 to 1, and even ran just slightly ahead of Lungren, who
faced no real opposition for his party's nomination Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   A similar dynamic emerged in the race for the Republican Senate
nomination, where State Treasurer Matthew Fong staved off a
self-financed $10 million challenge from Darrell Issa, a
multimillionaire car alarm manufacturer, to win the right to
challenge U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think collectively Californians are saying, `Don't rock the
boat,''' said Mark DiCamillo, director of the statewide Field Poll
in San Francisco. ``They do want to make some changes in the
direction of the state, but pretty much they're not looking for
radical change this year, and that has a lot to do with the health
of the state's economy after years of problems. Cautious optimism
is the byword now.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a striking comeback for Davis, 55. Just months ago his
candidacy was dismissed by many party insiders and pundits, who
argued that he could not hope to compete against Al Checchi, a
multimillionaire businessman who was making his first run for
elective office and spent some $40 million of his own money, the
U.S. record for a non presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   That worked out to about $59 a vote for Checchi, compared to
about $5 a vote for Davis, who still managed to at least tie the
old record of $9 million for spending in a gubernatorial primary
here. Ms. Harman spent about $16 million, most of it her own money,
for about $24 a vote.
</P>
<P>
   But Checchi's campaign was Wednesday widely viewed as a
cautionary tale about the limits of seemingly limitless spending,
and the danger that by attacking one candidate in a three-candidate
field, as he did with Ms. Harman, an opening is created for the
third candidate to emerge unscathed _ i.e., Davis.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the state, it was mostly a day of triumph for
familiar faces, including former Gov. Jerry Brown, who won 59
percent of the vote to become mayor of Oakland without a runoff,
and for former Rep. Robert Dornan of Orange County, who easily
defeated two Republican rivals to win the nomination to challenge
Rep. Loretta Sanchez, the Democrat who defeated him in 1996 by just
984 votes.
</P>
<P>
   The sole incumbent to lose his seat was Rep. Jay Kim, a
Republican from Diamond Bar, who pleaded guilty last year to
accepting illegal campaign donations and had to campaign
long-distance from Washington, where he must wear an electronic
surveillance device. He was defeated for the nomination by state
Assemblyman Gary Miller.
</P>
<P>
   ``The amateur hour is over,'' Mark Mellman, a veteran Democratic
pollsters, said of the voters' preference for experienced
politicians over untried newcomers, a sharp contrast with the
zeitgeist of the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   With 99 percent of precincts reporting in unofficial returns,
Davis had 1,880,030 votes, or 35 percent of the total cast in the
state's new open primary, in which the names of all candidates
appeared on the same ballot regardless of party.
</P>
<P>
   Lungren had 1,830,591 votes, or 34 percent, with Checchi
trailing with 682,012, or 13 percent, just ahead of another
self-financed millionaire, Rep. Jane Harman of south suburban Los
Angeles, who drew 663,151 votes, or 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Davis' strikingly strong finish could be a bad omen for Lungren,
51, a former conservative congressman from Long Beach who enjoys
support from the state's Republican establishment, but could not
manage to muster stronger turnout in the primary, despite spending
some $4 million, most of it on television advertising, in an effort
to establish a presence against the Democrats' early attacks.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, surveys of voters leaving the polls showed
that nearly two-thirds think it is time for a change in control of
the governor's office, which has been held by Republicans for the
last 16 years, and for 24 of the past 32 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am overwhelmed by the vote last night,'' Davis told
supporters at a brief Democratic unity rally Wednesday morning in
downtown Los Angeles, at which Checchi and Ms. Harman both pledged
their support in the fall campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But he added: ``I'm under no illusions. This will be a real
challenge and we'll be tested time and again.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate race, Fong, 43, the state treasurer since 1995,
defeated Issa by a margin of 22 percent to 19 percent, or 1,158,391
votes to 1,028,682. Boxer, the Democratic incumbent, drew more
votes than both her rivals combined, or 2,322,517 for 44 percent of
the total.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, according to the voter surveys, Democrats appeared to
turn out in disproportionately higher numbers than Republicans,
with nearly four in 10 voters belonging to union households,
according to The Los Angeles Times/CNN survey.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats were apparently energized by the campaign against the
union dues ballot measure, in contrast to the last statewide
gubernatorial primary, in which both parties turned out equally.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just extraordinary union turnout,'' said Bill Carrick,
a veteran Democratic strategist who worked for Ms. Harman this year
and said he did not believe labor had turned out in such force here
since a right-to-work measure was on the ballot 40 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Davis' strategists, taking a gentle victory lap at the party
rally Wednesday morning, said their surveys had repeatedly shown
throughout the year that Davis' 23 years' experience in state
government _ beginning as chief of staff to Brown _ would resonate
with voters once he got his own message (``Experience Money Can't
Buy'') out over the blizzard of Checchi's television commercials,
many of which harshly attacked Ms. Harman.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was what the voters were looking for,'' said Davis' media
consultant, David Doak. ``Sometimes voters just get in a mood, and
I told him months ago, `They're in the mood for you.'''
</P>
<P>
   The one thing voters seemed determined to change was the
existing system of bilingual education, in which non-native English
speakers are taught basic subjects in their native tongue while
also learning English.
</P>
<P>
   The program, a legacy of the civil rights movement of the 1960s,
has been widely denounced as ineffective in preparing a huge new
generation of immigrant children for the job market, and
pre-election polls had shown majorities of all ethnic and racial
groups supporting it, despite the opposition of much of the state's
political leadership, including all four gubernatorial candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The measure won 61 percent to 39 percent in unofficial returns,
though black and Hispanic support for it fell below 50 percent.
According to The Los Angeles Times/CNN survey, fewer than four in
10 Hispanic voters backed the measure, and just under half of
blacks, while nearly six in 10 Asian voters and nearly seven in 10
whites supported it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won a tremendous victory against overwhelming obstacles,''
said Ron Unz, a multimillionaire software entrepreneur from Silicon
Valley who sponsored the measure, which would essentially limit
non-English speakers to one intensive year of instruction. ``The
California immigrant population has also won a victory.''
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday morning, a group of Hispanic and civil rights
groups announced that they had already filed suit in San Francisco
to block the measure as unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Litigation has become a routine tool against many of the ballot
measures passed in the state in recent years, with some of them,
like Proposition 187, the 1994 measure that cut off benefits for
legal immigrants, still tied up in court.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents, including immigrant parents, should have the right to
make basic choices about their children's education,'' said Deborah
Escobedo, a lawyer with Multicultural Education, Training and
Advocacy, one of the groups that sued Wednesday. ``All children,
including immigrant children, should have the right to learn
academic English and have access to science, math and history.
Proposition 227 takes away these basic rights.'' &QL;

BORDEAUX VITNERS SHAKEN BY WINEMAKING SCANDAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By FRANK J. PRIAL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In what could become France's biggest wine scandal in decades,
one of Bordeaux's most prestigious wine properties, Chateau
Giscours, has been charged with fraudulent winemaking practices.
</P>
<P>
   One of the current winemakers and a former managing director of
the chateau's wine operations have been indicted for fraud by a
Bordeaux magistrate.
</P>
<P>
   According to the charges, disclosed on Monday, cheap wine from
another district was added to the chateau's wine, wine from two
different vintages were blended together, excess sugar was added to
the wine to raise the alcohol content, and wood chips were used to
give some of the chateau's wine the taste and smell of wine that
had been aged in oak barrels.
</P>
<P>
   Giscours, one of the largest estates in the Medoc, was one of
the 61 chateaus _ out of thousands in Bordeaux _ that were included
in the 1855 classification which remains the standard by which
prestige Bordeaux wines are known.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation leading to Monday's announcement had been
under way since 1996, when a disgruntled former employee at the
chateau told investigators from the government agency known as the
Service de Fraud that cheap wine had been mixed with the chateau's
prestige vintage wine and that sugar, water and certain acids had
been added to some vats of the 1995 vintage, then in the chateau's
cellars.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation stemming from those charges took more than two
years because, according to the Bordeaux prosecutors, experts had
to establish whether these practices were a one-time affair or
standard procedure at Giscours.
</P>
<P>
   According to a report in the Bordeaux newspaper Sud-Ouest, the
experts concluded that fraudulent techniques had been used over a
period of years. It was while investigating the charges that
Giscours had put oak chips or staves in its wine _ to fake the
taste of barrel-aging _ that other irregularities were discovered,
according to press reports in Paris. The fraud investigators
informed the prosecutor's office in Bordeaux, which handed down the
indictments.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years Giscours had loomed larger than many of its
peers in Bordeaux, in part because of its size _ it is one of the
largest wine properties in the region _ in part because its wines
were usually of good quality and reasonable price, and in part
because of the tireless promotional efforts of its owner in the
1970s and '80s, Pierre Tari. Tari, dynamic and articulate, traveled
the world selling his wine, headed various professional
organizations in Bordeaux, and even fielded his own polo team at
Giscours. He much preferred to be photographed with a polo mallet
than with a glass of wine.
</P>
<P>
   The charges against Chateau Giscours came at what could be a
critical time for Bordeaux. Prices for Bordeaux wines have reached
levels undreamed of even a decade ago, prompting accusations of
greed and arrogance against the chateau owners and the exporters
who serve as middlemen for much of the Bordeaux's most expensive
wines.
</P>
<P>
   Citing the Giscours affair, several French wine commentators
noted that when one property is accused of fraud, suspicion quickly
falls on the entire region. They recalled the scandals of 1972 and
1973 in which one of the most famous exporters, the Cruse firm, was
found guilty of offenses similar to those with which Giscours is
charged. In the aftermath, the entire Bordeaux market collapsed.
Other export firms went bankrupt, chateaus were shuttered or sold,
and the wine business did not recover until the end of the decade.

<P>
   The Tari family came to Bordeaux in 1952 from Algiers where they
had made a fortune in winemaking. When they bought Giscours that
year, it had been neglected for years. Only about 20 of its 750
acres were still planted in vines. They improved the property and
produced some excellent wines.
</P>
<P>
   Because of long-standing family disputes, the quality of the
wine suffered in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and the family
sold the vineyards in 1995 to a Dutch investor, retaining the
chateau.
</P>
<P>
   Differences among the Taris were said to be so pronounced that
Pierre Tari communicated with his father, Nicolas, who preceded him
as head of Giscours, and his daughter, Nicole, who succeeded him,
and who both live at the chateau, only by fax.
</P>
<P>
   Both the elder Tari and Nicole opposed the sale and have
retained the chateau and part of the estate. One chateau employe
told Le Monde that the family feud cost the father and daughter
almost $20,000 a month in lawyers' fees.
</P>
<P>
   The new owner, Eric Albada Jelgersma, is said to know little
about wine and rarely visits Bordeaux. He is said to have talked to
the examining magistrate in Bordeaux, the equivalent of a
prosecutor in the United States, but was not charged.
</P>
<P>
   Chateau Giscours wines are generally respected by critics, both
in France and in the United States, but they have not been singled
out for exceptional praise for many years.
</P>
<P>
   Commenting on the 1996 vintage, which is now on the market, the
critic Robert Parker Jr. wrote last year: ``A commercial style of
winemaking has resulted in a deep ruby-colored 1996 Giscours that
is forward, soft and fruity but lacking class, complexity and
depth.''

HOUSE VOTES ON AMENDMENT TO ALLOW PRAYER IN SCHOOLS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS BLACK  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Reflecting House Republicans' promises to promote
legislation important to conservatives, the chamber will vote
Thursday on a constitutional amendment that would reverse decades
of Supreme Court rulings defining the separation of church and
state.
</P>
<P>
   The Religious Freedom Amendment is expected to fall far short of
the two-thirds majority, or about 290 votes, needed to pass. But
supporters Wednesday hailed Thursday's vote as a significant step.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very pleased. We're very excited about this,'' said Jeff
Taylor of the Christian Coalition. ``If we don't get the
two-thirds, we'll bring it up again and build on the momentum.''
</P>
<P>
   This will be the first vote in 27 years on a school prayer
constitutional amendment.
</P>
<P>
   The amendment would make it easier for public school students to
participate in voluntary prayers, and would allow the display of
religious symbols on public property and the use of public money to
pay for religious school education. Opposing the measure are
President Clinton and a coalition of civil liberties and religious
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in his radio address on Saturday, called amending the
constitution ``the wrong way'' to go.
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Leader Richard Armey, Republican of Texas, said
Wednesday, ``Any time you are trying to amend the Constitution, you
might expect to have to vote more than once before you get the
two-thirds.'' He said the amendment is being brought up for a vote
despite the long odds of success to generate ``a serious national
discussion'' on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Americans United for Separation of Church and State, a
Washington-based group, said it had solicited 185 firm ``no'' votes
on the amendment, enough to keep the amendment well short of
passage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's appalling,'' said the Rev. Barry W. Lynn, director of the
group, ``that congressional leaders would allow TV preacher Pat
Robertson and other Religious Right extremists to attempt a radical
rewrite of the Bill of Rights.''
</P>
<P>
   But Representative Ernest J. Istook Jr., an Oklahoma Republican
and author of the measure, said a constitutional amendment is
needed to ``correct'' Supreme Court decisions that he blamed for a
deterioration of moral standards in public schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``As prayer has gone out of school, guns, drugs, and gangs have
gone in,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Carman, a popular Christian singer, presented Istook Wednesday
with 32 cardboard boxes containing 1 million signatures gathered
from fans at his concerts in support of the amendment.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we took God out of the classroom, we had to put metal
detectors at the doors,'' said Carman, a Trenton, N.J., native who
fills football stadiums on his evangelical crusades.
</P>
<P>
   He said the first Supreme Court ruling that banned a school
prayer in New York in 1962 coincided with an increase in divorce,
adultery, sexually transmitted diseases, unwed mothers, sexual
abuse of children, and violent crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost like something supernatural took place,'' he said.
``Something is wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   The vote is one of a variety of steps taken by Republican
leaders to appeal to social conservatives, who make up a critical
part of the GOP base in a congressional election year.
</P>
<P>
   A month ago, Republican leaders formed a Values Action Team
headed by Pennsylvania Representative Joseph Pitts to coordinate
legislative strategy with conservative groups that included the
Christian Coalition, the Family Research Council, and the National
Right to Life Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The school prayer amendment was one of three top priorities. The
others were abolishing the National Endowment for the Arts and
outlawing the medical procedure that critics call ``partial-birth
abortion.'' Clinton vetoed the abortion ban last year, and an
override vote is scheduled later this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must never forget this country was founded by forefathers
who were seeking freedom of religion, not freedom from religion,''
Pitts said Wednesday.

JERRY BROWN WINS OAKLAND'S MAYORAL PRIMARY 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also CALIF-ELECT, CALIF-OAKLAND) 
(af) 
 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ When the moment came, Jerry Brown's reaction
was every bit as unusual as both his candidacy and the al fresco
victory celebration that concluded it, which featured 500 pounds of
sizzling barbecue and a performance by a rock band called the Naked
Barbies.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a strangely blank expression, Brown refused to
acknowledge his election as Oakland's next mayor, even though
three-quarters of the precincts had reported and he had received
close to 60 percent of their vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``That really looks good,'' Brown deadpanned as the clock ticked
past midnight into the first minutes of this morning. ``I wouldn't
bet against me.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, pressed by reporters to declare victory in the
time-honored fashion, he replied: ``That's an old ritual. We're
trying to break new ground in Oakland.''
</P>
<P>
   Never one to conform to expectations, Brown was not about to
start doing so early Wednesday, when it became clear that he had
capped one of the oddest acts of political resurrection in many
years by capturing so much of the vote in the mayoral primary here
that he did not have to face a November runoff against any of his
10 opponents.
</P>
<P>
   His unusual demeanor at an unusual street party underscored that
Edmund G. Brown Jr., former two-term governor of California and
three-time presidential candidate, will be a mayor unlike any that
Oakland, the state's seventh-most-populous city, has ever seen.
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks and days leading up to the primary, voters said
they wanted a mayor with visibility, someone who could tug Oakland
out of San Francisco's shadow and attract national attention.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's schedule Wednesday suggested that Oaklanders might be
getting exactly that. He awoke at 3:35 a.m. for an appearance on
``Good Morning, America,'' followed by interviews with CNN, MSNBC
and CNBC.
</P>
<P>
   It was an itinerary worthy of a new governor or senator, and an
echo of the way Brown's political celebrity allowed him to dominate
news coverage of the mayoral race from the moment he announced his
candidacy in November.
</P>
<P>
   Some of his opponents said they never really had a chance, so
intrigued were reporters by Brown's surprising courtship of Oakland
and so flattered were Oaklanders by his entreaties.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was so much noise, the rest of us were never heard,''
said Ed Blakely, an urban planning professor, who finished second
in the race.
</P>
<P>
   Blakely's campaign coordinator, Laura Ingram, put it more
succinctly: ``This has been like running against Elvis.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown won 58.7 percent of the vote, four times Blakely's 14.9
percent. Under the rules of Oakland's nonpartisan mayoral primary,
a candidate needed more than 50 percent to avoid a runoff in
November.
</P>
<P>
   By easily clearing that hurdle to become the first white
candidate to win a mayoral race here in two decades, Brown
demonstrated just how frustrated Oaklanders were with their city's
persistent problems and troubled image and how willing they were to
put their faith in a relative newcomer.
</P>
<P>
   Along with several friends and associates, Brown moved into a
three-story tin-shelled loft opposite the Amtrak station in
downtown Oakland just three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Elihu Harris, the city's current mayor, who did not seek
re-election, said he worried that Oaklanders were expecting a quick
fix from Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people are looking for a change that is so rapid as to
perhaps be unrealistic, that all of a sudden you can heal the sick,
educate the illiterate, that all those things can happen simply by
electing a mayor,'' Harris said late Tuesday night when he stopped
by the noisy party outside Brown's loft to congratulate him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to have to deal with the nitty-gritty reality of a
city with resource problems and very complex demands,'' Harris
warned.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, 60, who will take office in January, said he understood
that. ``It's very daunting,'' he acknowledged early Wednesday
morning, when he finally had to own up to his resounding victory.
</P>
<P>
   He added that there was nothing harder than tackling entrenched
urban problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a reason why the major politicians in the country stay
out of the cities and deal with globalization and Pakistan and all
these other issues,'' he said. ``Because they're easier.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night, while his close aides milled in the loft's
downstairs near a large red circle on the floor that signifies
unity, hundreds of people outside gobbled pork ribs and hot dogs. A
large stage accommodated not only the Naked Barbies, who sang a
dirge about the special agony of losing a dog, but also several
follow-up acts, including a troupe that performed West African
dance and a rap group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerry Brown _ it's all love, it's all support, it's all
positive!'' one of the rappers shouted. ``Grass roots, baby!''
</P>
<P>
   Brown shooed away questions about whether, as his opponents
sometimes contended, the Oakland mayoralty was simply a way for him
to get back into the political game after 15 years out of elective
office.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's putting the horse before the cart,'' Brown said. It was
unclear whether he was bungling the order of the words or being
mischievous.

ARMS INSPECTORS BRIEF DIPLOMATS ON IRAQI DECEPTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (ja)  
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Armed with spy-plane and satellite photographs
never before shown to diplomats, U.N. arms inspectors Wednesday
gave the Security Council a daylong display of evidence that they
have gathered in an attempt to counter Iraq's contentions that it
has disarmed and deserves to have sanctions lifted.
</P>
<P>
   An unexpected second day of briefings will be held on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. representative, Bill Richardson, said he was encouraged
by the presentation, which began while a small group of American
protesters marched outside the U.N. headquarters and called for an
end to the embargo imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990. The
United States and Britain are the strongest advocates on the
council of continued sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Iraq has been dealt a devastating blow to its credibility,''
Richardson said after several hours of seeing graphic projections
and photographic evidence relating to President Saddam Hussein's
long-range missile program. ``I think Iraq had a bad day here.''
</P>
<P>
   Detailed briefings on the Iraqi biological and chemical weapons
programs were given in the afternoon in what was to be the
concluding session of a special meeting called to lay out a ``road
map'' toward the end of sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   But just before 6 p.m. the Security Council president for June,
Antonio Monteiro of Portugal, adjourned the meeting and scheduled
the second day of briefings to hear about Iraqi methods of
concealing evidence. The council will also be told about the range
and importance of documents that are missing from Baghdad's
accounts of its programs.
</P>
<P>
   The meetings began Wednesday with a general history of the
experience that the U.N. Special Commission has had with Hussein's
government. Since 1991 the inspectors have been charged with
eliminating Iraqi weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Inspectors recalled the epiphany of 1995, when the defection of
a son-in-law of Hussein led to the finding of considerable evidence
that Iraq had been concealing. That came to light just as some
inspectors were confident that they were nearing the end of their
work.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats described the unusually detailed technical
presentation on the missile system as useful but said that it was
too soon to know whether the proceedings had changed minds on the
15-member council, which seems to be losing interest in Iraqi
sanctions after nearly eight years.
</P>
<P>
   The French, Russians and Chinese, considered to be the countries
most sympathetic to Iraq, asked probing questions, diplomats said.
The three countries have put the inspectors under considerable
pressure to find new violations or end the disarmament process of
their work and graduate Iraq to long-term monitoring.
</P>
<P>
   The arms experts, led by the executive chairman of the
commission, Richard Butler, tried to show what Iraq had do to meet
the requirements to end the sanctions and also how Iraqi behavior
made it difficult to accept government declarations at face value.
</P>
<P>
   Using aerial photographs taken in July 1991, Butler said
repeated Iraqi assertions that they had destroyed missile launchers
that month were not matched by photographic evidence of the sites.
When confronted, the Iraqis suddenly said the destruction had been
carried out in October, Butler said.
</P>
<P>
   On other occasions surveillance by American U-2s on loan to the
commission and satellite imagery provided by governments showed
activity at times and in places where the Iraqis said nothing was
occurring, the diplomats were told.
</P>
<P>
   A member of the Special Commission also told the council about
the problems created by Iraq's destruction of weapons, or
assertions of having destroyed them, given the difficulties of
verifying the actions.
</P>
<P>
   A team of 27 international experts on missiles is in Iraq for a
month to excavate sites where warheads were reported to have been
buried. The experts, concerned that biological or chemical agents
might have been loaded on the warheads, are collecting samples for
analysis in the United States. Security Council members were told
here that serious unanswered questions remained on the disposition
of missile propellants, warheads and production efforts in which
Iraq tried to recreate Russian weapons from Baghdad resources.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday an Iraqi team led by Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed
al-Sahaf made a three-hour presentation to the council in an
informal session in which the Iraqis set out to demonstrate that
they had met all the disarmament requirements for the lifting of
sanctions. They are demanding an end to the embargo in October,
after the next major Security Council review of Iraqi compliance.
</P>
<P>
   After that briefing, Britain's representative, Sir John Weston,
called the presentation ``a cynical exercise in casuistry and
obfuscation.''

HOUSE REPUBLICANS AGREE TO END A TIMBER SUBSIDY 
</HEADLINE>
  (dc) 
 By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After years of bitter debate over logging on public
lands, House Republican leaders have agreed to end one of the
federal government's longstanding subsidies for the timber
industry.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, timber companies that harvest logs from national
forests have been able to offset the costs of roads that they first
must carve into the woods. In compensation for those road-building
expenses, the Forest Service has given the companies credits that
have been used to reduce the price for trees taken from public
lands.
</P>
<P>
   For years, environmental advocates and opponents of government
subsidies for businesses have fought the practice as economically
wasteful and ecologically foolhardy.
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement, which linked logging and road building in a
rebate system in which money spent on roads could be counted as
partial payment for timber, was seen by environmental advocates as
reinforcing two activities that wreak compound damage on forests.
Quite apart from the logging, the forest roads break up wildlife
habitat and promote erosion that scars the land and fills clean
streams with sediment, environmental groups say.
</P>
<P>
   Republican lawmakers on both sides of the debate have decided it
was time to concede victory to the industry's opponents and to
accept the Clinton administration's proposals to end the subsidy
program, which is known as the timber purchaser road credit.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the compromise, which aides said was endorsed by
House Speaker Newt Gingrich, the two sides agreed not to propose or
support any other amendments relating to forestry when the annual
spending bill that pays for the Forest Service's operations comes
to the floor this summer.
</P>
<P>
   This tactic is designed to foreclose an effort by
environmentalists to cut other road-building programs from the
agency's budget.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed accord among Republicans brings together some of
the logging industry's most loyal allies and some of its persistent
adversaries, as well as chairmen of the House committees that deal
with forest policy. Thus, it could effectively snuff out the forest
debate.
</P>
<P>
   That is why the deal has nonetheless upset some environmental
advocates who oppose all forms of federal support for logging and
have been working for broader reductions in logging on public
lands, especially in areas without roads.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement was pushed mainly by Rep. John Edward Porter,
Republican of Illinois, and it demonstrated the continuing
influence of a bloc of some 30 to 50 moderate Republicans with
pro-environment leanings. It also suggests that the House
leadership has little stomach for divisive environmental debates in
the last few months before Congress adjourns for elections this
fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congressman Porter regards this as a major victory for
environmental common sense as well as a fiscally sound change in
policy,'' said Dave Kohn, Porter's spokesman. ``This is a major
victory for the environmental wing of the party.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Among the Republicans who met last Thursday in Gingrich's office
to shake hands on the agreement, aides said, were Reps. Don Young
of Alaska, the chairman of the Resources Committee; Helen Chenoweth
of Idaho; Ralph Regula of Ohio, chairman of the appropriations
subcommittee on the Interior; Sherwood Boehlert of upstate New
York; James Saxton of New Jersey; George Nethercutt of Washington,
George Radanovich and Wally Herger of California and James
Greenwood of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Although only Republicans have endorsed the deal, it appears
likely that they have the numbers to prevail in the House, even if
some Democrats object. The Senate would have to agree, as well, for
the plan to become law.
</P>
<P>
   Last year a spirited debate on the issue split the House and the
Senate in two narrow floor votes, with the industry barely
prevailing to protect the road-building program.
</P>
<P>
   Industry officials contend that the program is not a subsidy at
all, in the sense that without the road credits loggers would
simply offer to pay less for the logs they remove.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purchaser road credit has created a lot of controversy,
and I think it is unnecessary controversy,'' said James English,
president of Idaho Forest Industry Inc., which runs sawmills in and
around Coeur d'Alene, Idaho. The company has about 500 employees
and annual sales of about $180 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not a big company, and it will cost us some money up
front, but over all the important thing is to be able to get into
the federal forest to get the timber,'' English said. ``If we can
eliminate this environmental conflict, pitting the environmental
movement against us and using the road credits to do it, then I
think it is best to get rid of them.''
</P>
<P>
   He said his company used to get almost a third of its timber
from Forest Service land but it now gets only about 5 percent, as
the Forest Service has cut back its sales in the area.
</P>
<P>
   The Forest Service says the dollar value of the credits program
has declined in recent years. In 1996 it was worth $41 million. In
that year, timber companies bid $450 million for logs from the
agency's forests.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement does not, however, mean that no more roads will be
built to haul timber from public lands. The Forest Service
continues to have its own budget for building and maintaining
roads. And timber companies will still build roads, using their own
money, to take logging trucks and other equipment into the woods.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce H. Hamilton, national conservation director for the Sierra
Club, said the Republicans are ``cutting an unfortunate deal which
is bad for the forest.'' He said the environmental group would work
with Democrats to make deeper cuts in the logging budget.

BILL LETS CHARITIES KEEP MONEY OF BANKRUPT GIVERS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Utah)  (ja)  
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congress made it easier Wednesday for churches and
charitable organizations to keep donations made by people who have
filed for bankruptcy and also for those debtors to continue making
charitable donations.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate passed the bill unanimously last month and the House
passed it unanimously on voice vote Wednesday. It is on its way to
President Clinton, who is expected to sign it.
</P>
<P>
   Under the current tax code, a person's donation to a church or
charity within a year of filing for bankruptcy is considered an
attempt to hide assets and therefore a fraudulent transaction.
</P>
<P>
   The bill says that even if a donation was made shortly before a
person filed for bankruptcy, creditors cannot seek repayment from
the church or charity. It also allows the debtor to continue giving
up to 15 percent of income to a church or charity for one year
after declaring bankruptcy. A bankruptcy court would determine if
the donation was consistent with the debtor's practices of giving
before going bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
   The bill stemmed from a 1992 court case in Minnesota that
allowed a bankruptcy trustee to recapture thousands of dollars in
past tithes from a church. Lawmakers said they feared that the
ruling would prompt creditors across the nation to ransack the
offering plates of churches in order to recoup their losses from
people who are insolvent.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ron Packard, R-Calif., a Mormon and the chief sponsor of
the measure in the House, said that his own church _ the Church of
Latter Day Saints in Salt Lake City _ had 100 suits filed against
it.
</P>
<P>
   The measure was avidly sought by members of the religious right,
initially to protect churches. But its sponsors realized it would
not pass constitutional muster if it limited its benefits to
churches.
</P>
<P>
   An objection came from members of the National Bankruptcy
Conference, lawyers and judges who handle bankruptcy cases. Stephen
Case, a spokesman for the group, testified in February: ``Congress
should not slice up our fraudulent transfer laws with special
interest exceptions, no matter how deserving the special interest
groups may be.''

CLINTON ATTENDS CONVENTION OF YOUTH VOLUNTEER GROUPS
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ Seven years after he visited participants of
Boston's City Year program, President Clinton came to the
youth-volunteer organization's national convention Wednesday to
praise its good work and urge members to strive for both national
service and racial reconciliation in the spirit of Robert F.
Kennedy, who was slain 30 years ago this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can finish the work that was done when I was your age by
the people you saw in that video,'' Clinton said, referring to
footage before his speech that featured Robert Kennedy, John F.
Kennedy, and Martin Luther King Jr. ``Your generation will have a
chance to make that the history of the 21st century.''
</P>
<P>
   In linking national service to racial reconciliation, Clinton
was in essence confronting two major presidential initiatives he
has touted with mixed results.
</P>
<P>
   His volunteerism summit last April in Philadelphia hardly
produced an army of volunteers fanning across the country doing
good deeds, as it was designed to do. And his race initiative,
which is a year old this month, has, by most accounts, fallen short
of sparking the kind of candid conversation about race in America
that smashes stereotypes and helps eliminate racism.
</P>
<P>
   But that didn't keep Clinton from promoting the two in his
speech to about 1,000 cheering national youth service corps
volunteers from Boston, where City Year started in 1988, and eight
other cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that the key to solving a lot of our racial tensions
in America is to make sure we keep living together, working
together, learning together, and in some ways, most important of
all _ serving together, giving together,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton visited Boston in 1991 and held a roundtable
discussion with five young people who were serving as City Year
Corps members, he was a little-known candidate for president.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did he become president, but the program grew from one
city to nine. A Seattle program will start this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I went to City Year in Boston, the lights came on in my
mind and I said, `This is what I want to do,''' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Of that 1991 visit, Clinton joked: ``I was there as a candidate
for president with about a 1 percent name recognition in
Massachusetts. And so I had a lot of time on my hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I spent the better part of the day, as I recall, talking
to the young people in City Year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One of those young people was Stephen Spaloss, who told Clinton
how his life had been transformed through service. Spaloss had
taken the City Year sweat shirt off his back and given it to
Clinton. Clinton said he still has the sweat shirt and wears it
while jogging.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Spaloss, who has since been named co-executive
director of the City Year program in Philadelphia, presented
Clinton with the group's ``Lifetime of Idealism Award'' and a City
Year baseball cap.
</P>
<P>
   City Year, founded in Boston as a private, nonprofit
organization, operates the national service corps for 17- to
24-year-olds who exchange a year of community service for a weekly
stipend and an education award from AmeriCorps, of which City Year
is a member.
</P>
<P>
   Corps members perform a variety of services: running
after-school programs, tutoring and mentoring children, teaching
HIV and violence prevention, and turning vacant urban lots into
community gardens.
</P>
<P>
   Several weeks ago, about 600 corps members wrote Clinton asking
him to come and speak during their four-day convention, which ends
tomorrow, at John Carroll University in a Cleveland suburb.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's event was part high-school pep rally and part
political campaign, as corps members _ dressed in khaki pants,
white T-shirts, and red jackets _ celebrated the end of their year
of service.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also used the occasion to drum up support for national
tobacco legislation among young people.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some in Congress who seem determined to stall, stop
or kill the tobacco bill,'' the president said. ``I hope you will
help me send a loud message back to Washington, D.C., to act and
act now.''

BOEING PULLS PLU ON MD-11 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KAREN WEST  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Faced with a lack of airline customers, Boeing pulled the plug
Wednesday on its newly inherited MD-11, commercial aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Production of the three-engine, long-range commercial jet _ the
last to bear the McDonnell Douglas nameplate _ will end in February
2000. It's the same airplane that McDonnell Douglas, once among the
world's biggest aircraft makers, put into service less than eight
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   About 4,000 jobs _ most of which are in Southern California _
could be lost as a result, but Boeing said it will try to transfer
many of those employees to other areas within the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite our best marketing efforts, it became clear to us that
there simply was not enough customer interest in either the
passenger or freighter versions of this airplane to justify keeping
the production line open,'' said Ron Woodard, president of Boeing's
Commercial Airplane Group.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's announcement, which had been expected throughout the
aerospace industry, is the third McDonnell Douglas jet model Boeing
has scrapped since acquiring the company in a $16.3 billion stock
deal last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Woodard had warned in March of a ``lack of interest'' in the
wide-body jet, which the company had been marketing as a freight
hauler.
</P>
<P>
   The MD-11, derived from the DC-10, was launched in 1986, first
flew on Jan. 10, 1990, and entered service the following December.
</P>
<P>
   Demand for the aircraft has declined since November and as of
April 30, Boeing had a backlog of only 13 firm orders and nine
options for the jet.
</P>
<P>
   The airplane currently is being produced at Boeing's Douglas
Products division in Long Beach, Calif. at the rate of one per
month.
</P>
<P>
   About 3,750 Boeing employees work on the MD-11 program, 3,000 of
whom are located in California. Another 600 employees manufacture
MD-11 wings at the Toronto, Ontario facility; 75 in Salt Lake City
and 75 in Melbourne, Ark.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one was surprised,'' said Kedrick Legg, president of the
United Auto Workers union local that represents many of the 3,750
workers affected.
</P>
<P>
   ``The timing was a little disappointing,'' he said. ``The
company and the union together were hoping we could make it last a
little longer.''
</P>
<P>
   In November Boeing announced it would phase out production of
MD-80 and MD-90 models at Long Beach, with final delivery currently
scheduled for January 2000, a month before the MD-11 line shuts
down.
</P>
<P>
   The new 100-seat MD-95, which has been renamed the Boeing 717,
will be the only commercial aircraft developed by McDonnell Douglas
in production after 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing will unveil the 717 next week and expects to begin flight
tests in September.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 11,000 workers in Long Beach, about 3,000 each work on
the three MD models and the rest on the Boeing 717.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realize this is a painful decision for the many employees
who have worked long and hard on the MD-11,'' Woodard said. ``We
will be producing the airplane for another 18 months and we'll use
that time to explore opportunities for alternative work for these
employees. But ultimately we will have to lay off employees for
whom we do not have work.''
</P>
<P>
   Boeing announced plans earlier this year to transfer more than
1,000 employees who perform customer support and other functions at
Long Beach to the Seattle area. But the company has since decided
not to relocate most of them for now, Woodard said.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing said the move would not result in a special charge
against earnings, as many analysts had feared. But it will reduce
second-quarter earnings, though the company declined to specify by
how much.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing stock rose 25 cents to close at $45.625 in consolidated
New York Stock Exchange trading.
</P>
<P>
   Woodard said the announcement did not mean the Long Beach
factory would close.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing recently announced it will use the California plant to do
finishing work on some Boeing 737s, relieving pressure on the
overcrowded Boeing factory in Renton, which has struggled to meet
demand for its airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing also is considering setting up production lines at Long
Beach to make specialized versions of the 737, including the
executive Boeing Business Jets.
</P>
<P>
   The company said a final decision on whether to open assembly
lines for next-generation 737 models in California won't be made
until later this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Material from Reuters was included in this report.

RUN FOR YOUR LIVES, VIRTUAL PETS!
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOMMY CUMMINGS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Godzilla always seems to be fighting someone: King Kong, Mothra,
Bambi, and for the past two weeks, Ferris Bueller ...
</P>
<P>
   Get ready for Godzilla vs. Tamagotchi.
</P>
<P>
   Kristen Brennan of Berkeley, Calif., created a site
(www.jitterbug.com/gvt/gvt.shtml) that pits the high-maintenance
virtual pets against the big lizard in a Shockwave-powered online
battle.
</P>
<P>
   If you've seen the 1969 film short ``Bambi Meets Godzilla,'' in
which Bambi meets a grisly end, then you're prepared for Godzilla
vs. Tamagotchi.
</P>
<P>
   In Brennan's game, tiny cyberpets wander across a screen on a
Tamagotchi egg, mocking players with their cuteness. Players score
points by crushing the digital creatures into a pulp by clicking
buttons that activate Godzilla's foot. The more pets you smash, the
more points you score.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, it sounds brutal, but it must be OK, because it was
developed by a former Tamagotchi owner.
</P>
<P>
   Brennan, who is editor of an online humor e-zine called
Jitterbug Fantasia, came up with the game after one of her
Tamagotchi pets died.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the best way to revenge oneself on a Tamagotchi for
breaking your heart?'' Brennan said. ``Obviously, to recruit
Japan's other major export, Godzilla, to crush the little (toy)
into bits.''
</P>
<P>
   Brennan gained notoriety on the Internet after developing Loving
Henry, a Shockwave-powered digital comic book. Using Shockwave,
readers can turn the virtual pages of the online comic book, which
follows a woman's love for her husband, a bug-eyed alien.
</P>
<P>
   Reaction to Brennan's Godzilla-Tamagotchi game has been
positive, she said. Apparently, no one seems offended at seeing
cuddly cyberpets smashed like bugs.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, ``kids write that they love the `thumb-candy' aspect of
the game,'' Brennan said. ``Parents write that their kids'
Tamagotchi toys have been driving them crazy, and they're happy to
work out some aggression online.''
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, no one gets hurt _ except for a few cyberpets.

BELL ATLANTIC ANNOUNCES COMING FAST INTERNET HOOKUPS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic will bring high-speed Internet access to several
major East Coast cities by the end of the summer. But Boston and
New York will have to wait until next year.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic joins the roster of Baby Bell regional phone
companies that are rolling out Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line
service, or ADSL, a technology that enables standard copper phone
wires to carry vast amounts of digital data as well as regular
voice telephone calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bell Atlantic is determined to keep pace with people's
evolving needs by adding booster rockets to the on-line connections
we provide,'' said Bell Atlantic retail group president Bruce
Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts say the Internet cannot become a mass medium until
it is easily accessible by consumers from their homes. Even with
the fastest modems available today, cruising the Internet from home
can be a slow and frustrating experience, especially when sites
include video or complicated graphics.
</P>
<P>
   Communications companies are experimenting with several methods
to make connecting to the Web faster. In addition to ADSL, these
include cable modems, which operate through cable television
networks, and ISDN, or integrated services digital network, a phone
technology that provides high-speed data as well as voice services.
</P>
<P>
   The lowest-priced version of the new InfoSpeed service will
deliver up to 640,000 bits of data per second, a rate 12 times
faster than today's fastest modems. The user will also be able to
transmit data at 90,000 bits per second. This version of the
service will cost $69.95 a month.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; if,,.1l &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic will also offer two more expensive options, with
data reception speeds of 1.6 million or 7.1 million bits per
second. These InfoSpeed services will carry monthly charges of
$109.95 and $189.95, respectively, and are aimed at telecommuters
and self-employed people with home offices.
</P>
<P>
   The InfoSpeed system will work with PC and Macintosh computers,
but Bell Atlantic's own Internet service is currently available
only to PC users. However, the company will also offer InfoSpeed
through other Internet providers. Customers who obtain the service
through some other provider will receive a substantial discount
from the standard price.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic plans to charge less than $200 for installation of
the system. But company spokesman Larry Plumb wasn't sure whether
that will include installation of a high-speed data networking card
in the customer's computer.
</P>
<P>
   The price will include installation of an ADSL modem and a
special device called a ``splitter'' that will allow data and voice
traffic to flow over a regular home phone line. A consortium of
computer and telephone companies are completing work on a
``splitterless'' version of ADSL that should be much cheaper to
install, but Bell Atlantic officials said they wanted to enter the
market as quickly as possible.
</P>
<P>
   The deployment of the new service reflects the legacy of last
year's merger of Bell Atlantic and Nynex Corp., which formerly
served New York and Boston. InfoSpeed will be rolled out first on
Bell Atlantic's old turf, with deployment in Washington, D.C.,
Philadelphia, and Pittsburgh in September. The Hudson River area of
New Jersey will get the service in October. But New York City and
Boston are set to go on line some time next year.
</P>
<P>
   Plumb said personnel in the former Nynex areas aren't as
familiar with ADSL systems as those in Bell Atlantic's old
territory. Besides, Plumb said, Washington is the nation's
second-biggest user of Internet services, after California's
Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Doyle, vice president of International Data Corp. in
Framingham, is skeptical that there's a mass market for ADSL
services. His organization has predicted that only about 1 million
households will subscribe to such services by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Doyle noted most residential Internet users pay about $20 a
month. He said if they're asked to pay $70, ``a pretty decent
percentage of the people are going to drop off.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, ADSL suffers from a crucial limitation. It only
works for people who live within 18,000 feet of a telephone company
central office _ roughly three miles. Bell Atlantic officials have
estimated that about 60 percent of their local lines will be able
to use ADSL.

ONLINE SUBSCRIBERS ANGERED BY MARKETING MIX-UP 
</HEADLINE>
  (js)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the 35,000 subscribers to the online version of Advertising
Age checked their e-mail this week, they found an unsolicited _ and
some would say alarming _ piece of mail from TheGlobe.com, an
online ``community.'' The message invited recipients to sign on to
the service, and it included a preselected user name and password.
</P>
<P>
   The problem was that the passwords no doubt looked familiar;
they were the same ones subscribers had used to gain access to the
Advertising Age Web site. Nor did the message mention any
relationship between the two companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you accessed your new FREE e-mail account yet?'' asked
the e-mail come-on. It also pointed users to an Internet address
where they could find these new accounts.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Advertising Age issued an apology, also by e-mail,
explaining that what appeared to be a security breach was really a
marketing mix-up. The apology said that the trade publication was
beginning a new chat community, which it had commissioned
TheGlobe.com to build, and it wanted to make signing up to
participate as easy as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Ad Age people merged their data base with ours so people
wouldn't get a second password, to create a seamless introduction
to the community,'' said Esther Loewy, a spokeswoman for
TheGlobe.com. ``That's pretty standard in terms of business
alliances.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Loewy said that she had received a flurry of electronic
messages and calls on Tuesday from people who seemed ``unnerved''
by receiving a private password in an unsolicited e-mail. The
Advertising Age apology explained that the first note should have
come from them, not from TheGlobe.com.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Loewy and officials from Advertising Age said their
companies' respective mailing lists would never be sold. This was a
case of a business alliance, they said, not a violation of privacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't sell the passwords or the names, never have, never
will,'' said Edward Erhardt, vice president and publisher of Ad Age
Group. ``There was no intention on our part to give the password
out.'' Merging Ad Age's data base with TheGlobe.com's, he said, was
simply the easiest way to put the message out about the new chat
area.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the mistake raised eyebrows among those concerned
about Internet security. Mailing lists like the World Wide Web
Artists Consortium and other Internet-focused publications were
buzzing with discussions about the subject, said Regina Joseph, a
senior analyst at Jupiter Communications. ``It should alert people
to the privacy issues that are at stake,'' she added, commenting
that such alliances could lead to electronic mailboxes filled with
unwanted promotional material. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It means some people could, based upon whatever mistakes or
errors are made by a service provider, wind up overburdened with
unwanted e-mail. It could lead to people thinking twice before they
registered.''

<P>
   TIRANA, Albania _ Albania, reeling under an influx of thousands
of refugees from Kosovo, in Serbia, warned Wednesday that the
Serbian army may be preparing to enter Albania to hunt down rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Any such incursion would immediately draw Albania into the
conflict in Kosovo. There is widespread sympathy here for the
ethnic Albanian separatists in Kosovo who are challenging Serbian
rule in the province.
</P>
<P>
   As the fighting in Kosovo intensifies, it also threatens to draw
in Macedonia, where an ethnic Albanian minority also supports the
separatists. Diplomats fear a new Balkan war as destructive as the
one in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Serbs have been manufacturing so-called evidence to say
that Albanian territory is being used to launch terrorist
attacks,'' Prime Minister Fatos Nano said Wednesday in an interview
in his office.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had several reports of incursions into our territory
by Serb commando teams that appear to be scouting the area,'' he
said. ``When you look at what the Serbs are attempting to do, to
create a security belt along the border, you soon realize it is
impossible in such a mountainous area. The next step is to try and
enlarge the area under fire, an enlargement that would push the
conflict into Albania.''
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister, who sent an urgent appeal to NATO commanders
Wednesday asking for troops to secure the border area, conceded
that it was impossible to monitor the rugged terrain.
</P>
<P>
   He insisted, however, that any arms shipped into Kosovo from
Albania were being sent without his government's knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav president, Slobodan Milosevic, has deployed
thousands of special police and soldiers along the border, and they
have been pounding villages with heavy artillery, witnesses report.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 10,000 ethnic Albanians have fled since Sunday and
the flow is increasing. The refugees, many of whom walked for two
or three days to reach Albania, said that entire villages had been
reduced to rubble under the Serbian artillery fire, and that
hundreds of families are hiding in the woods.
</P>
<P>
   The sweep by Serbian troops under Milosevic's command is the
latest attempt to crush the Kosovo guerrillas fighting for
independence. Of the 2 million people in the province, about 90
percent are ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington the State Department raised the possibility of
tighter international sanctions against Yugoslavia for provoking
the flood of refugees. ``One does feel like the movie called
`Ethnic Cleansing' is replaying intself,'' said the department's
spokesman, James P. Rubin.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia, which now has just two republics, Serbia and
Montenegro, tried a more limited operation to end the rebel
movement in March. That campaign left villages in central Kosovo in
rubble and 80 dead, most of them women, children and the elderly,
witnesses reported.
</P>
<P>
   The attack in March only served to ignite the population and
swell the ranks of the rebel force. Weapons and volunteers, many
from the 600,000 ethnic Albanians living in Switzerland and
Germany, began to pour into the region, crossing into Kosovo from
Albania, according to Western diplomats.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Nano said there were also indications that
Islamic groups are interested in aiding the ethnic Albanian
Kosovars, most of whom are Muslim, in the battle against the Serbs,
who are Orthodox Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   The Albanian government is still trying to clean up after the
collapse of fraudulent investment schemes last year and the
widespread looting and rioting that followed when thousands lost
vast sums of money. The chaos left lawless areas beyond the reach
of the police and the military, especially along the border with
Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Nano said 70 former military warehouses scattered around Albania
still held stockpiles of weapons inherited from the preceding
Communist government, and he warned that continued unrest could set
off a new round of pillaging.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are over 2,000 tons of weapons and explosives sitting
out there,'' he said.
</P>

   During the confusion that swept Albania last year, an estimated
650,000 weapons were taken by mobs from military and police
warehouses and barracks. Many of the weapons ended up in Kosovo,
Western diplomats say.
</P>
<P>
   The government in Tirana, which has supported the international
community in calling for a negotiated settlement in Kosovo, has
begun issuing much more ambiguous statements. The prime minister
referred to the resistance in Kosovo, for example, as ``self
defense.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These are Albanians who want to protect their kids, their
lives and their homes,'' he said. ``They have these armed groups to
fight the Serbs because they have been attacked.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``We desperately need intervention, the establishment
of mechanisms such as `no fly' zones to halt these attacks. The
situation is deteriorating. We do not want another Bosnia.''

UNIONS DEFEAT EFFORT TO RESTRICT POLITICAL ACTIVITIES 
</HEADLINE>

(th) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In an impressive assertion of organized labor's
political might, California voters on Tuesday dealt conservatives a
considerable setback by rejecting a measure championed by
Republicans that would have pinched the flow of money to Democratic
candidates and causes.
</P>
<P>
   The ballot initiative had posed one of the greatest political
threats to labor in years: It would have choked off a vital source
of money for Democrats, who largely champion labor's issues, by
requiring unions to get annual written permission from each member
before using dues for political purposes.
</P>
<P>
   The defeat, 53 percent to 47 percent, represented a stunning
comeback for labor. Early polls had indicated that the referendum
would prevail by more than a 2 to 1 margin. As recently as late
last week, a senior White House official who has closely monitored
the campaign here predicted, unhappily, that the initiative would
win.
</P>
<P>
   Most proponents blamed the result on lopsided spending on the
issue. Labor poured an estimated $20 million into the drive
compared to a few million spent by supporters of the referendum.
The outcome set off a round of recriminations and soul-searching
Wednesday among Republicans who had thought passage was well within
their grasp.
</P>
<P>
   Grover Norquist, the director of Americans for Tax Reform in
Washington, who campaigned aggressively for the referendum,
predicted that the outcome here will mean that only about five
states will approve proposals to restrict unions dues within the
next year instead of the anticipated 10 that might have been swept
up in the excitement of a victory here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been helpful if we had won _ there would have
been more momentum,'' Norquist said in an interview. ``But when
you're competing with a bottomless pit _ the ability to raise union
dues, it's a little tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Grossman, national chairman of the Democratic Party
responded: ``Grover Norquist and his merry band of extremists
clearly had in mind jump-starting a national campaign _ and
California was the centerpiece of their strategy. That strategy
lies in ruins.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   From here to Washington on Wednesday, labor leaders hailed their
triumph, saying that beyond the money there was an extraordinary
effort by hundreds of thousands of volunteers who made phone calls
and walked precincts in recent days to draw people to the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Another unexpected beneficiary, they said, was Gray Davis, who
won the Democratic gubernatorial nomination. Davis has long been an
ally of unions, and the turnout by labor for the ballot measure
also delivered more votes to his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The labor leaders predicted that the California victory will
embolden their efforts to reject similar initiatives in other
states _ and will spur greater grassroots participation by unions
in the November midterm elections. In the next year or two, nearly
a dozen other states are considering similar union measures, either
through their legislatures or the initiative process.
</P>
<P>
   ``A modern political miracle,'' declared John Sweeney, president
of the AFL-CIO, at a news conference in Washington. ``We gained new
strength and momentum for a pro-working family agenda heading into
the fall elections. More than 24,000 new union member political
activists emerged in California in the course of the campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   The reverberations were felt far beyond California and marked a
disquieting reversal for leading conservatives, including House
Speaker Newt Gingrich, who had vigorously pressed for the measure
and hoped its passage would embolden similar so-called ``paycheck
protection'' drives around the country.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome was also a serious personal rebuke to Gov. Pete
Wilson of California, who had championed the referendum and had
hoped its passage would give him a vehicle on which to base a
campaign for president in 2000 _ and leave conservatives who favor
the measure in his debt.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, expecting victory, had prevailed upon Gingrich to
postpone votes on campaign finance legislation that would have
called for restrictions similar to those in the California measure.
Wilson had thought approval of the referendum, known here as
Proposition 226, would help Republicans gain momentum for a similar
effort in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters after an appearance at a Republican
``unity breakfast'' in Newport Beach on Wednesday morning, Wilson
castigated unions for their role in defeating the proposal,
asserting, ``The more they rip off peoples' pay checks, the more
money they have in their warchests. And they will be just as
arrogant and high-handed as they can get away with.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor brushed aside a question about how the outcome will
affect his White House aspirations, saying, ``You pick your fights
because you think it's the right thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Surveys showed that while Democrats overwhelmingly rejected the
initiative, so did a sizable segment of voters who identify
themselves as Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the second-guessing and finger-pointing Wednesday was
among Republicans who blamed one another for mounting a feeble
campaign: Supporters in California attacked the Republican National
Committee for not channeling significant resources into the drive.
</P>
<P>
   Republican officials in Washington criticized the backers in
California for bickering over how best to pitch the initiative. And
supporters everywhere criticized major California business
organizations for their refusal to take on labor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people thought it was a sure win,'' said Mark Bucher, a
business executive from Tustin, an Orange County community south of
Los Angeles, who was prompted to write the initiative with two
friends after a teacher he knew groused that her union was backing
school board candidates that she opposed. ``So they turned away
their attention and gave their money elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   The unions pumped millions of dollars into television
commercials that said the referendum was the brainchild of a
``foreign lobbyist'' _ a reference to Norquist _ and that it
threatened everything from Medicare to education. They asserted
that it would hinder charities that use payroll deductions to raise
money.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents launched their television campaign only a few weeks
ago. They sought to counter the opponents ``scare stories'' and
referred disparagingly to ``union bosses'' amassing great sums of
money.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Mellman, a Democratic pollster who worked with labor to
oppose the measure, said his side was all the more aggressive
because it was spurred on by the early poll findings showing that
it would pass. As for the opponents, he said, ``They were misled by
their own hubris.''
</P>
<P>
   Norquist, whose group contributed about $500,000 to the
referendum campaign, did not dispute that point, saying some
possible donors were reluctant to contribute because they did not
think the referendum was in trouble. ``That hurt us on fund
raising,'' he said. ``That one of the reasons business didn't
contribute.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the critics who blame the Republican National Committee
for barely putting any money into opposing the referendum, Clifford
May, the party's communications director, explained that candidates
are a higher priority.
</P>
<P>
   ``As much as we supported this, our job is to elect Republicans
in November,'' he said. ``Our job is not to match the unions and
have less left over for November.'' &QL;

SOME DRUG STORES SHUN MANAGED-CARE CUSTOMERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (ja)  
 By TERRY PRISTIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Martin Keane has spent two decades refining his skill
at mixing custom-made prescriptions, helping customers sort through
the maze of medications and making sure they get Feldene for their
arthritis and Seldane for their hay fever, not the other way
around.
</P>
<P>
   But that expertise and dedication have barely kept his
struggling pharmacy on the Upper East Side afloat, buffeted as it
is by the proliferation of chain drugstores and the relentless
cost-cutting permeating every aspect of health care. Keane and his
partner have tried everything they can think of. Pushing the $70
scented candles and $500 French magnifying mirrors they stock in
the front of the store. Renting breast-milk pumps to working
mothers. They've even considered mixing veterinary medicines for
their customers' pets.
</P>
<P>
   But their latest strategy is the most drastic step yet. Like a
handful of other independent pharmacists in New York City, Keane is
rebelling against the whole managed-care system. His store, the
venerable Newton-Timmermann Pharmacy at Lexington Avenue and 62nd
Street, has stopped accepting insurance cards for managed-care drug
plans, saying that the reimbursements are so small that pharmacists
are losing money or skimping on service to their customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Managed care was costing us all of our profit,'' Keane said.
</P>
<P>
   Facing similar strains, many independent pharmacies have
specialized, focusing on a particular niche overlooked by the Rite
Aids and Duane Reades.
</P>
<P>
   Some pharmacists provide services for AIDS patients or develop a
special expertise in chronic problems like diabetes or respiratory
ailments. Some feature homeopathic medicines. Others try to adapt
to their neighborhoods _ for example, serving immigrant customers
in their own language and understanding their medical traditions.
</P>
<P>
   A pharmacy in Ridgewood, N.J., has even begun asking
managed-care customers to pay a voluntary $3 surcharge on each
prescription so the store, Town and Country Pharmacy, does not have
to reduce its level of service. About half the customers asked have
agreed, said John Herr, a pharmacist.
</P>
<P>
   Keane and his partner, Steven H. Hurowitz, are also looking for
niches to fill and new services and products to offer. But by
banishing managed-care plans _ and losing about 250 of their 5,000
regular customers in the process _ they are staking their survival
primarily on an old-fashioned style of service befitting a store
that traces its roots to 1869.
</P>
<P>
   They made the switch in March after concluding that they were
actually losing money on prescriptions and barely breaking even on
the business over all. Reimbursements from the insurers have been
dropping in recent years even as the percentage of customers using
them has grown, squeezing profits and forcing Newton-Timmermann to
lay off two of 11 workers and not replace a third employee.
</P>
<P>
   In an average day, Keane said, three pharmacists at
Newton-Timmermann fill a total of about 75 prescriptions, well
below the average workload for a single pharmacist at many stores.
Keane, an affable man of 41 with a knack for putting people at
ease, often emerges from behind the counter at the rear of the
narrow store and spends as long as 15 minutes with a customer who
needs instructions for taking a new medication. People come in to
get post-surgical advice for a fresh face lift or simply to banter
about Viagra; some customers seem to view him almost as a stand-in
for their doctor.
</P>
<P>
   As Keane sees it, the managed-care companies have threatened the
traditions he values and put so much pressure on druggists that the
danger of slip-ups has increased. Pharmacists are forced to act
more like salesmen than medical professionals, he said, because
they are rewarded or penalized based on whether they can persuade
doctors to substitute a cheaper drug for the one that was initially
prescribed.
</P>
<P>
   Subscribers in the plans typically pay about $10 per
prescription. The insurer then reimburses the pharmacist according
to a formula based on the wholesale cost of the drug, plus $2.50
per prescription intended to cover his costs and profit margin. But
with his high rent and other costs, and his relatively low volume,
Keane said he ended up losing $12 or more on many prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
   And in a further blow to the pharmacists, the managed-care
companies are increasingly encouraging subscribers with chronic
conditions to order their medications by mail.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the managed-care companies _ and many
non-managed-care customers reeling at the high cost of prescription
drugs _ see things differently. The companies say they are trying
to bring down the high cost of health care for their clients, who
include employers, trade unions and other insurers. ``We compete in
a marketplace for customers,'' said Kevin Colgan, a spokesman for
Merck Medco Managed Care, the parent company of Paid Prescriptions.
``They select us based on our ability to provide high-quality,
affordable prescription drug plans. Everybody in health care is
under pressure to compete _ to improve quality and reduce costs.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in affluent parts of New York City, where residents are
often passionate about their neighborhood stores, independent
pharmacies are rapidly disappearing. Recent casualties include
Downing Chemists and Calvin Berger on the Upper East Side and the
Last Pharmacy on the Upper West Side. According to the Hayes
Directory, which compiles statistics from state pharmacy boards,
New York state lost 612 independent pharmacies and gained 513 chain
drugstores from 1992 to 1997, mirroring the national trend.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, when Keane sold a pharmacy he had owned in the South
Bronx neighborhood where he grew up and bought a half-interest in
Newton-Timmermann, only about 7 percent of the prescriptions were
reimbursed through managed care. In six years, that proportion has
grown to 33 percent, he said. Nationwide, the proportion of
prescriptions paid by managed-care companies has risen to 60
percent, from 28 percent in 1991, according to IMS America, a
health-care information company.
</P>
<P>
   Since Newton-Timmermann clamped down on managed-care coverage _
joining several other independent stores in the city that never
took the cards _ some customers have defected to the Pasteur
Pharmacy a block away, where the cards are accepted. ``Their not
taking the plans really helped us,'' said Amy Schimmel, a co-owner
of Pasteur.
</P>
<P>
   Keane is hopeful that his loyal longtime customers, many of whom
have charge accounts, will see him through.
</P>
<P>
   And many customers say they are willing to pay extra for the
service and expertise at Newton-Timmermann. ``They're very
expensive, but I trust them,'' said Diane Papert, a retired
copywriter.
</P>
<P>
   Keane, who lives in Suffolk County with his wife (also a
pharmacist, at a Genovese chain store) and three children, did not
anticipate catering to the carriage trade when he settled on a
career. At 15, he worked part time as a stock boy in a drugstore
near his home in the Highbridge section of the Bronx to help pay
his tuition for parochial school. Pharmacy seemed an ideal field
for him, combining his interest in biology and chemistry, his knack
for business and his desire to work in a helping profession, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, after a five-year pharmacy program at St. John's
University, he was contemplating going on for his doctorate when he
was offered the chance to buy a half-interest in the tiny Weldon
Pharmacy, where he had worked as a teen-ager, for a mere $1,000.
The opportunity was too good to pass up.
</P>
<P>
   In those days, Keane said, it was easy for a pharmacist to do
well because the price of drugs was rising at a steady clip. ``That
protected a lot of pharmacies,'' he said, ``because without really
doing anything, the value of your inventory was going up 12 or 13
percent a year consistently through the '80s. So you were making
real money just standing there. That's why a lot of places that
were less than efficient were able to survive.''
</P>
<P>
   The South Bronx business grew rapidly, eventually handling 275
prescriptions a day, most of them Medicaid reimbursements. Even
with the help of a second pharmacist, Keane said, it was impossible
to give his customers more than minimal individual attention.
``That was one of the things I had originally gone into pharmacy
for,'' he said. ``I missed that.'' He decided to sell and set up
his business elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   In his six years at Newton-Timmermann, Keane has found himself
handing out his business card to hotel concierges to let them know
he can rent wheelchairs to their guests. He has expanded the enema-
and suppository-preparation service for which the pharmacy has long
been known. He has started putting out a newsletter to inform his
customers about new research on vitamins and nutrition supplements.
And he has sought to expand the pharmacy's reach by signing up
several corporate medical offices and a child-care agency.
</P>
<P>
   Keane said he hoped his protest against managed care would give
him the breathing room he needed to keep building the business. ``I
think that in five years there will be very, very few pharmacies
left,'' Keane said. ``I'm hoping that I'll be one of them.''

   FROM SOUTH KOREA, BOEING TO GET $1.35 BILLION ORDER
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Asian economic crisis and declines in airline
passenger traffic in the region, Korean Air plans to announce an
order next week for 27 new Boeing 737 passenger jets valued at
$1.35 billion. The order is good news for Boeing, which only last
week said that weakening demand from Asia would force it to cut
production of the 747 jumbo jet next year. Boeing will stop
producing the MD-11 wide-body jet and lay off some workers because
of reduced demand for that plane.
</P>
<P>
   STOCKS FALL ON TECHNOLOGY SLUMP
</P>
<P>
   Declines among technology shares, led by a 4.8 percent drop in
the price of Intel on fears of lower earnings, helped push the
stock markets lower. The Nasdaq composite index fell 1.1 percent,
to 1,742.31. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 87.44 points and
the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index fell 10.49 points.

   TEST OF AIDS VACCINE IS APPROVED
</P>
<P>
   The FDA gave VaxGen Inc. of South San Francisco approval to
conduct the world's first full-scale test of a vaccine to prevent
infection with the AIDS virus.
</P>
<P>
   Approval was also given to a combination of two antiviral drugs
to treat liver-destroying hepatitis C. The treatment, known as
Rebetron, is made by Schering-Plough.

<P>
   A TALENT MANAGER FOR LAS VEGAS
</P>
<P>
   Some lavishly produced shows in Las Vegas, like those including
Siegfried and Roy's $50-million-a-year live-animal act, are
obviously successful. But Steven Wynn, chairman of Mirage Resorts,
wants to alter the type of entertainment seen in the gambling
resort city. He has hired a top talent manager, Sandy Gallin, to
start new theaters, arenas and cabarets, hoping to create shows
that will end up on Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   QUICKENING PACE ON MADISON AVE.
</P>

   SOME SIGHS OF RELIEF IN MOSCOW
</P>
<P>
   Russia's economy survived a critical test as the Government sold
nearly $1 billion in treasury bills without paying the colossal
interest rates it settled for just a week ago. Anxious foreign
investors breathed a sigh of relief.
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics wonder if the IMF is applying flawed priorities and
policies in Russia.

<P>
   CLINTON VOW ON CHINA TRADING RIGHTS
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton announced that he would renew China's trading
privileges, signaling that he would not back away from his policy
of engagement despite the rising Congressional clamor over whether
the Chinese Government illegally contributed to his campaign and
used protected American technology to improve its missiles.

   CIENA AND POWER OF THE MARKETPLACE
</P>

   Solid relationships with big customers represent one factor
driving Ciena's acquisition by Tellabs Inc. The company has very

   MORE AT&AMP;T MANAGERS RETIRING
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T said it would take a larger charge than expected in the
second quarter because more managers than predicted are taking
early retirement. But expecting the charge to be more than offset
by gains from the sale of businesses, the company chairman, C.
Michael Armstrong, called the results good news.

   ``Four Views on the Book of Revelation''
</P>
<P>
   Edited by C. Marvin Pate
</P>
<P>
   Zondervan, $16.99
</P>
<P>
   Confused by the last book of the Bible? Well, the line begins
over there, and it's a lengthy line indeed. But a recent
installment in Zondervan's ``Counterpoints'' series may provide
direction of some sort.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Four Views on the Book of Revelation,'' four scholars _
Kenneth L. Gentry Jr., Sam Hamstra Jr., C. Marvin Pate and Robert
L. Thomas _ outline their respective interpretive schemes. The
choices are preterist (the prophecies were basically fulfilled
centuries ago), idealist (the book is a symbolic lesson, with no
particular connections to history), classical dispensationalist
(almost all of the book deals with the future ``last days'') and
progressive dispensationalist (a modified version of the last).
</P>
<P>
   The book may be most helpful to those who are already with the
Bible but are at a loss about where to begin with Revelation.
There's still plenty to disagree about (Hamstra sees the first
horseman of the Apocalypse as Christ, whereas Pate sees him as
Antichrist), but ``Four Views on the Book of Revelation'' at least
helps set the stage for the discussion.

   ``(Pages of Life) Chapters I &AMP; II''
</P>
<P>
   Fred Hammond &AMP; Radical for Christ
</P>
<P>
   Zomba Recording Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Size, the ads for ``Godzilla'' keep telling us, matters.
</P>
<P>
   But more is not always better.
</P>
<P>
   And to understand this fully, the best place to go is ``(Pages
of Life) Chapters I &AMP; II,'' the new two-CD set by Detroit-based
modern-gospel favorite Fred Hammond &AMP; Radical for Christ.
</P>
<P>
   Hammond, who has toured frequently with Kirk Franklin and
Yolanda Adams, has become one of the leading lights of the
crossover/urban gospel movement, fusing stories straight out of the
Bible with deep beats and '70s-redolent funk.
</P>
<P>
   And Hammond and Radical for Christ (10 vocalists, six musicians)
are very good at what they do, no question about it. But here, they
just try to do too much of it _ or, perhaps more accurately, do it
for too long.
</P>
<P>
   This new set's two ``chapters'' are basically one CD (16 songs)
of studio recordings, and one CD (13 songs) of live recordings.
What hamstrings the project, however, and ultimately makes it less
effective than it might have been, is its sheer bulk. The first CD
is clearly the keeper, full of excellent songs, such as the deep
funk of ``I Wanna Know Your Ways, I Will Bless His Holy Name'' (on
which PamKenyon Donald and Frederick Purifoy II contribute some
strong lead vocals) and the truly lovely ``You Were Much Closer.''
The second CD is, well, a lot of the songs from the first CD, done
in louder and longer (but not necessarily better) versions, all
recorded Nov. 29, 1997, at the Straight Gate Church in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Here, again, there are positives: Hammond and the vocalists are
in good form, and there are moments that are exactly what a gospel
music show should be. But did we really need an additional eight
minutes of ``I Wanna Know Your Ways?'' An additional 12 minutes of
``Jesus Is All?''
</P>
<P>
   Well, frankly, no, we didn't, and Hammond should have let the
original versions on the first CD stand alone.

   NEW YORK _ Before throwing his first pitch for the New York
Yankees on Wednesday night, Orlando Hernandez stood behind the
mound and stared around the outfield at Yankee Stadium. These were
moments to remember for Hernandez, the realization of a lifelong
goal and the culmination of a harrowing journey that began six
months ago with a risky escape from Cuba and ended Wednesday night
on baseball's grandest stage.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez, forbidden to play baseball in Cuba by officials who
feared that he would defect, survived that trip in a make-shift
sailboat last December and signed with the Yankees this spring. He
performed so well in the minor leagues that he was promoted to
pitch at Yankee Stadium on Wednesday night, against the Tampa Bay
Devil Rays. The crowd roared when he was introduced, cheered him
when he walked to the mound, and burst with more cheers when he
struck out the game's first hitter, Quinton McCracken.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees called up Hernandez on Tuesday as a contingency, in
case David Wells, bothered by shoulder soreness, couldn't pitch.
Wells was able to start, but it just so happened that David Cone,
another Yankee pitcher, had been bitten on the pitching hand by his
mother's dog. The Yankees decided to rest Cone and activate
Hernandez for one game; they intend to return him to the minors on
Thursday, and then call him again up later this season.
</P>
<P>
   But for Hernandez, one day was enough. He ate spaghetti on
Wednesday afternoon, his favorite pregame meal, and arrived at
Yankee Stadium around 3:30, cheered enthusiastically by fans
waiting outside, some waving Cuban flags. Hernandez strolled into
the Yankees clubhouse, wearing blue jeans and a denim jacket,
appearing not the least bit nervous or anxious. In a sense, he'd
been preparing for this day for years.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez, known as El Duque, was a star on Cuba's national
team. As a child, Hernandez has said, he rooted for the Yankees and
hoped he could play in Yankee Stadium. His younger half-brother,
Livan, defected from Cuba in 1995 and signed with the Florida
Marlins. Livan was a World Series hero for the Marlins last
October.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez is the latest of a handful of defectors from Cuba who
are slowly making an impact in the major leagues. Rey Ordonez, the
shortstop of the New YOrk Mets, won a Gold Glove Award last season
for his defensive brilliance, and Rolando Arrojo of Tampa Bay has
been one of the American League's best pitchers this season.
</P>
<P>
   After his brother's defection, Cuban authorities suspected that
Orlando would also try to defect. So even though he was a star
pitcher, they banned him from life from Cuba's national team in
October, 1996. Other players who had defected, such as Livan
Hernandez and Rey Ordonez, had walked away while the team was
playing in other countries. Orlando Hernandez would not get that
chance.
</P>
<P>
   After he was banned, Hernandez, who is 32 by some accounts and
28 by his own, worked briefly in a psychiatric hospital, making
less than $10 a month, according to his account. He said that
before Christmas of 1997, state officials visited him and warned
him against taking any embarrassing action, because the pope was
due to visit Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   With that, Hernandez determined to leave Cuba. On the morning of
Dec. 26, he and seven others, including his wife Norris Bosch,
obtained a 20-foot sailboat made of scraps, carrying only several
cans of Spam, some fresh water and sugar.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez and his group landed on a small island, Anguilla Cay,
that is part of the Bahamas. After living under a sail and
surviving on seaweed and conch for three days, they were spotted by
a U.S. Coast Guard helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez was offered a visa by the United States, but he
established residence in Costa Rica, instead. Had he taken the
offer of residence from the United States, he would have been
subject to the amateur draft. Living in Costa Rica, he was a free
agent and could field offers from all teams. The Yankees signed
Hernandez on March 7 to a four-year, $6.6 million contract, more
than twice what executives with other bidders said they had
offered.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Hernandez worked out with the Yankees for the first time March
21, but the Yankees weren't sure what kind of physical condition he
would be in. After all, he had been out of organized baseball for
more than a year and had struggled to make a living in his final
months in Cuba. But he shocked them: A team doctor said Hernandez
was in the best condition of any athlete he had ever examined.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Torre, the Yankees manager, saw Hernandez's broad shoulders,
the flexibility in his movements and his pitching mechanics, and
decided then Hernandez had a chance to pitch in the big leagues. He
just looks like an athlete, Torre said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Broad-shouldered at 6-2 and 190 pounds, Hernandez is a
right-hander who throws many different pitches from different
angles, much like Luis Tiant, another Cuban-born pitcher, did. He
draws his left leg upward, standing for an instant on one leg like
a flamingo, left knee almost touching his left cheekbone.
</P>
<P>
   Teammates were taken immediately with his enthusiasm, his
outward joy. At the end of a fielding drill on his first day,
Hernandez bounced around the infield to pick up baseballs, like a
newly hired batboy, his glove overflowing. He was incredulous at
the food and equipment made available to the players _ and at a
Jerry Springer videotape the players watched. Hernandez walked
away, grinning, spinning a pointed finger at his head: Loco.
Welcome to America.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the awkward assimilation of the Japanese-speaking pitcher
Hideki Irabu last season, Hernandez seemed to fit in the with the
Yankees right away, due, in great measure, to his own effort. When
he first went to David Szen, the team's traveling secretary, to
receive his allotment of meal money, Hernandez attempted to speak
only in English. Hernandez shivered in the relative cold of Florida
in March, but refused to buy any warmer clothes; he needed to
adjust, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He always seemed so happy, other players noted. But during
batting practice one day, Jorge Posada, the Yankees' catcher, stood
alongside Hernandez in the outfield and asked him about his trip in
the leaky sailboat. Posada remembered on Wednesday that in
responding, Hernandez spoke quietly, his eyes turned downward.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hear about the people who make it on the boats,'' said
Posada, who grew up in Puerto Rico. ``But there are so many who
don't. You wonder, how bad is it over there that they just want to
get away. It's sad.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He left all his friends behind,'' Posada said. ``He had to
some of his family behind. That's pretty tough.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Hernandez's agent, Joe Cubas, authorities in Cuba
incarcerated one of the pitcher's brothers for a few days.
Hernandez's phone calls to his two daughters, 7-year-old Yahumara
and 2-year-old Steffi, are monitored. ``Duque's life is incomplete
until he has his kids next to him,'' said Cubas.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez continued his preparation at the Yankees' training
complex in April, before pitching in a Class A game April 16; just
11 days later, he struck out 10 in five scoreless innings for
Triple-A Columbus. He continued to pitch well, compiling a 6-0
record and a 3.83 era for the Clippers.

<P>
   HOUSTON _ Israeli and Syrian officials on Wednesday ended three
days of closed meetings designed to explore ways to restart peace
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The officials were joined at Rice University's Baker Institute
for Public Policy by officials from the United States and public
policy experts from around the world, institute director Edward
Djerejian confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   Among the participants were Uzi Arad, diplomatic adviser to
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and Walid Al-Moualem,
Syria's ambassador to Washington. Also present was Martin Indyk,
U.S. assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern affairs.
</P>
<P>
   James A. Baker III, the honorary chairman of the institute and
former U.S. secretary of state, didn't participate in the forum but
interacted with the group at a working dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Peace talks between Israel and Syria have been frozen since
February 1996. Netanyahu has rejected Syrian demands they be
resumed on the basis of an Israeli agreement in principle to return
the occupied Golan Heights in exchange for a peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Djerejian, who formerly held U.S. ambassadorships to Israel and
Syria, said the meetings didn't constitute negotiations. He said
the institute invited officials and experts to Houston to attend a
public policy forum designed to analyze conditions and search for
ways to restart the negotiations between Israel and Syria, as well
as to move the peace process along.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a unique gathering of people,'' Djerejian said. ``The
forum was productive.''
</P>
<P>
   The meetings were closed to the public to ``maintain
confidentiality,'' Djerejian said. ``They were closed so people
could speak their minds.''
</P>
<P>
   The institute, designed as a place to help resolve public policy
issues, will publish a report on the policy recommendations and
findings of the forum.
</P>
<P>
   Also among the people taking part were Israel's former military
intelligence chief Uri Sagie, and former Israeli ambassador to
Washington Itamar Rabinovich.

CLINTON RENEWS CHINA'S TRADE STATUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton Wednesday said he will renew
normal trade status for China, saying that an open relationship
with China is particularly important now that India and Pakistan
appear headed toward a nuclear arms race.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's decision launches the annual debate over U.S.
relations with China, a debate that is likely to be particularly
rancorous this year.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the perennial concerns about China's poor record
on human rights and arms proliferation, many in Congress are
concerned about allegations that China tried to influence the 1996
presidential election in this country and then gained access to
secret information about satellite technology from a top Democratic
contributor.
</P>
<P>
   Trade relations with China are particularly important to
Washington state, where many businesses, most notably Boeing, are
heavily dependent on trade with China. An estimated $8.7 billion
worth of goods heading to or coming from China passed through the
ports of Washington state in 1996, making mainland China the
state's third largest trading partner, according to the state
department of Community, Trade and Economic Development.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has 90 days in which it could overturn Clinton's
action, but any chance of that seemed seriously diminished
Wednesday when House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a vocal Clinton critic,
signed a letter to Clinton supporting the president's position on
normal trade relations with China.
</P>
<P>
   Although the trade status is called most favored nation, it
allows China the same tariff treatment as most other nations
trading with the United States. Only six countries _ Afghanistan,
Cuba, Laos, North Korea, Serbia-Montenegro and Vietnam _ are not
accorded the status.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not to renew would be to sever our economic and, to a large
measure, our strategic relationship with China, turning our back on
a fourth of the world at a time when our cooperation for world
peace and security is especially important, in light of the recent
events in South Asia,'' Clinton said in remarks at the White House
Rose Garden Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews Wednesday, eight of the 11 members of the
Washington state congressional delegation said they support
renewing China's trade status. Only Rep. Linda Smith, R-Wash.,
opposed the president's position, while Rep. George Nethercutt,
R-Wash., said he is undecided, and Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash.,
declined to be interviewed on the topic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be fairly economically devastating to the Pacific
Northwest if we were no longer allowed to do business with China,''
said Rep. Adam Smith, D-Wash. ``And it's not only Boeing _ a number
of small companies in my area are interested in selling products
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington state last year exported $1.9 billion worth of goods
to China, the vast majority of which came in the form of Boeing
airplanes. Boeing expects China to spend $125 billion over the next
20 years on new airplanes, making the country its largest potential
overseas market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trade with China has helped our nation's economy stay strong
and has meant steady jobs for thousands of Boeing families,'' the
Seattle-based aerospace company, which employs 237,500 people, said
in a statement. ``It has long been our position that trade between
the United States and China is a positive force in the overall
relationship between our two countries.''
</P>
<P>
   Most favored nation status was first extended to China on Feb.
1, 1980, and has been renewed annually by every president since
then.
</P>
<P>
   The trade relationship has been particularly controversial since
1989, when the Chinese leadership massacred pro-democracy
protesters in Tiananmen Square. In 1992 President Bush twice vetoed
measures passed by Congress to revoke China's trade status.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton ran for president in 1992 accusing Bush of coddling
China's leaders, but in 1994 he dramatically changed his position,
declaring that his administration would no longer link trade and
human rights decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our exports have tripled over the last decade and now support
over 170,000 American jobs,'' Clinton said Wednesday. ``But just as
important, trade is a force for change in China, exposing China to
our ideas and our ideals and integrating China into the global
economy.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the trade argument, Clinton, joined by Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright, argued that good relations with China
will help U.S. security in light of the looming threat of nuclear
confrontation between India and Pakistan. China is chairing a
meeting Thursday in Geneva of foreign ministers from the five
permanent United Nations security council members on the situation
in South Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an important example of how our engagement with China
serves America's interests: stability in Asia, preventing the
spread of weapons of mass destruction, combating international
crime and drug-trafficking, protecting the environment,'' Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the same time, we continue to deal forthrightly with China
on those issues where we disagree _ notably, on human rights; and
there have clearly been some concrete results as a result of this
engagement as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Those arguments were echoed by Gingrich, who co-signed a letter
with House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer, R-Texas,
and Rep. Philip Crane, R-Ill., the chairman of the Ways and Means
Subcommittee on Trade.
</P>
<P>
   They outlined their concerns about alleged illegal Chinese
contributions to U.S. political campaigns and lax enforcement of
U.S. laws against transfers of missile technology. But they said
those issues should be separated from the debate over most favored
nation status for China, which they support.
</P>
<P>
   ``We welcome the determination you made today to recommend the
renewal of MFN trade status for China, and we pledge to work with
you in a bipartisan manner to preserve our longstanding policy of
commercial and diplomatic engagement with the Chinese,'' they
wrote. ``Seeking to keep China open to the West has proven to be
the most effective way to advance our democratic values in this
turbulent region of the world _ a policy we are committed to
maintaining.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Minority Leader Thomas Daschle, D-S.D., also supported
renewing China's trade status.
</P>
<P>
   But opposition to Clinton's policy quickly emerged from the left
and the right.
</P>
<P>
   ``I oppose the president's actions,'' said the House Minority
Leader, Richard Gephardt, D-Mo. ``We must not reward the Chinese
Communist government for continuing political repression and
tyranny.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the AFL-CIO said the labor union will oppose
renewal of the trade status.
</P>
<P>
   ``The egregious human rights violations and violations of
democratic principles have not been addressed,'' said Thea Lee,
assistant director of public policy for the AFL-CIO. ``We also
don't see that China has lived up to its obligations to provide
reciprocal access to its market, and the imbalance of our
relationship is of concern to us as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Bauer, the president of the Family Research Council and an
influential voice for the religious right, also opposed renewal of
normal trade relations with China, calling it ``part of an overall
abandonment of the president's previous commitment to get serious
about China's flagrant disregard for human rights.''
</P>
<P>
   ``China systematically violates agreements on human rights and
weapons transfers, aggressively builds up its military in an
attempt to dislodge the United States from the Pacific, seeks to
tamper with the U.S. electoral system, yet the president does
virtually nothing in response,'' Bauer said.

INTERACTION BETWEEN JOCKEY AND RACEHORSE: AN INSIDE VIEW

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ From the time the horses burst out of the starting
gate in Saturday's 130th Belmont Stakes until the finish two and a
half minutes later, an extraordinary collaboration will take place
between every horse and jockey.
</P>
<P>
   Through subtle cues with their hands and legs, each jockey will
attempt to communicate with a dance partner who outweighs him by
900 pounds and does not have a steering wheel. In the case of the
colt Real Quiet and the jockey Kent Desormeaux, their artistry
could earn them the sport's 12th Triple Crown and a $5 million
bonus.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Stevens, the jockey who last year narrowly failed in his
attempt to capture the Belmont Stakes and with it the Triple Crown
aboard Silver Charm, is back this year, but his role is reversed.
He will ride Victory Gallop, who finished second to Real Quiet in
the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes and is considered the colt
with the best chance of an upset Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Belmont Stakes is the last and longest leg of the Triple
Crown. It is a demanding mile and a half around sprawling Belmont
Park. Stevens, 35, will call on years of experience to prepare for
the race and carry him through the long run of strategy and danger.
</P>
<P>
   Already over the last five weeks, Stevens, a riding prodigy and
Hall of Fame jockey who grew up the son of a horse trainer in
Idaho, has dealt with the tactics and tensions of the Triple
Crown's first two legs. He has monitored his weight, gauged the
quirks and undiscovered strengths of his mounts, and learned, as he
says, something new with each ride.
</P>
<P>
   Aboard the favored Indian Charlie in the Kentucky Derby, for
instance, Stevens said he could tell his horse was a likely loser
before he even walked into the gate. Indian Charlie finished third.
Then, after Indian Charlie was held out of the Preakness, Stevens
climbed aboard Victory Gallop, a horse he had never touched before.
Honoring the code among jockeys, Stevens did not consult with the
rider he had replaced. Instead, he studied a videotape of the Derby
and relied on his instincts.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews before and after the Derby and Preakness, Stevens,
along with Jerry Bailey, another Hall of Fame jockey, pulled back
the curtain to reveal a bit of the little-understood world of
jockey and race horse, allowing a glimpse into a modern version of
an ancient art, the communication between man and beast.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the gifts I feel I have is that I can get acquainted
with a horse in the 8 or 10 minutes of the post parade,'' Stevens
said. ``They're comfortable with me, I'm comfortable with them.
They gain my trust. I want to know their quirks, their
idiosyncrasies.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A jockey's preparation begins the night before the race, with a
weight-conscious meal. In the morning, the jockey reads The Daily
Racing Form to assess his mount's chances and the running styles of
the other horses. During the post parade, he begins the process of
reading his horse's body language: are his ears swirling like a
radar dish, alert to his surroundings? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Once the race starts, the jockey balances himself on the balls
of his feet in the stirrups (he does not sit in the saddle),
hunches forward to grab the reins just behind the horse's neck and
guides his mount through a maze of flying hooves and dirt. He
steers the horse, often moving as fast as 37 miles an hour, with
tugs on the reins, which are attached to the bit, a piece of metal
that fits in the horse's mouth. The jockey must make split-second
decisions to get through holes that could close instantly, all
while fighting the temptation to move too soon, which could leave
his horse weary for the stretch drive. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I ride high in the saddle early on,'' Stevens said. ``As the
race progresses, and I get more physical _ it's like a locomotive.
You should be strongest the last eighth. In the stretch, you use
your forearms, your shoulders, your whole upper body more or
less.''
</P>
<P>
   Bailey said he keeps tension in the reins, using them ``like a
fishing line.'' ``You let the reins run through your fingers,''
Bailey said. ``You give him his head. You pick up the bit, then
push with your arms.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To stay fit, jockeys strike a balance between strength and
weight. In most races, horses carry about 117 pounds, which
includes the saddle and the jockey's silks and boots. In Triple
Crown races, horses carry 126 pounds. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to be able to wake up and go climb on a horse,'' said
Stevens, who now stretches before races. ``I'm as flexible as I was
before, but I have to work on it now.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bailey's diet is typical of a jockey's, but seems more suited
for a supermodel. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll have coffee in the morning, with some toast, or a bagel,
or a muffin,'' he said. ``During the day, maybe I'll have an apple,
or a banana, or a candy bar, but not much. It's important for me to
eat dinner early. I can eat the same thing at 8 or at 6, but if I
eat late I'll weigh a pound more the next day. At special events,
like charity balls, I eat before I go, then get dressed up.''
</P>
<P>
   The Triple Crown began with the May 2 Kentucky Derby. Stevens
was riding Indian Charlie, the Santa Anita Derby winner, and
Bailey, 40, was on Cape Town, the Florida Derby winner. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I've learned to expect the unexpected in the Kentucky Derby,''
Stevens said before the race. ``Even though you feel you know what
is going to happen, you don't take it for granted. Indian Charlie
hasn't been the greatest actor in the starting gate. I want to keep
him relaxed, yet alert. It's important to get a good break. This
race, nothing can go wrong. Everything has to be perfect. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``This horse is difficult the first 100 yards,'' Stevens said.
``He pulls. But once he relaxes, I slide my hands back down to his
withers. That's where he seems comfortable. I don't want to pull
back, but I want to keep the bit in his mouth, secure.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On the first turn, Stevens said, ``You assess who's in front of
you and who's behind you. If someone you expect to be in front of
you is not, you're smiling, because you know he's been taken out of
his game plan.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``On the backside,'' he added, ``you're assessing the time and
the pace and how much horse you've got. You assess the horses in
front of you and decide, Do I need to press or sit where I'm at? I
do it on instinct. You can't go in with a set game plan. You have
to adjust instantly and have a horse that can adjust instantly.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   The morning of the Derby, Bailey arrived at the track just after
8, spent 15 minutes in the sauna and watched television. But he was
eager to ride in the early Churchill Downs races. It had rained
much of the week, and Bailey wanted to determine if the racecourse
had any biases _ was the inside drier, the backstretch deeper?
</P>
<P>
   Indian Charlie started from Post 8, just outside Favorite Trick,
a slot Stevens himself had selected. Both horses have early speed.
</P>
<P>
   ``A race like this, with the tactics involved, I'd rather be
outside the other speed,'' he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Indian Charlie was undefeated going into the Derby, but Stevens,
a three-time winner of the race, saw signs, unseen by others during
the post parade, that shook his confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very, very quiet,'' he said of Indian Charlie.
``Usually he's active and full of himself. When they sing `My Old
Kentucky Home,' you know there's going to be an eruption from the
crowd at the end, so I grabbed some of his mane, but there was no
reaction from him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He broke clean,'' Stevens said. ``He relaxed real well off the
pace. He hit the three-eighths pole and got to the lead without
encouragement, but as Real Quiet moved toward me, I knew I didn't
have enough horse to put Indian Charlie into a drive at that point
and still finish in the top five. Midway around the turn, I knew I
was running for second money.''
</P>
<P>
   Indian Charlie did not hold on, finishing third behind Real
Quiet and Victory Gallop. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Stevens said a tired horse feels ``like a car engine that's out
of gas. It's misfiring. There's no fuel. It would be like you
running five miles. After four, your legs might feel like Jell-O.
That's what it's like, like  &QC; Jell-O under you.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Stevens used his whip on Indian Charlie, but not as extensively
as he did on Silver Charm in the stretch drive of their 1997 Derby
victory. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Silver Charm, I got after him a lot, but I wasn't striking him
hard. I was in rhythm with him. This horse,'' Stevens said,
referring to Indian Charlie, ``responds more to my hands. He's more
alert to what I want to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Cape Town, meanwhile, started from Post 11. On the final turn,
``I got a thrill,'' Bailey said. ``Cape Town grabbed the bit and
followed Real Quiet to the quarter pole without me asking him a
lot. He was keeping up on his own. Real Quiet went on by Indian
Charlie big time. I asked Cape Town, but he was not able to hit
that extra gear. He got up to third behind Real Quiet, but he
didn't have it.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cape Town finished fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks later, at the Preakness at Pimlico Race Course, Cape
Town and Bailey were back for Round 2 of the Triple Crown, but
Indian Charlie was not. His trainer, Bob Baffert, determined the
colt was worn out by the Derby. Stevens, however, was chosen to
replace Alex Solis on Victory Gallop. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Alex and I are very close,'' Stevens said the day before the
Preakness.. ``Obviously, I feel bad for him. ``But it's happened to
me before, just like it's happened to Alex, and it will happen
again. I'm not an idiot. I'm not going to say, `No, I don't want to
ride the horse because Alex is my friend.''' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Stevens had never ridden Victory Gallop, but felt he could not
go over strategy with Solis. Only if a jockey loses his mount
because of injury, and not against his will, is it appropriate to
consult, Stevens said.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens thus watched replays of the Kentucky Derby to learn what
he could do with Victory Gallop, and relied on his innate ability.
He wanted only minimal instructions from the horse's trainer,
Elliott Walden.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am going to go out there with an open mind,'' Stevens said.
``You don't know what kind of hand you're going to be dealt until
you get out there on the race track and are warming up. I've
noticed a big difference with all three of my Derby winners coming
from Kentucky to Baltimore. Even with the win here last year with
Silver Charm, he wasn't the same horse that I'd ridden in the
Derby. You just hope they can come back to near their form. I think
it's kind of foolish to hope that a horse moves forward after the
Kentucky Derby. It defies logic.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The day before the Preakness, the early favorite, the speedy
Coronado's Quest, was scratched. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Stevens initially said he would not change his strategy of
laying back and taking advantage of Victory Gallop's ``devastating
kick.'' But the next day he reconsidered. Believing the only horse
he had to beat was Real Quiet, Stevens used Victory Gallop during
the early portion of the race to keep Real Quiet and his jockey,
Desormeaux, wide. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Real Quiet looked a picture saddling in the infield. I knew it
was going to be a horse race,'' Stevens said. Warming up, Stevens
found Victory Gallop ``lively, but kind at the same time.'' His
ears were moving about, a sign of intelligence and curiosity, and
he responded to the slightest of tugs on the reins. ``Certain
horses, you get on them, and you know they're not comfortable. He
felt like my old Porsche.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Just as we turned up the backside, Kent was four wide,''
Stevens said, pleased he had kept his rival wide. ``I was one off
the fence. Kent started creeping up. He had a half-length on me.
There was a gap between two horses in front of me. I used my horse
to get up in there and force Kent wide. I angled out sharply. I
didn't want to get caught behind dying horses at the quarter pole. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Approaching the quarter pole, I asked him for his best run,
and he responded. Two strides later, Kent went by me. I knew Real
Quiet wasn't going to stop. You just concede defeat and try to get
second.'' Victory Gallop held on for second. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cape Town, meanwhile, struggled at the back of the pack. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``You want a horse reaching out, hitting the ground and reaching
out. A horse in discomfort won't reach out,'' Bailey said.
``There's a shortness of stride, a roughness to his gait. He wears
out quickly. When that happens, you just try to get him home safely
and see what the problem is.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cape Town finished ninth among 10 horses. X-rays later revealed
a fractured bone in the horse's ankle. Cape Town was retired. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bailey will be back in the Belmont aboard one of the trainer D.
Wayne Lukas' two starters, either Grand Slam or Yarrow Brae. Having
changed tactics in the Preakness, Stevens said he would ride
Victory Gallop in the Belmont the same way Solis did in the Derby. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``By changing his style,'' Stevens said, ``I might have taken
away his final punch.''

RUN FOR YOUR LIVES, VIRTUAL PETS!
</HEADLINE>

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Godzilla always seems to be fighting someone: King Kong, Mothra,
Bambi, and for the past two weeks, Ferris Bueller ...
</P>
<P>
   Get ready for Godzilla vs. Tamagotchi.
</P>
<P>
   Kristen Brennan of Berkeley, Calif., created a site
(www.jitterbug.com/gvt/gvt.shtml) that pits the high-maintenance
virtual pets against the big lizard in a Shockwave-powered online
battle.
</P>
<P>
   If you've seen the 1969 film short ``Bambi Meets Godzilla,'' in
which Bambi meets a grisly end, then you're prepared for Godzilla
vs. Tamagotchi.
</P>
<P>
   In Brennan's game, tiny cyberpets wander across a screen on a
Tamagotchi egg, mocking players with their cuteness. Players score
points by crushing the digital creatures into a pulp by clicking
buttons that activate Godzilla's foot. The more pets you smash, the
more points you score.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, it sounds brutal, but it must be OK, because it was
developed by a former Tamagotchi owner.
</P>
<P>
   Brennan, who is editor of an online humor e-zine called
Jitterbug Fantasia, came up with the game after one of her
Tamagotchi pets died.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the best way to revenge oneself on a Tamagotchi for
breaking your heart?'' Brennan said. ``Obviously, to recruit
Japan's other major export, Godzilla, to crush the little (toy)
into bits.''
</P>
<P>
   Brennan gained notoriety on the Internet after developing Loving
Henry, a Shockwave-powered digital comic book. Using Shockwave,
readers can turn the virtual pages of the online comic book, which
follows a woman's love for her husband, a bug-eyed alien.
</P>
<P>
   Reaction to Brennan's Godzilla-Tamagotchi game has been
positive, she said. Apparently, no one seems offended at seeing
cuddly cyberpets smashed like bugs.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, ``kids write that they love the `thumb-candy' aspect of
the game,'' Brennan said. ``Parents write that their kids'
Tamagotchi toys have been driving them crazy, and they're happy to
work out some aggression online.''
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, no one gets hurt _ except for a few cyberpets.

BILINGUAL EDUCATION'S SUPPORTERS SUE TO BLOCK BAN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (See also CALIF-ELECT, CALIF-LABOR, OAKLAND-ELECT) 
(bl) 
 By ETHAN BRONNER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Minority-rights advocates, stung by the decisive success of a
voter initiative in California ending bilingual education there,
filed suit in U.S. District Court in San Francisco on Wednesday to
prevent the resolution from taking effect. They asserted that it
violated the U.S. Constitution's promise of equal protection as
well as federal education and civil rights laws.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who took part in the lawsuit Wednesday was the
Southern Christian Leadership Conference of Los Angeles. Its
executive director, Genethia Hayes, said, ``Proposition 227 will
prove the most devastating piece of legislation for
language-minority students in the history of public education in
the state.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It removes,'' she said, ``all hope of equitable access to
employment, college admission, and success, and full participation
in a democratic society.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, California's education officials said they were
examining budget, material and staffing requirements of Proposition
227, which gives them 60 days to dismantle hundreds of bilingual
education programs and replace them with intensive one-year
immersion classes for the 1.4 million pupils in the state who have
limited proficiency in English.
</P>
<P>
   Since California accounts for nearly half the students in the
nation with special English-learning needs, the 61 percent to 39
percent vote for Proposition 227 in California reverberated across
the country, where many bilingual programs have been under scrutiny
and attack in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this initiative will represent the beginning of the
end of bilingual education around the United States,'' said Ron
Unz, the Silicon Valley software entrepreneur who sponsored
Proposition 227, adding that he did not consider the legal
challenges to be serious.
</P>
<P>
   A bill limiting federal aid to bilingual education sponsored by
Rep. Frank Riggs, R-Calif., was to be considered Thursday by the
House Committee on Education and the Workforce, and seemed likely
to pass.
</P>
<P>
   The bill limits the use of federal money in bilingual education
programs to three years and removes the requirement that most of
the federal financing for such programs be used for native language
instruction.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But James Lyons, executive director of the National Association
for Bilingual Education, a private non-profit group in Washington,
predicted that the federal lawsuit would be successful and that
bilingual education would continue to thrive in California and
across the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm positive this is going to stop here,'' Lyons said. ``It is
divisive, destructive and, thank God, most people outside
California know better.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal money for bilingual education amounts to only about $400
million annually, to which states add much more, but passage of
such a bill would mark an important political victory for those
seeking to limit or end bilingual education.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, many school officials nationwide were defiant. New
York City Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew said Wednesday, ``This is
not in any way, shape or form a policy direction I agree with.''
</P>
<P>
   Crew said his staff has spent the past year reviewing bilingual
education as part of an effort to raise academic standards in the
1.1 million-student school system, the nation's largest.
</P>
<P>
   About 150,000 New York City students have limited English
proficiency. A draft policy seeking to speed their acquisition of
English will be presented to the board next fall, but it will not
take California's ``cold turkey'' approach, Crew said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should not be abandoned,'' Crew said of the program. ``It
should be strengthened.''
</P>
<P>
   At its core, bilingual education teaches children in their
native tongue while gradually teaching them English so that after a
few years they can join mainstream classes.
</P>
<P>
   Current bilingual education programs date from the late 1960s.
While there are scores of immigrant groups in the country, about
three-fourths of children with English learning needs are Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   But critics have complained that such programs segregate
children and delay their transition into regular classes by several
years.
</P>
<P>
   In California, the problem has been that the large numbers of
Mexicans moving into the state have settled in distinct communities
which has impeded their assimilation.
</P>
<P>
   Unz said Wednesday that his concern was for the youngsters who
were not learning enough English to succeed in American society.
</P>
<P>
   Under Proposition 227, students whose English is limited will
enter regular classes after a year of intensive language
instruction. But the measure also permits parents to choose
bilingual education under exceptional circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Unz said he expected a few bilingual programs to survive, and
said he hoped the better ones would.
</P>
<P>
   The political obstacles the initiative overcame _ opposition by,
among others President Clinton, the chairmen of the state
Democratic and Republican parties, all four candidates for governor
and the editorial pages of the state's largest papers _ was
testimony to its popularity among the voters, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Unz also asserted that his side spent only $1.2 million from
start to finish, a paltry sum by the standards of other voter
initiatives in the state, and much less than the $3.2 million his
opponents say they spent.

DISCOVERY NEARS FINAL MIR LINKUP 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK CARREAU 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The shuttle Discovery on Wednesday sailed closer to a
final U.S. linkup with Russia's Mir space station, a potentially
historic event that may unfold largely without live television from
NASA.
</P>
<P>
   The two spacecraft were to join Thursday while soaring 240 miles
above Earth. It was the ninth shuttle trip to Mir.
</P>
<P>
   NASA is accustomed to beaming live television views of its
astronauts to Earth almost at will through the satellite
communications network it fully established nearly a decade ago.
However, a puzzling problem with a dish-shaped communications
antenna aboard Discovery has prevented the shuttle astronauts from
transmitting live video since blasting off two days ago.
</P>
<P>
   If U.S. ground control teams are unable to pinpoint the
difficulty, they will have to rely on the Russians for sporadic
live video of the linkup and a post-docking ceremony scheduled to
follow aboard Mir. It may also be possible for the shuttle crew to
transmit video for brief periods over an FM link to ground stations
in California, Florida and Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may not be as much as we have had in the past, and that
will be disappointing for us,'' said Lee Briscoe, NASA's mission
operations director. ``We're all looking forward to it, seeing as
how it's the last flight. But we will just have to cope.''
</P>
<P>
   Engineers believed the difficulty was with an ``on-off'' switch
within the antenna that could be bypassed by the astronauts with a
rerouting of power cables. But NASA was reluctant to attempt a
major repair before today's docking.
</P>
<P>
   The same antenna also functions as the radar transmitter and
receiver the shuttle crew will use during Thursday's rendezvous
activities with Mir. A post-launch test of the antenna in the radar
mode revealed it was unaffected by the switch problem, Briscoe
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Discovery crew plans to retrieve U.S. astronaut Andy Thomas,
who has been living and working aboard Mir since late January. He
is the last of seven Americans assigned to live and work aboard the
Russian outpost as part of a cooperative program to prepare the two
countries for the upcoming assembly of a new international space
station.
</P>
<P>
   Asleep when Discovery blasted off, Thomas was elated early
Wednesday when he learned the shuttle was safely on its way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, excellent,'' he told NASA personnel at the Russian control
center in suburban Moscow when informed. ``You're a saint to get on
the (communications network) and tell me that.''
</P>
<P>
   Temporarily, Discovery's antenna difficulties prevented an eager
team of ground-based physicists from monitoring the readings of an
experimental observatory aboard Discovery called the Alpha Magnetic
Spectrometer.
</P>
<P>
   Late Wednesday, the shuttle crew managed to rewire its
communications so that it could transmit directly to several ground
stations for brief periods each day. Meanwhile, all of the AMS
findings are being recorded aboard Discovery for post-flight
assessments.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially a 7,000 pound barrel-shaped magnet equipped with
electronic sensors and mounted in Discovery's payload bay, the AMS
was developed to search for evidence of cosmic antimatter.
</P>
<P>
   Some theorists believe that equal quantities of normal matter
and antimatter were created with an explosive event dubbed the Big
Bang that marked the creation of the universe billions of years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Cosmic antimatter, if it exists, has so far escaped detection by
astronomers. Nonetheless, some cosmologists believe it may exist as
antistars or antigalaxies in the distant universe.
</P>
<P>
   The AMS is searching for stray remnants of antimatter created by
the big bang as they race through space near the Earth in the form
of cosmic ray particles with electrical charges opposite those of
normal matter. Electrons, for instance, would be positively charged
and called positrons. Antimatter protons would be negatively
charged and called antiprotons.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists believe that antimatter particles may be so rare that
it will require at least a three-year stay by the AMS aboard the
new international space station to detect it in significant
quantities. The observatory was launched aboard Discovery as a test
flight to ensure it can function reliably aboard the orbital
laboratory.

BISHOP'S ADMITTED SEXUAL MISCONDUCT STUNS DIOCESE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MIREYA NAVARRO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ At 7:30 Wednesday morning, the people
attending Mass at Mary Immaculate Catholic Church here received an
invitation, not to a parish event or ecclesiastical service, but to
a one-on-one discussion with their pastor about relationships and
``past hurts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to use this opportunity as a teaching opportunity,''
the Rev. Timothy Lynch, Mary Immaculate's parish priest, said in an
interview. ``If people are carrying the burden of past hurts I'd
hope to be able to offer some counseling and be an instrument of
reconciliation.''
</P>
<P>
   Personal counseling at churches and question-and-answer sessions
at Catholic schools were some of the ways members of the Diocese of
Palm Beach dealt Wednesday with the shock of the resignation of
their bishop, after he admitted to having sexually molested five
boys early in his priesthood. Another way was to ask victims of the
bishop, Joseph Keith Symons, to come forward.
</P>
<P>
   Although Symons, 65, is not the first Roman Catholic bishop to
resign for sexual misconduct, he is believed to be the first such
high-ranking church official to have admitted to sexually abusing
minors.
</P>
<P>
   The news stunned a small diocese with a Catholic population of
about 205,000 in five Florida counties and underscored the depth of
a scourge American church officials say they have struggled to
address with more openness in the last five years. But the case
came as no surprise to some victims' groups that say sexual abuse
by clergy is more widespread than it is generally believed and that
the church has yet to adequately deal with the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Symons, a Michigan native who served in Florida since his
ordainment in 1958 and had led the Diocese of Palm Beach since
1990, left Monday for an undisclosed location for what diocese
officials described as spiritual and possibly medical treatment.
Pope John Paul II accepted his resignation and appointed Bishop
Robert Lynch, of the Diocese of St. Petersburg, as the apostolic
administrator of Palm Beach until a successor is named.
</P>
<P>
   ``As painful as it is for me and will be for others, I feel it
important to make public the reason for my resignation,'' Symons
wrote in a statement released this week in which he apologized ``to
all of whom I have hurt'' and asked others ``to pray for me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Early in my 40 years of priestly ministry,'' he wrote, ``I was
involved in inappropriate sexual behavior with minors.''
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Tuesday, Lynch refused to identify the
parishes where the abuse took place but said the case became known
five weeks ago when one of the victims, now a middle-aged man,
contacted a church official and reported the bishop had molested
him for several years when he was a teenager. When confronted with
the allegations, Symons confessed and revealed that there were four
other victims.
</P>
<P>
   In his written statement, Symons said that ``I have in
succeeding years tried to live my promises of celibacy and chastity
and have immersed myself in my ministry as priest and as bishop.''
He told Lynch the sexual activity stopped at least 25 years ago but
Lynch on Tuesday made a point of encouraging other possible victims
to seek the diocese's assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Cupp, an assistant state attorney in Palm Beach County who
handles crimes against children, said the cases may be too old for
prosecution but that the information is being disseminated to state
attorney offices with jurisdiction for their review.
</P>
<P>
   In recent decades, two American archbishops have resigned over
sexual liaisons with adult women and the Catholic church has paid
millions of dollars to victims who claim their priests abused them,
often in out-of-court settlements. Officials with the National
Conference of Catholic Bishops say an ad hoc committee of bishops
started meeting five years ago to develop a policy to address
increasing reports of sexual misconduct by clergy.
</P>
<P>
   The committee came up with five principles that call for a
prompt response to allegations of abuse and the removal of
offenders from ministerial duties and their referral to medical
evaluation and treatment. The policy also calls for reporting
incidents to law enforcement, reaching out to victims, including
paying for therapy, and discussing incidents with members of the
church ``as openly as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The officials pointed at the Diocese of Palm Beach's
announcement about Symons at a news conference as a reflection of
the new approach. In a written statement, Bishop Anthony Pilla,
president of the bishops' conference, called Symons' departure ``a
difficult moment'' but added that ``the well-being of the whole
Church demands that her leaders not give, either by action or
omission, any indication of tolerance of inappropriate and abusive
behavior on the part of those who serve in her name.''
</P>
<P>
   But some victims' groups say application of the conference's
policy varies widely among parishes and that incidents of sexual
abuse are still shrouded in secrecy. Often the first accusations
are ignored and victims are treated like enemies, they say, or
priests are removed quietly.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors tend to sit on allegations unless victims are
numerous, victims say. It is not unusual for victims to wait a long
time before reporting the incident, usually after many years of
therapy, but many do not bother to ever come forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``They blame themselves much more often than in other cases and
they are more pessimistic about change happening,'' said David
Clohessy, national director of ``Survivors Network of Those Abused
by Priests,'' an 8-year-old support group based in Chicago with
more than 3,000 members. ``They weigh their own credibility against
what is often a very popular, charismatic priest and they think, `I
don't have a chance.'''

</P>
<P>
   Others argue that a fundamental problem is that by restricting
the priesthood to a pool that leaves out women and sexually active
men, the church automatically ends up with a higher risk of
attracting undesirables. Jason Berry, the author of ``Lead Us Not
Into Temptation'' (Doubleday, 1992), a history of sexual abuse by
Catholic clergy in the United States, said incidents the church
regard as aberrations are really part of ``a deep, systemic problem
evident worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can't arrest the problem without focusing on the root of
the problem _that only unmarried men can serve as priests,'' Berry
said.
</P>
<P>
   In Palm Beach, Symons was credited with fostering the growth of
parishes and financial stability. Some saw his emphasis on raising
money for education as atonement for his sins. Monsignor John
McMahon, of Saint Joan of Arc Church in Boca Raton, said for
several years the bishop also invited psychologists and lawyers to
speak to priests in the diocese about pedophilia.
</P>
<P>
   ``He asked us if anyone had this orientation to please seek
treatment,'' the monsignor said. ``He wanted to make us aware.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, no one seems to know what prospects Symons faces in the
church.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's obviously a tinge of disappointment,'' said the Rev.
Michael Edwards, a spokesman for the Diocese of Palm Beach, ``but
also the recollection of a man that was very compassionate and very
gentle and meant so much to so many people.''
</P>
<P>
   Marie Rollande Leclerc, a retired nurse and parishioner at
Symons' Cathedral of St. Ignatius Loyola in Palm Beach Gardens,
said she would have never expected this from a priest she described
as ``so dignified.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I still have my faith but I'm very, very disturbed,'' she
said. ``It is better to have some love and pray for him. It's just
as if somebody had passed away.''

CITY FINDS TOO FEW LIFEGUARDS FOR SUMMER CROWDS

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ This one has city officials stumped: Why are there
not enough lifeguards to staff New York City's seven beaches and 55
outdoor pools, despite an aggressive recruitment initiative?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're simply not optimistic,'' said Alan Moss, the first
deputy commissioner for the Department of Parks and Recreation, the
agency that recruits the expert swimmers. ``There's a genuine
shortage of qualified lifeguards.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though his agency has the budgeted to hire 1,200 lifeguards
each summer, the city has hired only about 400 this year, with
summer less than three weeks away. As a result, since the Memorial
Day beach openings, large sections of the city's beachfront have
been closed, presenting a hardship for bathers and vendors alike.
</P>
<P>
   The situation is so dire that for the first time the city is
allowing nonresidents to apply for the lifeguard jobs, which pay
$8.64 an hour for 48-hour weeks. Furthermore, the Parks Department
has recruited in high schools and colleges in New Jersey,
Connecticut, Long Island and Westchester.
</P>
<P>
   Moss said that with the robust economy, high school and college
students are finding more lucrative jobs that also give them more
leisure time. He also said that there may be a shortage of
candidates because high schools do not emphasize swimming the way
they used to.
</P>
<P>
   But J.D. LaRock, a spokesman for the Board of Education, pointed
out that there has been an increase in the number of swim teams in
city high schools, up to 74 this year from 68 last year. Still only
29 of the city's 208 high schools have swimming pools.
</P>
<P>
   Besides placing ads in 12 local newspapers and magazines and
having the mayor announce openings on his weekly radio program, the
Parks Department has arranged a tie-in with a ``Baywatch'' event on
April 22 in Washington Square Park, in which two of the shows
stars, Michael Bergin and Angelica Bridges made appearances and
urged people to try out for the city's lifeguard positions.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Brooklyn Borough president, Howard Golden, who held a
news conference Wednesday on the Coney Island Boardwalk to
criticize the city's failure to prepare the beach for summer, said
he does not think the Parks Department is doing enough to combat
the lifeguard drought.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a dismal failure,'' Golden said. ``On Memorial Day
10 out of 22 bays were closed here in Coney Island. What's needed
is borough-wide, year-round recruitment.''
</P>
<P>
   At the news conference, in which he complained about the
condition of Coney Island's boardwalk and public restroom
facilities, Golden advocated moving lifeguard hiring from the
Park's Department to another agency, perhaps the Board of
Education.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't seem to be able to get their act together,'' he
said of the Parks Department. ``They should provide training year
round for people interested in the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Reichenthal, the district manager of Community Board 13,
which covers Coney Island, said the lifeguard problem has hurt
business for local vendors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get complaints from people in the community and
businesses,'' he said. ``What was the point of replenishing the
beaches? We have long, clean beaches waiting for swimming. People
from Staten Island like one section of the beach and when people
come and find out the section they like is closed, they get upset.
If they have to walk seven blocks to the beach because a section is
closed, they might not come back.''
</P>
<P>
   In order to qualify for the city's week-long, 40-hour lifeguard
course _ passing it guarantees the job _ one must be at least 16
years old, able to swim 50 yards in 35 seconds, have at least 20/40
to 20/30 unaided vision, and have a doctor's note stating that he
or she is in good physical condition. To pass the 40-hour course,
applicants must be able to swim 440 yards in 6 minutes and 40
seconds for beach patrol, and be able to swim 440 yards in 7
minutes and 40 seconds for pool patrol.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't compromise public safety,'' said Henry Stern, the
parks commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged that the Parks Department only hired 870
lifeguards last year, so parts of some beaches were closed. ``But
there was no drowning on our watch,'' he added.

KOREAN AIR WON'T DELAY ORDER FOR 27 BOEING 737 JETS 
</HEADLINE>
  (dc) 
 By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Korean Air, bucking a trend that has seen many Asian airlines
delay orders for new airplanes as a result of the region's economic
crisis, plans to announce next week that it is buying 27 new Boeing
737 passenger jets valued at $1.35 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The new order is expected to be announced Tuesday during the
state visit to Washington of South Korea's newly elected president,
Kim Dae Jung. It is good news for Boeing, which said only last week
that weakening demand from Asia would force it to cut production of
the 747 jumbo jet next year.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Asian economy went into a tailspin last summer,
airline passenger traffic in the region has plunged as well. In the
last week alone, Malaysian Airline System said that it would delay
delivery of several Boeing 747 and 777 airplanes and Taiwan's Eva
Airways, dropped plans to buy at least six long-range A340 aircraft
worth $900 million built by Airbus Industrie, Boeing's archrival.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing is also concerned that an order it is expecting to get
from China during President Clinton's state visit there later this
month will be smaller than the company had hoped.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are extremely pleased that Korean Air is exercising
leadership in Asia by stepping forward, even during difficult
times, with this order,'' said Carie Cable, a Boeing spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   But selling the single-aisle, twin-engine 737 is not nearly as
lucrative for Boeing as selling wide-body models like the 747 and
777. And Boeing apparently gambled that by the time Korean Air
begins taking delivery of the planes in 2000, Asia's economic
crisis will be over.
</P>
<P>
   Yang Ho Cho, Korean Air's chief executive, said in an interview
that the airline, which is a subsidiary of the Hanjin Group and is
already heavily in debt, has had trouble borrowing overseas since
South Korea's economy collapsed last year. He said Boeing was
willing to accept a smaller down payment for the new planes, giving
the airline time to arrange financing later.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe by the year 2000, when our economic situation
improves, financial institutions will offer to finance it,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, Cho added, Korean Air, too, may have to consider
delaying its purchase of new wide-body jets. The airline plans to
receive a total of 10 747s and 777s and Airbus A330s this year and
a combination of 11 more in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are looking at right now,'' he said. ``It depends on the
economic situation. We have the option to delay.''
</P>
<P>
   Cho said that the new 737-800 and 737-900 aircraft will replace
26 older Fokker and McDonnell Douglas narrow-body jets. They will
be flown domestically and on routes to China, Japan and
destinations in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Korean Air already flies to dozens of cities in China and it is
betting heavily on China's future economic growth. Cho said that
with the completion of a new international airport in Inchon in
2000, South Korea had the potential to become a major hub
connecting travelers from North America to China.
</P>
<P>
   The new airplanes, which have a longer range and are more fuel
efficient than Korean Air's current narrow-body fleet, will also
lower the airline's maintenance costs and give it more flexibility.
Right now the airline must use a 250-seat Airbus to fly from Seoul
to Ho Chi Minh City because it does not have a smaller plane that
can fly the distance.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts suggested that the order was a way for South Korea
to thank the United States for supporting the $50 billion bailout
the country received from the International Monetary Fund. Cho said
that the timing of the order and President Kim's visit was ``just a
coincidence.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, ``Probably President Kim will be proud to talk
about this with President Clinton when they meet.''

CHANGING INDUSTRY FORCED MERRILL LYNCH TO RETHINK ORANGE COUNTY
SUIT 
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Calif.) (js) 
 By LESLIE WAYNE with ANDREW POLLACK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   From the day, more than three years ago, when Orange County,
Calif., shocked the world of finance and filed for bankruptcy, to
the announcement this week that Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co.had agreed to
pay $400 million to settle litigation for its role in that matter,
Merrill has maintained its innocence.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, until it agreed to write the check, Merrill had kept a
combative stance _ refusing to fire any employees involved in the
Orange County disaster, hiring platoons of lawyers to defend itself
and keeping up a public relations campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But in the intervening years, much has changed, even though
Merrill continues to assert its innocence. Those changes, say some,
explain why Merrill, around a month ago, signaled to Orange County
that it was ready to negotiate in earnest to head off a scheduled
September trial in a $2 billion lawsuit brought by the county. The
lawsuit alleged Merrill had sold speculative securities, in
violation of California law, to a county-run investment pool that
lost $1.6 billion after making a wrong-way bet on interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, Merrill was finding itself shut out of much
municipal business in California and its reputation as a municipal
bond underwriter and financial adviser was tarnished throughout the
country by this episode. A trial with headlines that would put the
phrase ``investment losses'' in the same sentence as Merrill Lynch
would only rekindle much of this bad publicity just as it was
beginning to die out.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, at a time when the financial services industry is
being reshaped by multibillion-dollar mergers of Wall Street
brokers, like Merrill, and banks and insurance companies, Merrill
would find it easier to be a player in this merger game, either as
a buyer or seller, with no major lawsuits still outstanding.
</P>
<P>
   Under its chief executive, David Komansky, Merrill has been a
leading lobbyist in Washington for legislation that would eliminate
many of the regulatory barriers to these mergers and allow them to
proceed more easily. ``From Merrill's point of view, the more
publicity that they would get from Orange County, the worse it
would get for them,'' said Raphael Soifer, an analyst at Brown
Brothers Harriman. ``They were facing the publicity of a long trial
and, also, the uncertain outcome of a home town jury. It seems like
settling would be the reasonable thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   James Spiotto, municipal finance attorney at Chapman &AMP; Cutler in
Chicago, added: ``Right now, Orange County is far enough in the
memory for lots of people that it's like water over the dam.
Merrill wants to keep it behind them.''
</P>
<P>
   Settlement talks between attorneys for Merrill and for Orange
County began in earnest around three weeks ago, after the country
had already gained $172 million from three lesser defendants, KPMG
Peat Marwick, Credit Suisse First Boston and LeBoeuf, Lamb, Green &AMP;
MacRae. Mediation talks, under local rules in federal court in
California, are mandatory, but are not binding on the parties. In
those talks, however, Thomas Hayes, the former California state
treasurer who heads Orange County's litigation effort, said it
``became clear it was a difficult lawsuit that could go either way
before a jury.''
</P>
<P>
   George Schieren, Merrill's general counsel, said: ``The question
for us was whether you are better off with the certainty of a
negotiation or risk the uncertainty of a trial. This has nothing to
do with how we feel about our conduct. A jury could see it
differently. We made a decision that we were much better off with
the certainty of a settlement. We took the mediation process
seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   A settlement, even as large as $400 million, clears Merrill to
proceed more easily in the emerging financial marketplace _ freed
from having to go before shareholders and boards of directors of
companies they might wish to acquire or join and provide guesses of
their dollar exposure in Orange County and, again, explain their
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's the argument, and it's all very speculative, that
Merrill is folding its cards quickly to clear the decks,'' said
Samuel Liss, an analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston. This year,
Merrill has taken new strategic steps, spending $7 billion to
acquire Mercury Asset Management, a London-based firm, and taking
an equity stake in the former Yamaichi Securities in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   According to Merrill, the $400 million payment will not hurt
earnings, nor will it affect employee compensation. Schieren said
that reserves had already been set aside to fully cover this and
that any impact on earnings had already been felt.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Still unresolved, however, is a potential Securities and
Exchange Commission action against Merrill. Merrill has confirmed
the SEC has authorized its staff to bring an enforcement action
over allegations of lax disclosure in Merrill's role as an
underwriter of Orange County debt. Merrill has already paid $30
million to Orange County to settle a separate criminal case _ and,
now, is fighting in to keep all documents related to that case out
of the public domain.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Stamenson, the Merrill securities salesman at the center
of the scandal, is still employed at Merrill's San Francisco
office. ``He's working full time on the litigation,'' Schieren,
Merrill's lawyer, said.
</P>
<P>
   For some in Orange County, the settlement is good news,
especially since a strong Orange County economy has softened the
blow of the investment losses. ``It's a major settlement,'' said
Paul Brady, city manager of Irvine, Calif., ``It far exceeds our
expectations when we first got into it. And, when we look at the
county four years later, it's basically business as usual.'' &QL;

 (For use by clients of the New York Times News Service)   Chip Sales To Slip, But Rebound Next Year  
   
 By Dan Fost  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
A glut of memory chips, economic woes in Asia and slowing sales of
personal computers have dimmed the luster of the semiconductor
industry, but not its confidence.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Industry sales will slip 1.8 percent this year, but should
rebound to double-digit growth next year, according to a report
released yesterday by the Semiconductor Industry Association, a
trade group based in San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   The group expects all the conditions that have dragged down the
chip market to reverse course by near year. It cited potential
growth in China leading a revitalized Asia, a long-awaited recovery
for the memory chip market, and renewed growth in PC sales. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Ninety percent of chip companies around the world contributed
their forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   The downturn in the chip industry has been painfully evident
this year with significant job reductions at Bay Area chipmakers
Intel, National Semiconductor and Cypress Semiconductor and chip
equipment manufacturers Applied Materials and Lam Research.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the turnaround won't come overnight, chip companies
expressed optimism that their business is just going through a
temporary down cycle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a couple of difficult quarters, but we do expect to
be working our way out of them,'' said Steve Tobak, vice president
of corporate marketing for Santa Clara-based National Semi. ``On
the whole, National should be bouncing back with the rest of the
industry, starting with the second half (of this year) and into
1999.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Intel, the industry leader with a microprocessor market
share approaching 90 percent, has seen flat growth for the past
year, and expects the trend to continue through the current
quarter, which ends June 30.
</P>
<P>
   Intel blames slower growth in PC sales, and the move to PCs that
sell for less than $1,000, which means less money for the
chipmakers. In addition, sales in Asia in general and Japan in
particular _ once powerful markets for the chip companies _ have
taken a tumble following the currency crises in several Asian
nations.
</P>
<P>
   While last year's forecast predicted sales to rise 24 percent in
Asia in 1998, revised figures put the growth at 3.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Worldwide semiconductor sales grew 4 percent in 1997. With this
year's anticipated 1.8 percent drop, they should hit $134.6 billion
for 1998, the association said.
</P>
<P>
   But with growth reaching 17 percent or better in each of the
next three years, the association expects sales to top $222 billion
by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts at Dataquest in San Jose agree with that view
_ particularly the notion that an oversupply of memory chips has
dragged the whole market down.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing lower prices today than even the most pessimistic
observers anticipated six months ago,'' said Dataquest analyst
Nathan Brookwood. ``We're seeing ads now for $1 a megabyte, where
it was $20 a megabyte for four years.''
</P>
<P>
   For consumers, Brookwood said, ``That is just awesome.'' For the
memory chip companies, he said, ``It's not pretty.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the memory chip companies are based in Korea and Japan,
with only one major U.S. supplier, Micron Corp. of Boise, Idaho.

 Computer Whiz Burns to Learn   By Jamie Beckett  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
By the time he was in eighth grade, Ramana Rao knew all the math
his school could teach him. He finished a four-year computer
science degree at MIT in three years. During a trip around the
world in 1983 and 1984, he went six months without sleeping more
than one night in the same place.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I have an enormous interest in knowledge and knowing,'' says
Rao.
</P>
<P>
   Now 35, he's chief technology officer at Inxight (pronounced
``insight''), one of several startups at Xerox's Palo Alto Research
Center (PARC). At PARC, Rao has spent the past eight years helping
create Inxight's software, a new graphical user interface that's
intended to make it easier to get at and organize information.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a computer, you're never in a flow state. You feel like
you're on the phone with someone stupid trying to get them to do
something simple,'' Rao said.
</P>
<P>
   Called the Hyperbolic Tree, the interface lets users see and
easily navigate an entire bank of information _ a Web site, an
organizational chart, a database _ at one glance. Instead of having
to click and scroll through numerous areas, users of the tree can
just select one area to zoom in on that information while shrinking
the rest of the display. It's fast and fluid, and it's especially
useful for Web surfing or handling huge amounts of related
information.
</P>
<P>
   Rao also co-invented Inxight's Table Lens, a technique for
viewing large tables of data that enables users to quickly pick out
patterns and anomalies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cars made all of us be able to run like leopards,'' he says.
``These tools could make us all think more like Einstein.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in India, Rao spent most of his youth in Texas, where his
father taught aerospace engineering at Texas A&AMP;M University.
</P>
<P>
   He was the only Indian in his class at school, but he says he
was seldom teased about his nationality. Most of his classmates
were more concerned whether he was ``a Yankee or a Rebel.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I said I'm from southern India, so I guess I'm a Rebel,'' Rao
recalls.
</P>
<P>
   He zipped through his studies easily _ in fifth grade, he zoomed
through 200 biographies _ and by the end of eighth grade, Rao had
read all the high school's math books. When his family moved to
Bellevue, Wash., he skipped 10th grade and graduated a year early.
</P>
<P>
   Rao went to MIT in 1979 planning to major in math; however, he
really was undecided about his future. He wanted to be a novelist.
He wanted to be an academic like his parents. (His mother got her
doctorate in microbiology after the family moved to the United
States.) He wanted to travel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to go to college and take the introductory course in
every subject,'' says Rao.
</P>
<P>
   He tested out of every freshman math and science course. Someone
told him about a computer science course but warned him that it was
too tough for freshmen.
</P>
<P>
   ``So of course I went into computer science almost
immediately,'' he says. It also fit his need to put off making
decisions about his life.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1980, Rao got a job at PARC. He was 17.
</P>
<P>
   ``I walked in and put my hand on a mouse, and I thought, `This
is going to change the world,''' says Rao. ``That inspired me, and
that inspiration is part of what set me off on these paths.''
</P>
<P>
   Rao finished his bachelor's degree and spent what would have
been his senior year working at a consulting firm to earn money. He
was reluctant to commit to a career in computer science _ or any
other career. After graduation, he set off with a backpack to
travel around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Although many people thought he was foolish not to immediately
grab the opportunities available to a bright, young computer
scientist, Rao recalls that PARC's director, John Seely Brown,
encouraged him to travel.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a profoundly creative mind, a passion for life and a
good feeling for technology,'' Brown recalls. ``I'm a firm believer
in the need to develop balanced creative geniuses.''
</P>
<P>
   The trip didn't really hurt Rao's technical career. When he
returned 13 months later, he began working toward his master's
degree at MIT. He went to work at PARC in 1986 and finished his
degree there in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   He joined the team working on the user interface in 1990.
Inxight was formed six years later.
</P>
<P>
   ``One feeling I had at PARC was that I could figure out the next
big thing,'' Rao says. The Inxight projects interested him because
it was practical and possible. ``I wanted it (what he worked on) to
be something I cared about and could see in the world.''

 (For use by clients of the New York Times News Service)   Reputed King of Junk E-mail Says He's Through Spamming  
   
 By Jon Swartz  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
The spam king has abdicated his throne and become a turncoat.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sanford Wallace _ the self-anointed ``Spamford,'' who claimed to
make millions of dollars peddling unsolicited commercial e-mail but
angered millions of Internet users in the process _ says he is
ditching the industry he pioneered and will testify against
spammers in court in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a wonderful twist of fate,'' said Wallace, who once
boasted of being the world's biggest junk e-mailer.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace vows he will speak out against spammers as an expert
witness in lawsuits against the junk e-mailers. He will work for
the same law firm that in March won a $2 million lawsuit against
him on behalf of Internet service provider EarthLink Network Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is Sanford's penance,'' said Pete Wellborn, the
Atlanta-based attorney for EarthLink. ``His knowledge of e-mail
practices and the Internet is so vast that I can think of no one
I'd rather have as my technical consultant.''
</P>
<P>
   Many observers contend that Wallace and his company, Cyber
Promotions Inc., were forced out of business by an avalanche of
litigation. At least five ISPs, including America Online,
CompuServe and Concentric Network, have successfully sued Cyber
Promotions in recent years to evict it from their sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``The legal climate makes it much more difficult to be a
spammer,'' said Randall Boe, AOL's associate general counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace's defection underscores a growing nationwide crackdown
on unsolicited commercial e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Congress is considering at least four bills that would either
ban or restrict spam; ISPs are suing junk e-mailers at a furious
clip; and Internet services are offering software that lets
subscribers block unwanted e-mail from specific Internet addresses.
</P>
<P>
   That's because the Internet is being buried under the flurry of
an estimated 13 billion pieces of junk e-mail a year, most of which
tout sleazy sex ads, get-rich-quick schemes and miracle drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Since surfacing three years ago, spam has become so pervasive
that it is clogging up Internet pathways and individuals' e-mail
accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Cyber Promotions was among the most egregious offenders. The
privately owned company delivered millions of &UR;  &LR; pieces of junk
e-mail last year on behalf of clients hawking vitamin supplements,
luxurious vacations and health and beauty aids.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``We can only hope that Mr. Wallace disappears for good, but I
wouldn't bet on it,'' said Paul Hoffman, director of the Internet
Mail Consortium in Santa Cruz, which represents 30 companies,
including AOL, Microsoft and Netscape. ``He is the consummate
salesman who has a habit of resurfacing.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman and others assert that Wallace beat a hasty retreat
before anti-spam laws go into the books. Previously, Wallace was a
prolific sender of junk-mail faxes before legislation drove him
from that field.
</P>
<P>
   ``People on the Internet are not going to stand for spam,''
Wallace admitted in a recent interview. ``I will give back to the
Internet by spending time and effort to help clean up the
streets.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, the normally loquacious Wallace _ who has compared
himself to Madonna and Howard Stern _ isn't saying anything else.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; He is tight-lipped about his future plans in marketing, and
the status of Cyber Promotions is uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   The Dresher, Pa., company's phone numbers are either
disconnected or go unanswered.

ACTIVIST CALLS MCARTHUR FELLOWSHIP A `CHALLENGE GRANT' 
</HEADLINE>
   (ja)  
 By JOYCE WADLER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK_ It's bad manners to ask, but when you come across an
activist raised in Oyster Bay and educated in private school who
has devoted her entire working life to human rights, you can't help
but pose the question:
</P>
<P>
   Is there a private income?
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you kidding?'' Dorothy Thomas asks, practically hooting.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is Ms. Thomas, just named a recipient of a $245,000
MacArthur Fellowship for her work in women's rights, going to argue
that the award, paid out over five years at $49,000 a year before
taxes, is not very much money.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not gonna catch me saying that,'' said Ms. Thomas, the
sort of feminist who disdains makeup but is willing to joke about
it. ``To me it's like a challenge grant. No, you know what it is?
License to make a whole heap of trouble. I still can't believe I
got it. Saying I was completely flabbergasted would be the most
minimal way of putting it. I was blown away. I'm still in recovery
from the news.''
</P>
<P>
   The MacArthur Foundation awards grants to 20 to 30 people a year
for work that, in the words of the awards committee, ``helps foster
improvement in the human condition.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Thomas, 38, who has just begun a job as a consultant with
the Shaler-Adams Women's Human Rights Foundation, was the director
of the Women's Rights Project of Human Rights Watch for eight
years. She received her award for ``helping to redefine
international standards of human rights and making abuses against
women, including domestic violence, a matter of international human
rights law.'' Ms. Thomas investigated violence against women in
Brazil. She has edited reports, as she puts it, ``on every horrible
subject regarding the violations of women's rights you can
imagine.''
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps Ms. Thomas's most inventive work, which she hopes to
continue with the MacArthur grant, was using international law to
improve the rights of American women in prison. The United States,
Ms. Thomas said, is one of the few countries in which women are
guarded by men _ a system that frequently leads to sexual
exploitation and abuse. There were, however, U.N. resolutions,
which the United States has signed, that offered a way to apply
pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to use the U.N. to expose human rights abuse in the
U.S., which doesn't happen too often,'' Ms. Thomas said. ``We now
have an investigator from the U.N. looking into conditions in
American prisons. You don't usually think of U.N. officials coming
here. The United States has one of most active women's movements in
the world and it hasn't explored the use of international pressure.
To me it's a given that everything is going global.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Thomas lives in a sunny rental apartment in Chelsea with a
man she refers to as ``my companion.''
</P>
<P>
   Is the unmarried state a political comment on marriage or hasn't
the subject come up?
</P>
<P>
   ``It hasn't come up,'' Ms. Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of makeup?
</P>
<P>
   ``A family trait,'' said Ms. Thomas, whose parents divorced when
she was 3. ``I grew up in a feminist family. You know, women are
caught between reality and appearances. The reality is we're
second-class citizens. Let's change the reality: don't waste a lot
of time putting on makeup. My grandmother was a suffragette. She
was always saying, `You can't just be in the world. You have to
better the world.'''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Thomas graduated from Portledge, a private school in Locust
Valley, which her mother founded, then received bachelor's and
master's degrees from Georgetown University in literary theory and
women's studies. After college, she worked in the anti-apartheid
movement and lived in Namibia, monitoring its independence from
South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw people voting for the first time in their history,'' Ms.
Thomas said. ``But even in this incredibly visionary struggle,
women were almost invisible.''
</P>
<P>
   Concern for women's issues has dominated Ms. Thomas' life.
Though she has traveled to a half dozen countries and says she has
seen terrible things, she is uncomfortable telling the stories of
specific women _ even without using names _ because she fears it
will be exploitive.
</P>
<P>
   Pressed to shed some light on her work, she finally, after two
hours, tells the story of one woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three weeks after I graduated college, one of my best friends
was raped and murdered,'' Ms. Thomas said. ``Her body was found on
a bridle path in D.C. I think it devastated me, but it also
challenged me. It made me realize this is a problem affecting all
women, directly or indirectly, and I didn't want to live in a world
like that, where it could happen over and over again.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the 25th anniversary of the admission of women to
Georgetown University, I was invited to give the commencement
address,'' Ms. Thomas continued. ``I used it as an opportunity to
remember Catherine Schilling, my friend. To discuss, you know,
evil. To say, `It's not just out there. It's in here. My friend was
sitting exactly where you are sitting today and if you don't want
to live in the world where there is that kind of violence against
women, you're going to have to do something about it.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``That sort of violence can suck the meaning out of life,'' Ms.
Thomas said. ``For me, it was just the opposite. All of my activism
was a way to make that one act have some meaning.''

HOLOCAUST SURVIVORS SUE GERMAN BANKS OVER LOOTED GOLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (ja)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank, two large German
banks that the State Department revealed on Tuesday trafficked in
gold the Nazis stole from European Jews during World War II, were
sued Wednesday by three Holocaust survivors.
</P>
<P>
   One plaintiff, Harold Watman, 77, of Queens, said that his gold
teeth were pulled out of his mouth without anesthesia by Nazis at
Auschwitz, according to the suit filed in U.S. District Court in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The class action lawsuit is the first to expand claims by
Holocaust survivors seeking to recover looted gold beyond Swiss
banks.
</P>
<P>
   Dresdner Bank said it had not seen the suit and had no comment,
and Deutsche bank did not respond to messages Wednesday night.

IT'S THE NEWEST UNDERGROUND HIT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   To paraphrase James Brown, it's a worm's, worm's, worm's, worm's
world.
</P>
<P>
   In Godzilla, Matthew Broderick plays earthworm expert Dr. Niko
Tatopolous, known to his peers as ``the worm guy.'' Far Side
cartoonist Gary Larson just published ``There's a Hair in My Dirt!
A Worm's Story,'' a sort of worm fairy tale. Also on bookstands
now: ``The Worm Book: The Complete Guide to Gardening and
Composting With Worms.''
</P>
<P>
   What's up with worms, anyway? Just little things, like sex and
death, apparently.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can take the Jungian psychology point of view: Certain
shapes attract the eye,'' says Noreen Damude, nongame biologist for
the Texas Department of Parks and Wildlife. Damude, who says she
specializes in birds but answers ``all the critter questions,''
says that worms attract us ``for the same reasons snakes both
fascinate and fill us with fear and loathing at the same time.
There are archetypal shapes in nature that are attractive but give
us goose bumps on our back.''
</P>
<P>
   Um, that sorta takes care of the sex part, we guess. What about
death?
</P>
<P>
   ``They're symbols of death and mortality in that we turn to
dust, and worms are one of the major agents in our returning,''
Damude says. ``We arise from dust and we return to dust, and worms
speed up the process.''
</P>
<P>
   Uh, yuck. But really, worms are our friends. They keep the soil
fertile, and they're useful in catching fish. Here are some other
useful things to know about worms.
</P>
<P>
   What is a worm, anyway? According to the Encyclopedia Americana,
``worm'' is a general term for many unrelated animals with soft,
slender, elongated bodies lacking backbones (sort of like some
people we know). They range from 0.02 inches to more than 10 feet
long.
</P>
<P>
   Worms are big business. Among the many worm Web sites is one for
Magicord _ The Wonder Worm! (www.vermicentral.com/magicord.com),
reportedly the BEST fishing bait in the world. A case of 60
two-worm containers goes for $213. Another site is J&AMP;C's Dairy
Worms (no, you don't milk 'em, you use 'em in the soil) at
www.humboldt1.com/dairyworms. If you're really in the mood for
worms, you can buy 2,000 for $28 retail, plus shipping and
handling.
</P>
<P>
   Worms make words. Many words have wormy roots: vermicelli (from
the Italian for ``little worm''), vermin (from the Latin for
``worm''), vermouth (from the German word for ``wormwood'').
</P>
<P>
   Worms form phrases. Examples: ``can of worms,'' an unpleasant
problem; ``you worm,'' directed at a loathsome person; ``the worm
has turned,'' the situation has reversed; ``worm's-eye view,'' the
outlook from a close range but a menial position.
</P>
<P>
   Worms can be bad for you. You don't want a tapeworm in your
digestive tract, nor do you want your pet to have heartworms.
</P>
<P>
   Worms can be good for you. Leeches, which fall under the worm
umbrella, are especially useful in treating some hematomas.
Patients shocked by high medical bills have also been known to call
their doctors ``leeches.''
</P>
<P>
   Worms for dessert. You can have Gummi Worms straight up, or mix
them into chocolate pudding and crumbled Oreos for a dish called
Worms and Dirt.
</P>
<P>
   Worms in your beverages. If you drink tequila, you're not really
macho unless you eat the worm.
</P>
<P>
   People just love to play with worms. One of the most popular
video games is Earthworm Jim, which already has one sequel and
another due out soon. Worms 2 MicroProse is a CD-ROM game in which
you control an army of worms.
</P>
<P>
   Worms are cinematic. The best worm movie of all time is
undoubtedly ``Tremors,'' in which Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward play a
couple of not-too-bright guys leading a small desert town in a
battle against giant earthworms. Other worm movies: ``Squirm''
(1976), ``Lair of the White Worm'' (1988, based on a Bram Stoker
novel), and, of course, ``Tremors 2: Aftershocks'' (1996). Worms
also figured in ``Eraserhead'' and ``Dune,'' both directed by David
Lynch. Coincidence? We think not.
</P>
<P>
   Worms are literary. Bookworms might be familiar with Edgar Allan
Poe's ``The Conqueror Worm.''
</P>
<P>
   Worms are athletic. Cross-dressing, hair-dying basketball star
Dennis Rodman is known as ``The Worm.''
</P>
<P>
   Worms are musical. Danny Kaye sang ``Inchworm'' in the movie
``Hans Christian Andersen.'' The Mills Brothers had a hit with
``Glow Worm.'' But hold on a minute. ``Those are not worms, those
are butterfly larvae,'' Damude says. ``Just because it's called a
worm doesn't make it a worm. Glowworm is another word for firefly,
which is not a fly; it's a beetle.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, then, how about the Pink Floyd song ``Waiting for the
Worms,'' or the popular ditty Eat Worms: ``Nobody likes me,
everybody hates me, I'm gonna eat some worms.''

   CHINA-THREEGORGES _ Every day 18,000 Chinese mobilize to build
the most powerful _ and most disparaged _ hydroelectric dam in the
world. Each day they crunch more rocks, dig deeper pits, pour more
and more concrete for the edifice that within five years will
stretch 1.4 miles across the Yangtze River and create a mammoth
reservoir 370 miles long. With swells of national pride, some
Chinese call this dam the modern Great Wall. But it is not a place
that politically cautious visitors like President Clinton _ soon
due to spend nine days in China _ will come and admire as a new
national icon. (Kunstel/Albright, Cox News Service).

waiting for their future to happen. Their one-room storefront was
new, brimming with sundries from shampoo to socks. Their street was
new and five-story building perched on the hillside was new. The
problem for Li Damin and his wife was that no cars traveled the
street, no people strolled past to eye their wares. Few others had
moved in yet from the old town's shabby riverfront that in five
years will disappear under muddy water. (Kunstel/Albright, Cox News

   SIBERIA-COLA _ KRASNOYARSK, Russia _ A local beverage company in
the heart of Siberia has taken on Goliath, challenging the
production and marketing might of Coca-Cola. The Russian company,
Pikra, may have lost its senses, but not its sense of humor.
``Everyone knows it is a joke to go against Coca-Cola. So we called
ours `Crazy Cola,''' says the boss, Yevgenia Kuznetsova. Even
crazier, she adds, Crazy Cola is showing a profit a year after it
was introduced, finding a small niche in a domestic market
increasingly keen to buy Russian-made goods. Yet Coca-Cola's thirst

FTC TO PROPOSE LAWS TO PROTECT CHILDREN ONLINE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.)   (bl)  
 By AMY HARMON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Amid mounting public concern about the abuse of personal data in
an increasingly digital world, the Federal Trade Commission is
expected to censure the Internet industry Wednesday in a report to
Congress for doing virtually nothing to insure adequate consumer
privacy protection online.
</P>
<P>
   In a departure from the Clinton administration's hands-off
approach to the Internet, the agency will call for legislation that
would require sites on the World Wide Web to obtain parental
consent before collecting personal information from children,
according to the report. The FTC said it would make recommendations
on privacy for other Web users this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children are told by parents not to talk to strangers whom
they meet on the street, but they are given a contrary message by
Web sites that encourage them to interact with strangers in their
homes via the Web,'' the report says.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass., said, ``This is a historic
benchmark that changes forever the discussion of the protections
which children need in a cyberera.''
</P>
<P>
   In a study of 1,400 Web sites in March, the FTC found that 85
percent collect personal information but only 14 percent provide
any notice about what they do with the data. Only 2 percent provide
such notice with a comprehensive privacy policy, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those numbers are frightening,'' he said. ``If privacy
protections are not built into Internet commerce, then a vast
majority of Americans will never trust the Internet.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Although few had seen the long-anticipated report Wednesday,
news leaks about it added fuel to a heated debate among industry
leaders and privacy advocates about how to address privacy
concerns. Several companies and trade associations rushed to blunt
the effect of the report with announcements of new policies.
</P>
<P>
   Technology trade groups representing more than 10,000 companies
sent President Clinton a letter asking for a chance to allow
self-regulation work.
</P>
<P>
   And the Direct Marketing Association touted its own study, which
showed that 70 percent of the top 100 children's Web sites publish
a privacy policy. The group, which has lobbied against legislation,
said late Wednesday that it had adopted a new policy to seek
parental consent for online marketing involving children younger
than 13.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is business stepping up to the plate, moving in the
direction that it needs to, and that is how self-regulation
works,'' said Connie Heatley, senior vice president of the
association.
</P>
<P>
   For many companies trying to do business on the Internet, the
entire promise of the medium rests on the ease with which it allows
the collection of information for focusing advertising and
marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Based on forms that consumers fill out when they first visit a
site, or on simply tracking which areas of a site they visit most
frequently, Web site owners can, for example, determine which
advertisements to show them.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's not customized and personalized, it might as well be
television,'' said David Card, a senior analyst at Jupiter
Communications, an online consulting operation in New York. ``I'm
nervous that we'll get stuck with a law that would eliminate the
technical ability to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, consumers have continually expressed fears about what
happens to information that they provide in cyberspace. Anxiety
about the use of of medical and financial information online is one
of the top reasons people do not use the Internet, according to
several recent polls.
</P>
<P>
   And some companies have decided that electronic commerce would
be more helped than hurt by ending such practices.
</P>
<P>
   America Online, which has been much-criticized for privacy
lapses, said Wednesday that it would not use the information that
it gathers about what members do online for any marketing purposes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This can be extremely valuable information in the
marketplace,'' said Jill Lesser, AOL's deputy director for law and
public policy. ``The ability to target consumers is extremely
valuable. But you have to strike a balance.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lesser added: ``It's hard to fault the FTC for calling a
spade a spade. Hopefully this will be a catalyst for companies to
look at privacy protection as a business imperative.''
</P>
<P>
   But government action is needed, privacy advocates said, because
children have never been more more vulnerable to commercial
exploitation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're creating a new children's culture, and if we don't set
ground rules for how that's done, we could see a whole set of very
egregious, manipulative practices that could do a lot of harm to
kids,'' said Kathryn C. Montgomery, president of the Center for
Media Education, a child advocacy group. ``And this new culture
could turn toxic.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem with many sites aimed at children is that they make
divulging information seem like a game, Ms. Montgomery said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the Popsicle Web site, published by the Good
Humor-Breyers Ice Cream unit of Unilever, asks children to choose
whether they want to be commanders or passengers. Just one catch:
Commanders have to fill out their age, sex, favorite TV show and
favorite popsicle before blasting off.
</P>
<P>
   And in case anyone was inclined to just go along for the ride,
the passenger option cautions, ``Sure, you can ride in the big
stuffed chair, but you'll miss out on the chance to win free
Popsicles. Plus it's really cold in outer space without a
Spaceship. Why not be a commander?''
</P>
<P>
   Popsicle's privacy policy says that it does not release the data
it gathers to third parties.

 Forbes Exec Rose From Dust Of Rivals   By Tom Abate  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
Behind Rich Karlgaard's annointment as publisher of Forbes magazine
lies a dramatic comeback story.
<TEXT>
<P>
   It involves Karlgaard and two former partners turned
competitors: fellow magazine publishers Tony Perkins of Red Herring
and David Bunnell of Upside.
</P>
<P>
   The story begins in 1989 when Karlgaard, then a humble technical
writer, and Perkins, an ambitious ex-banker, decided to found a
magazine about Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Though short on money and publishing experience, they had
already made many friends in the valley by founding the Churchill
Club, San Jose's answer to San Francisco's Commonwealth.
</P>
<P>
   With Perkins handling sales and Karlgaard driving editorial,
they gave birth to Upside. A few investors _ led by Perkins's
lifelong pal, venture capitalist Tim Draper _ bankrolled this
quixotic effort.
</P>
<P>
   But, undercapitalized from the start, by 1992 Upside was
scrambling to meet payroll. At that point, Bunnell joined Upside's
board of directors to help turn around the flailing magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Already a computer publishing legend, Bunnell had helped launch
a string of successful magazines, including Macworld. But after
Bunnell joined Upside's board, the two founders were eventually
eased out and Bunnell slowly tightened his grip on Upside, which he
has nursed back to profit and prominence.
</P>
<P>
   Karlgaard emerged from the Upside putsch better off. By 1992 he
had befriended futurist George Gilder, whose ideas had bedazzled
magazine magnate Steve Forbes. To create an editorial pulpit for
Gilder, Forbes hired Karlgaard to edit Forbes ASAP, the bimonthly
tech magazine that turned out to be Karlgaard's steppingstone to
Forbes magazine.
</P>
<P>
   While Karlgaard's star was ascending, Perkins was sliding into a
personal and professional slump. Nonetheless, within in a year
Perkins created the Red Herring. With financial backing from
co-founder Chris Alden, he has spent the last five years making the
Herring a force in the valley _ and vindicating himself.
</P>
<P>
   Karlgaard said there was a time when he and Perkins ``were both
mad at each other and certain people on the (Upside) board.'' Since
then, he and Perkins have patched it up.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real story here,'' Karlgaard said, looking back on the
Upside days, ``is that out of that one troubled kernel, three
successful magazines have sprung up.''
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; F.Y.I. &LR;  This fall, Upside will move from San Mateo to San
Francisco, taking a floor in the same building on 731 Market Street
that houses Mother Jones.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; 3Com Spin: &LR;  Sources close to 3Com ridicule the notion that the
company's decision to hire a second in command signals any loss of
faith in Eric Benhamou, the company's chairman, president and CEO.
</P>
<P>
   The hunt for a new president and COO, being conducted by Spencer
Stuart, has so far turned up three possible candidates _ all from
outside the networking industry.
</P>
<P>
   Benhamou recently got the supreme compliment from Cisco CEO John
Chambers, who told reporters that when headhunters phone him, ``I
send them over to Eric. I want somebody to hire that guy out of my
industry.''
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; New dimension: &LR;  Intervista, the San Francisco startup that
pioneered 3D browsers for the Internet, will be acquired by
Platinum Technology, an Ohio corporate-software firm.
</P>
<P>
   The deal will be announced any day. 3D guru and company founder
Tony Parisi will be among the 28 Intervistites who will don
Platinum name tags. But Intervista President John Lukrich, who
engineered the deal, will supposedly leave to explore new pastures.
</P>
<P>
   The deal highlights the fact that 3D, once heralded as the next
big thing on the Web, is still a ways off. In April, Silicon
Graphics announced plans to spin off _ or disband _ its 120-person
3D effort called Cosmo.
</P>

FINANCIAL SERVICES FIRMS HAVE KEY ROLE AT RETIREMENT FORUM
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When President Clinton addresses ``The National
Summit on Retirement Savings'' Thursday, few will take issue with
the thrust of his remarks: that Americans should save more for
their golden years or risk a drop in living standards when they
retire.
</P>
<P>
   But some people are asking why the message is being delivered in
a forum that is heavily stocked with, and partly funded by,
financial services firms that have a business interest in the
savings habits of Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Through a law passed last year, Congress created the summit as a
``public-private partnership'' to find ways to encourage Americans
to save more for retirement. Two hundred delegates, chosen by the
White House and Congress, will discuss the topic with lawmakers and
federal officials. They meet at a Washington hotel Thursday and
tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   At least a quarter of the appointed delegates come from stock
brokerages, money-management firms, insurers, or similar companies
and trade groups, giving financial services firms the largest
portion of delegates. That compares with 16 delegates from labor
unions and employee trade groups.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, most of the funding for the summit comes indirectly
from Boston's Fidelity Investments and State Street Corp., as well
as other investment firms.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were hoping to see a larger number of people representing
middle-income working families and the poor, who have little access
to retirement savings vehicles, instead of people who would profit
tremendously from increased retirement savings,'' said Thomas
Matzzie of the Institute for America's Future, a union-allied group
focusing on wage and job security issues that is not attending the
summit.
</P>
<P>
   US Representative Harris Fawell, the Illinois Republican who
sponsored the bill creating the summit, said he hoped some of the
discussion would focus on tax law changes that would encourage
people to save more. ``We've got more than 200 experts from the
front lines coming to Washington, and now they've got the ear of
the president and the Department of Labor,'' Fawell said.
</P>
<P>
   But that troubles the groups representing workers, which say the
government should not undertake the discussion in a forum so
heavily weighted with business groups. They fear business groups
will use it to build support for such tax changes as higher limits
on 401(k) donations, which, in their view, cause the government to
give up tax revenue so wealthier Americans can save money tax free.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, they worry businesses will use the summit to build
support for eliminating ``nondiscrimination rules,'' which link a
company's success in persuading lower-income workers to save in
401(k) plans to its ability to allow higher-income workers to save
in the tax-deferred plans.
</P>
<P>
   They also fear that the ``save more'' message, while sounding
innocuous, will hasten a shift in the retirement burden onto
workers and away from traditional corporate pension plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Employers telling workers to save for themselves is a cover
for them to cut costs,'' said Karen Ferguson, director of the
Pension Rights Center in Washington and a delegate to the summit.
``When an employer stops its traditional pension or substitutes a
401(k), it's a pay cut for workers and a cost savings for the
employer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's hardly anybody lobbying for pensions for the average
worker,'' said Cindy Hounsell of the Women's Institute for a Secure
Retirement, referring to the delegate list, which includes her.
</P>
<P>
   Fawell said the delegates include ``a good cross-section'' of
groups involved with the retirement system. In addition to
financial services firms and labor unions, delegates come from
universities, think tanks, federal and state government, large and
small employers, and seniors groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're bound to have some people there who are in the
investment business, but that's OK,'' Fawell said. ``If you're
going to get some good hints about how to educate people on this,
we have to have people who are on the front lines tell us.''
</P>
<P>
   Financial services firms are indirectly covering much of the
cost of the summit, a move that has also drawn criticism.
</P>
<P>
   In the law creating the summit, which also called for similar
events in 2001 and 2005, Congress gave the Department of Labor
$250,000 to set up this year's event. It told the department to
find a private sector partner to pay the rest of the bill and to
help with preparations.
</P>
<P>
   That group is the American Savings Education Council, a
nonprofit educational organization founded in 1995 to promote
retirement savings. It does not take positions on public policy
issues.
</P>
<P>
   The council has a wide membership, including labor unions,
government agencies, and universities, but 75 percent of its
funding comes from 12 ``charter partners.''
</P>
<P>
   Nine of those partners are financial services firms or trade
groups representing companies in the industry. They include
Fidelity Investments and State Street Corp. of Boston, as well as
the Investment Company Institute, American Express Co., and
Prudential Investments.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Congress wants to do this (summit), why do it with what I
call `charged' or `loaded' money?'' asked Bill Hogan of the Center
for Public Integrity, a nonprofit Washington group that studies
money and ethics in politics. ``This is not disinterested money.''
</P>
<P>
   Hogan said the use of private firm money ``puts the Labor
Department in a bad position'' of potentially owing a favor to one
of the firms that helped fund the summit.
</P>
<P>
   Fawell said his bill called for private funding to help overcome
objections from the Clinton administration, which was ``initially
resistant'' to spending money on the summit.
</P>
<P>
   Don M. Blandin, president of the savings council, said his group
would probably end up covering about 70 percent of the cost of the
summit, which could top $800,000 overall.
</P>
<P>
   ``To say this is a plot by financial institutions is a bit of a
stretch,'' Blandin said. It was Congress and the president that
required a private-sector partner for the summit, and the Labor
Department asked the council to submit a proposal for running the
event, he said. He said the agenda and panelists were chosen by the
White House and Congress, not by the council or its corporate
sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   Blandin acknowledged that companies like Fidelity and American
Express might ``see it in their interest to make sure Americans
save and invest, and they're going to get a piece of that pie.''
But their support for the summit is ``general underwriting and in
an education mode that is not product-oriented,'' he said.

 Xerox vows to profit from marketing mistakes   By Jamie Beckett  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
Xerox PARC, a fabled research center in the hills above Palo Alto,
is best known for its fumbles.
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARC (Palo Alto Research Center) pioneered the personal
computer, the point-and-click graphical user interface, the laser
printer and Ethernet _ but it never capitalized on them.
</P>
<P>
   While ideas languished in the copier giant's bureaucracy,
inventions from Xerox PARC helped spawn companies like Apple
Computer, 3Com and Adobe Systems. Adobe and 3Com were founded by
PARC veterans, and Apple's Macintosh computer was inspired by a
tour of PARC Steve Jobs took in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Now Xerox is making sure that doesn't happen again. These days,
it is spinning off PARC's hot technologies into startup companies _
and reaping huge returns when it takes the companies public.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with Xerox's persona as ``the document company'' (a
focus PARC helped coin), most of the startups specialize in
documents _ organizing, displaying, storing and manipulating them.
</P>
<P>
   Overseeing the spin-offs is an arm of Xerox called Xerox New
Enterprises (XNE). Created in 1996, it allocates seed money and
provides technical, business and marketing advice. It grew out of a
venture-capital fund Xerox founded in 1988, after it was stung by
criticism in ``Fumbling the Future: How Xerox Invented, then
Ignored, the First Personal Computer.''
</P>
<P>
   The book details how Xerox executives were too busy fighting
threats to the company's copier business to realize what was
happening at PARC _ a continent away from Xerox's headquarters in
Stamford, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   The XNE firms combine the strengths _ versatility and speed _ of
startups with the clout and resources of a Fortune 100 company.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to mimic the clock rate of startups, independent
critters that move fast, forage quickly and survive,'' said Ramana
Rao, chief technology officer of Inxight, one of the spin-offs.
</P>
<P>
   Xerox initially owns 80 percent of the XNE firms; the remainder
goes to the employees over time, giving them strong financial
incentives.
</P>
<P>
   XNE now has eight companies under its stewardship, generating
some $800 million in annual revenues. (Nearly half comes from Xerox
Engineering Systems, an existing unit that was folded into XNE last
year.)
</P>
<P>
   But added revenues for Xerox are just part of the equation _
XNE's $800 million contributes only about 4 percent to the copier
giant's $18 billion in annual revenues.
</P>
<P>
   ``We develop a lot more technology than we can ever use in our
main business,'' said Colin O'Brien, chief executive of XNE.
Before, innovations like the Alto _ the first personal computer in
1973 _ had no place inside Xerox. With XNE, Xerox has a way to
capitalize on those technologies, developing them into marketable
products, O'Brien said.
</P>
<P>
   XNE as a whole is currently losing money, O'Brien said, but he
expects it to move into the black next year, when he plans to take
the remaining businesses public.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts are optimistic that the changes at PARC will eventually
show up on Xerox's bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  ``Xerox has moved from a company that fumbled one of the
great franchises in American history to one of the best companies
in its class,'' said Alex Henderson, who follows Xerox for
Prudential Securities. ``They're doing a great job of getting their
technology out front.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Kunstler, who follows Xerox for J.P. Morgan Securities,
said that Xerox is ``determined to get this work (at PARC)
commercialized.'' But PARC has changed, too, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a much more entrepreneurial environment. The place is
much more disciplined about getting its technology patented than it
was before,'' Kunstler said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Nestled in the hills overlooking Silicon Valley, PARC is home
to a collection of &UR;  &LR; would-be entrepreneurs at the XNE companies, as
well as 300 PARC researchers from such wide-ranging disciplines as
psychology, physics, mathematics and graphic design.
</P>
<P>
   Potential XNE companies first get help from business development
experts who work with the scientists to prepare a business
proposal. That proposal is presented to the seven-member Corporate
Innovation Council, which evaluates the project's market potential.
About one-third of proposals get seed money _ ranging from $300,000
to $1.5 million _ to conduct market research. The rest are shut
down.
</P>
<P>
   After the market research is complete, the board has three
choices. If the project is inappropriate for Xerox, the board can
spin it off to venture capitalists. If it's related to Xerox
business but doesn't fit into an existing business unit, it could
become an XNE company. Or the board may assign the project to a
compatible Xerox business division.
</P>
<P>
   One such PARC project, a ``blue laser,'' is being used to
develop what Xerox hopes will be a new printer that produces even
sharper and more vivid images than current laser printers. Much of
the technology in Xerox's digital printers and copiers _ which last
year comprised 36 percent of the company's revenues _ originally
came from PARC.
</P>
<P>
   John Seely Brown, PARC's chief scientist and director, said his
goal is to ``shape technology to people.'' He wants to make using
computers easier and more natural so that people can think about
the work they're doing instead of their PCs.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at a document, you never think about what
application made it,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   With its spread-out campus and lush green lawns, PARC looks much
like a college campus. But it has the feel of a top-secret research
lab. Visitors need a badge _ a different one for each building _
and an escort. Even then, most of the labs are protected by several
sets of combination-lock doors.
</P>
<P>
   These days, says Brown, PARC is paying its own way _ as well as
paving the way for some exciting new technologies.
</P>
<P>
   `The money we made from just one (PARC) invention last year (the
high-end Docutech printer) covered the entire cost of PARC for its
entire history,'' he said. ``But if that's all we did, it wouldn't
be all that interesting.''

AIR FORCE FIGHTER FLYBY IS ULTIMATE MILITARY HONOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By VANESSA DERUYTER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ The Air Force fighter flyover that thrilled onlookers
at Barry Goldwater's memorial service represents the ultimate
military tribute for an American patriot.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Wednesday's ``Missing Man'' formation led by Lt. Wade May
and performed by the 62nd fighter squadron was unusual, Pentagon
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The formation, in which one F-16 jet departs from a four-ship
formation up into the sky, symbolizes the loss of a fallen airman.
</P>
<P>
   Flyovers are typically performed by Air Force pilots during the
funeral services of four-star generals and military personnel who
die in active duty, said 1st Lt. Barry Spencer.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force granted a flyover for Goldwater, who retired in
1967 as major general in the U.S. Air Force Reserve, out of
respect.
</P>
<P>
   The flyover service ``was a tribute to an Air Force officer and
patriot,'' said Maj. Eric Schnaible at the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   Family members of a deceased pilot can make a formal request for
a flyover in writing. The person considered the next of kin must
write the request.
</P>
<P>
   The request, along with a biography of the deceased and proof of
military services, is sent to Texas, which forwards the materials
to the Pentagon for review. The Air Force Chief of Staff then
decides whether to approve or decline the request.
</P>
<P>
   Schnaible said to qualify for a flyover, the individual must
have served in the military, but the Air Force makes some
exceptions for public officials.
</P>
<P>
   According to Pentagon records, the formation originated prior to
1935 from the British Royal Air Force, which used it upon returning
from a mission to tell ground officials how many losses were
suffered.
</P>
<P>
   The ceremony was used in 1935 during a review by King George V
and eventually evolved into a traditional part of RAF ceremonies
during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The first recorded American use of the flyover was in 1938
during the burial of Maj. Gen. Oscar Westover, Army Air Corps Chief
of Staff.
</P>
<P>
   Today, flyovers are sometimes allowed during other ceremonies,
such as during the anniversary of Pearl Harbor and other patriotic
holidays.
</P>
<P>
   ``The formation is a solemn tribute, so (the Air Force) is
careful to limit the number of events it is used for,'' said
Schnaible. &QL;

SEVENTH DEATH REPORTED OF MEN TAKING ANTI-IMPOTENCE DRUG
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DOLORES KONG AND RIC KAHN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The state medical examiner is investigating the death Sunday of
a man who had reportedly taken the new impotence drug Viagra,
according to sources at Massachusetts General Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   If confirmed, the death of the Cambridge man at MGH would be the
seventh reported death of a Viagra user in the United States.
According to the US Food and Drug Administration, three of the
deaths involved men who were taking heart medication at the same
time despite product warnings, while the others involved men age 60
and over for whom there was no known history of heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew McCormick, spokesman for Pfizer Inc., maker of Viagra,
said yesterday that the company has not received any reports of
deaths in Massachusetts. ``It's possible it happened,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Such reports of possible adverse drug reactions are not required
to be made to the manufacturer, although any reports the company
gets must be forwarded to the FDA. By law, the federal agency
cannot reveal identifying details such as a patient's name or state
of residence.
</P>
<P>
   Both the FDA and Pfizer emphasized that none of the reports so
far have prompted any change in the drug's safety profile. Since
the drug was approved by the FDA in March for the treatment of male
impotence, or erectile dysfunction, 1.5 million prescriptions have
been written for Viagra.
</P>
<P>
   The product label already warns that patients taking any
nitrates, including nitroglycerin and long-acting nitrates for
chest pain, should not take Viagra, said McCormick.
</P>
<P>
   The label also warns older patients with poor health, whether or
not they are taking nitrates, to consult with a physician before
taking the drug and having sex, he said, adding that 85 percent of
the prescriptions written to date are for men over age 50.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sexual intercourse is a form of physical exertion,'' said
McCormick. ``We have been advising patients with a cardiovascular
history to discuss this closely with their physician.''
</P>
<P>
   MGH sources said the Cambridge man, who was said to be in his
50s, died in the emergency room at 3 a.m. Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Viagra, or sildenafil citrate, is the first pill to treat
impotence, which affects millions of US men. The drug does not
directly cause erections, but enhances muscle relaxation, thus
allowing increased blood flow into the penis, leading to an
erection.
</P>
<P>
   The drug, evaluated in studies involving about 3,000 men with
impotence associated with diabetes, spinal cord injury, history of
prostate surgery, and no identifiable cause of impotence, was
approved less than six months after submission to the FDA.

 &HT;    Priests offer comfort for wounded parishoners
 &HT;    By Dan Moffett and Tim Pallesen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. Priests throughout the Diocese of Palm
Beach went to their pulpits Wednesday and tried to comfort
parishioners reeling from pain and disillusionment.
</P>
<P>
   Their bishop, J. Keith Symons, resigned Tuesday in disgrace. Now
they looked toward the altar for solace.
</P>
<P>
   Monsignor Thomas Klinzing celebrated the 8:30 a.m. Mass at St.
Ignatius Loyola Catholic Cathedral in Palm Beach Gardens and
appealed for prayers so healing can begin.
</P>
<P>
   ``The shock has almost worn off,'' he said before Mass, telling
the faithful to expect sorrow, followed by hurt and healing.
</P>
<P>
   After the service, Klinzing returned for informal questions and
answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You must remember that no one knew anything about this
sickness 35 years ago,'' he said. ``Please talk to your children.
We can't say there aren't any more victims, but we pray that there
are not.''
</P>
<P>
   Klinzing said he and other priests were concerned by the
bishop's behavior during Mass last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very confused on Sunday. The priests said, `He's not
making any sense,' '' Klinzing recalled, saying he sensed something
was wrong. Priests received the unhappy news of Symons' resignation
at a meeting called by Klinzing at 9:50 a.m. Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   `He needs our prayers,'' he said. ``The poor man is in
trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Klinzing expressed worry that St. Ignatius just committed to a
new construction program by signing a contract with the architect
Friday. The bishop was to play a key role in raising money for the
project, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Klinzing also told the congregation that priests at St. Ignatius
will examine youth programs where they interact with boys in the
parish.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will have to draw back a bit,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At Our Lady of Florida Spiritual Center in North Palm Beach, the
Rev. Damian Towey, retreat leader at the center, celebrated Mass
and, in something less than a sermon, addressed the bishop's
resignation.
</P>
<P>
   He quoted Jesus Christ to the 50 people who attended: ``Judge
not, condemn not.'' Towey put his emphasis on reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forgiveness and reconciliation are the supreme gifts Jesus
left the church,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Don Smith of Juno Beach offered a metaphor: ``Since the apple
was bit, imperfection was invented.''
</P>
<P>
   Carol Pecoraro of North Palm Beach was concerned for those who
are hurting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel sad for the children,'' she said. ``Then, I feel sad
for the bishop. Each one of us has to look deep in our soul and
find a merciful God. I think I think we can find healing.''
</P>
<P>
   Parishioners who attended evening Mass at St. Vincent Ferrer
Catholic Church in Delray Beach said the misconduct wouldn't affect
their faith or push them away from the church.
</P>
<P>
   ``The church is divine and it is human. The human part fails,''
said Eileen Stull.
</P>
<P>
   Others said once he was confronted, it must have taken courage
for the bishop to admit his sin.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of us is infallible. We're a family. Just because one
person in a family doesn't behave appropriately, it doesn't
diminish the value of the family,'' said Elizabeth Brinkman, a
Delray Beach resident who attends St. Vincent.

the president of Harvard University, stands among the portraits and
busts of famous Harvard alumni. Since taking over in 1991,
Rudenstine has guided a remarkably successful fund-raising drive.
But critics say he's such a nice guy that he doesn't like to say no
- especially to the powerful deans of Harvard's 12 schools.

 &HT;    Symons' case highlights Catholic Church's denial, critics say
 &HT;    By Dan Moffett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- After admitting he molested a child,
Bishop J. Keith Symons began a monthlong schedule that was very
busy and very public.
</P>
<P>
   He spoke at the graduation commencement ceremonies of three
Catholic high schools.
</P>
<P>
   He ordained several priests.
</P>
<P>
   He celebrated Mass and dispensed communion.
</P>
<P>
   Last Sunday, he gave the sacrament of confirmation to 163 of the
faithful at St. Ignatius Cathedral in Palm Beach Gardens.
</P>
<P>
   All this while the church hierarchy was working out his removal
and pressing him to give the names of all the youths he had abused.
The night before the confirmation service, Symons admitted there
were four more victims, five in all.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the bishop went through with his holy duties the next day.
</P>
<P>
   ``This shows both the arrogance of the bishop and the arrogance
of the Catholic church,'' said the Rev. Tom Economos, president of
Linkup, a Chicago-based support network for clergy abuse victims.
``What does this do to the people he administered sacraments to?
Absolutely the minute he admitted this, he should have stepped
down. To continue the farce and charade is terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   Bishop Robert N. Lynch, who was named Tuesday as the Palm Beach
diocese's temporary leader, said Symons was permitted to continue
his duties until Pope John Paul II accepted his resignation and
approved his removal. The church acted expeditiously to deal with
the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Holy See (Vatican) usually moves glacially but in this
case moved fast,'' he said. ``We're doing everything we can to help
our church regain its equilibrium and begin to heal.''
</P>
<P>
   But critics claim this is another example of the church's
insensitivity to victims and the double standard it allows its
clergy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a chance to send a powerful signal,'' said David
Clohessy, national president of SNAP (Survivors Network of Those
Abused by Priests). ``The prudent thing to do would have been to
remove him immediately. But again the church missed the opportunity
to do the right thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Church officials said Wedneday that Symons is beginning
psychological treatment at an undisclosed location and won't be
sent to the St. Luke's center in Suitland, Md., where many
pedophiliac priests have been treated.
</P>
<P>
   Symons' eight-year tenure as bishop of the Palm Beach diocese _
which includes Palm Beach, Martin, St. Lucie, Indian River and
Okeechobee counties _ ended five weeks after a victim came forward
and told church officials he was molested some 40 years ago. Symons
subsequently admitted molesting four others. All are believed to be
altar boys.
</P>
<P>
   This was not the first time he had come forward with the
problem, Lynch said. After several years of abusing boys decades
ago, Symons told a spiritual counselor of his addiction. Bound to
keep his confessor's admissions secret, he told Symons to be chaste
and avoid alcohol, according to Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   Economus says that after suffering the anguish of sexual abuse,
victims find that the church still doesn't reach out to them and
the court system doesn't give them a fair hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The statute of limitations really is a shelter that works to
the advantage of the dioceses,'' he said. ``In most states, the
window of opportunity for taking legal action is two to three
years. Most victims suffer in secrecy for much longer than that,
then find it difficult to make cases.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Anderson is a St. Paul, Minn., attorney who has sued the
Catholic church in 36 states, most notably in the case of James
Porter, the Massachusetts priest who pleaded guilty in 1993 to
molesting 36 children.
</P>
<P>
   ``The laws have not recognized the exceptional phenomenon of
victims of abuse,'' Anderson said. ``They have kept the doors
closed.''
</P>
<P>
   Gradually, states have changed their laws to allow delayed
discovery actions where abuses can be considered by the courts many
years after the fact.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Florida has not been a state that historically has been
receptive to this,'' Anderson said. ``Legislatures have not done
enough to remove statute of limitations barriers.''
</P>
<P>
   In Florida, most abuse charges can't be acted upon more than
four years after the incidents occurred. Steve Rubino, a Cherry
Hill, N.J. attorney who has sued the church over abuse cases in
numerous jurisdictions, said the nature of religious faith is
itself an obstacle.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is great fear from the religious point of view in
accusing a priest or a diocese,'' Rubino said. ``That is something
that seems terribly wrong to do if you are a devout Catholic. It
goes against everything you are taught.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubino successfully has used this premise to have the statute of
limitations dismissed in some cases.
</P>
<P>
   The consensus among lawyers who have taken on the church is that
they've tangled with a powerful adversary.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are formidable, and they continue to live in denial, in
part because they have never been made accountable in our court
system,'' Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
   Said Rubino: ``The Catholic church has virtually inexhaustible
resources and uses them as it needs.''
</P>
<P>
   Linkup's Economus says his group has names of 3,800 priests who
have been accused of abuse, a number church officials say is
greatly inflated. But they concede that 148 priests are behind bars
or have served time on abuse charges. The church is believed to
have paid close to $800 million in settlements, judgments and
therapy costs.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, a Dallas jury awarded 11 plaintiffs $119.6 million
after finding the diocese there negligent in its response to a
pedophile priest. That award, the highest ever in clergy abuse
cases, triggered a new wave of actions by victims. It also steeled
the resolve of the church to defend itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bishops are so petrified they will be the next Dallas, they
shove the problem off to the church attorney,'' Clohessy said.
``They put all their pastoral instincts on the shelf and say
they're letting their experts handle it. This is much more than a
legal problem. I can count on my hand the number of bishops who
have done the right thing.

PERSONAL ATTACKS MARK START OF ALABAMA RUNOFF CAMPAIGN 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By KEVIN SACK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTGOMERY, Ala. _ After forcing Gov. Fob James Jr. into a
runoff in the Republican gubernatorial primary on Tuesday, Winton
Blount III Wednesday cast his coming four-week duel with James as a
chance for Alabama to stop electing leaders who ``continually
embarrass us.''
</P>
<P>
   Several hours later, James rose to the bait in a news conference
performance that Blount will undoubtedly use to illustrate his
point. In essence, the governor responded by saying that Blount is
fat.
</P>
<P>
   Blount, a wealthy and, yes, portly businessman, had backed up
his criticism of James by recalling moments like the governor's
threat to call out the National Guard in support of a judge's
insistence on posting the Ten Commandments in his courtroom. He
also referred to the day several years ago when James mocked the
theory of evolution at a state school board meeting by ``walking
across the stage like a monkey,'' with his shoulders hunched and
arms hanging limply in front of him.
</P>
<P>
   And so when James, a former college football star who made a
fortune in the barbell business, was asked at a news conference to
respond to Blount, he said: ``Well, I'm a monkey that's in good
shape. I'm not a fat monkey.''
</P>
<P>
   James was asked whether he was saying that Blount was fat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I leave that to you,'' the governor replied, ``but if he says
I'm a monkey, I'm not a fat monkey and I'm not a monkey whose daddy
has put $2.5 million in my campaign, either. Make of that what you
want to. If he says I'm a monkey, I must say: `Well, I'm a pretty
slim monkey. I'm not a fat monkey.'''
</P>
<P>
   James' comments were not the first references to Blount's
physique made Wednesday by a member of Alabama's first family.
Early Wednesday morning James' wife, Bobbie, told reporters for The
Birmingham News and The New York Times Regional Newspaper Group
that she did not care for Blount's attacks on her family's
ownership of a landfill that has received some business from the
state. ``He's a big, fat sissy,'' she told the reporters.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday the Blount campaign manager, Sonny Scott, said his
first instinct was to laugh at James' remarks.
</P>
<P>
   ``But then you realize that this is the governor,'' Scott said.
``Governing is supposed to be serious.''
</P>
<P>
   James, whose fervid support for school prayer has made him both
a conservative icon and an object of derision, finished first in a
five-candidate field on Tuesday, but failed to win the majority
needed to avoid a runoff. He took 48 percent of the vote, while
Blount got 41 percent. Former Gov. Guy Hunt, who decided to run
after being pardoned from the state ethics conviction that forced
his resignation in 1993, finished third, with 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican primary has been depicted by James' strategists
and by national leaders of the Christian conservative movement as
an important electoral test for the religious right. Until the June
30 runoff, at least, the test remains inconclusive.
</P>
<P>
   In the Democratic primary, Lt. Gov. Don Siegelman easily
defeated his top rival, Lenora Pate, a Birmingham lawyer, by
winning 78 percent of the vote. Siegelman enters the general
election with more than $3.5 million in his campaign treasury and
the luxury of watching his Republican rivals attack each other for
another month.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Tuesday's primary, while posing the potential to divide
Republicans in November, proved a landmark for the party in
Alabama. The statewide Republican primary turnout of 358,757
shattered the record of 215,046, set in 1996. For the first time,
Republican turnout exceeded Democratic turnout, although by only
1,420 votes.
</P>
<P>
   James, 63, attributed his runoff to the growing pains of a newly
vigorous party. He said he had prevailed in primary runoffs in both
of his successful races for governor, one as a Democrat, and would
do so again. He urged voters to focus on the state's low
unemployment rate, his pledge to reject tax increases and his
efforts to improve schools.
</P>
<P>
   Blount, 54, whose campaign has received $2.5 million in loans
from himself and various family members, clearly hopes to make the
runoff a referendum on James. Like many business leaders in the
state, he argued that James' provocative positions on school prayer
and his pitched battles against the federal courts had damaged the
state's reputation and handicapped its economic development
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of James' recent assertion that the Bill of Rights does
not apply to the states, Blount said, ``These are things that bring
up images of the past that just aren't as good as we are as a
state.''
</P>
<P>
   But James defended his leadership style. ``I think he's out to
lunch on that,'' the governor said of Blount. ``I think my behavior
is every bit a gentleman.''
</P>
<P>
   Iowans Pick Nominees for Governor
</P>
<P>
   Jim Ross Lightfoot, the most conservative of three Republicans
vying to succeed Gov. Terry Branstad of Iowa, easily won his
party's nomination in a primary on Tuesday. State Sen. Tom Vilsack,
the more liberal of two Democrats, won as well, and will oppose him
in November.

   Branstad, the nation's longest-serving governor, is retiring
after four four-year terms. Democrats have not held the governor's
mansion in Iowa for 30 years, and analysts say the Republicans once
again go into the fall with big advantages, including Branstad's
continuing popularity.
</P>
<P>
   In the Democratic primary for governor in New Mexico, Martin
Chavez, a former mayor of Albuquerque, topped a field of six to win
a spot on November's ballot against the first-term incumbent
Republican, Gary Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Two House races in New Mexico drew national attention.
</P>
<P>
   In one, state attorney general Tom Udall, a nephew of former
Rep. Morris Udall, won a chance to carry his famous family name
back to Washington, winning the Democratic primary for the House
seat held by Rep. Bill Redmond, a Republican freshman.
</P>
<P>
   In the other, for the seat of Rep. Steven Schiff, a five-term
Republican who died in March, the primary winners were Heather
Wilson on the Republican side and state Sen. Phil Maloof on the
Democratic side.

NEW LEWINSKY LAWYERS OFFER STUDY IN POLISHED PROFESSIONALISM
</HEADLINE>
   (See also CLINTON-STARR-ASSESS) 
(sw) 
 By FRANCIS X. CLINES and ELAINE SCIOLINO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the instant celebrity shorthand of capital
power, it was ``Plato and Jake,'' as easy to remember as Mutt and
Jeff, who held this city's attention on Wednesday as they took up
the defense of Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Between them, Plato Cacheris and Jacob Stein have more than
eight decades of experience as leading courtroom lawyers to offer
Ms. Lewinsky, the former White House intern who is at the heart of
the criminal investigation of President Clinton's behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Between them, they present a dynamic of differing personality
traits, negotiating skills and courtroom cunning that friends in
the bar say has instantly strengthened Ms. Lewinsky's hand in her
struggle to avoid indictment.
</P>
<P>
   The two were on the case Wednesday, advising Ms. Lewinsky as
battle-hardened elders with as sharp an appetite for high-stakes
trials as for intricate bargaining aimed at immunity. In their
first 24 hours, they paid a lawyerly drop-in visit to the office of
Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel investigating the
relationship between the president and Ms. Lewinsky. They also
began the long unraveling of Ms. Lewinsky's version of Oval Office
events but offered only a glimpse of their initial impressions as a
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jake is more detached and professorial and scholarly than I
am,'' said Cacheris in a telephone interview. ``I am more of an
alleycat in the courtroom than he is. I get a little more
strident.''
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, the two could not be more different. The
73-year-old Stein, the son of a Washington lawyer, had the boyhood
dream of becoming a vaudevillian juggler.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought that would be a wonderful life, to do something to
perfection,'' he once said, settling instead for 50 years in the
law, a reputation as the unoffical dean of the capital's bar, and
juggling for fun. He himself has been an independent counsel _
hailed as the very model of one in his disciplined investigation
and exoneration of Edwin A. Meese III, the counselor to President
Ronald Reagan. But that experience, Stein said recently, convinced
him the independent counsel office's has ``the power to destroy
people.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the 69-year-old Cacheris, the son of a Greek
immigrant who bought into a small chain of waffle restaurants, had
the childhood fantasy of becoming ambassador to Greece, but became
instead a hardball defense lawyer specializing in high-profile,
highly politicized cases. He hates paperwork, partners' meetings
and procrastinators, but loves notorious defendants.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president and Vernon Jordan are already taken,'' he joked
two months ago as he agreed to represent the relatively minor
figure of the chauffeur to Jordan, the presidential confidant
featured in the Starr inquiry. ``So it's tough luck for me.''
</P>
<P>
   The new team's experiences have equipped them for either
alternative in the evolving Starr investigation: careful
negotiation for immunity or, in the event of the indictment of Ms.
Lewinsky, an all-out court fight. Cacheris' peers credit him with
some spectacular deal-making in recent years, notably the agreement
that spared Aldrich Ames execution as a convicted spy. Stein, in
turn, is respected for winning the sole acquittal in the Watergate
criminal trial during the Nixon era.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say Ms. Lewinsky now has a stunning team,'' said Kenneth
Parkinson, former counsel for the Nixon re-election committee, who
was successfully defended by Stein. ``They're not going to do
anything that would be stupid or out of character.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Starr's office sent out some rare positive vibes on
Wednesday with prosecutors' expressing their relief that finally,
as one put it, they were dealing with seasoned criminal defense
professionals who knew the ways of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The two lawyers bonded two decades ago during the Watergate
trial, when Cacheris represented Attorney General John Mitchell,
while Stein defended Parkinson. The two play tennis at Cacheris'
home in Alexandria, Va., and they see each other in the summer at
their Atlantic beach houses.
</P>
<P>
   They enjoy reminiscing about the fact that they are both
products of District of Columbia public schools, in the days,
Cacheris said, when students from the Maryland and Virginia suburbs
would pay $25 a year to attend. When Cacheris sold the townhouse
that housed his law practice a few years ago, Stein invited him to
take space in his building five blocks north of the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost a good-cop, bad-cop team,'' said Paul Rothstein, a
professor at Georgetown University Law Center who teaches with
Stein and is a longtime friend of both lawyers. ``They both shine
in the courtroom and in making deals, but Plato is more garrulous,
more talkative, more slap-on-the-back, hail fellow well met _ but
with the threat that `I could beat you up bad if I have to.' While
that is the reality with Jake, too, he doesn't wear it on his
sleeve as much as Plato does.''
</P>
<P>
   As elite members of the Washington bar, their fees are in the
top range of $400 or so an hour. But the two newcomers to the
Lewinsky investigation also exemplify the small-town closeness of
the capital bar. Stein and Starr crossed paths on the Senate's
ethics inquiry of Sen. Bob Packwood when Stein defended the senator
and Starr vetted the Packwood diaries.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For 17 years, Cacheris was the law partner of William Hundley,
who represents Vernon E. Jordan Jr., the president's confidant who
is being investigated for his role in the Lewinsky matter.
Hundley's son, John, works in Cacheris' office.
</P>
<P>
   Cacheris is also a close friend and former partner of Robert
Bennett, the lawyer who successfully defended President Clinton in
the Paula Jones civil lawsuit. The Jones sexual-harassment suit
sparked the Starr inquiry into possible perjury after both the
president and Ms. Lewsinky submitted sworn denials of a sexual
affair.
</P>
<P>
   Cacheris and Bennett are so close that Cacheris, regretful after
publicly criticizing his friend's rumpled demeanor, took him to his
own $1,500-a-suit tailor in Alexandria, Va. ``I just like to dress
well,'' Cacheris said. ``I told Bennett he needed to straighten
himself out _ sartorially.''
</P>
<P>
   In the tight-knit legal world of Washington, lawyers joust by
day and schmooze by night. ``It's nothing personal and we'll be
friends when the whole thing is over,'' Cacheris said in surveying
the lawyerly terrain in the most high-powered confrontation of
Clinton's incumbency.
</P>
<P>
   As frenetic as it has been, none of Stein's friends expect he
will interrupt his signature habit of closing himself off from the
world for afternoon literary ``siestas,'' when he does not answer
the phone and he indulges his formidable appetite for book reading,
especially in French and English writers of the 18th and 19th
centuries. ``The only talent I've got, I think, is the talent for
staying awake while reading,'' Stein once told an interviewer.
``That's quite a talent.''
</P>
<P>
   To the contary, the city's lawyers eagerly await the wry,
courtly writings on the legal life that Stein composes for bar
journals in the Edwardian comfort of his window-free, book-crammed
office, with its standup writer's desk and rocking chair.
</P>
<P>
   ``The symptoms of deposition torpor began creeping over me,'' he
confessed in one, lyrically describing a typical lawyer's travels
past ``the outer reefs of relevancy and beyond the cape of
materiality.''
</P>
<P>
   A quiet man, Stein exudes the cheer of a bon vivant on the
streets of the city, sporting white suits in summer and usually
stopping to make a respectful offering to street beggars. ``Being
Jake's luncheon partner is amazing,'' said Eugene Fidell, a lawyer
who said Stein's countless acquaintances always stop him on the
street. ``It's like going for a stroll with Jimmy Walker.''
</P>
<P>
   The appointment of the two lawyers sparked intense speculation
about their strategems. ``They're not going to roll over,'' said
Stuart Taylor, the legal affairs writer for The National Journal.
``And to some extent they hold some pretty high cards because a
criminal trial of Monica Lewinsky is a very dicey proposition for
Starr.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky can expect calm, quiet expertise, according to Fawn
Hall, the former White House secretary whom Cacheris defended in
the Iran-Contra investigation. ``Being someone all of 27 years old
when it happened, I was terrified,'' she recalled. ``I was way in
above my head. It was all too much. Plato was always a perfect
gentleman and had a very fatherly approach.''
</P>
<P>
   Cacheris said matter of factly that between the two of them, the
new Lewinsky team is steeped in ``the ability to handle cases of
this nature.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If there were to be a trial, I know I would say, `You do the
opening and I'll do the closing. You take this witness and I'll
take that one.' It's non-confrontation. We've been around this town
for a long time. Neither of us are awed by the personalities
involved.''
</P>
<P>
   The two lawyers are determined to make Washington forget the
verbal ramblings of the capital outsider, William Ginsburg, the
California malpractice specialist and close friend of the Lewinsky
family who was dismissed on Tuesday as her lawyer. ``We're not
going to go on talk shows, neither Jake nor I,'' Cacheris said.
``My disapproval of the prior lawyer is that he was spending too
much time on talk shows and not spending enough time on the case.''
</P>
<P>
   The Plato and Jake team made clear there will be no non-stop
sound bites and certainly no further reference to Ms. Lewinsky's
``poulkes'' _ her chubby thighs as an infant. ``Spare me,'' said
Cacheris.

FINANCIAL SERVICES FIRMS HAVE KEY ROLE AT RETIREMENT FORUM
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When President Clinton addresses ``The National
Summit on Retirement Savings'' Thursday, few will take issue with
the thrust of his remarks: that Americans should save more for
their golden years or risk a drop in living standards when they
retire.
</P>
<P>
   But some people are asking why the message is being delivered in
a forum that is heavily stocked with, and partly funded by,
financial services firms that have a business interest in the
savings habits of Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Through a law passed last year, Congress created the summit as a
``public-private partnership'' to find ways to encourage Americans
to save more for retirement. Two hundred delegates, chosen by the
White House and Congress, will discuss the topic with lawmakers and
federal officials. They meet at a Washington hotel Thursday and
tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   At least a quarter of the appointed delegates come from stock
brokerages, money-management firms, insurers, or similar companies
and trade groups, giving financial services firms the largest
portion of delegates. That compares with 16 delegates from labor
unions and employee trade groups.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, most of the funding for the summit comes indirectly
from Boston's Fidelity Investments and State Street Corp., as well
as other investment firms.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were hoping to see a larger number of people representing
middle-income working families and the poor, who have little access
to retirement savings vehicles, instead of people who would profit
tremendously from increased retirement savings,'' said Thomas
Matzzie of the Institute for America's Future, a union-allied group
focusing on wage and job security issues that is not attending the
summit.
</P>
<P>
   US Representative Harris Fawell, the Illinois Republican who
sponsored the bill creating the summit, said he hoped some of the
discussion would focus on tax law changes that would encourage
people to save more. ``We've got more than 200 experts from the
front lines coming to Washington, and now they've got the ear of
the president and the Department of Labor,'' Fawell said.
</P>
<P>
   But that troubles the groups representing workers, which say the
government should not undertake the discussion in a forum so
heavily weighted with business groups. They fear business groups
will use it to build support for such tax changes as higher limits
on 401(k) donations, which, in their view, cause the government to
give up tax revenue so wealthier Americans can save money tax free.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, they worry businesses will use the summit to build
support for eliminating ``nondiscrimination rules,'' which link a
company's success in persuading lower-income workers to save in
401(k) plans to its ability to allow higher-income workers to save
in the tax-deferred plans.
</P>
<P>
   They also fear that the ``save more'' message, while sounding
innocuous, will hasten a shift in the retirement burden onto
workers and away from traditional corporate pension plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Employers telling workers to save for themselves is a cover
for them to cut costs,'' said Karen Ferguson, director of the
Pension Rights Center in Washington and a delegate to the summit.
``When an employer stops its traditional pension or substitutes a
401(k), it's a pay cut for workers and a cost savings for the
employer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's hardly anybody lobbying for pensions for the average
worker,'' said Cindy Hounsell of the Women's Institute for a Secure
Retirement, referring to the delegate list, which includes her.
</P>
<P>
   Fawell said the delegates include ``a good cross-section'' of
groups involved with the retirement system. In addition to
financial services firms and labor unions, delegates come from
universities, think tanks, federal and state government, large and
small employers, and seniors groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're bound to have some people there who are in the
investment business, but that's OK,'' Fawell said. ``If you're
going to get some good hints about how to educate people on this,
we have to have people who are on the front lines tell us.''
</P>
<P>
   Financial services firms are indirectly covering much of the
cost of the summit, a move that has also drawn criticism.
</P>
<P>
   In the law creating the summit, which also called for similar
events in 2001 and 2005, Congress gave the Department of Labor
$250,000 to set up this year's event. It told the department to
find a private sector partner to pay the rest of the bill and to
help with preparations.
</P>
<P>
   That group is the American Savings Education Council, a
nonprofit educational organization founded in 1995 to promote
retirement savings. It does not take positions on public policy
issues.
</P>
<P>
   The council has a wide membership, including labor unions,
government agencies, and universities, but 75 percent of its
funding comes from 12 ``charter partners.''
</P>
<P>
   Nine of those partners are financial services firms or trade
groups representing companies in the industry. They include
Fidelity Investments and State Street Corp. of Boston, as well as
the Investment Company Institute, American Express Co., and
Prudential Investments.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Congress wants to do this (summit), why do it with what I
call `charged' or `loaded' money?'' asked Bill Hogan of the Center
for Public Integrity, a nonprofit Washington group that studies
money and ethics in politics. ``This is not disinterested money.''
</P>
<P>
   Hogan said the use of private firm money ``puts the Labor
Department in a bad position'' of potentially owing a favor to one
of the firms that helped fund the summit.
</P>
<P>
   Fawell said his bill called for private funding to help overcome
objections from the Clinton administration, which was ``initially
resistant'' to spending money on the summit.
</P>
<P>
   Don M. Blandin, president of the savings council, said his group
would probably end up covering about 70 percent of the cost of the
summit, which could top $800,000 overall.
</P>
<P>
   ``To say this is a plot by financial institutions is a bit of a
stretch,'' Blandin said. It was Congress and the president that
required a private-sector partner for the summit, and the Labor
Department asked the council to submit a proposal for running the
event, he said. He said the agenda and panelists were chosen by the
White House and Congress, not by the council or its corporate
sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   Blandin acknowledged that companies like Fidelity and American
Express might ``see it in their interest to make sure Americans
save and invest, and they're going to get a piece of that pie.''
But their support for the summit is ``general underwriting and in
an education mode that is not product-oriented,'' he said.

<P>
   France at home with idea of winning '98 Cup
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By JOHN P. LOPEZ &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
The symbolism reeked, in more ways than one.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, when France was chosen to play host to this summer's
World Cup, organizers chose to construct the hallmark stadium for
the tournament at a former waste site.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Stade de France in Saint Denis, just north of Paris,
is a magnificent 80,000-seat structure already being hailed
worldwide as an architectural marvel.
</P>
<P>
   The stadium is consummately French _ a compilation of daring
angles and interesting designs featuring more steel than concrete
and topped by an elliptical roof that gives it a 21st-century
appearance.
</P>
<P>
   International soccer federation president Joao Havelange has
called the site for the 1998 World Cup final the most beautiful
stadium he has ever seen. It also seems to epitomize French soccer,
which has risen from the sad wastelands of the world to a thing of
beauty.
</P>
<P>
   Once a perennial power and Cup contender that reached the
semifinals in 1982 and 1986, France fell into a dismal era in the
early 1990s when it constantly fell short of expectations and
missed qualifying for the World Cup in 1990 and 1994.
</P>
<P>
   But since risk-taking coach Aime Jacquet took over the national
team just before the 1994 Cup and legendary French star Michel
Platini became a leader in the federation, French fortunes have
changed dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   This 1998 version might in fact be the strongest French team
ever, which is saying something considering the glorious run led by
Platini in the mid-1980s, which included the 1984 European
championship.
</P>
<P>
   And it might be Zinedine Zidane, a 25-year-old superstar with a
game as poetic as his name, who carries the team to a Cup
championship on the home turf.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly have changed; we have a real team personality,''
said Zidane, a professional star for Juventus of Turin. ``We have a
freshness of spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   Zidane, dubbed ``the next Platini'' by Platini himself, is
arguably the best midfielder playing today. At minimum, he is at
the heart of a team that looks strong everywhere and has more
confidence than ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``All that we've done over the last three years has been done
with a single goal in mind,'' Jacquet said. ``We are here to win
the World Cup, nothing less.''
</P>
<P>
   It starts, of course, with group play in the first stage of the
June 10-July 12 tournament.
</P>
<P>
   The French are joined in Group C by South Africa, Saudi Arabia
and Denmark, which are all strong teams but realistically will be
fighting it out for second place behind the French.
</P>
<P>
   After all, in the World Cup there is no such thing as
overstating the importance of the home advantage.
</P>
<P>
   In 1966, England managed to win at home. West Germany (in 1974)
and Argentina (1978) also used the enthusiastic and abundant home
crowds as a springboard to the World Cup title.
</P>
<P>
   With such a strong team and more than 80 percent of 1998 World
Cup tickets going to French fans, this definitely is a unique
opportunity for the hosts, who seemingly are coming together at the
perfect time.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1993, the French have lost only once in 30 full
international matches. Along the way, France has defeated England
in England and Italy in Italy _ impressive by any standard.
</P>
<P>
   And France has done it with Jacquet's attack-first strategy
paying big dividends. Constantly pressing the ball, the French have
gone on streaks of dominance such as the recent 10-match spell in
which they scored 28 goals and allowed only five. Zidane makes the
plays, and strikers Stephane Guivarc and David Trezeguet score the
goals.
</P>
<P>
   The June 12 French opener against South Africa in Marseilles
promises to be a special scene, with France not only hosting the
Cup in its first appearance since 1986 but showcasing a team that
could make it all the way to the final.
</P>
<P>
   As for the second team that will advance out of Group C, the bid
looks to be up for grabs.
</P>
<P>
   South Africa figures to have trouble with both the pressure and
burden of playing in its first World Cup, but it is a talented team
nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   Denmark has the most Cup experience of the Group C teams, but it
might have too much experience. This is an aging team, virtually
identical to the one of four years ago, with only goalkeeper Peter
Schmeichel probably still at the top of his game.
</P>
<P>
   And Saudi Arabia has been put under tremendous pressure to
succeed, especially after hiring 1994 Brazilian World Cup coach
Carlos Alberto Parreira to lead its team.
</P>
<P>
   The Saudi government and soccer federation have made it clear
that nothing short of a second-round appearance is expected. If
small but skilled Saudi forward Sami Al-Jaber gets on a roll, it
could happen.

PUSHCART FOOD VENDORS PROTEST MAYOR'S CRACKDOWN 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As secretaries and stockbrokers alike came to their
defense, hundreds of sidewalk food vendors shut down their carts
Wednesday and paraded through lower Manhattan to protest the Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani's plan to restrict street sales in two broad
sections of Manhattan next month.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers in pinstripes and brokers in cuff links applauded as 800
peddlers of hot dogs, falafel and other cart cuisine marched
through the financial district a few hours after the 5 a.m. start
of a 24-hour work stoppage that left the city bereft of the
ubiquitous carts many New Yorkers view as a convenience but that
Giuliani considers a main cause of sidewalk congestion.
</P>
<P>
   The daylong absence of the $1 coffee-and-bagel specials, the
plastic plates of curried chicken and rice and the
two-dogs-with-mustard-and-onions lunch had time-pressed New Yorkers
grumbling as their stomachs rumbled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get them back!'' said Ancela Nastasi, a lawyer who said she
had voted for the mayor, as she wandered the cartless canyons of
the financial district in quest of a burrito.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's strongest support came Wednesday from proprietors of
the coffee shops and restaurants that compete with the carts. John
Poulos, owner of the Deli-Burger Restaurant in midtown Manhattan,
said he was delighted at the prospect of losing his meals on wheels
competition. ``They were killing us with their $1 coffee and
donut,'' he said. ``When I match their price, I lose 20 cents.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's protest resulted in an increase for Poulos' business
and he's hoping the change will be permanent. The vendors contended
that Wednesday's sidewalk famine could be a taste of things to come
if the mayor goes ahead with his plan to ban daytime street sales
of food, clothing, books and art from most of the financial
district and parts of midtown. Right now the city restricts vending
on many stretches of midtown avenues; the new rules would extend
the ban to many side streets.
</P>
<P>
   Eleni Pulako, 39, a sidewalk saleswoman from Brooklyn, asserted
that Giuliani was forgetting his roots in a quest for statewide or
national publicity as a tough guy. ``New York is dirty-water
dogs,'' she said, using an affectionate term employed by both
vendors and their customers.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference after the vendors marched from Liberty Park
in the heart of the financial district to Battery Park, where they
held a lunchtime rally, Giuliani defended the new rules as a
necessary part of a regulated and civilized society.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody's going to be out of work,'' he said. ``There are going
to be the same number of permits. They're just not going to be able
to be in exactly the place that they want to be. And that, of
course, makes sense. We can't have three, four, five food vendors
all in the same place, crowding the same place.''
</P>
<P>
   But the vendors, many of whom are immigrants, said the rules
would force them out of work by pushing them on to quieter streets
that would provide them with few customers. ``We are not educated
people,'' said Syed Sheren, 27, who has sold coffee and doughnuts
in midtown since moving from Afghanistan 10 years ago. ``We cannot
go work in the bank or work in the office.''
</P>
<P>
   Mohammed Haque, 39, a father of two who sells knishes and
pretzels near Wall Street, said he might return to Bangladesh to
avoid what he called the shame of welfare. ``I came to this country
with good dreams,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The sidewalk sellers feel they will be put out of business as a
result of a series of votes last month by the city's Street Vendor
Review Panel, a board dominated by mayoral appointees. Acting at
the mayor's request, it voted to close 144 blocks of Manhattan in
mid-July to vending of all sorts.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's work stoppage by food vendors, which appeared to be
nearly total, was organized by a group called the Big Apple Food
Vendors' Association, which contends that the restrictions resulted
from pressure on Giuliani from real estate interests and
restaurants. The group's president, Jeffrey Cicio, said the
shutdown of the carts and the demonstration _ at an estimated loss
to each vendor of about $125 in income _ would be followed by
``lawsuits, lobbyists and everything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the limitations apply to artists and booksellers, Norman
Siegel, executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union,
said he was looking into a possible First Amendment challenge.
Displaying a map of lower Manhattan with yellow highlighting
marking the streets that would be affected by the new restrictions,
he said: ``A court looking at a map like this will be very
suspicious. Is it really about congestion, or is it about
competition?''
</P>
<P>
   Several City Council members have introduced bills to repeal the
Street Vendor Review Panel and to institute a more systematic
approach to regulating the carts. ``The current process is akin to
a kangaroo court,'' said Councilman Anthony Weiner, D-Brooklyn.
``The regulations are anti-working class and anti-New York.''
</P>
<P>
   The new campaign is the latest in decades of efforts by many
mayors to corral the food vendors. Former Mayor Edward Koch said
Wednesday that Giuliani was making the same mistake he had made
when he proposed a bill in 1985 that would have barred food vending
from much of midtown.
</P>
<P>
   ``The realtors and the theater owners came in to me and said,
`We don't want these people,' and I listened to them,'' Koch said.
``But then I thought, what are we doing? These are decent people,
and they give people the chance to buy an inexpensive lunch.''
</P>
<P>
   After taking a look at the so-called congestion himself during a
walk through midtown, Koch retracted his own bill.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, however, Koch said some corners looked ``like a souk,''
or a Middle Eastern marketplace. He ordered the police to begin
enforcing a law, on the books since 1983, banning vendors from the
most congested areas of Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens. More than
1,000 vendors marched on City Hall in protest.
</P>
<P>
   In an agreement with the City Council six weeks later, Koch
relented in return for an agreement allowing no more than 10
vendors on each block in midtown. Shortly after taking office in
1994, Giuliani renewed the debate with the council over how to
enforce laws and regulations regarding vendors, which led to the
formation of the Street Vendor Review Panel.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has not taken his own street survey, said Jack Deacey,
a mayoral spokesman, but he added that the mayor observes the
streets as he drives through the city.
</P>
<P>
   The vendors' procession Wednesday was led by a cart sporting the
Hebrew National umbrella plastered with ``Going Out of Business''
signs. As the vendors wended down Broadway, past Wall Street and
Exchange Place, people emerged from subway stations and offices to
cheer them on.
</P>
<P>
   Julia Kaufmann, 30, a management consultant, said she was bitter
about having to spend twice as much for her morning coffee at a
shop and that she was mystified by the cart crackdown. ``You never
say: `Oh, my God. If that vendor weren't there, it would be easier
for me to get around,''' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Rituals of all sorts were disrupted Wednesday. Lee Keith, a
stockbroker who gets a chili dog from his favorite cart on Mondays,
Wednesdays and Fridays and then tries to ``go light'' on the other
days with a plain hot dog, decided to forego lunch in support of
the vendors. ``They are New York,'' he said of the cart vendors.
``What's Giuliani thinking?''

TEXAS TEAM NEGOTIATES LEARNING CURVE IN NASCAR TRUCK SERIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ It wasn't long before David Starr had a
Wizard of Oz kind of feeling. Late in a qualifying race for the
season-opening race of the NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series, Starr
realized he wasn't driving late-model stock cars in Texas anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Starr was two spots away from making the field for the Chevy
Trucks Challenge at Walt Disney World Speedway with two laps to go.
Directly ahead was the rear spoiler of the truck driven by Winston
Cup regular Bobby Hamilton, ``one of my heroes,'' Starr said.
</P>
<P>
   Hero or not, Starr had to get past. So he tried a maneuver that
would have worked when the 30-year-old, Arlington-based driver was
racing stock cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a good run on him coming off Turn 3 and got up beside
him,'' Starr said.
</P>
<P>
   But this wasn't Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``He ran me all the way to the bottom of the racetrack,'' Starr
said. ``I had to back off the gas. I didn't get by him. I could've
tapped him, but I figured our first race I didn't really need to
wreck a Winston Cup driver.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the unofficial welcome to the big time for Starr and the
Reher-Morrison racing team.
</P>
<P>
   The Arlington engine builders and successful drag racers are
running a limited schedule with an unsponsored entry in the truck
series, their first foray into a major NASCAR series. Their next
attempt at qualifying comes this evening at Texas Motor Speedway,
when they will try to make the field for the Pronto Auto Parts
400-kilometer race tomorrow night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to run as many races as we can,'' said Buddy Morrison,
who runs the truck operation while partner David Reher takes care
of drag racing. ``We need the experience, we need the practice.''
</P>
<P>
   The team's experience in drag racing makes it one of the best in
the National Hot Rod Association Pro Stock ranks. But
Reher-Morrison has no experience racing in a NASCAR series, and
can't afford to buy any.
</P>
<P>
   The No. 9 Reher-Morrison Motorsports Chevrolet traveled to three
of the first seven races. After failing to qualify at Disney World,
Starr put the truck in the field for races at Phoenix and Odessa,
Mo. He finished 25th and 23rd, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know you've got to go out there and pay your dues,''
Morrison said. ``That's the same way we did it in drag racing. We
started a long time ago, and made a lot of mistakes along the way,
but you learn as you go.''
</P>
<P>
   The team has learned several things so far.
</P>
<P>
   One is that the series costs a lot of money, a minimum of
$30,000 per race, and it's tough to do without a major sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a money-making venture by any means,'' Morrison said.
``We're paying for it all out of our pocket.''
</P>
<P>
   Morrison appreciates this week's one-race deal from Dallas-based
Choice Cabs. But if a major sponsor doesn't come on board for next
year, it'll be difficult to do more than 10 races they've scheduled
this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, we'll attract some good, solid sponsorship and be
able to run the whole series, or enough to run a good partial
series,'' Morrison said.
</P>
<P>
   Another lesson is it takes more than a good motor to make the
truck go fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``The engine is the easy part as far as we're concerned,''
Morrison said. ``Learning the chassis and the chassis setups, how
all that stuff works, that's the tough part. It's a big learning
curve.''
</P>
<P>
   The setups were the major problems in the two races so far. The
truck didn't handle well, and with little experience and an
undermanned crew they weren't able to make adjustments. Morrison,
Starr and Danny Keeton are the only full-time employees on the team
that has a part-time crew chief in Ken Simonson, who lives in
California.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really need six people,'' Morrison said. ``It was kind of a
fiasco.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr has learned that, unlike the racing series in Texas, he
alone can't compensate for a truck with handling problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the car wasn't handling well, I could manhandle it,'' he
said. ``In the trucks, if it's not handling well, you can't do
that. You have to slow down.''
</P>
<P>
   Slowing down requires patience, another lesson Starr is
learning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to run up front and be competitive,'' Starr said. ``But
it's such a tough series, and we're such a new team. Our main goals
are to make the field and to finish the race. Every lap you're able
to run, you're getting better. If you crash early, you just missed
out on 195 laps.''
</P>
<P>
   The lessons continue. Morrison soaks them in, but he'd like the
learning curve to speed up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have 25, 30 years experience racing cars,'' he said. ``It's
something we've proven. We just need a good sponsor to come on
board. With a little backing, I think we can be real competitive.''

LAWYERS INDICTED IN INSURANCE FRAUD CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (dc) 
 By THOMAS J. LUECK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a crackdown on insurance fraud that began with a
sweeping series of arrests in 1995, federal prosecutors Wednesday
announced the indictments of six lawyers in Brooklyn, Staten Island
and Long Island on charges of bribing insurance adjusters.
</P>
<P>
   Named in the indictments, which charged the lawyers with paying
off adjusters and corrupt insurance company middlemen in exchange
for favorable treatment in personal injury lawsuits, were a
Freeport lawyer who had sought the nomination for Nassau County
district attorney in 1974 and a former president of the Staten
Island Trial Lawyers Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``A system of secret kickbacks such as uncovered in this
investigation undermines confidence in negotiated settlements of
personal injury cases,'' said Zachary W. Carter, the U.S. attorney
for the Eastern District of New York, whose staff investigated the
case with the New York City office of the Federal Bureau of
Investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that these charges involve attorneys sworn to uphold
the law is all the more disturbing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   All six of the lawyers pleaded not guilty and each was released
on $250,000 bond after hearings Wednesday and on Tuesday before
Robert Levy, a magistrate in federal district dourt in Brooklyn.
Trial dates before Judge Carol Amon are to be scheduled on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers, all of whom were charged with a pattern of bribes
and kickbacks over several years, included Alvin Dorfman of
Freeport, who had lost his bid for the 1974 nomination for Nassau
County district attorney and Thomas Rybicki, a partner in the
Staten Island firm of Grae, Rybicki &AMP; Partners, who was identified
in court papers as a former president of the Staten Island Trial
Lawyers Association.
</P>
<P>
   Also named were Fredric Grae, a partner of Rybicki, and, in a
separate indictment, the entire firm headed by the two Staten
Island men. Other indictments named Theodore Bushlow of Brooklyn;
Joseph Levine of Hewlett on Long Island who practices in Brooklyn;
and Robert Malerba, a partner in the firm of Malerba, Downes &AMP;
Frankel in the Long Island town of Huntington.
</P>
<P>
   The indictments charged the lawyers with a pattern of criminal
activity intended to grease the wheels of personal injury lawsuits,
which often take months or years to resolve because of the
conflicting claims of people who are involved in cases like
automobile accidents.
</P>
<P>
   The charges describe a widespread scheme in which the lawyers
engaged a network of corrupt middlemen who worked as insurance
adjusters or had personal contacts inside insurance companies. The
middlemen were known as ``10 percenters'' or ``10 pointers''
because their bribes were calculated as a percent of the settlement
that would ultimately be received in the lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   According to the indictments, the insurance companies defrauded
included some of the nation's largest _ Aetna, American
International Group, Geico, Continental, State Farm and Fireman's
Fund.
</P>
<P>
   For some of the lawyers charged, the indictments described a
pattern of bribery that had become almost routine. Grae and Rybicki
were charged with using at least four middlemen over a period of
two years and making payoffs in at least 12 cases. Dorfman, using
at least two middlemen, made payoffs in at least 25 cases over 14
years, the indictment said.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Alonso, an assistant U.S. attorney under Carter, said the
maximum penalties sought against each lawyer would be five years in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   All six of the lawyers were said by people in their offices to
be away and unavailable for comment. A lawyer representing one of
those indicted, Malerba, called the charges groundless. `` Malerba
has been well respected by his community and his peers for over 35
years,'' his lawyer, Raymond Sotomayor, said. ``We will defend
against this indictment vehemently.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In an impressive assertion of organized labor's
political might, California voters on Tuesday dealt conservatives a
considerable setback by rejecting a measure championed by
Republicans that would have pinched the flow of money to Democratic
candidates and causes.
</P>
<P>
   The ballot initiative had posed one of the greatest political
threats to labor in years: It would have choked off a vital source
of money for Democrats, who largely champion labor's issues, by
requiring unions to get annual written permission from each member
before using dues for political purposes.
</P>
<P>
   The defeat, 53 percent to 47 percent, represented a stunning
comeback for labor. Early polls had indicated that the referendum
would prevail by more than a 2 to 1 margin. As recently as late
last week, a senior White House official who has closely monitored
the campaign here predicted, unhappily, that the initiative would
win.
</P>
<P>
   Most proponents blamed the result on lopsided spending on the
issue. Labor poured an estimated $20 million into the drive
compared to a few million spent by supporters of the referendum.
The outcome set off a round of recriminations and soul-searching
Wednesday among Republicans who had thought passage was well within
their grasp.
</P>
<P>
   Grover Norquist, the director of Americans for Tax Reform in
Washington, who campaigned aggressively for the referendum,
predicted that the outcome here will mean that only about five
states will approve proposals to restrict unions dues within the
next year instead of the anticipated 10 that might have been swept
up in the excitement of a victory here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been helpful if we had won _ there would have
been more momentum,'' Norquist said in an interview. ``But when
you're competing with a bottomless pit _ the ability to raise union
dues, it's a little tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Grossman, national chairman of the Democratic Party
responded: ``Grover Norquist and his merry band of extremists
clearly had in mind jump-starting a national campaign _ and
California was the centerpiece of their strategy. That strategy
lies in ruins.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   From here to Washington on Wednesday, labor leaders hailed their
triumph, saying that beyond the money there was an extraordinary
effort by hundreds of thousands of volunteers who made phone calls
and walked precincts in recent days to draw people to the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Another unexpected beneficiary, they said, was Gray Davis, who
won the Democratic gubernatorial nomination. Davis has long been an
ally of unions, and the turnout by labor for the ballot measure
also delivered more votes to his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The labor leaders predicted that the California victory will
embolden their efforts to reject similar initiatives in other
states _ and will spur greater grassroots participation by unions
in the November midterm elections. In the next year or two, nearly
a dozen other states are considering similar union measures, either
through their legislatures or the initiative process.
</P>
<P>
   ``A modern political miracle,'' declared John Sweeney, president
of the AFL-CIO, at a news conference in Washington. ``We gained new
strength and momentum for a pro-working family agenda heading into
the fall elections. More than 24,000 new union member political
activists emerged in California in the course of the campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   The reverberations were felt far beyond California and marked a
disquieting reversal for leading conservatives, including House
Speaker Newt Gingrich, who had vigorously pressed for the measure
and hoped its passage would embolden similar so-called ``paycheck
protection'' drives around the country.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome was also a serious personal rebuke to Gov. Pete
Wilson of California, who had championed the referendum and had
hoped its passage would give him a vehicle on which to base a
campaign for president in 2000 _ and leave conservatives who favor
the measure in his debt.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, expecting victory, had prevailed upon Gingrich to
postpone votes on campaign finance legislation that would have
called for restrictions similar to those in the California measure.
Wilson had thought approval of the referendum, known here as
Proposition 226, would help Republicans gain momentum for a similar
effort in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters after an appearance at a Republican
``unity breakfast'' in Newport Beach on Wednesday morning, Wilson
castigated unions for their role in defeating the proposal,
asserting, ``The more they rip off peoples' pay checks, the more
money they have in their warchests. And they will be just as
arrogant and high-handed as they can get away with.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor brushed aside a question about how the outcome will
affect his White House aspirations, saying, ``You pick your fights
because you think it's the right thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Surveys showed that while Democrats overwhelmingly rejected the
initiative, so did a sizable segment of voters who identify
themselves as Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the second-guessing and finger-pointing Wednesday was
among Republicans who blamed one another for mounting a feeble
campaign: Supporters in California attacked the Republican National
Committee for not channeling significant resources into the drive.
</P>
<P>
   Republican officials in Washington criticized the backers in
California for bickering over how best to pitch the initiative. And
supporters everywhere criticized major California business
organizations for their refusal to take on labor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people thought it was a sure win,'' said Mark Bucher, a
business executive from Tustin, an Orange County community south of
Los Angeles, who was prompted to write the initiative with two
friends after a teacher he knew groused that her union was backing
school board candidates that she opposed. ``So they turned away
their attention and gave their money elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   The unions pumped millions of dollars into television
commercials that said the referendum was the brainchild of a
``foreign lobbyist'' _ a reference to Norquist _ and that it
threatened everything from Medicare to education. They asserted
that it would hinder charities that use payroll deductions to raise
money.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents launched their television campaign only a few weeks
ago. They sought to counter the opponents ``scare stories'' and
referred disparagingly to ``union bosses'' amassing great sums of
money.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Mellman, a Democratic pollster who worked with labor to
oppose the measure, said his side was all the more aggressive
because it was spurred on by the early poll findings showing that
it would pass. As for the opponents, he said, ``They were misled by
their own hubris.''
</P>
<P>
   Norquist, whose group contributed about $500,000 to the
referendum campaign, did not dispute that point, saying some
possible donors were reluctant to contribute because they did not
think the referendum was in trouble. ``That hurt us on fund
raising,'' he said. ``That one of the reasons business didn't
contribute.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the critics who blame the Republican National Committee
for barely putting any money into opposing the referendum, Clifford
May, the party's communications director, explained that candidates
are a higher priority.
</P>
<P>
   ``As much as we supported this, our job is to elect Republicans
in November,'' he said. ``Our job is not to match the unions and
have less left over for November.'' &QL;

SUSPECTED TERRORIST BROUGHT TO U.S. TO FACE CHARGES 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By DAVID STOUT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Mohammed Rashid, a soft-spoken man who federal
investigators say is one of the Middle East's most dangerous
terrorists, has been brought to the United States amid high secrecy
to face charges for a 1982 airline bombing that killed a Japanese
youth.
</P>
<P>
   Rashid, 51, pleaded not guilty here on Wednesday to a nine-count
federal indictment that includes charges of murder, sabotage,
assault and placing bombs on aircraft. As for how and where he was
caught, a Justice Department spokesman, John Russell, said, ``We're
not disclosing anything _ absolutely nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   The mystery surrounding Rashid's apprehension seemed appropriate
for a man who prosecutors say has crisscrossed the world using a
variety of aliases and fake passports to plant bombs meant to kill
total strangers in the name of the Palestinian cause.
</P>
<P>
   For years, federal investigators have sought Rashid for the Aug.
12, 1982, bombing of a Pan American World Airways liner that killed
Toru Ozawa, 16, on a flight from his native Japan to Honolulu. The
victim bled to death before the plane could land.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen other people were injured in the blast, which the
authorities say Rashid set off with a time-delayed bomb he planted
while traveling with his wife and their son on an earlier leg of
the flight, from Hong Kong to Japan.
</P>
<P>
   That 1982 bombing may be all but forgotten, in light of
subsequent terrorist attacks on the air and on the ground, but
law-enforcement officials consider it the first terrorist bomb
attack on an airline.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment accuses Rashid of placing a bomb two weeks later
on another Pan Am plane. That bomb was found before it exploded,
but investigators said its wiring matched that found on a hair-thin
sliver found in Toru Ozawa's body.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment says Rashid belongs to the terrorist 15th of May
organization and was a high-ranking aide to the group's leader, Abu
Ibrahim. The group was based in Baghdad, the indictment says, and
it was in the Japanese Embassy there that Rashid and his wife
submitted false visa applications that helped Rashid carry out the
bombing that killed the Japanese youth.
</P>
<P>
   Rashid's wife, Christine Pinter, who is sometimes known as
Fatima, is also accused in the indictment. She is still at large,
Russell of the Justice Department said today. The whereabouts of
the couple's son, Zuhair, is also unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Russell said the government would seek a sentence of life in
prison for Rashid rather than the death penalty. That fact may
indicate that a nation turned Rashid over to the United States,
since other nations typically ask Washington to promise not to
execute defendants when it hands them over, Russell conceded. There
were rumors early Wednesday evening that Rashid had been handed
over by Egypt.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The indictment charging Rashid, his wife and Abu Ibrahim was
returned in 1987. Rashid was arrested on a false-passport charge in
Greece in 1988, but the authorities there refused a U.S. request to
extradite him.
</P>
<P>
   A Greek court convicted Rashid in 1992 of the fatal airline
bombing, and he was sentenced to 18 years in prison. That sentence
was reduced to 15 years by an appeals court, and Rashid was
released in 1996 for good behavior_ a development that angered U.S.
officials. Rashid then flew to Cairo and was deported to Tunisia.
</P>
<P>
   The arraignment on Wednesday before Judge Aubrey Robinson in
U.S. District Court here suggested that Rashid had not been long in
U.S. custody. The hearing was delayed nearly an hour, until the
arrival of Rashid's lawyer, Tony Miles of the U.S. Public
Defender's office. Miles apologized to Robinson for not wearing a
suit coat, explaining that he had had to rush to court.
</P>
<P>
   Rashid, a baldish, slightly built man, answered questions
through an interpreter, who talked to him in Arabic. Rashid
described himself as a Palestinian who had been ``thrown out'' of
his country in 1948, when Israel was founded.
</P>
<P>
   He said he understood the court proceedings, although he
complained about having to answer the same charges in the United
States that he was imprisoned for in Greece.
</P>
<P>
   Rashid and the prosecutors agreed on one thing, in a sense.
Describing his nationality, Rashid said, ``I have been a vagabond
between the Arab countries.''
</P>
<P>
   Exactly, the prosecutors said, saying he should not be granted
bail under any circumstances. Robinson set a hearing for Friday on
that issue.

SPECTACULAR BID OFFERS PROOF BEST CAN LOSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By RANDY MOSS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELMONT, N.Y. _ The week of the 1979 Belmont Stakes, trainer Bud
Delp felt like one of the most important men on the planet.
</P>
<P>
   He had a room at Manhattan's plush Plaza Hotel. Every morning,
he was ferried to the track in a chauffeured limousine, compliments
of the New York Racing Association. And his sensational 3-year-old
colt Spectacular Bid was considered a shoo-in to capture the
Belmont and with it an elusive piece of sports hardware.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of us were sitting on a bale of straw at Belmont Park the
morning before the race,'' Delp recalls. ``I said, `All we've got
to do is lead him to the paddock and the Triple Crown is ours.' ''
</P>
<P>
   That brashness was extinguished the next afternoon, when Coastal
won the mile-and-a-half Belmont Stakes. Spectacular Bid, the 1-to-5
favorite, faltered in the stretch and finished third.
</P>
<P>
   Real Quiet also is expected to be an overwhelming favorite in
Saturday's Belmont in his attempt at a Triple Crown. But
Spectacular Bid's loss, one of the sport's greatest upsets, is only
one illustration of how that road to glory is littered with
unexpected casualties. In the years since, would-be sweepers
Pleasant Colony, Alysheba, Sunday Silence and Silver Charm were
thwarted in the Belmont.
</P>
<P>
   Some were unlucky, others outrun. But the story behind
Spectacular Bid's loss is easily the most bizarre, the
quintessential racetrack version of Murphy's Law: If anything can
go wrong, it will, and at the worst possible moment.
</P>
<P>
   Just before sunrise the morning of the Belmont Stakes, the
confident Delp stepped out of his limo at the barn. As soon as his
feet touched the ground, he heard groom Herman ``Mo'' Hall
shouting: ``He's lame, boss. The colt's lame!''
</P>
<P>
   Delp hurried to Spectacular Bid's stall, where the steel-gray
colt was holding his right front foot above the straw bedding.
</P>
<P>
   When Delp picked up the foot, he saw a safety pin bent and
embedded about three-eighths of an inch into the underside of the
hoof.
</P>
<P>
   He knew immediately what had happened. As a playful youngster,
Spectacular Bid liked to use his teeth to tear off safety pins that
secured his protective leg bandages. Hall discouraged ``Bid'' by
placing adhesive tape over the safety pins, and covering the tape
with hot Cayenne pepper.
</P>
<P>
   But Spectacular Bid somehow worked a pin loose, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one in a million,'' Delp said. ``The pin must have
slipped out and went into the straw. Then he probably got hungry
overnight, and he was pawing big time because he wanted to eat.
When he wanted something, he stomped his feet like a
sledgehammer.''
</P>
<P>
   Delp immediately removed the pin, and pus oozed from the small
wound.
</P>
<P>
   Spectacular Bid appeared to walk soundly, and the foot was cold,
but Delp recalled similar experiences with nails and glass. Things
seldom turned out well, especially when such wounds were exposed to
the urine and feces in straw bedding.
</P>
<P>
   Delp packed the foot in cool mud mixed with vinegar and Epsom
salts, headed back to the hotel and phoned owner Harry Meyerhoff,
who agreed that Spectacular Bid would have to be scratched from the
Belmont if the foot became sore during the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Several restless hours later, Delp returned to the barn. Media
swarmed the front of the barn, so Delp sneaked Spectacular Bid
around to the back side and jogged him to and fro.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looked 100 percent sound,'' Delp said. ``I said I think we
can get away with it. So we ran.''
</P>
<P>
   Spectacular Bid opened a three-length lead near the Belmont
stretch under young jockey Ronnie Franklin, but Delp soon realized
he had miscalculated.
</P>
<P>
   According to Delp, Spectacular Bid raced the entire distance
while leading with his left front leg to avoid putting pressure on
his right foot. As a result, he grew fatigued in the final
quarter-mile. He came out of the race with a sore left leg and a
badly infected right foot that took two months to heal.
</P>
<P>
   Spectacular Bid went on to become perhaps the greatest racehorse
ever, losing only once more, later that year to 1978 Triple Crown
champion Affirmed. At his Maryland home, Delp has a VHS tape with
all 26 of the colt's lifetime victories.
</P>
<P>
   The Belmont Stakes is not on the tape.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched it one time and one time only,'' Delp said. ``I
never watched a tape of it, and I never will. I knew what happened.
I tortured him. It was the only time in his whole racing career
that anybody ever passed him in the stretch.''

<P>
   Minority-rights advocates, stung by the decisive success of a
voter initiative in California ending bilingual education there,
filed suit in U.S. District Court in San Francisco on Wednesday to
prevent the resolution from taking effect. They asserted that it
violated the U.S. Constitution's promise of equal protection as
well as federal education and civil rights laws.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who took part in the lawsuit Wednesday was the
Southern Christian Leadership Conference of Los Angeles. Its
executive director, Genethia Hayes, said, ``Proposition 227 will
prove the most devastating piece of legislation for
language-minority students in the history of public education in
the state.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It removes,'' she said, ``all hope of equitable access to
employment, college admission, and success, and full participation
in a democratic society.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, California's education officials said they were
examining budget, material and staffing requirements of Proposition
227, which gives them 60 days to dismantle hundreds of bilingual
education programs and replace them with intensive one-year
immersion classes for the 1.4 million pupils in the state who have
limited proficiency in English.
</P>
<P>
   Since California accounts for nearly half the students in the
nation with special English-learning needs, the 61 percent to 39
percent vote for Proposition 227 in California reverberated across
the country, where many bilingual programs have been under scrutiny
and attack in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this initiative will represent the beginning of the
end of bilingual education around the United States,'' said Ron
Unz, the Silicon Valley software entrepreneur who sponsored
Proposition 227, adding that he did not consider the legal
challenges to be serious.
</P>
<P>
   A bill limiting federal aid to bilingual education sponsored by
Rep. Frank Riggs, R-Calif., was to be considered Thursday by the
House Committee on Education and the Workforce, and seemed likely
to pass.
</P>
<P>
   The bill limits the use of federal money in bilingual education
programs to three years and removes the requirement that most of
the federal financing for such programs be used for native language
instruction.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But James Lyons, executive director of the National Association
for Bilingual Education, a private non-profit group in Washington,
predicted that the federal lawsuit would be successful and that
bilingual education would continue to thrive in California and
across the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm positive this is going to stop here,'' Lyons said. ``It is
divisive, destructive and, thank God, most people outside
California know better.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal money for bilingual education amounts to only about $400
million annually, to which states add much more, but passage of
such a bill would mark an important political victory for those
seeking to limit or end bilingual education.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, many school officials nationwide were defiant. New
York City Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew said Wednesday, ``This is
not in any way, shape or form a policy direction I agree with.''
</P>
<P>
   Crew said his staff has spent the past year reviewing bilingual
education as part of an effort to raise academic standards in the
1.1 million-student school system, the nation's largest.
</P>
<P>
   About 150,000 New York City students have limited English
proficiency. A draft policy seeking to speed their acquisition of
English will be presented to the board next fall, but it will not
take California's ``cold turkey'' approach, Crew said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should not be abandoned,'' Crew said of the program. ``It
should be strengthened.''
</P>
<P>
   At its core, bilingual education teaches children in their
native tongue while gradually teaching them English so that after a
few years they can join mainstream classes.
</P>
<P>
   Current bilingual education programs date from the late 1960s.
While there are scores of immigrant groups in the country, about
three-fourths of children with English learning needs are Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   But critics have complained that such programs segregate
children and delay their transition into regular classes by several
years.
</P>
<P>
   In California, the problem has been that the large numbers of
Mexicans moving into the state have settled in distinct communities
which has impeded their assimilation.
</P>
<P>
   Unz said Wednesday that his concern was for the youngsters who
were not learning enough English to succeed in American society.
</P>
<P>
   Under Proposition 227, students whose English is limited will
enter regular classes after a year of intensive language
instruction. But the measure also permits parents to choose
bilingual education under exceptional circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Unz said he expected a few bilingual programs to survive, and
said he hoped the better ones would.
</P>
<P>
   The political obstacles the initiative overcame _ opposition by,
among others President Clinton, the chairmen of the state
Democratic and Republican parties, all four candidates for governor
and the editorial pages of the state's largest papers _ was
testimony to its popularity among the voters, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Unz also asserted that his side spent only $1.2 million from
start to finish, a paltry sum by the standards of other voter
initiatives in the state, and much less than the $3.2 million his
opponents say they spent.

 &HT;    Holyfield foe fought dad first
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A stretch limo picked up Henry Akinwande at his
luxury hotel recently and shuttled him from one television station
to another. A second heavyweight title shot in less than a year was
nearing. So was a $2.5 million payday.
</P>
<P>
   Life as an outcast is good.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in Nigeria, they believe you have to be destitute to be
messing with boxing,'' said Akinwande, who was born in England but
grew up in Lagos, Nigeria. ``My father, he went crazy. He went down
to the gym where I was working out and he told the trainer, `If you
train him again, I'm going to come down and lock you up in prison.'
''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Akinwande decided against a citizen's arrest several
years ago. Instead, he merely disowned his teenage son.
</P>
<P>
   Akinwande is in the unlikely role of challenger for Evander
Holyfield's heavyweight title Saturday night at Madison Square
Garden. His entire career has been unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   Akinwande was born in 32 years ago in Dulwich, England, to
Nigerian parents who left Lagos to be educated in England. After
getting degrees, the family returned to Nigeria when Henry was
eight and Joseph Akinwande went into the import/export business.
</P>
<P>
   It was the father's hope that his son would one day pursue a
college degree and take over the business. But Akinwande had other
plans. Wanting to learn how to defend himself, he started going to
a boxing gym as a teenager. The sport became more than a diversion
for him, and by the time he was 17 he decided to pursue it as a
career.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father wanted to kill me,'' he said. ``He did not want me
to go into boxing. And you have to understand _ in Nigeria, when
your father wants you to do something, you do it. But this was
something I wanted to do. He said, `Fine, if you box, leave.' So I
did.''
</P>
<P>
   Akinwande moved back to England and resumed boxing in a gym in
the London suburbs. He became one of the top amateurs in England,
made the 1988 Olympic team, then turned pro the next year. He
accumulated 32 wins and a draw in his first 33 fights, the most
impressive victory being a third-round knockout of Jeremy Williams
for the lightly regarded WBO belt in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Akinwande and his son eventually reconciled, although
Joseph still dislikes boxing and won't be in New York this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he respects the fact that I was a man _ that I set out
to do something and I made it,'' Akinwande said. ``His friends told
him that there was nothing he could do about it because I was doing
something that I loved and I was making more money than people who
become engineers.''
</P>
<P>
   In terms of respect, however, Akinwande may have earned more
from his family than from boxing fans. His first big chance for a
major title came in July against WBC champion Lennox Lewis in
Stateline, Nev. A number of boxing experts thought that the
6-foot-7 Akinwande might upset Lewis. Instead, he earned the
nickname ``Huggin' Henry'' by continually holding Lewis and was
disqualified in the fifth round by referee Mills Lane.
</P>
<P>
   Another title shot was unlikely. But it was ruled Orlin Norris
was bypassed in the rankings illegally and should have been given a
title shot. Norris was told he would get a bout with Holyfield if
he first beat anybody in the top 10. But promoter Don King offered
only $50,000 to a challenger, and Akinwande was the lone boxer to
accept. Norris lost a 12-round decision, making Akinwande a
mandatory challenger.
</P>
<P>
   The public largely views Akinwande as an undeserving challenger,
as someone who choked in his one big fight. He has issued a series
of excuses for the Lewis loss:
</P>
<P>
   _ The smaller ring in Stateline affected his strategy;
</P>
<P>
   _ The high altitude hindered his breathing;
</P>
<P>
   _ His trainer then, Don Turner, largely ignored him in camp
because he was spending most of his time with Holyfield.
</P>
<P>
   The excuses have only increased the criticism. Akinwande's
response: ``I'm here to prove people wrong. The people who say I
don't have any heart, I don't have any guts, they don't know. They
don't know what I've lived through.''

U.S. APPEALS COURT BACKS NYC PLAN TO CURB SEX BUSINESSES

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's efforts to mold New York
City into a more civil metropolis received a major boost Wednesday
when a federal appeals court upheld a zoning law intended to
curtail and isolate the dozens of X-rated businesses in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Emboldened by language in the ruling that said the law ``may be
enforced forthwith,'' city officials quickly announced plans to
dispatch inspectors to sex shops throughout the city's five
boroughs, beginning Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   But the city officials were forced to rein in their ambitions
just a few minutes later, after learning that the decision would
not become official under federal court rules for up to 21 days.
</P>
<P>
   That technicality gave breathing room to lawyers for the sex
shop owners in their increasingly desperate attempt to block the
zoning law, which bans strip clubs and X-rated book and video shops
from operating within 500 feet of residential areas, schools, day
care centers, houses of worship _ or each other.
</P>
<P>
   Following the unanimous ruling by a three-judge panel of the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit in Manhattan, the lawyer
for the shop owners said he would now ask the full appeals court to
take up the issue. ``I have never for a moment lost confidence in
our constitutional claims and intend to pursue them all the way to
the Supreme Court if I have to,'' said Herald Price Fahringer, who
represents 107 adult-entertainment business owners.
</P>
<P>
   But one more delay in the protracted legal battle did not still
the joy of Giuliani and his aides, or of City Council members who
first proposed the ban.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani called the ruling a ``particularly significant
victory'' in his ongoing ``quality of life'' campaign, and said it
should silence critics who contended that the zoning law violated
the First Amendment rights of owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``This would now be 13, 14, 15, about 16 or 17 separate judges
who have looked over this plan and come to the determination that
the plan is legal,'' he said, referring to the series of state and
federal court challenges that the law has faced since it was
enacted in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the legal avenues available to the store and club
owners are rapidly dwindling. While the owners can seek a hearing
before the full panel of the Court of Appeals, such appeals are
seldom accepted.
</P>
<P>
   Their lawyers could then seek the intervention of the U.S.
Supreme Court, but there is no certainty that the nation's highest
court would agree to hear the case.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   City officials said the law would affect 146 of the city's 164
X-rated businesses, although civil and criminal proceedings may
delay the closings by as much as a year. ``We expect that many of
these establishments will realize that they have to shut down and
will do so on their own,'' said Randy Mastro, deputy mayor for
operations. ``This is the last dance for sex shops.''
</P>
<P>
   But some shop owners said they would adapt, not close.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Richard Kunis, the owner of Manhattan Video on West
39th Street, has spent the last several weeks building shelves and
accumulating horror movies, war movies and even family-oriented
movies, including ``On Golden Pond,'' ``Oh God! Book II'' and
``Holiday Singalong With Mitch Miller.''
</P>
<P>
   And Milton Anthony, the owner of Billy's Topless, a bar in
Chelsea, said bikinis would provide his performers with the legal
cover to dance uninterrupted.
</P>
<P>
   For the Giuliani administration and the Council, the issue
hinged on the impact that strip clubs and adult-entertainment shops
have on the city's neighborhoods and economy, from Times Square and
Chelsea to stretches of major boulevards in Queens.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a simple proposition,'' Mastro said. ``We want to keep
sex shops away from our neighborhoods, away from our schools, away
from our churches.''
</P>
<P>
   But the owners of adult-entertainment businesses and several gay
rights groups have framed the debate as an attempt to stifle free
speech, and, as one sex shop owner said, to ``Giuliani-ize the
city,'' eliminating or restricting legal and longstanding ventures
that the mayor finds distasteful.

ABSOLUTELY ANYTHING FOR A TICKET
</HEADLINE>
  (ja)  
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY, Utah _ On a gorgeous afternoon in a city known
for its laid-back veneer, basketball fans went a little crazy over
their Jazz Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   There was a pregame stream of cars, vans and jeeps decorated in
purple Jazz paraphernalia: streamers, flags and banners. Fans
walked around with ``Beat the Bulls'' placards.
</P>
<P>
   They converged on the downtown Gallivan Center, where a variety
of booths had been set up for fans' participation.
</P>
<P>
   By 2 o'clock the audience had grown to 150. This was the moment
of truth: they had come to watch five fans vie for the right to win
two pairs of tickets to Game 1 Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   As part of a promotion by KFAN Radio, fans were asked what they
would do, how far they would go, how desperate they were to win
tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Young Sandy Fender came wearing a bikini and then had a tattoo
man put a Jazz team logo very low on her back. In the back of the
plaza, Tony Dail sat on his custom Softail Harley-Davidson dressed
in leather chaps with two Jazz stickers on his buttocks. At the
appointed time, Dail revved up the motorcycle, drove to the middle
of the square, got off his bike and did a shimmy shake, a la Mark
Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   The program director of KFAN, David Locke, said the station had
hoped that Indiana would be the Jazz's opponent, because they had
wanted to bring a race car and smash it up. He said it was a little
harder to come up with something for the Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   Next came Mark Miller, a 25-year-old engineer crossdressed to
look like the pop singer Celine Dion. Miller belted out an
absolutely horrible falsetto version of the love song from
``Titanic'' with Jazz lyrics substituted for the original words.
</P>
<P>
   Each contestant was received politely.
</P>
<P>
   Next, Blair Postma came out and took out a jar containing 15
goldfish that he planned to devour. ``I just figured that 15 is the
number of playoff games we have to win to win the championships,''
he explained. Asked if his mother knew he was doing this, Postma
smiled and said sure, she's right there, and pointed to his mother
and her friends snapping pictures.
</P>
<P>
   Just before he went up to do his thing, Postma said: ``I'll eat
the first 11, then the last four I'm going to chew up, like the
Jazz are going to chew up Chicago tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   As he gulped, fans chanted: ``Blair, Blair, Blair,'' then
``U-tah, U-tah.''
</P>
<P>
   There is clearly a marriage in Salt Lake City, a confluence of
purpose surrounding basketball: fans as desperate to win
championship tickets as the players, especially Karl Malone and
John Stockton, are to win a championship.
</P>
<P>
   The sense in Salt Lake City, if you go by what you hear and
read, is one of supreme confidence that 1998, finally, is Utah's
year:
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls are coming off a grueling seven-game series against
the Pacers, the Bulls are showing their age, the Bulls have no one
to stop Karl Malone. Utah has the home-court advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really think we've got them where we want them,'' Postma
said before swallowing the goldfish. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The final contestant of the day was a man known only as Dale; no
one expected him to top Postma. Until he announced was going to eat
a Dennis Rodman sandwich, and produced two slices of white bread
with worms in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   There were shrieks from those at the front, howls of disgust
from those in the back. But everyone applauded wildly for Dale,
even as they averted their eyes.
</P>
<P>
   So Postma and Dale were hands-down winners. They sat next to
each other Wednesday night, rooting with 19,000 others for Utah to
begin the end of the Bulls' dynasty.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we win ... when we win,'' Postma corrected, ``this place
will be crazy, major hysteria.'' No one here even mentions the
possibility of a loss. Some even predict a Utah victory in five or
six games. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What happens if you lose? What happens if Utah loses?
</P>
<P>
   ``If we lose I think you better close off all the buildings' top
floors,'' Blair said. ``Somebody might try to jump off.''
</P>
<P>
   Last Sunday a lot of people were convinced that Utah was the
team of destiny.
</P>
<P>
   After spending an afternoon at Gallivan Center, things do not
seem as sure.
</P>
<P>
   Fans truly love their Jazz.
</P>
<P>
   But the outward confidence punctured by this underlying sense of
desperation _ all this eating of fish, devouring of worms, even
singing the theme song from ``Titanic,'' it all seems terribly
ominous. &QL;

GOLDWATER IS HONORED AS A MAN OF PRINCIPLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. _ Former Sen. Barry M. Goldwater once told his
minister at the end of a friend's funeral that it had been a
``damngood'' send-off, and that is what he got himself Wednesday
afternoon when his own time to go came around.
</P>
<P>
   In a memorial service here filled with military pagentry,
tearful reminiscences and glowing encomiums, Goldwater, who was 89
when he died last Friday of natural causes, was hailed as a man of
honesty and principle to a fault and a politician who did more than
any other to set the Republican Party on its current conservative
course.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all the history of American politics, Barry Goldwater will
remain a chapter unto himself,'' Sen. John McCain, his successor in
Washington and a fellow Republican, told three thousand mourners, a
planeload of them from Washington, who crowded into Arizona State
University's Gammage Auditorium to say goodbye to the crusty,
curmudgeonly Republican who lost by a landslide to Lyndon Johnson
in the 1964 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   A private funeral service for the family was held just before
the memorial service. Later, a family spokesman said the senator's
remains would be cremated, and his ashes, in accordance with his
frequently expressed wish, would be spread in the Grand Canyon if
details could be worked out with the National Park Service and
Indian tribes who live there.
</P>
<P>
   During the memorial service, Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, a
former Arizona governor and the only Democrat to speak, compared
Goldwater to Geronimo, saying ``freedom was everything'' to both
men.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barry Goldwater and the great chieftian stand together,''
Babbitt said, ``both unique, both momentous, both among God's
maginificent creations.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Babbitt read a message of praise from President Clinton, in
which the president concluded that the way Goldwater conducted his
life constituted ``citizenship that we all must emulate.''
</P>
<P>
   So the encomiums went, for more than 90 minutes, now and again
interspersed with a bit of martial music (Goldwater was a retired
two-star Air Force Reserve general) and religious song and prayer.
</P>
<P>
   Goldwater's brother Bob, tears glistening, told of how a sibling
he never dreamed would one day run for president had played
baseball (Barry batted crosshanded). He laughed, tears still
glistening, as he rembered Barry teasing girls with mice, back in a
long ago time when Phoenix was just a dusty desert town and Arizona
was the nation's newest state.
</P>
<P>
   He did not dwell on that presidential run, a political debacle
in which the senator took one of the worst beatings ever
administered in a presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   For that matter, hardly any other of Wednesday's speaker's dwelt
on that defeat, just as few mentioned the intense criticism of the
senator for his outspoken stands on race, welfare and other social
issues, some so conservative as to border on harshness and
insensitivity.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did any of the speakers dwell on Goldwater's
sail-against-the-wind penchant in later life to pull back from the
hard right on some hot issues, namely abortion and gays in the
military.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, Wednesday being a day to honor the dead, the speakers
saw the terrible defeat of 1964 as losing a battle and winning a
war as shown by the current Republican dominance in Congress and in
many states. And they saw the senator's hardline bluntness as
courage and refusal to compromise in an age of political
chamelions, as one put it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He new that in the end the most important thing was to tell
the truth,'' Jon Kyl, Arizona's other senator, said of the 1964
race. ``And he died a winner _ witness the people in this
auditorium.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides the hundreds of Arizonans who had come to pay final
respects there were in the assemblage the likes of House Speaker
New Gingrich, Senate Leader Trent Lott, former Vice President Dan
Quayle, Gov. Pete Wilson of California and Nancy Reagan, wife of
the former president, toting a brightly colored parasol to ward off
the desert son.
</P>
<P>
   Each of them knew in their hearts that not only was Barry
Goldwater ``right,'' as his campagin slogan in 1964 had proclaimed
but that they, by right, owed much of what they had accomplished in
political life to the conservative revolution he sparked in defeat.
</P>
<P>
   A fitting Goldwater epitaph, Kyl, a Republican, concluded, might
be: ``An honest man who tried.''
</P>
<P>
   The service included a performance by Robert Tree Cody, an
American Indian who said he had written a song for the senator.
</P>
<P>
   He blew a melancholy melody on a flute-like instrument and then
in a voice equally melancholy in his native dialect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sing this song to a great man,'' he concluded, in English.
</P>
<P>
   Then, closing the ceremony, an honor guard marched onto the
stage, gently lifted the American flag draped over the casket of
burnished wood, folded it just-so into a star-studded triangle and
handed it to Goldwater's widow, Susan.
</P>
<P>
   A buglar sounded taps. And a firing squad brought it all to a
end with three crashing volleys.

RIVAL QUESTIONS REAL QUIET'S GREATNESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELMONT, N.Y. _ One rival's trainer thinks Real Quiet is good
enough to win the Belmont Stakes and the Triple Crown. He just
isn't sure the horse is great enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I think about a Triple Crown winner, I think of Citation,
Secretariat, Seattle Slew,'' David Cross, trainer of Classic Cat,
said Wednesday morning outside his Belmont Park barn. ``I would
have trouble putting this horse in the same boat as those horses.''
</P>
<P>
   Cross referred to Real Quiet's crooked-legged conformation and
4-for-14 record.
</P>
<P>
   He also disparaged Real Quiet's Kentucky Derby victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think it was a good Derby, that's all,'' said the
Santa Anita-based Cross, who won the 1983 Derby with Sunny's Halo.
He added: ``The Preakness was awesome. If (Real Quiet) runs that
race again here, we're all running for second.''
</P>
<P>
   Classic Cat finished third in the Preakness.
</P>
<P>
   Running shoes: If you put much stock in workout times, you must
like Hanuman Highway.
</P>
<P>
   The California-based gelding went 4 furlongs in :45 3/5 and
galloped out 5 furlongs in :58 under jockey Jose Santos here on a
clear, windy Wednesday morning. The day's second-fastest half-mile
work was :46 2/5 by 1997 2-year-old champion Countess Diana.
</P>
<P>
   Trainer Kathy Walsh said a pair of glue-on shoes, applied after
one of the nails in a regular shoe bothered Hanuman Highway's right
forefoot, came through the workout in good shape.
</P>
<P>
   The Arkansas Derby runner-up was the only Belmont Stakes horse
to work out Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Quick draw: The field and post positions for Saturday's race
will be set this morning. Unlike Churchill Downs and Pimlico, which
had owners ``draft'' post positions in an order determined by
chance, Belmont will choose starting slots purely by lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why change something that's been done for 200 years?'' Cross
said. ``It doesn't matter where you draw _ you've got a mile and a
half to overcome any problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Ten horses are expected to enter: Real Quiet, Victory Gallop,
Classic Cat, Hanuman Highway, Parade Ground, Raffie's Majesty,
Yarrow Brae, Thomas Jo, Hot Wells and Basic Trainee. Two others
might enter: Grand Slam and Limit Out.
</P>
<P>
   Trainer breaks down: Trainer Elliott Walden is wearing a cast _
painted red and green, the colors of Victory Gallop owner
Prestonwood Farm _ on his dislocated right ankle. He was hurt in a
basketball game, battling for a loose ball against Matt Muzikar,
husband of jockey Julie Krone.
</P>
<P>
   Walden said he might ask Bill Mott to put the saddle on Victory
Gallop Saturday. ``I figure he'd be a good assistant,'' Walden said
of Mott, the two-time Eclipse Award-winning trainer of Cigar.
</P>
<P>
   Bygones?: Bob Baffert attributes Silver Charm's defeat in the
1997 Belmont Stakes to ``bad racing luck,'' believing the colt
would have won if he'd seen Touch Gold, who rallied on the outside
of Free House.
</P>
<P>
   David Hofmans, trainer of Touch Gold, scoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (Silver Charm) had two or three lengths (lead) on us
turning for home. He wasn't slowing down. (Gary) Stevens was riding
hard,'' Hofmans said last week at Hollywood Park. ``I think he got
beat by a better horse.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hofmans said he'd like to see Baffert-trained Real Quiet do
what Silver Charm couldn't _ complete the Triple Crown.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a special horse to win it,'' Hofmans said. ``It
doesn't matter who's in the field, if you win those three races,
you're a great horse.''
</P>
<P>
   Track bias?: The first four main-track races at Belmont on
Wednesday were won by front-runners.

FAREWELL TO BARRY GOLDWATER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE YOZWIAK  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ After a F-16 streaked into the sun at Wednesday's
memorial to Barry Goldwater, scores of visiting dignitaries turned
from their VIP chairs and filed one by one through a back door into
Tempe's Gammage Auditorium.
</P>
<P>
   Watching as Nancy Reagan, Bob Dole, Newt Gingrich and the others
approached the door was nine-year-old Rachael Theorin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eighty, eighty-one and eighty-two,'' Rachael counted, as she
totaled the number of who stepped over a plastic TV-cable cover, as
opposed the 200 officials who stepped on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to know,'' Rachael said of her count.
</P>
<P>
   Her friend, Megan Schoultz, 8, another third-grader at Aguilar
Elementary School in Tempe, needed another look at her program to
answer a reporter's question about why she had come to the event.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came to see the jets and to honor (hesitating as she looked
down) - uh, Barry Goldwater!'' Megan said.
</P>
<P>
   While a novelty for the young, something they can tell their
grandchildren about, Goldwater's memorial was a profound moment for
others.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a native Arizonan,'' said Margaret Livoni, 80, of Tempe.
``I've watched Barry for many years, and I've admired him for the
longest time,'' she said, sitting at the end of a row in the lower
balcony of the auditorium.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, Gammage was the perfect place to stage the
memorial.
</P>
<P>
   Parking was easy, the walk was short, and there was a seat for
anyone who wanted one. The building was full except for the last
five rows of the upper balcony.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, about 100 people stayed outside and listened to the
ceremony on loudspeakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a nice day,'' said Mike Pugh, 24, a business student at
adjacent Arizona State University,
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know a whole lot about him, except that he was
fair,'' Pugh said, sitting beneath a towering silk oak as a light
breeze made the nearly 90-degree temperatures somewhat pleasant.
</P>
<P>
   A few people fainted in the noon-day sun waiting for Goldwater's
cortege to arrive, including four members of a large Luke Air Force
Base contingent _ dressed in heavy, dress uniforms _ who lined the
walks to Gammage.
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. Frank Barlow, 24, a trumpeter with the 36th U.S. Army Band
of Ft. Huachuca, was awed by the spectacle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've participated in more than 400 funerals. This is
definitely the most visible. I just think it's a great honor,''
said Barlow, who hails from Bluefield, West Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday morning, at the public visitation in downtown Phoenix,
Carolynn Robinson reached out to touch the red and white stripes on
the flag over Barry Goldwater.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to remember that. I wanted to touch a piece of
history,'' said the Phoenix woman, one of many mothers who took
their children to visit Trinity Cathedral.
</P>
<P>
   Among the notables who arrived at Gammage was former Sen. Bob
Dole of Kansas who, like Goldwater, won his party's presidential
nomination, but lost to a southern Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barry was there for me when I needed him. I'm not just talking
about politics. I'm talking about our legislative work,'' said
Dole, making a distinction between lawmaking and running for
office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was one of 43 House members who supported him in '64,'' Dole
said of Goldwater's defeat at the hands of President Lyndon
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was there at the beginning, and I wanted to be here at the
finish,'' said Dole, who lost to President Clinton in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona Attorney General Grant Woods accompanied Dole:
</P>
<P>
   ``i think Barry Goldwater WAS Arizona. He was here from the
beginning, and he represents all that's best about us.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the question now is, how much of his spirt and
character do we carry forward? And I think the answer to that will
determine how well we do as a state,'' Woods said.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Newt Gingrich, also was touched by Goldwater.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was one of those who, as a high school student, read
``Conscience of a Conservative.'' I campaigned for Barry in '64. He
campaigned for me twice in '74 and '76,'' said the Georgia
Republican.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, it marks the passing of an era; of just a very great
man who had really done an amazing amount to stand up for
individual liberty, and the preservation of freedom.'' Gingrich
said.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Chen, (EDITORS: CQ, AS DISTINGUISHED FROM CHIEN BELOW )
an economic and cultural representative for the Republic of China,
the non-communist Chinese state that Goldwater championed, also
spoke of the former Arizona senator's dedication to freedom.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have always treasured his friendship and support for the
Republic of China. He's one of the few true friends of the Republic
of China over the past six decades,'' said Chen, who accompanied
the speaker of the Republic of China's National Assembly, Fredrick
F. Chien.
</P>
<P>
   ``He always stood up for the cause of freedom and democracy. And
we considered him a man of principles; a man of great bravery and
courage,'' said Chen.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone who attended the event remembered Goldwater fondly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barry Goldwater, without any doubt in my mind, was the most
important person in making me be interested in politics,'' said
Louis Rhodes, former Arizona executive director of the American
Civil Liberties Union.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he taught me enough (about politics) so that when I was
old enough to vote, I never voted for him,'' said Rhodes, who
nevertheless felt compelled to attend the memorial.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the auditorium, Pastor Fred Phelps of the Westboro
Baptist Church, led his Topeka, Kan., congregation in one of its
many pickets against those, who, like Goldwater, have supported gay
rights and abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. J.D. Hayworth, R-Ariz., at first claimed he didn't
notice the protesters, though he obviously knew their message.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live in a free society,'' Hayworth said.
</P>
<P>
   ``While I think there are better ways to cherish one's memory, I
also know that if Barry was about anything, he was about freedom of
the individual, and even those who would sadly use this occasion to
try to further their political agendas.'' &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ While St. John's decides whether hiring a big name
like George Washington's Mike Jarvis as men's basketball coach is
worth the investment _ the Red Storm could acquire one of its other
candidates for half the price _ Jarvis has begun to waver, too.
With his position at George Washington strained because of his
flirtations with other jobs, Jarvis would like to avoid keeping GWU
on hold.
</P>
<P>
   Jarvis earned $600,000 last year and is seeking at least
$800,000 to make the move to St. John's.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jarvis is not going to let it drag on,'' a person close to the
negotiations said. ``At some point, he's going to say, `Take my
name out of the running.'''
</P>
<P>
   Siena's Paul Hewitt, Davidson's Bob McKillop and St.
Bonaventure's Jim Baron were also interviewed for the position last
week. But since the interviews, the coaches have not been
contacted. &QL;

BARRY GOLDWATER REMEMBERED IN SPEECHES, MUSIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MURPHY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Arizona and the nation's political leadership honored
former Sen. Barry Goldwater Wednesday, saying good-bye to the
American icon with a funeral service punctuated by tears and
laughter.
</P>
<P>
   More than 3,000 mourners, including former First Lady Nancy
Reagan, 30 U.S. Senators and four decades' worth of Arizona
political figures, filled ASU's Grady Gammage Auditorium to
remember Goldwater's life as a military leader, a politician, a
brother and a father.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that if you were to go anywhere in this country,
virtually anywhere in the world, you would discover that there are
two Arizonans who are literally known throughout this planet. One
is Geronimo and the other is Barry Goldwater,'' said Interior
Secretary and former Arizona Gov. Bruce Babbitt.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt carried a message from President Clinton to the
Goldwater family that read, ``Few Americans in our history have
served the people with such a remarkable blend of conviction,
integrity and basic decency.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us who knew Barry were lifted by the sparkle in his
eyes, the warmth of his heart, the depth of his humanity,'' the
message from Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Goldwater's funeral drew two planeloads of Senators and House
members, including Speaker Newt Gingrich, Senate Majority Leader
Trent Lott, North Carolina Republican Sens. Strom Thurmond and
Jesse Helms, and Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   Also on hand were California Gov. Pete Wilson, former Sen. Bob
Dole, former vice president Dan Quayle and former U.S. House
minority leader John Rhodes of Arizona. Gov. Jane Hull and five of
her predecessors, Fife Symington, Rose Mofford, Babbitt, Jack
Williams and Paul Fannin were in attendance.
</P>
<P>
   Goldwater died Friday at his Paradise Valley home. He was 89.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, thousands of Arizonans have paid tribute to the man
known as ``Mr. Arizona'' at the downtown Phoenix church where he
was baptized. Early Wednesday, dozens began up outside Gammage to
ensure a seat for the funeral service.
</P>
<P>
   An Air Force honor guard carried Goldwater's casket, draped with
the American flag, into the auditorium. The service was presided
over by Rabbi Albert Plotkin and the Rev. Carl Carlozzi, rector of
All Saints Episcopal Church.
</P>
<P>
   Six grandssons, including Barry Goldwater III and Michael
Goldwater Jr., served as pallbearers. Family members, including his
second wife, Susan, followed behind as hundreds lined along the
street watched in silence.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, Goldwater's casket was flanked by Organ Pipe cactus and
backlit by a photo of the Grand Canyon.
</P>
<P>
   The five-term senator, born when Arizona was still a territory,
was hailed as the state's favorite son, a man who put Arizona on
the map and who spearheaded the conservative movement in America.
</P>
<P>
   Native American flutist Robert Tree Cody also honored
Goldwater's longtime relationship with the Native American
community with a flute solo and a prayer, ``You are a great man,
you are with the elders now. You are a chief.
</P>
<P>
   ``My people will never forget you as long as we shall live,''
said Cody, a Maricopa and Dakota Indian.
</P>
<P>
   John McCain, who succeed Goldwater in Senate in 1987, may have
summed up Goldwater's political legacy the best.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barry Goldwater served America, all of America, a country
conceived in liberty, a country that let you pledge any damn thing
you wanted as long as it didn't cost someone else their liberty.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all the history of American politics, he will remain a
chapter unto himself. The rest of us will have to make do with
footnotes.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Jon Kyl also spoke, as did longtime Goldwater friend Ron
Crawford, who concluded by saying, ``You really had class. Goldie,
you were really some kind of a guy. Hasta la vista, my friend.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Goldwater's youngest brother, Bob, though, who evoked
gales of laughter as he sweetly recalled Barry Goldwater's hijinks
as a young man and as a manager in the family's retail business.
</P>
<P>
   He brought down the house when he recalled how Goldwater devised
``antsy pants'' men's boxer shorts with ``big red ants'' on them.
</P>
<P>
   The ad slogan was, ``You rant and dance with antsy pants.``
</P>
<P>
   ``We ran that ad in ``The New Yorker,'' and we sold those shorts
in every state in the nation. It was unbelievable,'' Bob Goldwater
said.
</P>
<P>
   The audience chuckled as he also recalled how his brother ``had
a great taste for things that were pretty.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He could buy dresses for women,'' Goldwater recalled, pausing
before adding, ``and sell them.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldwater's son, Barry Jr., touchingly concluded the ceremony by
promising that Goldwater's extensive family would carry on his
legacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to wish you, ``Happy trails, Dad.'' &QL;

CAPITALS INSISTING HASEK ISN'T MAKING THEM EDGY 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By TARIK El-BASHIR    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ODENTON, Md. _ Mind games are a big part of playoff hockey.
</P>
<P>
   Refusing to divulge the status of injured players, changing the
visiting team's practice time without notice and exchanging barbs
through the news media are standard practice in June.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington-Buffalo series has had its fair share of these
trivial pursuits.
</P>
<P>
   But with the four-of-seven-game Eastern Conference finals, which
the Capitals lead, 3-2, shifting to Buffalo for a sixth game on
Thursday, the Sabres have an edge _ the world's best goalie,
Dominik Hasek.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, Hasek stole a game for his team, pulling out a page
from his Olympic diary on Tuesday night at the MCI Center.
</P>
<P>
   Breakdown after defensive breakdown, Hasek saved his team with a
variety of eye-popping stops from almost every position imaginable.
The Sabres were outworked and outplayed by the Capitals and still
won as Hasek, an Olympic gold-medal-winning goalie, stopped 34
shots en route to a 2-1 Sabres victory.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, Sabres Coach Lindy Ruff said he thought that
Hasek might be ``in their heads'' a bit.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Wilson, the Capitals' coach, snapped back, ``He's not in our
heads, trust me.''
</P>
<P>
   But by the middle of the third period, the mounting frustration
could be seen in the faces and reactions of the Washington players
as the Buffalo goalie turned away every puck hurled in his
direction.
</P>
<P>
   Hasek stopped the Capitals' sniper, Peter Bondra, not once, but
twice, on breakaways.
</P>
<P>
   Two times, Hasek closed the door on Adam Oates, who was standing
on Hasek's doorstep with the puck on his stick and a wide-open net
staring him in the face.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Juneau, too, was foiled by Hasek from point-blank range.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a couple of casual moments around the net,'' Wilson
said, ``and with Dominik you can't be casual. You can't think, `I
have an empty net, I'll make this one pretty.'''
</P>
<P>
   It was surely Hasek's best game of the tournament, and was
probably one the Sabres had no business winning.
</P>
<P>
   Hasek's show-stopping performance left the Capitals deflated. It
left their coach exasperated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to play the same way we did yesterday,'' Wilson
said Wednesday after some of the Capitals practiced at the team's
facility outside Annapolis. ``If we play like that, I like our
chances. But if you can't score on Dominik, then there is not much
we can do. We have to find a way to put the puck past Dominik. He's
a great goalie.''

NANCY REAGAN, SUSAN GOLDWATER SHARED ROLE OF CAREGIVER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MAUREEN WEST  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Nancy Reagan, who was in the Valley on Wednesday for
Barry Goldwater's funeral, has been in touch with Susan Goldwater
over the past year to participate in what may have been one of the
most exclusive support groups in America.
</P>
<P>
   While their husbands have a connection _ Goldwater was Reagan's
political mentor _ the women also have a separate connection. Both
have served as caregiver second wives to former political leaders
suffering from age-related mental dementia. Both men served as
icons of American conservatism and have similar followings.
</P>
<P>
   Reagan has Alzheimer's disease, and Goldwater suffered the past
year from a form of dementia that kept him out of the public eye.
</P>
<P>
   Dementia is defined as the loss of at least two or more
important mental functions such as memory, language, visual or
spacial judgment due to a stroke, Alzheimer's disease or other
reasons. After Goldwater had a stroke, physicians said that it
triggered a form of dementia, though there were differences of
opinion over the diagnosis. While many people automatically think
of Alzheimer's, there are hundreds of types of dementia.
Alzheimer's accounts for 56 percent of dementia cases, however.
</P>
<P>
   Experts in the field have watched, from afar, with admiration
how Nancy Reagan and Susan Goldwater have eloquently and elegantly
handled difficult situations.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are fabulously strong women,'' said Geri Hall, a
clinical nurse specialist at Scottsdale's Mayo Clinic who has
worked with families of dementia patients for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Susan Goldwater was not just in charge of her husband's care,
which any dementia patient's family will tell you is no easy task,
but she has also been in charge of Barry Goldwater's historical
reputation. Like Nancy Reagan, she has handled the responsibility
seriously _ role models for those of us who may have to deal with
this in the future,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   With more people living longer, the chances of more people
suffering from Alzheimer's or another form of dementia is expected
to triple over the next 40 years. For those 85 and older, the
chances of having a form of dementia are as high as 50 percent.
Goldwater was 89.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether a family chooses to be very public about it, like the
Reagans, or more private, like the Goldwaters, it's a difficult
path. No single way to handle the situation is more correct,'' Hall
said. ``The family has to keep in mind what the patient would want.
</P>
<P>
   ``For any patient, there is a tremendous need to preserve
dignity, but that is a challenge for a public figure. Some social
activists will want the celebrity's disease to be made public, to
show that anyone can get the disease and de-stigmatize others who
suffer from it.''
</P>
<P>
   The celebrity attention can bring more dollars to medical
research, which has been a conscious objective of Nancy Reagan's
public open-door attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message is, if Ronald Reagan can get Alzheimer's, anyone
can get it,'' Hall observed.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as the '60s and '70s, dementia was regarded as a
mental frailty, not a specific disease. That came in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Many people with dementia withdraw from society, according to
Hall. They often have auditory and language problems. Some also
have visual and spacial problems, and may not feel comfortable with
visitors. It isn't uncommon for someone with dementia to simply
leave a room when visitors arrive or to make inappropriate
statements.
</P>
<P>
   For someone who will be remembered for great accomplishments,
caregivers may feel an extra obligation to choreograph a dignified
last chapter. Whatever they do, however, caregivers will be
criticized _ they are either denying access or providing too much
exposure, depending on the sensibilities of different family
members, friends or supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us have a responsibility to protect our loved ones, but
this is almost a historical responsibility these two women have
had,'' Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Goldwater Jr. thanked Susan Goldwater publicly at the
memorial service at ASU on Wednesday for her professional knowledge
about end-of-life issues and the love she gave to his father.
</P>
<P>
   This week will not be the end of that curatorial work for Susan
Goldwater.
</P>
<P>
   What she learns will undoubtedly be shared with her friend,
Nancy. &QL;

MTA Renews Pact With Korey Kay
</P>
<P>
   The Metropolitan Transportation Authority in New York said on
Wednesday that as expected it had renewed its advertising contract
with Korey Kay &AMP; Partners &UR;  &LR;  in New York for another three-year
term. Billings were estimated at $10 million for 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Korey Kay, which has handled the MTA account since 1992, kept
the assignment after a five-month mandated review that included New
York-based agencies whose identities were not disclosed. Korey
Kay's recent campaigns for the MTA included the introduction of the
Metrocard and commercials featuring the voice of the actor Mandy
Patinkin.  &QL; 
Three Companies Decide on Accounts
</P>
<P>
   Three advertisers have made decisions on their accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Parmalat USA Corp. in Teaneck, N.J., a subsidiary of the Italian
food company Parmalat SpA, named Arnell Group Brand Consulting in
New York to handle its account, which had been handled by MgM &AMP;
Partners in New York. Billings have not been determined.
</P>
<P>
   Arnell Group was awarded the account after a four-month review
that also included seven agencies whose identities were not
disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson Hewitt in Virginia Beach, Va., the tax preparation
service unit of the Cendant Corp., named Grey Advertising in New
York to handle its account, which had been handled by the Burford
Agency in Virginia Beach. Billings were estimated at $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   The decision came after a two-month review that included
Burford, Grey and the Fairfax, Va., office of Arnold
Communications, a unit of Snyder Communications. Grey is the media
buying agency of record for Cendant and also handles advertising
for the company's Super 8 motel chain.
</P>
<P>
   And National Discount Brokers in New York named
Hampel/Stefanides in New York to handle its account, with billings
estimated at $7 million. The account had been handled for the last
year by Earle Palmer Brown in Bethesda, Md.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Rezak, vice president for marketing at National Discount
Brokers in New York, part of National Discount Brokers Group, said
the decision came after a two-month review that included
Hampel/Stefanides and three other finalists: DiNoto Lee in New
York, Partners &AMP; Simons in Boston and Stein Rogan &AMP; Partners in New
York.  &QL; 
Two Executives On the Move
</P>

chairwoman and chief creative officer at the agency, was named to
succeed him. Ms. Hayden will work with Tom Carroll, chief operating
officer, and retain her creative tasks.
</P>
<P>
   And Jeffrey Cunningham, publisher of Forbes magazine since 1993,
is leaving to open his own multimedia company that will start and
acquire media businesses. Forbes Inc. in New York, parent of the
magazine, is expected to become a minority partner in the new
company.

   BELLSOUTH TO BEGIN OFFERING TV SERVICE TO ATLANTA
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth Corp. plans to announce Thursday that it has begun to
offer television service to Atlanta residents using digital
wireless technology. The company says it will offer the service,
which includes more than 160 channels, to more than 700,000
households in the Atlanta area.
</P>
<P>
   The service's introduction there is expected to be good news for
Americast, a television venture of BellSouth, Ameritech, GTE,
Southern New England Telecommunications and Walt Disney. Americast
is locked in a legal battle with SBC Communications Inc., which has
withdrawn from the group, over whether SBC owes the venture more
money. The service began in New Orleans last fall, and BellSouth
plans to expand it to cover more than two million homes in Florida
by the end of the year.

PATAKI AND D'AMATO STAR AS REPUBLICANS MEET
</HEADLINE>
   (dc) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Flush with money, politically dominant and free of
outward signs of ideological turmoil, state Republicans began
gathering here Wednesday night determined to transform their
two-day nominating convention into the equivalent of a 48-hour
campaign advertisement for Gov. George Pataki and Sen. Alfonse
D'Amato.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican convention stands in testimony to how the party's
fortunes have changed. Four years ago, the gathering was seized
with turmoil as party leaders, bowing to pressure from D'Amato,
narrowly nominated Pataki, a little-known state senator from
Peekskill, to challenge Mario Cuomo. Pataki's victory and
subsequent rise in the polls affirmed D'Amato's judgment and
largely accounts for the party's standing as its members began
checking in at the Sheraton New York Hotel and Towers for two days
of tightly scripted proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got their stuff tight,'' said Bill Lynch, a senior
Democratic strategist who managed campaigns for former Mayor David
Dinkins in New York. ``I wish the Democrats had their act together
like the Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike in the Democratic Party, there will almost certainly be
no primaries for the Republican nomination to run for any statewide
office.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki, D'Amato and William Powers, the state Republican
chairman, took care of that in one last conference call on Tuesday
in which they chose a candidate for state comptroller, a county
legislator from Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   That said, the efficiency that Republicans are promising this
week does not necessarily speak to the health of their candidates.
</P>
<P>
   In another contrast between now and 1994, there has been a
political role reversal between Pataki and D'Amato. It is Pataki
this time who is the confident political figure in the Republican
Party, and it is he, rather than D'Amato, who seems more certain of
re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Interviews with D'Amato and Pataki suggested how much their
places had shifted. The three-term senator left no doubt that he
was looking to Pataki to help him survive what could be a difficult
challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's going to help the ticket _ and help me,'' D'Amato
said. ``A strong run on his part can't do anything but help.''
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato linked himself to Pataki at every turn in the interview.
``I'm hoping that we're going to have an opportunity to really
reflect on the accomplishments of the governor, of the
administration, in the past four years,'' he said. ``We have worked
successfully as a team. We have been delivering. When people say we
couldn't do it, we continued to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Pataki mentioned D'Amato only when prompted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not coordinating; we don't have to,'' Pataki said.
``The state and the federal issues are different, but the
principles are the same. I'm fighting for New York and they're
fighting for New York. Our tough approach to crime, our commitment
to expanding our tax burden are being effectively advanced here and
in Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Pataki and D'Amato, the party is expected
formally to nominate Mary Donohue, 51, who is a State Supreme Court
justice in Rensselaer, as lieutenant governor; Dennis Vacco to seek
a second term as attorney general, and Bruce Blakeman, the
presiding officer of the Nassau County Legislature, to run for
state comptroller.
</P>
<P>
   The convention comes in the midst of what has been a coordinated
effort by Pataki to try to win as much publicity for his campaign
as possible. He announced his choice of a running mate last week
and his own candidacy on Sunday. And he began this week with a
heavy schedule of television advertising, just less than $1.5
million worth, that will last a little more than a week.
</P>
<P>
   The choreography notwithstanding, the convention could have at
least a few interesting moments. Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, a
Republican who last time endorsed Cuomo against Pataki, will be a
somewhat regular figure at this one. Both Giuliani and Pataki were
invited to a private dinner put on Wednesday night by State Sen.
Roy M. Goodman, the Manhattan Republican chairman.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dinner party will clearly be a love-in: the mayor and the
governor,'' Goodman said optimistically in an interview before any
bread was broken. ``Each knows the other will be there and they
accepted. That's an indication of their unity of purpose. No mud
pies here.''
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, Giuliani and Pataki never crossed paths.

   Skeptics of Real Quiet not slowing down
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By ALAN TRUEX &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ELMONT, N.Y. _ When Real Quiet won the Kentucky Derby, he was
faulted for being laggardly. His meager half-length triumph was
attributed to a ``perfect trip'' from jockey Kent Desormeaux on the
second-best horse in a third-rate field.
</P>
<P>
   Real Quiet answered those charges with a 2\-length breakaway
victory in the Preakness Stakes. So now, the experts are saying he
was too fast for his own good, that he ran the race of his life and
can't have enough left to win Saturday's Belmont Stakes and claim
the first Triple Crown in 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of confidence in Real Quiet is reflected by the size of
the Belmont field, which is expected to be 11 or 12 when it's
finalized this morning.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, a horse gunning for a Triple Crown finds challengers
scarce at Belmont Park. The 11 Triple Crown winners all faced fewer
than eight horses in the final leg of the series. Last year, Silver
Charm encountered only six but finished behind one of them, Touch
Gold.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here, they're throwing more shooters at me,'' said Bob
Baffert, who trains both Silver Charm and Real Quiet.
</P>
<P>
   But the numbers do not worry him. ``I think Real Quiet and
Victory Gallop are the two,'' he said. ``There's not a lot
separating them.''
</P>
<P>
   Victory Gallop, owned by Jack, J.R. and Art Preston of The
Woodlands, was second in both the Derby and Preakness, but trainer
Elliott Walden isn't resigned to being a bridesmaid again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be pie in the sky,'' Walden said Wednesday, ``but I
think the tables can be turned.''
</P>
<P>
   The connections for three other horses also are hoping for
improvement off the Preakness. Classic Cat, Hot Wells and Basic
Trainee ran third, fourth and eighth, respectively, in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of horses ran in the middle of the Derby pack and
bypassed the Preakness but are committed to the Belmont: Parade
Ground, co-owned by Houstonian Will Farish, and Hanuman Highway,
who lost by a head to Victory Gallop in the Arkansas Derby.
</P>
<P>
   Also probable are four newcomers to the series: Limit Out,
Yarrow Brae, New York-bred Raffie's Majesty and Texas-bred Thomas
Jo.
</P>
<P>
   Grand Slam, the second-ranked 2-year-old of 1997, is uncommitted
but may be in the pool when post positions are drawn this morning.
He won the recent Grade II Peter Pan Stakes, signaling recovery
from surgery on his left hind leg. But trainer D. Wayne Lukas isn't
sure he's ready for a mile and a half.
</P>
<P>
   One reason Real Quiet is considered vulnerable is that after an
exceptionally strong race, a horse is supposed to ``bounce,'' which
in racing parlance is a temporary decline in performance.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Brown, creator of the Thoro-Graph Sheets that are widely
utilized by horsemen on the East Coast, said that when he factors
in the difficulty of Real Quiet's wide run from the outside (10th)
post, ``I make it one of the fastest if not the fastest Preakness
since 1982.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Derby, the Thoro-Graph's best score actually went to
Victory Gallop, who came from the unfavorable No. 13 post, while
Real Quiet started from the third slot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we should have won the Derby,'' Walden said. ``We
had a much harder, wider trip than Real Quiet. The public saw what
we saw, so they made Victory Gallop the favorite in the Preakness.
But he flat-out beat us, pure and simple. We were disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   He became more disappointed _ and ``apprehensive'' _ when
Victory Gallop subsequently developed a severe skin rash. But now,
the son of Cryptoclearance, runner-up in the 1987 Belmont, is back
to full health.
</P>
<P>
   It's Walden who is under par, his left leg in a cast (red and
green, to match Prestonwood Farm's colors) because of a broken
ankle suffered in a pickup basketball game.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he is in good spirits, happy with his colt's brisk
59-second, five-furlong work Sunday and his easy 1{-mile gallop
Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Walden, who is only 35 but ranks ninth nationally in earnings
this year, said, ``This horse has turned the corner in the past few
days. He has a very big chance to win the Belmont.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown said Victory Gallop ``has as good a shot as Real Quiet,
which means he'll be the right bet because he'll be longer odds.
Real Quiet goes into the Belmont with the same problem Victory
Gallop faced in the Preakness. He's coming off his fastest race
ever.''
</P>
<P>
   And that may not be a good thing for him.

JUDGE BLOCKS LAW BANNING SEX LITERATURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (ja)  
 By ROBERT HANLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ A federal judge has temporarily blocked a
wide-ranging law in New Jersey that bans sexually explicit
literature and other material from the state prison housing chronic
sex offenders.
</P>
<P>
   Two inmates serving long terms for sexual assault had filed a
lawsuit earlier this year contending that the law violated their
First Amendment rights. In response to their suit, Judge Alfred
Wolin of Federal District Court here issued an order on Monday
preventing the law from taking effect at the Adult Diagnostic and
Treatment Center in Avenel, N.J. The prison is reserved for inmates
judges have classified as ``repetitive and compulsive'' sex
offenders. Wolin also ordered a hearing on the constitutional
issues on June 16.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Lustberg, a court-appointed lawyer for the two inmates,
said Wednesday that he was prepared to argue that the law was a
form of censorship that was unjustified unless the state could show
that the ban dealt with security concerns at the prison or another
operational issue.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Christie Whitman signed the law in January after both
houses of the state Legislature unanimously passed it. The
legislation grew out of a state task force's visit to the prison in
1995. The group was studying repeat offense rates among child
molesters and analyzing the effectiveness of Avenel's treatment.
During the tour, some members of the task force said they were
startled to see pinup pictures of naked women and copies of
sexually explicit magazines in some cells.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Avenel officials told task force members that some
sexually explicit materials other than child pornography and
material considered legally obscene had rehabilitative benefits for
some inmates, Lustberg said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But a task force member and sponsor of the law, Assemblywoman
Marion Crecco, R-Bloomfield, said she doubted that the material was
worthwhile. ``It's almost like giving drugs to drug addicts,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The law forbids inmates to receive, possess, distribute or
display publications, pictures or films containing ``sexually
oriented'' material. It defines sexually oriented as ``any
description, narrative account, display or depiction of sexual
activity or associated anatomical areas.''
</P>
<P>
   In a May 21 decision that let the inmates' suit proceed, another
federal district Court judge here, Joel Pisano, called the law
``arguably overbroad.'' He said New Jersey's ``sweepingly broad''
ban did not address any penological interests that would justify
the law's restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit was written by Richard Waterman, a 41-year-old
paralegal in Avenel's law library who is serving a 54-year term for
first-degree sexual assault, and Michael Curtis, 56, who is serving
a 20-year term for second-degree sexual assault. Curtis works in
the prison's store for inmates.

   NEW YORK _ The Brooklyn Navy Yard was among 12 sites in New York
designated Wednesday by Gov. George Pataki as enterprise zones.
</P>
<P>
   The new zones were for areas of the state that had lost jobs
because of military and defense cutbacks. Previously, the zones
were designated simply because the areas were economically
depressed.
</P>
<P>
   Enterprise zones provide incentives to businesses such as wage
tax credits, employee tax credits, capital investment tax credits,
sales and local tax relief as well as low-cost power agreements
with utilities.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, there are almost 100,000 New Yorkers employed at more
than 2,000 businesses in the state's enterprise zones, which have
attracted more than $2.7 billion in investment since 1987.
</P>
<P>
   The other zones designated Wednesday are in Clinton, Seneca,
Oneida, Herkimer, Albany, Orange, Suffolk, Broome, Montgomery,
Tioga, Onondaga and Chautauqua counties. &QL;

REAL QUIET'S OWNER LAID BACK ON THE TRACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELMONT, N.Y. _ Last year, when Silver Charm raced for the Triple
Crown, owners Bob and Beverly Lewis of Newport Beach rented a jumbo
jet and flew more than 100 friends and business associates to New
York to watch the Belmont Stakes.
</P>
<P>
   This week, with Real Quiet chasing the history that eluded
Silver Charm, owner Mike Pegram of Mount Vernon, Wash., thought
about emulating the Lewises and throwing a Belmont-bound party at
36,000 feet. He decided that would be impractical.
</P>
<P>
   The problem wasn't the cost; for Pegram, money is rarely an
object in the way of a good time. The problem was that Pegram has
too many friends in too many places.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming the plane took off from Los Angeles, ``it would have
had to make stops in Seattle and Phoenix and Mike's hometown in
Indiana and Louisiana to pick up Kent's family,'' said Brian Beach,
a Pegram friend who used to be jockey Kent Desormeaux's agent.
</P>
<P>
   Pegram settled for flying 24 people here on a pair of business
jets. But he said almost 200 other friends and relatives will get
to Belmont on their own Saturday to cheer Real Quiet's bid for the
first Triple Crown sweep in 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's still friends with people he was friends with 30 years
ago,'' said Brad McKinzie, a Los Alamitos Race Course executive who
has known Pegram for a decade. ``I don't think he's ever lost a
friend.''
</P>
<P>
   But Pegram, a 46-year-old grandfather who dropped out of
business school and made his money owning 22 McDonald's franchises
in Washington state, seems to have offended the thoroughbred-racing
bluebloods with his fun-loving good ol' boy demeanor.
</P>
<P>
   He hates to wear a tie. He toasts victories with beer instead of
champagne or Crown Royal. He tests the Jockey Club censors by
giving horses suggestive names like Isitingood and Loveontherail,
the latter referring to the legend of how he and a girlfriend
celebrated Pegram's first major win, Thirty Slews' upset in the
1991 Breeders' Cup Sprint in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   A critic in a New York newspaper described him as ``straight off
the set of Hee Haw.'' The writer might be the only person to meet
Pegram and not like him.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, before the six-week Del Mar season, Pegram bought a
condo overlooking the racetrack, a home that belonged to former San
Diego Padres second baseman Roberto Alomar.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `When's the housewarming party?''' Beech said. ``He
said, `Buddy, it starts now and ends Sept. 10.'
</P>
<P>
   ``And that's how it was. He'd have a barbecue just about every
night, and people would show up who he didn't even know. By the end
of the night, everybody swapping stories, they'd be friends.''
</P>
<P>
   The next day, you might see Pegram and a new friend holding
either end of an ice chest, lugging beer into the Del Mar infield.
</P>
<P>
   That casual style got him barred from a Florida saddling paddock
_ for wearing short pants on a 90-degree day. That casual style
ruffled Churchill Downs officials on Kentucky Derby day _ when
Pegram held up the winner's circle ceremony so all 50 of the
Friends of Mike in attendance could crowd into the photo.
</P>
<P>
   Pegram grew up around little Ellis Park in Kentucky, got into
ownership as a partner in his father's cheap horses, and had his
first success when he teamed up with trainer Bob Baffert in the
quarter-horse game in the mid-1980s. If there's anything calculated
about Pegram, it's his determination not to forget his small-time
start.
</P>
<P>
   The beer-drinking, hamburger guy takes on the Sport of Kings.
Pegram likes that image.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a horse fan who ended up owning horses, so my roots have
always come from the racing fan,'' he said the other day. ``And I
think that's one thing in this sport that we have to understand,
that if it wasn't for the fans, there wouldn't be any breeders and
owners because there wouldn't be a product.''
</P>
<P>
   Pegram's ``new money'' makes him more typical of thoroughbred
owners in the '90s _ especially in California _ than the Phippses,
Whitneys and Vanderbilts who dominated the sport in its fatter
days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people like to go to five-star restaurants for lunch. I
prefer to go to McDonald's,'' Pegram said. ``It's the same at the
racetrack. I'm comfortable being casually dressed. I go where my
friends are, and most of them are horseplayers who hang out at the
rail more than the turf club. I didn't grow up in that
(coats-and-ties) tradition. I grew up in the stands and that's
where I want to stay.''
</P>
<P>
   His brother, Jim, a jockey agent in California, thinks the ``Hee
Haw'' accent is partly a put-on, Mike's way of suckering business
rivals. And Pegram has done very well in business, well enough to
keep 20 racehorses in training with Baffert, at an estimated cost
of $25,000 a year _ each.
</P>
<P>
   But he and Baffert have done well with cheaply bought horses.
Only one of Pegram's thoroughbred stakes winners cost more than
$100,000. He got Real Quiet at an auction for $17,000.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, he got a Derby winner, a potential Triple Crown
winner, for the price of a car. Who wouldn't want to have beers
with a guy like that?

JURY DELIBERATES DEATH SENTENCE FOR EX-JAIL GUARD
</HEADLINE>
 PENALTY-TRIAL-NYT  (dc) 
 By JOSEPH P. FRIED   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After a prosecutor urged a death sentence for a
``malignant'' triple killer and a defense lawyer appealed for
``justice tempered by mercy,'' a Brooklyn jury began deliberating
Wednesday whether to sentence a former jail guard to execution for
murdering three people during a robbery.
</P>
<P>
   In the first death penalty trial under New York state's
three-year-old capital punishment law, the same jury that on May 19
found Darrel Harris guilty of first-degree murder heard portrayals
of the convicted man that contrasted as sharply as did the
intensely voiced recommendations on a just penalty.
</P>
<P>
   The jury may sentence Harris to death by lethal injection or to
life in prison without the possibility of parole.
</P>
<P>
   After three hours of deliberation, the seven women and five men
on the jury recessed Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the mechanical, methodical execution of people,'' the
prosecutor, Jonathan Frank, said as he recalled how Harris _ the
former jail guard who the city had honored for saving another guard
during an inmate riot in the 1980s _ shot two victims in the head
execution-style and fatally stabbed the third in an illegal social
club in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Insisting that Harris, 40, had shown no genuine remorse for the
``searing, uncompromising cruelty'' with which he had
``slaughtered'' his victims while carrying out a robbery, Frank, an
assistant district attorney in Brooklyn, told the jurors: ``This
defendant has forfeited by his actions the right to his life. He
committed the type of crime for which the death penalty was
enacted.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in soft tones that seemed to enhance his graphic
images, the prosecutor urged the jurors to close their eyes and try
to imagine being the person who could plunge a knife into one of
his victims after seeing the ``terror in her eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   But shortly afterward, a lawyer for Harris, Colleen Brady,
repeatedly sought to convince the jurors that her client, although
he had committed ``horrible'' murders for which ``there is no
excuse, no justification,'' was not ``the worst of the worst'' and
not ``beyond redemption,'' and should be allowed to spend the rest
of his life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at the whole person,'' Ms. Brady said to the jurors, who
listened intently as she insisted that Harris was ``remorseful for
the pain and suffering he caused.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brady, who is with the Legal Aid Society's capital defense
unit, offered a picture of a man who not only lacked a criminal
record before this case but who in the past had shown ``there's
some value in him, some good in him,'' by saving a fellow
corrections officer who was being severely beaten by rioting
inmates _ an action for which Mayor Edward Koch awarded Harris a
medal in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brady contended that serious psychological problems,
stemming in part from the trauma of that jail violence, as well as
cocaine and alcohol abuse, had caused her client to plunge from
hero to triple killer.
</P>
<P>
   She argued that those mitigating factors had fueled the rampage
in which he killed Michael Harris, who was not related to the
former jail guard, Jerome Sims and Evelyn Davis _ and in which he
attempted to kill Eddie Brown, who survived a gunshot to the head.
</P>
<P>
   As Harris, his relatives and relatives of the victims listened
closely in the packed courtroom gallery, Ms. Brady stressed that
her client was not a mass murderer like Timothy McVeigh, who has
been sentenced to die for killing 168 people in the Oklahoma City
bombing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reject the call for blood,'' she declared to her client's
jury, holding that life in prison would give him ``time to look
inside and repent.''

ROUKEMA EARNS SLIM VICTORY IN PRIMARY 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Rep. Marge Roukema, a moderate Republican and veteran lawmaker,
survived a challenge from the party's conservative wing in primary
voting on Tuesday to win the nomination to run for a 10th term in
her northern New Jersey congressional district.
</P>
<P>
   It was a narrow victory for such an established lawmaker. She
got just 52 percent of the vote against Scott Garrett, who had the
support of abortion opponents and gun lobbyists. The narrow victory
prompted her to say: ``It proves how we have to pull together if we
want to remain the majority party. We have to find consensus
between the different wings of our party.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Roukema's Democratic challenger will be Mike Schneider, a
former television news anchor.
</P>
<P>
   In other primary voting in the state, Rush Holt, 49, a former
official of the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory, defeated Carl
Mayer, a wealthy Princeton attorney, to win the Democratic
nomination in the 12th Congressional District in central New
Jersey. Mayer had spent $453,000 on the campaign, much of it his
own money, and Holt spent $69,000.
</P>
<P>
   Holt, who had the endorsement of party leaders, will now face a
conservative one-term incumbent, Rep. Michael Pappas, in November.
Democrats have identified the race as a close one that may help
them win back the majority in the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other contested congressional races involving an
incumbent, Rep. Donald Payne, an Essex County Democrat, was an easy
winner with 91 percent of the vote in the 10th Congressional
District.
</P>
<P>
   In the Fourth Congressional District, Larry Schneider won the
Democratic nomination to face Rep. Christopher Smith, a nine-term
incumbent.
</P>
<P>
   In the 11th Congressional District, John Scollo won the
Democratic nomination to face Rep. Rodney Freylinghuysen, a
Republican.  &QL;

PROPOSALS FOR NEW ARENA MAY BE SOLICITED 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ Responding to the discontent expressed by the New
Jersey Nets and Devils sports franchises over their aging arena,
officials of the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority have
taken a first step toward possibly building a new basketball and
hockey arena in the Meadowlands, a spokesman for the authority said
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Authority officials have drafted, though not sent, a formal
request for proposals from stadium developers. The authority would
not offer details of what it would ask the developers to design,
but its spokesman, John Samerjan, said the agency had been looking
at the possibility of renovating or replacing the Continental
Arena.
</P>
<P>
   The authority will not send the request for proposals to
developers until it has at least the tacit approval of the sports
teams and Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, both teams have suggested that they might
leave the Meadowlands. The Devils' owner, John McMullen, has
proposed building a $175 million hockey arena over the train
station in Hoboken. Nets officials, meanwhile, have privately
suggested that the team could move to Newark or back to Long
Island, New York, where it played in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Rubenstein, a spokesman for the Nets, said the team had
not yet been informed of the full contents of the draft proposal
request. ``They are awaiting details of this proposal,'' he said.
``They haven't received the detailed plan and until then they'll
have no comment.'' McMullen, the owner of the Devils, was away from
his office and could not be reached by telephone for comment.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Nets' lease at the Continental Arena expires in 2020,
although there are clauses allowing renegotiations in 2000 and
2004. The Devils, who threatened to move to Nashville in 1995 after
winning the Stanley Cup, received a new lease deal that year that
runs through 2007. Both teams have expressed a desire for an
increased number of luxury boxes and other amenities.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Robinson, the authority's president, told The Star-Ledger
of Newark that the agency was prepared to send out the requests
``in the near future.'' The newspaper first reported the draft
proposal on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Samerjan and other officials emphasized that simply asking for
ideas from developers was not an indication that state officials
were committed to the construction of a new arena. He said
officials would need to see initial design ideas from developers
before considering exactly where in the Meadowlands a new arena
would be located and how it would be paid for.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since December 1997 the authority has talked about the fact
that in '98 it was entirely likely that we would be going through a
formal request for proposal process to investigate the future of
the arena,'' Samerjan said. ``We are still in the process of
preparing that process.''

EDITORIAL: AND NOW, THE HOT-DOG WAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, June 4:
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani likes to show that he cannot be swayed by
demonstrations. But we would like to urge him to take Wednesday's
protest by sidewalk vendors as a cue to ponder whether he has lost
a sense of proportion about his civility campaign. There is a
difference between making the streets safer and cleaner and making
war on the New Yorkness of New York City. In his zeal for order and
obedience, he must not destroy the lively street scene that is part
of the city's historic flavor. No one misses the squeegee men, but
do we really want to outlaw the corner hot-dog stand?
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's three appointees to the Sidewalk Vendor Review Panel
have agreed to ban vendors on 144 streets in Manhattan. The issue
is whether those who sell coffee or silk ties or incense cause too
much congestion, particularly in downtown Manhattan and the busier
areas of midtown. In the next few weeks the review panel is
expected to rule on dozens of additional complaints, most of them,
like earlier pleas, from owners of shops and restaurants or from
business improvement districts. Hundreds of vendors will be sent
rolling to other locations in about 60 days, banned from sidewalks
some of them have worked for years.
</P>
<P>
   The complaints against these vendors are understandable, on some
level. Under current rules they can set up carts on most
sidestreets, provided they are not blocking building entrances,
corners and hydrants. If their tiny canteens mean cheap and speedy
eats for a hungry pedestrian, they spell tough competition for
nearby fast-food restaurants. Part of the reason is that vendors
don't pay for employees or rent or even for tickets if their
customers litter the sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   City officials also argue that part of what they are doing is
enforcing established city laws, to control those illegal merchants
who roll out a table or a mat until the local police officer nudges
them along in a manner that is as old as the city's cobbled
streets.
</P>
<P>
   The real problem is that Giuliani's review panel has no real
definition of ``congestion'' and no real standards for what makes a
street inappropriate for vendors. Some instances of congestion are
apparently worse than others, leaving questions about whether the
term is too dependent on the clout of the person or organization
doing the complaining. As City Councilman Anthony Weiner put it,
the review panel's arbitrary targets were the result of
``sophisticated lobbying.''
</P>
<P>
   We have supported the review panel as a way to give more balance
to the vendors' eternal struggle for place, but now the panel needs
to have better criteria for judging whether a cart deserves its
corner. Perhaps the mayor and his staff should consider a proposal
by City Councilman Kenneth Fisher to allow one vendor per
intersection, with some flexibility for areas that could use more
or none at all. Picking the vendors for prime locations would be a
challenge, of course. Fisher is considering a lottery or rotation,
with some hope that longtime and law-abiding regulars could be
given priority.
</P>
<P>
   Any new system will never _ and should never _ totally eradicate
the hurly-burly nature of the city's pushcart trade. There must be
a better way for the city to hear the voices of the hot-dog vendors
and their customers, not just those who sell sandwiches or real
estate nearby.

ARIZONA CHANGES TO DAYLIGHT EXECUTION
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSIE STECKNER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   After 25 years and 17 deaths, Douglas Gretzler said he was
sorry, told friends and family they were loved and gave thanks for
life's lessons.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, he was put to death.
</P>
<P>
   Gretzler, 47, had been on Arizo na's death row longer than
anyone else and was the first person put to death during the
daylight hours.
</P>
<P>
   He was given two death sentences for the murders of a Tucson
couple in November, 1973 but confessed to killing 17 - nine at one
time, including two children - during a month-long rampage in
Arizona and California with partner Willie Steel man.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after 3 p.m. Wednesday, strapped to a gurney in the
state's small death house, Gretzler chose to make amends.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the bottom of my soul I am so deeply sorry and have been
for years for murdering Patricia and Michael Sandberg,'' he said,
his voice barely audible. ``Though I am being executed for that
crime, I apologize to all 17 victims and their families.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, he looked squarely at the three people standing closest to
him - two friends and a sister. His final words were to them and
his two daughters, who were not in the room.
</P>
<P>
   Gretzler became emotional as he told them he loved them in Roma
nian, saying, ``Yo teh you besk very much.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you for life lessons learned'', he added.
</P>
<P>
   His supporters held each other and wept quietly.
</P>
<P>
   With that, Gretzler mouthed the words ``I love you'' and then
``Bye'' twice.
</P>
<P>
   He appeared to move his hand slightly, as if signaling goodbye.
</P>
<P>
   Then, staring up at the ceiling, his chest heaved several times,
his lip fluttered, and he was pronounced dead three minutes later,
at 3:11 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The family members of three of Gretzler's victims were in the
wit ness room during the execution.
</P>
<P>
   Norman Parkin lost his brother Walter, sister-in-law, niece and
nephew.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, he said in a statement, ``Hopefully this will bring
some closure to a very sad chapter in our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack Earl, who lost his uncle, aunt, and two cousins, said he
once visited Gretzler in prison and for gave him long ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't forgotten what hap pened that November. I never
will,''he said. ``I hope that Douglas Gretzler's found his peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Gretzler's partner, Steelman, died in prison - losing his life
to liver disease instead of to the executioner.
</P>
<P>
   Through the years, Gretzler was kept alive in part because of
legal battles over his mental health at the time of the crime
spree.
</P>
<P>
   Gretzler claimed in court docu ments that he suffered
schizophrenia and a drug addiction. That latter, he said, left him
in a drug-induced psychosis and therefore temporarily insane when
the killings occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Gretzler and Steelman confessed to killing 17 people in Arizona
and California. They received nine life sentences, two death
sentences and were never convicted for the other murders.
</P>
<P>
   At first, the pair merely robbed their victims. But then, they
began killing to eliminate witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Two men in Mesa. A hitchhiker they robbed near Apache Junction.
Another couple, who had seen them with the Mesa men. A hitchhiker
near Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   Victims seven and eight were Michael and Patricia Sandberg, who
were tied up inside their Tucson apartment, held hostage and then
shot to death.
</P>
<P>
   Their last stop was the small farming town of Victor, Calif.,
the home of grocer Walter Parkin and his wife, Joanne.
</P>
<P>
   After stealing $4,000 from Walter Parkin, the killers lined up
seven victims in a walk-in closet.
</P>
<P>
   They tied them together at the feet and bound their hands.
</P>
<P>
   Gretzler shot each one in the back of the head, then shot the
two Parkin children, Robert, 9, and Lisa, 11.
</P>
<P>
   Killed are the Parkin family and their babysitter Debra Jean
Earl; her parents Richard and Wanda; her brother, Richard Jr., and
her fiance, Mark Lang.
</P>
<P>
   Gretzler spent his last days visit ing with famly and friends,
and eating a last meal of eggs, bacon, toast, coffee and soda pop.
</P>
<P>
   Gretzler was the 12th inmate executed in Arizona since the death
penalty was reinstated in 1992. He was the fourth to die this year.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, prison and court officials discussed the
possibility of holding an execution during the day. They said the
usual midnight hour was often inconvenient for attorneys arguing
cases, and judges ruling on them, particularly those in the East
Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Gretzler wasn't the first to die during the day. In 1995, inmate
Jimmy Wayne Jeffers was to be executed just after midnight but
last-minute appeals kept him alive until about 6 p.m. that day.

SCIENTISTS TRY TO UNDERSTAND BROWN TIDE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOHN T. McQUISTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAMPTON BAYS, N.Y. _ In 1985, microscopic brown algae
overwhelmed the Peconic Estuary at the eastern tip of Long Island.
The phenomenon became known as brown tide because it turned the
water a murky brown. It also scared away tourists and killed off
shellfish.
</P>
<P>
   More than a decade later, the cause of brown tide remains a
mystery.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there is new hope that we may soon be able to find some of
the answers,'' said the Suffolk County executive, Robert Gaffney,
as he welcomed the launching here Wednesday at Meschutt County Park
of three buoys designed by scientists at Brookhaven National
Laboratory to understand the reason for the algal blooms.
</P>
<P>
   In the last 12 years, brown tides have wiped out seven annual
shellfish crops valued at $3 million a season and have cost the
tourist industry on eastern Long Island more than $100 million
dollars, Gaffney said.
</P>
<P>
   Creighton Wirick, an oceanographer with Brookhaven laboratory
who heads the project, said the meter-long buoys were equipped with
detectors called fluorometers that measure the amount of
chlorophyll present in the water as a way of calculating the
concentration of brown tide algae in the water.
</P>
<P>
   Other detectors on the buoys will record the temperature of the
water, its salinity and its amount of dissolved oxygen. The
instruments are attached to a radio transmitter that will beam the
data to a computer at the laboratory every 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within 20 seconds of its arrival, the data will be available
over the Internet to scientists around the world who might be
working on similar projects,'' Wirick said.
</P>
<P>
   With the brown tide season fast approaching, some blooms have
already been detected in Flanders Bay at the western end of the
Peconic Estuary, where one of three buoys was placed. A second buoy
was anchored just west of Robins Island in Great Peconic Bay. The
third was positioned in West Neck Harbor off Shelter Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too early to tell whether there will be a damaging bloom
this summer,'' Wirick said. ``We've had two good years in a row,
and if this is a good one, we should have a great crop of
scallops.''
</P>
<P>
   Wirick said he hoped the data would help prove a theory held by
many Brookhaven scientists that the brown tide was caused by
alternate rainy and dry years and the presence of large amounts of
nitrogen in ground-water runoff. ``Our hypothesis is that while
there is a normal green algae in Peconic Bay, there is also always
some of these brown algae around,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In certain dry years, the brown tide excels and beats out the
normal green tide,'' he said. ``And since this has been a wet year
so far, the forecast for this summer is a good one.''
</P>
<P>
   John Marburgher, the director of Brookhaven National Laboratory,
said: ``The reasons why this phenomenon occurs still remain cloudy.
We hope the buoys will add a few more pieces to the puzzle.''

<P>
   Willis Coburn Armstrong, a former assistant secretary of state
for economic affairs, died on Sunday at his home in Arlington, Va.
He was 86.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, the Arlington Funeral Home said.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong, who was also an educator, was an assistant secretary
in Washington from 1972 to 1974. He had previously had positions
dealing with economic affairs and international trade.
</P>
<P>
   He graduated from the Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass., in
1929 and Swarthmore College in 1933. A year later he earned a
master's at Columbia University and started postgraduate studies in
Russian history and language.
</P>
<P>
   He taught at Columbia from 1934 to 1939, when he joined the
American Embassy in Moscow as an interpreter and translator. In
World War II he worked for the Lend-Lease Administration in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong was assistant dean of the Columbia School of
International Affairs from 1967 to 1969 and later a senior lecturer
in diplomacy, until 1971. He also taught as an adjunct professor at
Georgetown University in the '70s and as a lecturer on Soviet
affairs at the School of Advanced International Studies in
Washington from 1946 to 1958.
</P>
<P>
   Surviving are his wife, Louise Schaffner Armstrong, and a son,
Ian, of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Roger B. Sammon, a former executive at chemical and plastics
companies and a scholar of Napoleon's military strategies, died on
Saturday in Huntsville, Ala. He was 75.
</P>
<P>
   He died of complications from heart disease, said his son,
Richard.
</P>
<P>
   When he retired in 1983, Sammon was the general manager of the
North American plastic operations of Imperial Chemical Industries,
a British company. Before joining Imperial Chemical, Sammon was an
executive at Stein, Hall &AMP; Company, a chemical manufacturer. He
served as president of Stein, Hall's operations in Toronto and vice
president of the company's operations in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Sammon once owned more than 3,000 books and journals on
Napoleonic military history, which he donated to the University of
Delaware. He wrote articles and gave lectures on the military
strategies used by Napoleon, techniques he thought businesses could
use.
</P>
<P>
   He was a chief petty officer in World War II, serving in many
battles in the Pacific, including Iwo Jima and Okinawa. He
graduated from Columbia College in 1947.
</P>
<P>
   Sammon is survived by his wife, Mary B. Sammon, nine children
and 22 grandchildren.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, June 4:
</P>
<P>
   It was troubling to learn last month that U.S. intelligence
agencies had failed to spot the preparations for India's nuclear
testing. Now a review of the case shows that the cause was not an
isolated problem like the misinterpretation of a telling satellite
photo, but a more disturbing systemic failure. Many of the photos,
for instance, were not even closely examined. David Jeremiah, a
retired admiral who investigated the case for the Central
Intelligence Agency, has produced a stinging indictment of
Washington's espionage operations. President Clinton and Congress
need to make sure his report is not quietly shelved by the agencies
it lacerates.
</P>
<P>
   Jeremiah, a respected former vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff, found that Indian test preparations had gone unnoticed
because the United States has too few spies, too few photo analysts
and too little creative thinking among its top intelligence
officials. These conclusions echo general criticisms offered last
year by the House Intelligence Committee and recall critiques of
earlier years, none of which have made much difference.
</P>
<P>
   Information collected by satellites and other sophisticated spy
machines is only as good as the analysts who decipher and interpret
it. There are simply not enough of them to handle the avalanche of
images that pour into Washington every day. The National Imagery
and Mapping Agency, which does most of this work, assigned just one
analyst full time to track activities at India's test site. With an
annual budget of $27 billion, spy agencies have no excuse for a
manpower shortage in such a vital field as photo interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   The absence of productive spies is another familiar story. The
CIA had no one on the ground in India well enough connected to know
that nuclear testing was imminent. Recruiting, training and placing
agents overseas is not easy, but the CIA has long neglected this
work and favored new technologies instead.
</P>
<P>
   These core weaknesses were compounded by misjudgments at the
highest levels. Even though the new Hindu government in India
freely declared its interest in developing a nuclear arsenal,
intelligence officials in Washington doubted the commitment and did
not press their agencies to study India's nuclear activities.
Several analysts who follow Indian affairs blithely dismissed the
possibility of testing. The White House and State Department were
equally negligent in not questioning these assessments or directing
the intelligence agencies to look more carefully at India.
</P>
<P>
   The broader message inherent in the Jeremiah report is that the
CIA and its fellow espionage agencies are still drifting seven
years after the disintegration of their primary target, the Soviet
Union. The country has had five spy chiefs in the last seven years,
a sure formula for disarray. George Tenet, the latest director of
central intelligence, brought in Jeremiah and quickly accepted his
recommendations this week, a welcome sign of openness. But it
should not take an incident like the Indian failure or an outsider
like Jeremiah to draw Tenet's attention to chronic problems.

IN SHIFT, TOP DEMOCRAT SEEKS TO TIGHTEN PAROLE 
 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Giving in to one of Gov. George Pataki's top
election-year priorities, Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver said
Wednesday that he would agree to end parole for all violent felons,
reversing a position he had held all year and reiterated just a few
days ago.
</P>
<P>
   Silver, D-Manhattan, tied the change to a major expansion of
drug treatment programs as an alternative to prison for nonviolent
criminals, as well as mandatory schooling for inmates and increased
supervision of former inmates after release.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear whether Pataki, a Republican, and the
Republicans who control the State Senate, will accept the
conditions outlined in Silver's bill, which he introduced
Wednesday. Three years ago, the governor eliminated just the kind
of educational programs Silver now wants to make mandatory.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick McCarthy, a spokesman for Pataki, accused Silver of
using ``political gimmickry to link several issues that should be
examined separately.'' But he added that he could not rule out
accepting the conditions because the governor had not seen the
Silver bill.
</P>
<P>
   Silver said he expected his legislation to be approved next
week, when he plans to bring it before the Democratic-controlled
Assembly. It includes a provision requiring that all people who are
arrested, no matter how minor the charge, be held until their
fingerprints can be checked through a state computer to determine
whether they are wanted for any crimes.
</P>
<P>
   That proposal came in response to the killing last week of a New
York City police officer, Anthony Mosomillo, by a man whom the
police had arrested but then released before it was determined that
he was wanted for a parole violation.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, state lawmakers abolished parole for repeat violent
felons, but this year, Pataki has stepped up his call to eliminate
it for first-time violent offenders as well. He made the issue a
centerpiece of his State of the State address in January and named
his bill ``Jenna's Law,'' after a young woman, Jenna Grieshaber,
who was killed last year; the man charged with the crime had been
paroled.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Grieshaber's parents, Bruce and Janice, stood by Silver's
side on Wednesday, as they have stood alongside the governor at
news conferences. They called Silver's proposal a reasonable
compromise.
</P>
<P>
   It was clear that Silver was making a grudging concession to
political pressure. As recently as last week, he proposed leaving
it up to a judge to determine whether to deny parole at the time of
sentencing. But public opinion surveys show that the measure is
popular.
</P>
<P>
   Silver admitted that he had changed his plan in response to the
demands of other Assembly Democrats. ``I think the governor should
be very comfortable with the comprehensive bill we are putting
forward today,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   John McArdle, a spokesman for the Senate Republicans, said,
``We're saying, pass Jenna's Law, and then we can discuss other
issues of criminal justice reform.''
</P>
<P>
   Doing away with parole would mean more time in prison for many
criminals, swelling even more a prison population that has tripled
to almost 70,000 since 1982. Silver said his plan would address
that problem by diverting thousands of nonviolent felons each year
into drug and alcohol treatment programs. He would allow criminals
with substance-abuse problems to be sentenced to at least one year
in a residential drug treatment center instead of prison.
</P>
<P>
   The speaker conceded that the change would require a vast
expansion of the state's drug treatment system, but he contended
that treatment is cheaper than imprisonment. His plan would also
require the hiring of more parole officers, and teachers for
prisons.
</P>
<P>
   Under current law, most first-time felons receive
``indeterminate sentences,'' or a range of possible time in prison
_ for example, 1 to 3 years, or 5 to 15 years. The low end of the
sentence is always one-third of the maximum, and after a prisoner
has served the minimum time, he becomes eligible for parole. With
good behavior, parole is automatic after two-thirds of a sentence
has been served. Parole supervision ends when the maximum term
expires.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's proposal would not completely do away with parole, but
rather eliminate indeterminate sentencing in cases of violent
crimes. A judge would give a convicted violent felon a fixed
sentence, not a range, and discretionary parole would be
eliminated. Automatic parole with good behavior would come only
after 85 percent of the sentence had been served.
</P>
<P>
   Silver's parole plan is substantially the same as the
governor's, except that it would include 1 to 5 years of continued
supervision after a prisoner's maximum sentence has expired.

PIRATES BEAT METS, 3-0, FOR SWEEP 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ The initial impact of having Mike Piazza in the
Mets' lineup has apparently worn off.
</P>
<P>
   After a week of pounding out hits, the Mets were stifled
Wednesday night by a pitcher who carried a 2-7 record into the
game. The Pittsburgh right-hander Jon Lieber shut the Mets down on
four hits over eight shutout innings on his way to a 3-0 victory
that gave the Pirates a three-game sweep of the series at Three
Rivers Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Lieber, an 11-game winner last season, outdueled an extremely
unlucky Rick Reed (6-3), who saw his five-game winning streak end
in losing for the first time since April 21. Of his 64 pitches over
six innings, Reed, who allowed only two hits, made only one
mistake. It came on his first pitch of the game. And, as it turned
out, it cost him dearly.
</P>
<P>
   With an inside-out swing, Jermaine Allensworth rapped that first
pitch over first base and hustled to third with a triple when Butch
Huskey slipped near the right-field line trying to field the ball
on the wet outfield turf. Al Martin followed with a run-scoring nub
of a groundout up the first-base line.
</P>
<P>
   Reed, who struck out five and walked none in lowering his earned
run average to 2.37, was pretty much unhittable from then on. But
Lieber had the only run he would need.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Aramis Ramirez gave him two more with his first major
league hit. The 19-year-old Dominican rookie's bases-loaded two-run
double to left field off Greg McMichael in the seventh snapped an
0-for-24 skid and brought a well-deserved standing ovation from the
crowd of 17,691.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most special moment I've had in baseball,''
Ramirez said.
</P>
<P>
   These new Mets looked an awful lot like the old Mets in the last
three days. After punishing opposing pitching for 100 hits and 54
runs in Piazza's first seven games with the team, the Mets (31-23)
collected only 17 hits and five runs at Pittsburgh. And for the
first time as a Met, Piazza, who went 0 for 4, did not have a hit
in a game.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't as if the Mets did not have any chances in a game
played in only 2 hours 10 minutes. They stranded Carlos Baerga at
second with one out in the second and Huskey at third with two out
in the seventh; they left a runner on base in every inning
in-between.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving Huskey at third really hurt them. After Huskey singled
to right to open the Mets' seventh in what was still a 1-0 game, he
moved to third on Rey Ordonez's one-out line out to right. Manager
Bobby Valentine, sensing a rare chance against Lieber, summoned
Matt Franco to bat for Reed. Franco popped to third on the first
pitch to end the threat.
</P>
<P>
   When Reed departed, he had only faced one batter over the
minimum 18. He has given up two runs or less in each of his last
seven starts and in nine of his 11 starts this season.
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE PITCH
</P>
<P>
   According to a person familiar with a situation involving both
Dodgers general manager Fred Claire and Hideo Nomo's agent, Don
Nomura, the Dodgers have had serious discussions with three or four
teams regarding a possible trade of Nomo. The Baltimore Orioles are
apparently one of them. The Mets, who contacted Claire on Tuesday,
may be another. Nomo apparently would like to join the Mets, where
he would be reunited with his best friend, Masato Yoshii; his
former catcher, Mike Piazza, and his former pitching coach, Dave
Wallace. Manager Bobby Valentine said Wednesday that he would not
comment on whether he wanted Nomo on his staff or whether he had
spoken to Nomura since Nomo was designated for assignment on
Monday. Yoshii, meanwhile, left a message for Nomo on Monday in
which he said, ```Call me if anything's up.''' But Yoshii said he
had yet to hear back ... Valentine shuffled his rotation after
Yoshii's outing on Tuesday night was cut short after 24 pitches
because of a severe thunderstorm. He announced that Yoshii would
pitch the Sunday night game against the Boston Red Sox at Fenway
Park. Dave Mlicki (1-4), who was scheduled to pitch on Sunday, will
face the Tampa Bay Devil Rays next Tuesday, instead. The slumping
Mlicki said: ``Either way, it's fine. I kind of knew I was going to
get pushed back.'' ... The Pittsburgh Steelers held a mini-camp
before Wednesday night's game, and a number of Mets, including the
reliever Turk Wendell, participated in punting drills ... Brian
Mcrae was given a rest from the starting lineup because of a tight
right hamstring ... Right-hander Jason Isringhausen (elbow surgery)
has returned to Florida from his Illinois home to begin
rehabilitation.

PAC-10 CONSIDERS ADDING CONFERENCE GAME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The agenda for this week's Pacific-10 Conference gathering in
Newport Beach is littered by all things mundane and routine, except
for one nugget: altering the football schedules to include nine
conference games, up from the current eight.
</P>
<P>
   The change would limit teams to two non-conference games per
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's on the agenda, and conceivably it could come to a vote
this week,'' assistant commissioner Jim Muldoon said.
</P>
<P>
   Altering the football schedule is a constitutional issue and
would require eight ``yes'' votes. If passed, it would not become
effective for at least five years, as the current schedule runs its
course.
</P>
<P>
   In preliminary discussions, Washington and USC have opposed the
change. (Because of their annual series with Notre Dame, the
Trojans essentially have nine conference games already.)
</P>
<P>
   Under the current formula, each Pac-10 team misses another on a
rotating two-year basis. The exceptions are the natural rivalries
and the four California schools, which play each other every year.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon athletic director Bill Moos is a proponent of the
nine-game schedule because the Ducks are reluctant (financially and
emotionally) to miss their bitter rival, Washington, in the 2001-02
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Other non-California schools favor the change, as well, since a
nine-game schedule increases their exposure in Los Angeles, the
league's most fertile recruiting ground.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the most popular topic this week won't be on the
agenda: expansion.
</P>
<P>
   There are rumblings that Baylor may withdraw from the Big 12,
which would rattle its foundation and possibly free Colorado to
join the Pac-10 _ perhaps as a solo entry, perhaps coupled with
Texas or Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Baylor, the theory goes, realizes it can't compete for a Big 12
football title and believes its best course is to join WAC
leftovers Rice, Texas El-Paso, Southern Methodist and Texas
Christian in a renewed, revised Southwest Conference.

TWO TROPHIES, NO HARD FEELINGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Just like the U.S. Auto Club, we have redone
the math. And close as we can get it, everyone who exited victory
circle after the inaugural True Value 500K night race at Texas
Motor Speedway last June 7 was presented a winner's trophy.
</P>
<P>
   Well, at least two of the three principals involved in the now
infamous postrace ruckus have in their possession first-place
hardware.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a trophy, yeah. Nice-looking trophy. But it came a
little late,'' said Arie Luyendyk, who was declared the revised
winner of the scoring-botched Indy Racing League event on the
morning after.
</P>
<P>
   ``My trophy is very prominent in my office, right there with the
rest of 'em,'' said A.J. Foyt, who to this day swears that his
driver, Billy Boat, drove the first-place race car on that hot
pre-summer night.
</P>
<P>
   Boat indeed received the checkered flag as winner of a race
scheduled for 312 miles//208 laps around the 1.5-mile trioval. But
convinced by his team's telemetry that he had been shorted two
laps, Luyendyk charged into A.J.'s postrace party, ostensibly
looking for an audience with USAC chief steward Keith Ward.
</P>
<P>
   After taking an earful of Luyendyk's protests, Foyt
unceremoniously slapped him on the side of the face from behind and
shoved him to the ground. It was a scene straight out of a Saturday
night short track, choose your state. And it only got more bizarre
after an official protest was filed by Treadway Racing on
Luyendyk's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   The written protest prompted an all-night audit by USAC
officials, who found that their scoring and timing equipment had
failed. Ward disclosed that after the first 18 laps, the electronic
transmitters that register lap counts were not working on several
cars. Luyendyk's transmitters had failed to count laps after his
first and second pit stops at laps 63 and 115.
</P>
<P>
   The audit also confirmed that when Luyendyk passed Tony Stewart
on lap 190, he moved into the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, USAC said Luyendyk _ originally credited with a
third-place finish _ had completed 210 laps. The revised results
declared Luyendyk the winner, followed by Boat, Davey Hamilton,
Scott Goodyear and Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   With qualifying scheduled tonight for the second annual True
Value 500K, Foyt and Luyendyk are civil toward one another.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually the Tuesday after (the incident), A.J. called me and
apologized,'' said Luyendyk, who had won his second Indianapolis
500 only a couple of weeks before the nightmare in Fort Worth. ``He
said, `It was so stupid of me to do that,' and his wife told him he
was stupid to do it. But A.J.'s a fierce competitor. He's a
hothead. He does things a lot of times before he really thinks
about 'em. That was the case last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Foyt insisted last week that he bears no grudge against the
Dutchman.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Arie knocked my crew chief's wife down, and he used
language that I've used before,'' said Foyt, the first four-time
winner of the Indy 500. ``We didn't go to victory circle just to go
there. We assumed we had won the race. Billy Boat did a hell of a
job, and you just don't do what Arie Luyendyk did. I wouldn't take
it laying down. That's not A.J.'s nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a big mistake on USAC's part. It caused a lot of
bad press for A.J. Foyt that was really senseless. NASCAR, right or
wrong, never has taken a victory away (after the fact). That was
the biggest thing. That was Billy Boat's first victory.''
</P>
<P>
   Boat, who was making only his second IRL start for Foyt at TMS,
was content to slip into the background as the ill will played out
last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still kind of a sore subject. We don't joke about it too
much,'' said Boat, now firmly entrenched as driver of Foyt's No. 11
Conseco Dallara//Aurora. ``I wasn't looking to make the controversy
any worse than it already was. It was time to march on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would (that victory) have changed my career to this point any?
Probably not. But I would have gone down in history as the winner
of this race, vs. the guy that crossed the finish line first and
got paid for second. Our team still feels we won this race. I mean,
it's way too complicated to get into why we think that. But we had
counts of all the laps, and we know what everybody did and
according to our records, we won the race.''
</P>
<P>
   Boat said it is weird, but the controversy actually helped his
visibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's an odd way to get known, but it didn't hurt as far as
my name recognition,'' said Boat, who qualified on the pole for the
world's greatest auto race, the Indy 500, last month. ``What do
they say, there's no such thing as bad press. It really put me on
the map. And the type of determination that A.J. showed (last year)
really carries over to his race team.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team, including the driver, is very hungry for a win.
We're poised for a win.''
</P>
<P>
   That is why, Boat said, he never has asked Foyt for possession
of the trophy from last year's nightmare in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I win my first race, that's when I'll be looking for the
hardware,'' Boat said. ``When it goes down officially.'' THE BUZZ &QL;

<P>
   Texan Greg Ray has secured sponsorship from AT&AMP;T Wireless
Services for the Pep Boys Indy Racing League's True Value
500-kilometer race at Texas Motor Speedway this weekend. Ray, of
Plano, qualified in the middle of the front row for the 82nd
Indianapolis 500 and led 18 laps on May 24 before being sidelined
by a balky gearbox. But his 18th-place finish convinced AT&AMP;T
Wireless to climb aboard the sidepods of the No. 97 Dallara-Aurora
fielded by Thomas Knapp Motorsports. Ray, incidentally, finished an
IRL career-best eighth during last year's race in Fort Worth. And
he is ``anxious'' to carry the momentum from Indy into his
backyard. ``I'm very anxious. I'm anxious because I felt like we
could have won at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway,'' Ray said.
``I'm looking forward to winning in Fort Worth, before a home
crowd. I feel like my small team has gained a lot of momentum, and
we should be in better position to be a contender in this race. I'm
ready to win a race.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   John Paul Jr. was not among the original list of 34 drivers
entered for the True Value 500K. He is now. On Tuesday, team owner
Jonathan Byrd released Mike Groff as driver of the No. 10 G
Force/Aurora and replaced him with Paul, who drove for the
low-budget Team Pelfrey at Indy and finished seventh. Paul led the
race twice for 39 laps, and only winner Eddie Cheever (76 laps)
paced more circuits around the 2.5-mile Indianapolis Motor
Speedway. Groff, meanwhile, finished 15th at Indy _ 17 laps down.
``It just wasn't working,'' Byrd said of his longtime working
relationship with Groff. ``Sometimes you just have to change the
recipe. I don't think John Paul has been given a real opportunity
to show everything he's got.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the seat Paul vacated at Team Pelfrey is expected to
be filled today by either World of Outlaws Sprint Car star Steve
Kinser or Indy-car veteran Johnny Parsons. Brian Barnhart, the
IRL's director of racing operations, said he was having signs made
with Kinser's name on it yesterday afternoon to hang over the No.
81 team's door in the newly renamed Pep Boys Indy Racing League
Garage. That formerly was known as the NASCAR Busch Grand National
Garage. ...
</P>
<P>
   Driver Davey Hamilton has applauded the decision by TMS
management to eliminate the former eight-degree ``dual-banking'' in
the corners, which now are fully banked at 24 degrees. ``Nobody
raced on it, so there was no sense having it,'' said Hamilton,
driver of the No. 6 Nienhouse Motorsports G Force/Aurora. ``Might
as well make more race room with the 24-degree banking.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton is expecting a minimal increase in IRL speeds this
weekend. ``And it's a false speed,'' said Hamilton, who finished
fourth at Indy last month. ``Because what they've done is move the
white line down eight feet in each corner. So it's actually made
the bottom of the track a little smaller. It's still a mile and a
half track. But it's just a shorter distance _ if you run on the
white line.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   McCormack Motorsports and driver Raul Boesel have signed
TransWorld Diversified Services Inc. of Tampa, Fla., as primary
sponsor for the remainder of the season.
</P>
<P>
   If Indy-car legend A.J. Foyt of Houston is still looking for a
suspect in the alleged ``sabotage'' of the car of Indy 500
pole-sitter Billy Boat on the night before the big race, he might
want to check out Cigarette Smoking Man from ``The X-Files.''
Theoretically, he's responsible for every other unsolved conspiracy
in the past 50 years. &QL;

   For those with short memories, Winston Cup star Rusty Wallace
first broached the subject of a complete make-over at Texas Motor
Speedway when he crashed out in Turn 4 of the Interstate Batteries
500 in April 1997. Brother Kenny Wallace criticized management for
spending too much time and money on luxury suites, condos and fan
amenities at the expense of the 1.5-mile racetrack after the Texas
500 in April. Enter Mike Wallace, brother of Rusty and Kenny, and a
regular in the NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series. Mike Wallace, who
also competed in the inaugural Cup race in Fort Worth, returns this
week as driver of the No. 52 Purolator PureOne Chevrolet owned by
Cup driver Ken Schrader. Wallace said he wants to believe the
water-seepage problems in turns 1 and 4 that plagued the Cup
drivers in April have been remedied, and the reconfigured exit of
Turn 4 and entrance of Turn 1 will prove driver-friendly during
tomorrow night's Pronto Auto Parts 400K night race. ``I know there
will be a tremendous amount of interest on Friday night from
Richmond, Va., where all the Cup cars and Busch cars are this
weekend _ to see what this race is going to do,'' Wallace said
yesterday. ``I mean, that was the buzz when we left Charlotte _
let's see what's going to happen in Texas. I'm sure Schrader is
going to be on the phone asking, `Hey, what did that racetrack do?'
I'm sure the racetrack is going to be fine. But they need this race
to come off with no problems. Because Friday night is the night
everybody (in NASCARland) is going to be watching it _ no
disrespect to the IRL.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   Ernie Irvan has moved from 23rd in Cup points to 14th since the
Texas 500 in April. Irvan was the first driver out of the TMS race,
thanks to a flat tire in the No. 36 Skittles Pontiac Grand Prix.
``The only flat tire we've had since then has been on the rental
car,'' Irvan said. ``We really like that.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   Only five Winston Cup drivers have qualified for all 12 races
this season without use of a provisional start _ Jeff Gordon, Dale
Jarrett, Rusty Wallace, John Andretti and Rick Mast.  &QL; 
WORLD OF OUTLAWS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There are few areas of the country where local drivers can give
Pennzoil World of Outlaws regulars a serious challenge. Central
Pennsylvania is one of them. When the Outlaws returned for their
annual Sprint Car tour of the region on May 19, the ``Pennsylvania
Posse'' let it be known they were going to protect their turf.
Local drivers Fred Rahmer and Donnie Kreitz combined to win three
of seven WoO races in Pennsylvania and Maryland. Rahmer was the
only driver to repeat in the seven races, while series regulars
Mark Kinser, Johnny Herrera, Sammy Swindell and Stevie Smith all
posted victories. Mark Kinser took the series points lead with
seven consecutive top-five finishes, including a victory at
Williams Grove Speedway in Mechanicsburg, Pa. Stevie Smith, of New
Oxford, Pa., began the tour with the points lead but lost two
engines in four races between May 21-24 and fell to fourth. Smith
returned to form at Williams Grove with a victory in the
caution-free 30-lap A-main on May 29. &QL;

   Indy Racing League stars Eddie Cheever and Arie Luyendyk have
downplayed the possible effect the repaving and reconfiguring of
Texas Motor Speedway figures to have on race speeds during Saturday
night's True Value 500-kilometer race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we'll probably be two or three mph faster than we were
last year,'' said Cheever, the reigning Indy 500 champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new pavement should be quicker, but it might give us too
much grip,'' said Luyendyk, the reigning True Value 500K champion.
``We might have a problem where we have too much grip, and too much
grip slows you down as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Are these drivers in denial?
</P>
<P>
   Apparently not, even when TMS is compared to Atlanta Motor
Speedway, its sister track that underwent a reconfiguring and
repaving last year. The 1.5-mile AMS quad-oval, which like TMS has
corners banked at 24 degrees, witnessed an increase of 11.971 mph
in Winston Cup pole speeds from March 1997 to November 1997. Geoff
Bodine won the pole for the 1997 season-ending NAPA 500 in his Ford
Thunderbird with a record lap at 197.478 mph.
</P>
<P>
   That got the attention of the IRL's Barnhart.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went and tested at Atlanta in April with both Team Menard
cars and with Greg Ray, and ran the same speeds we ran here. We ran
215 mph,'' Barnhart said. ``That was very surprising because we
expected it to be 10 to 15 mph faster than before, because the
stock cars increased. That didn't seem to carry over to our cars.''
</P>
<P>
   Like last year, IRL cars will compete at TMS with an aerodynamic
package that requires a 6-degree minimum angle for the rear wing,
and a one-inch minimum wicker bill, or flap. The regulations are
designed to increase chassis drag and downforce.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the 6-degree rear wing and one-inch wicker, our cars are
approaching terminal velocity here,'' Barnhart said. ``I would
expect us to be in the 215, 218 to 220 mph range here. And that
will be a gain as much in horsepower and in tires as the
reconfiguration of the racetrack.'' &QL;

   Randy LaJoie is scheduled to drive his final Winston Cup race in
the No. 50 Budweiser Chevrolet at Richmond, Va., on Saturday night.

REFUGEE'S LONG JOURNEY ENDS AT YANKEE STADIUM
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for updating, re-editing throughout) (ja)  
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Before throwing his first pitch for the Yankees
Wednesday night, Orlando Hernandez stood behind the mound for
several seconds and stared around the outfield at Yankee Stadium.
These were moments to remember for Hernandez, the realization of a
lifelong goal and the culmination of a harrowing journey that began
six months ago with a risky escape from Cuba and ended last night
on baseball's grandest stage.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez, forbidden to play baseball in Cuba by officials who
feared that he would defect, survived that trip in a makeshift
sailboat last December and signed with the Yankees this spring
training. He performed so well in the minor leagues that he was
promoted to pitch at Yankee Stadium Wednesday night, against the
Tampa Bay Devil Rays. The crowd roared when he was introduced,
cheered him when he walked to the mound, and burst out with more
cheers when he struck out the game's first hitter, Quinton
McCracken.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez left the game after seven innings, getting the victory
as the Yankees won, 7-1. He gave up the one run on five hits with
two walks and seven strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees called Hernandez up on Tuesday as a contingency, in
case David Wells, bothered by shoulder soreness, could not pitch.
Wells was able to start, but it just so happened that David Cone,
another Yankee pitcher, had been bitten on his pitching hand by his
mother's dog. The Yankees decided to rest Cone and activate
Hernandez for one game; they intended to return him to the minors
Thursday, and then call him up again later this season.
</P>
<P>
   But for Hernandez, one day was enough. He ate spaghetti
Wednesday afternoon, his favorite pre-game meal, and arrived at
Yankee Stadium around 3:30, cheered by fans waiting outside, some
waving Cuban flags. He strolled into the Yankees clubhouse, wearing
bluejeans and a jeans jacket, appearing not the least bit nervous
or anxious. In a sense, he had been preparing for this day for
years.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez was a star on Cuba's national team, known as El Duque,
the nickname given to his father. As a child, Hernandez has said,
he rooted for the Yankees and hoped he could play in Yankee
Stadium. His younger half brother, Livan, defected from Cuba in
1995 and signed with the Florida Marlins. Livan was a World Series
hero for the Marlins last October.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando Hernandez is the latest of a handful of defectors from
Cuba who are slowly making an impact in the major leagues. Rey
Ordonez, the Mets' shortstop, won a Gold Glove award last season
for his defensive brilliance, and Rolando Arrojo of Tampa Bay has
been one of the American League's best pitchers this season.
</P>
<P>
   After his brother's defection, Cuban authorities suspected that
Orlando would also try to leave. So even though he was a star
pitcher, they banned him for life from Cuba's national team in
October 1996. Other players who had defected, such as Livan
Hernandez and Ordonez, had walked away while the team was playing
in other countries. Orlando Hernandez would not get that chance.
</P>
<P>
   After he was banned, Hernandez, who is 32 years old by some
accounts and 28 by his own, worked briefly in a psychiatric
hospital, earning, he said, less than $10 a month. He said that
before Christmas 1997, government officials visited him and warned
him against taking any embarrassing action, because the pope was
scheduled to visit Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   With that, Hernandez was determined to leave. On the morning of
Dec. 6, he and seven others, including his wife, Noris Bosch, got a
20-foot sailboat made of scraps, carrying only several cans of
Spam, some fresh water and sugar. It was a dangerous flight. Arrojo
said Wednesday that while he wanted to flee Cuba, he never
considered leaving on a boat.
</P>
<P>
   After 10 hours, Hernandez and his group landed on Anguilla Cay,
a small deserted spit of land that belongs to the Bahamas; for
several days _ Hernandez has been unclear whether it was three or
four _ they huddled under a sail for warmth and survived on seaweed
and conch. They were spotted by a U.S. Coast Guard helicopter and
transported to the Bahamas.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez was offered a visa by the United States, but he
established residence in Costa Rica instead, a firsthand experience
in capitalism; had he taken up American residence, he would have
been subject to Major League Baseball's amateur draft and only able
to negotiate with the team that drafted him. But by going to Costa
Rica, he became a free agent and could field offers from all teams.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees signed Hernandez on March 7 to a four-year, $6.6
million contract _ more than twice what executives with other
bidders said they had offered.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez worked out with the Yankees for the first time March
21, but the team was not sure what kind of physical condition he
would be in. After all, he had been out of organized baseball for
more than a year. But he shocked them: A team doctor said Hernandez
was in the best condition of any athlete he had ever examined. Joe
Torre, the Yankee manager, saw Hernandez's broad shoulders, his
solid 6-foot-2-inch, 190-pound build, the flexibility in his
movements and his pitching mechanics, and decided then that
Hernandez had a chance to pitch in the big leagues. He just looks
like an athlete, Torre said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Teammates were taken immediately with his enthusiasm, his
outward joy. At the end of a fielding drill on his first day of
spring training, Hernandez bounced around the infield to pick up
baseballs, like a newly hired bat boy, his glove overflowing. He
was incredulous at the food and equipment made available to the
players.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Hideki Irabu, the Japanese pitcher whose assimilation
last season was awkward, Hernandez seemed to fit in with the
Yankees right away. When he first went to David Szen, the team's
traveling secretary, to receive his allotment of meal money,
Hernandez tried to speak only in English. Hernandez shivered in the
relative cold of Florida in March, but refused to buy any warmer
clothes; he needed to adjust, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He always seemed so happy, other players noted. But during
batting practice one day, Jorge Posada, a Yankee catcher, stood
alongside Hernandez in the outfield and asked him about his trip in
the leaky sailboat. Posada remembered Wednesday that Hernandez
replied quietly, his eyes turned downward.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hear about the people who make it on the boats,'' said
Posada, who grew up in Puerto Rico. ``But there are so many who
don't. You wonder, how bad is it over there that they just want to
get away? It's sad.''
</P>
<P>
   Posada paused. ``He left all his friends behind,'' he said. ``He
had to leave some of his family behind. That's pretty tough.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Hernandez's agent, Joe Cubas, authorities in Cuba
jailed one of the pitcher's brothers for a few days. Hernandez's
phone calls to his daughters, Yahumara, 7, and Steffi, 2, who live
in Cuba with his ex-wife, are monitored. ``Duque's life is
incomplete until he has his kids next to him,'' Cubas said.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez continued his preparation at the Yankees' training
complex in April, before pitching in a Class A game on April 16;
just 11 days later, he struck out 10 in five scoreless innings for
the Yankees' top farm club, Class AAA Columbus. He continued to
pitch well, compiling a 6-0 record and a 3.83 earned run average
for the Clippers, and his joyful approach to baseball and his life
experience here does not seem to have wavered.
</P>
<P>
   A large contingent of Cuban-Americans recently attended a
Clippers game in Rochester, waving flags and banging drums. An hour
after the game, in the parking lot, the drumbeats could still be
heard outside the stadium _ a group of 20 or so playing music. In
the middle of them, Orlando Hernandez danced. And last night at
Yankee Stadium, he completed his long journey and pitched.

PEOPLESOFT INTERESTED IN INTREPID 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMIE BECKETT  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
PeopleSoft Inc., a fast-growing software-maker, is expected to
announce today its acquisition of Alameda-based Intrepid Systems, a
maker of software for the retail industry, sources said late
yesterday.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Terms for the deal were not available, but one source said
payment will be in PeopleSoft stock, which has risen 68 percent
over the past year. Yesterday, PeopleSoft closed at $42, down
$1.13.
</P>
<P>
   Intrepid is privately held and, by one estimate, has annual
revenues of about $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   In an analysts' meeting last week, Pleasanton-based PeopleSoft
said it was looking to expand its industry-specific product lines
through acquisitions. Currently, PeopleSoft sells human-resources,
manufacturing-management and financial software used by all types
of businesses as well as specialized software for schools and
government agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Retail-management software such as that sold by Intrepid ``is
wide-open territory for PeopleSoft. If they move in and build a
beachhead as they did in higher education and the public sector,
they can get a real advantage,'' said James Moore, an analyst at BT
Alex. Brown.
</P>
<P>
   PeopleSoft currently holds a small equity stake in Intrepid. The
two companies also act as partners to sell products to retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Intrepid's 230 employees, who learned of the deal
yesterday, are expected to have jobs at PeopleSoft. The company,
which had 4,400 employees earlier this year, has been hiring
furiously _ last year it added 2,000 people, and this year it said
it expects to add another 3,000.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers use Intrepid's products to manage merchandise,
purchasing, marketing and warehouses and to track promotions. Its
customers include Rite-Aid drug stores, Consolidated Stores, Kmart
and Liz Claiborne.
</P>
<P>
   PeopleSoft had revenues of $815 million in 1997, an 81 percent
jump over 1996. The company has said it expects to grow another 50
to 60 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   Founded just a decade ago with five employees, PeopleSoft is now
one of the world's largest manufacturers of software used by large
enterprises. According to a May report by IDC Research, that market
grew 20 percent last year to $14.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   PeopleSoft, which pioneered business management applications
that could run on all kinds of systems, began as a maker of
software used to administer human resources. Later, it added
software for financial management and product distribution.

CONTEMPORARY ART AUCTIONED FOR RECORD PRICES
</HEADLINE>
  (ja)  
 By CAROL VOGEL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Evoking the Yankees' recent triumph, Christopher
Burge, chairman of Christie's in America, called Wednesday night's
sale ``a perfect game.'' The first auction of contemporary art as
Christie's now defines it _ works dating from 1970 to the present,
rather than art made since 1945 _ was 100 percent sold, with record
prices set for 12 artists.
</P>
<P>
   A small but passionate group of international collectors and
dealers snapped up works by artists like Gerhard Richter, Sigmar
Polke and Blinky Palermo at a relentless pace. Many times, there
were so many bidders that it was hard to keep them all straight.
The sale totaled $16.1 million, far above the auction house's high
estimate of $12.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   Six serious contenders went after Richter's ``Seascape'' (1969),
a romantic composition based on two photographs, one of the sea and
one the sky. Expected to bring $800,000 to $1.2 million, it sold
for $2.5 million, more than twice the high estimate, to an
unidentified American bidder. The price nearly triple the previous
record for the artist, set at Sotheby's in 1995 when ``The Barn''
sold for $965,000.
</P>
<P>
   (Final prices include the auction house's commission, 15 percent
of the first $50,000 and 10 percent of the rest. Estimates do not
reflect commissions.)
</P>
<P>
   The first 40 works in the sale came from the collection of
Barbara Herbig, a jewelry designer who is the widow of Dr. Jost
Herbig, a scientist from Cologne, Germany, who died in 1995. The
couple put their collection together over eight years, buying
cutting-edge works from the late 1960's and early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Christie's had staked a lot on the Herbigs' art. In February,
before the auction house knew what or how much of the collection it
would be selling, it issued a fancy $45 museum-style catalogue
(without estimates) and put the works on view at both its Park
Avenue showrooms and its annex at 308 E. 59th St. It even hired
Annabel Selldorf, the trendy SoHo architect, to design the Park
Avenue portion of the exhibition. Christie's also made a
substantial financial investment in the works. While the auction
house would not divulge the details of its financing,
contemporary-art experts said it had to offer Mrs. Herbig a
guarantee (a minimum sum promised to a seller regardless of a
sale's outcome) said to be around $8 million.
</P>
<P>
   The gamble paid off. The total for the Herbigs' collection alone
was $11.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Another painting that brought a high price was Sigmar Polke's
``Solutions I-IV'' (1967), part of a series of seven canvases.
These four show arithmetic problems with the wrong answers in a
parody of mathematics. Estimated at $700,000 to $900,000, it was
sold to Larry Gagosian, the Manhattan dealer for $882,500, a record
for the artist. Gagosian also bought Richter's ``Wheat Field''
(1965) for $552,500, just above its $500,000 high estimate.
</P>
<P>
   Three paintings by Baselitz depicting upside-down eagles were
also fought after. The eagle, a symbol of the German nation, is
shown with thick brush strokes against a bright blue sky.
``Fingerpainting I: Eagle'' (1971-72) was estimated at $450,000 to
$650,000. After a battle between several determined bidders, it
finally sold to an unidentified telephone bidder for $827,500.
``Fingerpainting II: Eagle'' brought $442,500 to an unidentified
American buyer. and ``Fingerpainting III: Eagle,'' sold for
$354,500. Both had been estimated at $350,000 to $450,000.
</P>
<P>
   One of the evening's biggest buyers was Ivon Wirth from the
Zurich gallery Hauser &AMP; With and his New York partner, David
Zwirner, who recently bought a brownstone on East 69th Street where
they plan to open a New York branch. Wirth was seen sitting on the
far side of the salesroom bidding and buying works by Dan Flavin,
Robert Ryman, Sigmar Polke and Blinky Palermo. Wirth paid $288,500
for Mr. Ryman's ``Classico 5'' (1968), a white rectangle painted
over 12 joined sheets of Classico paper, estimated at $150,000 to
$200,000, a record for a work on paper by the artist and $332,500
for Flavin's three-part fluorescent work ``The Nominal Three (to
William of Okham),'' estimated at $100,000 to $150,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``This sale shows that Minimal and Conceptual art now has a
truly established international market,'' said Neal Meltzer, who
runs Christie's contemporary-art department in New York. ``Artists
like Carl Andre, Dan Flavin and Robert Ryman sold for higher prices
than ever before.''
</P>
<P>
   So did the work of On Kawara, a Japanese-born Conceptual artist
who lives in New York. A record price was set when an Asian dealer
paid $574,500 for ``May 1-7, 1971 (Today Series Nos. 23-29),''
eight canvases with a date painted on them along with eight
cardboard boxes with newspaper clippings. Christie's had expected
them to sell for $200,000 to $300,000.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving the sale, dealers and curators all had a different
theories about the sale's success. ``This is the beginning of a
strong market for Minimalism,'' said Lisa Dennison, chief curator
of the Solomon Guggenheim Museum. ``There was a small hard-core
group of collectors were were serious buyers.''
</P>
<P>
   Diane Upright, a former head of contemporary art at Christie's
who is now a private dealer, said the ``rarity and quality of the
Herbig property helped carry the evening.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And the rest,'' she added of the high prices, ``was scarily
like the boom of the late 1980s.'' &QL;

HERNANDEZ HELPS YANKS TO 7-1 VICTORY OVER TAMPA BAY
</HEADLINE>
   (dc) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Had Orlando Hernandez kept the Yankees close
Wednesday night, his manager would have been happy. If he lasted
six innings, that would have been enough. But in making his major
league debut, Hernandez gave the Yankees much more, beating Tampa
Bay, 7-1, before 27,291 at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Brosius, the Yankee third baseman, drove in four runs.
Hernandez gave up five hits, walked two and struck out seven in
seven innings, but with the slightly injured David Cone expected
back in action next week and the Yankees' machine rolling along,
Hernandez will probably be sent back to Class AAA Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   As Hernandez finished his final inning, fans stood and chanted
his nickname _ Duque, Duque _ and, from the upper deck, a Cuban
flag big enough to cover the pitcher's mound unfurled, slowly
twisting in the wind. Whether to acknowledge the crowd or not,
Hernandez removed his hat and accepted congratulations from his
teammates on the top step of the dugout.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Jeter, the Yankees' shortstop, strained an abdominal
muscle taking a swing in the fifth inning and was replaced by Luis
Sojo. Jeter is listed as day to day, but Manager Joe Torre has been
careful about resting his injured players, particularly with his
team running away in the American League East and sporting a 40-13
record.
</P>
<P>
   Straddling the mound, Hernandez wore his baseball pants in a
style straight from the days of Babe Ruth, drawn up just below his
knees, leaving his dark blue socks exposed. Wearing No. 26,
Hernandez pitched in the manner of another Cuban-born pitcher, Luis
Tiant, a former Yankee right-hander. Like Tiant, Hernandez threw
pitches at many speeds, from many angles.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez' fastball has been clocked at 94 mph, but he usually
started hitters with his curveball _ then, sometimes, another even
slower curveball _ and he often wouldn't throw his fastball until
he was ahead in the count. In a sense, he was pitching backward:
the majority of his contemporaries set up their off-speed pitches
with fastballs, but Hernandez was setting up his fastball with
off-speed pitches.
</P>
<P>
   And it worked. He struck out the game's first hitter, Quinton
McCracken, drawing a barrage of cheers. The fans stood and roared
when Hernandez retired the Devil Rays in the first inning.
</P>
<P>
   He did not allow any hits until Dave Martinez punched a soft
single into left field leading off the third. Hernandez retired the
next three hitters, and the first two in the fourth. Pitching to
Fred McGriff in that inning, however, Hernandez threw a fastball
that tailed back over the plate; McGriff whacked it over the wall
in right-center field, his first home run since April 28.
</P>
<P>
   But the Yankees, El Duque's hosts for a day, gave him treatment
that is standard for all of their starting pitchers, packaging a
five-run rally in the bottom of the fourth. Jeter tripled against
Tony Saunders (1-6), then scored on Paul O'Neill's line single. The
Yankees loaded the bases with two outs, and Jorge Posada smacked a
two-run single before Scott Brosius hit a two-run double.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with a four-run lead, Hernandez cut down the Devil Rays in
the fifth and sixth innings.

LOS ANGELES SCHOOL WELCOMES ELWAY FOR DEDICATION

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Granada Hills High School in L.A.'s San Fernando
Valley will make way for Elway, when it dedicates its football
stadium to one of its most famous and favorite alums _ Denver
Broncos quarterback John Elway.
</P>
<P>
   The 1979 Granada Hills grad is expected to greet the school's
3,500 students, plus staff, fans and former teammates Thursday
before the stadium renaming ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's definitely looking forward to it. He's excited,'' Elway's
personal assistant Kathy Hutch said from Denver on Wednesday. Elway
was in transit and unavailable for comment, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Elway is expected to bring his parents and his son Jack, 8. His
wife Janet has prior plans, Hutch said.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Elway, a 15-year Bronco veteran, won his first Super
Bowl in four tries. At the time he talked about retiring, but on
Monday, Elway, 37, announced he's returning for a final season in
hopes of defending the team's Super Bowl championship.
</P>
<P>
   But first, he'll take in the hometown accolades.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just honored. We've heard from a good friend of his and I
guess he's really excited about it,'' Granada Hills football coach
Darryl Stroh said Wednesday as he helped prepare for the
festivities.
</P>
<P>
   Stroh, who's taught at the school for 30 years, was a defensive
coordinator when Elway attended Granada. And he coached Elway in
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Stroh said Elway is expected to arrive at the school between 8
and 9 a.m., when he'll start the morning by chatting with staff and
players on the football team.
</P>
<P>
   Stroh said so far there's been no indication that Elway plans to
donate anything in return to his alma mater.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been no communication and no one's asked. It's not our
business,'' Stroh said.
</P>
<P>
   A few months ago, word of the stadium's renaming stirred
unexpected debate. Some residents complained that removing the name
of Bryce Schur, the school's founding principal, set a bad example
by placing sports celebrities above educators.
</P>
<P>
   In response, the school said a plaque bearing Schur's name will
be placed at the entrance of the sports complex and that the new
John Elway Stadium will now be part of the Bryce Schur Athletic
Complex.

U.S. SAYS UPSTATE MAN, 73, WAS NAZI GUARD 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By KIT R. ROANE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A 73-year-old retired tailor from Sullivan County in upstate New
York once worked as a Nazi guard, helping to round up Polish
citizens and ship them to concentration camps, the U.S. Justice
Department said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The man, Dmytro Sawczuk, who has lived in relative obscurity in
the United States for almost half a century, worked as an armed
guard at Nazi labor and death camps in Poland in 1943, Justice
Department officials said in Washington. They added that Sawczuk,
who now lives in Glen Spey, N.Y., participated in the expulsion of
tens of thousands of Jews from the ghetto in Bialystok, Poland, and
helped dispatch them to concentration camps.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department, which is now seeking to revoke Sawczuk's
citizenship, said he had lied about his wartime activities when he
applied for a visa to enter the United States in 1951, telling
immigration officials that he had spent the war working as a farmer
in Poland and cutting lumber in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   If found to have misrepresented his wartime record, Sawczuk will
face deportation proceedings, the Justice Department said. It is
also possible for Israel or another country that prosecutes war
crimes from World War II to request that he be extradited for
prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   ``A number of our defendants have been extradited _ it is a
small number, but it has happened,'' said Eli Rosenbaum, director
of the department's Office of Special Investigations.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Sawczuk nor his lawyer, Askold Lozynskyj, returned
repeated calls for comment. Prior to living in Glen Spey, Sawczuk
resided in Yonkers, N.Y., but it is not clear where he lived before
that.
</P>
<P>
   Glen Spey is a small upstate town of 2,500 in the Catskills
area, and those who know him there said they were shocked to hear
accusations that their neighbor of five years was a war criminal.
Sawczuk, who lives with his wife, Elizabeth, has two sons,
residents said, and had worked as a tailor and a demolition expert
before retiring.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Fahnestock, 18, said Sawczuk lived next door and never
failed to wave a greeting when the two passed on their street. ``He
was always very pleasant and kept his house nice,'' Fahnestock said
from behind the counter of Steve's Country Store, the town's only
gas station and convenience store.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bought my first car from him, an '85 Dodge,'' Fahnestock
said. ``He gave me a deal on it and it still runs. And he bought
his house from my stepfather. Always really nice, not the sort of
person you would think to be affiliated with a bunch of Nazis.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials said Sawczuk is among 300 possible war
criminals living in the United States who are under investigation
by the department, which has stripped U.S. citizenship from 59
other Nazi-era collaborators and deported 47 since its Office of
Special Investigations began operating in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White said in a prepared statement that
the proceedings against Sawczuk were ``a result of the OSI's
ongoing efforts to identify, investigate and take legal action
against former participants in Nazi persecution residing in this
country.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosenbaum added, ``This case demonstrates the government's
continuing efforts to make certain that those who have assisted in
persecution do not continue to enjoy the benefits of their
illegally procured citizenship.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Canada, which has amended its criminal code to allow for
the prosecution of Nazi war criminals in its own courts, the United
States has traditionally deported the suspects, citing the
difficulty of prosecuting people for crimes that occurred in other
countries against people who are not American citizens.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Justice Department's civil complaint, which was
filed Wednesday in the Southern District of New York, Sawczuk, who
was born in Liski, Poland, in 1924, was recruited into the German
forces in February 1943. His instruction began at the Trawniki
camp, where men were trained for Operation Reinhard, the Nazis'
successful effort to exterminate nearly 2 million Polish Jews and
force others into labor camps, the complaint said.
</P>
<P>
   As part of his training, Sawczuk was assigned to guard prisoners
at the Trawniki camp, the complaint said. It adds that around April
1943, he was moved as part of a special detachment to the Belzec
death camp to guard prisoners as they exhumed and burned the bodies
of ``hundreds of thousands of men, women and children'' who had
been murdered by Nazi troops there in 1942, ``primarily by
asphyxiation with carbon monoxide gas.''
</P>
<P>
   He was transferred to the Poniatowa camp, where he again served
as a guard before being transferred to Bialystok. There, the
complaint said, he helped ``round up and deport'' Jews from the
ghetto to concentration camps, including the Treblinka, Auschwitz
and Lubin camps.
</P>
<P>
   He was admitted to the United States as a displaced person on
October 1951, after telling immigration authorities that he had
spent most of the war as a Polish farmer before fleeing to Germany
in 1944, where he worked at a sawmill, the Justice Department
complaint said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Justice Department officials would not comment on what
led them to check on Sawczuk's immigration forms, John Russell, a
department spokesman, said most similar cases had resulted from the
scouring of wartime archives in Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``We find names of guards in archive rosters, then we run them
through the Immigration and Naturalization Service records,'' he
said. ``If we get a hit, we look to see if they are alive and are
still in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When we find them, the only thing we can do is deny them the
pleasure and comfort of the United States, because we don't have
jurisdiction for crimes outside the United States,'' he said. ``But
we have been very successful in what we do.''

THE SCOUTS WERE RIGHT ABOUT `EL DUQUE'
</HEADLINE>
  (ja)  
 By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ He hadn't thrown a pitch yet, but he already was
somebody special. His nickname was enough.
</P>
<P>
   After warming up in the bullpen, the Yankees' new Cuban
right-hander was strolling across the outfield toward the Yankee
dugout as the public-address announcer Bob Sheppard intoned the
lineups for Wednesday night's game with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays.
</P>
<P>
   ``And pitching for the Yankees,'' the voice boomed, ``El
Duque.'' Cheers muffled ``...Hernandez.'' Moments later, his blue
Yankee stirrups up to his knees, Orlando ``El Duque'' Hernandez
uncoiled out of a high-kick windup and fired his first major league
pitch, a fastball. Strike one, called. Moments later, as leadoff
batter Quinton McCracken swung and missed, he had his first
strikeout, and cheers from the turnout of 27,291.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankee scouting reports were correct.
</P>
<P>
   ``He throws strikes,'' Joe Torre, the Yankee manager, had said
earlier. ``He has a curveball, a changeup. He works both sides of
the plate. His command is good. He'll be nervous, but he seems to
have some calm about him. I just hope he takes it to the mound.''
</P>
<P>
   He did. Over seven innings, El Duque allowed only five hits,
struck out seven, walked two and departed with a 7-1 lead, which
became the final score. His only mistake: Fred McGriff, the Devil
Rays' first baseman, whacked a fastball strike over the right-field
fence near the 385-foot sign.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going back to Columbus after this game,'' Torre had said.
``But win, lose or draw, he's had this experience. If we need him
later, it's got to be a positive.''
</P>
<P>
   In the late afternoon, El Duque had watched his brother Livan,
last year's World Series hero for the Florida Marlins, lose, 5-1,
in Chicago on the television in the players' lounge. Torre,
meanwhile, was being asked how the pressure might affect the
rookie.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pressure?'' the Yankee manager said. ``Compared to the
pressure of jumping on a boat and trying to come to the United
States, this is a piece of cake.''
</P>
<P>
   That boat was a leaky sailboat, but it took El Duque with seven
others from Cuba across the Caribbean to a strip of sand known as
Anguilla Cay and a four-year $6.6 million Yankee contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jose Cardenal,'' Torre said, referring to his first-base
coach, ``he left Cuba a long time ago and has visited since. He
says it's awful there.''
</P>
<P>
   Awful enough for El Duque to climb onto that leaky sailboat. And
awful enough for Rolando Arrojo, the Devil Rays' rookie ace, to
defect from the Cuban Olympic team while in the United States
shortly before the Atlanta Summer Games two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Arrojo, a 29-year-old right-hander who is 8-3 this season, would
be watching El Duque last night from the Devil Rays' dugout.
</P>
<P>
   ``Orlando had the best won-lost record in Cuba without having a
big fastball,'' Arrojo said through an interpreter, Carlos Ledezma,
an equipment manager. ``We were on rival teams in Cuba, but we
played on the national team together at the Barcelona Olympics in
1992.''
</P>
<P>
   Had they ever discussed defecting?
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Arrojo said. ``It is very dangerous to speak about that
in Cuba, even to another player. You couldn't be sure who you could
trust, so you didn't talk to anybody about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Had he ever thought about leaving on a sailboat?
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he said, ``but after I got settled here, I arranged for
my wife and two sons to get on a boat and come here.''
</P>
<P>
   More than anybody else in Yankee Stadium Wednesday night, Arrojo
could appreciate the emotions churning inside El Duque.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first game, I was confused, nervous,'' he said. ``I had
dreamed of being in the United States and pitching in the big
leagues, but when that moment came, I questioned if I could do it.
Orlando probably has the same feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   How aware in Cuba had Arrojo been of the major leagues?
</P>
<P>
   ``Not too much,'' he said. ``The Marlin games were on the radio
from Miami, but the only way to listen to the games was to hide so
nobody knew what you doing. It was very dangerous to speak about
it. It's so sad the Cuban people are kept in the dark.''
</P>
<P>
   Arrojo, however, knew of some of the best Cuban players. ``I met
Tony Oliva in Minnesota,'' he said, referring to the Twins
outfielder of another era who remains a Hall of Fame candidate. But
if he really didn't know too much about the majors, why did he
defect?
</P>
<P>
   ``For freedom,'' he replied.
</P>
<P>
   The same reason El Duque had.

A FADING PEEP FOR THE GLITZ OF SMUTLAND 
 
</HEADLINE>
  (dc) 
 By ELIZABETH KOLBERT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Do you have to love smut to mourn the passing of
Peepland?
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, the most recent and possibly the last sex-shop
judgment came down, delivered by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals. Siding with Mayor Rudolph Giuliani against the sex-shop
owners, the appellate court ruled that the city was within its
rights to use zoning to restrict the sale of pornography.
</P>
<P>
   It may take months for the shops in the smut-free zones to
actually close, as their owners try a last-minute legal gambit. But
still, it seems safe to say that an era of prurience in New York
is, for better or worse, over.
</P>
<P>
   For Giuliani and millions of like-minded New Yorkers, it is
clearly the former. Wednesday, after declaring the court's decision
a ``big victory,'' the mayor announced that the city would move to
enforce the new zoning laws ``as soon as we can.'' From there, it
was easy to imagine him crisscrossing the city with oversized
padlocks, mugging for the camera against a backdrop of ``Girls!
Girls! Girls!''
</P>
<P>
   Yet there are many other New Yorkers who are neither patrons nor
owners of sex shops, and who may not even have found the shops
especially titillating, who will still feel their loss.
</P>
<P>
   The trick of nostalgia, after all, is that it is not just an
attachment to what was good and noble in the past but simply to
what was there.
</P>
<P>
   As we bid farewell to the sex shops, it is worth noting that the
shop owners were never their own best apologists. Rather than
identifying themselves as pornographers-and-proud-of-it, they
conducted their campaign from behind the screen of the almost
comically high-minded-sounding Coalition for Free Expression. Their
defense focused on the First Amendment implications of their trade,
a stand that seemed disingenuous at best.
</P>
<P>
   The dancers and strippers themselves, meanwhile, organized only
at the last minute. And when they protested that the issue was
really one of jobs, it seemed almost too sad and pathetic to be
compelling.
</P>
<P>
   Nor was it quite fair to suggest, as many of the shop owners
did, that Giuliani was trying to outlaw pornographic pleasure
altogether. Even under the starkest interpretation of the new
zoning laws, the mayor is merely marginalizing smut, pushing it
from the center of the city to the periphery. Even in midtown, sex
shops can stay in operation by reducing their pornographic
inventory to 40 percent of whatever it is that they are selling.
(Does this mean that for every four women dancing, there have to be
another six, say, lecturing on Sartre?)
</P>
<P>
   So it isn't as if New Yorkers will not be able to buy XXX-rated
videos or watch topless dancing anymore, just that they will have
to travel farther to do so.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the issue, however, is not so much the
availability of smut but what smut, in all of its rawness, seemed
to signify about the city. On an emotional level at least, this is
what made so many people in New York sympathetic to Giuliani's
campaign, and others so resistant.
</P>
<P>
   For most of its history, New York has been a pretty gritty
place, a city of fierce and sometimes ugly passions. To those, like
this columnist, who grew attached to it during the 1960s and 70s,
when it was self-confessedly, even ebulliently, seedy, the city's
tremendous attraction is bound up in these qualities. For us, it is
hard to imagine them just being sloughed off without the city also
seeming less authentic _ a sanitized, falsely sentimental image of
its genuine self.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani speaks often about the city's resurgence and the recent
redevelopment of areas once given over to urban decay. In
particular, he points proudly to the new commercial vibrancy of
Times Square. Nothing, it would seem, would please him more than if
the neighborhood's porn shops were to be replaced by more
conventional, tourist-friendly establishments. But some of us have
a hard time sharing in that dream.
</P>
<P>
   Niketown, the Gap, Starbucks, Banana Republic and the Body Shop
_ these are now the wholesome storefronts that increasingly set the
city's tone. Such stores are thriving in the soon-to-be-desmutted
New York, even though they have nothing essential to do with it and
all sell precisely the same demographically correct and
scientifically test-marketed designs that appear in malls all
across America.
</P>
<P>
   One thing to be said for Peepland, with the unblinking neon eye
on its marquee, is that at least you had to come to 42d Street to
see it.

LAWSUIT FILED TO PRESERVE BILINGUAL ED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVID R. BAKER   AND TERRI HARDY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Hours after voters resoundingly approved a ballot
measure to practically end bilingual education, civil rights
activists Wednesday went to court to stop the new law, while school
officials faced the task of changing how they teach English.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of Proposition 227 filed a complaint in San Francisco
federal court, claiming the law violates the civil rights of
children with limited English skills.
</P>
<P>
   And as Los Angeles school Superintendent Ruben Zacarias said he
is developing a plan to comply with the initiative, a group of
1,500 teachers announced they have signed a pledge to continue to
use or back bilingual education.
</P>
<P>
   Approved by 61 percent of voters Tuesday, the law gives
non-English speaking children a year to learn English in intensive
language training before moving into regular classes. Barring a
court action, the law takes effect in 60 days.
</P>
<P>
   Civil rights activists argued Wednesday that the initiative
leaves 1.4 million children, most of them minorities, with a
serious handicap in school. Children struggling to grasp English,
they said, will face an enormous, unconstitutional hurdle to learn
when compared with English-speaking kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not going to have the same access to math, to science,
to social studies -- and that's discriminatory,'' said Theresa
Fay-Bustillos, vice president of legal programs for the Mexican
American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, one of the plaintiffs
in the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Language can not be an excuse to railroad these kids into a
less-than-equal education,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The proposition's backers Wednesday dismissed that charge,
saying that forcing children to master English quickly would make
them better students.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the long run, throughout their academic career, it will be
a huge benefit to the child,'' said Sheri Annis, spokeswoman for
the English for the Children campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts said the initiative's opponents may face a
difficult battle to delay the initiative from taking effect. To
overturn the law, they would need to demonstrate that the new
requirements unfairly place a burden on non-English-speaking kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is, do these programs, in fact discriminate? Do
they prevent equal access?'' said Rachel F. Moran, a law professor
at the University of California, Berkeley. ``It's going to become a
battle of the experts.''
</P>
<P>
   If the court challenges fail, it is unclear whether schools can
disassemble their bilingual programs quickly enough to meet the
law.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're waiting to see what the district mandates us to do --
they've told us to sit tight and continue with what we've always
done until further notice,'' said Dan Balderrama, principal at
Lankershim Elementary School in North Hills, where 1,400 of their
1,650 children don't speak fluent English.
</P>
<P>
   Zacarias declined to discuss the law, but he said in a one-page
statement that the district ``is developing a plan to comply with
Proposition 227, as best we understand it.''
</P>
<P>
   Zacarias said the district's plan could change ``substantially''
depending on the outcome of the lawsuit and yet-to-be-developed
guidelines from the state.
</P>
<P>
   He added that there would be no change of procedure or methods
``until further notice from my office.''
</P>
<P>
   The initiative's supporters said the LAUSD is counting on the
court challenge to buy time. But Annis said the district has no
excuse not to come up with a working plan soon.
</P>
<P>
   Annis added that the district has had a year to prepare for the
change.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the LAUSD doesn't make this their No. &UR;  &LR; 1 priority, they
will be seen as completely irresponsible,'' Annis said. ``This was
the wish of the people of California, including Los Angeles, where
it won overwhelming support.''
</P>
<P>
   Some district teachers signaled their intention to continue
backing bilingual education, with or without the district's
support. At a news conference late Wednesday, they said 1,500
teachers had signed a pledge to ``use and/or support the use of
bilingual education as one program to meet the needs of students.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is our hope officials understand that for every one of the
teachers that have signed the pledge, implementing that policy
would be a greater disservice to our students than violating the
policy,'' said Steve Zimmer, teacher at Marshall High School and
organizer of the effort.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Stone, spokesman for the state Department of Education,
said a task force will establish guidelines for districts by the
end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've suggested that districts should not act precipitously.
They should wait for us to establish more definitive guidelines,''
Stone said.
</P>
<P>
   Suburban districts seemed to be adopting the LAUSD's
wait-and-see approach Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Antelope Valley's largest elementary school districts say they
too are waiting for state guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need guidance from the state Department of Education on
what will be permitted or what are the appropriate strategies,''
said Ned McNabb, Lancaster School District deputy superintendent.
</P>
<P>
   Administrators in the Conejo, Las Virgenes, Moorpark and Simi
Valley school districts say they will wait for the outcome of legal
challenges or direction from the state before making any sudden
changes in instruction.
</P>
<P>
   Last school year, 1,157 of the Moorpark Unified School
District's 6,905 students qualified for English language
assistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't have room for planning; it tells us what to do --
you will teach English by speaking English,'' said Moorpark school
board member David Pollock. ``I don't think we'll have to retrain
teachers, they're just going to be given a new prescription.''

CHINESE MAN WAS MAKING 2ND BID TO ENTER U.S. ILLEGALLY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CELIA W. DUGGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wang Wu Dong was a skinny man of 40 when he washed up on the
shores of Queens, New York, five years ago, a passenger on the
Golden Venture, a freighter loaded with a human cargo of 286
illegal Chinese immigrants that shuddered to a halt on a sandbar
within sight of New York City's lights.
</P>
<P>
   He was apprehended that night and spent the next three years
behind bars, trying unsuccessfully to win asylum on the ground he
had been persecuted for resisting China's one-child policy. He
finally gave up and went home, just months before Congress passed a
law in 1996 that would have made his asylum claim more likely to
succeed.
</P>
<P>
   Wang's timing was miserably off once again last Saturday. He was
among the 23 illegal Chinese immigrants aboard the Oops II, a
30-foot powerboat named with a cruelly flippant aptness. It ran
aground in dense fog off the New Jersey shore, leaving the men to
scatter in the darkened streets of the wealthy seaside area where
they were picked up by police.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers, advocates, officials and a fellow Golden Venture
passenger interviewed Wednesday remarked on Wang's ill fortune,
which was first reported Wednesday in The Star-Ledger of Newark,
N.J. But they tipped their hats to his determination to get to
America.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, it's unbelievable he went through all of that, then
turned around to come back again,'' said Beverly Church, a
paralegal who became a mother hen to many of the Golden Venture
passengers during their three-year detention in York, Pa. ``It
tells me how much he'll go through to be free.''
</P>
<P>
   Wang's lawyers said he would definitely apply for asylum again,
citing what he says was his wife's forced sterilization. ``The law
has changed significantly and I think he has a good case,'' said
Robert Porges, the Chinatown lawyer whose firm is representing 20
of the 23 detainees.
</P>
<P>
   Porges said all his clients would ask for asylum, some on the
basis of China's one-child policy and some contending they were
persecuted because they are Christians.
</P>
<P>
   Hearings for Wang and the other 22 men apprehended after the
Oops II grounded off Bay Head, N.J., will begin Thursday in
Elizabeth, N.J., where the immigrants are being detained in the
custody of the Immigration and Naturalization Service.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration officials said all the men from the Oops II would be
charged with entering the country illegally. The Lawyers Committee
for Human Rights gave a briefing to the detainees at the Elizabeth
center on Wednesday, explaining the process to them. Immigration
officials said that at the first hearing, a judge would inform the
Chinese of the charges against them. Hearings on the merit of their
cases will probably be held within six months.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities are still searching for Jason Choi, 38, the
captain of the Oops II. Choi is a Korean who was questioned and
released the night the boat ran aground but before the Bay Head
police realized it had been carrying illegal immigrants. Choi's
former roommate at an apartment at 147-15 Northern Boulevard, in
Flushing, Queens, told The Korea Times newspaper that Choi last
lived in the apartment from February until late April and said he
had come from Korea about one year ago.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The men who were passengers on Choi's boat, however, were
settling into detention Wednesday night. Wang, who identified
himself to his lawyers as one of the Golden Venture passengers,
conferred with them about how best to fight deportation to China.
</P>
<P>
   Russell Bergeron Jr., a spokesman for the immigration service in
Washington, said he could not confirm whether there was a Golden
Venture passenger on board the Oops II because of federal privacy
laws.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration officials said that each man on the Oops II may have
paid the smugglers as much as $40,000 for the journey to New York.
The men, from 18 to 45 years old, came from Fujian Province, home
to many of New York City's illegal Chinese immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   When Wang first arrived in the United States five years ago, he
had little chance of winning asylum on the ground that he had been
persecuted under China's population control policies.
</P>
<P>
   Had he come a year earlier, when Bush administration policies
were in effect, he would have had a chance. But during the Clinton
years, immigration judges routinely ruled that China was not
persecuting the immigrants, but enforcing a national policy
designed to fight overpopulation.
</P>
<P>
   Wang spent three years behind bars in York, Pa., in the custody
of immigration authorities. Like many of the other men, he began
passing the tedious hours by using toilet paper, water and glue to
help make papier-mache creations like eagles, dragons and Statues
of Liberty. But as months and years passed, he became discouraged,
say people who knew him then.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Church, who regularly visited the York County prison where
Wang was being held, said he worried about his family in China,
especially since he was unable to work and send money home. ``He
was of no value to anyone in prison,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   His asylum petition had been denied. And the legal battle being
waged in federal court to win new hearings for the Golden Venture
detainees seemed to drag on endlessly. The immigrants' legal
advocates maintained that the men had been unfairly denied refuge
in the United States because the government was using them to send
a message to smugglers.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, in February 1996, Wang gave up. He asked to be sent
back to China.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too much depression,'' said Steven Shi, 27, a Golden Venture
passenger who won an artist's visa last month that allows him to
remain in the United States. ``Depression made him go back.''
</P>
<P>
   In September 1996, Congress passed a new law backed by
anti-abortion Republicans that made opposing China's one-child
policy a potential reason for a grant of asylum.
</P>
<P>
   It is that law that gives Wang's lawyers hope that his luck has
finally changed. Already Wednesday, Wang was gaining some
potentially important political allies, including some of the
members of Congress who worked to change the law and lobbied on
behalf of the Golden Venture detainees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obvious that because of the practice of forced
sterilization and human rights violations, these people will do
anything to escape,'' said Rep. Bill Goodling, R-Pa. ``That he
would risk being reimprisoned so soon after he went back shows you
how unbearable the situation is.''

EDITORIAL: OFFICES MONEY CAN'T BUY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Ala., Neb., Ky.)  (mk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, June 4:
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, the results of California's primary elections
may cause multimillionaires to rethink their plans for midlife
career changes. Never have so many spent so much to win so little.
The businessman Al Checchi could have gotten a better return by
spending his $40 million on Lotto tickets than by seeking the
Democratic gubernatorial nomination. Rep. Jane Harman, who finished
right behind Checchi in the race, lost both her congressional
career and about $15 million of her husband's fortune. The car
alarm magnate Darrell Issa spent $10 million of his own money
chasing the GOP Senate nomination, to no avail.
</P>
<P>
   Like many elections so far this year, Tuesday's primaries were a
rejection of checkbook politics and unrestricted spending. Lt. Gov.
Gray Davis, who beat Checchi, is a career politician who
categorized his victory as ``an experience money can't buy.'' Matt
Fong, the state treasurer, underspent Issa for the Senate
nomination. Californians rejected Rep. Jay Kim and his financial
scandal. Kim, who recently pleaded guilty to accepting illegal
campaign donations, was confined to his Washington home under a
probation agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The voters' contempt for rich newcomers has not been limited to
California. Businessmen in Nebraska, Kentucky and other states
outspent their opponents and sent overall campaign costs soaring,
only to lose on primary day. Deep down, Americans may not really
want to see their government run like a business after all. Checchi
was not the first businessman-candidate whose history as a
job-cutting downsizer came back to haunt him.
</P>
<P>
   In another primary that was watched closely this week, the
inability of Gov. Fob James Jr. of Alabama to win renomination
outright was seen as the voters' effort to give the state a more
reasonable image. James drew unwelcome attention to Alabama with
his threat to call out the National Guard to defend a judge's right
to post the Ten Commandments in his courtroom, and with his
obsessive crusade for school prayer. Alabamans have good cause to
believe that their real problems lie more in the direction of
economic development and education. James' supporters may take
heart in the fact that the upcoming primary runoff pits him against
Winton Blount, a millionaire businessman. But Blount emphasized
progressive policies, not bottomless pockets.
</P>
<P>
   The most dramatic result of Tuesday's voting, however, involved
not rich would-be governors but schoolchildren. Californians voted
overwhelmingly to approve Proposition 227, which would drastically
curtail bilingual education in public schools. The initiative's
passage, which was apparently supported by many Latino parents,
seemed to be more of a protest against the poor quality of public
education than a reasoned analysis of how best to teach children
who are not fluent in English. A more rational approach to the
issue of bilingual education was passed by the California
Legislature this year. But it was vetoed by Gov. Pete Wilson, whose
impulse to pander seems to grow as presidential election time
approaches.
</P>
<P>
   Voters defeated another proposal that would have restricted
unions' ability to use their members' dues for political campaigns.
They apparently responded to ads claiming that the proposition was
a plot to quell critics of unpopular special interests, like HMOs.
Californians may have come to realize that legislating by the
ballot box is a rough tool that is easily manipulated and seldom
accomplishes what they might hope.

BRITISH COMPANY BUYING RESTAURANT ASSOCIATES
</HEADLINE>
 ASSOCIATES-SALE-500&AMP;ADD-NYT (dc) 
By GLENN COLLINS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Restaurant Associates, the trailblazing Manhattan
management and consulting group that has created some of New York's
most popular restaurants, including the Four Seasons, is being
acquired by a London food-service company in a deal valued at about
$138 million.
</P>
<P>
   Compass Group PLC, the world's largest food-service company,
said Wednesday that it had agreed to pay $87.5 million for
Restaurant Associates itself and about $50 million for its Acapulco
chain of 46 Mexican restaurants
</P>
<P>
   By being acquired, Restaurant Associates will obtain capital to
expand, and Compass will gain an upscale toehold in the volatile
and highly competitive American restaurant market, analysts said.
They added that Restaurant Associates would use the deep pockets of
its new owner to finance national expansion of its specialty, the
profitable packaging of its stylish brand of elegant dining.
</P>
<P>
   ``The acquisition could be good for Restaurant Associates and
good for Compass,'' said Malcolm M. Knapp, an analyst who heads an
independent restaurant consulting concern in Manhattan that bears
his name. ``The danger is that over time Compass may decide not to
keep R.A. as a unit, which would undo its specialness.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the second time in eight years that the company has been
acquired. The 1990 purchase of Restaurant Associates by Kyotaru
Co &UR; . &LR;  drew wide attention as the first major investment by a
Japanese company in the American restaurant industry during a
frenzied era of trans-Pacific deals. In July 1996, after a yearlong
effort to persuade the financially troubled Kyotaru to let go,
Restaurant Associates bought back all its stock with the help of
investors.
</P>
<P>
   The mystique of Restaurant Associates, which employs 8,500
people, dates from the days when it started trend-setting Manhattan
restaurants like the Brasserie, La Fonda del Sol, Trattoria and the
Forum of the Twelve Caesars.
</P>
<P>
   But the company has been eager to establish its identity as a
high-end food-service provider and creator of such restaurants as
the Sea Grill and the American Festival Cafe at Rockefeller Center
and Cafe Centro and Tropica in the Metlife building.
</P>
<P>
   And these days the lion's share of its profit comes from
bringing gourmet dining to corporations, institutions and
high-profile events, ranging from Sony Music Entertainment, the
Harvard Business School and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter to the
Metropolitan Museum of Art, the John F. Kennedy Center for the
Performing Arts in Washington, the Music Center of Los Angeles
County, the Academy Awards and the P.G.A. Championship.
</P>
<P>
   In March, the United States Tennis Association hired Restaurant
Associates as its new food-service provider at the U &UR; . &LR; S &UR; . &LR;  Open
tournament in August in Flushing Meadows, Queens.
</P>
<P>
   The company will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Compass,
which said it would retain Restaurant Associates' current
management. ``We have absolutely no plans for downsizing,'' said
Michael J. Bailey, president and chief executive of the North
American subsidiary of Compass, based in Charlotte, N.C. ``In the
future, I see more people, not less.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Nick Valenti, chief executive of Restaurant Associates, said
that the company could thrive under the English although it
languished under the Japanese. ``It's my job to make sure that we
preserve our uniqueness under Compass,'' he said, adding that the
deal ``gives us the wherewithal to grow.''
</P>
<P>
   Bailey said that Compass expected to keep and expand the
restaurant operations of Restaurant Associates, as well as its
upscale takeout concepts like Cucina Express and Savories.
</P>
<P>
   The high-end clients of Restaurant Associates ``will not want to
see its operations change,'' said Paul King, a senior editor at
Nation's Restaurant News, a trade publication. He said that
although Compass had the largest global revenues of any
food-service company, it had permitted a 1995 acquisition, Flik
International, _ an upscale caterer to schools and businesses _ to
function as a separate entity.
</P>
<P>
   Compass has $7 billion in worldwide revenues, of which the
United States accounts for $2.3 billion, making it the
third-largest American food-service provider, after Marriott
Sodexho Services, with $4.3 billion in domestic sales, and Aramark,
with $3.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Compass is already a powerful presence in supplying food to
corporations; two years ago it won a $60 million, five-year
contract to provide food and vending services for I &UR; . &LR; B &UR; . &LR; M. Its
subsidiaries provide food to colleges, universities, hospitals and
nursing homes.
</P>
<P>
   In part, Compass, a dominant player in the highly profitable
European event-catering and stadium-service industry, acquired
Restaurant Associates ``to move us into the concession market in
the United States,'' Bailey said, adding, ``R.A. will allow us to
seriously bid for more museums, performing arts centers and sports
groups nationwide.''
</P>
<P>
   Knapp said that the acquisition, which he acknowledged brought
``a high price,'' would provide substantial profits not only to
Restaurant Associates management but also to backers including
Bruckmann, Rosser, Sherrill &AMP; Co &UR; . &LR; , and Furman Selz, two
Manhattan-based investment funds that helped Restaurant Associates
finance its buyback from Kyotaru.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey said that Compass would buy the Acapulco chain and then
spin it off, selling it to its own managers as a privately held,
free-standing restaurant company with financing from Bruckmann,
Rosser and Furman Selz.

PATIENCE PAYING OFF FOR USC DECATHLETE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KIRBY LEE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Danny Haag is 21 years old. And a freshman.
</P>
<P>
   The Granada Hills High graduate is competing today at the NCAA
Track and Field Championships in Buffalo, N.Y., and is a favorite
in the two-day, 10-event decathlon.
</P>
<P>
   Haag was an NCAA academic qualifier out of high school, but he
received no scholarship offers despite placing fourth in the high
school state meet in the long jump and qualifying for the finals in
the long jump.
</P>
<P>
   So for the past four years, Haag has awaited a chance to
showcase his talents at a Division I university. He trained
full-time while attending college part-time, first at Pierce
College and then at UCLA and Valley College. He attended all three
schools concurrently for a semester before finally enrolling at USC
last spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was getting impatient when and where I was going,'' Haag
said. ``I didn't think it would take this long, but I think it
helped prepare me for college.''
</P>
<P>
   In March, at his first official competition in two years, Haag
posted a personal-best and USC-freshman record 7,623 points to
automatically qualify for the NCAA Championships.
</P>
<P>
   After missing the last two months of training because of an
inflammation of his pubic bone, Haag would be happy to equal his
total at the NCAAs. Haag, who had been training seven hours a day,
was forced to a sedentary lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   The condition known as osteritus pubis results from the
irritation of the pubic symphesis and can also cause hamstring,
groin and back pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Training was like a full-time job,'' Haag said. ``I like to
work hard and I get bored doing one or two events. I always have to
be doing something to keep me busy. I couldn't do anything except
go to class and watch TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Training partner Shawn Wilbourn advised Haag to rest. Wilbourn,
who placed third in the 1997 U.S. nationals, suffered the same
injury last year.
</P>
<P>
   After three cortisone shots and no workouts, Haag decided to
compete in the Pacific-10 Conference championships in the 110-meter
high hurdles, long jump and high jump two weeks ago as a litmus
test for the NCAA meet.
</P>
<P>
   He competed without any severe discomfort and placed seventh in
the 110-meter high hurdles in 14.65, less than two-tenths of a
second off his best of 14.50.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very worried. I didn't know if I would hold up,'' Haag
said. ``Now I know that I haven't really lost much without a day of
training.''
</P>
<P>
   The primary concern for the NCAA meet is whether Haag can make
it through the long jump and the 110 hurdles without aggravating
the injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he progressed through the season without injury, we'd be
looking at a totally different score,'' said USC jumps coach Allan
Hanckel, who has coached Haag for the past three years. ``The most
important thing is to get him running again.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Hanckel's guidance Haag has improved to 15-5 and 195-6 in
the pole vault and javelin and timed 48.90 for the 400.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, Haag has two priorities _ break Henry Gonzales'
school record of 7,960 points set in the 1984 U.S. Olympic Trials
and win an NCAA title.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was my plan for this year before the injury,'' Haag said.
``Realistically, I thought I had a chance. I figure I am going to
be hurting physically at the NCAAs because I haven't been training.
I'd like to do well and get back right into training and post a big
score just to show I could have won it.''
